|[BI-GCN: Bilateral Interactive Graph Convolutional Network for Recommendation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615232)|Yinan Zhang, Pei Wang, Congcong Liu, Xiwei Zhao, Hao Qi, Jie He, Junsheng Jin, Changping Peng, Zhangang Lin, Jingping Shao|JD.com, Beijing, China|Recently, Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based methods have become novel state-of-the-arts for Collaborative Filtering (CF) based Recommender Systems. To obtain users' preferences over different items, it is a common practice to learn representations of users and items by performing embedding propagation on a user-item bipartite graph, and then calculate the preference scores based on the representations. However, in most existing algorithms, user/item representations are generated independently of target items/users. To address this problem, we propose a novel graph attention model named Bilateral Interactive GCN (BI-GCN), which introduces bilateral interactive guidance into each user-item pair and thus leads to target-aware representations for preference prediction. Specifically, to learn the user/item representation from its neighborhood, we assign higher attention weights to those neighbors similar to the target item/user. By this manner, we can obtain target-aware representations, i.e., the information of the target item/user is explicitly encoded in the corresponding user/item representation, for more precise matching. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of BI-GCN.|最近，基于图卷积网络(GCN)的方法已经成为基于协同过滤(CF)的推荐系统的最新技术。为了获得用户对不同项目的偏好，通常的做法是通过在用户-项目二部图上嵌入传播来学习用户和项目的表示，然后根据表示计算偏好得分。但是，在大多数现有算法中，用户/项表示是独立于目标项/用户生成的。为了解决这一问题，我们提出了一种新的图形注意模型——双边交互式 GCN (BI-GCN) ，该模型将双边交互式引导引入到每个用户项目对中，从而产生用于偏好预测的目标感知表示。具体来说，为了从邻域中学习用户/项目表示，我们给与目标项目/用户相似的邻域分配更高的注意力权重。通过这种方式，我们可以获得目标感知的表示，也就是说，目标项/用户的信息显式地编码在相应的用户/项表示中，以便进行更精确的匹配。在三个基准数据集上的大量实验证明了 BI-GCN 的有效性和鲁棒性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=BI-GCN:+Bilateral+Interactive+Graph+Convolutional+Network+for+Recommendation)|1|
|[Monotonic Neural Ordinary Differential Equation: Time-series Forecasting for Cumulative Data](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615487)|Zhichao Chen, Leilei Ding, Zhixuan Chu, Yucheng Qi, Jianmin Huang, Hao Wang|Ant Group, Hangzhou, China|Time-Series Forecasting based on Cumulative Data (TSFCD) is a crucial problem in decision-making across various industrial scenarios. However, existing time-series forecasting methods often overlook two important characteristics of cumulative data, namely monotonicity and irregularity, which limit their practical applicability. To address this limitation, we propose a principled approach called Monotonic neural Ordinary Differential Equation (MODE) within the framework of neural ordinary differential equations. By leveraging MODE, we are able to effectively capture and represent the monotonicity and irregularity in practical cumulative data. Through extensive experiments conducted in a bonus allocation scenario, we demonstrate that MODE outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its ability to handle both monotonicity and irregularity in cumulative data and delivering superior forecasting performance.|基于累积数据的时间序列预测是各种工业情景下决策的关键问题。然而，现有的时间序列预测方法往往忽视了累积数据的两个重要特征，即单调性和不规则性，这限制了它们的实际应用。为了解决这一局限性，我们提出了一种在神经常微分方程框架内的原理性方法，称为单调神经常微分方程(MODE)。通过利用 MODE，我们能够有效地捕获和表示实际累积数据中的单调性和不规则性。通过在奖金分配场景中进行的大量实验，我们证明了 MODE 优于最先进的方法，展示了其处理累积数据中的单调性和不规则性的能力，并提供了卓越的预测性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Monotonic+Neural+Ordinary+Differential+Equation:+Time-series+Forecasting+for+Cumulative+Data)|1|
|[Continual Learning in Predictive Autoscaling](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615463)|Hongyan Hao, Zhixuan Chu, Shiyi Zhu, Gangwei Jiang, Yan Wang, Caigao Jiang, James Y. Zhang, Wei Jiang, Siqiao Xue, Jun Zhou|Ant Group, Hangzhou, China; Ant Group, New York, NY, USA|Predictive Autoscaling is used to forecast the workloads of servers and prepare the resources in advance to ensure service level objectives (SLOs) in dynamic cloud environments.However, in practice, its prediction task often suffers from performance degradation under abnormal traffics caused by external events (such as sales promotional activities and applications' re-configurations), for which a common solution is to re-train the model with data of a long historical period, but at the expense of high computational and storage costs.To better address this problem, we propose a replay-based continual learning method, i.e., Density-based Memory Selection and Hint-based Network Learning Model (DMSHM), using only a small part of the historical log to achieve accurate predictions.First, we discover the phenomenon of sample overlap when applying replay-based continual learning in prediction tasks. In order to surmount this challenge and effectively integrate new sample distribution, we propose a density-based sample selection strategy that utilizes kernel density estimation to calculate sample density as a reference to compute sample weight, and employs weight sampling to construct a new memory set.Then we implement hint-based network learning based on hint representation to optimize the parameters.Finally, we conduct experiments on public and industrial datasets to demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art continual learning methods in terms of memory capacity and prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate remarkable practicability of DMSHM in real industrial applications.|预测性自动伸缩用于预测服务器的工作负载并提前准备资源，以确保动态云环境中的服务水平目标(SLOs)。然而，在实践中，其预测任务往往受到异常流量下的性能下降的外部事件(如销售促销活动和应用程序的重新配置) ，其中一个常见的解决方案是重新训练模型与长期的历史时期的数据，但以高计算和存储成本为代价。为了更好地解决这个问题，我们提出了一个基于重放的连续学习方法，即基于密度的记忆选择和基于提示的网络学习模型(DMSHM) ，只使用历史日志的一小部分来实现准确的预测。首先，我们发现了在预测任务中应用基于重播的连续学习时样本重叠的现象。为了克服这个挑战，并有效地整合新的样本分布，我们提出一个基于密度的样本选择策略，利用核密度估计计算样本密度作为计算样本权重的参考，并利用权重采样来构建一个新的记忆集。然后基于提示表示实现了基于提示的网络学习，对参数进行了优化。最后，我们在公共数据集和工业数据集上进行了实验，结果表明我们提出的方法在记忆容量和预测准确性方面优于最先进的连续学习方法。此外，我们证明了 DMSHM 在实际工业应用中的显著实用性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Continual+Learning+in+Predictive+Autoscaling)|1|
|[TEI2GO: A Multilingual Approach for Fast Temporal Expression Identification](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615130)|Hugo Sousa, Ricardo Campos, Alípio Jorge|University of Porto & INESC TEC, Porto, Portugal; University of Beira Interior & INESC TEC, Covilhã, Portugal|Temporal expression identification is crucial for understanding texts written in natural language. Although highly effective systems such as HeidelTime exist, their limited runtime performance hampers adoption in large-scale applications and production environments. In this paper, we introduce the TEI2GO models, matching HeidelTime's effectiveness but with significantly improved runtime, supporting six languages, and achieving state-of-the-art results in four of them. To train the TEI2GO models, we used a combination of manually annotated reference corpus and developed "Professor HeidelTime'', a comprehensive weakly labeled corpus of news texts annotated with HeidelTime. This corpus comprises a total of 138,069 documents (over six languages) with 1,050,921 temporal expressions, the largest open-source annotated dataset for temporal expression identification to date. By describing how the models were produced, we aim to encourage the research community to further explore, refine, and extend the set of models to additional languages and domains. Code, annotations, and models are openly available for community exploration and use. The models are conveniently on HuggingFace for seamless integration and application.|时间表达式识别是理解自然语言文本的关键。尽管存在像 HeidelTime 这样的高效系统，但它们有限的运行时性能阻碍了在大规模应用程序和生产环境中的采用。在本文中，我们介绍了 TEI2GO 模型，匹配 HeidelTime 的有效性，但有显著改进的运行时，支持六种语言，并在其中四种语言中取得了最先进的结果。为了训练 TEI2GO 模型，我们使用了人工注释的参考语料库的组合，并开发了“海德尔时间教授”，一个全面的弱标记的新闻文本的海德尔时间注释语料库。这个语料库包含138,069个文档(超过6种语言)和1,050,921个时态表达式，是迄今为止用于时态表达式识别的最大的开源注释数据集。通过描述模型是如何产生的，我们的目标是鼓励研究团体进一步探索、完善和扩展模型集到其他语言和领域。代码、注释和模型可供社区探索和使用。该模型可以方便地在 HuggingFace 上进行无缝集成和应用。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=TEI2GO:+A+Multilingual+Approach+for+Fast+Temporal+Expression+Identification)|1|
|[APGL4SR: A Generic Framework with Adaptive and Personalized Global Collaborative Information in Sequential Recommendation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614781)|Mingjia Yin, Hao Wang, Xiang Xu, Likang Wu, Sirui Zhao, Wei Guo, Yong Liu, Ruiming Tang, Defu Lian, Enhong Chen|Huawei Singapore Research Center, Singapore, Singapore; Huawei Noah's Ark Lab, Shenzhen, China; University of Science and Technology of China & State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Intelligence, Hefei, China|The sequential recommendation system has been widely studied for its promising effectiveness in capturing dynamic preferences buried in users' sequential behaviors. Despite the considerable achievements, existing methods usually focus on intra-sequence modeling while overlooking exploiting global collaborative information by inter-sequence modeling, resulting in inferior recommendation performance. Therefore, previous works attempt to tackle this problem with a global collaborative item graph constructed by pre-defined rules. However, these methods neglect two crucial properties when capturing global collaborative information, i.e., adaptiveness and personalization, yielding sub-optimal user representations. To this end, we propose a graph-driven framework, named Adaptive and Personalized Graph Learning for Sequential Recommendation (APGL4SR), that incorporates adaptive and personalized global collaborative information into sequential recommendation systems. Specifically, we first learn an adaptive global graph among all items and capture global collaborative information with it in a self-supervised fashion, whose computational burden can be further alleviated by the proposed SVD-based accelerator. Furthermore, based on the graph, we propose to extract and utilize personalized item correlations in the form of relative positional encoding, which is a highly compatible manner of personalizing the utilization of global collaborative information. Finally, the entire framework is optimized in a multi-task learning paradigm, thus each part of APGL4SR can be mutually reinforced. As a generic framework, APGL4SR can not only outperform other baselines with significant margins, but also exhibit promising versatility, the ability to learn a meaningful global collaborative graph, and the ability to alleviate the dimensional collapse issue of item embeddings.|顺序推荐系统在捕获隐藏在用户顺序行为中的动态偏好方面有着广泛的应用前景。尽管已经取得了相当大的成就，但现有的方法往往只注重序列内建模，而忽视了通过序列间建模来开发全局协同信息，导致推荐性能较差。因此，以往的研究尝试利用预先定义的规则构造一个全局协同项目图来解决这个问题。然而，这些方法在获取全局协作信息时忽略了两个关键性质，即适应性和个性化，产生了次优的用户表示。为此，我们提出了一个图驱动的序列推荐自适应和个性化图学习框架(APGL4SR) ，该框架将自适应和个性化的全局协作信息融入到序列推荐系统中。具体来说，我们首先学习一个所有项目之间的自适应全局图，并以自监督的方式捕获全局协作信息，通过提出的基于奇异值分解的加速器可以进一步减轻全局协作信息的计算负担。在此基础上，提出了以相对位置编码的形式提取和利用个性化项目相关性，这是一种高度兼容的利用全球协同信息的个性化方式。最后，在多任务学习范式下对整个框架进行优化，使 APGL4SR 的各个部分得到相互增强。作为一个通用框架，APGL4SR 不仅具有显著的优势，而且具有良好的通用性、学习有意义的全局协作图的能力以及缓解项目嵌入的尺寸崩溃问题的能力。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=APGL4SR:+A+Generic+Framework+with+Adaptive+and+Personalized+Global+Collaborative+Information+in+Sequential+Recommendation)|0|
|[Query-dominant User Interest Network for Large-Scale Search Ranking](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615022)|Tong Guo, Xuanping Li, Haitao Yang, Xiao Liang, Yong Yuan, Jingyou Hou, Bingqing Ke, Chao Zhang, Junlin He, Shunyu Zhang, Enyun Yu, Wenwu Ou|unaffiliated, Beijing, China; Kuaishou Technology Co., Ltd, Beijing, China|Historical behaviors have shown great effect and potential in various prediction tasks, including recommendation and information retrieval. The overall historical behaviors are various but noisy while search behaviors are always sparse. Most existing approaches in personalized search ranking adopt the sparse search behaviors to learn representation with bottleneck, which do not sufficiently exploit the crucial long-term interest. In fact, there is no doubt that user long-term interest is various but noisy for instant search, and how to exploit it well still remains an open problem. To tackle this problem, in this work, we propose a novel model named Query-dominant user Interest Network (QIN), including two cascade units to filter the raw user behaviors and reweigh the behavior subsequences. Specifically, we propose a relevance search unit (RSU), which aims to search a subsequence relevant to the query first and then search the sub-subsequences relevant to the target item. These items are then fed into an attention unit called Fused Attention Unit (FAU). It should be able to calculate attention scores from the ID field and attribute field separately, and then adaptively fuse the item embedding and content embedding based on the user engagement of past period. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over state-of-the-art methods. The QIN now has been successfully deployed on Kuaishou search, an online video search platform, and obtained 7.6% improvement on CTR.|历史行为在各种预测任务中显示出巨大的效果和潜力，包括推荐和信息检索。整体的历史行为是多样的，但是有噪声，而搜索行为总是稀疏的。大多数现有的个性化检索排名方法采用稀疏搜索行为来学习带有瓶颈的表示，这种方法没有充分利用关键的长期兴趣。事实上，毫无疑问，用户对即时搜索的长期兴趣是多种多样的，但是噪音很大，如何很好地利用它仍然是一个悬而未决的问题。为了解决这一问题，本文提出了一种新的查询主导用户兴趣网络(QIN)模型，该模型包括两个级联单元，用于过滤原始用户行为和重新权衡行为子序列。具体来说，我们提出了一种相关搜索单元(RSU) ，它的目的是先搜索与查询相关的子序列，然后再搜索与目标项相关的子子序列。然后，这些物品被输入一个称为“融合注意力单元”(FAU)的注意力单元。它应该能够分别从 ID 字段和属性字段计算注意力得分，然后根据用户过去一段时间的参与度自适应地融合项目嵌入和内容嵌入。对真实世界数据集的大量实验和消融研究表明，我们的模型优于最先进的方法。QIN 现已成功部署在快手搜索(一个在线视频搜索平台)上，点击率提高了7.6% 。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Query-dominant+User+Interest+Network+for+Large-Scale+Search+Ranking)|0|
|[Modeling Sequential Collaborative User Behaviors For Seller-Aware Next Basket Recommendation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614973)|Ziyi Kou, Saurav Manchanda, ShihTing Lin, Min Xie, Haixun Wang, Xiangliang Zhang|Instacart, San Francisco, CA, USA; University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA|Next Basket Recommendation (NBR) aims to recommend a set of products as a basket to users based on their historical shopping behavior. In this paper, we investigate the problem of NBR in online marketplaces (e.g., Instacart, Uber Eats) that connect users with multiple sellers. In such scenarios, effective NBR can significantly enhance the shopping experience of users by recommending diversified and completed products based on specific sellers, especially when a user purchases from a seller they have not visited before. However, conventional NBR approaches assume that all considered products are from the same sellers, which overlooks the complex relationships between users, sellers, and products. To address such limitations, we develop SecGT, a sequential collaborative graph transformer framework that recommends users with baskets from specific sellers based on seller-aware user preference representations that are generated by collaboratively modeling the joint user-seller-product interactions and sequentially exploring the user-agnostic basket transitions in an interactive way. We evaluate the performance of SecGT on users from a leading online marketplace at multiple cities with various involved sellers. The results show that SecGT outperforms existing NBR and also traditional product recommendation approaches on recommending baskets from cold sellers for different types of users across all cities.|下一个购物篮推荐系统(NBR)的目标是根据用户的历史购物行为向他们推荐一组产品作为购物篮。在本文中，我们研究了在线市场(如 Instacart，Uber Eats)中连接用户和多个卖家的 NBR 问题。在这种情况下，有效的 NBR 可以通过推荐基于特定卖家的多样化和完整的产品来显著提高用户的购物体验，特别是当用户从他们以前没有访问过的卖家那里购买产品时。然而，传统的 NBR 方法假设所有被考虑的产品都来自同一个销售商，这忽略了用户、销售商和产品之间的复杂关系。为了解决这些局限性，我们开发了 SecGT，这是一个连续的协作图形转换框架，根据卖方感知的用户偏好表示，通过协作建模联合用户-卖方-产品交互并以交互方式顺序探索用户不可知的篮子转换来推荐用户。我们评估的性能，从一个领先的在线市场在多个城市的用户与各种参与的卖家。结果表明，在向各城市不同类型的用户推荐冷卖篮子方面，SecGT 的表现优于现有的 NBR 和传统的产品推荐方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Modeling+Sequential+Collaborative+User+Behaviors+For+Seller-Aware+Next+Basket+Recommendation)|0|
|[Rec4Ad: A Free Lunch to Mitigate Sample Selection Bias for Ads CTR Prediction in Taobao](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615496)|Jingyue Gao, Shuguang Han, Han Zhu, Siran Yang, Yuning Jiang, Jian Xu, Bo Zheng|Alibaba Group, Beijing, China|Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction serves as a fundamental component in online advertising. A common practice is to train a CTR model on advertisement (ad) impressions with user feedback. Since ad impressions are purposely selected by the model itself, their distribution differs from the inference distribution and thus exhibits sample selection bias (SSB) that affects model performance. Existing studies on SSB mainly employ sample re-weighting techniques which suffer from high variance and poor model calibration. Another line of work relies on costly uniform data that is inadequate to train industrial models. Thus mitigating SSB in industrial models with a uniform-data-free framework is worth exploring. Fortunately, many platforms display mixed results of organic items (i.e., recommendations) and sponsored items (i.e., ads) to users, where impressions of ads and recommendations are selected by different systems but share the same user decision rationales. Based on the above characteristics, we propose to leverage recommendations samples as a free lunch to mitigate SSB for ads CTR model (Rec4Ad). After elaborating data augmentation, Rec4Ad learns disentangled representations with alignment and decorrelation modules for enhancement. When deployed in Taobao display advertising system, Rec4Ad achieves substantial gains in key business metrics, with a lift of up to +6.6\% CTR and +2.9\% RPM.|点进率预测是在线广告的一个基本组成部分。一个常见的做法是训练广告(广告)印象与用户反馈的点击率模型。由于广告印象是由模型本身有目的地选择的，它们的分布不同于推断分布，因此表现出影响模型性能的样本选择偏差(SSB)。现有的 SSB 研究主要采用样本重权重技术，存在方差大、模型校正差等问题。另一项工作依赖于昂贵的统一数据，这些数据不足以培训工业模型。因此，在无统一数据框架的工业模型中减少 SSB 是值得探索的。幸运的是，许多平台向用户显示有机项目(即推荐)和赞助项目(即广告)的混合结果，其中广告和推荐的印象由不同的系统选择，但共享相同的用户决策理由。基于上述特点，我们建议利用推荐样本作为免费午餐，以减轻 SSB 广告点击率模型(Rec4Ad)。在详细阐述了数据增强之后，Rec4Ad 学习了利用对齐和去相关模块进行增强的解纠缠表示。在淘宝展示广告系统中部署 Rec4Ad 后，Rec4Ad 在关键业务指标上取得了实质性进展，点击率和转速分别提高了6.6% 和2.9% 。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Rec4Ad:+A+Free+Lunch+to+Mitigate+Sample+Selection+Bias+for+Ads+CTR+Prediction+in+Taobao)|0|
|[Fragment and Integrate Network (FIN): A Novel Spatial-Temporal Modeling Based on Long Sequential Behavior for Online Food Ordering Click-Through Rate Prediction](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615478)|Jun Li, Ge Zhang||Spatial-temporal information has been proven to be of great significance for click-through rate prediction tasks in online Location-Based Services (LBS), especially in mainstream food ordering platforms such as DoorDash, Uber Eats, Meituan, and Ele.me. Modeling user spatial-temporal preferences with sequential behavior data has become a hot topic in recommendation systems and online advertising. However, most of existing methods either lack the representation of rich spatial-temporal information or only handle user behaviors with limited length, e.g. 100. In this paper, we tackle these problems by designing a new spatial-temporal modeling paradigm named Fragment and Integrate Network (FIN). FIN consists of two networks: (i) Fragment Network (FN) extracts Multiple Sub-Sequences (MSS) from lifelong sequential behavior data, and captures the specific spatial-temporal representation by modeling each MSS respectively. Here both a simplified attention and a complicated attention are adopted to balance the performance gain and resource consumption. (ii) Integrate Network (IN) builds a new integrated sequence by utilizing spatial-temporal interaction on MSS and captures the comprehensive spatial-temporal representation by modeling the integrated sequence with a complicated attention. Both public datasets and production datasets have demonstrated the accuracy and scalability of FIN. Since 2022, FIN has been fully deployed in the recommendation advertising system of Ele.me, one of the most popular online food ordering platforms in China, obtaining 5.7% improvement on Click-Through Rate (CTR) and 7.3% increase on Revenue Per Mille (RPM).|时空信息已被证明对于在线基于位置服务(LBS)的点进率预测任务具有重要意义，特别是在主流食品订购平台如 DoorDash、 Uber Eats、美团和 Ele.me 中。利用序列行为数据建立用户时空偏好模型已成为推荐系统和在线广告研究的热点。然而，大多数现有的方法要么缺乏丰富的时空信息的表示，要么只能处理有限长度的用户行为，例如100。针对这些问题，本文设计了一种新的时空建模范式——分段集成网络(FIN)。FIN 由两个网络组成: (1)片段网络(FN)从终身序列行为数据中提取多个子序列(MSS) ，并分别对每个子序列进行建模，获取特定的时空表示。这里采用了简化注意和复杂注意来平衡性能增益和资源消耗。(2)综合网络(IN)利用 MSS 上的时空相互作用建立一个新的综合序列，通过对综合序列进行复杂注意力建模，获取综合的时空表示。公共数据集和生产数据集都证明了 FIN 的准确性和可扩展性。自2022年以来，中国最受欢迎的在线食品订购平台之一饿了么的推荐广告系统中已经全面部署了财务识别系统，点进率点击率提高了5.7% ，每公里收入提高了7.3% 。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Fragment+and+Integrate+Network+(FIN):+A+Novel+Spatial-Temporal+Modeling+Based+on+Long+Sequential+Behavior+for+Online+Food+Ordering+Click-Through+Rate+Prediction)|0|
|[Batch-Mix Negative Sampling for Learning Recommendation Retrievers](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614789)|Yongfu Fan, Jin Chen, Yongquan Jiang, Defu Lian, Fangda Guo, Kai Zheng|Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China; University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China; University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China; Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China|Recommendation retrievers commonly retrieve user potentially preferred items from numerous items, where the query and item representation are learned according to the dual encoders with the log-softmax loss. Under real scenarios, the number of items becomes considerably large, making it exceedingly difficult to calculate the partition function with the whole item corpus. Negative sampling, which samples a subset from the item corpus, is widely used to accelerate the model training. Among different samplers, the in-batch sampling is commonly adopted for online recommendation retrievers, which regards the other items within the mini-batch as the negative samples for the given query, owing to its time and memory efficiency. However, the sample selection bias occurs due to the skewed feedback, harming the retrieval quality. In this paper, we propose a negative sampling approach named Batch-Mix Negative Sampling (BMNS), which adopts batch mixing operation to generate additional negatives for model training. Concretely, BMNS first generates new negative items with the sampled mix coefficient from the Beta distribution, after which a tailored correct strategy guided by frequency is designed to match the sampled softmax loss. In this way, the effort of re-encoding items out of the mini-batch is reduced while also improving the representation space of the negative set. The empirical experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate BMNS is superior to the competitive negative inbatch sampling method.|推荐检索器通常从许多项目中检索用户潜在首选项，其中根据带有 log-softmax 损失的双编码器学习查询和项表示。在实际情况下，条目的数量会变得相当大，这使得用整个条目语料库计算配分函数变得非常困难。负抽样是从项目语料库中抽取子集，广泛用于加速模型训练。在不同的抽样方法中，在线推荐检索通常采用批内抽样，由于时间和内存效率的原因，将小批内的其他项目作为给定查询的否定样本。然而，样本选择偏差的产生是由于反馈的偏差，影响了检索质量。本文提出了一种负抽样方法——批量混合负抽样(BMNS) ，该方法采用批量混合操作产生附加负数，用于模型训练。具体来说，BMNS 首先根据采样的混合系数生成新的负项，然后根据频率设计一个量身定制的正确策略，以匹配采样的软最大损失(softmax loss) Β分布。这样，既减少了从小批处理中重新编码项的工作量，又提高了负集的表示空间。在四个实际数据集上的实验表明，BMNS 方法优于竞争性负内批抽样方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Batch-Mix+Negative+Sampling+for+Learning+Recommendation+Retrievers)|0|
|[Dynamic Embedding Size Search with Minimum Regret for Streaming Recommender System](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615135)|Bowei He, Xu He, Renrui Zhang, Yingxue Zhang, Ruiming Tang, Chen Ma|City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong; Huawei Noah's Ark Lab, Shenzhen, China; Huawei Noah's Ark Lab Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada; The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong|With the continuous increase of users and items, conventional recommender systems trained on static datasets can hardly adapt to changing environments. The high-throughput data requires the model to be updated in a timely manner for capturing the user interest dynamics, which leads to the emergence of streaming recommender systems. Due to the prevalence of deep learning-based recommender systems, the embedding layer is widely adopted to represent the characteristics of users, items, and other features in low-dimensional vectors. However, it has been proved that setting an identical and static embedding size is sub-optimal in terms of recommendation performance and memory cost, especially for streaming recommendations. To tackle this problem, we first rethink the streaming model update process and model the dynamic embedding size search as a bandit problem. Then, we analyze and quantify the factors that influence the optimal embedding sizes from the statistics perspective. Based on this, we propose the \textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{E}mbedding \textbf{S}ize \textbf{S}earch (\textbf{DESS}) method to minimize the embedding size selection regret on both user and item sides in a non-stationary manner. Theoretically, we obtain a sublinear regret upper bound superior to previous methods. Empirical results across two recommendation tasks on four public datasets also demonstrate that our approach can achieve better streaming recommendation performance with lower memory cost and higher time efficiency.|随着用户和项目的不断增加，传统的基于静态数据集的推荐系统难以适应不断变化的环境。高吞吐量数据要求模型及时更新，以捕捉用户兴趣动态，从而导致流式推荐系统的出现。由于基于深度学习的推荐系统的普及，嵌入层被广泛采用来在低维向量中表示用户、项目等特征。然而，已经证明，设置一个相同的静态嵌入大小在推荐性能和内存成本方面是次优的，特别是对于流式推荐。为了解决这个问题，我们首先重新考虑了流模型更新过程，并将动态嵌入大小搜索模型建模为盗贼问题。然后，从统计学的角度对影响最优嵌入规模的因素进行了分析和量化。在此基础上，提出了一种动态 textbf { D }嵌入 textbf { E }嵌入 textbf { S } ize textbf { S } earch (textbf { DESS })方法，以非平稳方式最小化用户端和项目端的嵌入大小选择遗憾。从理论上，我们得到了一个次线性后悔上界优于以往的方法。对四个公共数据集的两个推荐任务的实验结果也表明，该方法能够以较低的内存开销和较高的时间效率获得较好的流推荐性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Dynamic+Embedding+Size+Search+with+Minimum+Regret+for+Streaming+Recommender+System)|0|
|[Text Matching Improves Sequential Recommendation by Reducing Popularity Biases](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615077)|Zhenghao Liu, Sen Mei, Chenyan Xiong, Xiaohua Li, Shi Yu, Zhiyuan Liu, Yu Gu, Ge Yu|Northeastern University, Shenyang, China; Tsinghua University, Beijing, China; Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA|This paper proposes Text mAtching based SequenTial rEcommendation model (TASTE), which maps items and users in an embedding space and recommends items by matching their text representations. TASTE verbalizes items and user-item interactions using identifiers and attributes of items. To better characterize user behaviors, TASTE additionally proposes an attention sparsity method, which enables TASTE to model longer user-item interactions by reducing the self-attention computations during encoding. Our experiments show that TASTE outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on widely used sequential recommendation datasets. TASTE alleviates the cold start problem by representing long-tail items using full-text modeling and bringing the benefits of pretrained language models to recommendation systems.

|[Cracking the Code of Negative Transfer: A Cooperative Game Theoretic Approach for Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614828)|Chung Park, Taesan Kim, Taekyoon Choi, Junui Hong, Yelim Yu, Mincheol Cho, Kyunam Lee, Sungil Ryu, Hyungjun Yoon, Minsung Choi, Jaegul Choo|SK Telecom & Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul & Daejeon, Republic of Korea; Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Republic of Korea; SK Telelcom, Seoul, Republic of Korea; NAVER, Seongnam, Republic of Korea; SK Telelcom & Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul & Daejeon, Republic of Korea|This paper investigates Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR), a promising method that uses information from multiple domains (more than three) to generate accurate and diverse recommendations, and takes into account the sequential nature of user interactions. The effectiveness of these systems often depends on the complex interplay among the multiple domains. In this dynamic landscape, the problem of negative transfer arises, where heterogeneous knowledge between dissimilar domains leads to performance degradation due to differences in user preferences across these domains. As a remedy, we propose a new CDSR framework that addresses the problem of negative transfer by assessing the extent of negative transfer from one domain to another and adaptively assigning low weight values to the corresponding prediction losses. To this end, the amount of negative transfer is estimated by measuring the marginal contribution of each domain to model performance based on a cooperative game theory. In addition, a hierarchical contrastive learning approach that incorporates information from the sequence of coarse-level categories into that of fine-level categories (e.g., item level) when implementing contrastive learning was developed to mitigate negative transfer. Despite the potentially low relevance between domains at the fine-level, there may be higher relevance at the category level due to its generalised and broader preferences. We show that our model is superior to prior works in terms of model performance on two real-world datasets across ten different domains.|本文研究了跨域序列推荐(CDSR) ，这是一种利用多个域(超过三个)的信息来生成准确和多样化推荐的有前途的方法，并考虑了用户交互的序列特性。这些系统的有效性往往取决于多个领域之间复杂的相互作用。在这种动态环境中，出现了负迁移问题，即不同领域之间的异质知识由于这些领域的用户偏好不同而导致性能下降。作为补救措施，我们提出了一个新的 CDSR 框架，通过评估从一个领域到另一个领域的负转移程度，并自适应地为相应的预测损失赋予低权值来解决负转移问题。为此，负向转移的数量是通过衡量每个领域对基于合作博弈理论的绩效模型的边际贡献来估计的。此外，在实施对比学习的过程中，还开发了一种分层对比学习方法，将粗级别类别的信息整合到细级别类别的信息中(例如，项目级别) ，以减轻负迁移。尽管在精细层面上各领域之间的相关性可能较低，但在类别层面上可能具有更高的相关性，因为它具有普遍性和更广泛的偏好。我们表明，我们的模型是优于以往的工作方面的两个真实世界的数据集在十个不同的领域的模型性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Cracking+the+Code+of+Negative+Transfer:+A+Cooperative+Game+Theoretic+Approach+for+Cross-Domain+Sequential+Recommendation)|0|

However, these methods fail to explicitly consider personalized interest sustainability, which means whether each user's interest in specific POIs will sustain beyond the training time. In this work, we propose a personalized INterest Sustainability modeling framework for sequential POI REcommendation, INSPIRE for brevity. Different from existing methods that directly recommend next POIs through users' historical trajectories, our proposed INSPIRE focuses on users' personalized interest sustainability. Specifically, we first develop a new task to predict whether each user will visit the POIs in the recent period of the training time. Afterwards, to remedy the sparsity issue of users' check-in history, we propose to augment users' check-in history in three ways: geographical, intrinsic, and extrinsic schemes.

In QR, we map a poorly formed or low coverage user query to a few semantically similar queries that are rich in product coverage, thereby enabling effective targeted searches with less cognitive load on the user. Recent QR approaches based on generative language models are superior to informational retrieval-based methods but exhibit key limitations: (i) generated reformulations often have low lexical diversity and fail to retrieve a large set of relevant products of a wider variety, (ii) the training objective of generative models does not incorporate a our goal of improving product coverage. In this paper, we propose RLQR (Reinforcement Learning for Query Reformulations), for generating high quality diverse reformulations which aim to maximize the product coverage (number of distinct relevant products returned). We evaluate our approach against supervised generative models and strong RL-based methods.

Chi|Google Inc, Mountain View, CA, USA; Google DeepMind, Mountain View, CA, USA|In recent years, social media users spend significant amount of time on Short-Form Video (SFV) platforms. Its success in creating an immersive viewership experience is not only from the content, but also due to its unique UI innovation: instead of providing choices for users to click, SFV platforms actively recommend content to users to watch one at a time. In this paper, we highlight unique challenges rooted from such UI changes for SFV recommendation system design. Firstly, there is yet much unexplored for sources of system biases under the new UI, as there are no clicks nor the common click-based position biases. Additionally, when training multiple types of user activities, positive labels for activities like sharing and commenting can be much sparser and more skewed than traditional click-based recommendation systems, as the latter can filter non-click impressions when generating "post-click" activities. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a unified multi-task ranking framework which puts two novel components all together into an overall system for SFV recommendation. First, we identify that there are position biases of SFVs in the recommendation sequence, namely "watch trail biases", and introduce biases correction using trail-related information. Second, to get the most benefits from multi-task learning, especially co-training tasks with extremely skewed and sparse labels, we adapt a disentangle regularization to mitigate task conflicts, introduce loss upweighting for sparse task co-training and adopt a meta-learning algorithm for efficient weight selection. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the framework on one of today's largest SFV platforms. Our framework has been deployed to the production system for more than 6 months.|近年来，社交媒体用户在短视频(SFV)平台上花费了大量的时间。SFV 成功地创造了一种身临其境的观看体验，不仅仅是因为内容，还因为它独特的用户界面创新: SFV 平台没有为用户提供点击选择，而是积极地向用户推荐内容，让他们一次看一个。在本文中，我们强调了这种 UI 变化对 SFV 推荐系统设计的独特挑战。首先，由于没有点击，也没有常见的基于点击的位置偏差，因此在新 UI 下还有很多系统偏差的来源没有被探索。此外，在培训多种类型的用户活动时，分享和评论等活动的正面标签可能比传统的基于点击的推荐系统更稀疏和更倾斜，因为后者可以在生成“后点击”活动时过滤非点击印象。为了应对这些挑战，我们引入了一个统一的多任务排序框架，它将两个新的组件放在一起，形成一个全面的 SFV 推荐系统。首先，我们发现在推荐序列中存在着 SFV 的位置偏差，即“观察轨迹偏差”，并利用轨迹相关信息进行偏差校正。其次，为了从多任务协同学习中获得最大的效益，特别是极度倾斜和稀疏标签的协同训练任务，我们采用了一种解缠正则化来缓解任务冲突，引入了稀疏任务协同训练的损失加权，并采用了一种元学习算法来进行有效的权重选择。我们在当今最大的 SFV 平台之一上展示了该框架的有效性和效率。我们的框架已经部署到生产系统超过6个月了。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Multitask+Ranking+System+for+Immersive+Feed+and+No+More+Clicks:+A+Case+Study+of+Short-Form+Video+Recommendation)|0|

A key challenge is to model user preferences accurately under the condition of data sparsity. To address this challenge, some methods have leveraged external user behavior data from multiple platforms to enrich user representation. However, all of these methods require a consistent user ID across platforms and ignore the information from similar users. In this study, we propose RUEL, a novel retrieval-based sequential recommender that can effectively incorporate external anonymous user behavior data from Edge browser logs to enhance recommendation. We first collect and preprocess a large volume of Edge browser logs over a one-year period and link them to target entities that correspond to candidate items in recommendation datasets. We then design a contrastive learning framework with a momentum encoder and a memory bank to retrieve the most relevant and diverse browsing sequences from the full browsing log based on the semantic similarity between user representations. After retrieval, we apply an item-level attentive selector to filter out noisy items and generate refined sequence embeddings for the final predictor. RUEL is the first method that connects user browsing data with typical recommendation datasets and can be generalized to various recommendation scenarios and datasets. We conduct extensive experiments on four real datasets for sequential recommendation tasks and demonstrate that RUEL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. We also conduct ablation studies and qualitative analysis to validate the effectiveness of each component of RUEL and provide additional insights into our method.|在线推荐系统(RS)旨在将用户的需求与各种平台上可用的大量资源相匹配。在数据稀疏的情况下，准确地建立用户偏好模型是一个关键的挑战。为了解决这个问题，一些方法利用来自多个平台的外部用户行为数据来丰富用户表示。但是，所有这些方法都需要跨平台的一致用户 ID，并忽略来自相似用户的信息。在这项研究中，我们提出了一种新的基于检索的顺序推荐系统 RUEL，它可以有效地合并来自边缘浏览器日志的外部匿名用户行为数据来增强推荐系统。我们首先在一年的时间内收集和预处理大量的 Edge 浏览器日志，并将它们链接到与推荐数据集中的候选项对应的目标实体。然后基于用户表示的语义相似性，设计了一个带有动量编码器和记忆库的对比学习框架，从完整的浏览日志中检索出最相关、最多样的浏览序列。检索后，应用项级注意选择器滤除噪声项，并为最终的预测器生成精化序列嵌入。RUEL 是第一种将用户浏览数据与典型的推荐数据集连接起来的方法，可以推广到各种推荐场景和数据集。我们在四个实际数据集上对顺序推荐任务进行了广泛的实验，并证明 RUEL 显著优于最先进的基线。我们还进行了消融研究和定性分析，以验证 RUEL 的每个组成部分的有效性，并提供额外的见解，我们的方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=RUEL:+Retrieval-Augmented+User+Representation+with+Edge+Browser+Logs+for+Sequential+Recommendation)|0|

A major challenge in conversational search is formulating the most effective query during the dialogue between the searcher and the conversational agent. Unlike traditional information retrieval systems that assume users can independently create queries, conversational settings allow agents to assist users in query formulation. This alleviates the burden on users by leveraging the multi-turn nature of the conversation to aid them in reaching their information goals. Conversational context plays a vital role in the query process. In this work, we focus on understanding and leveraging conversational context from two dimensions: conversational history and knowledge history. The goal is to identify and model the relevant portions from the search dialogue and the knowledge history and to use this within the search process to improve the overall performance of conversational information retrieval systems.|近年来，会话信息检索引起了相当大的关注。会话搜索的一个主要挑战是在搜索者和会话代理人之间的对话中提出最有效的查询。与传统的信息检索系统假设用户可以独立创建查询不同，会话设置允许代理协助用户制定查询。这样可以减轻用户的负担，因为可以利用对话的多回合特性来帮助他们实现信息目标。会话上下文在查询过程中起着至关重要的作用。在这项工作中，我们侧重于从两个维度理解和利用会话语境: 会话历史和知识历史。我们的目标是从搜索对话和知识历史中识别和建模相关部分，并在搜索过程中使用这些来提高会话信息检索系统的整体性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Towards+Effective+Modeling+and+Exploitation+of+Search+and+User+Context+in+Conversational+Information+Retrieval)|0|
|[CPMR: Context-Aware Incremental Sequential Recommendation with Pseudo-Multi-Task Learning](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615512)|Qingtian Bian, Jiaxing Xu, Hui Fang, Yiping Ke|Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore; Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, Shanghai, China|The motivations of users to make interactions can be divided into static preference and dynamic interest. To accurately model user representations over time, recent studies in sequential recommendation utilize information propagation and evolution to mine from batches of arriving interactions. However, they ignore the fact that people are easily influenced by the recent actions of other users in the contextual scenario, and applying evolution across all historical interactions dilutes the importance of recent ones, thus failing to model the evolution of dynamic interest accurately. To address this issue, we propose a Context-Aware Pseudo-Multi-Task Recommender System (CPMR) to model the evolution in both historical and contextual scenarios by creating three representations for each user and item under different dynamics: static embedding, historical temporal states, and contextual temporal states. To dually improve the performance of temporal states evolution and incremental recommendation, we design a Pseudo-Multi-Task Learning (PMTL) paradigm by stacking the incremental single-target recommendations into one multi-target task for joint optimization. Within the PMTL paradigm, CPMR employs a shared-bottom network to conduct the evolution of temporal states across historical and contextual scenarios, as well as the fusion of them at the user-item level. In addition, CPMR incorporates one real tower for incremental predictions, and two pseudo towers dedicated to updating the respective temporal states based on new batches of interactions. Experimental results on four benchmark recommendation datasets show that CPMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves significant gains on three of them.

Nevertheless, the inherent latency between clicks and conversions leads to delayed feedback, which may introduce bias into the prediction models. Compared to indefinitely long conversion delays, post-click user behaviors manifest within a relatively brief time and have been empirically validated to exert a favorable influence on the precision of conversion rate estimates. In light of this, we propose a novel approach that leverages post-click user behaviors to calibrate conversion rate predictions. Specifically, we treat user behaviors as predictable targets to improve accuracy and enhance timeliness. An adaptive loss function based on task uncertainty is employed for multi-task learning. To further reduce calibration error, we integrate the modified prediction model with a parameterized scaling technique.

Different from traditional e-commerce platforms that offer products, users search on life service platforms such as Meituan mainly for product providers, which usually have abundant structured information, e.g. name, address, category, thousands of products. Modeling search relevance with these rich structured contents is challenging due to the following issues: (1) there is language distribution discrepancy among different fields of structured document, making it difficult to directly adopt off-the-shelf pretrained language model based methods like BERT. (2) different fields usually have different importance and their length vary greatly, making it difficult to extract document information helpful for relevance matching. To tackle these issues, in this paper we propose a novel two-stage pretraining and matching architecture for relevance matching with rich structured documents. At pretraining stage, we propose an effective pretraining method that employs both query and multiple fields of document as inputs, including an effective information compression method for lengthy fields. At relevance matching stage, a novel matching method is proposed by leveraging domain knowledge in search query to generate more effective document representations for relevance scoring.

However, synthesizing the top retrieved passages into a complete, relevant, and concise response is still an open challenge. Having snippet-level annotations of relevant passages would enable both (1) the training of response generation models that are able to ground answers in actual statements and (2) the automatic evaluation of the generated responses in terms of completeness. In this paper, we address the problem of collecting high-quality snippet-level answer annotations for two of the TREC Conversational Assistance track datasets. To ensure quality, we first perform a preliminary annotation study, employing different task designs, crowdsourcing platforms, and workers with different qualifications. Based on the outcomes of this study, we refine our annotation protocol before proceeding with the full-scale data collection.

|[IUI: Intent-Enhanced User Interest Modeling for Click-Through Rate Prediction](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614939)|Mao Pan, Tao Yu, Kun Zhou, Zheng Li, Dongyue Wang, Zhuoye Ding, Xiwei Zhao, Sulong Xu|JD.com, Inc., Beijing, China|Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is becoming increasingly vital in many industrial applications, such as recommendations and online advertising. How to precisely capture users' dynamic and evolving interests from previous interactions (e.g., clicks, purchases, etc.) is a challenging task in CTR prediction. Mainstream approaches focus on disentangling user interests in a heuristic way or modeling user interests into a static representation. However, these approaches overlook the importance of users' current intent and the complex interactions between their current intent and global interests. To address these concerns, in this paper, we propose a novel intent-enhanced user interest modeling for click-through rate prediction in large-scale e-commerce recommendations, abbreviated as IUI. Methodologically, different from existing works, we consider users' recent interactions to be inspired by their implicit intent and then leverage an intent-aware network to model their current local interests in a more precise and fine-grained manner. In addition, to obtain a more stable co-dependent global and local interest representation, we employ a co-attention network capable of activating the corresponding interest in global-level interactions and capturing the dynamic interactions between global- and local-level interaction behaviors. Finally, we incorporate self-supervised learning into the model training by maximizing the mutual information between the global and local representations obtained via the above two networks to enhance the CTR prediction performance. Compared with existing methods, IUI benefits from the different granularity of user interest to generate a more accurate and comprehensive preference representation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in various metrics on three real-world datasets. In addition, an online A/B test deployed on the JD recommendation platforms shows a promising improvement across multiple evaluation metrics.|在诸如推荐和在线广告等许多工业应用中，点进率预测(ctrl)正变得越来越重要。如何从以前的交互(例如点击、购买等)中准确捕捉用户的动态和不断变化的兴趣是 CTR 预测中的一个具有挑战性的任务。主流方法侧重于以启发式方式分离用户兴趣，或者将用户兴趣建模为静态表示。然而，这些方法忽略了用户当前意图的重要性，以及用户当前意图与全局兴趣之间的复杂交互。为了解决这些问题，在本文中，我们提出了一种新的意图增强的用户兴趣模型，用于大规模电子商务推荐中的点进率预测，简称为 IUI。在方法论上，与现有的作品不同，我们认为用户最近的互动是受到他们的隐含意图的启发，然后利用意图感知网络，以更精确和细粒度的方式建模他们当前的本地兴趣。此外，为了获得更稳定的相互依赖的全局和局部兴趣表示，我们采用了能够激活全局层面相互作用中的相应兴趣并捕获全局和局部层面相互作用行为之间的动态相互作用的共注意网络。最后，将自监督学习算法引入模型训练中，通过最大化两个网络所获得的全局和局部表示之间的互信息来提高 CTR 预测性能。与现有的方法相比，IUI 受益于不同粒度的用户兴趣，以生成更准确和全面的偏好表示。实验结果表明，该模型在三个实际数据集的各种度量指标上优于先前的最新方法。此外，部署在 JD 推荐平台上的在线 A/B 测试显示了跨多个评估指标的有希望的改进。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=IUI:+Intent-Enhanced+User+Interest+Modeling+for+Click-Through+Rate+Prediction)|0|
|[TPUF: Enhancing Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation via Transferring Pre-trained User Features](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615094)|Yujia Ding, Huan Li, Ke Chen, Lidan Shou|Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China|Sequential recommendation has long been challenged by data sparsity issues. Most recently, cross-domain sequential recommendation (CDSR) techniques have been proposed to leverage sequential interaction data from other domains. However, accessing raw data from source domains is often restricted due to privacy concerns. To tackle this issue, we introduce TPUF, a novel CDSR model that transfers pre-trained latent user features from the source domain (UFS) instead of the original interaction data. By doing so, TPUF improves recommendation effectiveness while maintaining practicality. TPUF has three functional characteristics: (1) It is a feature mapping-and-aggregation framework that does not impose specific constraints on the nature of pre-trained UFS. (2) It incorporates a temporal feature mapping unit to effectively extract domain-shared information from UFS with temporal information recovered. (3) It additionally employs an adversarial feature alignment unit to align features across domains to combat feature transfer bias. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that TPUF outperforms other state-of-the-art cross-domain recommendation models and is compatible with multiple UFS types.|长期以来，连续推荐一直受到数据稀疏问题的挑战。最近，跨域顺序推荐(CDSR)技术被提出来利用来自其他域的顺序交互数据。然而，从源域访问原始数据通常由于隐私问题而受到限制。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了 TPUF，一种新的 CDSR 模型，它从源域(UFS)传输预先训练好的潜在用户特征，而不是传输原始的交互数据。通过这样做，TPUF 在保持实用性的同时提高了推荐的有效性。TPUF 具有三个功能特征: (1)它是一个特征映射和聚合框架，不对预先训练的 UFS 的性质施加特定的限制。(2)结合时态特征映射单元，有效地提取 UFS 中的域共享信息，并恢复时态信息。(3)采用对抗性特征对齐单元对特征进行跨域对齐，以对抗特征迁移偏差。在实际数据集上的实验结果表明，TPUF 的性能优于其他最先进的跨域推荐模型，并且可以兼容多种 UFS 类型。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=TPUF:+Enhancing+Cross-domain+Sequential+Recommendation+via+Transferring+Pre-trained+User+Features)|0|

Yu|Salesforce AI Research, Palo Alto, CA, USA; University of Illinois Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA|Existing recommender systems face difficulties with zero-shot items, i.e. items that have no historical interactions with users during the training stage. Though recent works extract universal item representation via pre-trained language models (PLMs), they ignore the crucial item relationships. This paper presents a novel paradigm for the Zero-Shot Item-based Recommendation (ZSIR) task, which pre-trains a model on product knowledge graph (PKG) to refine the item features from PLMs. We identify three challenges for pre-training PKG, which are multi-type relations in PKG, semantic divergence between item generic information and relations and domain discrepancy from PKG to downstream ZSIR task. We address the challenges by proposing four pre-training tasks and novel task-oriented adaptation (ToA) layers. Moreover, this paper discusses how to fine-tune the model on new recommendation task such that the ToA layers are adapted to ZSIR task. Comprehensive experiments on 18 markets dataset are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model in both knowledge prediction and ZSIR task.|现有的推荐系统面临着“零拍摄”项目的困难，也就是说，这些项目在培训阶段与用户没有历史性的交互。近年来的研究虽然通过预训练语言模型(PLM)提取通用项表示，但忽视了关键项之间的关系。提出了一种新的基于零拍项目推荐(ZSIR)任务的实现方法，该方法通过对产品知识图(PKG)模型进行预训练来提取 PLM 中的项目特征。我们确定了 PKG 训练前的三个挑战，即 PKG 中的多类型关系、项目类属信息和关系之间的语义分歧以及从 PKG 到下游 ZSIR 任务之间的领域差异。我们通过提出四个训练前任务和新的面向任务的适应(ToA)层来应对这些挑战。此外，本文还讨论了如何对新推荐任务模型进行微调，使 ToA 层适应 ZSIR 任务。通过对18个市场数据集的综合实验，验证了该模型在知识预测和 ZSIR 任务中的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Zero-shot+Item-based+Recommendation+via+Multi-task+Product+Knowledge+Graph+Pre-Training)|0|

We propose a Generalized Propensity Learning (GPL) framework to directly minimize the bias and variance in CVR prediction models. The proposed method works as a complement to existing methods like IPS, DR, MRDR, and DRMSE to improve prediction performance by reducing their bias and variance.

Existing approaches primarily focus on modeling the correlation between user interests and candidate items. However, we argue that personalized user preferences for candidate items depend not only on correlation but also on the satisfaction of associated interests. To address this limitation, we propose SUIN, a novel CTR model that integrates satisfaction factors into user interest modeling for enhanced click-through rate prediction. Specifically, we employ a user interest satisfaction-aware network to capture the degree of satisfaction for each interest, thereby enabling adaptation of the user's personalized preference based on satisfaction levels. Additionally, we leverage the exposure-unclicked signal (recommended to the user but not clicked) as supervision during training, facilitating the interest satisfaction module to better model the satisfaction degree of user interests. Besides, this module serves as a foundational building block suitable for integration into mainstream sequential-based CTR models. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model, outperforming state-of-the-art methods across various evaluation metrics. Furthermore, an online A/B test deployed on large-scale recommender systems shows significant improvements achieved by our model in diverse evaluation metrics.|在许多工业应用中，包括在线广告和推荐系统中，点进率(ctrl)预测起着关键的作用。现有的方法主要集中在建模用户兴趣和候选项之间的关系。然而，我们认为个性化用户对候选项的偏好不仅取决于相关性，而且还取决于相关兴趣的满意度。为了解决这一局限性，我们提出了 SUIN 模型，这是一种新型的点击率模型，它将满意度因素集成到用户兴趣模型中，以增强点进率预测。具体来说，我们使用一个感知用户兴趣满意度的网络来获取每个兴趣的满意度，从而能够根据满意度来适应用户的个性化偏好。此外，我们利用曝光-未点击信号(推荐给用户但未点击)作为培训期间的监督，促进兴趣满意度模块，以更好地模拟用户兴趣的满意度。此外，该模块作为一个基本的积木块，适合集成到主流的顺序为基础的 CTR 模型。在两个真实世界的数据集上进行的大量实验证明了我们提出的模型的优越性，在各种评估指标上优于最先进的方法。此外，部署在大型推荐系统上的在线 A/B 测试显示，我们的模型在不同的评估指标上取得了显著的改进。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Satisfaction-Aware+User+Interest+Network+for+Click-Through+Rate+Prediction)|0|

Tutar|Amazon, Seattle, WA, USA; Amazon, New York, NY, USA|Identifying similar products in e-commerce is useful in discovering relationships between products, making recommendations, and increasing diversity in search results. Product representation learning is the first step to define a generalized product similarity metric for search. The second step is to extend similarity search to a large scale (e.g., e-commerce catalog scale) without sacrificing quality. In this work, we present a solution that interweaves both steps, i.e., learn representations suited to high quality retrieval using contrastive learning (CL) and retrieve similar items from a large search space using approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) to trade-off quality for speed. We propose a CL training strategy for learning uni-modal encoders suited to multi-modal similarity search for e-commerce. We study ANNS retrieval by generating Pareto Frontiers (PFs) without requiring labels. Our CL training strategy doubles retrieval@1 metric across categories (e.g., from 36% to 88% in category C). We also demonstrate that ANNS engine optimization using PFs help select configurations appropriately (e.g., we achieve 6.8× search speed with just 2% drop from the maximum retrieval accuracy in medium size datasets).|在电子商务中识别类似的产品有助于发现产品之间的关系，提出建议，并增加搜索结果的多样性。产品表示学习是定义用于搜索的广义产品相似度量的第一步。第二步是在不牺牲质量的情况下将最近邻搜索扩展到大规模(例如，电子商务目录规模)。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个解决方案，交织两个步骤，即，学习表示适合高质量的检索使用对比学习(CL)和检索相似的项目从一个大的搜索空间使用近似最近邻搜索(ANNS) ，以权衡质量的速度。我们建议采用 CL 培训策略，学习适用于电子商务多模态最近邻搜索的单模态编码器。我们通过生成不需要标签的帕累托前沿(PF)来研究 ANNS 检索。我们的 CL 训练策略将跨类别的检索@1指标加倍(例如，在 C 类中从36% 增加到88%)。我们还证明了使用 PF 的 ANNS 引擎优化有助于选择适当的配置(例如，我们实现了6.8倍的搜索速度，仅比中等大小数据集的最大检索精度下降2%)。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Unsupervised+Multi-Modal+Representation+Learning+for+High+Quality+Retrieval+of+Similar+Products+at+E-commerce+Scale)|0|
|[Graph Exploration Matters: Improving both Individual-Level and System-Level Diversity in WeChat Feed Recommendation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614688)|Shuai Yang, Lixin Zhang, Feng Xia, Leyu Lin|Tencent Inc., Beijing, China; Tencent Inc., Shenzhen, China|There are roughly three stages in real industrial recommendation systems, candidates generation (retrieval), ranking and reranking. Individual-level diversity and system-level diversity are both important for industrial recommender systems. The former focus on each single user's experience, while the latter focus on the difference among users. Graph-based retrieval strategies are inevitably hijacked by heavy users and popular items, leading to the convergence of candidates for users and the lack of system-level diversity. Meanwhile, in the reranking phase, Determinantal Point Process (DPP) is deployed to increase individual-level diverisity. Heavily relying on the semantic information of items, DPP suffers from clickbait and inaccurate attributes. Besides, most studies only focus on one of the two levels of diversity, and ignore the mutual influence among different stages in real recommender systems. We argue that individual-level diversity and system-level diversity should be viewed as an integrated problem, and we provide an efficient and deployable solution for web-scale recommenders. Generally, we propose to employ the retrieval graph information in diversity-based reranking, by which to weaken the hidden similarity of items exposed to users, and consequently gain more graph explorations to improve the system-level diveristy. Besides, we argue that users' propensity for diversity changes over time in content feed recommendation. Therefore, with the explored graph, we also propose to capture the user's real-time personalized propensity to the diversity. We implement and deploy the combined system in WeChat App's Top Stories used by hundreds of millions of users. Offline simulations and online A/B tests show our solution can effectively improve both user engagement and system revenue.|在实际的行业推荐系统中，大致有三个阶段: 候选人的生成(检索)、排名和重新排名。个体层次的多样性和系统层次的多样性对于工业推荐系统都很重要。前者关注每个用户的体验，而后者关注用户之间的差异。基于图的检索策略不可避免地会受到大量用户和热门项目的劫持，导致用户候选项的收敛和系统级多样性的缺乏。与此同时，在重新排名阶段，行列式点过程(DPP)被用来增加个人层面的多样性。民进党严重依赖项目语义信息，饱受点击率和不准确属性的困扰。此外，大多数研究只关注两个层次中的一个层次的多样性，而忽略了实际推荐系统中不同层次之间的相互影响。我们认为，个人层面的多样性和系统层面的多样性应该被视为一个综合的问题，我们提供了一个有效的和可部署的解决方案，网络规模的推荐。一般来说，我们建议在基于多样性的重新排序中使用检索图信息来削弱暴露给用户的项目的隐藏相似性，从而获得更多的图探索以提高系统级的多样性。此外，我们认为用户的多样性倾向随着时间的推移而变化。因此，通过对图形的研究，我们还提出了捕捉用户对多样性的实时个性化倾向。我们在微信应用程序的热门故事中实现并部署了这个组合系统，被数亿用户使用。离线模拟和在线 A/B 测试表明，我们的解决方案可以有效地提高用户参与度和系统收入。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Graph+Exploration+Matters:+Improving+both+Individual-Level+and+System-Level+Diversity+in+WeChat+Feed+Recommendation)|0|

Recent studies have shown that extreme multi-label classification~(XMC) model enjoys both low inference latency and high recall in real-world scenarios. These XMC semantic matching models adopt TF-IDF vectorizers to extract query text features and use mainly sparse matrices for the model weights. However, limited availability of libraries for efficient parallel sparse modules may lead to tediously long model building time when the problem scales to hundreds of millions of labels. This incurs significant hardware cost and renders the semantic model stale even before it is deployed. In this paper, we investigate and accelerate the model building procedures in a tree-based XMC model.

|[Dual Interests-Aligned Graph Auto-Encoders for Cross-domain Recommendation in WeChat](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614676)|Jiawei Zheng, Hao Gu, Chonggang Song, Dandan Lin, Lingling Yi, Chuan Chen|WeChat, Tencent, Shenzhen, China|Recently, cross-domain recommendation (CDR) has been widely studied in both research and industry since it can alleviate a long-standing challenge of traditional recommendation methods, i.e., data sparsity issue, by transferring the information from a relatively richer domain (termed source domain) to a sparser domain (termed target domain). To our best knowledge, most (if not all) existing CDR methods focus on transferring either the similar content information or the user preferences embedding from the source domain to the target domain. However, they fail to improve the recommendation performance in real-world recommendation scenarios where the items in the source domain are totally different from those in the target domain in terms of attributes. To solve the above issues, we analyzed the historical interactions of users from different domains in the WeChat platform, and found that if two users have similar interests (interactions) in one domain, they are very likely to have similar interests in another domain even though the items of these two domains are totally different in terms of attributes. Based on this observation, in this paper, we propose a novel model named Dual Interests-Aligned Graph Auto-Encoders (DIAGAE) by utilizing the inter-domain interest alignment of users. Besides, our proposed model DIAGAE also leverages graph decoding objectives to align intra-domain user interests, which makes the representation of two users who have similar interests in a single domain closer. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our model DIAGAE outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both public benchmark datasets and online A/B tests in WeChat live-stream recommendation scenario.

This, alongside the rapid news cycle and delayed updates, has led to a challenging news cold-start issue. Likewise, the user cold-start problem, due to limited user engagement, has long hindered recommendations. To tackle both of them, we introduce the Symmetric Few-shot Learning framework for Cold-start News Recommendation (SFCNR), built upon self-supervised contrastive enhancement. Our approach employs symmetric few-shot learning towers (SFTs) to transform warm user/news attributes into their behavior/content features during training. We design two innovative feature alignment strategies to enhance towers training. Subsequently, this tower generates virtual features for cold users/news during inference, leveraging tower-stored prior knowledge through a personalized gating network. We assess the SFCNR on four quality news recommendation models, conducting comprehensive experiments on two kinds of News dataset.

|[Capturing Popularity Trends: A Simplistic Non-Personalized Approach for Enhanced Item Recommendation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614801)|Jiazheng Jing, Yinan Zhang, Xin Zhou, Zhiqi Shen|Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore|Recommender systems have been gaining increasing research attention over the years. Most existing recommendation methods focus on capturing users' personalized preferences through historical user-item interactions, which may potentially violate user privacy. Additionally, these approaches often overlook the significance of the temporal fluctuation in item popularity that can sway users' decision-making. To bridge this gap, we propose Popularity-Aware Recommender (PARE), which makes non-personalized recommendations by predicting the items that will attain the highest popularity. PARE consists of four modules, each focusing on a different aspect: popularity history, temporal impact, periodic impact, and side information. Finally, an attention layer is leveraged to fuse the outputs of four modules. To our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly model item popularity in recommendation systems. Extensive experiments show that PARE performs on par or even better than sophisticated state-of-the-art recommendation methods. Since PARE prioritizes item popularity over personalized user preferences, it can enhance existing recommendation methods as a complementary component. Our experiments demonstrate that integrating PARE with existing recommendation methods significantly surpasses the performance of standalone models, highlighting PARE's potential as a complement to existing recommendation methods. Furthermore, the simplicity of PARE makes it immensely practical for industrial applications and a valuable baseline for future research.|推荐系统近年来得到了越来越多的研究关注。现有的大多数推荐方法都是通过历史的用户-项目交互来获取用户的个性化偏好，这可能会侵犯用户的隐私。此外，这些方法往往忽略了项目流行度的时间波动的重要性，可以影响用户的决策。为了弥补这一差距，我们提出了流行感知推荐(PARE) ，它通过预测将获得最高流行度的项目来提供非个性化的推荐。PARE 由四个模块组成，每个模块关注一个不同的方面: 流行历史、时间影响、周期性影响和侧面信息。最后，利用注意层融合四个模块的输出。据我们所知，这是第一个在推荐系统中对项目流行性进行明确建模的工作。大量的实验表明，价格调整汇率的表现与最先进的复杂推荐方法相当，甚至更好。由于 PARE 优先考虑项目流行度而不是个性化的用户偏好，它可以增强现有的推荐方法作为一个补充组件。我们的实验表明，将价格调整汇率与现有的推荐方法相结合，显著地超过了独立模型的性能，突出了价格调整汇率作为现有推荐方法的补充的潜力。此外，价格调整汇率的简单性使其对工业应用非常实用，并为未来的研究提供了宝贵的基准。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Capturing+Popularity+Trends:+A+Simplistic+Non-Personalized+Approach+for+Enhanced+Item+Recommendation)|0|
|[Multi-domain Recommendation with Embedding Disentangling and Domain Alignment](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614977)|Wentao Ning, Xiao Yan, Weiwen Liu, Reynold Cheng, Rui Zhang, Bo Tang|Huawei Noah's Ark Lab, Shenzhen, China; Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China; The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong; ruizhang.info, Beijing, China|Multi-domain recommendation (MDR) aims to provide recommendations for different domains (e.g., types of products) with overlapping users/items and is common for platforms such as Amazon, Facebook, and LinkedIn that host multiple services. Existing MDR models face two challenges: First, it is difficult to disentangle knowledge that generalizes across domains (e.g., a user likes cheap items) and knowledge specific to a single domain (e.g., a user likes blue clothing but not blue cars). Second, they have limited ability to transfer knowledge across domains with small overlaps. We propose a new MDR method named EDDA with two key components, i.e., embedding disentangling recommender and domain alignment, to tackle the two challenges respectively. In particular, the embedding disentangling recommender separates both the model and embedding for the inter-domain part and the intra-domain part, while most existing MDR methods only focus on model-level disentangling.

|[Dimension Independent Mixup for Hard Negative Sample in Collaborative Filtering](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614845)|Xi Wu, Liangwei Yang, Jibing Gong, Chao Zhou, Tianyu Lin, Xiaolong Liu, Philip S. Yu|University of Illinois Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA; YanShan University, Qinhuangdao, China|Collaborative filtering (CF) is a widely employed technique that predicts user preferences based on past interactions. Negative sampling plays a vital role in training CF-based models with implicit feedback. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective based on the sampling area to revisit existing sampling methods. We point out that current sampling methods mainly focus on Point-wise or Line-wise sampling, lacking flexibility and leaving a significant portion of the hard sampling area un-explored. To address this limitation, we propose Dimension Independent Mixup for Hard Negative Sampling (DINS), which is the first Area-wise sampling method for training CF-based models. DINS comprises three modules: Hard Boundary Definition, Dimension Independent Mixup, and Multi-hop Pooling. Experiments with real-world datasets on both matrix factorization and graph-based models demonstrate that DINS outperforms other negative sampling methods, establishing its effectiveness and superiority. Our work contributes a new perspective, introduces Area-wise sampling, and presents DINS as a novel approach that achieves state-of-the-art performance for negative sampling. Our implementations are available in PyTorch.|协同过滤(CF)是一种广泛应用的技术，它基于过去的交互预测用户偏好。负抽样在基于 CF 的隐式反馈模型的训练中起着至关重要的作用。在本文中，我们提出了一个新的视角基于抽样面积重新审视现有的抽样方法。我们指出，目前的抽样方法主要集中在点或线抽样，缺乏灵活性，并留下了很大一部分硬抽样区域未被探索。针对这一局限性，我们提出了硬负采样的尺寸无关混合(DINS)方法，这是第一种用于训练基于 CF 模型的区域采样方法。DINS 由三个模块组成: 硬边界定义模块、尺寸无关混合模块和多跳池模块。在矩阵分解模型和基于图形的模型上对真实世界数据集进行的实验表明，DINS 优于其他负采样方法，确立了它的有效性和优越性。我们的工作提供了一个新的视角，介绍了区域采样，并提出了 DINS 作为一种新颖的方法，实现了最先进的性能负采样。我们的实现在 PyTorch 中可用。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Dimension+Independent+Mixup+for+Hard+Negative+Sample+in+Collaborative+Filtering)|0|
|[Sequential Recommendation via an Adaptive Cross-domain Knowledge Decomposition](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615058)|Chuang Zhao, Xinyu Li, Ming He, Hongke Zhao, Jianping Fan|College of Management and Economics, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China; AI Lab at Lenovo Research, Beijing, China|Cross-domain recommendation, as an intelligent machine to alleviate data sparsity and cold start problems, has attracted extensive attention from scholars. Existing cross-domain recommendation frameworks usually leverage overlapping entities for knowledge transfer, the most popular of which are information aggregation and consistency maintenance. Despite decent improvements, the neglect of dynamic perspectives, the presence of confounding factors, and the disparities in domain properties inevitably constrain model performance. In view of this, this paper proposes a sequential recommendation framework via adaptive cross-domain knowledge decomposition, namely ARISEN, which focuses on employing adaptive causal learning to improve recommendation performance. Specifically, in order to facilitate sequence transfer, we align the user's behaviour sequences in the source domain and target domain according to the timestamps, expecting to use the abundant semantics of the former to augment the information of the latter. Regarding confounding factor removal, we introduce the causal learning technique and promote it as an adaptive representation decomposition framework on the basis of instrumental variables. For the sake of alleviating the impact of domain disparities, this paper endeavors to employ two mutually orthogonal transformation matrices for information fusion. Extensive experiments and detailed analyzes on large industrial and public data sets demonstrate that our framework can achieve substantial improvements over state-of-the-art algorithms.|跨域推荐作为一种缓解数据稀疏和冷启动问题的智能机器，已经引起了学者们的广泛关注。现有的跨领域推荐框架通常利用重叠实体进行知识转移，其中最流行的是信息聚合和一致性维护。尽管有了不错的改进，但是忽视动态视角、混杂因素的存在以及领域属性的差异不可避免地限制了模型的性能。鉴于此，本文提出了一种基于自适应跨领域知识分解的顺序推荐框架 ARISEN，重点研究了利用自适应因果学习来提高推荐性能的方法。具体来说，为了方便序列传输，我们根据时间戳对源域和目标域中的用户行为序列进行对齐，期望利用前者丰富的语义来增强后者的信息。关于去除混杂因素，我们引入了因果学习技术，并将其推广为一个基于工具变量的自适应表征分解框架。为了减轻领域差异的影响，本文尝试采用两个互正交的变换矩阵进行信息融合。大量的实验和对大型工业和公共数据集的详细分析表明，我们的框架可以比最先进的算法实现实质性的改进。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Sequential+Recommendation+via+an+Adaptive+Cross-domain+Knowledge+Decomposition)|0|

Most traditional unsupervised frequency-based models and many recent supervised neural methods have been designed specifically for predicting the performance of sparse retrievers such as BM25. In this paper we propose an unsupervised QPP method for dense neural retrievers which operates by redefining the well-known concept of query robustness i.e., a more robust query to perturbations is an easier query to handle. We propose to generate query perturbations for measuring query robustness by systematically injecting noise into the contextualized neural representation of each query. We then compare the retrieved list for the original query with that of the perturbed query as a way to measure query robustness.

Many works focus on user behavior modeling to improve CTR prediction performance. However, most of those methods only model users' positive interests from users' click items while ignoring the context information, which is the display items around the clicks, resulting in inferior performance. In this paper, we highlight the importance of context information on user behavior modeling and propose a novel model named Deep Context Interest Network (DCIN), which integrally models the click and its display context to learn users' context-aware interests. DCIN consists of three key modules: 1) Position-aware Context Aggregation Module (PCAM), which performs aggregation of display items with an attention mechanism; 2) Feedback-Context Fusion Module (FCFM), which fuses the representation of clicks and display contexts through non-linear feature interaction; 3) Interest Matching Module (IMM), which activates interests related with the target item. Moreover, we provide our hands-on solution to implement our DCIN model on large-scale industrial systems. The significant improvements in both offline and online evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our proposed DCIN method.

Generally, such semantic relevance models are formulated as text-matching approaches, which measure the relevance between users' search queries and the titles of candidate items (i.e., products). However, we argue that conventional relevance methods may lead to sub-optimal performance due to the limited information provided by the titles of candidate items. To alleviate this issue, we suggest incorporating additional information about candidate items from multiple aspects, including their attributes and images. This could supplement the information that may not be fully provided by titles alone. To this end, we propose a multi-aspect semantic relevance model that takes into account the match between search queries and the title, attribute and image information of items simultaneously. The model is further enhanced through pre-training using several well-designed self-supervised and weakly-supervised tasks. Furthermore, the proposed model is fine-tuned using annotated data and distilled into a representation-based architecture for efficient online deployment.

This fundamentally limits LTR usage in score-sensitive applications.

In this paper, we propose a practical regression compatible ranking (RCR) approach that achieves a better trade-off, where the two ranking and regression components are proved to be mutually aligned. Although the same idea applies to ranking with both binary and graded relevance, we mainly focus on binary labels in this paper. We evaluate the proposed approach on several public LTR benchmarks and show that it consistently achieves either best or competitive result in terms of both regression and ranking metrics, and significantly improves the Pareto frontiers in the context of multi-objective optimization.

By automatically tuning specialized hyperparameters, BOLT also abstracts away the algorithmic details of sparse network training. We evaluate BOLT on a number of information retrieval tasks including product recommendations, text classification, graph neural networks, and personalization. We find that our proposed system achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art techniques at a fraction of the cost and energy consumption and an order-of-magnitude faster inference time.

Query suggestions are a powerful tool to support query formulation and to encourage exploratory search and content discovery. However, classic approaches for query suggestions typically rely either on semantic similarity, which lacks diversity and does not reflect user searching behavior, or on a collaborative similarity measure mined from search logs, which suffers from data sparsity and is biased by highly popular queries.

|[3MN: Three Meta Networks for Multi-Scenario and Multi-Task Learning in Online Advertising Recommender Systems](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614651)|Yifei Zhang, Hua Hua, Hui Guo, Shuangyang Wang, Chongyu Zhong, Shijie Zhang|Interactive Entertainment Group, Tencent, Shenzhen, China|Recommender systems are widely applied on web. For example, online advertising systems rely on recommender systems to accurately estimate the value of display opportunities, which is critical to maximize the profits of advertisers. To reduce computational resource consumption, the core tactic of Multi-Scenario Multi-Task Learning (MSMTL) is to devise a single recommder system that is adapted to all contexts instead of implementing multiple scenario-oriented or task-oriented recommender systems. However, MSMTL is challenging because there are complicated task-task, scenario-scenario, and task-scenario interrelations; the characteristic of different tasks in different scenarios also largely varies; and samples of each context are often unevenly distributed. Previous MSMTL solutions focus on applying scenario knowledge to improve the performance of multi-task learning, while neglecting the complicated interrelations among tasks and scenarios. Moreover, samples derived from different scenarios are transferred into the latent embedding with the same dimension. This static embedding strategy impedes the practicality of model expressiveness, since the scenarios with sufficient samples are underrepresented and those with insufficient samples are over-represented. In this paper, we propose a novel three meta networks-based solution (3MN) to MSMTL that addresses all the limitations discussed above. Specifically, we innovatively bind the meta network with scenario-related input in bottom embedding layer, so that the embedding layer is capable of learning the scenario-related knowledge explicitly. To counteract the imbalanced scenario-related data distributions, our flexible embedding layer adaptively learns the representation of samples.

Moreover, to fully capture the interrelations among scenarios and tasks, we enforce the task and scenario information into the other two meta networks, and transfer the resulted meta-knowledge into the top components (i.e., backbone network and classifier) of the recommender system, respectively.

However, the retrieved passages are not ideal for guiding answer generation because of the discrepancy between retrieval and generation, i.e., the candidate passages are all treated equally during the retrieval procedure without considering their potential to generate the proper answers. This discrepancy makes a passage retriever deliver a sub-optimal collection of candidate passages to generate answers. In this paper, we propose the GeneRative Knowledge Improved Passage Ranking (GripRank) approach, addressing the above challenge by distilling knowledge from a generative passage estimator (GPE) to a passage ranker, where the GPE is a generative language model used to measure how likely the candidate passages can generate the proper answer. We realize the distillation procedure by teaching the passage ranker learning to rank the passages ordered by the GPE. Furthermore, we improve the distillation quality by devising a curriculum knowledge distillation mechanism, which allows the knowledge provided by the GPE can be progressively distilled to the ranker through an easy-to-hard curriculum, enabling the passage ranker to correctly recognize the provenance of the answer from many plausible candidates. We conduct extensive experiments on four datasets across three knowledge-intensive language tasks. Experimental results show advantages over the state-of-the-art methods for both passage ranking and answer generation on the KILT benchmark.|检索增强型文本生成的目的是利用从大型文章语料库中检索到的段落来提供输入查询的正确答案，在开放领域问题回答和知识增强型对话生成等知识密集型语言任务方面取得了显著进展。然而，由于检索和生成之间的差异，被检索的段落并不是指导生成答案的理想选择，也就是说，候选段落在检索过程中都被平等对待，而没有考虑它们生成正确答案的潜力。这种差异使得文章检索器提供一个次优的候选文章集合来生成答案。在本文中，我们提出了生成知识改进通道排名(GripRank)方法，通过从生成通道估计(GPE)中提取知识到一个通道排名，其中 GPE 是一个生成语言模型，用于衡量候选通道产生正确答案的可能性，从而解决上述挑战。通过教导通道排序器学习对 GPE 排序的通道进行排序，实现了蒸馏过程。此外，我们通过设计一个课程知识蒸馏机制来提高蒸馏质量，该机制允许 GPE 提供的知识可以通过一个容易到难的课程逐步蒸馏到排名，使得通过排名能够正确地识别来自许多合理候选人的答案的来源。我们在三个知识密集型语言任务的四个数据集上进行了广泛的实验。实验结果表明，在 KILT 基准的文章排序和答案生成方面，该方法比目前最先进的方法具有更大的优势。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=GripRank:+Bridging+the+Gap+between+Retrieval+and+Generation+via+the+Generative+Knowledge+Improved+Passage+Ranking)|0|

We propose a novel method for conversational passage response retrieval (ConvPR) for long conversations in domains with mixed levels of expertise. Conversational legal search is challenging because the domain includes long, multi-participant dialogues with domain-specific language. Furthermore, as opposed to other domains, there typically is a large knowledge gap between the questioner (a layperson) and the responders (lawyers), participating in the same conversation. We collect and release a large-scale real-world dataset called LegalConv with nearly one million legal conversations from a legal community question answering (CQA) platform. We address the particular challenges of processing legal conversations, with our novel Conversational Legal Longformer with Expertise-Aware Response Ranker, called CLosER. The proposed method has two main innovations compared to state-of-the-art methods for ConvPR: (i) Expertise-Aware Post-Training; a learning objective that takes into account the knowledge gap difference between participants to the conversation; and (ii) a simple but effective strategy for re-ordering the context utterances in long conversations to overcome the limitations of the sparse attention mechanism of the Longformer architecture. Evaluation on LegalConv shows that our proposed method substantially and significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on the response selection task. Our analysis indicates that our Expertise-Aware PostTraining, i.e., continued pre-training or domain/task adaptation, plays an important role in the achieved effectiveness. Our proposed method is generalizable to other tasks with domain-specific challenges and can facilitate future research on conversational search in other domains.|本文研究了会话法律搜索中的回答排序问题。本文提出了一种基于混合专业知识水平的会话通道反应检索方法。对话式法律搜索具有挑战性，因为该领域包括与领域特定语言的长时间、多参与者对话。此外，与其他领域不同，提问者(外行)和回答者(律师)参与同一对话时，通常存在很大的知识差距。我们收集并发布了一个名为 LegalConv 的大规模现实世界数据集，其中包括来自法律社区问答(cQA)平台的近一百万个法律对话。我们解决处理法律对话的特殊挑战，我们的新颖的对话法律长期与专家意识的响应排名，所谓的关闭。与目前最先进的 ConvPR 方法相比，提出的方法有两个主要创新: (i)专业知识意识的后期培训; 一个考虑到会话参与者之间的知识差异的学习目标; 和(ii)一个简单但有效的策略来重新排序长时间会话中的上下文语句，以克服 Longform 架构的稀疏注意机制的局限性。对 LegalConv 的评估表明，我们提出的方法在响应选择任务上大大优于现有的最先进的模型。我们的分析表明，我们的专业意识后期培训，即持续的培训前或领域/任务适应，在实现有效性方面发挥了重要作用。我们提出的方法可推广到其他具有领域特定挑战的任务，并可促进未来其他领域的会话搜索研究。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=CLosER:+Conversational+Legal+Longformer+with+Expertise-Aware+Passage+Response+Ranker+for+Long+Contexts)|0|

Recently, significant progress has been made in sequential recommendation with deep learning. However, existing neural sequential recommender often suffer from the data sparsity issue in real-world applications. To tackle this problem, we propose a Multi-Modal Mixture of experts model for Sequential Recommendation, named M3SRec, which leverage rich multi-modal interaction data for improving sequential recommendation.

Firstly, we design a novel multi-modal mixture-of-experts (MoE) fusion network, which can deeply fuse the across-modal semantics and largely enhance the modeling capacity of complex user intents. For training, we design specific pre-training tasks that can mimic the goal of the recommendation, which help model learn the semantic relatedness between the multi-modal sequential context and the target item.

|[Adaptive Multi-Modalities Fusion in Sequential Recommendation Systems](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614775)|Hengchang Hu, Wei Guo, Yong Liu, MinYen Kan|National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; Huawei Noah's Ark Lab, Singapore, Singapore|In sequential recommendation, multi-modal information (e.g., text or image) can provide a more comprehensive view of an item's profile. The optimal stage (early or late) to fuse modality features into item representations is still debated. We propose a graph-based approach (named MMSR) to fuse modality features in an adaptive order, enabling each modality to prioritize either its inherent sequential nature or its interplay with other modalities. MMSR represents each user's history as a graph, where the modality features of each item in a user's history sequence are denoted by cross-linked nodes. The edges between homogeneous nodes represent intra-modality sequential relationships, and the ones between heterogeneous nodes represent inter-modality interdependence relationships. During graph propagation, MMSR incorporates dual attention, differentiating homogeneous and heterogeneous neighbors. To adaptively assign nodes with distinct fusion orders, MMSR allows each node's representation to be asynchronously updated through an update gate. In scenarios where modalities exhibit stronger sequential relationships, the update gate prioritizes updates among homogeneous nodes. Conversely, when the interdependent relationships between modalities are more pronounced, the update gate prioritizes updates among heterogeneous nodes. Consequently, MMSR establishes a fusion order that spans a spectrum from early to late modality fusion. In experiments across six datasets, MMSR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models, and our graph propagation methods surpass other graph neural networks. Additionally, MMSR naturally manages missing modalities.|在顺序推荐中，多模态信息(例如文本或图像)可以提供一个更全面的项目配置文件视图。最佳阶段(早期或晚期)融合情态特征的项目表示仍然存在争议。我们提出了一种基于图的方法(命名为 MMSR) ，以自适应的顺序融合模态特征，使每个模态优先考虑其固有的顺序性质或其与其他模态的相互作用。MMSR 将每个用户的历史表示为一个图，其中用户历史序列中每个项目的模态特征由交叉链接的节点表示。同质节点之间的边表示模态内部的顺序关系，异质节点之间的边表示模态间的相互依赖关系。在图的传播过程中，MMSR 融合了双重注意，区分了同质和异质邻居。为了自适应地分配具有不同融合顺序的节点，MMSR 允许通过更新门异步更新每个节点的表示。在模式表现出更强的顺序关系的场景中，更新门优先更新同质节点。相反，当模式之间的相互依赖关系更加明显时，更新门优先考虑异构节点之间的更新。因此，MMSR 建立了一个从早期到晚期的融合序列。在跨六个数据集的实验中，MMSR 始终优于最先进的模型，我们的图传播方法优于其他图神经网络。此外，MMSR 自然会管理缺失的模式。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Adaptive+Multi-Modalities+Fusion+in+Sequential+Recommendation+Systems)|0|

Recently, Transformer and convolution neural network (CNNs) have shown great success in learning representations for SR. Nevertheless, Transformer mainly focus on capturing content-based global interactions, while CNNs effectively exploit local features in practical recommendation scenarios. Thus, how to effectively aggregate CNNs and Transformer to model both local and global dependencies of historical item sequence still remains an open challenge and is rarely studied in SR. To this regard, we inject locality inductive bias into Transformer by combining its global attention mechanism with a local convolutional filter, and adaptively determine the mixing importance on a personalized basis through a module- and layer-aware adaptive mixture units, named AdaMCT. Moreover, considering that softmax-based attention may encourage unimodal activation, we introduce the Squeeze-Excitation Attention (with sigmoid activation) into sequential recommendation to capture multiple relevant items (keys) simultaneously. Extensive experiments on three widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that AdaMCT significantly outperforms the previous Transformer and CNNs based models by an average of 18.46% and 60.85% respectively in terms of NDCG@5 and achieves state-of-the-art performance.|序贯推荐(SR)的目的是根据用户的历史交互对其动态偏好进行建模。近年来，变压器和卷积神经网络(CNN)在 SR 的学习表征方面取得了很大的成功。尽管如此，Transformer 主要关注于捕获基于内容的全局交互，而 CNN 在实际推荐场景中有效地利用了局部特征。因此，如何有效地聚合 CNN 和 Transformer 来模拟历史项目序列的局部和全局依赖关系仍然是一个开放的挑战，在 SR 中很少进行研究。为此，我们将变压器的全局注意机制与局部卷积滤波器相结合，将局部感应偏差注入变压器，并通过模块和层感知自适应混合单元 AdaMCT 自适应地确定混合重要性。此外，考虑到基于 softmax 的注意力可能会鼓励单峰激活，我们将挤压-兴奋注意力(具有乙状结肠激活)引入顺序推荐，以同时捕获多个相关项目(键)。在三个广泛使用的基准数据集上进行的大量实验表明，AdaMCT 在 NDCG@5方面的性能显著优于以前基于 former 和 CNN 的模型，平均分别为18.46% 和60.85% ，并且达到了最先进的性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=AdaMCT:+Adaptive+Mixture+of+CNN-Transformer+for+Sequential+Recommendation)|0|

However, the existing model retrieval methods have inadequate performance and efficiency, since they focus on matching user requirements with the model names, and thus cannot work well for high-dimensional data such as images. In this paper, we propose a user-task-centric multimodal model retrieval method named AutoMRM. AutoMRM can retrieve DNN models suitable for the user's task according to both the dataset and description of the task. Moreover, AutoMRM utilizes meta-learning to retrieve models for previously unseen task queries.

To address these limitations, this paper presents AutoSeqRec, an incremental recommendation model specifically designed for sequential recommendation tasks.

In addition, the rows and columns of the item transition matrix represent the item out-degree and in-degree hopping behavior, which allows for modeling the user's short-term interests. When making incremental recommendations, only the input matrices need to be updated, without the need to update parameters, which makes AutoSeqRec very efficient.

For instance, the widely used A* algorithms explore the entire search space to find the optimal solution which inevitably suffers scalability issues. Learning-based methods apply graph representation techniques to learn the GED by formulating a regression task, which can not recover the edit path and lead to inaccurate GED approximation (i.e., the predicted GED is smaller than the exact). To this end, in this work, we present a data-driven hybrid approach MATA* for approximate GED computation based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and A* algorithms, which models from the perspective of learning to match nodes instead of directly regressing GED. Specifically, aware of the structure-dominant operations (i.e., node and edge insertion/deletion) property in GED computation, a structure-enhanced GNN is firstly designed to jointly learn local and high-order structural information for node embeddings for node matchings. Second, top-k candidate nodes are produced via a differentiable top-k operation to enable the training for node matchings, which is adhering to another property of GED, i.e., multiple optimal node matchings. Third, benefiting from the candidate nodes, MATA* only performs on the promising search directions, reaching the solution efficiently.

Existing works have shown that conversational search paradigm can improve users' search experience in legal case retrieval. One of the keys to a practical conversational search system is how to ask high-quality clarifying questions to initiate conversations with users and understand their search intents. Recently, Large Language Models, such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, have shown superior ability in both open-domain QA and conversations with human. Thus it is natural to believe that they could be applied to legal conversational search as well. However, our preliminary study has shown that generating clarifying questions in legal conversational search with SOTA LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) often suffers from several problems such as duplication and low-utility contents. To address these problems, we propose LeClari, which leverages legal event schema as external knowledge to instruct LLMs to generate effective clarifying questions for legal conversational search. LeClari is constructed with a prompt module and a novel legal event selection module. The former defines a prompt with legal events for clarifying question generation and the latter selects potential event types by modeling the relationships of legal event types, conversational context, and candidate cases. We also propose ranking-oriented rewards and employ the reward augmented maximum likelihood (RAML) method to optimize LeClari directly based on the final retrieval performance of the conversational legal search system. Empirical results over two widely adopted legal case retrieval datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach as compared with the state-of-the-art baselines.|法律案例检索是一项特殊的信息检索任务，旨在为给定的查询案例检索支持案例。已有的研究表明，会话搜索范式可以提高用户在法律案件检索中的搜索体验。实际会话搜索系统的关键问题之一是如何提出高质量的澄清性问题来启动与用户的对话并理解他们的搜索意图。最近，大型语言模型，如 ChatGPT 和 GPT-4，在开放领域的 QA 和与人类的对话方面表现出了卓越的能力。因此，很自然地认为，它们也可以应用于合法的会话搜索。然而，我们的初步研究表明，在使用 SOTA LLM (例如，GPT-4)进行法律会话搜索时，产生澄清问题常常会遇到重复和低效用内容等问题。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了 LeClari，它利用法律事件模式作为外部知识，指导 LLM 为法律会话搜索生成有效的澄清问题。LeClari 由一个提示模块和一个新的法律事件选择模块构成。前者定义了一个带有法律事件的提示符，用于说明问题的产生，后者通过建模法律事件类型、会话语境和候选案例之间的关系来选择潜在的事件类型。我们还提出了面向排序的奖励方法，并利用奖励增加的最大似然(RAML)方法直接根据会话法律搜索系统的最终检索性能对 LeClari 进行优化。通过两个广泛采用的法律案例检索数据集的实证结果表明，与最先进的基线相比，我们的方法是有效的。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Leveraging+Event+Schema+to+Ask+Clarifying+Questions+for+Conversational+Legal+Case+Retrieval)|0|

However, sequential recommendation often faces the problem of data sparsity, which widely exists in recommender systems. Besides, most users only interact with a few items, but existing SRS models often underperform these users. Such a problem, named the long-tail user problem, is still to be resolved. Data augmentation is a distinct way to alleviate these two problems, but they often need fabricated training strategies or are hindered by poor-quality generated interactions. To address these problems, we propose a Diffusion Augmentation for Sequential Recommendation (DiffuASR) for a higher quality generation. The augmented dataset by DiffuASR can be used to train the sequential recommendation models directly, free from complex training procedures. To make the best of the generation ability of the diffusion model, we first propose a diffusion-based pseudo sequence generation framework to fill the gap between image and sequence generation. Then, a sequential U-Net is designed to adapt the diffusion noise prediction model U-Net to the discrete sequence generation task. At last, we develop two guide strategies to assimilate the preference between generated and origin sequences. To validate the proposed DiffuASR, we conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets with three sequential recommendation models. The experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of DiffuASR. As far as we know, DiffuASR is one pioneer that introduce the diffusion model to the recommendation.|序贯推荐(SRS)已经成为许多应用程序的技术基础，其目的是根据用户的历史交互情况推荐下一个项目。然而，在推荐系统中，顺序推荐常常面临数据稀疏的问题。此外，大多数用户只与少数几个项目交互，但现有的 SRS 模型往往表现不佳。这样一个被称为长尾用户问题的问题仍有待解决。数据增强是缓解这两个问题的一种独特方式，但它们往往需要编造的培训策略，或者受到低质量生成的交互作用的阻碍。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种扩散增强的序列推荐(区分 ASR)为更高的质量生成。区分扩展数据集可以直接用于训练序列推荐模型，避免了复杂的训练过程。为了充分利用扩散模型的生成能力，我们首先提出了一种基于扩散的伪序列生成框架，以填补图像和序列生成之间的空白。然后，设计了一个序列 U-Net，使扩散噪声预测模型 U-Net 适应离散序列生成任务。最后，我们提出了两种引导策略来同化生成序列和起源序列之间的偏好。为了验证所提出的 DISUASR，我们使用三个连续的推荐模型在三个真实世界的数据集上进行了广泛的实验。实验结果表明了该方法的有效性。据我们所知，DISUASR 是将扩散模型引入推荐系统的先驱者之一。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Diffusion+Augmentation+for+Sequential+Recommendation)|0|
|[Deep Task-specific Bottom Representation Network for Multi-Task Recommendation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614837)|Qi Liu, Zhilong Zhou, Gangwei Jiang, Tiezheng Ge, Defu Lian|University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China; Alibaba Group, Beijing, China|Neural-based multi-task learning (MTL) has gained significant improvement, and it has been successfully applied to recommendation system (RS). Recent deep MTL methods for RS (e.g. MMoE, PLE) focus on designing soft gating-based parameter-sharing networks that implicitly learn a generalized representation for each task. However, MTL methods may suffer from performance degeneration when dealing with conflicting tasks, as negative transfer effects can occur on the task-shared bottom representation. This can result in a reduced capacity for MTL methods to capture task-specific characteristics, ultimately impeding their effectiveness and hindering the ability to generalize well on all tasks. In this paper, we focus on the bottom representation learning of MTL in RS and propose the Deep Task-specific Bottom Representation Network (DTRN) to alleviate the negative transfer problem. DTRN obtains task-specific bottom representation explicitly by making each task has its own representation learning network in the bottom representation modeling stage. Specifically, it extracts the user's interests from multiple types of behavior sequences for each task through the parameter-efficient hypernetwork. To further obtain the dedicated representation for each task, DTRN refines the representation of each feature by employing a SENet-like network for each task. The two proposed modules can achieve the purpose of getting task-specific bottom representation to relieve tasks' mutual interference. Moreover, the proposed DTRN is flexible to combine with existing MTL methods. Experiments on one public dataset and one industrial dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DTRN. Furthermore, we deploy DTRN in an industrial recommender system and gain remarkable improvements in multiple tasks.|基于神经网络的多任务学习(MTL)已经取得了显著的进步，并已成功地应用于推荐系统(RS)。最近的 RS 深层 MTL 方法(例如 MMoE，PLE)主要集中在设计基于软门控的参数共享网络，这种网络隐式地学习每个任务的通用表示。然而，MTL 方法在处理相互冲突的任务时可能会出现性能退化，因为任务共享的底层表示可能会受到负迁移效应的影响。这可能导致 MTL 方法捕获特定任务特征的能力下降，最终妨碍其有效性，并阻碍在所有任务中良好推广的能力。本文针对 RS 中 MTL 的底层表示学习问题，提出了基于深层任务的底层表示网络(DTRN)来解决负迁移问题。DTRN 通过在底层表示建模阶段使每个任务都有自己的表示学习网络，明确地获得任务特定的底层表示。具体来说，它通过参数有效的超网络从每个任务的多种类型的行为序列中提取用户的兴趣。为了进一步获得每个任务的专用表示，DTRN 通过为每个任务使用类似 SENet 的网络来改进每个特性的表示。这两个模块可以实现任务特定的底部表示，减少任务间的相互干扰。此外，提出的 DTRN 是灵活的结合现有的 MTL 方法。在一个公共数据集和一个工业数据集上的实验表明了所提出的 DTRN 方法的有效性。此外，我们在工业推荐系统部署 DTRN，并在多项任务中取得显著改进。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Deep+Task-specific+Bottom+Representation+Network+for+Multi-Task+Recommendation)|0|
|[Post-hoc Selection of Pareto-Optimal Solutions in Search and Recommendation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615010)|Vincenzo Paparella, Vito Walter Anelli, Franco Maria Nardini, Raffaele Perego, Tommaso Di Noia|ISTI-CNR, Pisa, Italy; Politecnico di Bari, Bari, Italy|Information Retrieval (IR) and Recommender Systems (RS) tasks are moving from computing a ranking of final results based on a single metric to multi-objective problems. Solving these problems leads to a set of Pareto-optimal solutions, known as Pareto frontier, in which no objective can be further improved without hurting the others. In principle, all the points on the Pareto frontier are potential candidates to represent the best model selected with respect to the combination of two, or more, metrics. To our knowledge, there are no well-recognized strategies to decide which point should be selected on the frontier. In this paper, we propose a novel, post-hoc, theoretically-justified technique, named "Population Distance from Utopia" (PDU), to identify and select the one-best Pareto-optimal solution from the frontier. In detail, PDU analyzes the distribution of the points by investigating how far each point is from its utopia point (the ideal performance for the objectives). The possibility of considering fine-grained utopia points allows PDU to select solutions tailored to individual user preferences, a novel feature we call "calibration". We compare PDU against existing state-of-the-art strategies through extensive experiments on tasks from both IR and RS. Experimental results show that PDU and combined with calibration notably impact the solution selection. Furthermore, the results show that the proposed framework selects a solution in a principled way, irrespective of its position on the frontier, thus overcoming the limits of other strategies.|信息检索(IR)和推荐系统(RS)任务正在从计算基于单一指标的最终结果排序过渡到多目标问题。解决这些问题导致一组帕累托最优解，称为帕累托边界，其中没有一个目标可以进一步改进而不损害其他目标。原则上，Pareto 前沿上的所有点都是潜在的候选者，可以代表就两个或更多指标的组合而选择的最佳模型。据我们所知，没有公认的战略来决定哪一点应该选择在前沿。本文提出了一种新的、事后的、理论证明的技术，称为“距离乌托邦的人口距离”(PDU) ，从前沿中识别和选择一个最佳的帕累托最优解。具体来说，PDU 通过调查每个点离它的乌托邦点(目标的理想性能)有多远来分析这些点的分布。考虑细粒度乌托邦点的可能性允许 PDU 选择适合个人用户偏好的解决方案，这个新特性我们称之为“校准”。通过对 IR 和 RS 任务的大量实验，我们比较了 PDU 和现有的最新策略。实验结果表明，PDU 和标定相结合对解决方案的选择有显著影响。此外，结果表明，所提出的框架以原则性的方式选择解决方案，而不考虑其在前沿的位置，从而克服了其他战略的局限性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Post-hoc+Selection+of+Pareto-Optimal+Solutions+in+Search+and+Recommendation)|0|

Existing OTPs focus on improving platform revenue. In this work, we take a first step in incorporating hotel merchants' objectives into the design of hotel S&R systems to achieve an incentive loop: the OTP tilts impressions and better-ranked positions to merchants with high service quality, and in return, the merchants provide better service to consumers. Three critical design challenges need to be resolved to achieve this incentive loop: Matthew Effect in the consumer feedback-loop, unclear relation between hotel service quality and performance, and conflicts between platform revenue and consumer experience. To address these challenges, we propose MERIT, a MERchant InceTive ranking model, which can simultaneously take the interests of merchants and consumers into account. We introduce information about the hotel service quality at the input-output level. At the input level, we incorporate factors of hotel service quality as features (as the underlying reasons for service quality), while at the output level, we introduce the metric Hotel Rating Score (HRS) as a label (as the evaluated outcome of service quality). Also, we design a monotonic structure for Merchant Tower to provide a clear relation between hotel quality and performance. Finally, we propose a Multi-objective Stratified Pairwise Loss, which can mitigate the conflicts between OTP's revenue and consumer experience. To demonstrate the effectiveness of MERIT, we compare our method with several state-of-the-art benchmarks. The offline experiment results indicate that MERIT outperforms these methods in optimizing the demands of consumers and merchants. Furthermore, we conduct an online A/B test and obtain an improvement of 3.02% for the HRS score. Based on these results, we have deployed MERIT online on Fliggy, one of the most popular OTPs in China, to serve tens of millions of consumers and hundreds of thousands of hotel merchants.

To model repeat consumption, the repeat-aware recommendation has been proposed to predict which item will be re-interacted based on the user-item interactions. In this paper, we investigate various inherent characteristics to enhance the performance of repeat-aware recommendation. Specifically, we explore these characteristics from two aspects: one is from the temporal aspect where we consider the time interval relationship in user behavior sequence; the other is from the sequential aspect where we consider the sequential-level relationship. Our intuition is that both thetemporal pattern andsequential pattern reflect users' intentions of repeat consumption. By utilizing these two patterns, a novel model called Temporal and Sequential repeat-aware Recommendation(TSRec for short) is proposed to enhance repeat-aware recommendation. TSRec has three main components: 1) User-specific Temporal Representation Module (UTRM), which encodes and extracts user historical repeat temporal information. 2) Item-specific Temporal Representation Module (ITRM), which incorporates item time interval information as side information to alleviate the data sparsity problem of user repeat behavior sequence. 3) Sequential Repeat-Aware Module (SRAM), which represents the similarity between user's current and the last repeat sequences. Extensive experimental results on three public benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of TSRec over state-of-the-art methods.

Although these methods are known to besuperior to the single-vector ones (i.e., providing asingle latent vector per node), wepoint out their three drawbacks as inability to preserve asymmetry on NU-paths, inability to preserve global nodes similarity, and impairing in/out-degree distributions. To address these, we first proposeCRW, anovel similarity measure for graphs that considers contributions ofboth in-links and out-links in similarity computation,without ignoring their directions. Then, we proposeELTRA, aneffective double-vector embedding method to preserve asymmetric information in directed graphs. ELTRA computesasymmetry preserving proximity scores (AP-scores) by employing CRW in which the contribution of out-links and in-links in similarity computation isupgraded anddowngraded, respectively. Then, for every node u, ELTRA selects its top-tclosest nodes based on AP-scores andconforms theranks of their corresponding target vectors w.r.t u's source vector in the embedding space to theiroriginal ranks. Our extensive experimental results withseven real-world datasets andsixteen embedding methods show that (1) CRWsignificantly outperforms Katz and RWR in computing nodes similarity in graphs, (2) ELTRAoutperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods in graph reconstruction, link prediction, and node classification tasks.|双向量嵌入方法首先捕获有向图中的不对称信息，然后通过每个节点提供源和目标两个潜在向量，将不对称信息保存在嵌入空间中。尽管这些方法已知优于单向量方法(即每个节点提供单个潜在向量) ，但我们指出了它们的三个缺点，即无法在 NU 路径上保持不对称性，无法保持全局节点相似性，以及损害/外度分布。为了解决这些问题，我们首先提出了 CRW，一种新的图的相似性度量，它考虑了相似性计算中的内链接和外链接的贡献，而没有忽略它们的方向。然后，我们提出了 ELTRA，一种有效的双向量嵌入方法来保持有向图中的不对称信息。ELTRA 通过使用 CRW 计算保持不对称性的邻近分数(AP 分数) ，其中外链和内链在相似性计算中的贡献分别被升级和降级。然后，对于每个节点 u，ELTRA 根据 AP 得分选择其最接近的节点，并将嵌入空间中相应的目标向量的排序与原始排序相一致。我们对7个实际数据集和16种嵌入方法的广泛实验结果表明: (1) CRW 在计算图中节点相似度方面明显优于 Katz 和 RWR; (2) ELTRAB 在图重构、链接预测和节点分类任务方面优于现有的最先进的方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=ELTRA:+An+Embedding+Method+based+on+Learning-to-Rank+to+Preserve+Asymmetric+Information+in+Directed+Graphs)|0|

However, most existing contrastive sequential recommender systems simply emphasize the overall information of interaction sequences, thereby neglecting the special periodic patterns of user behavior. In this study, we propose that users exhibit emanative periodicity towards a group of correlated items, i.e., user behavior follow a certain periodic pattern while their interests may shift from one item to other related items over time. In light of this observation, we present a hierarchical contrastive learning framework to model EmAnative periodicity for SEquential Recommendation (referred to as EASE). Specifically, we design dual-channel contrastive strategy from the perspective of correlation and periodicity to capture emanative periodic patterns. Furthermore, we extend the traditional binary contrastive loss with hierarchical constraint to handle hierarchical contrastive samples, thus preserving the inherent hierarchical information of correlation and periodicity. Comprehensive experiments conducted on five datasets substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed EASE in improving sequential recommendation.|目前，对比自监督学习已广泛应用于顺序推荐系统中。然而，现有的对比序列推荐系统大多只强调交互序列的整体信息，而忽视了用户行为的特殊周期模式。在本研究中，我们提出使用者对一组相关项目表现出发射周期性，即使用者的兴趣可能随时间由一个项目转移至其他相关项目，使用者的行为仍遵循一定的周期性模式。根据这一观察，我们提出了一个层次对比学习框架来模拟顺序推荐的 EmAnative 周期性(简称 EASE)。具体来说，我们从相关性和周期性的角度设计了双通道对比策略来捕捉发射周期图案。在此基础上，将传统的具有层次约束的二进制对比度损失算法扩展到层次对比度样本的处理，从而保留了相关性和周期性的固有层次信息。在五个数据集上进行的综合实验证实了我们提出的 EASE 在改进顺序推荐方面的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Periodicity+May+Be+Emanative:+Hierarchical+Contrastive+Learning+for+Sequential+Recommendation)|0|

In the past years, many efforts have been devoted to optimizing the diversity in the matching stage and the re-ranking stage of the recommendation system, but few in the ranking stage. The ranking stage is the intermediate stage of the recommendation system. Improving the diversity of the ranking stage can preserve the diversity of the matching stage, and provide a more diversified list for the re-ranking stage.

Recently, some methods propose to adopt the sentiment signals of reviews to enhance the review summarization. However, most previous works only share the semantic features of reviews via preliminary multi-task learning, while ignoring the rich personalized information of users and products, which is crucial to both sentiment identification and comprehensive review summarization. In this paper, we propose a sentiment-aware review summarization method with an elaborately designed multi-task fine-tuning framework to make full use of personalized information of users and products effectively based on Pretrained Language Models (PLMs). We first denote two types of personalized information including IDs and historical summaries to indicate their identification and semantics information respectively. Subsequently, we propose to incorporate the IDs of the user/product into the PLMs-based encoder to learn the personalized representations of input reviews and their historical summaries in a fine-tuning way. Based on this, an auxiliary context-aware review sentiment classification task and a further sentiment-guided personalized review summarization task are jointly learned. Specifically, the sentiment representation of input review is used to identify relevant historical summaries, which are then treated as additional semantic context features to enhance the summary generation process. Extensive experimental results show our approach could generate sentiment-consistent summaries and outperforms many competitive baselines on both review summarization and sentiment classification tasks.|在推荐系统中，个性化的评论摘要是一项具有挑战性的任务，它的目标是为产品评论生成简明易读的摘要。近年来，一些方法提出采用评论的情感信号来加强评论总结。然而，以往的研究大多只是通过初步的多任务学习来共享评论的语义特征，而忽略了用户和产品丰富的个性化信息，这对于情感识别和综合评论总结都是至关重要的。本文提出了一种基于预训练语言模型的情感感知评论摘要方法，该方法通过精心设计的多任务微调框架，有效地利用了用户和产品的个性化信息。我们首先表示两种类型的个性化信息，包括 ID 和历史汇总，分别表示它们的识别和语义信息。随后，我们建议将用户/产品的 ID 合并到基于 PLM 的编码器中，以微调的方式学习输入评论及其历史摘要的个性化表示。在此基础上，共同学习了一个辅助上下文感知的评论情感分类任务和一个进一步的情感引导的个性化评论摘要任务。具体来说，输入评论的情感表示被用来识别相关的历史摘要，然后将其作为额外的语义上下文特征来加强摘要的生成过程。广泛的实验结果表明，我们的方法可以产生情绪一致的摘要，并优于许多竞争基线审查摘要和情绪分类任务。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Sentiment-aware+Review+Summarization+with+Personalized+Multi-task+Fine-tuning)|0|
|[A Two-tier Shared Embedding Method for Review-based Recommender Systems](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614770)|Zhen Yang, Junrui Liu, Tong Li, Di Wu, Shiqiu Yang, Huan Liu|Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China; Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA|Reviews are valuable resources that have been widely researched and used to improve the quality of recommendation services. Recent methods use multiple full embedding layers to model various levels of individual preferences, increasing the risk of the data sparsity issue. Although it is a potential way to deal with this issue that models homophily among users who have similar behaviors, the existing approaches are implemented in a coarse-grained way. They calculate user similarities by considering the homophily in their global behaviors but ignore their local behaviors under a specific context. In this paper, we propose a two-tier shared embedding model (TSE), which fuses coarse- and fine-grained ways of modeling homophily. It considers global behaviors to model homophily in a coarse-grained way, and the high-level feature in the process of each user-item interaction to model homophily in a fine-grained way. TSE designs a whole-to-part principle-based process to fuse these ways in the review-based recommendation. Experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate that TSE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models. It outperforms the best baseline by 20.50% on the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and 23.96% on the mean absolute error (MAE), respectively.

|[Improving Query Correction Using Pre-train Language Model In Search Engines](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614930)|Dezhi Ye, Bowen Tian, Jiabin Fan, Jie Liu, Tianhua Zhou, Xiang Chen, Mingming Li, Jin Ma|Tencent, Beijing, China|Query correction is a task that automatically detects and corrects errors in what users type into a search engine. Misspelled queries can lead to user dissatisfaction and churn. However, correcting a user query accurately is not an easy task. One major challenge is that a correction model must be capable of high-level language comprehension. Recently, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been successfully applied to text correction tasks, but few works have been done on query correction. However, it is nontrivial to directly apply these PLMs to query correction in large-scale search systems due to the following challenging issues: 1) Expensive deployment. Deploying such a model requires expensive computations. 2) Lacking domain knowledge. A neural correction model needs massive training data to activate its power. To this end, we introduce KSTEM, a Knowledge-based Sequence To Edit Model for Chinese query correction. KSTEM transforms the sequence generation task into sequence tagging by mapping errors into five categories: KEEP, REPLACE, SWAP, DELETE, and INSERT, reducing computational complexity. Additionally, KSTEM adopts 2D position encoding, which is composed of the internal and external order of the words. Meanwhile, to compensate for the lack of domain knowledge, we propose a task-specific training paradigm for query correction, including edit strategy-based pre-training, user click-based post pre-train, and human label-based fine-tuning. Finally, we apply KSTEM to the industrial search system. Extensive offline and online experiments show that KSTEM significantly improves query correction performance. We hope that our experience will benefit frontier researchers.|查询纠正是一项自动检测和纠正用户在搜索引擎中输入的错误的任务。拼写错误的查询可能导致用户不满意和混乱。然而，准确地纠正用户查询并非易事。一个主要的挑战是，纠错模式必须能够高水平的语言理解。近年来，预训练语言模型(PLM)已经成功地应用于文本校正任务中，但在查询校正方面的研究还很少。然而，由于以下挑战性问题，直接应用这些 PLM 在大规模搜索系统中进行查询更正并非易事: 1)昂贵的部署。部署这样的模型需要昂贵的计算。2)缺乏领域知识。神经校正模型需要大量的训练数据来激活它的能量。为此，本文介绍了基于知识的汉语查询纠错序列编辑模型 KSTEM。KSTEM 通过将错误映射到 KEEP、 REPLACE、 SWAP、 DELETE 和 INSERT 五个类别，将序列生成任务转换为序列标记，降低了计算复杂度。此外，KSTEM 还采用了二维位置编码，由词的内部和外部顺序组成。同时，为了弥补领域知识的不足，本文提出了一种针对具体任务的查询修正训练范式，包括基于编辑策略的预训练、基于用户点击的后期预训练和基于人工标签的微调。最后，我们将 KSTEM 应用于产业搜索系统。大量的离线和在线实验表明，KSTEM 显著提高了查询纠错性能。我们希望我们的经验将有益于前沿研究人员。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Improving+Query+Correction+Using+Pre-train+Language+Model+In+Search+Engines)|0|
|[iHAS: Instance-wise Hierarchical Architecture Search for Deep Learning Recommendation Models](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614925)|Yakun Yu, Shiang Qi, Jiuding Yang, Liyao Jiang, Di Niu|University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada|Current recommender systems employ large-sized embedding tables with uniform dimensions for all features, leading to overfitting, high computational cost, and suboptimal generalizing performance. Many techniques aim to solve this issue by feature selection or embedding dimension search. However, these techniques typically select a fixed subset of features or embedding dimensions for all instances and feed all instances into one recommender model without considering heterogeneity between items or users. This paper proposes a novel instance-wise Hierarchical Architecture Search framework, iHAS, which automates neural architecture search at the instance level. Specifically, iHAS incorporates three stages: searching, clustering, and retraining. The searching stage identifies optimal instance-wise embedding dimensions across different field features via carefully designed Bernoulli gates with stochastic selection and regularizers. After obtaining these dimensions, the clustering stage divides samples into distinct groups via a deterministic selection approach of Bernoulli gates. The retraining stage then constructs different recommender models, each one designed with optimal dimensions for the corresponding group. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed iHAS on two public benchmark datasets from a real-world recommender system. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of iHAS and its outstanding transferability to widely-used deep recommendation models.|目前的推荐系统采用大型嵌入表，所有特征尺寸统一，导致拟合过度，计算成本高，泛化性能不理想。许多技术都是通过特征选择或嵌入维搜索来解决这一问题。然而，这些技术通常为所有实例选择固定的特性子集或嵌入维度，并将所有实例提供给一个推荐模型，而不考虑项目或用户之间的异构性。提出了一种新的实例级层次体系结构搜索框架 iHAS，该框架在实例级自动进行神经体系结构搜索。具体来说，iHAS 包括三个阶段: 搜索、集群和再培训。搜索阶段通过精心设计的带有随机选择和正则化子的伯努利门来确定不同场特征之间的最佳实例嵌入维数。在获得这些维度之后，聚类阶段通过贝努利门的确定性选择方法将样本划分为不同的组。然后再培训阶段构建不同的推荐模型，每个模型都为相应的群体设计了最优维度。我们进行了广泛的实验，以评估来自真实世界的两个公共基准数据集的 iHAS 推荐系统。实验结果表明了 iHAS 的有效性及其对广泛使用的深度推荐模型的突出可转移性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=iHAS:+Instance-wise+Hierarchical+Architecture+Search+for+Deep+Learning+Recommendation+Models)|0|

Self-attention has been widely believed to be able to effectively select those informative and relevant items from a sequence of interacted items for next-item prediction via learning larger attention weights for these items. However, this may not always be true in reality. Our empirical analysis of some representative Transformer-based SR models reveals that it is not uncommon for large attention weights to be assigned to less relevant items, which can result in inaccurate recommendations. Through further in-depth analysis, we find two factors that may contribute to such inaccurate assignment of attention weights: sub-optimal position encoding and noisy input. To this end, in this paper, we aim to address this significant yet challenging gap in existing works. To be specific, we propose a simple yet effective framework called Attention Calibration for Transformer-based Sequential Recommendation (AC-TSR). In AC-TSR, a novel spatial calibrator and adversarial calibrator are designed respectively to directly calibrates those incorrectly assigned attention weights. The former is devised to explicitly capture the spatial relationships (i.e., order and distance) among items for more precise calculation of attention weights. The latter aims to redistribute the attention weights based on each item's contribution to the next-item prediction. AC-TSR is readily adaptable and can be seamlessly integrated into various existing transformer-based SR models. Extensive experimental results on four benchmark real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed ACTSR via significant recommendation performance enhancements. The source code is available at https://github.com/AIM-SE/AC-TSR.|基于变压器的顺序推荐(SR)近年来兴起，自注意机制是其关键组成部分。人们普遍认为，自我注意能够有效地从一系列相互作用的项目中选择信息丰富的相关项目，通过学习这些项目的较大注意权重来进行下一个项目的预测。然而，这在现实中可能并不总是正确的。我们对一些有代表性的基于变压器的 SR 模型的实证分析表明，将大的注意力权重分配给相关性较低的项目并不罕见，这可能导致不准确的推荐。通过进一步的深入分析，我们发现了两个可能导致注意力权重分配不准确的因素: 次优位置编码和噪声输入。为此，在本文中，我们的目标是解决这一重大但具有挑战性的差距，在现有的工作。具体来说，我们提出了一个简单而有效的框架，称为基于变压器的顺序推荐注意力校正(AC-TSR)。在 AC-TSR 中，分别设计了一种新的空间校正器和对抗校正器，用于直接校正那些不正确分配的注意权重。前者旨在明确地捕捉项目之间的空间关系(即顺序和距离) ，以便更精确地计算注意力权重。后者的目的是重新分配注意权重的基础上，每个项目的贡献，下一个项目的预测。AC-TSR 很容易适应，可以无缝地集成到各种现有的基于变压器的 SR 模型中。在四个基准的真实世界数据集上的大量实验结果显示了我们提出的 ACTSR 通过显著的推荐性能增强的优越性。源代码可在 https://github.com/aim-se/ac-tsr 下载。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Attention+Calibration+for+Transformer-based+Sequential+Recommendation)|0|

However, existing methods rely on a limited number of words from the category description and often neglect the hierarchical structure of the category tree, resulting in suboptimal category representations. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach named hierarchical contrastive learning framework for query classification (HCL4QC), which leverages the hierarchical category tree structure to improve the performance of query classification. Specifically, HCL4QC is designed as a plugin module that consists of two innovative losses, namely local hierarchical contrastive loss (LHCL) and global hierarchical contrastive loss (GHCL). LHCL adjusts representations of categories according to their positional relationship in the hierarchical tree, while GHCL ensures the semantic consistency between the parent category and its child categories. Our proposed method can be adapted to any query classification tasks that involve a hierarchical category structure. We conduct experiments on two real-world datasets to demonstrate the superiority of our hierarchical contrastive learning. The results demonstrate significant improvements in the query classification task, particularly for long-tail categories with sparse supervised information.|查询分类在电子商务中起着至关重要的作用，其目标是在分层的产品类别分类中将用户查询分配给适当的类别。然而，现有的方法仅仅依赖于类别描述中有限的词汇，往往忽略了类别树的层次结构，导致了类别表示的次优化。为了克服这些局限性，提出了一种新的查询分类层次对比学习框架(HCL4QC) ，该框架利用层次分类树结构来提高查询分类的性能。具体来说，HCL4QC 被设计成一个插件模块，由两个创新性的损失组成，即局部层次对比损失(LHCL)和全局层次对比损失(GHCL)。LHCL 根据类别在层次树中的位置关系来调整类别的表示，而 GHCL 保证了父类别与其子类别之间的语义一致性。该方法适用于任何涉及层次分类结构的查询分类任务。我们在两个真实世界的数据集上进行了实验，以验证我们的分层对比学习的优越性。实验结果表明，该算法在查询分类任务方面有明显的改进，特别是对于监督信息稀疏的长尾类别。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=HCL4QC:+Incorporating+Hierarchical+Category+Structures+Into+Contrastive+Learning+for+E-commerce+Query+Classification)|0|

However, online recommender systems impose strict constraints on the inference time of CTR models, which necessitates pruning or filtering users' 1-hop neighbors to reduce computational complexity. Furthermore, while the graph information of users and items has been proven effective in collaborative filtering models, recursive graph convolution can be computationally costly and expensive to implement. To address these challenges, we propose the Non-Recursive Cluster-scale Graph Interacted (NRCGI) model, which reorganizes graph convolutional networks in a non-recursive and cluster-scale view to enable CTR models to consider deep graph information with low computational cost. NRCGI employs non-recursive cluster-scale graph aggregation, which allows the online recommendation computational complexity to shrink from tens of thousands of items to tens to hundreds of clusters. Additionally, since NRCGI aggregates neighbors in a non-recursive view, each hop of neighbors has a clear physical meaning. NRCGI explicitly constructs meaningful interactions between the hops of neighbors of users and items to fully model users' intent towards the given item. Experimental results demonstrate that NRCGI outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in three public datasets and one industrial dataset while maintaining efficient inference.|从用户的行为中提取他们的兴趣，特别是他们的一跳邻居，已经被证明可以提高点进率(CTR)预测性能。然而，在线推荐系统对 CTR 模型的推理时间有严格的限制，为了降低计算复杂度，需要对用户的1跳邻居进行剪枝或过滤。此外，虽然用户和项目的图形信息已被证明在协同过滤模型中是有效的，递归图形卷积可能在计算上是昂贵的，实现起来也是昂贵的。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了非递归聚类尺度图交互(NRCGI)模型，该模型以非递归和聚类尺度视图重新组织图卷积网络，以使 CTR 模型能够以低计算成本考虑深层图信息。NRCGI 采用非递归聚类规模的图聚合技术，使在线推荐计算复杂度从几万个项目减少到几十到几百个聚类。此外，由于 NRCGI 以非递归视图的形式聚合邻居，因此邻居的每个跃点都有明确的物理意义。NRCGI 显式地在用户和项目的邻居之间构造有意义的交互，以充分模拟用户对给定项目的意图。实验结果表明，在保持有效推理的同时，NRCGI 在三个公共数据集和一个工业数据集中的表现优于最先进的基线。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Non-Recursive+Cluster-Scale+Graph+Interacted+Model+for+Click-Through+Rate+Prediction)|0|

However, existing MTL models often suffer from performance degeneration with negative transfer and seesaw phenomena. Some works attempt to alleviate the negative transfer and seesaw issues by separating task-specific and shared experts to mitigate the harmful interference between task-specific and shared knowledge. Despite the success of these efforts, task-specific and shared knowledge have still not been thoroughly decoupled. There may still exist unnecessary mixture between the shared and task-specific knowledge, which may harm MLT models' performances. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose multi-task knowledge disentanglement network (MTKDN) to further reduce harmful interference between the shared and task-specific knowledge. Specifically, we propose a novel contrastive disentanglement mechanism to explicitly decouple the shared and task-specific knowledge in corresponding hidden spaces. In this way, the unnecessary mixture between shared and task-specific knowledge can be reduced. As for optimization objectives, we propose individual optimization objectives for shared and task-specific experts, by which we can encourage these two kinds of experts to focus more on extracting the shared and task-specific knowledge, respectively. Additionally, we propose a margin regularization to ensure that the fusion of shared and task-specific knowledge can outperform exploiting either of them alone.

|[FiBiNet++: Reducing Model Size by Low Rank Feature Interaction Layer for CTR Prediction](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615242)|Pengtao Zhang, Zheng Zheng, Junlin Zhang|Sina Weibo, Beijing, China; Brandeis University, Waltham, MA, USA|Click-Through Rate (CTR) estimation has become one of the most fundamental tasks in many real-world applications and various deep models have been proposed. Some research has proved that FiBiNet is one of the best performance models and outperforms all other models on Avazu dataset. However, the large model size of FiBiNet hinders its wider application. In this paper, we propose a novel FiBiNet++ model to redesign FiBiNet's model structure, which greatly reduces model size while further improves its performance. One of the primary techniques involves our proposed "Low Rank Layer" focused on feature interaction, which serves as a crucial driver of achieving a superior compression ratio for models. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that FiBiNet++ effectively reduces non-embedding model parameters of FiBiNet by 12x to 16x on three datasets. On the other hand, FiBiNet++ leads to significant performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art CTR methods, including FiBiNet.

Applying neural network-based learning to rank techniques has led to significant improvements in matching guests with hosts. These improvements in ranking were driven by a core strategy: order the listings by their estimated booking probabilities, then iterate on techniques to make these booking probability estimates more and more accurate. Embedded implicitly in this strategy was an assumption that the booking probability of a listing could be determined independently of other listings in search results. In this paper we discuss how this assumption, pervasive throughout the commonly-used learning to rank frameworks, is false. We provide a theoretical foundation correcting this assumption, followed by efficient neural network architectures based on the theory. Explicitly accounting for possible similarities between listings, and reducing them to diversify the search results generated strong positive impact.

Over the past few years, numerous studies have been conducted to improve the accuracy of CTR prediction by exploring data inherent patterns. These studies indicate that training CTR models with group-specific parameters on divided data groups can lead to significant improvements. However, most works generally divide groups manually with some prior knowledge, and such a fixed group division method may hinder the expression of user common interests. To address this limitation, we propose a novel group parameter modeling method, where the user group division and group parameter learning processes are completed in an automatic and dynamic way. Our method employs a three-stage approach, consisting of group information selection, group representation learning, and group parameter generation, which allows the efficient expression of user common interests. We conduct experiments on both public datasets and industrial datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

|[Practice on Effectively Extracting NLP Features for Click-Through Rate Prediction](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614707)|Hao Yang, Ziliang Wang, Weijie Bian, Yifan Zeng|Shopee Discovery Ads, Beijing, China|Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is critical for industrial applications such as recommendation system and online advertising. Practically, there are a series of research proved that Natural Language Processing (NLP) features are helpful to improve CTR task performance. As these works show, there are different ways to extract NLP features. For example, keywords of item title are extracted as open-box feature by term frequency?inverse document frequency (tf-idf) method while item semantic embedding is extracted as black-box feature by shallow models (\emphe.g., word2vec) or deep learning models (e.g., BERT). However, these NLP models are pre-trained on NLP task, which is very different from the CTR task. Then it leads to the limited improvement of Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) in CTR task. On the other hand, traditional NLP models for CTR task only consider open-box feature or black-box feature separately, which also leads to the discounted effect. Lastly, many NLP models are mainly used to extract semantic features only on item side. These methods take little account of user side information, or only IDs related features (\emphe.g., item's IDs) in user behavior sequence are introduced. In our work, we proposed a new network named BERT Attention method based on both Item and User information (BAIU). The target of BAIU is consistent with the CTR task, which is helpful to extract more effective NLP features. Also, both open-box and black-box features are simultaneously extracted by this network, which makes the model to learn more useful NLP features for CTR task and also makes the model more interpretable. Extensive experiments on both public data and our commercial data validate the effectiveness of our approach. Finally, the online experiment brings 2.2% gain of CTR on recommendation.|对于推荐系统和在线广告等工业应用而言，点进率(ctrl)预测至关重要。实践证明，自然语言处理(NLP)特性有助于提高 CTR 任务性能。正如这些工作所显示的，有不同的方法提取自然语言处理特征。例如，项目标题的关键词通过词频-逆文档频率(tf-idf)方法提取为开箱特征，而项目语义嵌入通过浅层模型(word2vec)或深层学习模型(BERT)提取为黑箱特征。然而，这些自然语言处理模型是在自然语言处理任务上进行预训练的，这与 CTR 任务有很大的不同。然后，它导致 ROC 曲线下面积(aUC)在 CTR 任务中的有限改进。另一方面，传统的点击率任务自然语言处理模型只考虑开箱特征和黑箱特征，这也导致了模型的折现效应。最后，许多自然语言处理模型主要用于仅在项目一侧提取语义特征。这些方法很少考虑用户端信息，或者只引入用户行为序列中与 ID 相关的特征(例如，项的 ID)。在我们的工作中，我们提出了一种新的基于项目和用户信息(BAIU)的网络方法—— BERT 注意方法。BAIU 的目标与 CTR 任务一致，有助于提取更有效的自然语言处理特征。该网络同时提取了开箱特征和黑箱特征，使模型学习到更多有用的自然语言处理特征，使模型更具可解释性。对公共数据和我们的商业数据的大量实验验证了我们的方法的有效性。最后，在线实验给推荐带来了2.2% 的点击率增益。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Practice+on+Effectively+Extracting+NLP+Features+for+Click-Through+Rate+Prediction)|0|

The integration of S&R modeling is a highly intuitive approach adopted by industry practitioners. However, there is a noticeable lack of research conducted in this area within the academia, primarily due to the absence of publicly available datasets. Consequently, a substantial gap has emerged between academia and industry regarding research endeavors in this field. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first large-scale, real-world dataset KuaiSAR of integrated Search And Recommendation behaviors collected from Kuaishou, a leading short-video app in China with over 300 million daily active users. Previous research in this field has predominantly employed publicly available datasets that are semi-synthetic and simulated, with artificially fabricated search behaviors. Distinct from previous datasets, KuaiSAR records genuine user behaviors, the occurrence of each interaction within either search or recommendation service, and the users' transitions between the two services. This work aids in joint modeling of S&R, and the utilization of search data for recommenders (and recommendation data for search engines). Additionally, due to the diverse feedback labels of user-video interactions, KuaiSAR also supports a wide range of other tasks, including intent recommendation, multi-task learning, and long sequential multi-behavior modeling etc. We believe this dataset will facilitate innovative research and enrich our understanding of S&R services integration in real-world applications.|搜索和推荐服务的融合是 Kuaishou 和 TikTok 等在线内容平台的一个重要方面。S & R 建模的集成是业界从业人员采用的一种高度直观的方法。然而，学术界在这一领域明显缺乏研究，主要是由于缺乏公开可用的数据集。因此，在这个领域的研究工作方面，学术界和工业界之间出现了巨大的差距。为了弥补这一差距，我们介绍了第一个大规模的，真实世界的数据集 KuaiSAR 的集成搜索和推荐行为收集自 Kuaishou，一个领先的短视频应用程序在中国有超过3亿日活跃用户。以前在这个领域的研究主要使用公开可用的数据集，这些数据集是半合成的和模拟的，具有人为制造的搜索行为。与以前的数据集不同，KuaiSAR 记录了真实的用户行为、搜索或推荐服务中每个交互的发生情况以及用户在两个服务之间的转换。这项工作有助于 S & R 的联合建模，以及对推荐者的搜索数据(和搜索引擎的推荐数据)的利用。此外，由于用户与视频交互的反馈标签多种多样，KuaiSAR 还支持广泛的其他任务，包括意图推荐、多任务学习和长顺序多行为建模等。我们相信这个数据集将促进创新研究，丰富我们对现实世界应用中的 S & R 服务集成的理解。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=KuaiSAR:+A+Unified+Search+And+Recommendation+Dataset)|0|
|[HyperBandit: Contextual Bandit with Hypernewtork for Time-Varying User Preferences in Streaming Recommendation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614921)|Chenglei Shen, Xiao Zhang, Wei Wei, Jun Xu|Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Renmin University of China, Beijing, China|In real-world streaming recommender systems, user preferences often dynamically change over time (e.g., a user may have different preferences during weekdays and weekends). Existing bandit-based streaming recommendation models only consider time as a timestamp, without explicitly modeling the relationship between time variables and time-varying user preferences. This leads to recommendation models that cannot quickly adapt to dynamic scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a contextual bandit approach using hypernetwork, called HyperBandit, which takes time features as input and dynamically adjusts the recommendation model for time-varying user preferences. Specifically, HyperBandit maintains a neural network capable of generating the parameters for estimating time-varying rewards, taking into account the correlation between time features and user preferences. Using the estimated time-varying rewards, a bandit policy is employed to make online recommendations by learning the latent item contexts. To meet the real-time requirements in streaming recommendation scenarios, we have verified the existence of a low-rank structure in the parameter matrix and utilize low-rank factorization for efficient training. Theoretically, we demonstrate a sublinear regret upper bound against the best policy. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed HyperBandit consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accumulated rewards.|在现实世界的流媒体推荐系统中，用户的偏好通常会随着时间而动态变化(例如，用户在工作日和周末可能会有不同的偏好)。现有的基于盗贼的流媒体推荐模型只考虑时间作为时间戳，而没有明确建模时间变量和时变用户偏好之间的关系。这导致推荐模型不能快速适应动态场景。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种使用超网络的上下文绑架方法，称为 HyperBandit，它以时间特征作为输入，并动态调整推荐模型以适应时变的用户偏好。具体来说，HyperBandit 维护了一个神经网络，该网络能够生成用于估计时变奖励的参数，同时考虑到时间特征和用户偏好之间的相关性。利用估计的时变奖励，采用强盗策略，通过学习潜在项目上下文提出在线推荐。为了满足流媒体推荐场景的实时性要求，我们验证了参数矩阵中低秩结构的存在性，并利用低秩分解进行有效的训练。从理论上证明了最优策略的次线性后悔上界。在真实世界数据集上的大量实验表明，提出的 HyperBandit 在累积奖励方面始终优于最先进的基线。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=HyperBandit:+Contextual+Bandit+with+Hypernewtork+for+Time-Varying+User+Preferences+in+Streaming+Recommendation)|0|
|[Dually Enhanced Delayed Feedback Modeling for Streaming Conversion Rate Prediction](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614856)|Sunhao Dai, Yuqi Zhou, Jun Xu, JiRong Wen|Renmin University of China, Beijing, China|In online industrial advertising systems, conversion actions (e.g., purchases or downloads) often occur significantly delayed, even up to several days or weeks after the user clicks. This phenomenon leads to the crucial challenge calleddelayed feedback problem in streaming CVR prediction, that is, the online systems cannot receive the true label of conversions immediately for continuous training. To mitigate the delayed feedback problem, recent state-of-the-art methods often apply sample duplicate mechanisms to introduce early certain conversion information. Nevertheless, these works have overlooked a crucial issue of rapid shifts in data distribution and considered both the newly observed data and duplicated early data together, resulting in biases in both distributions. In this work, we propose a Dually enhanced Delayed Feedback Model (DDFM), which tackles the above issues by treating the newly observed data and duplicated early data separately. DDFM consists of dual unbiased CVR estimators that share the same form but utilize different latent variables as weights: one for the newly observed data and the other for the duplicated early data. To avoid high variance, we adopt an addition-only formula for these latent variables, eliminating multiplication or division operations. Furthermore, we design a shared-bottom network that efficiently and jointly estimates the latent variables in DDFM. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the unbiasedness and convergence properties of DDFM. Extensive experiments on both public and industrial large-scale real-world datasets exhibit that our proposed DDFM consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.|在在线工业广告系统中，转换操作(例如购买或下载)经常出现明显延迟，甚至在用户点击后几天或几周。这种现象导致了流式 CVR 预测中的关键问题——延迟反馈问题，即在线系统不能立即得到连续训练所需的转换的真实标签。为了缓解延迟反馈问题，最新的技术方法通常应用样本重复机制来引入早期确定的转换信息。然而，这些工作忽略了数据分布快速变化的关键问题，同时考虑了新观测数据和重复的早期数据，导致两种分布的偏差。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个双增强延迟反馈模型(DDFM) ，它通过分别处理新观测数据和重复早期数据来解决上述问题。DDFM 由双无偏 CVR 估计器组成，它们具有相同的形式，但利用不同的潜变量作为权值: 一个用于新观测数据，另一个用于重复的早期数据。为了避免高方差，我们对这些潜在变量采用一个只加的公式，消除了乘法或除法运算。此外，我们还设计了一个共享底层网络，可以有效地联合估计 DDFM 中的潜变量。理论分析证明了 DDFM 的无偏性和收敛性。在公共和工业大规模真实世界数据集上的大量实验表明，我们提出的 DDFM 始终优于现有的最先进的方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Dually+Enhanced+Delayed+Feedback+Modeling+for+Streaming+Conversion+Rate+Prediction)|0|

However, cold start remains a challenging problem limited by sparse user interactions. Some scholars propose to transfer the dense information from the source domain to the target domain through cross-domain recommendation, but most of the work assumes that there is a small amount of historical interaction in the target domain. However, this approach essentially presupposes the existence of at least some historical interaction within the target domain. In this paper, we focus on the domain-level zero-shot recommendation (DZSR) problem. To address the above challenges, we propose a knowledge-aware cross-semantic alignment (K-CSA) framework to learn transferable source domain semantic information. The motivation is to establish stable alignments of interests in different domains through class semantic descriptions (CSDs). Specifically, due to the lack of effective information in the target domain, we learn semantic representations of source and target domain items based on knowledge graphs. Moreover, we conduct multi-view K-means to extract item CSDs from the learned semantic representations. Further, K-CSA learns universal user CSDs through the designed multi-head self-attention. To facilitate the transference of user interest from the source domain to the target domain, we devise a cross-semantic contrastive learning strategy, grounded in the prototype distribution matrix. We conduct extensive experiments on several real-world cross-domain datasets, and the experimental results clearly demonstrate the superiority of our proposed K-CSA compared with other baselines.|推荐系统由于其广泛的应用场景吸引了学术界和工业界的注意。然而，受稀疏用户交互的限制，冷启动仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题。一些学者提出通过跨域推荐将密集信息从源域转移到目标域，但大多数工作假设目标域中存在少量的历史交互。然而，这种方法基本上是以目标域内至少存在一些历史交互为前提的。本文主要研究领域级零拍推荐(DZSR)问题。为了应对上述挑战，我们提出了一个知识感知跨语义比对(k-CSA)框架来学习可转移源域语义信息。其动机是通过类语义描述(CSD)在不同领域建立稳定的兴趣对齐。具体来说，由于目标领域缺乏有效的信息，我们基于知识图学习源和目标领域项目的语义表示。此外，我们还进行了多视图 K- 均值从学习的语义表征中提取项目 CSD。此外，K-CSA 通过设计的多头自我注意来学习通用用户 CSD。为了促进用户兴趣从源域向目标域的转移，我们设计了一种基于原型分布矩阵的跨语义对比学习策略。我们在几个实际的跨域数据集上进行了广泛的实验，实验结果清楚地表明了我们提出的 K-CSA 相对于其他基线的优越性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Knowledge-Aware+Cross-Semantic+Alignment+for+Domain-Level+Zero-Shot+Recommendation)|0|

In these systems, students can practice independently and learn from different learning materials over long periods of time. As a result, it is essential to trace students' knowledge states over long learning sequences while maintaining a personalized model of each individual student's progress. However, the existing deep learning-based knowledge tracing models are either not personalized or not tailored for handling long sequences. Handling long sequences are especially essential in the online education environments, in where models are preferred to be updated with the newly collected user data in a timely manner as students could acquire knowledge on each learning activity. In this paper, we propose a knowledge tracing model, Continuous Personalized Knowledge Tracing (CPKT), that can mimic the real-world long-term continuous learning scenario by incorporating a novel online model training paradigm that is suitable for the knowledge tracing problem. To achieve personalized knowledge tracing, we propose two model components: 1) personalized memory slots to maintain learner's knowledge in a lifelong manner, and 2) personalized user embeddings that help to accurately predict the individual responses, correctly detect the personalized knowledge acquisition and forgetting patterns, and better interpret and analyze the learner's progress. Additionally, we propose transition-aware stochastic shared embedding according to the learning transition matrix to regularize the online model training. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets showcase the effectiveness and superiority of CPKT, especially for students with longer sequences.|随着在线教育系统的发展，获取学习材料的机会越来越多。在这些系统中，学生可以长时间独立练习和从不同的学习材料中学习。因此，在长时间的学习序列中追踪学生的知识状态，同时保持每个学生进步的个性化模型是至关重要的。然而，现有的基于深度学习的知识跟踪模型要么不个性化，要么不适合处理长序列。处理长序列在在线教育环境中尤为重要，在这种环境中，由于学生可以获得关于每项学习活动的知识，因此倾向于使用新收集的用户数据及时更新模型。在本文中，我们提出了一个知识跟踪模型，连续个性化知识跟踪(CPKT) ，它可以模拟真实世界的长期连续学习情景，通过引入一个新的在线模型训练范式，适合于知识跟踪问题。为了实现个性化的知识追踪，我们提出了两个模型组件: 1)个性化的记忆槽，以终身的方式维护学习者的知识; 2)个性化的用户嵌入，有助于准确预测个体的反应，正确检测个性化的知识获取和遗忘模式，并更好地解释和分析学习者的进步。此外，我们根据学习转移矩阵提出了具有过渡意识的随机共享嵌入，以规范在线模型训练。在四个实际数据集上的大量实验表明了 CPKT 的有效性和优越性，特别是对于序列较长的学生。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Continuous+Personalized+Knowledge+Tracing:+Modeling+Long-Term+Learning+in+Online+Environments)|0|
|[Modeling Preference as Weighted Distribution over Functions for User Cold-start Recommendation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614972)|Jingxuan Wen, Huafeng Liu, Liping Jing|Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China|=User cold-start recommendation is a well-known challenge in current recommender systems. The cause is that the number of user interactions is too few to accurately estimate user preferences. Furthermore, the uncertainty of user interactions intensifies along with the number of user interactions decreasing. Although existing meta-learning based models with globally sharing knowledge show good performance in most cold-start scenarios, the ability of handling challenges on intention importance and prediction uncertainty is missing: (1) Intra-user uncertainty. When estimating user preferences (reflected in the user's latent representation), each of user interactions is independently considered in the form of user-item pair, which cannot capture the correlation between user interactions, as well as considering the global intent under user interactions. (2) Inter-user importance. During the model training, all users are treated as equally important, which cannot distinguish the contribution of users in the model training process. Assigning the same weight to all users may lead to users with high uncertainty incorrectly guiding the model learning in the early stage of training. To tackle the above challenges, in this paper, we focus on modeling user preference as a weighted distribution over functions (WDoF) for user cold-start recommendation, which not only models the intra-user uncertainty through neural processes with Multinomial likelihood but also considers the importance of different users with curriculum learning during the model training process. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical explanation that why the proposed model performs better than regular neural processes based recommendation methods. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model over several state-of-the-art cold-start recommendation methods.|= 用户冷启动推荐在当前的推荐系统中是一个众所周知的挑战。原因是用户交互的数量太少，无法准确估计用户偏好。此外，用户交互的不确定性随着用户交互次数的减少而增加。虽然现有的基于元学习的全局知识共享模型在大多数冷启动情景下表现出良好的性能，但缺乏处理意图重要性和预测不确定性挑战的能力: (1)用户内部的不确定性。在估计用户偏好时(反映在用户的潜在表示中) ，每个用户交互都以用户项对的形式独立考虑，不能捕获用户交互之间的相关性，也不能考虑用户交互下的全局意图。(2)用户之间的重要性。在模型训练过程中，所有用户都被视为同等重要的用户，不能区分用户在模型训练过程中的贡献。给所有用户赋予相同的权重可能会导致高不确定性用户在训练的早期阶段错误地指导模型学习。针对上述挑战，本文将用户偏好建模为用户冷启动推荐的加权函数分布(WDoF) ，不仅通过多项式似然的神经过程模拟用户内部的不确定性，而且在模型训练过程中考虑了不同用户课程学习的重要性。此外，我们提供了一个理论上的解释，为什么所提出的模型性能优于常规的神经过程为基础的推荐方法。在四个实际数据集上的实验结果表明了该模型对于几种最新的冷启动推荐方法的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Modeling+Preference+as+Weighted+Distribution+over+Functions+for+User+Cold-start+Recommendation)|0|

Furthermore, due to the existence of distribution drift issues, directly constructing feature alignment between source domain and target domain representations is not an effective way. Therefore, we propose a Multimodal Optimal Transport Knowledge Distillation (MOTKD) method for cross domain recommendation. Specifically, we propose a multimodal graph attention network to model the multimodal preference representation of users. Then, we introduce a proxy distribution space as a bridge between the source and target domains. Based on the common proxy distribution, we utilize the optimal transport method to achieve cross domain knowledge transfer. Further, in order to improve the auxiliary training effect of source domain supervised signals on target domain, we design a multi-level cross domain knowledge distillation module. We conducted extensive experiments on two pairs of cross domain datasets composed of four datasets. The experimental results indicate that our proposed MOTKD method outperforms other state-of-the-art models.|推荐系统已广泛应用于电子商务、新闻媒体和短视频平台。随着丰富的图像，文字和音频信息，用户往往从事个性化的交互基于他们的多模态偏好。随着应用场景的不断扩展，跨域推荐问题变得越来越重要，例如电子商务的公共和私人领域的推荐。现有的跨域推荐方法通过共享编码器和对比学习等方法取得了一定的效果。然而，很少有研究关注跨领域推荐中多模态信息的有效提取和利用。此外，由于分布漂移问题的存在，直接构造源域和目标域表示之间的特征对齐并不是一种有效的方法。因此，我们提出了一种跨域推荐的多模式最优运输知识提取(MOTKD)方法。具体来说，我们提出了一个多模态图注意网络来模拟用户的多模态偏好表示。然后，引入一个代理分布空间作为源域和目标域之间的桥梁。在公共代理分布的基础上，利用最优传输方法实现跨领域的知识转移。进一步，为了提高源域监督信号对目标域的辅助训练效果，我们设计了一个多级跨域知识提取模块。我们对由四个数据集组成的两对跨域数据集进行了广泛的实验。实验结果表明，我们提出的 MOTKD 方法优于其他最先进的模型。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Multimodal+Optimal+Transport+Knowledge+Distillation+for+Cross-domain+Recommendation)|0|
|[Task-Difficulty-Aware Meta-Learning with Adaptive Update Strategies for User Cold-Start Recommendation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615074)|Xuhao Zhao, Yanmin Zhu, Chunyang Wang, Mengyuan Jing, Jiadi Yu, Feilong Tang|Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China|User cold-start recommendation is one of the most challenging problems that limit the effectiveness of recommender systems. Meta-learning-based methods are introduced to address this problem by learning initialization parameters for cold-start tasks. Recent studies attempt to enhance the initialization methods. They first represent each task by the cold-start user and interacted items. Then they distinguish tasks based on the task relevance to learn adaptive initialization. However, this manner is based on the assumption that user preferences can be reflected by the interacted items saliently, which is not always true in reality. In addition, we argue that previous approaches suffer from their adaptive framework (e.g., adaptive initialization), which reduces the adaptability in the process of transferring meta-knowledge to personalized RSs. In response to the issues, we propose a task-difficulty-aware meta-learning with adaptive update strategies (TDAS) for user cold-start recommendation. First, we design a task difficulty encoder, which can represent user preference salience, task relevance, and other task characteristics by modeling task difficulty information. Second, we adopt a novel framework with task-adaptive local update strategies by optimizing the initialization parameters with task-adaptive per-step and per-layer hyperparameters. Extensive experiments based on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our TDAS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

|[Retrievability Bias Estimation Using Synthetically Generated Queries](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615221)|Amin Abolghasemi, Suzan Verberne, Arian Askari, Leif Azzopardi|University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, United Kingdom; Leiden University, Leiden, Netherlands|Ranking with pre-trained language models (PLMs) has shown to be highly effective for various Information Retrieval tasks. Previous studies investigated the performance of these models in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. However, there is no prior work on evaluating PLM-based rankers in terms of their retrievability bias. In this paper, we evaluate the retrievability bias of PLM-based rankers with the use of synthetically generated queries. We compare the retrievability bias in two of the most common PLM-based rankers, a Bi-Encoder BERT ranker and a Cross-Encoder BERT re-ranker against BM25, which was found to be one of the least biased models in prior work. We conduct a series of experiments with which we explore the plausibility of using synthetic queries generated with a generative model, docT5query, in the evaluation of retrievability bias. Our experiments show promising results on the use of synthetically generated queries for the purpose of retrievability bias estimation. Moreover, we find that the estimated bias values resulting from synthetically generated queries are lower than the ones estimated with user-generated queries on the MS MARCO evaluation benchmark. This indicates that synthetically generated queries might cause less bias than user-generated queries and therefore, by using such queries in training PLM-based rankers, we might be able to reduce the retrievability bias in these models.|使用预先训练好的语言模型(PLM)进行排名已被证明对于各种信息检索任务非常有效。以往的研究从效能和效率的角度研究了这些模型的性能。然而，目前还没有关于评估基于 PLM 的排名在他们的检索偏差方面的工作。本文利用综合生成的查询来评估基于 PLM 的排序器的可检索性偏差。我们比较了两种最常见的基于 PLM 的排序器，双编码器 BERT 排序器和交叉编码器 BERT 重排序器对 BM25的可检索性偏差，这被发现是先前工作中偏差最小的模型之一。我们进行了一系列的实验，通过这些实验，我们探索了使用一个名为 doct5 query 的生成模型生成的合成查询来评估可检索性偏差的可行性。实验结果表明，综合生成的查询用于可检索性偏差估计具有良好的效果。此外，我们发现在 MS MARCO 评估基准上，由合成生成查询所得到的估计偏差值低于由用户生成查询所得到的估计偏差值。这表明综合生成的查询可能比用户生成的查询引起的偏差更小，因此，通过在训练基于 PLM 的排名中使用这样的查询，我们可能能够减少这些模型中的可检索性偏差。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Retrievability+Bias+Estimation+Using+Synthetically+Generated+Queries)|0|

|[SeqGen: A Sequence Generator via User Side Information for Behavior Sparsity in Recommendation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615244)|Xu Min, Xiaolu Zhang, Bin Shen, Shuhan Wang, Yong He, Changsheng Li, Jun Zhou|Ant Group, Hangzhou, China; Ant Group, Beijing, China; Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China|In real-world industrial advertising systems, user behavior sparsity is a key issue that affects online recommendation performance. We observe that users with rich behaviors can obtain better recommendation results than those with sparse behaviors in a conversion-rate (CVR) prediction model. Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose a new method SeqGen, in an effort to exploit user side information to bridge the gap between rich and sparse behaviors. SeqGen is a learnable and pluggable module, which can be easily integrated into any CVR model and no longer requires two-stage training as in previous works. In particular, SeqGen learns a mapping relationship between the user side information and behavior sequences, only on the basis of the users with long behavior sequences. After that, SeqGen can generate rich sequence features for users with sparse behaviors based on their side information, so as to alleviate the issue of user behavior sparsity. The generated sequence features will then be fed into the classifier tower of an arbitrary CVR model together with the original sequence features. To the best of our knowledge, our approach constitutes the first attempt to exploit user side information for addressing the user behavior sparsity issue. We validate the effectiveness of SeqGen on the publicly available dataset MovieLens-1M, and our method receives an improvement of up to 0.5% in terms of the AUC score. More importantly, we successfully deploy SeqGen in the commercial advertising system Xlight of Alipay, which improves the grouped AUC of the CVR model by 0.6% and brings a boost of 0.49% in terms of the conversion rate on A/B testing.|在现实工业广告系统中，用户行为稀疏性是影响在线推荐性能的关键问题。在 CVR 预测模型中，我们观察到行为丰富的用户比行为稀疏的用户获得更好的推荐结果。受到这一现象的启发，我们提出了一种新的方法 SeqGen，尝试利用用户端信息来弥补丰富和稀疏行为之间的差距。SeqGen 是一个可学习和可插拔的模块，它可以很容易地集成到任何 CVR 模型中，不再像以前的作品那样需要两阶段的培训。特别是，SeqGen 只在具有长行为序列的用户的基础上学习用户端信息和行为序列之间的映射关系。然后，SeqGen 可以根据用户的侧信息为稀疏行为的用户生成丰富的序列特征，从而缓解用户行为稀疏的问题。然后将生成的序列特征与原始序列特征一起反馈到任意 CVR 模型的分类器塔中。据我们所知，我们的方法是第一次尝试利用用户端信息来解决用户行为稀疏性问题。我们验证了 SeqGen 在公开数据集 MovieLens-1M 上的有效性，并且我们的方法在 AUC 评分方面获得了高达0.5% 的改善。更重要的是，我们成功地在支付宝的商业广告系统 Xlight 中部署了 SeqGen，它将 CVR 模型的分组 AUC 提高了0.6% ，在 A/B 测试中的转换率提高了0.49% 。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=SeqGen:+A+Sequence+Generator+via+User+Side+Information+for+Behavior+Sparsity+in+Recommendation)|0|

Although most conventional approaches address this problem by assessing the semantic similarity between the query and item, pure semantic matching is not everything. In reality, auxiliary query-item interactions extracted from user historical behavior data of the search log could provide hints to reveal users' search intents further. Drawing inspiration from this, we devise a novel Behavior Augmented Relevance Learning model for Alipay Search (BARL-ASe) that leverages neighbor queries of target item and neighbor items of target query to complement target query-item semantic matching. Specifically, our model builds multi-level co-attention for distilling coarse-grained and fine-grained semantic representations from both neighbor and target views. The model subsequently employs neighbor-target self-supervised learning to improve the accuracy and robustness of BARL-ASe by strengthening representation and logit learning. Furthermore, we discuss how to deal with the long-tail query-item matching of the mini apps search scenario of Alipay practically.

|[Entire Space Cascade Delayed Feedback Modeling for Effective Conversion Rate Prediction](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615475)|Yunfeng Zhao, Xu Yan, Xiaoqiang Gui, Shuguang Han, XiangRong Sheng, Guoxian Yu, Jufeng Chen, Zhao Xu, Bo Zheng|Alibaba Group, Hangzhou, China; School of Software, Shandong University, Jinan, China|Conversion rate (CVR) prediction is an essential task for large-scale e-commerce platforms. However, refund behaviors frequently occur after conversion in online shopping systems, which drives us to pay attention to effective conversion for building healthier shopping services. This paper defines the probability of item purchasing without any subsequent refund as an effective conversion rate (ECVR). A simple paradigm for ECVR prediction is to decompose it into two sub-tasks: CVR prediction and post-conversion refund rate (RFR) prediction. However, RFR prediction suffers from data sparsity (DS) and sample selection bias (SSB) issues, as the refund behaviors are only available after user purchase. Furthermore, there is delayed feedback in both conversion and refund events and they are sequentially dependent, named cascade delayed feedback (CDF), which significantly harms data freshness for model training. Previous studies mainly focus on tackling DS and SSB or delayed feedback for a single event. To jointly tackle these issues in ECVR prediction, we propose an Entire space CAscade Delayed feedback modeling (ECAD) method. Specifically, ECAD deals with DS and SSB by constructing two tasks including CVR prediction and conversion \& refund rate (CVRFR) prediction using the entire space modeling framework. In addition, it carefully schedules auxiliary tasks to leverage both conversion and refund time within data to alleviate CDF. Experimental results on the offline industrial dataset and online A/B testing demonstrate the effectiveness of ECAD. In addition, ECAD has been deployed in one of the recommender systems in Alibaba, contributing to a significant improvement of ECVR.|转化率(CVR)预测是大型电子商务平台的一项基本任务。然而，在网上购物系统中，退款行为经常发生在转换之后，这促使我们关注有效的转换以建立更健康的购物服务。本文将不随后退款的物品购买概率定义为有效转换率(ECVR)。ECVR 预测的一个简单范例是将其分解为两个子任务: CVR 预测和转换后退款率(RFR)预测。然而，RFR 预测存在数据稀疏(DS)和样本选择偏差(SSB)问题，因为退款行为只能在用户购买之后才能得到。此外，在转换事件和退款事件中都存在延迟反馈，并且它们是相互依赖的，称为级联延迟反馈(CDF) ，这严重损害了模型训练的数据新鲜度。以往的研究主要集中在处理 DS 和 SSB 或单个事件的延迟反馈。为了共同解决 ECVR 预测中的这些问题，我们提出了一种全空间级联延迟反馈建模(ECAD)方法。具体来说，ECAD 利用整个空间建模框架构造了 CVR 预测和转换退款率(CVRFR)预测两个任务来处理 DS 和 SSB。此外，它仔细地安排辅助任务，以利用数据中的转换和退款时间来缓解 CDF。离线工业数据集和在线 A/B 测试的实验结果证明了 ECAD 的有效性。此外，阿里巴巴其中一个推荐系统已采用 ECAD，有助显著改善 ECVR。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Entire+Space+Cascade+Delayed+Feedback+Modeling+for+Effective+Conversion+Rate+Prediction)|0|

However, existing SCR datasets only focus on the fact description section when judging the similarity between cases, ignoring other valuable sections (e.g., the court's opinion) that can provide insightful reasoning process behind. Furthermore, the case similarities are typically measured solely by the textual semantics of the fact descriptions, which may fail to capture the full complexity of legal cases from the perspective of legal knowledge.

The constructed dataset originates from Chinese civil cases and contains 100 query cases and 4,024 candidate cases.

Such biases, which are often prevalent in the training data and learned by the model, can cause societal harms, by misrepresenting certain groups, and by enforcing stereotypes. Mitigating such biases demands algorithms that balance the trade-off between maximized utility for the user with fairness objectives, which incentivize unbiased rankings. Prior work on bias mitigation often assumes that ranking scores, which correspond to the utility that a document holds for a user, can be accurately determined. In reality, there is always a degree of uncertainty in the estimate of expected document utility. This uncertainty can be approximated by viewing ranking models through a Bayesian perspective, where the standard deterministic score becomes a distribution. In this work, we investigate whether uncertainty estimates can be used to decrease the amount of bias in the ranked results, while minimizing loss in measured utility. We introduce a simple method that uses the uncertainty of the ranking scores for an uncertainty-aware, post hoc approach to bias mitigation. We compare our proposed method with existing baselines for bias mitigation with respect to the utility-fairness trade-off, the controllability of methods, and computational costs. We show that an uncertainty-based approach can provide an intuitive and flexible trade-off that outperforms all baselines without additional training requirements, allowing for the post hoc use of this approach on top of arbitrary retrieval models.|检索到的文件中包含的社会偏见越来越受到关注。这样的偏见，通常在培训数据中普遍存在，并被模型学习到，通过歪曲特定群体和强制执行刻板印象，可能造成社会危害。减轻这种偏见需要算法，平衡之间的权衡最大效用的用户和公平的目标，激励无偏排名。先前关于减少偏差的工作通常假设排名分数，这对应于一个文档为用户持有的效用，可以被准确地确定。实际上，在预期文档效用的估计中总是存在一定程度的不确定性。这种不确定性可以通过贝叶斯透视图查看排名模型来近似化，其中标准的确定性得分成为一个分布。在这项工作中，我们调查是否不确定性估计可以用来减少排名结果中的偏差量，同时最小化测量效用的损失。我们介绍了一个简单的方法，使用不确定性的排名得分的不确定性的不确定性，事后的方法来减少偏见。在效用-公平权衡、方法的可控性和计算成本方面，我们将提出的方法与现有的减少偏差的基线进行了比较。我们展示了一个基于不确定性的方法可以提供一个直观和灵活的权衡，在没有额外的训练要求的情况下优于所有的基线，允许在任意检索模型之上事后使用这种方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Predictive+Uncertainty-based+Bias+Mitigation+in+Ranking)|0|
|[Single-User Injection for Invisible Shilling Attack against Recommender Systems](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615062)|Chengzhi Huang, Hui Li|Xiamen University, Xiamen, China|Recommendation systems (RS) are crucial for alleviating the information overload problem. Due to its pivotal role in guiding users to make decisions, unscrupulous parties are lured to launch attacks against RS to affect the decisions of normal users and gain illegal profits. Among various types of attacks, shilling attack is one of the most subsistent and profitable attacks. In shilling attack, an adversarial party injects a number of well-designed fake user profiles into the system to mislead RS so that the attack goal can be achieved. Although existing shilling attack methods have achieved promising results, they all adopt the attack paradigm of multi-user injection, where some fake user profiles are required. This paper provides the first study of shilling attack in an extremely limited scenario: only one fake user profile is injected into the victim RS to launch shilling attacks (i.e., single-user injection). We propose a novel single-user injection method SUI-Attack for invisible shilling attack. SUI-Attack is a graph based attack method that models shilling attack as a node generation task over the user-item bipartite graph of the victim RS, and it constructs the fake user profile by generating user features and edges that link the fake user to items. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SUI-Attack can achieve promising attack results in single-user injection. In addition to its attack power, SUI-Attack increases the stealthiness of shilling attack and reduces the risk of being detected.

|[Meta-Learning with Adaptive Weighted Loss for Imbalanced Cold-Start Recommendation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614965)|Minchang Kim, Yongjin Yang, Jung Hyun Ryu, Taesup Kim|Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea|Sequential recommenders have made great strides in capturing a user's preferences. Nevertheless, the cold-start recommendation remains a fundamental challenge in which only a few user-item interactions are available for personalization. Gradient-based meta-learning approaches have recently emerged in the sequential recommendation field due to their fast adaptation and easy-to-integrate abilities. The meta-learning algorithms formulate the cold-start recommendation as a few-shot learning problem, where each user is represented as a task to be adapted. However, while meta-learning algorithms generally assume that task-wise samples are evenly distributed over classes or values, user-item interactions are not that way in real-world applications (e.g., watching favorite videos multiple times, leaving only good ratings and no bad ones). As a result, in the real-world, imbalanced user feedback that accounts for most task training data may dominate the user adaptation and prevent meta-learning algorithms from learning meaningful meta-knowledge for personalized recommendations. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a novel sequential recommendation framework based on gradient-based meta-learning that captures the imbalance of each user's rating distribution and accordingly computes adaptive loss for user-specific learning.

|[Learning the Co-evolution Process on Live Stream Platforms with Dual Self-attention for Next-topic Recommendations](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614952)|HsuChao Lai, Philip S. Yu, JiunLong Huang|University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan Roc|Live stream platforms have gained popularity in light of emerging social media platforms. Unlike traditional on-demand video platforms, viewers and streamers on the live stream platforms are able to interact in real-time, and this makes viewer interests and live stream topics mutually affect each other on the fly, which is the unique co-evolution phenomenon on live stream platforms. In this paper, we make the first attempt to introduce a novel next-topic recommendation problem for the streamers, LSNR, which incorporates the co-evolution phenomenon. A novel framework CENTR introducing the Co-evolutionary Sequence Embedding Structure that captures the temporal relations of viewer interests and live stream topic sequences with two stacks of self-attention layers is proposed. Instead of learning the sequences individually, a novel dual self-attention mechanism is designed to model interactions between the sequences. The dual self-attention includes two modules, LCA and LVA, to leverage viewer loyalty to improve efficiency and flexibility. Finally, to facilitate cold-start recommendations for new streamers, a collaborative diffusion mechanism is implemented to improve a meta learner. Through the experiments in real datasets, CENTR outperforms state-of-the-art recommender systems in both regular and cold-start scenarios.|随着社交媒体平台的兴起，直播平台越来越受欢迎。与传统的视频点播平台不同，直播平台上的观众和流媒体可以实时互动，这使得观众的兴趣和直播话题在运动中相互影响，这是直播平台上独特的协同进化现象。在本文中，我们首次尝试引入一个新的流媒体下一主题推荐问题，LSNR，它结合了协同进化现象。提出了一种引入协同进化序列嵌入结构的新框架 CENTR，该结构能够捕获观看者兴趣与实时流主题序列之间的时间关系。提出了一种新的双重自我注意机制来模拟序列之间的相互作用，而不是单独学习序列。双重自我关注包括两个模块，LCA 和 LVA，以利用观众忠诚度，提高效率和灵活性。最后，为了促进新流媒体的冷启动建议，实现了一个协作扩散机制，以改善元学习者。通过在实际数据集中的实验，CENTR 在常规和冷启动情况下都优于最先进的推荐系统。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Learning+the+Co-evolution+Process+on+Live+Stream+Platforms+with+Dual+Self-attention+for+Next-topic+Recommendations)|0|

Firstly, the majority of these models adopt an approach that explicitly shares parameters between domains, leading to mutual interference among them. Secondly, due to the distribution differences among domains, the utilization of static parameters in existing methods limits their flexibility to adapt to diverse domains. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model Hyper Adapter for Multi-Domain Recommendation (HAMUR). Specifically, HAMUR consists of two components: (1). Domain-specific adapter, designed as a pluggable module that can be seamlessly integrated into various existing multi-domain backbone models, and (2). Domain-shared hyper-network, which implicitly captures shared information among domains and dynamically generates the parameters for the adapter. We conduct extensive experiments on two public datasets using various backbone networks. The experimental results validate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed model.|多域推荐(MDR)近年来受到了广泛的关注，它利用来自多个域的数据来同时提高它们的性能。然而，当前的 MDR 模型面临两个限制。首先，这些模型中的大多数都采用了域之间显式共享参数的方法，导致了域之间的相互干扰。其次，由于领域之间的分布差异，现有方法中静态参数的使用限制了它们适应不同领域的灵活性。为了应对这些挑战，我们提出了一种新型的多域推荐超级适配器(HAMUR)模型。具体来说，HAMUR 由两部分组成: (1)。特定于领域的适配器，设计为可插入模块，可以无缝集成到各种现有的多领域主干模型，以及(2)。域共享超网络，它隐式地捕获域之间的共享信息并动态地生成适配器的参数。我们使用不同的骨干网络对两个公共数据集进行了广泛的实验。实验结果验证了该模型的有效性和可扩展性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=HAMUR:+Hyper+Adapter+for+Multi-Domain+Recommendation)|0|
|[Prompt Distillation for Efficient LLM-based Recommendation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615017)|Lei Li, Yongfeng Zhang, Li Chen|Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong, Hong Kong; Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ, USA|Large language models (LLM) have manifested unparalleled modeling capability on various tasks, e.g., multi-step reasoning, but the input to these models is mostly limited to plain text, which could be very long and contain noisy information. Long text could take long time to process, and thus may not be efficient enough for recommender systems that require immediate response. In LLM-based recommendation models, user and item IDs are usually filled in a template (i.e., discrete prompt) to allow the models to understand a given task, but the models usually need extensive fine-tuning to bridge the user/item IDs and the template words and to unleash the power of LLM for recommendation. To address the problems, we propose to distill the discrete prompt for a specific task to a set of continuous prompt vectors so as to bridge IDs and words and to reduce the inference time. We also design a training strategy with an attempt to improve the efficiency of training these models. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our PrOmpt Distillation (POD) approach on both sequential recommendation and top-N recommendation tasks. Although the training efficiency can be significantly improved, the improvement of inference efficiency is limited. This finding may inspire researchers in the community to further improve the inference efficiency of LLM-based recommendation models.|大型语言模型(LLM)在多种任务(如多步推理)上表现出了无与伦比的建模能力，但是这些模型的输入大多局限于纯文本，这些文本可能非常长并且包含有噪声的信息。处理冗长的文本可能需要很长的时间，因此对于需要立即响应的推荐系统来说，效率可能不够高。在基于 LLM 的推荐模型中，用户和项目 ID 通常填写在一个模板中(即，离散提示符) ，以使模型能够理解给定的任务，但是模型通常需要大量的微调来连接用户/项目 ID 和模板词，并释放 LLM 的推荐功能。为了解决这个问题，我们提出将特定任务的离散提示提取到一组连续的提示向量中，从而桥接 ID 和单词，减少推理时间。我们还设计了一个训练策略，试图提高这些模型的训练效率。在三个实际数据集上的实验结果表明了本文提示精馏(POD)方法在顺序推荐和前 N 推荐任务上的有效性。虽然训练效率可以显著提高，但推理效率的提高是有限的。这一发现可能会激励社区研究人员进一步提高基于 LLM 的推荐模型的推理效率。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Prompt+Distillation+for+Efficient+LLM-based+Recommendation)|0|

Embeddings are often obtained from training on large pre-existing corpora, and therefore resulting biases can be a reflection of unfair representations in the original data. Bias, in this scenario, is a challenging problem since current mitigation techniques require knowing and understanding existing biases in the embedding, which is not always possible. In this work, we propose to improve word embedding fairness by borrowing methods from the field of data privacy. The idea behind this approach is to treat bias as if it were a special type of training data leakage. This has the unique advantage of not requiring prior knowledge of potential biases in word embeddings. We investigated two types of privacy algorithms, and measured their effect on bias using four different metrics. To investigate techniques from differential privacy, we applied Gaussian perturbation to public pre-trained word embeddings. To investigate noiseless privacy, we applied vector quantization during training. Experiments show that both approaches improve fairness for commonly used embeddings, and additionally, noiseless privacy techniques reduce the size of the resulting embedding representation.|许多公开的预先训练的词语嵌入已经被证明可以编码不同类型的偏见。嵌入常常是通过对大型预先存在的语料库进行训练而获得的，因此产生的偏差可能是原始数据中不公平表示的反映。在这种情况下，偏差是一个具有挑战性的问题，因为当前的缓解技术需要了解和理解嵌入中存在的偏差，而这并不总是可能的。本文从数据隐私的角度出发，提出了一种改进嵌入公平性的方法。这种方法背后的思想是把偏差当作一种特殊类型的训练数据泄漏来处理。这样做的独特优点是不需要事先知道嵌入词中的潜在偏差。我们研究了两种类型的隐私算法，并使用四种不同的指标来测量它们对偏差的影响。为了研究基于差分隐私的嵌入技术，我们将高斯扰动应用于公共预先训练的单词嵌入。为了研究无声的私隐，我们在训练期间使用了向量量化。实验结果表明，这两种方法都提高了常用嵌入算法的公平性，并且无噪隐私技术减小了嵌入表示的大小。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Bias+Invariant+Approaches+for+Improving+Word+Embedding+Fairness)|0|

Recently, various state-of-the-art CF integrates graph neural networks. However, they often suffer from popularity bias, causing recommendations to deviate from users' genuine preferences. Additionally, several contrastive learning methods based on the in-batch sample strategy have been proposed to train the CF model effectively, but they are prone to suffering from sample bias. To address this problem, debiased contrastive loss has been employed in the recommendation, but instead of personalized debiasing, it treats each user equally. In this paper, we propose a popularity-aware debiased contrastive loss for CF, which can adaptively correct the positive and negative scores based on the popularity of users and items. Our approach aims to reduce the negative impact of popularity and sample bias simultaneously. We theoretically analyze the effectiveness of the proposed method and reveal the relationship between popularity and gradient, which justifies the correction strategy. We extensively evaluate our method on three public benchmarks over balanced and imbalanced settings. The results demonstrate its superiority over the existing debiased strategies, not only on the entire datasets but also when segmenting the datasets based on item popularity.|协同过滤(CF)是内隐反馈推荐的基本方法。最近，各种最先进的 CF 集成了图神经网络。然而，他们经常受到流行偏见的影响，导致推荐偏离用户的真实偏好。此外，为了有效地训练 CF 模型，人们提出了几种基于批内样本策略的对比学习方法，但这些方法容易产生样本偏差。为了解决这个问题，去偏对比度损失被用于推荐，但它不是个性化的去偏，它对每个用户一视同仁。本文提出了一种基于流行度的消偏对比度损失算法，该算法可以根据用户和项目的流行度自适应地修正正负分值。我们的方法旨在同时减少受欢迎程度和样本偏差的负面影响。从理论上分析了该方法的有效性，揭示了流行度与梯度的关系，从而验证了该方法的正确性。我们广泛评估我们的方法在三个公共基准平衡和不平衡的设置。实验结果表明，无论是在整个数据集上，还是在基于项目知名度的数据集分割上，该方法都优于现有的去偏策略。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=PopDCL:+Popularity-aware+Debiased+Contrastive+Loss+for+Collaborative+Filtering)|0|

In contrast, it remains unclear how to predict the future emerging aspects of a new product that currently has little review information. This task, which we named product aspect forecasting, is critical for recommending new products, but also challenging because of the missing reviews. Here, we propose ForeSeer, a novel textual mining and product embedding approach progressively trained on temporal product graphs for this novel product aspect forecasting task. ForeSeer transfers reviews from similar products on a large product graph and exploits these reviews to predict aspects that might emerge in future reviews. A key novelty of our method is to jointly provide review, product, and aspect embeddings that are both time-sensitive and less affected by extremely imbalanced aspect frequencies. We evaluated ForeSeer on a real-world product review system containing 11,536,382 reviews and 11,000 products over 3 years. We observe that ForeSeer substantially outperformed existing approaches with at least 49.1\% AUPRC improvement under the real setting where aspect associations are not given. ForeSeer further improves future link prediction on the product graph and the review aspect association prediction.

Consequently, numerous user-generated content is accumulated on social media platforms. These data usually contain rich information and knowledge for users, which is a viable source for user data mining. As one of the prevalent techniques in user data mining, mining personalized topics and discovering user preferences from social media data attract much interest in academic and industrial communities. The emerging Neural Topic Models(NTMs) have recently shown leading performance and scalability by employing neural networks. However, most existing NTMs usually model topics simply from observed document token information and do not explicitly take user preferences into the generative process, which inevitably fails to model personalized topics. To address this issue, we introduce Neural Personalized Topic Model(NPTM), a novel NTM that can discover personalized topics and user preferences. NPTM introduces a novel hybrid generative process for combining user preferences and contextualized document codes in modeling personalized topics. A transformer-based document encoder to obtain contextualized document codes. For user preference modeling, NPTM regards user-related information as trainable user embeddings, further determining user preferences over the topics. Following the proposed hybrid generative process, we present a module-wise asynchronous optimization strategy to get coherent topics and user preferences. Then, we apply our model to two challenging real-world social media post collections and compare them against several baseline methods to verify our contributions.

Graph-based recommendation methods (e.g., using graph neural networks) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for recommender systems, often outperforming traditional methods. However, existing techniques for alleviating the long-tail problem mainly focus on traditional methods. There is a lack of graph-based methods that can efficiently deal with the long-tail problem. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Graph Augmentation for Long-tail Recommendation (GALORE), which can be plugged into any graph-based recommendation models to improve the performance for tail items. GALORE incorporates an edge addition module that enriches the graph's connectivity for tail items by injecting additional item-to-item edges. To further balance the graph structure, GALORE utilizes a degree-aware edge dropping strategy, preserving the more valuable edges from the tail items while selectively discarding less informative edges from the head items. Beyond structural augmentation, we synthesize new data samples, thereby addressing the data scarcity issue for tail items. We further introduce a two-stage training strategy to facilitate the learning for both head and tail items. Comprehensive empirical studies conducted on four datasets show that GALORE outperforms existing methods in terms of the performance for tail items as well as the overall performance.|无处不在的固有用户行为的长尾分布导致用户记录较少的条目(即尾条目)的推荐性能低于用户记录较丰富的条目(即头条目)的推荐性能。基于图形的推荐方法(例如，使用图形神经网络)最近已经成为推荐系统的一个强大工具，其性能通常优于传统方法。然而，现有的解决长尾问题的技术主要集中在传统方法上。缺乏基于图论的方法来有效地处理长尾问题。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的方法，图增强的长尾推荐(GALORE) ，可以插入到任何基于图的推荐模型，以提高性能的尾项。GALORE 合并了一个边缘添加模块，通过注入额外的项目到项目的边缘，丰富了图形对尾部项目的连通性。为了进一步平衡图形结构，GALORE 使用了一种度感知的边缘丢弃策略，保留了尾部项目中更有价值的边缘，同时选择性地丢弃了头部项目中信息量较小的边缘。除了结构增强，我们还合成了新的数据样本，从而解决了尾部项目的数据稀缺问题。我们进一步引入了一个两阶段的训练策略，以促进头部和尾部项目的学习。对四个数据集进行的综合实证研究表明，GALORE 在尾部项目的性能以及整体性能方面优于现有的方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Improving+Long-Tail+Item+Recommendation+with+Graph+Augmentation)|0|

Recent multi-behavior recommendation frameworks contain two steps: fusion and prediction. In the fusion step, advanced neural networks are used to model the hierarchical correlations between user behaviors. In the prediction step, multiple signals are utilized to jointly optimize the model with a multi-task learning (MTL) paradigm. However, recent approaches have not addressed the issue caused by imbalanced data distribution in the fusion step, resulting in the learned relationships being dominated by high-frequency behaviors. In the prediction step, the existing methods use a gate mechanism to directly aggregate expert information generated by coupling input, leading to negative information transfer. To tackle these issues, we propose a Parallel Knowledge Enhancement Framework (PKEF) for multi-behavior recommendation. Specifically, we enhance the hierarchical information propagation in the fusion step using parallel knowledge (PKF). Meanwhile, in the prediction step, we decouple the representations to generate expert information and introduce a projection mechanism during aggregation to eliminate gradient conflicts and alleviate negative transfer (PME). We conduct comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets to validate the effectiveness of our model. The results further demonstrate the rationality and effectiveness of the designed PKF and PME modules.

Contrastive learning schemes such as SimCSE and ConSERT have already been adopted successfully in unsupervised sentence embedding to improve the quality of embeddings by reducing this bias. However, these methods still introduce new biases such as sentence length bias and false negative sample bias, that hinders model's ability to learn more fine-grained semantics. In this paper, we reexamine the challenges of contrastive sentence embedding learning from a debiasing perspective and argue that effectively eliminating the influence of various biases is crucial for learning high-quality sentence embeddings. We think all those biases are introduced by simple rules for constructing training data in contrastive learning and the key for contrastive learning sentence embedding is to mimic the distribution of training data in supervised machine learning in unsupervised way. We propose a novel contrastive framework for sentence embedding, termed DebCSE, which can eliminate the impact of these biases by an inverse propensity weighted sampling method to select high-quality positive and negative pairs according to both the surface and semantic similarity between sentences. Extensive experiments on semantic textual similarity (STS) benchmarks reveal that DebCSE significantly outperforms the latest state-of-the-art models with an average Spearman's correlation coefficient of 80.33% on BERTbase.|已有的研究表明，词频偏差可以导致 Bert 模型学习不可区分的句子嵌入。对比学习方法如 SimCSE 和 ConSERT 已经成功地应用于无监督句子嵌入中，通过减少这种偏差来提高嵌入质量。然而，这些方法仍然引入了新的偏差，如句子长度偏差和错误的否定样本偏差，阻碍了模型学习更细粒度语义的能力。本文从消除偏差的角度重新审视对比句嵌入学习的挑战，认为有效地消除各种偏差的影响对于学习高质量的句子嵌入是至关重要的。我们认为所有这些偏差都是由构建对比学习中的训练数据的简单规则引入的，而对比学习句子嵌入的关键是以无监督的方式模拟训练数据在监督式学习中的分布。我们提出了一个新的句子嵌入对比框架，称为 DebCSE，它可以消除这些偏见的影响，通过反倾向加权抽样方法，根据句子之间的表面和语义相似性选择高质量的正负对。对语义文本相似度(STS)测试的大量实验表明，DebCSE 的性能明显优于最新的最先进的模型，在 BERTbase 上 Spearman 的平均相关系数为80.33% 。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=DebCSE:+Rethinking+Unsupervised+Contrastive+Sentence+Embedding+Learning+in+the+Debiasing+Perspective)|0|

The challenges facing SBR consist mainly of how to utilize information other than the current session and how to reduce the negative impact of irrelevant information in the session data on the prediction. To address these challenges, we propose a novel graph attention network-based model called Multiple Sparse Graph Attention Networks (MSGAT). MSGAT leverages two parallel channels to model intra-session and inter-session information. In the intra-session channel, we utilize a gated graph neural network to perform initial encoding, followed by a self-attention mechanism to generate the target representation. The global representation is then noise-reduced based on the target representation. Additionally, the target representation is used as a medium to connect the two channels. In the inter-session channel, the noise-reduced relation representation is generated using the global attention mechanism of target perception. Moreover, MSGAT fully considers session similarity from the intent perspective by integrating valid information from both channels. Finally, the intent neighbor collaboration module effectively combines relevant information to enhance the current session representation. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate that simultaneous modeling of intra-session and inter-session data can effectively enhance the performance of the SBR model.|基于会话的推荐技术(SBS)由于能够根据匿名会话用户的交互序列提供个性化的推荐，近年来受到了广泛的关注。SBR 面临的挑战主要包括如何利用本届会议以外的信息，以及如何减少会议数据中不相关信息对预测的负面影响。为了应对这些挑战，我们提出了一种新的基于图注意网络的模型，称为多稀疏图注意网络(MSGAT)。MSGAT 利用两个并行通道对会话内和会话间信息建模。在会话内信道中，利用门控图神经网络进行初始编码，然后利用自注意机制生成目标表示。然后在目标表示的基础上对全局表示进行噪声抑制。此外，目标表示形式被用作连接两个通道的媒介。在会话间信道中，利用目标感知的全局注意机制生成降噪关系表示。此外，MSGAT 通过整合来自两个通道的有效信息，从意图的角度充分考虑了会话相似性。最后，意向邻居协作模块有效地结合了相关信息，增强了当前的会话表示。对五个数据集的大量实验表明，同时建模会话内和会话间数据可以有效地提高 SBR 模型的性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Bi-channel+Multiple+Sparse+Graph+Attention+Networks+for+Session-based+Recommendation)|0|

As a user usually takes many factors (e.g., fund theme, fund manager) into account when investing a fund and the fund usually consists of a substantial collection of investments, effectively modeling multi-interest representations is more crucial for personalized fund recommendation than the traditional goods recommendation. However, existing multi-interest methods are largely sub-optimal for fund recommendation, since they ignore financial domain knowledge and diverse fund investment intentions. In this work, we propose a Disentangled Interest importance aware Knowledge Graph Neural Network (DIKGNN) for personalized fund recommendation on FinTech platforms. In particular, we restrict the multiple intent spaces by introducing the attribute nodes from the fund knowledge graph as the minimum intent modeling unit to utilize financial domain knowledge and provide interpretability. In the intent space, we define disentangled intent representations, equipped with intent importance distributions to describe the diverse fund investment intentions. Then we design a new neighbor aggregation mechanism with the learned intent importance distribution upon the interaction graph and knowledge graph to collect multi-intent information. Furthermore, we leverage micro independence and macro balance constraints on the representations and distributions respectively to encourage intent independence and diversity. The extensive experiments on public recommendation benchmarks demonstrate that DIKGNN can achieve substantial improvement over state-of-the-art methods. Our proposed model is also evaluated over one real-world industrial fund dataset from a FinTech platform and has been deployed online.|目前，人们逐渐意识到财务管理的重要性，因此基金推荐越来越受到人们的重视，以帮助他们尽快找到合适的基金。由于投资者在投资基金时通常会考虑多种因素(如基金主题、基金经理等) ，而基金通常由大量的投资组合构成，因此有效地建立多利益表示模型对于个性化基金推荐比传统的商品推荐更为重要。然而，现有的多利率基金推荐方法由于忽视了金融领域的知识和基金投资意向的多样性，在很大程度上不能满足基金推荐的要求。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个分离利益重要性感知知识图神经网络(DIKGNN)个性化基金推荐在金融科技平台。特别地，我们通过引入基金知识图中的属性节点作为最小意图建模单元来限制多意图空间，以利用金融领域的知识并提供可解释性。在意向空间中，我们定义了非纠缠意向表示，并配备了意向重要性分布来描述不同的基金投资意向。然后设计了一种新的邻居聚集机制，在交互图和知识图上分布学习意图的重要性，以收集多意图信息。此外，我们利用微观独立性和宏观平衡约束分别表示和分布，以鼓励意向独立性和多样性。对公众推荐基准的广泛实验表明，DIKGNN 可以取得实质性的改善国家的最新方法。我们提出的模型也评估了一个来自金融科技平台的真实世界的工业基金数据集，并已在线部署。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Disentangled+Interest+importance+aware+Knowledge+Graph+Neural+Network+for+Fund+Recommendation)|0|

Despite the success of existing HGNNs, the utilization of the intricate semantic information in HGs is still insufficient. In this work, we study the problem of how to design powerful HGNNs under the guidance of node-dependent semantics. Specifically, to perform semantic search over HGNNs, we propose to develop semantic structures in terms of relation selection and connection selection, which could guide a task-relevant message flow. Furthermore, to better capture the diversified property of different node samples in HGs, we design predictors to adaptively decide the semantic structures per node. Extensive experiments on seven benchmarking datasets across different downstream tasks, i.e., node classification and recommendation, show that our method can consistently outperform various state-of-the-art baselines with shorter inference latency, which justifies its effectiveness and efficiency.

To stay current with evolving user interests, cloud-based recommender systems are periodically updated with new interaction data. However, on-device models struggle to retrain themselves because of limited onboard computing resources. As a solution, we consider the scenario where the model retraining occurs on the server side and then the updated parameters are transferred to edge devices via network communication. While this eliminates the need for local retraining, it incurs a regular transfer of parameters that significantly taxes network bandwidth. To mitigate this issue, we develop an efficient approach based on compositional codes to compress the model update. This approach ensures the on-device model is updated flexibly with minimal additional parameters whilst utilizing previous knowledge. The extensive experiments conducted on multiple session-based recommendation models with distinctive architectures demonstrate that the on-device model can achieve comparable accuracy to the retrained server-side counterpart through transferring an update 60x smaller in size.

Sample selection is a widely investigated research topic for handling noisy labels. However, most existing methods face challenges such as imprecise selection, a lack of global selection capabilities, and the need for tedious hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, we propose CoSaR (Collaborative Selection and adversarial Regularization ), a twin-networks based model that performs globally adaptive sample selection to tackle label noise. Specifically, the collaborative selection estimates the average distribution distances between predictions and generation labels through the collaboration of two networks to address the bias of the average distribution distances and the manual tuning of hyperparameters. Adversarial regularization is integrated into CoSaR to restrict the network's tendency to fit and memorize noisy labels, thereby enhancing its collaborative selection capability. In addition, we employ a label smoothing regularization and two types of data augmentation to enhance the robustness of the model further. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world noisy datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms baseline methods remarkably, with an accuracy improvement ranging between +0.56% and +15.14%.|对于深度学习模型来说，使用噪声标签进行学习是非常重要的。样本选择是一个广泛研究的课题，处理噪声标签。然而，大多数现有的方法都面临挑战，如选择不精确、缺乏全局选择能力以及需要冗长的超参数调优。本文提出了一种基于双网络的协同选择与对抗正则化(CoSaR)模型，该模型对标签噪声进行全局自适应样本选择。具体而言，协作选择通过两个网络的协作来估计预测和产生标签之间的平均分布距离，以解决平均分布距离的偏差和手动调整超参数。将对抗性规则化集成到 CoSaR 中，以限制网络适配和记忆噪声标签的倾向，从而增强其协同选择能力。此外，我们采用了标签平滑正则化和两种数据增强方法来进一步增强模型的鲁棒性。在合成和真实噪声数据集上的大量实验表明，该模型的性能明显优于基线方法，精度提高幅度在 + 0.56% 和 + 15.14% 之间。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=CoSaR:+Combating+Label+Noise+Using+Collaborative+Sample+Selection+and+Adversarial+Regularization)|0|

In this work, we propose a scalable sample-efficient neural contextual bandit algorithm for recommender systems. To do this, we design an epistemic neural network architecture, Epistemic Neural Recommendation (ENR), that enables Thompson sampling at a large scale.

Modality clues: personality traits are stable over time due to their genetic and environmental origins, resulting in stable personality traits in the multimodal data. Trait clues: multiple traits often co-occur with non-negligible correlations, which can collectively aid trait identification. To simultaneously capture the above psychological clues, we propose a novel Psychological Clues Exploration Network (PCENet) for multimodal personality assessment, which is a human-like judgment paradigm with more generalization capability. Specifically, we first devise a multimodal hierarchical disentanglement, which clearly aligns stable representations among different modalities and separates the mutability of each modality. Subsequently, a Transformer-backbone decoder equipped with modality-to-trait attention is exploited to adaptively generate a tailored representation for each trait with the guidance of trait semantics.

Most existing works focus on modeling user-item interactions only from the item level, ignoring that they are driven by latent shopping intentions (e.g., ballpoint pens, miniatures, etc). The detection of the underlying shopping intentions of users based on their historical interactions is a crucial aspect for e-commerce platforms, such as Amazon, to enhance the convenience and efficiency of their customers' shopping experiences. Despite its significance, the area of main shopping intention detection remains under-investigated in the academic literature. To fill this gap, we propose a graph-regularized stochastic Transformer method, G-STO. By considering intentions as sets of products and user preferences as compositions of intentions, we model both of them as stochastic Gaussian embeddings in the latent representation space. Instead of training the stochastic representations from scratch, we develop a global intention relational graph as prior knowledge for regularization, allowing relevant shopping intentions to be distributionally close. Finally, we feed the newly regularized stochastic embeddings into Transformer-based models to encode sequential information from the intention transitions. We evaluate our main shopping intention identification model on three different real-world datasets, where G-STO achieves significantly superior performances to the baselines by 18.08% in Hit@1, 7.01% in Hit@10, and 6.11% in NDCG@10 on average.|顺序推荐需要从用户的历史交互中理解用户行为、上下文和偏好的动态模式。大多数现有的作品只关注于从商品层次建模用户-商品交互，忽略了它们是由潜在的购物意图驱动的(例如，圆珠笔，微缩模型等)。基于用户历史交互的潜在购物意图的检测是亚马逊等电子商务平台提高用户购物体验的便利性和效率的一个关键方面。尽管其意义重大，主要的购物意图检测领域仍然没有得到充分的研究在学术文献。为了填补这个空白，我们提出了一个图正则化的随机变压器方法，G-STO。通过将意图看作是产品集合，将用户偏好看作是意图的组合，我们将两者建模为潜在表征空间中的随机高斯嵌入。我们不需要从头开始训练随机表示，而是开发一个全局意图关系图作为正则化的先验知识，允许相关的购物意图分布接近。最后，我们将新的正则化随机嵌入输入到基于变压器的模型中，从意图转换中编码序列信息。我们在三个不同的真实世界数据集上评估了我们的主要购物意向识别模型，其中 G-STO 在 Hit@1中的性能明显优于基线18.08% ，在 Hit@10中的性能为7.01% ，在 NDCG@10中的性能平均为6.11% 。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=G-STO:+Sequential+Main+Shopping+Intention+Detection+via+Graph-Regularized+Stochastic+Transformer)|0|

As most existing SBR models generally generate item representations based only on information propagation over the short sequence while ignoring additional valuable knowledge, their expressive abilities are somewhat limited by data sparsity caused by short sequence. Though there have been some attempts on utilizing items' attributes, they basically embed attributes into items directly, ignoring the fact that 1) there is no contextual relationship among attributes; and 2) users have varying levels of attention to different attributes, which still leads to unsatisfactory performance. To tackle the issues, we propose a novel Attribute-enhanced Dual Channel Representation Learning (ADRL) model for SBR, in which we independently model session representations in attribute-related pattern and sequence-related pattern. Specifically, we learn session representations with sequence patterns from the session graph, and we further design an frequency-driven attribute aggregator to generate the attribute-related session representations within a session. The proposed attribute aggregator is plug-and-play, as it can be coupled with most existing SBR models.

|[STGIN: Spatial-Temporal Graph Interaction Network for Large-scale POI Recommendation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615200)|Shaohua Liu, Yu Qi, Gen Li, Mingjian Chen, Teng Zhang, Jia Cheng, Jun Lei|Meituan, Shanghai, China|In Location-Based Services, Point-Of-Interest(POI) recommendation plays a crucial role in both user experience and business opportunities. Graph neural networks have been proven effective in providing personalized POI recommendation services. However, there are still two critical challenges. First, existing graph models attempt to capture users' diversified interests through a unified graph, which limits their ability to express interests in various spatial-temporal contexts. Second, the efficiency limitations of graph construction and graph sampling in large-scale systems make it difficult to adapt quickly to new real-time interests. To tackle the above challenges, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Graph Interaction Network. Specifically, we construct subgraphs of spatial, temporal, spatial-temporal, and global views respectively to precisely characterize the user's interests in various contexts. In addition, we design an industry-friendly framework to track the user's latest interests. Extensive experiments on the real-world dataset show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models. This work has been successfully deployed in a large e-commerce platform, delivering a 1.1% CTR and 6.3% RPM improvement.|在基于位置的服务中，兴趣点(POI)推荐在用户体验和商业机会中都扮演着至关重要的角色。图形神经网络在提供个性化 POI 推荐服务方面已被证明是有效的。然而，仍然存在两个关键的挑战。首先，现有的图模型试图通过一个统一的图来捕捉用户的多样化兴趣，这限制了用户在不同的时空背景下表达兴趣的能力。其次，在大规模系统中，由于图的构造和采样效率的限制，很难快速适应新的实时需求。为了解决上述问题，我们提出了一种新的时空图交互网络。具体来说，我们分别构造了空间、时间、空间-时间和全局视图的子图，以精确表征用户在不同情境下的兴趣。此外，我们还设计了一个行业友好的框架来跟踪用户的最新兴趣。在真实世界数据集上的大量实验表明，我们的方法优于最先进的模型。这项工作已经成功地部署在一个大型电子商务平台，提供了1.1% 的点击率和6.3% 的 RPM 改进。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=STGIN:+Spatial-Temporal+Graph+Interaction+Network+for+Large-scale+POI+Recommendation)|0|
|[FairGraph: Automated Graph Debiasing with Gradient Matching](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615176)|Yezi Liu|University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA|As a prevalence data structure in the real world, graphs have found extensive applications ranging from modeling social networks to molecules. However, the existence of diverse biases within graphs gives rise to unfair representations learned by graph neural networks (GNNs). Addressing this issue has typically been approached from a modeling perspective, which not only compromises the integrity of the model structure but also entails additional effort and cost for retraining model parameters when the architecture changes. In this study, we adopt a data-centric standpoint to tackle the problem of fairness, focusing on graph debiasing for Graph Neural Networks. Our specific objective is to eliminate various biases from the input graph by generating a fair synthetic graph. By training GNNs on this fair graph, we aim to achieve an optimal accuracy-fairness trade-off. To this end, we propose FairGraph, which approaches the graph debiasing problem by mimicking the GNN training trajectory of the input graph through an optimization process involving a gradient-matching loss and fairness constraints. Through extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of FairGraph and its ability to automatedly generate fair graphs that are transferable across different GNN architectures.|作为现实世界中流行的数据结构，图表已经发现了广泛的应用，从建模社会网络到分子。然而，图中存在不同的偏差会导致图神经网络学习到的不公平表示。解决这个问题通常是从建模的角度出发的，这不仅损害了模型结构的完整性，而且在体系结构发生变化时需要额外的努力和成本来重新训练模型参数。在本研究中，我们采用以数据为中心的观点来解决公平性问题，重点是图神经网络的图形消偏。我们的具体目标是通过生成一个公平的综合图来消除输入图中的各种偏差。通过在这个公平图上训练 GNN，我们的目标是实现最佳的精度-公平权衡。为此，我们提出了 FairGraph，它通过一个包含梯度匹配损失和公平约束的优化过程来模拟输入图的 GNN 训练轨迹，从而解决图的去偏问题。通过在三个基准数据集上进行的大量实验，我们证明了 FairGraph 的有效性及其自动生成可跨不同 GNN 架构转移的 Fair 图的能力。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=FairGraph:+Automated+Graph+Debiasing+with+Gradient+Matching)|0|

However, the existing systems are not tailored for meta learning based DLRM models and have critical problems regarding efficiency in distributed training in the GPU cluster. It is because the conventional deep learning pipeline is not optimized for two task-specific datasets and two update loops in meta learning. This paper provides a high-performance framework for large-scale training for Optimization-based Meta DLRM models over the G PU cluster, namely G -Meta. Firstly, G-Meta utilizes both data parallelism and model parallelism with careful orchestration regarding computation and communication efficiency, to enable high-speed distributed training. Secondly, it proposes a Meta-IO pipeline for efficient data ingestion to alleviate the I/O bottleneck. Various experimental results show that G-Meta achieves notable training speed without loss of statistical performance. Since early 2022, G-Meta has been deployed in Alipay's core advertising and recommender system, shrinking the continuous delivery of models by four times. It also obtains 6.48% improvement in Conversion Rate (CVR) and 1.06% increase in CPM (Cost Per Mille) in Alipay's homepage display advertising, with the benefit of larger training samples and tasks.|最近，一种新的学习模式元学习被广泛应用于深度学习推荐模型(DLRM) ，并显著提高了统计性能，特别是在冷启动情景下。然而，现有的系统并不适合基于元学习的 DLRM 模型，并且在 GPU 集群的分布式培训效率方面存在关键问题。这是因为传统的深度学习流水线没有针对元学习中的两个任务特定的数据集和两个更新循环进行优化。本文提供了一个在 G PU 集群上进行基于优化的元 DLRM 模型大规模培训的高性能框架，即 G-Meta。首先，G-Meta 利用了资料平行和模型的并行性，在计算和通信效率方面进行了精心的编排，从而实现了高速的分布式训练。其次，提出了一种有效的数据摄取元 IO 管道，以缓解 I/O 瓶颈。各种实验结果表明，G-Meta 在不损失统计性能的前提下，达到了显著的训练速度。自2022年初以来，g-Meta 一直部署在支付宝的核心广告和推荐系统中，将模型的持续交付缩减了4倍。在支付宝主页显示广告中，转化率(CVR)提高了6.48% ，每公里成本(CPM)提高了1.06% ，这些都得益于更大的培训样本和任务。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=G-Meta:+Distributed+Meta+Learning+in+GPU+Clusters+for+Large-Scale+Recommender+Systems)|0|

This results in the multi-type and multi-scenario CVR prediction problem. A desired model for this problem should satisfy the following requirements: 1) Accuracy: the model should achieve fine-grained accuracy with respect to any conversion type in any display scenario. 2) Scalability: the model parameter size should be affordable. 3) Convenience: the model should not require a large amount of effort in data partitioning, subset processing and separate storage. Existing approaches cannot simultaneously satisfy these requirements. For example, building a separate model for each (conversion type, display scenario) pair is neither scalable nor convenient. Building a unified model trained on all the data with conversion type and display scenario included as two features is not accurate enough. In this paper, we propose the Masked Multi-domain Network (MMN) to solve this problem. To achieve the accuracy requirement, we model domain-specific parameters and propose a dynamically weighted loss to account for the loss scale imbalance issue within each mini-batch. To achieve the scalability requirement, we propose a parameter sharing and composition strategy to reduce model parameters from a product space to a sum space. To achieve the convenience requirement, we propose an auto-masking strategy which can take mixed data from all the domains as input.

Given numerous users and items, incremental update becomes a mainstream paradigm for learning large-scale models in industrial scenarios, where only newly arrived data within a sliding window is fed into the model, meeting the strict requirements of quick response. However, this strategy would be prone to overfitting to newly arrived data. When there exists a significant drift of data distribution, the long-term information would be discarded, which harms the recommendation performance. Conventional methods address this issue through native model-based continual learning methods, without analyzing the data characteristics for online recommenders. To address the aforementioned issue, we propose an incremental update framework for online recommenders with Data-Driven Prior (DDP), which is composed of Feature Prior (FP) and Model Prior (MP). The FP performs the click estimation for each specific value to enhance the stability of the training process. The MP incorporates previous model output into the current update while strictly following the Bayes rules, resulting in a theoretically provable prior for the robust update. In this way, both the FP and MP are well integrated into the unified framework, which is model-agnostic and can accommodate various advanced interaction models.

Unlike other recommendation scenarios, short video recommendation systems heavily rely on feedback from watch time. Existing approaches simply treat watch time as a direct label, failing to effectively harness its extensive semantics and introduce bias, thereby limiting the potential for modeling user interests based on watch time. To overcome this challenge, we propose a framework named Debiasied Multiple-semantics-extracting Labeling (DML). DML constructs labels that encompass various semantics by utilizing quantiles derived from the distribution of watch time, prioritizing relative order rather than absolute label values. This approach facilitates easier model learning while aligning with the ranking objective of recommendations.

In this architecture, the pre-ranking model is expected to be a lightweight approximation of the ranking model, which handles more candidates with strict latency requirements. Due to the gap in model capacity, the pre-ranking and ranking models usually generate inconsistent ranked results, thus hurting the overall system effectiveness. The paradigm of score alignment is proposed to regularize their raw scores to be consistent. However, it suffers from inevitable alignment errors and error amplification by bids when applied in online advertising. To this end, we introduce a consistency-oriented pre-ranking framework for online advertising, which employs a chunk-based sampling module and a plug-and-play rank alignment module to explicitly optimize consistency of ECPM-ranked results. A $\Delta NDCG$-based weighting mechanism is adopted to better distinguish the importance of inter-chunk samples in optimization. Both online and offline experiments have validated the superiority of our framework. When deployed in Taobao display advertising system, it achieves an improvement of up to +12.3\% CTR and +5.6\% RPM.|为了平衡效率和效果，级联体系结构在大规模广告系统中得到了广泛的应用。在这种体系结构中，预排序模型被期望是排序模型的轻量级近似，它处理具有严格延迟要求的更多候选者。由于模型容量的差距，预排序模型和排序模型通常会产生不一致的排序结果，从而影响系统的整体有效性。提出了分数对齐的范式，以规范他们的原始分数是一致的。然而，在网络广告中应用时，不可避免地会出现一致性错误和出价放大错误。为此，我们引入了一个面向一致性的在线广告预排序框架，该框架采用基于块的抽样模块和即插即用的排序对齐模块来显式优化 ECPM 排序结果的一致性。为了更好地区分块间样本在优化中的重要性，采用了基于 $Delta NDCG 的加权机制。这两个在线和离线实验都验证了我们框架的优越性。在淘宝展示广告系统中，点击率和转速分别提高了12.3% 和5.6% 。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=COPR:+Consistency-Oriented+Pre-Ranking+for+Online+Advertising)|0|

To ensure accurate recommendation, agents usually ask for users' preferences towards specific product attributes which are pre-defined by humans.

In this work, we present AliMeMOSAIC, a novel knowledge mining and conversational assistance framework that extracts core product attributes from massive dialogue corpora for better conversational recommendation experience. It first extracts user-agent interaction utterances from massive corpora that contain product attributes. A Joint Attribute and Value Extraction (JAVE) network is designed to extract product attributes from user-agent interaction utterances. Finally, AliMeMOSAIC generates attribute sets that frequently appear in dialogues as the target attributes for agents to request, and serve as an assistant to guide the dialogue flow. To prove the effectiveness of AliMeMOSAIC, we show that it consistently improves the overall recommendation performance of our CRS system.

The tasks performed on such graphs are diverse and include detecting temporal trends, finding graph-to-graph similarities, and graph visualization and clustering. For all these tasks, it is necessary to embed the entire graph in a low-dimensional space by using graph-level representations instead of the more common node-level representations. This embedding requires handling the appearance of new nodes over time as well as capturing temporal patterns of the entire graph. Most existing methods perform temporal node embeddings and focus on different methods of aggregating them for a graph-based representation. In this work, we propose an end-to-end architecture that captures both the node embeddings and their influence in a structural context during a specific time period of the graph. We present GraphERT (Graph Embedding Representation using Transformers), a novel approach to temporal graph-level embeddings. Our method pioneers the use of Transformers to seamlessly integrate graph structure learning with temporal analysis. By employing a masked language model on sequences of graph random walks, together with a novel temporal classification task, our model not only comprehends the intricate graph dynamics but also unravels the temporal significance of each node and path.

|[How Expressive are Graph Neural Networks in Recommendation?](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614917)|Xuheng Cai, Lianghao Xia, Xubin Ren, Chao Huang|The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China|Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated superior performance on various graph learning tasks, including recommendation, where they leverage user-item collaborative filtering signals in graphs. However, theoretical formulations of their capability are scarce, despite their empirical effectiveness in state-of-the-art recommender models. Recently, research has explored the expressiveness of GNNs in general, demonstrating that message passing GNNs are at most as powerful as the Weisfeiler-Lehman test, and that GNNs combined with random node initialization are universal. Nevertheless, the concept of "expressiveness" for GNNs remains vaguely defined. Most existing works adopt the graph isomorphism test as the metric of expressiveness, but this graph-level task may not effectively assess a model's ability in recommendation, where the objective is to distinguish nodes of different closeness. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the expressiveness of GNNs in recommendation, considering three levels of expressiveness metrics: graph isomorphism (graph-level), node automorphism (node-level), and topological closeness (link-level). We propose the topological closeness metric to evaluate GNNs' ability to capture the structural distance between nodes, which aligns closely with the objective of recommendation. To validate the effectiveness of this new metric in evaluating recommendation performance, we introduce a learning-less GNN algorithm that is optimal on the new metric and can be optimal on the node-level metric with suitable modification. We conduct extensive experiments comparing the proposed algorithm against various types of state-of-the-art GNN models to explore the explainability of the new metric in the recommendation task.

While existing retrieval models have achieved impressive performance, they are mostly studied on static data sets, ignoring that in the real-world, the data on the Web is continuously growing with potential distribution drift. Consequently, retrievers trained on static old data may not suit new-coming data well and inevitably produce sub-optimal results. In this work, we study lifelong learning for first-stage retrieval, especially focusing on the setting where the emerging documents are unlabeled since relevance annotation is expensive and may not keep up with data emergence. Under this setting, we aim to develop model updating with two goals: (1) to effectively adapt to the evolving distribution with the unlabeled new-coming data, and (2) to avoid re-inferring all embeddings of old documents to efficiently update the index each time the model is updated. We first formalize the task and then propose a novel Lifelong Learning method for the first-stage Retrieval, namely L2R. L2R adopts the typical memory mechanism for lifelong learning, and incorporates two crucial components: (1) selecting diverse support negatives for model training and memory updating for effective model adaptation, and (2) a ranking alignment objective to ensure the backward-compatibility of representations to save the cost of index rebuilding without hurting the model performance. For evaluation, we construct two new benchmarks from LoTTE and Multi-CPR datasets to simulate the document distribution drift in realistic retrieval scenarios. Extensive experiments show that L^2R significantly outperforms competitive lifelong learning baselines.|第一阶段检索是一项关键任务，其目的是从大规模的文档集合中检索相关的候选文档。虽然现有的检索模型已经取得了令人印象深刻的性能，但它们大多是在静态数据集上进行研究，忽略了在现实世界中，Web 上的数据随着潜在的分布漂移而不断增长。因此，对静态旧数据进行训练的检索器可能不能很好地适应新数据，并不可避免地产生次优结果。在这项工作中，我们研究了第一阶段检索的终身学习，特别关注于新出现的文档没有标记的情况，因为相关注释的成本很高，而且可能跟不上数据出现的速度。在这种情况下，我们的目标是开发模型更新有两个目标: (1)有效地适应演化的分布与未标记的新来的数据，(2)避免重新推断所有嵌入的旧文档，以有效地更新索引每次模型更新。我们首先将任务形式化，然后为第一阶段的检索提出一种新的终身学习方法，即 L2R。L2R 采用了典型的终身学习记忆机制，包括两个关键部分: (1)选择不同的支持否定来进行模型训练和记忆更新，以便有效地进行模型适应; (2)排序对齐目标，以确保表征的向后兼容性，从而在不损害模型性能的情况下节省索引重建的成本。为了进行评估，我们从 LoTTE 和 Multi-CPR 数据集中构建了两个新的基准来模拟真实检索场景中的文档分布漂移。大量实验表明，L ^ 2R 的表现明显优于竞争性的终身学习基线。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=L2R:+Lifelong+Learning+for+First-stage+Retrieval+with+Backward-Compatible+Representations)|0|

In this paper, we propose a novel Error-Correction Constituent Parsing (ECCP) task which uses the constituent parsing of corrected sentences to avoid the harmful effect of the erroneous sentence. We also propose an architecture that includes one encoder and two decoders. There are millions of parameters in transformer-based GEC models, and the labeled training data is substantially less than synthetic pre-training data. Therefore, adapter layers are added to the proposed architecture, and adapter tuning is used for fine-tuning our model to alleviate the low-resource issue. We conduct experiments on CoNLL-2014, BEA-2019, and JFLEG test datasets in unsupervised and supervised settings. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the-state-of-art baselines and achieves superior performance on all datasets.|语法错误纠正(GEC)通常被认为是一个翻译任务，其中错误的句子被视为源语言，被纠正的句子被视为目标语言。目前最先进的 GEC 模型通常采用基于变压器的序列到序列的机器翻译体系结构。然而，这些方法大多忽略了句法信息，因为错误句子的句法也充满了错误，不利于 GEC。本文提出了一种新的纠错成分分析(ECCP)任务，利用纠错句的成分分析来避免错误句的有害影响。我们还提出了一个包括一个编码器和两个解码器的体系结构。在基于变压器的 GEC 模型中有数百万个参数，标记的训练数据大大少于合成的训练前数据。因此，将适配器层添加到提出的体系结构中，并使用适配器调优来微调我们的模型，以缓解资源不足的问题。我们在 CoNLL-2014、 BEA-2019和 JFLEG 测试数据集上进行了无监督和监督环境下的实验。实验结果表明，该方法的性能优于现有的基线方法，在所有数据集上都取得了较好的性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Incorporating+Constituent+Syntax+into+Grammatical+Error+Correction+with+Multi-Task+Learning)|0|

Great efforts have been made on this task with competitive performance, however, they usually treat the two subtasks, namely span detection and type classification, as mutually independent, and the integrity and correlation between subtasks have been largely ignored. Moreover, prior arts may fail to absorb the coarse-grained features of entities, resulting in a semantic-insufficient representation of entity types. To that end, in this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Enhancing ProtoNet (HEProto) based on multi-task learning, which is utilized to jointly learn these two subtasks and model their correlation. Specifically, we adopt contrastive learning to enhance the span boundary information and the type semantic representations in these two subtasks. Then, the hierarchical prototypical network is designed to leverage the coarse-grained information of entities in the type classification stage, which could help the model to better learn the fine-grained semantic representations. Along this line, we construct a similarity margin loss to reduce the similarity between fine-grained entities and other irrelevant coarse-grained prototypes. Finally, extensive experiments on the Few-NERD dataset prove that our solution outperforms competitive baseline methods.

It has achieved solid performance on many ad-hoc retrieval tasks. So far, these tasks have assumed a static document collection. In many practical scenarios, however, document collections are dynamic, where new documents are continuously added to the corpus. The ability to incrementally index new documents while preserving the ability to answer queries with both previously and newly indexed relevant documents is vital to applying GR models. In this paper, we address this practical continual learning problem for GR. We put forward a novel Continual-LEarner for generatiVE Retrieval (CLEVER) model and make two major contributions to continual learning for GR: (i) To encode new documents into docids with low computational cost, we present Incremental Product Quantization, which updates a partial quantization codebook according to two adaptive thresholds; and (ii) To memorize new documents for querying without forgetting previous knowledge, we propose a memory-augmented learning mechanism, to form meaningful connections between old and new documents.

In recent years, neural retrievers based on pre-trained language models (PLM), such as dual-encoders, have achieved huge success. Yet, studies have found that the performance of dual-encoders are often limited due to the neglecting of the interaction information between queries and candidate passages. Therefore, various interaction paradigms have been proposed to improve the performance of vanilla dual-encoders. Particularly, recent state-of-the-art methods often introduce late-interaction during the model inference process. However, such late-interaction based methods usually bring extensive computation and storage cost on large corpus. Despite their effectiveness, the concern of efficiency and space footprint is still an important factor that limits the application of interaction-based neural retrieval models. To tackle this issue, we Incorporate Implicit Interaction into dual-encoders, and propose I3 retriever. In particular, our implicit interaction paradigm leverages generated pseudo-queries to simulate query-passage interaction, which jointly optimizes with query and passage encoders in an end-to-end manner. It can be fully pre-computed and cached, and its inference process only involves simple dot product operation of the query vector and passage vector, which makes it as efficient as the vanilla dual encoders. We conduct comprehensive experiments on MSMARCO and TREC2019 Deep Learning Datasets, demonstrating the I3 retriever's superiority in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. Moreover, the proposed implicit interaction is compatible with special pre-training and knowledge distillation for passage retrieval, which brings a new state-of-the-art performance.

However, the key issue currently limiting the application of diffusion models is its extremely slow generation process. Although several methods were proposed to speed up the generation process, there still exists a trade-off between efficiency and quality. In this paper, we first provide a detailed theoretical and empirical analysis of the generation process of the diffusion models based on schedulers. We transform the designing problem of schedulers into the determination of several parameters, and further transform the accelerated generation process into an expansion process of the linear subspace. Based on these analyses, we consequently propose a novel method called Optimal Linear Subspace Search (OLSS), which accelerates the generation process by searching for the optimal approximation process of the complete generation process in the linear subspaces spanned by latent variables. OLSS is able to generate high-quality images with a very small number of steps. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct extensive comparative experiments on open-source diffusion models. Experimental results show that with a given number of steps, OLSS can significantly improve the quality of generated images. Using an NVIDIA A100 GPU, we make it possible to generate a high-quality image by Stable Diffusion within only one second without other optimization techniques.|近年来，扩散模型已经成为图像合成领域中最流行、最有力的方法，甚至在艺术创造力方面可以与人类艺术家相媲美。然而，目前限制扩散模型应用的关键问题是其生成过程极其缓慢。虽然提出了几种方法来加快生成过程，但仍然存在效率和质量之间的平衡。本文首先对基于调度器的扩散模型的生成过程进行了详细的理论和实证分析。将调度器的设计问题转化为多个参数的确定问题，并将加速生成过程进一步转化为线性子空间的展开过程。在此基础上，提出了一种新的最优线性子空间搜索(OLSS)方法，该方法通过在潜变量跨度的线性子空间中搜索完全生成过程的最优逼近过程来加速生成过程。OLSS 只需很少的步骤就能生成高质量的图像。为了证明我们方法的有效性，我们对开源扩散模型进行了广泛的比较实验。实验结果表明，在给定步长的情况下，OLSS 可以显著提高图像的质量。使用 NVIDIA A100图形处理器，我们可以在不使用其他优化技术的情况下，通过稳定扩散在仅仅一秒钟内生成高质量的图像。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Optimal+Linear+Subspace+Search:+Learning+to+Construct+Fast+and+High-Quality+Schedulers+for+Diffusion+Models)|0|

By conducting shilling attacks on recommender systems, the attackers aim to have homogeneous impacts on all users. However, such indiscriminate attacks suffer from a waste of resources because even if the target item is promoted to users who are not interested, they are unlikely to click on them. In this paper, we conduct targeted shilling attacks in GNN-based recommender systems. By automatically constructing the features and edges of the fake users, our proposed framework AutoAttack achieves accurate attacks on a specific group of users while minimizing the impact on non-target users. Specifically, the features of fake users are generated based on a similarity function, which is optimized according to the features of target users. The structure of fake users is learned by conducting spectral clustering on the target users based on their graph Laplacian matrix, which contains the degree and adjacency information that provides guidance to the edge generation of fake users. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets in different GNN-based RS and evaluate the performance of our method on the shilling attack and recommendation tasks comprehensively, showing the effectiveness and flexibility of our framework.|在最近的研究中，基于 GNN 的推荐系统已经显示了它们对先令攻击的脆弱性。通过对推荐系统进行先令式攻击，攻击者的目标是对所有用户产生同样的影响。然而，这种不分青红皂白的攻击造成资源浪费，因为即使目标项目被推广给不感兴趣的用户，他们也不太可能点击这些项目。本文在基于 GNN 的推荐系统中进行有针对性的先令攻击。通过自动构造虚假用户的特征和边缘，我们提出的框架自动攻击实现了对特定用户群的准确攻击，同时最小化了对非目标用户的影响。具体来说，基于相似度函数生成虚假用户的特征，并根据目标用户的特征进行优化。虚假用户的结构是通过基于目标用户的图形 SVD 来了解的，图形 Laplacian Matrix 包含程度和邻接信息，为虚假用户的边缘生成提供指导。我们在四个不同的基于 GNN 的 RS 的真实世界数据集上进行了广泛的实验，全面评估了我们的方法在先令攻击和推荐任务上的性能，显示了我们的框架的有效性和灵活性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Targeted+Shilling+Attacks+on+GNN-based+Recommender+Systems)|0|
|[Robust Basket Recommendation via Noise-tolerated Graph Contrastive Learning](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615039)|Xinrui He, Tianxin Wei, Jingrui He|University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, USA|The growth of e-commerce has seen a surge in popularity of platforms like Amazon, eBay, and Taobao. This has given rise to a unique shopping behavior involving baskets - sets of items purchased together. As a less studied interaction mode in the community, the question of how should shopping basket complement personalized recommendation systems remains under-explored. While previous attempts focused on jointly modeling user purchases and baskets, the distinct semantic nature of these elements can introduce noise when directly integrated. This noise negatively impacts the model's performance, further exacerbated by significant noise (e.g., a user is misled to click an item or recognizes it as uninteresting after consuming it) within both user and basket behaviors. In order to cope with the above difficulties, we propose a novel Basket recommendation framework via Noise-tolerated Contrastive Learning, named BNCL, to handle the noise existing in the cross-behavior integration and within-behavior modeling. First, we represent the basket-item interactions as the hypergraph to model the complex basket behavior, where all items appearing in the same basket are treated as a single hyperedge. Second, cross-behavior contrastive learning is designed to suppress the noise during the fusion of diverse behaviors. Next, to further inhibit the within-behavior noise of the user and basket interactions, we propose to exploit invariant properties of the recommenders w.r.t augmentations through within-behavior contrastive learning. A novel consistency-aware augmentation approach is further designed to better identify the noisy interactions with the consideration of the above two types of interactions. Our framework BNCL offers a generic training paradigm that is applicable to different backbones. Extensive experiments on three shopping transaction datasets verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.|随着电子商务的发展，像亚马逊、 eBay 和淘宝这样的平台越来越受欢迎。这就产生了一种独特的购物行为，包括一篮子一套的商品一起购买。作为一种研究较少的社区互动模式，购物篮应该如何补充个性化推荐系统的问题仍然没有得到充分的探讨。虽然以前的尝试侧重于联合建模用户购买和购物篮，但是当直接集成时，这些元素独特的语义特性可能会引入噪音。这种噪音会对模型的性能产生负面影响，而在用户和购物篮的行为中，显著的噪音会进一步加剧这种影响(例如，用户被误导去点击一个项目，或者在消费之后认为它没有意思)。为了克服上述困难，我们提出了一种新的基于噪声容忍对比学习的 Basket 推荐框架 BNCL，用于处理跨行为集成和行为内建模中存在的噪声。首先，我们将篮子项目的交互作用表示为超图来模拟复杂的篮子行为，其中出现在同一个篮子中的所有项目都被视为一个单一的超边。其次，设计交叉行为对比学习来抑制不同行为融合过程中的噪声。接下来，为了进一步抑制用户和篮子交互的行为内噪声，我们建议通过行为内对比学习来利用推荐者 w.r.t 增强的不变性。进一步设计了一种新的一致性增强方法，以便在考虑上述两类相互作用的情况下更好地识别噪声相互作用。我们的框架 BNCL 提供了一个通用的培训范例，适用于不同的骨干。在三个购物交易数据集上的大量实验验证了该方法的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Robust+Basket+Recommendation+via+Noise-tolerated+Graph+Contrastive+Learning)|0|

The item selection strategy is the core component of CAT, which searches for the best suitable test item based on students' current estimated ability at each test step. However, existing selection strategies behave in a brute-force manner, which results in the time complexity being linear to the number of items (N) in the item pool, i.e., O(N). Thus, in reality, the search latency becomes the bottleneck for CAT with a large-scale item pool. To this end, we propose a Search-Efficient Computerized Adaptive Testing framework (SECAT), which aims at enhancing CAT with an efficient selection strategy. Specifically, SECAT contains two main phases: item pool indexing and item search. In the item pool indexing phase, we apply a student-aware spatial partition method on the item pool to divide the test items into many sub-spaces, considering the adaptability of test items. In the item search phase, we optimize the traditional single-round search strategy with the asymptotic theory and propose a multi-round search strategy that can further improve the time efficiency. Compared with existing strategies, the time complexity of SECAT decreases from O(N) to O(logN). Across two real-world datasets, SECAT achieves over 200x speed up with negligible accuracy degradation.|计算机自适应测试(CAT)作为一种新兴的网络教育个性化测试模式，旨在通过自适应选择测试项目来揭示学生的潜在知识状态。试题选择策略是计算机辅助测试(CAT)的核心组成部分，它根据学生在每个测试步骤中的当前估计能力来寻找最适合的试题。然而，现有的选择策略表现出一种蛮力的方式，导致时间复杂度与项目池中的项目数(N)成线性关系，即 O (N)。因此，在现实中，搜索延迟成为大规模项目池 CAT 的瓶颈。为此，我们提出了一个搜索效率高的计算机自适应测试框架(SECAT) ，旨在通过一种有效的选择策略来增强 CAT。具体来说，SECAT 包含两个主要阶段: 项目池索引和项目搜索。在试题库索引阶段，考虑试题的适应性，在试题库上采用学生感知的空间划分方法，将试题划分为多个子空间。在项目搜索阶段，我们利用渐近理论优化了传统的单轮搜索策略，并提出了多轮搜索策略，进一步提高了时间效率。与已有策略相比，SECAT 的时间复杂度从 O (N)降低到 O (logN)。通过两个真实世界的数据集，SECAT 在可以忽略不计的精度降低的情况下实现了超过200倍的速度。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Search-Efficient+Computerized+Adaptive+Testing)|0|

In this paper, we fill this gap and propose a Celebrity-aware Graph Contrastive Learning Framework for Social Recommendation (CGCL), which explicitly models the celebrity effect in the social domain. Technically, we measure the different influences of celebrity and ordinary nodes by mining social network structure features, such as closeness centrality. To model the celebrity effect in social networks, we design a novel user-user impact-aware aggregation method, which incorporates the celebrity-aware influence information into the message propagation process. Additionally, we design a graph neural network-based framework which incorporates social semantics into the user-item interaction modeling with contrastive learning-enhanced data augmentation. The experimental results on three real-world datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

|[Independent Distribution Regularization for Private Graph Embedding](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614933)|Qi Hu, Yangqiu Song|HKUST, Hong Kong, Hong Kong|Learning graph embeddings is a crucial task in graph mining tasks. An effective graph embedding model can learn low-dimensional representations from graph-structured data for data publishing benefiting various downstream applications such as node classification, link prediction, etc. However, recent studies have revealed that graph embeddings are susceptible to attribute inference attacks, which allow attackers to infer private node attributes from the learned graph embeddings. To address these concerns, privacy-preserving graph embedding methods have emerged, aiming to simultaneously consider primary learning and privacy protection through adversarial learning. However, most existing methods assume that representation models have access to all sensitive attributes in advance during the training stage, which is not always the case due to diverse privacy preferences. Furthermore, the commonly used adversarial learning technique in privacy-preserving representation learning suffers from unstable training issues. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Private Variational Graph AutoEncoders (PVGAE) with the aid of independent distribution penalty as a regularization term. Specifically, we split the original variational graph autoencoder (VGAE) to learn sensitive and non-sensitive latent representations using two sets of encoders. Additionally, we introduce a novel regularization to enforce the independence of the encoders. We prove the theoretical effectiveness of regularization from the perspective of mutual information. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that PVGAE outperforms other baselines in private embedding learning regarding utility performance and privacy protection.|图嵌入学习是图挖掘任务中的一个关键问题。一个有效的图嵌入模型可以从图结构化数据中学习低维表示，用于数据发布，有利于各种下游应用，如节点分类、链路预测等。然而，最近的研究表明，图嵌入容易受到属性推理攻击，使攻击者能够从学习的图嵌入中推断出私有节点的属性。为了解决这些问题，出现了保护隐私的图嵌入方法，旨在同时考虑初级学习和通过对抗学习保护隐私。然而，现有的大多数方法都假设表示模型在训练阶段可以提前访问所有敏感属性，但由于隐私偏好的不同，这种假设并不总是成立。此外，隐私保护表征学习中常用的对抗学习技术存在不稳定的训练问题。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的方法称为私有变分图自动编码器(PVGAE)的援助下，独立分布罚金作为一个正则化项。具体来说，我们将原始的变分图自动编码器(VGAE)分离，使用两组编码器来学习敏感和非敏感的潜在表示。此外，我们还引入了一种新的正则化方法来增强编码器的独立性。从互信息的角度证明了正则化的理论有效性。在三个实际数据集上的实验结果表明，PVGAE 在效用性能和隐私保护方面优于其他基线的私有嵌入学习。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Independent+Distribution+Regularization+for+Private+Graph+Embedding)|0|

The complex dynamic spatial-temporal dependencies among traffic objects (e.g., sensors and road segments) have been calling for highly flexible models; unfortunately, sophisticated models may suffer from poor robustness especially in capturing the trend of the time series (1st-order derivatives with time), leading to unrealistic forecasts. To address the challenge of balancing dynamics and robustness, we propose TrendGCN, a new scheme that extends the flexibility of GCNs and the distribution-preserving capacity of generative and adversarial loss for handling sequential data with inherent statistical correlations. On the one hand, our model simultaneously incorporates spatial (node-wise) embeddings and temporal (time-wise) embeddings to account for heterogeneous space-and-time convolutions; on the other hand, it uses GAN structure to systematically evaluate statistical consistencies between the real and the predicted time series in terms of both the temporal trending and the complex spatial-temporal dependencies. Compared with traditional approaches that handle step-wise predictive errors independently, our approach can produce more realistic and robust forecasts.

|[Replace Scoring with Arrangement: A Contextual Set-to-Arrangement Framework for Learning-to-Rank](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615031)|Jiarui Jin, Xianyu Chen, Weinan Zhang, Mengyue Yang, Yang Wang, Yali Du, Yong Yu, Jun Wang|Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China; East China Normal University, Shanghai, China; University College London, London, United Kingdom; King's College London, London, United Kingdom|Learning-to-rank is a core technique in the top-N recommendation task, where an ideal ranker would be a mapping from an item set to an arrangement (a.k.a. permutation). Most existing solutions fall in the paradigm of probabilistic ranking principle (PRP), i.e., first score each item in the candidate set and then perform a sort operation to generate the top ranking list. However, these approaches neglect the contextual dependence among candidate items during individual scoring, and the sort operation is non-differentiable. To bypass the above issues, we propose Set-To-Arrangement Ranking (STARank), a new framework directly generates the permutations of the candidate items without the need for individually scoring and sort operations; and is end-to-end differentiable. As a result, STARank can operate when only the ground-truth permutations are accessible without requiring access to the ground-truth relevance scores for items. For this purpose, STARank first reads the candidate items in the context of the user browsing history, whose representations are fed into a Plackett-Luce module to arrange the given items into a list. To effectively utilize the given ground-truth permutations for supervising STARank, we leverage the internal consistency property of Plackett-Luce models to derive a computationally efficient list-wise loss. Experimental comparisons against 9 the state-of-the-art methods on 2 learning-to-rank benchmark datasets and 3 top-N real-world recommendation datasets demonstrate the superiority of STARank in terms of conventional ranking metrics. Notice that these ranking metrics do not consider the effects of the contextual dependence among the items in the list, we design a new family of simulation-based ranking metrics, where existing metrics can be regarded as special cases. STARank can consistently achieve better performance in terms of PBM and UBM simulation-based metrics.|学习排名是排名前 N 的推荐任务中的一项核心技术，理想的排名应该是从一个项目集到一个排列(又称排列)的映射。大多数现有的解决方案属于概率排序原则(PRP)的范式，即首先给候选集中的每个项目打分，然后执行排序操作来生成最高排名列表。然而，这些方法忽略了个体评分过程中候选项之间的上下文依赖性，且排序操作是不可微的。为了绕过上述问题，我们提出了一个新的框架集到排列排序(STARank) ，它直接生成候选项的排列，而不需要单独的评分和排序操作，并且是端到端可微的。因此，STARank 可以在只有地面真相排列可以访问时运行，而不需要访问项目的地面真相相关分数。为此，STARank 首先在用户浏览历史记录的上下文中读取候选项，其表示被提供给 Plackett-Luce 模块，以便将给定的项排列成列表。为了有效地利用给定的地面真理排列来监督 STARank，我们利用 Plackett-Luce 模型的内部一致性特性来导出一个计算有效的列表损失。通过对2个学习排名基准数据集和3个排名前 N 的实际推荐数据集的9种最新方法的实验比较，证明了 STARank 在常规排名指标方面的优越性。请注意，这些排名指标没有考虑列表中项目之间的上下文相关性的影响，我们设计了一个新的基于模拟的排名指标家族，其中现有的指标可以被视为特殊情况。STARank 在基于 PBM 和基于 UBM 仿真的度量方面能够持续地获得更好的性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Replace+Scoring+with+Arrangement:+A+Contextual+Set-to-Arrangement+Framework+for+Learning-to-Rank)|0|
|[Real-time Emotion Pre-Recognition in Conversations with Contrastive Multi-modal Dialogue Pre-training](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615024)|Xincheng Ju, Dong Zhang, Suyang Zhu, Junhui Li, Shoushan Li, Guodong Zhou|Soochow University, Suzhou, China|This paper presents our pioneering effort in addressing a new and realistic scenario in multi-modal dialogue systems called Multi-modal Real-time Emotion Pre-recognition in Conversations (MREPC). The objective is to predict the emotion of a forthcoming target utterance that is highly likely to occur. We believe that this task can enhance the dialogue system's understanding of the interlocutor's state of mind, enabling it to prepare an appropriate response in advance. However, addressing MREPC poses the following challenges:1) Previous studies on emotion elicitation typically focus on textual modality and perform sentiment forecasting within a fixed contextual scenario. 2) Previous studies on multi-modal emotion recognition aim to predict the emotion of existing utterances, making it difficult to extend these approaches to MREPC due to the absence of the target utterance. To tackle these challenges, we construct two benchmark multi-modal datasets for MREPC and propose a task-specific multi-modal contrastive pre-training approach. This approach leverages large-scale unlabeled multi-modal dialogues to facilitate emotion pre-recognition for potential utterances of specific target speakers. Through detailed experiments and extensive analysis, we demonstrate that our proposed multi-modal contrastive pre-training architecture effectively enhances the performance of multi-modal real-time emotion pre-recognition in conversations.|本文介绍了我们在处理多模态对话系统中的一个新的和现实的场景，称为多模态实时情绪会话预识别(MREPC)的开拓性工作。目的是预测一个即将到来的目标话语的情绪，这是非常可能发生的。我们相信，这一任务可以提高对话系统对对话者心理状态的理解，使其能够提前准备好适当的应对措施。然而，解决 MREPC 问题带来了以下挑战: 1)以往的情绪诱发研究主要集中在语篇情态上，在固定的语境情景下进行情绪预测。2)以往对多模态情绪识别的研究主要是针对已有话语的情绪预测，但由于目标话语的缺失，这些方法难以推广到 MREPC。为了应对这些挑战，我们构建了两个基准的 MREPC 多模态数据集，并提出了一种针对特定任务的多模态对比预训练方法。该方法利用大规模未标记的多模态对话，促进对特定目标说话人潜在话语的情感预识别。通过详细的实验和广泛的分析表明，本文提出的多模态对比预训练结构有效地提高了会话中多模态实时情绪预识别的性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Real-time+Emotion+Pre-Recognition+in+Conversations+with+Contrastive+Multi-modal+Dialogue+Pre-training)|0|

CTR prediction models are typically trained on user click data from traffic logs. However, users are more likely to interact with items that were shown prominently on a website. CTR models often over-estimate the value of such items and show them more often, at the expense of items of higher quality that were previously shown at less prominent positions. This self-reinforcing position bias effect reduces both the immediate and long-term quality of recommendations for users. In this paper, we revisit position bias in a family of state-of-the-art neural models for CTR prediction, and use synthetic data to demonstrate the difficulty of controlling for position. We propose an approach that encourages neural networks to use position (or other confounding variables) as much as possible to explain the training data, and a metric that can directly measure bias.

Rivero|Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, NY, USA|In link prediction evaluation, an embedding model assigns plausibility scores to unseen triples in a knowledge graph using an input partial triple. Performance metrics like mean rank are useful to compare models side by side, but do not shed light on their behavior. Interpreting link prediction evaluation and comparing models based on such interpretation are appealing. Current interpretation methods have mainly focused on single predictions or other tasks different from link prediction. Since knowledge graph embedding methods are diverse, interpretation methods that are applicable only to certain machine learning approaches cannot be used. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic method for interpreting link prediction evaluation as a whole. The interpretation consists of Horn rules mined from the knowledge graph containing the triples a model deems plausible. We combine precision and recall measurements of mined rules using Fβ score to quantify interpretation accuracy. To maximize interpretation accuracy when comparing models, we study two approximations to the hard problem of merging rules. Our quantitative study shows that interpretation accuracy serves to compare diverse models side by side, and that these comparisons are different from those using ranks. Our qualitative study shows that several models globally capture expected semantics, and that models make a common set of predictions despite of redundancy reduction.|在链接预测评价中，嵌入模型使用输入部分三元组将合理性分值赋给知识图中的未知三元组。像平均排名这样的性能指标对于并排比较模型很有用，但是不能说明它们的行为。解释链接预测评价和基于这种解释的比较模型是很有吸引力的。目前的解释方法主要集中在单个预测或其他不同于链接预测的任务。由于知识图嵌入方法多种多样，不能采用仅适用于某些机器学习方法的解释方法。本文提出了一种从整体上解释链路预测评价的模型不可知方法。解释包括从知识图中挖掘的 Horn 规则，其中包含模型认为合理的三元组。我们结合了准确率召回率挖掘规则的测量结果，使用 Fβ 评分来量化解释的准确性。为了在比较模型时最大限度地提高解释的准确性，我们研究了合并规则这一难题的两个近似值。我们的定量研究表明，解释的准确性服务于比较不同的模型并排，这些比较是不同的使用等级。我们的定性研究表明，几个模型全局捕获预期的语义，模型作出了一个共同的预测集，尽管冗余减少。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=A+Model-Agnostic+Method+to+Interpret+Link+Prediction+Evaluation+of+Knowledge+Graph+Embeddings)|0|

To address such issues, we propose a knowledge enhanced Graph Attention Network (GAT) under multi-task learning setting.

Moreover, to tackle the issue of noisy clinical notes, we propose to utilize the rich structured knowledge facts and information provided by medical domain knowledge, thereby encouraging the model to focus on the clinical notes' noteworthy portion and valuable information.

By formulating this task as a Markov decision process, reinforcement learning (RL) methods have demonstrated great power. Although extensive research efforts have been made, previous methods still fail to recommend effective goal-oriented paths due to the under-utilizing of goals. Specifically, it is mainly reflected in two aspects: (1)The lack of goal planning. When learners have multiple goals with different difficulties, the previous methods can't fully utilize the difficulties and dependencies between goal learning items to plan the sequence of achieving these goals, making the path chaotic and inefficient; (2)The lack of efficiency in goal achieving. When pursuing a single goal, the path may contain learning items unrelated to the goal, which makes realizing a certain goal inefficient. To address these challenges, we present a novel Graph Enhanced Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (GEHRL) framework for goal-oriented learning path recommendation. The framework divides learning path recommendation into two parts: sub-goal selection(planning) and sub-goal achieving(learning item recommendation). Specifically, we employ a high-level agent as a sub-goal selector to select sub-goals for the low-level agent to achieve. The low-level agent in the framework is to recommend learning items to the learner. To make the path only contain goal-related learning items to improve the efficiency of achieving the goal, we develop a graph-based candidate selector to constrain the action space of the low-level agent based on the sub-goal and knowledge graph. We also develop test-based internal reward for low-level training so that the sparsity problem of external reward can be alleviated. Extensive experiments on three different simulators demonstrate our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance.|目标导向学习路径推荐旨在向学习者逐步推荐学习项目(概念或练习) ，以提高其对特定学习目标的掌握程度。通过把这个任务作为一个马可夫决策过程，强化学习(RL)方法已经证明了它的巨大威力。尽管已经做了大量的研究工作，以往的方法仍然不能推荐有效的目标导向的路径，由于目标利用不足。具体来说，主要体现在两个方面: (1)目标规划的缺失。当学习者有不同困难的多个目标时，以往的方法不能充分利用目标学习项目之间的困难和依赖关系来规划实现这些目标的顺序，使得路径混乱和效率低下; (2)目标实现效率低下。在追求单一目标时，路径中可能包含与目标无关的学习项，使得实现某一目标效率低下。为了应对这些挑战，我们提出了一个新的图形增强层次强化学习(GEHRL)框架，用于面向目标的学习路径推荐。该框架将学习路径推荐分为子目标选择(规划)和子目标实现(学习项目推荐)两部分。具体来说，我们使用高级代理作为子目标选择器，为低级代理选择要实现的子目标。框架中的底层代理是向学习者推荐学习项目。为了使路径只包含与目标相关的学习项，提高实现目标的效率，提出了一种基于子目标和知识图的候选选择器来约束底层智能体的行为空间。我们还针对低水平培训开发了基于测试的内部奖励，以缓解外部奖励稀缺的问题。在三个不同的模拟器上进行的大量实验表明，我们的框架实现了最先进的性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Graph+Enhanced+Hierarchical+Reinforcement+Learning+for+Goal-oriented+Learning+Path+Recommendation)|0|

Traditional rule-based and feature-based methods cannot well capture the structural and temporal patterns of ever-changing user behaviors. Moreover, most of the existing works based on network embedding either rely on discretized snapshots, which have ignored accurate temporal relations among user behaviors and weakened the impact of new edges, or fail to utilize dynamic and heterogeneous information simultaneously to distinguish varying effects of new edges on existing nodes. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end continuous-time model, named Temporal Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (THGNN), to detect anomalous behaviors (edges) in dynamic heterogeneous social networks. Specifically, the model constantly updates node embeddings by propagating the information of a new edge to its source and target nodes as well as their neighbors. In this process, heterogeneous encoders are employed to handle different types of nodes and edges. What is more, a novel dual-level distributive attention mechanism is designed to allocate the influence degree of a currently interacting node to its multiple neighbors, considering the combined effect of edge type and time interval information. That can be regarded as an extension of the classical aggregative attention mechanism in the opposite direction. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that THGNN outperforms all the baselines on the task of anomalous edge detection, achieving an average AUC gain of 6% across all datasets.|异常检测，特别是在动态和异构的社交网络中发现异常行为，在现实生活中变得越来越重要。传统的基于规则和基于特征的方法不能很好地捕获不断变化的用户行为的结构和时间模式。此外，现有的基于网络嵌入的工作大多依赖于离散快照，忽略了用户行为之间精确的时间关系，削弱了新边的影响，或者未能同时利用动态和异构信息来区分新边对现有节点的不同影响。本文提出了一种端到端连续时间模型——时态异构图神经网络(THGNN) ，用于检测动态异构社会网络中的异常行为(边)。具体来说，该模型通过将新边的信息传播到源节点和目标节点以及它们的邻居，不断地更新节点嵌入。在这个过程中，异构编码器被用来处理不同类型的节点和边缘。同时，考虑到边缘类型和时间间隔信息的组合效应，设计了一种新的双层分布式注意机制来分配当前交互节点对其多个邻居的影响程度。这可以看作是对经典的聚集性注意机制在相反方向上的延伸。在四个实际数据集上的大量实验表明，THGNN 在异常边缘检测任务上优于所有基线，在所有数据集上平均获得6% 的 AUC 增益。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=THGNN:+An+Embedding-based+Model+for+Anomaly+Detection+in+Dynamic+Heterogeneous+Social+Networks)|0|

However, existing studies fail to consider that the prompts among different layers in Transformer are different due to the diverse information learned at each layer. In general, the bottom layers in the model tend to capture low-level semantic or structural information, while the upper layers primarily acquire task-specific knowledge. Hence, we propose a novel hierarchical prompt tuning model for few-shot multi-task learning to capture this regularity. The designed model mainly consists of three types of prompts: shared prompts, auto-adaptive prompts, and task-specific prompts. Shared prompts facilitate the sharing of general information across all tasks. Auto-adaptive prompts dynamically select and integrate relevant prompt information from all tasks into the current task. Task-specific prompts concentrate on learning task-specific knowledge. To enhance the model's adaptability to diverse inputs, we introduce deep instance-aware language prompts as the foundation for constructing the above prompts. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on multiple widely-used datasets.

Explicit investigation of interaction cues is made possible by using graph-based models, where each user-item relationship is described by an edge, and the introduction of user-user social network. While existing graph-based recommendation methods use only a single-value edge to define the relationship between a pair of user and item, which limits the ability to represent complex user-item interactions. Furthermore, some social recommendation methods overlook the heterogeneous user behavior patterns in social and interaction relationships, resulting in the suboptimal performance of existing systems. In this paper, we propose a novel Social-aware Multi-dimensional Edge Feature-based Graph Representation Learning method, called SMEF. It represents all users and items as a graph and deep learns a multi-dimensional edge feature to explicitly describe the task-specific relationships of each user-item pair. Specifically, the proposed SMEF focuses on two distinct user behavior patterns toward social friends and interactive items, which explore the underlying heterogeneous relationship cues within them. This way, the learned multi-dimensional edge features encode user information from both social and interaction aspects. The proposed SMEF is a plug-and-play module that can be combined with different recommendation frameworks and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) backbones to generate high quality user representations.

In the context of knowledge-aware recommendation (KGR), graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as promising solutions for modeling factual and semantic information in KGs. However, the long-tail distribution of entities leads to sparsity in supervision signals, which weakens the quality of item representation when utilizing KG enhancement. Additionally, the binary relation representation of KGs simplifies hyper-relational facts, making it challenging to model complex real-world information. Furthermore, the over-smoothing phenomenon results in indistinguishable representations and information loss. To address these challenges, we propose the SDK (Self-Supervised Dynamic Hypergraph Recommendation based on Hyper-Relational Knowledge Graph) framework. This framework establishes a cross-view hypergraph self-supervised learning mechanism for KG enhancement. Specifically, we model hyper-relational facts in KGs to capture interdependencies between entities under complete semantic conditions. With the refined representation, a hypergraph is dynamically constructed to preserve features in the deep vector space, thereby alleviating the over-smoothing problem. Furthermore, we mine external supervision signals from both the global perspective of the hypergraph and the local perspective of collaborative filtering (CF) to guide the model prediction process.

|[Black-box Adversarial Attacks against Dense Retrieval Models: A Multi-view Contrastive Learning Method](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614793)|YuAn Liu, Ruqing Zhang, Jiafeng Guo, Maarten de Rijke, Wei Chen, Yixing Fan, Xueqi Cheng|ICT, CAS & University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands|Neural ranking models (NRMs) and dense retrieval (DR) models have given rise to substantial improvements in overall retrieval performance. In addition to their effectiveness, and motivated by the proven lack of robustness of deep learning-based approaches in other areas, there is growing interest in the robustness of deep learning-based approaches to the core retrieval problem. Adversarial attack methods that have so far been developed mainly focus on attacking NRMs, with very little attention being paid to the robustness of DR models. In this paper, we introduce the adversarial retrieval attack (AREA) task. The AREA task is meant to trick DR models into retrieving a target document that is outside the initial set of candidate documents retrieved by the DR model in response to a query. We consider the decision-based black-box adversarial setting, which is realistic in real-world search engines. To address the AREA task, we first employ existing adversarial attack methods designed for NRMs. We find that the promising results that have previously been reported on attacking NRMs, do not generalize to DR models: these methods underperform a simple term spamming method. We attribute the observed lack of generalizability to the interaction-focused architecture of NRMs, which emphasizes fine-grained relevance matching. DR models follow a different representation-focused architecture that prioritizes coarse-grained representations. We propose to formalize attacks on DR models as a contrastive learning problem in a multi-view representation space. The core idea is to encourage the consistency between each view representation of the target document and its corresponding viewer via view-wise supervision signals. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly outperform existing attack strategies in misleading the DR model with small indiscernible text perturbations.|神经排序模型(NRM)和密集检索(DR)模型在总体检索性能方面有了很大的提高。除了这些方法的有效性外，由于在其他领域基于深度学习的方法缺乏稳健性，人们对基于深度学习的方法解决核心检索问题的稳健性越来越感兴趣。目前发展起来的对抗性攻击方法主要集中在攻击 NRM，很少关注 DR 模型的鲁棒性。本文介绍了对抗性检索攻击(AREA)任务。AREA 任务是为了欺骗 DR 模型来检索目标文档，该目标文档位于 DR 模型在响应查询时检索的候选文档的初始集之外。我们考虑基于决策的黑盒对抗设置，这在现实世界的搜索引擎中是现实的。为了解决 AREA 任务，我们首先使用为 NRM 设计的现有对手攻击方法。我们发现，以前报道的攻击 NRM 的有希望的结果并没有推广到 DR 模型: 这些方法不如一个简单的术语发送方法。我们将观察到的缺乏普遍性归因于以交互为中心的 NRM 体系结构，它强调细粒度的相关性匹配。DR 模型遵循不同的以表示为中心的体系结构，该体系结构对粗粒度表示进行优先级排序。我们提出将对 DR 模型的攻击形式化为一个多视图表示空间中的对比学习问题。其核心思想是通过视图监控信号鼓励目标文档的每个视图表示与其相应的查看器之间的一致性。实验结果表明，该方法能够明显优于现有的攻击策略，具有较小的不可分辨文本扰动误导 DR 模型。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Black-box+Adversarial+Attacks+against+Dense+Retrieval+Models:+A+Multi-view+Contrastive+Learning+Method)|0|

Towards that, a common practice is to embed components of structured data into a high-dimensional vector space. We study the embedding of the tuples of a relational database, where existing techniques are often based on optimization tasks over a collection of random walks from the database. The focus of this paper is on the recent FoRWaRD algorithm that is designed for dynamic databases, where walks are sampled by following foreign keys between tuples. Importantly, different walks have different schemas, or ?walk schemes," that are derived by listing the relations and attributes along the walk. Also importantly, different walk schemes describe relationships of different natures in the database. We show that by focusing on a few informative walk schemes, we can obtain tuple embedding significantly faster, while retaining the quality. We define the problem of scheme selection for tuple embedding, devise several approaches and strategies for scheme selection, and conduct a thorough empirical study of the performance over a collection of downstream tasks. Our results confirm that with effective strategies for scheme selection, we can obtain high-quality embeddings considerably (e.g., three times) faster, preserve the extensibility to newly inserted tuples, and even achieve an increase in the precision of some tasks.|用于数据分析的机器通常需要输入的数字表示。为此，一个常见的做法是将结构化数据的组件嵌入到高维向量空间中。我们研究了关系数据库元组的嵌入，其中现有的技术通常是基于优化任务，从数据库中随机游走的集合。本文的重点是针对动态数据库设计的最新的 ForRWaRD 算法，该算法通过在元组之间跟随外键来采样行走。重要的是，不同的散步有不同的模式，还是？这是通过列出步行过程中的关系和属性得出的。同样重要的是，不同的遍历方案描述数据库中不同性质的关系。实验结果表明，在保证质量的前提下，通过对几种信息量较大的步进方案进行分析，可以显著提高元组嵌入的速度。我们定义了元组嵌入的方案选择问题，设计了几种方案选择的方法和策略，并对下游任务集的性能进行了深入的实证研究。实验结果表明，采用有效的方案选择策略，可以更快地获得高质量的嵌入，保持新插入元组的可扩展性，甚至可以提高某些任务的精度。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Selecting+Walk+Schemes+for+Database+Embedding)|0|
|[Timestamps as Prompts for Geography-Aware Location Recommendation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615083)|Yan Luo, Haoyi Duan, Ye Liu, FuLai Chung|The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, Hong Kong; Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China|Location recommendation plays a vital role in improving users' travel experience. The timestamp of the POI to be predicted is of great significance, since a user will go to different places at different times. However, most existing methods either do not use this kind of temporal information, or just implicitly fuse it with other contextual information. In this paper, we revisit the problem of location recommendation and point out that explicitly modeling temporal information is a great help when the model needs to predict not only the next location but also further locations. In addition, state-of-the-art methods do not make effective use of geographic information and suffer from the hard boundary problem when encoding geographic information by gridding. To this end, a Temporal Prompt-based and Geography-aware (TPG) framework is proposed. The temporal prompt is firstly designed to incorporate temporal information of any further check-in. A shifted window mechanism is then devised to augment geographic data for addressing the hard boundary problem. Via extensive comparisons with existing methods and ablation studies on five real-world datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method under various settings. Most importantly, our proposed model has the superior ability of interval prediction. In particular, the model can predict the location that a user wants to go to at a certain time while the most recent check-in behavioral data is masked, or it can predict specific future check-in (not just the next one) at a given timestamp.|位置推荐在改善用户的旅游体验方面起着至关重要的作用。预测的 POI 的时间戳非常重要，因为用户将在不同的时间到达不同的地点。然而，大多数现有的方法要么不使用这种时间信息，要么只是隐式地将其与其他上下文信息融合在一起。在本文中，我们再次回顾了位置推荐的问题，并指出当模型不仅需要预测下一个位置，而且需要预测更远的位置时，显式地建立时间信息是一个很大的帮助。另外，现有的方法在对地理信息进行网格化编码时，不能有效地利用地理信息，存在硬边界问题。为此，提出了一个基于时态提示和地理感知(TPG)的框架。时间提示符首先设计为合并任何进一步签入的时间信息。然后设计了一种移动窗口机制来增加地理数据，以解决硬边界问题。通过与现有方法的广泛比较以及对五个实际数据集的烧蚀研究，我们证明了该方法在不同环境下的有效性和优越性。最重要的是，我们提出的模型具有优越的区间预测能力。特别是，当最近的签入行为数据被掩盖时，该模型可以预测用户在特定时间想要去的位置，或者它可以预测给定时间戳的特定未来签入(不仅仅是下一次)。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Timestamps+as+Prompts+for+Geography-Aware+Location+Recommendation)|0|

One of the most effective approaches to do so is the well-known LambdaRank algorithm. LambdaRank uses gradient descent optimisation, and at its core, it defines approximate gradients, the so-called lambdas, for a non-differentiable IR metric. Intuitively, each lambda describes how much a document's score should be "pushed" up/down to reduce the ranking error. In this work, we show that lambdas may be incoherent w.r.t. the metric being optimised: e.g., a document with high relevance in the ground truth may receive a smaller gradient push than a document with lower relevance. This behaviour goes far beyond the expected degree of approximation. We analyse such behaviour of LambdaRank gradients and we introduce some strategies to reduce their incoherencies. We demonstrate through extensive experiments, conducted using publicly available datasets, that the proposed approach reduces the frequency of the incoherencies in LambdaRank and derivatives, and leads to models that achieve statistically significant improvements in the NDCG metric, without compromising the training efficiency.|在信息检索中，学习排名(Learning-to-Rank，LTR)任务需要建立一个排名模型来优化一个特定的 IR 指标。最有效的方法之一是著名的 LambdaRank 算法。LambdaRank 使用梯度下降法优化，在其核心，它定义了近似梯度，即所谓的 lambdas，用于不可微 IR 度量。直观地说，每个 lambda 描述了一个文档的分数应该“上推”多少，以减少排名错误。在这项工作中，我们表明，lambdas 可能是不连贯的 W.R.T。的度量被优化: 例如，一个文件与地面真相高相关性可能会收到一个较小的梯度推动比一个文件与低相关性。这种行为远远超出了预期的近似程度。我们分析了这种行为的 LambdaRank 梯度和我们介绍了一些策略，以减少他们的不一致性。我们通过使用公开可用的数据集进行的广泛实验证明，所提出的方法降低了 LambdaRank 和衍生物中不相干的频率，并导致模型在 NDCG 指标中实现统计学显着的改善，而不损害训练效率。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=LambdaRank+Gradients+are+Incoherent)|0|
|[System Initiative Prediction for Multi-turn Conversational Information Seeking](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615070)|Chuan Meng, Mohammad Aliannejadi, Maarten de Rijke|University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands|Identifying the right moment for a system to take the initiative is essential to conversational information seeking (CIS). Existing studies have extensively studied the clarification need prediction task, i.e., predicting when to ask a clarifying question, however, it only covers one specific system-initiative action. We define the system initiative prediction (SIP) task as predicting whether a CIS system should take the initiative at the next turn. Our analysis reveals that for effective modeling of SIP, it is crucial to capture dependencies between adjacent user?system initiative-taking decisions. We propose to model SIP by CRFs. Due to their graphical nature, CRFs are effective in capturing such dependencies and have greater transparency than more complex methods, e.g., LLMs. Applying CRFs to SIP comes with two challenges: (i) CRFs need to be given the unobservable system utterance at the next turn, and (ii) they do not explicitly model multi-turn features. We model SIP as an input-incomplete sequence labeling problem and propose a multi-turn system initiative predictor (MuSIc) that has (i) prior-posterior inter-utterance encoders to eliminate the need to be given the unobservable system utterance, and (ii) a multi-turn feature-aware CRF layer to incorporate multi-turn features into the dependencies between adjacent initiative-taking decisions. Experiments show that MuSIc outperforms LLM-based baselines including LLaMA, achieving state-of-the-art results on SIP. We also show the benefits of SIP on clarification need prediction and action prediction.|确定系统采取主动的合适时机对于会话信息搜索(CIS)至关重要。现有的研究已经广泛地研究了澄清需求预测任务，即预测何时提出澄清问题，但它只涉及一个具体的系统-主动行为。我们将系统主动预测(SIP)任务定义为预测一个 CIS 系统是否应该在下一轮采取主动。我们的分析表明，对于 SIP 的有效建模，捕获相邻用户系统主动决策之间的依赖性是至关重要的。我们提出用 CRF 来建立 SIP 模型。由于它们的图形化特性，通用报告格式能够有效地捕获这种依赖关系，并且比更复杂的方法(例如 LLM)具有更大的透明度。将 CRF 应用于 SIP 有两个挑战: (i) CRF 需要在下一个回合中被赋予不可观察的系统语句，以及(ii)它们没有明确地建模多回合特征。我们将 SIP 建模为一个输入不完全序列标记问题，并提出了一个多回合系统主动预测器(MuSic) ，它具有(i)先验-后验语音编码器以消除给定不可观测系统语音的需要，以及(ii)一个多回合特征感知 CRF 层以将多回合特征纳入相邻主动决策之间的依赖关系。实验结果表明，MuSIC 的性能优于基于 LLM 的基线(包括 LLaMA) ，在 SIP 上取得了一流的效果。我们还展示了 SIP 在澄清需求预测和作用预测方面的优势。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=System+Initiative+Prediction+for+Multi-turn+Conversational+Information+Seeking)|0|

Although the research on this task has made important progress, it still lacks the consideration of cross-scenario relations, thus leading to limitation in learning capability and difficulty in interrelation modeling. In this paper, we propose a Hybrid Contrastive Constrained approach (HC^2) for multi-scenario ad ranking. To enhance the modeling of data interrelation, we elaborately design a hybrid contrastive learning approach to capture commonalities and differences among multiple scenarios. The core of our approach consists of two elaborated contrastive losses, namely generalized and individual contrastive loss, which aim at capturing common knowledge and scenario-specific knowledge, respectively. To adapt contrastive learning to the complex multi-scenario setting, we propose a series of important improvements. For generalized contrastive loss, we enhance contrastive learning by extending the contrastive samples (label-aware and diffusion noise enhanced contrastive samples) and reweighting the contrastive samples (reciprocal similarity weighting). For individual contrastive loss, we use the strategies of dropout-based augmentation and {cross-scenario encoding} for generating meaningful positive and negative contrastive samples, respectively. Extensive experiments on both offline evaluation and online test have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed HC$^2$ by comparing it with a number of competitive baselines.|多场景广告排名的目的是利用来自多个领域或渠道的数据来训练一个统一的排名模型，以提高每个场景的性能。本课题的研究虽然取得了重要进展，但仍然缺乏对跨场景关系的考虑，从而导致学习能力的局限性和相互关系建模的困难。本文提出了一种基于混合对比约束的多场景广告排名方法(HC ^ 2)。为了加强数据相关性的建模，我们精心设计了一种混合对比学习方法来捕捉多个场景之间的共性和差异。我们的方法的核心包括两个详细的对比损失，即广义对比损失和个体对比损失，分别旨在获取共同知识和情景特定的知识。为了使对比学习适应复杂的多场景环境，我们提出了一系列重要的改进措施。对于广义对比损失，我们通过扩展对比样本(标签感知和扩散噪声增强的对比样本)和重新加权对比样本(互惠相似性加权)来增强对比学习。对于个体对比损失，我们分别使用基于辍学的增强策略和{交叉情景编码}来产生有意义的正向和负向对比样本。离线评估和在线测试的广泛实验已经证明了所提出的 HC $^ 2 $的有效性，通过比较它与一些竞争性的基线。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Hybrid+Contrastive+Constraints+for+Multi-Scenario+Ad+Ranking)|0|

Given the existence of data censoring, an effective way of survival analysis is to enforce the pairwise temporal concordance between censored and observed data, aiming to utilize the time interval before censoring as partially observed time-to-event labels for supervised learning. Although existing studies mostly employed ranking methods to pursue an ordering objective, contrastive methods which learn a discriminative embedding by having data contrast against each other, have not been explored thoroughly for survival analysis. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel Ontology-aware Temporality-based Contrastive Survival (OTCSurv) analysis framework that utilizes survival durations from both censored and observed data to define temporal distinctiveness and construct negative sample pairs with adjustable hardness for contrastive learning. Specifically, we first use an ontological encoder and a sequential self-attention encoder to represent the longitudinal EHR data with rich contexts. Second, we design a temporal contrastive loss to capture varying survival durations in a supervised setting through a hardness-aware negative sampling mechanism. Last, we incorporate the contrastive task into the time-to-event predictive task with multiple loss components. We conduct extensive experiments using a large EHR dataset to forecast the risk of hospitalized patients who are in danger of developing acute kidney injury (AKI), a critical and urgent medical condition.

MUSE employs the self-supervised learning framework that maximizes the agreement between the original session and the augmented session, which is augmented by our novel session augmentation method, called transition-based augmentation. To further facilitate the alignment of the representations between the two views, we devise two fine-grained matching strategies, i.e., item- and similarity-based matching strategies.

|[Dual-Oriented Contrast for Recommendation with A Stop-Gradient Operation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614852)|Byungkook Oh, Yul Kim, Bumky Min|Samsung Research, Seoul, Republic of Korea|Recently, contrastive loss is adopted as a main objective of recommender systems. InfoNCE-like losses penalize hard negative items more and control the strength of penalties with a temperature, called hardness-aware sensitivity. However, since they leverageuser->item patterns in a non-symmetric way, negative items are pushed away from anchor users and attract semantically-similar items to each other, focusing on the distribution of item embeddings. We point out that user embeddings also have inherent semantic structures that can be captured fromitem->user patterns. This paper presents Dual-oriented Contrast(DuCo), a novel symmetric learning objective for recommendation to learn more comprehensive representations fromusereftrightarrowitem patterns. DuCo controls user-/item-centric hardness-aware sensitivities and simultaneously optimizes the score distributions over sampled items (user-oriented contrast) and users (item-oriented contrast). This aims to explore ideal user and item distributions that are locally clustered and globally uniform. However, since user-/item-side temperatures are interdependent, naive control over temperatures may break the underlying semantic structures of the other side. To this end, we employ a stop-gradient operation to preserve the individual characteristics of user/item embedding distributions. Furthermore, we balance user-/item-oriented contrasts during learning to maintain consistent high-rank performance (e.g., recall@1). Empirical results show that DuCo contributes to the top-k user and item prediction simultaneously, and outperforms state-of-the-art learning objectives across different backbones from ID-based to neighbor-based encoders.|近年来，对比损失被作为推荐系统的主要目标。类似于 InfoNCE 的损失更多地惩罚硬负面项目，并用温度控制惩罚的强度，称为硬度感知灵敏度。然而，由于它们以一种非对称的方式利用 user-> item 模式，负面条目被推离锚用户，并且相互吸引语义相似的条目，关注条目嵌入的分布。我们指出，用户嵌入还具有可以从 mitem-> 用户模式捕获的固有语义结构。本文提出了一种新的对称推荐学习目标——双向对比度(DuCo)。DuCo 控制以用户/项目为中心的硬度感知敏感性，并同时优化分数分布的抽样项目(面向用户的对比)和用户(面向项目的对比)。这旨在探索理想的本地集群和全局统一的用户和项目分布。但是，由于用户/项目端的温度是相互依赖的，因此对温度的天真控制可能会破坏另一端的底层语义结构。为此，我们使用了一个停止梯度操作来保留用户/项嵌入分布的各自特征。此外，我们在学习过程中平衡用户/项目导向的对比，以保持一致的高等级性能(例如，召回@1)。实证结果表明，DuCo 能够同时提供最佳用户和项目预测，并且在从基于 ID 的编码器到基于邻居的编码器的不同骨干网络中，其学习效果优于最先进的学习目标。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Dual-Oriented+Contrast+for+Recommendation+with+A+Stop-Gradient+Operation)|0|

Khong|Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore|Knowledge graph (KG) has recently emerged as a powerful source of auxiliary information in the realm of knowledge-aware recommendation (KGR) systems.

Moreover, the over-smoothing issue further limits the number of GNN layers or hops required to propagate messages - these models ignore the non-local information concealed deep within the knowledge graph.

Unlike existing methods, the proposed tri-local and single-global quad-tier architecture exploits the knowledge graph holistically to achieve effective self-supervised representation learning.

Recent studies have shown that using the graph neighborhood of a node via graph neural networks (GNNs) provides more useful information compared to just using the query information. Conventional GNNs for KG link prediction follow the standard message-passing paradigm on the entire KG, which leads to over-smoothing of representations and also limits their scalability. On a large scale, it becomes computationally expensive to aggregate useful information from the entire KG for inference. To address the limitations of existing KG link prediction frameworks, we propose a novel retrieve-and-read framework, which first retrieves a relevant subgraph context for the query and then jointly reasons over the context and the query with a high-capacity reader. As part of our exemplar instantiation for the new framework, we propose a novel Transformer-based GNN as the reader, which incorporates graph-based attention structure and cross-attention between query and context for deep fusion. This design enables the model to focus on salient context information relevant to the query.

The learning process of CF models typically consists of three components: interaction encoder, loss function, and negative sampling. Although many existing studies have proposed various CF models to design sophisticated interaction encoders, recent work shows that simply reformulating the loss functions can achieve significant performance gains. This paper delves into analyzing the relationship among existing loss functions. Our mathematical analysis reveals that the previous loss functions can be interpreted as alignment and uniformity functions: (i) the alignment matches user and item representations, and (ii) the uniformity disperses user and item distributions. Inspired by this analysis, we propose a novel loss function that improves the design of alignment and uniformity considering the unique patterns of datasets called Margin-aware Alignment and Weighted Uniformity (MAWU). The key novelty of MAWU is two-fold: (i) margin-aware alignment (MA) mitigates user/item-specific popularity biases, and (ii) weighted uniformity (WU) adjusts the significance between user and item uniformities to reflect the inherent characteristics of datasets. Extensive experimental results show that MF and LightGCN equipped with MAWU are comparable or superior to state-of-the-art CF models with various loss functions on three public datasets.|协同过滤(CF)是现代推荐系统中的一项关键技术。CF 模型的学习过程通常由三部分组成: 交互编码器、损耗函数和负采样。虽然许多现有的研究已经提出了各种 CF 模型来设计复杂的交互编码器，最近的工作表明，简单地重新制定损失函数可以取得显著的性能增益。本文深入分析了现有损失函数之间的关系。我们的数学分析表明，先前的损失函数可以解释为对齐和一致性函数: (i)对齐匹配用户和项目表示，和(ii)一致性分散用户和项目分布。受此分析的启发，我们提出了一种新的损失函数，改进了排列和均匀性的设计，考虑到独特的模式数据集称为边缘感知排列和加权均匀性(MAWU)。MAWU 的关键新颖性有两个方面: (i)边际感知对齐(MA)减轻用户/项目特定的流行偏见，和(ii)加权一致性(WU)调整用户和项目一致性之间的显着性以反映数据集的固有特征。大量的实验结果表明，配备 MAWU 的 MF 和 LightGCN 在三个公共数据集上具有各种损失函数，与最先进的 CF 模型相比具有可比性或优越性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Toward+a+Better+Understanding+of+Loss+Functions+for+Collaborative+Filtering)|0|
|[Evaluating and Optimizing the Effectiveness of Neural Machine Translation in Supporting Code Retrieval Models: A Study on the CAT Benchmark](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614869)|Hung Phan, Ali Jannesari|Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA|Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is widely applied in software engineering tasks. The effectiveness of NMT for code retrieval relies on the ability to learn from the sequence of tokens in the source language to the sequence of tokens in the target language. While NMT performs well in pseudocode-to-code translation, it might have challenges in learning to translate from natural language query to source code in newly curated real-world code documentation/ implementation datasets. In this work, we analyze the performance of NMT in natural language-to-code translation in the newly curated CAT benchmark that includes the optimized versions of three Java datasets TLCodeSum, CodeSearchNet, Funcom, and a Python dataset PCSD. Our evaluation shows that NMT has low accuracy, measured by CrystalBLEU and Meteor metrics in this task. To alleviate the duty of NMT in learning complex representation of source code, we propose ASTTrans Representation, a tailored representation of an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) using a subset of non-terminal nodes. We show that the classical approach NMT performs significantly better in learning ASTTrans Representation over code tokens with up to 36% improvement on Meteor score. Moreover, we leverage ASTTrans Representation to conduct combined code search processes from the state-of-the-art code search processes using GraphCodeBERT and UniXcoder. Our NMT models of learning ASTTrans Representation can boost the Mean Reciprocal Rank of these state-of-the-art code search processes by up to 3.08% and improve 23.08% of queries' results over the CAT benchmark.|神经机器翻译(NMT)在软件工程任务中有着广泛的应用。NMT 对于代码检索的有效性依赖于从源语言中的令牌序列学习到目标语言中的令牌序列的能力。虽然 NMT 在伪代码到代码的转换中表现良好，但是在学习如何在新策划的真实世界代码文档/实现数据集中从自然语言查询转换为源代码时，可能会遇到挑战。在这项工作中，我们分析了 NMT 在自然语言到代码的翻译中的性能，新策划的 CAT 基准包括三个 Java 数据集 tlcodeSum，codeSearchNet，Funcom 和一个 Python 数据集 PCSD 的优化版本。我们的评估表明，NMT 的准确度较低，测量晶体 BLEU 和流星指标在这个任务。为了减轻 NMT 在学习源代码复杂表示方面的责任，我们提出了一种基于非终端节点子集的抽象语法树表示(AST)。我们表明，经典的方法 NMT 在学习 ASTTrans 表示明显优于代码令牌，提高了36% 的流星分数。此外，我们利用 ASTTrans 表示来使用 GraphCodeBERT 和 UniXcoder 从最先进的代码搜索过程中进行组合代码搜索过程。我们的学习 ASTTrans 表示的 NMT 模型可以将这些最先进的代码搜索过程的平均倒数排名提高3.08% ，比 CAT 基准提高23.08% 的查询结果。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Evaluating+and+Optimizing+the+Effectiveness+of+Neural+Machine+Translation+in+Supporting+Code+Retrieval+Models:+A+Study+on+the+CAT+Benchmark)|0|

A significant effort has been devoted to improving prediction accuracy, inevitably leading to the potential degradation of recommendation diversity. Moreover, individuals have different needs for diversity. To address these problems, diversity-enhanced approaches are proposed to modify the recommender models. However, these methods fail to break free from the relevance-oriented paradigm and are mostly haunted by sharply-declined accuracy and high computational costs. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Dual-Process Graph Neural Network (DPGNN), an efficient diversity-enhanced recommender system, resonating with the dual-process model of human cognition and the arousal theory of human interest. The first stage reduces the risk of suboptimal output during the training procedure, which helps to find a solution outside the relevance-oriented paradigm. Moreover, the second stage utilizes user-specific rating adjustments, boosting the recommendation diversity and accommodating users' distinctive needs with minimum computational costs. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets verify the effectiveness of our method in improving diversity, while maintaining accuracy with low computational costs.|推荐系统是最基本的信息服务之一。为了提高预测的准确性，人们付出了巨大的努力，这不可避免地导致了推荐多样性的潜在退化。此外，个体对多样性有不同的需求。为了解决这些问题，提出了基于多样性增强的方法来修改推荐模型。然而，这些方法未能摆脱以关联为导向的范式，并且大多受到精度急剧下降和计算成本高的困扰。为了应对这些挑战，我们提出了双进程图形神经网络(DPGNN) ，一种有效的多样性增强推荐系统，与人类认知的双进程模型和人类兴趣唤醒理论产生共鸣。第一阶段降低了培训过程中产出不理想的风险，这有助于找到一个以关联为导向的范式之外的解决方案。此外，第二阶段利用用户特定的评分调整，提高推荐的多样性，以最小的计算成本满足用户的特殊需求。在真实世界数据集上的大量实验证明了该方法在提高多样性的同时以较低的计算成本保持准确性方面的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Dual-Process+Graph+Neural+Network+for+Diversified+Recommendation)|0|

The bidding process involves multiple users competing for a product, with the highest bidder winning the item. As a result, each transaction is independent and characterized by varying transaction prices. The individual nature of auction items means that users cannot purchase identical items, adding to the uniqueness of the purchasing history. Bidders in auction systems rely on their judgment to determine the value of a product, as bidding prices reflect preferences rather than cost-free actions like clicking or collecting. Conventional methodologies that heavily rely on user-item purchase history are ill-suited to handle these unique and extreme product features. Unfortunately, prior recommendation approaches have failed to give due attention to the contextual intricacies of auction items, thereby missing out on the full potential of the invaluable bidding record at hand. This paper introduces a novel contrastive learning approach for auction recommendation, addressing the challenges of data sparsity and uniqueness in auction recommendation. Our method focuses on capturing multiple behavior relations and item context through contrastive pairs construction, contrastive embedding, and contrastive optimization techniques from both user and item perspectives. By overcoming the limitations of previous approaches, our method delivers promising results on two auction datasets, highlighting the practicality and effectiveness of our model.|EBay 等拍卖平台中的推荐系统与传统交易平台中的推荐系统功能不同。投标过程涉及多个用户竞争一个产品，出价最高者中标。因此，每笔交易都是独立的，拥有属性不同的交易价格。拍卖物品的个别性质意味着用户不能购买相同的物品，增加了购买历史的唯一性。拍卖系统中的投标人依靠自己的判断来确定产品的价值，因为投标价格反映的是偏好，而不是点击或收集等无成本的行为。严重依赖于用户商品购买历史的传统方法不适合处理这些独特和极端的产品特性。遗憾的是，先前的推荐办法未能适当注意到拍卖物品的复杂背景，从而错过了手头宝贵的投标记录的全部潜力。针对拍卖推荐中存在的数据稀疏性和唯一性等问题，提出了一种新的拍卖推荐对比学习方法。该方法从用户和项目的角度出发，通过对比对构造、对比嵌入和对比优化技术来捕获多个行为关系和项目上下文。通过克服以往方法的局限性，我们的方法在两个拍卖数据集上提供了有希望的结果，突出了我们的模型的实用性和有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Dual-view+Contrastive+Learning+for+Auction+Recommendation)|0|

However, we observe that the current masked autoencoder models lack good generalization ability on graph data. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel graph masked autoencoder framework called GiGaMAE. Different from existing masked autoencoders that learn node presentations by explicitly reconstructing the original graph components (e.g., features or edges), in this paper, we propose to collaboratively reconstruct informative and integrated latent embeddings. By considering embeddings encompassing graph topology and attribute information as reconstruction targets, our model could capture more generalized and comprehensive knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce a mutual information based reconstruction loss that enables the effective reconstruction of multiple targets. This learning objective allows us to differentiate between the exclusive knowledge learned from a single target and common knowledge shared by multiple targets. We evaluate our method on three downstream tasks with seven datasets as benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of GiGaMAE against state-of-the-art baselines.

However, managing thousands of micromobility vehicles in a city, such as rebalancing and charging vehicles to meet spatial-temporally varied demand, is challenging. Existing management frameworks generally consider demand as the number of requests without the energy consumption of these requests, which can lead to less effective management. To address this limitation, we design RECOMMEND, a rebalancing and charging framework for shared electric micromobility vehicles with energy-informed demand to improve the system revenue. Specifically, we first re-define the demand from the perspective of energy consumption and predict the future energy-informed demand based on the state-of-the-art spatial-temporal prediction method. Then we fuse the predicted energy-informed demand into different components of a rebalancing and charging framework based on reinforcement learning. We evaluate the RECOMMEND system with 2-month real-world electric micromobility system operation data. Experimental results show that our method can be easily integrated into a general RL framework and outperform state-of-the-art baselines by at least 26.89% in terms of net revenue.|共享电动微型交通(如共享电动自行车和电动滑板车) ，作为一种新兴的城市交通方式，近年来越来越受欢迎。然而，在一个城市管理数以千计的微型移动车辆，如重新平衡和充电车辆，以满足时空不同的需求，是具有挑战性的。现有管理框架一般将需求视为没有这些需求的能源消耗的需求数量，这可能导致管理效率较低。为了解决这一局限性，我们设计了一个再平衡和充电框架 RECOMMEND，用于具有能源信息需求的共享电动微型移动车辆，以提高系统收入。具体来说，我们首先从能源消费的角度重新定义需求，并基于最新的时空预测方法对未来的能源知情需求进行预测。然后，我们将预测的能源需求融入基于强化学习的再平衡和收费框架的不同组成部分。我们使用2个月的实际电子微移动系统运行数据对 RECOMMEND 系统进行了评估。实验结果表明，该方法可以很容易地集成到一个通用的 RL 框架中，并且在净收入方面比最先进的基线至少高出26.89% 。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Joint+Rebalancing+and+Charging+for+Shared+Electric+Micromobility+Vehicles+with+Energy-informed+Demand)|0|

It is crucial to effectively model feature interactions to improve the prediction performance of CTR models. However, existing methods face three significant challenges. First, while most methods can automatically capture high-order feature interactions, their performance tends to diminish as the order of feature interactions increases. Second, existing methods lack the ability to provide convincing interpretations of the prediction results, especially for high-order feature interactions, which limits the trustworthiness of their predictions. Third, many methods suffer from the presence of redundant parameters, particularly in the embedding layer. This paper proposes a novel method called Gated Deep Cross Network (GDCN) and a Field-level Dimension Optimization (FDO) approach to address these challenges. As the core structure of GDCN, Gated Cross Network (GCN) captures explicit high-order feature interactions and dynamically filters important interactions with an information gate in each order. Additionally, we use the FDO approach to learn condensed dimensions for each field based on their importance. Comprehensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, superiority and interpretability of GDCN. Moreover, we verify the effectiveness of FDO in learning various dimensions and reducing model parameters.

It is of great significance in assisting public opinion monitoring and advertising placement. Time series prediction is one of the simple and commonly used methods for popularity forecasting, which takes the popularity of the first few time steps in the observed data as inputs. However, the complete popularity trend of each social media is known in the training dataset, while the historical time series information except for the first few time steps is neglected in the existing models. In order to utilize the complete historical information from the observed data, a retrieval method is introduced in this paper. Therefore, how to retrieve similar social media based on the first few steps time series and how to integrate the similar historical information have become two challenges. A two-stage prediction method named Angle Feature Retrieval based Forecasting (AFRF) is proposed in this paper to solve the upper two problems. In the first stage, based on the angle features of series, we retrieve K similar series from the historical posts and concatenate them with the target series as the model's input. In the second stage, an attention mechanism is used to learn the temporal relationships among the series and generate future popularity forecasts. We evaluated the multi-step and single-point forecasting performance of AFRF on three real-world datasets and compared it with state-of-the-art popularity forecasting methods, such as temporal feature-based and cascade-based methods, verifying the effectiveness of AFRF.|社交媒体受欢迎程度预测已成为近年来的研究热点。它对辅助舆论监督和广告投放具有重要意义。时间序列预测是一种简单、常用的流行度预测方法，它以观测数据中前几个时间步长的流行度作为输入。然而，在训练数据集中已经知道每个社会媒体的完全流行趋势，而在现有的模型中，除了前几个时间步骤之外的历史时间序列信息被忽略了。为了充分利用观测数据中的完整历史信息，本文提出了一种检索方法。因此，如何基于前几步时间序列检索相似的社会媒体，如何整合相似的历史信息，已成为两大挑战。针对上述两个问题，提出了一种基于角度特征反演的两阶段预测方法(AFRF)。在第一阶段，根据序列的角度特征，从历史文章中提取出 K 个相似序列，并将它们与目标序列连接起来作为模型的输入。在第二阶段，使用注意机制来学习序列之间的时间关系，并生成未来的流行预测。对 AFRF 在三个实际数据集上的多步预测性能和单点预测性能进行了评估，并与基于时间特征和基于级联的流行性预测方法进行了比较，验证了 AFRF 的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=AFRF:+Angle+Feature+Retrieval+Based+Popularity+Forecasting)|0|

Several works have been proposed to tackle the issue from the spatial domain. However, researches on addressing the heterophily problem in the spectral domain are still limited due to a lack of understanding of spectral energy distribution in graphs with heterophily. In this paper, we analyze the spectral distribution with different heterophily degrees and observe that the heterophily of fraud nodes leads to the spectral energy moving from low-frequency to high-frequency. Further, we verify that splitting graphs using heterophilic and homophilic edges can obtain more significant expressions of signals in different frequency bands. The observation drives us to propose the spectral graph neural network, SplitGNN, to capture signals for fraud detection against heterophily. SplitGNN uses an edge classifier to split the original graph and adopts flexible band-pass graph filters to learn representations.

In this scenario, users have instant intentions and living habits, which exhibit a periodic tendency to click or buy products with similar intentions. This can be summarized as the intentional periodicity problem, which was not well-studied in previous works. Existing periodic-related recommenders exploit time-sensitive functions to capture the evolution of user preferences. However, these methods are easily affected by the real noisy signal in life service platforms, wherein the recent noisy signals can mislead the instant intention and living habits modeling. We summarize it as the noise issue. Although there are some denoising recommenders, these methods cannot effectively solve the noise issue for intentional periodicity modeling. To alleviate the issues, we propose a novel Denoising Periodic Graph Network (DPGN) for life service recommendation. First, to alleviate the noisy signals and model the instant intention accurately, we propose (i) temporal pooling (TP) to encode the most representative information shared by recent behaviors; (ii) temporal encoding (TE) to encode the relative time intervals. Second, to capture the user's living habits accurately, we propose the memory mechanism to maintain a series of instant intentions in different time periods. Third, to further capture the intentional periodicity, we propose the temporal graph transformer (TGT) layer to aggregate temporal information. Last, the denoising task is further proposed to alleviate the noisy signals. Extensive experiments on both real-world public and industrial datasets validate the state-of-the-art performance of DPGN.

Previous approaches are either based on traffic accident reports or vehicular sensor data. They either fail to identify potential risks, such as near-miss collisions, which would need other important measurements (e.g., hard break, acceleration, etc.), or fail to generalize to cities without vehicular sensor data, severely limiting their practicality. In this work, we address these two challenges and successfully identify regional driving risks in a target city without vehicular sensor data via cross-city transfer learning. Specifically, we design a novel framework RiskTrans by optimizing both the predictor and the relationship between cities to achieve transfer learning. We advance the existing works from two aspects: (i) we achieve it in a transductive manner without accessing labeled data in the target cities; (ii) we identify and address the problem of negative transfer in cross-city transfer learning, a prominent issue that is often (surprisingly) neglected in previous works.

Many fair ranking algorithms have been proposed to jointly optimize both ranking relevance and fairness. However, we find that most existing fair ranking methods adopt greedy algorithms that only optimize rankings for the next immediate session or request. As shown in this paper, such a myopic paradigm could limit the upper bound of ranking optimization and lead to suboptimal performance in the long term. To this end, we propose FARA, a novel Future-Aware Ranking Algorithm for ranking relevance and fairness optimization. Instead of greedily optimizing rankings for the next immediate session, FARA plans ahead by jointly optimizing multiple ranklists together and saving them for future sessions. Particularly, FARA first uses the Taylor expansion to investigate how future ranklists will influence the overall fairness of the system. Then, based on the analysis of the Taylor expansion, FARA adopts a two-phase optimization algorithm where we first solve an optimal future exposure planning problem and then construct the optimal ranklists according to the optimal future exposure planning. Theoretically, we show that FARA is optimal for ranking relevance and fairness joint optimization. Empirically, our extensive experiments on three semi-synthesized datasets show that FARA is efficient, effective, and can deliver significantly better ranking performance compared to state-of-the-art fair ranking methods.|排名系统是现代信息检索应用(如搜索引擎和推荐系统)的关键组成部分。除了与用户的排名相关性之外，项目提供者的曝光公平性也被认为是排名优化的一个重要因素。许多公平排序算法被提出来共同优化排序的相关性和公平性。然而，我们发现大多数现有的公平排名方法采用贪婪算法，只优化下一个即时会话或请求的排名。如本文所述，这种短视的范式可能会限制排序优化的上界，并导致长期的次优性能。为此，我们提出了一种新的未来感知排序算法 FARA，用于排序相关性和公平性优化。FARA 没有贪婪地优化下一阶段的排名，而是提前计划，联合优化多个排名，并将它们保存到未来的阶段。特别是，FARA 首先利用泰勒扩展来调查未来的排行榜将如何影响系统的整体公平性。然后，在分析泰勒展开的基础上，采用两阶段优化算法，首先解决未来曝光规划问题，然后根据未来曝光规划的优化结果构造最优排名表。从理论上证明了 FARA 对于排序相关性和公平性联合优化是最优的。经验上，我们在三个半合成数据集上的大量实验表明，FARA 是有效的，有效的，并且能够提供比最先进的公平排序方法更好的排序性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=FARA:+Future-aware+Ranking+Algorithm+for+Fairness+Optimization)|0|
|[Co-guided Random Walk for Polarized Communities Search](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614814)|Fanyi Yang, Huifang Ma, Cairui Yan, Zhixin Li, Liang Chang|Guangxi Normal University, Guilin, China; Guilin University of Electronic Technology, Guilin, China; Northwest Normal University, Lanzhou, China; NorthWest Normal University, Lanzhou, China|Polarized Communities Search (PCS) aims to identify query-dependent communities where positive links predominantly connect nodes within each community, while negative links primarily connect nodes across different communities. Existing solutions primarily focus on modeling network topology, disregarding the crucial factor of node attributes. However, it is non-trivial to incorporate node attributes into PCS. In this paper, we propose a novel method called CO-guided RAndom walk in attributed signed networks (CORA) for PCS. Our approach involves constructing an attribute-based signed network to represent the auxiliary relations between nodes. We introduce a weight assignment mechanism to assess the reliability of edges in the signed network. Then, we design a co-guided random walk scheme that operates on two signed networks to model the connections between network topology and node attributes, thereby enhancing the search outcomes. Finally, we identify polarized communities using the Rayleigh quotient in the signed network. Extensive experiments conducted on three public datasets demonstrate the superior performance of CORA compared to state-of-the-art baselines for polarized communities search.|极化社区搜索(PCS)旨在识别查询依赖的社区，其中正向链接主要连接每个社区内的节点，而负向链接主要连接不同社区的节点。现有的解决方案主要侧重于建模网络拓扑，忽略了节点属性的关键因素。然而，将节点属性合并到 PCS 中是非常重要的。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的方法称为 CO 引导的随机游走在属性签名网络(CORA)的 PCS。我们的方法包括构造一个基于属性的有符号网络来表示节点之间的辅助关系。我们引入了一种权重分配机制来评估有符号网络中边的可靠性。然后，我们设计一个共同引导的随机游走方案，在两个签名网络上操作，建立网络拓扑和节点属性之间的联系模型，从而提高搜索结果。最后，我们利用有符号网络中的瑞利商来识别极化群落。在三个公共数据集上进行的大量实验表明，与最先进的极化社区搜索基线相比，CORA 具有更好的性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Co-guided+Random+Walk+for+Polarized+Communities+Search)|0|

To address this issue, Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has emerged, among which model interpolation is a promising approach that interpolates the local personalized models with the global model. However, the existing model interpolation method may not work well for news recommendation tasks for some reasons. First, it neglects the fine-grained personalization needs at both the temporal and spatial levels in news recommendation tasks. Second, due to the cold-user problem in real-world news recommendation tasks, the local personalized models may perform poorly, thus limiting the performance gain from model interpolation. To this end, we propose FINDING (Federated News Recommendation with Fine-grained Interpolation and Dynamic Clustering ), a novel personalized federated learning framework based on model interpolation. Specifically, we first propose the fine-grained model interpolation strategy which interpolates the local personalized models with the global model in a time-aware and layer-aware way. Then, to address the cold-user problem in news recommendation tasks, we adopt the group-level personalization approach where users are dynamically clustered into groups and the group-level personalized models are used for interpolation.

Recent works leverage pre-trained language models to represent documents in dense vectors. However, these works focus on the textual content but ignore the appearance of web pages (e.g., the visual style, the layout, and the images), which are actually essential for information delivery. To alleviate this problem, we propose a new dense retrieval model, namely VILE, to incorporate visual features into document representations. However, because a web page is usually very large and contains diverse information, simply concatenating its textual and visual features may result in a cluttered multi-modal representation that lacks focus on the important parts of the page. We observe that web pages often have a structured content organization, comprising multiple blocks that convey different information. Motivated by the observation, we propose building a multi-modal document representation by aggregating the fine-grained multi-modal block representations, to enable a more comprehensive understanding of the page. Specifically, we first segment a web page into multiple blocks, then create multi-modal features for each block. %allowing for more effective capture of its content and visual information. The representations of all blocks are then integrated into the final multi-modal page representation. VILE can better model the importance of different content regions, leading to a high-quality multi-modal representation. We collect screenshots and the corresponding layout information of some web pages in the MS MARCO Document Ranking dataset, resulting in a new multi-modal document retrieval dataset. Experimental results conducted on this dataset demonstrate that our model exhibits significant improvements over existing document retrieval models.

This inspires us to explicitly bring an independent memory mechanism into CTR ranking model to learn and memorize cross features' representations. In this paper, we propose multi-Hash Codebook NETwork (HCNet) as the memory mechanism for efficiently learning and memorizing representations of cross features in CTR tasks. HCNet uses a multi-hash codebook as the main memory place and the whole memory procedure consists of three phases: multi-hash addressing, memory restoring, and feature shrinking. We also propose a new CTR model named MemoNet which combines HCNet with a DNN backbone. Extensive experimental results on three public datasets and online test show that MemoNet reaches superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches. Besides, MemoNet shows scaling law of large language model in NLP, which means we can enlarge the size of the codebook in HCNet to sustainably obtain performance gains. Our work demonstrates the importance and feasibility of learning and memorizing representations of cross features, which sheds light on a new promising research direction.

Different from conventional tabular data, where rows in a table are independent, sequential tabular data contains rich contextual and sequential information, where some fields aredynamically changing over time and others arestatic. Existing transformer-based approaches analyzing sequential tabular data overlook the differences between dynamic and static fields by replicating and filling static fields into each record, and ignore temporal information between rows, which leads to three major disadvantages: (1) computational overhead, (2) artificially simplified data for masked language modeling pre-training task that may yield less meaningful representations, and (3) disregarding the temporal behavioral patterns implied by time intervals. In this work, we propose FATA-Trans, a model with two field transformers for modeling sequential tabular data, where each processes static and dynamic field information separately. FATA-Trans isfield - andtime -aware for sequential tabular data. Thefield -type embedding in the method enables FATA-Trans to capture differences between static and dynamic fields. Thetime -aware position embedding exploits both order and time interval information between rows, which helps the model detect underlying temporal behavior in a sequence.

However, the k-core in real-world graphs tends to be extremely large, which hinders its effectiveness in practical applications. This challenge has motivated researchers to explore a variant of the k-core problem known as the minimum k-core search problem. This problem has been proven to be NP-Hard, and most of the existing studies naturally either deal with approximate solutions or suffer from inefficiency in practice. In this paper, we focus on designing efficient exact algorithms for the minimum k-core search problem. In particular, we develop an iterative-based framework that decomposes an instance of the minimum k-core search problem into a list of problem instances on another well-structured graph pattern. Based on this framework, we propose an iterative-based branch-and-bound algorithm, namely IBB, with additional pruning and reduction techniques. We show that, with a n-vertex graph, IBB runs in cn nO(1) time for some c < 2, achieving better theoretical performance than the trivial bound of 2n nO(1).

Modeling user-item interactions as a bipartite graph, our approach augments the latter by identifying new user-item edges that not only can explain the original unfairness by design, but can also mitigate it. Experiments on two public data sets show that our approach effectively leads to a better trade-off between fairness and recommendation utility compared with state-of-the-art mitigation procedures. We further analyze the characteristics of added edges to highlight key unfairness patterns.

|[Region-Wise Attentive Multi-View Representation Learning For Urban Region Embedding](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615194)|Weiliang Chan, Qianqian Ren||Urban region embedding is an important and yet highly challenging issue due to the complexity and constantly changing nature of urban data. To address the challenges, we propose a Region-Wise Multi-View Representation Learning (ROMER) to capture multi-view dependencies and learn expressive representations of urban regions without the constraints of rigid neighbourhood region conditions. Our model focus on learn urban region representation from multi-source urban data. First, we capture the multi-view correlations from mobility flow patterns, POI semantics and check-in dynamics. Then, we adopt global graph attention networks to learn similarity of any two vertices in graphs. To comprehensively consider and share features of multiple views, a two-stage fusion module is further proposed to learn weights with external attention to fuse multi-view embeddings. Extensive experiments for two downstream tasks on real-world datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 17\% improvement.|由于城市数据的复杂性和不断变化的性质，城市区域嵌入是一个重要而又极具挑战性的问题。为了应对这些挑战，我们提出了一种区域智能多视图表示学习(ROMER)方法来捕获多视图依赖关系，并在不受严格的邻近区域条件约束的情况下学习城市地区的表示。我们的模型侧重于从多源城市数据中学习城市区域表示。首先，我们从移动流模式、 POI 语义和签入动态中获取多视图相关性。然后，我们采用全局图注意网络来学习图中任意两个顶点的相似性。为了综合考虑和共享多视图的特征，进一步提出了一个两阶段融合模块，该模块通过学习权值和外部注意力来融合多视图嵌入。对真实世界数据集上的两个下游任务进行的大量实验表明，我们的模型比最先进的方法提高了17% 。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Region-Wise+Attentive+Multi-View+Representation+Learning+For+Urban+Region+Embedding)|0|

Standard approaches of mitigating such stereotypical biases from deep neural models include modifying the training dataset (pre-processing), or adjusting the model parameters with a bias-specific objective (in-processing). In our work, we approach this bias mitigation from a different perspective - that of an active learning-based selection of a subset of data instances towards training a model optimised for both effectiveness and fairness. Specifically speaking, the imbalances in the attribute value priors can be alleviated by constructing a balanced subset of the data instances with two selection objectives - first, of improving the model confidence of the primary task itself (a standard practice in active learning), and the second, of taking into account the parity of the model predictions with respect to the sensitive attributes, such as gender and race etc. We demonstrate that our proposed selection function achieves better results in terms of both the primary task effectiveness and fairness. The results are further shown to improve when this active learning-based data selection is combined with an in-process method of multi-objective training.|数据驱动(深度)学习方法已经导致数据的参数化抽象，往往导致他们的预测中的刻板的社会偏见，例如，更频繁地预测女性比男性弱，或非裔美国人比白种人更有可能犯罪。从深度神经模型中减轻这种定型偏差的标准方法包括修改训练数据集(预处理) ，或者用偏差特定的目标(在处理中)调整模型参数。在我们的工作中，我们从一个不同的角度来处理这种偏差缓解-这是一个积极的基于学习的选择一个子集的数据实例，以训练一个模型优化的有效性和公平性。具体来说，可以通过构建一个具有两个选择目标的数据实例的平衡子集来缓解属性值先验的不平衡——第一，提高主要任务本身的模型置信度(主动学习的标准实践) ，第二，考虑模型预测相对于敏感属性的平等性，如性别和种族等。实验结果表明，本文提出的选择函数在主要任务有效性和公平性方面都取得了较好的效果。结果进一步表明，当这种基于主动学习的数据选择与过程中的多目标训练方法相结合时，结果得到了改善。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q='Choose+your+Data+Wisely':+Active+Learning+based+Selection+with+Multi-Objective+Optimisation+for+Mitigating+Stereotypes)|0|

Recent research shows that learning a unified model to serve multiple scenarios is effective for improving overall performance. However, it remains challenging to improve model prediction performance across scenarios at low model parameter cost, and current solutions are hard to robustly model multi-scenario diversity. In this paper, we propose MI-DPG for the multi-scenario CVR prediction, which learns scenario-conditioned dynamic model parameters for each scenario in a more efficient and effective manner. Specifically, we introduce an auxiliary network to generate scenario-conditioned dynamic weighting matrices, which are obtained by combining decomposed scenario-specific and scenario-shared low-rank matrices with parameter efficiency. For each scenario, weighting the backbone model parameters by the weighting matrix helps to specialize the model parameters for different scenarios. It can not only modulate the complete parameter space of the backbone model but also improve the model effectiveness. Furthermore, we design a mutual information regularization to enhance the diversity of model parameters across scenarios by maximizing the mutual information between the scenario-aware input and the scenario-conditioned dynamic weighting matrix. Experiments from three real-world datasets show that MI-DPG outperforms previous multi-scenario recommendation models.|转化率(CVR)预测模型在推荐系统中起着至关重要的作用。最近的研究表明，学习一个统一的模型来服务于多种场景对于提高整体性能是有效的。然而，在模型参数成本较低的情景下提高模型预测性能仍然是一个挑战，目前的解决方案难以对多情景多样性进行稳健的模型建模。本文提出了多情景 CVR 预测的 MI-DPG 方法，该方法能够更有效地学习每个情景的情景条件动态模型参数。具体地说，我们引入了一个辅助网络来生成情景条件下的动态权重矩阵，这些权重矩阵是通过将分解的情景特定的和情景共享的低秩矩阵与参数有效性相结合而得到的。对于每个场景，通过加权矩阵对骨干模型参数进行加权，有助于为不同场景专门化模型参数。它不仅可以调节骨干模型的完整参数空间，而且可以提高模型的有效性。此外，我们设计了一个互信息正则化方案，通过最大化情景感知输入和情景条件下的动态加权矩阵之间的互信息来增强不同情景下模型参数的多样性。通过对三个实际数据集的实验表明，MI-DPG 的性能优于以往的多场景推荐模型。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=MI-DPG:+Decomposable+Parameter+Generation+Network+Based+on+Mutual+Information+for+Multi-Scenario+Recommendation)|0|

However, users' preferences for the similarity and diversity of recommendation results are dynamic and vary under different conditions. Moreover, individual item-level diversity is too coarse-grained since all recommended items are related to the trigger item. Thus, the two main challenges are to learn fine-grained representations of similarity and diversity and capture users' dynamic preferences for them under different conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method called the Dynamic Preference-based and Attribute-aware Network (DPAN) for predicting Click-Through Rate (CTR) in relevant recommendations. Specifically, based on Attribute-aware Activation Values Generation (AAVG), Bi-dimensional Compression-based Re-expression (BCR) is designed to obtain similarity and diversity representations of user interests and item information. Then Shallow and Deep Union-based Fusion (SDUF) is proposed to capture users' dynamic preferences for the diverse degree of recommendation results according to various conditions. DPAN has demonstrated its effectiveness through extensive offline experiments and online A/B testing, resulting in a significant 7.62% improvement in CTR. Currently, DPAN has been successfully deployed on our e-commerce platform serving the primary traffic for relevant recommendations.

One such work is SPLADE, which has been shown to lead to state-of-the-art results in both the in-domain and zero-shot settings, can leverage inverted indices for efficient retrieval, and offers enhanced interpretability. However, existing SPLADE models are fundamentally limited to learning a sparse representation based on the native BERT WordPiece vocabulary. In this work, we extend SPLADE to support learning sparse representations over arbitrary sets of tokens to improve flexibility and aid integration with existing retrieval systems. As an illustrative example, we focus on learning a sparse representation over a large (300k) set of unigrams. We add an unsupervised pretraining task on C4 to learn internal representations for new tokens.

Current state-of-the-art models for this task typically employ a cross-encoder structure. However, these models lack access to background knowledge, i.e., information related to the query that can be helpful in retrieving relevant passages. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) provide a structured way of storing information about entities and their relationships, offering valuable background knowledge about entities. While KGs have been used to augment pretrained language models (LMs) to perform several reasoning tasks such as question answering, it remains an open question of how to utilise the information from KGs to enhance the performance of cross-encoders on the passage ranking task. Therefore, we propose KGPR, a KG-enhanced cross-encoder for the Passage Retrieval task. KGPR is built upon LUKE, an entity-aware pretrained LM, with an additional module that fuses information from KGs into LUKE. By leveraging the background knowledge from KGs, KGPR enhances the model's comprehension of queries and passages, resulting in improved ranking performance. Experimental results demonstrate that using KGs can enhance the performance of LUKE in the passage retrieval task, and KGPR can outperform state-of-the-art monoT5 cross-encoder by 3.32% and 10.77% on the MS MARCO development set and TREC DL-HARD query set respectively, using a model with a similar number of parameters.|短文排名的目的是根据一组短文与查询的相关性对它们进行排名。当前用于此任务的最先进模型通常采用交叉编码器结构。然而，这些模型缺乏对背景知识的访问，即与查询相关的信息，这些信息有助于检索相关段落。知识图(KGs)提供了一种结构化的方式来存储有关实体及其关系的信息，并提供有关实体的有价值的背景知识。虽然幼稚园已被用来增加预先训练的语言模型，以执行多项推理任务，例如问题回答，但如何利用幼稚园提供的资料，以提高交叉编码器在短文排名任务中的表现，仍然是一个悬而未决的问题。因此，我们提出 KGPR，一个 KG 增强的交叉编码器的通道检索任务。KGPR 建立在 LUKE 之上，这是一个实体感知的预训练 LM，还有一个附加的模块，将来自 KGs 的信息融合到 LUKE 中。通过利用来自 KG 的背景知识，KGPR 增强了模型对查询和段落的理解，从而提高了排名性能。实验结果表明，在文章检索任务中使用 KGs 可以提高 LUKE 的性能，在参数相似的模型下，KGPR 在 MS MARCO 开发集和 TREC DL-HARD 查询集上的性能分别比单 T5交叉编码器的性能提高3.32% 和10.77% 。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=KGPR:+Knowledge+Graph+Enhanced+Passage+Ranking)|0|

As a solution, we propose a factored approach, where the mention-context dependencies are represented in a more fine-grained manner, thus allowing the model parameters to better adjust to the different characteristic patterns inherent within the data.

Unlike universal e-commerce platforms such as Taobao and Amazon, user behaviors and interests on the OFD platform are more location and time-sensitive due to limited delivery ranges and regional commodity supplies. However, existing CTR prediction algorithms in OFD scenarios concentrate on capturing interest from historical behavior sequences, which fails to effectively model the complex spatiotemporal information within features, leading to poor performance. To address this challenge, this paper introduces the Contrastive Sres under different search states using three modules: contrastive spatiotemporal representation learning (CSRL), spatiotemporal preference extractor (StPE), and spatiotemporal information filter (StIF). CSRL utilizes a contrastive learning framework to generate a spatiotemporal activation representation (SAR) for the search action. StPE employs SAR to activate users' diverse preferences related to location and time from the historical behavior sequence field, using a multi-head attention mechanism. StIF incorporates SAR into a gating network to automatically capture important features with latent spatiotemporal effects. Extensive experiments conducted on two large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of CSPM. Notably, CSPM has been successfully deployed in Alibaba's online OFD platform Ele.me, resulting in a significant 0.88% lift in CTR, which has substantial business implications.|点进率预测是网上按需供应食物平台的一项重要工作，目的是准确估计使用者点击食物项目的机会。与淘宝和亚马逊等通用电子商务平台不同，OFD 平台上的用户行为和兴趣更具地点和时间敏感性，因为交付范围和区域性商品供应有限。然而，现有的 OFD 场景下的 CTR 预测算法主要集中于从历史行为序列中获取兴趣，未能有效地模拟特征中复杂的时空信息，导致性能较差。为了解决这一问题，本文使用了三个模块: 对比时空表示学习(CSRL)、时空偏好提取器(StPE)和时空信息过滤器(StIF) ，介绍了不同搜索状态下的对比 Sres。CSRL 利用对比学习框架生成搜索动作的时空激活表示(SAR)。STPE 利用多头注意机制，从历史行为序列场中激活用户与位置和时间相关的多样化偏好。STIF 将合成孔径雷达(SAR)与门控网络相结合，自动捕获具有潜在时空效应的重要特征。在两个大规模工业数据集上进行的大量实验证明了 CSPM 的最新性能。值得注意的是，cSPM 已成功部署在阿里巴巴的在线 OFD 平台 Ele.me 上，使点击率大幅提高了0.88% ，这对商业具有重大意义。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=CSPM:+A+Contrastive+Spatiotemporal+Preference+Model+for+CTR+Prediction+in+On-Demand+Food+Delivery+Services)|0|

Recently, Adaptive Feature Selection (AdaFS) has shown remarkable performance by adaptively selecting features for each data instance, considering that the importance of a given feature field can vary significantly across data. However, this method still has limitations in that its selection process could be easily biased to major features that frequently occur. To address these problems, we propose Multi-view Feature Selection (MvFS), which selects informative features for each instance more effectively. Most importantly, MvFS employs a multi-view network consisting of multiple sub-networks, each of which learns to measure the feature importance of a part of data with different feature patterns. By doing so, MvFS promotes a more balanced feature selection process mitigating the bias problem towards dominant patterns.

Recent off-policy evaluation methods involve these responses by simultaneously maximizing expected cumulative rewards. However, two aspects of these methods require further consideration. Firstly, from the system's point of view, candidates with various values are interchangeable, which may result in contradictory future recommendations despite having the same interaction history. Secondly, rewards are manually designed, which necessitates a trial-and-error approach to strike a balance between training stabilization and reward distinction. To address these issues, we propose a new sequential recommender system called NCM4Rec. Specifically, for the distinction problem, NCM4Rec achieves counterfactual consistency via a neural causal model, which is learnable yet equally expressive as classic structural causal models. Such consistency is maintained by a Gumbel-Max design. For the representing problem, NCM4Rec encodes different types of responses as one-hot vectors and captures the long-term preference via adversarial learning. As a consequence, NCM4Rec is both adaptive and identifiable. Both theoretical analyses of the consistency and empirical studies over two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.|长期的用户响应，即电子商务平台上的点击或购买，对于顺序推荐系统至关重要。最近的非政策性评估方法通过同时最大化预期累积回报来涉及这些反应。然而，这些方法的两个方面需要进一步考虑。首先，从系统的角度来看，具有不同价值观的候选人是可以互换的，这可能会导致相互矛盾的未来推荐，尽管有相同的互动历史。其次，奖励是手工设计的，这就需要一个试错法来平衡训练的稳定性和奖励的区别。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一个新的连续推荐系统，称为 NCM4rec。具体来说，对于区分问题，NCM4Rec 通过一个神经因果模型来实现反事实的一致性，这个模型是可以学习的，但是与经典的结构因果模型同样具有表现力。这种一致性是由 Gumbel-Max 设计保持的。对于表示问题，NCM4Rec 将不同类型的响应编码为一个热向量，并通过对抗学习获取长期偏好。因此，NCM4Rec 既是自适应的，也是可识别的。对两个实际数据集的一致性理论分析和实证研究都证明了该方法的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Counterfactual+Adversarial+Learning+for+Recommendation)|0|

However, due to a lack of interpretability, why the multi-vector method outperforms its single-vector counterpart has not been fully studied. To fill this research gap, in this work, we investigate and compare the behaviors of single-vector and multi-vector models in retrieval. Specifically, we analyze the vocabulary distribution of dense representations by mapping them back to the sparse, vocabulary space. Our empirical findings show that the multi-vector representation has more lexical overlaps between queries and passages. Additionally, we show that this feature of multi-vector representation can enhance its ranking performance when a given passage can fulfill different information needs and thus can be retrieved by different queries. These results shed light on the internal mechanisms of multi-vector representation and may provide new perspectives for future research.|虽然密集检索已经成为传统文本检索模型(如 BM25)的一个有前途的替代方案，但最近的一些研究表明，多向量密集检索模型在检索任务中比单向量方法更有效。然而，由于缺乏可解释性，为什么多向量方法的性能优于单向量方法还没有得到充分的研究。为了填补这一研究空白，本文对单向量模型和多向量模型在检索中的行为进行了研究和比较。具体来说，我们通过将密集表示映射回稀疏的词汇空间来分析它们的词汇分布。我们的实证结果表明，多向量表示在查询和段落之间有更多的词汇重叠。此外，我们还发现，当一个给定的段落可以满足不同的信息需求时，这种多向量表示特征可以提高其排序性能，从而可以通过不同的查询进行检索。这些结果揭示了多向量表示的内在机制，为今后的研究提供了新的视角。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Understanding+the+Multi-vector+Dense+Retrieval+Models)|0|

To further provide rigorous privacy protection with consideration of the varying privacy requirements across different clients, a privacy-enhanced line of work on personalized differentially private federated learning (PDP-FL) has been proposed. However, the existing solution for PDP-FL [20] assumes the raw privacy budgets of all clients should be collected by the server. These values are then directly utilized to improve the model utility via facilitating the privacy preferences partitioning (i.e., partitioning all clients into multiple privacy groups). It is however non-realistic because the raw privacy budgets can be quite informative and sensitive. In this work, our goal is to achieve PDP-FL without exposing clients' raw privacy budgets by indirectly partitioning the privacy preferences solely based on clients' noisy model updates. The crux lies in the fact that the noisy updates could be influenced by two entangled factors of DP noises and non-IID clients' data, leaving it unknown whether it is possible to uncover privacy preferences by disentangling the two affecting factors. To overcome the hurdle, we systematically investigate the unexplored question of under what conditions can the model updates of clients be primarily influenced by noise levels rather than data distribution. Then, we propose a simple yet effective strategy based on clustering the L2 norm of the noisy updates, which can be integrated into the vanilla PDP-FL to maintain the same performance.

O'Connor|University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; Dublin City University, Dublin, Ireland|\beginabstract Recently, modelling heterogeneous interactions in recommender systems has attracted research interest. Real-world scenarios involve sequential multi-type user-item interactions such as ''shape view'', ''shape add-to-favourites'', ''shape add-to-cart'' and ''shape purchase''. Graph Neural Network (GNN) methods have been widely adopted in Representation Learning of similar sequential user-item interactions. Promising results have been achieved by the integration of GNNs and transformers for self-attention. However, GNN based methods suffer from limited capability in handling global user-item interaction dependencies, particularly for long sequences. Moreover, these models require high computational cost of transformers, due to the quadratic memory and time complexity with respect to sequence length. This results in memory bottlenecks and slow training especially in computational resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, we propose the FATH model which employs Flash Attention mechanism to reduce the high-bandwidth memory usage over higher-order user-item interaction sequences. Experimental results show that our model improves the training speed and reduces the memory usage with better recommendation performance in comparison with the state-of the art baselines.|近年来，在推荐系统中建立异构交互模型引起了人们的研究兴趣。真实世界的场景涉及连续的多类型用户项交互，如“形状视图”、“形状添加到收藏夹”、“形状添加到购物车”和“形状购买”。图神经网络(GNN)方法已被广泛应用于相似序列用户-项目交互的表示学习。全球导航卫星系统和变压器的结合为自我关注取得了令人鼓舞的成果。然而，基于 GNN 的方法在处理全局用户项交互依赖性方面能力有限，特别是对于长序列。此外，这些模型需要高计算成本的变压器，由于二次记忆和时间复杂度相对序列长度。这导致了内存瓶颈和训练速度缓慢，特别是在计算资源受限的环境中。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了基于 Flash 注意机制的 FATH 模型，以降低高阶用户项交互序列的高带宽内存使用。实验结果表明，该模型提高了训练速度，减少了内存使用，与目前最先进的基线相比，具有更好的推荐性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=A+Flash+Attention+Transformer+for+Multi-Behaviour+Recommendation)|0|

In contrast, there has been little research on retrieving data with multiple aspects using dense models. In the scenarios such as product search, the aspect information plays an essential role in relevance matching, e.g., category: Electronics, Computers, and Pet Supplies. A common way of leveraging aspect information for multi-aspect retrieval is to introduce an auxiliary classification objective, i.e., using item contents to predict the annotated value IDs of item aspects. However, by learning the value embeddings from scratch, this approach may not capture the various semantic similarities between the values sufficiently. To address this limitation, we leverage the aspect information as text strings rather than class IDs during pre-training so that their semantic similarities can be naturally captured in the PLMs. To facilitate effective retrieval with the aspect strings, we propose mutual prediction objectives between the text of the item aspect and content. In this way, our model makes more sufficient use of aspect information than conducting undifferentiated masked language modeling (MLM) on the concatenated text of aspects and content. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets (product and mini-program search) show that our approach can outperform competitive baselines both treating aspect values as classes and conducting the same MLM for aspect and content strings.

Most graph collaborative filtering methods embed graphs in the Euclidean spaces, but that could have high distortion when embedding graphs with tree-likeness structure. Recently, some researchers address this problem by learning the feature representations in the hyperbolic spaces. However, because the user-item interaction graphs also have cyclic structure, the high-order collaborative signal cannot be well captured by hyperbolic spaces. From this point of view, neither Euclidean spaces nor hyperbolic spaces can capture the full information from the complexity of user-item interactions. Therefore, how to construct a suitable embedding space for graph collaboration filtering is an important problem. In this paper, we analyze the properties of hyperbolic geometry in graph collaborative filtering tasks and proposed a novel geometry interaction augmented graph collaborative filtering (GeoGCF) method, which leverages both Euclidean and hyperbolic geometry to model the user-item interactions.

Representation learning on the hypersphere is a promising approach due to its desirable properties, such as alignment and uniformity. However, the sparsity issue arises when it encounters RecSys. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach, graph-based alignment and uniformity (GraphAU), that explicitly considers high-order connectivities in the user-item bipartite graph. GraphAU aligns the user/item embedding to the dense vector representations of high-order neighbors using a neighborhood aggregator, eliminating the need to compute the burdensome alignment to high-order neighborhoods individually. To address the discrepancy in alignment losses, GraphAU includes a layer-wise alignment pooling module to integrate alignment losses layer-wise. Experiments on four datasets show that GraphAU significantly alleviates the sparsity issue and achieves state-of-the-art performance. We open-source GraphAU at https://github.com/YangLiangwei/GraphAU.|基于协同过滤的推荐系统(RecSys)依赖于用户和项目的学习表示来准确预测偏好。超球面上的表示学习是一种很有前途的学习方法，因为它具有良好的对齐性和一致性等特性。然而，当它遇到 RecSys 时，稀疏性问题就出现了。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新的方法——基于图的对齐和一致性(GraphAU) ，它明确地考虑了用户项二部图中的高阶连通性。GraphAU 使用邻域聚合器将嵌入的用户/项目对齐到高阶邻居的密集向量表示，从而消除了单独计算高阶邻居的繁琐对齐的需要。为了解决对齐损失中的差异，GraphAU 包括一个分层对齐池模块，以分层集成对齐损失。在四个数据集上的实验表明，GraphAU 显著地缓解了稀疏性问题，并达到了最先进的性能。我们 https://github.com/yangliangwei/GraphAU 开源 GraphAU。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Graph-based+Alignment+and+Uniformity+for+Recommendation)|0|

Hence, an update to the SLU model needs to ensure improvements not only in the model specific metrics but also in the overall conversational assistant performance. Specifically, the impact on user interaction quality metrics must be factored in, while integrating interactions with distal modules upstream and downstream of the SLU component. We develop a ML model that makes it possible to gauge the interaction quality metrics due to SLU model changes before a production launch. The proposed model is a multi-modal transformer with a gated mechanism that conditions on text embeddings, output of a BERT model pre-trained on conversational data, and the hypotheses of the SLU classifiers with the corresponding confidence scores.

|[pADR: Towards Personalized Adverse Drug Reaction Prediction by Modeling Multi-sourced Data](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615490)|Junyu Luo, Cheng Qian, Xiaochen Wang, Lucas Glass, Fenglong Ma|The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA; IQVIA, Chicago, IL, USA|Predicting adverse drug reactions (ADRs) of drugs is one of the most critical steps in drug development. By pre-estimating the adverse reactions, researchers and drug development companies can greatly prevent the potential ADR risks and tragedies. However, the current ADR prediction methods suffer from several limitations. First, the prediction results are based on pure drug-related information, which makes them impossible to be directly applied for the personalized ADR prediction task. The lack of personalization of models also makes rare adverse events hard to be predicted. Therefore, it is of great interest to develop a new personalized ADR prediction method by introducing additional sources, e.g., patient health records. However, few methods have tried to use additional sources. In the meantime, the variety of different source formats and structures makes this task more challenging. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel personalized multi-sourced-based drug adverse reaction prediction model named pADR. pADR first works on every single source to transform them into proper representations. Next, a hierarchical multi-sourced Transformer is designed to automatically model the interactions between different sources and fuse them together for the final adverse event prediction. Experimental results on a new multi-sourced ADR prediction dataset show that pADR1 outperforms state-of-the-art drug-based baselines. Moreover, the case and ablation studies also illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed fusion strategies and the reasonableness of each module design.|预测药物不良反应(ADR)是药物开发过程中最关键的步骤之一。通过预测不良反应，研究人员和药物开发公司可以大大防止潜在的不良反应风险和悲剧。然而，目前的药品不良反应预测方法存在一些局限性。首先，预测结果基于纯药物相关信息，不可能直接应用于个性化的药品不良反应预测任务。缺乏个性化的模型也使罕见的不良事件难以预测。因此，开发一种新的个性化的 ADR 预测方法，通过引入额外的资源，如病人健康记录，是非常有意义的。然而，很少有方法尝试使用其他来源。与此同时，各种不同的源格式和结构使这项任务更具挑战性。为了应对上述挑战，我们提出了一种新的个性化的基于多来源的药物不良反应预测模型 pADR。PADR 首先对每一个源进行处理，将它们转换成适当的表示。接下来，设计了一个分层的多源变压器，自动建模不同源之间的交互，并将它们融合在一起进行最终的不良事件预测。在一个新的多源 ADR 预测数据集上的实验结果表明，pADR1的表现优于最先进的基于药物的基线。此外，实例和烧蚀研究也说明了我们提出的融合策略的有效性和每个模块设计的合理性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=pADR:+Towards+Personalized+Adverse+Drug+Reaction+Prediction+by+Modeling+Multi-sourced+Data)|0|

To satisfy users, music platforms usually rely on recommender systems that learn users' preferences over individual tracks and rank the tracks within each playlist according to the learned preferences. However, such rankings often do not fully exploit the sequential nature of the users' consumption, which may result in a lower within-a-session consumption. In this paper, we model the sequential within-a-session preferences of users and propose an optimisation-based sequencing approach that allows for optimally incorporating such preferences into the rankings. To this end, we rely on interaction data of a major music streaming service to identify two most common aspects of the users' sequential preferences: (1) Position-Aware preferences, and (2) Local-Sequential preferences. We propose a sequencing model that can leverage each of these aspects optimally to maximise the expected total consumption from the session. We further perform an extensive offline and off-policy evaluation of our model, and carry out a large scale online randomised control trial with 7M users across 80 countries. Our findings confirm that we can effectively incorporate sequential preferences of users into our sequencer to make users complete more and skip less tracks within their listening sessions.|音乐流媒体平台的用户通常通过与个性化播放列表交互，在会话中连续消费歌曲。为了满足用户的需求，音乐平台通常依赖于推荐系统来了解用户对单曲的偏好，并根据学到的偏好对每个播放列表中的曲目进行排名。然而，这样的排名往往没有充分利用用户消费的顺序性质，这可能导致较低的会话内消费。在这篇论文中，我们模拟了用户在一个会话内的顺序偏好，并提出了一个基于优化的排序方法，允许将这些偏好最佳地纳入到排名中。为此，我们依靠一个主流音乐流媒体服务的交互数据来识别用户顺序偏好的两个最常见的方面: (1)位置感知偏好和(2)本地顺序偏好。我们提出了一个排序模型，可以最佳地利用这些方面中的每一个来最大化会话的预期总消耗。我们进一步对我们的模型进行了广泛的离线和非政策评估，并在80个国家的700万用户中进行了大规模的在线随机对照试验。我们的研究结果证实，我们可以有效地将用户的顺序偏好纳入我们的音序器，使用户完成更多，跳过更少的轨道在他们的听力会议。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Exploiting+Sequential+Music+Preferences+via+Optimisation-Based+Sequencing)|0|

In the context of geocoding, it augments the user query to match all relevant entities in indexed data. This work presents an end-to-end trainable attention-based query rewriting model for geocoding. Most recent works attempt to solve query rewriting with sequence-to-sequence models, which often fail to satisfy the tight latency constraints of production environments. Toward developing a low latency model, we formulate it as a combination of multiple token classification tasks. We introduce numerous novel techniques, such as constructing a separate output space for alterations containing whole words to tackle many-to-one/one-to-many associations, using regular expression rules as prediction classes to handle the limitations of having a non-word piece prediction space, and curbing the output space for each wordpiece in our vocabulary to reduce inference time by 20x in average. We also present a data generation pipeline that generates train/test data without human judgment from the query logs. Through offline and online experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed model is orders of magnitude faster than their seq2seq and SMT-based counterparts in inference time, achieves better/on-par performance, and improves the relevance of overall geocoding.|查询重写旨在弥合用户查询和索引数据之间的差距。在地理编码的上下文中，它扩展用户查询以匹配索引数据中的所有相关实体。提出了一种基于端到端可训练注意的地理编码查询重写模型。最近的工作尝试用序列到序列模型来解决查询重写问题，这种模型往往不能满足生产环境的严格延迟约束。为了开发一个低延迟模型，我们将其描述为多个令牌分类任务的组合。我们引入了许多新颖的技术，例如构建一个单独的输出空间，用于包含整个单词的修改以处理多对一/一对多的关联，使用正则表达式规则作为预测类来处理具有非单词片段预测空间的局限性，以及限制词汇表中每个单词片段的输出空间以平均减少20倍的推理时间。我们还提供了一个数据生成流水线，该流水线生成列车/测试数据，而不需要从查询日志中进行人工判断。通过离线和在线实验，我们证明了所提出的模型在推理时间上比基于 seq2seq 和基于 SMT 的对应数量级更快，获得了更好/同等的性能，并提高了整体地理编码的相关性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Deep+Query+Rewriting+For+Geocoding)|0|

Phillips|Visa Resarch, Palo Alto, CA, USA; University of California, Riverside, Riverside, CA, USA; Visa Research, Palo Alto, CA, USA; University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA|A Content-based Time Series Retrieval (CTSR) system is an information retrieval system for users to interact with time series emerged from multiple domains, such as finance, healthcare, and manufacturing. For example, users seeking to learn more about the source of a time series can submit the time series as a query to the CTSR system and retrieve a list of relevant time series with associated metadata. By analyzing the retrieved metadata, users can gather more information about the source of the time series. Because the CTSR system is required to work with time series data from diverse domains, it needs a high-capacity model to effectively measure the similarity between different time series. On top of that, the model within the CTSR system has to compute the similarity scores in an efficient manner as the users interact with the system in real-time. In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient CTSR model that outperforms alternative models, while still providing reasonable inference runtimes. To demonstrate the capability of the proposed method in solving business problems, we compare it against alternative models using our in-house transaction data.

TV users usually distribute in multiple regions with different cultures and hence have diverse TV program preferences. From the perspective of engineering practice and performance improvement, it's very essential to model users from multiple regions with one single model. In previous work, Multi-gate Mixture-of-Expert (MMoE) has been widely adopted in multi-task and multi-domain recommendation scenarios. In practice, however, we first observe the embeddings generated by experts tend to be homogeneous which may result in high semantic similarities among embeddings that reduce the capability of Multi-gate Mixture-of-Expert (MMoE) model. Secondly, we also find there are lots of commonalities and differences between multiple regions regarding user preferences. Therefore, it's meaningful to model the complicated relationships between regions. In this paper, we first introduce contrastive learning to overcome the expert representation degeneration problem. The embeddings of two augmented samples generated by the same experts are pushed closer to enhance the alignment, and the embeddings of the same samples generated by different experts are pushed away in vector space to improve uniformity. Then we propose a Graph-based Gating Mechanism to empower typical Multi-gate Mixture-of-Experts. Graph-based MMoE is able to recognize the commonalities and differences among multiple regions by introducing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with region similarity prior. We name our model Multi-gate Mixture-of-Contrastive-Experts model with Graph-based Gating Mechanism (MMoCEG). Extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests on a commercial TV service provider over 100 million users and 2.3 million items demonstrate the efficacy of MMoCEG compared to the existing models.|随着智能电视的迅速发展，电视推荐正在吸引越来越多的用户。电视用户通常分布在具有不同文化的多个地区，因此有不同的电视节目偏好。从工程实践和性能改进的角度来看，用一个单一的模型对来自多个地区的用户进行建模是非常必要的。在以往的工作中，多门专家混合(MMoE)已经被广泛应用于多任务和多领域的推荐场景中。然而，在实际应用中，我们首先观察到由专家生成的嵌入趋于同质，这可能导致嵌入之间的语义相似度很高，从而降低了多门专家混合(MMoE)模型的性能。其次，我们还发现，在用户偏好方面，不同地区之间存在很多共性和差异。因此，建立区域间的复杂关系模型具有重要意义。在本文中，我们首先引入对比学习来克服专家表示退化问题。同一专家产生的两个增广样本的嵌入被推近以提高对齐度，同时不同专家产生的相同样本的嵌入被推远以提高向量空间的均匀性。然后提出了一种基于图的门控机制来增强典型的多门混合专家系统的能力。基于图的 MMoE 能够通过引入具有区域相似性的图神经网络(GNN)来识别多个区域之间的共性和差异。我们将该模型命名为基于图形的门控机制(MMoCEG)的多门控混合对比专家模型。与现有模型相比，MMoCEG 在一个拥有1亿用户和230万条目的商业电视服务提供商上进行了大量的离线实验和在线 A/B 测试，证明了 MMoCEG 的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Multi-gate+Mixture-of-Contrastive-Experts+with+Graph-based+Gating+Mechanism+for+TV+Recommendation)|0|

However, due to the training strategy of Empirical Risk Minimization, CF models tend to favor popular items, resulting in inferior performance on sparse users and items. To enhance the CF representation learning of sparse users and items without sacrificing the performance of popular items, we propose a novel Popularity- aware Distributionally Robust Optimization (PDRO) framework. In particular, PDRO emphasizes the optimization of sparse users/items, while incorporating item popularity to preserve the performance of popular items through two modules. First, an implicit module develops a new popularity-aware DRO objective, paying more attention to items that will potentially become popular over time. Second, an explicit module that directly predicts the popularity of items to help the estimation of user-item matching scores. We apply PDRO to a micro-video recommendation scenario and implement it on two representative backend models.

KG embeddings map entities and relations into a vector space while preserving their relational semantics. This enables effective inference of missing knowledge from the embedding space. Most KG embedding approaches focused on triple-shaped KGs. A great amount of real-world knowledge, however, cannot simply be represented by triples. In this tutorial, we give a systematic introduction to KG embeddings that go beyond the triple representation. In particular, the tutorial will focus on temporal facts where the triples are enriched with temporal information, hyper-relational facts where the triples are enriched with qualifiers, n-ary facts describing relationships between multiple entities, and also facts that are augmented with literal and text descriptions. During the tutorial, we will introduce both fundamental knowledge and advanced topics for understanding recent embedding approaches for beyond-triple representations.|知识图(KGs)是描述通过关系连接的实体的事实的集合。KG 嵌入将实体和关系映射到向量空间，同时保留它们的关系语义。这使得能够从嵌入空间有效地推断缺失的知识。大多数幼稚园的嵌入方法集中在三重形状的幼稚园。然而，现实世界中的大量知识不能简单地用三元组来表示。在本教程中，我们将系统地介绍超越三重表示的 KG 嵌入。特别是，本教程将重点关注三元组充满时间信息的时间事实，三元组充满修饰符的超关系事实，描述多个实体之间关系的 n 元事实，以及用文字和文本描述增强的事实。在本教程中，我们将介绍基础知识和高级主题，以便理解超越三重表示的最新嵌入方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Reasoning+beyond+Triples:+Recent+Advances+in+Knowledge+Graph+Embeddings)|0|

We introduce a new dataset, ChatGPT-RetrievalQA, and compare the effectiveness of strong models fine-tuned on both LLM-generated and human-generated data. We build ChatGPT-RetrievalQA based on an existing dataset, human ChatGPT Comparison Corpus (HC3), consisting of public question collections with human responses and answers from ChatGPT. We fine-tune a range of cross-encoder re-rankers on either human-generated or ChatGPT-generated data. Our evaluation on MS MARCO DEV, TREC DL'19, and TREC DL'20 demonstrates that cross-encoder re-ranking models trained on LLM-generated responses are significantly more effective for out-of-domain re-ranking than those trained on human responses. For in-domain re-ranking, the human-trained re-rankers outperform the LLM-trained re-rankers. Our novel findings suggest that generative LLMs have high potential in generating training data for neural retrieval models and can be used to augment training data, especially in domains with smaller amounts of labeled data.

It provides retrieval capabilities for both "traditional" bag-of-words retrieval models such as BM25 as well as retrieval using learned sparse representations such as SPLADE. With Pyserini, which provides a Python interface to Anserini, users gain access to both sparse and dense retrieval models, as Pyserini implements bindings to the Faiss vector search library alongside Lucene inverted indexes in a uniform, consistent interface. Nevertheless, hybrid fusion techniques that integrate sparse and dense retrieval models need to stitch together results from two completely different "software stacks", which creates unnecessary complexities and inefficiencies. However, the introduction of HNSW indexes for dense vector search in Lucene promises the integration of both dense and sparse retrieval within a single software framework. We explore exactly this integration in the context of Anserini. Experiments on the MS MARCO passage and BEIR datasets show that our Anserini HNSW integration supports (reasonably) effective and (reasonably) efficient approximate nearest neighbor search for dense retrieval models, using only Lucene.|Anserini 是一个基于 Lucene 的工具包，用于在 Java 中进行可重复的信息检索研究，在社区中获得了越来越多的关注。它为“传统的”单词检索模型(如 BM25)以及使用学习稀疏表示(如 SPLADE)的检索提供了检索能力。Pyserini 为 Anserini 提供了一个 Python 界面，用户可以访问稀疏和密集的检索模型，因为 Pyserini 实现了对 Faiss 矢量搜索库的绑定，以及在统一、一致的界面中的 Lucene 反向索引。然而，集成稀疏和密集检索模型的混合融合技术需要将来自两个完全不同的“软件栈”的结果拼接在一起，这造成了不必要的复杂性和效率低下。然而，在 Lucene 引入用于密集向量搜索的 HNSW 索引有望在单一软件框架内实现密集和稀疏检索的集成。我们正是在 Anserini 的背景下探讨这种一体化。对 MS MARCO 通道和 BEIR 数据集的实验表明，我们的 Anserini HNSW 集成只使用 Lucene 支持(合理地)有效和(合理地)近似最近邻搜索密集检索模型。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Anserini+Gets+Dense+Retrieval:+Integration+of+Lucene's+HNSW+Indexes)|0|

To alleviate the potential error, most previous works mainly consider aleatoric uncertainty arising from the inherit data noise. This may however lead to overconfidence in incorrect predictions and thus limit the performance. In this paper, we take advantage of Deterministic Uncertainty Methods (DUM) to explore the epistemic uncertainty, which reflects accurately the domain gap depending on the model choice and parameter fitting trained on source domain. The epistemic uncertainty on target domain is evaluated on-the-fly to facilitate online reweighting and correction in the self-training process. Meanwhile, to tackle the class-wise quantity and learning difficulty imbalance problem, we introduce a novel data resampling strategy to promote simultaneous convergence across different categories. This strategy prevents the class-level over-fitting in source domain and further boosts the adaptation performance by better quantifying the uncertainty in target domain. We illustrate the superiority of our method compared with the state-of-the-art methods.|在领域自适应分割中，领域移位可能导致目标领域的高置信度预测错误，从而导致自学习效果差。为了减小潜在的误差，以往的工作主要考虑由继承数据噪声引起的任意不确定性。然而，这可能导致对错误预测的过度自信，从而限制了性能。本文利用确定性不确定性方法(DUM)对认知不确定性进行了研究，根据源域上训练的模型选择和参数拟合，准确地反映了领域间的差异。在自我训练过程中，对目标域上的认知不确定性进行动态评估，以便于在线加权和校正。同时，为了解决类别数量和学习困难不平衡的问题，我们引入了一种新的数据重采样策略，以促进不同类别之间的同时收敛。该策略防止了源域中的类级过拟合，并通过更好地量化目标域中的不确定性进一步提高了自适应性能。我们说明了我们的方法相对于最先进的方法的优越性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Explore+Epistemic+Uncertainty+in+Domain+Adaptive+Semantic+Segmentation)|0|

In this work, we propose a Temporal Convolutional Explorer (TCE) to empirically explore the learning behavior of 1D-CNNs from the perspective of the frequency domain. Our TCE analysis highlights that deeper 1D-CNNs tend to distract the focus from the low-frequency components leading to the accuracy degradation phenomenon, and the disturbing convolution is the driving factor. Then, we leverage our findings to the practical application and propose a regulatory framework, which can easily be integrated into existing 1D-CNNs. It aims to rectify the suboptimal learning behavior by enabling the network to selectively bypass the specified disturbing convolutions. Finally, through comprehensive experiments on widely-used UCR, UEA, and UCI benchmarks, we demonstrate that 1) TCE's insight into 1D-CNN's learning behavior; 2) our regulatory framework enables state-of-the-art 1D-CNNs to get improved performances with less consumption of memory and computational overhead.|虽然一维卷积神经网络(1D-CNN)已经被经验证明在时间序列分类任务中是有效的，但是我们发现在其应用中仍然存在可能出现的不良结果，促使我们进一步调查和理解其潜在的机制。在本研究中，我们提出了一个时间卷积探索器(TCE) ，从频率域的角度对1D-CNN 的学习行为进行实证研究。我们的 TCE 分析强调，更深的1D-CNN 往往会分散对低频分量的关注，导致精度退化现象，干扰卷积是驱动因素。然后，我们利用我们的研究结果的实际应用，并提出了一个监管框架，这可以很容易地集成到现有的1D-CNN。它的目的是纠正次优学习行为，使网络能够有选择地绕过指定的干扰卷积。最后，通过对广泛使用的 UCR，UEA 和 UCI 基准的全面实验，我们证明了1) TCE 对1D-CNN 学习行为的洞察力; 2)我们的监管框架使最先进的1D-CNN 能够以更少的内存消耗和计算开销获得改善的性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Temporal+Convolutional+Explorer+Helps+Understand+1D-CNN's+Learning+Behavior+in+Time+Series+Classification+from+Frequency+Domain)|0|

However, the self-attention mechanism has a quadratic computational complexity of O(n^2), as it conducts interactions among all item pairs in the sequence. This can lead to expensive model training and slow inference speeds, which may hinder practical deployment. To this end, we pursue to develop alternative approaches to improve the efficiency of the self-attention mechanism. We observe that the attention scores calculated from each item interacting with other items (including itself) are sparse, indicating that there are limited valuable item pairs (with non-zero attention weight) that contribute to the final output. This motivates us to develop effective strategies for discerning valuable items and computing attention scores solely for these items, thereby minimizing the consumption of unnecessary computations. Herein, we present a novel Progressive Sampling-based Self-Attention (PS-SA) mechanism, which utilizes a learnable progressive sampling strategy to identify the most valuable items. Subsequently, we solely utilize these selected items to produce the final output. Experiments on academic and production datasets demonstrate PS-SA could still achieve promising results while reducing computational costs. It is notable that we have successfully deployed it on Alibaba display advertising system, resulting in a 2.6% CTR and 1.3% RPM increase.|由于自我注意机制提供了捕获序列关系的强大功能，因此在推荐系统中使用自我注意机制对用户行为序列进行建模越来越受到欢迎。然而，自我注意机制具有 O (n ^ 2)的二次计算复杂度，因为它在序列中的所有项目对之间进行交互作用。这可能导致昂贵的模型训练和缓慢的推理速度，这可能会阻碍实际部署。为此，我们寻求发展替代方法，以提高自我注意机制的效率。我们观察到，从每个项目与其他项目(包括它自己)的相互作用中计算出的注意力得分是稀疏的，表明有限的有价值的项目对(非零注意力重量)有助于最终的输出。这促使我们制定有效的策略来识别有价值的项目，并仅仅为这些项目计算注意力分数，从而最大限度地减少不必要的计算消耗。本文提出了一种新的基于递进抽样的自我注意机制(PS-SA) ，该机制利用一种可学习的递进抽样策略来识别最有价值的项目。随后，我们只利用这些选定的项目来产生最终的输出。在学术和生产数据集上的实验表明，PS-SA 在降低计算成本的同时，仍然可以取得有希望的结果。值得注意的是，我们已经成功地在阿里巴巴展示广告系统中使用了它，点击率和每分钟转速分别提高了2.6% 和1.3% 。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=PS-SA:+An+Efficient+Self-Attention+via+Progressive+Sampling+for+User+Behavior+Sequence+Modeling)|0|

Rossi, Paavan Kumar Indela, Veda Pranav Parwatala, Srinjayee Paul, Aurghya Maiti|Adobe Research, San Jose, CA, USA; Adobe Research, Bangalore, India|Users' behavioral footprints online enable firms to discover behavior-based user segments (or, segments) and deliver segment specific messages to users. Following the discovery of segments, delivery of messages to users through preferred media channels like Facebook and Google can be challenging, as only a portion of users in a behavior segment find match in a medium, and only a fraction of those matched actually see the message (exposure). Even high quality discovery becomes futile when delivery fails. Many sophisticated algorithms exist for discovering behavioral segments; however, these ignore the delivery component. The problem is compounded because (i) the discovery is performed on the behavior data space in firms' data (e.g., user clicks), while the delivery is predicated on the static data space (e.g., geo, age) as defined by media; and (ii) firms work under budget constraint. We introduce a stochastic optimization based algorithm for delivery optimized discovery of behavioral user segments and offer new metrics to address the joint optimization. We leverage optimization under a budget constraint for delivery combined with a learning-based component for discovery. Extensive experiments on a public dataset from Google and a proprietary dataset show the effectiveness of our approach by simultaneously improving delivery metrics, reducing budget spend and achieving strong predictive performance in discovery.|用户的在线行为足迹使企业能够发现基于行为的用户段(或段) ，并向用户传递段特定的信息。随着信息片段的发现，通过 Facebook 和 Google 这样的首选媒体渠道向用户传递信息可能是一个挑战，因为在行为片段中只有一部分用户在媒介中找到匹配，而且只有一小部分匹配的用户实际上看到了信息(曝光)。当交付失败时，即使是高质量的发现也是徒劳的。存在许多发现行为片段的复杂算法; 然而，这些算法忽略了传递组件。这个问题是复杂的，因为(i)发现是在企业数据的行为数据空间(例如，用户点击)上执行的，而交付是在媒体定义的静态数据空间(例如，地理位置，年龄)上进行的; (ii)企业在预算线下工作。提出了一种基于随机优化的行为用户段发现算法，并提出了一种新的度量方法来解决联合优化问题。我们利用优化的预算线，结合基于学习的组件进行发现。对来自 Google 的公共数据集和专有数据集进行的大量实验表明，我们的方法通过同时改进交付指标、减少预算开支和在发现方面实现强大的预测性能来显示有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Delivery+Optimized+Discovery+in+Behavioral+User+Segmentation+under+Budget+Constraint)|0|
|[Understanding User Immersion in Online Short Video Interaction](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615099)|Zhiyu He, Shaorun Zhang, Peijie Sun, Jiayu Li, Xiaohui Xie, Min Zhang, Yiqun Liu|Tsinghua University, Beijing, China|Short video~(SV) online streaming has been one of the most popular Internet applications in recent years. When browsing SVs, users gradually immerse themselves and derive relaxation or knowledge. Whereas prolonged browsing will lead to a decline in positive feelings, users continue due to inertia, resulting in decreased satisfaction. Immersion is shown to be an essential factor for users' positive experience and highly related to users' interactions in film, games, and virtual reality. However, immersion in SV interaction is still unexplored, which differs from the previously studied scenarios essentially because SV delivery is fragmented, discrete, and with limited time for each video. In this paper, we aim to make an extensive understanding of user immersion in online short video interaction, include related factors, detecting possibility, and satisfaction representation. We conduct a three-step user study on real SV browsing, including an online survey, a field study, and a lab study with EEG signals. The user study reveals that immersion is a common feeling in SV interaction, and it is related to video features, personalization of recommendations, user mood, and interaction behaviors. Specifically, prolonged browsing leads to a significant decrease in immersion. Furthermore, analyses of EEG signals demonstrate that the prefrontal lobe and parietal lobe of the gamma band are associated with immersion. Besides, immersion prediction experiments achieve encouraging results, showing that user immersion status is predictable and EEG signals do help improve prediction performance. Moreover, correlation analysis indicates that the predicted immersion is more representative of user satisfaction than user behaviors, revealing the potential of immersion as an indicator of satisfaction in the recommender system. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first study on user immersion in real online SV interaction scenarios, and our findings are enlightening for SV users and recommender system designers.|短视频 ~ (SV)在线流媒体是近年来最流行的互联网应用之一。浏览 SVs 时，用户逐渐沉浸其中，从中获得放松或知识。而长时间的浏览会导致积极情绪的下降，用户继续由于惯性，导致满意度下降。沉浸被证明是一个重要因素，用户的积极体验和高度相关的用户在电影，游戏和虚拟现实的互动。然而，沉浸在 SV 交互中仍然是未知的，这与以前研究的场景不同，本质上是因为 SV 交付是零碎的，离散的，并且每个视频的时间有限。本文旨在深入了解在线短视频交互中的用户沉浸现象，包括相关因素、检测可能性、满意度表征等。我们对真实的 SV 浏览进行了三个步骤的用户研究，包括在线调查、实地研究和脑电信号的实验室研究。用户研究表明，沉浸感是 SV 交互中的一种常见感觉，它与视频特性、推荐的个性化、用户情绪和交互行为有关。具体来说，长时间的浏览会导致沉浸感的显著降低。此外，脑电信号分析表明，伽玛波段的前额叶和顶叶与浸泡有关。此外，沉浸预测实验取得了令人鼓舞的结果，表明用户沉浸状态是可预测的，脑电信号有助于提高预测性能。此外，相关分析表明，预测沉浸比用户行为更能代表用户满意度，揭示了沉浸作为推荐系统满意度指标的潜力。据我们所知，这是第一个关于用户沉浸在真实在线 SV 交互场景中的研究，我们的研究结果对于 SV 用户和推荐系统设计者都是有启发的。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Understanding+User+Immersion+in+Online+Short+Video+Interaction)|0|

Different heavy-based detection tasks, such as heavy hitter, heavy changer, persistent item and significant item detection, have drawn much attention from both the industry and academia. Unfortunately, due to the growing data stream speeds and limited memory (L1 cache) available for real-time processing, existing schemes face challenges in simultaneously achieving high detection accuracy, high memory efficiency, and fast update throughput, as we reveal. To tackle this conundrum, we propose a versatile and elegant sketch framework named Tight-Sketch, which supports a spectrum of heavy-based detection tasks. Considering that most items are cold (non-heavy/persistent/significant) in practice, we employ different eviction treatments for different types of items to discard these potentially cold ones as soon as possible, and offer more protection to those that are hot (heavy/persistent/significant). In addition, we propose an eviction method that follows a stochastic decay strategy, enabling Tight-Sketch to only bear small one-sided errors (no overestimation).

|[printf: Preference Modeling Based on User Reviews with Item Images and Textual Information via Graph Learning](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615012)|HaoLun Lin, JyunYu Jiang, MingHao Juan, PuJen Cheng|Amazon Search, Palo Alto, CA, USA; National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan Roc|Nowadays, modern recommender systems usually leverage textual and visual contents as auxiliary information to predict user preference. For textual information, review texts are one of the most popular contents to model user behaviors. Nevertheless, reviews usually lose their shine when it comes to top-N recommender systems because those that solely utilize textual reviews as features struggle to adequately capture the interaction relationships between users and items. For visual one, it is usually modeled with naive convolutional networks and also hard to capture high-order relationships between users and items. Moreover, previous works did not collaboratively use both texts and images in a proper way. In this paper, we propose printf, preference modeling based on user reviews with item images and textual information via graph learning, to address the above challenges. Specifically, the dimension-based attention mechanism directs relations between user reviews and interacted items, allowing each dimension to contribute different importance weights to derive user representations. Extensive experiments are conducted on three publicly available datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed printf consistently outperforms baseline methods with the relative improvements for NDCG@5 of 26.80%, 48.65%, and 25.74% on Amazon-Grocery, Amazon-Tools, and Amazon-Electronics datasets, respectively. The in-depth analysis also indicates the dimensions of review representations definitely have different topics and aspects, assisting the validity of our model design.|现代推荐系统通常利用文本和可视化内容作为辅助信息来预测用户偏好。对于文本信息来说，评论文本是建立用户行为模型最常用的内容之一。尽管如此，当涉及到排名前 N 的推荐系统时，评论通常会失去它们的光芒，因为那些仅仅利用文本评论作为特性的系统很难充分捕捉到用户和项目之间的交互关系。对于可视化模型，它通常使用天真的卷积网络进行建模，并且很难捕捉用户和项目之间的高阶关系。此外，以前的作品没有合作使用文本和图像在适当的方式。针对上述挑战，本文提出了基于用户评论的 printf 偏好建模方法，该方法通过图形学习，利用项目图像和文本信息建立用户评论的 printf 偏好模型。具体来说，基于维度的注意机制指导用户评论和交互项目之间的关系，允许每个维度贡献不同的重要性权重来推导用户表示。在三个公开的数据集上进行了广泛的实验。实验结果表明，我们提出的 printf 始终优于基线方法，分别在 Amazon-Grocery，Amazon-Tools 和 Amazon-Electronics 数据集上对 NDCG@5的相对改进分别为26.80% ，48.65% 和25.74% 。深入的分析还表明，评论表征的维度肯定有不同的主题和方面，有助于我们的模型设计的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=printf:+Preference+Modeling+Based+on+User+Reviews+with+Item+Images+and+Textual+Information+via+Graph+Learning)|0|

These logs are mainstays that drive several user modeling tasks. The logs that inform user modeling are the ones that are attributed to each user, termed Attributed Behaviors (AB). But, a lot more logs are anonymous, upwards of 85%. For example, many users do not sign in while browsing. These logs are not attributed to users, termed Unattributed Behaviors (UB), and are not recognized in user modeling. We examine whether and how UB can benefit user modeling. We focus on a common task, that of user segmentation, for which the prior art uses only AB. We demonstrate that information from UBs, although unattributed to any individual, when used along with ABs, enriches performance of machine learning model for user segmentation.

Most previous methods assume that the training and test data are drawn from the same distribution, which may not hold in practice since the effect estimators may need to be deployed across domains. Meanwhile, in real-world applications, little or no targeted treatments may be conducted in the new domain. Therefore, we focus on a more realistic scenario in this paper, where treatments and outcomes can be observed in the source domain, but the target domain only contains some unlabeled data, i.e., only features are available. In this scenario, thedistribution shift exists not only in the source data due to the selection bias between the control and treated groups, but also between the source and target data. We propose a novel direct learning framework along with the distribution adaptation and reliable scoring modules. In the distribution adaptation module, we design three specialized density ratio estimators to aid the issue of complex distribution shifts. Even so, we may face the challenge of unreliable pseudo-effects in this framework. To address that, we also design the uncertainty-based reliable scoring module as a vital support, which makes the method more reliable. The experiments are conducted on synthetic data and benchmark datasets, which demonstrate the superiority of our method.|治疗效果评估是因果推理文献中必不可少的内容，近年来受到越来越多的关注。大多数以前的方法假定训练和测试数据来自同一个分布，这在实践中可能不成立，因为效应估计器可能需要跨领域部署。与此同时，在现实世界的应用，很少或没有针对性的治疗可能进行了新的领域。因此，我们在本文中关注一个更加现实的场景，在这个场景中，治疗和结果可以在源域中观察到，但是目标域只包含一些未标记的数据，也就是说，只有特征可用。在这种情况下，由于控制组和治疗组之间的选择偏差，不仅源数据中存在分布偏移，而且源数据和目标数据之间也存在分布偏移。我们提出了一个新的直接学习框架，以及分布适应和可靠的评分模块。在分布自适应模块中，我们设计了三个专门的密度比估计器，以解决复杂分布移位的问题。即便如此，我们也可能面临这一框架中不可靠的伪效应的挑战。为了解决这一问题，我们还设计了基于不确定性的可靠性评分模块作为重要的支持，使得该方法更加可靠。在综合数据和基准数据集上进行了实验，验证了该方法的优越性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Treatment+Effect+Estimation+across+Domains)|0|

As a representative that involves both kinds, the highly profitable Guaranteed Delivery (GD) advertising focuses mainly on promoting brand effect by allowing advertisers to order target impressions weeksin advance and get allocatedonline at the scheduled time. Such a business mode naturally incurs three issues making existing solutions inferior: 1) Timescale-granularity dilemma of coherently supporting the sales of day-level impressions of the distant future and the corresponding fine-grained allocation in real-time. 2) High dimensionality due to the Cartesian product of user attribute combinations. 3) Stability-plasticity dilemma of instant adaptation to emerging patterns of temporal dependency withoutcatastrophic forgetting of repeated ones facing the non-stationary traffic. To overcome the obstacles, we propose an online temporal hierarchical framework that functions analogously to a CLOCK and hence its name. Long-timescale, coarse-grained temporal data (e.g., the daily impression of one quarter) and short-timescale but fine-grained ones are handled separately by dedicated models, just like the hour/minute/second hands. Each tier in the hierarchy is triggered for forecasting and updating by need at different frequencies, thus saving the maintenance overhead. Furthermore, we devise a reconciliation mechanism to coordinate tiers by aggregating the separately learned local variance and global trends tier by tier. CLOCK solves the dimensionality dilemma by subsuming the autoencoder design to achieve an end-to-end, nonlinear factorization of streaming data into a low-dimension latent space, where a neural predictor produces predictions for the decoder to project them back to the high dimension. Lastly, we regulate the CLOCK's continual refinement by combining the complementary Experience Replay (ER) and Knowledge Distillation (KD) techniques to consolidate and recall previously learned temporal patterns. We conduct extensive evaluations on three public datasets and the real-life user impression log from the Tencent advertising system, and the results demonstrate CLOCK's efficacy.|用户印象预测是各种商业活动的基础，从长期战略决策到短期自动化操作。作为这两类广告的代表，利润丰厚的保证送达广告主要侧重于提升品牌效应，允许广告主提前订购目标印象周，并在预定时间在线分配。这种商业模式自然会产生三个问题，使得现有的解决方案相形见绌: 1)连贯支持销售遥远未来的日级印象和相应的实时细粒度分配的时间尺度-粒度困境。2)由于用户属性组合的笛卡儿积，导致维度较高。3)即时适应新兴时间依赖模式的稳定性-可塑性困境，不会灾难性遗忘面对非平稳流量的重复模式。为了克服这些障碍，我们提出了一个类似于时钟的在线时间层次结构框架。长时间尺度的粗粒度时间数据(例如，一个季度的每日印象)和短时间尺度但细粒度的数据由专用模型分别处理，就像小时/分钟/秒针一样。层次结构中的每一层都被触发，以便在不同的频率根据需要进行预测和更新，从而节省维护开销。此外，我们设计了一个协调机制，通过聚合分别学习的局部方差和全球趋势层层协调层。CLOCK 通过包含自动编码器设计来解决维度困境，实现流数据的端到端非线性因子分解到一个低维潜在空间，其中神经预测器为解码器产生预测，将它们投射回高维空间。最后，我们通过结合互补的体验重放(ER)和知识提取(KD)技术来调节时钟的持续细化，以巩固和回忆先前学习的时间模式。我们对来自腾讯广告系统的三个公共数据集和现实生活中的用户印象日志进行了广泛的评估，结果证明了时钟的功效。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=CLOCK:+Online+Temporal+Hierarchical+Framework+for+Multi-scale+Multi-granularity+Forecasting+of+User+Impression)|0|
|[Optimizing Upstream Representations for Out-of-Domain Detection with Supervised Contrastive Learning](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615001)|Bo Wang, Tsunenori Mine|Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan|Out-of-Domain (OOD) text detection has attracted significant research interest. However, conventional approaches primarily employ Cross-Entropy loss during upstream encoder training and seldom focus on optimizing discriminative In-Domain (IND) and OOD representations. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel method that applies supervised contrastive learning (SCL) to IND data for upstream representation optimization. This effectively brings the embeddings of semantically similar texts together while pushing dissimilar ones further apart, leading to more compact and distinct IND representations. This optimization subsequently improves the differentiation between IND and OOD representations, thereby enhancing the detection effect in downstream tasks. To further strengthen the ability of SCL to consolidate IND embedding clusters, and to improve the generalizability of the encoder, we propose a method that generates two different variations of the same text as "views". This is achieved by applying a twice "dropped-out" on the embeddings before performing SCL. Extensive experiments indicate that our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, but also reduces the requirement for training a large 354M-parameter model down to a more efficient 110M-parameter model, highlighting its superiority in both effectiveness and computational economy.|域外(OOD)文本检测已经引起了人们的极大兴趣。然而，传统的方法主要使用交叉熵损失在上游编码器训练，很少重点优化区分在域(IND)和面向对象的表示。为了填补这一空白，我们提出了一种新的方法，将监督对比学习(SCL)应用于 IND 数据的上游表示优化。这有效地将语义相似的文本嵌入在一起，同时将不同的文本进一步分离，从而产生更紧凑、更独特的 IND 表示。这种优化随后改进了 IND 和 OOD 表示之间的区别，从而增强了下游任务的检测效果。为了进一步增强 SCL 对 IND 嵌入簇的整合能力，提高编码器的通用性，提出了一种生成同一文本中“视图”的两种不同变体的方法。这是通过在执行 SCL 之前对嵌入应用两次“退出”来实现的。大量实验表明，该方法不仅优于最新的方法，而且降低了对大型354M 参数模型的训练要求，使其降低到更高效的110M 参数模型，突出了其在有效性和计算经济性方面的优越性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Optimizing+Upstream+Representations+for+Out-of-Domain+Detection+with+Supervised+Contrastive+Learning)|0|

Therefore, user-centric group discovery task, i.e., recommending groups to users can help both users' online experiences and platforms' long-term developments. Existing recommender methods can not deal with this task as modeling user-group participation into a bipartite graph overlooks their item-side interests. Although there exist a few works attempting to address this task, they still fall short in fully preserving the social context and ensuring effective interest representation learning. In this paper, we focus on exploring the intents that motivate users to participate in groups, which can be categorized into different types, like the social-intent and the personal interest-intent. The former refers to users joining a group affected by their social links, while the latter relates to users joining groups with like-minded people for self-enjoyment. To comprehend different intents, we propose a novel model, DiRec, that first models each intent separately and then fuses them together for predictions. Specifically, for social-intent, we introduce the hypergraph structure to model the relationship between groups and members, leading to a richer understanding of the social context. As for interest-intent, we employ novel structural refinement on the interactive graph to uncover more intricate user behaviors and group interests, realizing better representation learning of interests. Furthermore, we also observe the intent overlapping in real-world scenarios and devise a novel self-supervised learning loss that encourages such alignment for final recommendations. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show the significant improvement of DiRec over the state-of-the-art methods.|在线小组已经变得越来越普遍，为用户提供了分享经验和探索兴趣的空间。因此，以用户为中心的群组发现任务，即向用户推荐群组，可以帮助用户的在线体验和平台的长期发展。现有的推荐方法无法处理这个任务，因为将用户组参与建模成二分图忽略了它们的项目侧兴趣。虽然有一些工作试图解决这一任务，但他们仍然不能充分保存的社会背景和确保有效的兴趣表征学习。本文着重探讨了激发用户参与群体的意图，这些意图可以分为社会意图和个人兴趣意图。前者是指使用者加入一个受其社交联系影响的群组，而后者是指使用者加入与志同道合者的群组以自娱自乐。为了理解不同的意图，我们提出了一个新的模型，DiRec，它首先分别模拟每个意图，然后将它们融合在一起进行预测。具体地说，对于社会意图，我们引入超图结构来建模群体和成员之间的关系，从而更加丰富地理解社会背景。对于兴趣意图，我们在交互图上采用了新颖的结构细化方法，以揭示更复杂的用户行为和群体兴趣，实现更好的兴趣表示学习。此外，我们还观察到在现实世界的情况下意图重叠，并设计了一种新的自我监督学习丢失，鼓励这种调整为最终的建议。在三个公共数据集上的大量实验表明，DiRec 相对于最先进的方法有显著的改进。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Dual+Intents+Graph+Modeling+for+User-centric+Group+Discovery)|0|

Although transformer-based models have made progress in this field, they usually do not make full use of three features of multivariate time series: global information, local information, and variables correlation. To effectively mine the above three features and establish a high-precision prediction model, we propose a double sampling transformer (DSformer), which consists of the double sampling (DS) block and the temporal variable attention (TVA) block. Firstly, the DS block employs down sampling and piecewise sampling to transform the original series into feature vectors that focus on global information and local information respectively. Then, TVA block uses temporal attention and variable attention to mine these feature vectors from different dimensions and extract key information. Finally, based on a parallel structure, DSformer uses multiple TVA blocks to mine and integrate different features obtained from DS blocks respectively. The integrated feature information is passed to the generative decoder based on a multi-layer perceptron to realize multivariate time series long-term prediction. Experimental results on nine real-world datasets show that DSformer can outperform eight existing baselines.|多变量时间序列长期预测旨在预测数据在较长时间内的变化，可以为决策提供参考。虽然基于变压器的模型在这方面取得了一定的进展，但是它们往往没有充分利用多变量时间序列的三个特征: 全局信息、局部信息和变量相关性。为了有效地挖掘上述三个特征，建立高精度的预测模型，提出了一种双采样变压器(DSformer) ，它由双采样(DS)块和时变注意(TVA)块组成。首先，DS 块采用下采样和分段采样的方法，将原始序列分别转换成全局信息和局部信息的特征向量。然后，TVA 块利用时间注意和变量注意从不同维度挖掘特征向量，提取关键信息。最后，在并行结构的基础上，采用多个 TVA 块分别挖掘和集成 DS 块获得的不同特征。将集成的特征信息传递给基于多层感知器的生成解码器，实现多变量时间序列的长期预测。在九个实际数据集上的实验结果表明，DSformer 的性能优于现有的八个基线。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=DSformer:+A+Double+Sampling+Transformer+for+Multivariate+Time+Series+Long-term+Prediction)|0|

However, existing work on robust uncertainty estimation mainly focuses on evasion attacks that happen during test time. The threat of poisoning attacks against uncertainty models is largely unexplored. Compared to evasion attacks, poisoning attacks do not necessarily modify test data, and therefore, would be more practical in real-world applications. In this work, we systematically investigate the robustness of state-of-the-art uncertainty estimation algorithms against data poisoning attacks, with the ultimate objective of developing robust uncertainty training methods. In particular, we focus on attacking the out-domain uncertainty estimation. Under the proposed attack, the training process of models is affected. A fake high-confidence region is established around the targeted out-domain sample, which originally would have been rejected by the model due to low confidence. More fatally, our attack is clean-label and targeted: it leaves the poisoned data with clean labels and attacks a specific targeted test sample without degrading the overall model performance. We evaluate the proposed attack on several image benchmark datasets and a real-world application of COVID-19 misinformation detection.

|[Unlocking the Potential of User Feedback: Leveraging Large Language Model as User Simulators to Enhance Dialogue System](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615220)|Zhiyuan Hu, Yue Feng, Anh Tuan Luu, Bryan Hooi, Aldo Lipani|National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; Nanyang Technological University,, Singapore, Singapore; University College London, London, United Kingdom|Dialogue systems and large language models (LLMs) have gained considerable attention. However, the direct utilization of LLMs as task-oriented dialogue (TOD) models has been found to underperform compared to smaller task-specific models. Nonetheless, it is crucial to acknowledge the significant potential of LLMs and explore improved approaches for leveraging their impressive abilities. Motivated by the goal of leveraging LLMs, we propose an alternative approach called User-Guided Response Optimization (UGRO) to combine it with a smaller TOD model. This approach uses LLM as annotation-free user simulator to assess dialogue responses, combining them with smaller fine-tuned end-to-end TOD models. By utilizing the satisfaction feedback generated by LLMs, UGRO further optimizes the supervised fine-tuned TOD model. Specifically, the TOD model takes the dialogue history as input and, with the assistance of the user simulator's feedback, generates high-satisfaction responses that meet the user's requirements. Through empirical experiments on two TOD benchmarks, we validate the effectiveness of our method. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) results.|对话系统和大语言模型(LLM)已经引起了人们的广泛关注。然而，直接利用 LLM 作为任务导向对话(TOD)模型被发现表现不如较小的任务特定模型。尽管如此，承认 LLM 的巨大潜力并探索利用其令人印象深刻的能力的改进方法是至关重要的。受到利用 LLM 目标的激励，我们提出了一种称为用户引导响应优化(UGRO)的替代方法，将其与较小的 TOD 模型相结合。这种方法使用 LLM 作为无注释的用户模拟器来评估对话响应，并将它们与较小的经过微调的端到端 TOD 模型相结合。通过利用 LLM 产生的满意度反馈，UGRO 进一步优化了监督微调 TOD 模型。具体来说，TOD 模型以对话历史为输入，在用户模拟器反馈的帮助下，产生满足用户需求的高满意度响应。通过对两个 TOD 基准的实验，验证了该方法的有效性。结果表明，我们的方法优于以前的最先进的(SOTA)结果。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Unlocking+the+Potential+of+User+Feedback:+Leveraging+Large+Language+Model+as+User+Simulators+to+Enhance+Dialogue+System)|0|

Prasanna|University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA; DEVCOM Army Research Lab, Los Angeles, CA, USA|Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained significant attention across diverse areas due to their superior performance in learning graph representations. While GNNs exhibit superior performance compared to other methods, they are primarily designed for homogeneous graphs, where all nodes and edges are of the same type. Training a GNN model for large-scale graphs incurs high computation and storage costs, especially when considering the heterogeneous structural information of each node. To address the demand for efficient GNN training, various sampling methods have been proposed. In this paper, we propose a sampling method based on bandit sampling, an online learning algorithm with provable convergence under weak assumptions on the learning objective. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first bandit-based sampling method applied to heterogeneous GNNs with a theoretical guarantee. The main idea is to prioritize node types with more informative connections with respect to the learning objective. Compared with existing techniques for GNN training on heterogeneous graphs, extensive experiments using the Open Academic Graph (OAG) dataset demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of the runtime across various tasks with a speed-up of 1.5-2x, while achieving similar accuracy.|图神经网络(GNN)由于其在学习图表示方面的优越性能，在各个领域得到了广泛的关注。虽然 GNN 表现出比其他方法更好的性能，但它们主要是为同质图设计的，其中所有节点和边都是相同类型的。针对大规模图的 GNN 模型的训练需要很高的计算和存储成本，尤其是在考虑每个节点的异构结构信息时。为了满足有效的 GNN 训练需求，提出了多种抽样方法。本文提出了一种基于强盗抽样的抽样方法，这是一种在学习目标弱假设下具有可证明收敛性的在线学习算法。据我们所知，这是第一个基于强盗的抽样方法应用于异构 GNN 的理论保证。其主要思想是优先考虑与学习目标有更多信息联系的节点类型。与现有的在异构图上进行 GNN 训练的技术相比，使用开放学术图(OAG)数据集的大量实验表明，我们提出的方法在不同任务的运行时间方面优于最先进的技术，速度提高了1.5 -2倍，同时达到了类似的精度。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Training+Heterogeneous+Graph+Neural+Networks+using+Bandit+Sampling)|0|
|[Robust User Behavioral Sequence Representation via Multi-scale Stochastic Distribution Prediction](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614714)|Chilin Fu, Weichang Wu, Xiaolu Zhang, Jun Hu, Jing Wang, Jun Zhou|Ant Group, Hangzhou, China; AntGroup, Hangzhou, China|User behavior representation learned by self-supervised pre-training tasks is widely used in various domains and applications. Conventional methods usually follow the methodology in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to set the pre-training tasks. They either randomly mask some of the behaviors in the sequence and predict the masked ones or predict the next k behaviors. These methods fit for text sequence, in which the tokens are sequentially arranged subject to linguistic criterion. However, the user behavior sequences can be stochastic with noise and randomness. The same paradigm is intractable for learning a robust user behavioral representation. Though the next user behavior can be stochastic, the behavior distribution over a period of time is much more stable and less noisy. Based on this, we propose a Multi-scale Stochastic Distribution Prediction (MSDP) algorithm for learning robust user behavioral sequence representation. Instead of using predictions on concrete behavior as pre-training tasks, we take the prediction on user's behaviors distribution over a period of time as the self-supervision signal. Moreover, inspired by the recent success of the multi-task prompt training method on Large Language Models (LLM), we propose using the window size of the predicted time period as a prompt, enabling the model to learn user behavior representations that can be applied to prediction tasks across various future time periods. We generate different window size prompts through stochastic sampling. It effectively improves the generalization capability of the learned sequence representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can learn robust user behavior representation successfully, which significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.|自监督预训练任务学习的用户行为表示在各个领域和应用中得到了广泛的应用。传统的方法通常遵循自然语言处理(NLP)的方法来设置预训练任务。他们要么随机掩盖序列中的一些行为并预测掩盖的行为，要么预测下一个 k 行为。这些方法适用于符号按照语言规范顺序排列的文本序列。然而，用户行为序列具有随机性和噪声性。同样的范例对于学习一个健壮的用户行为表示是难以实现的。虽然下一个用户行为可能是随机的，但是在一段时间内的行为分布更加稳定，噪声更小。在此基础上，提出了一种学习鲁棒用户行为序列表示的多尺度随机分布预测(MSDP)算法。我们不再把对具体行为的预测作为训练前的任务，而是把对用户一段时间内行为分布的预测作为自我监督的信号。此外，受到最近大型语言模型(LLM)多任务提示训练方法的成功启发，我们建议使用预测时间段的窗口大小作为提示，使模型能够学习用户行为表示，可以应用于未来不同时间段的预测任务。我们通过随机抽样产生不同的窗口大小提示。有效地提高了学习序列表示的泛化能力。大量的实验表明，我们的方法可以学习鲁棒的用户行为表示成功，这显着优于国家的最先进的(SOTA)基线。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Robust+User+Behavioral+Sequence+Representation+via+Multi-scale+Stochastic+Distribution+Prediction)|0|
|[Addressing Selection Bias in Computerized Adaptive Testing: A User-Wise Aggregate Influence Function Approach](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615455)|Soonwoo Kwon, Sojung Kim, Seunghyun Lee, JinYoung Kim, Suyeong An, Kyuseok Kim|Riiid AI Research, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Riiid AI Research, Seoul, South Korea|Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) is a widely used, efficient test mode that adapts to the examinee's proficiency level in the test domain. CAT requires pre-trained item profiles, for CAT iteratively assesses the student real-time based on the registered items' profiles, and selects the next item to administer using candidate items' profiles. However, obtaining such item profiles is a costly process that involves gathering a large, dense item-response data, then training a diagnostic model on the collected data. In this paper, we explore the possibility of leveraging response data collected in the CAT service. We first show that this poses a unique challenge due to the inherent selection bias introduced by CAT, i.e., more proficient students will receive harder questions. Indeed, when naively training the diagnostic model using CAT response data, we observe that item profiles deviate significantly from the ground-truth. To tackle the selection bias issue, we propose the user-wise aggregate influence function method. Our intuition is to filter out users whose response data is heavily biased in an aggregate manner, as judged by how much perturbation the added data will introduce during parameter estimation. This way, we may enhance the performance of CAT while introducing minimal bias to the item profiles. We provide extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method based on the three public datasets and one dataset that contains real-world CAT response data.||[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Addressing+Selection+Bias+in+Computerized+Adaptive+Testing:+A+User-Wise+Aggregate+Influence+Function+Approach)|0|
|[The Price is Right: Removing A/B Test Bias in a Marketplace of Expirable Goods](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615502)|Thu Le, Alex Deng|Airbnb, Seattle, WA, USA; Airbnb, San Francisco, CA, USA|Pricing Guidance tools at Airbnb aim to help hosts maximize the earning for each night of stay. For a given listing, the earning-maximization price point of a night can vary greatly with lead-day - the number of days from now until the night of stay. This introduces systematic bias in running marketplace A/B tests to compare the performances of two pricing strategies. Lead-day bias can cause the short-term experiment result to move in the opposite direction to the long-term impact, possibly leading to the suboptimal business decision and customer dissatisfaction. We propose an efficient experimentation approach that corrects for the bias, minimizes the possible negative impact of experimenting, and greatly accelerates the R&D cycle. This paper is the first of its kind to lays out the theoretical framework along with the real-world example that demonstrates the magnitude of the bias. It serves as a conversation starter for such insidious type of experimentation bias that is likely present in other marketplaces of expirable goods such as vacation nights, car rentals, and airline tickets, concert passes, or ride-hailings.||[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=The+Price+is+Right:+Removing+A/B+Test+Bias+in+a+Marketplace+of+Expirable+Goods)|0|

In traditional sponsored search, bids are submitted at the keyword level, while recent works have explored transitioning to impression-level bidding using Real-Time Bidding (RTB) techniques to achieve finer bidding. However, position auctions introduce varying user appeal across different positions and more dynamic auction landscape, which RTB, originally devised for single-slot display advertising, fails to address adequately. In this work, we are the first to study the optimal bidding strategy for position auctions in RTB. The position auctions we study belong to a broader class, including both sponsored search and display advertising with multiple ad slots. In particular, we aim at maximizing the advertising value within the budget constraint for an advertiser. We mathematically formulate the problem with explicit modeling of position effects. By leveraging the Lagrange multiplier, we derive the optimal bid price and prove its uniqueness under mild assumptions. Efficient numeric methods are applied to obtain the solution practically. Extensive experiments are conducted on a public semi-synthetic dataset and a private industry dataset to validate the effectiveness and feasibility in practice.||[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Optimal+Real-Time+Bidding+Strategy+for+Position+Auctions+in+Online+Advertising)|0|

Existing works in causal inference for observational network data lack an analysis of the generalization bound, which can theoretically provide support for alleviating the complex confounding bias and practically guide the design of learning objectives in a principled manner. To fill this gap, we derive a generalization bound for causal effect estimation in network scenarios by exploiting 1) the reweighting schema based on joint propensity score and 2) the representation learning schema based on Integral Probability Metric (IPM). We provide two perspectives on the generalization bound in terms of reweighting and representation learning, respectively. Motivated by the analysis of the bound, we propose a weighting regression method based on the joint propensity score augmented with representation learning. Extensive experimental studies on two real-world networks with semi-synthetic data demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.||[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Generalization+Bound+for+Estimating+Causal+Effects+from+Observational+Network+Data)|0|

Their decentralized nature, however, leads to notable volatility against traditional fiat currencies, making the task of accurately forecasting the crypto-fiat exchange rate complex. In this study, we examine the various independent factors that affect the Bitcoin-Dollar exchange rate's volatility. To this end, we propose CoMForE, a multimodal AdaBoost-LSTM ensemble model, which not only utilizes historical trading data but also incorporates public sentiments from related tweets, public interest demonstrated by search volumes, and blockchain hash-rate data. Our developed model goes a step further by predicting fluctuations in the overall cryptocurrency value distribution, thus increasing its value for investment decision-making. We have subjected this method to extensive testing via comprehensive experiments, thereby validating the importance of multimodal combination over exclusive reliance on trading data. Further experiments show that our method significantly surpasses existing forecasting tools and methodologies, demonstrating a 19.29% improvement.

However, anticipating the type of bias in advance is extremely challenging, and designing models solely for one specific type may not necessarily improve overall generalization performance. Moreover, limited research has focused on the impact of mixed biases, which are more prevalent and demanding in real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Causality and Independence Enhancement (CIE) framework, applicable to various graph neural networks (GNNs). Our approach estimates causal and spurious features at the node representation level and mitigates the influence of spurious correlations through the backdoor adjustment. Meanwhile, independence constraint is introduced to improve the discriminability and stability of causal and spurious features in complex biased environments. Essentially, CIE eliminates different types of data biases from a unified perspective, without the need to design separate methods for each bias as before. To evaluate the performance under specific types of data biases, mixed biases, and low-resource scenarios, we conducted comprehensive experiments on five publicly available datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach CIE not only significantly enhances the performance of GNNs but outperforms state-of-the-art debiased node classification methods.||[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Causality+and+Independence+Enhancement+for+Biased+Node+Classification)|0|

That is, after alignment, each source sample is expected to become similar to any target sample. However, global alignment may not always be optimal or necessary in practice. For example, consider cross-domain fraud detection, where there are two types of transactions: credit and non-credit. Aligning credit and non-credit transactions separately may yield better performance than global alignment, as credit transactions are unlikely to exhibit patterns similar to non-credit transactions.

However, adverse effects, such as polarization and echo chambers, greatly impact the benefits of social media and call for algorithms that mitigate these effects. In this paper, we propose a novel problem formulation aimed at slightly nudging users' social feeds in order to strike a balance between relevance and diversity, thus mitigating the emergence of polarization, without lowering the quality of the feed. Our approach is based on re-weighting the relative importance of the accounts that a user follows, so as to calibrate the frequency with which the content produced by various accounts is shown to the user. We analyze the convexity properties of the problem, demonstrating the non-matrix convexity of the objective function and the convexity of the feasible set. To efficiently address the problem, we develop a scalable algorithm based on projected gradient descent. We also prove that our problem statement is a proper generalization of the undirected-case problem so that our method can also be adopted for undirected social networks. As a baseline for comparison in the undirected case, we develop a semidefinite programming approach, which provides the optimal solution. Through extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we validate the effectiveness of our approach, which outperforms non-trivial baselines, underscoring its ability to foster healthier and more cohesive online communities.||[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Rebalancing+Social+Feed+to+Minimize+Polarization+and+Disagreement)|0|

However, the information the user is after is often not formulated by these ChatBots objectively enough to be provided with a definite, globally accepted answer. Controversial topics, such as "religion", "gender identity", "freedom of speech", and "equality", among others, can be a source of conflict as partisan or biased answers can reinforce preconceived notions or promote disinformation. By exposing ChatGPT to such debatable questions, we aim to understand its level of awareness and if existing models are subject to socio-political and/or economic biases. We also aim to explore how AI-generated answers compare to human ones. For exploring this, we use a dataset of a social media platform created for the purpose of debating human-generated claims on polemic subjects among users, dubbed Kialo. Our results show that while previous versions of ChatGPT have had important issues with controversial topics, more recent versions of ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo) are no longer manifesting significant explicit biases in several knowledge areas. In particular, it is well-moderated regarding economic aspects. However, it still maintains degrees of implicit libertarian leaning toward right-winged ideals which suggest the need for increased moderation from the socio-political point of view. In terms of domain knowledge on controversial topics, with the exception of the "Philosophical" category, ChatGPT is performing well in keeping up with the collective human level of knowledge.

These factors are generally unknown, making dehazing problems ill-posed and creating inherent uncertainties. To account for such uncertainties and factors involved in haze degradation, we introduce a variational Bayesian framework for single image dehazing. We propose to take not only a clean image and but also transmission map as latent variables, the posterior distributions of which are parameterized by corresponding neural networks: dehazing and transmission networks, respectively. Based on a physical model for haze degradation, our variational Bayesian framework leads to a new objective function that encourages the cooperation between them, facilitating the joint training of and thereby boosting the performance of each other. In our framework, a dehazing network can estimate a clean image independently of a transmission map estimation during inference, introducing no overhead. Furthermore, our model-agnostic framework can be seamlessly incorporated with other existing dehazing networks, greatly enhancing the performance consistently across datasets and models.|依赖于神经网络的表现能力，大多数最近的工作往往忽略了几个因素涉及到阴霾退化，如透射(从远处的场景到达观察者的光量)和大气光。这些因素通常是未知的，使得令人厌烦的问题不适定，并造成固有的不确定性。为了解决这些不确定性和影响霾退化的因素，我们引入了一个变分贝叶斯框架来处理单幅图像的除霾问题。我们提出不仅以清晰图像作为潜变量，而且以传输图作为潜变量，其后验分布分别由相应的神经网络参数化: 去雾网络和传输网络。基于雾霾退化的物理模型，我们的变化贝叶斯框架导致一个新的目标函数，鼓励他们之间的合作，促进联合训练，从而提高彼此的表现。在我们的框架中，去雾网络可以在推理过程中独立于传输图估计来估计干净的图像，不会引入开销。此外，我们的模型无关框架可以与其他现有的去雾网络无缝结合，极大地提高了跨数据集和模型的一致性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Deep+Variational+Bayesian+Modeling+of+Haze+Degradation+Process)|0|

Koa, Yunshan Ma, Ritchie Ng, TatSeng Chua|National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; Eastspring Investments, Singapore, Singapore|Multi-step stock price prediction over a long-term horizon is crucial for forecasting its volatility, allowing financial institutions to price and hedge derivatives, and banks to quantify the risk in their trading books. Additionally, most financial regulators also require a liquidity horizon of several days for institutional investors to exit their risky assets, in order to not materially affect market prices. However, the task of multi-step stock price prediction is challenging, given the highly stochastic nature of stock data. Current solutions to tackle this problem are mostly designed for single-step, classification-based predictions, and are limited to low representation expressiveness. The problem also gets progressively harder with the introduction of the target price sequence, which also contains stochastic noise and reduces generalizability at test-time. To tackle these issues, we combine a deep hierarchical variational-autoencoder (VAE) and diffusion probabilistic techniques to do seq2seq stock prediction through a stochastic generative process. The hierarchical VAE allows us to learn the complex and low-level latent variables for stock prediction, while the diffusion probabilistic model trains the predictor to handle stock price stochasticity by progressively adding random noise to the stock data. Our Diffusion-VAE (D-Va) model is shown to outperform state-of-the-art solutions in terms of its prediction accuracy and variance. More importantly, the multi-step outputs can also allow us to form a stock portfolio over the prediction length. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model outputs in the portfolio investment task through the Sharpe ratio metric and highlight the importance of dealing with different types of prediction uncertainties.|长期多步股价预测对于预测其波动性至关重要，它使金融机构能够对衍生品进行定价和对冲，使银行能够量化其交易账户中的风险。此外，大多数金融监管机构还要求机构投资者在几天内退出风险资产，以免对市场价格产生重大影响。然而，由于股票数据的高度随机性，多步股价预测的任务是具有挑战性的。目前解决这个问题的解决方案大多是为单步、基于分类的预测而设计的，并且仅限于低表示表达性。随着目标价格序列的引入，这个问题也变得越来越难，因为目标价格序列还包含随机噪声，降低了测试时的通用性。为了解决这些问题，我们将深层变分自动编码器(VAE)和扩散概率技术结合起来，通过一个随机生成过程进行 seq2seq 股票预测。分层 VAE 使我们能够学习复杂和低层潜变量的股票预测，而扩散概率模型训练预测器处理股票价格的随机性，逐步增加随机噪声的股票数据。我们的扩散 VAE (D-Va)模型在预测精度和方差方面表现优于最先进的解。更重要的是，多步输出还可以让我们形成一个股票投资组合的预测长度。我们证明了我们的模型输出在证券投资任务中的有效性，通过 Sharpe 比率度量，并强调了处理不同类型的预测不确定性的重要性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Diffusion+Variational+Autoencoder+for+Tackling+Stochasticity+in+Multi-Step+Regression+Stock+Price+Prediction)|0|

As they become more popular, they are increasingly deployed in complex machine learning pipelines, where their actions can be overwritten. For example, in ranking problems, a list of recommended items can be modified by a downstream algorithm to increase diversity. This may break the classic bandit algorithms and lead to linear regret. Specifically, if the proposed action is not taken, uncertainty in its estimated mean reward may not get reduced. In this work, we study this setting and call it non-compliant bandits; as the agent tries to learn rewarding actions that comply with a downstream task. We propose two algorithms, compliant contextual UCB (CompUCB) and Thompson sampling (CompTS), which learn separate reward and compliance models.

Many recent studies target traffic prediction using deep learning techniques. They model spatio-temporal dependencies among traffic states by deep learning and achieve good overall performance. However, existing studies ignore the bias on traffic prediction models, which refers to non-uniformed performance distribution across road segments, especially the significantly poor prediction results on certain road segments. To solve this issue, we propose a framework named spatio-temporal mixture-of-experts (ST-MoE) that aims to eliminate the bias on traffic prediction. In general, we refer to any traffic prediction model as the based model, and adopt the proposed ST-MoE framework as a plug-in to debias. ST-MoE uses stacked convolution-based networks to learn spatio-temporal representations of individual patterns of road segments and then adaptively assigns appropriate expert layers (sub-networks) to different patterns through a spatio-temporal gating network. To this end, the patterns can be distinguished, and biased performance among road segments can be eliminated by experts tailored for specific patterns, which also further improves the overall prediction accuracy of the base model. Extensive experimental results on various base models and real-world datasets prove the effectiveness of ST-MoE.|具有全球定位系统功能的设备和无线通信技术的普及导致智能交通系统中交通数据的激增，在这些系统中，交通预测往往对可靠性和安全性至关重要。最近的许多研究目标交通预测使用深度学习技术。它们通过深度学习模拟交通状态之间的时空依赖关系，取得了良好的综合性能。然而，现有的研究忽略了交通预测模型的偏差，即路段间的性能分布不均匀，特别是某些路段的预测效果明显较差。为了解决这一问题，我们提出了一种时空混合专家模型(ST-MoE) ，旨在消除交通预测中的偏差。一般来说，我们把任何一种交通预测模型作为基础模型，并采用所提出的 ST-MoE 框架作为插件进行偏置。ST-MoE 使用基于叠加卷积的网络来学习路段单个模式的时空表示，然后通过时空门控网络自适应地为不同的模式分配适当的专家层(子网)。为此，专家针对特定的模式，可以区分模式，消除路段之间的偏差性能，从而进一步提高基本模型的整体预测精度。在各种基本模型和实际数据集上的大量实验结果证明了 ST-MoE 方法的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=ST-MoE:+Spatio-Temporal+Mixture-of-Experts+for+Debiasing+in+Traffic+Prediction)|0|

Examples include e-commerce platforms like Taobao (retailers and consumers) and ride-hailing platforms like Uber (drivers and passengers). Participants of different types in the two-sided market have relationships (i.e., supply and demand) that provide externalities and network benefits. On two-sided platforms, marketing campaigns are designed by subsidizing supply or demand. Uplift models built in this scenario usually consider the treatment assignment for only one of the two sides. However, ignoring the interaction of treatments between two sides or treating them as noises may result in incomplete models and inaccurate predictions. As far as we know, there is not much work related to modeling the combinational treatment effects in the two-sided market. In this paper, we first introduce the two-sided treatment effects estimation problem and then propose a Unified Treatment effect Estimation (UniTE) method for one-sided and two-sided marketing. We extend the Robinson Decomposition to two-sided, in which the relationship of the three involved tasks, namely the outcome, the propensity, and the treatment effect, is theoretically derived. Based on the decomposition result, a multi-task-based neural network model is proposed to integrate the three tasks and learn the inter-task-related common information, which prompts the model to estimate the treatment effects better.

Metrics are required to be observable immediately after being generated to support real-time analysis. However, the commonly used Log-Structured Merge-Tree structure suffers from periodically visible delay spikes when a new segment is created due to the instantaneous index construction pressure. In this paper, we present Khronos, an asynchronous indexing framework tailored for high-cardinal monitoring data, aiming at reducing the visible delay. Firstly, we analyze the temporal locality nature of time series and propose a complementary index construction algorithm by only indexing series not reported before to relieve indexing workload. Secondly, we design index structures based on Minimum Excluded value function to effectively reuse indexes of previous segments. Thirdly, we take advantage of the non-repetitive feature of complementary indexes and further develop an intermediate query results reusing approach for deduplicating index traversal among segments. Moreover, we propose an index dependency management strategy that cuts off the previous reusing dependency before persistence to avoid extended dependency overhead. Experimental results show that our framework significantly reduces the visible delay from minutes to milliseconds. Khronos outperforms the state-of-the-art databases InfluxDB and TimeScaleDB with at least 4 times higher write throughput, hundreds of times lower visible delay, and 6 times lower query latency.

However, existing research on manifold learning primarily focuses on understanding the intricate data, overlooking the explosive growth of the scale and complexity of deep neural networks (DNNs), which presents a significant challenge for model optimization. In this work, we propose to explore the intrinsic low-dimensional manifold of network parameters for efficient model optimization. Specifically, we analyze parameter distributions in a deep model and perform sampling to map them onto a low-dimensional parameter manifold using the local tangent space alignment (LTSA). Since our focus is on studying parameter manifolds to guide model optimization, we therefore select dynamic optimal training trajectories for sampling and approximate tangent spaces to obtain low-dimensional representations of DNNs. By applying manifold learning techniques and employing a two-step alternate optimization method, we achieve a fixed subspace that reduces training time and resource costs for commonly used deep networks. The trained low-dimensional network can be mapped back to the original parameter space for further use. We demonstrate the benefits of learning low-dimensional parameterization of DNNs on both noisy label learning and federated learning tasks.

Existing domain adaptation methods generally transfer the knowledge from source domain to target domain through measuring the consistency between the different domains. Under this strategy, if the data of source domain is not sufficient to guarantee the consistency, the transferable knowledge will be very limited. On the other hand, we often have priors about target domain which facilitate knowledge transfer but are neglected in the extant domain adaptation methods. To tackle the problems, we integrate the priors of target domain into transfer process and propose a domain adaptation method based on evidence evidence theory. We represent the priors with evidential belief function and reformulate the domain adaptation objective based on likelihood principle, in which the priors are used to adjust transferred knowledge to suit for target domain. Based on this, we propose an improved coordinate ascent algorithm to optimize likelihood objective of domain adaption.

These systems require a substantial amount of labeled data to train their models. However, the labeled data is scarce and challenging to be constructed. The construction process typically involves two stages: discovering potential sample candidates and manually labeling these candidates. To discover high-quality candidate samples, we study the intention paraphrase template discovery task: Given some seed questions or templates of an intention, discover new paraphrase templates that describe the intention and are diverse to the seeds enough in text. As the first exploration of the task, we identify the new quality requirements, i.e., relevance, divergence and popularity, and identify the new challenges, i.e., the paradox of divergent yet relevant paraphrases, and the conflict of popular yet relevant paraphrases. To untangle the paradox of divergent yet relevant paraphrases, in which the traditional bag of words falls short, we develop usage-centric modeling, which represents a question/template/answer as a bag of usages that users engaged (e.g., up-votes), and uses a usage-flow graph to interrelate templates, questions and answers. To balance the conflict of popular yet relevant paraphrases, we propose a new and principled decomposition for the well-known Pointwise Mutual Information from the usage perspective (usage-PMI), and then develop a Bayesian inference framework over the usage-flow graph to estimate the usage-PMI. Extensive experiments over three large CQA corpora show strong performance advantage over the baselines adopted from paraphrase identification task.

Some ML tasks are hard to distribute because common approaches to parameter management can be highly inefficient. Advanced parameter management approaches -- such as selective replication or dynamic parameter allocation -- can improve efficiency, but to do so, they typically need to be integrated manually into each task's implementation and they require expensive upfront experimentation to tune correctly. In this work, we explore whether these two problems can be avoided. We first propose a novel intent signaling mechanism that integrates naturally into existing ML stacks and provides the parameter manager with crucial information about parameter accesses. We then describe AdaPM, a fully adaptive, zero-tuning parameter manager based on this mechanism. In contrast to prior systems, this approach separates providing information (simple, done by the task) from exploiting it effectively (hard, done automatically by AdaPM).

The task of user identity linkage (UIL), which aims to identify corresponding users across different social networks, poses a threat to privacy if applied unethically. Sensitive user information would be inferred with cross-network identity linkages. A feasible solution to this issue is to design an adversarial strategy that degrades the matching performance of UIL models. Nevertheless, most of the current adversarial attacks on graphs are tailored towards models working within a single network, failing to account for the challenges presented by cross-network learning tasks such as UIL. Also, in real-world scenarios, the adversarial strategy against UIL has more constraints as service providers can only add perturbations to their own networks. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a novel poisoning strategy to prevent nodes in a target network from being linked to other networks by UIL algorithms. Specifically, the UIL problem is formalized in the kernelized topology consistency perspective, and the objective is formulated as maximizing the structural variations in the target network before and after modifications. To achieve this, a novel graph kernel is defined based on earth mover's distance (EMD) in the edge-embedding space. In terms of efficiency, a fast attack strategy is proposed using greedy searching and a lower bound approximation of EMD. Results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms six baselines and reaches a balance between effectiveness and imperceptibility while being efficient.|近年来，社交网络上的隐私问题受到广泛关注。用户身份链接(UIL)任务旨在识别不同社交网络上的相应用户，如果应用不道德，将对隐私构成威胁。敏感用户信息将通过跨网络身份链接推断出来。一个可行的解决方案是设计一个对抗策略，降低 UIL 模型的匹配性能。然而，目前大多数对图形的敌对攻击都是针对单一网络内工作的模型，没有考虑到跨网络学习任务(如 UIL)所带来的挑战。此外，在现实世界的情况下，对 UIL 的对抗策略有更多的限制，因为服务提供商只能添加扰动到他们自己的网络。为了解决这些问题，本文提出了一种新的中毒策略，以防止目标网络中的节点被 UIL 算法链接到其他网络。具体地说，UIL 问题被形式化为核拓扑一致性视角，目标被表述为在目标网络修改前后使结构变化最大化。为了实现这一点，在边嵌入空间中定义了一种新的基于地球动子距离(EMD)的图核。在效率方面，提出了一种基于贪婪搜索和 EMD 下界近似的快速攻击策略。在三个实际数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法的性能优于六个基线，在有效性和不可感知性之间达到了平衡。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=TOAK:+A+Topology-oriented+Attack+Strategy+for+Degrading+User+Identity+Linkage+in+Cross-network+Learning)|0|

A crucial step in transfer involves measuring domain discrepancy, which refers to distribution shifts between graphs from source and target domains. While conventional models simply provide a node-level measurement, exploiting information from different levels of network hierarchy is intuitive. As each hierarchical level characterizes distinct and meaningful properties or functionalities of the original graph, integrating domain discrepancy based on such hierarchies should contribute to a more precise domain discrepancy measurement. Moreover, class conditional distribution shift is often overlooked in node classification tasks, which could potentially lead to sub-optimal performance. To address the above limitations, we propose a new graph domain adaptation model and apply it to cross-network node classification tasks. Specifically, a hierarchical pooling model to extract meaningful and adaptive hierarchical structures is designed, where both marginal and class conditional distribution shifts on each hierarchical level are jointly minimized. The effectiveness is demonstrated through theoretical analysis and experimental studies across various datasets.|图域自适应模型由于能够将丰富的标签和结构知识从源图转移到目标图，因而在解决跨网络学习问题方面发挥了重要作用。转移中的一个关键步骤涉及到测量域差异，这是指来自源域和目标域的图之间的分布移位。虽然传统的模型只提供节点级的度量，但是利用来自不同层次的网络层次结构的信息是直观的。由于每个层次结构都表征了原始图的独特和有意义的属性或功能，基于这种层次结构的领域差异整合应该有助于更精确的领域差异度量。此外，在节点分类任务中，类条件分布移位往往被忽视，这可能导致性能不理想。针对上述局限性，提出了一种新的图域自适应模型，并将其应用于跨网络节点分类任务。具体地说，设计了一个分层池模型来提取有意义的和自适应的分层结构，其中边际和类别条件分布移动在每个分层级别共同最小化。通过对不同数据集的理论分析和实验研究，验证了该方法的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Improving+Graph+Domain+Adaptation+with+Network+Hierarchy)|0|

Unfortunately, users still need to write these rules manually. Prior machine learning approaches have framed automatically assigning email to folders as a classification task and do not produce symbolic rules. Prior inductive logic programming (ILP) approaches, which generate symbolic rules, fail to learn efficiently in the online environment needed for email management. To close this gap, we present EmFORE, an online system that learns symbolic rules for email classification from observations. Our key insights to do this successfully are: (1) learning rules over a folder abstraction that supports quickly determining candidate predicates to add or replace terms in a rule, (2) ensuring that rules remain consistent with historical assignments, (3) ranking rule updates based on existing predicate and folder name similarity, and (4) building a rule suppression model to avoid surfacing low-confidence folder predictions while keeping the rule for future use. We evaluate on two popular public email corpora and compare to 13 baselines, including state-of-the-art folder assignment systems, incremental machine learning, ILP and transformer-based approaches.

In this paper, we introduce SAND, a novel approach for annotating numeric columns of Web tables by linking them to properties in a knowledge graph. Our approach relies only on the semantic information readily available in knowledge graphs and not on contextual information that can be missing or labelled data which may be difficult to obtain. We show that our approach can reliably detect both semantic types (e.g., height) and unit labels (e.g., Centimeter) when the semantic type is present in the knowledge graph. Our evaluation on real-world web tables shows that our method outperforms by a large margin, in terms of accuracy, some of the state-of-the-art approaches on semantic labeling and unit detection.|有关实体的大部分定量信息表示为 Web 表，而这些表往往缺乏适当的模式和注释，这为查询和分析带来了挑战。在本文中，我们介绍了 SAND，一种新颖的方法来标注网络表格中的数字列，通过链接它们到一个知识图中的属性。我们的方法只依赖于知识图表中容易获得的语义信息，而不依赖于可能丢失或难以获得的标记数据的上下文信息。我们证明了我们的方法可以可靠地检测语义类型(例如，高度)和单位标签(例如，厘米)当语义类型存在于知识图中。我们对现实世界中的网络表格的评估表明，我们的方法在准确性方面大大优于一些最先进的语义标记和单元检测方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=SAND:+Semantic+Annotation+of+Numeric+Data+in+Web+Tables)|0|

Deep neural networks are typically used to perform such predictions, but they produce unreliable results without sufficient high-quality data. Therefore, researchers introduce lightweight statistical precision matrix learning to infer the graph structure in many IoT scenarios with limited communication and resolution of sensors. However, these methods still suffer from low-resolution data or the omission of hidden information in time-series data. To address the challenges, we propose a novel approach for Energy-efficient Dynamic Sparse Graph Structure Estimation with one-bit data, EDGE. Our method proposes a novel estimator to estimate the covariance matrix from one-bit data, and then utilize the covariance matrices to capture the dynamic structure. We theoretically demonstrate the effectiveness of the estimators by deriving two non-asymptotic estimation error bounds for the estimated covariance matrix and precision matrix, respectively. The theoretical results show that our method can achieve a consistent result of the precision matrix at the rate O(log p/n). On multiple synthetic and real-world datasets, the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed estimator is able to obtain a relatively high detection rate using one-bit data, which exceeds the baseline by 35%, and identify potentially perturbed nodes in real-time dynamic network inference.|基于图结构数据的图形知识发现是各个领域，尤其是物联网领域中一个引人注目的数据挖掘话题，从这些信息性数据中推断出图形结构可以使许多下游任务受益。深度神经网络通常用于执行这样的预测，但是它们在没有足够高质量数据的情况下产生不可靠的结果。因此，研究人员引入了轻量级统计精度矩阵学习来推断在传感器通信和分辨率有限的物联网场景中的图结构。然而，这些方法仍然存在低分辨率数据或时间序列数据中隐藏信息的遗漏问题。为了解决这一问题，我们提出了一种新的基于一位数据的能量有效的动态稀疏图结构估计方法 EDGE。我们的方法提出了一个新的估计器来估计单位数据的协方差矩阵，然后利用协方差矩阵来捕获动态结构。我们从理论上证明了估计的有效性，通过导出估计的协方差矩阵和精度矩阵的两个非渐近估计误差界。理论分析结果表明，该方法在速率为 O (log p/n)时，可以得到精度矩阵一致的结果。在多个合成和真实数据集上，实验结果表明，我们提出的估计器能够使用单位数据获得相对较高的检测率，超过基线35% ，并在实时动态网络推理中识别潜在的干扰节点。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Graph+Inference+via+the+Energy-efficient+Dynamic+Precision+Matrix+Estimation+with+One-bit+Data)|0|

Lauw|Singapore Management University, Singapore, Singapore|Variational Autoencoder (VAE) offers a non-linear probabilistic modeling of user's preferences. While it has achieved remarkable performance at collaborative filtering, it typically samples a single vector for representing user's preferences, which may be insufficient to capture the user's diverse interests. Existing solutions extend VAE to model multiple interests of users by resorting a variant of self-attentive method, i.e., employing prototypes to group items into clusters, each capturing one topic of user's interests. Despite showing improvements, the current design could be more effective since prototypes are randomly initialized and shared across users, resulting in uninformative and non-personalized clusters. To fill the gap, firstly, we introduce iterative latent attention for personalized item grouping into VAE framework to infer multiple interests of users. Secondly, we propose to incorporate implicit differentiation to improve training of our iterative refinement model. Thirdly, we study the self-attention to refine cluster prototypes for item grouping, which is largely ignored by existing works. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate stronger performance of our method over those of baselines.|变量自动编码器(VAE)提供用户偏好的非线性概率建模。虽然它在协同过滤上取得了显著的性能，但它通常采用一个单一的向量来表示用户的偏好，这可能不足以捕捉用户的不同兴趣。现有的解决方案将 VAE 扩展到多用户兴趣模型，采用了一种变体的自我关注方法，即利用原型将项目分组到集群中，每个项目捕获用户兴趣的一个主题。尽管有所改进，但当前的设计可能更有效，因为原型是随机初始化的，并在用户之间共享，导致无信息和非个性化的集群。为了填补这一空白，我们首先在 VAE 框架中引入个性化项目分组的迭代潜在注意，以推断用户的多重兴趣。其次，我们提出加入隐式微分来改善我们的迭代求精模型的训练。再次，研究了自注意对项目分组的聚类原型进行细化的问题，但现有的研究大多忽略了这一问题。在三个真实世界数据集上的大量实验表明，我们的方法比基线方法的性能更强。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Multi-Representation+Variational+Autoencoder+via+Iterative+Latent+Attention+and+Implicit+Differentiation)|0|

Inspired by trend-seasonality decomposition, we propose a method that combines global modeling with local feature extraction within the seasonal cycle. It aims at capturing the global view while fully exploring the potential features within each seasonal cycle and better expressing the long-term and periodic characteristics of time series. We introduce a frequency domain parity correction block to compute global attention and utilize multi-scale dilated convolution to extract local correlations within each cycle. Additionally, we adopt a dual-branch structure to separately model the seasonality and trend based on their intrinsic features, improving prediction performance and enhancing model interpretability. This model is implemented on a completely single-layer decoder architecture, breaking through the traditional encoder-decoder architecture paradigm and reducing computational complexity to a certain extent.

Due to the monolingual text and rampant confusing triggers, traditional ED models suffer from semantic confusions in terms of polysemy and synonym, leading to severe detection mistakes. Such semantic confusions can be further exacerbated in a practical situation where scarce labeled data cannot provide sufficient semantic clues. To mitigate such bottleneck, we propose a multilingual prompt learning (MultiPLe) framework for few-shot event detection (FSED), including three components, i.e., a multilingual prompt, a hierarchical prototype and a quadruplet contrastive learning module. In detail, to ease the polysemy confusion, the multilingual prompt module develops the in-context semantics of triggers via the multilingual disambiguation and prior knowledge in pretrained language models. Then, the hierarchical prototype module is adopted to diminish the synonym confusion by connecting the captured inmost semantics of fuzzy triggers with labels at a fine granularity. Finally, we employ the quadruplet contrastive learning module to tackle the insufficient label representation and potential noise. Experiments on two public datasets show that MultiPLe outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in weighted F1-score, presenting a maximum improvement of 13.63% for FSED.|事件检测(ED)是信息抽取领域的一项具有挑战性的任务。由于单语文本和猖獗的混淆触发，传统的 ED 模型在多义词和同义词方面存在语义混淆，导致严重的检测错误。在实际情况下，这种语义混淆可能会进一步加剧，因为稀缺的标记数据不能提供足够的语义线索。为了缓解这种瓶颈，我们提出了一个多语言提示学习(MultiPLe)框架用于少镜头事件检测(FSED) ，该框架包括三个组件，即多语言提示、层次原型和四元组对比学习模块。具体来说，为了缓解多义现象，多语言提示模块通过多语言消歧和预训练语言模型中的先验知识，开发了触发器的上下文语义。然后，采用层次化原型模块，将模糊触发器捕获的最内层语义与标签细粒度地连接起来，以消除同义词混淆。最后，我们利用四元组对比学习模组来处理不充分的标签表示和潜在的噪声。在两个公共数据集上的实验表明，MultiPLe 在加权 F1得分方面优于最先进的基线，FSED 的最大改善率为13.63% 。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=MultiPLe:+Multilingual+Prompt+Learning+for+Relieving+Semantic+Confusions+in+Few-shot+Event+Detection)|0|
|[Understanding and Modeling Collision Avoidance Behavior for Realistic Crowd Simulation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615098)|Zihan Yu, Guozhen Zhang, Yong Li, Depeng Jin|Tsinghua University, Beijing, China|For walking pedestrians, when they are blocked by obstacles or other pedestrians, they adjust their speeds and directions to avoid colliding with them, which is called collision avoidance behavior. This behavior is the most complex part of pedestrians' walking processes and its modeling and simulation are the keys to realistic crowd simulation, which serves as the foundation for various applications. However, most existing methods either lack the representation power to accurately model the complex collision behavior or do not model it explicitly, which leads to a poor level of realism of the simulation. To realize realistic crowd simulation, we propose to analyze, understand, and model the collision avoidance behavior in a data-driven way. First, to automatically detect collision avoidance behavior for further analysis, we propose a domain transformation algorithm that detects it by transforming the trajectories in the spatial domain into a new domain where the behavior is much more apparent and is thus easier to detect. The new domain also provides a new perspective for understanding collision avoidance behavior. Second, since there are no mature metrics to evaluate the level of realism, we propose a new evaluation metric based on the least-effort theory, which evaluates the realism of collision avoidance behavior by its physical and mental consumption. This evaluation metric also provides the foundation of modeling. Third, for realistic crowd simulation, we design a reinforcement learning model. It trains agents with our proposed reward function that models pedestrians' intrinsic needs of "reducing effort consumption'' and thus can guide agents to behave realistically when avoiding collisions. Extensive experiments show our model is 55.9% and 52.5% more realistic in collision avoidance behavior than the best baselines on two real-world datasets. We release our codes at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/TECRL.|对于行走的行人，当他们被障碍物或其他行人阻挡时，他们会调整自己的速度和方向以避免与他们发生碰撞，这种行为被称为避碰行为。这种行为是行人行走过程中最复杂的部分，其建模与模拟是真实人群模拟的关键，也是各种应用的基础。然而，现有的大多数方法要么缺乏对复杂碰撞行为进行精确建模的表示能力，要么没有对其进行明确的建模，从而导致仿真的真实性较差。为了实现真实的人群仿真，我们提出用数据驱动的方法来分析、理解和建模避碰行为。首先，为了自动检测避碰行为以便进一步分析，我们提出了一种域变换算法，该算法通过将空间域中的轨迹转换为一个新的域来检测避碰行为，该域的行为更加明显，因此更容易检测。这一新领域也为理解避碰行为提供了一个新的视角。其次，由于目前还没有成熟的指标来评价避碰行为的实际水平，本文提出了一种新的基于最小努力理论的避碰行为实际水平评价指标，即通过避碰行为的身心消耗来评价避碰行为的实际水平。这个评估指标也提供了建模的基础。第三，为了实现真实的人群模拟，我们设计了一个强化学习模型。它用我们提出的奖励函数训练代理，该函数模拟行人“减少努力消耗”的内在需求，从而可以指导代理在避免碰撞时实际行动。大量实验表明，该模型在避免碰撞行为方面比两个真实数据集上的最佳基线分别提高了55.9% 和52.5% 。我们在 https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/tecrl 公布密码。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Understanding+and+Modeling+Collision+Avoidance+Behavior+for+Realistic+Crowd+Simulation)|0|

Though existing dynamic graph modeling methods have achieved satisfactory results, they still suffer from three key limitations, hindering their scalability and further applicability. i) Indiscriminate updating. For incoming edges, existing methods would indiscriminately deal with them, which may lead to more time consumption and unexpected noisy information. ii) Ineffective node-wise long-term modeling. They heavily rely on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as a backbone, which has been demonstrated to be incapable of fully capturing node-wise long-term dependencies in event sequences. iii) Neglect of re-occurrence patterns. Dynamic graphs involve the repeated occurrence of neighbors that indicates their importance, which is disappointedly neglected by existing methods. In this paper, we present iLoRE, a novel dynamic graph modeling method with instant node-wise Long-term modeling and Re-occurrence preservation. To overcome the indiscriminate updating issue, we introduce the Adaptive Short-term Updater module that will automatically discard the useless or noisy edges, ensuring iLoRE's effectiveness and instant ability. We further propose the Long-term Updater to realize more effective node-wise long-term modeling, where we innovatively propose the Identity Attention mechanism to empower a Transformer-based updater, bypassing the limited effectiveness of typical RNN-dominated designs. Finally, the crucial re-occurrence patterns are also encoded into a graph module for informative representation learning, which will further improve the expressiveness of our method.

However, INER faces the challenge of catastrophic forgetting specific for incremental learning, further aggravated by background shift (i.e., old and future entity types are labeled as the non-entity type in the current task). To address these challenges, we propose a method called task Relation Distillation and Prototypical pseudo label (RDP) for INER. Specifically, to tackle catastrophic forgetting, we introduce a task relation distillation scheme that serves two purposes: 1) ensuring inter-task semantic consistency across different incremental learning tasks by minimizing inter-task relation distillation loss, and 2) enhancing the model's prediction confidence by minimizing intra-task self-entropy loss. Simultaneously, to mitigate background shift, we develop a prototypical pseudo label strategy that distinguishes old entity types from the current non-entity type using the old model. This strategy generates high-quality pseudo labels by measuring the distances between token embeddings and type-wise prototypes. We conducted extensive experiments on ten INER settings of three benchmark datasets (i.e., CoNLL2003, I2B2, and OntoNotes5). The results demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements over the previous state-of-the-art methods, with an average increase of 6.08% in Micro F1 score and 7.71% in Macro F1 score.|增量命名实体识别(INER)涉及到新实体类型的连续学习，而不需要访问先前学习的类型的训练数据。然而，INER 面临着特定于在线机机器学习的灾难性遗忘的挑战，背景变化进一步加剧了这一挑战(即，旧的和未来的实体类型在当前任务中被标记为非实体类型)。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种基于 INER 的任务关系提取和原型伪标签(RDP)方法。具体来说，为了解决灾难性遗忘问题，我们引入了一个任务关系精馏方案，该方案有两个目的: 1)通过最小化任务间关系精馏损失来确保不同在线机机器学习任务间的语义一致性; 2)通过最小化任务内自熵损失来提高模型的预测置信度。同时，为了减少背景移位，我们开发了一个原型的伪标签策略，使用旧的模型区分旧的实体类型和当前的非实体类型。该策略通过测量令牌嵌入和类型原型之间的距离来生成高质量的伪标签。我们对三个基准数据集(即 CoNLL2003、 I2B2和 OntoNotes5)的10个 INER 设置进行了广泛的实验。实验结果表明，该方法在微 F1评分和宏 F1评分上的平均增长率分别为6.08% 和7.71% ，明显优于以往的最新评分方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Task+Relation+Distillation+and+Prototypical+Pseudo+Label+for+Incremental+Named+Entity+Recognition)|0|

The region-based approach is the current mainstream approach, which first generates candidate spans and then classifies them into predefined categories. However, this method suffers from several drawbacks, including over-reliance on span representation, vulnerability to unbalanced category distribution, and inaccurate span boundary detection. To address these problems, we propose to model the nested NER problem into a head-tail mapping problem, namely, HTMapper, which detects head boundaries first and then models a conditional mapping from head to tail under a given category. Based on this mapping, we can find corresponding tails under different categories for each detected head by enumerating all entity categories. Our approach directly models the head boundary and tail boundary of entities, avoiding over-reliance on the span representation. Additionally, Our approach utilizes category information as an indicator signal to address the imbalance of category distribution during category prediction. Furthermore, our approach enhances the detection of span boundaries by capturing the correlation between head and tail boundaries.

The selected structured convolutional kernel in the global branch has been specifically crafted with sublinear complexity, thereby allowing for the efficient and effective processing of lengthy and noisy input signals. Empirical studies on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that GCformer outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing MSE error in multivariate time series benchmarks by 4.38% and model parameters by 61.92%. In particular, the global convolutional branch can serve as a plug-in block to enhance the performance of other models, with an average improvement of 31.93%, including various recently published Transformer-based models. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Yanjun-Zhao/GCformer.|基于变压器的模型已经成为时间序列预测的有前途的工具。然而，这些模型不能对长输入时间序列做出准确的预测。一方面，它们未能捕捉到时间序列数据的长期依赖性。另一方面，长的输入序列通常会导致大的模型规模和高的时间复杂度。为了解决这些局限性，我们提出了 GCformer，它结合了用于处理长输入序列的结构化全局卷积分支和用于捕获短的、最近的信号的基于局部变压器的分支。引入了一个全局卷积内核的内聚框架，使用了三种不同的参量化方法。全局分支中所选择的结构化卷积核具有特定的次线性复杂度，从而可以有效地处理冗长而嘈杂的输入信号。对6个基准数据集的实证研究表明，GCform 方法的性能优于最先进的方法，使多变量时间序列基准的 MSE 误差降低了4.38% ，模型参数的 MSE 误差降低了61.92% 。特别是，全局卷积分支可以作为一个插件块来增强其他模型的性能，平均改进率为31.93% ，其中包括最近发布的各种基于 Transformer 的模型。我们的代码可以在 https://github.com/yanjun-zhao/gcformer 上公开获取。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=GCformer:+An+Efficient+Solution+for+Accurate+and+Scalable+Long-Term+Multivariate+Time+Series+Forecasting)|0|

Achieving high accuracy in a data stream environment is a challenging task considering disruptive changes in the data distribution, also known as concept drift. A greater diversity of ensemble components is known to enhance prediction accuracy in such settings. Despite the diversity of components within an ensemble, not all contribute as expected to its overall performance. This necessitates a method for selecting components that exhibit high performance and diversity. We present a novel ensemble construction and maintenance approach based on MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance) that dynamically combines the diversity and prediction accuracy of components during the process of structuring an ensemble. The experimental results on both four real and 11 synthetic datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach (DynED) provides a higher average mean accuracy compared to the five state-of-the-art baselines.|集成方法由于其显著的性能，在分类中得到了广泛的应用。在数据流环境中实现高精度是一项具有挑战性的任务，考虑到数据分布的破坏性变化，也称为概念漂移。众所周知，集合分量的更大多样性可以提高这种情况下的预测精度。尽管一个集合中的组件多种多样，但并非所有组件都如预期的那样对其整体性能有贡献。这就需要一种方法来选择具有高性能和多样性的组件。提出了一种基于最大边际相关(MMR)的集成构建和维护方法，该方法在集成构建过程中动态地综合了组件的多样性和预测精度。在4个实际数据集和11个合成数据集上的实验结果表明，与5个最先进的基线相比，该方法提供了更高的平均精度。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=DynED:+Dynamic+Ensemble+Diversification+in+Data+Stream+Classification)|0|

However, in most cases these graphs are significantly class-imbalanced. To address this issue, graph oversampling has recently been proposed to synthesize nodes and edges, which still suffers from graph heterophily, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose HOVER, which implements Homophilic Oversampling Via Edge Removal for bot detection on graphs. Instead of oversampling nodes and edges within initial graph structure, HOVER designs a simple edge removal method with heuristic criteria to mitigate heterophily and learn distinguishable node embeddings, which are then used to oversample minority bots to generate a balanced class distribution without edge synthesis. Experiments on TON IoT networks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of HOVER on bot detection with high graph heterophily and extreme class imbalance.|由于恶意机器人驻留在网络中以破坏网络的稳定性，图神经网络(GNN)已经成为最流行的机器人检测方法之一。然而，在大多数情况下，这些图是显着的类不平衡。为了解决这个问题，最近提出了图过采样来综合节点和边，这仍然受到图异构性的影响，导致次优性能。本文提出了 HOVER 方法，通过边缘去除实现图上机器人的同态过采样检测。HOVER 设计了一种简单的基于启发式标准的边去除方法，用以消除异构性，学习可区分的节点嵌入，而不需要对初始图结构中的节点和边进行过采样，然后利用过采样的少数机器人生成一个不需要边合成的均衡类分布。在 TON 物联网上的实验表明，HOVER 在具有高度图异构性和极端类不平衡的机器人检测方面具有很好的性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=HOVER:+Homophilic+Oversampling+via+Edge+Removal+for+Class-Imbalanced+Bot+Detection+on+Graphs)|0|

Though they have made remarkable progress on this task, their method still suffers from two important issues: 1) It is inadequate to extract multiple intents using only utterance encoding; 2) Optimizing two sub-tasks (intent number prediction and known intent matching) independently leads to inconsistent predictions.

This research is typically motivated by the argumentation that using such enhanced knowledge graphs to solve downstream tasks will improve performance. Nonetheless, this is hardly ever evaluated. Instead, the predominant evaluation metrics - aiming at correctness and completeness - are undoubtedly valuable but fail to capture the complete picture, i.e., how useful the created or enhanced knowledge graph actually is. Further, the accessibility of such a knowledge graph is rarely considered (e.g., whether it contains expressive labels, descriptions, and sufficient context information to link textual mentions to the entities of the knowledge graph). To better judge how well knowledge graphs perform on actual tasks, we present KGrEaT - a framework to estimate the quality of knowledge graphs via actual downstream tasks like classification, clustering, or recommendation. Instead of comparing different methods of processing knowledge graphs with respect to a single task, the purpose of KGrEaT is to compare various knowledge graphs as such by evaluating them on a fixed task setup. The framework takes a knowledge graph as input, automatically maps it to the datasets to be evaluated on, and computes performance metrics for the defined tasks.

Recent studies actively utilize attention-based mechanisms to capture the correlation between questions and combine it with the learner's characteristics for responses. However, our empirical study shows that existing attention-based KT models neglect the learner's forgetting behavior, especially as the interaction history becomes longer. This problem arises from the bias that overprioritizes the correlation of questions while inadvertently ignoring the impact of forgetting behavior. This paper proposes a simple-yet-effective solution, namely Forgetting-aware Linear Bias (FoLiBi), to reflect forgetting behavior as a linear bias. Despite its simplicity, FoLiBi is readily equipped with existing attentive KT models by effectively decomposing question correlations with forgetting behavior. FoLiBi plugged with several KT models yields a consistent improvement of up to 2.58% in AUC over state-of-the-art KT models on four benchmark datasets.|知识追踪(KT)旨在追踪基于问题解决历史的熟练程度，使我们能够提供一个简化的课程。最近的研究积极利用基于注意的机制来捕捉问题之间的相关性，并将其与学习者的反应特征结合起来。然而，我们的实证研究表明，现有的基于注意的 KT 模型忽视了学习者的遗忘行为，特别是随着交互历史的增长。这个问题产生于一种偏见，即过度优先考虑问题的相关性，而无意中忽略了遗忘行为的影响。本文提出了一种简单而有效的解决方案，即遗忘感知线性偏差(FoLiBi) ，以反映遗忘行为作为一种线性偏差。尽管 FoLiBi 很简单，但它可以通过有效地分解与遗忘行为的问题相关性，很容易地配备现有的注意 KT 模型。在四个基准数据集上，与最先进的 KT 模型相比，用几个 KT 模型封装的 FoLiBi 在 AUC 上获得了高达2.58% 的一致性改进。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Forgetting-aware+Linear+Bias+for+Attentive+Knowledge+Tracing)|0|

In this paper, we alleviate this problem by presenting~\sysname, a novel framework that tackles dataset bias by leveraging generative models to amplify bias and facilitate the learning of debiased representations of the classifier. Our method involves three major steps. We initially train a biased classifier, denoted as f_b, on a biased dataset and extract the top-K biased-conflict samples. Next, we train a generator solely on a bias-conflict dataset comprised of these top-K samples, aiming to learn the distribution of bias-conflict samples. Finally, we re-train the classifier on the newly constructed debiased dataset, which combines the original and amplified data. This allows the biased classifier to competently learn debiased representation.

|[T-SaS: Toward Shift-aware Dynamic Adaptation for Streaming Data](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615267)|Weijieying Ren, Tianxiang Zhao, Wei Qin, Kunpeng Liu|The Pennsylvania State University, State College, PA, USA; Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China; Portland State University, Portland , OR, USA|In many real-world scenarios, distribution shifts exist in the streaming data across time steps. Many complex sequential data can be effectively divided into distinct regimes that exhibit persistent dynamics. Discovering the shifted behaviors and the evolving patterns underlying the streaming data are important to understand the dynamic system. Existing methods typically train one robust model to work for the evolving data of distinct distributions or sequentially adapt the model utilizing explicitly given regime boundaries. However, there are two challenges: (1) shifts in data streams could happen drastically and abruptly without precursors. Boundaries of distribution shifts are usually unavailable, and (2) training a shared model for all domains could fail to capture varying patterns. This paper aims to solve the problem of sequential data modeling in the presence of sudden distribution shifts that occur without any precursors. Specifically, we design a Bayesian framework, dubbed as T-SaS, with a discrete distribution-modeling variable to capture abrupt shifts of data. Then, we design a model that enable adaptation with dynamic network selection conditioned on that discrete variable. The proposed method learns specific model parameters for each distribution by learning which neurons should be activated in the full network. A dynamic masking strategy is adopted here to support inter-distribution transfer through the overlapping of a set of sparse networks. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method is superior in both accurately detecting shift boundaries to get segments of varying distributions and effectively adapting to downstream forecast or classification tasks.|在许多实际场景中，流数据中存在跨时间步长的分布变化。许多复杂的顺序数据可以有效地划分为具有持续动态的不同区域。发现流数据背后的移动行为和演化模式对于理解动态系统非常重要。现有的方法通常训练一个稳健的模型来处理不同分布的演化数据，或者利用明确给定的制度边界顺序调整模型。然而，有两个挑战: (1)数据流的转移可能发生剧烈和突然没有前兆。分布转移的边界通常是不可用的，(2)为所有领域训练一个共享模型可能无法捕获不同的模式。本文旨在解决在没有任何前兆的情况下发生突变分布的时序数据建模问题。具体来说，我们设计了一个被称为 T-SaS 的贝叶斯框架，其中包含一个离散的分布建模变量来捕获数据的突变。然后，我们设计了一个以该离散变量为条件的动态网络选择自适应模型。该方法通过学习在整个网络中哪些神经元应该被激活来学习每个分布的特定模型参数。该算法采用动态掩蔽策略，通过一组稀疏网络的重叠来支持分布间转移。大量实验表明，该方法在准确检测移位边界以获得变化分布的片段和有效适应下游预测或分类任务方面具有优势。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=T-SaS:+Toward+Shift-aware+Dynamic+Adaptation+for+Streaming+Data)|0|

CPD methods generally compare the distribution of data sequences before and after a given time step to infer if there is a shift in distribution at the said time step. Numerous divergence measures, which measure distance between data distributions of sequence pairs, have been proposed for CPD \citeMStatisticNIPS, BergCPD and often the choice of divergence measure depends on the data used. Density Ratio Estimation (DRE) \citeRelDivCPD,BergCPD can be used to estimate a broad family of f-divergences, which includes widely used CPD divergences like Kullback-Leibler (KL) and Pearson, and thus DRE is a popular approach for CPD. In this work, we improve upon the existing DRE techniques for CPD, by proposing a novel objective that combines DRE seamlessly with adversarial sample generation. The adversarial samples allows for a robust CPD with DRE to track subtle changes in distribution, leading to a reduction in false negatives.

Real estate appraisal serves as one of the high-cost property valuation tasks for financial institutions since it requires domain experts to appraise the estimation based on the corresponding knowledge and the judgment of the market. Existing automated valuation models reducing the subjectivity of domain experts require a large number of transactions for effective evaluation, which is predominantly limited to not only the labeling efforts of transactions but also the generalizability of new developing and rural areas. To learn representations from unlabeled real estate sets, existing self-supervised learning (SSL) for tabular data neglects various important features, and fails to incorporate domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose DoRA, a Domain-based self-supervised learning framework for low-resource Real estate Appraisal. DoRA is pre-trained with an intra-sample geographic prediction as the pretext task based on the metadata of the real estate for equipping the real estate representations with prior domain knowledge. Furthermore, inter-sample contrastive learning is employed to generalize the representations to be robust for limited transactions of downstream tasks. Our benchmark results on three property types of real-world transactions show that DoRA significantly outperforms the SSL baselines for tabular data, the graph-based methods, and the supervised approaches in the few-shot scenarios by at least 7.6% for MAPE, 11.59% for MAE, and 3.34% for HR10%.

|[STREAMS: Towards Spatio-Temporal Causal Discovery with Reinforcement Learning for Streamflow Rate Prediction](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614719)|Paras Sheth, Ahmadreza Mosallanezhad, Kaize Ding, Reepal Shah, John Sabo, Huan Liu, K. Selçuk Candan|Tulane University, New Orleans, LA, USA; Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA|The capacity to anticipate streamflow is critical to the efficient functioning of reservoir systems as it gives vital information to reservoir operators about water release quantities as well as help quantify the impact of environmental factors on downstream water quality. Yet, streamflow modelling is difficult owing to the intricate interactions between different watershed outlets. In this paper, we argue that one possible solution to this problem is to identify the causal structure of these outlets, which would allow for the identification of crucial watershed outlets while capturing the spatiotemporally informed complex relationships leading to improved hydrological resource management. However, due to the inherent complexity of spatiotemporal causal learning problems, extending existing causal discovery methods to a whole basin is a major hurdle. To address these issues, we offer STREAMS, a new framework that uses Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize the search space for causal discovery and an LSTM-GCN based autoencoder to infer spatiotemporal causal features for streamflow rate prediction. We conduct extensive experiments on the Brazos river basin carried out within the scope of a US Army Corps of Engineers, Engineering With Nature Initiative project, including empirical studies of generalization performance to verify the nature of the inferred relationships.|预测流量的能力对于水库系统的有效运作至关重要，因为它向水库管理人员提供关于水释放量的重要信息，并有助于量化环境因素对下游水质的影响。然而，由于不同流域出口之间错综复杂的相互作用，流量建模是困难的。在本文中，我们认为一个可能的解决方案是确定这些出口的因果结构，这将有助于确定关键的流域出口，同时捕捉时空信息的复杂关系，从而改善水文资源管理。然而，由于时空因果学习问题的固有复杂性，将现有的因果发现方法推广到整个流域是一个主要障碍。为了解决这些问题，我们提供了一个新的框架—— STREAMS，它使用强化学习(RL)来优化因果发现的搜索空间，以及一个基于 LSTM-gcn 的自动编码器来推断用于流量预测的时空因果特征。我们在美国陆军工兵（印度）“自然工程倡议”项目范围内对布拉索斯河流域进行了广泛的实验，包括对推断关系的性质进行泛化性能的实证研究。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=STREAMS:+Towards+Spatio-Temporal+Causal+Discovery+with+Reinforcement+Learning+for+Streamflow+Rate+Prediction)|0|
|[Combating Ad Fatigue via Frequency-Recency Features in Online Advertising Systems](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615461)|Natalia Silberstein, Or Shoham, Assaf Klein|Outbrain, Netanya, Israel|Online advertising is a driving force of Internet services today. One of the main challenges in advertising systems is finding the right balance between user experience and overall revenue. In this paper we address one of the problems that negatively impacts the user experience, specifically, the repeated display of identical ads to the same user. This problem leads to the phenomenon called "ad fatigue", characterized by diminished interest in the ad, resulting in a decrease in the click-through rate (CTR) as users encounter the same ad repeatedly. Naive solutions such as placing a hard limit on the number of times a specific ad is displayed to a specific user, usually come at the cost of reduced revenue. To address the ad fatigue problem, we introduce a new family of features, called FoRI (Frequency over Recent Intervals). FoRI features integrate information about frequency and recency of previous user-ad interactions within the CTR prediction model. This approach involves allocating these interactions to unevenly distributed time intervals, enabling a higher emphasis on more recent interactions. Furthermore, we introduce new metrics to assess ad fatigue in terms of the repetitiveness and novelty of the displayed ads. We conducted a comprehensive large-scale online evaluation which shows that integrating FoRI features into our CTR prediction model offers two-fold benefits. Firstly, it improves user experience by reducing the occurrence of repeated ads by 15%, and increasing the exposure to unseen ads by 5% (ads not previously displayed to the user), leading to a substantial boost in CTR. Secondly, it significantly increases revenue.|在线广告是当今互联网服务的驱动力。广告系统的主要挑战之一是在用户体验和总收入之间找到正确的平衡。在本文中，我们解决了一个对用户体验产生负面影响的问题，具体来说，就是对同一用户重复显示相同的广告。这个问题导致了所谓的“广告疲劳”现象，即拥有属性对广告的兴趣降低，导致用户反复看到同一个广告时点进率(ctrr)下降。一些简单的解决方案，比如对某个特定的广告向某个特定的用户显示的次数设置严格的限制，通常是以减少收入为代价的。为了解决广告疲劳问题，我们引入了一系列新的特性，称为 FoRI (最近间隔的频率)。ForRI 在 CTR 预测模型中整合了以前用户-广告交互的频率和近期信息。这种方法涉及到将这些交互分配给不均匀分布的时间间隔，从而能够更加强调最近的交互。此外，我们引入了新的指标来评估广告疲劳的重复性和新颖性的显示广告。我们进行了一次全面的大规模在线评估，结果表明将 FoRI 特征集成到我们的 CTR 预测模型中可以带来双重好处。首先，它通过减少15% 的重复广告和增加5% 的无形广告(之前没有显示给用户的广告)提高了用户体验，从而大大提高了点击率。其次，它显著增加了收入。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Combating+Ad+Fatigue+via+Frequency-Recency+Features+in+Online+Advertising+Systems)|0|

Even for a simple task such as lexicon set expansion, where an AI model suggests new entities to add to a predefined seed set of entities, thousands of models are available. However, deciding which model to use for a given set expansion task is non-trivial. In hindsight, some models can be 'off topic' for specific set expansion tasks, while others might work well initially but quickly exhaust what they have to offer. Additionally, certain models may require more careful priming in the form of samples or feedback before being finetuned to the task at hand. In this work, we frame this model selection as a sequential non-stationary problem, where there exist a large number of diverse pre-trained models that may or may not fit a task at hand, and an expert is shown one suggestion at a time to include in the set or not, i.e., accept or reject the suggestion. The goal is to expand the list with the most entities as quickly as possible. We introduce MArBLE, a hierarchical multi-armed bandit method for this task, and two strategies designed to address cold-start problems. Experimental results on three set expansion tasks demonstrate MArBLE's effectiveness compared to baselines.|现代研究界对于预先训练好的人工智能模型有着丰富的资料，这令人尴尬。即使是像词典集扩展这样的简单任务(AI 模型建议新的实体添加到预定义的实体种子集中) ，也有数千个模型可用。然而，决定对给定的集合扩展任务使用哪个模型是非常重要的。事后看来，对于特定的集合扩展任务，一些模型可能会“偏离主题”，而其他模型可能一开始工作得很好，但很快就会用尽它们所能提供的东西。此外，某些模型可能需要以样本或反馈的形式进行更仔细的启动，然后才能适应手头的任务。在这项工作中，我们将这个模型选择框架为一个连续的非平稳问题，其中存在大量不同的预先训练的模型，这些模型可能适合也可能不适合手头的任务，并且每次向专家展示一个建议，以便将其包含在集合中，也就是说，接受或拒绝这个建议。目标是尽可能快地扩展包含最多实体的列表。我们将介绍一种用于这项任务的分层多臂老虎机方法—— MARBLE，以及用于解决冷启动问题的两种策略。在三个集合扩展任务上的实验结果证明了该算法的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=MArBLE:+Hierarchical+Multi-Armed+Bandits+for+Human-in-the-Loop+Set+Expansion)|0|

EFFECTS has a twofold contribution: (1) It significantly facilitates the exploration of MTSC data, and (2) it generates informative yet intuitive and explainable features to be used by the classification model. EFFECTS first mines the MTS data and extracts a set of interpretable features using an optimized transform-slice-aggregate process. To evaluate the quality of EFFECTS features, we gauge how well each feature distinguishes between every two classes, and how well they characterize each single class. Users can then explore the MTS data via the EFFECTS Explorer, which facilitates the visual inspection of important features, dimensions, and time slices. Last, the user can use the top features for each class when building a classification pipeline. We demonstrate EFFECTS on several real-world MTSC datasets, inviting the audience to investigate the data via EFFECTS Explorer and obtain initial insights on the time series data.

|[From User Activity Traces to Navigation Graph for Software Enhancement: An Application of Graph Neural Network (GNN) on a Real-World Non-Attributed Graph](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615998)|Ikram Boukharouba, Florence Sèdes, Christophe Bortolaso, Florent Mouysset|Berger-Levrault, Labège, France; IRIT Universite Toulouse 3 Paul Sabatier; Berger-Levrault, Toulouse, France; IRIT Universite Toulouse 3 Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France|Understanding software's user behavior is key to personalizing and enriching the user experience and improving the quality of the software. In this paper, we consider the use of user navigation graphs issued from user activity traces. The aim of our study is to do node classification over the user graph navigation in order to understand better the composition of the software and to offer a better experience to the users. Traditional baseline methods has shown good performance in the node classification task, but can't be applied for tasks as link prediction. Graph Neural Network on the contrary can satisfy both node classification and link prediction. However, GNN produce significant results when the features on the nodes are numerous enough. This is not always the case in real-world problems, because too many features implies too much data, storage issues, affect the performances of apps, etc. Indeed, due to the origin of the data and their uncontrolled generation, the resulting graphs contain few or no features (AKA non-attributed graphs). In addition, in industrial fields, some external requirements particularly legal may limit the collection and the use of data. In this article, we show that graphs issued from real-world data also have such limitations, and we propose the generation of artificial features on the nodes as a solution to this problem. The obtained results showed that the usage of artificial node features is a promising solution to overcome the greediness of GNN in terms of node features and applying GNN on the non-attributed graphs.|理解软件的用户行为是个性化和丰富用户体验以及提高软件质量的关键。在本文中，我们考虑使用用户导航图发出的用户活动跟踪。我们的研究目的是在用户图导航上进行节点分类，以便更好地了解软件的组成，并为用户提供更好的体验。传统的基线方法在节点分类任务中表现出了良好的性能，但不适用于链路预测任务。相反，图神经网络可以同时满足节点分类和链路预测。然而，当节点上的特征足够多时，GNN 会产生显著的结果。在现实世界的问题中并不总是这样，因为太多的特性意味着太多的数据、存储问题、影响应用程序的性能等等。事实上，由于数据的来源及其不受控制的生成，所得到的图包含很少或没有特征(AKA 非属性图)。此外，在工业领域，一些特别合法的外部要求可能会限制数据的收集和使用。在这篇文章中，我们表明，从现实世界的数据发布的图也有这样的局限性，我们提出了在节点上生成人工特征作为这个问题的解决方案。结果表明，利用人工节点特征克服 GNN 在节点特征方面的贪婪性，并将 GNN 应用于非属性图是一种有前途的解决方案。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=From+User+Activity+Traces+to+Navigation+Graph+for+Software+Enhancement:+An+Application+of+Graph+Neural+Network+(GNN)+on+a+Real-World+Non-Attributed+Graph)|0|

Misclassifying products can cause compliance issues and hurt the company's reputation. To address this problem, we propose an automated system to proactively detect product misclassifications by overcoming several challenges. A large e-commerce retailer can sell billions of distinct products, on which many thousands of classification tasks are performed. At this massive scale, we need to quickly detect misclassifications under a limited budget. In this talk, we point out these challenges and show how we design our system to handle them. When evaluated on a set of Amazon's product classification data, at an overhead of <10% of the classification cost, our system automatically identified and corrected many misclassifications, which would take a human many thousand years to manually find and 14.6 years to manually review and correct if our system were not used.|在电子商务中，产品分类被广泛用于各种目的。错误分类产品可能会导致法规遵循问题，并损害公司的声誉。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个自动化系统，通过克服几个挑战来主动检测产品错误分类。大型电子商务零售商可以销售数十亿种不同的产品，在这些产品上执行成千上万的分类任务。在如此巨大的规模下，我们需要在有限的预算下快速发现错误分类。在这个演讲中，我们指出了这些挑战，并展示了我们如何设计系统来应对它们。当在亚马逊的一组产品分类数据上进行评估时，我们的系统自动识别和纠正了许多错误分类，如果我们的系统没有被使用，这将需要人类数千年的时间来手动发现和14.6年的时间来手动审查和纠正。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Proactive+and+Automatic+Detection+of+Product+Misclassifications+at+Massive+Scale)|0|

Woo|Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Republic of Korea; Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Republic of Korea|Though digital financial systems have provided users with convenient and accessible services, such as supporting banking or payment services anywhere, it is necessary to have robust security to protect against identity misuse. Thus, online digital identity (ID) verification plays a crucial role in securing financial services on mobile platforms. One of the most widely employed techniques for digital ID verification is that mobile applications request users to take and upload a picture of their own ID cards. However, this approach has vulnerabilities where someone takes pictures of the ID cards belonging to another person displayed on a screen, or printed on paper to be verified as the ID card owner. To mitigate the risks associated with fraudulent ID card verification, we present a novel dataset for classifying cases where the ID card images that users upload to the verification system are genuine or digitally represented. Our dataset is replicas designed to resemble real ID cards, making it available while avoiding privacy issues. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our dataset is effective for detecting digitally represented ID card images, not only in our replica dataset but also in the dataset consisting of real ID cards. Our dataset is available at https://github.com/DASH-Lab/idcard_fraud_detection.|虽然数字金融系统为用户提供了方便易用的服务，例如在任何地方支持银行或支付服务，但必须有强大的安全保障，以防止身份被滥用。因此，在线数字身份(ID)验证在保障移动平台上的金融服务安全方面起着至关重要的作用。数字身份验证最广泛使用的技术之一是，移动应用程序要求用户拍摄并上传自己身份证的照片。然而，这种方法存在一些漏洞，即有人将属于另一个人的身份证照片显示在屏幕上，或打印在纸上，以便核实身份证持有人。为了减低验证伪造身份证的风险，我们提供了一个新的数据集，用于分类用户上载到验证系统的身份证图像是真实或数码表示的情况。我们的数据集是复制品，设计得像真正的身份证，使其可用，同时避免隐私问题。通过大量的实验，我们证明了我们的数据集对于检测数字表示的身份证图像是有效的，不仅在我们的副本数据集中，而且在由真实身份证组成的数据集中。我们的数据集 https://github.com/dash-lab/idcard_fraud_detection 可用。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=KID34K:+A+Dataset+for+Online+Identity+Card+Fraud+Detection)|0|
|[OpenGDA: Graph Domain Adaptation Benchmark for Cross-network Learning](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615127)|Boshen Shi, Yongqing Wang, Fangda Guo, Jiangli Shao, Huawei Shen, Xueqi Cheng|Institute of Computing Technology, CAS & University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; Institute of Computing Technology, CAS, Beijing, China|Graph domain adaptation models are widely adopted in cross-network learning tasks, with the aim of transferring labeling or structural knowledge. Currently, there mainly exist two limitations in evaluating graph domain adaptation models. On one side, they are primarily tested for the specific cross-network node classification task, leaving tasks at edge-level and graph-level largely under-explored. Moreover, they are primarily tested in limited scenarios, such as social networks or citation networks, lacking validation of model's capability in richer scenarios. As comprehensively assessing models could enhance model practicality in real-world applications, we propose a benchmark, known as OpenGDA. It provides abundant pre-processed and unified datasets for different types of tasks (node, edge, graph). They originate from diverse scenarios, covering web information systems, urban systems and natural systems. Furthermore, it integrates state-of-the-art models with standardized and end-to-end pipelines. Overall, OpenGDA provides a user-friendly, scalable and reproducible benchmark for evaluating graph domain adaptation models. The benchmark experiments highlight the challenges of applying GDA models to real-world applications with consistent good performance, and potentially provide insights to future research. As an emerging project, OpenGDA will be regularly updated with new datasets and models. It could be accessed from https://github.com/Skyorca/OpenGDA.|图域自适应模型广泛应用于跨网络学习任务中，其目的是传递标记或结构化知识。目前，评估图域自适应模型主要存在两个局限性。一方面，它们主要针对特定的跨网络节点分类任务进行测试，使得边缘层和图层的任务在很大程度上没有得到充分的探索。此外，它们主要在有限的场景中进行测试，如社交网络或引文网络，缺乏对模型在更丰富场景中的能力的验证。由于综合评估模型可以增强模型在实际应用中的实用性，我们提出了一个基准，称为 OpenGDA。它为不同类型的任务(节点、边、图)提供了丰富的预处理和统一的数据集。它们来源于不同的场景，包括网络信息系统、城市系统和自然系统。此外，它还将最先进的模型与标准化的端到端管道集成在一起。总的来说，OpenGDA 为评估图形域适应模型提供了一个用户友好、可伸缩和可重复的基准。基准实验突出了将 GDA 模型应用于具有一致良好性能的现实世界应用程序的挑战，并可能为未来的研究提供深刻见解。作为一个新兴的项目，OpenGDA 将定期更新新的数据集和模型。可以从 https://github.com/skyorca/opengda 进入。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=OpenGDA:+Graph+Domain+Adaptation+Benchmark+for+Cross-network+Learning)|0|
|[Generative AI and the Future of Information Access](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615317)|Chirag Shah|University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA|The prominent model of retrieving, evaluating, and using relevant information from databases, collections, and the web is going through a significant transformation. This is largely due to wide-scale availability of various generative AI systems that can take in natural language inputs and generate highly customized natural language text, images, audio, and videos. This transformation in how people seek and access information will have profound impacts on users, developers, and policymakers. It is already changing many sectors including education, health, and commerce. But the hopes and hypes of generative AI are often not clear as we get swept up by either the current capabilities and limitations of this technology in the short term or fear from speculative future in the long term. Instead, I believe we need to approach this area pragmatically and with scientific curiosity, scholarly rigor, and societal responsibility. In this talk, I will highlight some of the opportunities and challenges for information access stemming from recent advancements in generative AI. For instance, there are new possibilities now for addressing accessibility, low-resource domains, and bias in training data using generative AI tools. On the other hand, there are new challenges concerning hallucination, toxicity, and information provenance. It is clear that we want to benefit from what AI systems are capable of, but how do we do that while curbing some of these problems? I will argue that the solution is multifaceted and complex -- some will require technical advancements and others will call for policy changes. We will need to not only build information systems with fairness, transparency, and accountability in mind, but also train a new generation of developers, policymakers, and of course the users. The goal here is to cut through both hype and fear and think pragmatically about the future of information access.|检索、评估和使用来自数据库、集合和网络的相关信息的突出模式正在经历一个重大转变。这在很大程度上归功于各种生成 AI 系统的广泛应用，这些系统可以接收自然语言输入并生成高度定制的自然语言文本、图像、音频和视频。人们如何寻找和获取信息的这种转变将对用户、开发人员和决策者产生深远的影响。它已经改变了包括教育、卫生和商业在内的许多领域。但是，生成性人工智能的希望和炒作往往并不明朗，因为我们要么在短期内被这种技术的当前能力和局限性所席卷，要么在长期内对投机性未来感到恐惧。相反，我认为我们需要以务实的态度，带着科学的好奇心、学术的严谨性和社会责任感来处理这个问题。在这次演讲中，我将强调一些信息获取的机遇和挑战，这些机遇和挑战来自生成性人工智能的最新进展。例如，现在有新的可能性解决可访问性，低资源领域，和偏见的训练数据使用生成人工智能工具。另一方面，有关幻觉，毒性和信息来源的新挑战。很明显，我们希望从人工智能系统的能力中获益，但我们如何做到这一点，同时抑制其中一些问题？我认为解决方案是多方面和复杂的——有些需要技术进步，有些需要政策变更。我们不仅需要建立公平、透明和负责任的信息系统，还需要培训新一代的开发人员、决策者，当然还有用户。这里的目标是消除大肆宣传和恐惧，实事求是地思考信息访问的未来。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Generative+AI+and+the+Future+of+Information+Access)|0|

(MIT), Sunnyvale (Cambridge), USA; Aliveo AI, Austin, TX, USA|Social networks are prosperous marketplaces where creators and consumers congregate to share and consume various content. In general, products that rank content for distribution (such as newsfeeds, stories, and notifications) and are related to edge recommendations (such as connect to members, follow celebrities or groups or hashtags) optimize the experience of active users. Typically, such users generate ample interaction data amenable to accurate model training and prediction. In contrast, we prioritize enhancing the experience of inactive members (IMs) who do not have a rich connection network. We formulate strategies for recommending superior edges to help members grow their connection network. Adapting the recommendations provides enormous value to the IMs and can significantly influence their future behaviour and engagement with the ecosystem. To that end, we propose a general and scalable multi-objective optimization (MOO) framework to provide more value to IMs as invitation recipients on LinkedIn, a professional network with over 900M members. To deal with the enormous scale, we formulate the problem as a massive constrained linear optimization involving billions of variables and millions of constraints and efficiently solve it using accelerated gradient descent,making this the largest deployment of LP-based recommender systems worldwide. Furthermore, the proposed MOO paradigm can solve the general problem of matching different types of entities in an m-sided marketplace. Finally, we discuss the challenges and benefits of implementing and ramping our method in production at scale at LinkedIn and report our findings about the core business metrics related to users' engagement and network health.|社交网络是繁荣的市场，创作者和消费者聚集在一起分享和消费各种内容。一般来说，对发布内容进行排名的产品(如新闻源、故事和通知)和与边缘推荐相关的产品(如与成员联系、关注名人或群组或标签)优化了活跃用户的体验。通常，这样的用户生成大量的交互数据，可以进行精确的模型训练和预测。相比之下，我们优先考虑增强没有丰富连接网络的非活动成员(IM)的体验。我们制定策略，推荐优势，以帮助会员发展他们的联系网络。采纳这些建议为管理系统提供了巨大的价值，可以对它们今后的行为和与生态系统的接触产生重大影响。为此，我们提出了一个通用的和可扩展的多目标优化(MOO)框架，以提供更多的价值即时通讯作为邀请收件人在 LinkedIn，一个专业网络超过900万成员。为了解决这个庞大的问题，我们将这个问题表述为一个涉及数十亿变量和数百万约束的大规模约束线性优化问题，并使用加速梯度下降法有效地解决这个问题，从而使这个问题成为全球范围内基于 LP 的推荐系统中规模最大的部署。此外，提出的 MOO 范式可以解决在多边市场中匹配不同类型实体的一般问题。最后，我们在 LinkedIn 上讨论了在大规模生产中实施和扩展我们的方法的挑战和好处，并报告了我们关于与用户参与和网络健康相关的核心业务指标的发现。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Optimizing+for+Member+Value+in+an+Edge+Building+Marketplace)|0|

However, existing approaches usually require a large set of human annotated explanations for training while collecting a large set of explanations is not only time consuming but also expensive. In this paper, we develop a general framework for interpretable natural language understanding that requires only a small set of human annotated explanations for training. Our framework treats natural language explanations as latent variables that model the underlying reasoning process of a neural model. We develop a variational EM framework for optimization where an explanation generation module and an explanation-augmented prediction module are alternatively optimized and mutually enhance each other. Moreover, we further propose an explanation-based self-training method under this framework for semi-supervised learning. It alternates between assigning pseudo-labels to unlabeled data and generating new explanations to iteratively improve each other. Experiments on two natural language understanding tasks demonstrate that our framework can not only make effective predictions in both supervised and semi-supervised settings, but also generate good natural language explanation.|最近生成的自然语言解释已经显示出非常有希望的结果，不仅提供可解释的解释，而且提供额外的信息和监督预测。然而，现有的方法通常需要大量的人工注释解释来进行培训，而收集大量的解释不仅耗费时间，而且成本高昂。在本文中，我们开发了一个可解释的自然语言理解的一般框架，只需要一小组人工注释的训练解释。我们的框架将自然语言解释作为潜在变量，模拟神经模型的潜在推理过程。本文提出了一个变分 EM 优化框架，其中解释生成模块和解释增强预测模块交替优化并相互增强。此外，我们进一步建议在这个架构下，采用以解释为本的自我训练方法，训练半监督学习。它可以将伪标签分配给未标记的数据，也可以生成新的解释以反复改进彼此。在两个自然语言理解任务上的实验表明，该框架不仅能够在监督和半监督环境下进行有效的预测，而且能够产生良好的自然语言解释。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Interpretable+Natural+Language+Understanding)|0|

Existing methods often regard an image as a set of visual objects, trying to explicitly capture the relations between visual objects and entities. However, since visual objects are often not identical to entities in quantity and type, they may suffer the bias introduced by visual objects rather than aid. Inspired by the success of textual prompt-based fine-tuning (PF) approaches in many methods, in this paper, we propose a Multimodal Prompt-based Machine Reading Comprehension based framework to implicit alignment between text and image for improving MNER, namely MPMRC-MNER. Specifically, we transform text-only query in MRC into multimodal prompt containing image tokens and text tokens. To better integrate image tokens and text tokens, we design a prompt-aware attention mechanism for better cross-modal fusion. At last, contrastive learning with two types of contrastive losses is designed to learn more consistent representation of two modalities and reduce noise. Extensive experiments and analyses on two public MNER datasets, Twitter2015 and Twitter2017, demonstrate the better performance of our model against the state-of-the-art methods.|多模态命名实体识别(MNER)是一个视觉语言任务，其目的是检测实体跨度，并将其分类为相应的实体类型给出一个句子-图像对。现有的方法通常将图像视为一组可视对象，试图显式地捕获可视对象和实体之间的关系。然而，由于视觉对象在数量和类型上往往与实体不完全相同，它们可能受到视觉对象引入的偏见的影响，而不是受到辅助的影响。受基于文本提示的微调(PF)方法在许多方法中取得成功的启发，本文提出了一种基于多模式提示的机器阅读理解的框架，用于文本和图像之间的隐式对齐以改善 MNER，即 MPMRC-MNER。具体来说，我们将 MRC 中的纯文本查询转换为包含图像标记和文本标记的多模式提示。为了更好地集成图像标记和文本标记，我们设计了一种更好的跨模态融合的快速感知注意机制。最后，设计了两种对比损失下的对比学习算法，使两种模式的表示更加一致，从而降低了噪声。对两个公开的 MNER 数据集 Twitter2015和 Twitter2017进行了大量的实验和分析，证明了我们的模型比最先进的方法具有更好的性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=MPMRC-MNER:+A+Unified+MRC+framework+for+Multimodal+Named+Entity+Recognition+based+Multimodal+Prompt)|0|

Transfer learning has been a feasible way to transfer knowledge from high-quality external data of source domains to limited data of target domains, which follows a domain-level knowledge transfer to learn a shared posterior distribution. However, they are usually built on strong assumptions, e.g., the domain invariant posterior distribution, which is usually unsatisfied and may introduce noises, resulting in poor generalization ability on target domains. Inspired by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that aggregate information from neighboring nodes, we redefine the paradigm as learning a knowledge-enhanced posterior distribution for target domains, namely Knowledge Bridge Learning (KBL). KBL first learns the scope of knowledge transfer by constructing a Bridged-Graph that connects knowledgeable samples to each target sample and then performs sample-wise knowledge transfer via GNNs.KBL is free from strong assumptions and is robust to noises in the source data. Guided by KBL, we propose the Bridged-GNN} including an Adaptive Knowledge Retrieval module to build Bridged-Graph and a Graph Knowledge Transfer module.

In this work, we study the privacy challenges in enabling fine-grained privacy in health data sharing. Our work is motivated by recent research findings, in which patients and healthcare providers may have different privacy preferences and policies that need to be addressed.

Our solution builds on randomized techniques to provide rigorous privacy protection for sensitive elements and leverages graphical models to mitigate privacy leakage due to dependent elements.

|[Fair&Share: Fast and Fair Multi-Criteria Selections](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614874)|Kathleen Cachel, Elke A. Rundensteiner|USC-ISI|AbstractWith the widespread use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems and applications in our everyday lives, accounting for fairness has gained significant importance in designing and engineering of such systems. AI systems can be used in many sensitive environments to make important and life-changing decisions; thus, it is crucial to ensure that these decisions do not reflect discriminatory behavior toward certain groups or populations. More recently some work has been developed in traditional machine learning and deep learning that address such challenges in different subdomains. With the commercialization of these systems, researchers are becoming more aware of the biases that these applications can contain and are attempting to address them. In this survey, we investigated different real-world applications that have shown biases in various ways, and we listed different sources of biases that can affect AI applications. We then created a taxonomy for fairness definitions that machine learning researchers have defined to avoid the existing bias in AI systems.

However, with the dramatic and rapid changes in the world environment, the assumption that data obey Independent Identically Distribution is undermined by the subsequent changes in data distribution, known as concept drift, leading to weak replicability and transferability of the model over unseen data. To address the issue, previous approaches typically retrain the model, forcing it to fit the most recent observed data. However, retraining is problematic in that it leads to model lag, consumption of resources, and model re-invalidation, causing the drift problem to be not well solved in realistic scenarios. In this study, we propose a new urban time series prediction model for the concept drift problem, which encodes the drift by considering the periodicity in the data and makes on-the-fly adjustments to the model based on the drift using a meta-dynamic network. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our design significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and can be well generalized to existing prediction backbones by reducing their sensitivity to distribution changes.|城市时间序列数据预测作为智能城市的一项重要任务，对城市可持续发展作出了重要贡献。然而，随着世界环境的急剧和迅速变化，数据服从独立同一分布的假设被随后的数据分布变化(称为概念漂移)所破坏，导致模型对无形数据的可复制性和可转移性较弱。为了解决这个问题，以前的方法通常会重新训练模型，迫使它适应最近观察到的数据。然而，再训练会导致模型滞后、资源消耗和模型再失效，使得漂移问题在现实情况下得不到很好的解决。针对概念漂移问题，提出了一种新的城市时间序列预测模型。在真实世界数据集上的实验表明，我们的设计明显优于最先进的方法，可以很好地推广到现有的预测骨干，降低其对分布变化的敏感性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=MemDA:+Forecasting+Urban+Time+Series+with+Memory-based+Drift+Adaptation)|0|

Among such correlations, there can be spurious ones which suffer from the language prior learned from the training corpus and therefore undermine the overall effectiveness of the learned model. To tackle this issue, we introduce a Structural Causal Model (SCM) to induce the underlying causal structure of the summarization data. We assume several latent causal factors and non-causal factors, representing the content and style of the document and summary. Theoretically, we prove that the latent factors in our SCM can be identified by fitting the observed training data under certain conditions. On the basis of this, we propose a Causality Inspired Sequence-to-Sequence model (CI-Seq2Seq) to learn the causal representations that can mimic the causal factors, guiding us to pursue causal information for summary generation. The key idea is to reformulate the Variational Auto-encoder (VAE) to fit the joint distribution of the document and summary variables from the training corpus. Experimental results on two widely used text summarization datasets demonstrate the advantages of our approach.|数据驱动的抽象摘要模型的主流趋向于探索相关性，而不是因果关系。在这些相关性中，可能存在一些虚假的相关性，这些相关性受到事先从培训语料库中学到的语言的影响，因此会破坏所学模型的整体有效性。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了一个结构性因果模型(SCM)来归纳总结数据的潜在因果结构。我们假设几个潜在的因果因素和非因果因素，代表的内容和风格的文件和总结。从理论上证明了在一定条件下，通过拟合观测训练数据可以识别供应链管理中的潜在因素。在此基础上，我们提出了一个受因果关系启发的序列到序列模型(CI-Seq2Seq)来学习可以模拟因果因素的因果表征，指导我们追求因果信息以进行摘要生成。其核心思想是对变分自动编码器(VAE)进行重构，以适应训练语料中文档和汇总变量的联合分布。在两个广泛使用的文本摘要数据集上的实验结果证明了该方法的优越性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Inducing+Causal+Structure+for+Abstractive+Text+Summarization)|0|

Due to the high cost of ST data collection, improving ST prediction in a lack of data is significant. For this purpose, existing meta-learning methods have been demonstrated powerful by learning an initial network from training tasks and adjusting to target tasks with limited data. However, such shared knowledge from a set of tasks may contain irrelevant noise due to the gap of region-varying ST dynamics, resulting in the negative transfer issue. As a revelation of regional functional patterns, region profiles give rise to the diversity of ST dynamics. Thus, we design a novel adaptive meta-optimized model MetaRSTP, which conducts the initial prediction model in a finer-granularity of region level with region profiles as semantic evidence. To enhance the expressiveness of profiles, we firstly build a semantic alignment space to explore the inter-view co-semantics. Fusing it with view-specific uniqueness, the multi-view region profiles can be better applied in urban tasks. Then, a regional bias generator derives non-shared parameters in terms of profiles, which alleviates the divergence among regions. We set a new meta-learning strategy as initialize the network with fixed generalizable parameters and region-adaptive bias, thus enhancing the personalized prediction performance even in few-shot scenarios. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets illustrate the effectiveness of our MetaRSTP and our learned region profiles.|城市时空预测在智能城市建设中起着至关重要的作用。由于 ST 段数据采集成本较高，因此在缺乏数据的情况下改进 ST 段预测具有重要意义。为此，现有的元学习方法通过从训练任务中学习初始网络并根据有限的数据调整到目标任务已被证明是有效的。然而，由于区域变化的 ST 动力学之间的差异，来自一组任务的共享知识可能含有不相关的噪声，从而导致负迁移问题。区域剖面揭示了区域功能格局，引起了 ST 动力学的多样性。因此，我们设计了一个新的自适应元优化模型 MetaRSTP，该模型以区域轮廓作为语义证据，在较细粒度的区域水平上进行初始预测模型。为了提高配置文件的表达能力，我们首先构建了一个语义对齐空间来探索访问共语义。结合视图特定的唯一性，多视图区域轮廓可以更好地应用于城市任务。然后，区域偏差发生器根据轮廓推导出非共享参数，减小了区域间的差异。我们设置了一种新的元学习策略，即在固定的可推广参数和区域自适应偏差的情况下对网络进行初始化，从而提高了在少镜头情况下的个性化预测性能。对真实世界数据集的大量实验说明了我们的 MetaRSTP 和我们学习的区域概况的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Region+Profile+Enhanced+Urban+Spatio-Temporal+Prediction+via+Adaptive+Meta-Learning)|0|

Recently, the fundamental network analysis task on signed graphs, namely link sign prediction, has received careful attention. Existing methods learn two target node representations independently, and the sign between these two nodes is predicted based on similarity. However, such a paradigm is node-centric that cannot distinguish node pairs with distinct contexts, thus lowering the prediction performance. Learning pair-centric representation is therefore a rewarding way to be aware of differences between pairs. There is no study yet on how to build such an appropriate representation that can effectively infer the sign between the target node pair. In this paper, we provide a new perspective to conduct link sign prediction within the paradigm of subgraph classification and propose a novel Subgraph-based link Sign Prediction (SSP) model. Technically, SSP uses importance-based sampling to extract an informative subgraph around each target node pair. For each subgraph, an innovative node labeling scheme is designed to encode its structural and signed information for representation learning. To further utilize the subgraph representation for imbalanced sign classification, SSP employs self-pruning contrastive learning to gain balanced representations. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that SSP consistently and significantly outperforms all the state-of-the-art baselines.|签名图是一种普遍的数据结构，包含正向和负向链接。近年来，有符号图的基本网络分析任务，即链路符号预测，受到了广泛的关注。现有的方法分别学习两个目标节点的表示，并根据相似性对这两个节点之间的符号进行预测。然而，这种模式是以节点为中心的，不能区分具有不同上下文的节点对，从而降低了预测性能。因此，学习以配对为中心的表征是了解配对之间差异的一种有益的方法。目前还没有研究如何建立这样一个适当的表示，可以有效地推断符号之间的目标节点对。本文从子图分类的角度提出了一种新的链路符号预测方法，并提出了一种新的基于子图的链路符号预测(SSP)模型。从技术上讲，SSP 使用基于重要性的抽样来提取每个目标节点对周围的信息子图。针对每个子图，设计了一种新的节点标记方案，对其结构信息和符号信息进行编码，用于表示学习。为了进一步利用子图表示进行不平衡符号分类，SSP 采用自剪枝对比学习来获得平衡表示。对真实世界数据集的大量实验表明，SSP 始终如一地显著优于所有最先进的基线。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Learning+Pair-Centric+Representation+for+Link+Sign+Prediction+with+Subgraph)|0|

Accurate prediction of these extreme events is challenging because of their sparsity in the training data and their distinct responses to external drivers when compared to non-extreme observations. To overcome these challenges, we propose a sample reweighting strategy to escalate the importance of extreme events in the training process while preserving the predictive performance in normal time periods. The sample weight for each training data point is estimated as the similarity with the target test data point using contextual information and physical simulation. The obtained sample weight values are then used to fine-tune the initial model to transfer it to the test data. This method is further enhanced by an extreme value theory-based loss function to enforce the distribution of extreme data points and accelerated by a clustering algorithm based on the estimated similarities. Additionally, we introduce an online learning strategy to further refine the predictive model using newly collected observed data. The experimental results using real stream data from the Delaware River Basin over the past 36 years demonstrate that our meta-transfer-learning method produces more accurate predictions in both normal and extreme time periods when compared to baselines without the sample re-weighting scheme. The similarity learning method can reveal meaningful relationships amongst data points. We also show that the clustering algorithm can be used to accelerate the prediction while not compromising the predictive performance. The online learning strategy is shown to further improve predictive performance using recently observed data.|提出了一种基于显式极端事件模型的元传递学习方法来预测河网日最高水温。这些极端事件的准确预测是具有挑战性的，因为它们的训练数据稀少，与非极端观测相比，它们对外部驱动因素的反应截然不同。为了克服这些挑战，我们提出了一个样本重新加权策略，以提高极端事件在训练过程中的重要性，同时保持在正常时间段的预测性能。利用上下文信息和物理仿真，将每个训练数据点的样本权重估计为与目标测试数据点的相似度。然后使用获得的样本权重值对初始模型进行微调，将其传输到测试数据。该方法进一步通过基于极值理论的损失函数增强极值数据点的分布，并通过基于估计相似度的聚类算法加速。此外，我们引入了一个在线学习策略，使用新收集的观测数据进一步完善预测模型。使用特拉华河流域过去36年的实际水流数据的实验结果表明，与没有样本重新加权方案的基线相比，我们的元转移学习方法在正常和极端时间段产生更准确的预测。相似性学习方法可以揭示数据点之间有意义的关系。我们还表明，聚类算法可以在不影响预测性能的前提下加快预测速度。在线学习策略利用最近的观测数据进一步提高了预测性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Meta-Transfer-Learning+for+Time+Series+Data+with+Extreme+Events:+An+Application+to+Water+Temperature+Prediction)|0|

However, most PLMs, such as T5 and GPT3, have a huge amount of parameters, fine-tuning them is often expensive and time consuming, and storing them takes up a lot of space. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt a parameter-efficient approach to reduce parameters of PLMs in fine-tuning without compromising their performance in downstream tasks. In this paper, we design a novel adapter which only acts on self-attention outputs in PLMs. This adapter adopts element-wise linear transformation using Hadamard product, hence named as Hadamard adapter, requires the fewest parameters compared to previous parameter-efficient adapters. In addition, we also summarize some tuning patterns for Hadamard adapter shared by various downstream tasks, expecting to provide some guidance for further parameter reduction with shared adapters in future studies. The experiments conducted on the widely-used GLUE benchmark with several SOTA PLMs prove that the Hadamard adapter achieves competitive performance with only 0.033% parameters compared with full fine-tuning, and it has the fewest parameters compared with other adapters. Moreover, we further find that there is also some redundant layers in the Hadamard adapter which can be removed to achieve more parameter efficiency with only 0.022% parameters.|近年来，预训练语言模型(PLM)已经深入人工智能的各个领域，并取得了巨大的成功。然而，大多数 PLM，如 T5和 GPT3，都有大量的参数，对它们进行微调通常代价高昂且耗时，并且存储它们占用大量空间。因此，有必要采取一种参数有效的方法，以减少参数的 PLM 在微调，而不损害其在下游任务的性能。在本文中，我们设计了一种新颖的适配器，它只作用于 PLM 中的自注意输出。这个适配器采用了使用 Hadamard 产品的元素线性映射，因此被命名为 Hadamard 适配器，与以前的参数高效适配器相比，需要的参数最少。此外，我们还总结了各种下游任务共享的 Hadamard 适配器的一些调优模式，希望在未来的研究中为共享适配器的进一步参数减少提供一些指导。利用多个 SOTA PLM 在广泛使用的 GLUE 基准上进行的实验表明，与完全微调相比，Hadamard 适配器的参数只有0.033% ，而且参数最少，具有一定的竞争力。此外，我们进一步发现，在 Hadamard 适配器中也存在一些冗余层，可以删除这些冗余层，以便在只有0.022% 参数的情况下实现更高的参数效率。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Hadamard+Adapter:+An+Extreme+Parameter-Efficient+Adapter+Tuning+Method+for+Pre-trained+Language+Models)|0|

RelD is trained on the constructed RelQA, a bilingual question-answering dialogue dataset along with answers generated by LLMs and a comprehensive set of metrics. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RelD successfully detects hallucination in the answers generated by diverse LLMs. Moreover, it performs well in distinguishing hallucination in LLMs' generated answers from both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets. Additionally, we also conduct a thorough analysis of the types of hallucinations that occur and present valuable insights.

Compared to the naive Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) problem, it is more in line with the realistic scenario whereas more complex and challenging. Existing statistical methods model the MNAR mechanism by different decomposition of the joint distribution of the complete data and the missing mask. But we empirically find that directly incorporating these statistical methods into deep generative models is sub-optimal. Specifically, it would neglect the confidence of the reconstructed mask during the MNAR imputation process, which leads to insufficient information extraction and less-guaranteed imputation quality. In this paper, we revisit the MNAR problem from a novel perspective that the complete data and missing mask are two modalities of incomplete data on an equal footing. Along with this line, we put forward a generative-model-specific joint probability decomposition method, conjunction model, to represent the distributions of two modalities in parallel and extract sufficient information from both complete data and missing mask. Taking a step further, we exploit a deep generative imputation model, namely GNR, to process the real-world missing mechanism in the latent space and concurrently impute the incomplete data and reconstruct the missing mask. The experimental results show that our GNR surpasses state-of-the-art MNAR baselines with significant margins (averagely improved from 9.9% to 18.8% in RMSE) and always gives a better mask reconstruction accuracy which makes the imputation more principle.|数据分析通常会遇到丢失不随机(MNAR)问题，其中值丢失的原因没有得到充分的观察。与天真的完全随机缺失(MCAR)问题相比，它更符合现实情况，而更复杂和具有挑战性。现有的统计方法通过对完整数据和缺失模板的联合分布进行不同的分解来模拟 MNAR 机制。但我们经验发现，直接将这些统计方法纳入深层生成模型是次优的。具体来说，它会忽略重建掩码在 MNAR 估算过程中的置信度，导致信息抽取不足和估算质量得不到保证。本文从一个新的角度重新讨论了 MNAR 问题，即完全数据和缺失掩模是不完全数据在同等条件下的两种形式。在此基础上，提出了一种特定于生成模型的联合概率分解方法——联合模型，用于并行表示两种模式的分布，并从完整数据和缺失模板中提取足够的信息。进一步，我们利用一个深层生成插补模型，即 GNR，来处理潜在空间中真实世界的缺失机制，同时对不完全数据进行插补并重构缺失掩模。实验结果表明，我们的 GNR 超越了最先进的 MNAR 基线，具有显著的边界(RMSE 平均值从9.9% 提高到18.8%) ，并且总是具有较好的掩模重建精度，使得插补更加原则。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Deep+Generative+Imputation+Model+for+Missing+Not+At+Random+Data)|0|

As KGs are widespread across multiple domains and contain important entity-relation information, and as text simplification aims to reduce the complexity of a text while preserving the meaning of the original text, we propose KGSimple, a novel approach to unsupervised text simplification which infuses KG-established techniques in order to construct a simplified KG path and generate a concise text which preserves the original input's meaning.

|[Cross-heterogeneity Graph Few-shot Learning](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614830)|Pengfei Ding, Yan Wang, Guanfeng Liu|Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW, Australia|In recent years, heterogeneous graph few-shot learning has been proposed to address the label sparsity issue in heterogeneous graphs (HGs), which contain various types of nodes and edges. The existing methods have achieved good performance by transferring generalized knowledge extracted from rich-labeled classes in source HG(s) to few-labeled classes in a target HG. However, these methods only consider the single-heterogeneity scenario where the source and target HGs share a fixed set of node/edge types, ignoring the more general scenario of cross-heterogeneity, where each HG can have a different and non-fixed set of node/edge types. To this end, we focus on the unexplored cross-heterogeneity scenario and propose a novel model for Cross-heterogeneity Graph Few-shot Learning, namely CGFL. In CGFL, we first extract meta-patterns to capture heterogeneous information and propose a multi-view heterogeneous graph neural network (MHGN) to learn meta-patterns across HGs. Then, we propose a score module to measure the informativeness of labeled samples and determine the transferability of each source HG. Finally, by integrating MHGN and the score module into a meta-learning mechanism, CGFL can effectively transfer generalized knowledge to predict new classes with few-labeled data. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets have demonstrated the superior performance of CGFL over the state-of-the-art methods.|近年来，异构图少镜头学习被提出来解决包含各种节点和边的异构图中的标签稀疏问题。现有的方法通过将源 HG 中富标记类提取的广义知识转移到目标 HG 中的少标记类，获得了良好的性能。然而，这些方法只考虑单一异质性场景，其中源和目标 HG 共享一组固定的节点/边缘类型，忽略了更一般的交叉异质性场景，其中每个 HG 可以具有不同的和非固定的节点/边缘类型集。为此，我们着眼于未探索的跨异构情景，提出了一种新的跨异构图少镜头学习模型，即 CGFL。在 CGFL 中，我们首先提取元模式来捕获异构信息，并提出了一种多视图异构图神经网络(MHGN)来学习跨 HG 的元模式。然后，我们提出了一个评分模块来衡量被标记样本的信息性，并确定每个源 HG 的可转移性。最后，通过将 MHGN 和评分模块集成到一个元学习机制中，CGFL 可以有效地传递广义知识，利用少量标记数据预测新的类别。在四个真实世界数据集上的大量实验已经证明了 CGFL 比最先进的方法具有更好的性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Cross-heterogeneity+Graph+Few-shot+Learning)|0|

Recognizing the inherent sequential relationship of spatial-temporal data, it is natural to explore the integration of boosting training mechanism to further enhance the performance of STGNNs. However, few studies have touched this research area. To bridge this gap, in this work, we propose spatial-temporal graph boosting networks, namely STGBN, which to the best of our knowledge is the first attempt to leverage gradient boosting for enhancing STGNNs. STGBN follows the general training procedure of conventional gradient boosting, but incorporates two distinctive designs to improve its efficiency in training on spatial-temporal graphs. Specifically, we design an incremental learning strategy that progressively includes spatial-temporal data into training. Additionally, we enforce an identical architecture for the base learner in all boosting iterations with each base learner inheriting from the one in the previous iteration. These designs facilitate rapid convergence of the base learner and expedite the overall training process. The base learner in STGBN is designed as a Transformer sandwich, which consists of two temporal Transformers on the top and bottom and a spatial Transformer in the middle. Structuring them in such a way helps the model capture long-range temporal dynamics, global spatial dependencies, and deep spatial-temporal interactions. We perform extensive spatial-temporal forecasting experiments on four spatial-temporal graph benchmarks. Promising results demonstrate the outstanding performance of STGBN against a wide range of state-of-the-art baseline models.|时空图形神经网络(STGNN)在解决实际时空预测问题方面具有广阔的应用前景。认识到时空数据的内在时序关系，探索增强训练机制的整合以进一步提高 STGNN 的性能是很自然的。然而，很少有研究涉及到这个研究领域。为了弥合这一差距，在这项工作中，我们提出了时空图增强网络，即 STGBN，据我们所知，这是第一次尝试利用梯度提升增强 STGNN。STGBN 遵循传统梯度提升的一般训练程序，但结合了两种独特的设计，以提高其在时空图形上的训练效率。具体来说，我们设计了一个在线机机器学习策略，逐步将时空数据纳入训练。此外，我们在所有提升迭代中为基础学习者实施一个相同的体系结构，每个基础学习者从前一个迭代继承。这些设计有利于基础学习者的快速融合，加快整个培训过程。STGBN 的基础学习器设计为一个变压器夹层，由顶部和底部的两个时间变压器和中间的一个空间变压器组成。以这种方式构造它们有助于模型捕获长期的时间动态、全局的空间依赖性和深入的时空交互。我们在四个时空图基准上进行了广泛的时空预测实验。有希望的结果表明，STGBN 的出色性能对广泛的国家最先进的基线模型。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Spatial-Temporal+Graph+Boosting+Networks:+Enhancing+Spatial-Temporal+Graph+Neural+Networks+via+Gradient+Boosting)|0|

With the success of Graph Neural Networks (GNN), there have been increasing attempts to learn representation of multi-source information leveraging its graph structures. However, existing graph methods basically combine multi-source information with different contribution scores and over-simplify the graph structures based on prior knowledge, which fail to unify complex and conflicting multi-source information. Multisensory Processing theory in cognitive neuroscience reveals human mechanism of learning multi-source information by identifying the redundancy and complementarity. Inspired by that, we propose Graph Redundancy Network (GRN) that: 1). learns a suitable representation space that maximizes multi-source interactions; 2). encodes the redundant and complementary information according to Graph Intersection and Difference of their graph structures; 3). further reinforces and explores the redundant and complementary information through low-pass and high-pass graph filters. The empirical study shows that GRN outperforms existing methods on various tasks.|近年来技术的发展不仅为图形表示学习带来了越来越多的信息，而且为图形表示学习带来了多种信息源。随着图形神经网络(GNN)的成功，人们越来越多地尝试利用其图形结构来学习多源信息的表示。然而，现有的图论方法基本上是将不同贡献分数的多源信息结合起来，过分简化了基于先验知识的图论结构，无法统一复杂、冲突的多源信息。认知神经科学的多感官加工理论揭示了人类通过识别冗余和互补来学习多源信息的机制。受此启发，我们提出了图冗余网络(GRN) : 1)。学习最大化多源交互的合适的表示空间;。根据图结构的交差对冗余信息和互补信息进行编码;。通过低通和高通图形滤波器进一步加强和探索冗余和互补信息。实证研究表明，GRN 在各种任务中的表现优于现有的方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Cognitive-inspired+Graph+Redundancy+Networks+for+Multi-source+Information+Fusion)|0|

To this end, we proposed a perception-and-decision framework, called ATEND, which consists of an adaptive perception module and a maneuver decision module. Specifically, the perception module based on Variational Autoencoder is proposed to map perceptual data of complex scenarios into basic scenarios. Then the reinforcement learning-based decision module can make high-level decisions in transformed scenarios. Once ATEND learns to drive in basic scenarios, it can achieve safe and efficient driving in real scenarios without additional training.

Over-smoothing and over-squashing are key challenges when stacking graph convolutional layers, hindering deep representation learning and information propagation from distant nodes. Our work reveals that over-smoothing and over-squashing are intrinsically related to the spectral gap of the graph Laplacian, resulting in an inevitable trade-off between these two issues, as they cannot be alleviated simultaneously. To achieve a suitable compromise, we propose adding and removing edges as a viable approach. We introduce the Stochastic Jost and Liu Curvature Rewiring (SJLR) algorithm, which is computationally efficient and preserves fundamental properties compared to previous curvature-based methods. Unlike existing approaches, SJLR performs edge addition and removal during GNN training while maintaining the graph unchanged during testing. Comprehensive comparisons demonstrate SJLR's competitive performance in addressing over-smoothing and over-squashing.|图形神经网络(GNN)已经在各种计算机科学应用中取得了成功，然而深层神经网络在其他领域的成功表现不如浅层神经网络。过度平滑和过度压缩是叠加图卷积层时面临的主要挑战，它们阻碍了深度表示学习和远距离节点的信息传播。我们的工作揭示了过度平滑和过度压缩与图的拉普拉斯谱间隙有着内在的联系，由于这两个问题不能同时得到解决，因此在这两个问题之间必然会出现权衡。为了达到一个合适的折衷，我们建议添加和去除边缘作为一个可行的方法。我们介绍了随机 Jost 和 Liu 曲率重布线(SJLR)算法，与以前的基于曲率的方法相比，SJLR 算法具有计算效率高和保持基本性质的优点。与现有的方法不同，SJLR 在 GNN 训练期间执行边添加和去除，同时在测试期间保持图形不变。全面的比较证明了 SJLR 在解决过度平滑和过度压缩方面的竞争表现。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=On+the+Trade-off+between+Over-smoothing+and+Over-squashing+in+Deep+Graph+Neural+Networks)|0|

Despite the success of existing GNN-based graph clustering methods, they often overlook the quality of graph structure, which is inherent in real-world graphs due to their sparse and multifarious nature, leading to subpar performance. Graph structure learning allows refining the input graph by adding missing links and removing spurious connections. However, previous endeavors in graph structure learning have predominantly centered around supervised settings, and cannot be directly applied to our specific clustering tasks due to the absence of ground-truth labels. To bridge the gap, we propose a novel method called \textbf{ho}mophily-enhanced structure \textbf{le}arning for graph clustering (HoLe). Our motivation stems from the observation that subtly enhancing the degree of homophily within the graph structure can significantly improve GNNs and clustering outcomes. To realize this objective, we develop two clustering-oriented structure learning modules, i.e., hierarchical correlation estimation and cluster-aware sparsification. The former module enables a more accurate estimation of pairwise node relationships by leveraging guidance from latent and clustering spaces, while the latter one generates a sparsified structure based on the similarity matrix and clustering assignments. Additionally, we devise a joint optimization approach alternating between training the homophily-enhanced structure learning and GNN-based clustering, thereby enforcing their reciprocal effects. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets of various types and scales, across a range of clustering metrics, demonstrate the superiority of HoLe against state-of-the-art baselines.|图聚类是图分析的基本任务，近年来利用图神经网络(GNN)的研究取得了令人瞩目的成果。尽管现有的基于 GNN 的图聚类方法已经取得了一定的成功，但是它们往往忽视了图结构的质量。图结构学习允许通过添加缺失链接和消除伪连接来精炼输入图。然而，以前在图结构学习的努力主要集中在监督设置，不能直接应用到我们的具体聚类任务，由于没有地面真理标签。为了弥补这一缺陷，我们提出了一种新的图聚类方法 textbf { ho } mophily 增强结构 textbf { le } arning。我们的动机来自于这样一个观察: 微妙地提高图结构中的同质性程度可以显著改善 GNN 和聚类结果。为了实现这一目标，我们开发了两个面向聚类的结构学习模块，即层次相关估计和聚类感知的稀疏化。前一个模块利用潜在空间和聚类空间的引导，更准确地估计成对节点关系，而后一个模块基于相似矩阵和聚类分配生成稀疏结构。此外，我们设计了一个联合优化方法，交替训练同质增强结构学习和基于 GNN 的聚类，从而增强它们的互惠效应。在七个不同类型和尺度的基准数据集上进行了大量的实验，通过一系列聚类度量，证明了 HoLe 相对于最先进的基准线的优越性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Homophily-enhanced+Structure+Learning+for+Graph+Clustering)|0|

However, it needs the tasks to adhere to the i.i.d. constraint, which is challenging to achieve due to complex task relationships between data content. Current methods that create tasks in a one-dimensional structure and use meta-learning to learn all tasks flatly struggle with extracting shared knowledge from tasks with overlapping concepts. To address this issue, we propose further constructing tasks from the same environment into hyper-tasks. Since the distributions of hyper-tasks and tasks in a hyper-task can both be approximated as i.i.d. due to further summarization, the meta-learning algorithm can capture shared knowledge more efficiently. Based on the hyper-task, we propose a hierarchical meta-learning paradigm to meta-learn the meta-learning algorithm. The paradigm builds a customized meta-learner for each hyper-task, which makes meta-learners more flexible and expressive. We apply the paradigm to three classic meta-learning algorithms and conduct extensive experiments on public datasets, which confirm the superiority of hierarchical meta-learning in the few-shot learning setting.

Existing CF explanation methods generate recourses under the assumption that the underlying target ML model remains stationary over time. However, due to commonly occurring distributional shifts in training data, ML models constantly get updated in practice, which might render previously generated recourses invalid and diminish end-users trust in our algorithmic framework. To address this problem, we propose RoCourseNet, a training framework that jointly optimizes predictions and recourses that are robust to future data shifts. This work contains four key contributions: (1) We formulate the robust recourse generation problem as a tri-level optimization problem which consists of two sub-problems: (i) a bi-level problem that finds the worst-case adversarial shift in the training data, and (ii) an outer minimization problem to generate robust recourses against this worst-case shift. (2) We leverage adversarial training to solve this tri-level optimization problem by: (i) proposing a novel virtual data shift (VDS) algorithm to find worst-case shifted ML models via explicitly considering the worst-case data shift in the training dataset, and (ii) a block-wise coordinate descent procedure to optimize for prediction and corresponding robust recourses. (3) We evaluate RoCourseNet's performance on three real-world datasets, and show that RoCourseNet consistently achieves more than 96% robust validity and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by at least 10% in generating robust CF explanations. (4) Finally, we generalize the RoCourseNet framework to accommodate any parametric post-hoc methods for improving robust validity.|机器学习(ML)模型的反事实(CF)解释是最终用户的首选，因为他们解释机器学习模型的预测，通过提供一个追索权(或对比)的情况下，受到预测结果的不利影响的个人。现有的 CF 解释方法在假设潜在目标 ML 模型随时间保持稳定的前提下生成资源。然而，由于训练数据中普遍存在的分布变化，机器学习模型在实际应用中不断更新，这可能导致以前生成的资源无效，并削弱最终用户对我们算法框架的信任。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了 RoCourseNet，一个联合优化预测和资源的培训框架，这些预测和资源对未来的数据转移是健壮的。这项工作包含四个关键的贡献: (1)我们把鲁棒追索生成问题描述成一个三层次的最佳化问题，其中包括两个子问题: (1)一个在训练数据中发现最坏情况下的对手变化的双层次问题，和(2)一个针对最坏情况变化生成鲁棒追索的外部最小化问题。(2)我们利用对抗性训练来解决这个三级最佳化问题: (i)提出一种新的虚拟数据移位(VDS)算法，通过明确考虑训练数据集中的最坏情况数据移位来找到最坏情况移位的机器学习模型，以及(ii)一个分块的坐标下降法程序来优化预测和相应的稳健资源。(3)我们对 RoCourseNet 在三个实际数据集上的表现进行了评估，结果显示 RoCourseNet 在产生稳健的 CF 解释方面始终达到超过96% 的稳健有效性，并且比最先进的基线至少高出10% 。(4)最后，我们推广了 RoCourseNet 框架，以适应任何参数化的事后方法来提高鲁棒有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=RoCourseNet:+Robust+Training+of+a+Prediction+Aware+Recourse+Model)|0|
|[Attacking Neural Networks with Neural Networks: Towards Deep Synchronization for Backdoor Attacks](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614784)|Zihan Guan, Lichao Sun, Mengnan Du, Ninghao Liu|University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA; Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, USA; New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA|Backdoor attacks inject poisoned samples into training data, where backdoor triggers are embedded into the model trained on the mixture of poisoned and clean samples. An interesting phenomenon can be observed in the training process: the loss of poisoned samples tends to drop significantly faster than that of clean samples, which we call the early-fitting phenomenon. Early-fitting provides a simple but effective evidence to defend against backdoor attacks, where the poisoned samples can be detected by selecting the samples with the lowest loss values in the early training epochs. Then, two questions naturally arise: (1) What characteristics of poisoned samples cause early-fitting? (2) Does a stronger attack exist which could circumvent the defense methods? To answer the first question, we find that early-fitting could be attributed to a unique property among poisoned samples called synchronization, which depicts the similarity between two samples at different layers of a model. Meanwhile, the degree of synchronization could be controlled based on whether it is captured by shallow or deep layers of the model. Then, we give an affirmative answer to the second question by proposing a new backdoor attack method, Deep Backdoor Attack (DBA), which utilizes deep synchronization to reverse engineer trigger patterns by activating neurons in the deep layer of a base neural network. Experimental results validate our propositions and the effectiveness of DBA. Our code is available at https://github.com/GuanZihan/Deep-Backdoor-Attack.|后门攻击将有毒样本注入到训练数据中，其中后门触发器被嵌入到对有毒样本和无毒样本混合进行训练的模型中。在训练过程中可以观察到一个有趣的现象: 中毒样本的损失下降速度明显快于未中毒样本，我们称之为早期拟合现象。早期拟合提供了一个简单而有效的证据来抵御后门攻击，其中中毒样本可以通过选择在早期训练阶段损失值最低的样本来检测。然后，自然而然地出现了两个问题: (1)中毒样本的什么特征会导致早期拟合？(2)是否存在可以规避防御手段的更强攻击？为了回答第一个问题，我们发现早期拟合可以归因于中毒样本之间的一个独特属性，即同步，它描述了模型不同层次上两个样本之间的相似性。同时，可以根据模型的浅层或深层对同步进行控制。然后，我们提出了一种新的后门攻击方法——深度后门攻击(Deep Backdoor Strategy，DBA) ，该方法利用深度同步技术通过激活基础神经网络深层的神经元来逆向工程触发模式，从而对第二个问题给出了肯定的回答。实验结果验证了我们的提议和 DBA 的有效性。我们的代码可以在 https://github.com/guanzihan/deep-backdoor-attack 找到。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Attacking+Neural+Networks+with+Neural+Networks:+Towards+Deep+Synchronization+for+Backdoor+Attacks)|0|
|[MGICL: Multi-Grained Interaction Contrastive Learning for Multimodal Named Entity Recognition](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614967)|Aibo Guo, Xiang Zhao, Zhen Tan, Weidong Xiao|National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China|Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (MNER) aims to combine data from different modalities (e.g. text, images, videos, etc.) for recognition and classification of named entities, which is crucial for constructing Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs). However, existing researches suffer from two prominant issues: over-reliance on textual features while neglecting visual features, and the lack of effective reduction of the feature space discrepancy of multimodal data. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a Multi-Grained Interaction Contrastive Learning framework for MNER task, namely MGICL. MGICL slices data into different granularities, i.e., sentence level/word token level for text, and image level/object level for image. By utilizing multimodal features with different granularities, the framework enables cross-contrast and narrows down the feature space discrepancy between modalities.

Additionally, a visual gate control mechanism is introduced to dynamically select relevant visual information, thereby reducing the impact of visual noise.

|[Interpretable Fake News Detection with Graph Evidence](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614936)|Hao Guo, Weixin Zeng, Jiuyang Tang, Xiang Zhao|National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China|Automatic detection of fake news has received widespread attentions over recent years. A pile of efforts has been put forward to address the problem with high accuracy, while most of them lack convincing explanations, making it difficult to curb the continued spread of false news in real-life cases. Although some models leverage external resources to provide preliminary interpretability, such external signals are not always available. To fill in this gap, in this work, we put forward an interpretable fake news detection model IKA by making use of the historical evidence in the form of graphs. Specifically, we establish both positive and negative evidence graphs by collecting the signals from the historical news, i.e., training data. Then, given a piece of news to be detected, in addition to the common features used for detecting false news, we compare the news and evidence graphs to generate both the matching vector and the related graph evidence for explaining the prediction. We conduct extensive experiments on both Chinese and English datasets. The experiment results show that the detection accuracy of IKA exceeds the state-of-the-art approaches and IKA can provide useful explanations for the prediction results. Besides, IKA is general and can be applied on other models to improve their interpretability.|虚假新闻的自动检测近年来受到了广泛的关注。为了解决这一问题，人们付出了大量努力，但大多数努力都缺乏令人信服的解释，因此难以遏制在现实案件中继续传播虚假新闻。虽然有些模型利用外部资源提供初步的可解释性，但这种外部信号并不总是可用的。为了填补这一空白，本文利用图表形式的历史证据，提出了一种可解释的假新闻检测模型 IKA。具体来说，我们通过收集历史新闻的信号，即训练数据，建立了正证据图和负证据图。然后，给定一条待检测的新闻，除了用于检测虚假新闻的常见特征之外，对新闻图和证据图进行比较，生成匹配向量和相关图证据来解释预测。我们对中文和英文数据集进行了广泛的实验。实验结果表明，IKA 算法的检测精度超过了现有的方法，为预测结果提供了有用的解释。此外，IKA 具有通用性，可以应用于其他模型以提高模型的可解释性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Interpretable+Fake+News+Detection+with+Graph+Evidence)|0|

Despite their great performance in modeling graphs, recent works show that GNNs tend to inherit and amplify the bias from training data, causing concerns of the adoption of GNNs in high-stake scenarios. Hence, many efforts have been taken for fairness-aware GNNs. However, most existing fair GNNs learn fair node representations by adopting statistical fairness notions, which may fail to alleviate bias in the presence of statistical anomalies. Motivated by causal theory, there are several attempts utilizing graph counterfactual fairness to mitigate root causes of unfairness. However, these methods suffer from non-realistic counterfactuals obtained by perturbation or generation. In this paper, we take a causal view on fair graph learning problem. Guided by the casual analysis, we propose a novel framework CAF, which can select counterfactuals from training data to avoid non-realistic counterfactuals and adopt selected counterfactuals to learn fair node representations for node classification task. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show the effectiveness of CAF.

Mohania, Vikram Goyal|IIIT Delhi, Delhi, India|We propose SCANING, an unsupervised framework for paraphrasing via controlled noise injection. We focus on the novel task of paraphrasing algebraic word problems having practical applications in online pedagogy as a means to reduce plagiarism as well as evoke reasoning capabilities on the part of the student instead of rote memorization. This task is more complex than paraphrasing general-domain corpora due to the difficulty in preserving critical information for solution consistency of the paraphrased word problem, managing the increased length of the text and ensuring diversity in the generated paraphrase. Existing approaches fail to demonstrate adequate performance on at least one, if not all, of these facets, necessitating the need for a more comprehensive solution. To this end, we model the noising search space as a composition of contextual and syntactic aspects to sample noising functions. This allows for learning a denoising function, that operates over both aspects and produces semantically equivalent and syntactically diverse outputs through grounded noise injection. The denoising function serves as a foundation for training a paraphrasing function, which operates solely in the input-paraphrase space without carrying any direct dependency on noise. We demonstrate that SCANING improves performance in terms of producing semantically equivalent and syntactically diverse paraphrases by 35% through extensive automated and human evaluation across 4 datasets.|我们提出扫描，一个无监督的框架释义通过控制噪声注入。我们的重点是解释代数词问题的新颖任务有实际应用在在线教学作为一种手段，以减少剽窃，并唤起部分学生的推理能力，而不是死记硬背。这项任务比解释一般领域语料库更为复杂，因为在解决解释词问题的一致性方面保留关键信息、管理增加的文本长度和确保生成的解释的多样性方面存在困难。现有方法未能在至少一个(如果不是全部的话)这些方面展示出足够的性能，因此需要一个更全面的解决方案。为此，我们将噪声搜索空间建模为由上下文和句法两个方面组成的样本噪声函数。这允许学习一个去噪函数，通过接地噪声注入，该函数在两个方面都起作用，并产生语义等效和语法不同的输出。去噪函数是训练复述函数的基础，复述函数只在输入-复述空间中运行，不直接依赖于噪声。我们证明，SCANING 通过在4个数据集中广泛的自动化和人工评估，提高了35% 的语义等效和句法多样性转述的性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=James+ate+5+oranges+=+Steve+bought+5+pencils:+Structure-Aware+Denoising+for+Paraphrasing+Word+Problems)|0|

Hyper-relational knowledge graph completion (HKGC) aims at inferring unknown triples while considering its qualifiers. Most existing approaches to HKGC exploit a global-level graph structure to encode hyper-relational knowledge into the graph convolution message passing process. However, the addition of multi-hop information might bring noise into the triple prediction process. To address this problem, we propose HyperFormer, a model that considers local-level sequential information, which encodes the content of the entities, relations and qualifiers of a triple. More precisely, HyperFormer is composed of three different modules: an entity neighbor aggregator module allowing to integrate the information of the neighbors of an entity to capture different perspectives of it; a relation qualifier aggregator module to integrate hyper-relational knowledge into the corresponding relation to refine the representation of relational content; a convolution-based bidirectional interaction module based on a convolutional operation, capturing pairwise bidirectional interactions of entity-relation, entity-qualifier, and relation-qualifier. realize the depth perception of the content related to the current statement. Furthermore, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts strategy into the feed-forward layers of HyperFormer to strengthen its representation capabilities while reducing the amount of model parameters and computation.

In practice, sparsely labeled graphs widely exist in the real world so self-training methods have become popular approaches by adding pseudo labeled nodes to enhance the performance of GCNs. However, we observe that most selected high-confidence pseudo labeled nodes by the existing methods would surround the true labeled nodes. It is what we called pseudo label over-dependence, which could lead to the non-uniform pseudo label distribution. Furthermore, a thorough experiment shows that the classification accuracy changes significantly under different label densities and the label-sparse regions show great potential improvement in the model performance. Based on the above findings, we theoretically analyze the constraint factors in the label-sparse regions and further propose reducing the feature distribution difference between the label-dense regions and label-sparse regions can effectively decrease the classification error. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel Graph Label Information Migration framework (GLIM) to liberate pseudo labels from over-dependence. Specifically, we first propose a training dynamics module (TDM) that uses abundant training process information to find more reliable node labels and improve the model robustness against label noise. Then we propose a label migration module (LMM) that migrates label information from label-dense regions to label-sparse regions by a spectral based graph matching algorithm. These migrated labels are like the glimmers in the darkness, providing the supervision signals for the unlabeled nodes in label-sparse regions. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GLIM.|图卷积网络(GCNs)近年来在许多图任务中取得了突出的成就，但它的成功依赖于充分的训练数据。在实际应用中，稀疏标记图广泛存在于现实世界中，因此通过增加伪标记节点来提高 GCNs 性能的自训练方法已经成为一种流行的方法。然而，我们观察到，现有方法选择的大多数高置信度伪标记节点将包围真正的标记节点。这就是我们所说的伪标签过度依赖，它可能导致非均匀的伪标签分布。实验表明，在不同的标签密度下，分类精度有显著的变化，标签稀疏区域对模型性能有很大的改善潜力。在此基础上，从理论上分析了标签稀疏区域的约束因素，进一步提出减小标签密集区域与标签稀疏区域之间的特征分布差异可以有效地减小分类误差。因此，本文提出了一种新的图形标签信息迁移框架(GLIM) ，将伪标签从过度依赖中解放出来。具体来说，我们首先提出了一个训练动力学模块(TDM) ，利用大量的训练过程信息来寻找更可靠的节点标签，提高模型对标签噪声的鲁棒性。然后提出了一种基于谱图匹配算法的标签迁移模块(LMM) ，将标签信息从标签密集区域迁移到标签稀疏区域。这些迁移的标签就像黑暗中的微光，为标签稀疏区域的未标记节点提供监控信号。最后，我们进行了广泛的实验来验证所提出的 GLIM 的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Liberate+Pseudo+Labels+from+Over-Dependence:+Label+Information+Migration+on+Sparsely+Labeled+Graphs)|0|

|[SAGE: A Storage-Based Approach for Scalable and Efficient Sparse Generalized Matrix-Matrix Multiplication](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615044)|MyungHwan Jang, YunYong Ko, HyuckMoo Gwon, Ikhyeon Jo, Yongjun Park, SangWook Kim|Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Hanyang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea|Sparse generalized matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM) is a fundamental operation for real-world network analysis. With the increasing size of real-world networks, the single-machine-based SpGEMM approach cannot perform SpGEMM on large-scale networks, exceeding the size of main memory (i.e., not scalable). Although the distributed-system-based approach could handle large-scale SpGEMM based on multiple machines, it suffers from severe inter-machine communication overhead to aggregate results of multiple machines (i.e., not efficient). To address this dilemma, in this paper, we propose a novel storage-based SpGEMM approach (SAGE) that stores given networks in storage (e.g., SSD) and loads only the necessary parts of the networks into main memory when they are required for processing via a 3-layer architecture. Furthermore, we point out three challenges that could degrade the overall performance of SAGE and propose three effective strategies to address them: (1) block-based workload allocation for balancing workloads across threads, (2) in-memory partial aggregation for reducing the amount of unnecessarily generated storage-memory I/Os, and (3) distribution-aware memory allocation for preventing unexpected buffer overflows in main memory. Via extensive evaluation, we verify the superiority of SAGE over existing SpGEMM methods in terms of scalability and efficiency.|稀疏广义矩阵乘法(SpGEMM)是实际网络分析的基本运算。随着现实网络规模的不断扩大，基于单机的 SpGEMM 方法不能在大规模网络上运行，超出了主存的规模(即不可伸缩性)。尽管基于分布式系统的方法可以处理基于多台机器的大规模 SpGEMM，但是由于需要对多台机器的结果进行聚合(即效率不高) ，使得该方法存在严重的机器间通信开销。为了解决这一难题，本文提出了一种新的基于存储的 SpGEMM 方法(SAGE) ，该方法将给定的网络存储在存储器中(如 SSD) ，当需要通过3层架构进行处理时，只将网络的必要部分加载到主存中。此外，我们指出了可能降低 SAGE 整体性能的三个挑战，并提出了三种有效的策略来解决这些问题: (1)基于块的工作负载分配，用于平衡线程间的工作负载; (2)内存部分聚合，用于减少不必要的生成存储内存 I/O 的数量; (3)分布式感知内存分配，用于防止主存中意外的缓冲区溢出。通过广泛的评估，我们验证了 SAGE 方法在可扩展性和效率方面优于现有的 SpGEMM 方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=SAGE:+A+Storage-Based+Approach+for+Scalable+and+Efficient+Sparse+Generalized+Matrix-Matrix+Multiplication)|0|

However, most existing methods approximate Shapley values based on a feature independence assumption considering the complexity of calculating exact Shapley values. This assumption could bring some counterfactual problems when interpreted features are highly correlated and result in explanations contrary to human intuition. In this paper, we propose PriSHAP to explicitly model the dependency relationship between correlated features and provide reasonable explanations for tabular data. Feature dependencies are analyzed and taken as prior information to guide the process of estimating Shapley values. Additionally, PriSHAP is free to be applied in popular Shapley value-based explainers to address counterfactual problems while providing more faithful explanations. A pipeline is given to apply PriSHAP in existing explainers with simple adjustments.

|[A Momentum Loss Reweighting Method for Improving Recall](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614764)|Chenzhi Jiang, Yin Jin, Ningtao Wang, Ruofan Wu, Xing Fu, Weiqiang Wang|Tiansuan Lab, Ant Group, Shanghai, China; Tiansuan Lab, Ant Group, Hangzhou, China|In many practical binary classification applications, such as financial fraud detection or medical diagnosis, it is crucial to optimize a model's performance on high-confidence samples whose scores are higher than a specific threshold, which is calculated by a given false positive rate according to practical requirements. However, the proportion of high-confidence samples is typically extremely small, especially in long-tailed datasets, which can lead to poor recall results and an alignment bias between realistic goals and loss. To address this challenge, we propose a novel loss reweighting framework called Momentum Threshold-Oriented Loss (MTOL) for binary classification tasks and propose two instantiated losses of it. Given a limited FPR range, MTOL aims to improve the recall of binary classification models at that FPR range by incorporating a batch memory queue and momentum estimation mechanisms. The MTOL adaptively estimates thresholds of FPR during the model training iterations and up-weights the loss of samples in the threshold range, with little consumption of storage and computation. Our experimental results on various datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet, demonstrate the significant effect of MTOL in improving the recall at low FPR especially in class imbalance settings. These results suggest that MTOL is a promising approach in scenarios where the model's performance in the low FPR range is of utmost importance.|在许多实际的二进制分类应用中，如金融欺诈检测或医疗诊断，优化模型对高置信度样本的性能是至关重要的，这些样本的得分高于特定的阈值，根据实际需求，该阈值是通过给定的假阳性率计算的。然而，高置信度样本的比例通常非常小，尤其是在长尾数据集中，这可能导致较差的召回结果和现实目标与损失之间的一致性偏差。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个新的损失重新加权框架，称为动量阈值导向损失(MTOL)的二进制分类任务，并提出了两个实例化的损失。在有限的 FPR 范围内，MTOL 旨在通过引入批记忆队列和动量估计机制来提高该 FPR 范围内二进制分类模型的召回率。在模型训练迭代过程中，MTOL 自适应估计 FPR 的阈值，并在阈值范围内增加样本损失的权重，同时减少存储和计算的消耗。我们在各种数据集上的实验结果，包括 CIFAR-10，CIFAR-100，Tiny-ImageNet，证明了 MTOL 在改善低 FPR 的召回方面的显着效果，特别是在类不平衡设置中。这些结果表明，MTOL 是一种有前途的方法在情况下，模型的性能在低 FPR 范围是至关重要的。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=A+Momentum+Loss+Reweighting+Method+for+Improving+Recall)|0|

To the best of our knowledge, we propose for the first time the problem of finding a multi-label classifier given a partially labeled hierarchical multi-label dataset. We also assume the situation where the classifier cannot access hierarchical information during training. This work proposes an iterative framework for learning both multi-labels and a hierarchical structure of classes. When training a multi-label classifier from partial labels, our model extracts a class hierarchy from the classifier output using our hierarchy extraction algorithm. Then, our proposed loss exploits the extracted hierarchy to train the classifier. Theoretically, we show that our hierarchy extraction algorithm correctly finds the unknown hierarchy under a mild condition, and we prove that our loss function of multi-label classification with such hierarchy becomes an unbiased estimator of true multi-label classification risk. Our experiments show that our model obtains a class hierarchy close to the ground-truth dataset hierarchy, and simultaneously, our method outperforms previous methods for hierarchical multi-label classification and multi-label classification from partial labels.|分层多标签分类旨在从标签组织成分层结构的数据集中学习多标签分类器。根据我们的知识，我们首次提出了在给定部分标记的层次化多标记数据集的情况下寻找多标记分类器的问题。我们还假设分类器在训练期间不能访问层次信息的情况。这项工作提出了一个迭代的框架学习两个多标签和分层结构的类。当从部分标签中训练多标签分类器时，我们的模型使用我们的层次提取算法从分类器输出中提取类层次。然后，我们提出的损失利用提取的层次结构来训练分类器。从理论上证明了我们的层次提取算法在温和的条件下正确地找到了未知的层次，并且证明了我们的具有这种层次的多标签分类的损失函数成为真正的多标签分类风险的无偏估计。实验结果表明，该模型获得了一个接近于地面真实数据集层次结构的类层次结构，同时该方法在多标签分类和部分标签多标签分类方面优于以往的方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Hierarchical+Multi-Label+Classification+with+Partial+Labels+and+Unknown+Hierarchy)|0|
|[Robust Graph Clustering via Meta Weighting for Noisy Graphs](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615038)|Hyeonsoo Jo, Fanchen Bu, Kijung Shin||How can we find meaningful clusters in a graph robustly against noise edges? Graph clustering (i.e., dividing nodes into groups of similar ones) is a fundamental problem in graph analysis with applications in various fields. Recent studies have demonstrated that graph neural network (GNN) based approaches yield promising results for graph clustering. However, we observe that their performance degenerates significantly on graphs with noise edges, which are prevalent in practice. In this work, we propose MetaGC for robust GNN-based graph clustering. MetaGC employs a decomposable clustering loss function, which can be rephrased as a sum of losses over node pairs. We add a learnable weight to each node pair, and MetaGC adaptively adjusts the weights of node pairs using meta-weighting so that the weights of meaningful node pairs increase and the weights of less-meaningful ones (e.g., noise edges) decrease. We show empirically that MetaGC learns weights as intended and consequently outperforms the state-of-the-art GNN-based competitors, even when they are equipped with separate denoising schemes, on five real-world graphs under varying levels of noise. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/HyeonsooJo/MetaGC.|我们怎样才能在一个图中找到有意义的集群对噪声边强健？图聚类(即将节点划分为相似的节点组)是图分析中的一个基本问题，在各个领域都有应用。最近的研究表明，基于图神经网络(GNN)的方法在图聚类方面取得了很好的效果。然而，我们观察到它们的性能在具有噪声边的图上明显退化，这在实际中是普遍存在的。在这项工作中，我们提出了 MetaGC 的健壮 GNN 为基础的图聚类。MetaGC 使用了一个可分解的聚类损失函数，它可以被重新表述为节点对损失的总和。我们给每个节点对添加一个可学习的权重，MetaGC 使用元加权自适应地调整节点对的权重，以便有意义的节点对的权重增加，而无意义的节点对(例如噪声边缘)的权重减少。我们的经验表明，MetaGC 按照预期学习权重，因此优于最先进的基于 GNN 的竞争对手，即使它们配备了独立的去噪方案，在五个不同噪声水平的真实世界图上。我们的代码和数据集 https://github.com/hyeonsoojo/metagc 可用。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Robust+Graph+Clustering+via+Meta+Weighting+for+Noisy+Graphs)|0|

One of the early stage's goals is to optimize a novel chemical compound to be active against a target protein associated with the disease. Often machine learning techniques are used to improve the procedure of discovering and optimizing potential drug candidates. The goal of molecule optimization is, given an input molecule, to produce a new molecule that is chemically similar to the input molecule but with an improved property. We present a novel algorithm that during optimization divides a molecule into two disjoint substructures that we call: the molecule chains and the molecule core. Our approach is inspired by expert design of chemical compounds that employ a fundamental molecular template and add to it chemical functional groups to generate compounds with desired properties. We train a model to generate the molecule chains with the desired properties for optimization, which are then attached to the molecule core to construct a novel molecule with high similarity to the input molecule. This is achieved by selective masking of pairs of input molecules' chains and cores during training. Additionally, we demonstrate the extension of this approach to data-scarce tasks, like targeting a drug to a novel protein. We first evaluate our method on standard molecule optimization tasks such as inhibition against glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3β).

Kunnath, David Pride, Petr Knoth|The Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom|Citation classification aims to identify the purpose of the cited article in the citing article. Previous citation classification methods rely largely on supervised approaches. The models are trained on datasets with citing sentences or citation contexts annotated for a citation's purpose or function or intent. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have dramatically improved the ability of NLP systems to achieve state-of-the-art performances under zero or few-shot settings. This makes LLMs particularly suitable for tasks where sufficiently large labelled datasets are not yet available, which remains to be the case for citation classification. This paper systematically investigates the effectiveness of different prompting strategies for citation classification and compares them to promptless strategies as a baseline. Specifically, we evaluate the following four strategies, two of which we introduce for the first time, which involve updating Language Model (LM) parameters while training the model: (1) Promptless fine-tuning, (2) Fixed-prompt LM tuning, (3) Dynamic Context-prompt LM tuning (proposed), (4) Prompt + LM fine-tuning (proposed). Additionally, we test the zero-shot performance of LLMs, GPT3.5, a (5) Tuning-free prompting strategy that involves no parameter updating. Our results show that prompting methods based on LM parameter updating significantly improve citation classification performances on both domain-specific and multi-disciplinary citation classifications. Moreover, our Dynamic Context-prompting method achieves top scores both for the ACL-ARC and ACT2 citation classification datasets, surpassing the highest-performing system in the 3C shared task benchmark. Interestingly, we observe zero-shot GPT3.5 to perform well on ACT2 but poorly on the ACL-ARC dataset.|引文分类旨在识别引文中被引文章的目的。以往的引文分类方法主要依赖于监督方法。这些模型在数据集上进行训练，引用的句子或引用上下文被注释为引用的目的、功能或意图。大语言模型(LLM)的最新进展极大地提高了自然语言处理(NLP)系统的能力，使其能够在零或少镜头设置下实现最先进的性能。这使得 LLM 特别适合于那些没有足够大标记的数据集的任务，这仍然是引文分类的情况。本文系统地研究了引文分类中不同激励策略的有效性，并将其与非激励策略进行了比较。具体来说，我们评估了以下四种策略，其中两种是我们首次引入的，它们涉及在训练语言模型时更新语言模型(LM)参数: (1)无提示微调，(2)固定提示 LM 微调，(3)动态上下文提示 LM 微调(建议) ，(4)提示 + LM 微调(建议)。此外，我们还测试了 LLM，GPT3.5，这是一种不需要参数更新的无调优提示策略。研究结果表明，基于 LM 参数更新的提示方法显著提高了特定领域和多学科引文分类的分类性能。此外，我们的动态上下文提示方法在 ACL-ARC 和 ACT2引文分类数据集中都获得了最高分，超过了3C 共享任务基准中表现最好的系统。有趣的是，我们观察到零射 GPT3.5在 ACT2上表现良好，但在 ACL-ARC 数据集上表现不佳。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Prompting+Strategies+for+Citation+Classification)|0|

Jensen, Kezhong Lu|Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark; Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China|Attributed graph clustering aims to partition the nodes in a graph into groups such that the nodes in the same group are close in terms of graph proximity and also have similar attribute values. Recently, deep learning methods have achieved state-of-the-art clustering performance. However, the effectiveness of existing methods remains unclear due to two reasons. First, the datasets used for evaluation do not support fully the goal of attributed graph clustering. The category labels of nodes are only relevant to node attributes, and nodes with the same category label are often distant in the graph. Second, existing methods for the attributed graph clustering are complex and consist of several components. There is lack of comparisons of methods composed of different components from existing methods. This study proposes six benchmark datasets that support better the goal of attributed graph clustering and reports the performance of existing representative methods. Given that existing methods leave room for improvement on the proposed benchmark datasets, we systematically analyze five aspects of existing methods: encoded information, training networks, fusion mechanisms, loss functions, and clustering result generation. Based on these aspects, we decompose existing methods into modules and evaluate the performance of reconfigured methods based on these modules. According to the experimental results on the proposed benchmark datasets, we identify two promising configurations: (i) taking the attribute matrix as input to a graph convolutional network and (ii) layer-wise linear fusing deep neural network and graph attention network. And we also find that complex loss function fails to improve the clustering performance.|属性图聚类的目的是将一个图中的节点划分为若干组，使得同一组中的节点在图的邻近性方面相近，并且具有相似的属性值。近年来，深度学习方法取得了一流的聚类性能。然而，由于两个原因，现有方法的有效性仍不清楚。首先，用于评估的数据集不完全支持属性图聚类的目标。节点的类别标签只与节点属性相关，具有相同类别标签的节点在图中往往相距较远。其次，现有的属性图聚类方法是复杂的，由多个部分组成。由现有方法的不同组件组成的方法缺乏比较。本研究提出了六个基准数据集，更好地支持属性图聚类的目标，并报告了现有的代表性方法的性能。鉴于现有的方法在基准数据集上还有改进的空间，我们系统地分析了现有方法的五个方面: 编码信息、训练网络、融合机制、损失函数和聚类结果生成。基于这些方面，我们将现有的方法分解为模块，并对基于这些模块的重新配置方法的性能进行评估。根据基准数据集的实验结果，我们确定了两种有前景的构型: (i)将属性矩阵作为图卷积网络的输入; (ii)分层线性融合深度神经网络和图注意网络。同时发现复杂损失函数不能提高聚类性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=A+Re-evaluation+of+Deep+Learning+Methods+for+Attributed+Graph+Clustering)|0|

When working with large datasets, the imbalanced issue can be further exacerbated, making it exceptionally difficult to train classifiers effectively. To address the problem, over-sampling techniques have been developed to linearly interpolating data instances between minorities and their neighbors. However, in many real-world scenarios such as anomaly detection, minority instances are often dispersed diversely in the feature space rather than clustered together. Inspired by domain-agnostic data mix-up, we propose generating synthetic samples iteratively by mixing data samples from both minority and majority classes. It is non-trivial to develop such a framework, the challenges include source sample selection, mix-up strategy selection, and the coordination between the underlying model and mix-up strategies. To tackle these challenges, we formulate the problem of iterative data mix-up as a Markov decision process (MDP) that maps data attributes onto an augmentation strategy. To solve the MDP, we employ an actor-critic framework to adapt the discrete-continuous decision space. This framework is utilized to train a data augmentation policy and design a reward signal that explores classifier uncertainty and encourages performance improvement, irrespective of the classifier's convergence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework through extensive experiments conducted on seven publicly available benchmark datasets using three different types of classifiers.

|[DuoGAT: Dual Time-oriented Graph Attention Networks for Accurate, Efficient and Explainable Anomaly Detection on Time-series](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614857)|Jongsoo Lee, Byeongtae Park, DongKyu Chae|Hanyang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea|Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance on the multivariate time-series anomaly detection task by learning relationships between variables (sensors). However, they show limitations in capturing temporal dependencies due to lack of sufficient consideration on the characteristics of time to their graph structure. Several studies constructed a time-oriented graph, where each node represents a timestamp within a certain sliding window, to model temporal dependencies, but they failed to learn the trend of changes in time-series. This paper proposes Dual time-oriented Graph ATtention networks (DuoGAT) that resolves the aforementioned problems. Unlike previous work that uses the simple complete undirected structure for time-oriented graphs, our work models directed graphs with weighted edges that only connect from prior events to posterior events, and the edges that connect nearby events are given higher weights. In addition, another time-oriented graph is used to model time series stationary via differencing, which especially focuses on capturing the series of changes. Empirically, our method outperformed the existing state-of-the-art work with the highest F1-score for the four real-world dataset while maintaining low training cost. We also proposed a novel explanation method for anomaly detection using DuoGAT, which provides time-oriented reasoning via hierarchically tracking time points critical in a specific anomaly detection. Our code is available at: https://github.com/ByeongtaePark/DuoGAT|最近，图形神经网络(GNN)通过学习变量(传感器)之间的关系，在多变量时间序列异常检测任务中取得了最先进的性能。然而，由于缺乏对图结构时间特性的充分考虑，它们在捕获时间依赖性方面存在局限性。一些研究构建了一个面向时间的图表，其中每个节点代表一个特定滑动窗口中的时间戳，以模拟时间依赖，但他们未能了解时间序列的变化趋势。针对上述问题，本文提出了面向双时间的图注意网络(DuoGAT)。不同于以往的工作，使用简单的完全无向结构的时间导向图，我们的工作模型指导图的加权边，只连接从先前的事件到后续事件，并连接附近的事件的边被赋予更高的权重。此外，还利用另一种时间导向图通过差分方法对时间序列进行建模，重点捕捉时间序列的变化。经验上，我们的方法在保持低训练成本的同时，以四个真实世界数据集的最高 F1分数超过了现有的最先进的工作。我们还提出了一种使用 DuogAT 的新颖的异常检测解释方法，该方法通过分层跟踪特定异常检测中关键的时间点，提供面向时间的推理。我们的代码可以在以下 https://github.com/byeongtaepark/duogat 找到|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=DuoGAT:+Dual+Time-oriented+Graph+Attention+Networks+for+Accurate,+Efficient+and+Explainable+Anomaly+Detection+on+Time-series)|0|

To mitigate such a threat, considerable research efforts have been devoted to increasing the robustness of GCNs against adversarial attacks. However, current approaches for defense are typically designed for the whole graph and consider the global performance, posing challenges in protecting important local nodes from stronger adversarial targeted attacks. In this work, we present a simple yet effective method, named \textbf{\underline{G}}raph \textbf{\underline{U}}niversal \textbf{\underline{A}}dve\textbf{\underline{R}}sarial \textbf{\underline{D}}efense (GUARD). Unlike previous works, GUARD protects each individual node from attacks with a universal defensive patch, which is generated once and can be applied to any node (node-agnostic) in a graph. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves robustness for several established GCNs against multiple adversarial attacks and outperforms existing adversarial defense methods by large margins.

|[Class-Specific Word Sense Aware Topic Modeling via Soft Orthogonalized Topics](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614809)|Wenbo Li, Yao Yang, Einoshin Suzuki|Zhejiang Laboratory, Hangzhou, China; Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan|We propose a word sense aware topic model for document classification based on soft orthogonalized topics. An essential problem for this task is to capture word senses related to classes, i.e., class-specific word senses. Traditional models mainly introduce semantic information of knowledge libraries for word sense discovery. However, this information may not align with the classification targets, because these targets are often subjective and task-related. We aim to model the class-specific word senses in topic space. The challenge is to optimize the class separability of the senses, i.e., obtaining sense vectors with (a) high intra-class and (b) low inter-class similarities. Most existing models predefine specific topics for each class to specify the class-specific sense vectors. We call them hard orthogonalization based methods. These methods can hardly achieve both (a) and (b) since they assume the conditional independence of topics to classes and inevitably lose topic information. To this problem, we propose soft orthogonalization for topics. Specifically, we reserve all the topics and introduce a group of class-specific weights for each word to handle the importance of topic dimensions to class separability. Besides, we detect and use highly class-specific words in each document to guide sense estimation. Our experiments on two standard datasets show that our proposal outperforms other state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy of sense estimation, document classification, and topic modeling. In addition, our joint learning experiments with the pre-trained language model BERT showcased the best complementarity of our model in most cases compared to other topic models.|我们提出了一个基于软正交主题的词义感知主题文档分类模型。这个任务的一个基本问题是捕获与类相关的词义，也就是特定于类的词义。传统的模式主要是引入语义信息知识库来发现词义。但是，这些信息可能与分类目标不一致，因为这些目标通常是主观的和与任务相关的。我们的目标是在主题空间中建立类别特定的词义模型。挑战在于优化感官的类可分性，即获得具有(a)高的类内和(b)低的类间相似性的感官向量。大多数现有的模型为每个类预先定义特定的主题，以指定特定于类的感觉向量。我们称之为基于正交化的方法。这些方法很难同时实现(a)和(b)两个目标，因为它们承担了课程的主题条件独立，并且不可避免地丢失了主题信息。针对这个问题，我们建议对话题采用软正交化。具体来说，我们保留所有的主题，并为每个单词引入一组特定于类别的权重，以处理主题维度对类别可分性的重要性。此外，我们在每个文档中检测并使用高度类别特异性的词语来指导意义估计。我们在两个标准数据集上的实验表明，我们的方案在感觉估计、文档分类和主题建模的准确性方面优于其他最先进的模型。此外，我们的联合学习实验与预先训练的语言模型 BERT 显示了我们的模型在大多数情况下最好的互补性相比，其他主题模型。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Class-Specific+Word+Sense+Aware+Topic+Modeling+via+Soft+Orthogonalized+Topics)|0|

Firstly, we devise a visual-textual relation-aware module that aligns the visual and textual representations across modalities, thereby enhancing the layout's efficacy in conveying textual information. Subsequently, we propose a geometry relation-aware module that learns the geometry relationship between elements by comprehensively considering contextual information.

To address this challenge and enable reliable decision-making, many GNN explainers have been proposed in recent years. However, these methods often encounter limitations, including their dependence on specific instances, lack of generalizability to unseen graphs, producing potentially invalid explanations, and yielding inadequate fidelity. To overcome these limitations, we, in this paper, introduce the Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network (ACGAN) into the field of GNN explanation and propose a new GNN explainer dubbed~\emph{ACGAN-GNNExplainer}.

Recently, many deep learning based methods have been proposed to learn from drug-related features and conduct DDI prediction. These works have achieved promising results. However, the extreme imbalance of medical data poses a serious problem to DDI prediction, where a small fraction of DDI types occupy the majority training data. A straightforward way is to develop an appropriate policy to sample the data. Due to the high complexity and speciality of medical science, a dynamic learnable policy is required instead of a heuristic, uniform or static one. Therefore, we propose a REinforced Student-Teacher curriculum learning model (REST) for effective sampling to tackle this imbalance problem. Specifically, REST consists of two interactive parts, which are a heterogeneous graph neural network as the student and a reinforced sampler as the teacher. In each interaction, the teacher model takes action to sample an appropriate batch to train the student model according to the student model state while the cumulated improvement in performance of the student model is treated as the reward for policy gradient of the teacher model. The experimental results on two benchmarking datasets have demonstrated the significant effectiveness of our proposed model in DDI prediction, especially for the DDI types with low frequency.|准确预测药物相互作用(DDI)是实现医患双方有效决策的关键。近年来，人们提出了许多基于深度学习的方法来学习药物相关特征并进行 DDI 预测。这些工作取得了可喜的成果。然而，医学数据的极端不平衡性给 DDI 预测带来了严重的问题，其中一小部分 DDI 类型占据了大多数训练数据。一个直接的方法是开发一个适当的策略来抽样数据。由于医学科学的高度复杂性和特殊性，需要一个动态的可学习策略，而不是一个启发式的、统一的或静态的策略。因此，我们提出了一个强化的学生-教师课程学习模式(REST) ，以有效的抽样来解决这一不平衡问题。具体来说，REST 由两个交互部分组成，即作为学生的异构图形神经网络和作为教师的强化采样器。在每个交互过程中，教师模型根据学生模型的状态采取行动抽样适当的批次来训练学生模型，而学生模型的绩效的累积提高被视为对教师模型的政策梯度的奖励。在两个基准测试数据集上的实验结果表明，该模型在 DDI 预测中具有显著的效果，特别是对于低频率的 DDI 类型。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=REST:+Drug-Drug+Interaction+Prediction+via+Reinforced+Student-Teacher+Curriculum+Learning)|0|

Here, we conduct comprehensive examinations and propose STHN, a simplifying THN for continuous-time link prediction. Concretely, to integrate continuous dynamics, we maintain a historical interaction memory for each node. A link encoder that incorporates two components - type encoding and relative time encoding - is introduced to encapsulate implicit heterogeneous characteristics of interaction and extract the most informative temporal information.

But the need for diagnosis and reporting from image-based examinations far excels the current medical capacity. Automatic Medical Report Generation (MRG) can help to ease the burden of radiologists. Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) has received tremendous success on various tasks, therefore it is naturally expected that MRG can harvest from this rapid advancement. However, directly applying existing VLP models in the medical domain is impracticable due to their data-hungry nature, the need for aligning different modalities, prohibitive training time, exorbitant hardware barrier, and the challenge of open-ended text generation. To address these problems, we propose MedEPT, a parameter-efficient approach for MRG that can utilize ever-ignored image-only datasets. It employs parameter-efficient tuning (PET) for VLP adaption to mitigate inefficiency in fine-tuning time and hardware. MedEPT also employs MRGPID to augment and expand adaption datasets by synthesizing meaningful text for image-only datasets. We perform a systematic evaluation of our method.

|[Adaptation Speed Analysis for Fairness-aware Causal Models](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614774)|Yujie Lin, Chen Zhao, Minglai Shao, Xujiang Zhao, Haifeng Chen||For example, in machine translation tasks, to achieve bidirectional translation between two languages, the source corpus is often used as the target corpus, which involves the training of two models with opposite directions. The question of which one can adapt most quickly to a domain shift is of significant importance in many fields. Specifically, consider an original distribution p that changes due to an unknown intervention, resulting in a modified distribution p*. In aligning p with p*, several factors can affect the adaptation rate, including the causal dependencies between variables in p. In real-life scenarios, however, we have to consider the fairness of the training process, and it is particularly crucial to involve a sensitive variable (bias) present between a cause and an effect variable. To explore this scenario, we examine a simple structural causal model (SCM) with a cause-bias-effect structure, where variable A acts as a sensitive variable between cause (X) and effect (Y). The two models, respectively, exhibit consistent and contrary cause-effect directions in the cause-bias-effect SCM.

|[On the Thresholding Strategy for Infrequent Labels in Multi-label Classification](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614996)|YuJen Lin, ChihJen Lin|National Taiwan University & Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence, Taipei, Taiwan Roc; National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan Roc|In multi-label classification, the imbalance between labels is often a concern. For a label that seldom occurs, the default threshold used to generate binarized predictions of that label is usually sub-optimal. However, directly tuning the threshold to optimize F-measure has been observed to overfit easily. In this work, we explain why this overfitting occurs. Then, we analyze the FBR heuristic, a previous technique proposed to address the overfitting issue. We explain its success but also point out some problems unobserved before. Then, we first propose a variant of the FBR heuristic that not only fixes the problems but is also more justifiable. Second, we propose a new technique based on smoothing the F-measure when tuning the threshold. We theoretically prove that, with proper parameters, smoothing results in desirable properties of the tuned threshold. Based on the idea of smoothing, we then propose jointly optimizing micro-F and macro-F as a lightweight alternative free from extra hyperparameters. Our methods are empirically evaluated on text and node classification datasets. The results show that our methods consistently outperform the FBR heuristic.|在多标签分类中，标签之间的不平衡往往是一个值得关注的问题。对于很少出现的标签，用于生成该标签的二进制预测的默认阈值通常是次优的。然而，直接调整阈值以优化 F 测度已被观察到很容易过拟合。在这项工作中，我们解释了为什么会发生这种过拟合。然后，我们分析了 FBR 启发式算法，这是一种先前提出的解决过拟合问题的技术。我们解释了它的成功，但也指出了一些以前没有注意到的问题。然后，我们首先提出了 FBR 启发式的一个变体，它不仅解决了问题，而且更加合理。其次，提出了一种基于平滑 F- 测度的阈值调整新方法。我们从理论上证明，在适当的参数下，光滑化可以得到理想的调谐阈值特性。基于平滑的思想，我们提出联合优化微 F 和宏 F 作为一个轻量级的替代方案，不需要额外的超参数。在文本和节点分类数据集上对我们的方法进行了实证评估。结果表明，我们的方法始终优于 FBR 启发式。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=On+the+Thresholding+Strategy+for+Infrequent+Labels+in+Multi-label+Classification)|0|

Utilizing deep models to tackle this task relies heavily on data from traffic sensors or vehicle devices, while some cities might lack device support and thus have few available data. So, it is necessary to learn from data-rich cities and transfer the knowledge to data-scarce cities in order to improve the performance of traffic forecasting. To address this problem, we propose a cross-city few-shot traffic forecasting framework via Traffic Pattern Bank (TPB) due to that the traffic patterns are similar across cities. TPB utilizes a pre-trained traffic patch encoder to project raw traffic data from data-rich cities into high-dimensional space, from which a traffic pattern bank is generated through clustering. Then, the traffic data of the data-scarce city could query the traffic pattern bank and explicit relations between them are constructed. The metaknowledge is aggregated based on these relations and an adjacency matrix is constructed to guide a downstream spatial-temporal model in forecasting future traffic. The frequently used meta-training framework Reptile is adapted to find a better initial parameter for the learnable modules. Experiments on real-world traffic datasets show that TPB outperforms existing methods and demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in cross-city few-shot traffic forecasting.|交通预测是智能交通系统(ITS)中的一项重要业务。利用深度模型来解决这个问题主要依赖于来自交通传感器或车辆设备的数据，而一些城市可能缺乏设备支持，因此可用的数据很少。因此，有必要向数据丰富的城市学习，向数据稀缺的城市转移知识，以提高交通预测的性能。针对这一问题，针对城市间交通模式相似的特点，提出了一种基于交通模式库(TPB)的跨城市少镜头交通预测框架。TPB 利用预先训练好的交通补丁编码器将数据丰富的城市的原始交通数据投影到高维空间中，通过聚类生成交通模式库。然后，利用数据稀缺城市的交通数据对交通模式库进行查询，建立二者之间的显式关系。基于这些关系，元知识被聚合起来，并构建一个邻接矩阵来指导下游的时空模型来预测未来的交通。为了给可学习模块提供一个更好的初始参数，对经常使用的元训练框架爬行动物进行了改进。在实际交通数据集上的实验结果表明，TPB 方法的性能优于现有的方法，并证明了该方法在城市间少镜头交通预测中的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Cross-city+Few-Shot+Traffic+Forecasting+via+Traffic+Pattern+Bank)|0|

By formulating the problem of interest into a two-sample test on the binomial proportions from the control group (p_0) and the treatment group (p_1), Brand Lift test evaluates ads impact based on the statistical significance of test results. Traditional approaches construct the test statistics based on the absolute difference between the two observed proportions, a.k.a, absolute lift. In this work, we propose a new bootstrap test based on the percentage difference between the two observed proportions, i.e., relative lift. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees on the asymptotic validity of the proposed relative-lift-based test. Our numerical studies suggest that the relative-lift-based test requires less stringent conditions than the absolute-lift-based test for controlling the type-I error rate. Interestingly, we also prove that the relative-lift-based test is more powerful than the absolute-lift-based test when the alternative is positive (i.e., p1 - p0 > 0), but less powerful when the alternative is negative (i.e., p1 - p0 < 0). The empirical performance of the proposed test is demonstrated by extensive simulation studies, an application to a publicly available A/B testing dataset from advertising, and real datasets collected from the Brand Lift Testing platform at LinkedIn.|品牌提升测试(Brand Lift test)是一种广泛应用的统计工具，用于测量在线广告对品牌认知的有效性，如广告回忆、品牌熟悉度和好感度。通过对对照组(p _ 0)和治疗组(p _ 1)的二项式比例的双样本检验，Brand Lift 检验基于检验结果的统计显著性来评估广告的影响。传统的方法建立测试统计基于两个观察比例之间的绝对差异，即绝对提升。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个新的自举测试基于两个观察比例之间的百分比差异，即相对提升。我们提供了严格的理论保证，渐近有效的相对提升为基础的检验。我们的数值研究表明，为了控制 I 型错误率，基于相对升力的测试比基于绝对升力的测试要求的条件要宽松。有趣的是，我们还证明，当替代方案为阳性(即 p1-p0 > 0)时，基于相对提升的测试比基于绝对提升的测试更强大，但是当替代方案为阴性(即 p1-p0 < 0)时则不那么强大。广泛的模拟研究，广告中公开的 A/B 测试数据集的应用，以及从 LinkedIn 的 Brand Lift 测试平台收集的真实数据集，都证明了该测试的经验性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Quantifying+the+Effectiveness+of+Advertising:+A+Bootstrap+Proportion+Test+for+Brand+Lift+Testing)|0|

However, the lack of labeled large-scale database and the scarcity of task-specific label sets pose significant challenges. To address these problems, we propose an innovative unsupervised neural network approach called BRep-BERT, which extends the concept of BERT to the B-Rep domain. Specifically, we utilize Graph Neural Network (GNN) Tokenizer to generate discrete entity labels with geometric and structural semantic information. We construct new entity representation sequences based on the structural relationships and pre-train the model through the Masked Entity Modeling (MEM) task. To address the attention sparsity issue in large-scale geometric models, we incorporate graph structure information and learnable relative position encoding into the attention module to optimize feature updates. Additionally, we employ geometric sub-graphs and multi-level contrastive learning techniques to enhance the model's ability to learn regional features. Comparisons with previous methods demonstrate that BRep-BERT achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both full-data training and few-shot learning tasks across multiple B-Rep datasets. Particularly, BRep-BERT outperforms previous methods significantly in the few-shot learning scenarios. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the substantial advantages and potential of BRep-BERT in handling B-Rep data representation.

Even though current dialogue studies predominantly strive to generate natural texts or images, they fall short in considering the relevance of multimodal responses within a dialogue context, consequently confining agents from making prudent choices based on multiple alternatives and their associated relevance scores for decision-making. In this paper, we present a bidirectional multimodal dialogue framework that skillfully combines the forward generation of multiple text and image response candidates with reverse selection guided by relevance scores evaluated on dialogue context, facilitating agents in selecting the most suitable multimodal responses. Specifically, the forward generation aspect of our framework leverages a stage-wise approach, first producing textual replies and composite visual descriptions from the dialogue context, followed by the generation of visual responses aligned with the descriptions. In the reverse selection process, visual responses are translated into tangible descriptive texts that, in conjunction with textual responses, are inversely tied back to the dialogue context for relevance assessment, assigning a reference score to each multimodal response candidate to assist the intelligent agent in making informed decisions. Experimental outcomes demonstrate that our proposed bidirectional dialogue response framework markedly elevates performance in both automatic and human evaluations, yielding a range of contextually fitting multimodal responses for selection.|多模式对话代理经常需要使用文本和视觉内容来响应会话历史。尽管目前的对话研究主要致力于产生自然的文本或图像，但它们在对话背景下考虑多式联运反应的相关性方面存在不足，从而限制了行为体根据多种备选方案及其相关的决策相关性得分作出谨慎的选择。本文提出了一个双向多模式对话框架，该框架巧妙地将多个文本和图像响应候选者的前向生成与在对话背景下评估的相关性分数指导下的反向选择相结合，促进代理人选择最合适的多模式响应。具体来说，我们框架的前向生成方面采用了分阶段的方法，首先从对话上下文生成文本回复和组合视觉描述，然后生成与描述相一致的视觉回复。在反向选择过程中，视觉反应被转化为有形的描述性文本，与文字反应一起，与相关性评估的对话背景成反比，为每个多式联运反应候选人指定一个参考评分，以协助智能代理人作出知情决定。实验结果表明，我们提出的双向对话响应框架显着提高了自动和人工评估的绩效，产生了一系列符合上下文的多模式选择响应。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Forward+Creation,+Reverse+Selection:+Achieving+Highly+Pertinent+Multimodal+Responses+in+Dialogue+Contexts)|0|

In PGAD, a text diffusion model is designed to generate diverse context-aware prompt representations in conjunction with a series of random Gaussian noise. Firstly, cross-attention is employed between the designed prompt and input context within the text diffusion model in order to generate the context-aware prompt. Through this interaction, the context-aware prompt is able to capture multiple role-specific argument span queriers. Secondly, the context-aware prompt is aligned with the context to generate event arguments by joint optimization.

One of the mainstream approaches for graph representation learning is the hierarchical pooling method. It learns the graph representation by gradually reducing the scale of the graph, so it can be easily adapted to large-scale graphs. However, existing graph pooling methods discard the original graph structure during downsizing the graph, resulting in a lack of graph topological structure. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale graph neural network (MSGNN) model that not only retains the topological information of the graph but also maintains the key-subgraph for better interpretability. MSGNN gradually discards the unimportant nodes and retains the important subgraph structure during the iteration. The key subgraphs are first chosen by experience and then adaptively evolved to tailor specific graph structures for downstream tasks. The extensive experiments on seven datasets show that MSGNN improves the SOTA performance on graph classification and better retains key subgraphs.|图表示学习的最新进展促进了许多图分类任务的发展，如蛋白质分类和社会网络分类。图表示学习的主流方法之一是层次化池方法。它通过逐渐缩小图的尺度来学习图的表示，因此可以很容易地适应大尺度的图。然而，现有的图池方法在缩小图的尺寸时会丢弃原有的图结构，从而导致图拓扑结构的缺失。本文提出了一种多尺度图神经网络(MSGNN)模型，该模型不仅保留了图的拓扑信息，而且保留了关键子图，从而提高了图的可解释性。在迭代过程中，MSGNN 逐渐丢弃不重要的节点，保留重要的子图结构。首先根据经验选择关键子图，然后自适应地进化，为下游任务裁剪特定的图结构。通过对7个数据集的大量实验表明，MSGNN 提高了 SOTA 在图分类方面的性能，并且能够更好地保留关键子图。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Multi-scale+Graph+Pooling+Approach+with+Adaptive+Key+Subgraph+for+Graph+Representations)|0|

In the context of spatio-temporal prediction, the key lies in how to model the dependencies of sensors. However, existing works basically only consider the micro relationships between sensors, where the sensors are treated equally, and their macroscopic dependencies are neglected. In this paper, we argue to rethink the sensor's dependency modeling from two hierarchies: regional and global perspectives. Particularly, we merge original sensors with high intra-region correlation as a region node to preserve the inter-region dependency. Then, we generate representative and common spatio-temporal patterns as global nodes to reflect a global dependency between sensors and provide auxiliary information for spatio-temporal dependency learning. In pursuit of the generality and reality of node representations, we incorporate a Meta GCN to calibrate the regional and global nodes in the physical data space. Furthermore, we devise the cross-hierarchy graph convolution to propagate information from different hierarchies. In a nutshell, we propose a Hierarchical Information Enhanced Spatio-Temporal prediction method, HIEST, to create and utilize the regional dependency and common spatio-temporal patterns.

Utilizing polar decomposition allows the effective transformation of indefinite kernel matrices from Krein space to positive semi-definite matrices in Hilbert space, thereby providing an efficient out-of-sample extension for new unseen data and enhancing kernel method applicability across diverse classification tasks.

While single link prediction has been well studied in literature on deep graph learning, predicting multiple links together has gained little attention. This paper presents a novel framework for computing JLPQs using a probabilistic deep Graph Generative Model. Specifically, we develop inference procedures for an inductively trained Variational Graph Auto-Encoder (VGAE) that estimates the joint link probability for any input JLPQ, without retraining. For evaluation, we apply inference to a range of joint link prediction queries on six benchmark datasets. We find that for most datasets and query types, joint link prediction via inference from a model achieves good predictive performance, better than the independent link prediction baselines (by 0.02-0.4 AUC points depending on the dataset).|联合链接预测查询(JLPQ)指定一组要预测的链接，给定另一组链接以及节点属性作为证据。在深度图学习的文献中，单链接预测已经得到了很好的研究，但是多链接一起预测却很少受到关注。本文提出了一个使用概率深度图生成模型计算 JLPQs 的新框架。具体来说，我们开发了一个归纳训练的变分图自动编码器(VGAE)的推理程序，估计任何输入 JLPQ 的联合链接概率，没有再训练。为了进行评估，我们对六个基准数据集上的一系列联合链接预测查询进行了推断。我们发现，对于大多数数据集和查询类型，通过模型推断的联合链接预测实现了良好的预测性能，优于独立链接预测基线(根据数据集的不同，增加0.02 -0.4 AUC 点)。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Joint+Link+Prediction+Via+Inference+from+a+Model)|0|

The discrete features of a tabular dataset represent high-level meaningful concepts, with different sets of vocabularies, leading to requiring non-uniform robustness. Further, the notion of distance between tabular input instances is not well defined, making the problem of producing adversarial examples with minor perturbations qualitatively more challenging compared to existing methods. Towards this, our paper defines the notion of distance through the lens of feature embeddings, learnt to represent the discrete features. We then formulate the task of generating adversarial examples as abinary set selection problem under non-uniform feature importance. Next, we propose an efficient approximate gradient-descent based algorithm, calledDiscrete Non-uniform Approximation (DNA) attack, by reformulating the problem into a continuous domain to solve the original optimization problem for generating adversarial examples. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DNA attack using two large real-world discrete tabular datasets from e-commerce domains for binary classification, where the datasets are heavily biased for one-class.

Ness, Dusica Marijan, Sunanda Bose|Simula Research Laboratory, Oslo, Norway|Causal Neural Network models have shown high levels of robustness to adversarial attacks as well as an increased capacity for generalisation tasks such as few-shot learning and rare-context classification compared to traditional Neural Networks. This robustness is argued to stem from the disentanglement of causal and confounder input signals. However, no quantitative study has yet measured the level of disentanglement achieved by these types of causal models or assessed how this relates to their adversarial robustness. Existing causal disentanglement metrics are not applicable to deterministic models trained on real-world datasets. We, therefore, utilise metrics of content/style disentanglement from the field of Computer Vision to measure different aspects of the causal disentanglement for four state-of-the-art causal Neural Network models. By re-implementing these models with a common ResNet18 architecture we are able to fairly measure their adversarial robustness on three standard image classification benchmarking datasets under seven common white-box attacks. We find a strong association (r=0.820, p=0.001) between the degree to which models decorrelate causal and confounder signals and their adversarial robustness. Additionally, we find a moderate negative association between the pixel-level information content of the confounder signal and adversarial robustness (r=-0.597, p=0.040).|与传统神经网络相比，因果神经网络模型显示了对敌对攻击的高水平鲁棒性，以及对概括性任务(如少镜头学习和罕见背景分类)的增强能力。这种稳健性被认为源于因果和混杂输入信号的分离。然而，还没有定量研究测量这些类型的因果模型所达到的解纠缠水平，或评估这与它们的对抗稳健性的关系。现有的因果解缠度量不适用于在真实世界数据集上训练的确定性模型。因此，我们利用计算机视觉领域的内容/风格脱离度量来衡量四个最先进的因果神经网络模型的因果脱离的不同方面。通过使用一个通用的 ResNet18架构重新实现这些模型，我们能够在七种常见的白盒攻击下，在三种标准图像分类基准数据集上公平地测量它们的对抗鲁棒性。我们发现在模型去除因果信号和混杂信号的程度与它们的对抗稳健性之间有很强的相关性(r = 0.820，p = 0.001)。此外，我们发现混杂信号的像素级信息含量与对抗鲁棒性之间存在中度负相关(r = -0.597，p = 0.040)。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Measuring+the+Effect+of+Causal+Disentanglement+on+the+Adversarial+Robustness+of+Neural+Network+Models)|0|

This expensive activity motivated much work in developing methods for constructing benchmarks with fewer assessment costs. In this respect, adjudication methods actively decide both which documents and the order in which experts review them, in order to better exploit the assessment budget or to lower it. Researchers evaluate the quality of those methods by measuring the correlation between the known gold ranking of systems under the full collection and the observed ranking of systems under the lower-cost one. This traditional analysis ignores whether and how the low-cost judgements impact on the statistically significant differences among systems with respect to the full collection. We fill this void by proposing a novel methodology to evaluate how the low-cost adjudication methods preserve the pairwise significant differences between systems as the full collection. In other terms, while traditional approaches look for stability in answering the question "is system A better than system B?", our proposed approach looks for stability in answering the question "is system A significantly better than system B?", which is the ultimate questions researchers need to answer to guarantee the generalisability of their results.

Within this paper, we propose a supervised approach to learn a reweighted confidence value for each rule to get an optimal explanation for the training set given a specific aggregation function. In particular, we apply our approach to two aggregation functions: We learn weights for a noisy-or multiplication and apply logistic regression, which computes the score of a prediction as a sum of these weights.

The main difficulty in diffusion prediction problem is to effectively model the complex social factors in social networks and diffusion cascades. However, existing methods are mainly based on Euclidean space, which cannot well preserve the underlying hierarchical structures that could better reflect the strength of user influence. Meanwhile, existing methods cannot accurately model the obvious asymmetric features of the diffusion process. To alleviate these limitations, we utilize rotation transformation in the hyperbolic to model complex diffusion patterns. The modulus of representations in the hyperbolic space could effectively describe the strength of the user's influence. Rotation transformations could represent a variety of complex asymmetric features. Further, rotation transformation could model various social factors without changing the strength of influence. In this paper, we propose a novel hyperbolic rotation representation model RotDiff for the diffusion prediction problem. Specifically, we first map each social user to a Lorentzian vector and use two groups of transformations to encode global social factors in the social graph and the diffusion graph. Then, we combine attention mechanism in the hyperbolic space with extra rotation transformations to capture local diffusion dependencies within a given cascade.

On the other hand, to boost the adaptability of the model to new classes, we employ class prototype augmentation (PA) to create virtual classes by combining current prototypes. Theoretically, we show that PA can promote the model's adaptation to new data and reduce the inconsistency of old prototypes in the embedding space, therefore further mitigate catastrophic forgetting.

However, recently HGNNs have been shown to have robustness weakness towards adversarial perturbations, which brings critical pitfalls for real applications, e.g. node classification and recommender systems. In particular, the transfer-based black-box attack is the most practical method to attack unknown models and poses a great threat to the reliability of HGNNs. In this work, we take the first step to explore the transferability of adversarial examples of HGNNs. Due to the overfitting of the source model, the adversarial perturbations generated by traditional methods usually exhibit unpromising transferability. To address this problem and boost adversarial transferability, we expect to seek common vulnerable directions of different models to attack. Inspired by the observation of the notable commonality of edge attention distribution between different HGNNs, we propose to guide the perturbation generation toward disrupting edge attention distribution. This edge attention-guided attack prioritizes the perturbation on edges that are more likely to be given common attention by different models, which benefits the transferability of adversarial perturbations. Finally, we develop two edge attention-guided attack methods towards heterogeneous relations tailored for HGNNs, called EA-FGSM and EA-PGD.

Existing methods for social network alignment primarily rely on alignment consistency, assuming that nodes with similar attributes and neighbors are more likely to be aligned. However, distributional discrepancies in node attributes and neighbors across different networks would bring biases in alignment consistency, leading to inferior alignment performance. To address this issue, we conduct a causal analysis of alignment consistency. Based on this analysis, we propose a novel model called CANA that uses causal inference approaches to mitigate biases and enhance social network alignment. Firstly, we disentangle observed node attributes into endogenous features and exogenous features with multi-task learning. Only endogenous features are retained to overcome node attribute discrepancies. To eliminate biases caused by neighbors discrepancies, we propose causal-aware attention mechanisms and integrate them in graph neural network to reweight contributions of different neighbors in alignment consistency comparison. Additionally, backdoor adjustment is applied to reduce confounding effects and estimate unbiased alignment probability.

These signed interactions happen in real-time. Modeling such dynamics of signed networks is crucial to understanding the evolution of polarization in the network and enabling effective prediction of the signed structure (i.e., link signs and signed weights) in the future. However, existing works have modeled either (static) signed networks or dynamic (unsigned) networks but not dynamic signed networks. Since both sign and dynamics inform the graph structure in different ways, it is non-trivial to model how to combine the two features. In this work, we propose a new Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approach to model dynamic signed networks, named SEMBA: Signed link's Evolution using Memory modules and Balanced Aggregation. Here, the idea is to incorporate the signs of temporal interactions using separate modules guided by balance theory and to evolve the embeddings from a higher-order neighborhood. Experiments on 4 real-world datasets and 4 different tasks demonstrate that SEMBA consistently and significantly outperforms the baselines by up to $80\%$ on the tasks of predicting signs of future links while matching the state-of-the-art performance on predicting the existence of these links in the future. We find that this improvement is due specifically to the superior performance of SEMBA on the minority negative class.|签名网络允许我们建立冲突的关系和互动，例如朋友/敌人和支持/反对。这些签名的交互实时发生。建立符号网络的动力学模型对于理解网络中极化的演化过程以及有效预测未来的符号结构(即链路符号和符号权重)是至关重要的。然而，现有的作品已经模拟了(静态)有符号网络或动态(无符号)网络，但没有动态有符号网络。由于符号和动力学都以不同的方式告知图形结构，因此建立如何结合这两个特征的模型是非常重要的。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个新的图神经网络(GNN)为基础的模型动态签名网络，称为 SEMBA: 签名链路的演化使用记忆模块和平衡聚合。在这里，我们的想法是使用平衡理论指导下的独立模块合并时间相互作用的标志，并从一个高阶邻域演化嵌入。在4个真实世界的数据集和4个不同的任务上的实验表明，SEMBA 在预测未来链接迹象的任务上持续而显著地优于基线80% ，同时在预测未来链接存在的任务上匹配最先进的表现。我们发现，这种改善主要是由于 SEMBA 在少数消极阶层中的卓越表现。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Representation+Learning+in+Continuous-Time+Dynamic+Signed+Networks)|0|

Nevertheless, conventional methods frequently fail to capture the nuances of aspect-level complaints and inadequately utilize external knowledge, thus creating a gap in effective complaint detection and analysis. In response to this issue, we proactively explore the role of external knowledge and multimodality in this domain. This leads to the development of MGasD (Multimodal Generative framework for aspect-based complaint and sentiment Detection), a multimodal knowledge-infused unified framework. MGasD diverges from traditional methods by reframing the complaint detection problem as a multimodal text-to-text generation task. Significantly, our research includes the development of a novel aspect-level dataset. Annotated for both complaint and sentiment categories across diverse domains such as books, electronics, edibles, fashion, and miscellaneous, this dataset provides a comprehensive platform for the concurrent study of complaints and sentiment. This resource facilitates a more robust understanding of consumer feedback. Our proposed methodology establishes a benchmark performance in the novel aspect-based complaint and sentiment detection tasks based on extensive evaluation. We also demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms all other baselines and state-of-the-art models in both full and few-shot settings (The dataset and code are available at:https://github.com/appy1608/CIKM2023).|自动化的投诉分析对于产生关键见解至关重要，这反过来又能提高客户满意度、产品质量和整体业务表现。然而，传统方法往往无法捕捉方面一级投诉的细微差别，也不能充分利用外部知识，从而在有效的投诉侦测和分析方面造成空白。针对这一问题，我们积极探索外部知识和多模态在这一领域的作用。这导致了 MGasD (用于基于方面的投诉和情绪检测的多模态生成框架)的开发，这是一个基于多模态知识的统一框架。MGasD 将抱怨检测问题重新定义为一个多模态的文本到文本生成任务，从而背离了传统的方法。值得注意的是，我们的研究包括开发一个新的方面级别的数据集。该数据集涵盖了书籍、电子产品、食品、时尚和杂项等不同领域的抱怨和情绪类别，为同时研究抱怨和情绪提供了一个全面的平台。这种资源有助于更好地理解消费者的反馈。我们提出的方法建立了一个新的基于方面的投诉和情绪检测任务的基准性能的广泛评估的基础上。我们还展示了我们的模型在完整和少量的设置中始终优于所有其他基线和最先进的模型(数据集和代码可在以下 https://github.com/appy1608/cikm2023获得)。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Investigating+the+Impact+of+Multimodality+and+External+Knowledge+in+Aspect-level+Complaint+and+Sentiment+Analysis)|0|

Models trained on historical data often struggle to adapt to the latest market styles, as the patterns they have learned may no longer hold true over time. To alleviate this issue, the recently popularized concept of In-Context learning has provided us with valuable insights. In this approach, large language models (LLMs) are exposed to multiple examples of input-label pairs, also known as demonstrations, as part of the prompt before performing a task on an unseen example. By thoroughly analyzing these demonstrations, LLMs can uncover potential patterns and effectively adapt to new tasks. Building upon this concept, we propose a Context-Informed drift-aware method for Stock Prediction (CISP), which continually adjusts to the latest market styles and offers more accurate predictions. Our proposed method consists of two key parts. Firstly, we introduce a straightforward and efficient technique for designing demonstrations that aggregate current market information, thereby indicating the prevailing stock market style. Secondly, we incorporate a prediction module with dynamic parameters, allowing it to appropriately adjust its model parameters based on the market patterns embedded in the aforementioned demonstrations.

Recent works in the general machine learning domain can promote group fairness for predictions on static tabular data, but their direct application in finance often proves ineffective. Financial losses of banks may arise from inaccurate predictions due to the overlooked dynamic nature of data, and illegal discrimination against some individual clients could still occur since fairness is promoted on the subgroup level. Therefore, we model the data as a dynamic or temporal transaction network for better utility and investigate individual fairness on this dynamic graph for the loan approval task. We define two novel individual fairness properties on temporal graphs with a theoretical analysis of their respective regret. Using these notions, we design a temporally fair graph neural network (TF-GNN) approach under a new real-time evaluation scheme for dynamic transaction networks.

However, social media users often express themselves briefly and implicitly, which leads to a significant number of comments lacking explicit reference information to the target, posing a challenge for stance detection. To address the missing relationship between text and target, existing studies primarily focus on incorporating external knowledge, which inevitably introduces noise information. In contrast to their work, we are dedicated to mining implicit relational information within data. Typically, users tend to emphasize their attitudes towards a relevant topic or aspect of the target while concealing others when expressing opinions. Motivated by this phenomenon, we suggest that the potential correlation between text and target can be learned from instances with similar topics. Therefore, we design a pretext task to mine the topic associations between samples and model this topic association as a dynamic weight introduced into contrastive learning. In this way, we can selectively cluster samples that have similar topics and consistent stances, while enlarging the gap between samples with different stances in the feature space. Additionally, we propose a nearest-neighbor prediction mechanism for stance classification to better utilize the features we constructed.

While fairness ensures that the model's predictions are unbiased and do not discriminate against any particular group, utility focuses on maximizing the accuracy of the model's predictions. Our aim is to investigate the relationship between uncertainty and fairness. Our approach leverages this concept by employing Bayesian learning to estimate the uncertainty in sample predictions where the estimation is independent of confounding effects related to the protected attribute. Through empirical evidence, we show that samples with low classification uncertainty are modeled more accurately and fairly than those with high uncertainty, which may have biased representations and higher prediction errors. To address the challenge of balancing fairness and utility, we propose a novel fairness-utility objective that is defined based on uncertainty quantification. The weights in this objective are determined by the level of uncertainty, allowing us to optimize both fairness and utility simultaneously. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of the fairness-utility tradeoff and this applies to both group and individual fairness metrics. This work presents a fresh perspective on the trade-off between accuracy and fairness in machine learning and highlights the potential of using uncertainty as a means to achieve optimal fairness and utility.|针对机器学习分类任务中公平性和效用性这两个经常相互竞争的目标，提出了一种独特的解决方案。虽然公平性确保模型的预测是无偏见的，不歧视任何特定的群体，效用的重点是最大限度地提高模型的预测的准确性。我们的目的是研究不确定性和公平性之间的关系。我们的方法利用这个概念，通过使用贝叶斯学习来估计样本预测中的不确定性，其中估计独立于与受保护属性相关的混杂效应。通过经验证明分析，我们发现分类不确定性低的样本比不确定性高的样本建模更加准确和公平，因为不确定性高的样本可能有偏差表示和更高的预测误差。为了解决平衡公平与效用的难题，我们提出了一种新的基于不确定性量化的公平效用目标。该目标中的权重由不确定性水平决定，使我们能够同时优化公平性和效用。在实际数据集上的实验证明了该方法的有效性。我们的结果表明，我们的方法在公平-效用权衡方面优于最先进的方法，这适用于群体和个人的公平度量。这项工作提出了一个新的视角之间的权衡准确性和公平的机器学习，并强调了潜在的使用不确定性作为一种手段，以实现最佳的公平性和效用。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Fairness+through+Aleatoric+Uncertainty)|0|

Without relying on any knowledge graphs, our method integrates the global planning strategy in both topic path generation and response generation given the initial and target topics. EAGLE comprises three components: a topic path sampling strategy, a topic flow generator, and a global planner. Our approach confers a number of advantages: EAGLE is robust to the target that has never appeared in the training data set and able to plan the topic flow globally. The topic path sampling strategy samples topic paths based on two predefined rules and use the sampled paths to train the topic path generator. The topic flow generator then applies a non-autoregressive method to generate intermediate topics that link the initial and target topics smoothly. In addition, the global planner is a response generator that generates a response based on the future topic sequence and conversation history, enabling it to plan how to transition to future topics smoothly. Our experimental results demonstrate that EAGLE produces more coherent responses and smoother transitions than state-of-the-art baselines, with an overall success rate improvement of approximately 25% and an average smoothness score improvement of 10% in both offline and human evaluations.|在这项研究中，我们提出了一个新的模型 EAGLE 面向目标的对话生成。该方法在不依赖任何知识图的情况下，将全局规划策略集成到给定初始和目标主题的主题路径生成和响应生成中。EAGLE 由三部分组成: 主题路径抽样策略、主题流生成器和全局规划器。我们的方法提供了许多优点: EAGLE 对从未出现在训练数据集中的目标是健壮的，并且能够在全局范围内规划主题流。主题路径采样策略根据两个预定义的规则对主题路径进行采样，并利用采样后的路径对主题路径生成器进行训练。然后，主题流生成器应用非自回归方法来生成中间主题，这些中间主题将初始主题和目标主题平滑地连接起来。此外，全局规划器是一个响应生成器，它根据未来的主题顺序和会话历史生成响应，使其能够规划如何平稳地过渡到未来的主题。我们的实验结果表明，与最先进的基线相比，EAGLE 产生更连贯的响应和更平滑的转换，总体成功率提高约25% ，在离线和人类评估中平均平滑评分提高10% 。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=EAGLE:+Enhance+Target-Oriented+Dialogs+by+Global+Planning+and+Topic+Flow+Integration)|0|

Many state-of-the-art models demonstrate the strong capability of spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNN) to capture complex spatio-temporal correlations. However, despite their effectiveness, existing approaches do not adequately address several key challenges. Data quality issues, such as data scarcity and sparsity, lead to data noise and a lack of supervised signals, which significantly limit the performance of STGNN. Although recent STGNN models with contrastive learning aim to address these challenges, most of them use pre-defined augmentation strategies that heavily depend on manual design and cannot be customized for different Spatio-Temporal Graph (STG) scenarios. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new spatio-temporal contrastive learning (CL4ST) framework to encode robust and generalizable STG representations via the STG augmentation paradigm. Specifically, we design the meta view generator to automatically construct node and edge augmentation views for each disentangled spatial and temporal graph in a data-driven manner. The meta view generator employs meta networks with parameterized generative model to customize the augmentations for each input. This personalizes the augmentation strategies for every STG and endows the learning framework with spatio-temporal-aware information. Additionally, we integrate a unified spatio-temporal graph attention network with the proposed meta view generator and two-branch graph contrastive learning paradigms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our CL4ST significantly improves performance over various state-of-the-art baselines in traffic and crime prediction.

Although no raw data is communicated between the two parties during model training, several works have demonstrated that data privacy, especially label privacy, is still vulnerable in split learning, and have proposed several defense algorithms against label attacks. However, the theoretical guarantee on the privacy preservation of these algorithms is limited. In this work, we propose a novel Private Split Learning Framework (PSLF). In PSLF, the label party shares only the gradients computed by flipped labels with the non-label party, which improves privacy preservation on raw labels, and meanwhile, we further design an extra sub-model from true labels to improve prediction accuracy. We also design a Flipped Multi-Label Generation mechanism (FMLG) based on randomized response for the label party to generate flipped labels. FMLG is proven differentially private and the label party could make a trade-off between privacy and utility by setting the DP budget.

Most of GNNs only focus on graphs with homogeneous features that correspond to one single feature field. For tabular features that are heterogeneous with multiple feature fields, GNNs often perform less favorably compared to machine learning methods such as boosted trees. In this work, we propose a new perspective to uncover the problem of GNNs on graphs with tabular features through both empirical study and theoretical analysis. The assumption of GNNs that connected nodes exhibit similar patterns can barely hold true for tabular features since multiple feature fields already exhibit different patterns. And propagation on such mismatched graph causes propagated features overcorrelated on graphs, which leads to the reduction of feature diversity and the increase of information redundancy. Therefore, we propose Field-aware Decorrelation Neural Network for graphs with tabular features (GraphFADE), a novel framework that directly optimizes the overcorrelation problem for graphs with tabular features. We first hierarchically partition the dataset into subsets with minimal correlation and then according to the decorrelation clustering results assemble the optimal matched graphs for each feature dimension to propagate on. The empirical study shows that our method achieves superior performance on multiple graphs with tabular features, demonstrating the effectiveness of our model.|近年来，图神经网络(GNN)以其从节点特征和图结构中提取有效表示的能力取得了巨大的成功。大多数 GNN 只关注对应于单一特征域的具有同质特征的图。对于具有多个特征域的异构表格特征，GNN 的性能往往不如增强树等机器学习方法。本文通过实证研究和理论分析，提出了一个新的视角来揭示具有表格特征的图的 GNN 问题。由于多个特征字段已经表现出不同的模式，所以连接节点表现出相似模式的 GNN 假设对于表格特征几乎不成立。而在这种不匹配图上的传播会导致图上的传播特征过度相关，从而导致特征多样性的降低和信息冗余的增加。因此，我们提出了基于场感知的具有表格特征图的去相关神经网络(GraphFADE) ，这是一种直接优化具有表格特征图的过相关问题的新框架。首先对数据集进行最小相关性分层划分，然后根据去相关聚类结果组合出每个特征维数传播的最优匹配图。实证研究表明，该方法对具有表格特征的多个图形具有较好的性能，证明了该模型的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=GraphFADE:+Field-aware+Decorrelation+Neural+Network+for+Graphs+with+Tabular+Features)|0|

It is essential for realizing many applications in cheminformatics and bioinformatics, such as modeling quantum chemistry-derived molecular structures in protein-ligand complexes. Additionally, many molecular generation methods can only generate molecular 3D atom clouds, requiring molecular perception as a necessary post-processing. However, existing molecular perception methods mainly rely on predefined chemical rules and fail to leverage 3D geometric information, whose performance is sub-optimal fully. In this study, we propose MPerformer, an SE(3) Transformer-based molecular perceptron exhibiting SE(3)-invariance, to construct 3D molecules from 3D atom clouds efficiently. Besides, we propose a multi-task pretraining-and-finetuning paradigm to learn this model. In the pretraining phase, we jointly minimize an attribute prediction loss and an atom cloud reconstruction loss, mitigating the data imbalance issue of molecular attributes and enhancing the robustness and generalizability of the model. Experiments show that MPerformer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art molecular perception methods in precision and robustness, benefiting various molecular generation scenarios.|分子感知旨在从三维原子云(即原子类型和相应的三维坐标)构建三维分子，确定分子内的键连接、键顺序和其他分子属性。这对于实现化学信息学和生物信息学中的许多应用，例如在蛋白质-配体复合物中建立量子化学衍生的分子结构是必不可少的。此外，许多分子生成方法只能生成分子三维原子云，需要分子感知作为必要的后处理。然而，现有的分子感知方法主要依赖于预定义的化学规则，不能充分利用三维几何信息，其性能完全是次优的。在这项研究中，我们提出了一个基于 SE (3)变压器的分子感知器，它具有 SE (3)不变性，可以有效地从三维原子云中构建三维分子。此外，我们提出了一个多任务预训练和微调范式来学习这个模型。在预训练阶段，我们将属性预测损失和原子云重构损失最小化，减轻了分子属性的数据不平衡问题，提高了模型的鲁棒性和通用性。实验结果表明，该算法在精度和鲁棒性方面明显优于目前最先进的分子感知方法，有利于各种分子生成场景。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=MPerformer:+An+SE(3)+Transformer-based+Molecular+Perceptron)|0|

These embedding methods require that all test entities are observed at training time, resulting in a time-consuming retraining process for out-of-knowledge-graph (OOKG) entities. To address this issue, current inductive knowledge embedding methods employ graph neural networks (GNNs) to represent unseen entities by aggregating information of known neighbors. They face three important challenges: (i) data sparsity, (ii) the presence of complex patterns in knowledge graphs (e.g., inter-rule correlations), and (iii) the presence of interactions among rule mining, rule inference, and embedding. In this paper, we propose a virtual neighbor network with inter-rule correlations (VNC) that consists of three stages: (i) rule mining, (ii) rule inference, and (iii) embedding. In the rule mining process, to identify complex patterns in knowledge graphs, both logic rules and inter-rule correlations are extracted from knowledge graphs based on operations over relation embeddings. To reduce data sparsity, virtual neighbors for OOKG entities are predicted and assigned soft labels by optimizing a rule-constrained problem. We also devise an iterative framework to capture the underlying relations between rule learning and embedding learning. In our experiments, results on both link prediction and triple classification tasks show that the proposed VNC framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on four widely-used knowledge graphs. Further analysis reveals that VNC is robust to the proportion of unseen entities and effectively mitigates data sparsity.|最近关于知识图完备化(KGC)的研究主要集中在知识图中实体的学习嵌入和关系的学习。这些嵌入方法要求所有的测试实体在训练时都被观察到，从而导致对知识外图(OOKG)实体进行耗时的再训练过程。为了解决这一问题，现有的归纳知识嵌入方法采用图神经网络(GNN)通过聚合已知邻居的信息来表示未知实体。他们面临三个重要的挑战: (i)数据稀疏，(ii)知识图中存在复杂模式(例如，规则间相关性) ，以及(iii)规则挖掘，规则推理和嵌入之间存在交互作用。本文提出了一种具有规则间相关性的虚拟邻居网络(VNC) ，该网络由三个阶段组成: (i)规则挖掘、(ii)规则推理和(iii)嵌入。在规则挖掘过程中，为了识别知识图中的复杂模式，基于关系嵌入操作从知识图中提取逻辑规则和规则间相关性。为了减少数据稀疏性，通过优化规则约束问题，对 OOKG 实体的虚拟邻居进行预测并分配软标签。我们还设计了一个迭代框架来捕捉规则学习和嵌入式学习之间的潜在关系。在我们的实验中，链路预测和三重分类任务的结果表明，所提出的 VNC 框架在四个广泛使用的知识图上实现了最先进的性能。进一步的分析表明，VNC 对不可见实体的比例具有鲁棒性，并有效地减少了数据稀疏性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Iteratively+Learning+Representations+for+Unseen+Entities+with+Inter-Rule+Correlations)|0|

CFEs can enhance informational fairness and trustworthiness, and provide suggestions for users who receive adverse predictions. However, recent research has shown that multiple CFEs can be offered for the same instance or instances with slight differences. Multiple CFEs provide flexible choices and cover diverse desiderata for user selection. However, individual fairness and model reliability will be damaged if unstable CFEs with different costs are returned. Existing methods fail to exploit flexibility and address the concerns of non-robustness simultaneously. To address these issues, we propose a conceptually simple yet effective solution named Counterfactual Explanations with Minimal Satisfiable Perturbations (CEMSP). Specifically, CEMSP constrains changing values of abnormal features with the help of their semantically meaningful normal ranges. For efficiency, we model the problem as a Boolean satisfiability problem to modify as few features as possible. Additionally, CEMSP is a general framework and can easily accommodate more practical requirements, e.g., casualty and actionability. Compared to existing methods, we conduct comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate that our method provides more robust explanations while preserving flexibility.|反事实解释(CFE)举例说明了如何最小限度地修改特征向量以实现对实例的不同预测。CFE 可以提高信息的公平性和可信度，并为收到负面预测的用户提供建议。然而，最近的研究表明，对于相同的实例或者稍有不同的实例，可以提供多个 CFE。多个 CFE 提供灵活的选择，并涵盖用户选择所需的各种数据。然而，如果返回不稳定且成本不同的 CFE，则会损害个体的公平性和模型的可靠性。现有的方法不能同时利用灵活性和解决非健壮性问题。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一个概念上简单但有效的解决方案，称为最小可满足扰动反事实解释(CEMSP)。具体来说，CEMSP 利用异常特征的语义有意义的正常范围来约束异常特征的变化值。为了提高效率，我们将问题建模为一个布尔可满足性问题，以尽可能少地修改功能。此外，CEMSP 是一个通用框架，可以很容易地适应更多的实际需求，例如，伤亡和可操作性。与已有的方法相比，我们对合成和真实数据集进行了全面的实验，结果表明该方法在保持灵活性的同时提供了更加稳健的解释。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Flexible+and+Robust+Counterfactual+Explanations+with+Minimal+Satisfiable+Perturbations)|0|

We present an end-to-end solution that aims to address these challenges for efficient GNNs in resource constrained environments while avoiding the oversmoothing problem in deep GNNs. We introduce a quantization based approach for all stages of GNNs, from message passing in training to node classification, compressing the model and enabling efficient processing. The proposed GNN quantizer learns quantization ranges and reduces the model size with comparable accuracy even under low-bit quantization. To scale with the number of layers, we devise a message propagation mechanism in training that controls layer-wise changes of similarities between neighboring nodes. This objective is incorporated into a Lagrangian function with constraints and a differential multiplier method is utilized to iteratively find optimal embeddings. This mitigates oversmoothing and suppresses the quantization error to a bound. Significant improvements are demonstrated over state-of-the-art quantization methods and deep GNN approaches in both full-precision and quantized models. The proposed quantizer demonstrates superior performance in INT2 configurations across all stages of GNN, achieving a notable level of accuracy. In contrast, existing quantization approaches fail to generate satisfactory accuracy levels.

Unlike traditional dense retrieval methods relying on dense vector representations of documents, model-based IR leverages language models to retrieve documents by generating their unique discrete identifiers (docids). This approach effectively reduces the requirements to store separate document representations in an index. Most existing model-based IR approaches utilize pre-defined static docids, i.e., these docids are fixed and are not learnable by training on the retrieval tasks. However, these docids are not specifically optimized for retrieval tasks, which makes it difficult to learn semantics and relationships between documents and achieve satisfactory retrieval performance. To address the above limitations, we propose Neural Optimized VOcabularial (NOVO) docids. NOVO docids are unique n-gram sets identifying each document. They can be generated in any order to retrieve the corresponding document and can be optimized through training to better learn semantics and relationships between documents. We propose to optimize NOVO docids through query denoising modeling and retrieval tasks, allowing for optimizing both semantic and token representations for such docids. Experiments on two datasets under the normal and zero-shot settings show that NOVO exhibits strong performance in more effective and interpretable model-based IR.|基于模型的信息检索(Model-based IR)因为生成语言模型的进步而受到关注。与传统的依赖于文档密集向量表示的密集检索方法不同，基于模型的 IR 利用语言模型通过生成独特的离散标识符(docids)来检索文档。这种方法有效地减少了在索引中存储单独文档表示形式的需求。大多数现有的基于模型的检索方法利用预定义的静态文档，即这些文档是固定的，不能通过检索任务的训练来学习。然而，这些文档并没有针对检索任务进行专门的优化，这使得学习文档之间的语义和关系以及获得令人满意的检索性能变得十分困难。针对上述局限性，我们提出了神经优化词汇表(NOVO)文档。NOVO docids 是唯一的 n-gram 集合，用于标识每个文档。它们可以以任何顺序生成，以检索相应的文档，并且可以通过培训进行优化，以更好地学习文档之间的语义和关系。我们建议通过查询去噪建模和检索任务来优化 NOVO 文档，允许优化此类文档的语义和令牌表示。在两个数据集上的实验表明，NOVO 在更有效、更易于解释的基于模型的 IR 中表现出很强的性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=NOVO:+Learnable+and+Interpretable+Document+Identifiers+for+Model-Based+IR)|0|

This is never easy to meet in practice when human explore new, large corpora without complete pictures. In this paper, we work on a novel yet important problem of weakly supervised open-world text classification, where supervision is only needed for a few examples from a few known classes and the machine should handle both known and unknown classes in test time. General open-world classification has been studied mostly using image classification; however, existing methods typically assume the availability of sufficient known-class supervision and strong unknown-class prior knowledge (e.g., the number and/or data distribution). We propose a novel framework WOT-Class that lifts those strong assumptions. Specifically, it follows an iterative process of (a) clustering text to new classes, (b) mining and ranking indicative words for each class, and (c) merging redundant classes by using the overlapped indicative words as a bridge. Extensive experiments on 7 popular text classification datasets demonstrate that WOT-Class outperforms strong baselines consistently with a large margin, attaining 23.33% greater average absolute macro-F1 over existing approaches across all datasets. Such competent accuracy illuminates the practical potential of further reducing human effort for text classification.|最先进的弱监督文本分类方法，虽然大大减少了所需的人工监督，但仍然要求监督覆盖所有感兴趣的类别。当人们在没有完整图片的情况下探索新的、大型的语料库时，这在实践中是不容易实现的。本文研究了弱监督开放世界文本分类的一个新的重要问题。一般的开放世界分类主要是利用图像分类进行研究，然而，现有的分类方法通常假定有足够的已知类监督和强大的未知类先验知识(例如，数字和/或数据分布)。我们提出了一个新的框架 WOT-Class，消除了这些强烈的假设。具体来说，它遵循以下迭代过程: (a)将文本聚类到新类; (b)为每个类挖掘和排序指示性词; (c)通过使用重叠的指示性词作为桥梁来合并冗余类。在7个流行的文本分类数据集上进行的大量实验表明，WOT-Class 一直以大幅度优于强基线，在所有数据集上比现有方法获得23.33% 更高的平均绝对宏 F1。这种称职的准确性说明了进一步减少文本分类工作的实际潜力。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=WOT-Class:+Weakly+Supervised+Open-world+Text+Classification)|0|

Therefore, predicting potential DDI has always been an important and challenging issue in medical health applications. Owing to the extensive pharmacological research, we can get access to various drug-related features for DDI predictions; however, most of the existing works on DDI prediction do not incorporate comprehensive features to analyze the DDI patterns. Despite the high performance that the existing works have achieved, the incomplete and noisy information generated from limited sources usually leads to sub-optimal performance and poor generalization ability on the unknown DDI pairs. In this work, we propose a holistic framework, namely Multi-modality Feature Optimal Fusion for Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction (MOF-DDI), that incorporates the features from multiple data sources to resolve the DDI predictions. Specifically, the proposed model jointly considers DDIs literature descriptions, biomedical knowledge graphs, and drug molecular structures to make the prediction. To overcome the issue induced by directly aggregating features in different modalities, we bring a new insight by mapping the representations learned from different sources to a unified hidden space before the combination. The empirical results show that MOF-DDI achieves a large performance gain on different DDI datasets compared with multiple state-of-the-art baselines, especially under the inductive setting.|药物相互作用(DDI)是药物联合治疗的可能结果，可能导致不良生理反应，增加患者的死亡率。因此，预测潜在的 DDI 一直是医疗卫生应用中的一个重要和具有挑战性的问题。由于广泛的药理学研究，我们可以获得各种 DDI 预测的药物相关特征，然而，现有的 DDI 预测工作大多没有包含全面的特征来分析 DDI 模式。尽管现有的工作已经取得了很高的性能，但是由有限信源产生的不完全信息和噪声信息通常会导致未知 DDI 对的性能次优和泛化能力较差。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个整体框架，即多模态特征最优融合药物-药物相互作用预测(MOF-DDI) ，它结合了来自多个数据源的特征来解决 DDI 预测。具体地说，该模型综合考虑了 DDI 文献描述、生物医学知识图和药物分子结构等因素进行预测。为了克服在不同模式下直接聚合特征所引起的问题，我们将从不同来源学到的表征映射到合并前的统一隐藏空间，提出了一种新的观点。实验结果表明，MOF-DDI 在不同的 DDI 数据集上，特别是在归纳设置下，比多个最新的基线数据集获得了更大的性能增益。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=A+Multi-Modality+Framework+for+Drug-Drug+Interaction+Prediction+by+Harnessing+Multi-source+Data)|0|

Existing approaches typically follow a "Train-from-Scratch" paradigm, which is fundamentally bounded by the availability of large-scale annotated data. While expressive pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been adapted in a "Pre-Train-and-Fine-Tune" manner, the inconsistency between pre-training and downstream objectives also requires costly task-specific supervision. In this paper, we propose "Prompt-and-Align" (P&A), a novel prompt-based paradigm for few-shot fake news detection that jointly leverages the pre-trained knowledge in PLMs and the social context topology. Our approach mitigates label scarcity by wrapping the news article in a task-related textual prompt, which is then processed by the PLM to directly elicit task-specific knowledge. To supplement the PLM with social context without inducing additional training overheads, motivated by empirical observation on user veracity consistency (i.e., social users tend to consume news of the same veracity type), we further construct a news proximity graph among news articles to capture the veracity-consistent signals in shared readerships, and align the prompting predictions along the graph edges in a confidence-informed manner. Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks demonstrate that P&A sets new states-of-the-art for few-shot fake news detection performance by significant margins.|尽管假新闻自动检测技术取得了长足的进步，但由于新闻的及时性，如何在有限的事实核查基础上有效地预测新闻报道的真实性仍然是一个悬而未决的问题。现有的方法通常遵循“从头开始训练”的范式，这种范式从根本上受到大规模注释数据可用性的限制。虽然表达式预训练语言模型(PLM)已经以“预训练和微调”的方式进行了调整，但预训练和下游目标之间的不一致性也需要昂贵的特定任务监督。在本文中，我们提出了“提示-对齐”(P & A) ，一个新颖的基于提示的范例，用于少拍摄假新闻检测，共同利用 PLM 中的预训练知识和社会上下文拓扑。我们的方法通过将新闻文章包装在一个与任务相关的文本提示符中来缓解标签稀缺性，然后由 PLM 处理该提示符直接获取特定任务的知识。为了在不引入额外培训开销的情况下，通过对用户准确性一致性(即社交用户倾向于消费相同准确性类型的新闻)的实证观察来补充 PLM，我们进一步构建了新闻文章之间的新闻接近度图，以捕获共享读者群中的准确性一致信号，并以信心知情的方式沿图边缘对齐提示预测。在三个现实世界的基准上进行的大量实验表明，P & A 为几乎没有镜头的假新闻检测性能提供了新的最高水平。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Prompt-and-Align:+Prompt-Based+Social+Alignment+for+Few-Shot+Fake+News+Detection)|0|

State-of-the-art PU learning methods have resulted in the development of various risk estimators, yet they neglect the differences among distinct populations. To address this issue, we present a novel Positive-Unlabeled Learning Tree (PUtree) algorithm. PUtree is designed to take into account communities such as different age or income brackets, in tasks of chronic disease prediction. We propose a novel approach for binary decision-making, which hierarchically builds community-based PU models and then aggregates their deliverables. Our method can explicate each PU model on the tree for the optimized non-leaf PU node splitting.

Recently, deep learning have demonstrated great potential to deal with this task. However, prior works have mostly treated SA as a deterministic classification problem, and meanwhile, without quantifying the predictive uncertainty. This presents a serious problem in the SA, different annotator, due to the differences in beliefs, values, and experiences, may have different perspectives on how to label the text sentiment. Such situation will lead to inevitable data uncertainty and make the deterministic classification models feel puzzle to make decision. To address this issue, we propose a new SA paradigm with the consideration of uncertainty and conduct an expensive empirical study. Specifically, we treat SA as the regression task and introduce uncertainty quantification to obtain confidence intervals for predictions, which enables the risk assessment ability of the model and can improve the credibility of SA-aids decision-making. Experiments on five datasets show that our proposed new paradigm effectively quantifies uncertainty in SA while remaining competitive performance to point estimation, in addition to being capable of Out-Of-Distribution~(OOD) detection.|情感分析是自然语言处理中的一项基础性工作，在公共决策中得到了广泛的应用。近年来，深度学习在解决这一问题上显示出巨大的潜力。然而，以往的工作大多将模拟退火视为一个确定性的分类问题，同时没有量化预测的不确定性。由于信仰、价值观和经验的差异，不同的注释者对于如何标注文本情感可能有不同的看法。这种情况将导致不可避免的数据不确定性，使确定性分类模型感到困惑而作出决策。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个考虑不确定性的 SA 范式，并进行了一个昂贵的实证研究。具体来说，我们将模拟退火作为回归任务，引入不确定性量化来获得预测的置信区间，从而使模型具有风险评估能力，提高了模拟退火辅助决策的可信度。在5个数据集上的实验表明，我们提出的新范式有效地量化了 SA 中的不确定性，同时保持了对点估计的竞争性能，此外还能够检测到外部分布的 ~ (OOD)。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Rethinking+Sentiment+Analysis+under+Uncertainty)|0|
|[HiPo: Detecting Fake News via Historical and Multi-Modal Analyses of Social Media Posts](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614914)|Tianshu Xiao, Sichang Guo, Jingcheng Huang, Riccardo Spolaor, Xiuzhen Cheng|Shandong University, Qingdao, China|In recent years, fake news has been a primary concern as it plays a significant role in influencing the political, economic, and social spheres. The scientific community has proposed several solutions to detect such fraudulent information. However, such solutions are unsuitable for social media posts since they cannot extract sufficient information from one-line textual and graphical content or are highly dependent on prior knowledge, which may be unavailable in the case of unprecedented events (e.g., breaking news). This paper tackles this issue by proposing HiPo, a novel multi-modal historical post-based fake news detection method. By combining the features extracted from the graphical and textual content, HiPo assesses the truthfulness of a social media post by building its historical context from prior off-label posts with high similarity, therefore, achieving online detection without maintaining a context or knowledge database. We evaluate the performance of HiPo via an exhaustive set of experiments involving four real-world datasets. Our method achieves a detection accuracy higher than 84%, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods in most experimental instances.|近年来，假新闻在政治、经济、社会等领域发挥着重要的影响力，成为人们关注的焦点。科学界已经提出了几种方案来检测这种欺诈性信息。然而，这样的解决方案并不适用于社交媒体帖子，因为它们不能从单行文本和图形内容中提取足够的信息，或者高度依赖于先前的知识，而这些知识在发生前所未有的事件(例如突发新闻)时可能无法获得。为了解决这个问题，本文提出了一种新的多模态历史邮政假新闻检测方法—— HiPo。通过结合从图形和文本内容中提取的特征，HiPo 评估了一个社交媒体帖子的真实性，通过建立其历史背景，从以前的标签外的帖子具有高度相似性，因此，实现在线检测，而不需要维护背景或知识数据库。我们通过一系列包含四个现实世界数据集的详尽实验来评估 HiPo 的表现。我们的方法实现了高于84% 的检测准确率，在大多数实验实例中优于最先进的方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=HiPo:+Detecting+Fake+News+via+Historical+and+Multi-Modal+Analyses+of+Social+Media+Posts)|0|
|[An Efficient Selective Ensemble Learning with Rejection Approach for Classification](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614780)|Hao Xu, Chiranjeet Chetia|Visa Research, Austin, TX, USA|Recent studies found that selective ensemble learning (e.g., dynamic ensemble selection) shows better predictive performance for classification tasks, compared to traditional static ensemble. However, there are some limitations of the available methods, such as high computational cost and multiple restrictions in base model ranking and aggregation (especially for class-imbalanced data modeling). Besides, the current methods make predictions for all data without measuring the credibility regarding different data patterns. This paper proposes a selective ensemble learning with rejection approach that aggregates base models from a different perspective. The approach introduces rejection measures to quantify base model credibility, and learns how to use the models according to their credibility on different sample patterns. It avoids the complexity in base model ranking and therefore is computationally more efficient than current methods. Any common evaluation metrics can be adopted in the selective ensemble strategy, which allows the developed model to handle class-imbalanced data properly. Also, a global rejection region is developed which indicates whether the ensemble model can provide reliable predictions for the targets. We implement the approach in the modeling of 12 datasets, including both class-imbalanced and class-balanced cases. Results show that the approach significantly reduces the inference time while showing promising performance, compared to 8 dynamic ensemble selection methods in the literature. Feature contributions and impacts of different rejection ratios on performance are also investigated to better demonstrate the approach.|最近的研究发现，与传统的静态集合相比，选择性集成学习(例如，动态集合选择)对分类任务有更好的预测性能。然而，现有的方法存在一些局限性，如计算成本高和基本模型排序和聚合的多重限制(特别是对于类不平衡的数据建模)。此外，目前的方法对所有的数据进行预测，而没有测量关于不同数据模式的可信度。这篇文章提出了一个选择性的集成学习和拒绝方法，从不同的角度聚合了基础模型。该方法引入拒绝测度来量化基本模型的可信度，并学习如何根据模型在不同样本模式上的可信度来使用模型。它避免了基本模型排序的复杂性，因此计算效率比目前的方法。在选择性集成策略中可以采用任何通用的评价指标，使得开发的模型能够正确处理类不平衡的数据。此外，还建立了一个全局抑制区域，用以表明系综模型能否为目标提供可靠的预测。我们在12个数据集的建模中实现了该方法，包括类不平衡和类平衡两种情况。结果表明，与文献中的8种动态集合选择方法相比，该方法在显示出良好性能的同时显著缩短了推理时间。为了更好地验证该方法，还研究了不同拒绝率对性能的影响和特征贡献。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=An+Efficient+Selective+Ensemble+Learning+with+Rejection+Approach+for+Classification)|0|
|[Density-Aware Temporal Attentive Step-wise Diffusion Model For Medical Time Series Imputation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614840)|Jingwen Xu, Fei Lyu, Pong C. Yuen|Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong, Hong Kong; Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong, China|Medical time series have been widely employed for disease prediction. Missing data hinders accurate prediction. While existing imputation methods partially solve the problem, there are two challenges for medical time series: (1) High dimensionality: Existing imputation methods existing methods suffer from the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency. (2) Irregularity: Medical time series exhibit the dynamic temporal relationship that changes over varying sampling densities. However, existing methods mainly take the stationary mechanism, which struggles with capturing the dynamic temporal relationships. To overcome the above deficiencies, we propose a Density-Aware Temporal Attentive Step-wise Diffusion Model (DA-TASWDM), which imputes each time step based on a non-iterative diffusion model and captures inter-step dependency with the density-aware time similarity. Specifically, DA-TASWDM exploits two novel modules: (1) Density-Aware Temporal Attention (DA-TA): It correlates inter-step values from the time embedding similarity adjusted with varying sampling densities. (2) Non-Iterative Step-wise Diffusion Imputer (NI-SWDI): It directly recovers the missing values at each time step from noise without diffusion iteration. Compared with the existing methods, DA-TASWDM can achieve promising accuracy without sacrificing computational efficiency. Extensive experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our method can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in both imputation and post-imputation performance.|医学时间序列已被广泛应用于疾病预测。缺少数据妨碍准确预测。现有的插补方法虽然部分地解决了这个问题，但是对于医学时间序列来说，仍然存在两个挑战: (1)高维度: 现有的插补方法在精度和计算效率之间存在折衷。(2)不规则性: 医学时间序列表现出随采样密度变化而变化的动态时间关系。然而，现有的方法主要采用平稳机制，难以捕捉动态的时间关系。为了克服上述缺陷，我们提出了一种基于非迭代扩散模型的密度感知时态注意逐步扩散模型(DA-TASWDM) ，该模型基于非迭代扩散模型计算每个时间步长，并捕获具有密度感知时间相似性的步间相关性。具体而言，DA-TASWDM 采用了两个新颖的模块: (1)密度感知时间注意(DA-TA) : 它通过改变采样密度来调整时间嵌入相似度的步间值。(2)非迭代逐步扩散计算器(NI-SWDI) : 它不需要扩散迭代，直接从噪声中恢复每个时间步的缺失值。与现有方法相比，DA-TASWDM 在不牺牲计算效率的前提下，能够获得较高的精度。在三个实际数据集上的大量实验结果表明，该方法在插补性能和插补后性能方面都明显优于最新的插补方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Density-Aware+Temporal+Attentive+Step-wise+Diffusion+Model+For+Medical+Time+Series+Imputation)|0|
|[Minimizing Polarization in Noisy Leader-Follower Opinion Dynamics](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614968)|Wanyue Xu, Zhongzhi Zhang|Fudan University, Shanghai, China|The operation of creating edges has been widely applied to optimize relevant quantities of opinion dynamics. In this paper, we consider a problem of polarization optimization for the leader-follower opinion dynamics in a noisy social network with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges, where a group $Q$ of $q$ nodes are leaders, and the remaining $n-q$ nodes are followers. We adopt the popular leader-follower DeGroot model, where the opinion of every leader is identical and remains unchanged, while the opinion of every follower is subject to white noise. The polarization is defined as the steady-state variance of the deviation of each node's opinion from leaders' opinion, which equals one half of the effective resistance $\mathcal{R}_Q$ between the node group $Q$ and all other nodes. Concretely, we propose and study the problem of minimizing $\mathcal{R}_Q$ by adding $k$ new edges with each incident to a node in $Q$. We show that the objective function is monotone and supermodular. We then propose a simple greedy algorithm with an approximation factor $1-1/e$ that approximately solves the problem in $O((n-q)^3)$ time. To speed up the computation, we also provide a fast algorithm to compute $(1-1/e-\eps)$-approximate effective resistance $\mathcal{R}_Q$, the running time of which is $\Otil (mk\eps^{-2})$ for any $\eps>0$, where the $\Otil (\cdot)$ notation suppresses the ${\rm poly} (\log n)$ factors.

Learning shapelets by a continuous optimization has recently been studied to improve computational efficiency and classification performance. However, existing methods have employed predefined and fixed shapelet lengths during the continuous optimization, despite the fact that shapelets and their lengths are inherently interdependent and thus should be jointly optimized. To efficiently explore shapelets of high quality in terms of interpretability and inter-class separability, this study makes the shapelet lengths continuous and learnable. The proposed formulation jointly optimizes not only a binary classifier and shapelets but also shapelet lengths. The derived SGD optimization can be theoretically interpreted as improving the quality of shapelets in terms of shapelet closeness to the time series for target / off-target classes. We demonstrate improvements in area under the curve, total training time, and shapelet interpretability on UCR binary datasets.|形状是对时间序列实例进行有效分类的子序列。为了提高计算效率和分类性能，最近研究了连续优化学习形状的方法。然而，现有的方法在连续优化过程中采用了预定义和固定的小波长度，尽管事实上小波长度和它们的长度本质上是相互依赖的，因此应该联合优化。为了在可解释性和类间可分性方面有效地探索高质量的形状，本研究使得形状长度是连续的和可学习的。该公式不仅对二元分类器和形状进行了联合优化，而且对形状长度进行了联合优化。推导出的 SGD 优化算法可以从理论上解释为提高目标/非目标类的小波接近时间序列的形状质量。我们在 UCR 二值数据集上展示了曲线下面积、总训练时间和小波可解释性的改进。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Time-series+Shapelets+with+Learnable+Lengths)|0|

Recent studies have shown that the deep local descriptors have better representation ability than image-level features, and achieve great success. However, most of these methods often use all local descriptors or over-screening local descriptors for classification. The former contains some task-irrelevant descriptors, which may misguide the final classification result. The latter is likely to lose some key descriptors. In this paper, we propose a novel Task-Aware Discriminant local descriptors Network (TADNet) to address these issues, which can adaptively select the discriminative query descriptors and eliminate the task-irrelevant query descriptors among the entire task. Specifically, TADNet assigns a value to each query descriptor by comparing its similarity to all support classes to represent its discriminant power for classification. Then the discriminative query descriptors can be preserved via a task-aware attention map. Extensive experiments on both fine-grained and generalized datasets demonstrate that the proposed TADNet outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods.|图像分类任务中的少镜头学习是针对有限样本数的几类新图像进行分类。近年来的研究表明，深层局部描述符比图像级特征具有更好的表示能力，并取得了很大的成功。然而，大多数这些方法往往使用所有的局部描述符或过度筛选局部描述符进行分类。前者包含一些与任务无关的描述符，可能会误导最终的分类结果。后者可能会丢失一些关键的描述符。针对这些问题，本文提出了一种新的任务感知鉴别局部描述符网络(TADNet) ，该网络可以自适应地选择鉴别查询描述符，消除整个任务中与任务无关的查询描述符。具体来说，TADNet 通过比较每个查询描述符与所有支持类的相似性，为每个查询描述符分配一个值，以表示其分类的判别能力。然后通过任务感知的注意图保留区分查询描述符。在细粒度和广义数据集上的大量实验表明，所提出的 TADNet 优于现有的最先进的方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Few-Shot+Learning+via+Task-Aware+Discriminant+Local+Descriptors+Network)|0|
|[A Bipartite Graph is All We Need for Enhancing Emotional Reasoning with Commonsense Knowledge](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614758)|Kailai Yang, Tianlin Zhang, Shaoxiong Ji, Sophia Ananiadou|The University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom; University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland|The context-aware emotional reasoning ability of AI systems, especially in conversations, is of vital importance in applications such as online opinion mining from social media and empathetic dialogue systems. Due to the implicit nature of conveying emotions in many scenarios, commonsense knowledge is widely utilized to enrich utterance semantics and enhance conversation modeling. However, most previous knowledge infusion methods perform empirical knowledge filtering and design highly customized architectures for knowledge interaction with the utterances, which can discard useful knowledge aspects and limit their generalizability to different knowledge sources. Based on these observations, we propose a Bipartite Heterogeneous Graph (BHG) method for enhancing emotional reasoning with commonsense knowledge. In BHG, the extracted context-aware utterance representations and knowledge representations are modeled as heterogeneous nodes. Two more knowledge aggregation node types are proposed to perform automatic knowledge filtering and interaction. BHG-based knowledge infusion can be directly generalized to multi-type and multi-grained knowledge sources. In addition, we propose a Multi-dimensional Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (MHGT) to perform graph reasoning, which can retain unchanged feature spaces and unequal dimensions for heterogeneous node types during inference to prevent unnecessary loss of information. Experiments show that BHG-based methods significantly outperform state-of-the-art knowledge infusion methods and show generalized knowledge infusion ability with higher efficiency. Further analysis proves that previous empirical knowledge filtering methods do not guarantee to provide the most useful knowledge information.

In this paper, we design a novel cross-city transfer learning framework named CARPG for predicting traffic accidents in data-scarce cities. We address the unique challenge of predicting traffic accidents caused by its two fundamental characteristics, i.e., spatial heterogeneity and inherent rareness, which result in the biased performance of the state-of-the-art transfer learning methods.

Further, we design an efficient attention-based parameter-generating mechanism to learn region-specific traffic accident patterns, while controlling the total number of parameters. Built upon that, we ensure that only relevant patterns are transferred to each target region during the knowledge transfer process and further to be fine-tuned.

NNER is where one entity may be part of a longer entity, and this may happen on multiple levels, as the term nested suggests. These nested structures make traditional sequence labeling methods unable to properly recognize all entities. While recent researches focus on designing better recognition methods for NNER in a variety of languages, the Chinese NNER (CNNER) still lacks attention, where a free-for-access, CNNER-specialized benchmark is absent. In this paper, we aim to solve CNNER problems by providing a Chinese dataset and a learning-based model to tackle the issue. To facilitate the research on this task, we release ChiNesE, a CNNER dataset with 20,000 sentences sampled from online passages of multiple domains, containing 117,284 entities failing in 10 categories, where 43.8 percent of those entities are nested. Based on ChiNesE, we propose Mulco, a novel method that can recognize named entities in nested structures through multiple scopes. Each scope use a designed scope-based sequence labeling method, which predicts an anchor and the length of a named entity to recognize it. Experiment results show that Mulco has outperformed several baseline methods with the different recognizing schemes on ChiNesE.

The black-box property of neural networks already becomes one of the main obstacles preventing from being applied to many high-stakes applications, such as finance and medicine that have critical requirement on the model transparency and interpretability. In order to enhance the explainability of neural networks, we propose a neural rule learning method-Feature Interactive Neural Rule Learning (FINRule) to incorporate the expressivity of neural networks and the interpretability of rule-based systems. Specifically, we conduct rule learning as differential discrete combination encoded by a feedforward neural network, in which each layer acts as a logical operator of explainable decision conditions.

|[MUSE: Multi-view Contrastive Learning for Heterophilic Graphs via Information Reconstruction](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614985)|Mengyi Yuan, Minjie Chen, Xiang Li|East China Normal University, Shanghai, China|In recent years, self-supervised learning has emerged as a promising approach in addressing the issues of label dependency and poor generalization performance in traditional GNNs. However, existing self-supervised methods have limited effectiveness on heterophilic graphs, due to the homophily assumption that results in similar node representations for connected nodes. In this work, we propose a multi-view contrastive learning model for heterophilic graphs, namely, MUSE. Specifically, we construct two views to capture the information of the ego node and its neighborhood by GNNs enhanced with contrastive learning, respectively. Then we integrate the information from these two views to fuse the node representations. Fusion contrast is utilized to enhance the effectiveness of fused node representations. Further, considering that the influence of neighboring contextual information on information fusion may vary across different ego nodes, we employ an information fusion controller to model the diversity of node-neighborhood similarity at both the local and global levels. Finally, an alternating training scheme is adopted to ensure that unsupervised node representation learning and information fusion controller can mutually reinforce each other. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of MUSE on 9 benchmark datasets. Our results show the effectiveness of MUSE on both node classification and clustering tasks.

As the core component of ADSs, maneuver decision aims to make tactical decisions to accomplish road following, obstacle avoidance, and efficient driving. In this work, we consider a typical but rarely studied task, called Target-Lane-Entering (TLE), where an autonomous vehicle should enter a target lane before reaching an intersection to ensure a smooth transition to another road. For navigation-assisted autonomous driving, a maneuver decision module chooses the optimal timing to enter the target lane in each road section, thus avoiding rerouting and reducing travel time. To achieve the TLE task, we propose a ruLe-aided reINforcement lEarning framework, called LINE, which combines the advantages of RL-based policy and rule-based strategy, allowing the autonomous vehicle to make target-oriented maneuver decisions. Specifically, an RL-based policy with a hybrid reward function is able to make safe, efficient, and comfortable decisions while considering the factors of target lanes. Then a strategy of rule revision aims to help the policy learn from intervention and block the risk of missing target lanes. Extensive experiments based on the SUMO simulator confirm the effectiveness of our framework.

However, recent works reveal that the learned weights (channels) in well-trained GNNs are highly redundant, which inevitably limits the performance of GNNs. Instead of removing these redundant channels for efficiency consideration, we aim to reactivate them to enlarge the representation capacity of GNNs for effective graph learning. In this paper, we propose to substitute these redundant channels with other informative channels to achieve this goal. We introduce a novel GNN learning framework named AKE-GNN, which performs the Adaptive Knowledge Exchange strategy among multiple graph views generated by graph augmentations. AKE-GNN first trains multiple GNNs each corresponding to one graph view to obtain informative channels. Then, AKE-GNN iteratively exchanges redundant channels in the weight parameter matrix of one GNN with informative channels of another GNN in a layer-wise manner. Additionally, existing GNNs can be seamlessly incorporated into our framework. AKE-GNN achieves superior performance compared with various baselines across a suite of experiments on node classification, link prediction, and graph classification. In particular, we conduct a series of experiments on 15 public benchmark datasets, 8 popular GNN models, and 3 graph tasks and show that AKE-GNN consistently outperforms existing popular GNN models and even their ensembles.

However, many dynamic networks are not only rich in structure, but also in content information. For example, an academic citation network has content such as the title and abstracts of the papers. Currently, there is a lack of generative models for dynamic networks that also generate content. To address this gap, in this work we propose DYnamic Attributed Node rolEs (DYANE)-a generative model that (i) captures network structure dynamics through temporal motifs, and (ii) extends the structural roles of nodes in motifs (e.g., a node acting as a hub in a wedge) to roles that generate content embeddings. We evaluate DYANE on real-world networks against other dynamic graph generative model baselines. DYANE outperforms the baselines in graph structure and node behavior, improving the KS score for graph metrics by 21-31% and node metrics by 17-27% on average, and produces content embeddings similar to the observed network.

However, real-world dynamic graphs typically contain diverse and intricate noise. Noise can significantly degrade the quality of representation generation, impeding the effectiveness of TGNs in downstream tasks. Though structure learning is widely applied to mitigate noise in static graphs, its adaptation to dynamic graph settings poses two significant challenges. i) Noise dynamics. Existing structure learning methods are ill-equipped to address the temporal aspect of noise, hampering their effectiveness in such dynamic and ever-changing noise patterns. ii) More severe noise. Noise may be introduced along with multiple interactions between two nodes, leading to the re-pollution of these nodes and consequently causing more severe noise compared to static graphs. In this paper, we present RDGSL, a representation learning method in continuous-time dynamic graphs. Meanwhile, we propose dynamic graph structure learning, a novel supervisory signal that empowers RDGSL with the ability to effectively combat noise in dynamic graphs. To address the noise dynamics issue, we introduce the Dynamic Graph Filter, where we innovatively propose a dynamic noise function that dynamically captures both current and historical noise, enabling us to assess the temporal aspect of noise and generate a denoised graph. We further propose the Temporal Embedding Learner to tackle the challenge of more severe noise, which utilizes an attention mechanism to selectively turn a blind eye to noisy edges and hence focus on normal edges, enhancing the expressiveness for representation generation that remains resilient to noise.

In mobile games, deploying microtransactions is a simple yet effective monetization strategy, which attracts a tiny group of game whales who splurge on in-game purchases. The presence of such game whales may impede the practicality of existing LTV prediction models, since game whales' purchase behaviours always exhibit varied distribution from general users. Consequently, identifying game whales can open up new opportunities to improve the accuracy of LTV prediction models. However, little attention has been paid to applying game whale detection in LTV prediction, and existing works are mainly specialized for the long-term LTV prediction with the assumption that the high-quality user features are available, which is not applicable in the UA stage. In this paper, we propose ExpLTV, a novel multi-task framework to perform LTV prediction and game whale detection in a unified way. In ExpLTV, we first innovatively design a deep neural network-based game whale detector that can not only infer the intrinsic order in accordance with monetary value, but also precisely identify high spenders (i.e., game whales) and low spenders. Then, by treating the game whale detector as a gating network to decide the different mixture patterns of LTV experts assembling, we can thoroughly leverage the shared information and scenario-specific information (i.e., game whales modelling and low spenders modelling). Finally, instead of separately designing a purchase rate estimator for two tasks, we design a shared estimator that can preserve the inner task relationships.

Therefore, KT methods usually truncate sequences to an acceptable length, which makes it difficult for models on online service systems to capture complete historical practice behaviors of students with too long sequences.

Most FL algorithms assume all data is annotated, which is impractical due to the high cost of labeling data in real applications. To alleviate the reliance on labeled data, semi-supervised federated learning (SSFL) has been proposed to utilize unlabeled data on clients to improve model performance. However, most existing methods either have privacy issues which share models trained on other clients, or generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled local datasets with the global model, which is usually biased towards the global data distribution. The latter may lead to sub-optimal accuracy of pseudo-labels, due to the gap between the local data distribution and the global model, especially in non-IID settings. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised heterogeneous federated learning method with local knowledge enhancement, called FedLoKe, which aims to train an accurate global model from both labeled and unlabeled local data with non-IID distributions. Specifically, in FedLoKe, the server maintains a global model to capture global data distribution, and each client learns a local model to capture local data distribution. Since the distribution captured by the local model is aligned with the local data distribution, we utilize it to generate high-accuracy pseudo-labels of the unlabeled dataset for global model training. To prevent the local model from severely overfitting the small number of local labeled data, we further use the exponential moving average and apply the global model to generate pseudo-labels for local modeling training. Experiments on four datasets show the effectiveness of FedLoKe.

|[Closed-form Machine Unlearning for Matrix Factorization](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614811)|Shuijing Zhang, Jian Lou, Li Xiong, Xiaoyu Zhang, Jing Liu|Xidian University, Guangzhou, China; Xidian University, Xi'an, China; Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA; Zhejiang University, Guangzhou, China|Matrix factorization (MF) is a fundamental model in data mining and machine learning, which finds wide applications in diverse application areas, including recommendation systems with user-item rating matrices, phenotype extraction from electronic health records, and spatial-temporal data analysis for check-in records. The "right to be forgotten" has become an indispensable privacy consideration due to the widely enforced data protection regulations, which allow personal users having contributed their data for model training to revoke their data through a data deletion request. Consequently, it gives rise to the emerging task of machine unlearning for the MF model, which removes the influence of the matrix rows/columns from the trained MF factors upon receiving the deletion requests from the data owners of these rows/columns. The central goal is to effectively remove the influence of the rows/columns to be forgotten, while avoiding the computationally prohibitive baseline approach of retraining from scratch. Existing machine unlearning methods are either designed for single-variable models and not compatible with MF that has two factors as coupled model variables, or require alternative updates that are not efficient enough. In this paper, we propose a closed-form machine unlearning method. In particular, we explicitly capture the implicit dependency between the two factors, which yields the total Hessian-based Newton step as the closed-form unlearning update. In addition, we further introduce a series of efficiency-enhancement strategies by exploiting the structural properties of the total Hessian. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets from three application areas as well as synthetic datasets validate the efficiency, effectiveness, and utility of the proposed method.|矩阵分解是数据挖掘和机器学习的基本模型，在不同的应用领域有广泛的应用，包括使用用户项目评分矩阵的推荐系统、从电子健康记录中提取表型，以及为签到记录进行时空数据分析。“被遗忘的权利”已成为一个不可或缺的隐私考虑，由于广泛执行的数据保护法规，允许个人用户贡献了他们的数据模型培训，撤销他们的数据通过一个数据删除请求。因此，它产生了 MF 模型的机器学习新任务，消除了训练后的 MF 因子的矩阵行/列在接收到这些行/列的数据所有者的删除请求时的影响。中心目标是有效地消除要忘记的行/列的影响，同时避免从头开始再训练的计算上禁止的基线方法。现有的机器去学习方法要么是为单变量模型设计的，与有两个因素作为耦合模型变量的 MF 不兼容，要么需要不够有效的替代更新。本文提出了一种闭式机器去学习方法。特别地，我们显式地捕捉了这两个因素之间的隐式依赖关系，从而产生了基于 Hessian 的牛顿步作为闭合形式的无学习更新。此外，我们进一步介绍了一系列的效率提高策略，利用结构性质的总黑森。通过对来自三个应用领域的五个实际数据集以及合成数据集的大量实验，验证了该方法的有效性和实用性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Closed-form+Machine+Unlearning+for+Matrix+Factorization)|0|
|[Time-aware Graph Structure Learning via Sequence Prediction on Temporal Graphs](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615081)|Haozhen Zhang, Xueting Han, Xi Xiao, Jing Bai|Shenzhen International Graduate School, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen, China; Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China|Temporal Graph Learning, which aims to model the time-evolving nature of graphs, has gained increasing attention and achieved remarkable performance recently. However, in reality, graph structures are often incomplete and noisy, which hinders temporal graph networks (TGNs) from learning informative representations. Graph contrastive learning uses data augmentation to generate plausible variations of existing data and learn robust representations. However, rule-based augmentation approaches may be suboptimal as they lack learnability and fail to leverage rich information from downstream tasks. To address these issues, we propose a Time-aware Graph Structure Learning (TGSL) approach via sequence prediction on temporal graphs, which learns better graph structures for downstream tasks through adding potential temporal edges. In particular, it predicts time-aware context embedding based on previously observed interactions and uses the Gumble-Top-K to select the closest candidate edges to this context embedding. Additionally, several candidate sampling strategies are proposed to ensure both efficiency and diversity. Furthermore, we jointly learn the graph structure and TGNs in an end-to-end manner and perform inference on the refined graph. Extensive experiments on temporal link prediction benchmarks demonstrate that TGSL yields significant gains for the popular TGNs such as TGAT and GraphMixer, and it outperforms other contrastive learning methods on temporal graphs. We will release the code in the future.|时态图学习作为一种对图的时间演化特性进行建模的学习方法，近年来得到了越来越多的关注，并取得了显著的效果。然而，在现实中，图结构往往是不完整和噪声，这阻碍了时间图网络(TGNs)学习信息表示。图形对比学习使用数据增强来生成现有数据的合理变化，并学习健壮的表示。然而，基于规则的增强方法可能是次优的，因为它们缺乏可学性，并且无法从下游任务中利用丰富的信息。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种基于时间图序列预测的时间感知图结构学习(TGSL)方法，该方法通过增加潜在的时间边来学习下游任务的图结构。特别是，它预测基于先前观察到的交互的时间感知上下文嵌入，并使用 Gumble-Top-K 选择最接近这种上下文嵌入的候选边缘。此外，本文还提出了几种候选抽样策略，以保证抽样的有效性和多样性。此外，我们还以端到端的方式共同学习图的结构和 TGN，并对精化后的图进行推理。通过对时间链路预测基准的大量实验表明，TGSL 在 TGAT 和 GraphMixer 等流行的时间链路预测基准上取得了显著的效果，并且在时间图上优于其他对比学习方法。我们将来会发布代码。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Time-aware+Graph+Structure+Learning+via+Sequence+Prediction+on+Temporal+Graphs)|0|

In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal learning framework with mask and contrast enhancements to capture spatio-temporal variabilities among city regions. We devise a mask-enhanced pre-training task to learn latent correlations across the spatial and temporal dimensions, and then a graph-based method is developed to extract the significance of regions by using the inter-regional attention weights.

Our experiments demonstrate that this co-training approach leads to a significant improvement in performance. Especially, by leveraging the complementary information from different views, our proposed TS-CoT method can mitigate the impact of data noise and corruption.

Gupta, Jingbo Shang|Amazon, Seattle, WA, USA; University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA|Current human activity recognition (HAR) techniques regard activity labels as integer class IDs without explicitly modeling the semantics of class labels. We observe that different activity names often have shared structures. For example, "open door" and "open fridge" both have "open" as the action; "kicking soccer ball" and "playing tennis ball" both have "ball" as the object. Such shared structures in label names can be translated to the similarity in sensory data and modeling common structures would help uncover knowledge across different activities, especially for activities with limited samples. In this paper, we propose SHARE, a HAR framework that takes into account shared structures of label names for different activities. To exploit the shared structures, SHARE comprises an encoder for extracting features from input sensory time series and a decoder for generating label names as a token sequence. We also propose three label augmentation techniques to help the model more effectively capture semantic structures across activities, including a basic token-level augmentation, and two enhanced embedding-level and sequence-level augmentations utilizing the capabilities of pre-trained models. SHARE outperforms state-of-the-art HAR models in extensive experiments on seven HAR benchmark datasets.

Despite the recent progress of large-scale MMKGs, existing MMKGs neglect the multi-aspect nature of entities, limiting the ability to comprehend entities from various perspectives. In this paper, we construct AspectMMKG, the first MMKG with aspect-related images by matching images to different entity aspects. Specifically, we collect aspect-related images from a knowledge base, and further extract aspect-related sentences from the knowledge base as queries to retrieve a large number of aspect-related images via an online image search engine.

To ensure the data privacy, systems commonly require users to securely keep their private keys. Thus, the secure storage of private keys is an important issue in these systems. However, existing key-management schemes commonly rely on a Trusted Third Party (TTP), which raises critical security concerns such as the single point of failure and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. In this paper, we propose HasDPSS, a secure and efficient blockchain-based key-management scheme for decentralized storage systems. It uses secret sharing, a lightweight cryptographic technique, to build the decentralized key-management scheme. Considering that the reliability of managing participants has inherent heterogeneity, we introduce the hierarchical access structure to achieve fine-grained key management. Meanwhile, to adapt the node churn of decentralized key management, HasDPSS enables a dynamic management committee to provide reliable services with a proactive refresh mechanism while protecting the integrity and security of private keys. In our design, we use the dimension switch method of polynomials in the evolving process to achieve the committee change of the hierarchical access structure. The reliability of participants is guaranteed by the customized commitment protocol and the immutable property of the blockchain. We thoroughly analyze security strengths and conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the practicality of our design.|随着分散存储的广泛发展，用户将数据存储到分散数据库系统中以获得外包存储的好处越来越受欢迎。为了确保数据的私密性，系统通常要求用户安全地保存他们的私钥。因此，私钥的安全存储是这些系统中的一个重要问题。然而，现有的密钥管理方案通常依赖可信第三方(tTP) ，这引起了严重的安全问题，例如单点故障和分布式分布式拒绝服务攻击(dDoS)攻击。本文提出了一种基于区块链的分散存储系统密钥管理方案 HasDPSS。它使用秘密共享这种轻量级密码技术来构建分散式密钥管理方案。考虑到管理参与者的可靠性具有内在的异构性，引入分层访问结构实现细粒度密钥管理。同时，为了适应分散密钥管理的节点流失，HasDPSS 使得动态管理委员会能够在保护私钥完整性和安全性的同时，通过主动刷新机制提供可靠的服务。在我们的设计中，我们使用多项式在演化过程中的维数切换方法来实现层级访问结构的委员会变化。定制的承诺协议和区块链的不变性保证了参与者的可靠性。我们深入分析了安全优势，并进行了广泛的实验，以证明我们的设计的实用性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Towards+Dynamic+and+Reliable+Private+Key+Management+for+Hierarchical+Access+Structure+in+Decentralized+Storage)|0|

Evaluating the changes in protein properties upon protein mutation is a fundamental application of protein design, where modeling the 3D protein structure is a principal task for AI-driven computational approaches. Existing deep learning (DL) approaches represent the protein structure as a 3D geometric graph and simplify the graph modeling to different degrees, thereby failing to capture the low-level atom patterns and high-level amino acid patterns simultaneously. In addition, limited training samples with ground truth labels and protein structures further restrict the effectiveness of DL approaches. In this paper, we propose a new graph learning framework, Hierarchical Graph Invariant Network (HGIN), a fine-grained and data-efficient graph neural encoder for encoding protein structures and predicting the mutation effect on protein properties. For fine-grained modeling, HGIN hierarchically models the low-level interactions of atoms and the high-level interactions of amino acid residues by Graph Neural Networks. For data efficiency, HGIN preserves the invariant encoding for atom permutation and coordinate transformation, which is an intrinsic inductive bias of property prediction that bypasses data augmentations. We integrate HGIN into a Siamese network to predict the quantitative effect on protein properties upon mutations. Our approach outperforms 9 state-of-the-art approaches on 3 protein datasets.

Furthermore, we optimize the discriminator in adversarial imitation in a pairwise manner, and the theoretical analysis shows that the pairwise discriminator would improve the generation quality.

|[Highly-Optimized Forgetting for Creating Signature-Based Views of Ontologies](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614771)|Yizheng Zhao|Nanjing University, Nanjing, China|Uniform interpolation (UI) is a non-standard reasoning service that seeks to project an ontology down to its sub-signature --- given an ontology taking a certain signature, and a subset Σ of "relevant names'' of that signature, compute a new ontology, called a uniform interpolant, that uses only the relevant names while preserving the semantics of the relevant names in the uniform interpolant. UI is of great potential importance since it may be used in a variety of applications where suitable views of ontologies need to be computed. However, this potential can only be fully realized if a highly optimized method for computing such views exists. Previous research has shown that computing uniform interpolants of ELH-ontologies is a computationally extremely hard problem --- a finite uniform interpolant does not always exist for ELH, and if it exists, then there exists one of at most triple exponential size in terms of the original ontology, and that, in the worst case, no shorter interpolant exists. Despite the inherent difficulty of the problem, in this paper, we present a highly optimized forgetting method for computing uniform interpolants of ELH-ontologies, and show however that, with good reduction and inference strategies, such uniform interpolants can be efficiently computed. The method is an improvement of the one presented in our previous work. What sets it apart is its flexibility to treat concept names of different types differently, effectively cutting down on the inferences involved.

|[Unveiling the Role of Message Passing in Dual-Privacy Preservation on GNNs](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615104)|Tianyi Zhao, Hui Hu, Lu Cheng|University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA; Wyoming University, Larami, WY, USA; University of Illinois Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA|Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for learning representations on graphs, such as social networks. However, their vulnerability to privacy inference attacks restricts their practicality, especially in high-stake domains. To address this issue, privacy-preserving GNNs have been proposed, focusing on preserving node and/or link privacy. This work takes a step back and investigates how GNNs contribute to privacy leakage. Through theoretical analysis and simulations, we identify message passing under structural bias as the core component that allows GNNs to \textit{propagate} and \textit{amplify} privacy leakage. Building upon these findings, we propose a principled privacy-preserving GNN framework that effectively safeguards both node and link privacy, referred to as dual-privacy preservation. The framework comprises three major modules: a Sensitive Information Obfuscation Module that removes sensitive information from node embeddings, a Dynamic Structure Debiasing Module that dynamically corrects the structural bias, and an Adversarial Learning Module that optimizes the privacy-utility trade-off. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed model in protecting both node and link privacy while preserving high utility for downstream tasks, such as node classification.|图形神经网络(GNN)是学习图形表示的强大工具，例如社交网络。然而，它们易受隐私推断攻击的弱点限制了它们的实用性，尤其是在高风险领域。为了解决这个问题，提出了保护隐私的 GNN，重点是保护节点和/或链路的隐私。这项工作退一步来研究 GNN 是如何导致隐私泄露的。通过理论分析和仿真，我们确定了结构偏差下的消息传递是 GNN 发送传播信息和发送放大隐私泄露信息的核心组件。在这些发现的基础上，我们提出了一个原则性的隐私保护 GNN 框架，有效地保护节点和链路的隐私，称为双重隐私保护。该框架由三个主要模块组成: 一个敏感信息模糊模块，从节点嵌入中删除敏感信息; 一个动态结构消偏模块，动态纠正结构偏差; 以及一个对抗性学习模块，优化隐私-效用的权衡。在四个基准数据集上的实验结果验证了该模型在保护节点和链路隐私的同时，对下游任务(如节点分类)保持较高效用的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Unveiling+the+Role+of+Message+Passing+in+Dual-Privacy+Preservation+on+GNNs)|0|

However, the collected human/vehicle trajectory flows are usually rather unreliable, may contain various noise and sometimes are incomplete, thus posing great challenges to existing approaches. In this paper, we present a pioneering study on robust fine-grained urban flow inference with noisy and incomplete urban flow observations, and propose a denoising diffusion model named DiffUFlow to effectively address it. Specifically, we propose an improved reverse diffusion strategy. A spatial-temporal feature extraction network called STFormer and a semantic features extraction network called ELFetcher are also proposed. Then, we overlay the spatial-temporal feature map extracted by STFormer onto the coarse-grained flow map, serving as a conditional guidance for the reverse diffusion process. We further integrate the semantic features extracted by ELFetcher to cross-attention layers, enabling the comprehensive consideration of semantic information encompassing the entirety of urban data in fine-grained inference. Extensive experiments on two large real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our method compared with the state-of-the-art baselines.|基于粗粒度流观测的细粒度城市流推断对于智能城市相关应用具有重要的实际意义。然而，收集的人/车轨迹流通常是相当不可靠的，可能包含各种噪声，有时是不完整的，从而对现有的方法提出了巨大的挑战。本文首次提出了一种基于噪声和不完全城市流量观测的鲁棒细粒度城市流量推断方法，并提出了一种去噪扩散模型，称之为 DISUFlow，以有效地解决这一问题。具体来说，我们提出了一种改进的反向扩散策略。提出了一种时空特征提取网络 STForm 和一种语义特征提取网络 ELFetcher。在此基础上，将时空特征图叠加到粗粒度流图上，作为反向扩散过程的条件指导。我们进一步将 ELfetcher 提取的语义特征整合到交叉注意层，使得我们能够在细粒度推理中全面考虑包含整个城市数据的语义信息。在两个大型真实世界数据集上的大量实验验证了我们的方法与最先进的基线相比的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=DiffUFlow:+Robust+Fine-grained+Urban+Flow+Inference+with+Denoising+Diffusion+Model)|0|

However, the unobserved confounders (e.g., the characteristic of each region) correlate with the strength of typhoon weather and also affect human mobility during typhoon, which may generate biased influences on the causal analysis process. Besides, these confounders may be time-varying following the dynamic movements of typhoon. In this work, we develop a neural network-based continuous causal effect estimation framework to mitigate the interference from (unobserved) confounders and assess the continuous causal responses of typhoon-related weather (treatment) on several types of human mobility (outcome) across different counties at any given period. To this end, we integrate the big data from two huge typhoons in Japan (i.e., Typhoon Faxai and Hagibis) and leverage multiple sources of covariates (i.e., residents' vigilance and basic mobility patterns) from different counties to learn the representations of time-varying confounders. The experimental results indicate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in capturing the confounders for quantifying the causal impact of extreme weather during the typhoon process, compared with several existing causal studies.|为了了解台风过后的人员流动情况，分析极端台风天气对人员流动的影响对灾害应急管理具有重要意义。但未观测到的混杂因素(如各区域的特征)与台风天气强度相关，并影响台风期间的人口流动，可能对因果分析过程产生偏差影响。此外，这些混杂因子可能随台风的动态变化而变化。在这项工作中，我们开发了一个基于神经网络的连续因果效应估计框架，以减轻(未观察到的)混杂因素的干扰，并评估台风相关天气(处理)对几种类型的人口流动(结果)的连续因果响应，在不同的县在任何给定的时期。为此，我们整合了来自日本两个巨大台风(即台风法赛和哈吉比斯)的大数据，并利用来自不同县的多个协变量来源(即居民的警觉性和基本流动模式)来学习时变混杂因素的表征。实验结果表明，与已有的因果关系研究相比，我们提出的框架在捕获混杂因子以量化台风过程中极端天气的因果影响方面是有效的。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Assessing+the+Continuous+Causal+Responses+of+Typhoon-related+Weather+on+Human+Mobility:+An+Empirical+Study+in+Japan)|0|

The lack of prior knowledge of the ground-truth anomaly has been a major obstacle in acquiring fine-grained annotations (e.g., anomalous nodes), therefore, a plethora of existing methods have been developed either with a limited number of node-level supervision or in an unsupervised manner. Nonetheless, annotations for coarse-grained graph elements (e.g., a suspicious group of nodes), which often require marginal human effort in terms of time and expertise, are comparatively easier to obtain. Therefore, it is appealing to investigate anomaly detection in a weakly-supervised setting and to establish the intrinsic relationship between annotations at different levels of granularity. In this paper, we tackle the challenging problem of weakly-supervised graph anomaly detection with coarse-grained supervision by (1) proposing a novel architecture of graph neural network with attention mechanism named WEDGE that can identify the critical node-level anomaly given a few labels of anomalous subgraphs, and (2) designing a novel objective with contrastive loss that facilitates node representation learning by enforcing distinctive representations between normal and abnormal graph elements.

The main issues with existing FL frameworks stem from a lack of interpretability and targeted privacy protections. To cope with these, we proposed Disentangled Federated Learning for Privacy (DFLP) which employes disentanglement, one of interpretability techniques, in private FL frameworks. Since sensitive properties are client-specific in nature, our main idea is to turn this feature into a tool that strikes the balance between data privacy and FL model performance, enabling the sensitive attributes to be private. DFLP disentangles the client-specific and class-invariant attributes to mask the sensitive attributes precisely. To our knowledge, this is the first work that successfully integrates disentanglement and the nature of sensitive attributes to achieve privacy protection while ensuring high FL model performance.

Existing approaches, which directly model the correlation between price and occupancy, have limitations in improving occupancy prediction accuracy while ensuring interpretability for dynamic pricing. Moreover, these methods struggle to address the significant data sparsity issue in hotel pricing scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Causality-driven Hotel Dynamic Pricing Model (CANDY) that captures the essential causal relationship between price and occupancy, enhancing occupancy prediction accuracy and interpretability for dynamic pricing. Specifically, we decompose confounders into three orthogonal groups of factors: characteristic factors, competitive factors, and temporal factors, and design submodules to capture the features of each dimension. To address the treatment bias and sample imbalance issues faced by existing causal inference methods in hotel pricing scenarios, we propose a novel data augmentation method based on the monotonic relationship between price and occupancy, and further design a multi-task learning framework tailored to multi-valued treatment scenarios, simultaneously alleviating the data sparsity issue. Both offline and online experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CANDY in occupancy prediction and dynamic pricing. CANDY has been successfully deployed to provide price suggestion service at Fliggy, a leading OTP in China, serving thousands of hotel operators.|在线旅游平台(OTP)的广泛应用导致人们越来越关注酒店动态定价算法，这直接影响到平台和酒店的收入。现有的方法直接模拟价格与入住率之间的相关性，在提高入住率预测精度的同时保证动态定价的可解释性方面存在局限性。此外，这些方法很难解决酒店定价场景中的重大数据稀疏问题。为了克服这些限制，我们提出了一个新的因果关系驱动的酒店动态定价模型(CANDY) ，捕捉价格和入住率之间的基本因果关系，提高入住率预测的准确性和动态定价的可解释性。具体来说，我们将混杂因素分解为三组正交的因素: 特征因素、竞争因素和时间因素，并设计子模块来捕获每个维度的特征。针对现有因果推理方法在酒店定价场景中存在的治疗偏差和样本不平衡问题，提出了一种基于价格与入住率单调关系的数据增强方法，并进一步设计了适合多值治疗场景的多任务学习框架，同时缓解了数据稀疏问题。离线和在线实验都证明了 CANDY 在入住率预测和动态定价方面的有效性。CANDY 已成功部署于 Fliggy，为数以千计的酒店运营商提供价格建议服务。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=CANDY:+A+Causality-Driven+Model+for+Hotel+Dynamic+Pricing)|0|

Flach, Raúl SantosRodríguez|University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom|Transparency in AI models is crucial to designing, auditing, and deploying AI systems. However, 'black box' models are still used in practice for their predictive power despite their lack of transparency. This has led to a demand for post-hoc, model-agnostic surrogate explainers which provide explanations for decisions of any model by approximating its behaviour close to a query point with a surrogate model. However, it is often overlooked how the location of the query point in the decision surface of the black box model affects the faithfulness of the surrogate explainer. Here, we show that when using standard techniques, there is a decrease in agreement between the black box and the surrogate model for query points towards the edge of the test dataset and when moving away from the decision boundary. This originates from a mismatch between the data distributions used to train and evaluate surrogate explainers. We address this by leveraging knowledge about the test data distribution captured in the class labels of the black box model. By addressing this and encouraging users to take care in understanding the alignment of training and evaluation objectives, we empower them to construct more faithful surrogate explainers.|人工智能模型的透明度对于人工智能系统的设计、审核和部署至关重要。然而，尽管缺乏透明度，“黑匣子”模型在实践中仍然被用来预测未来。这导致了对事后的、模型无关的代理解释器的需求，这些代理解释器通过使用代理模型在接近查询点的地方近似模型的行为，为任何模型的决策提供解释。然而，人们往往忽视了查询点在黑盒模型决策表面中的位置对代理解释器的忠实性的影响。在这里，我们展示了当使用标准技术时，黑匣子和查询点的替代模型之间的一致性在测试数据集的边缘以及远离决策边界时有所下降。这源于用于训练和评估代理解释器的数据分布之间的不匹配。我们通过利用在黑盒模型的类标签中捕获的关于测试数据分布的知识来解决这个问题。通过解决这个问题，并鼓励用户注意理解培训和评估目标的一致性，我们授权他们构建更忠实的代理解释器。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Reconciling+Training+and+Evaluation+Objectives+in+Location+Agnostic+Surrogate+Explainers)|0|

Variant calling is a key task performed on an individual's genome to identify different types of variants. Knowing these variants can lead to new advances in disease diagnosis and treatment. In this work, we propose a new approach for accelerating variant calling pipelines on a large workload of human genomes using a commodity cluster with graphics processing units (GPUs). Our approach has two salient features: First, it enables a pipeline stage to use GPUs and/or CPUs based on the availability of resources in the cluster. Second, it employs a mutual exclusion strategy for executing a pipeline stage on the GPUs of a cluster node so that the stages (for other sequences) can be executed using CPUs if needed. We evaluated our approach on a 8-node cluster with bare metal servers and virtual machines (VMs) containing different types of GPUs.

Most existing pre-training strategies usually choose the popular Graph neural networks (GNNs), which can be seen as a special form of low-pass filter, fail to effectively capture heterophily. In this paper, we first present an experimental investigation exploring the performance of low-pass and high-pass filters in heterophily graph classification, where the results clearly show that high-frequency signal is important for learning heterophily graph representation. On the other hand, it is still unclear how to effectively capture the structural pattern of graphs and how to measure the capability of the self-supervised pre-training strategy in capturing graph structure. To address the problem, we first design a quantitative metric to Measure Graph Structure (MGS), which analyzes correlation between structural similarity and embedding similarity of graph pairs. Then, to enhance the graph structural information captured by self-supervised learning, we propose a novel self-supervised strategy for Pre-training GNNs based on the Metric (PGM).

However, many real-world graphs are heterophilous, challenging the homophily assumption of classical GNNs. To solve the universality problem, many studies deepen networks or concatenate intermediate representations, which does not inherently change neighbor aggregation and introduces noise. Recent studies propose new metrics to characterize the homophily, but rarely consider the correlation of the proposed metrics and models. In this paper, we first design a new metric, Neighborhood Homophily (NH), to measure the label complexity or purity in node neighborhoods. Furthermore, we incorporate the metric into the classical graph convolutional network (GCN) architecture and propose Neighborhood Homophily-based Graph Convolutional Network (NHGCN). In this framework, neighbors are grouped by estimated NH values and aggregated from different channels, and the resulting node predictions are then used in turn to estimate and update NH values. The two processes of metric estimation and model inference are alternately optimized to achieve better node classification. NHGCN achieves top overall performance on both homophilous and heterophilous benchmarks, with an improvement of up to 7.4% compared to the current SOTA methods.|图神经网络(GNN)已被证明在面向图的任务中是强大的。然而，许多现实世界的图是异质的，挑战了经典 GNN 的同质假设。为了解决通用性问题，许多研究深化了网络或级联了中间表示，这种方法本身并不改变邻居聚集，而是引入了噪声。最近的研究提出了新的度量来表征同质性，但很少考虑提出的度量和模型的相关性。在本文中，我们首先设计了一个新的度量，邻域同伦(NH) ，来度量标签的复杂度或节点邻域的纯度。此外，我们将度量结合到经典的图卷积网络(GCN)体系结构中，并提出了基于邻域同构的图卷积网络(NHGCN)。在这个框架中，根据估计的 NH 值对邻居进行分组，并从不同的通道汇总，然后使用所得到的节点预测来估计和更新 NH 值。交替优化度量估计和模型推理两个过程，以实现更好的节点分类。NHGCN 在同质性和异质性基准测试上都取得了最好的总体性能，与目前的 SOTA 方法相比提高了7.4% 。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Neighborhood+Homophily-based+Graph+Convolutional+Network)|0|

In this paper, we propose data augmentation via natural language backtranslation to extract latent occurrences of aspects. We presume that backtranslation (1) can reveal latent aspects because they may not be commonly known in the target language and can be generated through backtranslation; (2) augments context-aware synonymous aspects from a target language to the original language, hence addressing the out-of-vocabulary issue; and (3) helps with the semantic disambiguation of polysemous words and collocations.

|[Stochastic Subgraph Neighborhood Pooling for Subgraph Classification](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615227)|Shweta Ann Jacob, Paul Louis, Amirali SalehiAbari|University of Ontario Institute of Technology, Oshawa, ON, Canada|Subgraph classification is an emerging field in graph representation learning where the task is to classify a group of nodes (i.e., a subgraph) within a graph. Subgraph classification has applications such as predicting the cellular function of a group of proteins or identifying rare diseases given a collection of phenotypes. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are the de facto solution for node, link, and graph-level tasks but fail to perform well on subgraph classification tasks. Even GNNs tailored for graph classification are not directly transferable to subgraph classification as they ignore the external topology of the subgraph, thus failing to capture how the subgraph is located within the larger graph. The current state-of-the-art models for subgraph classification address this shortcoming through either labeling tricks or multiple message-passing channels, both of which impose a computation burden and are not scalable to large graphs. To address the scalability issue while maintaining generalization, we propose Stochastic Subgraph Neighborhood Pooling (SSNP), which jointly aggregates the subgraph and its neighborhood (i.e., external topology) information without any computationally expensive operations such as labeling tricks. To improve scalability and generalization further, we also propose a simple data augmentation pre-processing step for SSNP that creates multiple sparse views of the subgraph neighborhood. We show that our model is more expressive than GNNs without labeling tricks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our models outperform current state-of-the-art methods (with a margin of up to 2%) while being up to 3X faster in training.|子图分类是图表示学习中的一个新兴领域，其任务是对图中的一组节点(即子图)进行分类。子图分类的应用，如预测一组蛋白质的细胞功能或鉴定罕见疾病的表型集合。图神经网络(GNN)是节点、链路和图级任务的实际解决方案，但在子图分类任务中表现不佳。即使是专门用于图分类的 GNN 也不能直接转移到子图分类，因为它们忽略了子图的外部拓扑结构，因此无法捕捉子图在较大图中的位置。目前最先进的子图分类模型通过标记技巧或多个消息传递通道来解决这一缺陷，这两种方法都增加了计算负担，而且不能扩展到大图。为了在保持泛化的同时解决可扩展性问题，我们提出了随机子图邻域池(SSNP) ，它不需要任何计算代价高昂的操作，如标记技巧，就可以联合聚集子图及其邻域(即外部拓扑)信息。为了进一步提高可扩展性和泛化能力，我们还提出了一个简单的数据增强预处理步骤，用于产生子图邻域的多个稀疏视图。我们展示了我们的模型比没有标记技巧的 GNN 更有表现力。我们广泛的实验表明，我们的模型表现优于目前的最先进的方法(利润率高达2%) ，同时在训练快达3倍。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Stochastic+Subgraph+Neighborhood+Pooling+for+Subgraph+Classification)|0|

This dilemma arises from the numerous zeros and over-dispersed demand patterns within these matrices, which challenge the Gaussian assumption inherent to deterministic deep learning models. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach: the Spatial-Temporal Tweedie Graph Neural Network (STTD). The STTD introduces the Tweedie distribution as a compelling alternative to the traditional 'zero-inflated' model and leverages spatial and temporal embeddings to parameterize travel demand distributions.

Specifically, S-Mixup obtains pseudo-labels for unlabeled nodes in a graph along with their prediction confidence via a Graph Neural Network (GNN) classifier. These serve as the criteria for the composition of the mixup pool for both inter and intra-class mixups. Furthermore, we utilize the edge gradient obtained from the GNN training and propose a gradient-based edge selection strategy for selecting edges to be attached to the nodes generated by the mixup. Through extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of S-Mixup evaluated on the node classification task. We observe that S-Mixup enhances the robustness and generalization performance of GNNs, especially in heterophilous situations.

As the survival rates for childhood cancer around the world have increased, survivors often face various psychosocial challenges during and after cancer treatment. However, they rarely seek support from psychosocial professionals due to the low availability of resources and stigma toward cancer survivors in countries like South Korea. This study aimed to develop a chatbot tailed to the unique characteristics of childhood cancer survivors in need of informational and emotional support. Given the limited availability of empirical data on childhood cancer survivors, quotes from survivors were gathered from academic articles and social media, then large language models were employed to generate appropriate responses. Furthermore, we incorporated domain learning techniques to ensure a more tailored and suitable model for addressing the needs of survivors.|这项研究为儿童癌症幸存者介绍了一个信息和移情聊天机器人。随着世界各地儿童癌症存活率的提高，幸存者在癌症治疗期间和治疗后往往面临各种心理社会挑战。然而，他们很少寻求社会心理学专业人士的支持，因为在韩国等国家，资源的可用性很低，癌症幸存者也被视为耻辱。这项研究旨在开发一个聊天机器人尾随儿童癌症幸存者的独特特征，需要信息和情感支持。鉴于儿童癌症幸存者的经验数据有限，从学术文章和社交媒体中收集幸存者的引文，然后使用大型语言模型来产生适当的反应。此外，我们纳入了领域学习技术，以确保更加量身定制和适当的模式，以满足幸存者的需求。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Can+a+Chatbot+be+Useful+in+Childhood+Cancer+Survivorship?+Development+of+a+Chatbot+for+Survivors+of+Childhood+Cancer)|0|

Its primary objectives include determining the intention and attack likelihood of the hostiles. The complex, dynamic, and noisy nature of combat, however, presents significant challenges in its analysis. The prior research has been limited in accounting for such characteristics, assuming independence of each entity, no unobserved tactics, and clean combat data. As such, we present spatio-temporal attention for threat analysis (SAFETY) to encode complex interactions that arise within combat. We test the model performance for unobserved tactics and with various perturbations. To do so, we also present the first open-source benchmark for combat threat analysis with two downstream tasks of predicting entity intention and attack probability. Our experiments show that SAFETY achieves a significant improvement in model performance, with enhancements of up to 13% in intention prediction and 7% in attack prediction compared to the strongest competitor, even when confronted with noisy or missing data. This result highlights the importance of encoding dynamic interactions among entities for combat threat analysis.

The main challenge of continual learning is catastrophic interference, wherein new knowledge overrides or interferes with past knowledge, leading to forgetting. An associated issue is the problem of learning "cross-task knowledge," where models fail to acquire and retain knowledge that helps differentiate classes across task boundaries. A common solution to both problems is "replay," where a limited buffer of past instances is utilized to learn cross-task knowledge and mitigate catastrophic interference. However, a notable drawback of these methods is their tendency to overfit the limited replay buffer. In contrast, our proposed solution, SurpriseNet, addresses catastrophic interference by employing a parameter isolation method and learning cross-task knowledge using an auto-encoder inspired by anomaly detection. SurpriseNet is applicable to both structured and unstructured data, as it does not rely on image-specific inductive biases. We have conducted empirical experiments demonstrating the strengths of SurpriseNet on various traditional vision continual-learning benchmarks, as well as on structured data datasets.

However, current methods are based on graph neural networks, which suffer from the over-smoothing issue and easily yield indistinguishable node representations, degrading the prediction accuracy.

To solve these issues, we design a cross-view graph contrastive learning (GCL) framework for TLP, called Tacl. We first design two augmented views for GCL by enhancing the temporal and topological information to obtain distinguishable node representations.

It remains, however, a challenging task, particularly for significant large-scale relations and in the presence of easily confused relations. Recent state-of-the-art methods not only struggle with such scenarios, but often take into account only one facet and fail to incorporate the subtle discrepancy among the relations. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient three-stage framework to exploit the coarse-to-fine paradigm. Specifically, we employ a natural clustering over all KB relations and perform a coarse-to-fine relation recognition process based on the relation clustering. In this way, our framework (i.e., CORD) refines the detection of relations, so as to scale well with large-scale relations. Experiments on both single-relation (i.e., SimpleQuestions (SQ)) and multi-relation (i.e., WebQSP (WQ)) benchmarks show that CORD not only achieves the outstanding relation detection performance in KBQA-RD subtask; but more importantly, further improves the accuracy of KBQA systems.|关系检测作为知识库问题回答(KBQA)的一个基本子任务，对于检测自然语言问题中实体或变量之间的知识库关系起着至关重要的作用。然而，这仍然是一项具有挑战性的任务，特别是对于重大的大规模关系和容易混淆的关系。最近的最先进的方法不仅与这种情况作斗争，而且往往只考虑一个方面，而且未能纳入关系之间的微妙差异。在本文中，我们提出了一个简单而有效的三阶段框架来开发从粗到精的范式。具体来说，我们在所有知识库关系上采用自然聚类，并在关系聚类的基础上进行从粗到精的关系识别过程。通过这种方式，我们的框架(即 CORD)改进了关系的检测，从而可以很好地扩展大规模关系。在单关系(SimpleQuestions，SQ)和多关系(WebQSP，WQ)基准上的实验表明，CORD 不仅在 KBQA-RD 子任务中取得了优异的关系检测性能，更重要的是进一步提高了 KBQA 系统的准确性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=CORD:+A+Three-Stage+Coarse-to-Fine+Framework+for+Relation+Detection+in+Knowledge+Base+Question+Answering)|0|

However, existing work tends to explore group characteristics with a coarse-grained perspective while ignoring the inter-individual variability within groups, which is prone to unstable diagnosis results. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel Homogeneous cohort-aware Group Cognitive Diagnosis model, namely HomoGCD, to effectively model the group's knowledge proficiency level from a multi-grained modeling perspective. Specifically, we first design a homogeneous cohort mining module to explore subgroups of students with similar ability status within a class by modeling their routine exercising performance. Then, we construct the mined cohorts into fine-grained organizations for exploring stable and uniformly distributed features of groups. Subsequently, we develop a multi-grained modeling module to comprehensively learn the cohort and group ability status, which jointly trains both interactions with the exercises. In particular, an extensible diagnosis module is introduced to support the incorporation of different diagnosis functions.

Additionally, these methods often require extra information beyond the infection data, which is typically unavailable in reality. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel epidemiology-aware deep learning framework that integrates a fundamental epidemic component, the next-generation matrix (NGM), into the deep architecture and objective function. This integration enables the inclusion of both mechanistic models and human mobility in the learning process to characterize within- and cross-location disease transmission.

The previous multivariate fusion transformation fuses the feature of different variates at a time step, then projects them to a new feature space for effective feature representation.

The previous manner fails to capture the temporal dependency of the feature, which is destroyed in the transformed feature matrix. Multivariate feature extraction based on the feature matrix with missing temporal dependency leads to the loss of predictive performance of MTSP. To address this problem, we propose the Temporal Dependency Priority for Multivariate Time Series Prediction (TemDep) method. Specifically, TemDep extracts feature temporal dependency of multivariate time series first and then considers multivariate feature fusion. Moreover, the low-dimensional and high-dimensional feature fusion manners are designed with the temporal dependency priority to fit different dimensional multivariate time series. The extensive experimental results of different datasets show that our proposed method can outperform all state-of-the-art baseline methods.

The crux of this task is to change only age-related areas of the given image while maintaining the age-irrelevant areas unchanged. Nevertheless, a common limitation among most existing models is the struggle to generate high-quality aging images that effectively consider both crucial properties. To address this problem, we propose a novel GAN-based face-aging framework that utilizes age-aware Guidance via Masking-Based Attention (GMBA).

|[Metapath-Guided Data-Augmentation For Knowledge Graphs](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615186)|Saurav Manchanda|Instacart, San Francisco, CA, USA|Knowledge graph (KG) embedding techniques use relationships between entities to learn low-dimensional representations of entities and relations. The traditional KG embedding techniques (such as TransE and DistMult) estimate these embeddings using the observed KG triplets and differ in their triplet scoring loss functions. As these models only use the observed triplets to estimate the embeddings, they are prone to suffer through data sparsity that usually occurs in the real-world knowledge graphs, i.e., the lack of enough triplets per entity. In this paper, we propose an efficient method to augment the triplets to address the problem of data sparsity. We use random walks to create additional triplets, such that the relations carried by these introduced triplets correspond to the metapath (sequence of underlying relations) induced by the random walks. We also provide approaches to accurately and efficiently choose the informative metapaths from the possible set of metapaths. The proposed augmentation approaches can be used with any KG embedding approach out of the box. Experimental results on benchmarks show the advantages of the proposed approach.|知识图(KG)嵌入技术利用实体之间的关系来学习实体和关系的低维表示。传统的 KG 嵌入技术(如 TransE 和 distMult)使用观察到的 KG 三联体估计这些嵌入，并且它们的三联体得分损失函数不同。由于这些模型只使用观察到的三联体来估计嵌入，因此它们容易遭受通常出现在现实世界知识图中的数据稀疏问题，即每个实体缺乏足够的三联体。在本文中，我们提出了一种有效的方法来增加三联体，以解决数据稀疏的问题。我们使用随机游走来创建额外的三联体，使得这些引入的三联体所携带的关系对应于由随机游走诱导的元路径(基础关系序列)。我们还提供了从可能的元路径集合中准确有效地选择信息元路径的方法。所提出的增广方法可以用于任何 KG 嵌入方法开箱即用。基准测试的实验结果表明了该方法的优越性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Metapath-Guided+Data-Augmentation+For+Knowledge+Graphs)|0|

However, during updates, there is a potential for performance degradation, in which the overall performance improves, but local performance deteriorates. This study proposes a backward compatibility metric that focuses on the compatibility of local predictive performance. The score of the proposed metric increases if the accuracy over the conditional distribution for each input is higher than before. Furthermore, we propose a model retraining method based on the proposed metric. Due to the use of the conditional distribution, our metric and retraining method are robust against label noises, while existing sample-based backward compatibility metrics are often affected by noise. We perform a theoretical analysis of our method and derive an upper bound for the generalization error. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our retraining method enhances compatibility while achieving equal or better trade-offs in overall performance compared to existing methods.|模型再训练和更新是人工智能应用中必不可少的环节。但是，在更新期间，存在性能下降的可能性，即总体性能提高，但局部性能下降。这项研究提出了一个向下兼容的衡量标准，着重于局部预测性能的兼容性。如果每个输入的条件分布的精度高于以前，则提出的度量的得分会增加。在此基础上，提出了一种基于该度量的模型再训练方法。由于使用了条件分布，我们的度量和再训练方法对标签噪声具有鲁棒性，而现有的基于样本的向下兼容度量常常受到噪声的影响。我们对这个方法进行了理论分析，得到了泛化误差的上界。数值实验表明，我们的再训练方法增强了兼容性，同时在整体性能方面取得了与现有方法相同或更好的平衡。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=A+Robust+Backward+Compatibility+Metric+for+Model+Retraining)|0|

Contrastive learning offers a straightforward and efficient unsupervised framework for graph representation learning. It achieves unsupervised learning by augmenting the original views and comparing them with the augmented views. Several methods based on this framework have achieved significant progress in the field of graph representation learning. Despite its success, the factors contributing to good augmented views in graph contrast learning have received less attention. In order to address this issue, we introduce the graph info-min principle.

Traditional methods like re-sampling and re-weighting address this issue by balancing class distribution. However, node class balancing with simple re-sampling or re-weighting may greatly distort the data distributions and eventually lead to the ineffective performance of GNNs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Graph Generative Node Augmentation (GGA), which improves GNN-based fraud detection models by augmenting synthetic nodes of the minority class. GGA utilizes the GAN framework to synthesize node features and related edges of fake fraudulent nodes. To introduce greater variety in the generated nodes, we employ an MLP for feature generation. We also introduce an attention module to encode feature-level information before graph convolutional layers for edge generation. Our empirical results on two real-world fraud datasets demonstrate that GGA improves the performance of GNN-based fraud detection models by a large margin with much fewer nodes than traditional class balance methods, and outperforms recent graph augmentation methods with the same number of synthetic nodes.|类不平衡是基于 GNN 的欺诈检测中公认的挑战。传统的方法如重新抽样和重新加权通过平衡类的分布来解决这个问题。然而，通过简单的重采样或重加权来实现节点类平衡，可能会严重扭曲数据分布，最终导致 GNN 的无效性能。本文提出了一种新的图生成节点增强(GGA)方法，通过增强少数类的合成节点来改进基于 GNN 的欺诈检测模型。GGA 利用 GAN 框架综合假冒节点的节点特征和相关边。为了在生成的节点中引入更大的多样性，我们使用 MLP 进行特征生成。在图卷积层之前引入注意模块对特征层信息进行编码，实现边缘生成。我们对两个实际欺诈数据集的实验结果表明，与传统的类平衡方法相比，GGA 在节点较少的情况下大大提高了基于 GNN 的欺诈检测模型的性能，并且在合成节点数相同的情况下优于现有的图增强方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Generative+Graph+Augmentation+for+Minority+Class+in+Fraud+Detection)|0|

Given the privacy requirements of medical data, institutes are un-willing to share data, causing an hindrance in resource poor settings. In the present paper, (Camaraderie: Content-based Knowledge Transfer for Medical Image Labelling using Supervised Autoencoders in a Decentralized Setting) we propose to use Discrete Classifier Supervised Autoencoder (DC-SAE) to generate low-dimensional representations of a few annotated images at the Donor client and transfer both the DC-SAE's encoder part and the latent space representations to the Recipient client without sharing raw data.

In a supervised setting, using latent space representation of Donor client's labelled images, we accurately annotate images of Recipient client. Camaraderie demonstrates that DC-SAE outperforms Recipient end label accuracy beyond classical VAE based classification and anomaly detection based VAE.

To address the first two challenges, we leverage Reward Randomization in combination with Bayesian Optimization to train agents to exhibit diverse strategic behaviors, thereby mitigating the issue of risky cooperation. To address the challenge of learning in a large number of agents, we utilize MAPPO with parameter sharing to enhance learning efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that within this multi-agent environment, agents can effectively learn multiple visually distinct behaviors, and the incorporation of these two techniques significantly improves agents' performance.|本文介绍了一种在复杂的多主体环境中促进行为多样性的新方法，它提出了三个挑战: 1)不同类型的主体之间的竞争或协作，2)需要复杂的多主体协作，这使得实现有风险的合作策略具有挑战性，3)环境中存在大量的主体，导致在考虑主体-主体关系时复杂性增加。为了解决前两个挑战，我们利用奖励随机化和贝叶斯优化相结合的方法来训练代理人展示多样化的战略行为，从而减轻风险合作的问题。为了解决大量智能体中学习的难题，我们利用参数共享的 MAPPO 来提高学习效率。实验结果表明，在这种多智能体环境下，智能体可以有效地学习多种视觉上不同的行为，这两种技术的结合显著提高了智能体的性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Promoting+Diversity+in+Mixed+Complex+Cooperative+and+Competitive+Multi-Agent+Environment)|0|

Most ADE are reported via an unstructured conversation with the medical context. Hence, applying a general entity recognition approach is not sufficient enough. The key is how to integrate and align multiple crucial aspects to detect drug event information, including drug event semantics, syntactic structures, and medical domain terminology. In this paper, we propose a new multi-aspect cross-integration framework for drug entity/event detection by capturing and aligning different context/language/knowledge properties from drug-related documents. We first construct multi-aspect encoders to describe semantic, syntactic, and medical document contextual information by conducting those slot tagging tasks, main drug entity/event detection, part-of-speech tagging, and general medical named entity recognition. Then, each encoder conducts cross integration and alignment with other contextual information in three ways, including the key-value cross, attention cross, and feedforward cross, so the multi-encoders are integrated in depth. Then, we perform extensive experiments on two widely used drug-related entity recognition downstream tasks, flat entity detection and discontinuous event extraction. Our model significantly outperforms all recent twelve state-of-the-art models.

Real-world graph data sets may not be balanced and accurate as assumed by most existing works. A challenging setting is positive-unlabeled (PU) node classification, where labeled nodes are restricted to positive nodes. It has diverse applications, e.g., pandemic prediction or network anomaly detection. Existing works on PU node classification overlook information in the graph structure, which can be critical. In this paper, we propose to better utilize graph structure for PU node classification. We first propose a distance-aware PU loss that uses homophily in graphs to introduce more accurate supervision. We also propose a regularizer to align the model with graph structure. Theoretical analysis shows that minimizing the proposed loss also leads to minimizing the expected loss with both positive and negative labels.

To achieve this, we repurposed the publicly available UCR Archive and evaluated four existing self-supervised learning-based pre-training methods, along with a novel method, on the datasets. We tested these methods using four popular neural network architectures for time series to understand how the pre-training methods interact with different network designs.

Sheng|Xavier University of Louisiana, New Orleans, LA, USA; Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA|Simplicial neural networks (SNNs) were proposed to generate higher-order simplicial complex representations as vectors that encode not only pairwise relationships but also higher-order interactions between nodes. Although these vectors allowing us to consider richer data representations compared to typical graph convolution, most real-world graphs associated with molecule or human-related activities are often sensitive and might contain confidential information, e.g., molecular geometry or friend lists. However, little works investigate the potential threats for these simplicial complexes (higher-order interactions between nodes). We name this threat by Simplicial Complexes Reconstruction Attack (SCRA) and conduct this attack by studying whether the vectors can be inverted to (approximately) recover the simplicial complexes who used to generate them. Specifically, we first generate the vectors via a k-simplex2vec approach that extends the node2vec algorithm to simplices of higher dimensions to associate Euclidean vectors to simplicial complexes. We then present a Simplex2vec Backward algorithm to perform the SCRA on k-simplex2vec vectors by pointwise mutual information (PMI) matrix reconstruction.|简单神经网络(SNN)被提出来生成高阶单纯复形表示，作为矢量，不仅编码成对的关系，而且编码节点之间的高阶相互作用。虽然这些向量允许我们考虑比典型的图卷积更丰富的数据表示，但大多数与分子或人类相关活动相关的现实世界图往往是敏感的，可能包含机密信息，例如分子结构或朋友列表。然而，很少有工作研究这些单纯复合体(节点之间的高阶相互作用)的潜在威胁。我们将这种威胁命名为简单复合体重构攻击(SCRA) ，并通过研究向量是否可以反转来(近似地)恢复用来产生它们的简单复合体来实施这种攻击。具体来说，我们首先通过 k-simplex2vec 方法生成向量，该方法将 node2vec 算法扩展到更高维的单纯形，以将欧氏向量关联到单纯形复合体。然后，我们提出了一个单纯形向量2/vec 向后算法，通过点间互信息矩阵重构(PMI)对 k- 单纯形向量2/vec 向量进行 SCRA。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Simplex2vec+Backward:+From+Vectors+Back+to+Simplicial+Complex)|0|
|[Unlocking the Potential of Deep Learning in Peak-Hour Series Forecasting](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615159)|Zhenwei Zhang, Xin Wang, Jingyuan Xie, Heling Zhang, Yuantao Gu|Tsinghua University, Beijing, China|Unlocking the potential of deep learning in Peak-Hour Series Forecasting (PHSF) remains a critical yet underexplored task in various domains. While state-of-the-art deep learning models excel in regular Time Series Forecasting (TSF), they struggle to achieve comparable results in PHSF. This can be attributed to the challenges posed by the high degree of non-stationarity in peak-hour series, which makes direct forecasting more difficult than standard TSF. Additionally, manually extracting the maximum value from regular forecasting results leads to suboptimal performance due to models minimizing the mean deficit. To address these issues, this paper presents Seq2Peak, a novel framework designed specifically for PHSF tasks, bridging the performance gap observed in TSF models. Seq2Peak offers two key components: the CyclicNorm pipeline to mitigate the non-stationarity issue and a simple yet effective trainable-parameter-free peak-hour decoder with a hybrid loss function that utilizes both the original series and peak-hour series as supervised signals. Extensive experimentation on publicly available time series datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework, yielding a remarkable average relative improvement of 37.7% across four real-world datasets for both transformer- and non-transformer-based TSF models.|在高峰时间序列预测(PHSF)中，挖掘深度学习的潜力仍然是各个领域中一个至关重要但尚未得到充分开发的课题。虽然最先进的深度学习模型在常规时间序列预测(TSF)中表现出色，但在 PHSF 中却难以取得可比较的结果。这可归因于高峰时段序列的高度非平稳性所带来的挑战，这使得直接预测比标准 TSF 更加困难。此外，由于模型的平均亏损最小，人工从常规预测结果中提取最大值会导致性能不理想。为了解决这些问题，本文提出了专门为 PHSF 任务设计的新框架 Seq2Peak，它弥补了 TSF 模型中观察到的性能差距。Seq2Peak 提供了两个关键组件: CyclicNorm 流水线以减轻非平稳性问题，以及一个简单而有效的无可训练参数的峰时解码器，该解码器具有利用原始序列和峰时序列作为监督信号的混合损耗功能。对公开可用的时间序列数据集的广泛实验证明了所提出的框架的有效性，在基于变压器和非变压器的 TSF 模型的四个现实世界数据集中产生了37.7% 的显着平均相对改善。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Unlocking+the+Potential+of+Deep+Learning+in+Peak-Hour+Series+Forecasting)|0|

Previous works only consider span length with some discrete distributions, while the dependencies among spans are ignored, i.e., assuming that the positions of masked spans are uniformly distributed. In this paper, we present POSPAN, a general framework to allow diverse position-constrained span masking strategies via the combination of span length distribution and position constraint distribution, which unifies all existing span-level masking methods. To verify the effectiveness of POSPAN in pre-training, we evaluate it on the datasets from several NLU benchmarks. Experimental results indicate that the position constraint is capable of enhancing span-level masking broadly, and our best POSPAN setting consistently outperforms its span-length-only counterparts and vanilla MLM. We also conduct theoretical analysis for the position constraint in masked language models to shed light on the reason why POSPAN works well, demonstrating the rationality and necessity of POSPAN.|跨层次的掩蔽语言建模(MLM)已经证明比原始的单标记 MLM 更有利于预先训练的语言模型，因为实体/短语及其依赖关系对语言理解至关重要。以往的工作只考虑跨度长度的离散分布，而跨度之间的依赖关系被忽略，即假设掩蔽跨度的位置是均匀分布的。本文提出了一种结合跨度长度分布和位置约束分布的 POSPAN 框架，该框架统一了现有的跨度级掩蔽方法，允许采用不同的位置约束跨度掩蔽策略。为了验证 POSPAN 在预训练中的有效性，我们从几个 NLU 基准数据集上对 POSPAN 进行了评估。实验结果表明，位置约束能够广泛地增强跨度级掩蔽，我们的最佳 POSPAN 设置始终优于其仅跨度长度的对手和普通的 MLM。本文还对掩蔽语言模型中的位置约束进行了理论分析，阐明了 POSPAN 语言运行良好的原因，论证了 POSPAN 语言运行的合理性和必要性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=POSPAN:+Position-Constrained+Span+Masking+for+Language+Model+Pre-training)|0|

Indeed, the paths between a pair of entities conform to a hierarchical structure. Specifically, there may be a number of paths between two entities, and each path is comprised of several relations. The hierarchical structure is able to provide precious information, and is beneficial to leverage the path information in a fine-grained manner. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel model named KG error detection with HiErarchical pAth stRucture (HEAR for short).

Chen|University of Turin, Turin, Italy; Delft University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands|An alternative method for sharing knowledge while complying with strict data access regulations, such as the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), is the emergence of synthetic tabular data. Mainstream table synthesizers utilize methodologies derived from Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). Although several state-of-the-art (SOTA) tabular GAN algorithms inherit Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based architectures, which have proven effective for images, they tend to overlook two critical properties of tabular data: (i) the global correlation across columns, and (ii) the semantic invariance to the column order. Permuting columns in a table does not alter the semantic meaning of the data, but features extracted by CNNs can change significantly due to their limited convolution filter kernel size. To address the above problems, we propose FCT-GAN the first conditional tabular GAN to adopt Fourier networks into table synthesis. FCT-GAN enhances permutation invariant GAN training by strengthening the learning of global correlations via Fourier layers. Extensive evaluation on benchmarks and real-world datasets show that FCT-GAN can synthesize tabular data with better (up to 27.8%) machine learning utility (i.e. a proxy of global correlations) and higher (up to 26.5%) statistical similarity to real data.

|[Continually-Adaptive Representation Learning Framework for Time-Sensitive Healthcare Applications](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615464)|Akash Choudhuri, Hankyu Jang, Alberto M. Segre, Philip M. Polgreen, Kishlay Jha, Bijaya Adhikari|The University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA|Continual learning has emerged as a powerful approach to address the challenges of non-stationary environments, allowing machine learning models to adapt to new data while retaining the previously acquired knowledge. In time-sensitive healthcare applications, where entities such as physicians, hospital rooms, and medications exhibit continuous changes over time, continual learning holds great promise, yet its application remains relatively unexplored. This paper aims to bridge this gap by proposing a novel framework, i.e., Continually-Adaptive Representation Learning, designed to adapt representations in response to changing data distributions in evolving healthcare applications. Specifically, the proposed approach develops a continual learning strategy wherein the context information (e.g., interactions) of healthcare entities is exploited to continually identify and retrain the representations of those entities whose context evolved over time. Moreover, different from existing approaches, the proposed approach leverages the valuable patient information present in clinical notes to generate accurate and robust healthcare embeddings. Notably, the proposed continually-adaptive representations have practical benefits in low-resource clinical settings where it is difficult to training machine learning models from scratch to accommodate the newly available data streams. Experimental evaluations on real-world healthcare datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in time-sensitive healthcare applications such as Clostridioides difficile (C.diff) Infection (CDI) incidence prediction task and medical intensive care unit transfer prediction task.|连续学习已成为解决非平稳环境挑战的有力方法，使机器学习模型能够适应新的数据，同时保留以前获得的知识。在时间敏感的医疗保健应用中，医生、医院病房和药物等实体随着时间的推移显示出持续的变化，持续学习具有很大的前景，但其应用仍然相对未被探索。本文旨在通过提出一个新的框架，即连续自适应表示学习来弥补这一差距，该框架旨在适应不断变化的医疗保健应用数据分布的变化。具体而言，所提出的方法开发了一种持续学习策略，其中利用医疗实体的上下文信息(例如，交互)来不断识别和重新训练那些其上下文随时间演变的实体的表示。此外，不同于现有的方法，建议的方法利用临床记录中存在的有价值的患者信息来生成准确和健壮的医疗保健嵌入。值得注意的是，提出的持续自适应表示在低资源临床环境中具有实际好处，因为在这些环境中难以从头开始训练机器学习模型以适应新的可用数据流。对现实世界医疗数据集的实验评估证明了我们的方法在时间敏感的医疗应用中的有效性，例如艰难梭状芽孢杆菌感染(cdiff)发病率预测任务和医疗重症监护室转移预测任务。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Continually-Adaptive+Representation+Learning+Framework+for+Time-Sensitive+Healthcare+Applications)|0|

A common practice of traditional methods to gather community-building information usually relies on manual collection, which is typically labor-intensive and time-consuming. To address these issues, we utilize the massive data generated from e-commerce delivery services and design a framework, AutoBuild, for fine-grained large-scale community-building labeling. AutoBuild consists of two main components: (i) a Location Candidate Detection Module that identifies potential building names and coordinates from multi-source delivery data, and (ii) a Progressive Building Matching Model that employs trajectory modeling, human behavior analysis, and heterogeneous graph alignment to match building names and coordinates. To evaluate the performance of AutoBuild, we applied it to two real-world multi-modal datasets from Beijing City and Chengdu City. The results reveal that AutoBuild significantly outperforms multiple baseline models by 50-meter accuracy of 81.8% and 100-meter accuracy of 95.9% in Beijing City.

However, the high dynamics and expensive updating costs of POIs pose a key roadblock for their urban applications. This is especially true for developing countries, where active economic activities lead to frequent POI updates (e.g., merchants closing down and new ones opening). Therefore, POI updating, i.e., detecting new POIs and different names of the same POIs (alias) to update the POI database, has become an urgent but challenging problem to address. In this paper, we attempt to answer the research question of how to detect and update large-scale POIs via a low-cost approach. To do so, we propose a novel framework called UrbanPOI, which formulates the POI updating problem as a tagging and detection problem based on multi-modal logistics delivery data.

In particular, estimating how a system might respond to external forcings or perturbations requires specialized labeled data or targeted simulations, which may be computationally intensive to generate at scale. In this study, we propose a novel solution to this challenge by utilizing a principle from statistical physics known as the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (FDT) to discover knowledge using an AI model that can rapidly produce scenarios for different external forcings. By leveraging FDT, we are able to extract information encoded in a large dataset produced by Earth System Models, which includes 8250 years of internal climate fluctuations, to estimate the climate system's response to forcings. Our model, AiBEDO, is capable of capturing the complex, multi-timescale effects of radiation perturbations on global and regional surface climate, allowing for a substantial acceleration of the exploration of the impacts of spatially-heterogenous climate forcers. To demonstrate the utility of AiBEDO, we use the example of a climate intervention technique called Marine Cloud Brightening, with the ultimate goal of optimizing the spatial pattern of cloud brightening to achieve regional climate targets and prevent known climate tipping points. While we showcase the effectiveness of our approach in the context of climate science, it is generally applicable to other scientific disciplines that are limited by the extensive computational demands of domain simulation models.

We propose an innovative hierarchical imitation learning framework that effectively alleviates the complexity of learning in autonomous driving decision-making problems by decoupling decision-making tasks into sub-problems. Specifically, the decision-making process is divided into two levels of sub-problems: the upper level directs the vehicle's lane selection and qualitative speed management, while the lower level implements precise control of the driving speed and direction. We harness Transformer-based models for solving each sub-problem, enabling overall hierarchical framework to comprehend and navigate diverse and various road conditions, ultimately resulting in improved decision-making. Through an evaluation in several typical driving scenarios within the SMARTS autonomous driving simulation environment, our proposed hierarchical decision-making framework significantly outperforms end-to-end reinforcement learning algorithms and behavior cloning algorithm, achieving an average pass rate of over 90%.

Order dispatching is instrumental to large-scale OFD platforms, such as Meituan, which continuously match food order requests to couriers at a scale of tens of millions each day to satisfy the needs of consumers, couriers, and merchants. However, due to high dynamism and inevitable uncertainties in the real-world environment, it is not an easy task to achieve long-term global objective optimization through continuous isolated optimization decisions at each dispatch moment. Our work proposes the concept of "courier occupancy" (CO) to precisely quantify the impact of order assignment on the courier's delivery efficiency, realizing a decomposition of long-term and macro goals into various dispatch moments and micro decision-making dimensions. Then in the prediction phase, an improved and universally applicable distribution estimation method is designed to quantify CO which is a stochastic variable and contains future information, combining Monte Carlo dropout and knowledge distillation. In the optimization phase, we use CO to model the objective function at each dispatch moment to introduce future information and extend dispatch decisions from merely who to assign the order to both when and who to assign it, significantly enhancing the long-term optimization capability of dispatching decisions and avoiding local greed. We conduct extensive offline simulations based on real dispatching data as well as online AB tests through Meituan's platform.

|[Voucher Abuse Detection with Prompt-based Fine-tuning on Graph Neural Networks](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615505)|Zhihao Wen, Yuan Fang, Yihan Liu, Yang Guo, Shuji Hao|Lazada Inc., Singapore, Singapore; Singapore Management University, Singapore, Singapore|Voucher abuse detection is an important anomaly detection problem in E-commerce. While many GNN-based solutions have emerged, the supervised paradigm depends on a large quantity of labeled data. A popular alternative is to adopt self-supervised pre-training using label-free data, and further fine-tune on a downstream task with limited labels. Nevertheless, the "pre-train, fine-tune" paradigm is often plagued by the objective gap between pre-training and downstream tasks. Hence, we propose VPGNN, a prompt-based fine-tuning framework on GNNs for voucher abuse detection.

However, existing methods for conventional audience expansion fall short due to two significant challenges, the intricate interplay of multiple complex factors in the logistics scenario and the emphasis on long-term logistics service usage instead of one-time promotions. To address the above limitations, we design LOGAE-TKG, a logistics audience expansion method based on a temporal knowledge graph, which consists of three components: (i) a temporal logistics knowledge graph pre-trained model to model the effect of multiple complex factors and build a solid logistics knowledge base for contracting and usage prediction; (ii) an intention learning model with data augmentation-based comparison to capture the contracting intention; (iii) a future pattern discovery model to uncover post-contract patterns. We evaluate and deploy our method on the JingDong e-commerce platform.

|[DeepSTA: A Spatial-Temporal Attention Network for Logistics Delivery Timely Rate Prediction in Anomaly Conditions](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614671)|Jinhui Yi, Huan Yan, Haotian Wang, Jian Yuan, Yong Li|JD Logistics, Beijing, China; Tsinghua University & JD Logistics, Beijing, China; Tsinghua University, Beijing, China|Prediction of couriers' delivery timely rates in advance is essential to the logistics industry, enabling companies to take preemptive measures to ensure the normal operation of delivery services. This becomes even more critical during anomaly conditions like the epidemic outbreak, during which couriers' delivery timely rate will decline markedly and fluctuates significantly. Existing studies pay less attention to the logistics scenario. Moreover, many works focusing on prediction tasks in anomaly scenarios fail to explicitly model abnormal events, e.g., treating external factors equally with other features, resulting in great information loss. Further, since some anomalous events occur infrequently, traditional data-driven methods perform poorly in these scenarios. To deal with them, we propose a deep spatial-temporal attention model, named DeepSTA. To be specific, to avoid information loss, we design an anomaly spatio-temporal learning module that employs a recurrent neural network to model incident information. Additionally, we utilize Node2vec to model correlations between road districts, and adopt graph neural networks and long short-term memory to capture the spatial-temporal dependencies of couriers. To tackle the issue of insufficient training data in abnormal circumstances, we propose an anomaly pattern attention module that adopts a memory network for couriers' anomaly feature patterns storage via attention mechanisms. The experiments on real-world logistics datasets during the COVID-19 outbreak in 2022 show the model outperforms the best baselines by 12.11% in MAE and 13.71% in MSE, demonstrating its superior performance over multiple competitive baselines.|提前预测快递员的送货及时率对物流业至关重要，使公司能够采取先发制人的措施，以确保送货服务的正常运作。在疫情爆发等异常情况下，这种情况变得更加严重，在这种情况下，送货员的及时送货率将显著下降并出现大幅波动。现有的研究对物流情景的关注较少。此外，许多侧重于异常场景中的预测任务的工作未能对异常事件进行明确的建模，例如，将外部因素与其他特征等同对待，造成了巨大的信息损失。此外，由于一些异常事件很少发生，传统的数据驱动方法在这些场景中表现不佳。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一个深度时空注意模型 DeepSTA。具体来说，为了避免信息丢失，我们设计了一个异常时空学习模块，该模块使用一个递归神经网络来模拟事件信息。此外，我们利用 Node2vec 建立道路区域之间的相关性模型，并采用图形神经网络和长期短期记忆来捕捉信使的时空依赖性。针对异常情况下训练数据不足的问题，提出了一种异常模式注意模块，该模块采用记忆网络通过注意机制对信使的异常特征模式进行存储。在2022年2019冠状病毒疾病暴发期间对现实世界物流数据集的实验表明，该模型在 MAE 和 MSE 中的表现优于最佳基线12.11% 和13.71% ，表明其优于多个竞争基线。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=DeepSTA:+A+Spatial-Temporal+Attention+Network+for+Logistics+Delivery+Timely+Rate+Prediction+in+Anomaly+Conditions)|0|
|[Detecting Social Bot on the Fly using Contrastive Learning](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615468)|Ming Zhou, Dan Zhang, Yuandong Wang, YangliAo Geng, Jie Tang|Tsinghua University, Beijing, China|Social bot detection is becoming a task of wide concern in social security. All along, the development of social bot detection technology is hindered by the lack of high-quality annotated data. Besides, the rapid development of AI Generated Content (AIGC) technology is dramatically improving the creative ability of social bots. For example, the recently released ChatGPT [2] can fool the state-of-the-art AI-text-detection method with a probability of 74%, bringing a large challenge to content-based bot detection methods. To address the above drawbacks, we propose a Contrastive Learning-driven Social Bot Detection framework (CBD). The core of CBD is characterized by a two-stage model learning strategy: a contrastive pre-training stage to mine generalization patterns from massive unlabeled social graphs, followed by a semi-supervised fine-tuning stage to model task-specific knowledge latent in social graphs with a few annotations. The above strategy endows our model with promising detection performance under an extreme scarcity of labeled data. In terms of system architecture, we propose a smart feedback mechanism to further improve detection performance. Comprehensive experiments on a real bot detection dataset show that CBD consistently outperforms 10 state-of-the-art baselines by a large margin for few-shot bot detection using very little (5-shot) labeled data. CBD has been deployed online.|社会机器人检测正成为社会保障领域广泛关注的课题。一直以来，由于缺乏高质量的注释数据，阻碍了社交机器人检测技术的发展。此外，人工智能生成内容(AIGC)技术的快速发展也极大地提高了社交机器人的创造能力。例如，最近发布的 ChatGPT [2]可以以74% 的概率欺骗最先进的 AI 文本检测方法，给基于内容的机器人检测方法带来了巨大的挑战。针对上述缺点，我们提出了一个对比学习驱动的社会机器人检测框架(CBD)。CBD 的核心拥有属性是一个两阶段的模型学习策略: 一个对比性的预训练阶段，从大量未标记的社交图中挖掘概括模式，然后是一个半监督的微调阶段，用一些注释来模拟社交图中潜在的特定任务知识。上述策略使我们的模型在标记数据极度稀缺的情况下具有良好的检测性能。在系统结构方面，我们提出了一种智能反馈机制来进一步提高检测性能。在一个真实的机器人检测数据集上的综合实验表明，CBD 在使用非常少(5次)标记数据进行少镜头机器人检测方面始终优于10个最先进的基线。CBD 已经在线部署。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Detecting+Social+Bot+on+the+Fly+using+Contrastive+Learning)|0|

Taiwan has also faced escalating challenges in this regard. To effectively address these issues, the Government of Taiwan has initiated the Smart City program, encompassing various initiatives to enhance urban functionality. One notable solution implemented under this program is the Smart Parking Meter System (SPMS), designed to enhance the overall parking experience. The SPMS incorporates intelligent billing and secure parking data transmission, ensuring a safer and improved parking environment. In this paper, we propose ParkFlow, a comprehensive software-based solution that seamlessly integrates with smart parking hardware, presenting a holistic approach to tackling these challenges. ParkFlow intelligently disperses parking shortages in highly frequented areas and addresses the problem from multiple perspectives, including user, engineering, and government scenarios. By exploring and addressing these scenarios, we aim to provide valuable insights and inspiration to regions worldwide grappling with similar parking-related difficulties. Based on historical data analysis, the implementation of ParkFlow in resolving the parking imbalance problem is anticipated to lead to a significant increase of up to 10% to 20% in available parking hours in popular areas of Tainan, Taiwan.

Despite extensive research on the subject, the absence of a unified framework for NPs leads to varied architectural solutions across diverse studies. This non-consensus poses challenges to reproducing and benchmarking different NPs. Moreover, existing codebases mainly prioritize generative density estimation, yet rarely consider expanding the capability of NPs to self-supervised representation learning, which however has gained growing importance in data mining applications. To this end, we present NP-SSL, a modular and configurable framework with built-in support, requiring minimal effort to 1) implement classical NPs architectures; 2) customize specific components; 3) integrate hybrid training scheme (e.g., contrastive); and 4) extend NPs to act as a self-supervised learning toolkit, producing latent representations of data, and facilitating diverse downstream predictive tasks. To illustrate, we discuss a case study that applies NP-SSL to model time-series data. We interpret that NP-SSL can handle different predictive tasks such as imputation and forecasting, by a simple switch in data samplings, without significant change to the underlying structure. We hope this study can reduce the workload of future research on leveraging NPs to tackle more a broader range of real-world data mining applications.

Various index advisors have been developed in recent years, and comprehensively assessing their performance from multiple aspects is necessary. In this demonstration, we introduce VITA, a user-friendly and informative tool for interactively Visualizing, Testing, and Analyzing index advisors. For a user-given workload, VITA can visualize the main steps of the index selection procedure in ten existing index advisors to facilitate the management of index advisors. Moreover, VITA can assess the index advisor's robustness w.r.t. workload drift by generating testing workloads, i.e., potentially future workloads that may damage the index advisor's performance. Finally, VITA provides a comparative analysis across index advisors on four aspects, including the index advisor's utility (i.e., the ratio of the reduced workload cost), robustness (i.e., the performance under dynamic workload), overhead (i.e., the time to acquire the final configuration), and scalability (i.e., the volume of the enumerated index candidates). Therefore, VITA can thoroughly compare existing index advisors to help users determine the most suitable index advisor that meets their requirements.

However, the application of deep learning to improve badminton athletes' performance faces challenges related to identifying weaknesses, generating winning suggestions, and validating strategy effectiveness. These challenges arise due to the limited availability of realistic environments and agents. This paper aims to address these research gaps and make contributions to the badminton community. To achieve this goal, we propose a closed-loop approach consisting of six key components: Badminton Data Acquisition, Imitating Players' Styles, Simulating Matches, Optimizing Strategies, Training Execution, and Real-World Competitions. Specifically, we developed a novel model called RallyNet, which excels at imitating players' styles, allowing agents to accurately replicate real players' behavior. Secondly, we created a sophisticated badminton simulation environment that incorporates real-world physics, faithfully recreating game situations. Thirdly, we employed reinforcement learning techniques to improve players' strategies, enhancing their chances of winning while preserving their unique playing styles. By comparing strategy differences before and after improvement, we provide winning suggestions to players, which can be validated against diverse opponents within our carefully designed environment. Lastly, through collaborations with badminton venues and players, we apply the generated suggestions to the players' training and competitions, ensuring the effectiveness of our approach. Moreover, we continuously gather data from training and competitions, incorporating it into the closed-loop cycle to refine strategies and suggestions. This research presents an innovative approach for continuously improving players' performance, contributing to the field of AI-driven sports performance enhancement.

Therefore, we require a unified framework that allows for easy execution in diverse settings. While this applies to established clustering methods like k-Means and DBSCAN, deep clustering algorithms lack a standard structure, resulting in significant programming overhead. This complicates empirical evaluations, which are essential in both scientific and practical applications.

The online phase scores the similarity between the transcribed conversation and the topic anchors from the offline phase, followed by time domain analysis to group utterances into segments and tag them with topics. The GPT-Calls scheme offers an accurate and efficient approach to call segmentation and topic extraction, eliminating the need for labeled data. It is a versatile solution applicable to various industry domains. GPT-Calls operates in production under Dynamics 365 Sales Conversation Intelligence, applied to real sales conversations from diverse Dynamics 365 Sales tenants, streamlining call analysis, and saving time and resources while ensuring accuracy and effectiveness.|电话记录在销售、客户服务、医疗保健、执法等方面具有重要价值。然而，分析记录的对话可能是一个耗时的过程，特别是对于复杂的对话。在 Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales 中，一个名为 GPT-Call 的新系统被应用于高效、准确的基于主题的呼叫分类。GPT-通话包括离线和在线两个阶段。在离线阶段，系统利用 GPT 模型生成合成语句，并为预定义的主题提取锚向量。这个阶段在给定的主题列表上执行一次，就可以大大减少计算负担。在线阶段记录转录的会话与离线阶段的主题锚之间的相似性，然后进行时域分析，将话语分成片段，并给它们加上主题标签。GPT-Call 方案提供了一种准确有效的呼叫分割和主题提取方法，从而消除了对标记数据的需求。它是一个适用于各种行业领域的通用解决方案。GPT-Call 在 Dynamics 365 Sales Conversation Intelligence 下运作，应用于来自不同 Dynamics 365销售租户的真实销售对话，简化呼叫分析，节省时间和资源，同时确保准确性和有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Harnessing+GPT+for+Topic-Based+Call+Segmentation+in+Microsoft+Dynamics+365+Sales)|0|
|[Astrolabe: Visual Graph Database Queries with Tabular Output](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615992)|Michael Miller|Northrop Grumman Space Systems, Roy, UT, USA|Graph databases are an established solution for large, highly connected datasets. One challenge associated with deploying graph databases in industrial settings is usability. Typically, developers interact with graph databases through queries in languages such as Cypher or GraphQL. Many end-users, analysts, and administrators are not familiar with these specialized languages. Additionally, these queries return hierarchical data in formats such as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) or XML (Extensible Markup Language). Additional scripts and interfaces are needed to convert hierarchical data into more easily digested tables. To overcome these challenges, each graph database use-case typically involves significant custom software to explore, view, and export data. We introduce Astrolabe, a generalized interface that addresses the challenges of querying graph databases. In Astrolabe, queries are constructed visually, so users do not need to learn new graph query languages. Results are returned as tables, which can be easily digested by end users or down-stream applications. Astrolabe was designed to function with arbitrary graph databases, so schema definition is not required. Astrolabe revolutionizes graph exploration and querying by allowing graph databases to be viewed as tables, without the need for custom software adapters.|图形数据库是大型、高度连接数据集的一种已建立的解决方案。在工业环境中部署图形数据库的一个挑战是可用性。通常，开发人员通过 Cypher 或 GraphQL 等语言中的查询与图形数据库交互。许多最终用户、分析人员和管理员不熟悉这些专用语言。此外，这些查询以 JSON (JSON)或 XML (XML)等格式返回分层数据。需要额外的脚本和接口将分层数据转换为更容易消化的表。为了克服这些挑战，每个图形数据库用例通常需要使用重要的定制软件来探索、查看和导出数据。我们介绍 Astrolabe，它是一个通用的接口，用于解决查询图形数据库的挑战。在 Astrolabe 中，查询是可视化构建的，因此用户不需要学习新的图形查询语言。结果以表的形式返回，终端用户或下游应用程序可以很容易地消化这些结果。星盘被设计用于任意图形数据库，因此不需要模式定义。Astrolabe 通过允许将图形数据库视为表格，而不需要自定义软件适配器，彻底改革了图形探索和查询。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Astrolabe:+Visual+Graph+Database+Queries+with+Tabular+Output)|0|

For example, Amazon business teams need to build multilingual product classifiers that operate accurately in all European languages. It is unacceptable for the accuracy of product classification to meet the target in one language (e.g, English), while falling below the target in other languages (e.g, Portuguese). To fix such issues, we propose Language Aware Active Learning for Multilingual Models (LAMM), an active learning strategy that enables a classifier to learn from a small amount of labeled data in a targeted manner to improve the accuracy of Low-resource languages (LRLs) with limited amounts of data for model training. Our empirical results on two open-source datasets and two proprietary product classification datasets demonstrate that LAMM is able to improve the LRL performance by 4%--11% when compared to strong baselines.|在工业设置中，通常需要达到语言级别的精度目标。例如，亚马逊的业务团队需要构建多语言的产品分类器，这些分类器可以准确地在所有欧洲语言中运行。以一种语言(例如英文)达到目标，而以其他语言(例如葡萄牙文)达不到目标，产品分类的准确性是不可接受的。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了语言感知的多语言模型主动学习(LAMM) ，这是一种主动学习策略，使分类器能够以有针对性的方式从少量的标记数据中学习，以提高低资源语言(LRL)的准确性，用有限的数据进行模型训练。我们对两个开源数据集和两个专有产品分类数据集的实证结果表明，与强基线相比，LAMM 能够提高 LRL 性能4% -11% 。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=LAMM:+Language+Aware+Active+Learning+for+Multilingual+Models)|0|

|[Causality-guided Graph Learning for Session-based Recommendation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614803)|Dianer Yu, Qian Li, Hongzhi Yin, Guandong Xu|Curtin University, Perth, WA, Australia; University of Technology, Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia; University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia|Session-based recommendation systems (SBRs) aim to capture user preferences over time by taking into account the sequential order of interactions within sessions. One promising approach within this domain is session graph-based recommendation, which leverages graph-based models to represent and analyze user sessions. However, current graph-based methods for SBRs mainly rely on attention or pooling mechanisms that are prone to exploiting shortcut paths and thus lead to suboptimal recommendations. To address this issue, we propose Causality-guided Graph Learning for Session-based Recommendation (CGSR) that is capable of blocking shortcut paths on the session graph and exploring robust causal connections capturing users' true preferences. Specifically, by employing back-door adjustment of causality, we can generate a distilled causal session graph capturing causal relations among items. CGSR then performs high-order aggregation on the distilled graph, incorporating information from various edge types, to estimate the session preference of the user. This enables us to provide more accurate recommendations grounded in causality while offering fine-grained interaction explanations by highlighting influential items in the graph. Extensive experiments on three datasets show the superior performance of CGSR compared to state-of-the-art SBRs.|基于会话的推荐系统(SBRs)旨在通过考虑会话内交互的顺序顺序来获取用户的偏好。这个领域中一个很有前途的方法是基于会话图的推荐，它利用基于图的模型来表示和分析用户会话。然而，目前基于图表的 SBR 方法主要依赖于注意力或汇集机制，这些机制易于利用捷径，从而导致次优建议。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了基于因果关系的会话推荐图学习(CGSR) ，它能够阻塞会话图上的快捷路径，并探索捕捉用户真实偏好的健壮的因果关系。具体来说，通过因果关系的后门调整，我们可以生成一个提取的因果会话图，捕捉项目之间的因果关系。然后 CGSR 对提取的图进行高阶聚合，结合来自各种边缘类型的信息，以估计用户的会话偏好。这使我们能够提供更准确的建议，基于因果关系，同时提供细粒度的交互解释，突出显示图中有影响力的项目。在三个数据集上的大量实验表明，CGSR 的性能优于最先进的 SBR。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Causality-guided+Graph+Learning+for+Session-based+Recommendation)|-1|

A SPARQL query consists of basic graph patterns (BGPs), which are matched onto the data graph, and graph pattern operators, which specify how to merge the matched results. Despite the prevalence of graph pattern operators in real-world SPARQL workloads, the optimization of SPARQL queries with graph pattern operators has scarcely been studied. We hence propose gFOV, a full-stack SPARQL query optimizer and plan visualizer targeting both BGPs and graph pattern operators. As its basis, we propose a novel BGP-based evaluation tree (BE-tree) plan representation for SPARQL queries that integrates the physical plan for BGPs, which directly accesses the RDF store, and the logical plan for graph pattern operators, which operates on existent results in memory. On top of it, we devise a full-stack cost-based optimization scheme, combining logical and physical plan optimization, that outperforms the state-of-the-art.

|[Semantic-aware Node Synthesis for Imbalanced Heterogeneous Information Networks](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615055)|Xinyi Gao, Wentao Zhang, Tong Chen, Junliang Yu, Nguyen Quoc Viet Hung, Hongzhi Yin|Peking University, Beijing, China; The University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia; Griffith University, Gold Coast, SEQ, Australia|Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have exhibited exceptional efficacy in modeling the complex heterogeneity in heterogeneous information networks (HINs). The critical advantage of HGNNs is their ability to handle diverse node and edge types in HINs by extracting and utilizing the abundant semantic information for effective representation learning. However, as a widespread phenomenon in many real-world scenarios, the class-imbalance distribution in HINs creates a performance bottleneck for existing HGNNs. Apart from the quantity imbalance of nodes, another more crucial and distinctive challenge in HINs is semantic imbalance. Minority classes in HINs often lack diverse and sufficient neighbor nodes, resulting in biased and incomplete semantic information. This semantic imbalance further compounds the difficulty of accurately classifying minority nodes, leading to the performance degradation of HGNNs. To tackle the imbalance of minority classes and supplement their inadequate semantics, we present the first method for the semantic imbalance problem in imbalanced HINs named Semantic-aware Node Synthesis (SNS). By assessing the influence on minority classes, SNS adaptively selects the heterogeneous neighbor nodes and augments the network with synthetic nodes while preserving the minority semantics. In addition, we introduce two regularization approaches for HGNNs that constrain the representation of synthetic nodes from both semantic and class perspectives to effectively suppress the potential noises from synthetic nodes, facilitating more expressive embeddings for classification. The comprehensive experimental study demonstrates that SNS consistently outperforms existing methods by a large margin in different benchmark datasets.|异构图神经网络(HGNNs)在异构信息网络(HINs)的复杂异构性建模中表现出了非凡的功效。HGNN 的关键优势在于它们能够通过提取和利用丰富的语义信息来处理 HINs 中不同的节点和边缘类型，从而有效地进行表示学习。然而，作为现实世界中普遍存在的一种现象，HIN 中的类不平衡分布为现有的 HGNN 造成了性能瓶颈。除了节点的数量不平衡外，HIN 中另一个更为关键和独特的挑战是语义不平衡。HIN 中的少数族群往往缺乏多样性和足够的邻居节点，导致偏倚和不完全的语义信息。这种语义不平衡进一步加大了对少数节点进行准确分类的难度，导致 HGNN 的性能下降。为了解决不平衡 HIN 中少数类的语义不平衡问题，并补充其不足的语义，我们提出了第一种解决不平衡 HIN 中语义不平衡问题的方法——语义感知节点合成(SNS)。通过评估对少数族群的影响，SNS 自适应地选择异构邻居节点，在保留少数族群语义的前提下使用合成节点对网络进行扩展。此外，我们还介绍了两种 HGNN 的正则化方法，它们从语义和类的角度约束合成节点的表示，以有效地抑制合成节点的潜在噪声，促进更具表达性的分类嵌入。综合实验研究表明，在不同的基准数据集中，SNS 的性能一直大大优于现有的方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Semantic-aware+Node+Synthesis+for+Imbalanced+Heterogeneous+Information+Networks)|-1|
|[Unsupervised Aspect Term Extraction by Integrating Sentence-level Curriculum Learning with Token-level Self-paced Learning](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615103)|Jihong Ouyang, Zhiyao Yang, Chang Xuan, Bing Wang, Yiyuan Wang, Ximing Li|Northeast Normal University, Changchun, China; Jilin University, Changchun, China|Aspect Term Extraction (ATE), a key sub-task of aspect-based sentiment analysis, aims to extract aspect terms from review sentences on which users express opinions. Existing studies mainly treat ATE as a sequence labeling problem, and the aspect terms of training data are annotated at the token level, such as "BIO'' tagging. However, such fine-grained annotations are often too costly to collect in many real applications, giving rise to the urgent demand for the challenging Unsupervised ATE (UATE). This paper suggests a novel UATE method by integrating sentence-level curriculum learning with token-level self-paced learning, namely UATE-SCTS. We design a set of hand-crafted rules to generate pseudo-labels but with noise. To combat this issue, our key idea is to train the ATE model from easier samples to harder samples to achieve a more robust model with more precise predictions at the early training epochs. This enables better refining of the noisy pseudo-labels. At the sentence level, we propose a frequency-induced pseudo-label cardinality to measure the learning difficulty of the review sentence and train the model in a curriculum-learning manner. At the token level, we formulate a self-paced learning objective that can adaptively select easier samples for training. We compare UATE-SCTS with baseline methods on benchmark collections of reviews from different domains. Empirical results demonstrate that UATE-SCTS can outperform existing UATE baselines.|体词提取(ATE)是基于体词的情感分析的一个关键子任务，旨在从用户表达意见的复习句中提取体词。现有的研究主要将 ATE 作为一个序列标注问题来处理，训练数据的方面术语在标记层次上进行标注，如“ BIO”标注。然而，这样的细粒度注释往往是太昂贵的收集在许多实际应用中，引起了对具有挑战性的无监督 ATE (UATE)的迫切需求。本文提出了一种将句子层次课程学习与表征层次自主学习相结合的 UATE 方法，即 UATE-SCS。我们设计了一组手工制作的规则来生成伪标签，但是带有噪音。为了解决这个问题，我们的关键思想是训练 ATE 模型从更容易的样本到更难的样本，以实现一个更稳健的模型与更精确的预测在早期训练阶段。这样可以更好地精炼嘈杂的伪标签。在句子层面，我们提出了一个频率诱导的伪标记基数来度量复习句的学习难度，并以课程学习的方式训练该模型。在表征层面，我们制定了一个自定步调的学习目标，可以自适应地选择更容易的样本进行训练。我们比较了 UATE-SCT 和基准方法对不同领域的评论的基准收集。实证结果表明，UATE-SCS 的性能优于现有的 UATE 基线。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Unsupervised+Aspect+Term+Extraction+by+Integrating+Sentence-level+Curriculum+Learning+with+Token-level+Self-paced+Learning)|-1|

When facing with a new task, existing lifelong learning approaches need first gather sufficient training data to identify task relationships before knowledge transfer can succeed. However, annotating large number of training data persistently for every coming task is time-consuming, which can be prohibitive for real-world lifelong regression problems. To reduce this burden, we propose to incorporate weak regression into lifelong learning so as to enhance training data and improve predictive performance. Specifically, the weak prediction is first produced by single-task predictor, which is encoded as feature vectors that contain essential prior output information. This weak regression is further linked with task model via coupled dictionary learning. The integration of weak regression and task model can facilitate both cross-task and inter-task knowledge transfer, thus improving the overall performance. More critically, the weak regression can backup the task model especially when there is insufficient training data to construct an accurate model. Three real-world datasets are used to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Results show that our method outperforms existing lifelong models and single-task models even if training data is minimal.|作为一种新兴的学习范式，终身学习试图在以前积累的知识的基础上，在长时间尺度上解决多个连续的任务。当面对一项新任务时，现有的终身学习方法需要首先收集足够的训练数据，以确定任务关系，然后才能成功地进行知识转移。然而，为每个即将到来的任务持久地注释大量的训练数据是非常耗时的，这对于现实世界中的终身回归问题来说是非常困难的。为了减轻这种负担，我们建议在终身学习中加入弱回归，以增强训练数据，提高预测性能。具体来说，弱预测首先由单任务预测器产生，该预测器被编码为包含必要先验输出信息的特征向量。这种弱回归通过耦合词典学习进一步与任务模型联系起来。弱回归与任务模型的结合可以促进跨任务和跨任务的知识转移，从而提高整体绩效。更关键的是，弱回归可以备份任务模型，特别是当没有足够的训练数据来建立一个准确的模型。利用三个实际数据集对该方法的有效性进行了评估。结果表明，即使训练数据最少，该方法仍优于现有的终身模型和单任务模型。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Weak+Regression+Enhanced+Lifelong+Learning+for+Improved+Performance+and+Reduced+Training+Data)|-1|

The core of graph neural networks is the message passing mechanism that aims to generate the embeddings of nodes by aggregating the neighboring node information. However, recent work suggests that GNNs also suffer the trustworthiness issues. Our empirical study shows that the calibration error of the in-distribution (ID) nodes would be exacerbated if a graph is mixed with out-of-distribution (OOD) nodes, and we assume that the noisy information from OOD nodes is the root for the worsened calibration error. Both previous study and our empirical study suggest that adjusting the weights of edges could be a promising way to reduce the adverse impact from the OOD nodes. However, how to precisely select the desired edges and modify the corresponding weights is not trivial, since the distribution of OOD nodes is unknown to us. To tackle this problem, we propose a Graph Edge Re-weighting via Deep Q-learning (GERDQ) framework to calibrate the graph neural networks. Our framework aims to explore the potential influence of the change of the edge weights on target ID nodes by sampling and traversing the edges in the graph, and we formulate this process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Many existing GNNs could be seamlessly incorporated into our framework. Experimental results show that when wrapped with our method, the existing GNN models can yield lower calibration error under OOD nodes as well as comparable accuracy compared to the original ones and other strong baselines.

MoCLIM independently extracts the informative features from distinct omics modalities.

Due to their shared nature and widespread usage, e-scooters usually have a short lifespan (e.g., two to five months[2]), which makes it important to predict the remaining lifespan accurately, ensuring timely replacements. While several studies have focused on the lifespan prediction of various systems, such as batteries and bridges, they present a two-fold drawback. Firstly, they require significant manual labor or additional sensor resources to ascertain the explicit status of the object, rendering them cost-ineffective. Secondly, these studies assume that future usage is similar as the historical usage. To solve these limitations, we aim at accurately predicting the remaining lifespan of e-scooters without extra cost, and its essence is to accurately represent its current status and anticipate its future usage. However, it is challenging because: i) lack of explicit rules for the e-scooters' status representation; and ii) e-scooters' future usage may significantly differ from their historical usage. In this paper, we design a framework called RLIFE, whose key insight is modeling user behaviors from trip transactions is of great importance in predicting the Remaining LIFespan of shared E-scooters. Specifically, we introduce an unsupervised contrastive learning component to learn the e-scooters' status representation over time considering degradation, where user preferences are served as a status reflector; We further design an LSTM-based recursive component to dynamically predict uncertain future usage, upon which we fuse the current status and predicted usage of the e-scooter for its remaining lifespan prediction.

|[A Deep Conditional Generative Approach for Constrained Community Detection](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615145)|Chaobo He, Junwei Cheng, Quanlong Guan, Xiang Fei, Hanchao Li, Yong Tang|School of Computer Science, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, China; School of Computer Science, South China Normal University, Pazhou Lab, Guangzhou, China; Department of Computing, Coventry University, Coventry, United Kingdom; Institute for Digital Technologies, Loughborough University, Leicester, United Kingdom; College of Information Science and Technology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China|Constrained community detection is one of the popular topics in graph data mining, and it aims to improve the performance by exploiting prior pairwise constraints, such as must-link and cannot-link constraints. However, most of existing methods for constrained community detection are shallow approaches, and are also not robust to handle constraints information with noises. In view of this, we propose a deep conditional generative approach CGMVGAE. It firstly treats pairwise constraints as the priors with different degrees of certainty, and then integrates them into the conditional Gaussian mixture model. By further combing variational graph auto-encoders and the Wasserstein regularization, CGMVGAE can learn the latent node representations preserving community structures in a deep generative manner. Experimental results show that CGMVGAE outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, and is also more robust.|约束社区检测是图形数据挖掘中的热点问题之一，其目的是利用先验的成对约束，如必须链接约束和不能链接约束，提高社区检测的性能。然而，现有的约束群体检测方法大多是浅层检测方法，对于带有噪声的约束信息也不具有鲁棒性。鉴于此，我们提出了一种深度条件生成方法 CGMVGAE。它首先将成对约束作为不同确定度的先验条件，然后将其集成到条件高斯混合模型中。通过进一步结合变分图自动编码器和 Wasserstein 正则化，CGMVGAE 能够以深层生成的方式学习保持群体结构的潜在节点表示。实验结果表明，CGMVGAE 算法的性能优于目前最先进的算法，并且具有更强的鲁棒性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=A+Deep+Conditional+Generative+Approach+for+Constrained+Community+Detection)|-1|
|[Pseudo Triplet Networks for Classification Tasks with Cross-Source Feature Incompleteness](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3615154)|Cayon Liow, ChengTe Li, ChunPai Yang, ShouDe Lin|National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan Roc; National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan Roc|Cross-source feature incompleteness -- a scenario where certain features are only available in one data source but missing in another -- is a common and significant challenge in machine learning. It typically arises in situations where the training data and testing data are collected from different sources with distinct feature sets. Addressing this challenge has the potential to greatly improve the utility of valuable datasets that might otherwise be considered incomplete and enhance model performance. This paper introduces the novel Pseudo Triplet Network (PTN) to address cross-source feature incompleteness. PTN fuses two Siamese network architectures -- Triplet Networks and Pseudo Networks. By segregating data into instance, positive, and negative subsets, PTN facilitates effectively contrastive learning through a hybrid loss function design. The model was rigorously evaluated on six benchmark datasets from the UCI Repository, in comparison with five other methods for managing missing data, under a range of feature overlap and missing data scenarios. The PTN consistently exhibited superior performance, displaying resilience in high missing ratio situations and maintaining robust stability across various data scenarios.|跨源特性不完整性——某些特性只在一个数据源中可用，而在另一个数据源中缺失——是机器学习中常见的重大挑战。它通常出现在训练数据和测试数据是从具有不同特征集的不同来源收集的情况下。应对这一挑战有可能大大提高可能被认为不完整的宝贵数据集的效用，并提高模型性能。针对跨源特征不完全性问题，提出了一种新的伪三重网(PTN)算法。PTN 融合了两种连体网络结构——三联网络和伪网络。PTN 通过将数据分为实例子集、正子集和负子集，通过混合损失函数设计有效地促进了对比学习。在一系列特征重叠和缺失数据情景下，对 UCI 知识库的六个基准数据集进行了严格的评估，并与其他五种管理缺失数据的方法进行了比较。PTN 始终表现出优越的性能，在高缺失率情况下显示出弹性，并在各种数据场景中保持稳健的稳定性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Pseudo+Triplet+Networks+for+Classification+Tasks+with+Cross-Source+Feature+Incompleteness)|-1|
|[Towards Understanding of Deepfake Videos in the Wild](https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614729)|Beomsang Cho, Binh M. Le, Jiwon Kim, Simon S. Woo, Shahroz Tariq, Alsharif Abuadbba, Kristen Moore|CSIRO's Data61, Sydney, Australia; Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Republic of Korea; CSIRO's Data61, Melbourne, Australia|Deepfakes have become a growing concern in recent years, prompting researchers to develop benchmark datasets and detection algorithms to tackle the issue. However, existing datasets suffer from significant drawbacks that hamper their effectiveness. Notably, these datasets fail to encompass the latest deepfake videos produced by state-of-the-art methods that are being shared across various platforms. This limitation impedes the ability to keep pace with the rapid evolution of generative AI techniques employed in real-world deepfake production. Our contributions in this IRB-approved study are to bridge this knowledge gap from current real-world deepfakes by providing in-depth analysis. We first present the largest and most diverse and recent deepfake dataset (RWDF-23) collected from the wild to date, consisting of 2,000 deepfake videos collected from 4 platforms targeting 4 different languages span created from 21 countries: Reddit, YouTube, TikTok, and Bilibili. By expanding the dataset's scope beyond the previous research, we capture a broader range of real-world deepfake content, reflecting the ever-evolving landscape of online platforms. Also, we conduct a comprehensive analysis encompassing various aspects of deepfakes, including creators, manipulation strategies, purposes, and real-world content production methods. This allows us to gain valuable insights into the nuances and characteristics of deepfakes in different contexts. Lastly, in addition to the video content, we also collect viewer comments and interactions, enabling us to explore the engagements of internet users with deepfake content. By considering this rich contextual information, we aim to provide a holistic understanding of the {evolving} deepfake phenomenon and its impact on online platforms.|近年来，Deepfakes 已经成为一个日益令人担忧的问题，促使研究人员开发基准数据集和检测算法来解决这个问题。但是，现有的数据集存在严重的缺陷，妨碍了它们的有效性。值得注意的是，这些数据集未能涵盖最新的深度伪造视频产生的最先进的方法，正在分享各种平台。这种局限性阻碍了生成性人工智能技术在现实世界深度伪造生产中的快速发展。我们在这个 IRB 批准的研究中的贡献是通过提供深入的分析来弥补与现实世界中的深度造假者之间的知识差距。我们首先展示迄今为止从野外收集的最大、最多样化和最新的深度伪造数据集(rWDF-23) ，包括从4个平台收集的2000个深度伪造视频，这些平台针对来自21个国家的4种不同语言: Reddit、 YouTube、 tikTok 和 Bilibili。通过扩大数据集的范围超越以前的研究，我们捕获了更广泛的现实世界深度假内容，反映了不断发展的在线平台景观。此外，我们进行了全面的分析，包括各个方面的深假，包括创作者，操作策略，目的，和现实世界的内容生产方法。这使我们能够获得有价值的洞察深度假的细微差别和特点在不同的背景下。最后，除了视频内容，我们还收集观众的评论和互动，使我们能够探索互联网用户与深度假内容的参与。通过考虑这丰富的上下文信息，我们旨在提供一个整体的理解{演变}深度假现象及其对在线平台的影响。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Towards+Understanding+of+Deepfake+Videos+in+the+Wild)|-1|
