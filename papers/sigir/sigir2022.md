|[Hypergraph Contrastive Collaborative Filtering](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3532058)|Lianghao Xia, Chao Huang, Yong Xu, Jiashu Zhao, Dawei Yin, Jimmy X. Huang|University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong; South China University Of Technology, Guangzhou, China; Wilfrid Laurier University, Waterloo, Canada; Baidu, Beijing, China; York University, Toronto, Canada|Collaborative Filtering (CF) has emerged as fundamental paradigms for parameterizing users and items into latent representation space, with their correlative patterns from interaction data. Among various CF techniques, the development of GNN-based recommender systems, e.g., PinSage and LightGCN, has offered the state-of-the-art performance. However, two key challenges have not been well explored in existing solutions: i) The over-smoothing effect with deeper graph-based CF architecture, may cause the indistinguishable user representations and degradation of recommendation results. ii) The supervision signals (i.e., user-item interactions) are usually scarce and skewed distributed in reality, which limits the representation power of CF paradigms. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new self-supervised recommendation framework Hypergraph Contrastive Collaborative Filtering (HCCF) to jointly capture local and global collaborative relations with a hypergraph-enhanced cross-view contrastive learning architecture. In particular, the designed hypergraph structure learning enhances the discrimination ability of GNN-based CF paradigm, in comprehensively capturing the complex high-order dependencies among users. Additionally, our HCCF model effectively integrates the hypergraph structure encoding with self-supervised learning to reinforce the representation quality of recommender systems, based on the hypergraph self-discrimination. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over various state-of-the-art recommendation methods, and the robustness against sparse user interaction data. The implementation codes are available at https://github.com/akaxlh/HCCF.|协同过滤(CF)已经成为将用户和项目参数化为潜在表征空间的基本范例，其相关模式来自交互数据。在各种 CF 技术中，基于 GNN 的推荐系统(如 PinSage 和 LightGCN)的开发提供了最先进的性能。然而，在现有的解决方案中，有两个关键的挑战还没有得到很好的探索: i)基于更深层次的基于图的 CF 架构的过度平滑效应，可能导致难以区分的用户表示和推荐结果的退化。监督信号(即用户-项目交互)在现实生活中往往是稀缺的、偏态分布的，这限制了 CF 范式的表示能力。为了应对这些挑战，我们提出了一个新的自我监督推荐框架 Hypergraph 对比度协同过滤(hCCF) ，通过一个超图增强的跨视图对比度学习架构，联合捕捉本地和全球的协作关系。特别是，所设计的超图结构学习提高了基于 GNN 的 CF 范式的识别能力，能够全面捕获用户之间复杂的高阶依赖关系。此外，我们的 HCCF 模型有效地将超图结构编码与自监督学习相结合，以增强基于超图自辨识的推荐系统的表示质量。在三个基准数据集上的大量实验表明，该模型优于各种最新的推荐方法，并且对稀疏用户交互数据具有鲁棒性。实施守则可于 https://github.com/akaxlh/hccf 索取。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Hypergraph+Contrastive+Collaborative+Filtering)|22|
|[Are Graph Augmentations Necessary?: Simple Graph Contrastive Learning for Recommendation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531937)|Junliang Yu, Hongzhi Yin, Xin Xia, Tong Chen, Lizhen Cui, Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen|The University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia; Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia; Shandong University, Jinan, China|Contrastive learning (CL) recently has spurred a fruitful line of research in the field of recommendation, since its ability to extract self-supervised signals from the raw data is well-aligned with recommender systems' needs for tackling the data sparsity issue. A typical pipeline of CL-based recommendation models is first augmenting the user-item bipartite graph with structure perturbations, and then maximizing the node representation consistency between different graph augmentations. Although this paradigm turns out to be effective, what underlies the performance gains is still a mystery. In this paper, we first experimentally disclose that, in CL-based recommendation models, CL operates by learning more uniform user/item representations that can implicitly mitigate the popularity bias. Meanwhile, we reveal that the graph augmentations, which used to be considered necessary, just play a trivial role. Based on this finding, we propose a simple CL method which discards the graph augmentations and instead adds uniform noises to the embedding space for creating contrastive views. A comprehensive experimental study on three benchmark datasets demonstrates that, though it appears strikingly simple, the proposed method can smoothly adjust the uniformity of learned representations and has distinct advantages over its graph augmentation-based counterparts in terms of recommendation accuracy and training efficiency. The code is released at https://github.com/Coder-Yu/QRec.|对比学习(CL)最近在推荐领域激发了一系列富有成效的研究，因为它从原始数据中提取自我监督信号的能力与推荐系统解决数据稀疏问题的需求非常一致。基于 CL 的推荐模型的一个典型流水线是首先用结构扰动对用户项二分图进行扩展，然后使不同图扩展之间的节点表示一致性最大化。尽管这个范例被证明是有效的，但是性能提升的基础是什么仍然是一个谜。在本文中，我们首先通过实验揭示了在基于 CL 的推荐模型中，CL 是通过学习更加统一的用户/项目表示来实现的，这种表示可以隐含地减少流行偏差。同时，我们发现，图的增广，过去被认为是必要的，只是起到一个微不足道的作用。基于这一发现，我们提出了一种简单的 CL 方法，该方法抛弃了图的增广，而是在嵌入空间中加入均匀的噪声来创建对比视图。通过对三个基准数据集的全面实验研究表明，该方法虽然看似简单，但能够平滑地调整学习表示的一致性，在推荐精度和训练效率方面明显优于基于图增强的推荐方法。密码在 https://github.com/coder-yu/qrec 发布。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Are+Graph+Augmentations+Necessary?:+Simple+Graph+Contrastive+Learning+for+Recommendation)|20|
|[From Distillation to Hard Negative Sampling: Making Sparse Neural IR Models More Effective](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531857)|Thibault Formal, Carlos Lassance, Benjamin Piwowarski, Stéphane Clinchant|Sorbonne Université, ISIR / CNRS, Paris, France; Naver Labs Europe, Meylan, France; Naver Labs Europe / Sorbonne Université, ISIR, Meylan, France|Neural retrievers based on dense representations combined with Approximate Nearest Neighbors search have recently received a lot of attention, owing their success to distillation and/or better sampling of examples for training -- while still relying on the same backbone architecture. In the meantime, sparse representation learning fueled by traditional inverted indexing techniques has seen a growing interest, inheriting from desirable IR priors such as explicit lexical matching. While some architectural variants have been proposed, a lesser effort has been put in the training of such models. In this work, we build on SPLADE -- a sparse expansion-based retriever -- and show to which extent it is able to benefit from the same training improvements as dense models, by studying the effect of distillation, hard-negative mining as well as the Pre-trained Language Model initialization. We furthermore study the link between effectiveness and efficiency, on in-domain and zero-shot settings, leading to state-of-the-art results in both scenarios for sufficiently expressive models.|基于密集表示结合近似最近邻搜索的神经检索器最近受到了很多关注，因为它们的成功归功于提取和/或更好的训练样本采样——同时仍然依赖于相同的骨干架构。与此同时，传统的反向索引技术所激发的稀疏表示学习受到了越来越多的关注，它继承了外显词汇匹配等可取的信息检索先验。虽然已经提出了一些体系结构变体，但在这类模型的培训方面投入的努力较少。在这项工作中，我们建立在 SPLADE ——一个基于稀疏扩展的检索器——的基础上，通过研究蒸馏、硬负面挖掘以及预训练语言模型初始化的效果，展示了它在多大程度上能够从与密集模型相同的训练改进中受益。我们进一步研究了效率和效果之间的联系，在领域内和零射击设置，导致国家的最先进的结果，在两种情况下充分表达模型。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=From+Distillation+to+Hard+Negative+Sampling:+Making+Sparse+Neural+IR+Models+More+Effective)|10|
|[Multi-level Cross-view Contrastive Learning for Knowledge-aware Recommender System](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3532025)|Ding Zou, Wei Wei, XianLing Mao, Ziyang Wang, Minghui Qiu, Feida Zhu, Xin Cao|The University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia; Alibaba Group, Hangzhou, China; Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China; Singapore Management University, Singapore, Singapore|Knowledge graph (KG) plays an increasingly important role in recommender systems. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) based model has gradually become the theme of knowledge-aware recommendation (KGR). However, there is a natural deficiency for GNN-based KGR models, that is, the sparse supervised signal problem, which may make their actual performance drop to some extent. Inspired by the recent success of contrastive learning in mining supervised signals from data itself, in this paper, we focus on exploring the contrastive learning in KG-aware recommendation and propose a novel multi-level cross-view contrastive learning mechanism, named MCCLK. Different from traditional contrastive learning methods which generate two graph views by uniform data augmentation schemes such as corruption or dropping, we comprehensively consider three different graph views for KG-aware recommendation, including global-level structural view, local-level collaborative and semantic views. Specifically, we consider the user-item graph as a collaborative view, the item-entity graph as a semantic view, and the user-item-entity graph as a structural view. MCCLK hence performs contrastive learning across three views on both local and global levels, mining comprehensive graph feature and structure information in a self-supervised manner. Besides, in semantic view, a k-Nearest-Neighbor (k NN) item-item semantic graph construction module is proposed, to capture the important item-item semantic relation which is usually ignored by previous work. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets show the superior performance of our proposed method over the state-of-the-arts. The implementations are available at: https://github.com/CCIIPLab/MCCLK.|知识图在推荐系统中起着越来越重要的作用。近年来，基于图神经网络(GNN)的知识推荐模型逐渐成为知识感知推荐(KGR)的主题。然而，基于 GNN 的 KGR 模型存在一个自然的缺陷，即稀疏监督信号问题，这可能使其实际性能有所下降。受近年来对比学习在数据挖掘中的成功启发，本文重点研究了 KG 推荐中的对比学习，并提出了一种新的多层次跨视图对比学习机制 MCCLK。与传统的对比学习方法不同，传统的对比学习方法通过统一的数据增强方案(如腐败或丢弃)生成两个图形视图，我们综合考虑了三种不同的 KG 感知推荐图形视图，包括全局层面的结构视图、局部层面的协作视图和语义视图。具体来说，我们将用户项目图视为协作视图，将项目实体图视为语义视图，将用户项目实体图视为结构视图。因此，MCCLK 在局部和全局层面上对三种视图进行对比学习，以自监督的方式挖掘综合图形特征和结构信息。此外，在语义视图中，提出了一个 k 近邻(k NN)项目-项目语义图的构造模块，以捕获以往工作中经常被忽略的重要项目-项目语义关系。在三个基准数据集上进行的大量实验表明，我们提出的方法的性能优于目前的技术水平。有关实施方案可参阅以下 https://github.com/cciiplab/mcclk  :。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Multi-level+Cross-view+Contrastive+Learning+for+Knowledge-aware+Recommender+System)|10|
|[Knowledge Graph Contrastive Learning for Recommendation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3532009)|Yuhao Yang, Chao Huang, Lianghao Xia, Chenliang Li|University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China; University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong; Wuhan University, Wuhan, China|Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have been utilized as useful side information to improve recommendation quality. In those recommender systems, knowledge graph information often contains fruitful facts and inherent semantic relatedness among items. However, the success of such methods relies on the high quality knowledge graphs, and may not learn quality representations with two challenges: i) The long-tail distribution of entities results in sparse supervision signals for KG-enhanced item representation; ii) Real-world knowledge graphs are often noisy and contain topic-irrelevant connections between items and entities. Such KG sparsity and noise make the item-entity dependent relations deviate from reflecting their true characteristics, which significantly amplifies the noise effect and hinders the accurate representation of user's preference. To fill this research gap, we design a general Knowledge Graph Contrastive Learning framework (KGCL) that alleviates the information noise for knowledge graph-enhanced recommender systems. Specifically, we propose a knowledge graph augmentation schema to suppress KG noise in information aggregation, and derive more robust knowledge-aware representations for items. In addition, we exploit additional supervision signals from the KG augmentation process to guide a cross-view contrastive learning paradigm, giving a greater role to unbiased user-item interactions in gradient descent and further suppressing the noise. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the consistent superiority of our KGCL over state-of-the-art techniques. KGCL also achieves strong performance in recommendation scenarios with sparse user-item interactions, long-tail and noisy KG entities. Our implementation codes are available at https://github.com/yuh-yang/KGCL-SIGIR22.|知识图(KG)已经被用作提高推荐质量的有用的辅助信息。在这些推荐系统中，知识图信息往往包含丰富的事实和项目之间固有的语义关系。然而，这种方法的成功依赖于高质量的知识图，并且可能不会学习质量表示法，这有两个挑战: i)实体的长尾分布导致 KG 增强的项目表示的稀疏监督信号; ii)真实世界的知识图通常是噪音的，并且包含项目和实体之间的主题不相关的连接。这种 KG 稀疏性和噪声使得项目-实体依赖关系偏离了真实特征，显著放大了噪声效应，阻碍了用户偏好的准确表达。为了填补这一研究空白，我们设计了一个通用的知识图对比学习框架(KGCL) ，以减轻知识图增强的推荐系统的信息噪声。具体地说，我们提出了一个知识图增强模式来抑制信息聚合中的 KG 噪声，并且得到了更加健壮的知识感知项表示。此外，我们利用来自 KG 增强过程的额外监督信号来指导横向对比学习范式，让无偏见的用户项目交互在梯度下降法中发挥更大的作用，并进一步抑制噪音。在三个公共数据集上的大量实验表明，我们的 KGCL 相对于最先进的技术具有一致的优越性。KGCL 还可以在用户-项目交互稀疏、 KG 实体长尾和噪声较大的推荐场景中获得强大的性能。我们的执行守则可在 https://github.com/yuh-yang/kgcl-sigir22索取。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Knowledge+Graph+Contrastive+Learning+for+Recommendation)|10|
|[Meta-Knowledge Transfer for Inductive Knowledge Graph Embedding](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531757)|Mingyang Chen, Wen Zhang, Yushan Zhu, Hongting Zhou, Zonggang Yuan, Changliang Xu, Huajun Chen|Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Zhejiang University & Alibaba-Zhejiang University Joint Institute of Frontier Technologies, Hangzhou, China; State Key Laboratory of Media Convergence Production Technology and Systems, Beijing, China; Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China|Knowledge graphs (KGs) consisting of a large number of triples have become widespread recently, and many knowledge graph embedding (KGE) methods are proposed to embed entities and relations of a KG into continuous vector spaces. Such embedding methods simplify the operations of conducting various in-KG tasks (e.g., link prediction) and out-of-KG tasks (e.g., question answering). They can be viewed as general solutions for representing KGs. However, existing KGE methods are not applicable to inductive settings, where a model trained on source KGs will be tested on target KGs with entities unseen during model training. Existing works focusing on KGs in inductive settings can only solve the inductive relation prediction task. They can not handle other out-of-KG tasks as general as KGE methods since they don't produce embeddings for entities. In this paper, to achieve inductive knowledge graph embedding, we propose a model MorsE, which does not learn embeddings for entities but learns transferable meta-knowledge that can be used to produce entity embeddings. Such meta-knowledge is modeled by entity-independent modules and learned by meta-learning. Experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms corresponding baselines for in-KG and out-of-KG tasks in inductive settings.|由大量三元组构成的知识图(KG)近年来得到了广泛的应用，为了将 KG 的实体和关系嵌入到连续向量空间中，提出了许多知识图嵌入(KGE)方法。这种嵌入方法简化了进行各种内 KG 任务(例如，链接预测)和外 KG 任务(例如，问题回答)的操作。他们可以被视为代表幼稚园的一般解决方案。然而，现有的 KGE 方法不适用于归纳环境，在这种情况下，以源幼儿园为培训对象的模型将在模型培训过程中看不到实体的目标幼儿园中进行测试。现有的针对归纳环境下幼儿园的工作只能解决归纳关系预测任务。它们不能像 KGE 方法那样处理其他超出 KG 的任务，因为它们不为实体生成嵌入。为了实现归纳知识图的嵌入，本文提出了一种 MorsE 模型，该模型不学习实体的嵌入，而是学习可转移的元知识，从而生成实体的嵌入。这种元知识由独立于实体的模块建模，并通过元学习来学习。实验结果表明，在感应环境下，我们的模型对于在 KG 内和在 KG 外的任务的性能明显优于相应的基线。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Meta-Knowledge+Transfer+for+Inductive+Knowledge+Graph+Embedding)|8|
|[CPFair: Personalized Consumer and Producer Fairness Re-ranking for Recommender Systems](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531959)|Mohammadmehdi Naghiaei, Hossein A. Rahmani, Yashar Deldjoo|University College London, London, United Kingdom; Polytechnic University of Bari, Bari, Italy; University of Southern California, California, CA, USA|Recently, there has been a rising awareness that when machine learning (ML) algorithms are used to automate choices, they may treat/affect individuals unfairly, with legal, ethical, or economic consequences. Recommender systems are prominent examples of such ML systems that assist users in making high-stakes judgments. A common trend in the previous literature research on fairness in recommender systems is that the majority of works treat user and item fairness concerns separately, ignoring the fact that recommender systems operate in a two-sided marketplace. In this work, we present an optimization-based re-ranking approach that seamlessly integrates fairness constraints from both the consumer and producer-side in a joint objective framework. We demonstrate through large-scale experiments on 8 datasets that our proposed method is capable of improving both consumer and producer fairness without reducing overall recommendation quality, demonstrating the role algorithms may play in minimizing data biases.|最近，人们越来越意识到，当机器学习(ML)算法被用于自动选择时，它们可能会不公平地对待/影响个人，产生法律、道德或经济后果。推荐系统是这种机器学习系统的突出例子，它可以帮助用户做出高风险的判断。在以往关于推荐系统公平性的文献研究中，一个普遍的趋势是，大多数研究将用户和项目的公平性问题分开处理，忽略了推荐系统在双边市场中运行的事实。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个基于优化的重新排序方法，在一个联合目标框架中无缝地整合来自消费者和生产者方面的公平约束。我们通过在8个数据集上的大规模实验证明了我们提出的方法能够在不降低整体推荐质量的情况下提高消费者和生产者的公平性，并且证明了算法在最小化数据偏差方面可能发挥的作用。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=CPFair:+Personalized+Consumer+and+Producer+Fairness+Re-ranking+for+Recommender+Systems)|7|
|[Curriculum Learning for Dense Retrieval Distillation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531791)|Hansi Zeng, Hamed Zamani, Vishwa Vinay|University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, MA, USA; Adobe Research, Bangalore, AA, India|Recent work has shown that more effective dense retrieval models can be obtained by distilling ranking knowledge from an existing base re-ranking model. In this paper, we propose a generic curriculum learning based optimization framework called CL-DRD that controls the difficulty level of training data produced by the re-ranking (teacher) model. CL-DRD iteratively optimizes the dense retrieval (student) model by increasing the difficulty of the knowledge distillation data made available to it. In more detail, we initially provide the student model coarse-grained preference pairs between documents in the teacher's ranking, and progressively move towards finer-grained pairwise document ordering requirements. In our experiments, we apply a simple implementation of the CL-DRD framework to enhance two state-of-the-art dense retrieval models. Experiments on three public passage retrieval datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.|最近的研究表明，从现有的基础重排序模型中提取排序知识可以获得更有效的稠密检索模型。本文提出了一个基于课程学习的通用优化框架 CL-DRD，该框架控制重新排序(教师)模型产生的训练数据的难易程度。CL-DRD 通过增加提供给它的知识提取数据的难度，迭代优化了密集检索(学生)模型。更详细地说，我们首先在教师排名中提供文档之间的学生模型粗粒度偏好对，然后逐步向更细粒度的成对文档排序需求转移。在我们的实验中，我们应用了一个简单的 CL-DRD 框架实现来增强两个最先进的稠密检索模型。在三个公共通道检索数据集上的实验证明了该框架的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Curriculum+Learning+for+Dense+Retrieval+Distillation)|7|
|[Constructing Better Evaluation Metrics by Incorporating the Anchoring Effect into the User Model](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531953)|Nuo Chen, Fan Zhang, Tetsuya Sakai|Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan; Wuhan University, Wuhan, China|Models of existing evaluation metrics assume that users are rational decision-makers trying to pursue maximised utility. However, studies in behavioural economics show that people are not always rational when making decisions. Previous studies showed that the anchoring effect can influence the relevance judgement of a document. In this paper, we challenge the rational user assumption and introduce the anchoring effect into user models. We first propose a framework for query-level evaluation metrics by incorporating the anchoring effect into the user model. In the framework, the magnitude of the anchoring effect is related to the quality of the previous document. We then apply our framework to several query-level evaluation metrics and compare them with their vanilla version as the baseline in terms of user satisfaction on a publicly available search dataset. As a result, our Anchoring-aware Metrics (AMs) outperformed their baselines in term of correlation with user satisfaction. The result suggests that we can better predict user query satisfaction feedbacks by incorporating the anchoring effect into user models of existing evaluating metrics. As far as we know, we are the first to introduce the anchoring effect into information retrieval evaluation metrics. Our findings provide a perspective from behavioural economics to better understand user behaviour and satisfaction in search interaction.|现有的评估指标模型假设用户是理性的决策者，试图追求效用最大化。然而，行为经济学的研究表明，人们在做决定时并不总是理性的。先前的研究表明，锚定效应可以影响文档的相关性判断。在本文中，我们挑战了理性的用户假设，并将锚定效应引入到用户模型中。我们首先通过将锚定效应整合到用户模型中，提出了一个查询级评估度量的框架。在框架中，锚定效应的大小与前一份文件的质量有关。然后，我们将框架应用于几个查询级评估指标，并将它们与普通版本进行比较，作为公开可用搜索数据集上用户满意度的基线。因此，我们的锚定感知度量(AMs)在与用户满意度的相关性方面表现优于他们的基线。结果表明，我们可以更好地预测用户查询满意度反馈，将锚定效应纳入用户模型的现有评估指标。据我们所知，我们是第一个将锚定效应引入信息检索评估指标的公司。我们的研究结果提供了一个从行为经济学的角度来更好地理解用户行为和搜索互动的满意度。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Constructing+Better+Evaluation+Metrics+by+Incorporating+the+Anchoring+Effect+into+the+User+Model)|7|

|[An Efficiency Study for SPLADE Models](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531833)|Carlos Lassance, Stéphane Clinchant|Naver Labs Europe, Meylan, France|Latency and efficiency issues are often overlooked when evaluating IR models based on Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) in reason of multiple hardware and software testing scenarios. Nevertheless, efficiency is an important part of such systems and should not be overlooked. In this paper, we focus on improving the efficiency of the SPLADE model since it has achieved state-of-the-art zero-shot performance and competitive results on TREC collections. SPLADE efficiency can be controlled via a regularization factor, but solely controlling this regularization has been shown to not be efficient enough. In order to reduce the latency gap between SPLADE and traditional retrieval systems, we propose several techniques including L1 regularization for queries, a separation of document/query encoders, a FLOPS-regularized middle-training, and the use of faster query encoders. Our benchmark demonstrates that we can drastically improve the efficiency of these models while increasing the performance metrics on in-domain data. To our knowledge, we propose the first neural models that, under the same computing constraints, achieve similar latency (less than 4ms difference) as traditional BM25, while having similar performance (less than 10% [email protected] reduction) as the state-of-the-art single-stage neural rankers on in-domain data.|在评估基于预训练语言模型(PLM)的 IR 模型时，由于存在多种硬件和软件测试场景，延迟和效率问题常常被忽视。然而，效率是这些系统的一个重要组成部分，不应该被忽视。在本文中，我们关注于提高 SPLADE 模型的效率，因为它已经实现了最先进的零拍性能和 TREC 集合的竞争结果。SPLADE 的效率可以通过一个正则化因子来控制，但仅仅控制这个正则化因子是不够有效的。为了减少 SPLADE 与传统检索系统之间的延迟差距，我们提出了几种技术，包括查询的 L1正则化、文档/查询编码器的分离、 FLOPS 正则化的中间训练以及使用更快的查询编码器。我们的基准测试表明，我们可以大大提高这些模型的效率，同时提高域内数据的性能指标。据我们所知，我们提出了第一个神经模型，在相同的计算约束下，实现与传统 BM25相似的延迟(小于4ms 的差异) ，同时具有与领域内数据的最先进的单阶段神经排序相似的性能(少于10% [电子邮件保护]减少)。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=An+Efficiency+Study+for+SPLADE+Models)|6|
|[Improving Conversational Recommender Systems via Transformer-based Sequential Modelling](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531852)|Jie Zou, Evangelos Kanoulas, Pengjie Ren, Zhaochun Ren, Aixin Sun, Cheng Long|University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; Shandong University, Qingdao, China; [email protected]|In Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs), conversations usually involve a set of related items and entities e.g., attributes of items. These items and entities are mentioned in order following the development of a dialogue. In other words, potential sequential dependencies exist in conversations. However, most of the existing CRSs neglect these potential sequential dependencies. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-based sequential conversational recommendation method, named TSCR, which models the sequential dependencies in the conversations to improve CRS. We represent conversations by items and entities, and construct user sequences to discover user preferences by considering both mentioned items and entities. Based on the constructed sequences, we deploy a Cloze task to predict the recommended items along a sequence. Experimental results demonstrate that our TSCR model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.|在会话推荐系统(CRS)中，会话通常涉及一组相关的项目和实体，例如，项目的属性。这些项目和实体将在对话发展之后按顺序提及。换句话说，潜在的顺序依赖性存在于会话中。然而，大多数现有的 CRS 忽略了这些潜在的顺序依赖关系。本文提出了一种基于变压器的顺序会话推荐方法 TSCR，该方法通过建立会话中的顺序依赖关系来改进 CRS。我们通过条目和实体表示会话，并通过考虑上述条目和实体构造用户序列来发现用户偏好。基于构造的序列，我们部署完形填空任务来预测一个序列中推荐的项目。实验结果表明，我们的 TSCR 模型明显优于最先进的基线。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Improving+Conversational+Recommender+Systems+via+Transformer-based+Sequential+Modelling)|5|
|[BERT-ER: Query-specific BERT Entity Representations for Entity Ranking](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531944)|Shubham Chatterjee, Laura Dietz|University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH, USA|Entity-oriented search systems often learn vector representations of entities via the introductory paragraph from the Wikipedia page of the entity. As such representations are the same for every query, our hypothesis is that the representations are not ideal for IR tasks. In this work, we present BERT Entity Representations (BERT-ER) which are query-specific vector representations of entities obtained from text that describes how an entity is relevant for a query. Using BERT-ER in a downstream entity ranking system, we achieve a performance improvement of 13-42% (Mean Average Precision) over a system that uses the BERT embedding of the introductory paragraph from Wikipedia on two large-scale test collections. Our approach also outperforms entity ranking systems using entity embeddings from Wikipedia2Vec, ERNIE, and E-BERT. We show that our entity ranking system using BERT-ER can increase precision at the top of the ranking by promoting relevant entities to the top. With this work, we release our BERT models and query-specific entity embeddings fine-tuned for the entity ranking task.|面向实体的搜索系统通常通过实体的 Wikipedia 页面中的介绍性段落学习实体的向量表示。由于这种表示对于每个查询都是相同的，我们的假设是，这种表示对于 IR 任务来说并不理想。在这项工作中，我们提出了 BERT 实体表示(BERT-ER) ，它是从文本中获得的实体的特定于查询的向量表示，描述了一个实体如何与一个查询相关。在下游实体排名系统中使用 BERT-ER，我们比在两个大规模测试集合中使用 BERT 嵌入的介绍性段落的系统获得了13-42% 的性能提高(均值平均精度)。我们的方法也优于使用 Wikipedia2Vec、 ERNIE 和 E-BERT 的实体嵌入的实体排序系统。结果表明，使用 BERT-ER 的实体排名系统可以通过将相关实体提升到顶端来提高排名的精度。通过这项工作，我们发布了我们的 BERT 模型和针对实体排序任务的查询特定实体嵌入。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=BERT-ER:+Query-specific+BERT+Entity+Representations+for+Entity+Ranking)|5|
|[Reduce, Reuse, Recycle: Green Information Retrieval Research](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531766)|Harrisen Scells, Shengyao Zhuang, Guido Zuccon|The University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia|Recent advances in Information Retrieval utilise energy-intensive hardware to produce state-of-the-art results. In areas of research highly related to Information Retrieval, such as Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning, there have been efforts to quantify and reduce the power and emissions produced by methods that depend on such hardware. Research that is conscious of the environmental impacts of its experimentation and takes steps to mitigate some of these impacts is considered 'Green'. Given the continuous demand for more data and power-hungry techniques, Green research is likely to become more important within the broader research community. Therefore, within the Information Retrieval community, the consequences of non-Green (in other words, Red) research should at least be considered and acknowledged. As such, the aims of this perspective paper are fourfold: (1) to review the Green literature not only for Information Retrieval but also for related domains in order to identify transferable Green techniques; (2) to provide measures for quantifying the power usage and emissions of Information Retrieval research; (3) to report the power usage and emission impacts for various current IR methods; and (4) to provide a framework to guide Green Information Retrieval research, taking inspiration from 'reduce, reuse, recycle' waste management campaigns, including salient examples from the literature that implement these concepts.|最近在信息检索方面的进展利用能源密集型硬件来产生最先进的结果。在与信息检索高度相关的研究领域，如自然语言处理和机器学习，一直在努力量化和减少依赖这些硬件的方法所产生的功率和排放。意识到实验对环境的影响并采取措施减轻其中一些影响的研究被认为是“绿色”的。鉴于对更多数据和耗电技术的持续需求，绿色研究可能在更广泛的研究领域变得更加重要。因此，在信息检索社区内，非绿色(换句话说，红色)研究的后果至少应该被考虑和承认。因此，本文件的目的有四个: (1)不仅为信息检索而且为相关领域查阅绿色文献，以便确定可转用的绿色技术; (2)提供量化信息检索研究的用电量和排放量的措施; (3)报告各种现行红外线方法的用电量和排放影响; (4)提供一个框架，以指导绿色信息检索研究，从“减少、再使用、回收”废物管理运动中获得启发，包括实施这些概念的文献中的突出例子。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Reduce,+Reuse,+Recycle:+Green+Information+Retrieval+Research)|5|
|[On-Device Next-Item Recommendation with Self-Supervised Knowledge Distillation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531775)|Xin Xia, Hongzhi Yin, Junliang Yu, Qinyong Wang, Guandong Xu, Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen|The University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia; Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia; Baidu Inc., Beijing, China; University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia|Session-based recommender systems (SBR) are becoming increasingly popular because they can predict user interests without relying on long-term user profile and support login-free recommendation. Modern recommender systems operate in a fully server-based fashion. To cater to millions of users, the frequent model maintaining and the high-speed processing for concurrent user requests are required, which comes at the cost of a huge carbon footprint. Meanwhile, users need to upload their behavior data even including the immediate environmental context to the server, raising the public concern about privacy. On-device recommender systems circumvent these two issues with cost-conscious settings and local inference. However, due to the limited memory and computing resources, on-device recommender systems are confronted with two fundamental challenges: (1) how to reduce the size of regular models to fit edge devices? (2) how to retain the original capacity? Previous research mostly adopts tensor decomposition techniques to compress regular recommendation models with low compression rates so as to avoid drastic performance degradation. In this paper, we explore ultra-compact models for next-item recommendation, by loosing the constraint of dimensionality consistency in tensor decomposition. To compensate for the capacity loss caused by compression, we develop a self-supervised knowledge distillation framework which enables the compressed model (student) to distill the essential information lying in the raw data, and improves the long-tail item recommendation through an embedding-recombination strategy with the original model (teacher). The extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that, with 30x size reduction, the compressed model almost comes with no accuracy loss, and even outperforms its uncompressed counterpart.

|[DisenCDR: Learning Disentangled Representations for Cross-Domain Recommendation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531967)|Jiangxia Cao, Xixun Lin, Xin Cong, Jing Ya, Tingwen Liu, Bin Wang|Xiaomi Inc., Beijing, China; Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences & University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China|Data sparsity is a long-standing problem in recommender systems. To alleviate it, Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) has attracted a surge of interests, which utilizes the rich user-item interaction information from the related source domain to improve the performance on the sparse target domain. Recent CDR approaches pay attention to aggregating the source domain information to generate better user representations for the target domain. However, they focus on designing more powerful interaction encoders to learn both domains simultaneously, but fail to model different user preferences of different domains. Particularly, domain-specific preferences of the source domain usually provide useless information to enhance the performance in the target domain, and directly aggregating the domain-shared and domain-specific information together maybe hurts target domain performance. This work considers a key challenge of CDR: How do we transfer shared information across domains? Grounded in the information theory, we propose DisenCDR, a novel model to disentangle the domain-shared and domain-specific information. To reach our goal, we propose two mutual-information-based disentanglement regularizers. Specifically, an exclusive regularizer aims to enforce the user domain-shared representations and domain-specific representations encoding exclusive information. An information regularizer is to encourage the user domain-shared representations encoding predictive information for both domains. Based on them, we further derive a tractable bound of our disentanglement objective to learn desirable disentangled representations. Extensive experiments show that DisenCDR achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines on four real-world datasets.|数据稀疏是推荐系统中一个长期存在的问题。为了解决这一问题，跨域推荐技术(CDR)引起了人们的极大兴趣，它利用来自相关源域的丰富的用户项交互信息来提高稀疏目标域的性能。最近的 CDR 方法注重聚合源域信息，以便为目标域生成更好的用户表示。然而，他们专注于设计更强大的交互编码器来同时学习这两个域，但未能建模不同域的不同用户偏好。特别地，源域的特定领域偏好通常提供无用的信息来提高目标域的性能，直接将共享的和特定领域的信息聚合在一起可能会损害目标域的性能。这项工作认为 CDR 的一个关键挑战是: 我们如何跨域传输共享信息？在信息论的基础上，提出了一种新的区分领域共享信息和特定领域信息的模型 DisenCDR。为了达到这个目标，我们提出了两个基于互信息的解纠缠正则化器。具体地说，独占正则化程序旨在强制用户域共享表示和编码独占信息的特定于域的表示。信息正则化器是鼓励用户域共享表示，对两个域的预测信息进行编码。在此基础上，我们进一步推导出我们的解纠缠目标的一个易处理的界，以学习理想的解纠缠表示。大量的实验表明，DisenCDR 在四个真实世界的数据集上比最先进的基线获得了显著的改进。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=DisenCDR:+Learning+Disentangled+Representations+for+Cross-Domain+Recommendation)|5|
|[Personalized Fashion Compatibility Modeling via Metapath-guided Heterogeneous Graph Learning](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3532038)|Weili Guan, Fangkai Jiao, Xuemeng Song, Haokun Wen, ChungHsing Yeh, Xiaojun Chang|Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia; Shandong University, Qingdao, China; University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia|Fashion Compatibility Modeling (FCM) is a new yet challenging task, which aims to automatically access the matching degree among a set of complementary items. Most of existing methods evaluate the fashion compatibility from the common perspective, but overlook the user's personal preference. Inspired by this, a few pioneers study the Personalized Fashion Compatibility Modeling (PFCM). Despite their significance, these PFCM methods mainly concentrate on the user and item entities, as well as their interactions, but ignore the attribute entities, which contain rich semantics. To address this problem, we propose to fully explore the related entities and their relations involved in PFCM to boost the PFCM performance. This is, however, non-trivial due to the heterogeneous contents of different entities, embeddings for new users, and various high-order relations. Towards these ends, we present a novel metapath-guided personalized fashion compatibility modeling, dubbed as MG-PFCM. In particular, we creatively build a heterogeneous graph to unify the three types of entities (i.e., users, items, and attributes) and their relations (i.e., user-item interactions, item-item matching relations, and item-attribute association relations). Thereafter, we design a multi-modal content-oriented user embedding module to learn user representations by inheriting the contents of their interacted items. Meanwhile, we define the user-oriented and item-oriented metapaths, and perform the metapath-guided heterogeneous graph learning to enhance the user and item embeddings. In addition, we introduce the contrastive regularization to improve the model performance. We conduct extensive experiments on the real-world benchmark dataset, which verifies the superiority of our proposed scheme over several cutting-edge baselines. As a byproduct, we have released our source codes to benefit other researchers.|时尚相容性建模(FCM)是一项新兴的具有挑战性的任务，其目标是自动获取一组互补项之间的匹配度。大多数现有的方法从一般的角度评估时尚兼容性，但是忽略了用户的个人偏好。受此启发，一些先驱者开始研究个性化时尚兼容性建模(PFCM)。尽管其重要性，这些 PFCM 方法主要集中在用户和项目实体，以及它们的交互，但是忽略了属性实体，其中包含丰富的语义。为了解决这一问题，我们建议充分探讨 PFCM 中涉及的相关实体及其关系，以提高 PFCM 的性能。然而，由于不同实体的内容异构、新用户的嵌入以及各种高阶关系，这是非常重要的。为此，我们提出了一种新的元路径引导的个性化时尚兼容性模型，称为 MG-PFCM。特别是，我们创造性地构建了一个异构图来统一三种类型的实体(即用户、项目和属性)及其关系(即用户-项目交互、项目-项目匹配关系和项目-属性关系)。然后，我们设计了一个面向多模态内容的用户嵌入模块，通过继承用户交互项的内容来学习用户表示。同时，定义了面向用户和面向项目的元路径，并通过元路径引导的异构图学习来增强用户和项目的嵌入。此外，为了提高模型的性能，我们引入了对比正则化方法。我们在现实世界的基准数据集上进行了广泛的实验，验证了我们提出的方案相对于几个前沿基线的优越性。作为一个副产品，我们已经发布了我们的源代码，以利于其他研究人员。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Personalized+Fashion+Compatibility+Modeling+via+Metapath-guided+Heterogeneous+Graph+Learning)|5|

This information is critical for recommender system designers to understand the intrinsic recommendation mechanism and provides insights on how to improve model fairness to decision makers. Fortunately, with the rapid development of Explainable AI, we can use model explainability to gain insights into model (un)fairness. In this paper, we study the problem ofexplainable fairness, which helps to gain insights about why a system is fair or unfair, and guides the design of fair recommender systems with a more informed and unified methodology. Particularly, we focus on a common setting with feature-aware recommendation and exposure unfairness, but the proposed explainable fairness framework is general and can be applied to other recommendation settings and fairness definitions. We propose a Counterfactual Explainable Fairness framework, called CEF, which generates explanations about model fairness that can improve the fairness without significantly hurting the performance. The CEF framework formulates an optimization problem to learn the "minimal'' change of the input features that changes the recommendation results to a certain level of fairness. Based on the counterfactual recommendation result of each feature, we calculate an explainability score in terms of the fairness-utility trade-off to rank all the feature-based explanations, and select the top ones as fairness explanations. Experimental results on several real-world datasets validate that our method is able to effectively provide explanations to the model disparities and these explanations can achieve better fairness-utility trade-off when using them for recommendation than all the baselines.|现有关于公平意识推荐的研究主要集中在公平性的量化和公平推荐模型的发展两个方面，这两个方面都没有研究更实质性的问题——确定推荐模型差异的根本原因。这些信息对于推荐系统设计者理解内在的推荐机制至关重要，并为如何提高模型对决策者的公平性提供了见解。幸运的是，随着可解释人工智能的快速发展，我们可以利用模型可解释性来深入了解模型(非)公平性。本文通过对解释公平问题的研究，有助于深入了解一个系统为什么是公平或不公平的，并以一种更为知情和统一的方法论指导公平推荐系统的设计。特别地，我们关注的是一个具有特征感知推荐和暴露不公平性的公共设置，但是提出的可解释公平性框架是通用的，可以应用于其他推荐设置和公平性定义。我们提出了一个反事实可解释的公平性框架，称为 CEF，它生成了对模型公平性的解释，可以在不严重损害绩效的情况下提高公平性。基金框架制定了一个最佳化问题，让学生了解输入功能的「最小」改变，会令推荐结果有一定程度的公平性。基于每个特征的反事实推荐结果，以公平-效用权衡的方式计算可解释性得分，对所有基于特征的解释进行排序，并选择最高的解释作为公平解释。在实际数据集上的实验结果验证了该方法能够有效地解释模型间的差异，并且这些解释在使用它们进行推荐时能够比所有基线更好地实现公平-效用的权衡。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Explainable+Fairness+in+Recommendation)|5|

Evaluating these lists for their fairness along with other traditional metrics provides a more complete understanding of an information access system's behavior beyond accuracy or utility constructs. To measure the (un)fairness of rankings, particularly with respect to the protected group(s) of producers or providers, several metrics have been proposed in the last several years. However, an empirical and comparative analyses of these metrics showing the applicability to specific scenario or real data, conceptual similarities, and differences is still lacking. We aim to bridge the gap between theoretical and practical ap-plication of these metrics. In this paper we describe several fair ranking metrics from the existing literature in a common notation, enabling direct comparison of their approaches and assumptions, and empirically compare them on the same experimental setup and data sets in the context of three information access tasks. We also provide a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of the design choices and parameter settings that go in to these metrics and point to additional work needed to improve fairness measurement.|信息访问系统，例如搜索和推荐系统，经常使用排名列表来显示被认为与用户信息需求相关的结果。评估这些列表的公平性以及其他传统指标，可以更全面地了解信息访问系统的行为，而不仅仅是准确性或效用结构。为了衡量排名的(不)公平性，特别是对于受保护的生产者或提供者群体，在过去几年中已经提出了几个指标。然而，对这些指标的实证和比较分析表明适用于具体情景或实际数据，概念上的相似性和差异仍然缺乏。我们的目标是弥合这些指标的理论和实际应用之间的差距。在本文中，我们描述了几个公平排序度量从现有的文献在一个共同的符号，使直接比较他们的方法和假设，并经验比较他们在相同的实验设置和数据集在三个信息访问任务的背景下。我们还提供了一个敏感度分析来评估设计选择和参数设置对这些指标的影响，并指出改善公平性度量所需的额外工作。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Measuring+Fairness+in+Ranked+Results:+An+Analytical+and+Empirical+Comparison)|5|

Currently, such structured information is totally ignored by pre-trained models which are trained solely based on text content. In this paper, we propose to leverage large-scale web pages and their DOM (Document Object Model) tree structures to pre-train models for information retrieval. We argue that using the hierarchical structure contained in web pages, we can get richer contextual information for training better language models. To exploit this kind of information, we devise four pre-training objectives based on the structure of web pages, then pre-train a Transformer model towards these tasks jointly with traditional masked language model objective.

This largely limits the credibility and practical value of research results in this field. To tackle these issues, we present an initiative project aimed for open benchmarking for recommender systems. In contrast to some earlier attempts towards this goal, we take one further step by setting up a standardized benchmarking pipeline for reproducible research, which integrates all the details about datasets, source code, hyper-parameter settings, running logs, and evaluation results. The benchmark is designed with comprehensiveness and sustainability in mind. It spans both matching and ranking tasks, and also allows anyone to easily follow and contribute.

Although existing methods have achieved great success, they still suffer from three key limitations: 1) overlook the benefit of pre-training, 2) lack the representation-level supervision, and 3) ignore the diversity of the seller-generated data. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose a Vision-to-Prompt based multi-modal product summary generation framework, dubbed as V2P, where a Generative Pre-trained Language Model (GPLM) is adopted as the backbone. In particular, to maintain the original text capability of the GPLM and fully utilize the high-level concepts contained in the product image, we design V2P with two key components: vision-based prominent attribute prediction, and attribute prompt-guided summary generation. The first component works on obtaining the vital semantic attributes of the product from its image by the Swin Transformer, while the second component aims to generate the summary based on the product's long text description and the attribute prompts yielded by the first component with a GPLM. Towards comprehensive supervision over the second component, apart from the conventional output-level supervision, we introduce the representation-level regularization. Meanwhile, we design the data augmentation-based robustness regularization to handle the diverse inputs and improve the robustness of the second component.

Recent studies reveal that rumor verification and stance detection are two relevant tasks that can jointly enhance each other despite their differences. For example, rumors can be debunked by cross-checking the stances conveyed by their relevant posts, and stances are also conditioned on the nature of the rumor. However, stance detection typically requires a large training set of labeled stances at post level, which are rare and costly to annotate. Enlightened by Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) scheme, we propose a novel weakly supervised joint learning framework for rumor verification and stance detection which only requires bag-level class labels concerning the rumor's veracity. Specifically, based on the propagation trees of source posts, we convert the two multi-class problems into multiple MIL-based binary classification problems where each binary model is focused on differentiating a target class (of rumor or stance) from the remaining classes. Then, we propose a hierarchical attention mechanism to aggregate the binary predictions, including (1) a bottom-up/top-down tree attention layer to aggregate binary stances into binary veracity; and (2) a discriminative attention layer to aggregate the binary class into finer-grained classes.

Hence, we propose a comprehensive framework to model user behaviors through positive feedback (i.e., the articles they spend more time on) and negative feedback (i.e., the articles they choose to skip without clicking in). Moreover, the framework implicitly models the user using their session start time, and the article using its initial publishing time, in what we call neutral feedback.

Exploring the fine-grained relationship of items behind the users' multi-behavior interactions is critical in improving the performance of recommender systems. Despite the great successes, existing methods seem to have limitations on modelling heterogeneous item-level multi-behavior dependencies, capturing diverse multi-behavior sequential dynamics, or alleviating data sparsity problems. In this paper, we show it is possible to derive a framework to address all the above three limitations. The proposed framework MB-STR, a Multi-Behavior Sequential Transformer Recommender, is equipped with the multi-behavior transformer layer (MB-Trans), the multi-behavior sequential pattern generator (MB-SPG) and the behavior-aware prediction module (BA-Pred).

|[News Recommendation with Candidate-aware User Modeling](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531778)|Tao Qi, Fangzhao Wu, Chuhan Wu, Yongfeng Huang|Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China; Tsinghua University, Beijing, China|News recommendation aims to match news with personalized user interest. Existing methods for news recommendation usually model user interest from historical clicked news without the consideration of candidate news. However, each user usually has multiple interests, and it is difficult for these methods to accurately match a candidate news with a specific user interest. In this paper, we present a candidate-aware user modeling method for personalized news recommendation, which can incorporate candidate news into user modeling for better matching between candidate news and user interest. We propose a candidate-aware self-attention network that uses candidate news as clue to model candidate-aware global user interest. In addition, we propose a candidate-aware CNN network to incorporate candidate news into local behavior context modeling and learn candidate-aware short-term user interest. Besides, we use a candidate-aware attention network to aggregate previously clicked news weighted by their relevance with candidate news to build candidate-aware user representation. Experiments on real-world datasets show the effectiveness of our method in improving news recommendation performance.|新闻推荐旨在使新闻与个性化的用户兴趣相匹配。现有的新闻推荐方法通常根据历史点击新闻建立用户兴趣模型，而不考虑候选新闻。然而，每个用户通常有多个兴趣，这些方法很难准确地匹配一个候选新闻和一个特定的用户兴趣。提出了一种基于候选者感知的个性化新闻推荐用户建模方法，该方法将候选新闻融入到用户建模中，以更好地匹配候选新闻和用户兴趣。我们提出了一个以候选新闻为线索的候选感知自我注意网络，该网络对全球候选感知用户兴趣进行建模。此外，我们提出了一个候选人感知的 CNN 网络，将候选人新闻纳入本地行为上下文建模，并学习候选人感知的短期用户兴趣。此外，我们利用一个候选人感知的注意网络来聚合先前点击过的新闻，并根据它们与候选人新闻的相关性来加权，从而建立一个候选人感知的用户表示。在实际数据集上的实验结果表明了该方法在提高新闻推荐性能方面的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=News+Recommendation+with+Candidate-aware+User+Modeling)|4|
|[Price DOES Matter!: Modeling Price and Interest Preferences in Session-based Recommendation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3532043)|Xiaokun Zhang, Bo Xu, Liang Yang, Chenliang Li, Fenglong Ma, Haifeng Liu, Hongfei Lin|Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Pennsylvania State University, Pennsylvania, PA, USA; Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China|Session-based recommendation aims to predict items that an anonymous user would like to purchase based on her short behavior sequence. The current approaches towards session-based recommendation only focus on modeling users' interest preferences, while they all ignore a key attribute of an item, i.e., the price. Many marketing studies have shown that the price factor significantly influences users' behaviors and the purchase decisions of users are determined by both price and interest preferences simultaneously. However, it is nontrivial to incorporate price preferences for session-based recommendation. Firstly, it is hard to handle heterogeneous information from various features of items to capture users' price preferences. Secondly, it is difficult to model the complex relations between price and interest preferences in determining user choices. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel method Co-guided Heterogeneous Hypergraph Network (CoHHN) for session-based recommendation. Towards the first challenge, we devise a heterogeneous hypergraph to represent heterogeneous information and rich relations among them. A dual-channel aggregating mechanism is then designed to aggregate various information in the heterogeneous hypergraph. After that, we extract users' price preferences and interest preferences via attention layers. As to the second challenge, a co-guided learning scheme is designed to model the relations between price and interest preferences and enhance the learning of each other. Finally, we predict user actions based on item features and users' price and interest preferences. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CoHHN. Further analysis reveals the significance of price for session-based recommendation.|基于会话的推荐旨在根据匿名用户的短行为序列预测其想要购买的商品。当前基于会话的推荐方法只关注于建模用户的兴趣偏好，而他们都忽略了一个项目的关键属性，即价格。许多市场研究表明，价格因素对用户行为有显著影响，用户的购买决策同时由价格和利益偏好决定。然而，为基于会话的推荐引入价格偏好并非易事。首先，很难处理来自商品不同特征的异构信息来捕捉用户的价格偏好;。其次，在决定用户选择时，很难建立价格和利益偏好之间的复杂关系模型。针对上述挑战，我们提出了一种基于会话的协同引导异构超图网络(CoHHN)的推荐方法。针对第一个挑战，我们设计了一个异构超图来表示异构信息和它们之间的丰富关系。然后设计了一种双通道聚集机制来聚集异构超图中的各种信息。然后，通过注意层提取用户的价格偏好和兴趣偏好。针对第二个挑战，设计了一个共同导向学习方案，以建立价格和兴趣偏好之间的关系模型，并加强相互之间的学习。最后，根据商品特征以及用户的价格和兴趣偏好对用户行为进行预测。在三个真实世界数据集上的大量实验证明了所提出的 CoHHN 算法的有效性。进一步的分析揭示了基于会话的推荐价格的重要性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Price+DOES+Matter!:+Modeling+Price+and+Interest+Preferences+in+Session-based+Recommendation)|4|

However, session embedding learned by a non-linear encoder is usually not in the same representation space as item embeddings, resulting in the inconsistent prediction issue while recommending items. To address this issue, we propose a simple and effective framework named CORE, which can unify the representation space for both the encoding and decoding processes. Firstly, we design a representation-consistent encoder that takes the linear combination of input item embeddings as session embedding, guaranteeing that sessions and items are in the same representation space. Besides, we propose a robust distance measuring method to prevent overfitting of embeddings in the consistent representation space. Extensive experiments conducted on five public real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.

These encoded biases can influence the decision of a recommendation system (RS) towards further separation of the contents provided to various demographic subgroups, and raise privacy concerns regarding the disclosure of users' protected attributes. In this work, we investigate the possibility and challenges of removing specific protected information of users from the learned interaction representations of a RS algorithm, while maintaining its effectiveness. Specifically, we incorporate adversarial training into the state-of-the-art MultVAE architecture, resulting in a novel model, Adversarial Variational Auto-Encoder with Multinomial Likelihood (Adv-MultVAE), which aims at removing the implicit information of protected attributes while preserving recommendation performance. We conduct experiments on the MovieLens-1M and LFM-2b-DemoBias datasets, and evaluate the effectiveness of the bias mitigation method based on the inability of external attackers in revealing the users' gender information from the model. Comparing with baseline MultVAE, the results show that Adv-MultVAE, with marginal deterioration in performance (w.r.t.

Previous studies mainly focus on user behavior modelling, while few of them consider candidate item representations. This makes the models strongly dependent on user representations, and less effective when user behavior is sparse. Furthermore, most existing works regard the candidate item as one fixed embedding and ignore the multi-representational characteristics of the item. To handle the above issues, we propose a Deep multi-Representational Item NetworK (DRINK) for CTR prediction. Specifically, to tackle the sparse user behavior problem, we construct a sequence of interacting users and timestamps to represent the candidate item; to dynamically capture the characteristics of the item, we propose a transformer-based multi-representational item network consisting of a multi-CLS representation submodule and contextualized global item representation submodule. In addition, we propose to decouple the time information and item behavior to avoid information overwhelming. Outputs of the above components are concatenated and fed into a MLP layer to fit the CTR.

However, this problem is perceptibly complex because various data trends need to be considered together. This includes the spatial locations, temporal contexts, user's preferences, etc. Most existing studies view the next POI recommendation as a sequence prediction problem while omitting the collaborative signals from other users. Instead, we propose a user-agnostic global trajectory flow map and a novel Graph Enhanced Transformer model (GETNext) to better exploit the extensive collaborative signals for a more accurate next POI prediction, and alleviate the cold start problem in the meantime. GETNext incorporates the global transition patterns, user's general preference, spatio-temporal context, and time-aware category embeddings together into a transformer model to make the prediction of user's future moves. With this design, our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with a large margin and also sheds light on the cold start challenges within the spatio-temporal involved recommendation problems.|下一个 POI 建议旨在根据用户当前的状态和历史信息预测用户近期的动向，从而为用户和服务提供商带来巨大的价值。然而，这个问题显然很复杂，因为各种数据趋势需要一起考虑。这包括空间位置、时间上下文、用户偏好等。大多数现有的研究认为下一个 POI 建议是一个序列预测问题，而忽略了来自其他用户的协作信号。相反，我们提出了一个用户无关的全局轨迹流图和一个新的图形增强变压器模型(GETNext) ，以更好地利用广泛的协作信号来更准确地预测下一个 POI，同时缓解冷启动问题。GETNext 将全局转换模式、用户的一般偏好、时空上下文和时间感知类别嵌入到一个转换器模型中，对用户的未来动向进行预测。通过这种设计，我们的模型在很大程度上优于最先进的方法，同时也揭示了涉及时空的推荐问题中的冷启动挑战。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=GETNext:+Trajectory+Flow+Map+Enhanced+Transformer+for+Next+POI+Recommendation)|4|
|[ReCANet: A Repeat Consumption-Aware Neural Network for Next Basket Recommendation in Grocery Shopping](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531708)|Mozhdeh Ariannezhad, Sami Jullien, Ming Li, Min Fang, Sebastian Schelter, Maarten de Rijke|Albert Heijn, Zaandam, Netherlands; University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands|Retailers such as grocery stores or e-marketplaces often have vast selections of items for users to choose from. Predicting a user's next purchases has gained attention recently, in the form of next basket recommendation (NBR), as it facilitates navigating extensive assortments for users. Neural network-based models that focus on learning basket representations are the dominant approach in the recent literature. However, these methods do not consider the specific characteristics of the grocery shopping scenario, where users shop for grocery items on a regular basis, and grocery items are repurchased frequently by the same user. In this paper, we first gain a data-driven understanding of users' repeat consumption behavior through an empirical study on six public and proprietary grocery shopping transaction datasets. We discover that, averaged over all datasets, over 54% of NBR performance in terms of recall comes from repeat items: items that users have already purchased in their history, which constitute only 1% of the total collection of items on average. A NBR model with a strong focus on previously purchased items can potentially achieve high performance. We introduce ReCANet, a repeat consumption-aware neural network that explicitly models the repeat consumption behavior of users in order to predict their next basket. ReCANet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models for the NBR task, in terms of recall and nDCG. We perform an ablation study and show that all of the components of ReCANet contribute to its performance, and demonstrate that a user's repetition ratio has a direct influence on the treatment effect of ReCANet.|零售商，如杂货店或电子市场往往有大量的商品供用户选择。最近，预测用户的下一次购买以下一篮子推荐(NBR)的形式引起了人们的注意，因为它有助于为用户导航广泛的分类。基于神经网络的模型集中在学习篮表示是最近文献中的主要方法。但是，这些方法没有考虑杂货店购物场景的具体特征，在这个场景中，用户定期购买杂货店商品，并且杂货店商品由同一个用户频繁地重新购买。本文首先通过对六个公共和私有杂货店购物交易数据集的实证研究，获得了用户重复消费行为的数据驱动理解。我们发现，在所有数据集中，平均而言，超过54% 的 NBR 的召回性能来自重复项目: 用户在历史上已经购买的项目，平均只占项目总数的1% 。NBR 模型强调先前购买的商品，可能获得高性能。我们介绍 ReCANet，一个重复消费感知的神经网络，明确地模拟用户的重复消费行为，以便预测他们的下一个篮子。就召回和 nDCG 而言，ReCANet 在 NBR 任务中的表现明显优于最先进的模型。我们进行了一个消融研究，表明所有组件的 ReCANet 有助于其性能，并表明用户的重复率直接影响治疗效果的 ReCANet。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=ReCANet:+A+Repeat+Consumption-Aware+Neural+Network+for+Next+Basket+Recommendation+in+Grocery+Shopping)|4|

By utilizing the auxiliary review information accompanied with user ratings, many of the existing review-based recommendation models enriched user/item embedding learning ability with historical reviews or better modeled user-item interactions with the help of available user-item target reviews. Though significant progress has been made, we argue that current solutions for review-based recommendation suffer from two drawbacks. First, as review-based recommendation can be naturally formed as a user-item bipartite graph with edge features from corresponding user-item reviews, how to better exploit this unique graph structure for recommendation? Second, while most current models suffer from limited user behaviors, can we exploit the unique self-supervised signals in the review-aware graph to guide two recommendation components better? To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel Review-aware Graph Contrastive Learning (RGCL) framework for review-based recommendation. Specifically, we first construct a review-aware user-item graph with feature-enhanced edges from reviews, where each edge feature is composed of both the user-item rating and the corresponding review semantics. This graph with feature-enhanced edges can help attentively learn each neighbor node weight for user and item representation learning. After that, we design two additional contrastive learning tasks (i.e., Node Discrimination and Edge Discrimination) to provide self-supervised signals for the two components in recommendation process. Finally, extensive experiments over five benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed RGCL compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.|大多数现代推荐系统通过两个组件来预测用户的偏好: 用户和项目嵌入学习，然后是用户-项目交互建模。许多现有的基于评论的推荐模型利用辅助评论信息和用户评分，通过历史评论丰富了用户/项目嵌入学习能力，或者利用现有的用户-项目目标评价更好地模拟了用户-项目交互。虽然取得了重大进展，但我们认为，目前基于审查的建议解决方案存在两个缺陷。首先，由于基于评论的推荐可以自然地形成一个具有相应用户评论边缘特征的用户项目二分图，如何更好地利用这种独特的图结构进行推荐？其次，当前大多数模型都受到用户行为的限制，我们能否利用评论感知图中唯一的自我监督信号来更好地指导两个推荐组件？为此，本文提出了一种新的基于评论的图形对比学习(RGCL)框架。具体来说，我们首先构建一个评论感知的用户项目图，该图具有来自评论的特征增强的边缘，其中每个边缘特征由用户项目评分和相应的评论语义组成。该图具有特征增强的边，可以帮助用户认真学习每个邻居节点的权重和项目表示学习。然后，我们设计了两个额外的对比学习任务(即节点判别和边缘判别) ，为推荐过程中的两个组件提供自我监督信号。最后，通过五个基准数据集的大量实验证明了我们提出的 RGCL 相对于最先进的基准线的优越性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=A+Review-aware+Graph+Contrastive+Learning+Framework+for+Recommendation)|4|

Recently, PLMs-based Information Retrieval models have also been investigated and showed substantially state-of-the-art effectiveness, e.g., MORES, PROP and ColBERT. Moreover, most of the PLMs-based rankers only focus on a single level relevance matching (e.g., character-level), while ignore the other granularity information (e.g., words and phrases), which easily lead to the ambiguity of query understanding and inaccurate matching issues in web search. In this paper, we aim to improve the state-of-the-art PLMs ERNIE for web search, by modeling multi-granularity context information with the awareness of word importance in queries and documents. In particular, we propose a novel H-ERNIE framework, which includes a query-document analysis component and a hierarchical ranking component. The query-document analysis component has several individual modules which generate the necessary variables, such as word segmentation, word importance analysis, and word tightness analysis. Based on these variables, the importance-aware multiple-level correspondences are sent to the ranking model. The hierarchical ranking model includes a multi-layer transformer module to learn the character-level representations, a word-level matching module, and a phrase-level matching module with word importance. Each of these modules models the query and the document matching from a different perspective. Also, these levels are inherently communicated to achieve the overall accurate matching. We discuss the time complexity of the proposed framework, and show that it can be efficiently implemented in real applications. The offline and online experiments on both public data sets and a commercial search engine illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed H-ERNIE framework.|预训练语言模型(PLM) ，如 BERT 和 ERNIE，在许多自然语言理解任务中都取得了优异的成绩。最近，基于 PLM 的信息检索模型也得到了研究，并显示了最先进的有效性，例如 MORES、 PROP 和 ColBERT。此外，大多数基于 PLM 的排名只关注单一层次的相关性匹配(例如，字符层次) ，而忽略了其他粒度信息(例如，单词和短语) ，这很容易导致查询理解的模糊性和网络搜索中不准确的匹配问题。本文旨在通过建立多粒度上下文信息模型，并考虑查询和文档中词的重要性，来改进目前最先进的面向 Web 搜索的 PLM ERNIE。特别地，我们提出了一个新的 H-ERNIE 框架，它包括一个查询-文档分析组件和一个层次化排序组件。查询-文档分析组件包含几个单独的模块，这些模块生成必要的变量，如分词、词重要性分析和词紧密性分析。基于这些变量，重要性感知的多层次通信被发送到排序模型。该层次排序模型包括学习字符级表示的多层转换器模块、词级匹配模块和具有词重要性的短语级匹配模块。这些模块中的每一个都从不同的角度对查询和文档匹配进行建模。此外，这些级别是固有的沟通，以实现整体精确匹配。我们讨论了该框架的时间复杂度，并表明它可以在实际应用中得到有效的实现。对公共数据集和商业搜索引擎的离线和在线实验说明了所提出的 H-ERNIE 框架的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=H-ERNIE:+A+Multi-Granularity+Pre-Trained+Language+Model+for+Web+Search)|4|

Most existing approaches follow a three-step pipeline framework, including document retrieval, sentence retrieval and claim verification. High-quality evidences provided by the first two steps are the foundation of the effective reasoning in the last step. Despite being important, high-quality evidences are rarely studied by existing works for FV, which often adopt the off-the-shelf models to retrieve relevant documents and sentences in an "index-retrieve-then-rank'' fashion. This classical approach has clear drawbacks as follows: i) a large document index as well as a complicated search process is required, leading to considerable memory and computational overhead; ii) independent scoring paradigms fail to capture the interactions among documents and sentences in ranking; iii) a fixed number of sentences are selected to form the final evidence set. In this work, we proposeGERE, the first system that retrieves evidences in a generative fashion, i.e., generating the document titles as well as evidence sentence identifiers. This enables us to mitigate the aforementioned technical issues since: i) the memory and computational cost is greatly reduced because the document index is eliminated and the heavy ranking process is replaced by a light generative process; ii) the dependency between documents and that between sentences could be captured via sequential generation process; iii) the generative formulation allows us to dynamically select a precise set of relevant evidences for each claim. The experimental results on the FEVER dataset show that GERE achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art baselines, with both time-efficiency and memory-efficiency.|事实验证(FV)是一项具有挑战性的任务，其目的是利用可信语料库中的多个证据句来验证一个声明，例如维基百科。大多数现有的方法遵循三步流水线框架，包括文献检索、句子检索和索赔验证。前两步提供的高质量证据是最后一步有效推理的基础。尽管高质量的证据具有重要意义，但现有的 FV 研究很少对其进行研究，往往采用现成的模型，以“先索引后排名”的方式检索相关文档和句子。这种经典的方法有以下明显的缺点: i)需要大量的文档索引以及复杂的搜索过程，导致相当大的内存和计算开销; ii)独立的评分范例不能捕获排名中文档和句子之间的相互作用; iii)选择固定数量的句子来形成最终的证据集。在这项工作中，我们提出了 Gere，第一个以生成方式检索证据的系统，即生成文档标题以及证据句标识符。这使我们能够减轻上述技术问题，因为: i)内存和计算成本大大降低，因为文档索引被消除，重排序过程被轻生成过程取代; ii)文档之间的依赖性和句子之间的依赖性可以通过顺序生成过程捕获; iii)生成公式允许我们动态选择每个索赔的相关证据的精确集合。在 FEVER 数据集上的实验结果表明，在时间效率和内存效率方面，GARE 比最先进的基线有了显著的提高。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=GERE:+Generative+Evidence+Retrieval+for+Fact+Verification)|4|

While for decades confined to theoretical algorithmic papers, quantum computing is now becoming a viable tool to tackle realistic problems, in particular special-purpose solvers based on the Quantum Annealing paradigm.

The effectiveness obtained with quantum computing hardware is comparable to that of classical solvers, indicating that quantum computers are now reliable enough to tackle interesting problems.

|[Continual Learning Dialogue Systems - Learning during Conversation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3532677)|Sahisnu Mazumder, Bing Liu|Intel Labs, Santa Clara, CA, USA; University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA|Dialogue systems, commonly known as Chatbots, have gained escalating popularity in recent years due to their wide-spread applications in carrying out chit-chat conversations with users and accomplishing various tasks as personal assistants. However, they still have some major weaknesses. One key weakness is that they are typically trained from pre-collected and manually-labeled data and/or written with handcrafted rules. Their knowledge bases (KBs) are also fixed and pre-compiled by human experts. Due to the huge amount of manual effort involved, they are difficult to scale and also tend to produce many errors ought to their limited ability to understand natural language and the limited knowledge in their KBs. Thus, when these systems are deployed, the level of user satisfactory is often low. In this tutorial, we introduce and discuss methods to give chatbots the ability to continuously and interactively learn new knowledge during conversation, i.e. "on-the-job" by themselves so that as the systems chat more and more with users, they become more and more knowledgeable and improve their performance over time. The first half of the tutorial focuses on introducing the paradigm of lifelong and continual learning and discuss various related problems and challenges in conversational AI applications. In the second half, we present recent advancements on the topic, with a focus on continuous lexical and factual knowledge learning in dialogues, open-domain dialogue learning after deployment and learning of new language expressions via user interactions for language grounding applications (e.g. natural language interfaces).

It has become so widespread that we require algorithmic assistance utilising machine learning to detect such content. Training these machine learning models require datasets of sufficient scale, diversity and quality. However, datasets in the field of automatic misinformation detection are predominantly monolingual, include a limited amount of modalities and are not of sufficient scale and quality. Addressing this, we develop a data collection and linking system (MuMiN-trawl), to build a public misinformation graph dataset (MuMiN), containing rich social media data (tweets, replies, users, images, articles, hashtags) spanning 21 million tweets belonging to 26 thousand Twitter threads, each of which have been semantically linked to 13 thousand fact-checked claims across dozens of topics, events and domains, in 41 different languages, spanning more than a decade. The dataset is made available as a heterogeneous graph via a Python package (mumin). We provide baseline results for two node classification tasks related to the veracity of a claim involving social media, and demonstrate that these are challenging tasks, with the highest macro-average F1-score being 62.55% and 61.45% for the two tasks, respectively.

The current work is the first attempt, to the best of our knowledge, in investigating the role of sentiment, emotion and sarcasm in identifying cyberbullying from multi-modal memes in a code-mixed language setting. As a contribution, we have created a benchmark multi-modal meme dataset called MultiBully annotated with bully, sentiment, emotion and sarcasm labels collected from open-source Twitter and Reddit platforms. Moreover, the severity of the cyberbullying posts is also investigated by adding a harmfulness score to each of the memes. The created dataset consists of two modalities, text and image. Most of the texts in our dataset are in code-mixed form, which captures the seamless transitions between languages for multilingual users. Two different multimodal multitask frameworks (BERT+ResNET-Feedback and CLIP-CentralNet) have been proposed for cyberbullying detection (CD), the three auxiliary tasks being sentiment analysis (SA), emotion recognition (ER) and sarcasm detection (SAR).

|[MetaCVR: Conversion Rate Prediction via Meta Learning in Small-Scale Recommendation Scenarios](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531733)|Xiaofeng Pan, Ming Li, Jing Zhang, Keren Yu, Hong Wen, Luping Wang, Chengjun Mao, Bo Cao|The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, China; Alibaba Group, Hangzhou, China|Different from large-scale platforms such as Taobao and Amazon, CVR modeling in small-scale recommendation scenarios is more challenging due to the severe Data Distribution Fluctuation (DDF) issue. DDF prevents existing CVR models from being effective since 1) several months of data are needed to train CVR models sufficiently in small scenarios, leading to considerable distribution discrepancy between training and online serving; and 2) e-commerce promotions have significant impacts on small scenarios, leading to distribution uncertainty of the upcoming time period. In this work, we propose a novel CVR method named MetaCVR from a perspective of meta learning to address the DDF issue. Firstly, a base CVR model which consists of a Feature Representation Network (FRN) and output layers is designed and trained sufficiently with samples across months. Then we treat time periods with different data distributions as different occasions and obtain positive and negative prototypes for each occasion using the corresponding samples and the pre-trained FRN. Subsequently, a Distance Metric Network (DMN) is devised to calculate the distance metrics between each sample and all prototypes to facilitate mitigating the distribution uncertainty. At last, we develop an Ensemble Prediction Network (EPN) which incorporates the output of FRN and DMN to make the final CVR prediction. In this stage, we freeze the FRN and train the DMN and EPN with samples from recent time period, therefore effectively easing the distribution discrepancy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of CVR prediction targeting the DDF issue in small-scale recommendation scenarios. Experimental results on real-world datasets validate the superiority of our MetaCVR and online A/B test also shows our model achieves impressive gains of 11.92% on PCVR and 8.64% on GMV.|与淘宝和亚马逊等大型平台不同，由于数据分布波动(DDF)问题严重，小规模推荐场景下的 CVR 建模更具挑战性。DDF 阻止了现有的 CVR 模型的有效性，因为1)需要几个月的数据来充分训练 CVR 模型在小场景中，导致训练和在线服务之间的相当大的分布差异; 2)电子商务促销对小场景有重大影响，导致即将到来的时间段的分布不确定性。本文从元学习的角度出发，提出了一种新的 CVR 方法 MetaCVR 来解决 DDF 问题。首先，设计了一个由特征表示网络(FRN)和输出层组成的基本 CVR 模型，并对该模型进行了数月的样本训练。然后将不同时间段的数据分布视为不同的场合，利用相应的样本和预先训练好的 FRN，得到每个场合的正负原型。随后，设计了一个距离度量网络(DMN)来计算每个样本和所有原型之间的距离度量，以减少分布的不确定性。最后，我们开发了一个集成预测网络(EPN) ，将 FRN 和 DMN 的输出结合起来进行 CVR 的最终预测。在这一阶段，我们冻结 FRN，并用最近时间段的样本训练 DMN 和 EPN，从而有效地缓解了分布差异。据我们所知，这是第一个针对小规模推荐场景中 DDF 问题的 CVR 预测研究。在实际数据集上的实验结果验证了我们的 MetaCVR 模型的优越性，在线 A/B 测试也表明我们的模型在 PCVR 和 GMV 上分别取得了令人印象深刻的11.92% 和8.64% 的增益。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=MetaCVR:+Conversion+Rate+Prediction+via+Meta+Learning+in+Small-Scale+Recommendation+Scenarios)|3|

Using user clicks as ranking features, on the other hand, has not been fully explored in existing literature. Despite its potential in improving short-term system performance, whether the incorporation of user clicks as ranking features is beneficial for learning-to-rank systems in the long term is still questionable. Two of the most important problems are (1) the explicit bias introduced by noisy user behavior, and (2) the implicit bias, which we refer to as the exploitation bias, introduced by the dynamic training and serving of learning-to-rank systems with behavior features. In this paper, we explore the possibility of incorporating user clicks as both training labels and ranking features for learning to rank. We formally investigate the problems in feature collection and model training, and propose a counterfactual feature projection function and a novel uncertainty-aware learning to rank framework. Experiments on public datasets show that ranking models learned with the proposed framework can significantly outperform models built with raw click features and algorithms that rank items without considering model uncertainty.|使用从用户点击收集的隐式反馈作为学习到排序算法的训练标签是一个发展良好的范例，已经在现代 IR 系统中得到了广泛的研究和应用。使用用户点击作为排名功能，另一方面，还没有充分探讨现有的文献。尽管它在提高短期系统性能方面具有潜力，但是从长远来看，将用户点击作为排名功能的结合是否有利于学习排名系统仍然值得怀疑。其中最重要的两个问题是: (1)噪声用户行为引入的显性偏差和(2)具有行为特征的学习排序系统的动态训练和服务引入的隐性偏差，我们称之为剥削偏差。在这篇文章中，我们探讨了将用户点击作为训练标签和排名特征来学习排名的可能性。我们正式研究了特征收集和模型训练中的问题，提出了一种反事实特征投影函数和一种新的不确定性学习排序框架。对公共数据集的实验表明，使用所提出的框架学习的排序模型可以显著优于使用原始点击特征和算法建立的模型，这些模型不考虑模型的不确定性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Can+Clicks+Be+Both+Labels+and+Features?:+Unbiased+Behavior+Feature+Collection+and+Uncertainty-aware+Learning+to+Rank)|3|

However, most conventional CRS models mainly focus on the dialogue understanding of the current session, ignoring other rich multi-aspect information of the central subjects (i.e., users) in recommendation. In this work, we highlight that the user's historical dialogue sessions and look-alike users are essential sources of user preferences besides the current dialogue session in CRS. To systematically model the multi-aspect information, we propose a User-Centric Conversational Recommendation (UCCR) model, which returns to the essence of user preference learning in CRS tasks. Specifically, we propose a historical session learner to capture users' multi-view preferences from knowledge, semantic, and consuming views as supplements to the current preference signals. A multi-view preference mapper is conducted to learn the intrinsic correlations among different views in current and historical sessions via self-supervised objectives. We also design a temporal look-alike user selector to understand users via their similar users. The learned multi-aspect multi-view user preferences are then used for the recommendation and dialogue generation. In experiments, we conduct comprehensive evaluations on both Chinese and English CRS datasets. The significant improvements over competitive models in both recommendation and dialogue generation verify the superiority of UCCR.|会话推荐系统(CRS)旨在提供高质量的会话推荐。然而，大多数传统的 CRS 模型主要侧重于对当前会话的对话理解，而忽略了推荐中心主体(即用户)的其他丰富的多方面信息。在这项工作中，我们强调用户的历史对话会话和外观相似的用户是用户偏好的重要来源，除了当前的对话会话在 CRS。为了系统地建立多方面信息的模型，本文提出了一种以用户为中心的会话推荐(UCCR)模型，该模型回归了 CRS 任务中用户偏好学习的本质。具体来说，我们提出了一个历史会话学习者来捕捉用户的多视图偏好，从知识，语义和消费观点作为补充的当前偏好信号。通过自监督目标，提出了一种多视点偏好映射算法，用于研究当前会议和历史会议中不同视点之间的内在相关性。我们还设计了一个时间外观相似的用户选择器，通过相似的用户来理解用户。然后利用所学习的多方面多视图用户偏好进行推荐和对话生成。在实验中，我们对中英文 CRS 数据集进行了综合评价。在推荐和对话生成方面对竞争模式的重大改进证明了 UCCR 的优越性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=User-Centric+Conversational+Recommendation+with+Multi-Aspect+User+Modeling)|3|
|[When Multi-Level Meets Multi-Interest: A Multi-Grained Neural Model for Sequential Recommendation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3532081)|Yu Tian, Jianxin Chang, Yanan Niu, Yang Song, Chenliang Li|Kuaishou.com, Beijing, China; Wuhan University, Wuhan, China|Sequential recommendation aims at identifying the next item that is preferred by a user based on their behavioral history. Compared to conventional sequential models that leverage attention mechanisms and RNNs, recent efforts mainly follow two directions for improvement: multi-interest learning and graph convolutional aggregation. Specifically, multi-interest methods such as ComiRec and MIMN, focus on extracting different interests for a user by performing historical item clustering, while graph convolution methods including TGSRec and SURGE elect to refine user preferences based on multilevel correlations between historical items. Unfortunately, neither of them realizes that these two types of solutions can mutually complement each other, by aggregating multi-level user preference to achieve more precise multi-interest extraction for a better recommendation. To this end, in this paper, we propose a unified multi-grained neural model (named MGNM) via a combination of multi-interest learning and graph convolutional aggregation. Concretely, MGNM first learns the graph structure and information aggregation paths of the historical items for a user. It then performs graph convolution to derive item representations in an iterative fashion, in which the complex preferences at different levels can be well captured. Afterwards, a novel sequential capsule network is proposed to inject the sequential patterns into the multi-interest extraction process, leading to a more precise interest learning in a multi-grained manner. Experiments on three real-world datasets from different scenarios demonstrate the superiority of MGNM against several state-of-the-art baselines. The performance gain over the best baseline is up to 27.10% and 25.17% in terms of [email protected] and [email protected] respectively, which is one of the largest gains in recent development of sequential recommendation. Further analysis also demonstrates that MGNM is robust and effective at user preference understanding at multi-grained levels.|顺序推荐的目的是根据用户的行为历史来确定他们喜欢的下一个项目。与利用注意机制和 RNN 的传统序列模型相比，最近的努力主要遵循两个改进方向: 多兴趣学习和图卷积聚合。具体来说，ComiRec 和 MIMN 等多兴趣方法侧重于通过对历史项目进行聚类来为用户提取不同的兴趣，而 TGSRec 和 SurGE 等图形卷积方法则选择基于历史项目之间的多级相关性来改进用户偏好。不幸的是，他们都没有意识到这两种解决方案可以相互补充，通过聚合多级用户偏好来实现更精确的多兴趣提取以获得更好的推荐。为此，本文将多兴趣学习和图卷积聚合相结合，提出了一种统一的多粒度神经网络模型(MGNM)。具体来说，MGNM 首先为用户学习历史项的图形结构和信息聚合路径。然后，它执行图形卷积，以迭代的方式派生项表示，在这种方式中，可以很好地捕获不同级别的复杂首选项。然后，提出了一种新的序列胶囊网络，将序列模式引入到多兴趣提取过程中，从而实现多粒度的兴趣学习。通过对来自不同场景的三个真实世界数据集的实验，证明了 MGNM 算法对几个最新基线的优越性。就[ email protected ]和[ email protected ]而言，超过最佳基线的性能提升分别高达27.10% 和25.17% ，这是最近顺序推荐发展中最大的提升之一。进一步的分析还表明，MGNM 在多粒度级别上对用户偏好的理解是健壮的和有效的。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=When+Multi-Level+Meets+Multi-Interest:+A+Multi-Grained+Neural+Model+for+Sequential+Recommendation)|3|

Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown superior performance in various applications. Inspired by the success of GNNs, tremendous endeavors have been devoted to introduce GNNs into session-based recommendation and have achieved significant results. Nevertheless, due to the highly diverse types of potential information in sessions, existing GNNs-based methods perform differently on different session datasets, leading to the need for efficient design of neural networks adapted to various session recommendation scenarios. To address this problem, we propose Automated neural architecture search for Graph-based Session Recommendation, namely AutoGSR, a framework that provides a practical and general solution to automatically find the optimal GNNs-based session recommendation model. In AutoGSR, we propose two novel GNN operations to build an expressive and compact search space. Building upon the search space, we employ a differentiable search algorithm to search for the optimal graph neural architecture. Furthermore, to consider all types of session information together, we propose to learn the item meta knowledge, which acts as a priori knowledge for guiding the optimization of final session representations. Comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that AutoGSR is able to find effective neural architectures and achieve state-of-the-art results.

|[How Does Feedback Signal Quality Impact Effectiveness of Pseudo Relevance Feedback for Passage Retrieval](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531822)|Hang Li, Ahmed Mourad, Bevan Koopman, Guido Zuccon|The University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia; CSIRO, Brisbane, QLD, Australia|Pseudo-Relevance Feedback (PRF) assumes that the top results retrieved by a first-stage ranker are relevant to the original query and uses them to improve the query representation for a second round of retrieval. This assumption however is often not correct: some or even all of the feedback documents may be irrelevant. Indeed, the effectiveness of PRF methods may well depend on the quality of the feedback signal and thus on the effectiveness of the first-stage ranker. This aspect however has received little attention before. In this paper we control the quality of the feedback signal and measure its impact on a range of PRF methods, including traditional bag-of-words methods (Rocchio), and dense vector-based methods (learnt and not learnt). Our results show the important role the quality of the feedback signal plays on the effectiveness of PRF methods. Importantly, and surprisingly, our analysis reveals that not all PRF methods are the same when dealing with feedback signals of varying quality. These findings are critical to gain a better understanding of the PRF methods and of which and when they should be used, depending on the feedback signal quality, and set the basis for future research in this area.|伪相关反馈(PRF)假设第一阶段排序器检索到的最高结果与原始查询相关，并利用这些结果改善查询表示以进行第二轮检索。然而，这种假设往往是不正确的: 一些甚至所有的反馈文档可能是不相关的。事实上，PRF 方法的有效性很大程度上取决于反馈信号的质量，因此也取决于第一阶段排序器的有效性。然而，这方面以前很少受到关注。在本文中，我们控制反馈信号的质量，并测量其对一系列 PRF 方法的影响，包括传统的词袋方法(Rocchio)和基于密集向量的方法(学习和不学习)。结果表明，反馈信号的质量对 PRF 方法的有效性起着重要作用。重要的是，令人惊讶的是，我们的分析表明，并非所有的 PRF 方法是相同的，当处理不同质量的反馈信号。这些发现对于更好地理解 PRF 方法以及根据反馈信号的质量，什么时候应该使用这些方法是至关重要的，并且为这一领域的未来研究奠定了基础。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=How+Does+Feedback+Signal+Quality+Impact+Effectiveness+of+Pseudo+Relevance+Feedback+for+Passage+Retrieval)|3|

This two-tower architecture introduces inductive biases to allow more efficient use of limited observational logs and better generalization during deployment than single-tower architecture that may learn spurious correlations between relevance predictions and biases. However, despite their popularity, it is largely neglected in the literature that existing two-tower models assume that the joint distribution of relevance prediction and observation probabilities are completely factorizable. In this work, we revisit two-tower models for ULTR. We rigorously show that the factorization assumption can be too strong for real-world user behaviors, and existing methods may easily fail under slightly milder assumptions. We then propose several novel ideas that consider a wider spectrum of user behaviors while still under the two-tower framework to maintain simplicity and generalizability. Our concerns of existing two-tower models and the effectiveness of our proposed methods are validated on both controlled synthetic and large-scale real-world datasets.|双塔架构通常用于现实世界的无偏学习排名(ULTR)系统，其中一个深度神经网络(DNN)塔模型无偏相关性预测，而另一个塔模型观察偏差固有的训练数据，如用户点击。与单塔架构相比，这种双塔架构引入了归纳偏差，以便更有效地使用有限的观测日志，并在部署期间更好地进行概括，而单塔架构可以学习相关性预测和偏差之间的伪相关性。然而，尽管现有的双塔模型很流行，但它们大多被忽视了，现有的双塔模型假定相关预测和观测概率的联合分布是完全可分解的。在这项工作中，我们重新讨论了 ULTR 的双塔模型。我们严格地证明了因子分解假设对于真实世界的用户行为来说可能过于强烈，并且在稍微温和的假设下，现有的方法可能很容易失败。然后，我们提出了几个新的想法，考虑更广泛的用户行为，同时仍然在双塔框架下，以保持简单性和普遍性。我们对现有的双塔模型的关注和我们提出的方法的有效性是在受控的合成和大规模的真实世界数据集上得到验证。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Revisiting+Two-tower+Models+for+Unbiased+Learning+to+Rank)|3|

In the present work, we expand this direction of research by considering bias mitigation within a framework for contextual document embedding reranking. In this framework, the transformer-based query encoder is optimized for relevance ranking through a list-wise objective, by jointly scoring for the same query a large set of candidate document embeddings in the context of one another, instead of in isolation. At the same time, we impose a regularization loss which penalizes highly scoring documents that deviate from neutrality with respect to a protected attribute (e.g., gender). Our approach for bias mitigation is end-to-end differentiable and efficient. Compared to the existing alternatives for deep neural retrieval architectures, which are based on adversarial training, we demonstrate that it can attain much stronger bias mitigation/fairness. At the same time, for the same amount of bias mitigation, it offers significantly better relevance performance (utility). Crucially, our method allows for a more finely controllable and predictable intensity of bias mitigation, which is essential for practical deployment in production systems.|社会偏见可以影响信息检索系统的结果，相反，搜索结果可能会加强现有的社会偏见。因此，最近的研究侧重于开发用于量化和减轻搜索结果偏差的方法，并将其应用于利用基于转换器的语言模型的当代检索系统。在本文的工作中，我们扩展了这个研究方向，在上下文文档嵌入重排序的框架内考虑了偏差缓解。在这个框架中，基于转换器的查询编码器通过列表目标优化相关性排序，为同一个查询联合评分一大组候选文档嵌入在另一个上下文中，而不是孤立。与此同时，我们强制规范化的损失，惩罚高得分的文件偏离中立方面的保护属性(例如，性别)。我们的减少偏差的方法是端到端可微和有效的。与已有的基于对抗训练的深度神经检索结构相比，我们证明了该结构可以获得更强的偏差缓解/公平性。同时，对于相同数量的偏差缓解，它提供了明显更好的相关性能(效用)。至关重要的是，我们的方法允许更精细地控制和可预测的偏差缓解强度，这对于生产系统中的实际部署是必不可少的。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Mitigating+Bias+in+Search+Results+Through+Contextual+Document+Reranking+and+Neutrality+Regularization)|3|

Most state-of-the-art methods build on self-attention networks and focus on exploring various solutions to integrate the item embedding and side information embeddings before the attention layer. However, our analysis shows that the early integration of various types of embeddings limits the expressiveness of attention matrices due to a rank bottleneck and constrains the flexibility of gradients. Also, it involves mixed correlations among the different heterogeneous information resources, which brings extra disturbance to attention calculation. Motivated by this, we propose Decoupled Side Information Fusion for Sequential Recommendation (DIF-SR), which moves the side information from the input to the attention layer and decouples the attention calculation of various side information and item representation. We theoretically and empirically show that the proposed solution allows higher-rank attention matrices and flexible gradients to enhance the modeling capacity of side information fusion. Also, auxiliary attribute predictors are proposed to further activate the beneficial interaction between side information and item representation learning. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed solution stably outperforms state-of-the-art SR models. Further studies show that our proposed solution can be readily incorporated into current attention-based SR models and significantly boost performance.

|[Is News Recommendation a Sequential Recommendation Task?](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531862)|Chuhan Wu, Fangzhao Wu, Tao Qi, Chenliang Li, Yongfeng Huang|Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China; York University, Toronto, Canada; Renmin University of China, Beijing, China|For sequential recommendation, it is essential to capture and predict future or long-term user preference for generating accurate recommendation over time. To improve the predictive capacity, we adopt reinforcement learning (RL) for developing effective sequential recommenders. However, user-item interaction data is likely to be sparse, complicated and time-varying. It is not easy to directly apply RL techniques to improve the performance of sequential recommendation.

Inspired by the availability of knowledge graph (KG), we propose a novel Knowledge-guidEd Reinforcement Learning model (KERL for short) for fusing KG information into a RL framework for sequential recommendation. Specifically, we formalize the sequential recommendation task as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and make three major technical extensions in this framework, including state representation, reward function and learning algorithm. First, we propose to enhance the state representations with KG information considering both exploitation and exploration. Second, we carefully design a composite reward function that is able to compute both sequence- and knowledge-level rewards. Third, we propose a new algorithm for more effectively learning the proposed model. To our knowledge, it is the first time that knowledge information has been explicitly discussed and utilized in RL-based sequential recommenders, especially for the exploration process. Extensive experiment results on both next-item and next-session recommendation tasks show that our model can significantly outperform the baselines on four real-world datasets.|对于连续推荐，必须捕获和预测未来或长期的用户偏好，以便随着时间的推移产生准确的推荐。为了提高预测能力，我们采用强化学习(RL)来开发有效的顺序推荐系统。然而，用户项交互数据可能是稀疏的、复杂的和时变的。直接应用 RL 技术来提高顺序推荐的性能并不容易。受到知识图表(kG)的启发，我们提出了一种新的知识引导强化学习模型(简称 KERL) ，用于将 kG 信息融合到一个 RL 框架中，用于连续推荐。具体来说，我们将顺序推荐任务形式化为一个马可夫决策过程(mDP) ，并在这个框架中进行了三个主要的技术扩展，包括状态表示、奖励函数和学习算法。首先，我们提出了利用 KG 信息同时考虑开发和探索的方法来增强状态表示。其次，我们仔细设计了一个复合奖励函数，它能够计算序列和知识水平的奖励。第三，我们提出了一个新的算法，以更有效地学习所提出的模型。据我们所知，知识信息首次被明确地讨论和利用在基于 RL 的顺序推荐系统中，特别是在探索过程中。对下一个项目和下一个会话推荐任务的大量实验结果表明，我们的模型可以显著优于四个真实世界数据集的基线。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Is+News+Recommendation+a+Sequential+Recommendation+Task?)|3|

However, sequential recommendation suffers data sparsity issue like most recommenders. To extract auxiliary signals from the data, some recent works exploit self-supervised learning to generate augmented data via dropout strategy, which, however, leads to sparser sequential data and obscure signals. In this paper, we propose D ual C ontrastive N etwork (DCN) to boost sequential recommendation, from a new perspective of integrating auxiliary user-sequence for items. Specifically, we propose two kinds of contrastive learning. The first one is the dual representation contrastive learning that minimizes the distances between embeddings and sequence-representations of users/items. The second one is the dual interest contrastive learning which aims to self-supervise the static interest with the dynamic interest of next item prediction via auxiliary training. We also incorporate the auxiliary task of predicting next user for a given item's historical user sequence, which can capture the trends of items preferred by certain types of users.

|[Co-training Disentangled Domain Adaptation Network for Leveraging Popularity Bias in Recommenders](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531952)|Zhihong Chen, Jiawei Wu, Chenliang Li, Jingxu Chen, Rong Xiao, Binqiang Zhao|Alibaba Group, Hangzhou, China; Wuhan University, Wuhan, China|Recommender system usually faces popularity bias. From the popularity distribution shift perspective, the normal paradigm trained on exposed items (most are hot items) identifies that recommending popular items more frequently can achieve lower loss, thus injecting popularity information into item property embedding, e.g., id embedding. From the long-tail distribution shift perspective, the sparse interactions of long-tail items lead to insufficient learning of them. The resultant distribution discrepancy between hot and long-tail items would not only inherit the bias, but also amplify the bias. Existing work addresses this issue with inverse propensity scoring (IPS) or causal embeddings. However, we argue that not all popularity biases mean bad effects, i.e., some items show higher popularity due to better quality or conform to current trends, which deserve more recommendations. Blindly seeking unbiased learning may inhibit high-quality or fashionable items. To make better use of the popularity bias, we propose a co-training disentangled domain adaptation network (CD$^2$AN), which can co-train both biased and unbiased models. Specifically, for popularity distribution shift, CD$^2$AN disentangles item property representation and popularity representation from item property embedding. For long-tail distribution shift, we introduce additional unexposed items (most are long-tail items) to align the distribution of hot and long-tail item property representations. Further, from the instances perspective, we carefully design the item similarity regularization to learn comprehensive item representation, which encourages item pairs with more effective co-occurrences patterns to have more similar item property representations. Based on offline evaluations and online A/B tests, we show that CD$^2$AN outperforms the existing debiased solutions. Currently, CD$^2$AN has been successfully deployed at Mobile Taobao App and handling major online traffic.|推荐系统通常面临受欢迎程度的偏见。从受欢迎度分布转移的角度来看，通常对曝光项目(大多数是热门项目)进行训练的范式认为，更频繁地推荐受欢迎项目可以获得更低的损失，从而将受欢迎信息注入项目属性嵌入，例如，ID 嵌入。从长尾分布偏移的角度来看，长尾项目之间稀疏的交互作用导致对它们的学习不足。由此产生的热点项目与长尾项目之间的分布差异不仅会继承偏差，而且会放大偏差。现有的工作解决这个问题的逆倾向评分(IPS)或因果嵌入。然而，我们认为并非所有的流行偏见都意味着负面影响，例如，一些项目由于质量更好或符合当前趋势而显示出更高的流行度，这值得更多的推荐。盲目追求无偏见的学习可能会抑制高质量或时尚的项目。为了更好地利用流行度偏差，我们提出了一种协同训练的去纠缠域自适应网络(CD $^ 2 $AN) ，它可以同时训练有偏和无偏模型。具体地说，对于流行度分布转移，CD $^ 2 $AN 将项目属性表示和流行度表示从项目属性嵌入中分离出来。对于长尾分布转移，我们引入了额外的未公开项(大多数是长尾项)来对齐热点和长尾项属性表示的分布。此外，从实例的角度，我们仔细设计了项目相似性正则化，以学习综合项目表示，鼓励具有更有效的共现模式的项目对具有更多相似的项目属性表示。基于离线评估和在线 A/B 测试，我们表明 CD $^ 2 $AN 优于现有的去偏解决方案。目前，CD $^ 2 $AN 已经成功部署在移动淘宝应用程序上，并处理主要的在线流量。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Co-training+Disentangled+Domain+Adaptation+Network+for+Leveraging+Popularity+Bias+in+Recommenders)|3|

Despite the improvement achieved in the existing work, three issues are yet to be solved. First, users' historical behaviors contain rich preference information, such as users' long and short-term interests, but are not fully exploited in reranking. Previous work typically treats items in history equally important, neglecting the dynamic interaction between the history and candidate items. Second, existing reranking models focus on learning interactions at the item level while ignoring the fine-grained feature-level interactions. Lastly, estimating the reranking score on the ordered initial list before reranking may lead to the early scoring problem, thereby yielding suboptimal reranking performance. To address the above issues, we propose a framework named Multi-level Interaction Reranking (MIR). MIR combines low-level cross-item interaction and high-level set-to-list interaction, where we view the candidate items to be reranked as a set and the users' behavior history in chronological order as a list. We design a novel SLAttention structure for modeling the set-to-list interactions with personalized long-short term interests. Moreover, feature-level interactions are incorporated to capture the fine-grained influence among items. We design MIR in such a way that any permutation of the input items would not change the output ranking, and we theoretically prove it. Extensive experiments on three public and proprietary datasets show that MIR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models using various ranking and utility metrics.|作为多阶段推荐系统(MRS)的最后阶段，重新排名直接影响用户的体验和满意度，因此在 MRS 中发挥着关键作用。尽管现有工作已有所改善，但仍有三个问题有待解决。首先，用户的历史行为包含了丰富的偏好信息，如用户的长期和短期兴趣，但在重新排序时没有得到充分的利用。以往的研究通常认为历史条目同等重要，而忽视了历史条目与候选条目之间的动态互动。其次，现有的重新排序模型侧重于项目层面的学习交互，而忽略了细粒度的特征层面的交互。最后，在重新排序之前估计排序初始列表上的重新排序得分可能会导致早期得分问题，从而产生次优的重新排序性能。为了解决上述问题，我们提出了一个名为多级交互重排(MIR)的框架。MIR 结合了低层次的跨项目交互和高层次的集合-列表交互，我们将待重新排序的候选项作为一个集合，将用户的行为历史按照时间顺序作为一个列表。我们设计了一个新颖的空间注意结构，用于建模具有个性化长期短期兴趣的集合列表交互。此外，特征层次的交互作用被合并来捕获项目之间的细粒度影响。我们设计 MIR 的方法使得输入项的任何排列都不会改变输出的排名，并且我们从理论上证明了这一点。对三个公共和专有数据集的大量实验表明，使用各种排名和效用指标，MIR 显著优于最先进的模型。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Multi-Level+Interaction+Reranking+with+User+Behavior+History)|3|

Despite the popularity in practice, the literature specific on multi-stage cascade ranking systems is relatively scarce. The common practice is to train rankers of each stage independently using the same user feedback data (a.k.a., impression data), disregarding the data flow and the possible interactions between stages. This straightforward solution could lead to a sub-optimal system because of the sample selection bias (SSB) issue, which is especially damaging for cascade rankers due to the negative effect accumulated in the multiple stages. Worse still, the interactions between the rankers of each stage are not fully exploited. This paper provides an elaborate analysis of this commonly used solution to reveal its limitations. By studying the essence of cascade ranking, we propose a joint training framework named RankFlow to alleviate the SSB issue and exploit the interactions between the cascade rankers, which is the first systematic solution for this topic. We propose a paradigm of training cascade rankers that emphasizes the importance of fitting rankers on stage-specific data distributions instead of the unified user feedback distribution. We design the RankFlow framework based on this paradigm: The training data of each stage is generated by its preceding stages while the guidance signals not only come from the logs but its successors. Extensive experiments are conducted on various IR scenarios, including recommendation, web search and advertisement. The results verify the efficacy and superiority of RankFlow.|建立一个多阶段的级联排名系统是现代信息检索应用(如推荐和网络搜索)中一个常用的平衡效率和有效性的解决方案。尽管在实践中很流行，但是关于多级级联排序系统的文献相对较少。通常的做法是使用相同的用户反馈数据(也就是印象数据)独立训练每个阶段的排名，忽略数据流和阶段之间可能的交互作用。由于样本选择偏差(SSB)问题，这种直接的解决方案可能会导致系统的次优化，而由于多阶段累积的负面效应，SSB 问题对级联排序尤其有害。更糟糕的是，每个阶段的排名之间的相互作用没有得到充分利用。本文对这种常用的解决方案进行了详细的分析，以揭示其局限性。通过研究级联排序的本质，提出了一种联合训练框架 RankFlow 来缓解 SSB 问题，并利用级联排序器之间的相互作用，这是本课题的第一个系统解决方案。我们提出了一个训练级联排名的范式，强调拟合排名的重要性阶段特定的数据分布，而不是统一的用户反馈分布。在此基础上，我们设计了 RankFlow 框架: 每个阶段的训练数据由前一阶段生成，而制导信号不仅来自日志，还来自后一阶段。在不同的信息检索场景中进行了广泛的实验，包括推荐、网络搜索和广告。结果验证了 RankFlow 的有效性和优越性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=RankFlow:+Joint+Optimization+of+Multi-Stage+Cascade+Ranking+Systems+as+Flows)|3|

They also offer an opportunity to provide community support to suicidal users. Recent studies on suicide risk assessment have explored the user's historic timeline and information from their social network to analyze their emotional state. However, such methods often require a large amount of user-centric data. A less intrusive alternative is to only use conversation trees arising from online community responses. Modeling such online conversations between the community and a person in distress is an important context for understanding that person's mental state. However, it is not trivial to model the vast number of conversation trees on social media, since each comment has a diverse influence on a user in distress. Typically, a handful of comments/posts receive a significantly high number of replies, which results in scale-free dynamics in the conversation tree. Moreover, psychological studies suggested that it is important to capture the fine-grained temporal irregularities in the release of vast volumes of comments, since suicidal users react quickly to online community support. Building on these limitations and psychological studies, we propose HCN, a Hyperbolic Conversation Network, which is a less user-intrusive method for suicide ideation detection. HCN leverages the hyperbolic space to represent the scale-free dynamics of online conversations. Through extensive quantitative, qualitative, and ablative experiments on real-world Twitter data, we find that HCN outperforms state-of-the art methods, while using 98% less user-specific data, and while maintaining a 74% lower carbon footprint and a 94% smaller model size.

Despite being well adapted to social relations and user-item interactions, these supervised models are still susceptible to popularity bias. Contrastive learning helps resolve this dilemma by identifying the properties that distinguish positive from negative samples. In its previous combinations with recommender systems, social relationships and cold-start cases in this context are not considered. Also, they primarily focus on collaborative features between users and items, leaving the similarity between items under-utilized. In this work, we propose socially-aware dual contrastive learning for cold-start recommendation, where cold users can be modeled in the same way as warm users. To take full advantage of social relations, we create dynamic node embeddings for each user by aggregating information from different neighbors according to each different query item, in the form of user-item pairs. We further design a dual-branch self-supervised contrastive objective to account for user-item collaborative features and item-item mutual information, respectively. On one hand, our framework eliminates popularity bias with proper negative sampling in contrastive learning, without extra ground-truth supervision. On the other hand, we extend previous contrastive learning methods to provide a solution to cold-start problem with social relations included.

By taking the user-item interaction behavior as a graph, these graph-based CF models borrow the success of Graph Neural Networks (GNN), and iteratively perform neighborhood aggregation to propagate the collaborative signals. While conventional CF models are known for facing the challenges of the popularity bias that favors popular items, one may wonder "Whether the existing graph-based CF models alleviate or exacerbate the popularity bias of recommender systems?" To answer this question, we first investigate the two-fold performances w.r.t. accuracy and novelty for existing graph-based CF methods. The empirical results show that symmetric neighborhood aggregation adopted by most existing graph-based CF models exacerbates the popularity bias and this phenomenon becomes more serious as the depth of graph propagation increases. Further, we theoretically analyze the cause of popularity bias for graph-based CF. Then, we propose a simple yet effective plugin, namely r-AdjNorm, to achieve an accuracy-novelty trade-off by controlling the normalization strength in the neighborhood aggregation process. Meanwhile, r-AdjNorm can be smoothly applied to the existing graph-based CF backbones without additional computation. Finally, experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that our proposed method can improve novelty without sacrificing accuracy under various graph-based CF backbones.|近年来，基于图形的协同过滤(CF)模型在推荐系统中的准确性表现非常出色。这些基于图的协同过程模型借鉴了图神经网络(GNN)的成功之处，以用户项交互行为为图形，迭代地进行邻域聚合来传播协同信号。虽然传统的 CF 模型面临着流行偏好的挑战，有人可能会问: “现有的基于图表的 CF 模型是否减轻或加剧了推荐系统的流行偏好?”为了回答这个问题，我们首先研究了现有的基于图的 CF 方法的双重性能。实验结果表明，现有的基于图的 CF 模型所采用的对称邻域聚集加剧了流行偏差，并且随着图的传播深度的增加，这种现象变得更加严重。进一步从理论上分析了基于图的流行度偏差产生的原因，提出了一种简单有效的插件 r-AdjNorm，通过控制邻域聚合过程中的归一化强度来实现精度-新颖性的权衡。同时，r-AdjNorm 可以顺利地应用于现有的基于图的 CF 骨干，而不需要额外的计算。最后，在三个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，在不同的基于图的 CF 骨架下，本文提出的方法可以在不牺牲精度的前提下提高新颖性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Investigating+Accuracy-Novelty+Performance+for+Graph-based+Collaborative+Filtering)|3|
|[Learning to Denoise Unreliable Interactions for Graph Collaborative Filtering](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531889)|Changxin Tian, Yuexiang Xie, Yaliang Li, Nan Yang, Wayne Xin Zhao|Alibaba Group, Bellevue, WA, USA; Renmin University of China, Beijing, China; Alibaba Group, Hangzhou, China|Recently, graph neural networks (GNN) have been successfully applied to recommender systems as an effective collaborative filtering (CF) approach. However, existing GNN-based CF models suffer from noisy user-item interaction data, which seriously affects the effectiveness and robustness in real-world applications. Although there have been several studies on data denoising in recommender systems, they either neglect direct intervention of noisy interaction in the message-propagation of GNN, or fail to preserve the diversity of recommendation when denoising. To tackle the above issues, this paper presents a novel GNN-based CF model, named Robust Graph Collaborative Filtering (RGCF), to denoise unreliable interactions for recommendation. Specifically, RGCF consists of a graph denoising module and a diversity preserving module. The graph denoising module is designed for reducing the impact of noisy interactions on the representation learning of GNN, by adopting both a hard denoising strategy (i.e., discarding interactions that are confidently estimated as noise) and a soft denoising strategy (i.e., assigning reliability weights for each remaining interaction). In the diversity preserving module, we build up a diversity augmented graph and propose an auxiliary self-supervised task based on mutual information maximization (MIM) for enhancing the denoised representation and preserving the diversity of recommendation. These two modules are integrated in a multi-task learning manner that jointly improves the recommendation performance. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets and three synthesized datasets. Experiment results show that RGCF is more robust against noisy interactions and achieves significant improvement compared with baseline models.|最近，图形神经网络(GNN)已成功应用于推荐系统，作为一种有效的协同过滤(CF)方法。然而，现有的基于 GNN 的 CF 模型存在着用户项交互数据的噪声，严重影响了实际应用的有效性和鲁棒性。对于推荐系统中的数据去噪问题，目前已经有了一些研究，但是这些研究要么忽略了噪声交互对 GNN 信息传播的直接干预，要么在去噪时未能保持推荐信息的多样性。为了解决上述问题，本文提出了一种新的基于 GNN 的 CF 模型，称为鲁棒图协同过滤(rgCF) ，用于去除不可靠的推荐交互。具体来说，RGCF 由图的去噪模块和多样性保持模块组成。图形去噪模块是为了减少噪声交互对 GNN 表示学习的影响而设计的，它采用了硬去噪策略(即放弃可信地估计为噪声的交互)和软去噪策略(即为每个剩余交互指定可靠性权重)。在多样性保持模块中，我们建立了一个多样性增强图，并提出了一个基于互信息最大化(MIM)的辅助自监督任务，以提高去噪表示和保持推荐的多样性。这两个模块以多任务学习方式集成，共同提高了推荐性能。我们在三个真实数据集和三个合成数据集上进行了广泛的实验。实验结果表明，与基线模型相比，RGCF 对噪声干扰具有更强的鲁棒性，并取得了显著的改善。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Learning+to+Denoise+Unreliable+Interactions+for+Graph+Collaborative+Filtering)|3|

Through keyword search, a software developer could select a set of APIs from a massive number of candidates to implement the functions of a complex mashup, which reduces the development cost significantly. However, traditional keyword search methods for APIs often suffer from several critical issues such as functional compatibility and limited diversity in search results, which may lead to mashup creation failures and lower development productivity. To deal with these challenges, this paper designs DAWAR, a diversity-aware Web APIs recommendation approach that finds diversified and compatible APIs for mashup creation. Specifically, the APIs recommendation problem for mashup creating is modelled as a graph search problem that aims to find the minimal group Steiner trees in a correlation graph of APIs. DAWAR innovatively employs the determinantal point processes to diversify the recommended results. Empirical evaluation is performed on commonly-used real-world datasets, and the statistic results show that DAWAR is able to achieve significant improvements in terms of recommendation diversity, accuracy, and compatibility.|随着微服务体系结构的日益普及，相当数量的企业或组织已经将其复杂的业务服务封装成各种轻量级功能，并将其发布为可访问的 API (应用程序编程接口)。通过关键字搜索，软件开发人员可以从大量候选 API 中选择一组 API 来实现复杂 mashup 的功能，这大大降低了开发成本。然而，用于 API 的传统关键字搜索方法经常遇到一些关键问题，如功能兼容性和搜索结果的多样性有限，这可能导致 mashup 创建失败和开发效率降低。为了应对这些挑战，本文设计了 DAWAR，这是一种多样性感知的 Web API 推荐方法，它为 mashup 创建寻找多样性和兼容的 API。具体来说，用于 mashup 创建的 API 推荐问题被建模为一个图搜索问题，其目的是在 API 的相关图中找到最小组 Steiner 树。DAWAR 创新地使用决定点过程来使推荐的结果多样化。对现实世界中常用的数据集进行了实证评估，统计结果表明，DAWAR 在推荐多样性、准确性和兼容性方面都有显著的提高。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=DAWAR:+Diversity-aware+Web+APIs+Recommendation+for+Mashup+Creation+based+on+Correlation+Graph)|3|

However, existing methods mainly focus on modeling the sequential regularity of check-in sequences but pay little attention to the intrinsic characteristics of POIs, neglecting the entanglement of the diverse influence stemming from different aspects of POIs. In this paper, we propose a novel Disentangled Representation-enhanced Attention Network (DRAN) for next POI recommendation, which leverages the disentangled representations to explicitly model different aspects and corresponding influence for representing a POI more precisely. Specifically, we first design a propagation rule to learn graph-based disentangled representations by refining two types of POI relation graphs, making full use of the distance-based and transition-based influence for representation learning. Then, we extend the attention architecture to aggregate personalized spatio-temporal information for modeling dynamic user preferences on the next timestamp, while maintaining the different components of disentangled representations independent. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model to state-of-the-art approaches.

However, manually designing a good loss is a big challenge due to the complexity of the problem. A large fraction of previous work focuses on handcrafted loss functions, which needs significant expertise and human effort. In this paper, inspired by the recent development of automated machine learning, we propose an automatic loss function generation framework, AutoLossGen, which is able to generate loss functions directly constructed from basic mathematical operators without prior knowledge on loss structure. More specifically, we develop a controller model driven by reinforcement learning to generate loss functions, and develop iterative and alternating optimization schedule to update the parameters of both the controller model and the recommender model. One challenge for automatic loss generation in recommender systems is the extreme sparsity of recommendation datasets, which leads to the sparse reward problem for loss generation and search. To solve the problem, we further develop a reward filtering mechanism for efficient and effective loss generation. Experimental results show that our framework manages to create tailored loss functions for different recommendation models and datasets, and the generated loss gives better recommendation performance than commonly used baseline losses. Besides, most of the generated losses are transferable, i.e., the loss generated based on one model and dataset also works well for another model or dataset.

In this paper, we propose meta graph enhanced off-policy learning (MGPolicy), which is the first recommendation model for correcting the off-policy bias via contextual information. In particular, we explicitly leverage rich semantics in meta graphs for user state representation, and then train the candidate generation model to promote an efficient search in the action space. lMoreover, our MGpolicy is designed with counterfactual risk minimization, which can correct poicy learning bias and ultimately yield an effective target policy to maximize the long-run rewards for the recommendation.

The problem of privacy leakage still exists when directly sharing the private user interaction data with organizations or releasing them to the public. To address this problem, in this paper, we present a User Privacy Controllable Synthetic Data Generation model (short for UPC-SDG), which generates synthetic interaction data for users based on their privacy preferences. The generation model aims to provide certain privacy guarantees while maximizing the utility of the generated synthetic data at both data level and item level. Specifically, at the data level, we design a selection module that selects those items that contribute less to a user's preferences from the user's interaction data. At the item level, a synthetic data generation module is proposed to generate a synthetic item corresponding to the selected item based on the user's preferences.

Generally speaking, observed interactions are considered as positive samples, while unobserved interactions are considered as negative ones. However, implicit feedback is inherently noisy because of the ubiquitous presence of noisy-positive and noisy-negative interactions. Recently, some studies have noticed the importance of denoising implicit feedback for recommendations, and enhanced the robustness of recommendation models to some extent. Nonetheless, they typically fail to (1) capture the hard yet clean interactions for learning comprehensive user preference, and (2) provide a universal denoising solution that can be applied to various kinds of recommendation models. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the memorization effect of recommendation models, and propose a new denoising paradigm, i.e., Self-Guided Denoising Learning (SGDL), which is able to collect memorized interactions at the early stage of the training (i.e., ''noise-resistant'' period), and leverage those data as denoising signals to guide the following training (i.e., ''noise-sensitive'' period) of the model in a meta-learning manner. Besides, our method can automatically switch its learning phase at the memorization point from memorization to self-guided learning, and select clean and informative memorized data via a novel adaptive denoising scheduler to improve the robustness. We incorporate SGDL with four representative recommendation models (i.e., NeuMF, CDAE, NGCF and LightGCN) and different loss functions (i.e., binary cross-entropy and BPR loss). The experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SGDL over the state-of-the-art denoising methods like T-CE, IR, DeCA, and even state-of-the-art robust graph-based methods like SGCN and SGL.|无处不在的隐式反馈使它们成为构建现代推荐系统的默认选择。一般来说，观察到的相互作用被认为是积极的样本，而未观察到的相互作用被认为是消极的。然而，由于噪声-正向和噪声-负向相互作用的普遍存在，隐式反馈本质上是有噪声的。近年来，一些研究已经注意到去除推荐内隐反馈的重要性，并在一定程度上增强了推荐模型的鲁棒性。尽管如此，它们通常无法(1)捕捉到用于学习全面的用户偏好的硬而干净的交互，(2)提供一个可以应用于各种推荐模型的通用去噪解决方案。本文对推荐模型的记忆效应进行了深入研究，提出了一种新的去噪范式，即自我引导去噪学习(SGDL) ，它能够在训练的早期阶段(即“噪声抵抗期”)收集记忆交互信息，并利用这些数据作为去噪信号，以元学习的方式指导模型的后续训练(即“噪声敏感期”)。此外，该方法可以在记忆点自动切换学习阶段，由记忆阶段转变为自我引导学习阶段，并通过一种新的自适应去噪调度器选择清晰、信息丰富的记忆数据，提高了算法的鲁棒性。我们将 SGDL 与四个代表性的推荐模型(即 NeuMF，CDAE，NGCF 和 LightGCN)和不同的损失函数(即二进制交叉熵和 BPR 损失)结合起来。在三个基准数据集上的实验结果证明了 SGDL 相对于最先进的去噪方法如 T-CE、 IR、 DeCA，甚至是最先进的基于图的鲁棒性方法如 SGCN 和 SGL 的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Self-Guided+Learning+to+Denoise+for+Robust+Recommendation)|3|

|[DH-HGCN: Dual Homogeneity Hypergraph Convolutional Network for Multiple Social Recommendations](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531828)|Jiadi Han, Qian Tao, Yufei Tang, Yuhan Xia|Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, FL, USA; South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China; Northeastern University, Shenyang, China|Social relations are often used as auxiliary information to improve recommendations. In the real-world, social relations among users are complex and diverse. However, most existing recommendation methods assume only single social relation (i.e., exploit pairwise relations to mine user preferences), ignoring the impact of multifaceted social relations on user preferences (i.e., high order complexity of user relations). Moreover, an observing fact is that similar items always have similar attractiveness when exposed to users, indicating a potential connection among the static attributes of items. Here, we advocate modeling the dual homogeneity from social relations and item connections by hypergraph convolution networks, named DH-HGCN, to obtain high-order correlations among users and items. Specifically, we use sentiment analysis to extract comment relation and use the k-means clustering to construct item-item correlations, and we then optimize those heterogeneous graphs in a unified framework. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.|社会关系往往被用作辅助信息，以改善建议。在现实世界中，用户之间的社会关系是复杂多样的。然而，大多数现有的推荐方法只假设单一的社会关系(即，利用成对关系挖掘用户偏好) ，忽略了多方面的社会关系对用户偏好的影响(即，用户关系的高度复杂性)。此外，一个观察事实是，相似的项目总是具有相似的吸引力时，暴露给用户，表明项目的静态属性之间的潜在联系。本文主张利用超图卷积网络(DH-HGCN)从社会关系和项目连接两方面建立双同质性模型，以获得用户和项目之间的高阶相关性。具体来说，我们使用情绪分析来提取评论关系，并使用 K平均算法来构建项目-项目关联，然后在一个统一的框架内优化这些异构图。在两个实际数据集上的大量实验证明了该模型的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=DH-HGCN:+Dual+Homogeneity+Hypergraph+Convolutional+Network+for+Multiple+Social+Recommendations)|3|
|[To Interpolate or not to Interpolate: PRF, Dense and Sparse Retrievers](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531884)|Hang Li, Shuai Wang, Shengyao Zhuang, Ahmed Mourad, Xueguang Ma, Jimmy Lin, Guido Zuccon|The University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia; University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada; The University of Queensland, Brisbane, VIC, Australia|Current pre-trained language model approaches to information retrieval can be broadly divided into two categories: sparse retrievers (to which belong also non-neural approaches such as bag-of-words methods, e.g., BM25) and dense retrievers. Each of these categories appears to capture different characteristics of relevance. Previous work has investigated how relevance signals from sparse retrievers could be combined with those from dense retrievers via interpolation. Such interpolation would generally lead to higher retrieval effectiveness. In this paper we consider the problem of combining the relevance signals from sparse and dense retrievers in the context of Pseudo Relevance Feedback (PRF). This context poses two key challenges: (1) When should interpolation occur: before, after, or both before and after the PRF process? (2) Which sparse representation should be considered: a zero-shot bag-of-words model (BM25), or a learned sparse representation? To answer these questions we perform a thorough empirical evaluation considering an effective and scalable neural PRF approach (Vector-PRF), three effective dense retrievers (ANCE, TCTv2, DistillBERT), and one state-of-the-art learned sparse retriever (uniCOIL). The empirical findings from our experiments suggest that, regardless of sparse representation and dense retriever, interpolation both before and after PRF achieves the highest effectiveness across most datasets and metrics.|目前预先训练的信息检索语言模型方法可以大致分为两类: 稀疏检索器(也属于非神经方法，如单词袋法，例如，BM25)和稠密检索器。这些类别中的每一个似乎都捕获了不同的相关性特征。先前的工作已经研究了如何通过插值将稀疏检索器的相关信号与密集检索器的相关信号相结合。这样的插值通常会导致更高的检索效率。在本文中，我们考虑了在伪关联反馈(PRF)的情况下合并稀疏和密集检索器的相关信号的问题。这种情况提出了两个关键的挑战: (1)什么时候应该插值发生: 之前，之后，或两者之前和之后的 PRF 过程？(2)应该考虑哪种稀疏表示法: 零词袋模型表示法(BM25) ，还是学习型稀疏表示法？为了回答这些问题，我们考虑到有效和可扩展的神经 PRF 方法(Vector-PRF) ，三个有效的稠密检索器(ANCE，TCTv2，DistillBERT)和一个最先进的稀疏检索器(uniCOIL)进行了彻底的经验评估。我们的实验结果表明，不管稀疏表示和密集检索，在 PRF 之前和之后的插值在大多数数据集和度量中都达到了最高的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=To+Interpolate+or+not+to+Interpolate:+PRF,+Dense+and+Sparse+Retrievers)|3|

In real-world systems, users usually have multiple sensitive attributes (e.g. age, gender, and occupation), and users may not want their recommendation results influenced by those attributes. Moreover, which of and when these user attributes should be considered in fairness-aware modeling should depend on users' specific demands. In this work, we define the selective fairness task, where users can flexibly choose which sensitive attributes should the recommendation model be bias-free. We propose a novel parameter-efficient prompt-based fairness-aware recommendation (PFRec) framework, which relies on attribute-specific prompt-based bias eliminators with adversarial training, enabling selective fairness with different attribute combinations on sequential recommendation. Both task-specific and user-specific prompts are considered. We conduct extensive evaluations to verify PFRec's superiority in selective fairness.

Typically, a deployed model undergoes frequent re-training to capture users' dynamic behaviors from newly collected interaction logs. However, the current model training process only acquires users' feedbacks as labels, but fails to take into account the errors made in previous recommendations. Inspired by the intuition that humans usually reflect and learn from mistakes, in this paper, we attempt to build a self-correction continual learning loop (dubbed ReLoop) for recommender systems. In particular, a new customized loss is employed to encourage every new model version to reduce prediction errors over the previous model version during training. Our ReLoop learning framework enables a continual self-correction process in the long run and thus is expected to obtain better performance over existing training strategies.

Most existing social networks follow a centralized system model, which despite storing valuable information of users, arise many critical concerns such as content ownership and over-commercialization. Recently, decentralized social networks, built primarily on blockchain technology, have been proposed as a substitution to eliminate these concerns. Since decentralized architectures are mature enough to be on par with the centralized ones, decentralized social networks are becoming more and more popular. Decentralized social networks can offer both common options like writing posts and comments and more advanced options such as reward systems and voting mechanisms. They provide rich eco-systems for the influencers to interact with their followers and other users via staking systems based on cryptocurrency tokens. The vast and valuable data of the decentralized social networks open several new directions for the research community to extend human behavior knowledge. However, accessing and collecting data from these social networks is not easy because it requires strong blockchain knowledge, which is not the main focus of computer science and social science researchers. Hence, our work proposes the SoChainDB framework that facilitates obtaining data from these new social networks. To show the capacity and strength of SoChainDB, we crawl and publish Hive data - one of the largest blockchain-based social networks. We conduct extensive analyses to understand the insight of Hive data and discuss some interesting applications, e.g., game, non-fungible tokens market built upon Hive. It is worth mentioning that our framework is well-adaptable to other blockchain social networks with minimal modification. SoChainDB is publicly accessible at http://sochaindb.com and the dataset is available under the CC BY-SA 4.0 license.|社交网络已经成为人类活动不可分割的一部分。大多数现有的社交网络遵循一种集中的系统模型，尽管它存储了用户的有价值的信息，但是也引起了许多关键的问题，如内容所有权和过度商业化。最近，分散的社会网络，主要建立在区块链技术，已提出作为一种替代，以消除这些关注。由于分散式体系结构已经足够成熟，可以与集中式体系结构相媲美，分散式社交网络正变得越来越流行。分散的社交网络既可以提供一般的选择，比如写帖子和评论，也可以提供更高级的选择，比如奖励制度和投票机制。它们为影响者提供了丰富的生态系统，通过基于加密货币令牌的标注系统与其追随者和其他用户进行交互。去中心化的社会网络的大量有价值的数据为研究团体拓展人类行为知识开辟了几个新的方向。然而，从这些社交网络访问和收集数据并不容易，因为它需要强大的区块链知识，这并不是计算机科学和社会科学研究人员的主要重点。因此，我们的工作提出了 SoChainDB 框架，该框架有助于从这些新的社交网络获取数据。为了展示 SoChainDB 的能力和强度，我们抓取并发布了 Hive 数据——最大的基于区块链的社交网络之一。我们进行了广泛的分析，以了解蜂巢数据的洞察力，并讨论了一些有趣的应用程序，例如，游戏，不可替代的令牌市场建立在蜂巢。值得一提的是，我们的框架可以很好地适应其他区块链社交网络，只需要最小限度的修改。SochainDB 可以在 http://SoChainDB.com 上公开访问，并且数据集可以在 CC BY-SA 4.0许可下获得。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=SoChainDB:+A+Database+for+Storing+and+Retrieving+Blockchain-Powered+Social+Network+Data)|3|

Complexity comes from the reliance on lengthy Boolean queries, which express a detailed research question. To aid query formulation, information specialists use a set of exemplar documents, called 'seed studies', prior to query formulation. Seed studies help verify the effectiveness of a query prior to the full assessment of retrieved studies. Beyond this use of seeds, specific IR methods can exploit seed studies for guiding both automatic query formulation and new retrieval models. One major limitation of work to date is that these methods exploit 'pseudo seed studies' through retrospective use of included studies (i.e., relevance assessments). However, we show pseudo seed studies are not representative of real seed studies used by information specialists. Hence, we provide a test collection with real world seed studies used to assist with the formulation of queries. To support our collection, we provide an analysis, previously not possible, on how seed studies impact retrieval and perform several experiments using seed study based methods to compare the effectiveness of using seed studies versus pseudo seed studies.

Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate that DIMKT outperforms state-of-the-art KT models.

Although meta-learning is widely adopted to address the data sparsity problem in general domains, directly applying it to healthcare data is less effective, since it is unclear how to capture both the temporal relations in clinical visits and the complicated relations among syndromic diseases for precise personalized diagnosis. To this end, we first propose a novel Meta-learning framework for cold-start diagnosis prediction in healthCare data (MetaCare). By explicitly encoding the effects of disease progress over time as a generalization prior, MetaCare dynamically predicts future diagnosis and timestamp for infrequent patients. Then, to model complicated relations among rare diseases, we propose to utilize domain knowledge of hierarchical relations among diseases, and further perform diagnosis subtyping to mine the latent syndromic relations among diseases. Finally, to tailor the generic meta-learning framework with personalized parameters, we design a hierarchical patient subtyping mechanism and bridge the modeling of both infrequent patients and rare diseases. We term the joint model as MetaCare++. Extensive experiments on two real-world benchmark datasets show significant performance gains brought by MetaCare++, yielding average improvements of 7.71% for diagnosis prediction and 13.94% for diagnosis time prediction over the state-of-the-art baselines.|冷启动诊断预测是医疗保健中 AI 的一项具有挑战性的任务，通常每个病人只有几次就诊，每个疾病只有几次观察。尽管元学习被广泛用于解决一般领域的数据稀疏问题，但直接应用于医疗保健数据的效果较差，因为目前还不清楚如何捕获临床访视中的时间关系和综合征疾病之间的复杂关系以进行精确的个性化诊断。为此，我们首先提出了一个新的元学习框架，用于医疗保健数据(MetaCare)中的冷启动诊断预测。通过明确编码疾病进展随时间推移的影响作为一个普遍的先例，MetaCare 动态预测未来的诊断和时间戳的罕见病人。然后，利用疾病之间等级关系的领域知识，进一步进行诊断分型，挖掘疾病之间潜在的综合征关系，建立罕见病之间复杂关系的模型。最后，为了使通用的元学习框架具有个性化的参数，我们设计了一个分层的患者亚型机制，并在罕见患者和罕见疾病的建模之间架起了桥梁。我们将联合模型称为 MetaCare + + 。在两个真实世界基准数据集上的广泛实验显示 MetaCare + + 带来了显着的性能提高，在最先进的基线上诊断预测平均提高了7.71% ，诊断时间预测平均提高了13.94% 。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=MetaCare++:+Meta-Learning+with+Hierarchical+Subtyping+for+Cold-Start+Diagnosis+Prediction+in+Healthcare+Data)|3|

Fake news detection aims to train a model on the past news and detect fake news of the future. Though great efforts have been made, existing fake news detection methods overlooked the unintended entity bias in the real-world data, which seriously influences models' generalization ability to future data. For example, 97% of news pieces in 2010-2017 containing the entity 'Donald Trump' are real in our data, but the percentage falls down to merely 33% in 2018. This would lead the model trained on the former set to hardly generalize to the latter, as it tends to predict news pieces about 'Donald Trump' as real for lower training loss. In this paper, we propose an entity debiasing framework (ENDEF) which generalizes fake news detection models to the future data by mitigating entity bias from a cause-effect perspective. Based on the causal graph among entities, news contents, and news veracity, we separately model the contribution of each cause (entities and contents) during training. In the inference stage, we remove the direct effect of the entities to mitigate entity bias. Extensive offline experiments on the English and Chinese datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework can largely improve the performance of base fake news detectors, and online tests verify its superiority in practice. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly improve the generalization ability of fake news detection models to the future data. The code has been released at https://github.com/ICTMCG/ENDEF-SIGIR2022.|假新闻的广泛传播日益威胁着个人和社会。假新闻检测的目的是训练一个模型，以过去的新闻和检测假新闻的未来。现有的假新闻检测方法忽视了现实数据中存在的无意识实体偏差，严重影响了模型对未来数据的泛化能力。例如，在我们的数据中，2010-2017年包含实体“唐纳德 · 特朗普”的新闻报道有97% 是真实的，但这一比例在2018年下降到仅有33% 。这将导致在前者上训练的模型很难推广到后者，因为它往往预测关于“唐纳德 · 特朗普”的新闻报道是真实的，以降低训练损失。本文提出了一个实体去偏框架(ENDEF) ，从因果关系的角度将虚假新闻检测模型推广到未来数据，减轻实体偏差。基于实体、新闻内容和新闻准确性之间的因果图，我们分别建立了训练过程中各个因素(实体和内容)的贡献模型。在推理阶段，我们消除了实体的直接影响，以减轻实体偏差。在中英文数据集上进行的大量离线实验表明，该框架能够显著提高基本假新闻检测器的性能，在线测试验证了该框架在实际应用中的优越性。据我们所知，这是第一项明确提高假新闻检测模型对未来数据的泛化能力的工作。密码已经在 https://github.com/ictmcg/endef-sigir2022公布了。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Generalizing+to+the+Future:+Mitigating+Entity+Bias+in+Fake+News+Detection)|3|
|[ORCAS-I: Queries Annotated with Intent using Weak Supervision](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531737)|Daria Alexander, Wojciech Kusa, Arjen P. de Vries|Radboud University, Nijmegen, Netherlands; Radboud University & Spinque, Nijmegen, Netherlands; TU Wien, Vienna, Austria|User intent classification is an important task in information retrieval. In this work, we introduce a revised taxonomy of user intent. We take the widely used differentiation between navigational, transactional and informational queries as a starting point, and identify three different sub-classes for the informational queries: instrumental, factual and abstain. The resulting classification of user queries is more fine-grained, reaches a high level of consistency between annotators, and can serve as the basis for an effective automatic classification process. The newly introduced categories help distinguish between types of queries that a retrieval system could act upon, for example by prioritizing different types of results in the ranking. We have used a weak supervision approach based on Snorkel to annotate the ORCAS dataset according to our new user intent taxonomy, utilising established heuristics and keywords to construct rules for the prediction of the intent category. We then present a series of experiments with a variety of machine learning models, using the labels from the weak supervision stage as training data, but find that the results produced by Snorkel are not outperformed by these competing approaches and can be considered state-of-the-art. The advantage of a rule-based approach like Snorkel's is its efficient deployment in an actual system, where intent classification would be executed for every query issued. The resource released with this paper is the ORCAS-I dataset: a labelled version of the ORCAS click-based dataset of Web queries, which provides 18 million connections to 10 million distinct queries. We anticipate the usage of this resource in a scenario where the retrieval system would change its internal workings and search user interface to match the type of information request. For example, a navigational query could trigger just a short result list; and, for instrumental intent the system could rank tutorials and instructions higher than for other types of queries.|用户意图分类是信息检索的一项重要工作。在这项工作中，我们介绍了修订后的用户意图分类法。我们以广泛使用的导航查询、事务性查询和信息性查询之间的区别为出发点，确定了信息性查询的三个不同的子类: 工具性查询、事实性查询和弃权查询。由此产生的用户查询分类更加细粒度，达到了注释者之间的高度一致性，可以作为一个有效的自动分类过程的基础。新引入的类别有助于区分检索系统可以处理的查询类型，例如，通过在排名中对不同类型的结果进行优先排序。我们使用了基于 Snorkel 的弱监督方法来根据我们新的用户意图分类法对 ORCAS 数据集进行注释，使用已建立的启发式和关键字来构建用于预测意图类别的规则。然后，我们用各种机器学习模型进行了一系列的实验，使用来自弱监督阶段的标签作为训练数据，但是发现 Snorkel 产生的结果并没有被这些相互竞争的方法所超越，并且可以被认为是最先进的。像 Snorkel 这样的基于规则的方法的优势在于它在实际系统中的高效部署，在实际系统中，将对发出的每个查询执行意图分类。与本文一起发布的资源是 ORCAS-I 数据集: 基于 ORCAS 单击的 Web 查询数据集的标记版本，它提供了1800万个对1000万个不同查询的连接。我们预期在检索系统将改变其内部工作方式并搜索用户界面以匹配信息请求类型的场景中使用此资源。例如，导航查询只能触发一个简短的结果列表; 而且，对于工具意图，系统可以将教程和指令排序得比其他类型的查询更高。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=ORCAS-I:+Queries+Annotated+with+Intent+using+Weak+Supervision)|3|
|[Unified Dialog Model Pre-training for Task-Oriented Dialog Understanding and Generation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3532069)|Wanwei He, Yinpei Dai, Min Yang, Jian Sun, Fei Huang, Luo Si, Yongbin Li|Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen, China; Alibaba Group, Beijing, China|Recently, pre-training methods have shown remarkable success in task-oriented dialog (TOD) systems. However, most existing pre-trained models for TOD focus on either dialog understanding or dialog generation, but not both. In this paper, we propose SPACE, a novel unified pre-trained dialog model learning from large-scale dialog corpora with limited annotations, which can be effectively fine-tuned on a wide range of downstream dialog tasks. Specifically, SPACE consists of four successive components in a single transformer to maintain a task-flow in TOD systems: (i) a dialog encoding module to encode dialog history, (ii) a dialog understanding module to extract semantic vectors from either user queries or system responses, (iii) a dialog policy module to generate a policy vector that contains high-level semantics of the response, and (iv) a dialog generation module to produce appropriate responses. We design a dedicated pre-training objective for each component. Concretely, we pre-train the dialog encoding module with span mask language modeling to learn contextualized dialog information. To capture the structured dialog semantics, we pre-train the dialog understanding module via a novel tree-induced semi-supervised contrastive learning objective with the help of extra dialog annotations. In addition, we pre-train the dialog policy module by minimizing the ℒ2 distance between its output policy vector and the semantic vector of the response for policy optimization.

The goal of KT is to provide personalized learning paths for learners by diagnosing the mastery of each knowledge, thus improving the learning efficiency. In recent years, many deep learning models have been applied to tackle the KT task, which has shown promising results. However, most existing methods simplify the exercising records as knowledge sequences, which fail to explore the rich information that existed in exercises. Besides, the existing diagnosis results of knowledge tracing are not convincing enough since they neglect hierarchical relations between exercises. To solve the above problems, we propose a hierarchical graph knowledge tracing model called HGKT to explore the latent complex relations between exercises. Specifically, we introduce the concept of problem schema to construct a hierarchical exercise graph that could model the exercise learning dependencies. Moreover, we employ two attention mechanisms to highlight important historical states of learners. In the testing stage, we present a knowledge&schema diagnosis matrix that could trace the transition of mastery of knowledge and problem schema, which can be more easily applied to different applications. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness and interpretability of our proposed model.|知识追踪是计算机辅助教育系统中的一个重要组成部分，其目的是预测学习者的知识掌握情况。KT 的目标是通过诊断学习者对各种知识的掌握情况，为学习者提供个性化的学习途径，从而提高学习效率。近年来，许多深度学习模型被应用于解决 KT 问题，并取得了良好的效果。然而，现有的方法大多将习题记录简化为知识序列，未能探索习题中存在的丰富信息。此外，现有的知识追踪诊断结果由于忽视了习题之间的层次关系而不够令人信服。为了解决上述问题，本文提出了一种层次化的图形知识跟踪模型 HGKT，用于探索习题之间潜在的复杂关系。具体地说，我们引入了问题模式的概念，构造了一个层次化的练习图，可以对练习学习的依赖关系进行建模。此外，我们采用了两种注意机制来突出学习者的重要历史状态。在测试阶段，我们提出了一个知识和图式诊断矩阵，它可以跟踪知识掌握和问题图式的转换，可以更容易地应用到不同的应用程序中。大量的实验表明了我们提出的模型的有效性和可解释性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Introducing+Problem+Schema+with+Hierarchical+Exercise+Graph+for+Knowledge+Tracing)|3|

Static resources that include test collections and sets of topics, the corresponding relevance judgments connecting them, and metrics that map document rankings from a retrieval system to numeric scores have been used for multiple decades as an important way of comparing systems. The basis behind this experimental structure is that the metric score for a system can serve as a surrogate measurement for user satisfaction. Here we introduce a user behavior framework that extends the C/W/L family. The essence of the new framework - which we call C/W/L/A - is that the user actions that are undertaken while reading the ranking can be considered separately from the benefit that each user will have derived as they exit the ranking. This split structure allows the great majority of current effectiveness metrics to be systematically categorized, and thus their relative properties and relationships to be better understood; and at the same time permits a wide range of novel combinations to be considered. We then carry out experiments using relevance judgments, document rankings, and user satisfaction data from two distinct sources, comparing the patterns of metric scores generated, and showing that those metrics vary quite markedly in terms of their ability to predict user satisfaction.|离线效能指标的使用是信息检索评估的基石之一。静态资源，包括测试集合和主题集合，相应的相关性判断连接它们，以及将文档排名从检索系统映射到数字分数的指标，已经作为比较系统的一个重要方法使用了几十年。这个实验结构的基础是系统的度量分数可以作为用户满意度的替代指标。这里我们介绍一个扩展 C/W/L 家族的用户行为框架。我们称之为 C/W/L/A 的新框架的本质是，用户在阅读排名时所采取的行动可以与每个用户在退出排名时获得的好处分开考虑。这种分离结构允许对大多数当前有效性指标进行系统分类，从而更好地理解它们的相对属性和关系; 同时允许考虑范围广泛的新颖组合。然后，我们使用来自两个不同来源的相关性判断、文档排名和用户满意度数据进行实验，比较产生的度量得分模式，并显示这些度量在预测用户满意度方面的能力差异非常显著。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=A+Flexible+Framework+for+Offline+Effectiveness+Metrics)|3|

Although this task has been deeply studied, most previous studies are limited to the transductive setting and cannot handle emerging entities. Actually, the inductive setting is closer to real-life scenarios because it allows entities in the testing phase to be unseen during training. However, it is challenging to precisely conduct inductive relation prediction as there exists requirements of entity-independent relation modeling and discrete logical reasoning for interoperability. To this end, we propose a novel model ConGLR to incorporate context graph with logical reasoning. Firstly, the enclosing subgraph w.r.t. target head and tail entities are extracted and initialized by the double radius labeling. And then the context graph involving relational paths, relations and entities is introduced. Secondly, two graph convolutional networks (GCNs) with the information interaction of entities and relations are carried out to process the subgraph and context graph respectively. Considering the influence of different edges and target relations, we introduce edge-aware and relation-aware attention mechanisms for the subgraph GCN. Finally, by treating the relational path as rule body and target relation as rule head, we integrate neural calculating and logical reasoning to obtain inductive scores. And to focus on the specific modeling goals of each module, the stop-gradient is utilized in the information interaction between context graph and subgraph GCNs in the training process. In this way, ConGLR satisfies two inductive requirements at the same time. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConGLR obtains outstanding performance against state-of-the-art baselines on twelve inductive dataset versions of three common KGs.|知识图关系预测的目的是从观察到的三元组中推断出缺失的有效三元组。虽然这项任务已经深入研究，大多数以前的研究仅限于传导性的设置，不能处理新兴的实体。实际上，归纳设置更接近于实际场景，因为它允许测试阶段的实体在训练期间不被看到。然而，精确地进行归纳关系预测是具有挑战性的，因为存在实体无关的关系建模和互操作性的离散逻辑推理的要求。为此，我们提出了一个新的模型 ConGLR，将上下文图和逻辑推理结合起来。首先，通过双半径标记提取封闭子图的目标头部和尾部实体，并对其进行初始化;。然后介绍了涉及关系路径、关系和实体的上下文图。其次，分别对子图和上下文图进行处理，构造了两个具有实体和关系信息交互的图卷积网络。考虑到不同边和目标关系的影响，我们在子图 GCN 中引入了边感知和关系感知的注意机制。最后，我们把关系路径当作规则体，把目标关系当作规则头，结合神经计算和逻辑推理来获得归纳分数。针对每个模块的特定建模目标，在训练过程中，利用停止梯度进行上下文图和子图 GCNs 之间的信息交互。这样，ConGLR 可以同时满足两个感应要求。大量的实验表明，ConGLR 在三个常见 KG 的12个归纳数据集版本上对最先进的基线获得了出色的性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Incorporating+Context+Graph+with+Logical+Reasoning+for+Inductive+Relation+Prediction)|3|

Since most MKGs are far from complete, extensive knowledge graph completion studies have been proposed focusing on the multimodal entity, relation extraction and link prediction. However, different tasks and modalities require changes to the model architecture, and not all images/objects are relevant to text input, which hinders the applicability to diverse real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a hybrid transformer with multi-level fusion to address those issues. Specifically, we leverage a hybrid transformer architecture with unified input-output for diverse multimodal knowledge graph completion tasks. Moreover, we propose multi-level fusion, which integrates visual and text representation via coarse-grained prefix-guided interaction and fine-grained correlation-aware fusion modules.

In this paper, we focus on how to effectively exploit the hierarchical topic to improve the keyphrase generation performance (HTKG). Specifically, we propose a novel hierarchical topic-guided variational neural sequence generation method for keyphrase generation, which consists of two major modules: a neural hierarchical topic model that learns the latent topic tree across the whole corpus of documents, and a variational neural keyphrase generation model to generate keyphrases under hierarchical topic guidance. Finally, these two modules are jointly trained to help them learn complementary information from each other. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to leverage the neural hierarchical topic to guide keyphrase generation.

To further equip the machine with the reasoning capability, the challenging task of logical reasoning is proposed. Previous works on logical reasoning have proposed some strategies to extract the logical units from different aspects. However, there still remains a challenge to model the long distance dependency among the logical units. Also, it is demanding to uncover the logical structures of the text and further fuse the discrete logic to the continuous text embedding. To tackle the above issues, we propose an end-to-end model Logiformer which utilizes a two-branch graph transformer network for logical reasoning of text. Firstly, we introduce different extraction strategies to split the text into two sets of logical units, and construct the logical graph and the syntax graph respectively. The logical graph models the causal relations for the logical branch while the syntax graph captures the co-occurrence relations for the syntax branch. Secondly, to model the long distance dependency, the node sequence from each graph is fed into the fully connected graph transformer structures. The two adjacent matrices are viewed as the attention biases for the graph transformer layers, which map the discrete logical structures to the continuous text embedding space. Thirdly, a dynamic gate mechanism and a question-aware self-attention module are introduced before the answer prediction to update the features. The reasoning process provides the interpretability by employing the logical units, which are consistent with human cognition.

First, traditional methods regard item attributes as ID features, while neglecting structure information and relation dependencies among attributes. Second, when mining user interests from user-item interactions, current models ignore user intents and item intents for different attributes, which lacks interpretability.

Thus, recommender systems for fashion need to consider diversity and elevate the shopping experience by recommending new brands and products from the catalog. In this work, we explored a handful of diversification strategies to rerank the output of a relevance-focused recommender system. Subsequently, we conducted a multi-objective offline experiment optimizing for relevance and diversity simultaneously. We measured diversity with commonly used metrics such as coverage, serendipity, and neighborhood distance, whereas, for relevance, we selected ranking metrics such as recall. The best diversification strategy offline improved user engagement by 2% in click-through rate and presented an uplift of 46% in distinct brands recommended when AB tested against real users. These results reinforced the importance of considering accuracy and diversity metrics when developing a recommender system.|专注于准确性的个性化算法可能会提供高度相关的推荐，但推荐的项目可能与当前用户的偏好过于相似。因此，推荐者可能会阻止用户探索新的产品和品牌(过滤气泡)。这对于奢侈品时尚推荐来说尤其重要，因为奢侈品消费者希望发现独一无二的稀有物品。因此，时尚推荐系统需要考虑多样性，并通过推荐目录中的新品牌和产品来提升购物体验。在这项工作中，我们探索了一些多样化策略，以重新排列以相关性为中心的推荐系统的产出。随后，我们进行了多目标离线实验，同时对相关性和多样性进行了优化。我们使用常用的指标(如覆盖率、意外发现和邻近距离)来衡量多样性，而对于相关性，我们选择了排名指标(如回忆)。线下最佳多样化策略提高了2% 的用户参与点进率，当 AB 公司对真实用户进行测试时，推荐的不同品牌的用户参与度提高了46% 。这些结果强调了在开发推荐系统时考虑准确性和多样性指标的重要性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Diversity+Vs+Relevance:+A+Practical+Multi-objective+Study+in+Luxury+Fashion+Recommendations)|2|
|[Exploiting Variational Domain-Invariant User Embedding for Partially Overlapped Cross Domain Recommendation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531975)|Weiming Liu, Xiaolin Zheng, Jiajie Su, Mengling Hu, Yanchao Tan, Chaochao Chen|Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China|Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) has been popularly studied to utilize different domain knowledge to solve the cold-start problem in recommender systems. Most of the existing CDR models assume that both the source and target domains share the same overlapped user set for knowledge transfer. However, only few proportion of users simultaneously activate on both the source and target domains in practical CDR tasks. In this paper, we focus on the Partially Overlapped Cross-Domain Recommendation (POCDR) problem, that is, how to leverage the information of both the overlapped and non-overlapped users to improve recommendation performance. Existing approaches cannot fully utilize the useful knowledge behind the non-overlapped users across domains, which limits the model performance when the majority of users turn out to be non-overlapped. To address this issue, we propose an end-to-end Dual-autoencoder with Variational Domain-invariant Embedding Alignment (VDEA) model, a cross-domain recommendation framework for the POCDR problem, which utilizes dual variational autoencoders with both local and global embedding alignment for exploiting domain-invariant user embedding. VDEA first adopts variational inference to capture collaborative user preferences, and then utilizes Gromov-Wasserstein distribution co-clustering optimal transport to cluster the users with similar rating interaction behaviors. Our empirical studies on Douban and Amazon datasets demonstrate that VDEA significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models, especially under the POCDR setting.|跨域推荐(CDR)是一种利用不同领域知识解决推荐系统冷启动问题的方法。现有的 CDR 模型大多假设源域和目标域共享相同的重叠用户集进行知识转移。然而，在实际的 CDR 任务中，只有少数用户在源域和目标域同时激活。本文主要研究部分重叠跨域推荐(POCDR)问题，即如何利用重叠用户和非重叠用户的信息来提高推荐性能。现有的方法不能充分利用跨领域非重叠用户背后的有用知识，这限制了大多数用户不重叠时的模型性能。针对这一问题，本文提出了一种基于变分域不变嵌入对齐(VDEA)模型的端到端双变分自动编码器，该模型利用具有局部和全局嵌入对齐的双变分自动编码器进行域不变用户嵌入。VDEA 首先采用变分推理获取协同用户偏好，然后利用 Gromov-Wasserstein 分布协聚类最优传输对具有相似评分交互行为的用户进行聚类。我们对 Douban 和亚马逊数据集的实证研究表明，VDEA 显著优于最先进的模型，特别是在 POCDR 设置下。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Exploiting+Variational+Domain-Invariant+User+Embedding+for+Partially+Overlapped+Cross+Domain+Recommendation)|2|
|[Variational Reasoning about User Preferences for Conversational Recommendation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3532077)|Zhaochun Ren, Zhi Tian, Dongdong Li, Pengjie Ren, Liu Yang, Xin Xin, Huasheng Liang, Maarten de Rijke, Zhumin Chen|Shandong University, Qingdao, China; WeChat, Tencent, Shenzhen, China; University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands|Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) provide recommendations through interactive conversations. CRSs typically provide recommendations through relatively straightforward interactions, where the system continuously inquires about a user's explicit attribute-aware preferences and then decides which items to recommend. In addition, topic tracking is often used to provide naturally sounding responses. However, merely tracking topics is not enough to recognize a user's real preferences in a dialogue. In this paper, we address the problem of accurately recognizing and maintaining user preferences in CRSs. Three challenges come with this problem: (1) An ongoing dialogue only provides the user's short-term feedback; (2) Annotations of user preferences are not available; and (3) There may be complex semantic correlations among items that feature in a dialogue. We tackle these challenges by proposing an end-to-end variational reasoning approach to the task of conversational recommendation. We model both long-term preferences and short-term preferences as latent variables with topical priors for explicit long-term and short-term preference exploration, respectively. We use an efficient stochastic gradient variational Bayesian (SGVB) estimator for optimizing the derived evidence lower bound. A policy network is then used to predict topics for a clarification utterance or items for a recommendation response. The use of explicit sequences of preferences with multi-hop reasoning in a heterogeneous knowledge graph helps to provide more accurate conversational recommendation results. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both objective and subjective evaluation metric|会话推荐系统(CRS)通过交互式对话提供推荐。CRS 通常通过相对简单的交互提供推荐，系统不断地查询用户的明确的属性感知偏好，然后决定推荐哪些项目。此外，主题跟踪通常用于提供听起来很自然的回答。但是，仅仅跟踪主题不足以识别用户在对话中的真实偏好。在本文中，我们解决了准确识别和维护用户偏好的问题。这个问题带来了三个挑战: (1)持续的对话只提供用户的短期反馈; (2)用户偏好的注释不可用; (3)对话中的项目之间可能存在复杂的语义关联。我们通过提出一种端到端的变分推理方法来解决这些挑战。我们将长期偏好和短期偏好分别建模为具有主题先验的潜在变量，用于显性长期和短期偏好探索。我们使用一个有效的随机梯度变分贝叶斯(SGVB)估计器来优化导出的证据下界。然后使用策略网络来预测澄清话语的主题或推荐响应的项目。在异构知识图中使用多跳推理的显式偏好序列有助于提供更准确的会话推荐结果。在两个基准数据集上进行的大量实验表明，我们提出的方法在客观和主观评价指标方面都优于最先进的基准|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Variational+Reasoning+about+User+Preferences+for+Conversational+Recommendation)|2|

However, building a human-like simulator is still an open challenge. In this work, we focus on how users reformulate their utterances when a conversational agent fails to understand them. First, we perform a user study, involving five conversational agents across different domains, to identify common reformulation types and their transition relationships. A common pattern that emerges is that persistent users would first try to rephrase, then simplify, before giving up. Next, to incorporate the observed reformulation behavior in a user simulator, we introduce the task of reformulation sequence generation: to generate a sequence of reformulated utterances with a given intent (rephrase or simplify). We develop methods by extending transformer models guided by the reformulation type and perform further filtering based on estimated reading difficulty.

|[Learning to Infer User Implicit Preference in Conversational Recommendation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531844)|Chenhao Hu, Shuhua Huang, Yansen Zhang, Yubao Liu|Sun Yat-Sen University & Guangdong Key Laboratory of Big Data Analysis and Processing, Guangzhou, China; Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China|Conversational recommender systems (CRS) enable traditional recommender systems to interact with users by asking questions about attributes and recommending items. The attribute-level and item-level feedback of users can be utilized to estimate users' preferences. However, existing works do not fully exploit the advantage of explicit item feedback --- they only use the item feedback in rather implicit ways such as updating the latent user and item representation. Since CRS has multiple chances to interact with users, leveraging the context in the conversation may help infer users' implicit feedback (e.g., some specific attributes) when recommendations get rejected. To address the limitations of existing methods, we propose a new CRS framework called Conversational Recommender with Implicit Feedback (CRIF). CRIF formulates the conversational recommendation scheme as a four-phase process consisting of offline representation learning, tracking, decision, and inference. In the inference module, by fully utilizing the relation between users' attribute-level and item-level feedback, our method can explicitly deduce users' implicit preferences. Therefore, CRIF is able to achieve more accurate user preference estimation. Besides, in the decision module, to better utilize the attribute-level and item-level feedback, we adopt inverse reinforcement learning to learn a flexible decision strategy that selects the suitable action at each conversation turn. Through extensive experiments on four benchmark CRS datasets, we validate the effectiveness of our approach, which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art CRS methods.|会话推荐系统(CRS)使得传统的推荐系统能够通过询问关于属性的问题和推荐项目与用户进行交互。用户的属性级反馈和项目级反馈可以用来估计用户的偏好。然而，现有的作品并没有充分利用显式项目反馈的优势——他们只是以相当隐式的方式使用项目反馈，比如更新潜在用户和项目表示。由于 CRS 有多个与用户交互的机会，当推荐被拒绝时，利用会话中的上下文可能有助于推断用户的隐式反馈(例如，一些特定的属性)。为了解决现有方法的局限性，我们提出了一个新的 CRS 框架，称为隐式反馈会话推荐(CRIF)。CRIF 将会话推荐方案设计为离线表征学习、跟踪、决策和推理四个阶段。在推理模块中，通过充分利用用户属性级反馈和项目级反馈之间的关系，可以明确推断出用户的隐性偏好。因此，CRIF 能够实现更准确的用户偏好估计。此外，在决策模块中，为了更好地利用属性级别和项目级别的反馈，我们采用逆向强化学习学习灵活的决策策略，在每次谈话转折点选择合适的行动。通过对四个基准 CRS 数据集的大量实验，我们验证了该方法的有效性，其性能明显优于目前最先进的 CRS 方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Learning+to+Infer+User+Implicit+Preference+in+Conversational+Recommendation)|2|

|[Probabilistic Permutation Graph Search: Black-Box Optimization for Fairness in Ranking](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3532045)|Ali Vardasbi, Fatemeh Sarvi, Maarten de Rijke|University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands|There are several measures for fairness in ranking, based on different underlying assumptions and perspectives. \acPL optimization with the REINFORCE algorithm can be used for optimizing black-box objective functions over permutations. In particular, it can be used for optimizing fairness measures. However, though effective for queries with a moderate number of repeating sessions, \acPL optimization has room for improvement for queries with a small number of repeating sessions. In this paper, we present a novel way of representing permutation distributions, based on the notion of permutation graphs. Similar to~\acPL, our distribution representation, called~\acPPG, can be used for black-box optimization of fairness. Different from~\acPL, where pointwise logits are used as the distribution parameters, in~\acPPG pairwise inversion probabilities together with a reference permutation construct the distribution. As such, the reference permutation can be set to the best sampled permutation regarding the objective function, making~\acPPG suitable for both deterministic and stochastic rankings. Our experiments show that~\acPPG, while comparable to~\acPL for larger session repetitions (i.e., stochastic ranking), improves over~\acPL for optimizing fairness metrics for queries with one session (i.e., deterministic ranking). Additionally, when accurate utility estimations are available, e.g., in tabular models, the performance of \acPPG in fairness optimization is significantly boosted compared to lower quality utility estimations from a learning to rank model, leading to a large performance gap with PL. Finally, the pairwise probabilities make it possible to impose pairwise constraints such as "item $d_1$ should always be ranked higher than item $d_2$.'' Such constraints can be used to simultaneously optimize the fairness metric and control another objective such as ranking performance.|根据不同的基本假设和观点，有几种衡量排名公平性的方法。使用 REINFORCE 算法的 acPL 优化可以用于优化黑盒目标函数。特别是可以用来优化公平性措施。然而，尽管对于具有中等数量重复会话的查询有效，但是对于具有少量重复会话的查询，acPL 优化还有改进的空间。本文基于置换图的概念，提出了一种表示置换分布的新方法。与 ~ acPL 类似，我们的分布表示(称为 ~ acPPG)可以用于公平性的黑盒优化。与以逐点对数作为分布参数的 ~ acPPG 不同，在 ~ acPPG 中成对反演概率与参考置换构成分布。因此，对于目标函数，可以将参考排序设置为最佳采样排序，使 ~ acPPG 既适用于确定性排序，也适用于随机排序。我们的实验表明 ~ acPPG 在较大的会话重复(即随机排名)方面与 ~ acPL 相当，但在优化一个会话查询(即确定性排名)的公平性指标方面优于 ~ acPL。此外，当准确的效用估计可用时，例如在表格模型中，acPPG 在公平优化中的表现显着提高，与来自学习到等级模型的较低质量效用估计相比，导致与 PL 的巨大性能差距。最后，成对概率使得可以施加成对约束，例如“项 $d _ 1 $应该总是排在项 $d _ 2 $之前”这种约束可以用来同时优化公平性度量和控制另一个目标，如排名性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Probabilistic+Permutation+Graph+Search:+Black-Box+Optimization+for+Fairness+in+Ranking)|2|

To unveil the effectiveness of GCNs for recommendation, we first analyze them in a spectral perspective and discover two important findings: (1) only a small portion of spectral graph features that emphasize the neighborhood smoothness and difference contribute to the recommendation accuracy, whereas most graph information can be considered as noise that even reduces the performance, and (2) repetition of the neighborhood aggregation emphasizes smoothed features and filters out noise information in an ineffective way. Based on the two findings above, we propose a new GCN learning scheme for recommendation by replacing neihgborhood aggregation with a simple yet effective Graph Denoising Encoder (GDE), which acts as a band pass filter to capture important graph features. We show that our proposed method alleviates the over-smoothing and is comparable to an indefinite-layer GCN that can take any-hop neighborhood into consideration. Finally, we dynamically adjust the gradients over the negative samples to expedite model training without introducing additional complexity. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets show that our proposed method not only outperforms state-of-the-arts but also achieves 12x speedup over LightGCN.|尽管图形卷积网络在推荐系统和协同过滤(CF)方面取得了巨大的成功，但其核心组件(textititi.e. 邻域聚合)对推荐的贡献机制还没有得到很好的研究。为了揭示 GCNs 在推荐中的有效性，我们首先从谱的角度分析它们，发现两个重要的结果: (1)只有一小部分强调邻域平滑和差异的谱图特征有助于推荐精度，而大多数图形信息可以被视为噪声，甚至降低性能; (2)重复的邻域聚合强调平滑的特征，并以无效的方式过滤掉噪声信息。基于以上两个发现，我们提出了一种新的 GCN 推荐学习方案，用一种简单而有效的图形去噪编码器(GDE)代替邻域聚合，GDE 作为带通滤波器来捕捉重要的图形特征。结果表明，我们提出的方法减轻了过度平滑，并可比拟一个不确定层 GCN，可以考虑任何跳邻居。最后，我们动态调整负样本上的梯度，以加快模型训练而不引入额外的复杂性。在五个真实世界数据集上的大量实验表明，我们提出的方法不仅优于最新技术，而且比 LightGCN 提高了12倍的速度。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Less+is+More:+Reweighting+Important+Spectral+Graph+Features+for+Recommendation)|2|

In fact, both tests only reflect part of the whole picture: factual interactions are collected from the recommendation policy, fitting them better implies benefiting the platform with higher click or conversion rate; in contrast, debiased test eliminates system-induced biases and thus is more reflective of user true preference. Nevertheless, we find that existing models exhibit trade-off on the two tests, and there lacks methods that perform well on both tests. In this work, we aim to develop a win-win recommendation method that is strong on both tests. It is non-trivial, since it requires to learn a model that can make accurate prediction in both factual environment (ie normal biased test) and counterfactual environment (ie debiased test). Towards the goal, we perform environment-aware recommendation modeling by considering both environments. In particular, we propose an Interpolative Distillation (InterD) framework, which interpolates the biased and debiased models at user-item pair level by distilling a student model. We conduct experiments on three real-world datasets with both tests.

Specifically, HIDE first constructs a hypergraph for each session to model the possible interest transitions from distinct perspectives. HIDE then disentangles the intents under each item click in micro and macro manners.

Embedding-based recommendation models provide recommendations by learning embeddings for each user and item from historical interactions. Therefore, such embedding-based models perform badly for cold items which haven't emerged in the training set. The most common solutions are to generate the cold embedding for the cold item from its content features. However, the cold embeddings generated from contents have different distribution as the warm embeddings are learned from historical interactions. In this case, current cold-start methods are facing an interesting seesaw phenomenon, which improves the recommendation of either the cold items or the warm items but hurts the opposite ones. To this end, we propose a general framework named Generative Adversarial Recommendation (GAR). By training the generator and the recommender adversarially, the generated cold item embeddings can have similar distribution as the warm embeddings that can even fool the recommender. Simultaneously, the recommender is fine-tuned to correctly rank the "fake'' warm embeddings and the real warm embeddings. Consequently, the recommendation of the warms and the colds will not influence each other, thus avoiding the seesaw phenomenon. Additionally, GAR could be applied to any off-the-shelf recommendation model. Experiments on two datasets present that GAR has strong overall recommendation performance in cold-starting both the CF-based model (improved by over 30.18%) and the GNN-based model (improved by over 17.78%).|冷启动问题一直是建议中的一个长期存在的问题。基于嵌入的推荐模型通过从历史交互中学习每个用户和项目的嵌入来提供推荐。因此，这种基于嵌入的模型对于训练集中没有出现的冷项目表现很差。最常见的解决方案是根据冷藏项目的内容特征生成冷藏嵌入。然而，由内容所产生的冷嵌体在历史互动中学习到的热嵌体，其分布是不同的。在这种情况下，目前的冷启动方法正面临着一个有趣的跷跷板现象，这改善了推荐的冷项目或温暖的项目，但伤害了相反的。为此，我们提出了一个名为生成对抗性建议(GAR)的通用框架。通过对生成器和推荐器进行对抗性训练，生成的冷嵌入项可以像暖嵌入项一样具有相似的分布，甚至可以欺骗推荐器。同时，对推荐进行微调，以正确排列“假的”暖嵌入和真正的暖嵌入。因此，建议的温暖和寒冷将不会相互影响，从而避免跷跷板现象。此外，GAR 可以应用于任何现成的推荐模型。在两个数据集上的实验表明，GAR 在冷启动基于 CF 的模型(改进超过30.18%)和基于 GNN 的模型(改进超过17.78%)方面具有很强的总体推荐性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Generative+Adversarial+Framework+for+Cold-Start+Item+Recommendation)|2|
|[Dynamics-Aware Adaptation for Reinforcement Learning Based Cross-Domain Interactive Recommendation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531969)|Junda Wu, Zhihui Xie, Tong Yu, Handong Zhao, Ruiyi Zhang, Shuai Li|New York University, New York, NY, USA; Adobe Research, San Jose, CA, USA; Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China|Interactive recommender systems (IRS) have received wide attention in recent years. To capture users' dynamic preferences and maximize their long-term engagement, IRS are usually formulated as reinforcement learning (RL) problems. Despite the promise to solve complex decision-making problems, RL-based methods generally require a large amount of online interaction, restricting their applications due to economic considerations. One possible direction to alleviate this issue is cross-domain recommendation that aims to leverage abundant logged interaction data from a source domain (e.g., adventure genre in movie recommendation) to improve the recommendation quality in the target domain (e.g., crime genre). Nevertheless, prior studies mostly focus on adapting the static representations of users/items. Few have explored how the temporally dynamic user-item interaction patterns transform across domains. Motivated by the above consideration, we propose DACIR, a novel Doubly-Adaptive deep RL-based framework for Cross-domain Interactive Recommendation. We first pinpoint how users behave differently in two domains and highlight the potential to leverage the shared user dynamics to boost IRS. To transfer static user preferences across domains, DACIR enforces consistency of item representation by aligning embeddings into a shared latent space. In addition, given the user dynamics in IRS, DACIR calibrates the dynamic interaction patterns in two domains via reward correlation. Once the double adaptation narrows the cross-domain gap, we are able to learn a transferable policy for the target recommender by leveraging logged data. Experiments on real-world datasets validate the superiority of our approach, which consistently achieves significant improvements over the baselines.|交互式推荐系统(IRS)近年来受到了广泛的关注。为了捕捉用户的动态偏好并最大化他们的长期参与，IRS 通常被定义为强化学习(RL)问题。尽管有望解决复杂的决策问题，但基于 RL 的方法通常需要大量的在线交互，出于经济考虑，限制了它们的应用。缓解这个问题的一个可能的方向是跨域推荐，旨在利用来自源域的大量日志交互数据(例如，电影推荐中的冒险类型)来提高目标域的推荐质量(例如，犯罪类型)。尽管如此，以往的研究主要集中在调整用户/项目的静态表征。很少有人研究过时态动态的用户项交互模式如何跨域转换。基于上述考虑，我们提出了一种新的基于双重自适应深度 RL 的跨域交互推荐框架 DACIR。我们首先精确地指出用户在两个领域中的不同行为，并强调利用共享用户动态来提高 IRS 的潜力。为了跨域传输静态用户首选项，DACIR 通过将嵌入对齐到共享的潜在空间来实现项表示的一致性。此外，给定 IRS 中的用户动态，DACIR 通过奖励相关校正两个域中的动态交互模式。一旦双重适应缩小了跨域间的差距，我们就能够通过利用已记录的数据为目标推荐程序学习一种可转移的策略。在实际数据集上的实验验证了该方法的优越性，在基线上取得了明显的改进。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Dynamics-Aware+Adaptation+for+Reinforcement+Learning+Based+Cross-Domain+Interactive+Recommendation)|2|

Resuming academic search tasks requires significant cognitive effort as searchers must re-acquaint themselves with previous search session activities and previously discovered documents before resuming their search. Further, some academic searchers may find it convenient to initiate such searches on their mobile devices during short gaps in time (e.g., between classes), and resume them later in a desktop environment when they can use the extra screen space and more convenient document storage capabilities of their computers. To support such searching, we have developed an academic digital library search interface that assists searchers in managing cross-session search tasks even when moving between mobile and desktop environments. Using a controlled laboratory study we compared our approach (Dilex) to a standard academic digital library search interface. We found increased user engagement in both the initial (mobile) and resumed (desktop) search activities, and that participants spent more time on the search results pages and had an increased degree of interaction with information and personalization features during the resumed tasks. These results provide evidence that the participants were able to make effective use of the visualization features in Dilex, which enabled them to readily resume their search tasks and stay engaged in the search activities. This work represents an example of how semi-automatic search task/session management and visualization features can support cross-session search, and how designing for both mobile and desktop use can support cross-device search.|学术数字图书馆的信息搜索本质上是复杂的，通常跨越多个搜索环节。恢复学术搜索任务需要大量的认知努力，因为搜索者必须在恢复搜索之前重新熟悉以前的搜索会话活动和以前发现的文档。此外，部分学术搜寻人士可能会觉得在短时间内(例如课间)在流动装置上进行这类搜寻比较方便，稍后当他们可以使用电脑额外的屏幕空间和更方便的文件储存功能时，便可在桌面环境中继续进行这类搜寻。为了支持这种搜索，我们开发了一个学术数字图书馆搜索界面，协助搜索人员管理跨会话搜索任务，即使在移动和桌面环境之间移动。使用一个受控的实验室研究，我们比较了我们的方法(Dilex)与标准的学术数字图书馆搜索界面。我们发现，用户在初始(移动)和恢复(桌面)搜索活动中的参与度都有所提高，参与者在搜索结果页面上花费的时间更多，在恢复任务期间与信息和个性化功能的交互程度也有所提高。这些结果证明参与者能够有效地利用 Dilex 的可视化功能，使他们能够随时恢复搜索任务并继续参与搜索活动。这项工作代表了一个半自动搜索任务/会话管理和可视化特性如何支持跨会话搜索的例子，以及如何设计为移动和桌面使用都可以支持跨设备搜索。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=A+Study+of+Cross-Session+Cross-Device+Search+Within+an+Academic+Digital+Library)|2|

McAuley, Weili Guan, Xiaojun Chang, Xianzhi Wang|Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia; University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA, USA; University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia; University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia|Online recommendation requires handling rapidly changing user preferences. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is an effective means of capturing users' dynamic interest during interactions with recommender systems. Generally, it is challenging to train a DRL agent in online recommender systems because of the sparse rewards caused by the large action space (e.g., candidate item space) and comparatively fewer user interactions. Leveraging experience replay (ER) has been extensively studied to conquer the issue of sparse rewards. However, they adapt poorly to the complex environment of online recommender systems and are inefficient in learning an optimal strategy from past experience. As a step to filling this gap, we propose a novel state-aware experience replay model, in which the agent selectively discovers the most relevant and salient experiences and is guided to find the optimal policy for online recommendations. In particular, a locality-sensitive hashing method is proposed to selectively retain the most meaningful experience at scale and a prioritized reward-driven strategy is designed to replay more valuable experiences with higher chance. We formally show that the proposed method guarantees the upper and lower bound on experience replay and optimizes the space complexity, as well as empirically demonstrate our model's superiority to several existing experience replay methods over three benchmark simulation platforms.|在线推荐需要处理快速变化的用户首选项。深度强化学习(DRL)是在与推荐系统交互时捕捉用户动态兴趣的有效手段。一般来说，在在线推荐系统中训练 DRL 代理是一个挑战，因为大的动作空间(例如候选项空间)和相对较少的用户交互造成了稀疏的奖励。杠杆经验重放(ER)已被广泛研究，以克服稀疏奖励的问题。然而，它们不能很好地适应在线推荐系统的复杂环境，并且在从过去的经验中学习最佳策略方面效率低下。作为填补这一空白的一个步骤，我们提出了一个新的状态感知经验重放模型，其中代理人选择性地发现最相关和突出的经验，并指导寻找最佳策略的在线推荐。特别是，一个局部性敏感哈希的方法被提出来选择性地保留大规模的最有意义的经验，一个优先奖励驱动的策略被设计来回放更有价值的经验和更高的机会。在三个基准仿真平台上，我们正式证明了该方法保证了经验重放的上下界，优化了空间复杂度，并且实证证明了该模型相对于现有的几种经验重放方法的优越性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Locality-Sensitive+State-Guided+Experience+Replay+Optimization+for+Sparse+Rewards+in+Online+Recommendation)|2|

Previous SBR models, which rely only on the limited short-term transition information without utilizing extra valuable knowledge, have suffered a lot from the problem of data sparsity. This paper proposes a novel mirror graph enhanced neural model for session-based recommendation (MGS), to exploit item attribute information over item embeddings for more accurate preference estimation. Specifically, MGS utilizes two kinds of graphs to learn item representations. One is a session graph generated from the user interaction sequence describing users' preference based on transition patterns. Another is a mirror graph built by an attribute-aware module that selects the most attribute-representative information for each session item by integrating items' attribute information. We applied an iterative dual refinement mechanism to propagate information between the session and mirror graphs. To further guide the training process of the attribute-aware module, we also introduce a contrastive learning strategy that compares two mirror graphs generated for the same session by randomly sampling the attribute-same neighbors. Experiments on three real-world datasets exhibit that the performance of MGS surpasses many state-of-the-art models.|基于会话(Session-based)的推荐(SBR)旨在基于一个匿名但很短的交互序列来预测用户的下一个点击项目。以往的 SBR 模型仅仅依赖于有限的短期转换信息，而没有利用额外的有价值的知识，已经遭受了很多数据稀疏的问题。提出了一种新的基于会话推荐(MGS)的镜像图增强神经网络模型，利用项目属性信息对项目嵌入进行更精确的偏好估计。具体来说，MGS 利用两种图来学习项目表示。一个是由用户交互序列生成的会话图，描述基于转换模式的用户偏好。另一个是由属性感知模块构建的镜像图，该模块通过集成会话项的属性信息来为每个会话项选择最具代表性的属性信息。我们应用一个迭代对偶精化机制来传播会话和镜像图之间的信息。为了进一步指导属性感知模块的训练过程，我们还引入了一种对比学习策略，通过对属性相同的邻居进行随机抽样，比较同一会话中生成的两个镜像图。在三个实际数据集上的实验表明，MGS 的性能优于许多最先进的模型。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=An+Attribute-Driven+Mirror+Graph+Network+for+Session-based+Recommendation)|2|

Existing methods usually first encode user's clicked news into news embeddings independently and then aggregate them into user embedding. However, the word-level interactions across different clicked news from the same user, which contain rich detailed clues to infer user interest, are ignored by these methods. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained and fast user modeling framework (FUM) to model user interest from fine-grained behavior interactions for news recommendation. The core idea of FUM is to concatenate the clicked news into a long document and transform user modeling into a document modeling task with both intra-news and inter-news word-level interactions. Since vanilla transformer cannot efficiently handle long document, we apply an efficient transformer named Fastformer to model fine-grained behavior interactions. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets verify that FUM can effectively and efficiently model user interest for news recommendation.|用户建模对新闻推荐非常重要。现有方法通常首先将用户点击新闻独立编码为新闻嵌入，然后将其聚合为用户嵌入。但是，这些方法忽略了来自同一用户的不同点击新闻之间的词级交互，这些新闻包含丰富的细节线索来推断用户的兴趣。在本文中，我们提出了一个细粒度和快速的用户建模框架(FUM)来模型用户的兴趣从细粒度的行为交互的新闻推荐。FUM 的核心思想是将点击的新闻连接到一个长文档中，并将用户建模转换为具有内部新闻和内部新闻字级交互的文档建模任务。由于普通的转换器不能有效地处理长文档，因此我们应用一个名为 Fastformer 的高效转换器来对细粒度的行为交互进行建模。在两个实际数据集上的大量实验证明，FUM 可以有效地为新闻推荐建立用户兴趣模型。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=FUM:+Fine-grained+and+Fast+User+Modeling+for+News+Recommendation)|2|

A fairness-aware recommender system aims to treat different user groups similarly. Relevant work on user-oriented fairness highlights the discriminant behavior of fairness-unaware recommendation algorithms towards a certain user group, defined based on users' activity level. Typical solutions include proposing a user-centered fairness re-ranking framework applied on top of a base ranking model to mitigate its unfair behavior towards a certain user group i.e., disadvantaged group. In this paper, we re-produce a user-oriented fairness study and provide extensive experiments to analyze the dependency of their proposed method on various fairness and recommendation aspects, including the recommendation domain, nature of the base ranking model, and user grouping method. Moreover, we evaluate the final recommendations provided by the re-ranking framework from both user- (e.g., NDCG, user-fairness) and item-side (e.g., novelty, item-fairness) metrics. We discover interesting trends and trade-offs between the model's performance in terms of different evaluation metrics. For instance, we see that the definition of the advantaged/disadvantaged user groups plays a crucial role in the effectiveness of the fairness algorithm and how it improves the performance of specific base ranking models. Finally, we highlight some important open challenges and future directions in this field.

Existing CF approaches usually model interactions solely within the Euclidean space. However, the sophisticated user-item interactions inherently present highly non-Euclidean anatomy with various types of geometric patterns (i.e., tree-likeness and cyclic structures). The Euclidean-based models may be inadequate to fully uncover the intent factors beneath such hybrid-geometry interactions. To remedy this deficiency, in this paper, we study the novel problem of Geometric Disentangled Collaborative Filtering (GDCF), which aims to reveal and disentangle the latent intent factors across multiple geometric spaces. A novel generative GDCF model is proposed to learn geometric disentangled representations by inferring the high-level concepts associated with user intentions and various geometries.

However, existing methods mainly based on static knowledge bases are difficult to find descriptions for many queries because of the lack of entities within these queries and their corresponding items. For such a query, it is unable to generate an informative question. To alleviate this problem, we propose leveraging top search results of the query to help generate better descriptions because we deem that the top retrieved documents contain rich and relevant contexts of the query. Specifically, we first design a rule-based algorithm to extract description candidates from search results and rank them by various human-designed features. Then, we apply an learning-to-rank model and another generative model for generalization and further improve the quality of clarifying questions.

Many methods model feature interaction to improve their performance. However, most methods only learn a fixed representation for each feature without considering the varying importance of each feature under different contexts, resulting in inferior performance. Recently, several methods tried to learn vector-level weights for feature representations to address the fixed representation issue. However, they only produce linear transformations to refine the fixed feature representations, which are still not flexible enough to capture the varying importance of each feature under different contexts. In this paper, we propose a novel module named Feature Refinement Network (FRNet), which learns context-aware feature representations at bit-level for each feature in different contexts. FRNet consists of two key components: 1) Information Extraction Unit (IEU), which captures contextual information and cross-feature relationships to guide context-aware feature refinement; and 2) Complementary Selection Gate (CSGate), which adaptively integrates the original and complementary feature representations learned in IEU with bit-level weights. Notably, FRNet is orthogonal to existing CTR methods and thus can be applied in many existing methods to boost their performance. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness, efficiency, and compatibility of FRNet.|CTR 预测在现实世界中得到了广泛的应用。许多方法对特征交互进行建模以提高其性能。然而，大多数方法只学习每个特征的固定表示，而不考虑每个特征在不同环境下的不同重要性，导致性能较差。最近，一些方法尝试学习特征表示的矢量级权重，以解决固定表示问题。然而，它们仅仅产生线性变换来细化固定特征表示，这些线性变换仍然不够灵活，不足以捕获不同上下文环境下每个特征的不同重要性。本文提出了一种新颖的特征精化网络(FRNet)模型，该模型能够在不同的上下文环境下对每个特征进行位级的上下文感知特征表示。FRNet 由两个关键组成部分组成: 1)信息抽取单元(IEU) ，它捕获上下文信息和跨特征关系，以指导上下文感知特征细化; 2)补充选择门(CSGate) ，它自适应地将在 IEU 中学到的原始和补充特征表示与位级权重结合起来。值得注意的是，FRNet 与现有的 CTR 方法是正交的，因此可以应用在许多现有的方法中来提高它们的性能。通过综合实验验证了 FRNet 的有效性、高效性和兼容性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Enhancing+CTR+Prediction+with+Context-Aware+Feature+Representation+Learning)|2|

The problem of how individual or groups of items may be systemically under or over exposed to groups of users, or even all users, has received relatively less attention. However, such systemic disparities in information exposure can result in observable social harms, such as withholding economic opportunities from historically marginalized groups (allocative harm) or amplifying gendered and racialized stereotypes (representational harm). Previously, Diaz et al. developed the expected exposure metric---that incorporates existing user browsing models that have previously been developed for information retrieval---to study fairness of content exposure to individual users. We extend their proposed framework to formalize a family of exposure fairness metrics that model the problem jointly from the perspective of both the consumers and producers. Specifically, we consider group attributes for both types of stakeholders to identify and mitigate fairness concerns that go beyond individual users and items towards more systemic biases in recommendation. Furthermore, we study and discuss the relationships between the different exposure fairness dimensions proposed in this paper, as well as demonstrate how stochastic ranking policies can be optimized towards said fairness goals.|以往关于推荐系统中曝光公平性的研究主要侧重于系统个别用户对个别或组别项目的曝光方面的差异。个人或项目组如何可能系统地暴露于一组用户甚至所有用户之下或过度暴露于这些用户之下的问题，受到的关注相对较少。然而，这种信息暴露的系统性差异可能导致可观察到的社会危害，如阻止历史上被边缘化的群体获得经济机会(分配伤害)或放大性别和种族化的刻板印象(代表性伤害)。此前，迪亚兹等人开发了预期的曝光度量标准——该标准结合了以前为信息检索开发的现有用户浏览模型——以研究内容曝光对个人用户的公平性。我们扩展了他们提出的框架，从消费者和生产者的角度建立了一系列的暴露公平度量模型。具体来说，我们考虑两种类型的利益相关者的群体属性，以确定和减轻超越个人用户和项目的建议中更系统的偏见的公平性问题。此外，我们还研究和讨论了本文提出的不同暴露公平维度之间的关系，并论证了随机排序策略是如何朝着公平目标进行优化的。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Joint+Multisided+Exposure+Fairness+for+Recommendation)|2|

Therefore, in this work, we introduce a novel contrastive span prediction task to pre-train the encoder alone, but still retain the bottleneck ability of the autoencoder. In this way, we can 1) learn discriminative text representations efficiently with the group-wise contrastive learning over spans and, 2) avoid the bypass effect of the decoder thoroughly.

|[CenterCLIP: Token Clustering for Efficient Text-Video Retrieval](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531950)|Shuai Zhao, Linchao Zhu, Xiaohan Wang, Yi Yang|Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia|Recently, large-scale pre-training methods like CLIP have made great progress in multi-modal research such as text-video retrieval. In CLIP, transformers are vital for modeling complex multi-modal relations. However, in the vision transformer of CLIP, the essential visual tokenization process, which produces discrete visual token sequences, generates many homogeneous tokens due to the redundancy nature of consecutive and similar frames in videos. This significantly increases computation costs and hinders the deployment of video retrieval models in web applications. In this paper, to reduce the number of redundant video tokens, we design a multi-segment token clustering algorithm to find the most representative tokens and drop the non-essential ones. As the frame redundancy occurs mostly in consecutive frames, we divide videos into multiple segments and conduct segment-level clustering. Center tokens from each segment are later concatenated into a new sequence, while their original spatial-temporal relations are well maintained. We instantiate two clustering algorithms to efficiently find deterministic medoids and iteratively partition groups in high dimensional space. Through this token clustering and center selection procedure, we successfully reduce computation costs by removing redundant visual tokens.

|[ProFairRec: Provider Fairness-aware News Recommendation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3532046)|Tao Qi, Fangzhao Wu, Chuhan Wu, Peijie Sun, Le Wu, Xiting Wang, Yongfeng Huang, Xing Xie|Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China; Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China; Tsinghua University, Beijing, China|News recommendation aims to help online news platform users find their preferred news articles. Existing news recommendation methods usually learn models from historical user behaviors on news. However, these behaviors are usually biased on news providers. Models trained on biased user data may capture and even amplify the biases on news providers, and are unfair for some minority news providers. In this paper, we propose a provider fairness-aware news recommendation framework (named ProFairRec), which can learn news recommendation models fair for different news providers from biased user data. The core idea of ProFairRec is to learn provider-fair news representations and provider-fair user representations to achieve provider fairness. To learn provider-fair representations from biased data, we employ provider-biased representations to inherit provider bias from data. Provider-fair and -biased news representations are learned from news content and provider IDs respectively, which are further aggregated to build fair and biased user representations based on user click history. All of these representations are used in model training while only fair representations are used for user-news matching to achieve fair news recommendation. Besides, we propose an adversarial learning task on news provider discrimination to prevent provider-fair news representation from encoding provider bias. We also propose an orthogonal regularization on provider-fair and -biased representations to better reduce provider bias in provider-fair representations. Moreover, ProFairRec is a general framework and can be applied to different news recommendation methods. Extensive experiments on a public dataset verify that our ProFairRec approach can effectively improve the provider fairness of many existing methods and meanwhile maintain their recommendation accuracy.|新闻推荐旨在帮助在线新闻平台用户找到他们喜欢的新闻文章。现有的新闻推荐方法通常借鉴新闻历史用户行为的模型。然而，这些行为通常对新闻提供者有偏见。对有偏见的用户数据进行培训的模式可能捕捉甚至放大对新闻提供者的偏见，这对一些少数群体的新闻提供者是不公平的。本文提出了一个提供者公平感知的新闻推荐框架(ProFairRec) ，该框架可以从有偏差的用户数据中学习不同新闻提供者的新闻推荐模型。ProFairRec 的核心思想是通过学习提供者-公平新闻表示和提供者-公平用户表示来实现提供者公平。为了从有偏差的数据中学习提供者公平表示，我们使用提供者偏好表示从数据中继承提供者偏好。分别从新闻内容和提供者 ID 中学习提供者公平和有偏见的新闻表示，并进一步聚合它们，构建基于用户点击历史的公平和有偏见的用户表示。所有这些表示都用于模型训练，只有公平表示用于用户新闻匹配以实现公平新闻推荐。此外，我们提出了一个关于新闻提供者歧视的对抗性学习任务，以防止提供者-公平的新闻表征对提供者偏见进行编码。我们还提出了一个正交正则化的提供者公平和偏见的表示，以更好地减少提供者偏见提供者公平的表示。此外，ProFairRec 是一个通用框架，可以应用于不同的新闻推荐方法。在一个公共数据集上的大量实验证明，我们的 ProFairRec 方法能够有效地提高许多现有方法的提供者公平性，同时保持它们的推荐准确性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=ProFairRec:+Provider+Fairness-aware+News+Recommendation)|2|

As reinforcement learning (RL) naturally fits this objective---maximizing an user's reward per session---it has become an emerging topic in recommender systems. Developing RL-based recommendation methods, however, is not trivial due to the offline training challenge. Specifically, the keystone of traditional RL is to train an agent with large amounts of online exploration making lots of 'errors' in the process. In the recommendation setting, though, we cannot afford the price of making 'errors' online. As a result, the agent needs to be trained through offline historical implicit feedback, collected under different recommendation policies; traditional RL algorithms may lead to sub-optimal policies under these offline training settings. Here we propose a new learning paradigm---namely Prompt-Based Reinforcement Learning (PRL)---for the offline training of RL-based recommendation agents. While traditional RL algorithms attempt to map state-action input pairs to their expected rewards (e.g., Q-values), PRL directly infers actions (i.e., recommended items) from state-reward inputs. In short, the agents are trained to predict a recommended item given the prior interactions and an observed reward value---with simple supervised learning. At deployment time, this historical (training) data acts as a knowledge base, while the state-reward pairs are used as a prompt. The agents are thus used to answer the question: Which item should be recommended given the prior interactions & the prompted reward value? We implement PRL with four notable recommendation models and conduct experiments on two real-world e-commerce datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed methods.|现代推荐系统旨在改善用户体验。由于强化学习(rL)自然符合这一目标——最大化用户每次会话的回报——它已经成为推荐系统中一个新兴的话题。然而，由于离线培训的挑战，开发基于 RL 的推荐方法并非易事。具体来说，传统 RL 的核心是训练一个具有大量在线探索并在过程中犯下大量“错误”的代理。然而，在推荐设置中，我们承担不起在网上犯“错误”的代价。因此，代理需要通过在不同推荐策略下收集的离线历史隐式反馈进行训练; 传统的 RL 算法在这些离线训练设置下可能导致策略次优。在这里，我们提出了一个新的学习范式——即基于提示的强化学习(PRL)——用于基于提示的推荐代理的离线培训。传统的 RL 算法试图将状态-动作输入对映射到它们的预期奖励(例如，Q 值) ，而 PRL 直接从状态-奖励输入推断动作(例如，推荐项)。简而言之，经纪人接受训练，根据之前的互动和观察到的奖励价值，预测一个推荐的项目——用简单的监督式学习。在部署时，这个历史(培训)数据充当知识库，而状态-奖励对用作提示符。因此，代理人被用来回答这个问题: 鉴于之前的互动和提示的奖励价值，应该推荐哪个项目？我们使用四个值得注意的推荐模型来实现 PRL，并在两个真实的电子商务数据集上进行了实验。实验结果表明，该方法具有良好的性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Rethinking+Reinforcement+Learning+for+Recommendation:+A+Prompt+Perspective)|2|

It refers to a knowledge fact that appears causal to the user behaviors (inferred by the recommender) but is not in fact. For tackling this issue, we present a novel approach to discovering and alleviating the potential spurious correlations from a counterfactual perspective. To be specific, our approach consists of two counterfactual generators and a recommender. The counterfactual generators are designed to generate counterfactual interactions via reinforcement learning, while the recommender is implemented with two different graph neural networks to aggregate the information from KG and user-item interactions respectively. The counterfactual generators and recommender are integrated in a mutually collaborative way. With this approach, the recommender helps the counterfactual generators better identify potential spurious correlations and generate high-quality counterfactual interactions, while the counterfactual generators help the recommender weaken the influence of the potential spurious correlations simultaneously. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets have shown the effectiveness of the proposed approach by comparing it with a number of competitive baselines.

A recent technical trend is to design end-to-end models based on the information propagation schemes. However, existing propagation-based methods fail to (1) model the underlying hierarchical structures and relations, and (2) capture the high-order collaborative signals of items for learning high-quality user and item representations. In this paper, we propose a new model, called Hierarchy-Aware Knowledge Gated Network (HAKG), to tackle the aforementioned problems. Technically, we model users and items (that are captured by a user-item graph), as well as entities and relations (that are captured in a KG) in hyperbolic space, and design a new hyperbolic aggregation scheme to gather relational contexts over KG. Meanwhile, we introduce a novel angle constraint to preserve characteristics of items in the embedding space. Furthermore, we propose the dual item embeddings design to represent and propagate collaborative signals and knowledge associations separately, and leverage the gated aggregation to distill discriminative information for better capturing user behavior patterns. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that, HAKG achieves significant improvement over the state-of-the-art methods like CKAN, Hyper-Know, and KGIN. Further analyses on the learned hyperbolic embeddings confirm that HAKG can offer meaningful insights into the hierarchies of data.|知识图(KG)在提高推荐性能和可解释性方面发挥着越来越重要的作用。基于信息传播方案的端到端模型设计是近年来的一个技术趋势。然而，现有的基于传播的方法无法(1)对底层的层次结构和关系进行建模，(2)捕获项目的高阶协作信号来学习高质量的用户和项目表示。本文提出了一种新的层次感知知识门限网络(HAKG)模型来解决上述问题。从技术上讲，我们对用户和项目(通过用户项目图捕获)以及实体和关系(通过 KG 捕获)进行双曲空间建模，并设计一个新的双曲线聚合方案，通过 KG 收集关系上下文。同时，我们引入了一种新的角度约束来保持嵌入空间中项目的特征。此外，我们提出了双项嵌入设计，分别表示和传播协作信号和知识关联，并利用门限聚合提取区分信息，以更好地捕捉用户行为模式。在三个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，HAKG 比最先进的 CKAN、 Hyper-Know 和 KGIN 方法有明显的改进。进一步分析学习双曲嵌入，证实 HAKG 可以提供有意义的洞察数据层次。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=HAKG:+Hierarchy-Aware+Knowledge+Gated+Network+for+Recommendation)|2|

Recent research even claims that BERT is able to capture factual knowledge about entity relations and properties, the information that is commonly obtained from knowledge graphs. This paper investigates the following question: Do BERT-based entity retrieval models benefit from additional entity information stored in knowledge graphs? To address this research question, we map entity embeddings into the same input space as a pre-trained BERT model and inject these entity embeddings into the BERT model. This entity-enriched language model is then employed on the entity retrieval task. We show that the entity-enriched BERT model improves effectiveness on entity-oriented queries over a regular BERT model, establishing a new state-of-the-art result for the entity retrieval task, with substantial improvements for complex natural language queries and queries requesting a list of entities with a certain property. Additionally, we show that the entity information provided by our entity-enriched model particularly helps queries related to less popular entities. Last, we observe empirically that the entity-enriched BERT models enable fine-tuning on limited training data, which otherwise would not be feasible due to the known instabilities of BERT in few-sample fine-tuning, thereby contributing to data-efficient training of BERT for entity search.|在自然语言处理以及最近的信息检索中，像 BERT 这样经过预先训练的语言模型已经成为在各种任务中取得最先进结果的关键因素。最近的研究甚至声称 BERT 能够捕获关于实体关系和属性的实际知识，这些信息通常是从知识图表中获得的。本文研究了以下问题: 基于 BERT 的实体检索模型是否受益于存储在知识图中的附加实体信息？为了解决这个问题，我们将实体嵌入映射到与预先训练的 BERT 模型相同的输入空间中，并将这些实体嵌入注入到 BERT 模型中。然后将这种实体丰富的语言模型应用于实体检索任务。实验结果表明，与常规的 BERT 模型相比，实体增强的 BERT 模型提高了面向实体查询的效率，为实体检索任务建立了一个新的最先进的结果，对于复杂的自然语言查询和请求具有特定属性的实体列表的查询有了实质性的改进。此外，我们还展示了实体丰富模型提供的实体信息特别有助于与不太流行的实体相关的查询。最后，我们实验观察到实体增强的 BERT 模型能够对有限的训练数据进行微调，否则由于已知的 BERT 在少样本微调中的不稳定性，这是不可行的，从而有助于为实体搜索进行数据有效的 BERT 训练。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Entity-aware+Transformers+for+Entity+Search)|2|
|[CharacterBERT and Self-Teaching for Improving the Robustness of Dense Retrievers on Queries with Typos](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531951)|Shengyao Zhuang, Guido Zuccon|The University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia|Current dense retrievers are not robust to out-of-domain and outlier queries, i.e. their effectiveness on these queries is much poorer than what one would expect. In this paper, we consider a specific instance of such queries: queries that contain typos. We show that a small character level perturbation in queries (as caused by typos) highly impacts the effectiveness of dense retrievers. We then demonstrate that the root cause of this resides in the input tokenization strategy employed by BERT. In BERT, tokenization is performed using the BERT's WordPiece tokenizer and we show that a token with a typo will significantly change the token distributions obtained after tokenization. This distribution change translates to changes in the input embeddings passed to the BERT-based query encoder of dense retrievers. We then turn our attention to devising dense retriever methods that are robust to such queries with typos, while still being as performant as previous methods on queries without typos. For this, we use CharacterBERT as the backbone encoder and an efficient yet effective training method, called Self-Teaching (ST), that distills knowledge from queries without typos into the queries with typos. Experimental results show that CharacterBERT in combination with ST achieves significantly higher effectiveness on queries with typos compared to previous methods. Along with these results and the open-sourced implementation of the methods, we also provide a new passage retrieval dataset consisting of real-world queries with typos and associated relevance assessments on the MS MARCO corpus, thus supporting the research community in the investigation of effective and robust dense retrievers.

In group recommendation, the core is to design preference aggregation functions to obtain a quality summary of all group members' preferences. Such user and group preferences are commonly represented as points in the vector space (i.e., embeddings), where multiple user embeddings are compressed into one to facilitate ranking for group-item pairs. However, the resulted group representations, as points, lack adequate flexibility and capacity to account for the multi-faceted user preferences. Also, the point embedding-based preference aggregation is a less faithful reflection of a group's decision-making process, where all users have to agree on a certain value in each embedding dimension instead of a negotiable interval. In this paper, we propose a novel representation of groups via the notion of hypercubes, which are subspaces containing innumerable points in the vector space. Specifically, we design the hypercube recommender (CubeRec) to adaptively learn group hypercubes from user embeddings with minimal information loss during preference aggregation, and to leverage a revamped distance metric to measure the affinity between group hypercubes and item points. Moreover, to counteract the long-standing issue of data sparsity in group recommendation, we make full use of the geometric expressiveness of hypercubes and innovatively incorporate self-supervision by intersecting two groups. Experiments on four real-world datasets have validated the superiority of CubeRec over state-of-the-art baselines.|作为超越传统个性化推荐的一个步骤，群体推荐的任务是推荐能够满足一组用户的项目。在群组推荐中，核心是设计偏好聚合函数，以获得群组成员偏好的高质量汇总。这样的用户和组首选项通常表示为向量空间中的点(即嵌入) ，其中多个用户嵌入被压缩为一个，以便于对组-项目对进行排序。然而，由此产生的群体表示，作为点，缺乏足够的灵活性和能力来说明多方面的用户偏好。另外，基于点嵌入的偏好聚合是群体决策过程的一种不那么忠实的反映，即所有用户都必须在每个嵌入维度上同意一个确定的值，而不是一个可协商的区间。本文利用超立方体的概念，提出了一种新的群表示方法，超立方体是向量空间中包含无数个点的子空间。具体来说，我们设计了超立方体推荐器(CubeRec)来自适应地从用户嵌入中学习组超立方体，在偏好聚合过程中以最小的信息损失，并利用改进的距离度量来度量组超立方体和项目点之间的亲和力。此外，为了解决群体推荐中长期存在的数据稀疏问题，我们充分利用了超立方体的几何表达能力，创新性地将自我监督融入到群体推荐中。在四个实际数据集上的实验验证了 CubeRec 相对于最先进的基线的优越性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Thinking+inside+The+Box:+Learning+Hypercube+Representations+for+Group+Recommendation)|2|

Engagements in these platforms are facilitated by multi-modal recommendation systems. Indeed, such multimedia content can involve diverse modalities, often represented as visual, acoustic, and textual features to the recommender model. Existing works in micro-video recommendation tend to unify the multi-modal channels, thereby treating each modality with equal importance. However, we argue that these approaches are not sufficient to encode item representations with multiple modalities, since the used methods cannot fully disentangle the users' tastes on different modalities. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel learning method named Multi-Modal Graph Contrastive Learning (MMGCL), which aims to explicitly enhance multi-modal representation learning in a self-supervised learning manner. In particular, we devise two augmentation techniques to generate the multiple views of a user/item: modality edge dropout and modality masking. Furthermore, we introduce a novel negative sampling technique that allows to learn the correlation between modalities and ensures the effective contribution of each modality. Extensive experiments conducted on two micro-video datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed MMGCL method over existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both recommendation performance and training convergence speed.|最近，微视频在 TikTok 和 Instagram 等社交媒体平台上变得越来越流行。多模式推荐系统促进了这些平台的参与。事实上，这样的多媒体内容可以涉及不同的形式，通常表示为视觉，声学和文本特征的推荐模型。现有的微视频推荐作品倾向于统一多通道，从而对各种通道给予同等重视。然而，我们认为这些方法不足以用多种模式来编码项目表示，因为所使用的方法不能完全区分使用者对不同模式的喜好。为了解决这一问题，我们提出了一种新的学习方法——多模态图形对比学习(MMGCL) ，该方法旨在以自监督学习的方式明确地增强多模态表示学习。特别地，我们设计了两种增强技术来产生一个用户/项目的多视图: 模态边缘丢失和模态掩蔽。此外，我们还引入了一种新颖的负抽样技术，它可以学习模式之间的相关性，并确保每种模式的有效贡献。在两个微视频数据集上进行的大量实验表明，我们提出的 MMGCL 方法在推荐性能和训练收敛速度方面都优于现有的最新方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Multi-modal+Graph+Contrastive+Learning+for+Micro-video+Recommendation)|2|

In this paper, we investigate whether neural rankers introduce retrieval effectiveness (performance) disparities over queries related to different genders. We specifically study whether there are significant performance differences between male and female queries when retrieved by neural rankers. Through our empirical study over the MS MARCO collection, we find that such performance disparities are notable and that the performance disparities may be due to the difference between how queries and their relevant judgements are collected and distributed for different gendered queries. More specifically, we observe that male queries are more closely associated with their relevant documents compared to female queries and hence neural rankers are able to more easily learn associations between male queries and their relevant documents. We show that it is possible to systematically balance relevance judgment collections in order to reduce performance disparity between different gendered queries without negatively compromising overall model performance.|虽然神经系统排名在各种信息检索任务中表现显著，但最近的研究表明，这种排名可能会加剧某些刻板的偏见。在本文中，我们研究了神经排序器是否引入检索效率(性能)差异相关的查询不同性别。我们专门研究是否有显着性能差异的男性和女性查询时，检索的神经排序。通过对 MS MARCO 集合的实证研究，我们发现这种性能差异是显著的，性能差异可能是由于不同性别的查询如何收集和分配查询及其相关判断之间的差异造成的。更具体地说，我们观察到，与女性查询相比，男性查询与其相关文档关联更密切，因此神经排序器能够更容易地学习男性查询与其相关文档之间的关联。我们表明，系统地平衡相关性判断集合是可能的，以减少不同性别查询之间的性能差异，而不会对整体模型性能造成负面影响。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Addressing+Gender-related+Performance+Disparities+in+Neural+Rankers)|2|

|[Fairness of Exposure in Light of Incomplete Exposure Estimation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531977)|Maria Heuss, Fatemeh Sarvi, Maarten de Rijke|AIRLab & University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam , Netherlands; University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands|Fairness of exposure is a commonly used notion of fairness for ranking systems. It is based on the idea that all items or item groups should get exposure proportional to the merit of the item or the collective merit of the items in the group. Often, stochastic ranking policies are used to ensure fairness of exposure. Previous work unrealistically assumes that we can reliably estimate the expected exposure for all items in each ranking produced by the stochastic policy. In this work, we discuss how to approach fairness of exposure in cases where the policy contains rankings of which, due to inter-item dependencies, we cannot reliably estimate the exposure distribution. In such cases, we cannot determine whether the policy can be considered fair. % Our contributions in this paper are twofold. First, we define a method called \method for finding stochastic policies that avoid showing rankings with unknown exposure distribution to the user without having to compromise user utility or item fairness. Second, we extend the study of fairness of exposure to the top-k setting and also assess \method in this setting. We find that \method can significantly reduce the number of rankings with unknown exposure distribution without a drop in user utility or fairness compared to existing fair ranking methods, both for full-length and top-k rankings. This is an important first step in developing fair ranking methods for cases where we have incomplete knowledge about the user's behaviour.|曝光公平是排名系统中常用的公平概念。它是基于这样的想法，即所有项目或项目组应获得与项目的价值或集体价值的项目组成比例的曝光。通常，随机排序策略用于确保公平的曝光。以往的工作不切实际地假设我们可以可靠地估计所有项目的预期风险在每个排名所产生的随机政策。在这项工作中，我们讨论了如何接近公平的情况下，政策包含排名，由于项目间的相关性，我们不能可靠地估计曝光分布。在这种情况下，我们无法确定这项政策是否公平。% 我们在这篇论文中的贡献是双重的。首先，我们定义了一种方法，叫做随机策略发现方法，避免显示排名与未知的暴露分布给用户，而不必妥协用户效用或项目的公平性。其次，我们将公平性的研究扩展到 Top-k 环境，并在此环境下进行了评价方法的探讨。我们发现，与现有的公平排名方法相比，该方法可以显著减少未知曝光分布的排名数量，而不会降低用户效用或公平性，无论是全长排名还是前 K 排名。对于我们不完全了解用户行为的情况，这是开发公平排名方法的重要第一步。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Fairness+of+Exposure+in+Light+of+Incomplete+Exposure+Estimation)|2|

The main challenge of this task comes two-fold: few-shot learning resulting from the varying targets and the lack of contextual information of the targets. Existing works mainly focus on solving the second issue by designing attention-based models or introducing noisy external knowledge, while the first issue remains under-explored. In this paper, inspired by the potential capability of pre-trained language models (PLMs) serving as knowledge bases and few-shot learners, we propose to introduce prompt-based fine-tuning for stance detection. PLMs can provide essential contextual information for the targets and enable few-shot learning via prompts. Considering the crucial role of the target in stance detection task, we design target-aware prompts and propose a novel verbalizer. Instead of mapping each label to a concrete word, our verbalizer maps each label to a vector and picks the label that best captures the correlation between the stance and the target. Moreover, to alleviate the possible defect of dealing with varying targets with a single hand-crafted prompt, we propose to distill the information learned from multiple prompts. Experimental results show the superior performance of our proposed model in both full-data and few-shot scenarios.|立场检测的目的是确定文本的作者是否赞成、反对或中立给定的目标。这项任务的主要挑战来自两个方面: 由于目标的不同和缺乏目标的上下文信息导致的少量学习。现有的研究主要集中在通过设计基于注意的模型或引入噪声外部知识来解决第二个问题，而第一个问题仍然没有得到充分的研究。本文受预训练语言模型(PLM)作为知识库和少镜头学习者的潜在能力的启发，提出了一种基于提示的姿态检测微调方法。PLM 可以为目标提供必要的上下文信息，并通过提示实现少量学习。考虑到目标在姿态检测任务中的重要作用，本文设计了目标感知提示，并提出了一种新的语言表达方法。代替将每个标签映射到一个具体的单词，我们的语言表达器将每个标签映射到一个向量，并选择最好地捕获立场和目标之间相关性的标签。此外，为了减少单一手工提示处理不同目标的可能缺陷，我们建议提取从多个提示中学到的信息。实验结果表明，该模型在全数据场景和少镜头场景下均具有良好的性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Few-Shot+Stance+Detection+via+Target-Aware+Prompt+Distillation)|2|

Abdelzaher||This paper develops a novel unsupervised algorithm for belief representation learning in polarized networks that (i) uncovers the latent dimensions of the underlying belief space and (ii) jointly embeds users and content items (that they interact with) into that space in a manner that facilitates a number of downstream tasks, such as stance detection, stance prediction, and ideology mapping. Inspired by total correlation in information theory, we propose the Information-Theoretic Variational Graph Auto-Encoder (InfoVGAE) that learns to project both users and content items (e.g., posts that represent user views) into an appropriate disentangled latent space. To better disentangle latent variables in that space, we develop a total correlation regularization module, a Proportional-Integral (PI) control module, and adopt rectified Gaussian distribution to ensure the orthogonality. The latent representation of users and content can then be used to quantify their ideological leaning and detect/predict their stances on issues. We evaluate the performance of the proposed InfoVGAE on three real-world datasets, of which two are collected from Twitter and one from U.S. Congress voting records. The evaluation results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised models by reducing 10.5% user clustering errors and achieving 12.1% higher F1 scores for stance separation of content items. In addition, InfoVGAE produces a comparable result with supervised models.

In support based conversations, two primary components have been identified to produce positive outcomes,empathy andmotivation. While empathy necessitates acknowledging the feelings of the users with a desire to help, imparting hope and motivation uplifts the spirit of support seekers in distress. A combination of these aspects will ensure generalized positive outcome and beneficial alliance in mental health support. The VA, thus, should be capable of generating empathetic and motivational responses, continuously demonstrating positive sentiment by the VA.

|[Multimodal Entity Linking with Gated Hierarchical Fusion and Contrastive Training](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531867)|Peng Wang, Jiangheng Wu, Xiaohang Chen|Southeast University, Nanjing, China|Previous entity linking methods in knowledge graphs (KGs) mostly link the textual mentions to corresponding entities. However, they have deficiencies in processing numerous multimodal data, when the text is too short to provide enough context. Consequently, we conceive the idea of introducing valuable information of other modalities, and propose a novel multimodal entity linking method with gated hierarchical multimodal fusion and contrastive training (GHMFC). Firstly, in order to discover the fine-grained inter-modal correlations, GHMFC extracts the hierarchical features of text and visual co-attention through the multi-modal co-attention mechanism: textual-guided visual attention and visual-guided textual attention. The former attention obtains weighted visual features under the guidance of textual information. In contrast, the latter attention produces weighted textual features under the guidance of visual information. Afterwards, gated fusion is used to evaluate the importance of hierarchical features of different modalities and integrate them into the final multimodal representations of mentions. Subsequently, contrastive training with two types of contrastive losses is designed to learn more generic multimodal features and reduce noise. Finally, the linking entities are selected by calculating the cosine similarity between representations of mentions and entities in KGs. To evaluate the proposed method, this paper releases two new open multimodal entity linking datasets: WikiMEL and Richpedia-MEL. Experimental results demonstrate that GHMFC can learn meaningful multimodal representation and significantly outperforms most of the baseline methods.|以往知识图中的实体链接方法大多将文本提及链接到相应的实体。然而，当文本太短而无法提供足够的上下文时，它们在处理大量多模式数据方面存在缺陷。因此，我们提出了引入其他模式的有价值信息的思想，并提出了一种新的多模式实体连接方法与门限层次多模式融合和对比训练(GHMFC)。首先，为了发现细粒度的多模态关联，GHMFC 通过文本引导的视觉注意和视觉引导的文本注意这两种多模态共注意机制提取文本和视觉共注意的层次特征。前者在文本信息的引导下获得加权视觉特征。相反，后者在视觉信息的引导下产生加权的文本特征。然后，门限融合被用来评估不同模式的等级特征的重要性，并将它们整合到提及的最终多模式表示中。随后，设计了两种对比损失的对比训练，以学习更一般的多模态特征和降低噪声。最后，通过计算幼儿园中提及和实体的表示之间的余弦距离来选择链接实体。为了评估提出的方法，本文发布了两个新的开放的多模式实体链接数据集: WikiMEL 和 Richpedia-MEL。实验结果表明，GHMFC 能够学习有意义的多模态表示，其性能明显优于大多数基线方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Multimodal+Entity+Linking+with+Gated+Hierarchical+Fusion+and+Contrastive+Training)|2|

However, such a strong assumption does not always hold in practice, and most of multimodal fusion models may fail when partial modalities are missing. Several works have addressed the missing modality problem; but most of them only considered the single modality missing case, and ignored the practically more general cases of multiple modalities missing. To this end, in this paper, we propose a Tag-Assisted Transformer Encoder (TATE) network to handle the problem of missing uncertain modalities. Specifically, we design a tag encoding module to cover both the single modality and multiple modalities missing cases, so as to guide the network's attention to those missing modalities. Besides, we adopt a new space projection pattern to align common vectors. Then, a Transformer encoder-decoder network is utilized to learn the missing modality features. At last, the outputs of the Transformer encoder are used for the final sentiment classification. Extensive experiments are conducted on CMU-MOSI and IEMOCAP datasets, showing that our method can achieve significant improvements compared with several baselines.|多模态情绪分析已研究的假设下，所有的模式是可用的。然而，这样一个强大的假设并不总是适用于实践，并且大多数多模态融合模型可能会失败时，部分模式缺失。有几部著作论述了缺失模式问题; 但大多数著作只考虑了单一模式缺失的情况，而忽略了实际上更为普遍的多模式缺失的情况。为此，本文提出了一种标签辅助变压器编码器(TATE)网络来处理丢失不确定模式的问题。具体来说，我们设计了一个标签编码模块来同时涵盖单个模态和多个模态的缺失情况，从而引导网络对这些缺失模态的注意。此外，我们还采用了一种新的空间投影模式来对齐公共向量。然后，利用变压器编译码网络来学习缺失的模态特征。最后，利用变压器编码器的输出进行最终的情感分类。在 CMU-MOSI 和 IEMOCAP 数据集上进行了大量的实验，结果表明，与几个基线相比，本文提出的方法可以取得显著的改进。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Tag-assisted+Multimodal+Sentiment+Analysis+under+Uncertain+Missing+Modalities)|2|

It first detects relations occurred in a sentence and then extracts the corresponding head/tail entities of the detected relations. To instantiate this strategy, we further propose a model, RelATE, which builds a dual-level attention to aggregate relation-relevant information to detect the relation occurrence and utilizes the annotated samples of the detected relations to extract the corresponding head/tail entities.

Among the most prominent of these approaches is TCT-ColBERT, which trains a light-weight "student'' model from a more expensive "teacher'' model. In this work, we take a closer look into TCT-ColBERT concerning its reproducibility and replicability. To structure our study, we propose a three-stage perspective on reproducing the training, inference, and evaluation of model-focused papers, each using artefacts produced from different stages in the pipeline. We find that --- perhaps as expected --- precise reproduction is more challenging when the complete training process is conducted, rather than just inference from a released trained model. Each stage provides the opportunity to perform replication and ablation experiments. We are able to replicate (i.e., produce an effective independent implementation) for model inference and dense indexing/retrieval, but are unable to replicate the training process. We conduct several ablations to cover gaps in the original paper, and make the following observations: (1) the model can function as an inexpensive re-ranker, establishing a new Pareto-optimal result; (2) the index size can be reduced by using lower-precision floating point values, but only if ties in scores are handled appropriately; (3) training needs to be conducted for the entire suggested duration to achieve optimal performance; and (4) student initialisation from the teacher is not necessary.|密集检索方法越来越受到人们的关注，因为与稀疏检索模型(如 BM25)相比，密集检索方法能够更好地捕获上下文相似性。其中最突出的方法是 TCT-ColBERT，它从更昂贵的“教师”模型中培训轻量级的“学生”模型。在这项工作中，我们对 TCT-ColBERT 的重复性和可复制性进行了更深入的研究。为了构建我们的研究，我们提出了一个三阶段的视角来重现模型关注论文的训练、推理和评估，每一个阶段都使用流水线中不同阶段产生的人工制品。我们发现——也许正如预期的那样——当完整的训练过程进行时，精确的复制比仅仅从已发布的训练模型中推断更具挑战性。每个阶段都提供了进行复制和消融实验的机会。我们能够复制(即，生成一个有效的独立实现)模型推理和密集索引/检索，但无法复制培训过程。我们进行了几次消融，以弥补原始论文中的空白，并做出以下观察: (1)该模型可以作为一个廉价的重新排序，建立一个新的帕累托最优结果; (2)指数大小可以通过使用较低精度的浮点数值减少，但只有当分数的关系处理得当时; (3)培训需要进行整个建议的持续时间，以达到最佳的表现; (4)学生初始化是不必要的教师。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=An+Inspection+of+the+Reproducibility+and+Replicability+of+TCT-ColBERT)|2|

Understanding the Internet meme is one of the most tricky challenges in natural language processing (NLP) tasks due to its convenient non-standard writing and network vocabulary.

|[User-Aware Multi-Interest Learning for Candidate Matching in Recommenders](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3532073)|Zheng Chai, Zhihong Chen, Chenliang Li, Rong Xiao, Houyi Li, Jiawei Wu, Jingxu Chen, Haihong Tang|Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Alibaba Group, Hangzhou, China; Wuhan University, Wuhan, China|Recommender systems have become a fundamental service in most E-Commerce platforms, in which the matching stage aims to retrieve potentially relevant candidate items to users for further ranking. Recently, some efforts on extracting multi-interests from user's historical behaviors have demonstrated superior performance. However, the historical behaviors are not noise-free due to the possible misclicks or disturbances. Existing works mainly overlook the fact that the interests of a user are not only reflected by the historical behaviors, but also inherently regulated by the profile information. Hence, we are interested in exploiting the benefit of user profile in multi-interest learning to enhance candidate matching performance. To this end, a user-aware multi-interest learning framework (named UMI) is proposed in this paper to exploit both user profile and behavior information for candidate matching. Specifically, UMI consists of two main components: dual-attention routing and interest refinement. In the dual-attention routing, we firstly introduce a user-guided attention network to identify the important historical items with respect to the user profile. Then, the resultant importance weights are leveraged via the dual-attentive capsule network to extract the user's multi-interests. Afterwards, the extracted interests are utilized to highlight the corresponding user profile features for interest refinement, such that different user profiles can be incorporated into interest learning for diverse user preference understanding. Besides, to improve the model's discriminative capacity, we further devise a harder-negatives strategy to support model optimization. Extensive experiments show that UMI significantly outperforms state-of-the-art multi-interest modeling alternatives. Currently, UMI has been successfully deployed at Taobao App in Alibaba, serving hundreds of millions of users.|推荐系统已经成为大多数电子商务平台的基本服务，其中匹配阶段的目的是检索潜在的相关候选项目，以便用户进一步排名。最近，一些从用户历史行为中提取多重利益的尝试已经显示出了卓越的性能。然而，由于可能的错误或干扰，历史行为并不是无噪声的。现有的研究工作主要忽视了用户的利益不仅反映在历史行为上，而且内在地受到个人资料信息的调节。因此，我们有兴趣在多兴趣学习中利用用户资料的好处来提高候选人匹配性能。为此，本文提出了一种基于用户感知的多兴趣学习框架(UMI) ，该框架利用用户信息和行为信息进行候选人匹配。具体来说，UMI 包括两个主要组成部分: 双注意路由和兴趣细化。在双注意路由中，我们首先引入一个用户引导的注意网络来识别与用户资料相关的重要历史项目。然后，通过双注意胶囊网络利用得到的重要性权重来提取用户的多重兴趣。然后利用提取出的兴趣特征突出相应的用户兴趣特征进行兴趣细化，从而将不同的用户兴趣特征融入到兴趣学习中以获得不同的用户偏好理解。此外，为了提高模型的判别能力，我们进一步设计了一个较难否定的策略来支持模型优化。大量的实验表明，UMI 明显优于最先进的多重兴趣建模方案。目前，用户界面已经在阿里巴巴的淘宝应用上成功部署，为数亿用户提供服务。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=User-Aware+Multi-Interest+Learning+for+Candidate+Matching+in+Recommenders)|1|

Methods in the Entire Space Multi-task Model (ESMM) family leverage the sequential pattern of user actions, \ie $impression\rightarrow click \rightarrow conversion$ to address data sparsity issue. However, they still fail to ensure the unbiasedness of CVR estimates. In this paper, we theoretically demonstrate that ESMM suffers from the following two problems: (1) Inherent Estimation Bias (IEB) for CVR estimation, where the CVR estimate is inherently higher than the ground truth; (2) Potential Independence Priority (PIP) for CTCVR estimation, where ESMM might overlook the causality from click to conversion. To this end, we devise a principled approach named Entire Space Counterfactual Multi-task Modelling (ESCM$^2$), which employs a counterfactual risk miminizer as a regularizer in ESMM to address both IEB and PIP issues simultaneously. Extensive experiments on offline datasets and online environments demonstrate that our proposed ESCM$^2$ can largely mitigate the inherent IEB and PIP issues and achieve better performance than baseline models.|准确估计点击后的转换率是建立推荐系统的关键，长期以来推荐系统一直面临样本选择偏差和数据稀疏问题。整个空间多任务模型(ESMM)家族中的方法利用了用户操作的顺序模式，例如: $pressionright-tarrow 单击 right-tarrow 转换 $来解决数据稀疏问题。然而，他们仍然不能确保 CVR 估计的公正性。在本文中，我们从理论上证明了 ESMM 存在以下两个问题: (1) CVR 估计的内在估计偏差(IEB) ，其中 CVR 估计固有地高于地面真值; (2) CTCVR 估计的潜在独立优先级(PIP) ，其中 ESMM 可能忽略从点击到转换的因果关系。为此，我们设计了一种名为“整个空间反事实多任务建模”(ESCM $^ 2 $)的原则性方法，该方法使用反事实风险模拟器作为 ESMM 中的规则化器，同时解决 IEB 和 PIP 问题。在离线数据集和在线环境上的大量实验表明，我们提出的 ESCM $^ 2 $可以在很大程度上缓解内在的 IEB 和 PIP 问题，并取得比基线模型更好的性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=ESCM2:+Entire+Space+Counterfactual+Multi-Task+Model+for+Post-Click+Conversion+Rate+Estimation)|1|

However, these embeddings are usually assigned a unified dimension, which suffers from the following issues: (1) high memory usage and computation cost. (2) sub-optimal performance due to inferior dimension assignments. In order to alleviate the above issues, some works focus on automated embedding dimension search by formulating it as hyper-parameter optimization or embedding pruning problems. However, they either require well-designed search space for hyperparameters or need time-consuming optimization procedures. In this paper, we propose a Single-Shot Embedding Dimension Search method, called SSEDS, which can efficiently assign dimensions for each feature field via a single-shot embedding pruning operation while maintaining the recommendation accuracy of the model. Specifically, it introduces a criterion for identifying the importance of each embedding dimension for each feature field. As a result, SSEDS could automatically obtain mixed-dimensional embeddings by explicitly reducing redundant embedding dimensions based on the corresponding dimension importance ranking and the predefined parameter budget. Furthermore, the proposed SSEDS is model-agnostic, meaning that it could be integrated into different base recommendation models. The extensive offline experiments are conducted on two widely used public datasets for CTR (Click Through Rate) prediction task, and the results demonstrate that SSEDS can still achieve strong recommendation performance even if it has reduced 90% parameters. Moreover, SSEDS has also been deployed on the WeChat Subscription platform for practical recommendation services. The 7-day online A/B test results show that SSEDS can significantly improve the performance of the online recommendation model while reducing resource consumption.|作为现代深度推荐系统的重要组成部分，特征嵌入将高维稀疏用户/项目特征映射为低维密集嵌入。然而，这些嵌入通常被分配一个统一的维度，这受到以下问题: (1)高内存使用和计算成本。(2)由于尺寸分配不合理而导致性能次优。为了解决上述问题，一些工作将嵌入维搜索问题转化为超参数优化问题或嵌入剪枝问题。然而，它们要么需要设计良好的超参数搜索空间，要么需要耗时的优化过程。本文提出了一种单镜头嵌入维度搜索方法 SSEDS，该方法通过单镜头嵌入剪枝操作，可以有效地为每个特征域分配维度，同时保持模型的推荐精度。具体地说，它引入了一个标准来识别每个特征字段的每个嵌入维的重要性。因此，SSEDS 可以根据相应的维重要性排序和预定义的参数预算，通过显式地减少冗余嵌入维数来自动获得混合维嵌入。此外，提出的 SSEDS 是模型无关的，这意味着它可以集成到不同的基本推荐模型中。在两个广泛使用的公共数据集上进行了广泛的离线实验，结果表明，即使 SSEDS 减少了90% 的参数，仍然可以获得很好的推荐性能。此外，SSEDS 还被部署在微信订阅平台上，提供实用的推荐服务。为期7天的在线 A/B 测试结果表明，SSEDS 在降低资源消耗的同时，可以显著提高在线推荐模型的性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Single-shot+Embedding+Dimension+Search+in+Recommender+System)|1|

In this paper, we propose DisenCTR, a novel dynamic graph-based disentangled representation framework for CTR prediction.

Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, LIG, Grenoble, France|Combining query tokens and document tokens and inputting them to pre-trained transformer models like BERT, an approach known as interaction-based, has shown state-of-the-art effectiveness for information retrieval. However, the computational complexity of this approach is high due to the online self-attention computation. In contrast, dense retrieval methods in representation-based approaches are known to be efficient, however less effective. A tradeoff between the two is reached with late interaction methods like ColBERT, which attempt to benefit from both approaches: contextualized token embeddings can be pre-calculated over BERT for fine-grained effective interaction while preserving efficiency. However, despite its success in passage retrieval, it's not straightforward to use this approach for long document retrieval. In this paper, we propose a cascaded late interaction approach using a single model for long document retrieval. Fast intra-ranking by dot product is used to select relevant passages, then fine-grained interaction of pre-stored token embeddings is used to generate passage scores which are aggregated to the final document score. Multi-task learning is used to train a BERT model to optimize both a dot product and a fine-grained interaction loss functions.

With the development of the online platforms, the sequential user behaviors grow rapidly, bringing us great opportunity to better understand user preferences.However, it is extremely challenging for existing sequential models to effectively utilize the entire behavior history of each user. First, there is a lot of noise in such long histories, which can seriously hurt the prediction performance. Second, feeding the long behavior sequence directly results in infeasible inference time and storage cost. In order to tackle these challenges, in this paper we propose a novel framework, which we name as User Behavior Clustering Sampling (UBCS).

Then, the sampled short sub-sequences will be fed into the CTR prediction module for efficient prediction.

|[Distill-VQ: Learning Retrieval Oriented Vector Quantization By Distilling Knowledge from Dense Embeddings](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531799)|Shitao Xiao, Zheng Liu, Weihao Han, Jianjin Zhang, Defu Lian, Yeyun Gong, Qi Chen, Fan Yang, Hao Sun, Yingxia Shao, Xing Xie||Vector quantization (VQ) based ANN indexes, such as Inverted File System (IVF) and Product Quantization (PQ), have been widely applied to embedding based document retrieval thanks to the competitive time and memory efficiency. Originally, VQ is learned to minimize the reconstruction loss, i.e., the distortions between the original dense embeddings and the reconstructed embeddings after quantization. Unfortunately, such an objective is inconsistent with the goal of selecting ground-truth documents for the input query, which may cause severe loss of retrieval quality. Recent works identify such a defect, and propose to minimize the retrieval loss through contrastive learning. However, these methods intensively rely on queries with ground-truth documents, whose performance is limited by the insufficiency of labeled data. In this paper, we propose Distill-VQ, which unifies the learning of IVF and PQ within a knowledge distillation framework. In Distill-VQ, the dense embeddings are leveraged as "teachers'', which predict the query's relevance to the sampled documents. The VQ modules are treated as the "students'', which are learned to reproduce the predicted relevance, such that the reconstructed embeddings may fully preserve the retrieval result of the dense embeddings. By doing so, Distill-VQ is able to derive substantial training signals from the massive unlabeled data, which significantly contributes to the retrieval quality. We perform comprehensive explorations for the optimal conduct of knowledge distillation, which may provide useful insights for the learning of VQ based ANN index. We also experimentally show that the labeled data is no longer a necessity for high-quality vector quantization, which indicates Distill-VQ's strong applicability in practice. The evaluations are performed on MS MARCO and Natural Questions benchmarks, where Distill-VQ notably outperforms the SOTA VQ methods in Recall and MRR. Our code is avaliable at https://github.com/staoxiao/LibVQ.|基于向量量化(vQ)的人工神经网络索引，例如倒置文件系统(IVF)和产品量化(PQ) ，由于具有竞争性的时间和存储效率，已被广泛应用于基于嵌入的文献检索。最初，学习 VQ 来最小化重构损失，即原始密集嵌入和量化后重构嵌入之间的失真。遗憾的是，这样的目标不符合为输入查询选择地面真实文档的目标，这可能导致检索质量的严重损失。最近的工作发现了这一缺陷，并提出通过对比学习来最小化检索损失。然而，这些方法主要依赖于对地面真相文档的查询，其性能受到标记数据不足的限制。在本文中，我们提出了提取 VQ，它在一个知识提取框架内将 IVF 和 PQ 的学习结合起来。在蒸馏 VQ 中，密集嵌入被用作“教师”，用于预测查询与采样文档的相关性。将 VQ 模块视为“学生”，学习再现预测的相关性，使得重构嵌入能够完全保留密集嵌入的检索结果。通过这种方法，DistilVQ 能够从海量的未标记数据中提取出大量的训练信号，从而大大提高了检索质量。本文对知识提取的最优化进行了全面的探索，为基于矢量量化的神经网络指标的学习提供了有益的启示。我们还通过实验表明，标记数据不再是高质量向量量化的必要条件，这表明蒸馏 VQ 在实践中的强大适用性。评估是在微软 MARCO 和自然问题基准上进行的，其中蒸馏 VQ 明显优于召回和 MRR 中的 SOTA VQ 方法。我们的代码 https://github.com/staoxiao/libvq 可用。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Distill-VQ:+Learning+Retrieval+Oriented+Vector+Quantization+By+Distilling+Knowledge+from+Dense+Embeddings)|1|

Existing methods mainly attempt to mine user interests from users' historical behaviours, which contain users' directly interacted items. Although these methods have made great progress, they are often limited by the recommender system's direct exposure and inactive interactions, and thus fail to mine all potential user interests. To tackle these problems, we propose Neighbor-Interaction based CTR prediction (NI-CTR), which considers this task under a Heterogeneous Information Network (HIN) setting. In short, Neighbor-Interaction based CTR prediction involves the local neighborhood of the target user-item pair in the HIN to predict their linkage. In order to guide the representation learning of the local neighbourhood, we further consider different kinds of interactions among the local neighborhood nodes from both explicit and implicit perspective, and propose a novel Graph-Masked Transformer (GMT) to effectively incorporates these kinds of interactions to produce highly representative embeddings for the target user-item pair. Moreover, in order to improve model robustness against neighbour sampling, we enforce a consistency regularization loss over the neighbourhood embedding. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets with millions of instances and the experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art CTR models significantly. Meanwhile, the comprehensive ablation studies verify the effectiveness of every component of our model. Furthermore, we have deployed this framework on the WeChat Official Account Platform with billions of users. The online A/B tests demonstrate an average CTR improvement of 21.9% against all online baselines.|点进率预测是在线广告的一个重要组成部分，其目的是估计用户点击某个项目的概率。现有的方法主要是从用户的历史行为中挖掘用户兴趣，这些历史行为包含了用户直接交互的项目。尽管这些方法已经取得了很大的进步，但它们往往受到推荐系统直接暴露和非活动交互的限制，因此无法挖掘所有潜在的用户兴趣。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了基于邻居交互的点击率预测(NI-CTR) ，它考虑了异构信息网络(HIN)环境下的任务。简而言之，基于邻域交互的 CTR 预测涉及到 HIN 中目标用户-项目对的局部邻域来预测它们之间的联系。为了指导局部邻域的表示学习，我们进一步从显式和隐式两个角度考虑局部邻域节点之间的不同交互，并提出了一种新的图掩盖变换器(GMT) ，以有效地整合这些交互，为目标用户项对产生高度代表性的嵌入。此外，为了提高模型对邻域采样的鲁棒性，我们对邻域嵌入增加了一个一致性正则化损失。我们在两个实际数据集上进行了大量的实验，实验结果表明，我们提出的方法明显优于最先进的 CTR 模型。同时，综合烧蚀研究验证了模型各组成部分的有效性。此外，我们已经在微信官方账号平台上部署了这个框架，拥有数十亿用户。在线 A/B 测试显示，与所有在线基线相比，点击率平均提高了21.9% 。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Neighbour+Interaction+based+Click-Through+Rate+Prediction+via+Graph-masked+Transformer)|1|
|[Why Don't You Click: Understanding Non-Click Results in Web Search with Brain Signals](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3532082)|Ziyi Ye, Xiaohui Xie, Yiqun Liu, Zhihong Wang, Xuancheng Li, Jiaji Li, Xuesong Chen, Min Zhang, Shaoping Ma|The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Shenzhen, China; Tsinghua University, Beijing, China|Web search heavily relies on click-through behavior as an essential feedback signal for performance evaluation and improvement. Traditionally, click is usually treated as a positive implicit feedback signal of relevance or usefulness, while non-click is regarded as a signal of irrelevance or uselessness. However, there are many cases where users satisfy their information need with the contents shown on the Search Engine Result Page (SERP). This raises the problem of measuring the usefulness of non-click results and modeling user satisfaction in such circumstances. For a long period, understanding non-click results is challenging owing to the lack of user interactions. In recent years, the rapid development of neuroimaging technologies constitutes a paradigm shift in various industries, e.g., search, entertainment, and education. Therefore, we benefit from these technologies and apply them to bridge the gap between the human mind and the external search system in non-click situations. To this end, we analyze the differences in brain signals between the examination of non-click search results in different usefulness levels. Inspired by these findings, we conduct supervised learning tasks to estimate the usefulness of non-click results with brain signals and conventional information (i.e., content and context factors). Furthermore, we devise two re-ranking methods, i.e., a Personalized Method (PM) and a Generalized Intent modeling Method (GIM), for search result re-ranking with the estimated usefulness. Results show that it is feasible to utilize brain signals to improve usefulness estimation performance and enhance human-computer interactions by search result re-ranking.|网络搜索在很大程度上依赖于点击行为作为性能评估和改进的重要反馈信号。传统上，点击通常被视为相关性或有用性的积极隐性反馈信号，而非点击则被视为无关性或无用性的信号。但是，在许多情况下，用户使用搜索引擎结果页(SERP)上显示的内容来满足他们的信息需求。这就提出了测量非点击结果的有用性以及在这种情况下建立用户满意度模型的问题。长期以来，由于缺乏用户交互，理解非点击结果是一项挑战。近年来，神经影像技术的快速发展构成了搜索、娱乐和教育等多个行业的范式转变。因此，我们从这些技术中受益，并应用它们在非点击情况下架起人类思维和外部搜索系统之间的桥梁。为此，我们分析了不同有用性水平的非点击检索结果在大脑信号方面的差异。受这些发现的启发，我们进行了一些监督式学习的任务，用大脑信号和传统信息(即内容和上下文因素)来评估非点击结果的有用性。此外，我们设计了两个重新排序的方法，即个性化方法(PM)和广义意图建模方法(GIM) ，用于搜索结果的重新排序与估计的有用性。实验结果表明，利用大脑信号进行搜索结果重排可以提高有用性估计性能，增强人机交互。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Why+Don't+You+Click:+Understanding+Non-Click+Results+in+Web+Search+with+Brain+Signals)|1|

A recurring problem among existing works that makes it difficult to learn and perform well is the sparsity of the User-POI matrix. In this paper, we propose our Hierarchical Multi-Task Graph Recurrent Network (HMT-GRN) approach, which alleviates the data sparsity problem by learning different User-Region matrices of lower sparsities in a multi-task setting. We then perform a Hierarchical Beam Search (HBS) on the different region and POI distributions to hierarchically reduce the search space with increasing spatial granularity and predict the next POI. Our HBS provides efficiency gains by reducing the search space, resulting in speedups of 5 to 7 times over an exhaustive approach. In addition, we also propose a novel selectivity layer to predict if the next POI has been visited before by the user to balance between personalization and exploration. Experimental results on two real-world Location-Based Social Network (LBSN) datasets show that our model significantly outperforms baseline and the state-of-the-art methods.|由于该地区可能存在的 POI 搜索空间很大，因此了解用户下一步将访问哪个 POI 对于个性化推荐系统来说是一项具有挑战性的任务。现有作品中反复出现的一个难以学习和执行的问题是 User-POI 矩阵的稀疏性。本文提出了一种分层多任务图回归网络(HMT-GRN)方法，通过在多任务环境下学习不同稀疏度较低的用户区域矩阵来解决数据稀疏问题。然后对不同区域和 POI 分布进行分层束搜索(HBS) ，随着空间粒度的增加逐步减少搜索空间，并预测下一个 POI。我们的 HBS 通过减少搜索空间提供了效率增益，在一个详尽的方法中导致5到7倍的加速。此外，我们还提出了一个新的选择层来预测下一个 POI 是否已经被用户访问过，以便在个性化和探索之间取得平衡。在两个实际的基于位置的社会网络(LBSN)数据集上的实验结果表明，我们的模型明显优于基线和最先进的方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Hierarchical+Multi-Task+Graph+Recurrent+Network+for+Next+POI+Recommendation)|1|

The recently proposed Transformer-based models have proved superior in the sequential recommendation, modeling temporal dynamics globally via the remarkable self-attention mechanism. However, all equivalent item-item interactions in original self-attention are cumbersome, failing to capture the drifting of users' local preferences, which contain abundant short-term patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretable convolutional self-attention, which efficiently captures both short- and long-term patterns with a progressive attention distribution. Specifically, a down-sampling convolution module is proposed to segment the overall long behavior sequence into a series of local subsequences. Accordingly, the segments are interacted with each item in the self-attention layer to produce locality-aware contextual representations, during which the quadratic complexity in original self-attention is reduced to nearly linear complexity. Moreover, to further enhance the robust feature learning in the context of Transformers, an unsymmetrical positional encoding strategy is carefully designed. Extensive experiments are carried out on real-world datasets, \eg ML-1M, Amazon Books, and Yelp, indicating that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods w.r.t. both effectiveness and efficiency.|在实际的推荐系统中，用户的偏好往往受到长期不变的利益和短期的时间需求的影响。最近提出的变压器为基础的模型已被证明优越的顺序推荐，建模全球时间动态通过显着的自我注意机制。然而，原始自我注意中的所有等效项目-项目交互都是繁琐的，未能捕捉到用户本地偏好的漂移，其中包含了丰富的短期模式。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的可解释的卷积自我注意，有效地捕捉短期和长期的模式与逐步注意分布。特别地，提出了一种下采样卷积模块，将整个长行为序列分割成一系列局部子序列。相应地，这些片段与自我注意层中的每个项目相互作用，产生具有局部感知的上下文表征，在此过程中，原始自我注意的二次复杂度降低到接近线性复杂度。此外，为了进一步提高变压器环境下的鲁棒性特征学习，设计了一种非对称的位置编码策略。在现实世界的数据集上进行了大量的实验，例如 ML-1M，Amazon Books 和 Yelp，表明所提出的方法在效率和效果上都优于最先进的方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Progressive+Self-Attention+Network+with+Unsymmetrical+Positional+Encoding+for+Sequential+Recommendation)|1|

In online e-commerce recommendation system, user behavior consists of the sequential visiting logs and item behavior contains the interacted user list in order. Most of the existing state-of-the-art sequential prediction methods only consider the user behavior while ignoring the item behavior. In addition, we find that user behavior varies greatly at different time, and most existing models fail to characterize the rich temporal information. To address the above problems, we propose a transformer-based spatial-temporal recommendation framework (STEM). In the STEM framework, we first utilize attention mechanisms to model user behavior and item behavior, and then exploit spatial and temporal information through a transformer-based model. The STEM framework, as a plug-in, is able to be incorporated into many neural network-based sequential recommendation methods to improve performance.

|[Mitigating the Filter Bubble While Maintaining Relevance: Targeted Diversification with VAE-based Recommender Systems](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531890)|Zhaolin Gao, Tianshu Shen, Zheda Mai, Mohamed Reda Bouadjenek, Isaac Waller, Ashton Anderson, Ron Bodkin, Scott Sanner|Deakin University, Geelong, Australia; Optimy AI, Toronto, ON, Canada; University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Toronto, ON, Canada|Online recommendation systems are prone to create filter bubbles, whereby users are only recommended content narrowly aligned with their historical interests. In the case of media recommendation, this can reinforce political polarization by recommending topical content (e.g., on the economy) at one extreme end of the political spectrum even though this topic has broad coverage from multiple political viewpoints that would provide a more balanced and informed perspective for the user. Historically, Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) has been used to diversify result lists and even mitigate filter bubbles, but suffers from three key drawbacks: (1)~MMR directly sacrifices relevance for diversity, (2)~MMR typically diversifies across all content and not just targeted dimensions (e.g., political polarization), and (3)~MMR is inefficient in practice due to the need to compute pairwise similarities between recommended items. To simultaneously address these limitations, we propose a novel methodology that trains Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) for targeted topical dimensions (e.g., political polarization). We then modulate the latent embeddings of user preferences in a state-of-the-art VAE-based recommender system to diversify along the targeted dimension while preserving topical relevance across orthogonal dimensions. Our experiments show that our Targeted Diversification VAE-based Collaborative Filtering (TD-VAE-CF) methodology better preserves relevance of content to user preferences across a range of diversification levels in comparison to both untargeted and targeted variations of Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR); TD-VAE-CF is also much more computationally efficient than the post-hoc re-ranking approach of MMR.|在线推荐系统容易产生过滤气泡，用户只能被推荐与他们的历史兴趣狭窄地一致的内容。就媒体推荐而言，这可能会加剧政治两极分化，推荐政治光谱一端的主题内容(例如经济) ，尽管这个主题有多种政治观点的广泛覆盖，可以为用户提供一个更加平衡和知情的视角。从历史上看，最大边际相关(MMR)一直被用来使结果列表多样化，甚至减轻过滤器泡沫，但遭受三个关键的缺点: (1) ~ MMR 直接牺牲相关性的多样性，(2) ~ MMR 通常多样化跨所有内容，而不仅仅是有针对性的维度(例如，政治极化) ，和(3) ~ MMR 在实践中是低效的，因为需要计算推荐项目之间的成对相似性。为了同时解决这些局限性，我们提出了一种新的方法，训练概念激活向量(CAV)的目标主题维度(例如，政治极化)。然后，我们调整潜在的嵌入用户偏好在一个国家的最先进的 VAE 为基础的推荐系统，以多样化沿着目标的维度，同时保持跨正交维度的主题相关性。我们的实验表明，我们的基于目标多样化 VAE 的协同过滤(TD-VAE-CF)方法更好地保留了多样化水平范围内的用户偏好的内容相关性，与非目标和有针对性的最大边际相关性(MMR)变化相比，TD-VAE-CF 也比 MMR 的事后重新排序方法计算效率高得多。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Mitigating+the+Filter+Bubble+While+Maintaining+Relevance:+Targeted+Diversification+with+VAE-based+Recommender+Systems)|1|

Ivanov|Uniphore Software Systems Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA; Idiap Research Institute, Martigny, Switzerland|In this paper, we evaluate different alternatives to process richer forms of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) output based on lattice expansion algorithms for Spoken Document Retrieval (SDR). Typically, SDR systems employ ASR transcripts to index and retrieve relevant documents. However, ASR errors negatively affect the retrieval performance. Multiple alternative hypotheses can also be used to augment the input to document retrieval to compensate for the erroneous one-best hypothesis. In Weighted Finite State Transducer-based ASR systems, using the n-best output (i.e. the top "n'' scoring hypotheses) for the retrieval task is common, since they can easily be fed to a traditional Information Retrieval (IR) pipeline. However, the n-best hypotheses are terribly redundant, and do not sufficiently encapsulate the richness of the ASR output, which is represented as an acyclic directed graph called the lattice. In particular, we utilize the lattice's constrained minimum path cover to generate a minimum set of hypotheses that serve as input to the reranking phase of IR. The novelty of our proposed approach is the incorporation of the lattice as an input for neural reranking by considering a set of hypotheses that represents every arc in the lattice. The obtained hypotheses are encoded through sentence embeddings using BERT-based models, namely SBERT and RoBERTa, and the final ranking of the retrieved segments is obtained with a max-pooling operation over the computed scores among the input query and the hypotheses set. We present our evaluation on the publicly available AMI meeting corpus. Our results indicate that the proposed use of hypotheses from the expanded lattice improves the SDR performance significantly over the n-best ASR output.|在这篇文章中，我们评估了处理更丰富形式的自动语音识别(ASR)输出的不同方案，这些方案是基于文献检索的格展开算法。通常，SDR 系统使用 ASR 记录来索引和检索相关文档。但是，ASR 错误会对检索性能产生负面影响。多重替代假设也可以用来增加对文献检索的输入，以弥补错误的最佳假设。在基于加权有限状态转换器的 ASR 系统中，对于检索任务使用 n 个最佳输出(即顶部的“ n”评分假设)是很常见的，因为它们可以很容易地提供给传统的信息检索(IR)流水线。然而，n 个最佳假设是非常多余的，并且没有充分封装 ASR 输出的丰富性，ASR 输出被表示为一个称为格的非循环有向图。特别地，我们利用格子的约束最小路覆盖生成一组最小假设，作为 IR 重新排序阶段的输入。我们提出的方法的新颖之处在于，通过考虑一组代表格子中每个弧的假设，将格子作为神经重新排序的输入。所得到的假设通过使用基于 BERT 的模型(即 SBERT 和 RoBERTa)的句子嵌入进行编码，并且通过对输入查询和假设集之间计算得分的最大池操作获得检索段的最终排序。我们提出了我们的评价公开可用的 AMI 会议语料库。我们的结果表明，提出的假设使用从扩展格提高软件无线电性能显着超过 n 最佳的 ASR 输出。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Expanded+Lattice+Embeddings+for+Spoken+Document+Retrieval+on+Informal+Meetings)|1|

However, this paradigm suffers from the cold-start problem which will seriously compromise the ecological health of recommendation systems. This paper attempts to tackle the item cold-start problem by generating enhanced warmed-up ID embeddings for cold items with historical data and limited interaction records. From the aspect of industrial practice, we mainly focus on the following three points of item cold-start: 1) How to conduct cold-start without additional data requirements and make strategy easy to be deployed in online recommendation scenarios. 2) How to leverage both historical records and constantly emerging interaction data of new items. 3) How to model the relationship between item ID and side information stably from interaction data. To address these problems, we propose a model-agnostic Conditional Variational Autoencoder based Recommendation(CVAR) framework with some advantages including compatibility on various backbones, no extra requirements for data, utilization of both historical data and recent emerging interactions. CVAR uses latent variables to learn a distribution over item side information and generates desirable item ID embeddings using a conditional decoder.

We then devise a novel multi-faceted global item relation (MGIR) model to encode different relations using different aggregation layers and generate enhanced session representations by fusing positive and negative relations. Our solution is flexible to accommodate new item relations and can easily integrate existing session representation learning methods to generate better representations from global relation enhanced session information.

|[Interpreting Patient Descriptions using Distantly Supervised Similar Case Retrieval](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3532003)|Israa Alghanmi, Luis Espinosa Anke, Steven Schockaert|Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom|Biomedical natural language processing often involves the interpretation of patient descriptions, for instance for diagnosis or for recommending treatments. Current methods, based on biomedical language models, have been found to struggle with such tasks. Moreover, retrieval augmented strategies have only had limited success, as it is rare to find sentences which express the exact type of knowledge that is needed for interpreting a given patient description. For this reason, rather than attempting to retrieve explicit medical knowledge, we instead propose to rely on a nearest neighbour strategy. First, we retrieve text passages that are similar to the given patient description, and are thus likely to describe patients in similar situations, while also mentioning some hypothesis (e.g.\ a possible diagnosis of the patient). We then judge the likelihood of the hypothesis based on the similarity of the retrieved passages. Identifying similar cases is challenging, however, as descriptions of similar patients may superficially look rather different, among others because they often contain an abundance of irrelevant details. To address this challenge, we propose a strategy that relies on a distantly supervised cross-encoder.

|[Towards Explainable Search Results: A Listwise Explanation Generator](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3532067)|Puxuan Yu, Razieh Rahimi, James Allan|University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, MA, USA|It has been shown that the interpretability of search results is enhanced when query aspects covered by documents are explicitly provided. However, existing work on aspect-oriented explanation of search results explains each document independently. These explanations thus cannot describe the differences between documents. This issue is also true for existing models on query aspect generation. Furthermore, these models provide a single query aspect for each document, even though documents often cover multiple query aspects. To overcome these limitations, we propose LiEGe, an approach that jointly explains all documents in a search result list. LiEGe provides semantic representations at two levels of granularity -- documents and their tokens -- using different interaction signals including cross-document interactions. These allow listwise modeling of a search result list as well as the generation of coherent explanations for documents. To appropriately explain documents that cover multiple query aspects, we introduce two settings for search result explanation: comprehensive and novelty explanation generation. LiEGe is trained and evaluated for both settings. We evaluate LiEGe on datasets built from Wikipedia and real query logs of the Bing search engine. Our experimental results demonstrate that LiEGe outperforms all baselines, with improvements that are substantial and statistically significant.|研究表明，如果明确提供文件所涉查询方面，搜索结果的可解释性就会得到提高。但是，现有的面向方面的搜索结果解释工作独立地解释每个文档。因此，这些解释无法描述文档之间的差异。对于生成查询方面的现有模型，也存在这个问题。此外，这些模型为每个文档提供单个查询方面，即使文档通常包含多个查询方面。为了克服这些限制，我们提出了 LiEGe，一种联合解释搜索结果列表中所有文档的方法。LiEGe 使用不同的交互信号(包括跨文档交互)在两个粒度级别(文档及其标记)提供语义表示。它们允许对搜索结果列表进行列表建模，以及为文档生成连贯的解释。为了恰当地解释涵盖多个查询方面的文档，我们引入了两种用于搜索结果解释的设置: 全面解释生成和新颖解释生成。对 LiEGe 进行了两种设置的培训和评估。我们根据维基百科建立的数据集和 Bing 搜索引擎的实际查询日志来评估 LiEGe。我们的实验结果表明，LiEGe 的性能优于所有基线，具有实质性的改进和统计学意义。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Towards+Explainable+Search+Results:+A+Listwise+Explanation+Generator)|1|
|[Bit-aware Semantic Transformer Hashing for Multi-modal Retrieval](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531947)|Wentao Tan, Lei Zhu, Weili Guan, Jingjing Li, Zhiyong Cheng|Monash University, Clayton, Australia; Shandong Normal University, Jinan, China; Shandong Artificial Intelligence Institute, Jinan, China; University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China|Multi-modal hashing learns binary hash codes with extremely low storage cost and high retrieval speed. It can support efficient multi-modal retrieval well. However, most existing methods still suffer from three important problems: 1) Limited semantic representation capability with shallow learning. 2) Mandatory feature-level multi-modal fusion ignores heterogeneous multi-modal semantic gaps. 3) Direct coarse pairwise semantic preserving cannot effectively capture the fine-grained semantic correlations. For solving these problems, in this paper, we propose a Bit-aware Semantic Transformer Hashing (BSTH) framework to excavate bit-wise semantic concepts and simultaneously align the heterogeneous modalities for multi-modal hash learning on the concept-level. Specifically, the bit-wise implicit semantic concepts are learned with the transformer in a self-attention manner, which can achieve implicit semantic alignment on the fine-grained concept-level and reduce the heterogeneous modality gaps. Then, the concept-level multi-modal fusion is performed to enhance the semantic representation capability of each implicit concept and the fused concept representations are further encoded to the corresponding hash bits via bit-wise hash functions. Further, to supervise the bit-aware transformer module, a label prototype learning module is developed to learn prototype embeddings for all categories that capture the explicit semantic correlations on the category-level by considering the co-occurrence priors. Experiments on three widely tested multi-modal retrieval datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method from various aspects.|多模态哈希学习二进制哈希码具有极低的存储成本和极高的检索速度。它能很好地支持有效的多模态检索。然而，现有的大多数方法仍然存在三个重要问题: 1)语义表示能力有限，浅层学习。2)强制特征级多模态融合忽略异质多模态语义缺口。3)直接粗对语义保持不能有效地捕获细粒度的语义关联。为了解决这些问题，本文提出了一种比特感知的语义变换哈希(BSTH)框架来挖掘比特感知的语义概念，同时在概念层次上对多模态哈希学习的异构模式进行校准。具体来说，通过变换器以自我注意的方式学习位隐含语义概念，可以在细粒度的概念水平上实现隐含语义对齐，减少异质情态差异。然后进行概念级多模态融合以提高每个隐式概念的语义表示能力，并通过逐位哈希函数将融合后的概念表示进一步编码到相应的哈希位。此外，为了监督位感知转换器模块，开发了一个标签原型学习模块来学习所有类别的原型嵌入，这些类别通过考虑共现先验在类别层面上捕获显式的语义相关性。在三个被广泛测试的多模态检索数据集上的实验从各个方面证明了该方法的优越性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Bit-aware+Semantic+Transformer+Hashing+for+Multi-modal+Retrieval)|1|
|[Multimodal Disentanglement Variational AutoEncoders for Zero-Shot Cross-Modal Retrieval](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3532028)|Jialin Tian, Kai Wang, Xing Xu, Zuo Cao, Fumin Shen, Heng Tao Shen|University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China; Meituan, Shanghai, China|Zero-Shot Cross-Modal Retrieval (ZS-CMR) has recently drawn increasing attention as it focuses on a practical retrieval scenario, i.e., the multimodal test set consists of unseen classes that are disjoint with seen classes in the training set. The recently proposed methods typically adopt the generative model as the main framework to learn a joint latent embedding space to alleviate the modality gap. Generally, these methods largely rely on auxiliary semantic embeddings for knowledge transfer across classes and unconsciously neglect the effect of the data reconstruction manner in the adopted generative model. To address this issue, we propose a novel ZS-CMR model termed Multimodal Disentanglement Variational AutoEncoders (MDVAE), which consists of two coupled disentanglement variational autoencoders (DVAEs) and a fusion-exchange VAE (FVAE). Specifically, DVAE is developed to disentangle the original representations of each modality into modality-invariant and modality-specific features. FVAE is designed to fuse and exchange information of multimodal data by the reconstruction and alignment process without pre-extracted semantic embeddings. Moreover, an advanced counter-intuitive cross-reconstruction scheme is further proposed to enhance the informativeness and generalizability of the modality-invariant features for more effective knowledge transfer. The comprehensive experiments on four image-text retrieval and two image-sketch retrieval datasets consistently demonstrate that our method establishes the new state-of-the-art performance.|零拍交叉模态检索(Zero-Shot Cross-Modal Retrieval，ZS-CMR)近年来受到越来越多的关注，因为它集中在一个实际的检索场景，即多模态测试集包含不相交的看不见的类和训练集中的看得见的类。最近提出的方法通常采用生成模型作为主要框架，学习一个联合潜在嵌入空间，以缓解模态差距。一般而言，这些方法主要依赖于辅助语义嵌入来跨类别传递知识，而无意识地忽略了所采用的生成模型中数据重构方式的影响。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新的 ZS-CMR 模型，称为多模态解缠变分自动编码器(MDVAE) ，它由两个耦合的解缠变分自动编码器(DVAE)和一个融合交换 VAE (FVAE)组成。具体来说，DVAE 的开发是为了将每种模态的原始表示分解为模态不变和模态特定的特征。FVAE 通过重构和对齐过程实现多模态数据信息的融合和交换，不需要预先提取语义嵌入。进一步提出了一种改进的反直观交叉重构方案，以提高模态不变特征的信息量和泛化能力，实现更有效的知识转移。在四个图像文本检索和两个图像素描检索数据集上的综合实验表明，该方法建立了新的性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Multimodal+Disentanglement+Variational+AutoEncoders+for+Zero-Shot+Cross-Modal+Retrieval)|1|
|[User-controllable Recommendation Against Filter Bubbles](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3532075)|Wenjie Wang, Fuli Feng, Liqiang Nie, TatSeng Chua|National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China; Shandong University, Qingdao, China|Recommender systems usually face the issue of filter bubbles: over-recommending homogeneous items based on user features and historical interactions. Filter bubbles will grow along the feedback loop and inadvertently narrow user interests. Existing work usually mitigates filter bubbles by incorporating objectives apart from accuracy such as diversity and fairness. However, they typically sacrifice accuracy, hurting model fidelity and user experience. Worse still, users have to passively accept the recommendation strategy and influence the system in an inefficient manner with high latency, e.g., keeping providing feedback (e.g., like and dislike) until the system recognizes the user intention. This work proposes a new recommender prototype called User-Controllable Recommender System (UCRS), which enables users to actively control the mitigation of filter bubbles. Functionally, 1) UCRS can alert users if they are deeply stuck in filter bubbles. 2) UCRS supports four kinds of control commands for users to mitigate the bubbles at different granularities. 3) UCRS can respond to the controls and adjust the recommendations on the fly. The key to adjusting lies in blocking the effect of out-of-date user representations on recommendations, which contains historical information inconsistent with the control commands. As such, we develop a causality-enhanced User-Controllable Inference (UCI) framework, which can quickly revise the recommendations based on user controls in the inference stage and utilize counterfactual inference to mitigate the effect of out-of-date user representations. Experiments on three datasets validate that the UCI framework can effectively recommend more desired items based on user controls, showing promising performance w.r.t. both accuracy and diversity.|推荐系统通常面临过滤气泡的问题: 过度推荐基于用户特征和历史交互的同类项目。过滤气泡会沿着反馈回路增长，不经意间会缩小用户的兴趣。现有的工作通常通过将目标与准确性(如多样性和公平性)相结合来减少过滤泡沫。然而，他们通常牺牲准确性，损害模型的保真度和用户体验。更糟糕的是，用户必须被动地接受推荐策略，并以高延迟的低效方式影响系统，例如，不断提供反馈(例如，喜欢和不喜欢) ，直到系统认识到用户的意图。这项工作提出了一个新的推荐原型，称为用户可控推荐系统(UCRS) ，它使用户能够积极控制过滤气泡的缓解。在功能上，1) UCRS 可以提醒用户，如果他们深深陷入过滤泡。2) UCRS 支持四种控制命令，用户可以根据不同的粒度缓解气泡。3) UCRS 可以对控制措施做出响应，并在运行中调整建议。调整的关键在于阻止过时的用户表示对建议的影响，其中包含与控制命令不一致的历史信息。因此，我们开发了一个因果关系增强的用户可控推理(UCI)框架，它可以在推理阶段快速修改基于用户控制的推荐，并利用反事实推理来减轻过时用户表示的影响。在三个数据集上的实验验证了 UCI 框架基于用户控件能够有效地推荐更多期望的项目，在准确性和多样性方面都显示出良好的性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=User-controllable+Recommendation+Against+Filter+Bubbles)|1|

In the field of recommender systems, this issue is also widely observed, as known as temporal dynamics in user behavior. Furthermore, in the context of COVID-19 pandemic related contingencies, people shift their behavior patterns extremely and tend to imitate others' opinions. The changes in user behavior may not be always rational. Thus, irrational behavior may impair the knowledge learned by the algorithm. It can cause herd effects and aggravate the popularity bias in recommender systems due to the irrational behavior of users. However, related research usually pays attention to the concept drift of individuals and overlooks the synergistic effect among users in the same social group. We conduct a study on user behavior to detect the collaborative concept drifts among users. Also, we empirically study the increase of experience of individuals can weaken herding effects.

Supervised approaches for QPP, such as NeuralQPP [24] are often trained on pairs of queries to capture their relative retrieval performance. However, point-wise approaches, such as the recently proposed BERT-QPP [1], are generally preferable for efficiency reasons. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end neural cross-encoder-based approach that is trained pointwise on individual queries, but listwise over the top ranked documents (split into chunks). In contrast to prior work, the network is then trained to predict the number of relevant documents in each chunk for a given query. Our method is thus a split-n-merge technique that instead of predicting the likely number of relevant documents in the top-k [1], rather predicts the number of relevant documents for each fixed chunk size p (p < k) and then aggregates them for QPP on top-k.

Predicting future or missing hyperedges bears significant implications for many applications (e.g., collaboration and recipe recommendation). What makes hyperedge prediction particularly challenging is the vast number of non-hyperedge subsets, which grows exponentially with the number of nodes. Since it is prohibitive to use all of them as negative examples for model training, it is inevitable to sample a very small portion of them, and to this end, heuristic sampling schemes have been employed. However, trained models suffer from poor generalization capability for examples of different natures. In this paper, we propose AHP, an adversarial training-based hyperedge-prediction method. It learns to sample negative examples without relying on any heuristic schemes. Using six real hypergraphs, we show that AHP generalizes better to negative examples of various natures. It yields up to 28.2% higher AUROC than the best existing methods and often even outperforms its variants with sampling schemes tailored to test sets.|超图(即超边集合)自然地表示群体关系(例如，研究人员共同撰写一篇论文和一个食谱中的成分) ，每一个都对应于一个超边(即节点的子集)。预测未来或缺失的超边界对于许多应用程序(例如，协作和菜谱推荐)具有重要意义。使得超边缘预测特别具有挑战性的是大量的非超边缘子集，它们随着节点的数量呈指数增长。由于在模型训练中禁止使用所有的负例子，因此不可避免地需要对其中的一小部分进行抽样，为此，采用了启发式抽样方案。然而，经过训练的模型对于不同性质的例子的泛化能力较差。本文提出了一种基于对抗训练的 AHP 超边缘预测方法。它学习不依赖任何启发式方案来抽样否定的例子。利用六个实超图，我们证明了层次分析法能够更好地推广各种性质的负例子。与现有的最佳方法相比，它的 AUROC 提高了28.2% ，而且通常在根据测试集量身定制的抽样方案上甚至优于其变体。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=AHP:+Learning+to+Negative+Sample+for+Hyperedge+Prediction)|1|

Aside from its efficacy, explainability is also critical for developing a successful SR model, since it can improve the persuasiveness of the results, the users' satisfaction, and the debugging efficiency. However, the majority of current SR models are unexplainable and even those that claim to be interpretable cannot provide clear and convincing explanations of users' intentions and how they influence the models' decisions. To solve this problem, in this research, we propose a meta-path guided model which uses path instances to capture item dependencies, explicitly reveal the underlying motives, and illustrate the entire reasoning process. To begin with, our model explores meta-path guided instances and leverages the multi-head self-attention mechanism to disclose the hidden motivations beneath these path instances. To comprehensively model the user interest and interest shifting, we search paths in both adjacent and non-adjacent items. Then, we update item representations by incorporating the user-item interactions and meta-path-based context sequentially.

Particularly, AutoMTN uses the Transformer network to explicitly exploits connections of all the POIs along the trace. Besides, to discover the dependencies at the sub-sequence level and attend to cross-modal interactions between POI and category sequences, we replace self-attention in Transformer with the auto-correlation mechanism and design a multi-modal network.

First, there are no clear mappings between the GAN's latent space and useful semantic features, making it difficult for users to navigate. Second, the number of unique images that can be generated is exceptionally high, taxing the scaling properties of existing search algorithms. In this article, we present ROGUE, a system to support exploratory search of images generated from GANs. We demonstrate how to implement features that are commonly found in exploratory search interfaces, such as faceted search and relevance feedback, in the context of GAN search. We additionally use reinforcement learning to help users navigate the image space [8], trading off exploration (showing diverse images) and exploitation (showing images predicted to receive positive relevance feedback).

|[Searching for a New and Better Future of Work](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3532088)|Jaime Teevan|Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA|Search engines were one of the first intelligent cloud-based applications that people used to get things done, and they have since become an extremely important productivity tool. This is in part because much of what a person is doing when they search is thinking. Search engines do not merely support that thinking, however, but can also actually shape it. For example, some search results are more likely to spur learning than others and influence a person's future queries [1]. This means that as information retrieval researchers the new approaches that we develop can actively shape the future of work. The world is now in the middle of the most significant change to work practices in a generation, and it is one that will make search technology even more central to work in the years to come. For the past several millennia, space was the primary technology that people used to get things done. The coming Hybrid Work Era, however, will be shaped by digital technology. The recent rapid shift to remote work significantly accelerated the digital transformation already underway at many companies, and new types of work-related data are now being generated at an unprecedented rate. For example, the use of meeting recordings in Microsoft Stream has more than doubled from March 2020 to February 2022 [2]. Knowledge exists in this newly captured data, but figuring out how to make sense of it is overwhelming. The information retrieval community knows how to process large amounts of data, build usable intelligent systems, and learn from behavioral data, and we have a unique opportunity right now to apply this expertise to new corpora and in new scenarios in a meaningful way. In this talk I will give an overview of what research tells us about emerging work practices, and explore how the SIGIR community can build on these findings to help create a new - and better - future of work.|搜索引擎是人们用来完成工作的第一批基于云的智能应用程序之一，自那以后，它们已经成为极其重要的生产力工具。这在一定程度上是因为一个人在搜索时所做的大部分事情都是在思考。然而，搜索引擎不仅仅支持这种想法，而且实际上还可以塑造这种想法。例如，一些搜索结果比其他结果更有可能刺激学习，并影响一个人未来的查询[1]。这意味着，作为信息检索研究人员，我们开发的新方法可以积极地塑造未来的工作。这个世界现在正处于一代人以来最重大的工作实践变革之中，这将使搜索技术在未来几年的工作中变得更加重要。在过去的几千年里，太空是人们用来完成任务的主要技术。然而，即将到来的混合工作时代将由数字技术塑造。最近向远程工作的迅速转变极大地加速了许多公司已经在进行的数字化转变，现在正以前所未有的速度产生新类型的与工作有关的数据。例如，从2020年3月到2022年2月，微软 Stream 会议录音的使用量增加了一倍多[2]。知识存在于这些新捕获的数据中，但是弄清楚如何理解这些数据是非常困难的。信息检索社区知道如何处理大量的数据，构建可用的智能系统，并从行为数据中学习，我们现在有一个独特的机会，可以将这些专业知识以一种有意义的方式应用到新的语料库和新的场景中。在这个演讲中，我将概述研究告诉我们的新兴工作实践，并探讨 SIGIR 社区如何能够建立在这些发现的基础上，帮助创造一个新的、更好的工作未来。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Searching+for+a+New+and+Better+Future+of+Work)|1|
|[INMO: A Model-Agnostic and Scalable Module for Inductive Collaborative Filtering](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3532000)|Yunfan Wu, Qi Cao, Huawei Shen, Shuchang Tao, Xueqi Cheng|Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences & University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China|Collaborative filtering is one of the most common scenarios and popular research topics in recommender systems. Among existing methods, latent factor models, i.e., learning a specific embedding for each user/item by reconstructing the observed interaction matrix, have shown excellent performances. However, such user-specific and item-specific embeddings are intrinsically transductive, making it difficult for them to deal with new users and new items unseen during training. Besides, the number of model parameters heavily depends on the number of all users and items, restricting their scalability to real-world applications. To solve the above challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel model-agnostic and scalable Inductive Embedding Module for collaborative filtering, namely INMO. INMO generates the inductive embeddings for users (items) by characterizing their interactions with some template items (template users), instead of employing an embedding lookup table. Under the theoretical analysis, we further propose an effective indicator for the selection of template users and template items. Our proposed INMO can be attached to existing latent factor models as a pre-module, inheriting the expressiveness of backbone models, while bringing the inductive ability and reducing model parameters. We validate the generality of INMO by attaching it to Matrix Factorization (MF) and LightGCN, which are two representative latent factor models for collaborative filtering. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of INMO in both transductive and inductive recommendation scenarios.|协同过滤是推荐系统中最常见的场景和流行的研究主题之一。在已有的方法中，潜因子模型(即通过重构观察到的交互矩阵学习每个用户/项目的特定嵌入)表现出了良好的性能。然而，这种特定于用户和特定于项目的嵌入在本质上具有传导性，使他们难以处理培训期间看不到的新用户和新项目。此外，模型参数的数量很大程度上取决于所有用户和项目的数量，限制了它们对现实应用程序的可伸缩性。为了解决上述挑战，本文提出了一种新颖的模型无关性和可扩展性的感应嵌入模块，即 INMO 协同过滤。INMO 通过描述用户与某些模板项(模板用户)的交互来为用户(项)生成归纳嵌入，而不是使用嵌入查找表。在理论分析的基础上，进一步提出了模板用户和模板项选择的有效指标。我们提出的 INMO 可以作为一个预模块附加到现有的潜因子模型，继承骨干模型的表达能力，同时带来归纳能力和减少模型参数。我们通过将 INMO 附加到矩阵分解(MF)和 LightGCN (这两个是协同过滤的两个代表性潜在因素模型)来验证 INMO 的普遍性。对三个公共基准进行的广泛试验表明，INMO 在推导和归纳推荐两种情况下都具有有效性和效率。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=INMO:+A+Model-Agnostic+and+Scalable+Module+for+Inductive+Collaborative+Filtering)|1|

Current ConvQA systems operate over homogeneous sources of information: either a knowledge base (KB), or a text corpus, or a collection of tables. This paper addresses the novel issue of jointly tapping into all of these together, this way boosting answer coverage and confidence. We present CONVINSE, an end-to-end pipeline for ConvQA over heterogeneous sources, operating in three stages: i) learning an explicit structured representation of an incoming question and its conversational context, ii) harnessing this frame-like representation to uniformly capture relevant evidences from KB, text, and tables, and iii) running a fusion-in-decoder model to generate the answer. We construct and release the first benchmark, ConvMix, for ConvQA over heterogeneous sources, comprising 3000 real-user conversations with 16000 questions, along with entity annotations, completed question utterances, and question paraphrases.

However, the lack of attention to the partner makes the model more egocentric: they tend to show their persona by all means such as twisting the topic stiffly, pulling the conversation to their own interests regardless, and rambling their persona with little curiosity to the partner. In this work, we propose COSPLAY(COncept Set guided PersonaLized dialogue generation Across both partY personas) that considers both parties as a "team": expressing self-persona while keeping curiosity toward the partner, leading responses around mutual personas, and finding the common ground. Specifically, we first represent self-persona, partner persona and mutual dialogue all in the concept sets. Then, we propose the Concept Set framework with a suite of knowledge-enhanced operations to process them such as set algebras, set expansion, and set distance. Based on these operations as medium, we train the model by utilizing 1) concepts of both party personas, 2) concept relationship between them, and 3) their relationship to the future dialogue. Extensive experiments on a large public dataset, Persona-Chat, demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for generating less egocentric, more human-like, and higher quality responses in both automatic and human evaluations.|保持一致的人物角色对于构建类似人类的会话模型至关重要。然而，缺乏对伴侣的关注使得这种模式更加自我中心: 他们倾向于通过各种方式来展示自己的角色，比如僵硬地扭曲话题，不顾一切地把谈话拉向自己的兴趣，对伴侣毫无好奇心地胡扯自己的角色。在这项工作中，我们提出 COSPLAY (概念集引导的个性化对话生成跨越双方角色) ，认为双方是一个“团队”: 表达自我角色，同时保持对伴侣的好奇心，引导对相互角色的反应，并找到共同点。具体来说，我们首先在概念集中表现自我人格、伴侣人格和相互对话。然后，我们提出了概念集框架和一套知识增强操作来处理它们，例如集代数、集展开和集距离。基于这些操作作为媒介，我们利用1)双方角色的概念，2)他们之间的概念关系，3)他们与未来对话的关系来训练模型。在一个大型公共数据集“人物聊天”上进行的大量实验表明，我们的模型在自动和人工评估中产生更少的自我中心，更多的人性化和更高质量的响应方面优于最先进的基线。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=COSPLAY:+Concept+Set+Guided+Personalized+Dialogue+Generation+Across+Both+Party+Personas)|1|
|[KETCH: Knowledge Graph Enhanced Thread Recommendation in Healthcare Forums](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3532008)|Limeng Cui, Dongwon Lee|The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA|Health thread recommendation methods aim to suggest the most relevant existing threads for a user. Most of the existing methods tend to rely on modeling the post contents to retrieve relevant answers. However, some posts written by users with different clinical conditions can be lexically similar, as unrelated diseases (e.g., Angina and Osteoporosis) may have the same symptoms (e.g., back pain), yet irrelevant threads to a user. Therefore, it is critical to not only consider the connections between users and threads, but also the descriptions of users' symptoms and clinical conditions. In this paper, towards this problem of thread recommendation in online healthcare forums, we propose a knowledge graph enhanced Threads Recommendation (KETCH) model, which leverages graph neural networks to model the interactions among users and threads, and learn their representations. In our model, the users, threads and posts are three types of nodes in a graph, linked through their associations. KETCH uses the message passing strategy by aggregating information along with the network. In addition, we introduce a knowledge-enhanced attention mechanism to capture the latent conditions and symptoms. We also apply the method to the task of predicting the side effects of drugs, to show that KETCH has the potential to complement the medical knowledge graph. Comparing with the best results of seven competing methods, in terms of MRR, KETCH outperforms all methods by at least 0.125 on the MedHelp dataset, 0.048 on the Patient dataset and 0.092 on HealthBoards dataset, respectively. We release the source code of KETCH at: https://github.com/cuilimeng/KETCH.|健康线程推荐方法旨在为用户推荐最相关的现有线程。现有的大多数方法倾向于依赖于对文章内容进行建模来检索相关的答案。然而，不同临床状况的用户写的一些帖子在词汇上可能是相似的，因为不相关的疾病(如心绞痛和骨质疏松症)可能有相同的症状(如背痛) ，但对用户来说是不相关的。因此，不仅要考虑用户和线程之间的连接，还要考虑用户症状和临床状况的描述。针对在线医疗论坛中的线程推荐问题，提出了一种知识图增强型线程推荐(KETCH)模型，该模型利用图神经网络对用户和线程之间的交互进行建模，并学习用户和线程之间的表示。在我们的模型中，用户、线程和帖子是图中的三种类型的节点，通过它们的关联进行链接。KETCH 通过将信息与网络一起聚合来使用消息传递策略。此外，我们还引入了一种知识增强的注意机制来捕捉潜在的条件和症状。我们还将该方法应用于预测药物副作用的任务，表明 KETCH 具有补充医学知识图谱的潜力。与七种竞争方法的最佳结果相比，就 MRR 而言，KETCH 在 MedHelp 数据集上至少优于所有方法0.125，在患者数据集上优于0.048，在 HealthBoards 数据集上优于0.092。我们在 https://github.com/cuilimeng/KETCH 发布 KETCH 的源代码。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=KETCH:+Knowledge+Graph+Enhanced+Thread+Recommendation+in+Healthcare+Forums)|1|
|[Explainable Legal Case Matching via Inverse Optimal Transport-based Rationale Extraction](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531974)|Weijie Yu, Zhongxiang Sun, Jun Xu, Zhenhua Dong, Xu Chen, Hongteng Xu, JiRong Wen|Huawei Noah's Ark Lab, Shenzhen, China; Renmin University of China, Beijing, China|As an essential operation of legal retrieval, legal case matching plays a central role in intelligent legal systems. This task has a high demand on the explainability of matching results because of its critical impacts on downstream applications --- the matched legal cases may provide supportive evidence for the judgments of target cases and thus influence the fairness and justice of legal decisions. Focusing on this challenging task, we propose a novel and explainable method, namely IOT-Match, with the help of computational optimal transport, which formulates the legal case matching problem as an inverse optimal transport (IOT) problem. Different from most existing methods, which merely focus on the sentence-level semantic similarity between legal cases, our IOT-Match learns to extract rationales from paired legal cases based on both semantics and legal characteristics of their sentences. The extracted rationales are further applied to generate faithful explanations and conduct matching. Moreover, the proposed IOT-Match is robust to the alignment label insufficiency issue commonly in practical legal case matching tasks, which is suitable for both supervised and semi-supervised learning paradigms. To demonstrate the superiority of our IOT-Match method and construct a benchmark of explainable legal case matching task, we not only extend the well-known Challenge of AI in Law (CAIL) dataset but also build a new Explainable Legal cAse Matching (ELAM) dataset, which contains lots of legal cases with detailed and explainable annotations. Experiments on these two datasets show that our IOT-Match outperforms state-of-the-art methods consistently on matching prediction, rationale extraction, and explanation generation.|法律案件匹配作为法律检索的一项基本操作，在智能法律系统中起着核心作用。这项任务对匹配结果的解释性要求很高，因为它对下游应用产生了重要影响——匹配的法律案件可以为目标案件的判决提供支持性证据，从而影响法律判决的公正性和正义性。针对这一具有挑战性的任务，我们提出了一种新颖的解释方法，即物联网匹配(IOT-Match) ，借助于计算最优传输，将法律案例匹配问题表述为一个逆最优传输(IOT)问题。不同于现有的方法，我们的 IOT-Match 仅仅着眼于法律案件之间的句子层面的语义相似性，而是学习从成对的法律案件中根据其句子的语义和法律特征提取理据。提取的理论基础进一步应用于产生忠实的解释和进行匹配。此外，建议的物联网匹配对于实际案例匹配任务中常见的校准标签不足问题具有稳健性，适用于监督范式和半监督学习范式。为了证明我们的物联网匹配方法的优越性，构建一个可解释的法律案例匹配任务的基准，我们不仅扩展了著名的 CAIL 数据集，而且建立了一个新的可解释的法律案例匹配(ELAM)数据集，其中包含了大量的法律案例和详细的可解释的注释。在这两个数据集上的实验表明，我们的 IOT-Match 方法在匹配预测、理论提取和解释生成方面都优于最先进的方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Explainable+Legal+Case+Matching+via+Inverse+Optimal+Transport-based+Rationale+Extraction)|1|
|[Optimizing Generalized Gini Indices for Fairness in Rankings](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3532035)|Virginie Do, Nicolas Usunier|Meta AI Research & Université Paris Dauphine-PSL, Paris, France; Meta AI Research, Paris, France|There is growing interest in designing recommender systems that aim at being fair towards item producers or their least satisfied users. Inspired by the domain of inequality measurement in economics, this paper explores the use of generalized Gini welfare functions (GGFs) as a means to specify the normative criterion that recommender systems should optimize for. GGFs weight individuals depending on their ranks in the population, giving more weight to worse-off individuals to promote equality. Depending on these weights, GGFs minimize the Gini index of item exposure to promote equality between items, or focus on the performance on specific quantiles of least satisfied users. GGFs for ranking are challenging to optimize because they are non-differentiable. We resolve this challenge by leveraging tools from non-smooth optimization and projection operators used in differentiable sorting. We present experiments using real datasets with up to 15k users and items, which show that our approach obtains better trade-offs than the baselines on a variety of recommendation tasks and fairness criteria.|人们对设计推荐系统越来越感兴趣，这种系统旨在公平对待项目生产者或其最不满意的用户。受经济学中不平等测度领域的启发，本文探讨了广义基尼福利函数(GGFs)作为指定推荐系统优化标准的一种方法。GGFs 根据个体在人口中的等级来衡量个体的重量，将更多的重量赋予经济状况较差的个体，以促进平等。根据这些权重，GGFs 最小化项目曝光的基尼指数，以促进项目之间的平等，或者关注最不满意用户的特定分位数的性能。用于排名的 GGF 很难优化，因为它们是不可微的。我们通过利用非光滑优化工具和可微排序中使用的投影运算符来解决这一挑战。我们提出的实验使用真实的数据集多达15000个用户和项目，这表明我们的方法获得更好的权衡比基线的各种推荐任务和公平性标准。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Optimizing+Generalized+Gini+Indices+for+Fairness+in+Rankings)|1|

Fully supervised methods need complete temporal boundary annotations to achieve promising results, which is costly since the annotator needs to watch the whole moment. Weakly supervised methods only rely on the paired video and query, but the performance is relatively poor. In this paper, we look closer into the annotation process and propose a new paradigm called "glance annotation". This paradigm requires the timestamp of only one single random frame, which we refer to as a "glance", within the temporal boundary of the fully supervised counterpart. We argue this is beneficial because comparing to weak supervision, trivial cost is added yet more potential in performance is provided. Under the glance annotation setting, we propose a method named as Video moment retrieval via Glance Annotation (ViGA) based on contrastive learning. ViGA cuts the input video into clips and contrasts between clips and queries, in which glance guided Gaussian distributed weights are assigned to all clips. Our extensive experiments indicate that ViGA achieves better results than the state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods by a large margin, even comparable to fully supervised methods in some cases.|视频矩检索的目的是查找给定的自然语言查询所描述的矩(视频的一部分)的开始和结束时间戳。完全监督的方法需要完整的时间边界注释来获得有希望的结果，这是昂贵的，因为注释者需要观察整个时刻。弱监督方法只依赖于配对视频和查询，但性能相对较差。在本文中，我们仔细研究了注释过程，并提出了一个新的范式称为“一瞥注释”。这个范例只需要一个随机帧的时间戳，我们称之为“一瞥”，在完全监督的对应物的时间边界内。我们认为这是有益的，因为相对于薄弱的监督，微不足道的成本增加了更多的性能潜力提供。在目视注释设置下，提出了一种基于对比学习的目视注释视频矩检索方法。ViGA 将输入的视频剪切成片段，并在片段和查询之间进行对比，给所有片段分配目视导引的高斯分布权值。我们的大量实验表明，ViGA 比最先进的弱监督方法获得了更好的结果，甚至在某些情况下可以与全监督方法相媲美。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Video+Moment+Retrieval+from+Text+Queries+via+Single+Frame+Annotation)|1|

Previous methods tend to perform self-modal learning and cross-modal interaction in a coarse manner, which neglect fine-grained clues contained in video content, query context, and their alignment. To this end, we propose a novel Multi-Granularity Perception Network (MGPN) that perceives intra-modality and inter-modality information at a multi-granularity level. Specifically, we formulate moment retrieval as a multi-choice reading comprehension task and integrate human reading strategies into our framework. A coarse-grained feature encoder and a co-attention mechanism are utilized to obtain a preliminary perception of intra-modality and inter-modality information. Then a fine-grained feature encoder and a conditioned interaction module are introduced to enhance the initial perception inspired by how humans address reading comprehension problems. Moreover, to alleviate the huge computation burden of some existing methods, we further design an efficient choice comparison module and reduce the hidden size with imperceptible quality loss.

Opinion tags reflect key characteristics of product reviews and help users quickly understand their content in e-commerce portals. The task of abstractive opinion tagging has previously been proposed to automatically generate a ranked list of opinion tags for a given review. However, current models for opinion tagging are not personalized, even though personalization is an essential ingredient of engaging user interactions, especially in e-commerce. In this paper, we focus on the task of personalized abstractive opinion tagging. There are two main challenges when developing models for the end-to-end generation of personalized opinion tags: sparseness of reviews and difficulty to integrate multi-type signals, i.e., explicit review signals and implicit behavioral signals. To address these challenges, we propose an end-to-end model, named POT, that consists of three main components: (1) a review-based explicit preference tracker component based on a hierarchical heterogeneous review graph to track user preferences from reviews; (2)a behavior-based implicit preference tracker component using a heterogeneous behavior graph to track the user preferences from implicit behaviors; and (3) a personalized rank-aware tagging component to generate a ranked sequence of personalized opinion tags.

|[P3 Ranker: Mitigating the Gaps between Pre-training and Ranking Fine-tuning with Prompt-based Learning and Pre-finetuning](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531786)|Xiaomeng Hu, Shi Yu, Chenyan Xiong, Zhenghao Liu, Zhiyuan Liu, Ge Yu|Northeastern University, Shenyang, China; Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA; Tsinghua University, Beijing, China|Compared to other language tasks, applying pre-trained language models (PLMs) for search ranking often requires more nuances and training signals. In this paper, we identify and study the two mismatches between pre-training and ranking fine-tuning: the training schema gap regarding the differences in training objectives and model architectures, and the task knowledge gap considering the discrepancy between the knowledge needed in ranking and that learned during pre-training. To mitigate these gaps, we propose Pre-trained, Prompt-learned and Pre-finetuned Neural Ranker (P3 Ranker). P3 Ranker leverages prompt-based learning to convert the ranking task into a pre-training like schema and uses pre-finetuning to initialize the model on intermediate supervised tasks. Experiments on MS MARCO and Robust04 show the superior performances of P3 Ranker in few-shot ranking. Analyses reveal that P3 Ranker is able to better accustom to the ranking task through prompt-based learning and retrieve necessary ranking-oriented knowledge gleaned in pre-finetuning, resulting in data-efficient PLM adaptation.

Next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is one of the most important tasks in LBSNs, aiming to make personalized recommendations of next suitable locations to users by discovering preferences from users' historical activities. Noticeably, LBSNs have offered unparalleled access to abundant heterogeneous relational information about users and POIs (including user-user social relations, such as families or colleagues; and user-POI visiting relations). Such relational information holds great potential to facilitate the next POI recommendation. However, most existing methods either focus on merely the user-POI visits, or handle different relations based on over-simplified assumptions while neglecting relational heterogeneities. To fill these critical voids, we propose a novel framework, MEMO, which effectively utilizes the heterogeneous relations with a multi-network representation learning module, and explicitly incorporates the inter-temporal user-POI mutual influence with the coupled recurrent neural networks. Extensive experiments on real-world LBSN data validate the superiority of our framework over the state-of-the-art next POI recommendation methods.|随着移动设备和网络应用的广泛应用，基于位置的社交网络(LBSNs)提供了大规模的个人层面的位置相关活动和体验。下一个兴趣点(POI)推荐是 LBSNs 中最重要的任务之一，目的是通过发现用户历史活动的偏好，为用户提供下一个合适位置的个性化推荐。值得注意的是，LBSNs 提供了对关于用户和 POI (包括用户-用户社会关系，如家庭或同事; 以及用户-POI 访问关系)的大量异构关系信息的无与伦比的访问。这样的关系信息对于促进下一个 POI 建议具有很大的潜力。然而，大多数现有的方法要么仅仅关注用户 POI 访问，要么在过于简化的假设基础上处理不同的关系，而忽略了关系异构性。为了填补这些关键空白，我们提出了一种新的框架 MEMO，它有效地利用了多网络表示学习模块的异构关系，并将用户间 POI 的相互影响明确地与耦合的递归神经网络结合起来。对实际 LBSN 数据的大量实验验证了该框架相对于下一代 POI 推荐方法的优越性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Empowering+Next+POI+Recommendation+with+Multi-Relational+Modeling)|1|

These models are fundamentally different from the decision tree models and behave differently with respect to different loss functions.

Argumentative questions ask for reasons to support a certain stance on a controversial topic, such as ''Should marijuana be legalized?'' Controversial topics entail opposing stances, and hence can be supported or opposed by various arguments. Argumentative questions pose a challenge for search engines since they should be answered with both pro and con arguments in order to not bias a user toward a certain stance. To further analyze the problem, we sampled questions about 19 controversial topics from a large Yandex search log and let human annotators label them as one of factual, method, or argumentative. The result is a collection of 39,340 labeled questions, 28% of which are argumentative, demonstrating the need to develop dedicated systems for this type of questions. A comparative analysis of the three question types shows that asking for reasons and predictions are among the most important features of argumentative questions. To demonstrate the feasibility of the classification task, we developed a BERT-based classifier to map questions to the question types, reaching a promising macro-averaged F>sub>1-score of 0.78.|我们提出了一种识别网络搜索查询中争议性问题的方法。有争议的问题会询问支持某种立场的理由，比如“大麻是否应该合法化?”有争议的话题包含相反的立场，因此可以支持或反对的各种论点。争议性问题对搜索引擎来说是一个挑战，因为它们应该同时回答正反两方面的争议，以避免用户偏向某一立场。为了进一步分析这个问题，我们从一个大型 Yandex 搜索日志中抽取了19个有争议话题的问题，并让人工注释者将它们标记为事实、方法或论证性的问题。结果是收集了39,340个带标签的问题，其中28% 是有争议的，表明需要为这类问题开发专门的系统。对三种问题类型的比较分析表明，提问原因和预测是议论题的最重要特征之一。为了验证分类任务的可行性，我们开发了一个基于 BERT 的分类器来将问题映射到问题类型，得到了一个很有前途的宏观平均 F > 小于1的得分为0.78。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Identifying+Argumentative+Questions+in+Web+Search+Logs)|1|

Among GBRSs, the information from each user and item's multi-hop neighbours is effectively conveyed between nodes through neighbourhood aggregation and message passing. Although effective, existing neighbourhood information aggregation and passing functions are usually computationally expensive. Motivated by the emerging contrastive learning technique, we design a simple neighbourhood construction method in conjunction with the contrastive objective function to simulate the neighbourhood information processing of GNN. In addition, we propose a simple algorithm based on Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for learning users and items' representations with extra non-linearity while lowering computational burden compared with multi-layers GNNs. Our extensive empirical experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our proposed model, i.e. MLP-CGRec, can reduce the GPU memory consumption and training time by up to 24.0% and 33.1%, respectively, without significantly degenerating the recommendation accuracy in comparison with competitive baselines.|基于图形的推荐系统(GBRS)通过使用图形神经网络(GNN)结合用户项二分图已经取得了良好的性能。在 GBRS 中，每个用户和项目的多跳邻居信息通过邻居聚合和消息传递在节点之间有效地传递。虽然有效，但现有的邻里信息聚合和传递函数通常计算开销很大。受新兴的对比学习技术的启发，我们设计了一种简单的邻域构造方法，结合对比目标函数来模拟 GNN 的邻域信息处理。此外，我们提出了一个简单的基于多层感知机(MLP)的学习算法，用于学习用户和项目的额外非线性表示，同时与多层 GNN 相比，降低了计算负担。我们在三个公共数据集上的广泛实验表明，我们提出的模型，即 MLP-CGRec，可以分别减少 GPU 内存消耗和训练时间高达24.0% 和33.1% ，与竞争性基线相比，不会显着降低推荐准确性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=An+MLP-based+Algorithm+for+Efficient+Contrastive+Graph+Recommendations)|1|

|[A Meta-learning Approach to Fair Ranking](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531892)|Yuan Wang, Zhiqiang Tao, Yi Fang|Santa Clara University, Santa Clara, CA, USA|In recent years, the fairness in information retrieval (IR) system has received increasing research attention. While the data-driven ranking models achieve significant improvements over traditional methods, the dataset used to train such models is usually biased, which causes unfairness in the ranking models. For example, the collected imbalance dataset on the subject of the expert search usually leads to systematic discrimination on the specific demographic groups such as race, gender, etc, which further reduces the exposure for the minority group. To solve this problem, we propose a Meta-learning based Fair Ranking (MFR) model that could alleviate the data bias for protected groups through an automatically-weighted loss. Specifically, we adopt a meta-learning framework to explicitly train a meta-learner from an unbiased sampled dataset (meta-dataset), and simultaneously, train a listwise learning-to-rank (LTR) model on the whole (biased) dataset governed by "fair" loss weights. The meta-learner serves as a weighting function to make the ranking loss attend more on the minority group. To update the parameters of the weighting function and the ranking model, we formulate the proposed MFR as a bilevel optimization problem and solve it using the gradients through gradients. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a comparable ranking performance and significantly improves the fairness metric compared with state-of-the-art methods.|近年来，信息检索制度的公平性越来越受到研究人员的关注。虽然数据驱动的排序模型比传统的方法有了显著的改进，但是用于训练这些模型的数据集往往存在偏差，从而导致排序模型的不公平性。例如，所收集的关于专家搜索主题的不平衡数据集通常导致对特定人口群体如种族、性别等的系统性歧视，从而进一步减少少数群体的暴露程度。为了解决这一问题，我们提出了一种基于元学习的公平排序(MFR)模型，该模型通过自动加权损失来减轻受保护群体的数据偏差。具体而言，我们采用元学习框架来显式地从无偏的采样数据集(元数据集)中训练元学习者，同时在受“公平”损失权重管理的整个(有偏的)数据集上训练列表学习到排名(LTR)模型。元学习者作为一个权重函数，使排名的损失更多地出现在少数群体中。为了更新权重函数和排名模型的参数，我们将建议的最小生成最佳化问题(mFR)表示为一个双层次模型，并使用梯度来解决这个问题。在实际数据集上的实验结果表明，与现有方法相比，该方法具有可比较的排序性能，并显著提高了公平性度量。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=A+Meta-learning+Approach+to+Fair+Ranking)|1|

|[Asyncval: A Toolkit for Asynchronously Validating Dense Retriever Checkpoints During Training](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531658)|Shengyao Zhuang, Guido Zuccon|The University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia|The process of model checkpoint validation refers to the evaluation of the performance of a model checkpoint executed on a held-out portion of the training data while learning the hyperparameters of the model. This model checkpoint validation process is used to avoid over-fitting and determine when the model has converged so as to stop training. A simple and efficient strategy to validate deep learning checkpoints is the addition of validation loops to execute during training. However, the validation of dense retrievers (DR) checkpoints is not as trivial -- and the addition of validation loops is not efficient. This is because, in order to accurately evaluate the performance of a DR checkpoint, the whole document corpus needs to be encoded into vectors using the current checkpoint before any actual retrieval operation for checkpoint validation can be performed. This corpus encoding process can be very time-consuming if the document corpus contains millions of documents (e.g., 8.8M for MS MARCO v1 and 21M for Natural Questions). Thus, a naïve use of validation loops during training will significantly increase training time. To address this issue, we propose Asyncval: a Python-based toolkit for efficiently validating DR checkpoints during training. Instead of pausing the training loop for validating DR checkpoints, Asyncval decouples the validation loop from the training loop, uses another GPU to automatically validate new DR checkpoints and thus permits to perform validation asynchronously from training. Asyncval also implements a range of different corpus subset sampling strategies for validating DR checkpoints; these strategies allow to further speed up the validation process. We provide an investigation of these methods in terms of their impact on validation time and validation fidelity. Asyncval is made available as an open-source project at https://github.com/ielab/asyncval.|模型检查点验证过程是指在学习模型超参数的同时，对在训练数据的保持部分上执行的模型检查点的性能进行评估。该模型检查点验证过程用于避免过拟合，判断模型何时收敛，从而停止训练。验证深度学习检查点的一个简单而有效的策略是在训练期间添加验证循环来执行。然而，密集检索器(DR)检查点的验证并不那么简单——并且添加验证循环的效率也不高。这是因为，为了准确地评估 DR 检查点的性能，在执行检查点验证的任何实际检索操作之前，需要使用当前检查点将整个文档语料库编码到向量中。如果文档语料库包含数百万个文档(例如，MS MARCO v1为8.8 M，自然问题为21M) ，那么这个语料库编码过程可能非常耗时。因此，在训练期间天真地使用验证循环将显著增加训练时间。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了 Asyncval: 一个基于 Python 的工具包，用于在培训期间有效地验证 DR 检查点。Asyncval 没有暂停用于验证 DR 检查点的训练循环，而是将验证循环与训练循环解耦，使用另一个 GPU 自动验证新的 DR 检查点，从而允许从训练中异步执行验证。Asyncval 还实现了一系列不同的语料库子集采样策略来验证 DR 检查点; 这些策略允许进一步加快验证过程。我们根据这些方法对验证时间和验证保真度的影响对它们进行了研究。Asyncval 作为一个开源项目在 https://github.com/ielab/Asyncval 上可以使用。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Asyncval:+A+Toolkit+for+Asynchronously+Validating+Dense+Retriever+Checkpoints+During+Training)|1|

However, most existing recommendation models follow a supervised learning manner, which notably limits their representation ability with the ubiquitous sparse and noisy data in practical applications. Recently, self-supervised learning (SSL) has become a promising learning paradigm to distill informative knowledge from unlabeled data, without the heavy reliance on sufficient supervision signals. Inspired by the effectiveness of self-supervised learning, recent efforts bring SSL's superiority into various recommendation representation learning scenarios with augmented auxiliary learning tasks. In this tutorial, we aim to provide a systemic review of existing self-supervised learning frameworks and analyze the corresponding challenges for various recommendation scenarios, such as general collaborative filtering paradigm, social recommendation, sequential recommendation, and multi-behavior recommendation. We then raise discussions and future directions of this area. With the introduction of this emerging and promising topic, we expect the audience to have a deep understanding of this domain. We also seek to promote more ideas and discussions, which facilitates the development of self-supervised learning recommendation techniques.|推荐系统已成为一系列网上应用程式(例如电子商贸网站、影片分享平台、生活方式应用程式等)的重要组成部分，以纾缓信息超载及为使用者提供建议。然而，现有的大多数推荐模型都遵循监督式学习的方式，这明显地限制了它们在实际应用中对普遍存在的稀疏和嘈杂数据的表示能力。近年来，自监督学习(SSL)已成为从未标记数据中提取信息知识的一种很有前途的学习方法，而不需要过多地依赖于足够的监督信号。受自我监督学习效果的启发，最近的研究将 SSL 的优越性应用到各种推荐表示学习场景中，并增加了辅助学习任务。在本教程中，我们的目标是提供一个现有的自我监督学习框架的系统回顾，并分析各种推荐场景的相应挑战，如一般协同过滤范式，社会推荐，顺序推荐和多行为推荐。然后，我们提出这一领域的讨论和未来方向。随着这个新兴的和有前途的主题的介绍，我们希望听众对这个领域有一个深刻的理解。我们也寻求促进更多的想法和讨论，以促进自我监督学习推荐技术的发展。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Self-Supervised+Learning+for+Recommender+System)|1|

|[Generating Knowledge-based Explanation for Recommendation from Review](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531683)|Zuoxi Yang|South China University of Technology, Tianhe, Guangzhou, China|Reasonable explanation is helpful to increase the trust and satisfaction of user to the recommender system. Among many previous studies, there is growing concern about generating explanation based on review text. Collaborative filtering is one of the most successful approaches to predict user's preference. However, most of them suffer from data sparsity problem. Researcher often utilizes auxiliary data to address this problem, such as review, knowledge graph (KG), image and so on. Some researchers have proven that recommendation accuracy can be improved via incorporating rating and review data. Besides, neural network is also applied to learn more powerful representations for user and item from the review data. For example, convolution neural network (CNN) is used to extract representation from review text by using convolutional filters. Recurrent neural network (RNN) is another widely used model, which can encode the sequential behaviours as hidden states. However, most of them lack the ability to generate explanation. In order to generate explanation, there are two main approaches are used, i.e., template-based approach and generation-based approach. It is usually necessary for the templated-based approach to define serval templates. Then, these templates will be further filled with different personalized features/words. Although they can offer readable explanations, they rely heavily on pre-defined templates. It causes large manual efforts, limiting their explanation expression. Due to the strong generation ability of natural language model, the generation-based approach is capable to generate explanation without templates, which can largely enhance the expression of the generated sentence. Although they can generate more free and flexible explanation, the explanation might tend to be uninformative. To tackle these challenges of the above-mentioned work, we propose a Generating Knowldge-based Explanation for Recommendation from Review (GKER) to provide informative explanation. Unlike the traditional generation-based approach with a multi-task framework, we design a single-task framework to simultaneously model user's preference and explanation generation. The multi-task training usually needs more manual effort and time overhead. In this unitary framework, we inject the user's sentiment preference into the explanation generation, aiming at capturing the user's interest while producing high-quality explanation. Specifically, we build three graphs, including a bipartite graph, a KG and a co-occur graph. All of them are integrated to form a unitary graph, thus bringing the semantic among user-item interaction, KG and review. Based on this integrated graph, it is possible to learn more effective representations for user and item. To make better use of the integrated KG, a graph convolution network (GCN) is utilized to obtain improved embeddings due to its superior representation learning ability. We argue that these embeddings can contain more semantic interaction signals with the help of the integrated KG and GCN. After obtaining these extensive embeddings, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) layer is further employed to capture non-linear interaction signals between user and item, aiming at predicting user's rating accurately. The predicted rating would be regarded as a sentiment indicator to explore why the user likes or dislikes the target item. To investigate the association between sentiment indicator and the related review data, a transformer-enhanced encoder-decoder architecture is designed to produce informative and topic-relevant explanation. Besides, the aspect semantic is added in this architecture through an attention mechanism. In this framework, the transformer is utilized as a "teacher" model to supervise the generation of the encoder-decoder process. Finally, experiments conducted on three datasets have shown the state-of-the-art performance of GKER. There are some research issues for discussion: 1) although KG is a useful tool for recommendation accuracy and explainability, it is always incomplete in the real world. Hence, it is worth completing it for the recommendation. 2) Besides, as for explainable, it still needs more metrics to evaluate the quality of its explanation.|合理的解释有助于提高用户对推荐系统的信任和满意度。在以往的许多研究中，人们越来越关注基于评论文本生成解释。协同过滤是预测用户偏好最成功的方法之一。然而，它们中的大多数都存在数据稀疏问题。研究人员经常利用辅助数据来解决这个问题，如复习、知识图(KG)、图像等。一些研究人员已经证明，通过整合评分和评论数据，可以提高推荐的准确性。此外，还应用神经网络从复习数据中学习更强大的用户和项目表示。例如，卷积神经网络(CNN)通过使用卷积滤波器从复习文本中提取表示。递归神经网络(RNN)是另一种广泛使用的模型，它可以将序列行为编码为隐藏状态。然而，他们中的大多数缺乏产生解释的能力。为了产生解释，主要使用了两种方法，即基于模板的方法和基于生成的方法。基于模板的方法通常需要定义几个模板。然后，这些模板将进一步填充不同的个性化特征/词语。尽管它们可以提供可读的解释，但它们严重依赖于预定义的模板。它导致大量的人工操作，限制了它们的解释表达。由于自然语言模型具有很强的生成能力，基于生成的方法能够在没有模板的情况下生成解释，从而大大提高了生成句子的表达能力。虽然他们可以产生更自由和灵活的解释，解释可能往往是无益的。为了应对上述工作的这些挑战，我们提出了一个基于知识生成的评审推荐解释(GKER)来提供信息解释。与传统的基于生成的多任务框架方法不同，我们设计了一个单任务框架来同时模拟用户的偏好和解释生成。多任务训练通常需要更多的人工努力和时间开销。在这个统一的框架中，我们将用户的情感偏好引入到解释生成中，目的是在获取用户兴趣的同时生成高质量的解释。具体来说，我们构造了三个图，包括一个二部图、一个 KG 图和一个共现图。它们集成在一起形成一个统一的图形，从而实现了用户-项目交互、 KG 和评论之间的语义关系。基于这个集成图表，可以学习更有效的表示用户和项目。为了更好地利用集成 KG，利用图卷积网络(GCN)优越的表示学习能力来获得改进的嵌入。我们认为，这些嵌入可以包含更多的语义交互信号的帮助下，整合 KG 和 GCN。在获得这些广泛的嵌入之后，一个多层感知机(MLP)层被进一步用来捕获用户和项目之间的非线性交互信号，旨在准确预测用户的评分。预测的评分将被视为一个情绪指标，以探索为什么用户喜欢或不喜欢的目标项目。为了研究情绪指标与相关评论数据之间的关联，设计了一个变压器增强型编解码器结构，以产生信息丰富和与主题相关的解释。此外，通过注意机制在体系结构中添加了方面语义。在这个框架中，变压器被用作“教师”模型来监督编码器-解码器过程的生成。最后，在三个数据集上进行的实验显示了 GKER 的最新性能。有一些研究问题值得讨论: 1)虽然 KG 是一个有效的推荐准确性和可解释性的工具，但在现实世界中它总是不完整的。因此，为了获得推荐，完成它是值得的。2)对于可解释性，还需要更多的指标来评价其解释的质量。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Generating+Knowledge-based+Explanation+for+Recommendation+from+Review)|1|
|[Improving Fairness and Transparency for Artists in Music Recommender Systems](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531681)|Karlijn Dinnissen|Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands|Streaming services have become one of today's main sources of music consumption, with music recommender systems (MRS) as important components. The MRS' choices strongly influence what users consume, and vice versa. Therefore, there is a growing interest in ensuring the fairness of these choices for all stakeholders involved. Firstly, for users, unfairness might result in some users receiving lower-quality recommendations in terms of accuracy and coverage. Secondly, item provider (i.e. artist) unfairness might result in some artists receiving less exposure, and therefore less revenue. However, it is challenging to improve fairness without a decrease in, for instance, overall recommendation quality or user satisfaction. Additional complications arise when balancing possibly domain-specific objectives for multiple stakeholders at once. While fairness research exists from both the user and artist perspective in the music domain, there is a lack of research directly consulting artists---with Ferraro et al. (2021) as an exception. When interacting with recommendation systems and evaluating their fairness, the many factors influencing recommendation system decisions can cause another difficulty: lack of transparency. Artists indicate they would appreciate more transparency in MRS---both towards the user and themselves. While e.g. Millecamp et al. (2019) use explanations to increase transparency for MRS users, to the best of our knowledge, no research has addressed improving transparency for artists this way.|流媒体服务已经成为当今音乐消费的主要来源之一，音乐推荐系统(MRS)是其中的重要组成部分。MRS 的选择强烈地影响用户的消费，反之亦然。因此，确保这些选择对所有相关利益攸关方的公平性越来越受到关注。首先，对于用户来说，不公平可能会导致一些用户在准确性和覆盖率方面得到低质量的推荐。其次，项目提供者(即艺术家)的不公平可能导致一些艺术家获得较少的曝光率，从而减少收入。然而，在不降低例如整体推荐质量或用户满意度的情况下提高公平性是具有挑战性的。当同时为多个涉众平衡可能的领域特定目标时，会出现额外的复杂性。虽然公平性研究存在于音乐领域的用户和艺术家两个角度，但缺乏直接咨询艺术家的研究——费拉罗等人(2021)是一个例外。当与推荐系统进行交互并评估其公平性时，影响推荐系统决策的诸多因素会导致另一个困难: 缺乏透明度。艺术家们表示，他们希望 MRS 更加透明——无论是对用户还是对他们自己。虽然 Millecamp 等人(2019)使用解释来增加 MRS 用户的透明度，据我们所知，还没有研究以这种方式提高艺术家的透明度。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Improving+Fairness+and+Transparency+for+Artists+in+Music+Recommender+Systems)|1|
|[Exploring Modular Task Decomposition in Cross-domain Named Entity Recognition](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531976)|Xinghua Zhang, Bowen Yu, Yubin Wang, Tingwen Liu, Taoyu Su, Hongbo Xu|Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences & University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China|Cross-domain Named Entity Recognition (NER) aims to transfer knowledge from the source domain to the target, alleviating expensive labeling costs in the target domain. Most prior studies acquire domain-invariant features under the end-to-end sequence-labeling framework where each token is assigned a compositional label (e.g., B-LOC). However, the complexity of cross-domain transfer may be increased over this complicated labeling scheme, which leads to sub-optimal results, especially when there are significantly distinct entity categories across domains. In this paper, we aim to explore the task decomposition in cross-domain NER. Concretely, we suggest a modular learning approach in which two sub-tasks (entity span detection and type classification) are learned by separate functional modules to perform respective cross-domain transfer with corresponding strategies. Compared with the compositional labeling scheme, the label spaces are smaller and closer across domains especially in entity span detection, leading to easier transfer in each sub-task. And then we combine two sub-tasks to achieve the final result with modular interaction mechanism, and deploy the adversarial regularization for generalized and robust learning in low-resource target domains. Extensive experiments over 10 diverse domain pairs demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to state-of-the-art cross-domain NER methods in an end-to-end fashion (about average 6.4% absolute F1 score increase). Further analyses show the effectiveness of modular task decomposition and its great potential in cross-domain NER.|跨域命名实体识别(NER)旨在将知识从源域传递到目标域，减少目标域中昂贵的标记代价。大多数先前的研究在端到端序列标记框架下获得域不变特征，其中每个标记被分配一个组合标签(例如，B-LOC)。然而，这种复杂的标记方案可能会增加跨域传输的复杂性，从而导致次优结果，特别是当跨域存在明显不同的实体类别时。本文旨在研究跨域 NER 中的任务分解问题。具体地说，我们提出了一种模块化学习方法，其中两个子任务(实体跨度检测和类型分类)由不同的功能模块学习，以执行各自的跨域传输和相应的策略。与组合标记方案相比，标记空间更小，跨域更紧密，特别是在实体跨度检测中，使得每个子任务之间的传递更加容易。然后将两个子任务结合起来，采用模块化交互机制实现最终结果，并在低资源目标域上部署广义鲁棒学习的对抗正则化。超过10个不同域对的广泛实验表明，所提出的方法以端到端的方式优于最先进的跨域 NER 方法(平均绝对 F1评分增加约6.4%)。进一步的分析表明模块化任务分解的有效性及其在跨域 NER 中的巨大潜力。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Exploring+Modular+Task+Decomposition+in+Cross-domain+Named+Entity+Recognition)|1|

Existing studies in this task attach more attention to the sequence modeling of sentences while largely ignoring the rich domain-invariant semantics embedded in graph structures (i.e., the part-of-speech tags and dependency relations). As an important aspect of exploring characteristics of language comprehension, adaptive graph representations have played an essential role in recent years. To this end, in the paper, we aim to explore the possibility of learning invariant semantic features from graph-like structures in CDSC. Specifically, we present Graph Adaptive Semantic Transfer (GAST) model, an adaptive syntactic graph embedding method that is able to learn domain-invariant semantics from both word sequences and syntactic graphs. More specifically, we first raise a POS-Transformer module to extract sequential semantic features from the word sequences as well as the part-of-speech tags. Then, we design a Hybrid Graph Attention (HGAT) module to generate syntax-based semantic features by considering the transferable dependency relations. Finally, we devise an Integrated aDaptive Strategy (IDS) to guide the joint learning process of both modules. Extensive experiments on four public datasets indicate that GAST achieves comparable effectiveness to a range of state-of-the-art models.|跨域情感分类(CDSC)的目的是利用从源域学到的可转移语义来预测未标记目标域中的评论情感。现有的研究更多地关注句子的序列建模，而忽略了图结构中的丰富的领域不变语义(即词性标签和依赖关系)。自适应图表示作为探索语言理解特征的一个重要方面，近年来发挥了重要作用。为此，本文旨在探索在 CDSC 中从类图结构中学习不变语义特征的可能性。具体来说，我们提出了一种自适应语义转移(GAST)模型，这是一种自适应语法图嵌入方法，能够从词序列和语法图中学习领域不变语义。更具体地说，我们首先提出一个 POS 转换器模块来从词序列和词性标签中提取序列语义特征。然后，我们设计了一个混合图注意(HGAT)模块，通过考虑可转移的依赖关系来生成基于语法的语义特征。最后，我们设计了一个综合自适应策略(IDS)来指导两个模块的联合学习过程。对四个公共数据集的大量实验表明，GAST 达到了与一系列最先进的模型相当的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Graph+Adaptive+Semantic+Transfer+for+Cross-domain+Sentiment+Classification)|1|
|[Hybrid CNN Based Attention with Category Prior for User Image Behavior Modeling](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531854)|Xin Chen, Qingtao Tang, Ke Hu, Yue Xu, Shihang Qiu, Jia Cheng, Jun Lei|Meituan, Shanghai, China|User historical behaviors are proved useful for Click Through Rate (CTR) prediction in online advertising system. In Meituan, one of the largest e-commerce platform in China, an item is typically displayed with its image and whether a user clicks the item or not is usually influenced by its image, which implies that user's image behaviors are helpful for understanding user's visual preference and improving the accuracy of CTR prediction. Existing user image behavior models typically use a two-stage architecture, which extracts visual embeddings of images through off-the-shelf Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in the first stage, and then jointly trains a CTR model with those visual embeddings and non-visual features. We find that the two-stage architecture is sub-optimal for CTR prediction. Meanwhile, precisely labeled categories in online ad systems contain abundant visual prior information, which can enhance the modeling of user image behaviors. However, off-the-shelf CNNs without category prior may extract category unrelated features, limiting CNN's expression ability. To address the two issues, we propose a hybrid CNN based attention module, unifying user's image behaviors and category prior, for CTR prediction. Our approach achieves significant improvements in both online and offline experiments on a billion scale real serving dataset.|在线广告系统中，用户的历史行为对点击率(CTR)的预测非常有用。美团是中国最大的电子商务平台之一，一个商品通常与其图像一起显示，用户是否点击该商品通常受其图像的影响，这意味着用户的图像行为有助于理解用户的视觉偏好，提高点击率预测的准确性。现有的用户图像行为模型通常采用两阶段结构，在第一阶段通过现成的卷积神经网络(CNN)提取图像的视觉嵌入，然后将这些视觉嵌入和非视觉特征联合训练 CTR 模型。我们发现两阶段结构对于 CTR 预测是次优的。同时，在线广告系统中精确标注的类别含有丰富的视觉先验信息，可以增强用户图像行为的建模能力。然而，没有类别先验的现成 CNN 可能会提取类别不相关的特征，限制了 CNN 的表达能力。针对这两个问题，提出了一种基于混合细胞神经网络的注意模块，统一用户的图像行为和类别先验，用于 CTR 预测。我们的方法在10亿规模的实际服务数据集的两个在线和离线实验中都取得了显著的改进。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Hybrid+CNN+Based+Attention+with+Category+Prior+for+User+Image+Behavior+Modeling)|1|
|[When Online Meets Offline: Exploring Periodicity for Travel Destination Prediction](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531859)|Wanjie Tao, Liangyue Li, Chen Chen, Zulong Chen, Hong Wen|University of Virginia, Petersburg, UNK, USA; Alibaba Group, Hangzhou, UNK, China|Online travel platforms (OTPs), e.g., booking.com and Ctrip.com, deliver travel experiences to online users by providing travel-related products. One key problem facing OTPs is to predict users' future travel destination, which has many important applications, e.g., proactively recommending users flight tickets or hotels in the destination city. Although much progress has been made for the next POI recommendation, they are largely sub-optimal for travel destination prediction on OTPs, due to the unique characteristics exhibited from users' travel behaviors such as offline spatial-temporal periodicity and online multi-interest exploration. In this paper, we propose an online-offline periodicity-aware information gain network, OOPIN, for travel destination prediction on OTPs. The key components of the model are (1) an offline mobility pattern extractor, which extracts spatial-temporal periodicity along with the sequential dependencies from the visited city sequence; and (2) an online multi-interests exploration module that discovers destinations that the user might be interested in but not yet visited from their online interaction data.Comprehensive experiments on real-world OTP demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model for travel destination prediction compared with state-of-the-art methods.|在线旅游平台(OTP) ，例如 booking.com 和 Trip.com，通过提供与旅游相关的产品，为在线用户提供旅游体验。OTP 面临的一个关键问题是预测用户未来的旅游目的地，这有许多重要的应用程序，例如，主动向用户推荐目的地城市的机票或酒店。尽管下一个 POI 推荐已经取得了很大的进展，但由于用户的出行行为表现出离线时空周期性和在线多兴趣探索等独特特征，它们在 OTP 上对旅游目的地的预测大多是次优的。在本文中，我们提出了一个在线-离线周期感知信息增益网络，OOPIN，用于 OTP 上的旅游目的地预测。该模型的关键组成部分是: (1)离线移动模式提取器，它从访问的城市序列中提取出时空周期以及顺序依赖关系; (2)在线多兴趣探索模块，它从用户的在线交互数据中发现用户可能感兴趣但尚未访问的目的地。在现实生活中的 OTP 实验表明，与现有的预测方法相比，本文提出的旅游目的地预测模型具有更好的预测性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=When+Online+Meets+Offline:+Exploring+Periodicity+for+Travel+Destination+Prediction)|1|
|[Modeling User Behavior With Interaction Networks for Spam Detection](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531875)|Prabhat Agarwal, Manisha Srivastava, Vishwakarma Singh, Charles Rosenberg|Pinterest, San Francisco, CA, USA|Spam is a serious problem plaguing web-scale digital platforms which facilitate user content creation and distribution. It compromises platform's integrity, performance of services like recommendation and search, and overall business. Spammers engage in a variety of abusive and evasive behavior which are distinct from non-spammers. Users' complex behavior can be well represented by a heterogeneous graph rich with node and edge attributes. Learning to identify spammers in such a graph for a web-scale platform is challenging because of its structural complexity and size. In this paper, we propose SEINE (Spam DEtection using Interaction NEtworks), a spam detection model over a novel graph framework. Our graph simultaneously captures rich users' details and behavior and enables learning on a billion-scale graph. Our model considers neighborhood along with edge types and attributes, allowing it to capture a wide range of spammers. SEINE, trained on a real dataset of tens of millions of nodes and billions of edges, achieves a high performance of 80% recall with 1% false positive rate. SEINE achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art techniques on a public dataset while being pragmatic to be used in a large-scale production system.|垃圾邮件是困扰网络规模的数字平台的一个严重问题，这些平台促进了用户内容的创建和分发。它损害了平台的完整性、推荐和搜索等服务的性能以及整体业务。垃圾邮件发送者与非垃圾邮件发送者有所不同，他们从事各种辱骂和回避行为。用户的复杂行为可以很好地用一个具有丰富节点和边属性的异构图来表示。由于其结构的复杂性和规模，学习在这样一个网络规模平台的图表中识别垃圾邮件发送者是具有挑战性的。在本文中，我们提出了 SEINE (使用交互网络的垃圾邮件检测) ，一个新的图形框架下的垃圾邮件检测模型。我们的图形同时捕捉丰富用户的细节和行为，并支持在十亿级图形上学习。我们的模型考虑了邻域以及边缘类型和属性，允许它捕获范围广泛的垃圾邮件发送者。SEINE 在数千万个节点和数十亿条边的真实数据集上进行训练，实现了80% 的高性能召回率和1% 的假阳性率。SEINE 在公共数据集上实现了与最先进技术相当的性能，同时在大规模生产系统中使用也很实用。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Modeling+User+Behavior+With+Interaction+Networks+for+Spam+Detection)|1|

However, the current datasets are essentially designed for synchronic document collections (e.g., Wikipedia). Temporal news collections such as long-term news archives spanning decades are rarely used in training the models despite they are quite valuable for our society. To foster the research in the field of ODQA on such historical collections, we present ArchivalQA, a large question answering dataset consisting of 532,444 question-answer pairs which is designed for temporal news QA. We divide our dataset into four subparts based on the question difficulty levels and the containment of temporal expressions, which we believe are useful for training and testing ODQA systems characterized by different strengths and abilities. The novel QA dataset-constructing framework that we introduce can be also applied to generate high-quality, non-ambiguous questions over other types of temporal document collections.|近年来，随着深度学习技术的发展和大规模问答数据集的出现，开放域问答技术得到了迅速的发展。然而，当前的数据集基本上是为同步文档集合而设计的(例如，Wikipedia)。时态新闻集合，如跨越数十年的长期新闻档案，很少用于训练模型，尽管它们对我们的社会有相当大的价值。为了促进 ODQA 领域对这些历史文献的研究，我们提出了 ArchivalQA，一个由532,444个问答对组成的大型问答数据集，它是为时事新闻 QA 而设计的。我们根据问题的难度水平和时间表达式的限制将数据集分为四个子部分，我们相信这对于训练和测试具有不同拥有属性和能力的 ODQA 系统是有用的。我们介绍的新的 QA 数据集构建框架也可以应用于生成高质量的、非歧义的问题，而不是其他类型的时态文档集合。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=ArchivalQA:+A+Large-scale+Benchmark+Dataset+for+Open-Domain+Question+Answering+over+Historical+News+Collections)|1|

Morgan AI Research, London, United Kingdom; J.P. Morgan AI Research, New York, NY, USA|Retrieving relevant documents from a corpus is typically based on the semantic similarity between the document content and query text. The inclusion of structural relationship between documents can benefit the retrieval mechanism by addressing semantic gaps. However, incorporating these relationships requires tractable mechanisms that balance structure with semantics and take advantage of the prevalent pre-train/fine-tune paradigm. We propose here a holistic approach to learning document representations by integrating intra-document content with inter-document relations. Our deep metric learning solution analyzes the complex neighborhood structure in the relationship network to efficiently sample similar/dissimilar document pairs and defines a novel quintuplet loss function that simultaneously encourages document pairs that are semantically relevant to be closer and structurally unrelated to be far apart in the representation space. Furthermore, the separation margins between the documents are varied flexibly to encode the heterogeneity in relationship strengths. The model is fully fine-tunable and natively supports query projection during inference. We demonstrate that it outperforms competing methods on multiple datasets for document retrieval tasks.|从语料库中检索相关文档通常是基于文档内容和查询文本之间的语义相似性。文档之间结构化关系的引入有利于解决语义空白，提高检索机制的效率。然而，合并这些关系需要易处理的机制，平衡结构与语义，并利用流行的预训练/微调范式的优势。在这里，我们提出了一种通过整合文档内容和文档间关系来学习文档表示的整体方法。我们的深度度量学习解决方案分析了关系网络中复杂的邻域结构，以有效地采样相似/不相似的文档对，并定义了一种新的五元组丢失函数，同时鼓励语义相关的文档对在表示空间中更加紧密，结构上不相关。此外，文档之间的分离边界可以灵活变化，以编码关系强度的异质性。该模型是完全可调的，并且在推理过程中本身支持查询投影。我们展示了它在多个数据集的文献检索任务中优于竞争方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Structure+and+Semantics+Preserving+Document+Representations)|1|
|[Aspect Feature Distillation and Enhancement Network for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531938)|Rui Liu, Jiahao Cao, Nannan Sun, Lei Jiang|Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences & University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China|Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained sentiment analysis task designed to identify the polarity of a target aspect. Some works introduce various attention mechanisms to fully mine the relevant context words of different aspects, and use the traditional cross-entropy loss to fine-tune the models for the ABSA task. However, the attention mechanism paying partial attention to aspect-unrelated words inevitably introduces irrelevant noise. Moreover, the cross-entropy loss lacks discriminative learning of features, which makes it difficult to exploit the implicit information of intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. To overcome these challenges, we propose an Aspect Feature Distillation and Enhancement Network (AFDEN) for the ABSA task. We first propose a dual-feature extraction module to extract aspect-related and aspect-unrelated features through the attention mechanisms and graph convolutional networks. Then, to eliminate the interference of aspect-unrelated words, we design a novel aspect-feature distillation module containing a gradient reverse layer that learns aspect-unrelated contextual features through adversarial training, and an aspect-specific orthogonal projection layer to further project aspect-related features into the orthogonal space of aspect-unrelated features. Finally, we propose an aspect-feature enhancement module that leverages supervised contrastive learning to capture the implicit information between the same sentiment labels and between different sentiment labels. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that our AFDEN model achieves state-of-the-art performance and verify the effectiveness and robustness of our model.|基于方面的情绪分析(ABSA)是一个细粒度的情绪分析任务，旨在识别目标方面的极性。一些工作引入了各种注意机制来充分挖掘不同方面的相关上下文词，并利用传统的交叉熵损失对 ABSA 任务的模型进行了微调。然而，部分关注体无关词的注意机制不可避免地会引入不相关的噪声。此外，交叉熵损失缺乏对特征的判别学习，这使得利用类内紧性和类间可分性的隐含信息变得困难。为了克服这些挑战，我们提出了一个面向特征提取和增强网络(AFDEN)的 ABSA 任务。首先提出一个双特征提取模块，通过注意机制和图卷积网络提取与方面相关和与方面无关的特征。然后，为了消除方面无关词的干扰，设计了一个新的方面特征提取模块，该模块包含一个梯度反向层，通过对抗性训练学习方面无关的上下文特征，以及一个方面特定的正交投影层，进一步将方面相关特征投影到方面无关特征的正交空间中。最后，我们提出了一个侧面特征增强模块，该模块利用监督对比学习来捕获相同情感标签之间和不同情感标签之间的隐含信息。在三个公共数据集上的实验结果表明，我们的 AFDEN 模型达到了最先进的性能，验证了模型的有效性和鲁棒性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Aspect+Feature+Distillation+and+Enhancement+Network+for+Aspect-based+Sentiment+Analysis)|1|

In this paper, we study one particular structure, referred to as frozen phrases, that is highly expected to transfer as a whole from questions to answer passages. Frozen phrases, if detected, can be helpful in open-domain Question Answering (QA) where identifying the localized context of a given input question is crucial. An interesting question is if frozen phrases can be accurately detected. We cast the problem as a sequence-labeling task and create synthetic data from existing QA datasets to train a model. We further plug this model into a sparse retriever that is made aware of the detected phrases.

We collect data by providing an additional annotation layer for dialogues sampled from the ReDial dataset, a widely used conversational recommendation dataset.

The annotations allow us to study how different dialogue aspects influence user satisfaction. We introduce a comprehensive set of user experience aspects derived from the annotators' open comments that can influence users' overall impression. We find that the concept of satisfaction varies across annotators and dialogues, and show that a relevant turn is significant for some annotators, while for others, an interesting turn is all they need.

|[On Survivorship Bias in MS MARCO](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531832)|Prashansa Gupta, Sean MacAvaney|University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom|Survivorship bias is the tendency to concentrate on the positive outcomes of a selection process and overlook the results that generate negative outcomes. We observe that this bias could be present in the popular MS MARCO dataset, given that annotators could not find answers to 38--45% of the queries, leading to these queries being discarded in training and evaluation processes. Although we find that some discarded queries in MS MARCO are ill-defined or otherwise unanswerable, many are valid questions that could be answered had the collection been annotated more completely (around two thirds using modern ranking techniques). This survivability problem distorts the MS MARCO collection in several ways. We find that it affects the natural distribution of queries in terms of the type of information needed. When used for evaluation, we find that the bias likely yields a significant distortion of the absolute performance scores observed. Finally, given that MS MARCO is frequently used for model training, we train models based on subsets of MS MARCO that simulates more survivorship bias. We find that models trained in this setting are up to 9.9% worse when evaluated on versions of the dataset with more complete annotations, and up to 3.5% worse at zero-shot transfer. Our findings are complementary to other recent suggestions for further annotation of MS MARCO, but with a focus on discarded queries.|倖存者偏差就是倾向于专注于选择过程的积极结果，而忽视产生消极结果的结果。我们观察到，这种偏见可能存在于流行的 MS MARCO 数据集中，因为注释者无法找到38-45% 的查询的答案，导致这些查询在培训和评估过程中被丢弃。尽管我们发现 MS MARCO 中的一些丢弃的查询是不明确的或者无法回答的，但是许多是有效的问题，如果集合被更完整地注释(使用现代排序技术约占三分之二) ，则可以回答这些问题。这个生存性问题在几个方面扭曲了 MS MARCO 集合。我们发现，根据所需信息的类型，它会影响查询的自然分布。当用于评估时，我们发现这种偏差很可能导致观察到的绝对绩效得分的显著扭曲。最后，鉴于微软 MARCO 经常被用于模型训练，我们基于微软 MARCO 的子集来训练模型，以模拟更多的倖存者偏差。我们发现，在这种情况下训练的模型在使用更完整注释的数据集版本进行评估时差异高达9.9% ，而在零镜头传输时差异高达3.5% 。我们的发现是对其他最近的建议进一步注释微软 MARCO 的补充，但重点放在丢弃的查询。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=On+Survivorship+Bias+in+MS+MARCO)|1|

However, models tend to memorize the dataset biases within spurious correlations between news patterns and veracity labels as shortcuts, rather than learning how to integrate the information behind them to reason. As a consequence, models may suffer from a serious failure when facing real-life conditions where most news has different patterns. Inspired by the success of causal inference, we propose a novel framework for debiasing evidence-based fake news detection\footnoteCode available at https://github.com/CRIPAC-DIG/CF-FEND by causal intervention. Under this framework, the model is first trained on the original biased dataset like ordinary work, then it makes conventional predictions and counterfactual predictions simultaneously in the testing stage, where counterfactual predictions are based on the intervened evidence. Relatively unbiased predictions are obtained by subtracting intervened outputs from the conventional ones.

Estimating the user's reposting probability by social influence, namely state activation plays an important role in the information diffusion process. Therefore, Graph Neural Networks (GNN), which can simulate the information interaction between nodes, has been proved as an effective scheme to handle this prediction task. However, existing studies including GNN-based models usually neglect a vital factor of user's preference which influences the state activation deeply. To that end, we propose a novel framework to promote cascade size prediction by enhancing the user preference modeling according to three stages, i.e., preference topics generation, preference shift modeling, and social influence activation. Our end-to-end method makes the user activating process of information diffusion more adaptive and accurate.

|[Few-shot Node Classification on Attributed Networks with Graph Meta-learning](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531978)|Yonghao Liu, Mengyu Li, Ximing Li, Fausto Giunchiglia, Xiaoyue Feng, Renchu Guan|University of Trento, Trento, Italy; Jilin University, Changchun, China|Attributed networks, as a manifestation of data in non-Euclidean domains, have a wide range of applications in the real world, such as molecular property prediction, social network analysis and anomaly detection. Node classification, as a fundamental research problem in attributed networks, has attracted increasing attention among research communities. However, most existing models cannot be directly applied to the data with limited labeled instances (\textiti.e., the few-shot scenario). Few-shot node classification on attributed networks is gradually becoming a research hotspot. Although several methods aim to integrate meta-learning with graph neural networks to address this problem, some limitations remain. First, they all assume node representation learning using graph neural networks in homophilic graphs. %Hence, suboptimal performance is obtained when these models are applied to heterophilic graphs. Second, existing models based on meta-learning entirely depend on instance-based statistics. %which in few-shot settings are unavoidably degraded by data noise or outliers. Third, most previous models treat all sampled tasks equally and fail to adapt their uniqueness. %which has a significant impact on the overall performance of the model. To solve the above three limitations, we propose a novel graph Meta -learning framework called G raph learning based on P rototype and S caling & shifting transformation (Meta-GPS ). More specifically, we introduce an efficient method for learning expressive node representations even on heterophilic graphs and propose utilizing a prototype-based approach to initialize parameters in meta-learning. Moreover, we also leverage S$^2$ (scaling & shifting) transformation to learn effective transferable knowledge from diverse tasks. Extensive experimental results on six real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework, which outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines by up to 13% absolute improvement in terms of related metrics.|属性网络作为非欧几里德领域数据的表现形式，在现实世界中有着广泛的应用，如分子特性预测、社会网络分析和异常检测分析。节点分类作为属性网络的一个基础研究问题，越来越受到研究界的重视。然而，大多数现有的模型不能直接应用于带有有限标签的实例的数据(textti.e.a few-shot 场景)。基于属性网络的少镜头节点分类正逐渐成为研究热点。虽然有几种方法旨在将元学习与图神经网络相结合来解决这个问题，但仍然存在一些局限性。首先，它们都假定在同态图中使用图神经网络进行节点表示学习。因此，当这些模型应用于异质图时，得到了次优的性能。其次，现有的基于元学习的模型完全依赖于基于实例的统计。在少镜头设置中，不可避免地会受到数据噪声或异常值的影响。第三，大多数以前的模型对所有抽样任务一视同仁，不能适应它们的唯一性。% ，这对模型的整体性能有重大影响。为了解决这三个问题，提出了一种新的图元学习框架——基于 P 原型和 S 标定与移位变换的 G 图学习(Meta-GPS)。更具体地说，我们介绍了一种有效的学习表达式节点表示的方法，甚至在异质图上，并提出了利用基于原型的方法来初始化元学习中的参数。此外，我们还利用 S $^ 2 $(缩放和转移)转换来学习不同任务中有效的可转移知识。在六个真实世界数据集上的大量实验结果证明了我们提出的框架的优越性，它在相关指标方面比其他最先进的基线表现出高达13% 的绝对改进。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Few-shot+Node+Classification+on+Attributed+Networks+with+Graph+Meta-learning)|1|

Considering that an interaction can be seen as an action occurring among multiple objects, most existing methods model the objects and their pair-wise relations as nodes and links in graphs. However, they only model and leverage part of the information in real entire interactions, i.e., either decompose the entire interaction into several pair-wise sub-interactions for simplification, or only focus on clustering some specific types of objects, which limits the performance and explainability of clustering. To tackle this issue, we propose to Co-cluster the Interactions via Attentive Hypergraph neural network (CIAH). Particularly, with more comprehensive modeling of interactions by hypergraph, we propose an attentive hypergraph neural network to encode the entire interactions, where an attention mechanism is utilized to select important attributes for explanations. Then, we introduce a salient method to guide the attention to be more consistent with real importance of attributes, namely saliency-based consistency. Moreover, we propose a novel co-clustering method to perform a joint clustering for the representations of interactions and the corresponding distributions of attribute selection, namely cluster-based consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our CIAH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art clustering methods on both public datasets and real industrial datasets.|随着交互数据的快速增长，人们提出了许多聚类方法来发现交互模式作为有利于下游任务的先验知识。考虑到一个交互可以看作是多个对象之间的一个动作，现有的方法大多将对象及其成对关系建模为图中的节点和链接。然而，他们只是在真实的整个交互中对部分信息进行建模和利用，也就是说，要么将整个交互分解为几个成对的子交互以进行简化，要么只关注某些特定类型的对象的聚类，这限制了聚类的性能和可解释性。为了解决这一问题，我们提出了通过注意超图神经网络(CIAH)对相互作用进行共聚类。特别是，随着超图对交互作用建模的不断深入，我们提出了一种注意超图神经网络对整个交互作用进行编码，利用注意机制选择重要属性进行解释。然后，我们介绍了一种引导注意与属性的真实重要性更加一致的显著方法，即基于显著性的一致性。此外，我们提出了一种新的共聚类方法，即基于聚类的一致性，对交互作用的表示和相应的属性选择分布进行联合聚类。大量的实验表明，我们的 CIAH 在公共数据集和实际工业数据集上都显著优于最先进的聚类方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Co-clustering+Interactions+via+Attentive+Hypergraph+Neural+Network)|1|
|[Mutual Disentanglement Learning for Joint Fine-Grained Sentiment Classification and Controllable Text Generation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3532029)|Hao Fei, Chenliang Li, Donghong Ji, Fei Li|Wuhan University, Wuhan, China|Fine-grained sentiment classification (FGSC) task and fine-grained controllable text generation (FGSG) task are two representative applications of sentiment analysis, two of which together can actually form an inverse task prediction, i.e., the former aims to infer the fine-grained sentiment polarities given a text piece, while the latter generates text content that describes the input fine-grained opinions. Most of the existing work solves the FGSC and the FGSG tasks in isolation, while ignoring the complementary benefits in between. This paper combines FGSC and FGSG as a joint dual learning system, encouraging them to learn the advantages from each other. Based on the dual learning framework, we further propose decoupling the feature representations in two tasks into fine-grained aspect-oriented opinion variables and content variables respectively, by performing mutual disentanglement learning upon them. We also propose to transform the difficult "data-to-text'' generation fashion widely used in FGSG into an easier text-to-text generation fashion by creating surrogate natural language text as the model inputs. Experimental results on 7 sentiment analysis benchmarks including both the document-level and sentence-level datasets show that our method significantly outperforms the current strong-performing baselines on both the FGSC and FGSG tasks. Automatic and human evaluations demonstrate that our FGSG model successfully generates fluent, diverse and rich content conditioned on fine-grained sentiments.|细粒度情绪分类任务(FGSC)和细粒度可控文本生成任务(FGSG)是情绪分析的两个具有代表性的应用，两者结合起来实际上可以形成一个反向的任务预测，即前者旨在推断给定文本片段的细粒度情绪极性，而后者生成描述输入细粒度意见的文本内容。现有的大多数工作是孤立地解决 FGSC 和 FGSG 任务，而忽略了它们之间的互补性。本文将 FGSC 和 FGSG 作为一个联合的双学习系统结合起来，鼓励它们相互学习对方的优势。在对偶学习框架的基础上，进一步提出将两个任务的特征表示分别解耦为细粒度面向方面的观点变量和内容变量，并对它们进行相互解缠学习。我们还建议通过创建替代自然语言文本作为模型输入，将 FGSG 中广泛使用的困难的“数据到文本”生成方式转换为更容易的文本到文本生成方式。对包括文档级和句子级数据集在内的7个情绪分析基准的实验结果表明，我们的方法在 FGSC 和 FGSG 任务上都显著优于目前表现强劲的基准。自动和人工评估表明，我们的 FGSG 模型成功地产生流畅，多样和丰富的内容条件下细粒度的情感。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Mutual+Disentanglement+Learning+for+Joint+Fine-Grained+Sentiment+Classification+and+Controllable+Text+Generation)|1|

Recently, disentangled representation learning methods that decompose covariates into three latent factors, including instrumental, confounding and adjustment factors, have witnessed great success in treatment effect estimation. However, it remains an open problem how to learn the underlying disentangled factors precisely. Specifically, previous methods fail to obtain independent disentangled factors, which is a necessary condition for identifying treatment effect. In this paper, we propose Disentangled Representations for Counterfactual Regression via Mutual Information Minimization (MIM-DRCFR), which uses a multi-task learning framework to share information when learning the latent factors and incorporates MI minimization learning criteria to ensure the independence of these factors.

|[L3E-HD: A Framework Enabling Efficient Ensemble in High-Dimensional Space for Language Tasks](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531761)|Fangxin Liu, Haomin Li, Xiaokang Yang, Li Jiang|Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China; Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai , China; Tianjin University, Tianjin, China|Brain-inspired hyperdimensional computing (HDC) has been introduced as an alternative computing paradigm to achieve efficient and robust learning. HDC simulates cognitive tasks by mapping all data points to patterns of neural activity in the high-dimensional space, which has demonstrated promising performances in a wide range of applications such as robotics, biomedical signal processing, and genome sequencing. Language tasks, generally solved using machine learning methods, are widely deployed on low-power embedded devices. However, existing HDC solutions suffer from major challenges that impede the deployment of low-power embedded devices: the storage and computation overhead of HDC models grows dramatically with (i) the number of dimensions and (ii) the complex similarity metric during the inference. In this paper, we proposed a novel ensemble framework for the language task, termed L3E-HD, which enables efficient HDC on low-power edge devices. L3E-HD accelerates the inference by mapping data points to a high-dimensional binary space to simplify similarity search, which dominates costly and frequent operation in HDC. Through marrying HDC with the ensemble technique, L3E-HD also addresses the severe accuracy degradation induced by the compression of the dimension and precision of the model. Our experiments show that the ensemble technique is naturally a perfect fit to boost HDCs. We find that our L3E-HD, which is faster, more efficient, and more accurate than conventional machine learning methods, can even surpass the accuracy of the full-precision model at a smaller model size.

To this end, we innovatively present an Graph Capsule Network with a Dual Adaptive Mechanism (DA-GCN) to tackle the above challenges. Specifically, this powerful mechanism is a dual-adaptive mechanism to capture the part-whole structure of the graph. One is an adaptive node interaction module to explore the potential relationship between interactive nodes.

Given a sentence and an aspect term occurring in the sentence, TOWE extracts the corresponding opinion words for the aspect term. TOWE has two types of instance. In the first type, aspect terms are associated with at least one opinion word, while in the second type, aspect terms do not have corresponding opinion words. However, previous researches trained and evaluated their models with only the first type of instance, resulting in a sample selection bias problem. Specifically, TOWE models were trained with only the first type of instance, while these models would be utilized to make inference on the entire space with both the first type of instance and the second type of instance. Thus, the generalization performance will be hurt. Moreover, the performance of these models on the first type of instance cannot reflect their performance on entire space. To validate the sample selection bias problem, four popular TOWE datasets containing only aspect terms associated with at least one opinion word are extended and additionally include aspect terms without corresponding opinion words. Experimental results on these datasets show that training TOWE models on entire space will significantly improve model performance and evaluating TOWE models only on the first type of instance will overestimate model performance.|面向目标的意见词提取(TOWE)是基于方面的情感分析(ABSA)的一个子任务。给定一个句子和一个体项出现在句子中，TOWE 提取相应的体项意见词。TOWE 有两种类型的实例。在第一种类型中，体词至少与一个意见词相关联，而在第二种类型中，体词没有相应的意见词。然而，以往的研究仅用第一类实例对模型进行训练和评价，导致样本选择偏差问题。具体来说，TOWE 模型只用第一种类型的实例进行训练，而这些模型将被用来对整个空间进行第一种类型的实例和第二种类型的实例的推断。因此，泛化性能将受到影响。此外，这些模型在第一类实例上的性能不能反映它们在整个空间上的性能。为了验证样本选择偏差问题，扩展了四个常用的 TOWE 数据集，其中只包含与至少一个意见词相关的方面词，并且还包含了没有相应意见词的方面词。在这些数据集上的实验结果表明，在整个空间上训练 TOWE 模型将显著提高模型的性能，只有在第一类实例上评估 TOWE 模型才会高估模型的性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Training+Entire-Space+Models+for+Target-oriented+Opinion+Words+Extraction)|1|

To bridge the gap, we propose a bicomponent structural and attribute learning framework (BSAL) that is designed to adaptively leverage information from topology and feature spaces. Specifically, BSAL constructs a semantic topology via the node attributes and then gets the embeddings regarding the semantic view, which provides a flexible and easy-to-implement solution to adaptively incorporate the information carried by the node attributes. Then the semantic embedding together with topology embedding are fused together using attention mechanism for the final prediction.

|[Lightweight Meta-Learning for Low-Resource Abstractive Summarization](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531908)|Taehun Huh, Youngjoong Ko|Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon-si, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea|Recently, supervised abstractive summarization using high-resource datasets, such as CNN/DailyMail and Xsum, has achieved significant performance improvements. However, most of the existing high-resource dataset is biased towards a specific domain like news, and annotating document-summary pairs for low-resource datasets is too expensive. Furthermore, the need for low-resource abstractive summarization task is emerging but existing methods for the task such as transfer learning still have domain shifting and overfitting problems. To address these problems, we propose a new framework for low-resource abstractive summarization using a meta-learning algorithm that can quickly adapt to a new domain using small data. For adaptive meta-learning, we introduce a lightweight module inserted into the attention mechanism of a pre-trained language model; the module is first meta-learned with high-resource task-related datasets and then is fine-tuned with the low-resource target dataset. We evaluate our model on 11 different datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art on 9 datasets in low-resource abstractive summarization.|最近，使用高资源数据集(如 CNN/DailyMail 和 Xsum)的监督抽象摘要已经取得了显著的性能改进。然而，大多数现有的高资源数据集偏向于新闻这样的特定领域，并且为低资源数据集注释文档-摘要对过于昂贵。此外，对低资源抽象摘要任务的需求正在出现，但现有的任务转移学习等方法仍然存在领域移位和过拟合问题。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一个新的框架，低资源抽象摘要使用元学习算法，可以快速适应新的领域使用小数据。对于自适应元学习，我们在预训练语言模型的注意机制中引入了一个轻量级模块，该模块首先对高资源任务相关数据集进行元学习，然后对低资源目标数据集进行微调。我们在11个不同的数据集上评估我们的模型。实验结果表明，该方法在低资源抽象摘要的9个数据集上达到了最高水平。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Lightweight+Meta-Learning+for+Low-Resource+Abstractive+Summarization)|1|

However, directly applying this method heavily suffers from the dialogue entity inconsistency caused by the removal of delexicalized tokens, as well as the catastrophic forgetting problem of the pre-trained model during fine-tuning, leading to unsatisfactory performance. To alleviate these problems, we design a novel GPT-Adapter-CopyNet network, which incorporates the lightweight adapter and CopyNet modules into GPT-2 to achieve better performance on transfer learning and dialogue entity generation. Experimental results conducted on the DSTC8 Track 1 benchmark and MultiWOZ dataset demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly outperforms baseline models with a remarkable performance on automatic and human evaluations.|本文提出将任务导向的对话系统设计为纯自然语言生成任务，以充分利用 GPT-2等大规模预训练模型，简化复杂的去词化过程。然而，直接应用这种方法，由于去词化标记引起的对话实体不一致，以及预训练模型在微调过程中的灾难性遗忘问题，导致性能不理想。为了解决这些问题，我们设计了一种新型的 GPT-Adapter-CopyNet 网络，它将轻量级适配器和 CopyNet 模块集成到 GPT-2中，以实现更好的传递学习和对话实体生成。在 DSTC8 Track1基准和 MultiWOZ 数据集上进行的实验结果表明，我们提出的方法显著优于基线模型，在自动和人工评估方面具有显著的性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Task-Oriented+Dialogue+System+as+Natural+Language+Generation)|1|

The Information Retrieval community understands the performance of queries and search engines extensively, and has recently begun to examine the impact of query variation, showing that different queries for the same information need produce different results. In an information environment where bad actors try to nudge searchers toward misinformation, this is worrisome. The source of query variation -- searcher characteristics, contextual or linguistic prompts, cognitive biases, or even the influence of external parties -- while studied in a piecemeal fashion by other research communities has not been studied by ours. In this paper we draw on a variety of literatures (including information seeking, psychology, and misinformation), and report some small experiments to describe what is known about where queries come from, and demonstrate a clear literature gap around the source of query variations in IR. We chart a way forward for IR to research, document and understand this important question, with a view to creating search engines that provide more consistent, accurate and relevant search results regardless of the searcher's framing of the query.|查询——搜索者在搜索框中输入的单词——从何而来？信息检索广泛了解查询和搜索引擎的性能，最近开始研究查询变化的影响，表明对同一信息的不同查询需要产生不同的结果。在信息环境中，坏人试图推动搜索者获得错误信息，这令人担忧。查询变异的来源——搜索者特征、上下文或语言提示、认知偏差，甚至外部各方的影响——虽然被其他研究团体零碎地研究过，但我们还没有研究过。本文借鉴了大量的文献(包括信息搜索、心理学和错误信息) ，通过一些小实验来描述已知的查询来源，并对信息检索中查询变异的来源进行了清晰的文献分析。我们为 IR 研究、记录和理解这个重要问题绘制了一条前进的道路，以期创建能够提供更加一致、准确和相关的搜索结果的搜索引擎，而不管搜索者的查询框架如何。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Where+Do+Queries+Come+From?)|1|

Unfortunately, given a domain-specific dataset, searching effective feature interaction operations and combinations from a huge candidate space requires significant expert experience and computational costs. Recently, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has achieved great success in discovering high-quality network architectures automatically. However, due to the diversity of feature interaction operations and combinations, the existing NAS-based work that treats the architecture search as a black-box optimization problem over a discrete search space suffers from low efficiency. Therefore, it is essential to explore a more efficient architecture search method. To achieve this goal, we propose NAS-CTR, a differentiable neural architecture search approach for CTR prediction. First, we design a novel and expressive architecture search space and a continuous relaxation scheme to make the search space differentiable. Second, we formulate the architecture search for CTR prediction as a joint optimization problem with discrete constraints on architectures and leverage proximal iteration to solve the constrained optimization problem. Additionally, a straightforward yet effective method is proposed to eliminate the aggregation of skip connections. Extensive experimental results reveal that NAS-CTR can outperform the SOTA human-crafted architectures and other NAS-based methods in both test accuracy and search efficiency.|点进率预测已经广泛应用于许多机器学习任务，例如在线广告和个性化推荐。不幸的是，给定一个特定领域的数据集，从一个巨大的候选空间中搜索有效的特征交互操作和组合需要大量的专家经验和计算成本。近年来，神经网络体系结构搜索(NAS)在自动发现高质量的网络体系结构方面取得了巨大的成功。然而，由于功能交互操作和组合的多样性，现有的基于 NAS 的工作将体系结构搜索视为离散搜索空间上的黑盒子最佳化问题，效率低下。因此，有必要探索一种更有效的体系结构搜索方法。为了实现这一目标，我们提出了 NAS-CTR，一种用于 CTR 预测的可微分神经结构搜索方法。首先，我们设计了一个新颖的、具有表现力的体系结构搜索空间和一个连续松弛方案，使搜索空间具有可微性。其次，我们将 CTR 预测的体系结构搜索描述为一个联合最佳化问题，对体系结构进行离散约束，并利用近端迭代来解决约束最佳化问题。此外，提出了一种简单而有效的方法来消除跳跃连接的聚集。大量的实验结果表明，NAS-CTR 在测试精度和搜索效率方面都优于 SOTA 人工架构和其他基于 NAS 的方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=NAS-CTR:+Efficient+Neural+Architecture+Search+for+Click-Through+Rate+Prediction)|0|

Recent pre-trained multilingual language models brought large improvements to the natural language tasks, including cross-lingual adhoc retrieval. However, pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF), a family of techniques for improving ranking using the contents of top initially retrieved items, has not been explored with neural CLIR retrieval models. Two of the challenges are incorporating feedback from long documents, and cross-language knowledge transfer. To address these challenges, we propose a novel neural CLIR architecture, NCLPRF, capable of incorporating PRF feedback from multiple potentially long documents, which enables improvements to query representation in the shared semantic space between query and document languages. The additional information that the feedback documents provide in a target language, can enrich the query representation, bringing it closer to relevant documents in the embedding space. The proposed model performance across three CLIR test collections in Chinese, Russian, and Persian languages, exhibits significant improvements over traditional and SOTA neural CLIR baselines across all three collections.|跨语言信息检索(CLIR)旨在提供跨语言的信息获取途径。最近预先训练的多语言模型给自然语言任务带来了很大的改进，包括跨语言的即席检索。然而，伪相关反馈(PRF)作为一种利用最初检索项目的内容来提高排名的技术，尚未在神经元 CLIR 检索模型中得到应用。其中两个挑战是整合来自长文档的反馈，以及跨语言的知识转移。为了应对这些挑战，我们提出了一个新的神经 CLIR 架构，NCLPRF，能够合并来自多个潜在的长文档的 PRF 反馈，这使得查询语言和文档语言之间的共享语义空间中的查询表示得到改进。反馈文档以目标语言提供的附加信息可以丰富查询表示，使其更接近嵌入空间中的相关文档。在中文，俄文和波斯语的三个 CLIR 测试集合中，所提出的模型性能比所有三个集合中的传统和 SOTA 神经 CLIR 基线都有显著的改进。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Learning+to+Enrich+Query+Representation+with+Pseudo-Relevance+Feedback+for+Cross-lingual+Retrieval)|0|
|[Incorporating Retrieval Information into the Truncation of Ranking Lists for Better Legal Search](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531998)|Yixiao Ma, Qingyao Ai, Yueyue Wu, Yunqiu Shao, Yiqun Liu, Min Zhang, Shaoping Ma|University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA; Tsinghua University, Beijing, China|The truncation of ranking lists predicted by retrieval models is vital to ensure users' search experience. Particularly, in specific vertical domains where documents are usually complicated and extensive (e.g., legal cases), the cost of browsing results is much higher than traditional IR tasks (e.g., Web search) and setting a reasonable cut-off position is quite necessary. While it is straightforward to apply existing result list truncation approaches to legal case retrieval, the effectiveness of these methods is limited because they only focus on simple document statistics and usually fail to capture the context information of documents in the ranking list. These existing efforts also treat result list truncation as an isolated task instead of a component in the entire ranking process, limiting the usage of truncation in practical systems. To tackle these limitations, we propose LeCut, a ranking list truncation model for legal case retrieval. LeCut utilizes contextual features of the retrieval task to capture the semantic-level similarity between documents and decides the best cut-off position with attention mechanisms. We further propose a Joint Optimization of Truncation and Reranking (JOTR) framework based on LeCut to improve the performance of truncation and retrieval tasks simultaneously. Comparison against competitive baselines on public benchmark datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of LeCut and JOTR. A case study is conducted to visualize the cut-off positions of LeCut and the process of how JOTR improves both retrieval and truncation tasks.|检索模型预测的排名列表的截断对于保证用户的搜索体验至关重要。特别是，在特定的垂直领域，文档通常是复杂和广泛的(例如，法律案件) ，浏览结果的成本远远高于传统的 IR 任务(例如，网络搜索) ，设置一个合理的截止位置是非常必要的。虽然将现有的结果清单截断方法应用于法律案件检索很简单，但这些方法的有效性有限，因为它们只侧重于简单的文件统计，通常无法捕捉排名清单中文件的上下文信息。这些现有的工作还将结果列表截断视为一个孤立的任务，而不是整个排序过程中的一个组件，从而限制了截断在实际系统中的使用。为了解决这些局限性，我们提出了 LeCut，一种用于法律案例检索的排序列表截断模型。LeCut 利用检索任务的上下文特征来捕获文档之间的语义级相似性，并通过注意机制确定最佳截止位置。进一步提出了一种基于 LeCut 的联合优化截断与重排(JOTR)框架，以同时提高截断与检索任务的性能。与公共基准数据集的竞争基线进行比较，可以证明 LeCut 和 JOTR 的有效性。通过案例研究，可视化 LeCut 的截止位置以及 JOTR 如何改进检索和截断任务的过程。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Incorporating+Retrieval+Information+into+the+Truncation+of+Ranking+Lists+for+Better+Legal+Search)|0|

The goal of ranking modules (aka rankers) is to elaborately discriminate users' preference on item candidates proposed by recall modules. With the success of deep learning techniques in various domains, we have witnessed the mainstream rankers evolve from traditional models to deep neural models. However, the way that we design and use rankers remains unchanged: offline training the model, freezing the parameters, and deploying it for online serving. Actually, the candidate items are determined by specific user requests, in which underlying distributions (e.g., the proportion of items for different categories, the proportion of popular or new items) are highly different from one another in a production environment. The classical parameter-frozen inference manner cannot adapt to dynamic serving circumstances, making rankers' performance compromised. In this paper, we propose a new training and inference paradigm, termed as Ada-Ranker, to address the challenges of dynamic online serving. Instead of using parameter-frozen models for universal serving, Ada-Ranker can adaptively modulate parameters of a ranker according to the data distribution of the current group of item candidates. We first extract distribution patterns from the item candidates. Then, we modulate the ranker by the patterns to make the ranker adapt to the current data distribution. Finally, we use the revised ranker to score the candidate list. In this way, we empower the ranker with the capacity of adapting from a global model to a local model which better handles the current task. As a first study, we examine our Ada-Ranker paradigm in the sequential recommendation scenario. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that Ada-Ranker can effectively enhance various base sequential models and also outperform a comprehensive set of competitive baselines.|一个大规模的推荐系统通常包括召回和排名模块。排序模块(又称排序器)的目标是精心区分用户对召回模块提出的候选项的偏好。随着深度学习技术在各个领域的成功，我们目睹了主流的排名从传统模型演变为深度神经模型。然而，我们设计和使用排名的方式保持不变: 离线训练模型，冻结参数，并部署它在线服务。实际上，候选项是由特定的用户请求决定的，在这种情况下，底层分布(例如，不同类别的项目比例，流行项目或新项目的比例)在生产环境中彼此之间差异很大。传统的参数冻结推理方式不能适应动态服务环境，使得排序器的性能受到影响。在本文中，我们提出了一个新的训练和推理范式，称为 Ada-Ranker，以解决动态在线服务的挑战。Ada-Ranker 可以根据当前项目候选者组的数据分布自适应地调整排序器的参数，而不必使用通用服务的参数冻结模型。我们首先从候选项中提取分布模式。然后，根据模式对排序器进行调整，使排序器适应当前的数据分布。最后，我们使用修改后的排名对候选人列表进行评分。通过这种方式，我们赋予排名者从全球模型到更好地处理当前任务的局部模型的适应能力。作为第一个研究，我们在顺序推荐场景中检查我们的 Ada-Ranker 范式。在三个数据集上的实验表明，Ada-Ranker 能够有效地增强各种基本序列模型，并且表现优于一组综合的竞争基线。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Ada-Ranker:+A+Data+Distribution+Adaptive+Ranking+Paradigm+for+Sequential+Recommendation)|0|

To improve the richness, collecting long-term behaviors becomes a typical approach in academy and industry but at the cost of increasing online storage and latency. Recently, researchers have proposed several approaches to shorten long-term behavior sequence and then model user interests. These approaches reduce online cost efficiently but do not well handle the noisy information in long-term user behavior, which may deteriorate the performance of CTR prediction significantly. To obtain better cost/performance trade-off, we propose a novel Adversarial Filtering Model (ADFM) to model long-term user behavior. ADFM uses a hierarchical aggregation representation to compress raw behavior sequence and then learns to remove useless behavior information with an adversarial filtering mechanism. The selected user behaviors are fed into interest extraction module for CTR prediction.

It aims to alleviate the mismatch of linguistic expressions between a query and its potential relevant documents. Existing PRF methods independently treat revised queries originating from the same query but using different numbers of feedback documents, resulting in severe query drift. Without comparing the effects of two different revisions from the same query, a PRF model may incorrectly focus on the additional irrelevant information increased in the more feedback, and thus reformulate a query that is less effective than the revision using the less feedback. Ideally, if a PRF model can distinguish between irrelevant and relevant information in the feedback, the more feedback documents there are, the better the revised query will be. To bridge this gap, we propose the Loss-over-Loss (LoL) framework to compare the reformulation losses between different revisions of the same query during training. Concretely, we revise an original query multiple times in parallel using different amounts of feedback and compute their reformulation losses. Then, we introduce an additional regularization loss on these reformulation losses to penalize revisions that use more feedback but gain larger losses. With such comparative regularization, the PRF model is expected to learn to suppress the extra increased irrelevant information by comparing the effects of different revised queries. Further, we present a differentiable query reformulation method to implement this framework. This method revises queries in the vector space and directly optimizes the retrieval performance of query vectors, applicable for both sparse and dense retrieval models. Empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness of our method for two typical sparse and dense retrieval models.|伪相关反馈(PRF)已被证明是一种有效的查询重构技术，以提高检索的准确性。它旨在缓解查询与潜在相关文档之间的语言表达不匹配问题。现有的 PRF 方法独立处理来自同一查询但使用不同数量的反馈文档的修改查询，导致严重的查询漂移。如果不比较来自同一查询的两个不同修订的效果，PRF 模型可能会错误地关注更多反馈中增加的附加不相关信息，从而使用更少的反馈重新表述比修订更低效的查询。理想情况下，如果 PRF 模型能够区分反馈中的不相关信息和相关信息，那么反馈文档越多，修改后的查询就越好。为了弥补这一差距，我们提出了损失超过损失(LoL)框架来比较同一查询在培训期间不同修订版本之间的重构损失。具体来说，我们使用不同数量的反馈并行多次修改原始查询，并计算它们的重新表述损失。然后，我们引入一个额外的正则化损失对这些重制损失，以惩罚修订使用更多的反馈，但获得更大的损失。通过这种比较正则化，PRF 模型可以通过比较不同修订查询的效果来抑制额外增加的不相关信息。进一步，我们提出了一个可微查询重构方法来实现这个框架。该方法对向量空间中的查询进行修正，直接优化查询向量的检索性能，适用于稀疏和密集检索模型。实验结果表明，该方法对两种典型的稀疏和密集检索模型具有较好的鲁棒性和有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=LoL:+A+Comparative+Regularization+Loss+over+Query+Reformulation+Losses+for+Pseudo-Relevance+Feedback)|0|
|[Determinantal Point Process Likelihoods for Sequential Recommendation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531965)|Yuli Liu, Christian J. Walder, Lexing Xie|Australian National University & Data61, CSIRO, Canberra, Australia; Data61, CSIRO & Australian National University, Canberra, Australia|Sequential recommendation is a popular task in academic research and close to real-world application scenarios, where the goal is to predict the next action(s) of the user based on his/her previous sequence of actions. In the training process of recommender systems, the loss function plays an essential role in guiding the optimization of recommendation models to generate accurate suggestions for users. However, most existing sequential recommendation tech- niques focus on designing algorithms or neural network architectures, and few efforts have been made to tailor loss functions that fit naturally into the practical application scenario of sequential recommender systems. Ranking-based losses, such as cross-entropy and Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) are widely used in the sequential recommendation area. We argue that such objective functions suffer from two inherent drawbacks: i) the dependencies among elements of a sequence are overlooked in these loss formulations; ii) instead of balancing accuracy (quality) and diversity, only generating accurate results has been over emphasized. We therefore propose two new loss functions based on the Determinantal Point Process (DPP) likelihood, that can be adaptively applied to estimate the subsequent item or items. The DPP-distributed item set captures natural dependencies among temporal actions, and a quality vs. diversity decomposition of the DPP kernel pushes us to go beyond accuracy-oriented loss functions. Experimental results using the proposed loss functions on three real-world datasets show marked improvements over state-of-the-art sequential recommendation methods in both quality and diversity metrics.|顺序推荐是学术研究中的一个热门任务，它接近于真实的应用场景，其目标是根据用户以前的操作顺序预测他/她的下一个操作。在推荐系统的培训过程中，损失函数对于指导推荐模型的优化，为用户提供准确的建议起着至关重要的作用。然而，现有的顺序推荐技术大多侧重于设计算法或神经网络体系结构，很少有人努力去调整自然适合顺序推荐系统实际应用场景的损失函数。基于排序的损失，如交叉熵和贝叶斯个性化排序(BPR)被广泛应用于序列推荐领域。我们认为这样的目标函数有两个固有的缺点: i)在这些损失公式中忽略了序列元素之间的依赖关系; ii)没有平衡准确性(质量)和多样性，只有产生准确的结果被过分强调。因此，我们提出两个新的基于行列式点过程(DPP)可能性的损失函数，可以自适应地应用于估计随后的项目。DPP 分布式项目集捕获时间操作之间的自然依赖关系，DPP 内核的质量与多样性分解促使我们超越面向准确性的损失函数。在三个实际数据集上使用提出的损失函数的实验结果显示，在质量和多样性度量方面，该方法比最先进的顺序推荐方法有明显的改进。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Determinantal+Point+Process+Likelihoods+for+Sequential+Recommendation)|0|
|[Re-weighting Negative Samples for Model-Agnostic Matching](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3532053)|Jiazhen Lou, Hong Wen, Fuyu Lv, Jing Zhang, Tengfei Yuan, Zhao Li|Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Alibaba Group, Hangzhou, China; The University of Sydney, Darlington, NSW, Australia|Recommender Systems (RS), as an efficient tool to discover users' interested items from a very large corpus, has attracted more and more attention from academia and industry. As the initial stage of RS, large-scale matching is fundamental yet challenging. A typical recipe is to learn user and item representations with a two-tower architecture and then calculate the similarity score between both representation vectors, which however still struggles in how to properly deal with negative samples. In this paper, we find that the common practice that randomly sampling negative samples from the entire space and treating them equally is not an optimal choice, since the negative samples from different sub-spaces at different stages have different importance to a matching model. To address this issue, we propose a novel method named Unbiased Model-Agnostic Matching Approach (UMA2).

|[Item-Provider Co-learning for Sequential Recommendation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531756)|Lei Chen, Jingtao Ding, Min Yang, Chengming Li, Chonggang Song, Lingling Yi|Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen, China; Tencent Inc., Shenzhen, China; Sun Yat-sen University, Shenzhen, China|Sequential recommender systems (SRSs) have become a research hotspot recently due to its powerful ability in capturing users' dynamic preferences. The key idea behind SRSs is to model the sequential dependencies over the user-item interactions. However, we argue that users' preferences are not only determined by their view or purchase items but also affected by the item-providers with which users have interacted. For instance, in a short-video scenario, a user may click on a video because he/she is attracted to either the video content or simply the video-providers as the vloggers are his/her idols. Motivated by the above observations, in this paper, we propose IPSRec, a novel Item-Provider co-learning framework for Sequential Recommendation. Specifically, we propose two representation learning methods (single-steam and cross-stream) to learn comprehensive item and user representations based on the user's historical item sequence and provider sequence. Then, contrastive learning is employed to further enhance the user embeddings in a self-supervised manner, which treats the representations of a specific user learned from the item side as well as the item-provider side as the positive pair and treats the representations of different users in the batch as the negative samples. Extensive experiments on three real-world SRS datasets demonstrate that IPSRec achieves substantially better results than the strong competitors. For reproducibility, our code and data are available at https://github.com/siat-nlp/IPSRec.|顺序推荐系统(SRS)由于具有捕获用户动态偏好的强大功能，近年来成为研究的热点。SRS 背后的关键思想是在用户-项目交互之间建立顺序依赖关系模型。然而，我们认为用户的偏好不仅取决于他们的观点或购买项目，而且还受到项目供应商的用户已经互动。例如，在一个短视频场景中，用户可能会点击一个视频，因为他/她要么被视频内容吸引，要么被视频提供商吸引，因为视频博客是他/她的偶像。基于上述观察，本文提出了一种新的项目提供者协同学习的序贯推荐框架 IPSRec。具体来说，我们提出了两种表示学习方法(单蒸汽和跨流)来学习综合项目和用户表示基于用户的历史项目序列和提供者序列。然后，采用对比学习的方法，以自监督的方式进一步增强用户嵌入，将从项目侧和项目提供者侧学习到的特定用户的表征视为正对，将批处理中不同用户的表征视为负样本。对三个实际 SRS 数据集的大量实验表明，IPSRec 比强大的竞争对手获得了更好的结果。为确保重复性，我们的代码和数据可在 https://github.com/siat-nlp/ipsrec 查阅。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Item-Provider+Co-learning+for+Sequential+Recommendation)|0|

Despite this lack of information, downstream methods such as reranking, cutoff prediction, and none-of-the-above classification are still able to learn effective functions to accomplish their respective tasks. Unfortunately, these downstream methods can suffer poor performance when the initial ranking model loses confidence in its score predictions. This becomes increasingly important in high-stakes settings, such as medical searches that can influence health decision making. Recent work has resolved this lack of information by introducing Bayesian uncertainty to capture the possible distribution of a document score. This paper presents the use of this uncertainty information as an indicator of how well downstream methods will function over a ranklist. We highlight a significant bias against certain disease-related queries within the posterior distribution of a neural model, and show that this bias in a model's predictive distribution propagates to downstream methods. Finally, we introduce a multi-distribution uncertainty metric, confidence decay, as a valid way of partially identifying these failure cases in an offline setting without the need of any user feedback.|给定一个查询，神经检索模型预测每个文档的相关性点估计; 然而，仅仅依赖点估计的一个显著缺点是，它们不包含模型对其预测的置信度的指示。尽管缺乏这种信息，下游方法，如重新排序，截止预测，以及没有上述分类仍然能够学习有效的功能，以完成各自的任务。不幸的是，当初始排名模型对其分数预测失去信心时，这些下游方法的性能可能会很差。这在高风险环境中变得越来越重要，例如可以影响健康决策的医学搜索。最近的工作通过引入贝叶斯不确定性来捕获文档分数的可能分布，解决了这种信息缺乏的问题。本文介绍了使用这种不确定性信息作为一个指标，以及下游方法将如何在一个排名表的功能。我们强调，在神经模型的后验概率中，某些与疾病相关的查询存在显著的偏差，并表明模型预测分布的这种偏差会传播到下游方法。最后，我们介绍了一个多分布不确定性度量，置信度衰减，作为一个有效的方法，部分识别这些失败案例在脱机设置，而不需要任何用户反馈。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Inconsistent+Ranking+Assumptions+in+Medical+Search+and+Their+Downstream+Consequences)|0|

However, in many online services, user interactions are commonly grouped by sessions that presumably share preferences, which requires a different approach from ordinary sequence representation techniques. To this end, sequence representation models with a hierarchical structure or various viewpoints have been developed but with a rather complex network structure. In this paper, we propose three methods to improve recommendation performance by exploiting session information while minimizing additional parameters in a BERT-based sequential recommendation model: using session tokens, adding session segment embeddings, and a time-aware self-attention.

One reason is that their amortized inferences are beneficial for overcoming the data sparsity. However, in explainable recommendation that generates natural language explanations, they are still rarely explored. Thus, we aim to extend VAE to explainable recommendation. In this task, we find that VAE can generate acceptable explanations for users with few relevant training samples, however, it tends to generate less personalized explanations for users with relatively sufficient samples than autoencoders (AEs). We conjecture that information shared by different users in VAE disturbs the information for a specific user. To deal with this problem, we present PErsonalized VAE (PEVAE) that generates personalized natural language explanations for explainable recommendation. Moreover, we propose two novel mechanisms to aid our model in generating more personalized explanations, including 1) Self-Adaption Fusion (SAF) manipulates the latent space in a self-adaption manner for controlling the influence of shared information. In this way, our model can enjoy the advantage of overcoming the sparsity of data while generating more personalized explanations for a user with relatively sufficient training samples. 2) DEpendence Maximization (DEM) strengthens dependence between recommendations and explanations by maximizing the mutual information. It makes the explanation more specific to the input user-item pair and thus improves the personalization of the generated explanations. Extensive experiments show PEVAE can generate more personalized explanations and further analyses demonstrate the practical effect of our proposed methods.|变分自动编码器(VAE)已被广泛应用于建议。一个原因是，他们的摊销推断有利于克服数据稀疏。然而，在生成自然语言解释的可解释推荐中，它们仍然很少被探索。因此，我们的目标是将 VAE 扩展到可解释的推荐。在这个任务中，我们发现 VAE 可以在相关训练样本较少的情况下为用户生成可接受的解释，但是，与自动编码器(AE)相比，它往往在样本相对充足的情况下为用户生成较少的个性化解释。我们推测 VAE 中不同用户共享的信息会干扰特定用户的信息。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了个性化的 VAE (PEVAE) ，它可以为解释性推荐生成个性化的自然语言解释。此外，我们提出了两种新的机制来帮助我们的模型产生更多的个性化解释，包括1)自适应融合(SAF)以自适应的方式操纵潜在空间来控制共享信息的影响。通过这种方式，我们的模型可以在克服数据稀疏性的同时，通过相对充足的训练样本为用户生成更加个性化的解释。2)依赖最大化(DEM)通过最大化相互信息来增强推荐与解释之间的依赖性。它使解释更加具体到输入用户项对，从而改进了生成的解释的个性化。大量的实验表明，PEVAE 可以产生更加个性化的解释，进一步的分析表明，我们提出的方法的实际效果。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=PEVAE:+A+Hierarchical+VAE+for+Personalized+Explainable+Recommendation)|0|

A shortcoming of this approach is that users often do not know which query will provide the best retrieval performance on the current information retrieval system, meaning that any query autocompletion methods trained to mimic user behavior can lead to suboptimal query suggestions. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new approach that explicitly optimizes the query suggestions for downstream retrieval performance. We formulate this as a problem of ranking a set of rankings, where each query suggestion is represented by the downstream item ranking it produces. We then present a learning method that ranks query suggestions by the quality of their item rankings. The algorithm is based on a counterfactual learning approach that is able to leverage feedback on the items (e.g., clicks, purchases) to evaluate query suggestions through an unbiased estimator, thus avoiding the assumption that users write or select optimal queries. We establish theoretical support for the proposed approach and provide learning-theoretic guarantees. We also present empirical results on publicly available datasets, and demonstrate real-world applicability using data from an online shopping store.|查询自动完成的传统方法旨在预测用户将从列表中选择哪个已完成的查询。这种方法的一个缺点是，用户通常不知道哪个查询将在当前的信息检索系统上提供最佳的检索性能，这意味着任何经过训练的模拟用户行为的查询自动完成方法都可能导致次优的查询建议。为了克服这一限制，我们提出了一种新的方法，显式优化查询建议的下游检索性能。我们将这个问题表述为对一组排名进行排序的问题，其中每个查询建议由它产生的下游项目排名表示。然后，我们提出了一种学习方法，根据项目排名的质量对查询建议进行排序。该算法基于一种反事实学习方法，能够利用对项目(如点击、购买)的反馈，通过一个无偏估计器来评估查询建议，从而避免了用户编写或选择最佳查询的假设。我们为提出的方法建立了理论支持，并提供了学习理论保证。我们还提出了公开可用数据集的实证结果，并证明了真实世界的适用性使用数据从网上购物商店。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Counterfactual+Learning+To+Rank+for+Utility-Maximizing+Query+Autocompletion)|0|

Under each scenario there is a need to optimize multiple task-specific targets e.g., click through rate and conversion rate, known as multi-task learning (MTL). Recent solutions for MSL and MTL are mostly based on the multi-gate mixture-of-experts (MMoE) architecture. MMoE structure is typically static and its design requires domain-specific knowledge, making it less effective in handling both MSL and MTL.

AESM2 integrates both MSL and MTL into a unified framework with an automatic structure learning. Specifically, AESM2 stacks multi-task layers over multi-scenario layers. This hierarchical design enables us to flexibly establish intrinsic connections between different scenarios, and at the same time also supports high-level feature extraction for different tasks. At each multi-scenario/multi-task layer, a novel expert selection algorithm is proposed to automatically identify scenario-/task-specific and shared experts for each input. Experiments over two real-world large-scale datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of AESM2 over a battery of strong baselines.

|[Multi-Agent RL-based Information Selection Model for Sequential Recommendation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3532022)|Kaiyuan Li, Pengfei Wang, Chenliang Li|Wuhan University, Beijing, China; Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China|For sequential recommender, the coarse-grained yet sparse sequential signals mined from massive user-item interactions have become the bottleneck to further improve the recommendation performance. To alleviate the spareness problem, exploiting auxiliary semantic features (\eg textual descriptions, visual images and knowledge graph) to enrich contextual information then turns into a mainstream methodology. Though effective, we argue that these different heterogeneous features certainly include much noise which may overwhelm the valuable sequential signals, and therefore easily reach the phenomenon of negative collaboration (ie 1 + 1 > 2). How to design a flexible strategy to select proper auxiliary information and alleviate the negative collaboration towards a better recommendation is still an interesting and open question. Unfortunately, few works have addressed this challenge in sequential recommendation. In this paper, we introduce a Multi-Agent RL-based Information S election Model (named MARIS) to explore an effective collaboration between different kinds of auxiliary information and sequential signals in an automatic way. Specifically, MARIS formalizes the auxiliary feature selection as a cooperative Multi-agent Markov Decision Process. For each auxiliary feature type, MARIS resorts to using an agent to determine whether a specific kind of auxiliary feature should be imported to achieve a positive collaboration. In between, a QMIX network is utilized to cooperate their joint selection actions and produce an episode corresponding an effective combination of different auxiliary features for the whole historical sequence. Considering the lack of supervised selection signals, we further devise a novel reward-guided sampling strategy to leverage exploitation and exploration scheme for episode sampling. By preserving them in a replay buffer, MARIS learns the action-value function and the reward alternatively for optimization. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our model obtains significant performance improvement over up-to-date state-of-the-art recommendation models.|对于序列推荐系统来说，从大量用户交互中挖掘出的粗粒度稀疏序列信号已经成为进一步提高推荐性能的瓶颈。为了解决这一问题，利用辅助语义特征(如文本描述、视觉图像和知识图形)丰富上下文信息成为主流方法论。虽然有效，我们认为这些不同的异质性特征肯定包括大量的噪声，这可能压倒有价值的序列信号，因此很容易达到负协作现象(即1 + 1 > 2)。如何设计一种灵活的策略，选择合适的辅助信息，减轻负面协作，以获得更好的推荐，仍然是一个有趣而开放的问题。不幸的是，很少有作品在连续推荐中解决了这个问题。本文提出了一种基于多 Agent RL 的信息 S 选择模型(MARIS) ，用于探索不同辅助信息与序列信号之间的自动有效协作。具体来说，MARIS 将辅助特征选择形式化为一个合作的多代理马可夫决策过程。对于每一种辅助特征类型，MARIS 都使用一个代理来确定是否需要导入一种特定的辅助特征来实现积极的协作。其间，利用 QMIX 网络协同它们的联合选择行动，产生对应于整个历史序列的不同辅助特征的有效组合的情节。考虑到缺乏监督选择信号，我们进一步设计了一种新的奖励引导抽样策略，以利用开发和探索方案的情节抽样。通过将它们保存在一个重播缓冲区中，MARIS 学习动作-价值函数和优化的报酬。在四个真实世界数据集上的大量实验表明，我们的模型比最新的最先进的推荐模型获得了显著的性能改进。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Multi-Agent+RL-based+Information+Selection+Model+for+Sequential+Recommendation)|0|

In contrast, in our work we would like to allow system designers or end-users to directly quantify the required relative ratios of individual objectives in the resulting recommendations, e.g., the final results should have 60% relevance, 30% diversity and 10% novelty. If individual objectives are transformed to represent quality on the same scale, these result conditioning expressions may greatly contribute towards recommendations tuneability and explainability as well as user's control over recommendations. To achieve this task, we propose an iterative algorithm inspired by the mandates allocation problem in public elections. The algorithm is applicable as long as per-item marginal gains of individual objectives can be calculated. Effectiveness of the algorithm is evaluated on several settings of relevance-novelty-diversity optimization problem.

McAuley|University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA; Amazon, Seattle, WA, USA; Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA|Sequential recommendation aims to model dynamic user behavior from historical interactions. Self-attentive methods have proven effective at capturing short-term dynamics and long-term preferences. Despite their success, these approaches still struggle to model sparse data, on which they struggle to learn high-quality item representations. We propose to model user dynamics from shopping intents and interacted items simultaneously. The learned intents are coarse-grained and work as prior knowledge for item recommendation. To this end, we present a coarse-to-fine self-attention framework, namely CaFe, which explicitly learns coarse-grained and fine-grained sequential dynamics. Specifically, CaFe first learns intents from coarse-grained sequences which are dense and hence provide high-quality user intent representations.

Accurately estimating post-click conversion rate (CVR) is often considered as the primary task of multi-task learning in recommender systems. However, some advertisers may try to get higher click-through rates (CTR) by over-decorating their ads, which may result in excessive exposure to samples with lower CVR. For example, some only eye-catching clickbait have higher CTR, but actually, CVR is very low. As a result, the overall performance of the recommender system will be hurt. In this paper, we introduce a novelty auxiliary task called CTnoCVR, which aims to predict the probability of events with click but no-conversion, in various state-of-the-art multi-task models of recommender systems to promote samples with high CVR but low CTR. Plentiful Experiments on a large-scale dataset gathered from traffic logs of Taobao's recommender system demonstrate that the introduction of CTnoCVR task significantly improves the prediction effect of CVR under various multi-task frameworks. In addition, we conduct the online test and evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method to make those samples with high CVR and low CTR rank higher.|近年来，推荐系统中基于深度学习的多任务学习模型越来越受到业界和学术界的关注。在推荐系统中，准确估计点击后转换率(CVR)常常被认为是多任务学习的首要任务。然而，一些广告商可能试图通过过度装饰他们的广告来获得更高的点击率(CTR) ，这可能导致过度暴露于低 CVR 的样品。例如，一些只有吸引眼球的点击诱饵有较高的点击率，但实际上，CVR 是非常低的。因此，推荐系统的整体表现将受到影响。本文介绍了一种新颖的辅助任务 CTnoCVR，该任务在推荐系统的多任务模型中预测点击不转换的事件发生概率，以提升高 CVR 低 CTR 的样本。大量的实验表明，在多任务框架下，引入 CTnoCVR 任务可以显著提高 CVR 的预测效果。这些实验都是从淘宝推荐系统的流量日志中收集的大规模数据集中得到的。此外，我们进行了在线测试，并评估了我们提出的方法的有效性，使高 CVR 和低 CTR 排名的样本。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=CTnoCVR:+A+Novelty+Auxiliary+Task+Making+the+Lower-CTR-Higher-CVR+Upper)|0|
|[Smooth-AUC: Smoothing the Path Towards Rank-based CTR Prediction](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531865)|Shuang Tang, Fangyuan Luo, Jun Wu|Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China|Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been a key technique for click-through rate (CTR) estimation, yet existing DNNs-based CTR models neglect the inconsistency between their optimization objectives (e.g., Binary Cross Entropy, BCE) and CTR ranking metrics (e.g., Area Under the ROC Curve, AUC). It is noteworthy that directly optimizing AUC by gradient-descent methods is difficult due to the non-differentiable Heaviside function built-in AUC. To this end, we propose a smooth approximation of AUC, called smooth-AUC (SAUC), towards the rank-based CTR prediction. Specifically, SAUC relaxes the Heaviside function via sigmoid with a temperature coefficient (aiming at controlling the function sharpness) in order to facilitate the gradient-based optimization. Furthermore, SAUC is a plug-and-play objective that can be used in any DNNs-based CTR model. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that SAUC consistently improves the recommendation accuracy of current DNNs-based CTR models.|深度神经网络(DNN)一直是点进率评估的关键技术，然而现有的基于 DNN 的 CTR 模型忽略了它们的优化目标(例如，二进制交叉熵，BCE)和 CTR 排名指标(例如，ROC Curve 下面积，AUC)之间的不一致性。值得注意的是，由于 AUC 内置的不可微单位阶跃函数，用梯度下降法直接优化 AUC 是困难的。为此，我们提出了一种平滑近似的 AUC，称为平滑 AUC (SAUC) ，用于基于秩的 CTR 预测。具体来说，SAUC 通过 sigmoid 放松单位阶跃函数(目的是控制函数的清晰度) ，以便于基于梯度的优化温度系数。此外，SAUC 是一个即插即用的目标，可以在任何基于 DNN 的 CTR 模型中使用。在两个实际数据集上的实验结果表明，SAUC 一致地提高了当前基于 DNN 的 CTR 模型的推荐精度。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Smooth-AUC:+Smoothing+the+Path+Towards+Rank-based+CTR+Prediction)|0|

In this work, we propose to train the sequential recommenders as discriminators rather than generators. Instead of predicting the next item, our method trains a discriminator to distinguish if a sampled item is a 'real' target item or not.

This is recognised by the broader IR community, and in particular by the organisers of Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) as early as 2003. While TREC provides crucial evaluation resources, to get started in biomedical IR one needs to tackle an important software engineering hurdle of parsing, indexing, and deploying several large document collections. Moreover, many newcomers to the field often face a steep learning curve, where theoretical concepts are tangled up with technical aspects. Finally, many of the existing baselines and systems are difficult to reproduce. We aim to alleviate all three of these bottlenecks with the launch of A2A-API. It is a RESTful API which serves as an easy-to-use and programming-language-independent interface to existing biomedical TREC collections. It builds upon A2A, our system for biomedical information retrieval benchmarking, and extends it with additional functionalities. Apart from providing programmatic access to the features of the original A2A system - focused principally on benchmarking - A2A-API supports biomedical IR researchers in development of systems featuring reranking and query reformulation components.

For each keystroke, new results are rendered on screen to the user, which could contain movies, television series, sporting events, music videos, news clips, person pages, and other result types. Users are also able to use the Xfinity Voice Remote to submit longer queries, some of which are more open-ended. Examples of queries include incomplete words which match multiple results through lexical matching (i.e., "ali"), topical searches ("vampire movies"), and more specific longer searches ("Movies with Adam Sandler"). Since results can be based on lexical matches, semantic matches, item-to-item similarity matches, or a variety of business logic driven sources, a key challenge is how to combine results into a single list. To accomplish this, we propose merging the lists via a Learning to Rank (LTR) neural model which takes into account the search query. This combined list can be personalized via a second LTR neural model with knowledge of the user's search history and metadata of the programs. Because instant search is under-represented in the literature, we present our learnings from research to aid other practitioners.|在 Xfinity，即时搜索系统为来自不同来源的特定查询提供多种结果。对于每次按键，新的结果都会在屏幕上呈现给用户，其中可能包含电影、电视剧、体育赛事、音乐视频、新闻剪辑、人物页面和其他结果类型。用户还可以使用 Xfinity Voice Remote 提交更长的查询，其中一些查询更为开放。查询的例子包括通过词汇匹配(例如“ ali”)匹配多个结果的不完整单词、主题搜索(“吸血鬼电影”)和更具体的长搜索(“与 Adam Sandler 的电影”)。由于结果可以基于词汇匹配、语义匹配、项目间相似性匹配或各种业务逻辑驱动源，因此一个关键的挑战是如何将结果组合成一个单独的列表。为了实现这一点，我们建议通过一个学习排序(LTR)神经模型，考虑到搜索查询合并列表。这个组合列表可以通过第二个具有用户搜索历史和程序元数据知识的 LTR 神经模型进行个性化。因为即时搜索在文献中的代表性不足，我们提出我们从研究中学到的东西来帮助其他从业者。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Learning+to+Rank+Instant+Search+Results+with+Multiple+Indices:+A+Case+Study+in+Search+Aggregation+for+Entertainment)|0|

Driven by the recent developments in optimization and generalization of DNNs, learning a neural ranking model online from its interactions with users becomes possible. However, the required exploration for model learning has to be performed in the entire neural network parameter space, which is prohibitively expensive and limits the application of such online solutions in practice. In this work, we propose an efficient exploration strategy for online interactive neural ranker learning based on bootstrapping. Our solution is based on an ensemble of ranking models trained with perturbed user click feedback. The proposed method eliminates explicit confidence set construction and the associated computational overhead, which enables the online neural rankers training to be efficiently executed in practice with theoretical guarantees.

|[Towards Validating Long-Term User Feedbacks in Interactive Recommendation Systems](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531869)|Hojoon Lee, Dongyoon Hwang, Kyushik Min, Jaegul Choo|KAIST, SeongNam, Republic of Korea; KAKAO Enterprise, SeongNam, Republic of Korea|Interactive Recommender Systems (IRSs) have attracted a lot of attention, due to their ability to model interactive processes between users and recommender systems. Numerous approaches have adopted Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms, as these can directly maximize users' cumulative rewards. In IRS, researchers commonly utilize publicly available review datasets to compare and evaluate algorithms. However, user feedback provided in public datasets merely includes instant responses (e.g., a rating), with no inclusion of delayed responses (e.g., the dwell time and the lifetime value). Thus, the question remains whether these review datasets are an appropriate choice to evaluate the long-term effects in IRS. In this work, we revisited experiments on IRS with review datasets and compared RL-based models with a simple reward model that greedily recommends the item with the highest one-step reward. Following extensive analysis, we can reveal three main findings: First, a simple greedy reward model consistently outperforms RL-based models in maximizing cumulative rewards. Second, applying higher weighting to long-term rewards leads to degradation of recommendation performance. Third, user feedbacks have mere long-term effects in the benchmark datasets. Based on our findings, we conclude that a dataset has to be carefully verified and that a simple greedy baseline should be included for a proper evaluation of RL-based IRS approaches. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/dojeon-ai/irs_validation.|交互式推荐系统(IRS)由于能够对用户和推荐系统之间的交互过程进行建模而引起了人们的广泛关注。许多方法都采用了强化学习算法，因为这些算法可以直接最大化用户的累积回报。在 IRS 中，研究人员通常利用公开的评论数据集来比较和评估算法。然而，在公共数据集中提供的用户反馈只包括即时响应(例如，评级) ，没有包括延迟响应(例如，停留时间和生命周期值)。因此，问题仍然是这些审查数据集是否是评估 IRS 长期影响的合适选择。在这项工作中，我们重新回顾了 IRS 的实验与评论数据集，并比较了基于 RL 的模型与一个简单的奖励模型，贪婪地推荐项目具有最高的一步奖励。经过广泛的分析，我们可以揭示三个主要的发现: 第一，一个简单的贪婪报酬模型在最大化累积报酬方面始终优于基于 RL 的模型。其次，对长期奖励加权会导致推荐绩效的下降。第三，用户反馈在基准数据集中只有长期效果。基于我们的研究结果，我们得出结论，一个数据集必须被仔细验证，并且一个简单的贪婪基线应该被包括在一个基于 RL 的 IRS 方法的正确评估中。我们的代码和数据集可在 https://github.com/dojeon-ai/irs_validation 下载。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Towards+Validating+Long-Term+User+Feedbacks+in+Interactive+Recommendation+Systems)|0|

Existing CDR approaches mainly consider the standard scenario that the cross-domain data for both training and testing come from the same categories and underlying distributions. However, these methods cannot be well extended to the newly emerging task of universal cross-domain retrieval (UCDR), where the testing data belong to the domain and categories not present during training. Compared to CDR, the UCDR task is more challenging due to (1) visually diverse data from multi-source domains, (2) the domain shift between seen and unseen domains, and (3) the semantic shift across seen and unseen categories. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel model termed Structure-Aware Semantic-Aligned Network (SASA) to align the heterogeneous representations of multi-source domains without loss of generalizability for the UCDR task. Specifically, we leverage the advanced Vision Transformer (ViT) as the backbone and devise a distillation-alignment ViT (DAViT) with a novel token-based strategy, which incorporates two complementary distillation and alignment tokens into the ViT architecture. In addition, the distillation token is devised to improve the generalizability of our model by structure information preservation and the alignment token is used to improve discriminativeness with trainable categorical prototypes. Extensive experiments on three large-scale benchmarks, i.e., Sketchy, TU-Berlin, and DomainNet, demonstrate the superiority of our SASA method over the state-of-the-art UCDR and ZS-SBIR methods.|跨域检索(CDR)的目标是通过使用来自另一个域的查询在一个域中搜索相同类别的实例。现有的 CDR 方法主要考虑这样的标准场景: 用于培训和测试的跨域数据来自相同的类别和底层分布。然而，这些方法不能很好地推广到新出现的通用跨域检索(UCDR)任务，其中的测试数据属于领域和类别不存在的训练过程中。与 CDR 相比，UCDR 任务更具挑战性，因为(1)来自多源域的视觉多样化数据，(2)可见和不可见域之间的域转移，以及(3)跨可见和不可见类别的语义转移。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种称为结构感知语义对齐网络(SASA)的新模型，该模型可以在不损失 UCDR 任务通用性的前提下对多源域的异构表示进行对齐。具体而言，我们利用先进的视觉变压器(ViT)作为骨干，并设计了一种蒸馏对准 ViT (DAViT) ，其具有基于令牌的新策略，其将两个互补的蒸馏和对准令牌合并到 ViT 体系结构中。此外，通过结构信息的保留，设计了精馏令牌来提高模型的泛化能力，并利用对齐令牌来提高可训练范畴原型的区分能力。在 Sketchy、 TU-Berlin 和 DomainNet 这三个大型基准测试上的大量实验证明了我们的 SASA 方法优于最先进的 UCDR 和 ZS-SBIR 方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Structure-Aware+Semantic-Aligned+Network+for+Universal+Cross-Domain+Retrieval)|0|

Based on the intuition that the text in the title and abstract have both semantic and syntactic components, we demonstrate that a joint training of a semantic feature extractor and syntactic feature extractor collaboratively leverages meaningful information that helps to provide venues for papers. The proposed methodology that we call DeSCoVeR at first elicits these semantic and syntactic features using a Neural Topic Model and text classifier respectively. The model then executes a transfer learning optimization procedure to perform a contextual transfer between the feature distributions of the Neural Topic Model and the text classifier during the training phase. DeSCoVeR also mitigates the document-level label bias using a Causal back-door path criterion and a sentence-level keyword bias removal technique. Experiments on the DBLP dataset show that DeSCoVeR outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.|我们提出了一个新的基于语义上下文先验的场地推荐系统，它只使用文章的标题和摘要。基于标题和摘要中的文本同时具有语义和句法成分的直觉，我们证明了语义特征提取器和句法特征提取器的联合训练协同利用有意义的信息，有助于为论文提供场所。我们提出的方法，我们称为 DeSCoVeR 首先引出这些语义和句法特征使用神经主题模型和文本分类器分别。然后，该模型执行一个迁移学习优化过程，在训练阶段在神经主题模型的特征分布和文本分类器之间进行上下文迁移。DeSCoVeR 还使用因果后门路径标准和句子级关键字偏差消除技术来减轻文档级标签偏差。在 DBLP 数据集上的实验表明，DeSCoVeR 方法的性能优于最先进的方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=DeSCoVeR:+Debiased+Semantic+Context+Prior+for+Venue+Recommendation)|0|

Current research on bundle recommendation is limited by: (1) noisy datasets, where bundles are defined by heuristics, e.g., products co-purchased in the same session; and (2) specific tasks, holding unrealistic assumptions, e.g., the availability of bundles for recommendation directly. In this paper, we propose to take a step back and consider the process of bundle recommendation from a holistic user experience perspective. We first construct high-quality bundle datasets with rich meta information, particularly bundle intents, through a carefully designed crowd-sourcing task. We then define a series of tasks that together, support all key steps in a typical bundle recommendation process, from bundle detection, completion, ranking, to explanation and auto-naming. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments and in-depth analysis that demonstrate the challenges of bundle recommendation, arising from the need for capturing complex relations among users, products, and bundles, as well as the research opportunities, especially in graph-based neural methods. To sum up, our study delivers new data sources, opens up new research directions, and provides useful guidance for product bundling in real e-commerce platforms.

Such a query-to-facet mapping system has a multitude of applications. It can help improve the quality of search results, drive meaningful result organization, and can be leveraged to establish trust by being transparent with Netflix members when they search for an entity that is not available on the service. By anticipating the relevant facets with each keystroke entry, the system can also better guide the experience within a search session. When aggregated across queries, the facets can reveal interesting patterns of member interest. A key challenge for building such a system is to judiciously balance lexical similarity with behavioral relevance. In this paper, we present a high level overview of a Query Facet Mapping system that we have developed at Netflix, describe its main components, provide evaluation results with real-world data, and outline several potential applications.|在像 Netflix Search 这样的即时搜索设置中，每次按键都会返回结果，确定一个部分查询如何映射到相关实体或方面的广泛类别——比如视频、人才和类型——可以促进对该查询的潜在目标的更好理解。这种查询到面的映射系统有大量的应用程序。它可以帮助提高搜索结果的质量，推动有意义的结果组织，并且可以通过在 Netflix 成员搜索服务中不可用的实体时对其保持透明来建立信任。通过预测每个按键输入的相关方面，系统还可以更好地指导搜索会话中的体验。当跨查询聚合时，方面可以显示成员感兴趣的有趣模式。建立这样一个系统的关键挑战是明智地平衡词汇相似性和行为相关性。本文对我们在 Netflix 上开发的 Query Facet Mapping 系统进行了高层次的概述，描述了它的主要组件，提供了实际数据的评估结果，并概述了几个潜在的应用。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Query+Facet+Mapping+and+its+Applications+in+Streaming+Services:+The+Netflix+Case+Study)|0|

We consider the specific case in which click data from a historic click log is available as implicit feedback. We then exploit such historic implicit interactions to improve the effectiveness of a DR. A key challenge that we study is the effect that biases in the click signal, such as position bias, have on the DRs. To overcome the problems associated with the presence of such bias, we propose the Counterfactual Rocchio (CoRocchio) algorithm for exploiting implicit feedback in Dense Retrievers. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that dense query representations learnt with CoRocchio are unbiased with respect to position bias and lead to higher retrieval effectiveness.

Refining the ranker that produces the lists displayed in response to user requests is an important component of this process. A common practice is for the service providers to make changes (e.g. new ranking features, different ranking models) and A/B test them on a fraction of their users to establish the value of the change. An alternative approach estimates the effectiveness of the proposed changes offline, utilising previously collected clickthrough data on the old ranker to posit what the user behaviour on ranked lists produced by the new ranker would have been. A majority of offline evaluation approaches invoke the well studied inverse propensity weighting to adjust for biases inherent in logged data. In this paper, we propose the use of parametric estimates for these propensities. Specifically, by leveraging well known learning-to-rank methods as subroutines, we show how accurate offline evaluation can be achieved when the new rankings to be evaluated differ from the logged ones.|搜索引擎和推荐系统试图不断提高它们为用户提供的体验的质量。优化生成响应用户请求的列表的排名是这个过程的一个重要组成部分。一个常见的做法是，服务提供商进行更改(例如，新的排名功能，不同的排名模型)和 A/B 测试他们的一小部分用户，以建立变化的价值。另一种方法是利用先前收集到的老排名者的点击数据，来估计新排名者生成的排名表上的用户行为的有效性。大多数离线评估方法都会调用经过充分研究的倾向性反向加权来调整测井数据中固有的偏差。在本文中，我们提出了这些倾向的参数估计的使用。具体来说，通过利用众所周知的学习排名方法作为子程序，我们展示了当评估的新排名与记录的排名不同时，如何实现准确的离线评估。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Offline+Evaluation+of+Ranked+Lists+using+Parametric+Estimation+of+Propensities)|0|

It is a non-trivial task since the searching space is vast, which may lead to distinct travel experiences in different out-of-town regions and eventually confuse decision-making. Besides, users' out-of-town travel behaviors are affected not only by their personalized preferences but heavily by others' travel behaviors. To this end, we propose a Crowd-Aware Pre-Travel Out-of-town Recommendation framework (CAPTOR) consisting of two major modules: spatial-affined conditional random field (SA-CRF) and crowd behavior memory network (CBMN). Specifically, SA-CRF captures the spatial affinity among POIs while preserving the inherent information of POIs. Then, CBMN is proposed to maintain the crowd travel behaviors w.r.t. each region through three affiliated blocks reading and writing the memory adaptively. We devise the elaborated metric space with a dynamic mapping mechanism, where the users and POIs are distinguishable both inherently and geographically.

|[Unify Local and Global Information for Top-N Recommendation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3532070)|Xiaoming Liu, Shaocong Wu, Zhaohan Zhang, Chao Shen||Knowledge graph (KG), integrating complex information and containing rich semantics, is widely considered as side information to enhance the recommendation systems. However, most of the existing KG-based methods concentrate on encoding the structural information in the graph, without utilizing the collaborative signals in user-item interaction data, which are important for understanding user preferences. Therefore, the representations learned by these models are insufficient for representing semantic information of users and items in the recommendation environment. The combination of both kinds of data provides a good chance to solve this problem, but it faces the following challenges: i) the inner correlations in user-item interaction data are difficult to capture from one side of the user or item; ii) capturing the knowledge associations on the whole KG would introduce noises and variously influence the recommendation results; iii) the semantic gap between both kinds of data is hard to alleviate. To tackle this research gap, we propose a novel duet representation learning framework named KADM to fuse local information (user-item interaction data) and global information (external knowledge graph) for the top-N recommendation, which is composed of two separate sub-models. One learns the local representations by discovering the inner correlations in local information with a knowledge-aware co-attention mechanism, and another learns the global representations by encoding the knowledge associations in global information with a relation-aware attention network. The two sub-models are jointly trained as part of the semantic fusion network to compute the user preferences, which discriminates the contribution of the two sub-models under the special context. We conduct experiments on two real-world datasets, and the evaluations show that KADM significantly outperforms state-of-art methods. Further ablation studies confirm that the duet architecture performs significantly better than either sub-model on the recommendation tasks.|知识图集成了复杂的信息，包含丰富的语义，被广泛认为是增强推荐系统的边信息。然而，现有的基于 KG 的方法大多集中于对图中的结构信息进行编码，而没有利用用户交互数据中的协作信号，这对于理解用户偏好非常重要。因此，这些模型所学到的表示方法不足以表示推荐环境中用户和项目的语义信息。这两种数据的结合为解决这一问题提供了很好的机会，但它面临着以下挑战: 1)用户项目交互数据的内部相关性难以从用户或项目的一侧获取; 2)捕捉整个 KG 的知识关联会引入噪声并对推荐结果产生各种影响; 3)两种数据之间的语义差异难以缓解。为了解决这一问题，本文提出了一种新的二元表示学习框架 KADM，它融合了顶层 N 推荐的局部信息(用户项目交互数据)和全局信息(外部知识图) ，该框架由两个独立的子模型组成。一种是通过知识感知共注意机制发现局部信息的内在相关性来学习局部表征，另一种是通过关系感知注意网络对全局信息中的知识关联进行编码来学习全局表征。将这两个子模型作为语义融合网络的一部分进行联合训练，以计算用户偏好，从而区分两个子模型在特定语境下的贡献。我们在两个真实世界的数据集上进行了实验，结果表明 KADM 的性能明显优于最先进的方法。进一步的消融研究证实，二重奏架构在推荐任务上的表现明显优于任何一个子模型。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Unify+Local+and+Global+Information+for+Top-N+Recommendation)|0|

Due to the lack of sufficient interactions, it is difficult to effectively model new users. One of the main solutions is to obtain an initial model through meta-learning (mainly gradient-based methods) and adapt it to new users with a few steps of gradient descent. Although these methods have achieved remarkable performance, they are still far from being usable in real-world applications due to their high-demand data processing, heavy computational burden, and inability to perform effective user-incremental update. In this paper, we propose a d eployable and c ontinuable m eta-learning-based r ecommendation (DCMR) approach, which can achieve fast user-incremental updating with task replay and first-order gradient descent. Specifically, we introduce a dual-constrained task sampler, distillation-based loss functions, and an adaptive controller in this framework to balance the trade-off between stability and plasticity in updating. In summary, DCMR can be updated while serving new users; in other words, it learns continuously and rapidly from a sequential user stream and is able to make recommendations at any time. The extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets illustrate the superiority of our model.|用户冷启动是构建个性化推荐系统的主要挑战。由于缺乏足够的交互，很难对新用户进行有效的建模。其中一个主要的解决方案是通过元学习(主要是基于梯度的方法)获得一个初始模型，并通过几个步骤使其适应新用户的梯度下降法。虽然这些方法已经取得了显著的性能，但是由于其高需求的数据处理、沉重的计算负担以及不能执行有效的用户增量更新，它们在实际应用中仍然远远不能使用。在本文中，我们提出了一种可部署和可持续的基于元学习的 r 推荐(dCMR)方法，它可以通过任务重播和一阶梯度下降法实现快速的用户增量更新。具体来说，我们引入了一个双约束任务采样器，基于蒸馏的损失函数，以及在这个框架中的一个自适应控制器，以平衡稳定性和可塑性之间的权衡在更新。总之，DCMR 可以在为新用户提供服务的同时进行更新; 换句话说，它可以从连续的用户流中不断快速地学习，并且能够在任何时候提出建议。在三个基准数据集上进行的大量实验表明了该模型的优越性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Deployable+and+Continuable+Meta-learning-Based+Recommender+System+with+Fast+User-Incremental+Updates)|0|

Hall, Huan Liu|Arizona State University, Glendale, AZ, USA; Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA; Loyola University Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA|Increased social media use has contributed to the greater prevalence of abusive, rude, and offensive textual comments. Machine learning models have been developed to detect toxic comments online, yet these models tend to show biases against users with marginalized or minority identities (e.g., females and African Americans). Established research in debiasing toxicity classifiers often (1) takes a static or batch approach, assuming that all information is available and then making a one-time decision; and (2) uses a generic strategy to mitigate different biases (e.g., gender and racial biases) that assumes the biases are independent of one another. However, in real scenarios, the input typically arrives as a sequence of comments/words over time instead of all at once. Thus, decisions based on partial information must be made while additional input is arriving. Moreover, social bias is complex by nature. Each type of bias is defined within its unique context, which, consistent with intersectionality theory within the social sciences, might be correlated with the contexts of other forms of bias. In this work, we consider debiasing toxicity detection as a sequential decision-making process where different biases can be interdependent. In particular, we study debiasing toxicity detection with two aims: (1) to examine whether different biases tend to correlate with each other; and (2) to investigate how to jointly mitigate these correlated biases in an interactive manner to minimize the total amount of bias. At the core of our approach is a framework built upon theories of sequential Markov Decision Processes that seeks to maximize the prediction accuracy and minimize the bias measures tailored to individual biases. Evaluations on two benchmark datasets empirically validate the hypothesis that biases tend to be correlated and corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed sequential debiasing strategy.|越来越多的社交媒体使用导致了辱骂、粗鲁和冒犯性的文字评论更加普遍。机器学习模型已经被开发用来检测网上的有毒评论，然而这些模型往往显示出对边缘化或少数族裔身份的用户(例如，女性和非裔美国人)的偏见。已建立的减少毒性分类器的研究通常(1)采用静态或批量方法，假设所有信息都可用，然后做出一次性决策; (2)使用通用策略来减轻假定偏见彼此独立的不同偏见(例如性别和种族偏见)。然而，在真实的场景中，输入通常是以注释/单词序列的形式随着时间的推移而到达，而不是一次性全部到达。因此，当额外的输入到达时，必须根据部分信息做出决策。此外，社会偏见本质上是复杂的。每种类型的偏见都是在其独特的背景下定义的，这与社会科学中的交叉性理论一致，可能与其他形式的偏见的背景相关。在这项工作中，我们认为去偏毒性检测是一个连续的决策过程中，不同的偏见可以相互依赖。具体而言，我们研究去偏毒性检测有两个目的: (1)检查不同的偏倚是否倾向于相互关联; (2)研究如何以交互方式共同减轻这些相关偏倚，以最小化偏倚总量。我们的方法的核心是一个建立在序贯马尔可夫决策过程理论基础上的框架，该框架寻求最大限度地提高预测的准确性，最小化针对个别偏差的偏差测量。对两个基准数据集的评估经验验证了偏差倾向于相关的假设，并证实了所提出的序贯去偏策略的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Bias+Mitigation+for+Toxicity+Detection+via+Sequential+Decisions)|0|

Then, we envision a scenario wherein platform owners seek to control the degree of exposure to such groups in the recommendation process. To support this scenario, we rely on disparate exposure measures that characterize the gap between the share of recommendations given to groups and the target level of exposure pursued by the platform owners. We then propose a re-ranking procedure that ensures desired levels of exposure are met. Experiments show that, while supporting certain groups of providers by rendering them with the target exposure, beyond-accuracy objectives experience significant gains with negligible impact in recommendation utility.|吸引所有内容提供商，包括新来者或少数族裔群体，对于在线平台保持增长和运作至关重要。因此，在构建推荐服务时，应该重视这些提供者的利益。在本文中，我们认为提供程序是基于一个共同特征进行分组的，在这种情况下，某些提供程序组在目录中的项表示较低，因此在用户交互中也是如此。然后，我们设想一个场景，其中平台所有者寻求控制在推荐过程中暴露于这些群体的程度。为了支持这一设想，我们依靠不同的曝光度量标准，这些标准体现了给予群体的建议份额与平台所有者追求的曝光度目标水平之间的差距。然后，我们提出了一个重新排序的程序，以确保所需的暴露水平得到满足。实验表明，虽然支持某些群体的供应商，使他们的目标暴露，超过准确性的目标经历了显着的收益，对推荐效用的影响可以忽略不计。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Regulating+Group+Exposure+for+Item+Providers+in+Recommendation)|0|

However, existing micro-video recommendation models rely on expensive multi-modal information and learn an overall interest embedding that cannot reflect the user's multiple interests in micro-videos. Recently, contrastive learning provides a new opportunity for refining the existing recommendation techniques. Therefore, in this paper, we propose to extract contrastive multi-interests and devise a micro-video recommendation model CMI. Specifically, CMI learns multiple interest embeddings for each user from his/her historical interaction sequence, in which the implicit orthogonal micro-video categories are used to decouple multiple user interests. Moreover, it establishes the contrastive multi-interest loss to improve the robustness of interest embeddings and the performance of recommendations. The results of experiments on two micro-video datasets demonstrate that CMI achieves state-of-the-art performance over existing baselines.|随着微视频制作者和观众的迅速增多，如何从大量的候选人中向观众提供个性化的推荐，开始引起越来越多的关注。然而，现有的微视频推荐模型依赖于昂贵的多模态信息，学习的总体兴趣嵌入不能反映用户在微视频中的多重兴趣。近年来，对比学习为完善现有的推荐技术提供了一个新的机会。因此，本文提出提取对比多兴趣并设计一个微视频推荐模型 CMI。具体来说，CMI 从每个用户的历史交互序列中学习多个兴趣嵌入，其中使用隐式正交微视频类别来解耦多个用户兴趣。此外，本文还建立了对比的多利益损失模型，以提高利益嵌入的鲁棒性和建议的执行效率。在两个微视频数据集上的实验结果表明，CMI 在现有的基线上取得了最好的性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Improving+Micro-video+Recommendation+via+Contrastive+Multiple+Interests)|0|
|[Can Users Predict Relative Query Effectiveness?](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531893)|Oleg Zendel, Melika P. Ebrahim, J. Shane Culpepper, Alistair Moffat, Falk Scholer|The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia; RMIT University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia|Any given information need can be expressed via a wide range of possible queries. Recent work with such query variations has demonstrated that different queries can fetch notably divergent sets of documents, even when the queries have identical intents and superficial similarity. That is, different users might receive SERPs of quite different effectiveness for the same information need. That observation then raises an interesting question: do users have a sense of how useful any given query will be? Can they anticipate the effectiveness of alternative queries for the same retrieval need? To explore that question we designed and carried out a crowd-sourced user study in which we asked subjects to consider an information need statement expressed as a backstory, and then provide their opinions as to the relative usefulness of a set of queries ostensibly addressing that objective. We solicited opinions using two different interfaces: one that collected absolute ratings of queries, and one that required that the subjects place a set of queries into "order". We found that crowd workers are reasonably consistent in their estimates of how effective queries are likely to be, and also that their estimates correlate positively with actual system performance.|任何给定的信息需求都可以通过各种可能的查询来表示。最近对这种查询变体的研究表明，不同的查询可以获取明显不同的文档集，即使查询具有相同的意图和表面上的相似性。也就是说，对于相同的信息需求，不同的用户可能会收到效果完全不同的 SERP。这种观察提出了一个有趣的问题: 用户是否知道任何给定的查询有多大用处？他们能够预测相同检索需求的替代查询的有效性吗？为了探索这个问题，我们设计并进行了一个众包用户研究，在这个研究中，我们要求受试者考虑一个表达为背景故事的信息需求陈述，然后提供他们对一组表面上针对该目标的查询的相对有用性的意见。我们使用两种不同的界面来征求意见: 一种是收集查询的绝对评分，另一种是要求被试将一组查询按顺序排列。我们发现，人群工作者对查询可能的有效性的估计是相当一致的，而且他们的估计与实际系统性能正相关。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Can+Users+Predict+Relative+Query+Effectiveness?)|0|
|[Is Non-IID Data a Threat in Federated Online Learning to Rank?](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531709)|Shuyi Wang, Guido Zuccon|The University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia|In this perspective paper we study the effect of non independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data on federated online learning to rank (FOLTR) and chart directions for future work in this new and largely unexplored research area of Information Retrieval. In the FOLTR process, clients participate in a federation to jointly create an effective ranker from the implicit click signal originating in each client, without the need to share data (documents, queries, clicks). A well-known factor that affects the performance of federated learning systems, and that poses serious challenges to these approaches, is that there may be some type of bias in the way data is distributed across clients. While FOLTR systems are on their own rights a type of federated learning system, the presence and effect of non-IID data in FOLTR has not been studied. To this aim, we first enumerate possible data distribution settings that may showcase data bias across clients and thus give rise to the non-IID problem. Then, we study the impact of each setting on the performance of the current state-of-the-art FOLTR approach, the Federated Pairwise Differentiable Gradient Descent (FPDGD), and we highlight which data distributions may pose a problem for FOLTR methods. We also explore how common approaches proposed in the federated learning literature address non-IID issues in FOLTR. This allows us to unveil new research gaps that, we argue, future research in FOLTR should consider.|在这篇前瞻性的论文中，我们研究了非独立和同分布(非 IID)数据对联邦在线学习排名(FOLTR)的影响，以及未来工作的图表方向，这是一个新的、很大程度上尚未探索的信息检索研究领域。在 FOLTR 过程中，客户端参与到一个联合中，从每个客户端发出的隐式点击信号中共同创建一个有效的排名，而不需要共享数据(文档、查询、点击)。影响联邦学习系统性能的一个众所周知的因素是，数据在客户端之间的分布方式可能存在某种偏差，这对这些方法提出了严峻的挑战。虽然 FOLTR 系统本身就是一种联邦学习系统，但是对于 FOLTR 中非 IID 数据的存在和影响还没有进行研究。为此，我们首先列举可能的数据分布设置，这些设置可能显示客户端之间的数据偏差，从而引起非 IID 问题。然后，我们研究了每种设置对当前最先进的 FOLTR 方法——联邦成对可微分梯度下降法(fPDGD)——性能的影响，并强调了哪些数据分布可能会给 FOLTR 方法带来问题。我们还探讨了联合学习文献中提出的常用方法如何解决 FOLTR 中的非 IID 问题。这使我们能够揭示新的研究差距，我们认为，在 FOLTR 的未来研究应该考虑。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Is+Non-IID+Data+a+Threat+in+Federated+Online+Learning+to+Rank?)|0|

In the English field, the availability of large-scale annotated dataset (e.g, MS MARCO) and the emergence of deep pre-trained language models (e.g, BERT) has resulted in a substantial improvement of existing passage retrieval systems. However, in the Chinese field, especially for specific domains, passage retrieval systems are still immature due to quality-annotated dataset being limited by scale. Therefore, in this paper, we present a novel multi-domain Chinese dataset for passage retrieval (Multi-CPR). The dataset is collected from three different domains, including E-commerce, Entertainment video and Medical. Each dataset contains millions of passages and a certain amount of human annotated query-passage related pairs. We implement various representative passage retrieval methods as baselines. We find that the performance of retrieval models trained on dataset from general domain will inevitably decrease on specific domain. Nevertheless, a passage retrieval system built on in-domain annotated dataset can achieve significant improvement, which indeed demonstrates the necessity of domain labeled data for further optimization. We hope the release of the Multi-CPR dataset could benchmark Chinese passage retrieval task in specific domain and also make advances for future studies.|短文检索是信息检索研究中的一项基础性工作，近年来备受关注。在英语领域，大规模注释数据集(例如 MS MARCO)的可用性和深度预训练语言模型(例如 BERT)的出现使现有的文章检索系统得到了实质性的改进。然而，在中文领域，特别是在特定领域，由于质量注释数据集受到规模的限制，文章检索系统还不成熟。因此，本文提出了一种新的多领域中文文本检索数据集(Multi-CPR)。该数据集收集自三个不同的领域，包括电子商务，娱乐视频和医疗。每个数据集包含数百万个段落和一定数量的人工注释的查询-段落相关对。我们实现了各种具有代表性的文章检索方法作为基线。研究发现，对一般领域数据集训练的检索模型在特定领域的性能不可避免地会下降。然而，建立在域内注释数据集上的文章检索系统可以取得显著的改进，这确实说明了域标记数据进一步优化的必要性。我们希望通过多 CPR 数据集的发布，能够为特定领域的中文文章检索任务提供基准，并为今后的研究提供参考。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Multi-CPR:+A+Multi+Domain+Chinese+Dataset+for+Passage+Retrieval)|0|

While modern systems are dominated by DaaT, the academic literature has seen decades of debate about the merits of each. Recently, there has been renewed interest in SaaT methods for learned sparse lexical models, where studies have shown that transformers generate "wacky weights" that appear to reduce opportunities for optimizations in DaaT methods. However, researchers currently lack an easy-to-use SaaT system to support further exploration. This is the gap that our work fills. Starting with a modern SaaT system (JASS), we built Python bindings in order to integrate into the DaaT Pyserini IR toolkit (Lucene). The result is a common frontend to both a DaaT and a SaaT system. We demonstrate how recent experiments with a wide range of learned sparse lexical models can be easily reproduced. Our contribution is a framework that enables future research comparing DaaT and SaaT methods in the context of modern neural retrieval models.|一次文档(DaaT)和一次得分(SaaT)查询评估技术是两种不同的方法，用于带有倒排索引的 top-k 检索。虽然现代系统是由 DaaT 主导的，但学术文献已经对每个系统的优点进行了数十年的争论。最近，人们对学习稀疏词汇模型的 SaaT 方法重新产生了兴趣，研究表明，变压器产生的“古怪的权重”似乎减少了 DaaT 方法优化的机会。然而，研究人员目前缺乏一个易于使用的 SaaT 系统来支持进一步的探索。这是我们的工作填补的空白。从一个现代 SaaT 系统(JASS)开始，我们构建了 Python 绑定，以便集成到 DaaT Pyserini IR 工具包(Lucene)中。其结果是 DaaT 和 SaaT 系统的共同前端。我们证明了最近的实验与广泛的学习稀疏词汇模型可以很容易地再现。我们的贡献是一个框架，使未来的研究比较 DaaT 和 SaaT 方法在现代神经检索模型的背景下。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=A+Common+Framework+for+Exploring+Document-at-a-Time+and+Score-at-a-Time+Retrieval+Methods)|0|

However, most existing LTR techniques mainly focus on homogeneous ranking. Taking QAC in Dianping search as an example, heterogeneous documents including suggested queries (SQ) and Point-of-Interests(POI) need to be ranked and presented to enhance user experience. New challenges are faced when conducting heterogeneous ranking, including inconsistent feature space and more serious position bias caused by distinct representation spaces. Therefore, we propose Deep Debiasing Experts Network (DDEN), a novel heterogeneous LTR approach based on Mixture-of-Experts architecture and gating network, to deal with the inconsistent feature space of documents in ranking system. Furthermore, DDEN mitigates the position bias by adopting adversarial-debiasing framework embedded with heterogeneous LTR techniques. We conduct reproducible experiments on industrial datasets from Dianping, one of the largest local life platforms, and deploy DDEN in online application. Results show that DDEN substantially improves ranking performance in offline evaluation and boost the overall click-through rate in online A/B test by 2.1%.|学习到排名(learning-to-Rank，LTR)广泛应用于许多信息检索场景，包括网络搜索和基于位置的服务(Location Based Services，LBS)搜索。然而，大多数现有的 LTR 技术主要集中在同质排序。以点评搜索中的质量控制(QAC)为例，需要对包括建议查询(SQ)和兴趣点(POI)在内的异构文档进行排序和呈现，以提高用户体验。异构排序面临的新挑战包括不一致的特征空间和不同表示空间引起的更严重的位置偏差。为此，本文提出了一种基于专家混合体系结构和门网络的异构 LTR 方法——深度去偏专家网络(Deep Debioning Expert Network，DDEN) ，用于处理排序系统中文档的不一致特征空间。此外，DDEN 通过采用嵌入异构 LTR 技术的对抗性消偏框架来缓解位置偏差。我们在本地最大的生活平台之一 Dianping 的工业数据集上进行可重复的实验，并在在线应用中部署 DDEN。结果显示，DDEN 大大提高了离线评估的排名表现，并使在线 A/B 测试的整体点进率提高了2.1% 。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=DDEN:+A+Heterogeneous+Learning-to-Rank+Approach+with+Deep+Debiasing+Experts+Network)|0|

Three primary disruptive changes set off this revolution: 1) increase in compute power, mobile internet, and advances in deep learning. The next decade is expected to be about the proliferation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices and sensors, which will generate exponentially larger amounts of data to reason over and pave the way for ambient computing. This will also give rise to new forms of interaction patterns with these systems. Users will have to interact with these systems under increasingly richer context and in real-time. Conversational AI has a critical role to play in this revolution, but only if it delivers on its promise of enabling natural, frictionless, and personalized interactions in any context the user is in, while hiding the complexity of these systems through ambient intelligence. However, current commercial conversational AI systems are trained primarily with a supervised learning paradigm, which is difficult, if not impossible, to scale by manually annotating data for increasingly complex sets of contextual conditions. Inherent ambiguity in natural language further complicates the problem. We need to devise new forms of learning paradigms and frameworks that will scale to this complexity.

The "adaptive" is reflected in its selection algorithm that can retrieve best-suited questions for student based on his/her estimated proficiency at each test step. Although there are many sophisticated selection algorithms for improving CAT's effectiveness, they are restricted and perturbed by the accuracy of current proficiency estimate, thus lacking robustness. To this end, we investigate a general method to enhance the robustness of existing algorithms by leveraging student's "multi-facet" nature during tests. Specifically, we present a generic optimization criterion Robust Adaptive Testing (RAT) for proficiency estimation via fusing multiple estimates at each step, which maintains a multi-facet description of student's potential proficiency. We further provide theoretical analyses of such estimator's desirable statistical properties: asymptotic unbiasedness, efficiency, and consistency.

|[Forest-based Deep Recommender](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531980)|Chao Feng, Defu Lian, Zheng Liu, Xing Xie, Le Wu, Enhong Chen|University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China; Hefei university of Technology, Hefei, China; Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China|With the development of deep learning techniques, deep recommendation models also achieve remarkable improvements in terms of recommendation accuracy. However, due to the large number of candidate items in practice and the high cost of preference computation, these methods also suffer from low efficiency of recommendation. The recently proposed tree-based deep recommendation models alleviate the problem by directly learning tree structure and representations under the guidance of recommendation objectives. However, such models have two shortcomings. First, the max-heap assumption in the hierarchical tree, in which the preference for a parent node should be the maximum between the preferences for its children, is difficult to satisfy in their binary classification objectives. Second, the learned index only includes a single tree, which is different from the widely-used multiple trees index, providing an opportunity to improve the accuracy of recommendation. To this end, we propose a Deep Forest-based Recommender (DeFoRec for short) for an efficient recommendation. In DeFoRec, all the trees generated during training process are retained to form the forest. When learning node representation of each tree, we have to satisfy the max-heap assumption as much as possible and mimic beam search behavior over the tree in the training stage. This is achieved by DeFoRec to regard the training task as multi-classification over tree nodes at the same level. However, the number of tree nodes grows exponentially with levels, making us to train the preference model by the guidance of sampled-softmax technique. The experiments are conducted on real-world datasets, validating the effectiveness of the proposed preference model learning method and tree learning method.|随着深度学习技术的发展，深度推荐模型在推荐精度方面也取得了显著的提高。然而，由于实际中候选项数量大，偏好计算成本高，这些方法也存在推荐效率低的问题。最近提出的基于树的深度推荐模型通过在推荐目标的指导下直接学习树的结构和表示来解决这个问题。然而，这种模式有两个缺点。首先，层次树中的最大堆假设(父节点的首选项应该是其子节点的首选项之间的最大值)难以满足其二进制分类目标。其次，学习索引只包括一棵树，这与广泛使用的多棵树索引不同，为提高推荐的准确性提供了机会。为此，我们提出了一个基于深度森林的推荐器(简称 DeFoRec)来实现有效的推荐。在 DeFoRec 中，所有在训练过程中生成的树被保留以形成森林。在学习每棵树的节点表示时，必须尽可能满足最大堆假设，并在训练阶段模拟树上的束搜索行为。DeFoRec 将训练任务视为同一层次上的树节点上的多分类，从而实现了这一目标。然而，树节点的数量随着层次的增加呈指数增长，这使得我们在采样-软极大技术的指导下对偏好模型进行训练。在实际数据集上进行了实验，验证了所提出的偏好模型学习方法和树学习方法的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Forest-based+Deep+Recommender)|0|

It can be argued, however, that such truncated rankings are more useful to the end user. It is thus important to understand how to measure retrieval effectiveness in this scenario. In this paper we provide both theoretical and experimental contributions. We first define formal properties to analyze how effectiveness metrics behave when evaluating truncated rankings. Our theoretical analysis shows that de-facto standard metrics do not satisfy desirable properties to evaluate truncated rankings: only Observational Information Effectiveness (OIE) -- a metric based on Shannon's information theory -- satisfies them all. We then perform experiments to compare several metrics on nine TREC datasets. According to our experimental results, the most appropriate metrics for truncated rankings are OIE and a novel extension of Rank-Biased Precision that adds a user effort factor penalizing the retrieval of irrelevant documents.|大多数信息检索有效性评估指标都假定，在排名底部附加不相关文档的系统与那些有停止标准的系统一样有效(或者不比那些有停止标准的系统差) ，后者会在正确的位置“截断”排名，以避免在最后检索到那些不相关的文档。然而，可以说，这种截断的排名对最终用户更有用。因此，了解如何在此场景中度量检索效率非常重要。在本文中，我们提供了理论和实验的贡献。我们首先定义形式属性来分析效率指标在评估截断排名时的表现。我们的理论分析表明，事实上的标准指标不能满足评估截断排名的理想属性: 只有观测信息有效性(OIE)——一个基于香农信息理论的指标——能够满足所有这些指标。然后，我们进行实验来比较九个 TREC 数据集上的几个指标。根据我们的实验结果，最适合截断排名的指标是 OIE 和一个新的扩展排名偏差精度，增加了用户的努力因素惩罚检索不相关的文档。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Ranking+Interruptus:+When+Truncated+Rankings+Are+Better+and+How+to+Measure+That)|0|

We can use this metric to compare the performance of multiple systems for the same request. Although evaluation metrics provide a convenient summary of system performance, they also collapse subtle differences across users into a single number and can carry assumptions about user behavior and utility not supported across retrieval scenarios. We propose recall-paired preference (RPP), a metric-free evaluation method based on directly computing a preference between ranked lists. RPP simulates multiple user subpopulations per query and compares systems across these pseudo-populations. Our results across multiple search and recommendation tasks demonstrate that RPP substantially improves discriminative power while correlating well with existing metrics and being equally robust to incomplete data.|对信息检索和推荐的离线评估传统上侧重于将排名的质量提炼为一个标量指标，如平均精度或标准化折现累计增益。我们可以使用这个度量来比较同一个请求的多个系统的性能。虽然评估指标提供了一个方便的系统性能总结，但是它们也将用户之间的细微差异折叠成一个数字，并且可以对不支持检索场景的用户行为和实用程序进行假设。我们提出了一种基于直接计算排名表之间偏好的无度量评价方法——召回配对偏好(RPP)。RPP 模拟每个查询的多个用户子种群，并比较这些伪种群中的系统。我们在多个搜索和推荐任务中的结果表明，RPP 大大提高了识别能力，同时与现有指标关联良好，对不完整数据具有同样的鲁棒性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Offline+Retrieval+Evaluation+Without+Evaluation+Metrics)|0|
|[Pareto-Optimal Fairness-Utility Amortizations in Rankings with a DBN Exposure Model](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3532036)|Till Kletti, JeanMichel Renders, Patrick Loiseau|Univ. Grenoble Alpes, Inria, CNRS, Grenoble INP, LIG, Grenoble, France; Naver Labs Europe, Meylan, France|In recent years, it has become clear that rankings delivered in many areas need not only be useful to the users but also respect fairness of exposure for the item producers. We consider the problem of finding ranking policies that achieve a Pareto-optimal tradeoff between these two aspects. Several methods were proposed to solve it; for instance a popular one is to use linear programming with a Birkhoff-von Neumann decomposition. These methods, however, are based on a classical Position Based exposure Model (PBM), which assumes independence between the items (hence the exposure only depends on the rank). In many applications, this assumption is unrealistic and the community increasingly moves towards considering other models that include dependences, such as the Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) exposure model. For such models, computing (exact) optimal fair ranking policies remains an open question. In this paper, we answer this question by leveraging a new geometrical method based on the so-called expohedron proposed recently for the PBM (Kletti et al., WSDM'22). We lay out the structure of a new geometrical object (the DBN-expohedron), and propose for it a Carathéodory decomposition algorithm of complexity $O(n^3)$, where n is the number of documents to rank. Such an algorithm enables expressing any feasible expected exposure vector as a distribution over at most n rankings; furthermore we show that we can compute the whole set of Pareto-optimal expected exposure vectors with the same complexity $O(n^3)$. Our work constitutes the first exact algorithm able to efficiently find a Pareto-optimal distribution of rankings. It is applicable to a broad range of fairness notions, including classical notions of meritocratic and demographic fairness. We empirically evaluate our method on the TREC2020 and MSLR datasets and compare it to several baselines in terms of Pareto-optimality and speed.|近年来，很明显，在许多领域提供的排名不仅需要对用户有用，而且还要尊重项目制作者的公平曝光。我们考虑的问题，找到排序的政策，实现了帕累托最优权衡这两个方面。人们提出了几种方法来解决这个问题，例如，一种流行的方法是使用伯克霍夫-冯诺依曼分解的线性规划。然而，这些方法是基于经典的基于位置的曝光模型(PBM) ，该模型假设项目之间的独立性(因此曝光只取决于排名)。在许多应用程序中，这种假设是不现实的，社区越来越倾向于考虑包含依赖关系的其他模型，例如动态贝氏网路暴露模型。对于这样的模型，计算(精确的)最优公平排序策略仍然是一个悬而未决的问题。在本文中，我们回答这个问题，利用一个新的几何方法的基础上，所谓的外三面体最近提出的 PBM (Kletti 等，WSDM’22)。我们给出了一个新的几何对象(DBN-expohedron)的结构，并提出了一个复杂度为 $O (n ^ 3) $的 Carathéodory 分解算法，其中 n 是要排序的文档数。这种算法能够表示任何可行的期望暴露矢量作为一个分布在最多 n 个排名; 此外，我们表明，我们可以计算整个集合的帕累托最优期望暴露矢量具有相同的复杂度 $O (n ^ 3) $。我们的工作构成了第一个精确的算法，能够有效地找到排名的帕累托最优分布。它适用于广泛的公平概念，包括精英统治和人口统计公平的经典概念。我们在 TREC2020和 MSLR 数据集上经验性地评估了我们的方法，并将其与几个基线在帕累托最优性和速度方面进行了比较。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Pareto-Optimal+Fairness-Utility+Amortizations+in+Rankings+with+a+DBN+Exposure+Model)|0|

Recently, a great effort has been put on exploring Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for L2R, with significant results. However, risk-sensitiveness, an important and recent advance in the L2R arena, that reduces variability and increases trust, has not been incorporated into Deep Neural L2R yet. Risk-sensitive measures are important to assess the risk of an IR system to perform worse than a set of baseline IR systems for several queries. However, the risk-sensitive measures described in the literature have a non-smooth behavior, making them difficult, if not impossible, to be optimized by DNNs. In this work we solve this difficult problem by proposing a family of new loss functions -- \riskloss\ -- that support a smooth risk-sensitive optimization. \riskloss\ introduces two important contributions: (i) the substitution of the traditional NDCG or MAP metrics in risk-sensitive measures with smooth loss functions that evaluate the correlation between the predicted and the true relevance order of documents for a given query and (ii) the use of distinct versions of the same DNN architecture as baselines by means of a multi-dropout technique during the smooth risk-sensitive optimization, avoiding the inconvenience of assessing multiple IR systems as part of DNN training. We empirically demonstrate significant achievements of the proposed \riskloss\ functions when used with recent DNN methods in the context of well-known web-search datasets such as WEB10K, YAHOO, and MQ2007. Our solutions reach improvements of 8% in effectiveness (NDCG) while improving in around 5% the risk-sensitiveness (\grisk\ measure) when applied together with a state-of-the-art Self-Attention DNN-L2R architecture. Furthermore, \riskloss\ is capable of reducing by 28% the losses over the best evaluated baselines and significantly improving over the risk-sensitive state-of-the-art non-DNN method (by up to 13.3%) while keeping (or even increasing) overall effectiveness. All these results ultimately establish a new level for the state-of-the-art on risk-sensitiveness and DNN-L2R research.|学习排名(L2R)是许多信息检索系统的核心任务。近年来，针对 L2R 的深层神经网络(DNN)的研究取得了显著的成果。然而，风险敏感性，一个重要的和最近在 L2R 领域的进展，减少变异性和增加信任，尚未被纳入深层神经 L2R。风险敏感度量对于评估一个 IR 系统在几个查询中的性能低于一组基准 IR 系统的风险非常重要。然而，文献中描述的风险敏感性措施有一个不平滑的行为，使他们难以，如果不是不可能，被 DNN 优化。在这项工作中，我们通过提出一系列新的损失函数——风险损失——来解决这个难题，这些函数支持平稳的风险敏感优化。风险损失引入了两个重要贡献: (i)用平滑损失函数替换风险敏感度量中的传统 NDCG 或 MAP 指标，评估给定查询的文档的预测和真实相关顺序之间的相关性; (ii)通过平滑风险敏感性优化期间的多退出技术使用相同 DNN 架构的不同版本作为基线，避免了评估多个 IR 系统作为 DNN 训练的一部分的不便。当与最近的 DNN 方法在诸如 WEB10K，YAHOO 和 MQ2007等著名的网络搜索数据集的背景下使用时，我们经验性地证明了所提出的风险损失函数的显着成就。我们的解决方案在与最先进的自我注意 DNN-L2R 架构一起应用时，有效性(NDCG)提高了8% ，而风险敏感性(风险测量)提高了约5% 。此外，风险损失能够比最佳评估基线减少28% 的损失，并且比风险敏感的最先进的非 DNN 方法(高达13.3%)显着改善，同时保持(甚至增加)总体有效性。所有这些结果最终为风险敏感性和 DNN-L2R 研究的最新水平奠定了一个新的基础。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Risk-Sensitive+Deep+Neural+Learning+to+Rank)|0|
|[Adaptable Text Matching via Meta-Weight Regulator](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531932)|Bo Zhang, Chen Zhang, Fang Ma, Dawei Song|Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China|Neural text matching models have been used in a range of applications such as question answering and natural language inference, and have yielded a good performance. However, these neural models are of a limited adaptability, resulting in a decline in performance when encountering test examples from a different dataset or even a different task. The adaptability is particularly important in the few-shot setting: in many cases, there is only a limited amount of labeled data available for a target dataset or task, while we may have access to a richly labeled source dataset or task. However, adapting a model trained on the abundant source data to a few-shot target dataset or task is challenging. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Meta-Weight Regulator (MWR), which is a meta-learning approach that learns to assign weights to the source examples based on their relevance to the target loss. Specifically, MWR first trains the model on the uniformly weighted source examples, and measures the efficacy of the model on the target examples via a loss function. By iteratively performing a (meta) gradient descent, high-order gradients are propagated to the source examples. These gradients are then used to update the weights of source examples, in a way that is relevant to the target performance. As MWR is model-agnostic, it can be applied to any backbone neural model. Extensive experiments are conducted with various backbone text matching models, on four widely used datasets and two tasks. The results demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly outperforms a number of existing adaptation methods and effectively improves the cross-dataset and cross-task adaptability of the neural text matching models in the few-shot setting.|神经文本匹配模型已经在问答、自然语言推理等领域得到了广泛的应用，并取得了良好的效果。然而，这些神经模型的适应性有限，当遇到来自不同数据集甚至不同任务的测试例子时，会导致性能下降。适应性在少镜头设置中尤其重要: 在许多情况下，目标数据集或任务只有有限数量的标记数据可用，而我们可以访问标记丰富的源数据集或任务。然而，将一个基于大量源数据训练的模型应用于少量目标数据集或任务是具有挑战性的。为了应对这一挑战，我们提出了一种元权重调节器(MWR) ，它是一种元学习方法，学习根据源示例与目标损失的相关性为其分配权重。具体来说，MWR 首先在均匀加权的源例子上训练模型，然后通过损失函数来度量模型对目标例子的有效性。通过迭代执行一个(元)梯度下降法，高阶梯度被传播到源示例。然后使用这些渐变来更新源示例的权重，其方式与目标性能相关。由于 MWR 是模型无关的，因此它可以应用于任何骨干神经网络模型。在四个广泛使用的数据集和两个任务上，使用各种骨干文本匹配模型进行了广泛的实验。结果表明，本文提出的方法明显优于现有的一些自适应方法，有效地提高了神经元文本匹配模型在少镜头情况下的跨数据集和跨任务适应性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Adaptable+Text+Matching+via+Meta-Weight+Regulator)|0|
|[Re-thinking Knowledge Graph Completion Evaluation from an Information Retrieval Perspective](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3532052)|Ying Zhou, Xuanang Chen, Ben He, Zheng Ye, Le Sun|South-Central University for Nationalities, Wuhan, China; Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences & Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China|Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to infer missing knowledge triples based on known facts in a knowledge graph. Current KGC research mostly follows an entity ranking protocol, wherein the effectiveness is measured by the predicted rank of a masked entity in a test triple. The overall performance is then given by a micro(-average) metric over all individual answer entities. Due to the incomplete nature of the large-scale knowledge bases, such an entity ranking setting is likely affected by unlabelled top-ranked positive examples, raising questions on whether the current evaluation protocol is sufficient to guarantee a fair comparison of KGC systems. To this end, this paper presents a systematic study on whether and how the label sparsity affects the current KGC evaluation with the popular micro metrics. Specifically, inspired by the TREC paradigm for large-scale information retrieval (IR) experimentation, we create a relatively "complete" judgment set based on a sample from the popular FB15k-237 dataset following the TREC pooling method. According to our analysis, it comes as a surprise that switching from the original labels to our "complete" labels results in a drastic change of system ranking of a variety of 13 popular KGC models in terms of micro metrics. Further investigation indicates that the IR-like macro(-average) metrics are more stable and discriminative under different settings, meanwhile, less affected by label sparsity. Thus, for KGC evaluation, we recommend conducting TREC-style pooling to balance between human efforts and label completeness, and reporting also the IR-like macro metrics to reflect the ranking nature of the KGC task.|知识图完成(KGC)是基于知识图中已知事实推断出缺失的知识三元组。目前的 KGC 研究大多遵循一个实体排名协议，其中的有效性是衡量一个被掩盖的实体在一个测试三元组的预测排名。然后，通过对所有单个答案实体的微观(平均)度量给出总体表现。由于大规模知识库的不完整性，这种实体排名设置可能会受到没有标记的排名最高的积极实例的影响，从而引起目前的评价议定书是否足以保证公平比较 KGC 系统的问题。为此，本文利用当前流行的微观指标，对标签稀疏性是否以及如何影响当前 KGC 评价进行了系统的研究。具体来说，受到 TREC 大规模信息检索(IR)实验范例的启发，我们创建了一个相对“完整”的判断集，该判断集基于流行的 FB15k-237数据集的样本，采用 TREC 汇集方法。根据我们的分析，令人惊讶的是，从原始标签切换到我们的“完整”标签导致系统排名的急剧变化的各种13个流行的 KGC 模型在微观指标方面。进一步的研究表明，类 IR 宏(平均)指标在不同的设置下更加稳定和具有区分性，同时受标签稀疏性的影响较小。因此，对于 KGC 评估，我们建议进行 TREC 风格的池来平衡人工努力和标签完整性，并报告类似 IR 的宏指标来反映 KGC 任务的排名性质。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Re-thinking+Knowledge+Graph+Completion+Evaluation+from+an+Information+Retrieval+Perspective)|0|

Recently, model-based (MDB) methods have demonstrated superior accuracy than embedding-based (EDB) methods due to their excellent capacity of modeling local video/text correspondences, especially when equipped with large-scale pre-training schemes like ClipBERT. Generally speaking, MDB methods take a text-video pair as input and harness deep models to predict the mutual similarity, while EDB methods first utilize modality-specific encoders to extract embeddings for text and video, then evaluate the distance based on the extracted embeddings. Notably, MDB methods cannot produce explicit representations for text and video, instead, they have to exhaustively pair the query with every database item to predict their mutual similarities in the inference stage, which results in significant inefficiency in practical applications. In this work, we propose a novel EDB method CRET (Cross-modal REtrieval Transformer), which not only demonstrates promising efficiency in retrieval tasks, but also achieves better accuracy than existing MDB methods. The credits are mainly attributed to our proposed Cross-modal Correspondence Modeling (CCM) module and Gaussian Estimation of Embedding Space (GEES) loss. Specifically, the CCM module is composed by transformer decoders and a set of decoder centers. With the help of the learned decoder centers, the text/video embeddings can be efficiently aligned, without suffering from pairwise model-based inference. Moreover, to balance the information loss and computational overhead when sampling frames from a given video, we present a novel GEES loss, which implicitly conducts dense sampling in the video embedding space, without suffering from heavy computational cost. Extensive experiments show that without pre-training on extra datasets, our proposed CRET outperforms the state-of-the-art MDB methods that were pre-trained on additional datasets, meanwhile still shows promising efficiency in retrieval tasks.|给定一个文本查询，文本到视频检索任务的目的是在数据库中找到相关的视频。近年来，基于模型(MDB)的方法由于其优异的局部视频/文本对应建模能力而显示出优于基于嵌入的方法的准确性，特别是当配备了大规模的预训练方案，如 ClipBERT。一般来说，MDB 方法以文本-视频对为输入，利用深度模型来预测相似度，而 EDB 方法首先利用特定于模态的编码器来提取文本和视频的嵌入，然后根据提取的嵌入来评估距离。值得注意的是，MDB 方法不能生成文本和视频的显式表示，相反，它们必须将查询与每个数据库项穷举地配对，以预测它们在推理阶段的相似性，这导致了实际应用中的显著效率低下。本文提出了一种新的多模态检索转换器(CRET)方法，该方法不仅在检索任务中表现出良好的效率，而且比现有的 MDB 方法具有更高的准确率。这主要归功于我们提出的交叉模态对应建模(CCM)模块和嵌入空间的高斯估计(GEES)损失。具体来说，CCM 模块由变压器解码器和一组解码中心组成。借助于所学习的解码中心，文本/视频嵌入可以有效地对齐，而不会受到基于成对模型的推理的影响。此外，为了平衡从给定视频帧采样时的信息损失和计算开销，我们提出了一种新的 GEES 损失算法，该算法在视频嵌入空间中隐式地进行密集采样，不需要承担大量的计算开销。大量的实验表明，在不对额外数据集进行预训练的情况下，我们提出的 CRET 方法优于对额外数据集进行预训练的最先进的 MDB 方法，同时在检索任务中仍然显示出有希望的效率。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=CRET:+Cross-Modal+Retrieval+Transformer+for+Efficient+Text-Video+Retrieval)|0|

It plays an important role in many video related applications, including copyright protection, tracing, filtering and etc. Video representation and similarity search are crucial to any video retrieval system. To derive effective video representation, most video retrieval systems require a large amount of manually annotated data for training, making it costly inefficient. In addition, most retrieval systems are based on frame-level features for video similarity searching, making it expensive both storage wise and search wise. To address the above issues, we propose a video representation learning (VRL) approach to effectively address the above shortcomings. It first effectively learns video representation from unlabeled videos via contrastive learning to avoid the expensive cost of manual annotation. Then, it exploits transformer structure to aggregate frame-level features into clip-level to reduce both storage space and search complexity. It can learn the complementary and discriminative information from the interactions among clip frames, as well as acquire the frame permutation and missing invariant ability to support more flexible retrieval manners. Comprehensive experiments on two challenging near-duplicate video retrieval datasets, namely FIVR-200K and SVD, verify the effectiveness of our proposed VRL approach, which achieves the best performance of video retrieval on accuracy and efficiency.|近重复视频检索(NDVR)的目标是从海量视频数据库中查找查询视频的副本或变换。它在许多视频相关应用中起着重要作用，包括版权保护、跟踪、过滤等。视频表示和最近邻搜索对于任何视频检索系统都至关重要。为了获得有效的视频表示，大多数视频检索系统需要大量的人工注释数据进行训练，这使得系统效率低下。此外，大多数检索系统基于帧级特征进行视频相似性搜索，这使得存储和搜索成本都很高。针对上述问题，本文提出了一种视频表示学习(VRL)方法，有效地解决了上述问题。它首先通过对比学习有效地从未标记的视频中学习视频表示，从而避免了人工标注的昂贵成本。然后，利用变压器结构将帧级特征聚合为剪辑级特征，降低存储空间和搜索复杂度。它可以从剪辑帧之间的交互中学习互补信息和鉴别信息，获得帧排列和缺失不变量能力，支持更灵活的检索方式。通过对 FIVR-200K 和 SVD 两个具有挑战性的近重复视频检索数据集的综合实验，验证了本文提出的 VRL 方法的有效性，在准确性和效率方面达到了最佳的视频检索性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Learn+from+Unlabeled+Videos+for+Near-duplicate+Video+Retrieval)|0|

In this paper, we decompose the CTI-IR task into a three-stage learning problem to progressively learn the complex knowledge for image retrieval with hybrid-modality queries. We first leverage the semantic embedding space for open-domain image-text retrieval, and then transfer the learned knowledge to the fashion-domain with fashion-related pre-training tasks. Finally, we enhance the pre-trained model from single-query to hybrid-modality query for the CTI-IR task. Furthermore, as the contribution of individual modality in the hybrid-modality query varies for different retrieval scenarios, we propose a self-supervised adaptive weighting strategy to dynamically determine the importance of image and text in the hybrid-modality query for better retrieval. Extensive experiments show that our proposed model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the mean of [email protected] by 24.9% and 9.5% on the Fashion-IQ and Shoes benchmark datasets respectively.|基于混合模态查询的图像检索，即组合文本和图像进行图像检索(CTI-IR) ，是一种以更复杂的查询格式表达搜索意图的检索任务，涉及视觉和文本模态。例如，使用参考产品图像以及关于将参考图像的某些属性更改为查询的文本搜索目标产品图像。语义空间学习和跨模态融合是图像检索中一个更具挑战性的任务。以前试图同时处理这两个方面的方法的性能都不令人满意。本文将 CTI-IR 任务分解为三阶段学习问题，逐步学习用于图像检索的复杂知识。我们首先利用语义嵌入空间进行开放领域的图文检索，然后利用与时尚相关的预训练任务将所学知识转移到时尚领域。最后，对 CTI-IR 任务的预训练模型进行了改进，从单查询模型改进为混合模态查询模型。此外，由于个体模态在混合模态查询中的贡献因检索场景的不同而不同，我们提出了一种自监督自适应加权策略，动态确定图像和文本在混合模态查询中的重要性，以便更好地检索。大量的实验表明，在 Fashion-IQ 和 Shoes 基准数据集上，我们提出的模型在平均值(电子邮件受保护)方面明显优于最先进的方法，分别为24.9% 和9.5% 。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Progressive+Learning+for+Image+Retrieval+with+Hybrid-Modality+Queries)|0|

Re-rankers have been boomed by Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) due to their overwhelming advantages in natural language understanding. However, existing PLM based re-rankers may easily suffer from vocabulary mismatch and lack of domain specific knowledge. To alleviate these problems, explicit knowledge contained in knowledge graph is carefully introduced in our work. Specifically, we employ the existing knowledge graph which is incomplete and noisy, and first apply it in passage re-ranking task. To leverage a reliable knowledge, we propose a novel knowledge graph distillation method and obtain a knowledge meta graph as the bridge between query and passage. To align both kinds of embedding in the latent space, we employ PLM as text encoder and graph neural network over knowledge meta graph as knowledge encoder. Besides, a novel knowledge injector is designed for the dynamic interaction between text and knowledge encoder. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method especially in queries requiring in-depth domain knowledge.|文章重新排序是从检索阶段对候选文章集合进行排列。由于预训练语言模型在自然语言理解方面具有压倒性的优势，重新排名的语言模型得到了蓬勃发展。然而，现有的基于 PLM 的重新排名可能很容易受到词汇不匹配和缺乏领域特定知识的影响。为了解决这些问题，我们在工作中仔细介绍了知识图表中的外显知识。具体地说，我们利用现有的不完备且有噪声的知识图，首先将其应用于段落重排任务。为了利用可靠的知识，我们提出了一种新的知识图提取方法，并得到一个知识元图作为查询和文章之间的桥梁。为了在潜空间中对齐这两种嵌入，我们采用 PLM 作为文本编码器，知识元图上的图形神经网络作为知识编码器。此外，还设计了一种新颖的知识注入器，用于文本和知识编码器之间的动态交互。实验结果表明了该方法的有效性，特别是在需要深度领域知识的查询中。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Incorporating+Explicit+Knowledge+in+Pre-trained+Language+Models+for+Passage+Re-ranking)|0|

However, as the mechanisms behind the performance improvement remain under-investigated, the interpretability and robustness of these pre-trained models still need to be improved. Axiomatic IR aims to identify a set of desirable properties expressed mathematically as formal constraints to guide the design of ranking models. Existing studies have already shown that considering certain axioms may help improve the effectiveness and interpretability of IR models. However, there still lack efforts of incorporating these IR axioms into pre-training methodologies. To shed light on this research question, we propose a novel pre-training method with \underlineA xiomatic \underlineRe gularization for ad hoc \underlineS earch (ARES). In the ARES framework, a number of existing IR axioms are re-organized to generate training samples to be fitted in the pre-training process. These training samples then guide neural rankers to learn the desirable ranking properties. Compared to existing pre-training approaches, ARES is more intuitive and explainable. Experimental results on multiple publicly available benchmark datasets have shown the effectiveness of ARES in both full-resource and low-resource (e.g., zero-shot and few-shot) settings. An intuitive case study also indicates that ARES has learned useful knowledge that existing pre-trained models (e.g., BERT and PROP) fail to possess. This work provides insights into improving the interpretability of pre-trained models and the guidance of incorporating IR axioms or human heuristics into pre-training methods.|近年来，针对 IR 任务的预训练方法取得了很大的成功。然而，由于性能改进背后的机制仍然没有得到充分的研究，这些预先训练的模型的可解释性和鲁棒性仍然需要改进。公理 IR 旨在识别一组用数学方法表示为形式约束的理想属性，以指导排序模型的设计。现有的研究已经表明，考虑某些公理可能有助于提高红外模型的有效性和可解释性。然而，仍然缺乏将这些 IR 公理纳入预训练方法的努力。针对这一问题，本文提出了一种基于下划线公理化下划线正则化的自组织下划线搜索(ARES)预训练方法。在 ARES 框架中，对一些现有的信息检索公理进行了重新组织，以生成培训样本，用于培训前进程。这些训练样本然后指导神经排序学习理想的排序属性。与现有的预训练方法相比，ARES 更加直观和易于解释。在多个公开可用的基准数据集上的实验结果显示了 ARES 在全资源和低资源(例如，零拍摄和少拍摄)环境下的有效性。一个直观的案例研究还表明，ARES 已经学到了有用的知识，现有的预训练模型(例如，BERT 和 PROP)不能拥有。这项工作为提高预训练模型的可解释性提供了见解，并指导将 IR 公理或人类启发式融入预训练方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Axiomatically+Regularized+Pre-training+for+Ad+hoc+Search)|0|

In the first stage an IR system retrieves "relevant'' documents containing the knowledge, and in the second stage an NLP system performs reasoning to solve the task. Optimizing the IR system for retrieving relevant documents ensures that the NLP system has sufficient information to operate over. These recent NLP task formulations raise interesting and exciting challenges for IR, where the end-user of an IR system is not a human with an information need, but another system exploiting the documents retrieved by the IR system to perform reasoning and address the user information need. Among these challenges, as we will show, is that noise from the IR system, such as retrieving spurious or irrelevant documents, can negatively impact the accuracy of the downstream reasoning module. Hence, there is the need to balance maximizing relevance while minimizing noise in the IR system. This paper presents experimental results on two NLP tasks implemented as a two-stage cascading architecture. We show how spurious or irrelevant retrieved results from the first stage can induce errors in the second stage. We use these results to ground our discussion of the research challenges that the IR community should address in the context of these knowledge-intensive NLP tasks.|近年来，自然语言处理(NLP)的许多任务公式，如问题回答和事实验证，都是作为一个两阶段级联结构实现的。在第一阶段，IR 系统检索包含知识的“相关”文档，在第二阶段，NLP 系统执行推理来解决任务。优化检索相关文件的红外系统，确保自然语言处理系统有足够的信息进行操作。这些最新的 NLP 任务公式为 IR 提出了有趣和令人兴奋的挑战，其中 IR 系统的最终用户不是一个有信息需求的人，而是另一个利用 IR 系统检索到的文档进行推理并满足用户信息需求的系统。在这些挑战中，正如我们将要展示的，来自 IR 系统的噪音，例如检索虚假或不相关的文档，可能会对下游推理模块的准确性产生负面影响。因此，需要在最大相关性和最小噪声之间取得平衡。本文给出了两个实现为两级级联结构的自然语言处理任务的实验结果。我们展示了如何伪造或不相关的检索结果从第一阶段可以导致错误的第二阶段。我们使用这些结果来基础我们的研究挑战的讨论，IR 社区应该在这些知识密集型的自然语言处理任务的背景下解决。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=On+the+Role+of+Relevance+in+Natural+Language+Processing+Tasks)|0|

Nevertheless, GNNs are known to be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. Adversarial training is a simple yet effective way to improve the robustness of neural models. For example, many prior studies inject adversarial perturbations into either node features or hidden layers of GNNs. However, perturbing graph structures has been far less studied in recommendations. To bridge this gap, we propose AdvGraph to model adversarial graph perturbations during the training of GNNs. Our AdvGraph is mainly based on min-max robust optimization, where an universal graph perturbation is obtained through an inner maximization while the outer optimization aims to compute the model parameters of GNNs. However, direct optimizing the inner problem is challenging due to discrete nature of the graph perturbations. To address this issue, an unbiased gradient estimator is further proposed to compute the gradients of discrete variables.

Instead of assessing every individual label, most XMC methods rely on label trees or filters to derive short ranked label lists as prediction, thereby reducing computational overhead. Specifically, existing studies obtain ranked label lists with a fixed length for prediction and evaluation. However, these predictions are unreasonable since data points have varied numbers of relevant labels. The greatly small and large list lengths in evaluation, such as [email protected] and [email protected] , can also lead to the ignorance of other relevant labels or the tolerance of many irrelevant labels. In this paper, we aim to provide reasonable prediction for extreme multi-label classification with dynamic numbers of predicted labels. In particular, we propose a novel framework, Model-Agnostic List Truncation with Ordinal Regression (MALTOR), to leverage the ranking properties and truncate long ranked label lists for better accuracy. Extensive experiments conducted on six large-scale real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that MALTOR significantly outperforms statistical baseline methods and conventional ranked list truncation methods in ad-hoc retrieval with both linear and deep XMC models. The results of an ablation study also shows the effectiveness of each individual component in our proposed MALTOR.|在大数据时代，极限多标签分类(XMC)已经成为处理机器学习应用中大量标签空间的重要研究课题之一。大多数 XMC 方法不是评估每个单独的标签，而是依靠标签树或过滤器来推导出短排名标签列表作为预测，从而减少计算开销。具体来说，现有的研究获得了具有固定长度的排名标签列表，用于预测和评价。然而，这些预测是不合理的，因为数据点有不同数量的相关标签。评估中的列表长度大大小小，如[ email protected ]和[ email protected ] ，也可能导致对其他相关标签的忽视或许多不相关标签的容忍。在本文中，我们的目的是提供合理的预测与预测标签的动态数量极端多标签分类。特别是，我们提出了一个新的框架，模型不可知列表与有序回归截断(MALTOR) ，以利用排名属性和截断长的排名标签列表，以更好的准确性。在六个大规模真实世界基准数据集上进行的大量实验表明，MALTOR 在线性和深度 XMC 模型的特别检索中显著优于统计基线方法和传统的排序列表截断方法。消融研究的结果也显示了我们提出的 MALTOR 中每个单独组件的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Relevance+under+the+Iceberg:+Reasonable+Prediction+for+Extreme+Multi-label+Classification)|0|

The purpose of online creative selection is to learn users' preferences for ad creatives, and to select the most appealing design for users to maximize Click-Through Rate (CTR). However, the existing common practices in the industry usually place the creative selection after the ad ranking stage, and thus the optimal creative fails to reflect the influence on the ad ranking stage.

To improve the efficiency, we design a classic two-tower structure and allow creative embeddings of the creative selection stage to share with the ranking stage. To boost the effectiveness, on the one hand, we propose a soft label list-wise ranking distillation method to distill the ranking knowledge from the ranking stage to guide CACS learning; and on the other hand, we also design an adaptive dropout network to encourage the model to probabilistically ignore ID features in favor of content features to learn multi-modal representations of the creative. Most of all, the ranking model obtains the optimal creative information of each ad from our CACS, and uses all available features to improve the performance of the ranking model.

|[Long Document Re-ranking with Modular Re-ranker](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531860)|Luyu Gao, Jamie Callan|Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA|Long document re-ranking has been a challenging problem for neural re-rankers based on deep language models like BERT. Early work breaks the documents into short passage-like chunks. These chunks are independently mapped to scalar scores or latent vectors, which are then pooled into a final relevance score. These encode-and-pool methods however inevitably introduce an information bottleneck: the low dimension representations. In this paper, we propose instead to model full query-to-document interaction, leveraging the attention operation and modular Transformer re-ranker framework. First, document chunks are encoded independently with an encoder module. An interaction module then encodes the query and performs joint attention from the query to all document chunk representations. We demonstrate that the model can use this new degree of freedom to aggregate important information from the entire document. Our experiments show that this design produces effective re-ranking on two classical IR collections Robust04 and ClueWeb09, and a large-scale supervised collection MS-MARCO document ranking.|长文档重新排序一直是基于 BERT 等深层语言模型的神经网络重新排序的一个具有挑战性的问题。早期的工作将文档分解成短小的段落。这些块被独立映射到标量分数或潜在向量，然后将它们汇集到最终的相关分数中。然而，这些编码和池方法不可避免地引入了一个信息瓶颈: 低维表示。在本文中，我们提出了利用注意力操作和模块化的 formerre-rank 框架来建立完全的查询到文档的交互模型。首先，文档块使用编码器模块进行独立编码。然后，交互模块对查询进行编码，并执行从查询到所有文档块表示的联合注意。我们证明该模型可以使用这种新的自由度来聚合整个文档中的重要信息。我们的实验表明，这种设计产生了有效的重新排序的两个经典的红外收集鲁棒04和 ClueWeb09，以及一个大规模的监督收集 MS-MARCO 文件排序。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Long+Document+Re-ranking+with+Modular+Re-ranker)|0|

However, prompt tuning methods for relation extraction may still fail to generalize to those rare or hard patterns. Note that the previous parametric learning paradigm can be viewed as memorization regarding training data as a book and inference as the close-book test. Those long-tailed or hard patterns can hardly be memorized in parameters given few-shot instances. To this end, we regard RE as an open-book examination and propose a new semiparametric paradigm of retrieval-enhanced prompt tuning for relation extraction. We construct an open-book datastore for retrieval regarding prompt-based instance representations and corresponding relation labels as memorized key-value pairs. During inference, the model can infer relations by linearly interpolating the base output of PLM with the non-parametric nearest neighbor distribution over the datastore. In this way, our model not only infers relation through knowledge stored in the weights during training but also assists decision-making by unwinding and querying examples in the open-book datastore. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art in both standard supervised and few-shot settings|预训练的语言模型通过显示出显著的短镜头学习能力，对关系抽取做出了重要贡献。然而，关系抽取的快速调优方法可能仍然无法推广到那些罕见的或难以实现的模式。请注意，以前的参数学习范式可以被视为记忆的训练数据作为一本书和推论作为关闭书测试。这些长尾或硬模式几乎不能被记忆在参数中，因为实例很少。为此，我们将 RE 视为一个开放式的考试，并提出了一个新的检索半参数范式——关系抽取的增强型提示调优。我们构造了一个开放式数据存储，用于检索基于提示的实例表示和相应的关系标签作为记忆的键值对。在推理过程中，该模型可以通过对 PLM 的基本输出与数据存储上的非参数最近邻分布进行线性插值来推断关系。这样，我们的模型不仅可以通过训练过程中权重中存储的知识来推断关系，而且可以通过展开和查询开卷数据库中的实例来辅助决策。对基准数据集的大量实验表明，该方法可以在标准监督和少镜头设置下达到最先进的水平|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Relation+Extraction+as+Open-book+Examination:+Retrieval-enhanced+Prompt+Tuning)|0|
|[End-to-end Distantly Supervised Information Extraction with Retrieval Augmentation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531876)|Yue Zhang, Hongliang Fei, Ping Li|Baidu, Bellevue, WA, USA|Distant supervision (DS) has been a prevalent approach to generating labeled data for information extraction (IE) tasks. However, DS often suffers from noisy label problems, where the labels are extracted from the knowledge base (KB), regardless of the input context. Many efforts have been devoted to designing denoising mechanisms. However, most strategies are only designed for one specific task and cannot be directly adapted to other tasks. We propose a general paradigm (Dasiera) to resolve issues in KB-based DS. Labels from KB can be viewed as universal labels of a target entity or an entity pair. While the given context for an IE task may only contain partial/zero information about the target entities, or the entailed information may be vague. Hence the mismatch between the given context and KB labels, i.e., the given context has insufficient information to infer DS labels, can happen in IE training datasets. To solve the problem, during training, Dasiera leverages a retrieval-augmentation mechanism to complete missing information of the given context, where we seamlessly integrate a neural retriever and a general predictor in an end-to-end framework. During inference, we can keep/remove the retrieval component based on whether we want to predict solely on the given context. We have evaluated Dasiera on two IE tasks under the DS setting: named entity typing and relation extraction. Experimental results show Dasiera's superiority to other baselines in both tasks.|远程监控(DS)已经成为一种普遍的方法来为信息抽取(IE)任务生成标记数据。然而，DS 经常遇到噪声标签问题，这些标签是从知识库(KB)中提取出来的，与输入上下文无关。人们在设计去噪机制方面付出了很多努力。然而，大多数策略只针对一个特定任务设计，不能直接适应其他任务。我们提出了一个通用范例(Dasiera)来解决基于知识库的 DS 中的问题。来自 KB 的标签可以被视为目标实体或实体对的通用标签。IE 任务的给定上下文可能只包含关于目标实体的部分/零信息，或者所涉及的信息可能是模糊的。因此，给定上下文和知识库标签之间的不匹配，即给定上下文没有足够的信息来推断 DS 标签，可能发生在 IE 训练数据集中。为了解决这个问题，在训练期间，Dasiera 利用检索增强机制来完成给定上下文的缺失信息，在这里我们无缝地将神经检索器和通用预测器集成在一个端到端框架中。在推理过程中，我们可以保留/删除检索组件，这取决于我们是否希望仅根据给定的上下文进行预测。我们在 DS 设置下对 Dasiera 的两个 IE 任务进行了评估: 命名实体类型和关系提取。实验结果表明，Dasiera 在这两个任务中都优于其他基线。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=End-to-end+Distantly+Supervised+Information+Extraction+with+Retrieval+Augmentation)|0|

Reproducing these findings is the foundation of future research. However, due to the complexity of experiments, manually assessing scientific research is laborious and time-intensive, especially in social and behavioral sciences. Although increasing reproducibility studies have garnered increased attention in the research community, there is still a lack of systematic ways for evaluating scientific research at scale. In this paper, we propose a novel approach towards automatically assessing scientific publications by constructing a knowledge graph (KG) that captures a holistic view of the research contributions. Specifically, during the KG construction, we combine information from two different perspectives: micro-level features that capture knowledge from published articles such as sample sizes, effect sizes, and experimental models, and macro-level features that comprise relationships between entities such as authorship and reference information. We then learn low-dimensional representations using language models and knowledge graph embeddings for entities (nodes in KGs), which are further used for the assessments. A comprehensive set of experiments on two benchmark datasets shows the usefulness of leveraging KGs for scoring scientific research.|近几十年来，科学研究的规模不断扩大，产生了许多新的发现。复制这些发现是未来研究的基础。然而，由于实验的复杂性，人工评估科学研究是费时费力的，尤其是在社会科学和行为科学领域。虽然越来越多的重复性研究已经引起了研究界越来越多的关注，但仍然缺乏系统的方法来评价科学研究的规模。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的方法来自动评估科学出版物，通过构造一个知识图(KG) ，捕获了研究贡献的整体观点。具体而言，在 KG 构建过程中，我们从两个不同的角度组合信息: 从已发表的文章(如样本量，效应量和实验模型)中捕获知识的微观层面特征，以及包含实体(如作者和参考信息)之间关系的宏观层面特征。然后，我们学习低维表示使用语言模型和知识图嵌入的实体(节点在幼稚园) ，这是进一步用于评估。在两个基准数据集上的一组综合实验表明了利用幼儿园评分科学研究的有用性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Assessing+Scientific+Research+Papers+with+Knowledge+Graphs)|0|

The Influence Maximization (IM) problem seeks a set of~k users, and its content-aware variants seek a set of~k post features, that achieve, in both cases, an objective of expected influence in a social network. However, apart from raw influence, it is also relevant to study gain in subscribers, as long-term success rests on the subscribers of a brand page; classic IM may select~k users from the subscriber set, and content-aware IM starts the post's propagation from that subscriber set. In this paper, we propose a novel content recommendation policy to a brand agent for Gaining Subscribers by Messaging (GSM) over many rounds. In each round, the brand agent messages a fixed number of social network users and invites them to visit the brand page aiming to gain their subscription, while its most recently published content consists of features that intensely attract the preferences of the invited users. To solve GSM, we find, in each round, which content features to publish and which users to notify aiming to maximize the cumulative subscription gain over all rounds. We deploy three GSM solvers, named \sR, \sSC, and \sSU, and we experimentally evaluate their performance based on VKontakte (VK) posts by considering different user sets and feature sets. Our experimental results show that \sSU provides the best solution, as it is significantly more efficient than \sSC with a minor loss of efficacy and clearly more efficacious than \sR with competitive efficiency.|我们怎样才能向品牌代理商推荐一系列的内容，从而吸引新的用户访问其社交网络页面？影响力最大化(IM)问题寻找一组 ~ k 用户，其内容感知变体寻找一组 ~ k 帖子特征，在这两种情况下，都实现了社交网络中预期影响力的目标。然而，除了原始的影响力之外，研究订阅者的收益也是相关的，因为长期的成功取决于品牌页面的订阅者; 传统的 IM 可能从订阅者集合中选择 ~ k 用户，而内容感知的 IM 从订阅者集合中开始发布信息。在本文中，我们提出了一个新的内容推荐策略的品牌代理商获得用户的消息(GSM)多轮。在每一轮中，品牌代理人给固定数量的社交网络用户发信息，并邀请他们访问品牌页面以获得订阅，而其最近发布的内容包括强烈吸引受邀用户偏好的功能。为了解决 GSM 问题，我们发现，在每一轮中，哪些内容特性要发布，哪些用户要通知，目的是在所有轮次中最大化累积订阅收益。我们部署了三个 GSM 解决方案，分别命名为 sR、 sSC 和 sSU，通过考虑不同的用户集和特性集，实验性地评估了它们基于 VKontakte (VK)帖子的性能。我们的实验结果表明，sSU 提供了最佳的解决方案，因为它明显地比 sSC 更有效，具有较小的效率损失，并且明显地比具有竞争效率的 sR 更有效。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=A+Content+Recommendation+Policy+for+Gaining+Subscribers)|0|

Most existing methods learn news representations only from news texts while ignoring the visual information of news. In fact, users may click news not only due to the interest in news titles but also the attraction of news images. Thus, images are useful for representing news and predicting news clicks. Pretrained visiolinguistic models are powerful in multi-modal understanding, which can represent news from both textual and visual contents. In this paper, we propose a multimodal news recommendation method that can incorporate both textual and visual information of news to learn multimodal news representations. We first extract region-of-interests (ROIs) from news images via object detection. We then use a pre-trained visiolinguistic model to encode both news texts and image ROIs and model their inherent relatedness using co-attentional Transformers. In addition, we propose a crossmodal candidate-aware attention network to select relevant historical clicked news for the accurate modeling of user interest in candidate news. Experiments validate that incorporating multimodal news information can effectively improve the performance of news recommendation.|新闻表达对新闻推荐至关重要。现有的大多数方法只从新闻文本中学习新闻表征，而忽视了新闻的视觉信息。事实上，用户之所以会点击新闻，不仅是因为他们对新闻标题感兴趣，还因为新闻图片的吸引力。因此，图像对于表示新闻和预测新闻点击是非常有用的。预先训练的视觉语言模型在多模态理解中具有很强的表现能力，可以从文本和视觉两个方面表现新闻。在本文中，我们提出了一种多通道新闻推荐方法，它可以结合新闻的文本信息和视觉信息来学习多通道新闻表示。我们首先通过目标检测从新闻图像中提取感兴趣区域(ROI)。然后，我们使用一个预先训练的视觉语言学模型来编码新闻文本和图像 ROI，并使用共注意转换器来模拟它们之间的内在联系。此外，我们提出了一个跨模式的候选人感知注意网络来选择相关的历史点击新闻，以准确建模用户对候选人新闻的兴趣。实验证明，融合多模态新闻信息可以有效地提高新闻推荐的性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=MM-Rec:+Visiolinguistic+Model+Empowered+Multimodal+News+Recommendation)|0|

|[Another Look at Information Retrieval as Statistical Translation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531717)|Yuqi Liu, Chengcheng Hu, Jimmy Lin|University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada|Over two decades ago, Berger and Lafferty proposed "information retrieval as statistical translation" (IRST), a simple and elegant method for ad hoc retrieval based on the noisy channel model. At the time, they lacked the large-scale human-annotated datasets necessary to properly train their models. In this paper, we ask the simple question: What if Berger and Lafferty had access to datasets such as the MS MARCO passage ranking dataset that we take for granted today? The answer to this question tells us how much of recent improvements in ranking can be solely attributed to having more data available, as opposed to improvements in models (e.g., pretrained transformers) and optimization techniques (e.g., contrastive loss). In fact, Boytsov and Kolter recently began to answer this question with a replication of Berger and Lafferty's model, and this work can be viewed as another independent replication effort, with generalizations to additional conditions not previously explored, including replacing the sum of translation probabilities with ColBERT's MaxSim operator. We confirm that while neural models (particularly pretrained transformers) have indeed led to great advances in retrieval effectiveness, the IRST model proposed decades ago is quite effective if provided sufficient training data.|二十多年前，伯杰和拉弗蒂提出了“信息检索作为统计翻译”(IRST) ，这是一种基于噪声信道模型的简单而优雅的自组织检索方法。当时，他们缺乏必要的大规模人工注释数据集来适当地训练他们的模型。在本文中，我们提出一个简单的问题: 如果 Berger 和 Lafferty 能够访问数据集，比如我们今天认为理所当然的 MS MARCO 通道排名数据集，那会怎样？这个问题的答案告诉我们，最近排名的改善在多大程度上可以完全归因于有更多的数据可用，而不是模型(例如，预先训练的变压器)和优化技术(例如，对比损失)的改进。事实上，Boytsov 和 Kolter 最近开始通过复制 Berger 和 Lafferty 的模型来回答这个问题，这项工作可以被看作是另一个独立的复制努力，对以前没有探索过的其他条件进行推广，包括用 ColBERT 的 MaxSim 运算符替换翻译概率的总和。我们证实，虽然神经模型(特别是预先训练的变压器)确实导致了检索效率的巨大进步，几十年前提出的 IRST 模型是相当有效的，如果提供足够的训练数据。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Another+Look+at+Information+Retrieval+as+Statistical+Translation)|0|

However, their effectiveness compared to feature-based Learning-to-Rank (LtR) methods has not yet been well-established. A major reason for this is because present LtR benchmarks that contain query-document feature vectors do not contain the raw query and document text needed for neural models. On the other hand, the benchmarks often used for evaluating neural models, e.g., MS MARCO, TREC Robust, etc., provide text but do not provide query-document feature vectors. In this paper, we present Istella22, a new dataset that enables such comparisons by providing both query/document text and strong query-document feature vectors used by an industrial search engine.

Istella22 enables a fair evaluation of traditional learning-to-rank and transfer ranking techniques on the same data. LtR models exploit the feature-based representations of training samples while pre-trained transformer-based neural rankers can be evaluated on the corresponding textual content of queries and documents.

Beyond their importance in retrieval theory, axioms have been operationalized to improve an initial ranking, to "guide" retrieval, or to explain some model's rankings. However, recent open-source retrieval frameworks like PyTerrier and Pyserini, which made it easy to experiment with sparse and dense retrieval models, have not included any retrieval axiom support so far. To fill this gap, we propose ir_axioms, an open-source Python framework that integrates retrieval axioms with common retrieval frameworks. We include reference implementations for 25 retrieval axioms, as well as components for preference aggregation, re-ranking, and evaluation. New axioms can easily be defined by implementing an abstract data type or by intuitively combining existing axioms with Python operators or regression. Integration with PyTerrier and ir_datasets makes standard retrieval models, corpora, topics, and relevance judgments---including those used at TREC---immediately accessible for axiomatic experimentation.

|[Knowledge Graph Question Answering Datasets and Their Generalizability: Are They Enough for Future Research?](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531751)|Longquan Jiang, Ricardo Usbeck|University Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany|Existing approaches on Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs (KGQA) have weak generalizability. That is often due to the standard i.i.d. assumption on the underlying dataset. Recently, three levels of generalization for KGQA were defined, namely i.i.d., compositional, zero-shot. We analyze 25 well-known KGQA datasets for 5 different Knowledge Graphs (KGs). We show that according to this definition many existing and online available KGQA datasets are either not suited to train a generalizable KGQA system or that the datasets are based on discontinued and out-dated KGs. Generating new datasets is a costly process and, thus, is not an alternative to smaller research groups and companies.

|[Golden Retriever: A Real-Time Multi-Modal Text-Image Retrieval System with the Ability to Focus](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531666)|Florian Schneider, Chris Biemann|Universität Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany|In this work, we present the Golden Retriever, a system leveraging state-of-the-art visio-linguistic models (VLMs) for real-time text-image retrieval. The unique feature of our system is that it can focus on words contained in the textual query, i.e., locate and high-light them within retrieved images. An efficient two-stage process implements real-time capability and the ability to focus. Therefore, we first drastically reduce the number of images processed by a VLM. Then, in the second stage, we rank the images and highlight the focussed word using the outputs of a VLM. Further, we introduce a new and efficient algorithm based on the idea of TF-IDF to retrieve images for short textual queries. One of multiple use cases where we employ the Golden Retriever is a language learner scenario, where visual cues for "difficult" words within sentences are provided to improve a user's reading comprehension. However, since the backend is completely decoupled from the frontend, the system can be integrated into any other application where images must be retrieved fast. We demonstrate the Golden Retriever with screenshots of a minimalistic user interface.|在这项工作中，我们介绍了金毛寻回犬，一个利用最先进的视觉语言模型(vlm)进行实时文本图像检索的系统。我们的系统的独特之处在于它可以专注于文本查询中包含的单词，也就是说，在检索到的图像中定位并高亮显示它们。一个有效的两阶段过程实现实时能力和集中能力。因此，我们首先大幅度减少图像处理的 VLM 数量。然后，在第二阶段，我们使用 VLM 的输出对图像进行排序并突出显示聚焦词。在此基础上，提出了一种基于 TF-IDF 思想的短文本查询图像检索算法。我们使用金毛寻回犬的多个用例之一是语言学习者场景，其中提供句子中“难”词的视觉提示，以提高用户的阅读理解。但是，由于后端与前端完全解耦，因此系统可以集成到任何其他必须快速检索图像的应用程序中。我们用一个极简的用户界面截图来演示这个金毛寻回犬。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Golden+Retriever:+A+Real-Time+Multi-Modal+Text-Image+Retrieval+System+with+the+Ability+to+Focus)|0|

The existing EM techniques can be either costly or tailored for a specific data type. We present ZeroMatcher, a cost-off entity matching system, which supports (i) handling EM tasks with different data types, including relational tables and knowledge graphs; (ii) keeping its EM performance always competitive by enabling the sub-modules to be updated in a lightweight manner, thus reducing development costs; and (iii) performing EM without human annotations to further slash the labor costs. First, ZeroMatcher automatically suggests users a set of appropriate modules for EM according to the data types of the input datasets. Users could specify the modules for the subsequent EM process according to their preferences. Alternatively, users are able to customize the modules of ZeroMatcher. Then, the system proceeds to the EM task, where users can track the entire EM process and monitor the memory usage changes in real-time. When the EM process is completed, ZeroMatcher visualizes the EM results from different aspects to ease the understanding for users. Finally, ZeroMatcher provides EM results evaluation, enabling users to compare the effectiveness among different parameter settings.|实体匹配(Entity Matching，EM)的目标是从引用相同实体的不同数据源中找到数据实例。现有的 EM 技术要么成本高昂，要么针对特定的数据类型进行量身定制。我们提出了 ZeroMatcher，一个成本实体匹配系统，它支持(i)处理不同数据类型的 EM 任务，包括关系表和知识图; (ii)保持其 EM 性能始终具有竞争力，使子模块以轻量级的方式更新，从而降低开发成本; 以及(iii)执行 EM 而不需要人工注释，以进一步降低劳动力成本。首先，ZeroMatcher 根据输入数据集的数据类型自动为用户建议一组适合 EM 的模块。用户可以根据自己的偏好为后续 EM 过程指定模块。或者，用户可以自定义 ZeroMatcher 的模块。然后，系统继续执行 EM 任务，在这个任务中，用户可以跟踪整个 EM 进程并实时监视内存使用的变化。当 EM 过程完成后，ZeroMatcher 从不同方面可视化 EM 结果，以便于用户理解。最后，ZeroMatcher 提供 EM 结果评估，使用户能够比较不同参数设置之间的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=ZeroMatcher:+A+Cost-Off+Entity+Matching+System)|0|

In queries and documents, search engines handle them as normal keywords and therefore are ignorant of relative conditions between numbers, such as greater than or less than, or, more generally, the numerical proximity of quantities.

|[Arm: Efficient Learning of Neural Retrieval Models with Desired Accuracy by Automatic Knowledge Amalgamation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531664)|Linzhu Yu, Dawei Jiang, Ke Chen, Lidan Shou|Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China|In recent years, there has been increasing interest in adopting published neural retrieval models learned from corpora for text retrieval. Although these models achieve excellent retrieval performance, in terms of popular accuracy metrics, on datasets they have been trained, their performance on new text data might degrade. To obtain the desired retrieval performance on both the data used in training and the latest data collected after training, the simple approach of learning a new model from both datasets is not always feasible since the annotated dataset used in training is often not published along with the learned model. Knowledge amalgamation (KA) is an emerging technique to deal with this problem of inaccessibility of data used in previous training. KA learns a new model (called a student model) from new data by reusing (called amalgamating) a number of trained models (called teacher models) instead of accessing the teachers' original training data. However, in order to efficiently learn an accurate student model, the classical KA approach requires manual selection of an appropriate subset of teacher models for amalgamation. This manual procedure for selecting teacher models prevents the classical KA from being scaled to retrieval tasks for which a large number of candidate teacher models are ready to be reused. This paper presents Arm, an intelligent system for efficiently learning a neural retrieval model with the desired accuracy on incoming data by automatically amalgamating a subset of teacher models (called a teacher model combination or simply combination ) among a large number of teacher models. o filter combinations that fail to produce accurate student models, Arm employs Bayesian optimization to derive an accuracy prediction model based on sampled amalgamation tasks. Then, Arm uses the derived prediction model to exclude unqualified combinations without training the rest combinations. To speed up training, Arm introduces a cost model that picks the teacher model combination with the minimal training cost among all qualified teacher model combinations to produce the final student model. This paper will demonstrate the major workflow of Arm and present the produced student models to users.|近年来，从语料库中学习的已发表的神经检索模型越来越多地被用于文本检索。尽管这些模型在它们已经训练过的数据集上获得了优异的检索性能，但是它们在新文本数据上的性能可能会下降。为了获得对训练中使用的数据和训练后收集的最新数据的期望检索性能，从两个数据集中学习新模型的简单方法并不总是可行的，因为训练中使用的注释数据集通常不与学习模型一起发布。知识融合(KA)是一种新兴的技术，以解决这一问题的数据无法访问以往的训练使用。KA 从新的数据中学习新的模型(称为学生模型) ，方法是重用(称为合并)一些经过训练的模型(称为教师模型) ，而不是访问教师的原始培训数据。然而，为了有效地学习一个准确的学生模型，经典的 KA 方法需要手动选择合适的教师模型子集进行合并。这个选择教师模型的手工程序阻止了经典的 KA 被缩放到检索任务，其中大量的候选教师模型可以被重用。本文提出了一个智能系统 Arm，它通过在大量的教师模型中自动合并一个教师模型子集(称为教师模型组合或简单组合)来有效地学习一个神经检索模型，该模型对输入数据具有期望的准确性。O 过滤器组合不能产生准确的学生模型，Arm 使用贝叶斯优化得到一个基于采样融合任务的精度预测模型。然后，利用导出的预测模型排除不合格组合，而不对剩余组合进行训练。为了加速培训，Arm 引入了一个成本模型，在所有合格的教师模型组合中选择教师模型组合和最小的培训成本，从而产生最终的学生模型。本文将演示 Arm 的主要工作流程，并将生成的学生模型提供给用户。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Arm:+Efficient+Learning+of+Neural+Retrieval+Models+with+Desired+Accuracy+by+Automatic+Knowledge+Amalgamation)|0|

|[Applications and Future of Dense Retrieval in Industry](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3536324)|Yubin Kim|Etsy, Inc., Brooklyn, NY, USA|Large-scale search engines are often designed as tiered systems with at least two layers. The L1 candidate retrieval layer efficiently generates a subset of potentially relevant documents (typically ~1000 documents) from a corpus many orders of magnitude larger in size. L1 systems emphasize efficiency and are designed to maximize recall. The L2 re-ranking layer uses a more computationally expensive, but more accurate model (e.g. learning-to-rank or neural model) to re-rank the candidates generated by L1 in order to maximize precision of the final result list. Traditionally, candidate retrieval was performed with an inverted index data structure, with exact lexical matching. Candidates are ordered by a dot-product-like scoring function f(q,d) where q and d are sparse vectors containing token weights, typically derived from the token's frequency in the document/query and corpus. The inverted index enables sub-linear ranking of the documents. Due to the sparse vector representation of the documents and queries, lexical match retrieval systems have also been called sparse retrieval. To contrast, dense retrieval represents queries and documents by embedding the text into lower dimensional dense vectors. Candidate documents are scored based on the distance between the query and document embedding vectors. Practically, the similarity computations are made efficiently with approximate k-nearest neighbours (ANN) systems. In this panel, we bring together experts in dense retrieval across multiple industry applications, including web search, enterprise and personal search, e-commerce, and out-of-domain retrieval.|大型搜索引擎通常被设计成至少有两层的分层系统。第一语言候选检索层有效地从一个数量级更大的语料库中生成一个可能相关的文档子集(通常是1000个文档)。L1系统强调效率，旨在最大限度地提高召回率。L2重新排序层使用一个计算更加昂贵，但更加精确的模型(例如学习到排序或神经模型)来重新排序 L1产生的候选人，以最大限度地提高最终结果列表的精确度。传统的候选检索采用倒排索引数据结构，并且采用精确的词法匹配。候选者按照类似点乘积的评分函数 f (q，d)排序，其中 q 和 d 是包含令牌权重的稀疏向量，通常来自文档/查询和语料库中令牌的频率。倒排索引允许对文档进行次线性排序。由于文档和查询的稀疏向量表示，词汇匹配检索系统也被称为稀疏检索。相比之下，密集检索通过将文本嵌入低维密集向量来表示查询和文档。候选文档根据查询和文档嵌入向量之间的距离进行评分。在实际应用中，利用近似 k 最近邻(ANN)系统可以有效地进行相似度计算。在这个专题讨论小组中，我们汇集了跨多个行业应用的密集检索方面的专家，包括网络搜索、企业和个人搜索、电子商务和域外检索。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Applications+and+Future+of+Dense+Retrieval+in+Industry)|0|

Multiple-choice questionnaires are commonly used as a screening tool before the client sees the professional for more efficient information elicitation [5]. However, recent proof-of-concept studies show that users are more likely to report their symptoms to an embodied conversational agent (ECA) than on a pen-and-paper survey [3], and rate ECAs highly on user experience [4]. Chatbots allow the user to give free-form responses and ask clarification questions instead of having to interpret and choose from a list of given options.

When searching in scientific literature, mathematical notation, which is often written using the LATEX notation, therefore plays a crucial role that should not be neglected. The task of mathematics-aware information retrieval is to retrieve relevant passages given a query or question, which both can include natural language and mathematical formulas. As in many domains that rely on Natural Language Understanding, transformer-based models are now dominating the field of information retrieval [3]. Apart from their size and the transformerencoder architecture, pre-training is considered to be a key factor for the high performance of these models. It has also been shown that domain-adaptive pre-training improves their performance on down-stream tasks even further [2] especially when the vocabulary overlap between pre-training and in-domain data is low.

Because observed feedback represents users' click logs, there is a semantic gap between true relevance and observed feedback. More importantly, observed feedback is usually biased towards popular items, thereby overestimating the actual relevance of popular items. Although existing studies have developed unbiased learning methods using inverse propensity weighting (IPW) or causal reasoning, they solely focus on eliminating the popularity bias of items. In this paper, we propose a novel unbiased recommender learning model, namely BIlateral SElf-unbiased Recommender (BISER), to eliminate the exposure bias of items caused by recommender models. Specifically, BISER consists of two key components: (i) self-inverse propensity weighting (SIPW) to gradually mitigate the bias of items without incurring high computational costs; and (ii) bilateral unbiased learning (BU) to bridge the gap between two complementary models in model predictions, i.e., user- and item-based autoencoders, alleviating the high variance of SIPW. Extensive experiments show that BISER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unbiased recommender models over several datasets, including Coat, Yahoo!

|[Why do Semantically Unrelated Categories Appear in the Same Session?: A Demand-aware Method](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531806)|Liqi Yang, Linhao Luo, Xiaofeng Zhang, Fengxin Li, Xinni Zhang, Zelin Jiang, Shuai Tang|Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, Shenzhen, China; China Merchants Securities Co., Ltd, Shenzhen, China|Session-based recommendation has recently attracted more and more research efforts. Most existing approaches are intuitively proposed to discover users' potential preferences or interests from the anonymous session data. This apparently ignores the fact that these sequential behavior data usually reflect session user's potential demand, i.e., a semantic level factor, and therefore how to estimate underlying demands from a session has become a challenging task. To tackle the aforementioned issue, this paper proposes a novel demand-aware graph neural network model. Particularly, a demand modeling component is designed to extract the underlying multiple demands of each session. Then, the demand-aware graph neural network is designed to first construct session demand graphs and then learn the demand-aware item embeddings to make the recommendation. The mutual information loss is further designed to enhance the quality of the learnt embeddings. Extensive experiments have been performed on two real-world datasets and the proposed model achieves the SOTA model performance.|近年来，基于会话的推荐引起了越来越多的研究者的关注。现有的大多数方法都是直观地从匿名会话数据中发现用户的潜在偏好或兴趣。这显然忽略了这样一个事实，即这些顺序行为数据通常反映会话用户的潜在需求，即语义级因素，因此如何估计会话的潜在需求已经成为一个具有挑战性的任务。为了解决上述问题，本文提出了一种新的需求感知图神经网络模型。特别地，需求建模组件被设计用于提取每个会话的底层多个需求。然后，设计需求感知图神经网络，首先构造会话需求图，然后学习需求感知项嵌入，进行推荐。进一步设计了互信息损失，提高了学习嵌入的质量。在两个实际数据集上进行了广泛的实验，所提出的模型达到了 SOTA 模型的性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Why+do+Semantically+Unrelated+Categories+Appear+in+the+Same+Session?:+A+Demand-aware+Method)|0|

In the common case of large inventories, complex User Interfaces (UIs) are required to allow a seamless navigation. However, as UIs often contain many widgets of different relevance, the task of constructing an optimal layout arises in order to improve the customer's experience. This is a challenging task, especially in the typical industrial setup where multiple independent teams conflict by adding and modifying UI widgets. It becomes even more challenging due to the customer preferences evolving over time, bringing the need for adaptive solutions. In a previous work [6], we addressed this task by introducing a UI governance framework powered by Machine Learning (ML) algorithms that automatically and continuously search for the optimal layout. Nevertheless, we highlighted that naive algorithmic choices exhibit several issues when implemented in the industry, such as widget dependency, combinatorial solution space and cold start problem. In this work, we demonstrate how we deal with these issues using Combinatorial Bandits, an extension of Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB) where the agent selects not only one but multiple arms at the same time. We develop two novel approaches to model combinatorial bandits, inspired by the Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) fields and present their ability to enable scalable UI optimization.|主要电子商务平台的使命是使其客户能够找到满足其需要的最佳产品。在大量存货的常见情况下，需要复杂的用户界面(UI)来实现无缝导航。然而，由于 UI 通常包含许多不同相关性的小部件，因此需要构建最佳布局以改善客户体验。这是一项具有挑战性的任务，特别是在典型的工业设置中，多个独立团队通过添加和修改 UI 小部件而发生冲突。由于客户的偏好随着时间的推移而不断变化，因此对适应性解决方案的需求变得更加具有挑战性。在之前的工作[6]中，我们通过引入一个由机器学习(ML)算法支持的 UI 治理框架来解决这个问题，该框架可以自动并持续地搜索最佳布局。然而，我们强调，幼稚的算法选择表现出几个问题，如小部件依赖，组合解决方案空间和冷启动问题。在这项工作中，我们展示了如何处理这些问题使用组合强盗，一个扩展的多臂强盗(MAB) ，其中代理人选择不仅一个，但多个武器在同一时间。受自然语言处理(NLP)和进化算法(EA)领域的启发，我们开发了两种新的组合强盗建模方法，并展示了它们实现可扩展 UI 优化的能力。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Scalable+User+Interface+Optimization+Using+Combinatorial+Bandits)|0|

It would probably be a lab-based observational study [3] involving multiple search systems masked behind a uniform interface, and with hundreds (or thousands) of users each progressing some "real" search activity they were interested in. And we'd plan to (non-intrusively, somehow) capture per-snippet, per-document, per-SERP, and per-session annotations and satisfaction responses. The collected data could then be compared against a range of measured "task completion quality" indicators, and also against search effectiveness metric scores computed from the elements contained in the SERPs that were served by the systems. That's a tremendously big ask! So we often use offline evaluation techniques instead, employing test collections, static qrels sets, and effectiveness metrics [6]. We abstract the user into a deterministic evaluation script, supposing for pragmatic reasons that we know what query they would issue, and at the same time assuming that we can apply an effectiveness metric to calculate how much usefulness (or satisfaction) they will derive from any given SERP. The great advantage of this approach is that aside from the process of collecting the qrels, it is free of the need for users, meaning that it is repeatable. Indeed, we often do repeat, iterating to set parameters (and to rectify programming errors). Then, once metric scores have been computed, we carry out one or more paired statistical tests and draw conclusions as to relative system effectiveness.|如果我们可以设计一个理想的红外“有效性”实验(不同于红外“有效性”实验) ，它会是什么样子？这可能是一个基于实验室的观察性研究，在一个统一的界面背后隐藏着多个搜索系统，数百(或数千)用户每个人都在进行一些他们感兴趣的“真实”搜索活动。我们计划(非侵入性地，以某种方式)捕获每个片段、每个文档、每个 SERP 和每个会话的注释和满意度响应。然后，收集的数据可以与一系列测量的“任务完成质量”指标进行比较，也可以与搜索效率指标得分进行比较，这些得分是从系统提供的 SERP 中包含的元素计算出来的。这个要求太过分了！因此，我们经常使用离线评估技术，使用测试集合、静态 qrel 集和有效性度量[6]。我们将用户抽象成一个确定性的评估脚本，假设出于实用原因，我们知道他们会发出什么样的查询，同时假设我们可以应用一个有效性度量来计算他们将从任何给定的 SERP 中获得多少有用性(或满意度)。这种方法的最大优点是，除了收集 qrel 的过程之外，它不需要用户，这意味着它是可重复的。实际上，我们经常重复，迭代以设置参数(并纠正编程错误)。然后，一旦计算出度量分数，我们进行一个或多个成对的统计检验，并得出相对系统有效性的结论。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Users:+Can't+Work+With+Them,+Can't+Work+Without+Them?)|0|

Current corpus-based learning manner limits its practical application in real-world scenarios. To this end, we contribute to advancing the study of the proactive dialogue policy to a more natural and challenging setting, i.e., interacting dynamically with users. Further, we call attention to the non-cooperative user behavior - the user talks about off-path topics when he/she is not satisfied with the previous topics introduced by the agent. We argue that the targets of reaching the goal topic quickly and maintaining a high user satisfaction are not always converged, because the topics close to the goal and the topics user preferred may not be the same. Towards this issue, we propose a new solution named I-Pro that can learn Proactive policy in the Interactive setting. Specifically, we learn the trade-off via a learned goal weight, which consists of four factors (dialogue turn, goal completion difficulty, user satisfaction estimation, and cooperative degree).

|[ADPL: Adversarial Prompt-based Domain Adaptation for Dialogue Summarization with Knowledge Disentanglement](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531933)|Lulu Zhao, Fujia Zheng, Weihao Zeng, Keqing He, Ruotong Geng, Huixing Jiang, Wei Wu, Weiran Xu|Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China; Meituan Group, Beijing, China|Traditional dialogue summarization models rely on a large-scale manually-labeled corpus, lacking generalization ability to new domains, and domain adaptation from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain is important in practical summarization scenarios. However, existing domain adaptation works in dialogue summarization generally require large-scale pre-training using extensive external data. To explore the lightweight fine-tuning methods, in this paper, we propose an efficient Adversarial Disentangled Prompt Learning (ADPL) model for domain adaptation in dialogue summarization. We introduce three kinds of prompts including domain-invariant prompt (DIP), domain-specific prompt (DSP), and task-oriented prompt (TOP). DIP aims to disentangle and transfer the shared knowledge from the source domain and target domain in an adversarial way, which improves the accuracy of prediction about domain-invariant information and enhances the ability for generalization to new domains. DSP is designed to guide our model to focus on domain-specific knowledge using domain-related features. TOP is to capture task-oriented knowledge to generate high-quality summaries. Instead of fine-tuning the whole pre-trained language model (PLM), we only update the prompt networks but keep PLM fixed. Experimental results on the zero-shot setting show that the novel design of prompts can yield more coherent, faithful, and relevant summaries than baselines using the prefix-tuning, and perform at par with fine-tuning while being more efficient. Overall, our work introduces a prompt-based perspective to the zero-shot learning for dialogue summarization task and provides valuable findings and insights for future research.|传统的对话摘要模型依赖于大规模的人工标记语料库，缺乏对新领域的泛化能力，在实际的摘要场景中，从标记的源领域到未标记的目标领域的领域适应性是非常重要的。然而，现有的对话摘要领域适应工作一般需要使用大量的外部数据进行大规模的预训练。为了探索轻量级微调方法，本文提出了一种有效的对话摘要领域自适应对抗性分离提示学习(ADPL)模型。介绍了领域不变提示(DIP)、领域特定提示(DSP)和面向任务提示(TOP)三种提示方式。DIP 旨在对源域和目标域的共享知识进行对抗性的分离和转移，提高了领域不变信息预测的准确性，增强了对新领域的推广能力。DSP 被设计用来指导我们的模型使用领域相关的特征来关注领域特定的知识。TOP 是一种以任务为导向的知识获取方法，用于生成高质量的摘要。我们没有对整个预先训练好的语言模型(PLM)进行微调，而是只更新提示网络，但保持 PLM 不变。零镜头设置的实验结果表明，新颖的提示符设计比基线前缀调整更能产生连贯、忠实和相关的总结，并且在更有效率的同时表现出与微调相当的效果。总的来说，我们的工作为对话总结任务的零拍学习引入了一个基于及时性的视角，并为未来的研究提供了有价值的发现和见解。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=ADPL:+Adversarial+Prompt-based+Domain+Adaptation+for+Dialogue+Summarization+with+Knowledge+Disentanglement)|0|
|[IR Evaluation and Learning in the Presence of Forbidden Documents](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3532006)|David Carmel, Nachshon Cohen, Amir Ingber, Elad Kravi|Amazon, Haifa, Israel; Pinecone Systems, Haifa, Israel|Many IR collections contain forbidden documents (F-docs), i.e. documents that should not be retrieved to the searcher. In an ideal scenario F-docs are clearly flagged, hence the ranker can filter them out, guaranteeing that no F-doc will be exposed. However, in real-world scenarios, filtering algorithms are prone to errors. Therefore, an IR evaluation system should also measure filtering quality in addition to ranking quality. Typically, filtering is considered as a classification task and is evaluated independently of the ranking quality. However, due to the mutual affinity between the two, it is desirable to evaluate ranking quality while filtering decisions are being made. In this work we propose nDCGf, a novel extension of the nDCGmin metric[14], which measures both ranking and filtering quality of the search results. We show both theoretically and empirically that while nDCGmin is not suitable for the simultaneous ranking and filtering task, nDCGf is a reliable metric in this case. We experiment with three datasets for which ranking and filtering are both required. In the PR dataset our task is to rank product reviews while filtering those marked as spam. Similarly, in the CQA dataset our task is to rank a list of human answers per question while filtering bad answers. We also experiment with the TREC web-track datasets, where F-docs are explicitly labeled, sorting participant runs according to their ranking and filtering quality, demonstrating the stability, sensitivity, and reliability of nDCGf for this task. We propose a learning to rank and filter (LTRF) framework that is specifically designed to optimize nDCGf, by learning a ranking model and optimizing a filtering threshold used for discarding documents with lower scores. We experiment with several loss functions demonstrating their success in learning an effective LTRF model for the simultaneous learning and filtering task.|许多 IR 集合包含禁用的文档(F-docs) ，即不应该被检索到搜索器的文档。在一个理想的场景中，F-doc 被清楚地标记，因此排名者可以过滤掉它们，保证没有 F-doc 被暴露。然而，在真实场景中，过滤算法很容易出错。因此，一个红外评价系统除了评级质量外，还应该衡量过滤质量。通常，过滤被认为是一个分类任务，独立于排序质量进行评估。然而，由于两者之间的相互亲和性，在做出过滤决策的同时评估排名质量是可取的。在这项工作中，我们提出了 nDCGf，nDCGmin 度量的一个新的扩展[14] ，它衡量搜索结果的排名和过滤质量。我们从理论和实验两方面证明了，虽然 nDCGmin 不适合同时进行排序和过滤任务，但在这种情况下，nDCGf 是一个可靠的度量。我们对三个数据集进行了实验，这三个数据集都需要排名和过滤。在公关数据集中，我们的任务是对产品评论进行排序，同时过滤那些被标记为垃圾邮件的评论。类似地，在 CQA 数据集中，我们的任务是对每个问题的人工答案列表进行排序，同时过滤错误答案。我们还对 TREC 网络跟踪数据集进行了实验，其中 F-docs 被明确标记，根据其排名和过滤质量对参与者进行排序，证明了 nDCGf 用于该任务的稳定性，灵敏度和可靠性。我们提出了一个学习排序和过滤(LTRF)框架，专门设计优化 nDCGf，通过学习排序模型和优化过滤阈值用于丢弃分数较低的文档。我们用几个损失函数进行了实验，证明了它们在同时学习和过滤任务中学习一个有效的 LTRF 模型是成功的。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=IR+Evaluation+and+Learning+in+the+Presence+of+Forbidden+Documents)|0|

Voorhees, Pablo Castells|Microsoft, Bellevue, WA, USA; University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada; National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, USA; Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain|The dramatic improvements in core information retrieval tasks engendered by neural rankers create a need for novel evaluation methods. If every ranker returns highly relevant items in the top ranks, it becomes difficult to recognize meaningful differences between them and to build reusable test collections. Several recent papers explore pairwise preference judgments as an alternative to traditional graded relevance assessments. Rather than viewing items one at a time, assessors view items side-by-side and indicate the one that provides the better response to a query, allowing fine-grained distinctions. If we employ preference judgments to identify the probably best items for each query, we can measure rankers by their ability to place these items as high as possible. We frame the problem of finding best items as a dueling bandits problem. While many papers explore dueling bandits for online ranker evaluation via interleaving, they have not been considered as a framework for offline evaluation via human preference judgments. We review the literature for possible solutions. For human preference judgments, any usable algorithm must tolerate ties, since two items may appear nearly equal to assessors, and it must minimize the number of judgments required for any specific pair, since each such comparison requires an independent assessor. Since the theoretical guarantees provided by most algorithms depend on assumptions that are not satisfied by human preference judgments, we simulate selected algorithms on representative test cases to provide insight into their practical utility. Based on these simulations, one algorithm stands out for its potential. Our simulations suggest modifications to further improve its performance. Using the modified algorithm, we collect over 10,000 preference judgments for pools derived from submissions to the TREC 2021 Deep Learning Track, confirming its suitability. We test the idea of best-item evaluation and suggest ideas for further theoretical and practical progress.|由神经排序引起的核心信息检索任务的显著改进创造了对新的评估方法的需求。如果每个排名都返回顶级排名中高度相关的项目，那么就很难识别它们之间有意义的差异，也很难构建可重用的测试集合。最近的几篇论文探讨了成对偏好判断作为传统分级相关性评估的替代方法。评估员不是一次查看一个项，而是并排查看项，并指出哪个项能够对查询提供更好的响应，从而允许细粒度的区分。如果我们使用偏好判断来确定每个查询可能最好的项目，我们可以通过他们将这些项目放在尽可能高的位置的能力来衡量排名。我们把寻找最佳物品的问题框定为一个决斗土匪问题。尽管许多论文通过交错的方式探索了在线排名评价中的决斗强盗，但是它们并没有被认为是一个通过人类偏好判断进行离线评价的框架。我们回顾了可能的解决方案的文献。对于人类偏好判断，任何可用的算法都必须容忍关系，因为两个项目可能看起来几乎等于评估者，它必须最小化任何特定对所需的判断数量，因为每个这样的比较需要一个独立的评估者。由于大多数算法提供的理论保证依赖于人类偏好判断不能满足的假设，我们在代表性测试案例上模拟选定的算法，以深入了解它们的实际效用。基于这些模拟，一种算法因其潜力而脱颖而出。我们的模拟结果表明，改进可以进一步提高它的性能。使用修改后的算法，我们收集了超过10,000个来自 TREC 2021深度学习跟踪提交的池的偏好判断，确认了它的适用性。我们检验了最佳项目评价的思想，并为进一步的理论和实践进展提出了建议。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Human+Preferences+as+Dueling+Bandits)|0|
|[IAOTP: An Interactive End-to-End Solution for Aspect-Opinion Term Pairs Extraction](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3532085)|Ambreen Nazir, Yuan Rao|Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China|Recently, the aspect-opinion term pairs (AOTP) extraction task has gained substantial importance in the domain of aspect-based sentiment analysis. It intends to extract the potential pair of each aspect term with its corresponding opinion term present in a user review. Some existing studies heavily relied on the annotated aspect terms and/or opinion terms, or adopted external knowledge/resources to figure out the task. Therefore, in this study, we propose a novel end-to-end solution, called an Interactive AOTP (IAOTP) model, for exploring AOTP. The IAOTP model first tracks the boundary of each token in given aspect-specific and opinion-specific representations through a span-based operation. Next, it generates the candidate AOTP by formulating the dyadic relations between tokens through the Biaffine transformation. Then, it computes the positioning information to capture the significant distance relationship that each candidate pair holds. And finally, it jointly models collaborative interactions and prediction of AOTP through a 2D self-attention. Besides the IAOTP model, this study also proposes an independent aspect/opinion encoding model (a RS model) that formulates relational semantics to obtain aspect-specific and opinion-specific representations that can effectively perform the extraction of aspect and opinion terms. Detailed experiments conducted on the publicly available benchmark datasets for AOTP, aspect terms, and opinion terms extraction tasks, clearly demonstrate the significantly improved performance of our models relative to other competitive state-of-the-art baselines.|近年来，在基于方面的情绪分析领域，方面-意见词对(AOTP)提取任务得到了广泛的重视。它打算提取每个方面术语与其相应的意见术语在用户评论中出现的潜在对。一些现有的研究严重依赖于注释的方面术语和/或意见术语，或者采用外部知识/资源来完成任务。因此，在这项研究中，我们提出了一个新的端到端解决方案，称为交互式 AOTP (IAOTP)模型，用于探索 AOTP。IAOTP 模型首先通过基于跨度的操作跟踪给定方面特定表示和意见特定表示中每个令牌的边界。其次，通过双仿射变换建立令牌之间的并元关系，生成候选 AOTP。然后，通过计算定位信息来捕获每个候选对所持有的重要距离关系。最后，通过二维自我注意共同建立 AOTP 协作交互和预测模型。除了 IAOTP 模型外，本研究还提出了一个独立的方面/意见编码模型(RS 模型) ，该模型通过建立关系语义来获得方面特定和意见特定的表示，从而有效地提取方面和意见术语。在 AOTP，方面术语和意见术语提取任务的公开可用基准数据集上进行的详细实验清楚地表明，相对于其他竞争性的最先进的基线，我们的模型的性能显着改善。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=IAOTP:+An+Interactive+End-to-End+Solution+for+Aspect-Opinion+Term+Pairs+Extraction)|0|

Generally, this line of work casts attribute inference as a text classification problem, and starts to leverage graph neural networks for higher-level text representations. However, these text graphs are constructed on words, suffering from high memory consumption and ineffectiveness on few labeled texts. To address this challenge, we design a text-graph-based few-shot learning model for social media attribute inferences. Our model builds a text graph with texts as nodes and edges learned from current text representations via manifold learning and message passing. To further use unlabeled texts to improve few-shot performance, a knowledge distillation is devised to optimize the problem. This offers a trade-off between expressiveness and complexity.

To obtain more satisfactory performance, the crucial points lie in two aspects: extracting better utterance features and strengthening the model generalization ability.

To learn better semantic representations for utterances, we introduce a new mixture attention mechanism, which encodes the pertinent word occurrence patterns by leveraging the distributional signature attention and multi-layer perceptron attention simultaneously. To strengthen the transfer ability of the model from seen classes to unseen classes, we reformulate zero-shot intent classification with a meta-learning strategy, which trains the model by simulating multiple zero-shot classification tasks on seen categories, and promotes the model generalization ability with a meta-adapting procedure on mimic unseen categories.

In this work we argue that extracted tips should be examined based on the amount of support and opposition they receive from all product reviews. A classifier, developed for this purpose, determines the degree to which a tip is supported or contradicted by a single review sentence. These support-levels are then aggregated over all review sentences, providing a global support score, and a global contradiction score, reflecting the support-level of all reviews to the given tip, thus improving the customer confidence in the tip validity. By analyzing a large set of tips extracted from product reviews, we propose a novel taxonomy for categorizing tips as highly-supported, highly-contradicted, controversial (supported and contradicted), and anecdotal (neither supported nor contradicted).|从产品评论中提取的有用的技巧可以帮助客户做出更明智的购买决定，以及更好、更容易和更安全地使用产品。在这项工作中，我们认为提取的技巧应该基于他们从所有产品评审中得到的支持和反对的数量进行检查。为此目的开发的分类器决定了一个复习句支持或反驳一个提示的程度。然后将这些支持级别聚合到所有评论句中，提供全局支持评分和全局矛盾评分，反映所有评论对给定提示的支持级别，从而提高客户对提示有效性的信心。通过分析从产品评论中提取的大量技巧，我们提出了一种新的分类方法，将技巧分为高支持、高矛盾、有争议(支持和矛盾)和轶事(既不支持也不矛盾)。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Analyzing+the+Support+Level+for+Tips+Extracted+from+Product+Reviews)|0|

Existing methods usually train user models from task-specific labeled data, which may be insufficient. In fact, there are usually abundant unlabeled user behavior data that encode rich universal user information, and pre-training user models on them can empower user modeling in many downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose a user model pre-training method named UserBERT to learn universal user models on unlabeled user behavior data with two contrastive self-supervision tasks. The first one is masked behavior prediction and discrimination, aiming to model the contexts of user behaviors. The second one is behavior sequence matching, aiming to capture user interest stable in different periods. Besides, we propose a medium-hard negative sampling framework to select informative negative samples for better contrastive pre-training. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of UserBERT in user model pre-training.|用户建模对个性化至关重要。现有的方法通常根据特定于任务的标记数据训练用户模型，这可能是不够的。事实上，通常存在大量未标记的用户行为数据，这些数据编码了丰富的通用用户信息，并且对这些数据进行预训练的用户模型可以在许多下游任务中增强用户建模能力。本文提出了一种用户模型预训练方法 UserBERT，通过两个对比的自我监督任务来学习未标记用户行为数据的通用用户模型。第一种是隐蔽行为预测和识别，旨在对用户行为的上下文进行建模。第二种是行为序列匹配，旨在捕获不同时期用户兴趣的稳定性。此外，我们提出了一个中等硬度的负面抽样框架来选择信息量大的负面样本，以便更好地进行对比预训练。大量实验验证了 UserBERT 在用户模型预训练中的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=UserBERT:+Pre-training+User+Model+with+Contrastive+Self-supervision)|0|

We assume that gold entity and relations have been provided, and the remaining task is to arrange them in the right order along with SPARQL vocabulary, and input tokens to produce the correct SPARQL query. Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have not been explored in depth on this task so far, so we experiment with BART, T5 and PGNs (Pointer Generator Networks) with BERT embeddings, looking for new baselines in the PLM era for this task, on DBpedia and Wikidata KGs. We show that T5 requires special input tokenisation, but produces state of the art performance on LC-QuAD 1.0 and LC-QuAD 2.0 datasets, and outperforms task-specific models from previous works. Moreover, the methods enable semantic parsing for questions where a part of the input needs to be copied to the output query, thus enabling a new paradigm in KG semantic parsing.|在这项工作中，我们将重点放在从自然语言问题生成 SPARQL 查询的任务上，然后可以在知识图(Knowledge Graphs，KG)上执行这些查询。我们假设已经提供了 gold 实体和关系，剩下的任务是将它们与 SPARQL 词汇表一起按正确的顺序排列，并输入令牌以生成正确的 SPARQL 查询。预先训练的语言模型(PLM)到目前为止还没有被深入探索，所以我们在 BART，T5和 PGNs (指针生成器网络)中嵌入 BERT 进行试验，在 DBpedia 和 Wikidata KG 上为这项任务寻找 PLM 时代的新基线。我们展示了 T5需要特殊的输入标记，但是在 LC-QuAD 1.0和 LC-QuAD 2.0数据集上产生了最先进的性能，并且优于以前作品中的任务特定模型。此外，这些方法还支持对需要将部分输入复制到输出查询的问题进行语义解析，从而为 KG 语义解析提供了一个新的范例。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Modern+Baselines+for+SPARQL+Semantic+Parsing)|0|

More recently, in a process called prompting, NLP tasks are rephrased as natural language text, allowing us to better exploit linguistic knowledge learned by PLMs and resulting in significant improvements. Still, PLMs have limited inference ability. In the Textual Entailment task, systems need to output whether the truth of a certain textual hypothesis follows from the given premise text. Manually annotated entailment datasets covering multiple inference phenomena have been used to infuse inference capabilities to PLMs. This talk will review these recent developments, and will present an approach that combines prompts and PLMs fine-tuned for textual entailment that yields state-of-the-art results on Information Extraction (IE) using only a small fraction of the annotations. The approach has additional benefits, like the ability to learn from different schemas and inference datasets. These developments enable a new paradigm for IE where the expert can define the domain-specific schema using natural language and directly run those specifications, annotating a handful of examples in the process. A user interface based on this new paradigm will also be presented. Beyond IE, inference capabilities could be extended, acquired and applied from other tasks, opening a new research avenue where entailment and downstream task performance improve in tandem.|深度学习在自然语言处理(NLP)领域取得了巨大的进步，其中针对目标任务进行微调的大型预训练语言模型(PLM)已成为主要的工具。最近，在一个叫做“提示”的过程中，NLP 任务被重新定义为自然语言文本，使我们能够更好地利用 PLM 学到的语言知识，从而带来显著的改进。不过，PLM 的推理能力有限。在文字蕴涵任务中，系统需要输出某个文本假设的真实性是否来自给定的前提文本。包含多种推理现象的人工注释的蕴涵数据集已经被用来为 PLM 注入推理能力。这个演讲将回顾这些最近的发展，并将提出一个方法，结合提示和 PLM 微调的文字蕴涵，产生最先进的结果在信息抽取(IE)使用只有一小部分的注释。这种方法还有其他好处，比如可以从不同的模式和推断数据集中学习。这些开发为 IE 提供了一个新的范例，在这个范例中，专家可以使用自然语言定义特定于领域的模式，并直接运行这些规范，在过程中注释一些示例。本文还将介绍一个基于这种新范例的用户界面。在 IE 之外，推理能力可以从其他任务中得到扩展、获取和应用，开辟了一条新的研究途径，其中蕴含和下游任务绩效同步提高。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Few-shot+Information+Extraction+is+Here:+Pre-train,+Prompt+and+Entail)|0|

However, it suffers from the extremely-sparse problem, since each user only interacts with a few items. One well-known and good-performing method is to treat each user's all uninteracted items as negative with low confidence. The method intrinsically imposes an implicit regularization to penalize large deviation of each user's preferences for uninteracted items from a constant. However, these methods have to assume a constant-rating prior to uninteracted items, which may be questionable. In this paper, we propose a novel ring-based regularization to penalize significant differences of each user's preferences between each item and some other items. The ring structure, described by an item graph, determines which other items are selected for each item in the regularization. The regularization not only averts the introduction of the prior ratings but also implicitly penalizes the remarkable preference differences for all items according to theoretical analysis. However, optimizing the recommenders with the regularization still suffers from computational challenges, so we develop a scalable alternating least square algorithm by carefully designing gradient computation. Therefore, as long as connecting each item with a sublinear/constant number of other items in the item graph, the overall learning algorithm could be comparably efficient to the existing algorithms. The proposed regularization is extensively evaluated with several public recommendation datasets, where the results show that the regularization could lead to considerable improvements in recommendation performance.|由于内隐反馈的广泛存在，基于内隐反馈的推荐已经成为学术界和业界长期研究的课题。但是，由于每个用户只与少数几个项目交互，因此它遇到了极其稀疏的问题。一个众所周知的好方法是将每个用户的所有未交互的项目视为负面的，并且信心不足。这种方法本质上强加了一种隐式正则化，以惩罚每个用户对常量中未交互项偏好的巨大偏差。但是，这些方法必须在未交互的项目之前假设一个常量评级，这可能是值得怀疑的。在本文中，我们提出了一个新的基于环的正则化，以惩罚每个用户的偏好之间的显着差异，每个项目和其他一些项目。由项目图描述的环结构确定为正则化中的每个项目选择哪些其他项目。根据理论分析，规则化不仅避免了先验评分的引入，而且隐含地惩罚了对所有项目的显著偏好差异。然而，正则化推荐算法的优化仍然面临着计算上的挑战，因此我们通过精心设计梯度计算，发展了一种可扩展的交替最小二乘算法。因此，只要将每个项目与项目图中其他项目的次线性/常数连接起来，整个学习算法就可以比现有算法更有效。利用若干公共推荐数据集对拟议的规范化进行了广泛评估，结果表明，规范化可大大改善推荐性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Improving+Implicit+Alternating+Least+Squares+with+Ring-based+Regularization)|0|

Advances in neuroimaging technologies have allowed for interdisciplinary research to investigate the brain activity associated with the realisation of IN. While these studies have been informative, they were not able to capture the cognitive processes underlying the realisation of IN and the interplay between them with a high temporal resolution. This paper aims to investigate this research question by inferring the variability of brain activity based on the contrast of a state of IN with the two other (no-IN) scenarios. To do so, we employed Electroencephalography (EEG) and constructed an Event-Related Potential (ERP) analysis of the brain signals captured while the participants were experiencing the realisation of IN. In particular, the brain signals of 24 healthy participants were captured while performing a Question-Answering (Q/A) Task. Our results show a link between the early stages of processing, corresponding to awareness and the late activity, meaning memory control mechanisms. Our findings also show that participants exhibited early N1-P2 complex indexing awareness processes and indicate, thus, that the realisation of IN is manifested in the brain before it reaches the user's consciousness.

Through introducing compression rate, we regard MT task as a special CLS task with the compression rate of 100%. Hence they can be trained as a unified task, sharing knowledge more effectively. Moreover, to bridge these two tasks smoothly, we propose a simple yet effective data augmentation method to produce document-summary pairs with different compression rates.

Future Event Generation (FEG) is a challenging task in event sequence prediction because it requires not only fluent text generation but also commonsense reasoning to maintain the logical coherence of the entire event story. In this paper, we propose a novel explainable FEG framework, Coep. It highlights and integrates two types of event knowledge, sequential knowledge of direct event-event relations and inferential knowledge that reflects the intermediate character psychology between events, such as intents, causes, reactions, which intrinsically pushes the story forward. To alleviate the knowledge forgetting issue, we design two modules, IM and GM, for each type of knowledge, which are combined via prompt tuning. First, IM focuses on understanding inferential knowledge to generate commonsense explanations and provide a soft prompt vector for GM. We also design a contrastive discriminator for better generalization ability. Second, GM generates future events by modeling direct sequential knowledge with the guidance of IM.

|[A Dual-Expert Framework for Event Argument Extraction](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531923)|Rui Li, Wenlin Zhao, Cheng Yang, Sen Su|Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China|Event argument extraction (EAE) is an important information extraction task, which aims to identify the arguments of an event described in a given text and classify the roles played by them. A key characteristic in realistic EAE data is that the instance numbers of different roles follow an obvious long-tail distribution. However, the training and evaluation paradigms of existing EAE models either prone to neglect the performance on "tail roles'', or change the role instance distribution for model training to an unrealistic uniform distribution. Though some generic methods can alleviate the class imbalance in long-tail datasets, they usually sacrifice the performance of "head classes'' as a trade-off. To address the above issues, we propose to train our model on realistic long-tail EAE datasets, and evaluate the average performance over all roles. Inspired by the Mixture of Experts (MOE), we propose a Routing-Balanced Dual Expert Framework (RBDEF), which divides all roles into "head" and "tail" two scopes and assigns the classifications of head and tail roles to two separate experts. In inference, each encoded instance will be allocated to one of the two experts by a routing mechanism. To reduce routing errors caused by the imbalance of role instances, we design a Balanced Routing Mechanism (BRM), which transfers several head roles to the tail expert to balance the load of routing, and employs a tri-filter routing strategy to reduce the misallocation of the tail expert's instances. To enable an effective learning of tail roles with scarce instances, we devise Target-Specialized Meta Learning (TSML) to train the tail expert. Different from other meta learning algorithms that only search a generic parameter initialization equally applying to infinite tasks, TSML can adaptively adjust its search path to obtain a specialized initialization for the tail expert, thereby expanding the benefits to the learning of tail roles. In experiments, RBDEF significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art EAE models and advanced methods for long-tail data.|事件参数提取(EAE)是一项重要的信息抽取任务，其目的是识别给定文本中描述的事件的参数，并对它们所扮演的角色进行分类。实际 EAE 数据的一个关键特征是不同角色的实例数量遵循明显的长尾分布。然而，现有 EAE 模型的训练和评估范式要么忽视了“尾部角色”的表现，要么将模型训练的角色实例分布改变为不现实的统一分布。虽然一些通用的方法可以缓解长尾数据集中的类不平衡，但它们通常牺牲“头类”的性能作为一种权衡。为了解决上述问题，我们建议在实际的长尾 EAE 数据集上训练我们的模型，并评估所有角色的平均性能。受专家混合模型(MOE)的启发，本文提出了一种路由平衡双专家框架(RBDEF) ，该框架将所有角色划分为“头部”和“尾部”两个范围，并将“头部”和“尾部”角色的分类分配给两个独立的专家。在推理中，每个编码实例将通过路由机制分配给两个专家中的一个。为了减少由于角色实例不平衡而引起的路由错误，设计了一种平衡路由机制(BRM) ，将多个主要角色转移给尾部专家以平衡路由负载，并采用三重过滤路由策略来减少尾部专家实例的错误分配。为了能够有效地学习尾部角色与稀少的实例，我们设计了目标专门化元学习(TSML) ，以培训尾部专家。不同于其他元学习算法，只搜索一个通用的参数初始化同样适用于无限的任务，TSML 可以自适应地调整其搜索路径，以获得专门的初始化尾部专家，从而扩大的好处，尾部角色的学习。在实验中，RBDEF 的性能明显优于最先进的 EAE 模型和先进的长尾数据处理方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=A+Dual-Expert+Framework+for+Event+Argument+Extraction)|0|

In real-world applications, events are usually annotated with numerous fine-grained types, which often arises long-tail type nature and co-occurrence event nature. Existing studies explore the event correlations without full utilization, which may limit the capability of event detection. This paper simultaneously incorporates both the type-level and instance-level event correlations, and proposes a novel framework, termed as CorED. Specifically, we devise an adaptive graph-based type encoder to capture instance-level correlations, learning type representations not only from their training data but also from their relevant types, thus leading to more informative type representations especially for the low-resource types. Besides, we devise an instance interactive decoder to capture instance-level correlations, which predicts event instance types conditioned on the contextual typed event instances, leveraging co-occurrence events as remarkable evidence in prediction. We conduct experiments on two public benchmarks, MAVEN and ACE-2005 dataset. Empirical results demonstrate the unity of both type-level and instance-level correlations, and the model achieves effectiveness performance on both benchmarks.|事件检测是信息检索的关键任务，其目的是识别事件触发器，并将其分类为预先定义的事件类型。在实际应用程序中，事件通常用许多细粒度类型进行注释，这些类型通常具有长尾类型性质和共现事件性质。现有的研究在未充分利用事件相关性的情况下，可能会限制事件检测的能力。本文同时结合了类型级和实例级的事件相关性，提出了一种新的框架，称为 CoreED。具体来说，我们设计了一种基于自适应图形的类型编码器来捕获实例级相关性，不仅从它们的训练数据中学习类型表示，而且从它们的相关类型中学习类型表示，从而导致更多的信息类型表示，特别是对于低资源类型。此外，我们设计了一个实例交互式解码器来捕获实例级的相关性，该解码器利用共现事件作为预测中的显著证据来预测以上下文类型的事件实例为条件的事件实例类型。我们在 MAVEN 和 ACE-2005两个公共基准数据集上进行了实验。实证结果表明，该模型实现了类型级和实例级相关性的统一，达到了两个基准的有效性表现。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=CorED:+Incorporating+Type-level+and+Instance-level+Correlations+for+Fine-grained+Event+Detection)|0|

In this paper, we introduce unsupervised generative models to extract dual-purpose rationales, which must not only be able to support a subsequent answer prediction, but also support a reproduction of the input query.

Hence, there is a recent pursuit of unanswerability of a question and its attribution. Attribution of unanswerability requires the system to choose an appropriate cause for an unanswerable question. As the task is sophisticated for even human beings, it is expensive to acquire labeled data, which makes it a low-data regime problem. Moreover, the causes themselves are semantically abstract and complex, and the process of attribution is heavily question- and context-dependent. Thus, a capable model has to carefully appreciate the causes, and then, judiciously contrast the question with its context, in order to cast it into the right cause. In response to the challenges, we present PTAU, which refers to and implements a high-level human reading strategy such that one reads with anticipation. In specific, PTAU leverages the recent prompt-tuning paradigm, and is further enhanced with two innovatively conceived modules: 1) a cause-oriented template module that constructs continuous templates towards certain attributing class in high dimensional vector space; and 2) a semantics-aware label module that exploits label semantics through contrastive learning to render the classes distinguishable. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed design better enlightens not only the attribution model, but also current question answering models, leading to superior performance.|当前的问答系统在面对现实情景时是不够的，因为它们很难意识到一个问题是否可以根据其上下文进行回答。因此，最近有一个追求一个问题及其归属无法回答。无法回答的归因要求系统为无法回答的问题选择合适的原因。由于这项任务甚至对人类来说都是复杂的，因此获取标记数据的成本很高，这使得它成为一个低数据量的系统问题。此外，原因本身具有语义抽象性和复杂性，归因过程严重依赖于问题和上下文。因此，一个有能力的模型必须仔细地鉴别原因，然后，明智地将问题与其上下文进行对比，以便将其投入正确的原因。为了应对这些挑战，我们提出了 PTAU，它提出并实施了一种高水平的人类阅读策略，使人们在阅读时带有预期性。具体而言，PTAU 利用了最近的提示调优范式，并进一步增强了两个创新构想的模块: 1)面向原因的模板模块，在高维向量空间中构建针对特定属性类的连续模板; 2)语义感知的标签模块，通过对比学习利用标签语义来使类可区分。大量实验表明，该设计不仅对归因模型有较好的启发作用，而且对现有的问答模型也有较好的启发作用，具有较好的性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=PTAU:+Prompt+Tuning+for+Attributing+Unanswerable+Questions)|0|

To solve these problems, we propose the dual graph question-answer attention networks (DGQAN) for answer selection task. Aims to fully understand the internal structure of the question and the corresponding answer, firstly, we construct a dual-CQA concept graph with graph convolution networks using the original question and answer text.

Further, a novel dual attention mechanism is incorporated to model both the internal and external semantic relations among questions and answers. More importantly, we conduct experiment to investigate the impact of each layer in the BERT model.

As a result, they either suffer from conflicts among causal relations predicted separately or require a set of additional constraints to resolve such conflicts. We propose to study this task in a more realistic setting, where event-level causality identification can be made. The advantage is two folds: 1) with modeling different mentions of an event as a single unit, no more conflicts among predicted results, without any extra constraints; 2) with the use of diverse knowledge sources (e.g., co-occurrence and coreference relations), a rich graph-based event structure can be induced from the document for supporting event-level causal inference. Graph convolutional network is used to encode such structural information, which aims to capture the local and non-local dependencies among nodes.

However, codes in real-world applications are generally long, such as code searches, which cannot be processed efficiently by existing PPLMs. To solve this problem, in this paper, we present SASA, a Structure-Aware Sparse Attention mechanism, which reduces the complexity and improves performance for long code understanding tasks. The key components in SASA are top-k sparse attention and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)-based structure-aware attention. With top-k sparse attention, the most crucial attention relation can be obtained with a lower computational cost. As the code structure represents the logic of the code statements, which is a complement to the code sequence characteristics, we further introduce AST structures into attention.

However, a major drawback of self-supervised methods is that they fall short of learning class discriminative node representations since no labeled information is utilized during training. To this end, we propose a novel semi-supervised method for graphs, GraFN, that leverages few labeled nodes to ensure nodes that belong to the same class to be grouped together, thereby achieving the best of both worlds of semi-supervised and self-supervised methods. Specifically, GraFN randomly samples support nodes from labeled nodes and anchor nodes from the entire graph. Then, it minimizes the difference between two predicted class distributions that are non-parametrically assigned by anchor-supports similarity from two differently augmented graphs. We experimentally show that GraFN surpasses both the semi-supervised and self-supervised methods in terms of node classification on real-world graphs.|尽管图形神经网络(GNN)在各种应用中取得了成功，但是当监督信号(即标记节点的数量)受到限制时，GNN 会遇到显著的性能下降，这是预期的，因为 GNN 仅仅基于从标记节点获得的监督进行训练。另一方面，最近的自我监督学习范式旨在通过解决不需要任何标记节点的托辞任务来训练 GNN，并且已经证明它的表现甚至优于用少量标记节点训练的 GNN。然而，自监督方法的一个主要缺点是，由于在训练过程中没有使用标记信息，因此它们不能很好地表示学习类的判别节点。为此，我们提出了一种新的图的半监督方法，GraFN，它利用少量的标记节点来确保属于同一类的节点被分组在一起，从而实现了半监督和自监督方法的最佳结合。具体来说，GraFN 随机采样支持来自标记节点的节点和来自整个图的锚节点。然后，从两个不同的增广图中最小化由锚支持相似性非参数赋值的两个预测类分布之间的差异。实验结果表明，GraFN 在实际图的节点分类方面优于半监督和自监督方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=GraFN:+Semi-Supervised+Node+Classification+on+Graph+with+Few+Labels+via+Non-Parametric+Distribution+Assignment)|0|

A growing field of interest tries to leverage external information in the decoding process so that the generated texts have desired properties, such as being more natural, non toxic, faithful, or having a specific writing style. A solution is to use a classifier at each generation step, resulting in a cooperative environment where the classifier guides the decoding of the language model distribution towards relevant texts for the task at hand. In this paper, we examine three families of (transformer-based) discriminators for this specific task of cooperative decoding: bidirectional, left-to-right and generative ones. We evaluate the pros and cons of these different types of discriminators for cooperative generation, exploring respective accuracy on classification tasks along with their impact on the resulting sample quality and computational performances.

|[Dual Pseudo Supervision for Semi-Supervised Text Classification with a Reliable Teacher](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531887)|Shujie Li, Min Yang, Chengming Li, Ruifeng Xu|Harbin Institute of Technology & Peng Cheng Lab, Shenzhen, China; University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China; Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen, China; Sun Yat-sen University, Shenzhen, China|In this paper, we study the semi-supervised text classification (SSTC) by exploring both labeled and extra unlabeled data. One of the most popular SSTC techniques is pseudo-labeling which assigns pseudo labels for unlabeled data via a teacher classifier trained on labeled data. These pseudo labeled data is then applied to train a student classifier. However, when the pseudo labels are inaccurate, the student classifier will learn from inaccurate data and get even worse performance than the teacher. To mitigate this issue, we propose a simple yet efficient pseudo-labeling framework called Dual Pseudo Supervision (DPS), which exploits the feedback signal from the student to guide the teacher to generate better pseudo labels. In particular, we alternately update the student based on the pseudo labeled data annotated by the teacher and optimize the teacher based on the student's performance via meta learning. In addition, we also design a consistency regularization term to further improve the stability of the teacher. With the above two strategies, the learned reliable teacher can provide more accurate pseudo-labels to the student and thus improve the overall performance of text classification. We conduct extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (i.e., AG News, Yelp and Yahoo) to verify the effectiveness of our DPS method. Experimental results show that our approach achieves substantially better performance than the strong competitors. For reproducibility, we will release our code and data of this paper publicly at https://github.com/GRIT621/DPS.|本文通过对已标记和未标记数据的分析，研究了半监督文本分类算法(SSTC)。最流行的 SSTC 技术之一是伪标记技术，它通过对标记数据进行训练的教师分类器为未标记的数据分配伪标记。然后应用这些伪标记数据训练学生分类器。然而，当伪标签不准确时，学生分类器会从不准确的数据中学习，得到比教师更差的性能。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个简单而有效的伪标签框架，称为双伪监督(DPS) ，它利用学生的反馈信号来指导教师生成更好的伪标签。特别是，我们交替更新学生的基础上伪标记数据的教师注释和优化教师的基础上学生的表现通过元学习。此外，我们还设计了一个一致性正则项，以进一步提高教师的稳定性。通过以上两种策略，学习可靠的教师可以为学生提供更准确的伪标签，从而提高文本分类的整体性能。我们对三个基准数据集(即 AG News、 Yelp 和 Yahoo)进行了广泛的实验，以验证我们的 DPS 方法的有效性。实验结果表明，我们的方法实现了大大优于强竞争对手的性能。为确保重复性，我们会在 https://github.com/grit621/dps 公开发布本文件的代码和数据。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Dual+Pseudo+Supervision+for+Semi-Supervised+Text+Classification+with+a+Reliable+Teacher)|0|
|[An Efficient Fusion Mechanism for Multimodal Low-resource Setting](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531900)|Dushyant Singh Chauhan, Asif Ekbal, Pushpak Bhattacharyya|Indian Institute of Technology Patna, Patna, India|The effective fusion of multiple modalities (i.e., text, acoustic, and visual) is a non-trivial task, as these modalities often carry specific and diverse information and do not contribute equally. The fusion of different modalities could even be more challenging under the low-resource setting, where we have fewer samples for training. This paper proposes a multi-representative fusion mechanism that generates diverse fusions with multiple modalities and then chooses the best fusion among them. To achieve this, we first apply convolution filters on multimodal inputs to generate different and diverse representations of modalities. We then fuse pairwise modalities with multiple representations to get the multiple fusions. Finally, we propose an attention mechanism that only selects the most appropriate fusion, which eventually helps resolve the noise problem by ignoring the noisy fusions. We evaluate our proposed approach on three low-resource multimodal sentiment analysis datasets, i.e., YouTube, MOUD, and ICT-MMMO. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed approach with the accuracies of 59.3%, 83.0%, and 84.1% for the YouTube, MOUD, and ICT-MMMO datasets, respectively.|多种模式(即文本、声学和视觉)的有效融合是一项非常重要的任务，因为这些模式往往携带特定的、多样化的信息，并且不能平等地作出贡献。在资源匮乏的情况下，不同模式的融合可能更具挑战性，因为我们的培训样本较少。提出了一种多代表性融合机制，该机制通过多种融合方式生成多种融合，然后从中选择最佳融合方式。为了实现这一点，我们首先应用卷积滤波器的多模式输入，以产生不同的和不同的表示形式。然后，我们融合成对模式与多重表示，以获得多重融合。最后，我们提出了一种注意机制，只选择最适当的融合，这最终有助于解决噪声问题，而忽略了噪声融合。我们在三个低资源多模态情绪分析数据集(即 YouTube、 MOUD 和 ICT-MMMO)上评估了我们提出的方法。实验结果表明，该方法对 YouTube、 MOUD 和 ICT-MMMO 数据集的准确率分别为59.3% 、83.0% 和84.1% 。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=An+Efficient+Fusion+Mechanism+for+Multimodal+Low-resource+Setting)|0|

However, when using a pre-trained BERT-based encoder, existing approaches for selecting representative sentences for text summarization are inadequate since the encoder is not explicitly trained for representing sentences. Simply providing the BERT-initialized sentences to cross-sentential graph-based neural networks (GNNs) to encode semantic features of the sentences is not ideal because doing so fail to integrate other summary-worthy features like sentence importance and positions. This paper presents MuchSUM, a better approach for extractive text summarization. MuchSUM is a multi-channel graph convolutional network designed to explicitly incorporate multiple salient summary-worthy features. Specifically, we introduce three specific graph channels to encode the node textual features, node centrality features, and node position features, respectively, under bipartite word-sentence heterogeneous graphs. Then, a cross-channel convolution operation is designed to distill the common graph representations shared by different channels. Finally, the sentence representations of each channel are fused for extractive summarization. We also investigate three weighted graphs in each channel to infuse edge features for graph-based summarization modeling.

Recent studies point out that rewriting extractive summaries help improve the performance with a more concise and comprehensible output summary, which uses a sentence as a textual unit. However, a single document sentence normally cannot supply sufficient information. In this paper, we apply elementary discourse unit (EDU) as textual unit of content selection. In order to utilize EDU for generating a high quality summary, we propose a novel summarization model that first designs an EDU selector to choose salient content. Then, the generator model rewrites the selected EDUs as the final summary. To determine the relevancy of each EDU on the entire document, we choose to apply group tag embedding, which can establish the connection between summary sentences and relevant EDUs, so that our generator does not only focus on selected EDUs, but also ingest the entire original document.

Recently, signed graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown superior performance in the most common signed graph analysis task, i.e., link sign prediction. Existing signed GNNs follow the classic nonlinear-propagation paradigm in unsigned GNNs. However, several recent studies on unsigned GNNs have shown that such a paradigm increases training difficulty and even reduces performance in various unsigned graph analysis tasks. Meanwhile, most of the public real-world signed graph datasets do not provide node features. These motivate us to consider whether the existing complex model architecture is suitable. In this work, we aim to simplify the architecture of signed GNNs to make it more concise and appropriate for link sign prediction. We propose a simplified signed graph convolution network model called LightSGCN. Specifically, LightSGCN utilizes linear propagation based on the balance theory, a widely adopted social theory. Then, the linear combination of hidden representations at each layer is used as the final representations. Moreover, we also propose a tailored prediction function. These finally yield a simple yet effective LightSGCN model, which is more interpretable, easier to implement, and more efficient to train. Experimental results on four real-world signed graphs demonstrate that such a linear method outperforms the state-of-the-art signed GNNs methods with significant improvement in the link sign prediction task and achieves more than 100X speedup over the most similar and simplest baseline.|符号图有正负两个链接，在现实世界中广泛存在。最近，签名图神经网络(GNN)在最常见的签名图分析任务，即链路符号预测中表现出了优越的性能。现有的签名 GNN 遵循无签名 GNN 中经典的非线性传播范式。然而，最近几项关于无符号 GNN 的研究表明，这种模式增加了训练难度，甚至降低了各种无符号图分析任务的性能。同时，现实世界中的大多数公共签名图数据集都没有提供节点特征。这促使我们考虑现有的复杂模型体系结构是否合适。在这项工作中，我们的目标是简化签名 GNN 的体系结构，使其更简洁，适合链路符号预测。我们提出了一个简化的符号图卷积网络模型，称为 LightSGCN。具体来说，LightSGCN 利用基于平衡理论的线性传播，这是一种被广泛采用的社会理论。然后，每一层的隐藏表示的线性组合被用作最终的表示。此外，我们还提出了一个量身定制的预测函数。这些最终产生了一个简单而有效的 LightSGCN 模型，该模型更易于解释、更易于实现、更易于训练。实验结果表明，这种线性方法的性能优于最先进的签名 GNN 方法，在链路符号预测任务方面有显著改进，在最相似和最简单的基线上实现了超过100倍的加速。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=LightSGCN:+Powering+Signed+Graph+Convolution+Network+for+Link+Sign+Prediction+with+Simplified+Architecture+Design)|0|
