|[Contrastive Cross-domain Recommendation in Matching](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539125)|Ruobing Xie, Qi Liu, Liangdong Wang, Shukai Liu, Bo Zhang, Leyu Lin|WeChat, Tencent, Beijing, China|Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) aims to provide better recommendation results in the target domain with the help of the source domain, which is widely used and explored in real-world systems. However, CDR in the matching (i.e., candidate generation) module struggles with the data sparsity and popularity bias issues in both representation learning and knowledge transfer. In this work, we propose a novel Contrastive Cross-Domain Recommendation (CCDR) framework for CDR in matching. Specifically, we build a huge diversified preference network to capture multiple information reflecting user diverse interests, and design an intra-domain contrastive learning (intra-CL) and three inter-domain contrastive learning (inter-CL) tasks for better representation learning and knowledge transfer. The intra-CL enables more effective and balanced training inside the target domain via a graph augmentation, while the inter-CL builds different types of cross-domain interactions from user, taxonomy, and neighbor aspects. In experiments, CCDR achieves significant improvements on both offline and online evaluations in a real-world system. Currently, we have deployed our CCDR on WeChat Top Stories, affecting plenty of users.

|[Graph-Flashback Network for Next Location Recommendation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539383)|Xuan Rao, Lisi Chen, Yong Liu, Shuo Shang, Bin Yao, Peng Han|Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Chengdu, Peoples R China; Aalborg Univ, Aalborg, Denmark; Nanyang Technol Univ, Singapore, Singapore|Next Point-of Interest (POI) recommendation plays an important role in location-based applications, which aims to recommend the next POIs to users that they are most likely to visit based on their historical trajectories. Existing methods usually use rich side information, or customized POI graphs to capture the sequential patterns among POIs. However, the graphs only focus on connectivity between POIs. Few studies propose to explicitly learn a weighted POI graph, which could reflect the transition patterns among POIs and show the importance of its different neighbors for each POI. In addition, these approaches simply utilize the user characteristics for personalized POI recommendation without sufficient consideration. To this end, we construct a novel User-POI Knowledge Graph with strong representation ability, called Spatial-Temporal Knowledge Graph (STKG). STKG is used to learn the representations of each node (i.e., user, POI) and each edge. Then, we design a similarity function to construct our POI transition graph based on the learned representations. To incorporate the learned graph into sequential model, we propose a novel network Graph-Flashback for recommendation. Graph-Flashback applies a simplified Graph Convolution Network (GCN) on the POI transition graph to enrich the representation of each POI. Further, we define a similarity function to consider both spatiotemporal information and user preference in modelling sequential regularity. Experimental results on two real-world datasets show that our proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance and significantly outperforms all existing solutions.|下一兴趣点（POI）推荐在基于位置的服务中具有重要作用，其目标是根据用户的历史轨迹推荐最可能访问的下一个POI。现有方法通常使用丰富的辅助信息或定制化POI图来捕捉POI间的序列模式。然而这些图结构仅关注POI间的连通性，目前鲜有研究尝试显式学习加权POI图——这种图既能反映POI间的转移模式，又能展示每个POI不同邻居的重要性。此外，现有方案在个性化POI推荐中未能充分考量用户特征。为此，我们构建了具有强表征能力的用户-兴趣点知识图谱（STKG），该图谱可用于学习每个节点（用户、POI）及边的表征。基于学习到的表征，我们设计了相似度函数构建POI转移图。为了将学习到的图结构融入序列模型，我们提出新型推荐网络Graph-Flashback：该网络在POI转移图上应用简化图卷积网络（GCN）以丰富每个POI的表征，并通过定义融合时空信息与用户偏好的相似度函数来建模序列规律性。在两个真实数据集上的实验表明，所提方法实现了最先进的性能，显著优于所有现有解决方案。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Graph-Flashback+Network+for+Next+Location+Recommendation)|9|
|[Meta-Learned Metrics over Multi-Evolution Temporal Graphs](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539313)|Dongqi Fu, Liri Fang, Ross Maciejewski, Vetle I. Torvik, Jingrui He|Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ USA; Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA|Graph metric learning methods aim to learn the distance metric over graphs such that similar (e.g., same class) graphs are closer and dissimilar (e.g., different class) graphs are farther apart. This is of critical importance in many graph classification applications such as drug discovery and epidemics categorization. Most, if not all, graph metric learning techniques consider the input graph as static, and largely ignore the intrinsic dynamics of temporal graphs. However, in practice, a graph typically has heterogeneous dynamics (e.g., microscopic and macroscopic evolution patterns). As such, labeling a temporal graph is usually expensive and also requires background knowledge. To learn a good metric over temporal graphs, we propose a temporal graph metric learning framework, Temp-GFSM. With only a few labeled temporal graphs, Temp-GFSM outputs a good metric that can accurately classify different temporal graphs and be adapted to discover new subspaces for unseen classes. Each proposed component in Temp-GFSM answers the following questions: What patterns are evolving in a temporal graph? How to weigh these patterns to represent the characteristics of different temporal classes? And how to learn the metric with the guidance from only a few labels? Finally, the experimental results on real-world temporal graph classification tasks from various domains show the effectiveness of our Temp-GFSM.|图度量学习方法旨在学习图结构上的距离度量，使相似（如同类别）图更接近，相异（如不同类别）图更疏远。这在药物发现、疫情分类等图分类应用中具有关键意义。现有绝大多数图度量学习技术将输入图视为静态对象，基本忽略了时序图的内在动态特性。然而实际应用中，图通常具有异构动态特征（如微观和宏观演化模式）。由于时序图标注成本高昂且需要专业知识，为学习有效的时序图度量，我们提出时序图度量学习框架Temp-GFSM。该框架仅需少量标注样本即可学习到优质度量，既能准确分类不同时序图，又能适配未知类别的子空间发现。Temp-GFSM通过三个核心组件分别回答以下问题：时序图中存在何种演化模式？如何加权这些模式以表征不同时序类别的特征？如何通过少量标注指导度量学习？最终在多个领域的真实时序图分类任务上的实验结果验证了Temp-GFSM的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Meta-Learned+Metrics+over+Multi-Evolution+Temporal+Graphs)|9|

|[Surrogate for Long-Term User Experience in Recommender Systems](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539073)|Yuyan Wang, Mohit Sharma, Can Xu, Sriraj Badam, Qian Sun, Lee Richardson, Lisa Chung, Ed H. Chi, Minmin Chen|Google Research, Brain Team, Mountain View, CA, USA; Google, Mountain View, CA, USA|Over the years we have seen recommender systems shifting focus from optimizing short-term engagement toward improving long-term user experience on the platforms. While defining good long-term user experience is still an active research area, we focus on one specific aspect of improved long-term user experience here, which is user revisiting the platform. These long term outcomes however are much harder to optimize due to the sparsity in observing these events and low signal-to-noise ratio (weak connection) between these long-term outcomes and a single recommendation. To address these challenges, we propose to establish the association between these long-term outcomes and a set of more immediate term user behavior signals that can serve as surrogates for optimization. To this end, we conduct a large-scale study of user behavior logs on one of the largest industrial recommendation platforms serving billions of users. We study a broad set of sequential user behavior patterns and standardize a procedure to pinpoint the subset that has strong predictive power of the change in users' long-term visiting frequency. Specifically, they are predictive of users' increased visiting to the platform in $5$ months among the group of users with the same visiting frequency to begin with. We validate the identified subset of user behaviors by incorporating them as reward surrogates for long-term user experience in a reinforcement learning (RL) based recommender. Results from multiple live experiments on the industrial recommendation platform demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed set of surrogates in improving long-term user experience.|多年来，我们已经看到推荐系统的重点从优化短期参与转向改善平台上的长期用户体验。虽然定义良好的长期用户体验仍然是一个活跃的研究领域，我们在这里重点关注改善长期用户体验的一个具体方面，即用户重新访问平台。然而，这些长期结果更难优化，因为观察这些事件的信噪比很少，而且这些长期结果与单一建议之间的联系很弱。为了应对这些挑战，我们建议在这些长期结果和一组更直接的用户行为信号之间建立联系，这些信号可以作为优化的替代品。为此，我们在为数十亿用户服务的最大的工业推荐平台之一上，对用户行为日志进行了大规模的研究。我们研究了一组广泛的顺序用户行为模式，并标准化了一个过程，以确定子集有强大的预测能力的变化，用户的长期访问频率。具体来说，他们预测用户访问该平台的次数将在5美元一个月内增加，而且访问频率从一开始就相同。我们通过将已识别的用户行为子集作为基于强化学习(RL)的推荐系统中长期用户体验的奖励替代品来验证它们。在工业推荐平台上的多个现场实验结果证明了所提出的替代品集在改善长期用户体验方面的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Surrogate+for+Long-Term+User+Experience+in+Recommender+Systems)|7|
|[Multi-modal Siamese Network for Entity Alignment](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539244)|Liyi Chen, Zhi Li, Tong Xu, Han Wu, Zhefeng Wang, Nicholas Jing Yuan, Enhong Chen|Tsinghua Univ, Shenzhen Int Grad Sch, Beijing, Peoples R China; Univ Sci & Technol China, State Key Lab Cognit Intelligence, Hefei, Peoples R China; Huawei Cloud, Shenzhen, Peoples R China|The booming of multi-modal knowledge graphs (MMKGs) has raised the imperative demand for multi-modal entity alignment techniques, which facilitate the integration of multiple MMKGs from separate data sources. Unfortunately, prior arts harness multi-modal knowledge only via the heuristic merging of uni-modal feature embeddings. Therefore, inter-modal cues concealed in multi-modal knowledge could be largely ignored. To deal with that problem, in this paper, we propose a novel Multi-modal Siamese Network for Entity Alignment (MSNEA) to align entities in different MMKGs, in which multi-modal knowledge could be comprehensively leveraged by the exploitation of inter-modal effect. Specifically, we first devise a multi-modal knowledge embedding module to extract visual, relational, and attribute features of entities to generate holistic entity representations for distinct MMKGs. During this procedure, we employ inter-modal enhancement mechanisms to integrate visual features to guide relational feature learning and adaptively assign attention weights to capture valuable attributes for alignment. Afterwards, we design a multi-modal contrastive learning module to achieve inter-modal enhancement fusion with avoiding the overwhelming impact of weak modalities. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that our proposed MSNEA provides state-of-the-art performance with a large margin compared with competitive baselines.|多模态知识图谱(MMKG)的蓬勃发展催生了对多模态实体对齐技术的迫切需求，该技术有助于整合来自不同数据源的多个MMKG。现有方法仅通过单模态特征嵌入的启发式融合来利用多模态知识，导致多模态知识中隐含的模态间关联线索被大量忽略。针对这一问题，本文提出新型多模态孪生网络对齐模型(MSNEA)，通过挖掘模态间相互作用实现多模态知识的全面利用，以对齐不同MMKG中的实体。具体而言，我们首先设计多模态知识嵌入模块，提取实体的视觉、关系和属性特征，为不同MMKG生成整体实体表示。在此过程中，采用模态间增强机制整合视觉特征以指导关系特征学习，并自适应分配注意力权重以捕获有价值的对齐属性。随后设计多模态对比学习模块，在避免弱模态主导影响的前提下实现模态间增强融合。在两个公开数据集上的实验结果表明，与具有竞争力的基线方法相比，我们提出的MSNEA模型以显著优势实现了最先进的性能表现。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Multi-modal+Siamese+Network+for+Entity+Alignment)|7|
|[GraphMAE: Self-Supervised Masked Graph Autoencoders](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539321)|Zhenyu Hou, Xiao Liu, Yukuo Cen, Yuxiao Dong, Hongxia Yang, Chunjie Wang, Jie Tang|Alibaba Grp, DAMO Acad, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; BirenTech Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China|Self-supervised learning (SSL) has been extensively explored in recent years. Particularly, generative SSL has seen emerging success in natural language processing and other fields, such as the wide adoption of BERT and GPT. Despite this, contrastive learning---which heavily relies on structural data augmentation and complicated training strategies---has been the dominant approach in graph SSL, while the progress of generative SSL on graphs, especially graph autoencoders (GAEs), has thus far not reached the potential as promised in other fields. In this paper, we identify and examine the issues that negatively impact the development of GAEs, including their reconstruction objective, training robustness, and error metric. We present a masked graph autoencoder GraphMAE (code is publicly available at https://github.com/THUDM/GraphMAE) that mitigates these issues for generative self-supervised graph learning. Instead of reconstructing structures, we propose to focus on feature reconstruction with both a masking strategy and scaled cosine error that benefit the robust training of GraphMAE. We conduct extensive experiments on 21 public datasets for three different graph learning tasks. The results manifest that GraphMAE---a simple graph autoencoder with our careful designs---can consistently generate outperformance over both contrastive and generative state-of-the-art baselines. This study provides an understanding of graph autoencoders and demonstrates the potential of generative self-supervised learning on graphs.|近年来，自监督学习（SSL）得到广泛探索。其中，生成式自监督学习在自然语言处理等领域取得突破性进展，以BERT和GPT为代表的模型获得大规模应用。然而在图自监督学习领域，尽管对比学习——一种严重依赖结构化数据增强和复杂训练策略的方法——仍占据主导地位，但生成式方法（尤其是图自编码器GAEs）的发展尚未展现出其他领域所呈现的潜力。本文系统性地研究了制约图自编码器发展的关键问题，包括重建目标、训练鲁棒性和误差度量等方面，进而提出掩码图自编码器GraphMAE（代码开源地址：https://github.com/THUDM/GraphMAE）。该模型通过掩码策略和缩放余弦误差相结合的方式，将重建重点从结构重构转向特征重构，有效增强了训练鲁棒性。我们在21个公共数据集上针对三项图学习任务开展广泛实验，结果表明：采用精心设计的简单图自编码器GraphMAE，能够持续超越当前最先进的对比学习和生成式基线模型。本研究深化了对图自编码器的理解，并揭示了生成式自监督学习在图结构数据领域的巨大潜力。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=GraphMAE:+Self-Supervised+Masked+Graph+Autoencoders)|7|
|[MSDR: Multi-Step Dependency Relation Networks for Spatial Temporal Forecasting](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539397)|Dachuan Liu, Jin Wang, Shuo Shang, Peng Han|Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA; Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Chengdu, Peoples R China; Aalborg Univ, Aalborg, Denmark|Spatial temporal forecasting plays an important role in improving the quality and performance of Intelligent Transportation Systems. This task is rather challenging due to the complicated and long-range spatial temporal dependencies in traffic network. Existing studies typically employ different deep neural networks to learn the spatial and temporal representations so as to capture the complex and dynamic dependencies. In this paper, we argue that it is insufficient to capture the long-range spatial dependencies from the implicit representations learned by temporal extracting modules. To address this problem, we propose Multi-Step Dependency Relation (MSDR), a brand new variant of recurrent neural network. Instead of only looking at the hidden state from only one latest time step, MSDR explicitly takes those of multiple historical time steps as the input of each time unit. We also develop two strategies to incur the spatial information into the dependency relation embedding between multiple historical time steps and the current one in MSDR. On the basis of it, we propose the Graph-based MSDR (GMSDR) framework to support general spatial temporal forecasting applications by seamlessly integrating graph-based neural networks with MSDR. We evaluate our proposed approach on several popular datasets. The results show that the proposed GMSDR framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an obvious margin.|时空预测对提升智能交通系统的运行质量与性能具有重要作用。由于交通网络中存在着复杂的长程时空依赖性，该任务极具挑战性。现有研究通常采用不同深度神经网络学习时空表征，以捕捉复杂动态的依赖关系。本文指出，仅通过时序提取模块学习的隐式表征不足以有效捕获长程空间依赖性。为此，我们提出多步依赖关系（MSDR）——循环神经网络的全新变体。该模型突破传统单步隐藏状态输入模式，将多个历史时间步的隐藏状态同时作为每个时间单元的显式输入。我们还开发了两种策略，将空间信息嵌入到多个历史时间步与当前时间步的依赖关系中。在此基础上，提出基于图的MSDR框架（GMSDR），通过将图神经网络与MSDR无缝集成，为通用时空预测应用提供支持。在多个主流数据集上的实验表明，GMSDR框架以显著优势超越现有最先进方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=MSDR:+Multi-Step+Dependency+Relation+Networks+for+Spatial+Temporal+Forecasting)|7|
|[Joint Knowledge Graph Completion and Question Answering](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539289)|Lihui Liu, Boxin Du, Jiejun Xu, Yinglong Xia, Hanghang Tong|HRL Labs, Malibu, CA USA; Meta AI, Menlo Pk, CA USA; Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA|Knowledge graph reasoning plays a pivotal role in many real-world applications, such as network alignment, computational fact-checking, recommendation, and many more. Among these applications, knowledge graph completion (KGC) and multi-hop question answering over knowledge graph (Multi-hop KGQA) are two representative reasoning tasks. In the vast majority of the existing works, the two tasks are considered separately with different models or algorithms. However, we envision that KGC and Multi-hop KGQA are closely related to each other. Therefore, the two tasks will benefit from each other if they are approached adequately. In this work, we propose a neural model named BiNet to jointly handle KGC and multi-hop KGQA, and formulate it as a multi-task learning problem. Specifically, our proposed model leverages a shared embedding space and an answer scoring module, which allows the two tasks to automatically share latent features and learn the interactions between natural language question decoder and answer scoring module. Compared to the existing methods, the proposed BiNet model addresses both multi-hop KGQA and KGC tasks simultaneously with superior performance. Experiment results show that BiNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a wide range of KGQA and KGC benchmark datasets.|知识图谱推理在网络对齐、计算性事实核查、推荐系统等诸多实际应用中具有关键作用。其中，知识图谱补全（KGC）与基于知识图谱的多跳问答（Multi-hop KGQA）是两项具有代表性的推理任务。现有研究大多采用不同模型或算法分别处理这两个任务，但我们认为KGC与多跳KGQA具有紧密的内在关联。若采用恰当方法，二者可实现相互促进。本研究提出名为BiNet的神经网络模型，通过多任务学习框架联合处理KGC与多跳KGQA任务。具体而言，该模型利用共享嵌入空间和答案评分模块，使两个任务能够自动共享潜在特征，并实现自然语言问题解码器与答案评分模块的交互学习。与现有方法相比，BiNet模型能同时处理多跳KGQA和KGC任务且性能更优。实验结果表明，BiNet在多个KGQA和KGC基准数据集上均超越了现有最优方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Joint+Knowledge+Graph+Completion+and+Question+Answering)|7|

|[Multi-Behavior Hypergraph-Enhanced Transformer for Sequential Recommendation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539342)|Yuhao Yang, Chao Huang, Lianghao Xia, Yuxuan Liang, Yanwei Yu, Chenliang Li|National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China; Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China|Learning dynamic user preference has become an increasingly important component for many online platforms (e.g., video-sharing sites, e-commerce systems) to make sequential recommendations. Previous works have made many efforts to model item-item transitions over user interaction sequences, based on various architectures, e.g., recurrent neural networks and self-attention mechanism. Recently emerged graph neural networks also serve as useful backbone models to capture item dependencies in sequential recommendation scenarios. Despite their effectiveness, existing methods have far focused on item sequence representation with singular type of interactions, and thus are limited to capture dynamic heterogeneous relational structures between users and items (e.g., page view, add-to-favorite, purchase). To tackle this challenge, we design a Multi-Behavior Hypergraph-enhanced T ransformer framework (MBHT) to capture both short-term and long-term cross-type behavior dependencies. Specifically, a multi-scale Transformer is equipped with low-rank self-attention to jointly encode behavior-aware sequential patterns from fine-grained and coarse-grained levels. Additionally,we incorporate the global multi-behavior dependency into the hypergraph neural architecture to capture the hierarchical long-range item correlations in a customized manner. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our MBHT over various state-of- the-art recommendation solutions across different settings. Further ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our model design and benefits of the new MBHT framework. Our implementation code is released at: https://github.com/yuh-yang/MBHT-KDD22.|学习动态用户偏好已经成为许多在线平台(如视频分享网站、电子商务系统)提供顺序推荐的一个越来越重要的组成部分。以往的研究基于多种体系结构，如递归神经网络和自我注意机制，对用户交互序列上的项目-项目转换进行了大量的研究。最近出现的图形神经网络也可以作为有用的骨干模型，以捕获项目依赖的顺序推荐场景。尽管现有的方法很有效，但是现有的方法都集中在单一交互类型的项目序列表示上，因此仅限于捕获用户和项目之间的动态异构关系结构(例如，页面查看、添加到收藏夹、购买)。为了应对这一挑战，我们设计了一个多行为超图增强型 T 变换器框架(MBHT)来捕获短期和长期的跨类型行为依赖。具体而言，多尺度变压器配备低级自注意，以从细粒度和粗粒度级别联合编码行为感知的序列模式。此外，我们将全局多行为依赖引入到超图神经结构中，以自定义的方式获取层次化的远程项目相关性。实验结果表明，我们的 MBHT 优于不同设置的各种最先进的推荐解决方案。进一步的消融研究验证了我们的模型设计的有效性和新的 MBHT 框架的好处。我们的实施代码在以下 https://github.com/yuh-yang/mbht-kdd22发布:。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Multi-Behavior+Hypergraph-Enhanced+Transformer+for+Sequential+Recommendation)|6|

|[Learning to Rotate: Quaternion Transformer for Complicated Periodical Time Series Forecasting](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539234)|Weiqi Chen, Wenwei Wang, Bingqing Peng, Qingsong Wen, Tian Zhou, Liang Sun|Alibaba Grp, DAMO Acad, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; Alibaba Grp, DAMO Acad, Bellevue, WA USA|Time series forecasting is a critical and challenging problem in many real applications. Recently, Transformer-based models prevail in time series forecasting due to their advancement in long-range dependencies learning. Besides, some models introduce series decomposition to further unveil reliable yet plain temporal dependencies. Unfortunately, few models could handle complicated periodical patterns, such as multiple periods, variable periods, and phase shifts in real-world datasets. Meanwhile, the notorious quadratic complexity of dot-product attentions hampers long sequence modeling. To address these challenges, we design an innovative framework Quaternion Transformer (Quatformer), along with three major components: 1). learning-to-rotate attention (LRA) based on quaternions which introduces learnable period and phase information to depict intricate periodical patterns. 2). trend normalization to normalize the series representations in hidden layers of the model considering the slowly varying characteristic of trend. 3). decoupling LRA using global memory to achieve linear complexity without losing prediction accuracy. We evaluate our framework on multiple real-world time series datasets and observe an average 8.1% and up to 18.5% MSE improvement over the best state-of-the-art baseline.|时间序列预测是众多实际应用中的关键且具有挑战性的问题。近年来，基于Transformer的模型因其在长程依赖学习方面的优势，在时间序列预测领域占据主导地位。此外，一些模型通过引入序列分解技术进一步揭示了可靠而简洁的时序依赖关系。然而，现有模型难以有效处理现实数据集中复杂的周期性模式，如多重周期、可变周期和相位偏移等问题。同时，点积注意力机制著名的二次计算复杂度也阻碍了长序列建模能力。为解决这些挑战，我们设计了一个创新框架——四元数Transformer（Quatformer），其包含三大核心组件：1）基于四元数的可学习旋转注意力机制（LRA），通过引入可学习的周期和相位参数来刻画复杂周期性模式；2）考虑趋势项缓慢变化特性的趋势归一化方法，对模型隐藏层的序列表示进行标准化处理；3）采用全局记忆的解耦LRA机制，在保持预测精度的同时实现线性计算复杂度。我们在多个真实世界时间序列数据集上进行评估，结果表明该框架相比最佳基线模型平均提升8.1%的MSE指标，最高提升幅度达18.5%。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Learning+to+Rotate:+Quaternion+Transformer+for+Complicated+Periodical+Time+Series+Forecasting)|6|

|[CrossCBR: Cross-view Contrastive Learning for Bundle Recommendation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539229)|Yunshan Ma, Yingzhi He, An Zhang, Xiang Wang, TatSeng Chua|Sea NExT Joint Lab, Galaxis, Singapore; Univ Sci & Technol China, Hefei, Peoples R China|Bundle recommendation aims to recommend a bundle of related items to users, which can satisfy the users' various needs with one-stop convenience. Recent methods usually take advantage of both user-bundle and user-item interactions information to obtain informative representations for users and bundles, corresponding to bundle view and item view, respectively. However, they either use a unified view without differentiation or loosely combine the predictions of two separate views, while the crucial cooperative association between the two views' representations is overlooked. In this work, we propose to model the cooperative association between the two different views through cross-view contrastive learning. By encouraging the alignment of the two separately learned views, each view can distill complementary information from the other view, achieving mutual enhancement. Moreover, by enlarging the dispersion of different users/bundles, the self-discrimination of representations is enhanced. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms SOTA baselines by a large margin.

In recent years, graph neural networks have emerged as a prevalent paradigm of learning with structured data. However, most brain network datasets are limited in sample sizes due to the relatively high cost of data acquisition, which hinders the deep learning models from sufficient training. Inspired by meta-learning that learns new concepts fast with limited training examples, this paper studies data-efficient training strategies for analyzing brain connectomes in a cross-dataset setting. Specifically, we propose to meta-train the model on datasets of large sample sizes and transfer the knowledge to small datasets. In addition, we also explore two brain-network-oriented designs, including atlas transformation and adaptive task reweighing. Compared to other pre-training strategies, our meta-learning-based approach achieves higher and stabler performance, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed solutions. The framework is also able to derive new insights regarding the similarities among datasets and diseases in a data-driven fashion.|脑网络以图结构形式刻画了大脑区域间复杂的连接关系，为研究脑连接组提供了有力工具。近年来，图神经网络已成为处理结构化数据的主流范式。然而，由于数据采集成本较高，大多数脑网络数据集的样本量有限，这阻碍了深度学习模型的充分训练。受元学习能够通过少量训练样本快速学习新概念的启发，本研究探索了在跨数据集场景下进行脑连接组分析的数据高效训练策略。具体而言，我们提出在多样本数据集上进行元训练，并将知识迁移至小规模数据集。此外，我们还探索了两种面向脑网络的定制化设计：图谱转换和自适应任务权重调整。与其他预训练策略相比，基于元学习的方法获得了更高且更稳定的性能，验证了所提出方案的有效性。该框架还能以数据驱动的方式揭示数据集与疾病间相似性的新见解。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Data-Efficient+Brain+Connectome+Analysis+via+Multi-Task+Meta-Learning)|5|

Zuluaga, Eamonn J. Keogh||Time series anomaly detection remains one of the most active areas of research in data mining. In spite of the dozens of creative solutions proposed for this problem, recent empirical evidence suggests that time series discords, a relatively simple twenty-year old distance-based technique, remains among the state-of-art techniques. While there are many algorithms for computing the time series discords, they all have limitations. First, they are limited to the batch case, whereas the online case is more actionable. Second, these algorithms exhibit poor scalability beyond tens of thousands of datapoints. In this work we introduce DAMP, a novel algorithm that addresses both these issues. DAMP computes exact left-discords on fast arriving streams, at up to 300,000 Hz using a commodity desktop. This allows us to find time series discords in datasets with trillions of datapoints for the first time. We will demonstrate the utility of our algorithm with the most ambitious set of time series anomaly detection experiments ever conducted.|时间序列异常检测一直是数据挖掘领域中最活跃的研究方向之一。尽管已有数十种创新性解决方案被提出，但近期实证研究表明，时间序列不和谐模式——一种相对简单、具有二十年历史的基于距离的技术——仍处于最先进技术行列。尽管存在多种计算时间序列不和谐模式的算法，但它们都存在局限性：首先，这些算法仅限于批处理场景，而在线检测场景更具可操作性；其次，这些算法在超过数万个数据点时的可扩展性表现不佳。本研究提出新型算法DAMP，可同时解决这两个问题。DAMP能在普通台式计算机上以最高30万赫兹的频率，对快速到达的数据流进行精确左向不和谐模式检测。这使我们首次能够在具有数万亿数据点的数据集中发现时间序列不和谐模式。我们将通过执行迄今最雄心勃勃的时间序列异常检测实验集，来证明该算法的实用价值。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Matrix+Profile+XXIV:+Scaling+Time+Series+Anomaly+Detection+to+Trillions+of+Datapoints+and+Ultra-fast+Arriving+Data+Streams)|5|

Interactions from multiple relation types can encode valuable information about social network entities not fully captured by a single relation; for instance, a user's preference for accounts to follow may depend on both user-content engagement interactions and the other users they follow. In this work, we investigate knowledge-graph embeddings for entities in the Twitter HIN (TwHIN); we show that these pretrained representations yield significant offline and online improvement for a diverse range of downstream recommendation and classification tasks: personalized ads rankings, account follow-recommendation, offensive content detection, and search ranking.

|[Multi-Task Fusion via Reinforcement Learning for Long-Term User Satisfaction in Recommender Systems](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539040)|Qihua Zhang, Junning Liu, Yuzhuo Dai, Yiyan Qi, Yifan Yuan, Kunlun Zheng, Fan Huang, Xianfeng Tan|Tencent, Shenzhen, China; Tencent, Beijing, China|Recommender System (RS) is an important online application that affects billions of users every day. The mainstream RS ranking framework is composed of two parts: a Multi-Task Learning model (MTL) that predicts various user feedback, i.e., clicks, likes, sharings, and a Multi-Task Fusion model (MTF) that combines the multi-task outputs into one final ranking score with respect to user satisfaction. There has not been much research on the fusion model while it has great impact on the final recommendation as the last crucial process of the ranking. To optimize long-term user satisfaction rather than obtain instant returns greedily, we formulate MTF task as Markov Decision Process (MDP) within a recommendation session and propose a Batch Reinforcement Learning (RL) based Multi-Task Fusion framework (BatchRL-MTF) that includes a Batch RL framework and an online exploration. The former exploits Batch RL to learn an optimal recommendation policy from the fixed batch data offline for long-term user satisfaction, while the latter explores potential high-value actions online to break through the local optimal dilemma. With a comprehensive investigation on user behaviors, we model the user satisfaction reward with subtle heuristics from two aspects of user stickiness and user activeness. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on a billion-sample level real-world dataset to show the effectiveness of our model. We propose a conservative offline policy estimator (Conservative-OPEstimator) to test our model offline. Furthermore, we take online experiments in a real recommendation environment to compare performance of different models. As one of few Batch RL researches applied in MTF task successfully, our model has also been deployed on a large-scale industrial short video platform, serving hundreds of millions of users.|推荐系统(RS)是一个重要的在线应用程序，每天影响数十亿用户。RS 的主流排名框架由两部分组成: 一个是多任务学习模型(Multi-Task Learning model，MTL) ，它预测用户的各种反馈，即点击、喜欢、分享; 另一个是多任务融合模型(Multi-Task Fusion model，MTF) ，它将多任务输出结合成一个用户满意度的最终排名得分。融合模型作为排名的最后一个关键过程，对最终推荐有着重要的影响。为了优化长期用户满意度，而不是贪婪地获得即时回报，我们在一个推荐会话中将 MTF 任务制定为马可夫决策过程(mDP) ，并提出了一个基于批处理强化学习(RL)的多任务融合框架(BatchRL-MTF) ，其中包括一个批处理强化学习框架和一个在线探索。前者利用批量 RL 从离线的固定批量数据中学习最优推荐策略以获得长期用户满意度，后者利用在线的潜在高价值行为来突破局部最优困境。通过对用户行为的全面调查，从用户粘性和用户主动性两个方面采用微妙的启发式方法建立了用户满意奖励模型。最后，我们在十亿个样本级别的真实世界数据集上进行了广泛的实验，以显示我们的模型的有效性。我们提出了一个保守的离线策略估计(保守-最优估计)来测试我们的模型离线。此外，我们在一个真实的推荐环境中进行在线实验，比较不同模型的性能。作为少数几个成功应用于 MTF 任务的批量 RL 研究之一，我们的模型也已经部署在一个大型工业短视频平台上，为数亿用户服务。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Multi-Task+Fusion+via+Reinforcement+Learning+for+Long-Term+User+Satisfaction+in+Recommender+Systems)|4|

Besides considering the relevance between recommendations and trigger item, the recommendations should also be diversified to avoid information cocoons. However, existing diversified recommendation methods mainly focus on item-level diversity which is insufficient when the recommended items are all relevant to the target item. Moreover, redundant or noisy item features might affect the performance of simple feature-aware recommendation approaches. Faced with these issues, we propose a Feature Disentanglement Self-Balancing Re-ranking framework (FDSB) to capture feature- aware diversity. The framework consists of two major modules, namely disentangled attention encoder (DAE) and self-balanced multi-aspect ranker. In DAE, we use multi-head attention to learn disentangled aspects from rich item features. In the ranker, we develop an aspect-specific ranking mechanism that is able to adaptively balance the relevance and diversity for each aspect. In experiments, we conduct offline evaluation on the collected dataset and deploy FDSB on KuaiShou app for online ??/?? test on the function of relevant recommendation. The significant improvements on both recommendation quality and user experience verify the effectiveness of our approach.|相关推荐是一种特殊的推荐场景，当用户对一个目标项目表示兴趣时(例如，点击、喜欢和购买) ，它会提供相关的项目。除了考虑建议与触发项目之间的相关性之外，建议还应当多样化，以避免信息茧。然而，现有的多样化推荐方法主要侧重于项目层次的多样性，当推荐项目都与目标项目相关时，这种多样性是不够的。此外，冗余或嘈杂的项目特征可能会影响简单的特征感知推荐方法的性能。针对这些问题，我们提出了一种特征分离自平衡重排框架(FDSB)来捕获特征感知的多样性。该框架包括两个主要模块，即分离注意编码器(DAE)和自平衡多方面排序器。在 DAE 中，我们使用多头注意从丰富的项目特征中学习分离的方面。在排名中，我们开发了一个方面特定的排名机制，能够自适应地平衡每个方面的相关性和多样性。在实验中，我们对收集到的数据集进行离线评估，并在快手应用上部署 FDSB 以实现在线? ? ？/?？检验有关推荐的作用。在推荐质量和用户体验方面的重大改进验证了我们方法的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Feature-aware+Diversified+Re-ranking+with+Disentangled+Representations+for+Relevant+Recommendation)|4|

The recommended songs are played automatically although users may not pay any attention to them, posing a challenge of user attention bias in training recommendation models, i.e., the training instances contain a large number of false-positive labels (users' feedback). Existing approaches either directly use the auto-feedbacks or heuristically delete the potential false-positive labels. Both of the approaches lead to biased results because the false-positive labels cause the shift of training data distribution, hurting the accuracy of the recommendation models. In this paper, we propose a learning-based counterfactual approach to adjusting the user auto-feedbacks and learning the recommendation models using Neural Dueling Bandit algorithm, called NDB. Specifically, NDB maintains two neural networks: a user attention network for computing the importance weights that are used for modifying the original rewards, and another random network trained with dueling bandit for conducting online recommendations based on the modified rewards. Theoretical analysis showed that the modified rewards are statistically unbiased, and the learned bandit policy enjoys a sub-linear regret bound. Experimental results demonstrated that NDB can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art baselines.|在流媒体应用程序中，比如音乐应用程序，歌曲被持续推荐到用户的日常生活中。虽然用户可能没有注意到这些歌曲，但推荐的歌曲会自动播放，这对训练推荐模型中的用户注意偏差提出了挑战，即训练实例中包含大量假阳性标签(用户反馈)。现有的方法要么直接使用自动反馈，要么启发性地删除潜在的假阳性标签。这两种方法都会导致结果偏差，因为假阳性标签会引起训练数据分布的变化，从而影响推荐模型的准确性。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于学习的反事实方法来调整用户自动反馈和学习推荐模型的神经决斗盗贼算法，称为 NDB。具体来说，新开发银行维护两个神经网络: 一个是用户注意力网络，用于计算用于修改原始奖励的重要性权重，另一个是与决斗强盗一起训练的随机网络，用于根据修改后的奖励进行在线推荐。理论分析表明，修正后的奖励具有统计上的无偏性，学会的土匪政策具有亚线性后悔界限。实验结果表明，新数据库的性能明显优于最先进的基线。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Counteracting+User+Attention+Bias+in+Music+Streaming+Recommendation+via+Reward+Modification)|4|

Due to the security and privacy concerns, it is more practical to perform adversarial attacks under the black-box setting, where the architecture/parameters and training data of target systems cannot be easily accessed by attackers. However, generating high-quality fake user profiles under black-box setting is rather challenging with limited resources to target systems. To address this challenge, in this work, we introduce a novel strategy by leveraging items' attribute information (i.e., items' knowledge graph), which can be publicly accessible and provide rich auxiliary knowledge to enhance the generation of fake user profiles. More specifically, we propose a knowledge graph-enhanced black-box attacking framework (KGAttack) to effectively learn attacking policies through deep reinforcement learning techniques, in which knowledge graph is seamlessly integrated into hierarchical policy networks to generate fake user profiles for performing adversarial black-box attacks. Comprehensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attacking framework under the black-box setting.|近期研究表明，基于深度神经网络的推荐系统易受对抗性攻击影响——攻击者可通过向目标系统注入精心伪造的用户画像（即伪造用户交互过的物品集合），实现提升或降低特定目标物品排名的恶意目的。鉴于安全与隐私限制，在黑盒设置下实施攻击更具现实意义，因此攻击者难以获取目标系统的架构/参数及训练数据。然而在有限资源条件下，生成高质量伪造用户画像面临巨大挑战。为解决该问题，本研究创新性地利用可公开获取的物品属性信息（即物品知识图谱），通过其丰富的辅助知识增强伪造用户画像的生成效果。具体而言，我们提出知识图谱增强型黑盒攻击框架（KGAttack），通过深度强化学习技术有效学习攻击策略：该框架将知识图谱无缝集成至分层策略网络，生成用于执行对抗性黑盒攻击的伪造用户画像。基于多个真实数据集的综合实验表明，所提攻击框架在黑盒设置下具有显著有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Knowledge-enhanced+Black-box+Attacks+for+Recommendations)|4|

Most existing SRL methods rely on explicit item IDs for developing the sequence models to better capture user preference. Though effective to some extent, these methods are difficult to be transferred to new recommendation scenarios, due to the limitation by explicitly modeling item IDs. To tackle this issue, we present a novel universal sequence representation learning approach, named UniSRec. The proposed approach utilizes the associated description text of items to learn transferable representations across different recommendation scenarios. For learning universal item representations, we design a lightweight item encoding architecture based on parametric whitening and mixture-of-experts enhanced adaptor. For learning universal sequence representations, we introduce two contrastive pre-training tasks by sampling multi-domain negatives. With the pre-trained universal sequence representation model, our approach can be effectively transferred to new recommendation domains or platforms in a parameter-efficient way, under either inductive or transductive settings. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Especially, our approach also leads to a performance improvement in a cross-platform setting, showing the strong transferability of the proposed universal SRL method.

Hence, they have become the de facto solution in a variety of decision-making scenarios. However, GNNs could yield biased results against certain demographic subgroups. Some recent works have empirically shown that the biased structure of the input network is a significant source of bias for GNNs. Nevertheless, no studies have systematically scrutinized which part of the input network structure leads to biased predictions for any given node. The low transparency on how the structure of the input network influences the bias in GNN outcome largely limits the safe adoption of GNNs in various decision-critical scenarios. In this paper, we study a novel research problem of structural explanation of bias in GNNs. Specifically, we propose a novel post-hoc explanation framework to identify two edge sets that can maximally account for the exhibited bias and maximally contribute to the fairness level of the GNN prediction for any given node, respectively. Such explanations not only provide a comprehensive understanding of bias/fairness of GNN predictions but also have practical significance in building an effective yet fair GNN model. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework towards delivering effective structural explanations for the bias of GNNs.

There are two important reasoning tasks on KGs: (1) single-hop knowledge graph completion, which involves predicting individual links in the KG; and (2), multi-hop reasoning, where the goal is to predict which KG entities satisfy a given logical query. Embedding-based methods solve both tasks by first computing an embedding for each entity and relation, then using them to form predictions. However, existing scalable KG embedding frameworks only support single-hop knowledge graph completion and cannot be applied to the more challenging multi-hop reasoning task. Here we present Scalable Multi-hOp REasoning (SMORE), the first general framework for both single-hop and multi-hop reasoning in KGs. Using a single machine SMORE can perform multi-hop reasoning in Freebase KG (86M entities, 338M edges), which is 1,500x larger than previously considered KGs. The key to SMORE's runtime performance is a novel bidirectional rejection sampling that achieves a square root reduction of the complexity of online training data generation. Furthermore, SMORE exploits asynchronous scheduling, overlapping CPU-based data sampling, GPU-based embedding computation, and frequent CPU--GPU IO. SMORE increases throughput (i.e., training speed) over prior multi-hop KG frameworks by 2.2x with minimal GPU memory requirements (2GB for training 400-dim embeddings on 86M-node Freebase) and achieves near linear speed-up with the number of GPUs. Moreover, on the simpler single-hop knowledge graph completion task SMORE achieves comparable or even better runtime performance to state-of-the-art frameworks on both single GPU and multi-GPU settings.|知识图谱（KGs）以头实体-关系-尾实体的三元组形式捕获知识，是众多人工智能系统的核心组件。知识图谱上存在两项重要推理任务：（1）单跳知识图谱补全，涉及预测知识图谱中的独立链接；（2）多跳推理，旨在预测哪些知识图谱实体能满足给定的逻辑查询。基于嵌入的方法通过先计算每个实体和关系的嵌入表示，再利用这些嵌入进行预测来解决这两类任务。然而，现有可扩展的知识图谱嵌入框架仅支持单跳知识图谱补全，无法应用于更具挑战性的多跳推理任务。本文提出可扩展多跳推理框架（SMORE），这是首个同时支持知识图谱单跳与多跳推理的通用框架。在单机环境下，SMORE可在包含8600万个实体、3.38亿条边的Freebase知识图谱上完成多跳推理，其规模是先前处理图谱的1500倍。SMORE实现高效运行的关键在于采用了一种新颖的双向拒绝采样技术，将在线训练数据生成的复杂度降低至平方根级别。此外，该框架通过异步调度机制，实现了基于CPU的数据采样、基于GPU的嵌入计算以及频繁的CPU-GPU输入输出操作三者重叠并行。相比现有多跳知识图谱框架，SMORE在仅需极小GPU内存（在8600万节点的Freebase上训练400维嵌入仅需2GB）的前提下，将吞吐量（即训练速度）提升2.2倍，并随GPU数量增加实现近线性加速。而在更简单的单跳知识图谱补全任务中，SMORE在单GPU与多GPU环境下均达到甚至超越了最先进框架的运行时性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=SMORE:+Knowledge+Graph+Completion+and+Multi-hop+Reasoning+in+Massive+Knowledge+Graphs)|4|

Although some work has developed fair GNNs, most of them directly borrow fair representation learning techniques from non-graph domains without considering the potential problem of sensitive attribute leakage caused by feature propagation in GNNs. However, we empirically observe that feature propagation could vary the correlation of previously innocuous non-sensitive features to the sensitive ones. This can be viewed as a leakage of sensitive information which could further exacerbate discrimination in predictions. Thus, we design two feature masking strategies according to feature correlations to highlight the importance of considering feature propagation and correlation variation in alleviating discrimination. Motivated by our analysis, we propose Fair View Graph Neural Network (FairVGNN) to generate fair views of features by automatically identifying and masking sensitive-correlated features considering correlation variation after feature propagation. Given the learned fair views, we adaptively clamp weights of the encoder to avoid using sensitive-related features. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that FairVGNN enjoys a better trade-off between model utility and fairness.

|[Deconfounding Duration Bias in Watch-time Prediction for Video Recommendation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539092)|Ruohan Zhan, Changhua Pei, Qiang Su, Jianfeng Wen, Xueliang Wang, Guanyu Mu, Dong Zheng, Peng Jiang, Kun Gai|Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; Unaffiliated, Beijing, China; Kuaishou Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China|Watch-time prediction remains to be a key factor in reinforcing user engagement via video recommendations. It has become increasingly important given the ever-growing popularity of online videos. However, prediction of watch time not only depends on the match between the user and the video but is often mislead by the duration of the video itself. With the goal of improving watch time, recommendation is always biased towards videos with long duration. Models trained on this imbalanced data face the risk of bias amplification, which misguides platforms to over-recommend videos with long duration but overlook the underlying user interests. This paper presents the first work to study duration bias in watch-time prediction for video recommendation. We employ a causal graph illuminating that duration is a confounding factor that concurrently affects video exposure and watch-time prediction---the first effect on video causes the bias issue and should be eliminated, while the second effect on watch time originates from video intrinsic characteristics and should be preserved. To remove the undesired bias but leverage the natural effect, we propose a Duration-Deconfounded Quantile-based (D2Q) watch-time prediction framework, which allows for scalability to perform on industry production systems. Through extensive offline evaluation and live experiments, we showcase the effectiveness of this duration-deconfounding framework by significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art baselines. We have fully launched our approach on Kuaishou App, which has substantially improved real-time video consumption due to more accurate watch-time predictions.|观看时长预测始终是通过视频推荐增强用户参与度的关键因素。随着在线视频的日益普及，其重要性愈发凸显。然而观看时长的预测不仅取决于用户与视频的匹配度，还经常受到视频时长这一误导性因素影响。为提升观看时长，推荐系统往往会偏向长视频，基于这种不平衡数据训练的模型面临偏差放大的风险——这会导致平台过度推荐长视频，却忽视了用户深层次兴趣。本文首次系统研究视频推荐中观看时长预测的时长偏差问题。我们通过因果图论证发现：时长是同时影响视频曝光和观看时长的混杂因素——前者会导致偏差问题需被消除，而后者源于视频固有特性应予以保留。为消除不良偏差同时保留自然效应，我们提出基于时长去混杂分位数（D2Q）的观看时长预测框架，该框架具备在工业级系统实现规模化部署的能力。通过大量离线评估和线上实验证明，本去混杂框架显著优于现有最优基线模型。该方案已在快手APP全面上线，凭借更精准的观看时长预测有效提升了实时视频消费体验。

To perform efficient online inference, representation quantization, aiming to embed the latent features by a compact sequence of discrete numbers, recently shows the promising potentiality in optimizing both memory and computation overheads. However, existing work merely focuses on numerical quantization whilst ignoring the concomitant information loss issue, which, consequently, leads to conspicuous performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel quantization framework to learn Binarized Graph Representations for Top-K Recommendation (BiGeaR). We introduce multi-faceted quantization reinforcement at the pre-, mid-, and post-stage of binarized representation learning, which substantially retains the informativeness against embedding binarization. In addition to saving the memory footprint, it further develops solid online inference acceleration with bitwise operations, providing alternative flexibility for the realistic deployment. The empirical results over five large real-world benchmarks show that BiGeaR achieves about 22%~40% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art quantization-based recommender system, and recovers about 95%~102% of the performance capability of the best full-precision counterpart with over 8× time and space reduction.|学习向量化嵌入是各类用户-物品匹配推荐系统的核心。为实现高效在线推理，表征量化技术通过将隐特征嵌入为紧凑的离散数值序列，在优化内存和计算开销方面展现出巨大潜力。然而现有研究仅聚焦数值量化，却忽视了伴随的信息损失问题，导致系统性能显著下降。本文提出一种新型量化框架BiGeaR，通过二值化图表示实现Top-K推荐。我们在二值化表征学习的前、中、后三阶段引入多层面量化增强机制，显著保留了嵌入二值化过程中的信息完整性。该方案在节省内存占用的同时，进一步通过位运算实现实时的在线推理加速，为实际部署提供灵活选择。在五个大型真实场景基准测试中，BiGeaR相比最先进的量化推荐系统性能提升约22%~40%，并以超过8倍的时间空间压缩比，恢复最佳全精度对比模型约95%~102%的性能表现。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Learning+Binarized+Graph+Representations+with+Multi-faceted+Quantization+Reinforcement+for+Top-K+Recommendation)|3|

Generally, this requires blocking the effect of confounders that simultaneously affect the recommendation and feedback. To mitigate the confounding bias, a strategy is incorporating propensity into model learning. However, existing methods forgo possible unmeasured confounders (e.g., user financial status), which can result in biased propensities and hurt recommendation performance. This work combats the risk of unmeasured confounders in recommender systems. Towards this end, we propose Robust Deconfounder (RD) that accounts for the effect of unmeasured confounders on propensities, under the mild assumption that the effect is bounded. It estimates the bound with sensitivity analysis, learning a recommender model robust to unmeasured confounders within the bound by adversarial learning. However, pursuing robustness within a bound may restrict model accuracy. To avoid the trade-off between robustness and accuracy, we further propose Benchmarked RD (BRD) that incorporates a pre-trained model into the learning as the benchmark. Theoretical analyses prove the stronger robustness of our methods compared to existing propensity-based deconfounders, and also prove the no-harm property of BRD. Our methods are applicable to any propensity-based estimators, where we select three representative ones: IPS, Doubly Robust, and AutoDebias. We conduct experiments on three real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.|推荐系统需回应干预性问题“若向用户推荐某项目，其反馈将如何”，这要求估算推荐行为对用户反馈的因果效应。通常需要阻断同时影响推荐结果和用户反馈的混杂因子干扰。为减轻混杂偏差，现有策略将倾向性评分纳入模型学习，但这类方法忽略了潜在未测混杂因子（如用户财务状况）的影响，可能导致倾向性估计偏差并损害推荐性能。本研究致力于应对推荐系统中未测混杂因子带来的风险。为此，我们提出鲁棒去混杂（RD）方法，在"未测混杂因子对倾向性的影响有界"这一温和假设下，量化未测混杂因子对倾向评分的影响。该方法通过敏感性分析估计影响边界，并采用对抗学习训练出在边界内对未测混杂因子具有鲁棒性的推荐模型。然而追求边界内的鲁棒性可能限制模型精度，为避免鲁棒性与精度的权衡，我们进一步提出基准化RD（BRD）方法，将预训练模型作为基准融入学习过程。理论分析证明：相比现有基于倾向性评分的去混杂方法，我们提出的方法具有更强鲁棒性，同时证明了BRD的"无损"特性。我们的方法适用于所有基于倾向性评分的估计器，本文选取三种代表性方法：逆概率加权、双稳健估计和AutoDebias。通过在三个真实数据集上的实验，验证了所提方法的有效性。

One typical feature is that a class is often related to other classes in different semantic aspects.

We also contribute a new ZSL framework named DOZSL, which contains two new ZSL solutions based on generative models and graph propagation models, respectively, for effectively utilizing the disentangled ontology embeddings.

Many studies take into account the interaction between every pair of features. However, this is suboptimal because some feature interactions may not be that relevant to the recommendation result, and taking them into account may introduce noise and decrease recommendation accuracy. To make the best out of feature interactions, we propose a graph neural network approach to effectively model them, together with a novel technique to automatically detect those feature interactions that are beneficial in terms of recommendation accuracy. The automatic feature interaction detection is achieved via edge prediction with an L0 activation regularization. Our proposed model is proved to be effective through the information bottleneck principle and statistical interaction theory.

In this paper, we propose an adaptive feature selection framework, AdaFS, for deep recommender systems. To be specific, we develop a novel controller network to automatically select the most relevant features from the whole feature space, which fits the dynamic recommendation environment better. Besides, different from classic feature selection approaches, the proposed controller can adaptively score each example of user-item interactions, and identify the most informative features correspondingly for subsequent recommendation tasks.

Embedding-based approaches have dominated the EA task in recent years. Those methods face problems that come from the geometric properties of embedding vectors, including hubness and isolation. To solve these geometric problems, many normalization approaches have been adopted for EA. However, the increasing scale of KGs renders it hard for EA models to adopt the normalization processes, thus limiting their usage in real-world applications. To tackle this challenge, we present ClusterEA, a general framework that is capable of scaling up EA models and enhancing their results by leveraging normalization methods on mini-batches with a high entity equivalent rate. ClusterEA contains three components to align entities between large-scale KGs, including stochastic training, ClusterSampler, and SparseFusion. It first trains a large-scale Siamese GNN for EA in a stochastic fashion to produce entity embeddings. Based on the embeddings, a novel ClusterSampler strategy is proposed for sampling highly overlapped mini-batches. Finally, ClusterEA incorporates SparseFusion, which normalizes local and global similarity and then fuses all similarity matrices to obtain the final similarity matrix. Extensive experiments with real-life datasets on EA benchmarks offer insight into the proposed framework, and suggest that it is capable of outperforming the state-of-the-art scalable EA framework by up to 8 times in terms of Hits@1.|实体对齐（EA）旨在发现不同知识图谱（KG）中的等价实体。近年来，基于嵌入的方法在该任务中占据主导地位，但这些方法面临嵌入向量几何特性带来的问题，包括枢纽性和孤立性。为解决这些几何问题，多种归一化方法被应用于实体对齐。然而，知识图谱规模的持续增长使对齐模型难以实施归一化处理，限制了其在实际应用中的效果。为应对这一挑战，我们提出ClusterEA通用框架，该框架通过在具有高实体等价率的微型批处理中应用归一化方法，既能扩展对齐模型规模又能提升其结果质量。ClusterEA包含三个核心组件：随机训练、聚类采样器（ClusterSampler）和稀疏融合（SparseFusion）。该框架首先通过随机方式训练大规模孪生图神经网络生成实体嵌入表示，基于这些嵌入向量提出创新的ClusterSampler策略来采样高重叠度的微型批处理数据，最后通过SparseFusion组件对局部与全局相似度进行归一化处理，并融合所有相似度矩阵得到最终对齐结果。在实体对齐基准上的真实数据集实验表明，该框架在Hits@1指标上最高可超越现有可扩展对齐框架达8倍性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=ClusterEA:+Scalable+Entity+Alignment+with+Stochastic+Training+and+Normalized+Mini-batch+Similarities)|3|

Hence it is usually crucial to identify diffusion sources according to the current graph diffusion observations. Despite its tremendous necessity and significance in practice, source localization, as the inverse problem of graph diffusion, is extremely challenging as it is ill-posed: different sources may lead to the same graph diffusion patterns. Different from most traditional source localization methods, this paper focuses on a probabilistic manner to account for the uncertainty of different candidate sources. Such endeavors require to overcome significant challenges along the way including: 1) the uncertainty in graph diffusion source localization is hard to be quantified; 2) the complex patterns of the graph diffusion sources are difficult to be probabilistically characterized; 3) the generalization under any underlying diffusion patterns is hard to be imposed. To solve the above challenges, this paper presents a generic framework: Source Localization Variational AutoEncoder (SL-VAE) for locating the diffusion sources under arbitrary diffusion patterns. Particularly, we propose a probabilistic model that leverages the forward diffusion estimation model along with deep generative models to approximate the diffusion source distribution for quantifying the uncertainty. SL-VAE further utilizes prior knowledge of the source-observation pairs to characterize the complex patterns of diffusion sources by a learned generative prior. Lastly, a unified objective that integrates the forward diffusion estimation model is derived to enforce the model to generalize under arbitrary diffusion patterns. Extensive experiments are conducted on $7$ real-world datasets to demonstrate the superiority of SL-VAE in reconstructing the diffusion sources by excelling the state-of-the-arts on average 20% in AUC score. The code and data are available at: https://github.com/triplej0079/SLVAE.|图扩散问题（如谣言传播、计算机病毒蔓延或智能电网故障）普遍存在且具有广泛社会影响。因此，根据当前图扩散观测结果定位扩散源通常至关重要。尽管源定位作为图扩散逆问题在实践中具有巨大需求和重要性，但由于其不适定性——不同源可能产生相同的扩散模式——这一问题极具挑战性。与大多数传统源定位方法不同，本文采用概率化方法来解决不同候选源的不确定性。这一研究需要克服三大核心挑战：1）图扩散源定位中的不确定性难以量化；2）图扩散源的复杂模式难以进行概率化表征；3）任意潜在扩散模式下的泛化能力难以实现。

为解决上述挑战，本文提出通用框架SL-VAE（源定位变分自编码器），用于在任意扩散模式下定位扩散源。具体而言，我们构建了一个概率模型，通过结合前向扩散估计模型与深度生成模型，近似扩散源分布以量化不确定性。SL-VAE进一步利用源-观测对的先验知识，通过学习的生成先验来表征扩散源的复杂模式。最后，本文推导出整合前向扩散估计模型的统一目标函数，强制模型在任意扩散模式下实现泛化。

|[GBPNet: Universal Geometric Representation Learning on Protein Structures](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539441)|Sarp Aykent, Tian Xia|Auburn University, Auburn, AL, USA|Representation learning of protein 3D structures is challenging and essential for applications, e.g., computational protein design or protein engineering. Recently, geometric deep learning has achieved great success in non-Euclidean domains. Although protein can be represented as a graph naturally, it remains under-explored mainly due to the significant challenges in modeling the complex representations and capturing the inherent correlation in the 3D structure modeling. Several challenges include: 1) It is challenging to extract and preserve multi-level rotation and translation equivariant information during learning. 2) Difficulty in developing appropriate tools to effectively leverage the input spatial representations to capture complex geometries across the spatial dimension. 3) Difficulty in incorporating various geometric features and preserving the inherent structural relations. In this work, we introduce geometric bottleneck perceptron, and a general SO(3)-equivariant message passing neural network built on top of it for protein structure representation learning. The proposed geometric bottleneck perceptron can be incorporated into diverse network architecture backbones to process geometric data in different domains. This research shed new light on geometric deep learning in 3D structure studies. Empirically, we demonstrate the strength of our proposed approach on three core downstream tasks, where our model achieves significant improvements and outperforms existing benchmarks. The implementation is available at https://github.com/sarpaykent/GBPNet.|蛋白质三维结构的表示学习是具有挑战性和必要的应用，例如，计算蛋白质设计或蛋白质工程。近年来，几何深度学习在非欧几里德领域取得了巨大的成功。虽然蛋白质可以自然地表示为一个图形，但是它仍然没有得到充分的开发，主要是由于在建模复杂的表示和捕获三维结构建模中的内在关联方面的重大挑战。这些挑战包括: 1)在学习过程中提取和保存多层次旋转和翻译等变信息是一个挑战。2)难以开发合适的工具来有效地利用输入空间表示来捕获跨空间维度的复杂几何图形。3)难以结合各种几何特征和保持固有的结构关系。本文介绍了几何瓶颈感知器，并在此基础上构建了一个通用的 SO (3)等变信息传递神经网络，用于蛋白质结构表示学习。提出的几何瓶颈感知器可以整合到不同的网络结构骨架中，用于处理不同领域的几何数据。本研究为三维结构研究中的几何深度学习提供了新的思路。实际上，我们在三个核心的下游任务中展示了我们提议的方法的优势，在这些任务中，我们的模型实现了显著的改进，并优于现有的基准测试。有关实施方案可于 https://github.com/sarpaykent/gbpnet 索取。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=GBPNet:+Universal+Geometric+Representation+Learning+on+Protein+Structures)|3|

However, recent studies highlight the importance of higher-order network analysis, where complex structures called motifs are the first-class citizens. We first show that existing link prediction schemes fail to effectively predict motifs. To alleviate this, we establish a general motif prediction problem and we propose several heuristics that assess the chances for a specified motif to appear. To make the scores realistic, our heuristics consider - among others - correlations between links, i.e., the potential impact of some arriving links on the appearance of other links in a given motif. Finally, for highest accuracy, we develop a graph neural network (GNN) architecture for motif prediction. Our architecture offers vertex features and sampling schemes that capture the rich structural properties of motifs. While our heuristics are fast and do not need any training, GNNs ensure highest accuracy of predicting motifs, both for dense (e.g., k-cliques) and for sparse ones (e.g., k-stars). We consistently outperform the best available competitor by more than 10% on average and up to 32% in area under the curve. Importantly, the advantages of our approach over schemes based on uncorrelated link prediction increase with the increasing motif size and complexity. We also successfully apply our architecture for predicting more arbitrary clusters and communities, illustrating its potential for graph mining beyond motif analysis.|链接预测是图挖掘的核心问题之一。然而，最近的研究强调了高阶网络分析的重要性，在这种网络分析中，被称为图案的复杂结构是一等公民。我们首先证明了现有的链路预测方案不能有效地预测图案。为了解决这个问题，我们建立了一个通用的主题预测问题，并提出了几种启发式算法来评估特定主题出现的可能性。为了使得分数更加真实，我们的启发式方法考虑了链接之间的相关性，也就是说，一些到达的链接对给定主题中其他链接的外观的潜在影响。最后，为了获得最高的精度，我们开发了一个图形神经网络(GNN)结构用于模体预测。我们的体系结构提供了顶点特征和抽样方案，这些特征和抽样方案捕获了图案丰富的结构属性。虽然我们的启发式算法是快速的，不需要任何训练，GNN 确保预测图案的最高准确性，无论是对于密集的(例如，k- 团)和稀疏的(例如，k- 星)。我们始终超越最好的竞争对手超过10% 的平均水平和高达32% 的面积下的曲线。重要的是，与基于不相关链路预测的方案相比，我们的方法的优势随着基序大小和复杂度的增加而增加。我们还成功地应用了我们的体系结构来预测更多的任意集群和社区，说明了它在图形挖掘方面的潜力超越了主题分析。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Motif+Prediction+with+Graph+Neural+Networks)|3|

Yu|Univ Illinois, Chicago, IL USA; Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; South China Agr Univ, Guangzhou, Peoples R China|Multi-view subspace clustering targets at clustering data lying in a union of low-dimensional subspaces. Generally, an n X n affinity graph is constructed, on which spectral clustering is then performed to achieve the final clustering. Both graph construction and graph partitioning of spectral clustering suffer from quadratic or even cubic time and space complexity, leading to difficulty in clustering large-scale datasets. Some efforts have recently been made to capture data distribution in multiple views by selecting key anchor bases beforehand with k-means or uniform sampling strategy. Nevertheless, few of them pay attention to the algebraic property of the anchors. How to learn a set of high-quality orthogonal bases in a unified framework, while maintaining its scalability for very large datasets, remains a big challenge. In view of this, we propose an Efficient Orthogonal Multi-view Subspace Clustering (OMSC) model with almost linear complexity. Specifically, the anchor learning, graph construction and partition are jointly modeled in a unified framework. With the mutual enhancement of each other, a more discriminative and flexible anchor representation and cluster indicator can be jointly obtained. An alternate minimizing strategy is developed to deal with the optimization problem, which is proved to have linear time complexity w.r.t. the sample number. Extensive experiments have been conducted to confirm the superiority of the proposed OMSC method.

However, such metrics are heuristically built as an aggregate of multiple desirable aspects, introduce parameters and wipe out the interpretability of the output. In this article, we first highlight the limitations of the classical precision/recall, as well as the main issues of the recent event-based metrics -- for instance, we show that an adversary algorithm can reach high precision and recall on almost any dataset under weak assumption. To cope with the above problems, we propose a theoretically grounded, robust, parameter-free and interpretable extension to precision/recall metrics, based on the concept of ``affiliation'' between the ground truth and the prediction sets. Our metrics leverage measures of duration between ground truth and predictions, and have thus an intuitive interpretation. By further comparison against random sampling, we obtain a normalized precision/recall, quantifying how much a given set of results is better than a random baseline prediction. By construction, our approach keeps the evaluation local regarding ground truth events, enabling fine-grained visualization and interpretation of algorithmic results. We compare our proposal against various public time series anomaly detection datasets, algorithms and metrics. We further derive theoretical properties of the affiliation metrics that give explicit expectations about their behavior and ensure robustness against adversary strategies.|近年来，为克服经典精确率与召回率的局限性，时间序列异常检测领域发展出特定评估指标。然而此类指标通过启发式方法将多个理想特性聚合而成，不仅引入参数还削弱了输出结果的可解释性。本文首先指出现有基于事件评估指标的主要问题及经典精确率/召回率的局限性——例如我们证明在弱假设条件下，对抗算法几乎可在任何数据集上获得高精确率与召回率。针对上述问题，我们基于真实标签与预测集之间的"从属关系"概念，提出一种具有理论支撑、鲁棒性强、无参数且可解释的精确率/召回率扩展指标。该指标通过衡量真实事件与预测事件之间的持续时间关系，具备直观的解释性。通过与随机采样结果对比，我们进一步获得标准化精确率/召回率，可量化评估结果相对于随机基线预测的优越程度。该方法在构建时保持针对真实事件的局部评估特性，支持算法结果的精细化可视化与解读。我们将所提指标与多种公开时间序列异常检测数据集、算法及评估指标进行对比验证，并推导出从属度量的理论特性，明确揭示其行为特征，确保对对抗策略的鲁棒性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Local+Evaluation+of+Time+Series+Anomaly+Detection+Algorithms)|3|

Despite the success, oversmoothing has been identified as one of the key issues which limit the performance of deep GNNs. It indicates that the learned node representations are highly indistinguishable due to the stacked aggregators. In this paper, we propose a new perspective to look at the performance degradation of deep GNNs, i.e., feature overcorrelation. Through empirical and theoretical study on this matter, we demonstrate the existence of feature overcorrelation in deeper GNNs and reveal potential reasons leading to this issue. To reduce the feature correlation, we propose a general framework DeCorr which can encourage GNNs to encode less redundant information.

To address this, we present a novel token reduction method dubbed Learned Token Pruning (LTP) which adaptively removes unimportant tokens as an input sequence passes through transformer layers. In particular, LTP prunes tokens with an attention score below a threshold, whose value is learned for each layer during training. Our threshold-based method allows the length of the pruned sequence to vary adaptively based on the input sequence, and avoids algorithmically expensive operations such as top-k token selection. We extensively test the performance of LTP on GLUE and SQuAD tasks and show that our method outperforms the prior state-of-the-art token pruning methods by up to ∽2.5% higher accuracy with the same amount of FLOPs. In particular, LTP achieves up to 2.1× FLOPs reduction with less than 1% accuracy drop, which results in up to 1.9× and 2.0× throughput improvement on Intel Haswell CPUs and NVIDIA V100 GPUs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that LTP is more robust than prior methods to variations in input sequence lengths. Our code has been developed in PyTorch and open-sourced|实践中，由于Transformer模型存在内存占用、延迟和功耗等推理成本问题，且这些成本随输入序列长度呈二次方增长，其高效部署面临巨大挑战。为此，我们提出了一种名为"学习型令牌剪枝"（LTP）的新型令牌缩减方法，该方法能在输入序列通过Transformer层时自适应地移除不重要令牌。具体而言，LTP会剪除注意力分数低于动态阈值的令牌——该阈值在训练过程中为每一层单独学习得到。这种基于阈值的方法使剪枝后的序列长度能根据输入序列自适应调整，同时避免了计算成本较高的操作（如Top-K令牌选择）。我们在GLUE和SQuAD任务上对LTP进行了全面测试，结果表明：在相同FLOPs条件下，本方法比现有最优令牌剪枝技术的准确率最高提升约2.5%。特别值得注意的是，LTP在准确率下降不足1%的情况下实现了最高2.1倍的FLOPs缩减，这使得在Intel Haswell CPU和NVIDIA V100 GPU上的吞吐量分别提升至1.9倍和2.0倍。此外，我们还证明LTP相比现有方法对输入序列长度变化具有更强适应性。相关代码已基于PyTorch实现并开源。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Learned+Token+Pruning+for+Transformers)|3|

Recently, due to the scarcity of labeled molecules, self-supervised learning methods for learning generalizable and transferable representations of molecular graphs have attracted lots of attention. In this paper, we argue that there exist two major issues hindering current self-supervised learning methods from obtaining desired performance on molecular property prediction, that is, the ill-defined pre-training tasks and the limited model capacity. To this end, we introduce Knowledge-guided Pre-training of Graph Transformer (KPGT), a novel self-supervised learning framework for molecular graph representation learning, to alleviate the aforementioned issues and improve the performance on the downstream molecular property prediction tasks. More specifically, we first introduce a high-capacity model, named Line Graph Transformer (LiGhT), which emphasizes the importance of chemical bonds and is mainly designed to model the structural information of molecular graphs. Then, a knowledge-guided pre-training strategy is proposed to exploit the additional knowledge of molecules to guide the model to capture the abundant structural and semantic information from large-scale unlabeled molecular graphs. Extensive computational tests demonstrated that KPGT can offer superior performance over current state-of-the-art methods on several molecular property prediction tasks.|设计精确的分子性质预测深度学习模型在药物和材料发现领域扮演着日益重要的角色。当前由于标记分子数据稀缺，能够学习可泛化、可迁移分子图表示的自监督学习方法受到广泛关注。本文指出当前自监督学习方法在分子性质预测中面临两大核心问题：预训练任务定义不明确以及模型容量有限。为此，我们提出知识引导的图Transformer预训练框架（KPGT），这一新型自监督学习框架通过缓解上述问题来提升下游分子性质预测任务的性能。具体而言，我们首先设计了高容量模型——线图Transformer（LiGhT），该模型强调化学键的重要性，主要用于建模分子图的结构信息；随后提出知识引导的预训练策略，利用分子附加知识指导模型从大规模未标记分子图中捕获丰富的结构与语义信息。大量计算实验表明，KPGT在多个分子性质预测任务上均能超越现有最先进方法的性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=KPGT:+Knowledge-Guided+Pre-training+of+Graph+Transformer+for+Molecular+Property+Prediction)|3|

Hecht, Jaime Teevan|Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; Microsoft, Redmond, WA USA|Hypergraphs provide an effective abstraction for modeling multi-way group interactions among nodes, where each hyperedge can connect any number of nodes. Different from most existing studies which leverage statistical dependencies , we study hypergraphs from the perspective of causality . Specifically, we focus on the problem of individual treatment effect (ITE) estimation on hypergraphs, aiming to estimate how much an intervention (e.g., wearing face covering) would causally affect an outcome (e.g., COVID-19 infection) of each individual node. Existing works on ITE estimation either assume that the outcome of one individual should not be influenced by the treatment of other individuals (i.e., no interference ), or assume the interference only exists between connected individuals in an ordinary graph. We argue that these assumptions can be unrealistic on real-world hypergraphs, where higher-order interference can affect the ITE estimations due to group interactions. We investigate high-order interference modeling, and propose a new causality learning framework powered by hypergraph neural networks. Extensive experiments on real-world hypergraphs verify the superiority of our framework over existing baselines|超图为建模节点间多元群体交互提供了有效抽象，其中每个超边可连接任意数量的节点。与现有大多数利用统计依赖性的研究不同，我们从因果关系的角度研究超图。具体而言，我们聚焦于超图上的个体处理效应（ITE）估计问题，旨在量化干预措施（如佩戴口罩）对每个个体节点结果（如新冠肺炎感染）的因果影响程度。现有ITE估计研究要么假设个体结果不应受其他个体处理措施影响（即无干扰假设），要么假定干扰仅存在于普通图的相连个体之间。我们认为这些假设在现实超图中可能不成立——由于群体交互作用，高阶干扰会影响ITE估计结果。我们深入研究了高阶干扰建模，并提出了一种基于超图神经网络的新型因果学习框架。在真实超图上的大量实验证实，该框架性能优于现有基线方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Learning+Causal+Effects+on+Hypergraphs)|3|

Recently, Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have become increasingly popular MTS forecasting methods. STGNNs jointly model the spatial and temporal patterns of MTS through graph neural networks and sequential models, significantly improving the prediction accuracy. But limited by model complexity, most STGNNs only consider short-term historical MTS data, such as data over the past one hour. However, the patterns of time series and the dependencies between them (i.e., the temporal and spatial patterns) need to be analyzed based on long-term historical MTS data. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, in which STGNN is Enhanced by a scalable time series Pre-training model (STEP). Specifically, we design a pre-training model to efficiently learn temporal patterns from very long-term history time series (e.g., the past two weeks) and generate segment-level representations. These representations provide contextual information for short-term time series input to STGNNs and facilitate modeling dependencies between time series. Experiments on three public real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework is capable of significantly enhancing downstream STGNNs, and our pre-training model aptly captures temporal patterns.|多元时间序列预测在众多应用场景中具有重要作用。近年来，时空图神经网络已成为日益流行的MTS预测方法。该方法通过图神经网络与序列模型共同建模MTS的时空模式，显著提升了预测精度。但受模型复杂度限制，现有STGNN大多仅考虑短期历史MTS数据（如过去一小时的数据）。然而时间序列的规律及其相互依赖关系（即时序模式与空间模式）需要基于长期历史MTS数据进行分析。针对此问题，我们提出一种创新框架：通过可扩展时序预训练模型增强STGNN（STEP）。具体而言，我们设计了一个预训练模型，能够从超长期历史序列（如过去两周数据）中高效学习时序模式，并生成片段级表征。这些表征为STGNN输入的短期时间序列提供上下文信息，并助力建模时间序列间的依赖关系。在三个真实世界公开数据集上的实验表明，本框架能显著增强下游STGNN性能，且预训练模型可有效捕捉时序规律。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Pre-training+Enhanced+Spatial-temporal+Graph+Neural+Network+for+Multivariate+Time+Series+Forecasting)|3|

An effective solution is to apply the transfer learning in graph: using easily accessible information to pre-train GNNs, and fine-tuning them to optimize the downstream task with only a few labels. Recently, many efforts have been paid to design the self-supervised pretext tasks, and encode the universal graph knowledge among the various applications. However, they rarely notice the inherent training objective gap between the pretext and downstream tasks. This significant gap often requires costly fine-tuning for adapting the pre-trained model to downstream problem, which prevents the efficient elicitation of pre-trained knowledge and then results in poor results. Even worse, the naive pre-training strategy usually deteriorates the downstream task, and damages the reliability of transfer learning in graph data. To bridge the task gap, we propose a novel transfer learning paradigm to generalize GNNs, namely graph pre-training and prompt tuning (GPPT). Specifically, we first adopt the masked edge prediction, the most simplest and popular pretext task, to pre-train GNNs. Based on the pre-trained model, we propose the graph prompting function to modify the standalone node into a token pair, and reformulate the downstream node classification looking the same as edge prediction. The token pair is consisted of candidate label class and node entity. Therefore, the pre-trained GNNs could be applied without tedious fine-tuning to evaluate the linking probability of token pair, and produce the node classification decision. The extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of GPPT, delivering an average improvement of 4.29% in few-shot graph analysis and accelerating the model convergence up to 4.32X. The code is available in: https://github.com/MingChen-Sun/GPPT.|尽管图神经网络（GNN）在表示学习方面前景广阔，但其监督训练众所周知需要每个应用场景下的大量标注数据。一种有效的解决方案是在图数据中应用迁移学习：利用易获取的信息对GNN进行预训练，再通过少量标注数据微调以优化下游任务。近年来，研究者们投入大量精力设计自监督代理任务，以编码不同应用间的通用图知识。然而，这些方法很少关注代理任务与下游任务之间固有的训练目标差异。这种显著差异往往需要昂贵的微调成本使预训练模型适配下游问题，这不仅阻碍预训练知识的高效激发，还导致效果不佳。更严重的是，简单的预训练策略通常会恶化下游任务性能，损害图数据迁移学习的可靠性。为弥合任务差距，我们提出了一种新颖的图神经网络泛化迁移学习范式——图预训练与提示调优（GPPT）。具体而言，我们首先采用最简单流行的掩蔽边预测作为代理任务预训练GNN。基于预训练模型，我们提出图提示函数将独立节点转换为标记对，并将下游节点分类任务重构为与边预测相同的形式。该标记对由候选标签类和节点实体构成，使得预训练GNN无需繁琐微调即可评估标记对的连接概率，进而生成节点分类决策。在八个基准数据集上的大量实验证明了GPPT的优越性：在少样本图分析中平均提升4.29%，模型收敛速度最高加快4.32倍。代码已开源：https://github.com/MingChen-Sun/GPPT。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=GPPT:+Graph+Pre-training+and+Prompt+Tuning+to+Generalize+Graph+Neural+Networks)|3|

At Pinterest, we build a single set of product embeddings called ItemSage to provide relevant recommendations in all shopping use cases including user, image and search based recommendations. This approach has led to significant improvements in engagement and conversion metrics, while reducing both infrastructure and maintenance cost. While most prior work focuses on building product embeddings from features coming from a single modality, we introduce a transformer-based architecture capable of aggregating information from both text and image modalities and show that it significantly outperforms single modality baselines. We also utilize multi-task learning to make ItemSage optimized for several engagement types, leading to a candidate generation system that is efficient for all of the engagement objectives of the end-to-end recommendation system. Extensive offline experiments are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our approach and results from online A/B experiments show substantial gains in key business metrics (up to +7% gross merchandise value/user and +11% click volume).|产品学习嵌入是网络电子商务推荐系统的重要组成部分。在 Pinterest，我们构建了一套名为 ItemSage 的产品嵌入，在所有购物用例中提供相关推荐，包括用户、图片和基于搜索的推荐。这种方法显著改善了参与度和转换度量，同时降低了基础设施和维护成本。虽然大多数先前的工作集中于构建来自单一模式的特征的产品嵌入，但是我们引入了一个基于转换器的体系结构，该体系结构能够聚合来自文本和图像模式的信息，并表明它明显优于单一模式基线。我们还利用多任务学习来使 ItemSage 针对几种参与类型进行优化，从而产生一个对端到端推荐系统的所有参与目标都有效的候选人生成系统。为了说明我们的方法的有效性，我们进行了大量的离线实验，在线 A/B 实验的结果显示，在关键的商业指标方面取得了实质性的进展(高达7% 的商品总价值/用户和 + 11% 的点击量)。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=ItemSage:+Learning+Product+Embeddings+for+Shopping+Recommendations+at+Pinterest)|2|
|[Towards Unified Conversational Recommender Systems via Knowledge-Enhanced Prompt Learning](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539382)|Xiaolei Wang, Kun Zhou, JiRong Wen, Wayne Xin Zhao|Renmin University of China, Beijing, China|Conversational recommender systems (CRS) aim to proactively elicit user preference and recommend high-quality items through natural language conversations. Typically, a CRS consists of a recommendation module to predict preferred items for users and a conversation module to generate appropriate responses. To develop an effective CRS, it is essential to seamlessly integrate the two modules. Existing works either design semantic alignment strategies, or share knowledge resources and representations between the two modules. However, these approaches still rely on different architectures or techniques to develop the two modules, making it difficult for effective module integration. To address this problem, we propose a unified CRS model named UniCRS based on knowledge-enhanced prompt learning. Our approach unifies the recommendation and conversation subtasks into the prompt learning paradigm, and utilizes knowledge-enhanced prompts based on a fixed pre-trained language model (PLM) to fulfill both subtasks in a unified approach. In the prompt design, we include fused knowledge representations, task-specific soft tokens, and the dialogue context, which can provide sufficient contextual information to adapt the PLM for the CRS task. Besides, for the recommendation subtask, we also incorporate the generated response template as an important part of the prompt, to enhance the information interaction between the two subtasks. Extensive experiments on two public CRS datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach. Our code is publicly available at the link: https://github.com/RUCAIBox/UniCRS.|会话推荐系统(CRS)的目标是通过自然语言的对话主动地引导用户偏好，并推荐高质量的项目。通常，CRS 由一个推荐模块和一个会话模块组成，前者用于预测用户的首选项，后者用于生成适当的响应。为了开发一个有效的 CRS 系统，必须将这两个模块无缝地结合起来。现有的工作或者设计语义对齐策略，或者在两个模块之间共享知识资源和表示。然而，这些方法仍然依赖于不同的体系结构或技术来开发这两个模块，这使得有效的模块集成变得困难。针对这一问题，提出了一种基于知识增强的快速学习的统一 CRS 模型 UniCRS。该方法将推荐子任务和会话子任务统一到快速学习范式中，并利用基于固定预训练语言模型(PLM)的知识增强提示来统一实现推荐子任务和会话子任务。在快速设计中，我们包括融合知识表示、任务特定的软标记和对话上下文，它们可以提供足够的上下文信息来使 PLM 适应 CRS 任务。此外，对于推荐子任务，我们还将生成的响应模板作为提示的重要组成部分，以增强两个子任务之间的信息交互。在两个公共 CRS 数据集上的大量实验已经证明了我们方法的有效性。我们的代码可在以下 https://github.com/rucaibox/unicrs 公开获得:。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Towards+Unified+Conversational+Recommender+Systems+via+Knowledge-Enhanced+Prompt+Learning)|2|

Nevertheless, the cloud-based recommendation in the industry is still very important considering its powerful model capacity and the efficient candidate generation from the billion-scale item pool. Previous attempts to integrate the merits of both paradigms mainly resort to a sequential mechanism, which builds the on-device recommender on top of the cloud-based recommendation. However, such a design is inflexible when user interests dramatically change: the on-device model is stuck by the limited item cache while the cloud-based recommendation based on the large item pool do not respond without the new re-fresh feedback. To overcome this issue, we propose a meta controller to dynamically manage the collaboration between the on-device recommender and the cloud-based recommender, and introduce a novel efficient sample construction from the causal perspective to solve the dataset absence issue of meta controller. On the basis of the counterfactual samples and the extended training, extensive experiments in the industrial recommendation scenarios show the promise of meta controller in the device-cloud collaboration.|设备上的机器学习支持在本地客户机中轻量级部署推荐模型，这减轻了基于云的推荐模型的负担，同时包含了更多的实时用户特性。尽管如此，考虑到其强大的模型容量和从数十亿规模的项目库中有效地生成候选项，基于云的推荐在业界仍然非常重要。以前整合这两种模式优点的尝试主要依赖于一种顺序机制，这种机制在基于云的推荐之上构建设备上的推荐。然而，当用户的兴趣发生巨大变化时，这样的设计是不灵活的: 设备上的模型被有限的项目缓存卡住了，而基于大型项目池的基于云的推荐在没有新的更新反馈的情况下不会响应。针对这一问题，本文提出了一种元控制器来动态管理设备上的推荐器和基于云的推荐器之间的协作，并从因果关系的角度提出了一种新的有效的样本结构来解决元控制器数据集缺失的问题。在反事实样本和扩展训练的基础上，在工业推荐场景中的大量实验显示了元控制器在设备-云协作中的应用前景。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Device-cloud+Collaborative+Recommendation+via+Meta+Controller)|2|

However, they still suffer from the performance degradation in real scenarios, because various biases always occur in the generation process of user behaviors. Despite the recent development of addressing some specific type of bias, a variety of data bias, some of which are even unknown, are often mixed up in real applications. Although the uniform (or unbiased) data may help for the purpose of general debiasing, such data can either be hardly available or induce high experimental cost. In this paper, we consider a more practical setting where we aim to conduct general debiasing with the biased observational data alone. We assume that the observational user behaviors are determined by invariant preference (i.e. a user's true preference) and the variant preference (affected by some unobserved confounders). We propose a novel recommendation framework called InvPref which iteratively decomposes the invariant preference and variant preference from biased observational user behaviors by estimating heterogeneous environments corresponding to different types of latent bias.

Many disk failure prediction techniques have been developed to predict failures before they actually occur, allowing proactive steps to be taken to minimize service disruption and increase service reliability. Existing approaches for disk failure prediction do not differentiate among various types of disk failure. In industrial practice, however, different product teams treat distinct types of disk failures as different prediction tasks in large-scale online service systems like Microsoft 365. For example, hardware operation team is concerned with physical disk errors, while database service team focuses on I/O delay. In this paper, we propose MTHC (Multi-Task Hierarchical Classification) to enhance the performance of disk failure prediction for each task via multi-task learning. In addition, MTHC introduces a novel hierarchy-aware mechanism to deal with the data imbalance problem, which is a severe issue in the area of disk failure prediction. We show that MTHC can be easily utilized to enhance most state-of-the-art disk failure prediction models. Our experiments on both industrial and public datasets demonstrate that such disk failure prediction models enhanced by MTHC performs much better than those models working without MTHC. Furthermore, our experiments also present that the hierarchical-aware mechanism underlying MTHC can alleviate the data imbalance problem and thus improve the practical performance of various disk failure prediction models. More encouragingly, the proposed MTHC has been successfully applied to Microsoft 365 online service systems, and averagely reduces the number of virtual machine interruptions by 10% per month.|磁盘故障是威胁在线服务系统可靠性的最常见风险之一。为在故障实际发生前进行预警，业界已开发出多种磁盘故障预测技术，从而能够采取主动措施最大限度减少服务中断并提升系统可靠性。现有磁盘故障预测方法通常不对故障类型进行区分，但在微软365等大规模在线服务系统的工业实践中，不同产品团队会将不同类型的磁盘故障作为独立预测任务处理——例如硬件运营团队关注物理磁盘错误，而数据库服务团队则专注于I/O延迟问题。本文提出多任务分层分类框架(MTHC)，通过多任务学习提升各专项任务的磁盘故障预测性能。此外，MTHC创新性地引入层次感知机制以应对数据不平衡这一磁盘故障预测领域的核心难题。我们证明MTHC可轻松集成至现有主流磁盘故障预测模型中，基于工业数据集和公开数据集的实验表明：经MTHC增强的预测模型性能显著优于独立运作的基准模型。更值得注意的是，MTHC的层次感知机制能有效缓解数据不平衡问题，进而提升多种预测模型的实际性能。值得鼓舞的是，该框架已成功应用于微软365在线服务系统，平均每月减少10%的虚拟机中断事件。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Multi-task+Hierarchical+Classification+for+Disk+Failure+Prediction+in+Online+Service+Systems)|2|

Since the corpus is vast, achieving an efficient query-to-video search can be challenging. Because traditional approximate nearest neighborhood (ANN) search methods are based simple similarities (e.g., cosine or inner products) on embedding vectors. They are often not sufficient for bridging the modal gap between a text query and video advertisements and typically can only achieve sub-optimal performance in query-to-video search. Tree-based deep model (TDM) overcomes the limited matching capability of embedding-based methods but suffers from the data sparsity problem. Deep retrieval model adopts a graph-based model which overcomes the data sparsity problem in TDM by sharing the nodes. But the shared nodes entangle features of different items, making it difficult to distinguish similar items. In this work, we enhance the graph-based model through sub-path embedding to differentiate similar videos. The added sub-path embedding provides personalized characteristics, beneficial for modeling fine-grain details to discriminate similar items. After launching enhanced graph model (EGM), the click-through rate (CTR) relatively increases by 1.33%, and the conversion rate (CVR) relatively by 1.07%.|视频广告能迅速吸引用户注意力，因此备受广告主青睐。由于广告库规模庞大，实现高效的"查询-视频"搜索面临巨大挑战。传统近似最近邻（ANN）搜索方法仅基于嵌入向量的简单相似度度量（如余弦或内积），往往难以弥合文本查询与视频广告之间的模态差异，通常在查询-视频搜索中只能获得次优性能。基于树的深度模型（TDM）虽然克服了嵌入方法的匹配能力局限，却面临数据稀疏性问题。深度检索模型采用基于图的架构，通过共享节点克服了TDM的数据稀疏性问题，但共享节点会使不同商品的特征相互纠缠，导致相似商品难以区分。本研究通过引入子路径嵌入增强图模型，有效区分相似视频。新增的子路径嵌入提供个性化特征表征，有助于建模细粒度细节以区分相似商品。增强图模型（EGM）上线后，点击率（CTR）相对提升1.33%，转化率（CVR）相对提升1.07%。

While shallow multi-task learning can learn task relations, it can only handle pre-defined features. Modern deep multi-task learning can jointly learn latent features and task sharing, but they are obscure in task relation. Also, they pre-define which layers and neurons should share across tasks and cannot learn adaptively. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a new multi-task learning framework that jointly learns latent features and explicit task relations by complementing the strength of existing shallow and deep multitask learning scenarios. Specifically, we propose to model the task relation as the similarity between tasks' input gradients, with a theoretical analysis of their equivalency. In addition, we innovatively propose a multi-task learning objective that explicitly learns task relations by a new regularizer. Theoretical analysis shows that the generalizability error has been reduced thanks to the proposed regularizer. Extensive experiments on several multi-task learning and image classification benchmarks demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness, efficiency as well as reasonableness in the learned task relation patterns.|多任务学习(MTL)是一种强制多任务共享知识以提高其泛化能力的学习框架。浅层多任务学习虽然可以学习任务关系，但只能处理预定义的特征。现代深度多任务学习可以联合学习任务的潜在特征和任务共享，但在任务关系方面较为模糊。此外，他们预先定义了哪些层和神经元应该跨任务共享，而不能自适应地学习。针对这些挑战，本文提出了一种新的多任务学习框架，通过补充现有浅层和深层多任务学习场景的优势，联合学习潜在特征和显性任务关系。具体来说，我们提出将任务关系建模为任务输入梯度之间的相似性，并对其等效性进行了理论分析。此外，我们创新地提出了一个多任务学习目标，通过一个新的正则化器显式学习任务关系。理论分析表明，该正则化器可以减小泛化误差。通过对多个多任务学习和图像分类基准的大量实验，证明了该方法在学习任务关系模式方面的有效性、高效性和合理性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Saliency-Regularized+Deep+Multi-Task+Learning)|2|

Among diverse branches of personalization techniques, a model mixture-based personalization method is preferred as each client has their own personalized model as a result of federated learning. It usually requires a local model and a federated model, but this approach is either limited to partial parameter exchange or requires additional local updates, each of which is helpless to novel clients and burdensome to the client's computational capacity. As the existence of a connected subspace containing diverse low-loss solutions between two or more independent deep networks has been discovered, we combined this interesting property with the model mixture-based personalized federated learning method for improved performance of personalization.

Iyer, Yunsheng Bai, Wei Wang, Yizhou Sun|Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA|Two-view knowledge graphs (KGs) jointly represent two components: an ontology view for abstract and commonsense concepts, and an instance view for specific entities that are instantiated from ontological concepts. As such, these KGs contain heterogeneous structures that are hierarchical, from the ontology-view, and cyclical, from the instance-view. Despite these various structures in KGs, recent works on embedding KGs assume that the entire KG belongs to only one of the two views but not both simultaneously. For works that seek to put both views of the KG together, the instance and ontology views are assumed to belong to the same geometric space, such as all nodes embedded in the same Euclidean space or non-Euclidean product space, an assumption no longer reasonable for two-view KGs where different portions of the graph exhibit different structures. To address this issue, we define and construct a dual-geometric space embedding model (DGS) that models two-view KGs using a complex non-Euclidean geometric space, by embedding different portions of the KG in different geometric spaces. DGS utilizes the spherical space, hyperbolic space, and their intersecting space in a unified framework for learning embeddings. Furthermore, for the spherical space, we propose novel closed spherical space operators that directly decompose to using properties of the spherical space without the need for mapping to an approximate tangent space. Experiments on public datasets show that DGS significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baseline models on KG completion tasks, demonstrating its ability to better model heterogeneous structures in KGs.|双视角知识图谱（KG）联合表征了两个组成部分：用于抽象与常识概念的本体视角，以及用于从本体概念实例化的特定实体的实例视角。因此，这类知识图谱同时包含从本体视角呈现的层次化结构以及从实例视角呈现的循环化结构。尽管知识图谱存在这种结构异质性，现有图谱表示学习研究通常假定整个图谱仅属于单一视角，而非同时包含两种视角。在试图融合双视角的研究中，实例与本体视图往往被强制置于同一几何空间（如所有节点嵌入同一欧几里得空间或非欧几里得积空间），这一假设对于具有异构结构的双视角知识图谱已不再合理。为解决该问题，我们定义并构建了双几何空间嵌入模型（DGS），通过将图谱不同部分嵌入差异化几何空间，采用复杂的非欧几里得几何空间对双视角知识图谱进行建模。DGS创新性地将球面空间、双曲空间及其交集空间整合到统一框架中进行嵌入学习。针对球面空间，我们提出了新型封闭球面空间运算算子，可直接利用球面空间特性进行分解运算，无需映射至近似切空间。在公开数据集上的实验表明，DGS在知识图谱补全任务上显著优于现有最先进基线模型，证明了其更好地建模知识图谱异构结构的能力。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Dual-Geometric+Space+Embedding+Model+for+Two-View+Knowledge+Graphs)|2|

GitHub, as the largest platform, not only attracts developers and researchers to contribute legitimate software and research-related source code but has also become a popular platform for an increasing number of cybercriminals to perform continuous cyberattacks. Hence, some tools have been developed to learn representations of repositories on GitHub for various related applications (e.g., malicious repository detection) recently. However, most of them merely focus on code content while ignoring the rich relational data among repositories. In addition, they usually require a mass of resources to obtain sufficient labeled data for model training while ignoring the usefully handy unlabeled data. To this end, we propose a novel model Rep2Vec which integrates the code content, the structural relations, and the unlabeled data to learn the repository representations. First, to comprehensively model the repository data, we build a repository heterogeneous graph (Rep-HG) which is encoded by a graph neural network. Afterwards, to fully exploit unlabeled data in Rep-HG, we introduce adversarial attacks to generate more challenging contrastive pairs for the contrastive learning module to train the encoder in node view and meta-path view simultaneously. To alleviate the workload of the encoder against attacks, we further design a dual-stream contrastive learning module that integrates contrastive learning on adversarial graph and original graph together. Finally, the pre-trained encoder is fine-tuned to the downstream task, and further enhanced by a knowledge distillation module. Extensive experiments on the collected dataset from GitHub demonstrate the effectiveness of Rep2Vec in comparison with state-of-the-art methods for multiple repository tasks.|在软件数量指数级增长和基于拉取请求的开发系统Git兴起的推动下，各类社交编程平台上涌现出大量开源软件。作为最大平台的GitHub不仅吸引开发者和研究者贡献合法软件及研究相关源代码，也日益成为网络犯罪分子实施持续网络攻击的流行平台。为此，近期已开发出一些工具来学习GitHub代码库的表征，以支持恶意代码库检测等相关应用。然而现有方法大多仅关注代码内容而忽略代码库间丰富的关联数据，且通常需要大量资源获取标注数据进行模型训练，却未有效利用易于获取的未标注数据。

针对上述问题，我们提出新型模型Rep2Vec，通过融合代码内容、结构关系和未标注数据来学习代码库表征。首先构建代码库异质图(Rep-HG)全面建模代码库数据，并采用图神经网络进行编码。随后为充分利用未标注数据，引入对抗攻击生成更具挑战性的对比样本对，使对比学习模块能同时在节点视图和元路径视图训练编码器。为减轻编码器对抗攻击的负担，进一步设计双流对比学习模块，将对抗图和原始图的对比学习进行整合。最终通过下游任务对预训练编码器进行微调，并采用知识蒸馏模块增强性能。在从GitHub采集的数据集上进行大量实验表明，Rep2Vec在多项代码库任务上相比最先进方法具有显著优势。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Rep2Vec:+Repository+Embedding+via+Heterogeneous+Graph+Adversarial+Contrastive+Learning)|2|
|[Multi-Agent Graph Convolutional Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Electric Vehicle Charging Pricing](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539416)|Weijia Zhang, Hao Liu, Jindong Han, Yong Ge, Hui Xiong|HKUST GZ, AIT, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; Univ Arizona, Tucson, AZ USA|Electric Vehicles (EVs) have been emerging as a promising low-carbon transport target. While a large number of public charging stations are available, the use of these stations is often imbalanced, causing many problems to Charging Station Operators (CSOs). To this end, in this paper, we propose a Multi-Agent Graph Convolutional Reinforcement Learning (MAGC) framework to enable CSOs to achieve more effective use of these stations by providing dynamic pricing for each of the continuously arising charging requests with optimizing multiple long-term commercial goals. Specifically, we first formulate this charging station request-specific dynamic pricing problem as a mixed competitive-cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning task, where each charging station is regarded as an agent. Moreover, by modeling the whole charging market as a dynamic heterogeneous graph, we devise a multi-view heterogeneous graph attention networks to integrate complex interplay between agents induced by their diversified relationships. Then, we propose a shared meta generator to generate individual customized dynamic pricing policies for large-scale yet diverse agents based on the extracted meta characteristics. Finally, we design a contrastive heterogeneous graph pooling representation module to learn a condensed yet effective state action representation to facilitate policy learning of large-scale agents. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MAGC and empirically show that the overall use of stations can be improved if all the charging stations in a charging market embrace our dynamic pricing policy.|电动汽车（EV）已成为前景广阔的低碳交通目标。尽管现有大量公共充电站，但这些站点使用率往往不均衡，给充电站运营商（CSO）带来诸多问题。为此，本文提出多智能体图卷积强化学习（MAGC）框架，通过为持续产生的充电请求提供动态定价并优化多个长期商业目标，助力充电站运营商实现更高效的资源利用。具体而言：首先将充电站请求特异性动态定价问题构建为混合竞争-协作型多智能体强化学习任务，每个充电站被视为独立智能体；进而通过将整个充电市场建模为动态异构图，设计多视角异构图注意力网络以整合智能体间因多元化关系产生的复杂交互；随后提出共享元生成器，基于提取的元特征为大规模异构智能体生成个性化动态定价策略；最后设计对比式异构图池化表征模块，学习压缩但有效的状态动作表征以促进大规模智能体的策略学习。在两个真实场景数据集上的大量实验验证了MAGC的有效性，并实证表明当充电市场内所有充电站均采用本动态定价策略时，整体站点利用率可获得提升。

|[Learning Backward Compatible Embeddings](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539194)|Weihua Hu, Rajas Bansal, Kaidi Cao, Nikhil Rao, Karthik Subbian, Jure Leskovec|Amazon, Seattle, WA USA; Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA|Embeddings, low-dimensional vector representation of objects, are fundamental in building modern machine learning systems. In industrial settings, there is usually an embedding team that trains an embedding model to solve intended tasks (e.g., product recommendation). The produced embeddings are then widely consumed by consumer teams to solve their unintended tasks (e.g., fraud detection). However, as the embedding model gets updated and retrained to improve performance on the intended task, the newly-generated embeddings are no longer compatible with the existing consumer models. This means that historical versions of the embeddings can never be retired or all consumer teams have to retrain their models to make them compatible with the latest version of the embeddings, both of which are extremely costly in practice. Here we study the problem of embedding version updates and their backward compatibility. We formalize the problem where the goal is for the embedding team to keep updating the embedding version, while the consumer teams do not have to retrain their models. We develop a solution based on learning backward compatible embeddings, which allows the embedding model version to be updated frequently, while also allowing the latest version of the embedding to be quickly transformed into any backward compatible historical version of it, so that consumer teams do not have to retrain their models. Under our framework, we explore six methods and systematically evaluate them on a real-world recommender system application. We show that the best method, which we call BC-Aligner, maintains backward compatibility with existing unintended tasks even after multiple model version updates. Simultaneously, BC-Aligner achieves the intended task performance similar to the embedding model that is solely optimized for the intended task.|嵌入（Embeddings）作为对象的低维向量表示，是构建现代机器学习系统的基础。在工业环境中，通常由专业嵌入团队训练嵌入模型来解决特定目标任务（如商品推荐）。生成的嵌入向量随后被消费团队广泛用于解决非目标场景任务（如欺诈检测）。然而，当嵌入模型为提升目标任务的性能而进行更新和重训练时，新生成的嵌入向量与现有消费模型之间会出现兼容性问题。这意味着要么永久保留历史版本的嵌入向量，要么所有消费团队必须重新训练模型以适应最新版本的嵌入向量——这两种方案在实践中都成本极高。本文针对嵌入版本更新及其向后兼容性问题展开研究。我们将该问题形式化定义为：嵌入团队需要持续更新嵌入版本，而消费团队无需重新训练模型。我们提出了一种基于后向兼容嵌入学习的解决方案，该方案既允许频繁更新嵌入模型版本，又能将最新版本的嵌入快速转换为任何历史兼容版本，从而免除消费团队的模型重训练负担。在此框架下，我们探索了六种方法，并在真实推荐系统应用中进行了系统性评估。研究表明，被命名为"BC-Aligner"的最佳方法即使在多次模型版本更新后，仍能保持与现有非目标任务的向后兼容性。同时，BC-Aligner在目标任务上取得的性能与专门针对该任务优化的嵌入模型相当。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Learning+Backward+Compatible+Embeddings)|2|

Popular data like viral videos can be cached on edge servers to serve users with low latency. Investigating the integrity of these edge data is critical and challenging as edge servers often suffer from unreliability and constrained resources. Meanwhile, EDI (edge data integrity) investigation must be performed by edge servers collaboratively at the edge to avoid excessive backhaul network traffic. There are two main challenges in practice: 1) there is a lack of Byzantine-tolerant collaborative investigation method; and 2) edge servers may be reluctant to collaborate without proper incentives. To tackle these challenges systematically, this paper proposes a novel scheme named EdgeWatch to enable robust and collaborative EDI investigation in a decentralized manner based on blockchain. Under EdgeWatch, edge servers collaborate on EDI investigation following a novel integrity consensus. A blockchain system comprises of three main components is built as the infrastructure to facilitate integrity consensus: 1) an incentive mechanism that motivates edge servers to participate in EDI investigation; 2) a reputation system that elects reliable leaders for block consensus; and 3) a leader randomization technique that protects leaders from targeted attacks. We evaluate it against three representative schemes experimentally. The results demonstrate the high precision, efficiency, and robustness of EdgeWatch.|移动边缘计算（MEC）通过在临近用户的网络边缘部署服务器，从基础设施层面提升了数据缓存性能。热门数据（如病毒式传播视频）可缓存在边缘服务器上，以低延迟方式服务用户。由于边缘服务器存在可靠性不足和资源受限的特点，确保边缘数据完整性（EDI）的研究既至关重要又充满挑战。同时，EDI验证必须由边缘服务器协同完成，以避免产生过多的回传网络流量。实践中存在两大挑战：1）缺乏具有拜占庭容错能力的协同验证方法；2）缺乏适当激励机制时边缘服务器缺乏协作意愿。为系统性地解决这些问题，本文提出创新型方案EdgeWatch，基于区块链实现去中心化的鲁棒协同EDI验证。该方案通过新颖的完整性共识机制指导边缘服务器进行协作，并构建包含三大核心组件的区块链基础设施：1）激励边缘服务器参与验证的激励机制；2）选举可靠领导者参与区块共识的声誉系统；3）保护领导者免受针对性攻击的随机化领导者选择技术。通过三类典型方案的对比实验，结果表明EdgeWatch具有高精度、高效率和高鲁棒性的优势。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=EdgeWatch:+Collaborative+Investigation+of+Data+Integrity+at+the+Edge+based+on+Blockchain)|2|

Furthermore, recent years have witnessed an exponential growth of the model scale--from Google's 2016 model with 1 billion parameters to the latest Facebook's model with 12 trillion parameters. Significant quality boost has come with each jump of the model capacity, which makes us believe the era of 100 trillion parameters is around the corner. However, the training of such models is challenging even within industrial scale data centers. This difficulty is inherited from the staggering heterogeneity of the training computation--the model's embedding layer could include more than 99.99% of the total model size, which is extremely memory-intensive; while the rest neural network is increasingly computation-intensive. To support the training of such huge models, an efficient distributed training system is in urgent need. In this paper, we resolve this challenge by careful co-design of both the optimization algorithm and the distributed system architecture. Specifically, in order to ensure both the training efficiency and the training accuracy, we design a novel hybrid training algorithm, where the embedding layer and the dense neural network are handled by different synchronization mechanisms; then we build a system called Persia (short for parallel recommendation training system with hybrid acceleration) to support this hybrid training algorithm. Both theoretical demonstration and empirical study up to 100 trillion parameters have conducted to justified the system design and implementation of Persia. We make Persia publicly available (at this https URL) so that anyone would be able to easily train a recommender model at the scale of 100 trillion parameters.|基于深度学习的模型已占据当前生产推荐系统的主流。近年来，模型规模呈现指数级增长——从谷歌2016年拥有10亿参数的模型，到脸书最新发布的12万亿参数模型。模型容量的每次跃迁都带来显著的质量提升，这使我们相信百万亿参数时代即将到来。然而，即使依托工业级数据中心，此类模型的训练仍面临巨大挑战。这一困境源于训练计算的惊人异构性：模型嵌入层可占据总参数量99.99%以上，具有极高的内存需求；而其余神经网络部分则日益凸显计算密集型特征。为支持此类超大规模模型训练，亟需高效的分布式训练系统。本文通过协同设计优化算法与分布式系统架构来解决这一难题。具体而言，为兼顾训练效率与精度，我们设计了一种新颖的混合训练算法：对嵌入层和稠密神经网络分别采用不同的同步机制；进而构建名为Persia（混合加速并行推荐训练系统）的支持框架。我们通过理论论证与高达百万亿参数的实证研究，验证了Persia的系统设计与实现。现已将Persia开源（https://github.com/PersiaML/Persia），使所有研究者都能轻松训练百万亿级别的推荐模型。

Warner, Derek R. Harford, Thomas George Kannampallil, Chenyang Lu|Washington Univ, Sch Med, St Louis, MO USA; Washington Univ, McKelvey Sch Engn, St Louis, MO 63110 USA|Burnout is a significant public health concern affecting nearly half of the healthcare workforce. This paper presents the first end-to-end deep learning framework for predicting physician burnout based on electronic health record (EHR) activity logs, digital traces of physician work activities that are available in any EHR system. In contrast to prior approaches that exclusively relied on surveys for burnout measurement, our framework directly learns deep representations of physician behaviors from large-scale clinician activity logs to predict burnout. We propose the Hierarchical burnout Prediction based on Activity Logs (HiPAL), featuring a pre-trained time-dependent activity embedding mechanism tailored for activity logs and a hierarchical predictive model, which mirrors the natural hierarchical structure of clinician activity logs and captures physicians' evolving burnout risk at both short-term and long-term levels. To utilize the large amount of unlabeled activity logs, we propose a semi-supervised framework that learns to transfer knowledge extracted from unlabeled clinician activities to the HiPAL-based prediction model. The experiment on over 15 million clinician activity logs collected from the EHR at a large academic medical center demonstrates the advantages of our proposed framework in predictive performance of physician burnout and training efficiency over state-of-the-art approaches.|职业倦怠是影响近半数医护人员的重要公共卫生问题。本文首次提出基于电子健康记录（EHR）活动日志预测医生职业倦怠的端到端深度学习框架。与以往仅依靠问卷调查测量倦怠的方法不同，我们的框架直接从大规模临床活动日志中学习医生行为的深度表征进行预测。我们提出了基于活动日志的分层倦怠预测模型（HiPAL），其特点包括：专为活动日志设计的预训练时间依赖活动嵌入机制，以及反映临床活动日志自然层级结构的分层预测模型，可同步捕捉医生短期与长期动态变化的倦怠风险。为利用大量未标注活动日志，我们设计了半监督框架，能够将从无标注临床活动中提取的知识迁移至HiPAL预测模型。基于某大型学术医疗中心EHR系统中超过1500万条临床活动日志的实验表明，该框架在医生倦怠预测性能和训练效率方面均优于现有最先进方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=HiPAL:+A+Deep+Framework+for+Physician+Burnout+Prediction+Using+Activity+Logs+in+Electronic+Health+Records)|2|

Existing prediction models that forecast the first outbreak wave using mobility data may not be applicable to the multiwave prediction, because the evidence in the USA and Japan has shown that mobility patterns across different waves exhibit varying relationships with fluctuations in infection cases. Therefore, to predict the multiwave pandemic, we propose a Social Awareness-Based Graph Neural Network (SAB-GNN) that considers the decay of symptom-related web search frequency to capture the changes in public awareness across multiple waves. Our model combines GNN and LSTM to model the complex relationships among urban districts, inter-district mobility patterns, web search history, and future COVID-19 infections. We train our model to predict future pandemic outbreaks in the Tokyo area using its mobility and web search data from April 2020 to May 2021 across four pandemic waves collected by Yahoo Japan Corporation under strict privacy protection rules. Results demonstrate our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as ST-GNN, MPNN, and GraphLSTM. Though our model is not computationally expensive (only 3 layers and 10 hidden neurons), the proposed model enables public agencies to anticipate and prepare for future pandemic outbreaks.|新冠肺炎的反复爆发对全球社会产生了持续性影响，这要求我们利用早期可获取的多元数据构建疫情波动预测模型。现有基于人流移动数据预测首波疫情的模型可能不适用于多波次疫情预测，因为美国和日本的证据表明，不同波次中人员流动模式与感染病例波动之间的关系存在差异。为此，我们提出一种基于社会认知的图神经网络（SAB-GNN），通过分析症状相关网络搜索频次的衰减来捕捉多波疫情期间公众认知的变化。该模型结合图神经网络与长短期记忆网络，构建了城市区域、跨区域人流移动模式、网络搜索历史与未来新冠感染之间的复杂关系图谱。我们使用雅虎日本公司在严格隐私保护规则下收集的2020年4月至2021年5月东京地区四波疫情期间的人流移动和网络搜索数据训练模型，结果表明其性能优于ST-GNN、MPNN和GraphLSTM等先进基线模型。尽管模型计算成本较低（仅3层网络结构和10个隐藏神经元），但能使公共机构有效预测并应对未来疫情爆发。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Multiwave+COVID-19+Prediction+from+Social+Awareness+Using+Web+Search+and+Mobility+Data)|2|

So the measurement of item unfairness depends on the modeling of item utility, and most previous approaches estimated item utility simply based on user-item interaction logs in recommender systems. The Click-through rate (CTR) is the most popular one. However, we argue that these types of item utilities (named observed utility here) measurements may result in unfair exposures of items. The number of exposure for each item is uneven, and recommendation methods select the exposure audiences (users). In this work, we propose the concept of items' fair utility, defined as the proportion of users who are interested in the item among all users. Firstly, we conduct a large-scale random exposure experiment to collect the fair utility in a real-world recommender application. Significant differences are observed between the fair utility and the widely used observed utility (CTR). Then, intending to obtain fair utility at a low cost, we propose an exploratory task for real-time estimations of fair utility with handy historical interaction logs. Encouraging results are achieved, validating the feasibility of fair utility projections. Furthermore, we present a fairness-aware re-distribution framework and conduct abundant simulation experiments, adopting fair utility to improve fairness and overall recommendation performance at the same time. Online and offline results show that both item fairness and recommendation quality can be improved simultaneously by introducing item fair utility.|近年来，随着推荐系统的发展，项目公平性问题已成为重要关注点之一，其核心在于项目曝光度是否与其效用值相匹配。项目不公平性的衡量取决于项目效用的建模方式，而现有方法大多仅基于推荐系统中的用户-项目交互日志来估算项目效用，其中点击率（CTR）是最常用的指标。然而，我们认为这类项目效用（本文称为"观测效用"）的测量方式可能导致不公平的项目曝光分布。由于每个项目的曝光次数存在不均衡性，且推荐方法自主选择曝光受众（用户），我们提出了"项目公平效用"的概念，即对所有用户中对该项目感兴趣的用户比例进行量化。首先，我们在真实推荐场景中开展大规模随机曝光实验以采集公平效用数据，发现公平效用与广泛采用的观测效用（CTR）存在显著差异。随后，为低成本获取公平效用，我们提出一项探索性任务：利用现有历史交互日志实现公平效用的实时估算。实验取得鼓舞人心的成果，验证了公平效用预测的可行性。进一步地，我们构建了公平感知的再分配框架并进行大量模拟实验，通过采用公平效用同时提升推荐公平性与整体性能。线上与线下实验结果均表明，引入项目公平效用可同步提升项目公平性和推荐质量。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Make+Fairness+More+Fair:+Fair+Item+Utility+Estimation+and+Exposure+Re-Distribution)|2|

Unfortunately, existing approaches fall too short for these challenges; online anomaly detection methods bear the burden of handling the complexity while offline deep anomaly detection methods suffer from the evolving data distribution. This paper presents a framework for online deep anomaly detection, ARCUS, which can be instantiated with any autoencoder-based deep anomaly detection methods. It handles the complex and evolving data streams using an adaptive model pooling approach with two novel techniques: concept-driven inference and drift-aware model pool update; the former detects anomalies with a combination of models most appropriate for the complexity, and the latter adapts the model pool dynamically to fit the evolving data streams. In comprehensive experiments with ten data sets which are both high-dimensional and concept-drifted, ARCUS improved the anomaly detection accuracy of the streaming variants of state-of-the-art autoencoder-based methods and that of the state-of-the-art streaming anomaly detection methods by up to 22% and 37%, respectively.|针对数据流的在线异常检测对众多应用场景的安全保障至关重要，但由于物联网设备和云基础设施产生的数据流具有复杂性和动态演化特性，该任务正面临严峻挑战。现有方法难以应对这些挑战：在线异常检测方法需独立处理数据复杂性，而离线深度异常检测方法则无法适应动态演变的数据分布。本文提出在线深度异常检测框架ARCUS，该框架可兼容所有基于自编码器的深度异常检测方法，通过采用包含两项创新技术的自适应模型池方法应对复杂动态数据流——概念驱动推理机制根据数据复杂性选择最优模型组合进行异常检测，漂移感知模型池更新机制动态调整模型池以适应数据流演化。在十组兼具高维特性和概念漂移特性的数据集综合实验中，ARCUS框架将基于自编码器的流式检测方法性能提升最高达22%，将先进流式异常检测方法性能提升最高达37%。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Adaptive+Model+Pooling+for+Online+Deep+Anomaly+Detection+from+a+Complex+Evolving+Data+Stream)|2|

However, consumption intent is implicit, and only a few known intents have been explored from the user consumption data in Meituan. Hence, discovering new consumption intents is a crucial but challenging task, which suffers from two critical challenges: 1) how to encode the consumption intent related to multiple aspects of preferences, and 2) how to discover the new intents with only a few known ones. In Meituan, we designed the AutoIntent system, consisting of the disentangled intent encoder and intent discovery decoder, to address the above challenges. Specifically, for the disentangled intent encoder, we construct three groups of dual hypergraphs to capture the high-order relations under the three aspects of preferences and then utilize the designed hypergraph neural networks to extract disentangled intent features. For the intent discovery decoder, we propose to build intent-pair pseudo labels based on the denoised feature similarities to transfer knowledge from known intents to new ones. Extensive offline evaluations verify that AutoIntent can effectively discover unknown consumption intents. Moreover, we deploy AutoIntent in the recommendation engine of the Meituan APP, and the further online evaluation verifies its effectiveness.|消费意图作为驱动消费行为的决策性力量，对于提升用户建模系统的可解释性和性能具有关键作用，可应用于推荐、定向营销等多种下游场景。然而消费意图具有隐含性，目前美团用户消费数据中仅挖掘出少量已知意图。因此，发现新型消费意图成为一项重要但具有挑战性的任务，主要面临两大难题：1）如何编码与多维度偏好相关的消费意图；2）如何在已知意图稀少的情况下实现新意图发现。为此，我们设计了AutoIntent系统，通过解耦式意图编码器与意图发现解码器的双重架构应对上述挑战。具体而言，在解耦式意图编码器中，我们构建了三组双超图以捕捉三个偏好维度下的高阶关联，并利用设计的超图神经网络提取解耦式意图特征；在意图发现解码器中，我们提出基于去噪特征相似度构建意图对伪标签，实现从已知意图向新意图的知识迁移。大量离线实验验证了AutoIntent能有效发现未知消费意图。此外，我们将该系统部署于美团APP推荐引擎中，在线实验进一步证明了其有效性。

As a result, hierarchical clustering provides richer information and insight into a dataset than partitioning clustering. However, hierarchical clustering algorithms often have two weaknesses: scalability and the capacity to handle clusters of varying densities. This is because they rely on pairwise point-based similarity calculations and the similarity measure is independent of data distribution. In this paper, we aim to overcome these weaknesses and propose a novel efficient hierarchical clustering called StreaKHC that enables massive streaming data to be mined. The enabling factor is the use of a scalable point-set kernel to measure the similarity between an existing cluster in the cluster tree and a new point in the data stream. It also has an efficient mechanism to update the hierarchical structure so that a high-quality cluster tree can be maintained in real-time. Our extensive empirical evaluation shows that StreaKHC is more accurate and more efficient than existing hierarchical clustering algorithms.|层次聚类能够生成具有不同粒度的聚类树结构，因此相比划分式聚类能提供更丰富的数据集信息和洞察。然而传统层次聚类算法通常存在两大缺陷：可扩展性不足以及处理多密度集群的能力有限，这是因为它们依赖基于点对点的相似度计算，且相似性度量与数据分布无关。本文旨在克服这些缺陷，提出了一种名为StreaKHC的新型高效层次聚类算法，可实现海量流式数据的挖掘。该算法的核心创新在于采用可扩展的点集核函数来度量聚类树中现有集群与数据流中新数据点之间的相似性，同时具备高效的层次结构更新机制，能够实时维护高质量的聚类树。我们通过大量实验评估证明，StreaKHC相比现有层次聚类算法具有更高的准确性和运行效率。

|[Compressing Deep Graph Neural Networks via Adversarial Knowledge Distillation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539315)|Huarui He, Jie Wang, Zhanqiu Zhang, Feng Wu|Univ Sci & Technol China, Hefei, Peoples R China|Deep graph neural networks (GNNs) have been shown to be expressive for modeling graph-structured data. Nevertheless, the overstacked architecture of deep graph models makes it difficult to deploy and rapidly test on mobile or embedded systems. To compress over-stacked GNNs, knowledge distillation via a teacher-student architecture turns out to be an effective technique, where the key step is to measure the discrepancy between teacher and student networks with predefined distance functions. However, using the same distance for graphs of various structures may be unfit, and the optimal distance formulation is hard to determine. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel Adversarial Knowledge Distillation framework for graph models named GraphAKD, which adversarially trains a discriminator and a generator to adaptively detect and decrease the discrepancy. Specifically, noticing that the well-captured inter-node and inter-class correlations favor the success of deep GNNs, we propose to criticize the inherited knowledge from node-level and class-level views with a trainable discriminator. The discriminator distinguishes between teacher knowledge and what the student inherits, while the student GNN works as a generator and aims to fool the discriminator. Experiments on nodelevel and graph-level classification benchmarks demonstrate that GraphAKD improves the student performance by a large margin. The results imply that GraphAKD can precisely transfer knowledge from a complicated teacher GNN to a compact student GNN.|深度图神经网络（GNN）已被证明能有效建模图结构数据。然而，深度图模型的过度堆叠架构使其难以在移动或嵌入式系统中进行部署和快速测试。为压缩过堆叠的GNN，基于师生架构的知识蒸馏成为一种有效技术，其关键步骤是通过预定义距离函数衡量师生网络间的差异。但为不同结构的图使用相同距离度量可能不适用，且最优距离公式难以确定。针对这些问题，我们提出新型对抗式知识蒸馏框架GraphAKD，通过对抗训练判别器与生成器实现差异的自适应检测与削减。具体而言，我们观察到深度GNN的成功得益于其对节点间与类间关联的精准捕捉，因此提出采用可训练判别器，分别从节点级和类级视角批判性评估学生网络继承的知识。判别器负责区分教师知识与学生继承知识，而学生GNN作为生成器旨在迷惑判别器。在节点级和图级分类基准上的实验表明，GraphAKD使学生网络性能显著提升，证明该框架能精准地将复杂教师GNN的知识迁移至轻量化学生GNN中。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Compressing+Deep+Graph+Neural+Networks+via+Adversarial+Knowledge+Distillation)|2|
|[UD-GNN: Uncertainty-aware Debiased Training on Semi-Homophilous Graphs](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539483)|Yang Liu, Xiang Ao, Fuli Feng, Qing He|Univ Sci & Technol China, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China; Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Comp Technol, CAS, Beijing, Peoples R China|Recent studies on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) point out that most GNNs depend on the homophily assumption but fail to generalize to graphs with heterophily where dissimilar nodes connect. The concept of homophily or heterophily defined previously is a global measurement of the whole graph and cannot describe the local connectivity of a node. From the node-level perspective, we find that real-world graph structures exhibit a mixture of homophily and heterophily, which refers to the co-existence of both homophilous and heterophilous nodes. Under such a mixture, we reveal that GNNs are severely biased towards homophilous nodes, suffering a sharp performance drop on heterophilous nodes. To mitigate the bias issue, we explore an Uncertainty-aware Debiasing (UD) framework, which retains the knowledge of the biased model on certain nodes and compensates for the nodes with high uncertainty. In particular, UD estimates the uncertainty of the GNN output to recognize heterophilous nodes. UD then trains a debiased GNN by pruning the biased parameters with certain nodes and retraining the pruned parameters on nodes with high uncertainty. We apply UD on both homophilous GNNs (GCN and GAT) and heterophilous GNNs (Mixhop and GPR-GNN) and conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets, where the debiased model consistently performs better and narrows the performance gap between homophilous and heterophilous nodes.|近期关于图神经网络(GNN)的研究指出，大多数GNN模型依赖于同配性假设，难以泛化到具有异配性(相异节点相连)的图结构。先前定义的同配性或异配性概念是对图结构的全局度量，无法描述节点的局部连接特性。从节点层面出发，我们发现现实世界图结构同时存在同配性与异配性混合特征，即同配节点与异配节点共存的现象。在此混合环境下，我们揭示GNN模型存在严重偏向同配节点的问题，导致其在异配节点上的性能急剧下降。为缓解这种偏差问题，我们提出一种不确定性感知去偏(UD)框架，该框架保留偏置模型在特定节点上的知识，并对高不确定性节点进行补偿。具体而言，UD通过估计GNN输出的不确定性来识别异配节点，随后通过剪裁模型在特定节点上的偏置参数，并在高不确定性节点上重新训练剪裁后的参数来训练去偏GNN。我们将UD应用于同配型GNN(GCN、GAT)和异配型GNN(Mixhop、GPR-GNN)，在合成数据集和基准数据集上的实验表明，去偏模型性能持续提升，并显著缩小了同配节点与异配节点之间的性能差距。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=UD-GNN:+Uncertainty-aware+Debiased+Training+on+Semi-Homophilous+Graphs)|2|
|[Interpreting Trajectories from Multiple Views: A Hierarchical Self-Attention Network for Estimating the Time of Arrival](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539051)|Zebin Chen, Xiaolin Xiao, YueJiao Gong, Jun Fang, Nan Ma, Hua Chai, Zhiguang Cao|Didi Chuxing, Beijing, Peoples R China; South China Univ Technol, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; Singapore Inst Mfg Technol, Singapore, Singapore|Estimating the time of arrival is a crucial task in intelligent transportation systems. Although considerable efforts have been made to solve this problem, most of them decompose a trajectory into several segments and then compute the travel time by integrating the attributes from all segments. The segment view, though being able to depict the local traffic conditions straightforwardly, is insufficient to embody the intrinsic structure of trajectories on the road network. To overcome the limitation, this study proposes multi-view trajectory representation that comprehensively interprets a trajectory from the segment-, link-, and intersection-views. To fulfill the purpose, we design a hierarchical self-attention network (HierETA) that accurately models the local traffic conditions and the underlying trajectory structure. Specifically, a segment encoder is developed to capture the spatio-temporal dependencies at a fine granularity, within which an adaptive self-attention module is designed to boost performance. Further, a joint link-intersection encoder is developed to characterize the natural trajectory structure consisting of alternatively arranged links and intersections. Afterward, a hierarchy-aware attention decoder is designed to realize a tradeoff between the multi-view spatio-temporal features. The hierarchical encoders and the attentive decoder are simultaneously learned to achieve an overall optimality. Experiments on two large-scale practical datasets show the superiority of HierETA over the state-of-the-arts.|到达时间估计是智能交通系统中的关键任务。尽管已有大量研究致力于解决该问题，但多数方法将轨迹分解为若干路段，通过整合所有路段的属性来计算行程时间。这种路段视角虽能直观反映局部交通状况，却难以体现路网轨迹的内在结构特征。为突破这一局限，本研究提出多视角轨迹表征方法，从路段、连接线和交叉口三个维度综合解析轨迹。基于此，我们设计了分层自注意力网络（HierETA），精准建模局部交通状况与深层轨迹结构。具体而言：开发路段编码器以细粒度捕捉时空依赖性，其中创新性引入自适应自注意力模块以提升性能；构建联合连接线-交叉口编码器，表征由连接线与交叉口交替构成的天然轨迹结构；设计层次感知注意力解码器，实现多视角时空特征的动态权衡。通过同步优化分层编码器与注意力解码器，实现整体性能最优。在两个大规模真实数据集上的实验表明，HierETA显著优于现有最优方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Interpreting+Trajectories+from+Multiple+Views:+A+Hierarchical+Self-Attention+Network+for+Estimating+the+Time+of+Arrival)|2|

In the field of online service systems, operators rely on enormous monitoring data to detect and mitigate failures. Quickly recognizing a small set of root cause indicators for the underlying fault can save much time for failure mitigation. In this paper, we formulate the root cause analysis problem as a new causal inference task namedintervention recognition. We proposed a novel unsupervised causal inference-based method namedCausal Inference-based Root Cause Analysis (CIRCA). The core idea is a sufficient condition for a monitoring variable to be a root cause indicator,i.e., the change of probability distribution conditioned on the parents in the Causal Bayesian Network (CBN). Towards the application in online service systems, CIRCA constructs a graph among monitoring metrics based on the knowledge of system architecture and a set of causal assumptions. The simulation study illustrates the theoretical reliability of CIRCA. The performance on a real-world dataset further shows that CIRCA can improve the recall of the top-1 recommendation by 25% over the best baseline method.|故障诊断在诸多领域至关重要，因为故障可能导致安全威胁或经济损失。在线服务系统领域中，运维人员依赖海量监控数据来检测并缓解故障。快速识别出底层故障的核心根因指标能为故障排除节省大量时间。本文将根因分析问题构建为一种名为"干预识别"的新型因果推理任务，提出了一种基于因果推理的无监督创新方法——基于因果推理的根因分析法（CIRCA）。其核心思想是判定监控变量成为根因指标的充分条件：即以因果贝叶斯网络（CBN）中父节点为条件时概率分布发生的变化。针对在线服务系统的应用场景，CIRCA基于系统架构知识和一系列因果假设构建监控指标关系图。仿真研究验证了CIRCA的理论可靠性，在真实数据集上的性能表现进一步表明：相较于最佳基线方法，CIRCA能将Top-1推荐的召回率提升25%。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Causal+Inference-Based+Root+Cause+Analysis+for+Online+Service+Systems+with+Intervention+Recognition)|2|
|[RES: A Robust Framework for Guiding Visual Explanation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539419)|Yuyang Gao, Tong Steven Sun, Guangji Bai, Siyi Gu, Sungsoo Ray Hong, Liang Zhao|Emory Univ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA USA|Despite the fast progress of explanation techniques in modern Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) where the main focus is handling "how to generate the explanations", advanced research questions that examine the quality of the explanation itself (e.g., "whether the explanations are accurate") and improve the explanation quality (e.g., "how to adjust the model to generate more accurate explanations when explanations are inaccurate") are still relatively under-explored. To guide the model toward better explanations, techniques in explanation supervision - which add supervision signals on the model explanation - have started to show promising effects on improving both the generalizability as and intrinsic interpretability of Deep Neural Networks. However, the research on supervising explanations, especially in vision-based applications represented through saliency maps, is in its early stage due to several inherent challenges: 1) inaccuracy of the human explanation annotation boundary, 2) incompleteness of the human explanation annotation region, and 3) inconsistency of the data distribution between human annotation and model explanation maps. To address the challenges, we propose a generic RES framework for guiding visual explanation by developing a novel objective that handles inaccurate boundary, incomplete region, and inconsistent distribution of human annotations, with a theoretical justification on model generalizability. Extensive experiments on two real-world image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on enhancing both the reasonability of the explanation and the performance of the backbone DNNs model.|尽管现代深度神经网络（DNN）的可解释性技术快速发展——其焦点主要集中于"如何生成解释"，但针对解释本身质量的检验（如"解释是否准确"）以及解释质量提升（如"当解释不准确时如何调整模型以生成更精确解释"）等进阶研究问题仍相对欠缺探索。为引导模型产生更好的解释，解释监督技术通过为模型解释添加监督信号，在提升深度神经网络的泛化能力和内在可解释性方面展现出显著效果。然而，由于存在若干固有挑战，基于视觉显著性图谱的解释监督研究仍处于早期阶段：1）人工解释标注边界的不精确性；2）人工解释标注区域的不完整性；3）人工标注与模型解释图谱之间的数据分布不一致性。针对这些挑战，我们提出通用RES框架，通过构建新型目标函数处理人工标注的边界不精确、区域不完整和分布不一致问题，并从理论层面证明了其对模型泛化能力的提升。在两个真实世界图像数据集上的大量实验表明，该框架能有效提升解释的合理性及主干DNN模型的性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=RES:+A+Robust+Framework+for+Guiding+Visual+Explanation)|2|
|[ProActive: Self-Attentive Temporal Point Process Flows for Activity Sequences](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539477)|Vinayak Gupta, Srikanta Bedathur|IIT Delhi, New Delhi, India|Any human activity can be represented as a temporal sequence of actions performed to achieve a certain goal. Unlike machine-made time series, these action sequences are highly disparate as the time taken to finish a similar action might vary between different persons. Therefore, understanding the dynamics of these sequences is essential for many downstream tasks such as activity length prediction, goal prediction, etc. Existing neural approaches that model an activity sequence are either limited to visual data or are task-specific, i.e., limited to next action or goal prediction. In this paper, we present ProActive, a neural marked temporal point process (MTPP) framework for modeling the continuous-time distribution of actions in an activity sequence while simultaneously addressing three high-impact problems - next action prediction, sequence-goal prediction, and end-to-end sequence generation. Specifically, we utilize a self-attention module with temporal normalizing flows to model the influence and the inter-arrival times between actions in a sequence. Moreover, for time-sensitive prediction, we perform an early detection of sequence goal via a constrained margin-based optimization procedure. This in-turn allows ProActive to predict the sequence goal using a limited number of actions. Extensive experiments on sequences derived from three activity recognition datasets show the significant accuracy boost of ProActive over the state-of-the-art in terms of action and goal prediction, and the first-ever application of end-to-end action sequence generation.|人类活动可被表征为一系列为实现特定目标而执行的时序动作序列。与机器生成的时间序列不同，这些动作序列具有高度异质性，因为不同个体完成相似动作所需时间存在差异。因此，理解这些序列的动态特性对于活动时长预测、目标预测等下游任务至关重要。现有建模活动序列的神经方法要么局限于视觉数据，要么具有任务特定性——仅限于下一动作或目标预测。本文提出ProActive框架，这是一种神经标记时间点过程（MTPP）模型，既能对活动序列中动作的连续时间分布进行建模，同时解决三个高价值问题：下一动作预测、序列目标预测和端到端序列生成。具体而言，我们采用具有时间标准化流的自注意力模块来建模序列中动作间的相互影响和到达时间间隔。针对时间敏感型预测任务，我们通过约束边际优化程序实现序列目标的早期检测，这使得ProActive能够仅通过有限动作即可预测序列目标。在源自三个活动识别数据集的序列上进行的广泛实验表明：ProActive在动作和目标预测精度上显著超越现有最优技术，并首次实现了端到端动作序列生成的实际应用。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=ProActive:+Self-Attentive+Temporal+Point+Process+Flows+for+Activity+Sequences)|2|
|[Communication-Efficient Robust Federated Learning with Noisy Labels](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539328)|Junyi Li, Jian Pei, Heng Huang|Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Burnaby, BC, Canada; Univ Pittsburgh, Elect & Comp Engn, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA|Federated learning (FL) is a promising privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm over distributed located data. In FL, the data is kept locally by each user. This protects the user privacy, but also makes the server difficult to verify data quality, especially if the data are correctly labeled. Training with corrupted labels is harmful to the federated learning task; however, little attention has been paid to FL in the case of label noise. In this paper, we focus on this problem and propose a learning-based reweighting approach to mitigate the effect of noisy labels in FL. More precisely, we tuned a weight for each training sample such that the learned model has optimal generalization performance over a validation set. More formally, the process can be formulated as a Federated Bilevel Optimization problem. Bilevel optimization problem is a type of optimization problem with two levels of entangled problems. The non-distributed bilevel problems have witnessed notable progress recently with new efficient algorithms. However, solving bilevel optimization problems under the Federated Learning setting is under-investigated. We identify that the high communication cost in hypergradient evaluation is the major bottleneck. So we propose Comm-FedBiO to solve the general Federated Bilevel Optimization problems; more specifically, we propose two communication-efficient subroutines to estimate the hypergradient. Convergence analysis of the proposed algorithms is also provided. Finally, we apply the proposed algorithms to solve the noisy label problem. Our approach has shown superior performance on several real-world datasets compared to various baselines.|联邦学习（FL）是一种基于分布式数据且具有隐私保护优势的机器学习范式。在该框架中，数据始终存储在用户本地，这种方式虽然保护了用户隐私，却也导致服务器难以验证数据质量——尤其是标注的正确性。使用错误标注数据进行训练会严重影响联邦学习效果，然而目前针对标注噪声场景的联邦学习研究仍处于探索阶段。本文聚焦该问题，提出了一种基于学习的重加权方法以减轻噪声标签对联邦学习的影响。具体而言，我们通过为每个训练样本调整权重，使得最终学习的模型在验证集上获得最优泛化性能。该过程可形式化为联邦双层优化问题：这类优化问题包含两个相互耦合的层级，近年来在非分布式场景中已涌现出多种高效算法。然而联邦学习环境下的双层优化研究尚属空白。我们发现超梯度计算中的高通信成本是主要瓶颈，因此提出Comm-FedBiO算法来求解通用联邦双层优化问题，具体包括两个通信高效的超梯度估计子程序，并提供了算法的收敛性分析。最终我们将所提算法应用于噪声标签问题，在多个真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比现有基线模型展现出显著优势。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Communication-Efficient+Robust+Federated+Learning+with+Noisy+Labels)|2|

However, recent studies have shown that attackers can catastrophically degrade the performance of GNNs by maliciously modifying the graph structure. A straightforward solution to remedy this issue is to model the edge weights by learning a metric function between pairwise representations of two end nodes, which attempts to assign low weights to adversarial edges. The existing methods use either raw features or representations learned by supervised GNNs to model the edge weights. However, both strategies are faced with some immediate problems: raw features cannot represent various properties of nodes (e.g., structure information), and representations learned by supervised GNN may suffer from the poor performance of the classifier on the poisoned graph. We need representations that carry both feature information and as mush correct structure information as possible and are insensitive to structural perturbations. To this end, we propose an unsupervised pipeline, named STABLE, to optimize the graph structure. Finally, we input the well-refined graph into a downstream classifier. For this part, we design an advanced GCN that significantly enhances the robustness of vanilla GCN [24] without increasing the time complexity. Extensive experiments on four real-world graph benchmarks demonstrate that STABLE outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and successfully defends against various attacks.|得益于消息传递机制，图神经网络（GNN）在图数据相关任务中取得了显著成功。然而近期研究表明，攻击者通过对图结构进行恶意修改，可导致GNN性能急剧下降。解决该问题的直接方法是通过学习两个端节点对表征间的度量函数来建模边权重，旨在为对抗性边分配较低权重。现有方法或使用原始特征，或采用监督式GNN学习到的表征来建模边权重，但这两种策略均存在明显缺陷：原始特征无法表征节点的多样化属性（如结构信息），而监督式GNN学习的表征可能因分类器在中毒图上的性能退化而受影响。我们需要能够同时承载特征信息与尽可能正确的结构信息，且对结构扰动不敏感的表征。为此，我们提出名为STABLE的无监督图结构优化流程，最终将优化后的图输入下游分类器。在此环节，我们设计了一种先进图卷积网络，在不增加时间复杂度的前提下显著增强了经典GCN[24]的鲁棒性。在四个真实图基准数据集上的大量实验表明，STABLE优于现有最优方法，并能成功抵御多种攻击。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Reliable+Representations+Make+A+Stronger+Defender:+Unsupervised+Structure+Refinement+for+Robust+GNN)|2|

We design a KG triple transformation method to enable Transformer to handle KGs, which is further strengthened by the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) sparse activation. We then formulate the complex logical queries as masked prediction and introduce a two-stage masked pre-training strategy to improve transferability and generalizability.

|[Learning on Graphs with Out-of-Distribution Nodes](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539457)|Yu Song, Donglin Wang|Westlake Univ, Hangzhou, Peoples R China|Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are state-of-the-art models for performing prediction tasks on graphs. While existing GNNs have shown great performance on various tasks related to graphs, little attention has been paid to the scenario where out-of-distribution (OOD) nodes exist in the graph during training and inference. Borrowing the concept from CV and NLP, we define OOD nodes as nodes with labels unseen from the training set. Since a lot of networks are automatically constructed by programs, real-world graphs are often noisy and may contain nodes from unknown distributions. In this work, we define the problem of graph learning with out-of-distribution nodes. Specifically, we aim to accomplish two tasks: 1) detect nodes which do not belong to the known distribution and 2) classify the remaining nodes to be one of the known classes. We demonstrate that the connection patterns in graphs are informative for outlier detection, and propose Out-of-Distribution Graph Attention Network (OODGAT), a novel GNN model which explicitly models the interaction between different kinds of nodes and separate inliers from outliers during feature propagation. Extensive experiments show that OODGAT outperforms existing outlier detection methods by a large margin, while being better or comparable in terms of in-distribution classification.|图神经网络（GNN）是当前处理图预测任务的最先进模型。尽管现有GNN在各种图相关任务中表现出卓越性能，但针对训练和推理过程中存在分布外（OOD）节点场景的研究仍显不足。借鉴计算机视觉与自然语言处理领域的概念，我们将OOD节点定义为训练集中未出现过的标签类别所对应的节点。由于许多网络是通过程序自动构建的，现实世界的图数据常存在噪声，并可能包含来自未知分布的节点。本研究首次明确了含分布外节点的图学习问题，具体致力于完成两项任务：1）检测不属于已知分布的节点；2）将其余节点分类至已知类别之一。我们通过实验证明图中的连接模式对异常检测具有重要价值，进而提出分布外图注意力网络（OODGAT）。该新型GNN模型在特征传播过程中显式建模不同类型节点间的交互作用，实现内点与异常点的有效分离。大量实验表明，OODGAT在异常检测方面显著优于现有方法，同时在内分布分类任务上达到更优或相当的性能水平。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Learning+on+Graphs+with+Out-of-Distribution+Nodes)|2|

They mostly follow the paradigm of learning to attend, which maximizes the mutual information between the attended graph and the ground-truth label. However, this paradigm makes GNN classifiers recklessly absorb all the statistical correlations between input features and labels in the training data, without distinguishing the causal and noncausal effects of features. Instead of underscoring the causal features, the attended graphs are prone to visit the noncausal features as the shortcut to predictions. Such shortcut features might easily change outside the training distribution, thereby making the GNN classifiers suffer from poor generalization. In this work, we take a causal look at the GNN modeling for graph classification. With our causal assumption, the shortcut feature serves as a confounder between the causal feature and prediction. It tricks the classifier to learn spurious correlations that facilitate the prediction in in-distribution (ID) test evaluation, while causing the performance drop in out-of-distribution (OOD) test data. To endow the classifier with better interpretation and generalization, we propose the Causal Attention Learning (CAL) strategy, which discovers the causal patterns and mitigates the confounding effect of shortcuts. Specifically, we employ attention modules to estimate the causal and shortcut features of the input graph. We then parameterize the backdoor adjustment of causal theory -- combine each causal feature with various shortcut features. It encourages the stable relationships between the causal estimation and the prediction, regardless of the changes in shortcut parts and distributions. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CAL.|在图分类任务中，基于注意力机制和池化操作的图神经网络（GNN）已成为提取关键特征和支持预测的主流方法。这些方法大多遵循"学习注意力"的范式，通过最大化被关注图与真实标签之间的互信息进行优化。然而，该范式会导致GNN分类器盲目吸收训练数据中输入特征与标签之间的所有统计关联，而无法区分特征的因果效应与非因果效应。被关注的图结构往往会绕过因果特征，转而利用非因果特征作为预测捷径。此类捷径特征在训练分布之外极易发生变化，从而导致GNN分类器的泛化能力显著下降。

本研究从因果视角重新审视图分类中的GNN建模。根据我们的因果假设，捷径特征在因果特征与预测结果之间扮演了混淆变量的角色。它诱导分类器学习伪相关关系：虽然在分布内（ID）测试评估中能提升预测效果，但在分布外（OOD）测试数据上会导致性能退化。为增强分类器的可解释性与泛化能力，我们提出因果注意力学习（CAL）策略，通过发现因果模式并减轻捷径特征的混淆效应来实现这一目标。具体而言，我们采用注意力模块分别估计输入图的因果特征和捷径特征，随后对因果理论中的后门调整进行参数化建模——将每个因果特征与多种捷径特征进行组合。该方法能强化因果估计与预测结果之间的稳定关联，而不受捷径部分及分布变化的影响。在合成数据集和真实数据集上的大量实验验证了CAL方法的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Causal+Attention+for+Interpretable+and+Generalizable+Graph+Classification)|2|
|[Graph Neural Networks with Node-wise Architecture](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539387)|Zhen Wang, Zhewei Wei, Yaliang Li, Weirui Kuang, Bolin Ding|Renmin Univ China, Beijing, Peoples R China; Alibaba Grp, Beijing, Peoples R China|Recently, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) for GNN has received increasing popularity as it can seek an optimal architecture for a given new graph. However, the optimal architecture is applied to all the instances (i.e., nodes, in the context of graph) equally, which might be insufficient to handle the diverse local patterns ingrained in a graph, as shown in this paper and some very recent studies. Thus, we argue the necessity of node-wise architecture search for GNN. Nevertheless, node-wise architecture cannot be realized by trivially applying NAS methods node by node due to the scalability issue and the need for determining test nodes' architectures. To tackle these challenges, we propose a framework wherein the parametric controllers decide the GNN architecture for each node based on its local patterns. We instantiate our framework with depth, aggregator and resolution controllers, and then elaborate on learning the backbone GNN model and the controllers to encourage their cooperation. Empirically, we justify the effects of node-wise architecture through the performance improvements introduced by the three controllers, respectively. Moreover, our proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on five of the ten real-world datasets, where the diversity of these datasets has hindered any graph convolution-based method to lead on them simultaneously. This result further confirms that node-wise architecture can help GNNs become versatile models.|近年来，图神经网络架构搜索（NAS）因其能为给定图数据寻找最优架构而日益受到关注。然而，现有方法将最优架构同等应用于所有实例（即图中的节点），如本文及最新研究表明，这种处理方式可能难以应对图中固有的多样化局部模式。因此，我们提出图神经网络需要进行节点级架构搜索的必要性。但受限于计算可扩展性及测试节点架构确定的难题，通过简单逐节点应用NAS方法无法实现节点级架构。为解决这些挑战，我们提出一个框架：参数化控制器根据每个节点的局部模式决定其GNN架构。我们通过深度控制器、聚合控制器和分辨率控制器实现该框架，并详细阐述如何促进主干GNN模型与控制器的协同学习。实验结果表明，三个控制器分别带来的性能提升验证了节点级架构的有效性。此外，在十个真实数据集的五个基准测试中，我们提出的框架显著优于现有最优方法——这些数据集的多样性曾使所有基于图卷积的方法难以同时领先。该结果进一步证实节点级架构有助于GNN成为通用性更强的模型。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Graph+Neural+Networks+with+Node-wise+Architecture)|2|

However, an important question remains: how can we extract relevant information from the user's utterances and use it in the retrieval or recommendation in the next turn of the conversation? Utilizing relevant information from users' utterances leads the system to better results at the end of the conversation. In this paper, we propose a model based on reinforcement learning, namely RelInCo, which takes the user's utterances and the context of the conversation and classifies each word in the user's utterances as belonging to the relevant or non-relevant class. RelInCo uses two Actors: 1) Arrangement-Actor, which finds the most relevant order of words in user's utterances, and 2) Selector-Actor, which determines which words, in the order provided by the arrangement Actor, can bring the system closer to the target of the conversation. In this way, we can find relevant information in the user's utterance and use it in the conversation. The objective function in our model is designed in such a way that it can maximize any desired retrieval and recommendation metrics (i.e., the ultimate|会话搜索和推荐系统可以通过会话提出澄清问题，并从用户那里收集有价值的信息。然而，一个重要的问题仍然存在: 我们如何从用户的话语中提取相关信息，并将其用于下一轮对话中的检索或推荐？利用用户话语中的相关信息，可以使系统在对话结束时获得更好的结果。在本文中，我们提出了一个基于强化学习的模型，即 RelinCo，该模型根据用户的话语和对话的上下文，将用户话语中的每个单词归类为相关或非相关类别。RelInCo 使用了两个参与者: 1)安排-参与者，它找到用户话语中最相关的词语顺序; 2)选择-参与者，它根据安排-参与者提供的顺序决定哪些词语可以使系统更接近对话的目标。通过这种方式，我们可以在用户的话语中找到相关信息，并在对话中加以利用。我们模型中的目标函数是这样设计的，它可以最大化任何所需的检索和推荐指标(即，最终的|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Extracting+Relevant+Information+from+User's+Utterances+in+Conversational+Search+and+Recommendation)|1|

However, EBR in sponsored search is distinguished from other generic scenarios and technically challenging due to the need of serving multiple retrieval purposes: firstly, it has to retrieve high-relevance ads, which may exactly serve user's search intent; secondly, it needs to retrieve high-CTR ads so as to maximize the overall user clicks. In this paper, we present a novel representation learning framework Uni-Retriever developed for Bing Search, which unifies two different training modes knowledge distillation and contrastive learning to realize both required objectives. On one hand, the capability of making high-relevance retrieval is established by distilling knowledge from the "relevance teacher model''. On the other hand, the capability of making high-CTR retrieval is optimized by learning to discriminate user's clicked ads from the entire corpus. The two training modes are jointly performed as a multi-objective learning process, such that the ads of high relevance and CTR can be favored by the generated embeddings. Besides the learning strategy, we also elaborate our solution for EBR serving pipeline built upon the substantially optimized DiskANN, where massive-scale EBR can be performed with competitive time and memory efficiency, and accomplished in high-quality. We make comprehensive offline and online experiments to evaluate the proposed techniques, whose findings may provide useful insights for the future development of EBR systems.

For example, each task may be trained on different set of training data; the labels of different tasks may have different arrival time due to label delay; different tasks will interact with each other; combining the losses of each task is non-trivial. We tackle these challenges using practical and novel techniques such as multi-stage training for handling label delay, Multi-gate Mixture-of-Experts (MMoE) to optimize model interaction and an auto-parameter learning algorithm to optimize the loss weights of different tasks.

A major difficulty for e-commerce text relevance is the severe vocabulary gap between query and product. Recently, neural networks have been the mainstream for the text matching task owing to the better performance for semantic matching. Practical e-commerce relevance models are usually representation-based architecture, which can pre-compute representations offline and are therefore online efficient. Interaction-based models, although can achieve better performance, are mostly time-consuming and hard to be deployed online. Recently BERT has achieved significant progress on many NLP tasks including text matching, and it is of great value but also big challenge to deploy BERT to the e-commerce relevance task. To realize this goal, we propose ReprBERT, which has the advantages of both excellent performance and low latency, by distilling the interaction-based BERT model to a representation-based architecture. To reduce the performance decline, we investigate the key reasons and propose two novel interaction strategies to resolve the absence of representation interaction and low-level semantic interaction. Finally, ReprBERT can achieve only about 1.5% AUC loss from the interaction-based BERT, but has more than 10% AUC improvement compared to previous state-of-the-art representation-based models. ReprBERT has already been deployed on the search engine of Taobao and serving the entire search traffic, achieving significant gain of user experience and business profit.|查询和产品的文本相关性或文本匹配是电子商务搜索引擎的关键技术，它可以帮助用户找到想要的产品，也是保证用户体验的关键。电子商务文本相关性的一个主要困难是查询和产品之间严重的词汇差距。近年来，神经网络以其较好的语义匹配性能成为文本匹配的主流。实用的电子商务相关性模型通常是基于表示的体系结构，它可以离线预先计算表示，因此具有在线效率。基于交互的模型，尽管可以获得更好的性能，但是大部分都是耗时的，并且很难在线部署。近年来，BERT 在包括文本匹配在内的许多自然语言处理任务中取得了显著的进展，将 BERT 部署到电子商务相关任务中具有很大的价值，但也面临很大的挑战。为了实现这一目标，我们提出了 ReprBERT，它具有良好的性能和低延迟的优点，通过提炼基于交互的 BERT 模型到一个基于表示的体系结构。为了减少表征交互和低层次语义交互的缺失，本文研究了表征交互和低层次语义交互的关键原因，并提出了两种新的交互策略来解决表征交互和低层次语义交互的缺失问题。最后，ReprBERT 只能从基于交互的 BERT 中获得约1.5% 的 AUC 损失，但与以前的基于最先进表示的模型相比，具有超过10% 的 AUC 改善。ReprBERT 已经部署在淘宝的搜索引擎上，服务于整个搜索流量，取得了显著的用户体验和商业利润收益。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=ReprBERT:+Distilling+BERT+to+an+Efficient+Representation-Based+Relevance+Model+for+E-Commerce)|1|
|[Learning Supplementary NLP Features for CTR Prediction in Sponsored Search](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539064)|Dong Wang, Shaoguang Yan, Yunqing Xia, Kavé Salamatian, Weiwei Deng, Qi Zhang|University of Savoie & Tallinn University of Technology, Annecy, France; Microsoft Corporation, Beijing, China|In sponsored search engines, pre-trained language models have shown promising performance improvements on Click-Through-Rate (CTR) prediction. A widely used approach for utilizing pre-trained language models in CTR prediction consists of fine-tuning the language models with click labels and early stopping on peak value of the obtained Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC). Thereafter the output of these fine-tuned models, i.e., the final score or intermediate embedding generated by language model, is used as a new Natural Language Processing (NLP) feature into CTR prediction baseline. This cascade approach avoids complicating the CTR prediction baseline, while keeping flexibility and agility. However, we show in this work that calibrating separately the language model based on the peak single model AUC does not always yield NLP features that give the best performance in CTR prediction model ultimately. Our analysis reveals that the misalignment is due to overlap and redundancy between the new NLP features and the existing features in CTR prediction baseline. In other words, the NLP features can improve CTR prediction better if such overlap can be reduced. For this purpose, we introduce a simple and general joint-training framework for fine-tuning of language models, combined with the already existing features in CTR prediction baseline, to extract supplementary knowledge for NLP feature. Moreover, we develop an efficient Supplementary Knowledge Distillation (SuKD) that transfers the supplementary knowledge learned by a heavy language model to a light and serviceable model. Comprehensive experiments on both public data and commercial data presented in this work demonstrate that the new NLP features resulting from the joint-training framework can outperform significantly the ones from the independent fine-tuning based on click labels. we also show that the light model distilled with SuKD can provide obvious AUC improvement in CTR prediction over the traditional feature-based knowledge distillation.|在赞助商搜索引擎中，预先训练好的语言模型在点击率(Click-Through-Rate，CTR)预测方面显示出有希望的性能改进。一个广泛使用的方法，利用预先训练的语言模型在点击率预测包括微调的语言模型与点击标签和早期停止在 ROC 曲线下面积(AUC)峰值获得。然后，这些微调模型的输出，即语言模型生成的最终分数或中间嵌入，被用作 CTR 预测基线的一个新的自然语言处理(NLP)特征。这种级联方法避免了使 CTR 预测基线复杂化，同时保持了灵活性和敏捷性。然而，我们的工作表明，基于峰值单模型 AUC 分别标定语言模型并不总是产生 NLP 特征，最终给出 CTR 预测模型的最佳性能。我们的分析表明，失调是由于重叠和冗余之间的新 NLP 特征和现有的特征在 CTR 预测基线。换句话说，如果能够减少这种重叠，NLP 特征能够更好地提高 CTR 预测。为此，本文提出了一种简单通用的语言模型微调联合训练框架，结合 CTR 预测基线中已有的特征，提取 NLP 特征的补充知识。此外，我们开发了一个有效的补充知识提取(SuKD) ，将重语言模型所学到的补充知识转化为一个简单易用的模型。对公共数据和商业数据的综合实验表明，联合训练框架所产生的新的自然语言处理特征可以显著优于基于点击标签的独立微调。与传统的基于特征的知识提取方法相比，用 SuKD 提取的光模型在 CTR 预测方面可以提供明显的 AUC 改进。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Learning+Supplementary+NLP+Features+for+CTR+Prediction+in+Sponsored+Search)|1|

However, the embedding tables often demand an extremely large number of parameters, which become the storage and efficiency bottlenecks. Distributed training solutions have been adopted to partition the embedding tables into multiple devices. However, the embedding tables can easily lead to imbalances if not carefully partitioned. This is a significant design challenge of distributed systems named embedding table sharding, i.e., how we should partition the embedding tables to balance the costs across devices, which is a non-trivial task because 1) it is hard to efficiently and precisely measure the cost, and 2) the partition problem is known to be NP-hard. In this work, we introduce our novel practice in Meta, namely AutoShard, which uses a neural cost model to directly predict the multi-table costs and leverages deep reinforcement learning to solve the partition problem. Experimental results on an open-sourced large-scale synthetic dataset and Meta's production dataset demonstrate the superiority of AutoShard over the heuristics. Moreover, the learned policy of AutoShard can transfer to sharding tasks with various numbers of tables and different ratios of the unseen tables without any fine-tuning. Furthermore, AutoShard can efficiently shard hundreds of tables in seconds. The effectiveness, transferability, and efficiency of AutoShard make it desirable for production use. Our algorithms have been deployed in Meta production environment.

|[On-Device Learning for Model Personalization with Large-Scale Cloud-Coordinated Domain Adaption](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539263)|Yikai Yan, Chaoyue Niu, Renjie Gu, Fan Wu, Shaojie Tang, Lifeng Hua, Chengfei Lyu, Guihai Chen|Alibaba Group, Hangzhou, China; Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China; University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA|Cloud-based learning is currently the mainstream in both academia and industry. However, the global data distribution, as a mixture of all the users' data distributions, for training a global model may deviate from each user's local distribution for inference, making the global model non-optimal for each individual user. To mitigate distribution discrepancy, on-device training over local data for model personalization is a potential solution, but suffers from serious overfitting. In this work, we propose a new device-cloud collaborative learning framework under the paradigm of domain adaption, called MPDA, to break the dilemmas of purely cloud-based learning and on-device training. From the perspective of a certain user, the general idea of MPDA is to retrieve some similar data from the cloud's global pool, which functions as large-scale source domains, to augment the user's local data as the target domain. The key principle of choosing which outside data depends on whether the model trained over these data can generalize well over the local data. We theoretically analyze that MPDA can reduce distribution discrepancy and overfitting risk. We also extensively evaluate over the public MovieLens 20M and Amazon Electronics datasets, as well as an industrial dataset collected from Mobile Taobao over a period of 30 days. We finally build a device-tunnel-cloud system pipeline, deploy MPDA in the icon area of Mobile Taobao for click-through rate prediction, and conduct online A/B testing. Both offline and online results demonstrate that MPDA outperforms the baselines of cloud-based learning and on-device training only over local data, from multiple offline and online metrics.|基于云的学习是目前学术界和工业界的主流。然而，全局数据分布作为所有用户数据分布的混合，用于训练全局模型可能偏离每个用户的局部分布进行推理，使得全局模型对于每个用户不是最优的。为了缓解分布差异，对模型个性化的本地数据进行设备上的训练是一个潜在的解决方案，但是存在严重的过拟合问题。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个新的设备-云计算合作学习框架，在领域适应的范例下称为 MPDA，以打破纯粹基于云的学习和设备上培训的困境。从某个用户的角度来看，MPDA 的总体思想是从作为大规模源域的云的全局池中检索一些类似的数据，以增加用户的本地数据作为目标域。选择哪些外部数据的关键原则取决于对这些数据进行训练的模型是否能够比本地数据更好地推广。从理论上分析了 MPDA 可以降低分布差异和过拟合风险。我们还广泛评估了公开的 MovieLens 20M 和亚马逊电子数据集，以及在30天内从移动淘宝收集的工业数据集。最后，我们建立了设备-隧道-云系统流水线，在移动淘宝的图标区域部署 MPDA 进行点进率预测，并进行在线 A/B 测试。离线和在线结果都表明，MPDA 仅在多个离线和在线指标的本地数据上优于基于云的学习和设备上培训的基线。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=On-Device+Learning+for+Model+Personalization+with+Large-Scale+Cloud-Coordinated+Domain+Adaption)|1|

We investigate privacy threats faced by recommender systems through the lens of membership inference. In such attacks, an adversary aims to infer whether a user's data is used to train the target recommender. To achieve this, previous work has used a shadow recommender to derive training data for the attack model, and then predicts the membership by calculating difference vectors between users' historical interactions and recommended items. State-of-the-art methods face two challenging problems: (i) training data for the attack model is biased due to the gap between shadow and target recommenders, and (ii) hidden states in recommenders are not observational, resulting in inaccurate estimations of difference vectors. To address the above limitations, we propose a Debiasing Learning for Membership Inference Attacks against recommender systems (DL-MIA) framework that has four main components: (i) a difference vector generator, (ii) a disentangled encoder, (iii) a weight estimator, and (iv) an attack model. To mitigate the gap between recommenders, a variational auto-encoder (VAE) based disentangled encoder is devised to identify recommender invariant and specific features. To reduce the estimation bias, we design a weight estimator, assigning a truth-level score for each difference vector to indicate estimation accuracy.

|[Automatic Generation of Product-Image Sequence in E-commerce](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539149)|Xiaochuan Fan, Chi Zhang, Yong Yang, Yue Shang, Xueying Zhang, Zhen He, Yun Xiao, Bo Long, Lingfei Wu|JD.COM, Beijing, UNK, China; JD.COM Research, Mountain View, CA, USA|Product images are essential for providing desirable user experience in an e-commerce platform. For a platform with billions of products, it is extremely time-costly and labor-expensive to manually pick and organize qualified images. Furthermore, there are the numerous and complicated image rules that a product image needs to comply in order to be generated/selected. To address these challenges, in this paper, we present a new learning framework in order to achieve Automatic Generation of Product-Image Sequence (AGPIS) in e-commerce. To this end, we propose a Multi-modality Unified Image-sequence Classifier (MUIsC), which is able to simultaneously detect all categories of rule violations through learning. MUIsC leverages textual review feedback as the additional training target and utilizes product textual description to provide extra semantic information. %Without using prior knowledge or manually-crafted task, a single MUIsC model is able to learn the holistic knowledge of image reviewing and detect all categories of rule violations simultaneously. Based on offline evaluations, we show that the proposed MUIsC significantly outperforms various baselines. Besides MUIsC, we also integrate some other important modules in the proposed framework, such as primary image selection, non-compliant content detection, and image deduplication. With all these modules, our framework works effectively and efficiently in JD.com recommendation platform. By Dec 2021, our AGPIS framework has generated high-standard images for about 1.5 million products and achieves 13.6% in reject rate.

|[Training Large-Scale News Recommenders with Pretrained Language Models in the Loop](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539120)|Shitao Xiao, Zheng Liu, Yingxia Shao, Tao Di, Bhuvan Middha, Fangzhao Wu, Xing Xie|; Microsoft Res Asia, Beijing, Peoples R China; Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Beijing, Peoples R China; Microsoft, Redmond, WA USA|News recommendation calls for deep insights of news articles' underlying semantics. Therefore, pretrained language models (PLMs), like BERT and RoBERTa, may substantially contribute to the recommendation quality. However, it's extremely challenging to have news recommenders trained together with such big models: the learning of news recommenders requires intensive news encoding operations, whose cost is prohibitive if PLMs are used as the news encoder. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, SpeedyFeed, which efficiently trains PLMs-based news recommenders of superior quality. SpeedyFeed is highlighted for its light-weight encoding pipeline, which gives rise to three major advantages. Firstly, it makes the intermediate results fully reusable for the training workflow, which removes most of the repetitive but redundant encoding operations. Secondly, it improves the data efficiency of the training workflow, where non-informative data can be eliminated from encoding. Thirdly, it further saves the cost by leveraging simplified news encoding and compact news representation. SpeedyFeed leads to more than 100x acceleration of the training process, which enables big models to be trained efficiently and effectively over massive user data. The well-trained PLMs-based model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art news recommenders in comprehensive offline experiments. It is applied to Microsoft News to empower the training of large-scale production models, which demonstrate highly competitive online performances. SpeedyFeed is also a model-agnostic framework, thus being potentially applicable to a wide spectrum of content-based recommender systems. We've made the source code open to the public so as to facilitate research and applications in related areas.|新闻推荐任务要求深入理解新闻文本的底层语义。因此，预训练语言模型（如BERT和RoBERTa）可显著提升推荐质量。但将此类大型模型与新闻推荐系统联合训练面临巨大挑战：新闻推荐器的学习过程需要密集型新闻编码操作，若采用预训练模型作为新闻编码器，其计算成本将难以承受。本文提出创新框架SpeedyFeed，能够高效训练出基于预训练模型的优质新闻推荐系统。该框架的核心优势在于其轻量级编码管道，主要体现为三大突破：首先，实现中间结果在训练流程中的完全可复用性，消除了大部分重复冗余的编码操作；其次，通过剔除非信息性数据参与编码，显著提升训练流程的数据效率；第三，采用简化新闻编码和紧凑型新闻表征进一步降低成本。SpeedyFeed实现了训练过程超百倍加速，使得大型模型能基于海量用户数据实现高效训练。经全面离线实验验证，基于该框架训练的预训练模型显著优于现有最优新闻推荐系统。该技术已应用于微软新闻平台，支持大规模生产模型的训练，并展现出极具竞争力的在线性能。SpeedyFeed作为模型无关框架，未来可广泛应用于各类基于内容的推荐系统。我们已公开源代码以促进相关领域的研究与应用。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Training+Large-Scale+News+Recommenders+with+Pretrained+Language+Models+in+the+Loop)|1|

Intuitively, it is a crucial step to recommend suitable doctor candidates for patients, especially with suffering the severe cold-start challenge of patients due to the limited historical records and insufficient description of patient condition. Along this line, in this paper, we propose a novel Dialogue based Doctor Recommendation (DDR) model, which comprehensively integrates three types of information in modeling, including the profile and chief complaint from patients, the historical records of doctors and the patient-doctor dialogue. Accordingly, we propose 1) a patient encoder which represents the patient's condition and medical requirements; 2) a doctor encoder which distills the doctor's expertise and communication skills; 3) a dialogue encoder which extracts textual features from doctor-patient conversation. Specifically, since the patient-doctor dialogue is not available in the testing stage, we propose to simulate the dialogue embedding with patient embedding via a contrastive learning based module. Experimental results on a real-world data set show that the proposed DDR model can outperform state-of-the-art recommendation-based methods.

Multimodal Federated Learning (MFL) is an emerging area allowing many distributed clients, each of which can collect data from multiple types of sensors, to participate in the training of some multimodal data-related models without sharing their data. In this paper, we address a novel challenging issue in MFL, the modality incongruity, where clients may have heterogeneous setups of sensors and their local data consists of different combinations of modalities. With the modality incongruity, clients may solve different tasks on different parameter spaces, which escalates the difficulties in dealing with the statistical heterogeneity problem of federated learning; also, it would be hard to perform accurate model aggregation across different types of clients. To tackle these challenges, in this work, we propose the FedMSplit framework, which allows federated training over multimodal distributed data without assuming similar active sensors in all clients. The key idea is to employ a dynamic and multi-view graph structure to adaptively capture the correlations amongst multimodal client models. More specifically, we split client models into smaller shareable blocks and allow each type of blocks to provide a specific view on client relationships. With the graph representation, the underlying correlations between clients can be captured as the edge features in the multi-view graph, and then be utilized to promote local model relations through the neighborhood message passing in the graph. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method under different sensor setups with statistical heterogeneity.|随着数据采集技术的进步，终端用户开始关注如何利用多类型数据的协同作用提升生活体验。多模态联邦学习(MFL)作为一个新兴领域，允许多个分布式客户端（每个客户端可通过多种传感器采集数据）在不共享本地数据的前提下，共同参与多模态相关模型的训练。本文针对MFL中一个新颖且具有挑战性的问题——模态异质性问题展开研究：客户端可能配备异构的传感器组合，其本地数据包含不同模态的组合形式。这种模态异质性问题导致客户端可能在不同的参数空间上处理不同任务，加剧了联邦学习中统计异构问题的处理难度；同时，跨不同类型客户端的精确模型聚合也面临巨大挑战。为解决这些问题，我们提出FedMSplit框架，该框架支持在多模态分布式数据上进行联邦训练，且无需假设所有客户端具有相同的活跃传感器配置。其核心思想是采用动态多视图图结构自适应地捕捉多模态客户端模型间的关联关系。具体而言，我们将客户端模型拆分为更小的可共享模块，使每类模块能够提供客户端关系的特定视图。通过图表示学习，客户端间的潜在关联被转化为多视图图中的边特征，并利用图中邻域消息传递机制来增强本地模型关联性。实验结果表明，在统计异构的不同传感器配置环境下，我们的方法均展现出卓越有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=FedMSplit:+Correlation-Adaptive+Federated+Multi-Task+Learning+across+Multimodal+Split+Networks)|1|

One way to study a graph is to focus on its spectrum, i.e., the eigenvalue distribution of its associated matrices. Recent advancements in spectral graph theory show that spectral moments of a network can be used to capture the network structure and various graph properties. However, sometimes networks with different structures or sizes can have the same or similar spectral moments, not to mention the existence of the cospectral graphs. To address such problems, we propose a 3D network representation that relies on the spectral information of subgraphs: the Spectral Path, a path connecting the spectral moments of the network and those of its subgraphs of different sizes. We show that the spectral path is interpretable and can capture relationship between a network and its subgraphs, for which we present a theoretical foundation.

There are recent works that have explored solutions on condensing image datasets through complex bi-level optimization. For instance, dataset condensation (DC) matches network gradients w.r.t. large-real data and small-synthetic data, where the network weights are optimized for multiple steps at each outer iteration. However, existing approaches have their inherent limitations: (1) they are not directly applicable to graphs where the data is discrete; and (2) the condensation process is computationally expensive due to the involved nested optimization. To bridge the gap, we investigate efficient dataset condensation tailored for graph datasets where we model the discrete graph structure as a probabilistic model. We further propose a one-step gradient matching scheme, which performs gradient matching for only one single step without training the network weights. Our theoretical analysis shows this strategy can generate synthetic graphs that lead to lower classification loss on real graphs. Extensive experiments on various graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. In particular, we are able to reduce the dataset size by 90% while approximating up to 98% of the original performance and our method is significantly faster than multi-step gradient matching (e.g. $15$× in CIFAR10 for synthesizing 500 graphs).|由于在大型数据集上训练深度学习模型耗时且资源密集，构建小型合成数据集以充分训练模型成为迫切需求。近期研究通过复杂的双层优化探索图像数据集压缩方案，例如数据集压缩（DC）技术通过匹配网络在大型真实数据与小型合成数据上的梯度实现压缩，其中网络权重在每个外部迭代中需经过多步优化。然而现有方法存在固有局限性：（1）无法直接适用于数据离散的图结构；（2）嵌套优化导致计算成本高昂。为弥补这一差距，我们研究针对图数据集的高效压缩方法，将离散图结构建模为概率模型。我们进一步提出单步梯度匹配方案，仅通过单步梯度匹配即可完成压缩，无需训练网络权重。理论分析表明该策略生成的合成图能在真实图上实现更低的分类损失。在多类图数据集上的实验证明了方法的有效性和高效性——在将数据集规模压缩90%的同时，仍可保持高达98%的原始性能，且速度显著优于多步梯度匹配方案（如在CIFAR10上合成500张图时速度提升15倍）。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Condensing+Graphs+via+One-Step+Gradient+Matching)|1|

A necessary step to visualize data is through creating suitable specifications in some declarative visualization languages (DVLs, e.g., Vega-Lite, ECharts). Due to the steep learning curve of mastering DVLs, automatically generating DVs via natural language questions, or text-to-vis, has been proposed and received great attention. However, existing neural network-based text-to-vis models, such as Seq2Vis or ncNet, usually generate DVs from scratch, limiting their performance due to the complex nature of this problem. Inspired by how developers reuse previously validated source code snippets from code search engines or a large-scale codebase when they conduct software development, we provide a novel hybrid retrieval-generation framework named RGVisNet for text-to-vis. It retrieves the most relevant DV query candidate as a prototype from the DV query codebase, and then revises the prototype to generate the desired DV query. Specifically, the DV query retrieval model is a neural ranking model which employs a schema-aware encoder for the NL question, and a GNN-based DV query encoder to capture the structure information of a DV query. At the same time, the DV query revision model shares the same structure and parameters of the encoders, and employs a DV grammar-aware decoder to reuse the retrieved prototype. Experimental evaluation on the public NVBench dataset validates that RGVisNet can significantly outperform existing generative text-to-vis models such as ncNet, by up to 74.28% relative improvement in terms of overall accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, RGVisNet is the first framework that seamlessly integrates the retrieval- with the generative-based approach for the text-to-vis task.|近年来，随着数据可视化系统成为传递海量数据背后洞察力的生动有力工具，其在学术界和工业界呈现蓬勃发展态势。实现数据可视化的必要步骤是通过声明式可视化语言（如Vega-Lite、ECharts）创建合适的规范。由于掌握这类语言存在较高学习门槛，基于自然语言问题自动生成可视化（即文本到可视化转换）的技术应运而生并广受关注。然而现有基于神经网络的文本到可视化模型（如Seq2Vis、ncNet）通常从零开始生成可视化方案，受限于该问题的复杂性，其性能存在明显瓶颈。受开发者从代码搜索引擎或大型代码库复用已验证代码片段的开发模式启发，我们提出了一种新颖的检索-生成混合框架RGVisNet。该框架首先从可视化查询代码库中检索最相关的候选原型，继而通过修订原型生成目标可视化查询。具体而言：可视化查询检索模型采用神经排序架构，使用模式感知编码器处理自然语言问题，并基于图神经网络的查询编码器捕捉可视化查询的结构信息；可视化查询修订模型共享编码器结构与参数，采用语法感知解码器实现原型复用。在公开基准NVBench上的实验表明，RGVisNet相比ncNet等生成式模型取得显著提升，整体准确率最高相对提升74.28%。据我们所知，这是首个将检索式与生成式方法无缝融合的文本到可视化转换框架。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=RGVisNet:+A+Hybrid+Retrieval-Generation+Neural+Framework+Towards+Automatic+Data+Visualization+Generation)|1|

Most CF methods utilize an encoder to embed users and items into the same representation space, and the Bayesian personalized ranking (BPR) loss is usually adopted as the objective function to learn informative encoders. Existing studies mainly focus on designing more powerful encoders (e.g., graph neural network) to learn better representations. However, few efforts have been devoted to investigating the desired properties of representations in CF, which is important to understand the rationale of existing CF methods and design new learning objectives. In this paper, we measure the representation quality in CF from the perspective of alignment and uniformity on the hypersphere. We first theoretically reveal the connection between the BPR loss and these two properties. Then, we empirically analyze the learning dynamics of typical CF methods in terms of quantified alignment and uniformity, which shows that better alignment or uniformity both contribute to higher recommendation performance. Based on the analyses results, a learning objective that directly optimizes these two properties is proposed, named DirectAU. We conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets, and the proposed learning framework with a simple matrix factorization model leads to significant performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art CF methods.|协同过滤（CF）在推荐系统发展中具有关键作用。大多数CF方法通过编码器将用户和项目嵌入到同一表示空间，并通常采用贝叶斯个性化排序（BPR）损失作为目标函数来学习信息编码器。现有研究主要集中于设计更强大的编码器（如图神经网络）以获取更好的表示，但鲜有工作深入探究协同过滤中表示质量应具备的特性，而这对于理解现有CF方法的原理和设计新的学习目标具有重要意义。本文从超球面对齐性（alignment）和均匀性（uniformity）的视角衡量CF中的表示质量：首先从理论层面揭示BPR损失与这两个特性之间的关联；进而通过量化指标实证分析典型CF方法在学习过程中的对齐性与均匀性变化，证明更好的对齐性或均匀性均有助提升推荐性能。基于分析结果，我们提出直接优化这两个特性的学习目标DirectAU。在三个公共数据集上的大量实验表明，采用简单矩阵分解模型的该学习框架相比最先进的CF方法能带来显著的性能提升。

|[Comprehensive Fair Meta-learned Recommender System](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539269)|Tianxin Wei, Jingrui He|Univ Illinois, Champaign, IL 61820 USA|In recommender systems, one common challenge is the cold-start problem, where interactions are very limited for fresh users in the systems. To address this challenge, recently, many works introduce the meta-optimization idea into the recommendation scenarios, i.e. learning to learn the user preference by only a few past interaction items. The core idea is to learn global shared meta-initialization parameters for all users and rapidly adapt them into local parameters for each user respectively. They aim at deriving general knowledge across preference learning of various users, so as to rapidly adapt to the future new user with the learned prior and a small amount of training data. However, previous works have shown that recommender systems are generally vulnerable to bias and unfairness. Despite the success of meta-learning at improving the recommendation performance with cold-start, the fairness issues are largely overlooked. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive fair meta-learning framework, named CLOVER, for ensuring the fairness of meta-learned recommendation models. We systematically study three kinds of fairness - individual fairness, counterfactual fairness, and group fairness in the recommender systems, and propose to satisfy all three kinds via a multi-task adversarial learning scheme. Our framework offers a generic training paradigm that is applicable to different meta-learned recommender systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CLOVER on the representative meta-learned user preference estimator on three real-world data sets.

This task is usually modeled as a search problem. Recently, data-driven methods have attracted many research interests and shown promising results for retrosynthetic planning. We observe that the same intermediate molecules are visited many times in the searching process, and they are usually independently treated in previous tree-based methods (e.g., AND-OR tree search, Monte Carlo tree search). Such redundancies make the search process inefficient. We propose a graph-based search policy that eliminates the redundant explorations of any intermediate molecules. As searching over a graph is more complicated than over a tree, we further adopt a graph neural network to guide the search over graphs. Meanwhile, our method can search a batch of targets together in the graph and remove the inter-target duplication in the tree-based search methods. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Especially on the widely used USPTO benchmark, we improve the search success rate to 99.47%, advancing previous state-of-the-art performance for 2.6 points.|逆合成规划旨在寻找合成目标分子的反应路径，在化学和药物发现领域具有重要作用。该任务通常被建模为搜索问题。近年来，数据驱动方法吸引了大量研究关注，并在逆合成规划中展现出优异性能。我们发现同一中间分子在搜索过程中会被多次访问，而传统基于树结构的搜索方法（如与或树搜索、蒙特卡洛树搜索）通常对其独立处理，这种冗余导致搜索效率低下。我们提出一种基于图的搜索策略，可消除对任何中间分子的冗余探索。由于图搜索比树搜索更复杂，我们进一步采用图神经网络来指导图搜索过程。同时，本方法能在图中批量搜索多个目标分子，消除树搜索方法中存在的目标间重复探索。在两个数据集上的实验结果表明了我们方法的有效性。尤其在广泛使用的USPTO基准测试中，我们将搜索成功率提升至99.47%，较先前最优性能提高了2.6个百分点。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=RetroGraph:+Retrosynthetic+Planning+with+Graph+Search)|1|

The topological structures of real-world KGs, however, are rather heterogeneous, i.e., a KG is composed of multiple distinct hierarchies and non-hierarchical graph structures. Therefore, a homogeneous (either Euclidean or hyperbolic) geometry is not sufficient for fairly representing such heterogeneous structures. To capture the topological heterogeneity of KGs, we present an ultrahyperbolic KG embedding (UltraE) in an ultrahyperbolic (or pseudo-Riemannian) manifold that seamlessly interleaves hyperbolic and spherical manifolds. In particular, we model each relation as a pseudo-orthogonal transformation that preserves the pseudo-Riemannian bilinear form. The pseudo-orthogonal transformation is decomposed into various operators (i.e., circular rotations, reflections and hyperbolic rotations), allowing for simultaneously modeling heterogeneous structures as well as complex relational patterns. Experimental results on three standard KGs show that UltraE outperforms previous Euclidean, hyperbolic, and mixed-curvature KG embedding approaches.|近年来，双曲几何因其在表示层次结构方面的卓越能力，推动了知识图谱（KG）嵌入技术的发展。然而现实世界知识图谱的拓扑结构具有高度异质性，即一个知识图谱由多个不同的层次结构和非层次图结构组成。因此，采用单一几何空间（欧几里得或双曲）无法充分表征这种异质结构。为捕捉知识图谱的拓扑异质性，我们提出在超双曲（或称伪黎曼）流形中构建超双曲知识图谱嵌入模型（UltraE），该流形可无缝交织双曲流形与球面流形。具体而言，我们将每种关系建模为保持伪黎曼双线性形式的伪正交变换。通过将伪正交变换分解为多种算子（圆周旋转、反射和双曲旋转），该模型能同时处理异质结构和复杂关系模式。在三个标准知识图谱上的实验结果表明，UltraE优于以往基于欧几里得几何、双曲几何及混合曲率的知识图谱嵌入方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Ultrahyperbolic+Knowledge+Graph+Embeddings)|1|

The advantage of hyperbolic recommendation lies in that its exponentially increasing capacity is well-suited to describe the power-law distributed user-item network whereas the Euclidean equivalent is deficient. Nonetheless, it remains unclear which kinds of items can be effectively recommended by the hyperbolic model and which cannot. To address the above concerns, we take the most basic recommendation technique, collaborative filtering, as a medium, to investigate the behaviors of hyperbolic and Euclidean recommendation models. The results reveal that (1) tail items get more emphasis in hyperbolic space than that in Euclidean space, but there is still ample room for improvement; (2) head items receive modest attention in hyperbolic space, which could be considerably improved; (3) and nonetheless, the hyperbolic models show more competitive performance than Euclidean models. Driven by the above observations, we design a novel learning method, named hyperbolic informative collaborative learning (HICF), aiming to compensate for the recommendation effectiveness of the head item while at the same time improving the performance of the tail item. The main idea is to adapt the hyperbolic margin ranking learning, making its pull and push procedure geometric-aware, and providing informative guidance for the learning of both head and tail items. Extensive experiments back up the analytic findings and also show the effectiveness of the proposed method. The work is valuable for personalized recommendations since it reveals that the hyperbolic space facilitates modeling the tail item, which often represents user-customized preferences or new products.|考虑到用户-项目网络中普遍存在的幂律分布特性，双曲空间近年来在推荐系统领域受到广泛关注并展现出卓越性能。双曲推荐的优势在于其指数级增长的容量特性恰好契合描述幂律分布的用户-项目网络，而欧几里得模型在此方面存在固有缺陷。然而，目前尚不清楚双曲模型究竟能有效推荐哪些类型的项目，又会在哪些项目上表现不佳。针对这一问题，我们以最基础的协同过滤技术为媒介，深入探究双曲与欧几里得推荐模型的行为特征。研究发现：（1）与欧几里得空间相比，双曲空间对长尾项目的关注度更高，但仍有较大提升空间；（2）头部项目在双曲空间中获得的关注相对有限，存在显著改进余地；（3）尽管如此，双曲模型整体仍展现出较欧几里得模型更具竞争力的性能。基于这些发现，我们创新性地提出双曲信息协同学习框架（HICF），在提升长尾项目推荐效果的同时补偿头部项目的推荐效能。该方法的核心理念是通过适配双曲边际排序学习，使其推拉过程具备几何感知能力，并为头部与长尾项目的学习提供信息指导。大量实验不仅验证了分析结论，也证明了所提方法的有效性。本研究对个性化推荐具有重要价值，它揭示出双曲空间特别有利于建模往往代表用户定制偏好或新产品的长尾项目。

However, existing GNNs are not fully suitable for many real-world web applications. For example, over-smoothing may affect personalized recommendations and the lack of an explanation for the GNN prediction hind the understanding of many business scenarios. To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a new second-order continuous GNN which naturally avoids over-smoothing and enjoys better interpretability. There is some research interest in continuous graph neural networks inspired by the recent success of neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs). However, there are some remaining problems w.r.t. the prevailing first-order continuous GNN frameworks. Firstly, augmenting node features is an essential, however heuristic step for the numerical stability of current frameworks; secondly, first-order methods characterize a diffusion process, in which the over-smoothing effect w.r.t. node representations are intrinsic; and thirdly, there are some difficulties to integrate the topology of graphs into the ODEs. Therefore, we propose a framework employing second-order graph neural networks, which usually learn a less stiff transformation than the first-order counterpart. Our method can also be viewed as a coupled first-order model, which is easy to implement. We propose a semi-model-agnostic method based on our model to enhance the prediction explanation using high-order information. We construct an analog between continuous GNNs and some famous partial differential equations and discuss some properties of the first and second-order models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, and the results outperform related baselines.|图神经网络（GNN）是解决众多网络研究问题的有力工具。然而现有GNN并不能完全适用于现实世界的网络应用场景。例如，过度平滑效应可能影响个性化推荐效果，且GNN预测缺乏可解释性会阻碍对商业场景的理解。针对这些问题，本文提出了一种新型二阶连续图神经网络，其天然避免过度平滑问题并具有更优的可解释性。近年来神经常微分方程（ODE）的成功激发了学界对连续图神经网络的研究兴趣，但主流的一阶连续GNN框架仍存在若干问题：首先，增强节点特征虽是当前框架维持数值稳定性的关键步骤，但其策略依赖启发式设计；其次，一阶方法本质刻画扩散过程，其节点表示存在固有的过度平滑效应；第三，现有方法难以将图拓扑结构有效融入ODE框架。为此，我们提出采用二阶图神经网络的框架，其学习到的变换比一阶方法具有更低刚性。该方法亦可视为耦合的一阶模型，易于实现。基于该模型，我们提出半模型无关的高阶信息解释方法以增强预测可解释性。通过构建连续GNN与经典偏微分方程的类比，我们深入分析了一阶与二阶模型特性。大量实验证明所提方法的有效性，其性能显著超越相关基线模型。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Improving+Social+Network+Embedding+via+New+Second-Order+Continuous+Graph+Neural+Networks)|1|

However, existing approaches either assume that team formation is consistent throughout a match or assign formations frame-by-frame, which disagree with real situations. To tackle this issue, we propose a change-point detection framework named SoccerCPD that distinguishes tactically intended formation and role changes from temporary changes in soccer matches. We first assign roles to players frame-by-frame and perform two-step change-point detections: (1) formation change-point detection based on the sequence of role-adjacency matrices and (2) role change-point detection based on the sequence of role permutations. The evaluation of SoccerCPD using the ground truth annotated by domain experts shows that our method accurately detects the points of tactical changes and estimates the formation and role assignment per segment. Lastly, we introduce practical use-cases that domain participants can easily interpret and utilize.|在足球和篮球等流动性团队运动中，分析阵型布局是从领域参与者角度理解战术最直观的方法之一。然而现有方法要么假设整场比赛阵型保持不变，要么逐帧分配阵型，这与实际情况不符。为解决这一问题，我们提出名为SoccerCPD的变点检测框架，用于区分足球比赛中战术性阵型调整、角色转换与临时性变化。我们首先逐帧分配球员角色，并执行两阶段变点检测：(1) 基于角色邻接矩阵序列的阵型变点检测；(2) 基于角色置换序列的角色变点检测。通过领域专家标注的真实数据评估显示，SoccerCPD能准确检测战术变化点并估算每个时段的阵型与角色分配。最后我们介绍了领域参与者易于解读和实际应用的用例。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=SoccerCPD:+Formation+and+Role+Change-Point+Detection+in+Soccer+Matches+Using+Spatiotemporal+Tracking+Data)|1|

This paradigm enables efficient semantic retrieval. However, the single-vector representations can be ineffective at capturing different aspects of the queries and documents in relevance matching, especially for some vertical domains. For example, in e-commerce search, these aspects could be category, brand and color. Given a query ''white nike socks", a Dense Retrieval model may mistakenly retrieve some ''white adidas socks" while missing out the intended brand. We propose to explicitly represent multiple aspects using one embedding per aspect. We introduce an aspect prediction task to teach the model to capture aspect information with particular aspect embeddings. We design a lightweight network to fuse the aspect embeddings for representing queries and documents. Our evaluation using an e-commerce dataset shows impressive improvements over strong Dense Retrieval baselines. We also discover that the proposed aspect embeddings can enhance the interpretability of Dense Retrieval models as a byproduct.|以往的研究通常采用单向量表示（亦称嵌入）对查询项和文档进行编码，并借助近似最近邻搜索在嵌入空间执行检索。该范式虽能实现高效的语义检索，但在相关匹配中难以有效捕捉查询项与文档的多维度特征，尤其在特定垂直领域表现更为明显。以电商搜索为例，这些维度可能包含商品类别、品牌和颜色。当用户查询"白色耐克袜子"时，密集检索模型可能会错误返回"白色阿迪达斯袜子"，却遗漏了目标品牌。为此，我们提出为每个维度生成独立嵌入向量的多维度显式表征方案：通过引入维度预测任务，指导模型使用特定维度嵌入捕捉维度信息；设计轻量级网络融合各维度嵌入以表征查询项和文档。在电商数据集上的评估表明，该方法较现有强基线模型取得显著提升。我们还发现，所提出的维度嵌入表征能够作为副产品增强密集检索模型的可解释性。

Graph embedding models, which can learn low-dimensional embeddings for nodes in the social graph to effectively represent the proximity between nodes, have been widely adopted for friend recommendations. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated superiority over shallow graph embedding methods, thanks to their ability to explicitly encode neighborhood context. This is also verified in our Xbox friend recommendation scenario, where some simplified GNNs, such as LightGCN and PPRGo, achieve the best performance. However, we observe that many GNN variants, including LightGCN and PPRGo, use a static and pre-defined normalizer in neighborhood aggregation, which is decoupled with the representation learning process and can cause the scale distortion issue. As a consequence, the true power of GNNs has not yet been fully demonstrated in friend recommendations. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective self-rescaling network (SSNet) to alleviate the scale distortion issue. At the core of SSNet is a generalized self-rescaling mechanism, which bridges the neighborhood aggregator's normalization with the node embedding learning process in an end-to-end framework.

To recommend proper drugs, existing methods rely on various clinical records (e.g., diagnosis and procedures), which are commonly found in data such as electronic health records (EHRs). However, detailed records as such are often not available and the inputs might merely include a set of symptoms provided by doctors. Moreover, existing drug recommender systems usually treat drugs as individual items, ignoring the unique requirements that drug recommendation has to be done on a set of items (drugs), which should be as small as possible and safe without harmful drug-drug interactions (DDIs). To deal with the challenges above, in this paper, we propose a novel framework of Symptom-based Set-to-set Small and Safe drug recommendation (4SDrug). To enable set-to-set comparison, we design set-oriented representation and similarity measurement for both symptoms and drugs. Further, towards the symptom sets, we devise importance-based set aggregation to enhance the accuracy of symptom set representation; towards the drug sets, we devise intersection-based set augmentation to ensure smaller drug sets, and apply knowledge-based and data-driven penalties to ensure safer drug sets. Extensive experiments on two real-world EHR datasets, i.e., the public benchmark one of MIMIC-III and the industrial large-scale one of NELL, show drastic performance gains brought by 4SDrug, which outperforms all baselines in most effectiveness measures, while yielding the smallest sets of recommended drugs and 26.83% DDI rate reduction from the ground-truth data.|药物推荐是人工智能在医疗领域的重要应用任务。为提供准确的药物推荐，现有方法通常依赖电子健康记录（EHR）等数据中常见的各类临床记录（如诊断和治疗方案）。然而此类详细记录往往难以获取，实际输入可能仅包含医生提供的一组症状描述。此外，现有药物推荐系统通常将药物视为独立个体，忽略了药物推荐必须满足的特殊要求：推荐结果应为尽可能精简的药物组合，且需确保安全性以避免有害的药物相互作用（DDI）。为应对上述挑战，本文提出基于症状的集对集精简安全药物推荐创新框架（4SDrug）。为实现集合层面的匹配，我们设计了针对症状集和药物集的定向表征与相似度度量机制：对于症状集合，采用基于重要性的集合聚合方法以提升症状表征精度；对于药物集合，通过基于交集的集合扩增技术确保推荐药物集最小化，同时应用知识驱动与数据驱动的双重惩罚机制保障药物安全性。在MIMIC-III公共基准数据集和NELL工业级大规模数据集上的实验表明，4SDrug在多数效能指标上超越所有基线模型，其推荐药物集规模最小且DDI发生率较真实数据降低26.83%，展现出显著性能提升。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=4SDrug:+Symptom-based+Set-to-set+Small+and+Safe+Drug+Recommendation)|1|

|[Variational Inference for Training Graph Neural Networks in Low-Data Regime through Joint Structure-Label Estimation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539283)|Danning Lao, Xinyu Yang, Qitian Wu, Junchi Yan|Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China|Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are one of the prominent methods to solve semi-supervised learning on graphs. However, most of the existing GNN models often need sufficient observed data to allow for effective learning and generalization. In real-world scenarios where complete input graph structure and sufficient node labels might not be achieved easily, GNN models would encounter with severe performance degradation. To address this problem, we propose WSGNN, short for weakly-supervised graph neural network. WSGNN is a flexible probabilistic generative framework which harnesses variational inference approach to solve graph semi-supervised learning in a label-structure joint estimation manner. It collaboratively learns task-related new graph structure and node representations through a two-branch network, and targets a composite variational objective derived from underlying data generation distribution concerning the inter-dependence between scarce observed data and massive missing data. Especially, under weakly-supervised low-data regime where labeled nodes and observed edges are both very limited, extensive experimental results on node classification and link prediction over common benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of WSGNN over strong competitors. Concretely, when only 1 label per class and 1% edges are observed on Cora, WSGNN maintains a decent 52.00% classification accuracy, exceeding GCN by 75.6%.|图神经网络（GNN）是解决图上半监督学习问题的重要方法之一。然而现有大多数GNN模型往往需要充足的观测数据才能实现有效学习与泛化。在现实场景中，当完整的输入图结构和充足节点标签难以获取时，GNN模型会出现严重的性能退化。针对此问题，我们提出弱监督图神经网络WSGNN——一个基于变分推理的灵活概率生成框架，通过标签-结构联合估计方式解决图上半监督学习问题。该框架通过双分支网络协同学习任务相关的新图结构与节点表示，并基于底层数据生成分布中稀缺观测数据与海量缺失数据间的相互依赖关系，推导出复合变分优化目标。特别是在标记节点和观测边都极其有限的弱监督低数据场景下，我们在节点分类和链路预测任务上对常用基准数据集进行了大量实验，结果表明WSGNN相较强基线模型展现出最先进的性能。具体而言，当Cora数据集每类仅1个标签且仅观测1%边时，WSGNN仍保持52.00%的分类准确率，较GCN模型提升75.6%。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Variational+Inference+for+Training+Graph+Neural+Networks+in+Low-Data+Regime+through+Joint+Structure-Label+Estimation)|1|
|[Pairwise Adversarial Training for Unsupervised Class-imbalanced Domain Adaptation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539243)|Weili Shi, Ronghang Zhu, Sheng Li|Associate Professor, University of Virginia, Charlottesville; PhD student, University of Virginia, Charlottesville; PhD student, Computer Science, University of Georgia|Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has become an appealing approach for knowledge transfer from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. However, when the classes in source and target domains are imbalanced, most existing UDA methods experience significant performance drop, as the decision boundary usually favors the majority classes. Some recent class-imbalanced domain adaptation (CDA) methods aim to tackle the challenge of biased label distribution by exploiting pseudo-labeled target samples during training process. However, these methods suffer from the issues with unreliable pseudo labels and error accumulation during training. In this paper, we propose a pairwise adversarial training approach for class-imbalanced domain adaptation. Unlike conventional adversarial training in which the adversarial samples are obtained from the lp ball of the original samples, we generate adversarial samples from the interpolated line of the aligned pairwise samples from source and target domains. The pairwise adversarial training (PAT) is a novel data-augmentation method which can be integrated into existing UDA models to tackle with the CDA problem. Experimental results and ablation studies show that the UDA models integrated with our method achieve considerable improvements on benchmarks compared with the original models as well as the state-of-the-art CDA methods. Our source code is available at: https://github.com/DamoSWL/Pairwise-Adversarial-Training|无监督领域自适应（UDA）已成为从带标注的源领域向无标注目标领域迁移知识的重要方法。然而当源领域与目标领域的类别分布不均衡时，大多数现有UDA方法会出现显著性能下降，因为决策边界通常会偏向多数类。近期一些类别不平衡领域自适应（CDA）方法试图通过在训练过程中利用伪标注目标样本来解决标签分布偏差的挑战，但这些方法存在伪标签可靠性不足及训练过程中误差累积的问题。本文提出一种面向类别不平衡领域自适应的成对对抗训练方法。与传统对抗训练从原始样本的lp范数邻域生成对抗样本不同，我们从源领域与目标领域对齐的成对样本插值线上生成对抗样本。这种成对对抗训练（PAT）是一种新型数据增强方法，可集成到现有UDA模型中解决CDA问题。实验结果表明，采用本方法的UDA模型在基准测试中相比原模型及当前最优CDA方法均取得显著提升，消融研究也验证了方法的有效性。源代码已开源：https://github.com/DamoSWL/Pairwise-Adversarial-Training

|[TrajGAT: A Graph-based Long-term Dependency Modeling Approach for Trajectory Similarity Computation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539358)|Di Yao, Haonan Hu, Lun Du, Gao Cong, Shi Han, Jingping Bi|Microsoft Res Asia, Beijing, Peoples R China; Nanyang Technol Univ, Singapore, Singapore; Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Comp Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China|Computing trajectory similarities is a critical and fundamental task for various spatial-temporal applications, such as clustering, prediction, and anomaly detection. Traditional similarity metrics, i.e. DTW and Hausdorff, suffer from quadratic computation complexity, leading to their inability on large-scale data. To solve this problem, many trajectory representation learning techniques are proposed to approximate the metric space while reducing the complexity of similarity computation. Nevertheless, these works are designed based on RNN backend, resulting in a serious performance decline on long trajectories. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based method, namely TrajGAT, to explicitly model the hierarchical spatial structure and improve the performance of long trajectory similarity computation. TrajGAT consists of two main modules, i.e., graph construction and trajectory encoding. For graph construction, TrajGAT first employs PR quadtree to build the hierarchical structure of the whole spatial area, and then constructs a graph for each trajectory based on the original records and the leaf nodes of the quadtree. For trajectory encoding, we replace the self-attention in Transformer with graph attention and design an encoder to represent the generated graph trajectory. With these two modules, TrajGAT can capture the long-term dependencies of trajectories while reducing the GPU memory usage of Transformer. Our experiments on two real-life datasets show that TrajGAT not only improves the performance on long trajectories but also outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on mixture trajectories significantly.|轨迹相似度计算是时空聚类、预测及异常检测等应用中的核心基础任务。传统相似性度量方法（如动态时间规整DTW和豪斯多夫距离Hausdorff）存在二次计算复杂度问题，难以支撑大规模数据处理。针对这一局限性，学界提出了多种轨迹表示学习技术，在保持度量空间近似性的同时降低相似度计算复杂度。然而现有方法均基于循环神经网络（RNN）架构，导致长轨迹处理性能显著下降。本文提出一种新颖的图神经网络方法TrajGAT，通过显式建模层次化空间结构提升长轨迹相似度计算性能。TrajGAT包含两大核心模块：图构建模块与轨迹编码模块。在图构建阶段，系统首先采用PR四叉树建立全域层次化空间结构，随后基于原始轨迹数据与四叉树叶节点为每条轨迹构建专属图结构。在轨迹编码阶段，我们采用图注意力机制替代Transformer中的自注意力机制，设计出可表征图结构轨迹的编码器。通过这种双模块设计，TrajGAT在捕捉轨迹长期依赖关系的同时显著降低了Transformer的GPU内存占用。在两个真实数据集上的实验表明，TrajGAT不仅在长轨迹处理上性能优越，在混合轨迹场景下也显著超越现有最优方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=TrajGAT:+A+Graph-based+Long-term+Dependency+Modeling+Approach+for+Trajectory+Similarity+Computation)|1|

Nevertheless, dealing with long-tail products raises major open technical issues due to data scarcity which preclude the adoption of the mainstream approaches requiring usually a huge amount of data, such as, e.g., deep learning. In this paper, we provide a novel online learning algorithm for dynamic pricing that deals with non-stationary settings due to, e.g., the seasonality or adaptive competitors, and is very efficient in terms of the need for data thanks to assumptions such as, e.g., the monotonicity of the demand curve in the price that are customarily satisfied in long-tail markets. Furthermore, our dynamic pricing algorithm is paired with a clustering algorithm for the long-tail products which aggregates similar products such that the data of all the products of the same cluster are merged and used to choose their best price. We first evaluate our algorithms in an offline synthetic setting, comparing their performance with the state of the art and showing that our algorithms are more robust and data-efficient in long-tail settings. Subsequently, we evaluate our algorithms in an online setting with more than 8,000 products, including popular and long-tail, in an A/B test with humans for about two months. The increase of revenue thanks to our algorithms is about 18% for the popular products and about 90% for the long-tail products.|在多个电子商务场景中，如何为长尾产品有效定价始终是企业的核心任务，业界普遍认为人工智能（AI）将在未来这一领域发挥重要作用。然而，由于长尾产品存在数据稀缺性，处理这类产品会引发重大技术难题——数据匮乏使得需要海量数据支持的主流方法（如深度学习）难以适用。本文提出一种创新的在线学习算法，用于处理因季节性变化或竞争对手策略调整导致的非平稳环境下的动态定价问题；通过引入需求曲线随价格单调变化等长尾市场普遍适用的假设，该算法显著降低了对数据量的需求。此外，我们还将该动态定价算法与长尾产品聚类算法相结合，通过聚合相似产品并将同一聚类中所有产品的数据合并使用，以确定最优定价策略。我们首先在离线模拟环境中评估算法性能，与现有技术对比表明：在长尾场景下，我们的算法具有更强的鲁棒性和数据利用效率。随后，我们开展了为期两个月的在线A/B测试，对包括热门产品和长尾产品在内的8000余件商品进行实证评估。实验结果显示：应用我们的算法后，热门产品收入提升约18%，而长尾产品收入增幅高达约90%。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Pricing+the+Long+Tail+by+Explainable+Product+Aggregation+and+Monotonic+Bandits)|1|

These approaches traditionally model a user's actions on a website as a sequence to predict the user's next action. While theoretically simplistic, these models are quite challenging to deploy in production, commonly requiring streaming infrastructure to reflect the latest user activity and potentially managing mutable data for encoding a user's hidden state. Here we introduce PinnerFormer, a user representation trained to predict a user's future long-term engagement using a sequential model of a user's recent actions. Unlike prior approaches, we adapt our modeling to a batch infrastructure via our new dense all-action loss, modeling long-term future actions instead of next action prediction. We show that by doing so, we significantly close the gap between batch user embeddings that are generated once a day and realtime user embeddings generated whenever a user takes an action. We describe our design decisions via extensive offline experimentation and ablations and validate the efficacy of our approach in A/B experiments showing substantial improvements in Pinterest's user retention and engagement when comparing PinnerFormer against our previous user representation. PinnerFormer is deployed in production as of Fall 2021.|过去几年中，序列模型在个性化推荐系统中的应用日益广泛。这类方法传统上将用户在网站上的行为建模为序列，以预测用户的下一步行为。虽然理论简洁，但这些模型在实际部署中面临诸多挑战——通常需要流式基础设施来反映最新用户活动，并可能需要管理可变数据以编码用户的隐藏状态。本文推出PinnerFormer，这是一种通过用户近期行为序列模型来预测用户长期参与度的用户表征方法。与现有方法不同，我们通过新型密集全行为损失函数将建模适配至批处理基础设施，重点对长期未来行为而非即时下一步行为进行预测。研究表明，这种方法显著缩小了每日生成一次的批量用户嵌入与用户每次行动时实时生成的用户嵌入之间的性能差距。我们通过大量离线实验和消融分析阐释设计决策，并通过A/B实验验证方法有效性——与原有用户表征相比，PinnerFormer为Pinterest平台的用户留存率和参与度带来显著提升。该模型已于2021年秋季正式投入生产环境部署。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=PinnerFormer:+Sequence+Modeling+for+User+Representation+at+Pinterest)|1|

The supervised extraction methods achieve state-of-the-art performance but require large-scale human-annotated training data. Thus, they are restricted for open-domain tasks due to the lack of training data. This work addresses this challenge and simultaneously mines aspect terms, opinion terms, and their correspondence in a joint model. We propose an Open-Domain Aspect-Opinion Co-Mining (ODAO) method with a Double-Layer span extraction framework. Instead of acquiring human annotations, ODAO first generates weak labels for unannotated corpus by employing rules-based on universal dependency parsing. Then, ODAO utilizes this weak supervision to train a double-layer span extraction framework to extract aspect terms (ATE), opinion terms (OTE), and aspect-opinion pairs (AOPE). ODAO applies canonical correlation analysis as an early stopping indicator to avoid the model over-fitting to the noise to tackle the noisy weak supervision. ODAO applies a self-training process to gradually enrich the training data to tackle the weak supervision bias issue. We conduct extensive experiments and demonstrate the power of the proposed ODAO. The results on four benchmark datasets for aspect-opinion co-extraction and pair extraction tasks show that ODAO can achieve competitive or even better performance compared with the state-of-the-art fully supervised methods.|方面意见提取任务从评论中提取方面术语和意见术语。有监督的提取方法取得了最先进的性能，但需要大规模的人工注释的训练数据。因此，由于缺乏训练数据，它们在开放域任务中受到限制。这项工作解决了这个挑战，同时挖掘方面术语，意见术语，以及它们在联合模型中的对应关系。我们提出了一个开放领域的方面-意见共同挖掘(ODAO)方法与双层跨度提取框架。ODAO 不是获取人工注释，而是首先通过使用基于通用依赖解析的规则为未注释的语料库生成弱标签。然后，ODAO 利用这种弱监督训练一个双层跨度提取框架来提取方面术语(ATE)、观点术语(OTE)和方面-观点对(AOPE)。《噪音管制条例》采用典型相关分析作为及早停止的指标，以避免模型过分配合噪音，以对付噪音较大而监管薄弱的情况。ODAO 采用自我训练过程，逐步丰富训练数据，解决监督偏差问题。我们进行了广泛的实验，并演示了所提出的 ODAO 的功能。通过对四个基准数据集的侧面意见协同提取和对提取任务的实验结果表明，ODAO 算法可以获得比现有全监督算法更好的性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Open-Domain+Aspect-Opinion+Co-Mining+with+Double-Layer+Span+Extraction)|1|

However, existing learning-based trajectory similarity learning solutions prioritize spatial similarity over temporal similarity, making them suboptimal for time-aware analyses. To this end, we propose ST2Vec, a representation learning based solution that considers fine-grained spatial and temporal relations between trajectories to enable spatio-temporal similarity computation in road networks. Specifically, ST2Vec encompasses two steps: (i) spatial and temporal modeling that encode spatial and temporal information of trajectories, where a generic temporal modeling module is proposed for the first time; and (ii) spatio-temporal co-attention fusion, where two fusion strategies are designed to enable the generation of unified spatio-temporal embeddings of trajectories. Further, under the guidance of triplet loss, ST2Vec employs curriculum learning in model optimization to improve convergence and effectiveness. An experimental study offers evidence that ST2Vec outperforms state-of-the-art competitors substantially in terms of effectiveness and efficiency, while showing low parameter sensitivity and good model robustness. Moreover, similarity involved case studies including top-k querying and DBSCAN clustering offer further insight into the capabilities of ST2Vec.|基于深度学习的轨迹相似度计算有望比传统相似度计算方法提升效率与适应性。然而现有基于学习的轨迹相似度解决方案往往侧重空间相似性而忽视时间相似性，导致其在时间敏感分析中表现欠佳。为此，我们提出ST2Vec——一种基于表征学习的解决方案，通过细粒度捕捉轨迹间的时空关联关系，实现路网环境下的时空相似度计算。具体而言，ST2Vec包含两个核心步骤：(i) 时空建模阶段首次提出通用时序建模模块，对轨迹的空间与时间信息进行编码；(ii) 时空协同注意力融合阶段设计两种融合策略，生成统一的轨迹时空嵌入向量。在三元组损失函数的指导下，该模型采用课程学习策略进行优化以提升收敛速度与效果。实验研究表明，ST2Vec在效果与效率方面显著优于现有先进方案，同时展现出较低的参数敏感度和良好的模型鲁棒性。此外，通过top-k查询和DBSCAN聚类等涉及相似度计算的案例研究，进一步验证了ST2Vec的实际应用能力。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Spatio-Temporal+Trajectory+Similarity+Learning+in+Road+Networks)|1|

Conventional data-driven approaches for cash-out detection commonly construct a classifier with domain specific feature engineering. To further spot cash-out behaviors in complex scenarios, recent efforts adopt graph models to exploit the interaction relations rich in financial transactions. However, most existing graph-based methods are proposed for online payment activities in internet financial institutions. Moreover, these methods commonly rely on a large amount of online user data, which are not well suitable for the traditional credit card services in commercial banks. In this paper, we focus on discerning fraudulent cash-out users by taking advantage of only the personal credit card data from banks. To alleviate the scarcity of available labeled data, we formulate the cash-out detection problem as identifying dense blocks. First, we define a bipartite multigraph to hold transactions between users and merchants, where cash-out activities generate cyclically intensive and high-volume flows. Second, we give a formal definition of cash-out behaviors from four perspectives: time, capital, cyclicity, and topotaxy. Then, we develop ANTICO, with a class of metrics to capture suspicious signals of the activities and a greedy algorithm to spot suspicious blocks by optimizing the proposed metric. Theoretical analysis shows a provable upper bound of ANTICO on the effectiveness of detecting cash-out users. Experimental results show that ANTICO outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accurately detecting cash-out users on both synthetic and real-world banking data.|套现欺诈指通过非法商户交易进行信用卡资金套取的行为。传统数据驱动检测方法通常需依赖领域特定的特征工程来构建分类器。为应对复杂场景下的套现行为识别，近期研究开始采用图模型挖掘金融交易中丰富的交互关系。然而现有图方法多针对互联网金融平台的线上支付活动设计，且严重依赖大量线上用户数据，难以适用于商业银行传统信用卡业务场景。本文聚焦于仅利用银行个人信用卡数据识别欺诈性套现用户。为缓解标注数据稀缺问题，我们将套现检测任务形式化为稠密块识别问题：首先构建用户-商户二分多重图建模交易关系，其中套现行为会形成周期性密集大额资金流；继而从时间、资金、周期性和拓扑结构四个维度给出套现行为的形式化定义；随后提出ANTICO模型，通过设计综合指标捕捉可疑活动信号，并采用贪心算法优化指标以定位可疑区块。理论分析证明ANTICO在检测效果上具有可证明的上界。实验结果表明，在合成与真实银行数据上，ANTICO在套现用户检测准确率方面均优于现有先进方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Detecting+Cash-out+Users+via+Dense+Subgraphs)|1|

This learning setting limits the applicability and availability of many Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. We generalize the learning task under such setting as a semi-supervised drifted stream learning with short lookback problem (SDSL). SDSL imposes two under-addressed challenges on existing methods in semi-supervised learning and continuous learning: 1) robust pseudo-labeling under gradual shifts and 2) anti-forgetting adaptation with short lookback. To tackle these challenges, we propose a principled and generic generation-replay framework to solve SDSL. To achieve robust pseudo-labeling, we develop a novel pseudo-label classification model to leverage supervised knowledge of previously labeled data, unsupervised knowledge of new data, and, structure knowledge of invariant label semantics. To achieve adaptive anti-forgetting model replay, we propose to view the anti-forgetting adaptation task as a flat region search problem. We propose a novel minimax game-based replay objective function to solve the flat region search problem and develop an effective optimization solver.

The model is characterized by: (1) separate intensity rate modelling for each event type through a parallel structure of continuous time LSTM units; and (2) an event-state interaction mechanism that improves prediction accuracy and enables efficient sampling of the event-state stream. We first demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over traditional stochastic or deep learning models for predicting event type and time of a real world LOB dataset. Using stochastic point sampling from a well trained model, we then develop a realistic deep learning-based LOB simulator that exhibits multiple stylized facts found in real LOB data.|金融市场中的交易主要通过限价订单簿（LOB）执行。LOB是一种基于事件的持续更新系统，记录金融资产当前的需求（买入"报价"）与供给（卖出"要价"）。近年来学界成功将随机点过程与神经网络结合以建模事件流模式，基于此我们提出一种新颖的状态依赖型并行神经霍克斯过程，用于预测LOB事件并生成逼真的LOB数据。该模型具有两大特征：（1）通过并行连续时间LSTM单元结构，为每种事件类型建立独立的强度率模型；（2）采用事件-状态交互机制，既提升预测精度又实现事件-状态流的高效采样。我们首先证明该模型在预测真实LOB数据集的事件类型和发生时间方面，优于传统随机模型或深度学习模型。通过从训练完善的模型中进行随机点采样，我们进一步开发出基于深度学习的逼真LOB模拟器，该模拟器呈现出真实LOB数据中存在的多重典型特征。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=State+Dependent+Parallel+Neural+Hawkes+Process+for+Limit+Order+Book+Event+Stream+Prediction+and+Simulation)|1|
|[Improving Data-driven Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Estimation Under Structure Uncertainty](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539444)|Christopher Tran, Elena Zheleva|Univ Illinois, Chicago, IL 60607 USA|Estimating how a treatment affects units individually, known as heterogeneous treatment effect (HTE) estimation, is an essential part of decision-making and policy implementation. The accumulation of large amounts of data in many domains, such as healthcare and e-commerce, has led to increased interest in developing data-driven algorithms for estimating heterogeneous effects from observational and experimental data. However, these methods often make strong assumptions about the observed features and ignore the underlying causal model structure, which can lead to biased HTE estimation. At the same time, accounting for the causal structure of real-world data is rarely trivial since the causal mechanisms that gave rise to the data are typically unknown. To address this problem, we develop a feature selection method that considers each feature's value for HTE estimation and learns the relevant parts of the causal structure from data. We provide strong empirical evidence that our method improves existing data-driven HTE estimation methods under arbitrary underlying causal structures. Our results on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets show that our feature selection algorithm leads to lower HTE estimation error.|估计处理对个体单元的影响，即异质性处理效应（HTE）估计，是决策和政策实施的关键环节。随着医疗健康和电子商务等领域大规模数据的积累，利用观察性和实验性数据开发数据驱动的异质性效应估计算法受到日益广泛的关注。然而这些方法通常对观测特征做出强假设，且忽略底层因果模型结构，可能导致HTE估计出现偏差。与此同时，由于生成数据的因果机制通常未知，处理现实世界数据的因果结构往往具有挑战性。针对这一问题，我们开发了一种特征选择方法，该方法综合考虑每个特征对HTE估计的价值，并从数据中学习因果结构的相关部分。我们提供了强有力的实证证据，表明在任意底层因果结构下，我们的方法能改进现有数据驱动的HTE估计方法。通过在合成数据、半合成数据和真实数据集上的实验验证，我们的特征选择算法显著降低了HTE估计误差。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Improving+Data-driven+Heterogeneous+Treatment+Effect+Estimation+Under+Structure+Uncertainty)|1|
|[Variational Graph Author Topic Modeling](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539310)|Delvin Ce Zhang, Hady Wirawan Lauw|Singapore Management Univ, Singapore, Singapore|While Variational Graph Auto-Encoder (VGAE) has presented promising ability to learn representations for documents, most existing VGAE methods do not model a latent topic structure and therefore lack semantic interpretability. Exploring hidden topics within documents and discovering key words associated with each topic allow us to develop a semantic interpretation of the corpus. Moreover, documents are usually associated with authors. For example, news reports have journalists specializing in writing certain type of events, academic papers have authors with expertise in certain research topics, etc. Modeling authorship information could benefit topic modeling, since documents by the same authors tend to reveal similar semantics. This observation also holds for documents published on the same venues. However, most topic models ignore the auxiliary authorship and publication venues. Given above two challenges, we propose a Variational Graph Author Topic Model for documents to integrate both semantic interpretability and authorship and venue modeling into a unified VGAE framework. For authorship and venue modeling, we construct a hierarchical multi-layered document graph with both intra- and cross-layer topic propagation. For semantic interpretability, three word relations (contextual, syntactic, semantic) are modeled and constitute three word sub-layers in the document graph. We further propose three alternatives for variational divergence. Experiments verify the effectiveness of our model on supervised and unsupervised tasks.|尽管变分图自编码器（VGAE）在文档表征学习方面展现出强大能力，但现有方法大多未对潜在主题结构建模，导致语义可解释性不足。通过挖掘文档中的隐藏主题并识别各主题关联关键词，可实现语料库的语义解析。此外，文档通常与作者相关联——新闻报道由专攻特定事件类型的记者撰写，学术论文的作者则深耕特定研究领域。由于同一作者的文档往往呈现相似语义特征，作者信息建模有助于提升主题建模效果，这一规律同样适用于同一发布场所的文档。然而现有主题模型普遍忽略作者与发布场所这类辅助信息。

针对上述两个挑战，我们提出面向文档的变分图作者主题模型，将语义可解释性、作者及发布场所建模统一整合至VGAE框架中。在作者与场所建模方面，我们构建了具有层内与跨层主题传播的分层多文档图；在语义可解释性方面，通过建模三种词关系（上下文、句法、语义）构建文档图中的三个词子层。我们进一步提出三种变分散度的替代方案。实验结果表明，该模型在监督与非监督任务中均具有卓越性能。

Existing log-based anomaly detection approaches rely on a few key assumptions on system logs and perform well in some experimental systems. However, real-world industrial systems are often with poor logging quality, in which system logs are noisy and often violate the assumptions of existing approaches. This makes these approaches inefficient. This paper first conducts a comprehensive study on the system logs of three large-scale industrial software systems. Through the study, we identify four typical anti-patterns that affect the detection results the most. Based on these patterns, we propose HiLog, an effective human-in-the-loop log-based anomaly detection approach that integrates human knowledge to augment anomaly detection models. With little human labeling effort, our approach can significantly improve the effectiveness of existing models. Experiment results on three large-scale industrial software systems show that our method improves over 50% precision rate on average.|随着现代软件系统日益复杂，精确检测异常和诊断问题变得至关重要却也更加困难。现有的基于日志的异常检测方法依赖于对系统日志的若干关键假设，在部分实验系统中表现良好。然而，现实工业系统往往存在日志质量不佳的问题，系统日志存在噪声且经常违反现有方法的假设条件，导致这些方法效率低下。本文首先对三个大型工业软件系统的日志进行全面研究，通过分析确定了四种对检测结果影响最大的典型反模式。基于这些模式，我们提出HiLog——一种有效的人机协同日志异常检测方法，通过融入人类知识来增强异常检测模型。该方法仅需少量人工标注即可显著提升现有模型效能。在三个大型工业软件系统上的实验结果表明，我们的方法平均将检测精确率提升了50%以上。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Augmenting+Log-based+Anomaly+Detection+Models+to+Reduce+False+Anomalies+with+Human+Feedback)|1|

Oswald, Anna GonzàlezRosell, Peter Mastracco, Alexander Gorovits, Stacy M.

AgN-DNAs are promising biosensors and fluorophores due to their small sizes, natural compatibility with DNA, and bright fluorescence---the property of absorbing light and re-emitting light of a different color. The sequence of the DNA template acts as a "genome" for AgN-DNAs, tuning the size of the encapsulated silver nanocluster, and thus its fluorescence color. However, current understanding of the AgN-DNA genome is still limited. Only a minority of DNA sequences produce highly fluorescent AgN-DNAs, and the bulky DNA strands and complex DNA-silver interactions make it challenging to use first principles chemical calculations to understand and design AgN-DNAs. Thus, a major challenge for researchers studying these nanomaterials is to develop methods to employ observational data about studied AgN-DNAs to design new nanoclusters for targeted applications. In this work, we present an approach to design AgN-DNAs by employing variational autoencoders (VAEs) as generative models. Specifically, we employ an LSTM-based β-VAE architecture and regularize its latent space to correlate with AgN-DNA properties such as color and brightness. The regularization is adaptive to skewed sample distributions of available observational data along our design axes of properties. We employ our model for design of AgN-DNAs in the near-infrared (NIR) band, where relatively few AgN-DNAs have been observed to date. Wet lab experiments validate that when employed for designing new AgN-DNAs, our model significantly shifts the distribution of AgN-DNA colors towards the NIR while simultaneously achieving bright fluorescence. This work shows that VAE-based generative models are well-suited for the design of AgN-DNAs with multiple targeted properties, with significant potential to advance the promising applications of these nanomaterials for bioimaging, biosensing, and other critical technologies.|DNA稳定的银纳米簇（AgN-DNAs）是由10-30个银原子通过短链合成DNA模板结合形成的纳米材料。因其尺寸微小、与DNA天然兼容且具有明亮的荧光特性（即吸收光线并重新发射不同颜色光线的能力），这类材料在生物传感和荧光标记领域展现出巨大潜力。DNA模板序列如同AgN-DNAs的"基因组"，通过调控封装银纳米簇的尺寸来决定其荧光颜色。然而目前对AgN-DNA基因组的认知仍十分有限：仅有少数DNA序列能产生高荧光性AgN-DNAs，且庞大的DNA链与复杂的银-DNA相互作用使得第一性原理化学计算方法难以有效解析和设计该类材料。因此，如何利用现有观测数据设计具有特定功能的新型纳米簇成为该领域研究者面临的重要挑战。

本研究提出采用变分自编码器（VAE）作为生成模型的设计方法。具体而言，我们采用基于LSTM架构的β-VAE模型，并通过正则化其潜在空间使其与AgN-DNA的光学特性（如颜色和亮度）建立关联。该正则化方法能自适应地调整观测数据在目标设计维度上的偏态分布。我们将该模型应用于近红外波段（NIR）AgN-DNAs的设计——该波段目前观测到的AgN-DNAs数量极为有限。湿实验验证表明，通过模型设计的新型AgN-DNAs其颜色分布显著向近红外波段偏移，同时实现了明亮的荧光发射。这项工作证明基于VAE的生成模型特别适用于设计具有多重目标特性的AgN-DNAs，对于推进该类纳米材料在生物成像、生物传感等关键技术领域的应用具有重要潜力。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=DNA-Stabilized+Silver+Nanocluster+Design+via+Regularized+Variational+Autoencoders)|1|

In such a scenario, designing an identification approach to do extremely accurate offline user identification is critical. Most scenarios use faces to identify users and previous algorithms are mainly based on visual features and computer-vision models. However, due to the large variations such as pose, illumination and occlusions in offline scenarios, it remains a challenging problem for existing computer-vision algorithms to get a satisfying accuracy in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, billion-scale candidate users also require high efficiency and high accuracy for the approach. In offline scenarios, users, venues and their different kinds of interactions can form a heterogeneous graph. Mining the graph can tell much information about users' offline habits and behaviors, which can be regarded as a great information supplement for user identification. In this paper, we elaborately design an offline identification framework considering two aspects. First, given a scanning face, we propose a 'local-global' retrieval mechanism to find one user from billion-scale candidate users. Second and most importantly, to make the verification between the scanning face, the retrieved user and the venue, we propose a novel Wide & Deep Based Graph Convolution Network to model both the visual information and the heterogeneous graph.

These simulations are pivotal in industrial applications such as petroleum production, where fast and accurate models are needed for high-stake decision making, for example, for well placement optimization and field development planning. Classical finite difference numerical simulators require massive computational resources to model large-scale real-world reservoirs. Alternatively, streamline simulators and data-driven surrogate models are computationally more efficient by relying on approximate physics models, however they are insufficient to model complex reservoir dynamics at scale. Here we introduce Hybrid Graph Network Simulator (HGNS), which is a data-driven surrogate model for learning reservoir simulations of 3D subsurface fluid flows. To model complex reservoir dynamics at both local and global scale, HGNS consists of a subsurface graph neural network (SGNN) to model the evolution of fluid flows, and a 3D-U-Net to model the evolution of pressure. HGNS is able to scale to grids with millions of cells per time step, two orders of magnitude higher than previous surrogate models, and can accurately predict the fluid flow for tens of time steps (years into the future). Using an industry-standard subsurface flow dataset (SPE-10) with 1.1 million cells, we demonstrate that HGNS is able to reduce the inference time up to 18 times compared to standard subsurface simulators, and that it outperforms other learning-based models by reducing long-term prediction errors by up to 21%.|地下模拟通过计算模型预测流体（如油、水、气）在多孔介质中的流动。这类模拟在石油开采等工业应用中具有关键作用，其快速精确的建模能力直接影响钻井位置优化和油田开发规划等高风险决策。传统有限差分数值模拟器需消耗大量计算资源来建模大规模实际储层；流线模拟器和数据驱动代理模型虽通过近似物理模型提升计算效率，但难以有效模拟复杂的大规模储层动态。本研究提出混合图网络模拟器（HGNS），这是一种数据驱动的代理模型，可学习三维地下流体流动的储层模拟。为同步实现局部与全局尺度下的复杂储层动态建模，HGNS采用地下图神经网络（SGNN）模拟流体流动演化，并利用3D-U型网络模拟压力演化。该模型可扩展至单时间步百万级网格的模拟规模（较先前代理模型提升两个数量级），并能精准预测数十个时间步（未来数年）的流体流动趋势。基于包含110万个网格单元的行业标准地下流动数据集（SPE-10），我们证明HGNS相比标准地下模拟器可将推理时间缩短最多18倍，同时通过将长期预测误差降低最多21%，其性能显著优于其他基于学习的模型。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Learning+Large-scale+Subsurface+Simulations+with+a+Hybrid+Graph+Network+Simulator)|1|

|[Submodular Feature Selection for Partial Label Learning](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539292)|WeiXuan Bao, JunYi Hang, MinLing Zhang|Southeast University & Key Laboratory of Computer Network and Information Integration (Southeast University), Ministry of Education, Nanjing, China|Partial label learning induces a multi-class classifier from training examples each associated with a candidate label set where the ground-truth label is concealed. Feature selection improves the generalization ability of learning system via selecting essential features for classification from the original feature set, while the task of partial label feature selection is challenging due to ambiguous labeling information. In this paper, the first attempt towards partial label feature selection is investigated via mutual-information-based dependency maximization. Specifically, the proposed approach SAUTE iteratively maximizes the dependency between selected features and labeling information, where the value of mutual information is estimated from confidence-based latent variable inference. In each iteration, the near-optimal features are selected greedily according to properties of submodular mutual information function, while the density of latent label variable is inferred with the help of updated labeling confidences over candidate labels by resorting to kNN aggregation in the induced lower-dimensional feature space. Extensive experiments over synthetic as well as real-world partial label data sets show that the generalization ability of well-established partial label learning algorithms can be significantly improved after coupling with the proposed feature selection approach.|部分标签学习从训练样本中归纳出一个多类分类器，每个样本与一个隐藏地面真实标签的候选标签集相关联。特征选择通过从原始特征集中选择分类所需的基本特征来提高学习系统的泛化能力，而部分标记特征选择则由于标记信息不明确而面临挑战。本文首次研究了基于互信息的依赖最大化方法在部分标签特征选择中的应用。特别地，提出的方法 SAUTE 迭代地最大化选择的特征和标记信息之间的依赖性，其中互信息的价值是估计基于置信度的潜变量推断。在每次迭代中，根据子模互信息函数的性质贪婪地选择接近最优的特征，利用诱导的低维特征空间中的 kNN 聚集，借助候选标签上更新的标签置信度推断潜在标签变量的密度。通过对合成和实际部分标签数据集的大量实验表明，与所提出的特征选择方法相结合，可以显著提高已有部分标签学习算法的泛化能力。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Submodular+Feature+Selection+for+Partial+Label+Learning)|1|
|[Practical Lossless Federated Singular Vector Decomposition over Billion-Scale Data](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539402)|Di Chai, Leye Wang, Junxue Zhang, Liu Yang, Shuowei Cai, Kai Chen, Qiang Yang|Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China; Peking University, Beijing, China|With the enactment of privacy-preserving regulations, e.g., GDPR, federated SVD is proposed to enable SVD-based applications over different data sources without revealing the original data. However, many SVD-based applications cannot be well supported by existing federated SVD solutions. The crux is that these solutions, adopting either differential privacy (DP) or homomorphic encryption (HE), suffer from accuracy loss caused by unremovable noise or degraded efficiency due to inflated data. In this paper, we propose FedSVD, a practical lossless federated SVD method over billion-scale data, which can simultaneously achieve lossless accuracy and high efficiency. At the heart of FedSVD is a lossless matrix masking scheme delicately designed for SVD: 1) While adopting the masks to protect private data, FedSVD completely removes them from the final results of SVD to achieve lossless accuracy; and 2) As the masks do not inflate the data, FedSVD avoids extra computation and communication overhead during the factorization to maintain high efficiency. Experiments with real-world datasets show that FedSVD is over 10000x faster than the HE-based method and has 10 orders of magnitude smaller error than the DP-based solution (ε=0.1, δ=0.1) on SVD tasks. We further build and evaluate FedSVD over three real-world applications: principal components analysis (PCA), linear regression (LR), and latent semantic analysis (LSA), to show its superior performance in practice. On federated LR tasks, compared with two state-of-the-art solutions: FATE [17] and SecureML [19], FedSVD-LR is 100x faster than SecureML and 10x faster than FATE.|随着 GDPR 等隐私保护规则的制定，联邦奇异值分解被提出，以使基于奇异值分解的应用能够在不同数据源之间进行而不暴露原始数据。然而，现有的联邦 SVD 解决方案不能很好地支持许多基于 SVD 的应用程序。问题的关键是，这些解决方案，无论是采用差分隐私(DP)或同态加密(HE) ，都会受到不可去除的噪声或因数据膨胀而导致效率降低所造成的精度损失。在本文中，我们提出了 FedSVD，一种实用的无损联邦 SVD 方法，它可以同时达到无损精度和高效率。FedSVD 的核心是一种为 SVD 精心设计的无损矩阵掩蔽方案: 1)在采用掩蔽保护私有数据的同时，FedSVD 从 SVD 的最终结果中完全去除掩蔽，以实现无损精度; 2)由于掩蔽不会使数据膨胀，FedSVD 避免了因子分解过程中的额外计算和通信开销，保持了高效率。实际数据集的实验表明，在奇异值分解任务中，FedSVD 比基于 HE 的方法快10000倍以上，并且比基于 DP 的方法(ε = 0.1，δ = 0.1)误差小10数量级。我们进一步构建和评估 FedSVD 在三个现实世界中的应用: 主成分分析(PCA)、线性回归分析(LR)和潜在语义学分析(LSA) ，以显示其在实践中的卓越性能。在联邦 LR 任务上，与 FATE [17]和 SecureML [19]这两种最先进的解决方案相比，FedSVD-LR 比 SecureML 快100倍，比 FATE 快10倍。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Practical+Lossless+Federated+Singular+Vector+Decomposition+over+Billion-Scale+Data)|1|

The problem aims to find the optimal join order with the minimum cost, and usually becomes an NP-hard problem due to the exponentially increasing search space. Recent advanced studies attempt to use deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to generate better join plans than the ones provided by conventional query optimizers. However, DRL-based methods require time-consuming training, which is not suitable for online applications that need frequent periodic re-training. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, namely efficient Join Order selection learninG with Graph-basEd Representation (JOGGER). We firstly construct a schema graph based on the primary-foreign key relationships, from which table representations are well learned to capture the correlations between tables. The second component is the state representation, where a graph convolutional network is utilized to encode the query graph and a tailored-tree-based attention module is designed to encode the join plan. To speed up the convergence of DRL training process, we exploit the idea of curriculum learning, in which queries are incrementally added into the training set according to the level of difficulties.

Very recently, it has been demonstrated that integrating logical rules into regular learning tasks can further enhance learning performance in a label-efficient manner. Many attempts have been made to learn logical rules automatically from knowledge graphs (KGs). However, a majority of existing methods entirely rely on observed rule instances to define the score function for rule evaluation and thus lack generalization ability and suffer from severe computational inefficiency. Instead of completely relying on rule instances for rule evaluation, RLogic defines a predicate representation learning-based scoring model, which is trained by sampled rule instances. In addition, RLogic incorporates one of the most significant properties of logical rules, the deductive nature, into rule learning, which is critical especially when a rule lacks supporting evidence. To push deductive reasoning deeper into rule learning, RLogic breaks a big sequential model into small atomic models in a recursive way. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that RLogic is superior to existing state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness.|逻辑规则被广泛用于表示领域知识与假设，这是基于符号推理的人类智能的基础。最新研究表明，将逻辑规则融入常规学习任务中能以标签高效的方式进一步提升学习性能。目前已有诸多尝试从知识图谱（KG）中自动学习逻辑规则，但现有方法大多完全依赖观察到的规则实例来定义规则评估的评分函数，导致泛化能力不足且存在严重计算低效问题。RLogic摒弃了完全依赖规则实例进行评估的模式，定义了基于谓词表示学习的评分模型，并通过采样规则实例进行训练。此外，RLogic将逻辑规则最核心的特性——演绎性质融入规则学习过程，这对于缺乏支撑证据的规则尤为重要。为进一步将演绎推理深度整合至规则学习，RLogic以递归方式将大型序列模型分解为小型原子模型。大量实验证明，RLogic在效率与效能方面均优于现有最先进算法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=RLogic:+Recursive+Logical+Rule+Learning+from+Knowledge+Graphs)|1|

Gupta, Dezhi Hong|Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Amazon, Seattle, WA 98109 USA|Time-series data contains temporal order information that can guide representation learning for predictive end tasks (e.g., classification, regression). Recently, there are some attempts to leverage such order information to first pre-train time-series models by reconstructing time-series values of randomly masked time segments, followed by an end-task fine-tuning on the same dataset, demonstrating improved end-task performance. However, this learning paradigm decouples data reconstruction from the end task. We argue that the representations learnt in this way are not informed by the end task and may, therefore, be sub-optimal for the end-task performance. In fact, the importance of different timestamps can vary significantly in different end tasks. We believe that representations learnt by reconstructing important timestamps would be a better strategy for improving end-task performance. In this work, we propose TARNet, Task-Aware Reconstruction Network, a new model using Transformers to learn task-aware data reconstruction that augments end-task performance. Specifically, we design a data-driven masking strategy that uses self-attention score distribution from end-task training to sample timestamps deemed important by the end task. Then, we mask out data at those timestamps and reconstruct them, thereby making the reconstruction task-aware. This reconstruction task is trained alternately with the end task at every epoch, sharing parameters in a single model, allowing the representation learnt through reconstruction to improve end-task performance. Extensive experiments on tens of classification and regression datasets show that TARNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models across all evaluation metrics.|时间序列数据包含可指导预测性终端任务（如分类、回归）表征学习的时序信息。近期研究尝试利用这种顺序信息，首先通过重构随机掩码时间段的时间序列值对模型进行预训练，然后在同一数据集上进行终端任务微调，证实能提升终端任务性能。然而这种学习范式将数据重构与终端任务相分离。我们认为这种方式学到的表征未融入终端任务信息，可能导致对终端任务性能的次优解。实际上，不同时间戳的重要性会随终端任务的变化而产生显著差异。我们相信通过重构重要时间戳来学习表征，将成为提升终端任务性能的更优策略。本研究提出任务感知重构网络TARNet——一种使用Transformer架构学习任务感知型数据重构以增强终端任务性能的新模型。具体而言，我们设计了一种数据驱动的掩码策略：利用终端任务训练中的自注意力分数分布，对终端任务认定的重要时间戳进行采样，随后掩蔽这些时间戳的数据并进行重构，从而使重构过程具备任务感知能力。该重构任务与终端任务在每个训练周期交替进行，通过单一模型的参数共享，使通过重构学到的表征能够持续优化终端任务性能。在数十个分类和回归数据集上的大量实验表明，TARNet在所有评估指标上均显著优于当前最先进的基线模型。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=TARNet:+Task-Aware+Reconstruction+for+Time-Series+Transformer)|1|

In our research, we propose the Sufficiency-Blocks (S-Blocks) to be applied across the depth of Suf-ViT to disentangle and discard task-irrelevant information accurately. Besides, to boost the training of Suf-ViT, we formulate a Sufficient-Reduction Loss (SRLoss) leveraging the concept of Mutual Information (MI) that enables Suf-ViT to extract more reliable sufficient representations by removing task-irrelevant information.

Recently, there have been rising concerns on the distributional discrepancies across different clients, which could even cause counterproductive consequences when collaborating with others. While it is not necessarily that collaborating with all clients will achieve the best performance, in this paper, we study a rational collaboration called ``collaboration equilibrium'' (CE), where smaller collaboration coalitions are formed. Each client collaborates with certain members who maximally improve the model learning and isolates the others who make little contribution. We propose the concept of benefit graph which describes how each client can benefit from collaborating with other clients and advance a Pareto optimization approach to identify the optimal collaborators. Then we theoretically prove that we can reach a CE from the benefit graph through an iterative graph operation. Our framework provides a new way of setting up collaborations in a research network.

These methods rely on historical labeled data and cannot accurately predict events when data are limited or of poor quality. Studying causal effects between events goes beyond correlation analysis and can contribute to a more robust prediction of events. However, incorporating causality analysis in data-driven event forecasting is challenging due to several factors: (i) Events occur in a complex and dynamic social environment. Many unobserved variables, i.e., hidden confounders, affect both potential causes and outcomes. (ii) Given spatiotemporal non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data, modeling hidden confounders for accurate causal effect estimation is not trivial. In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework that integrates causal effect estimation into event forecasting. We first study the problem of Individual Treatment Effect (ITE) estimation from observational event data with spatiotemporal attributes and present a novel causal inference model to estimate ITEs. We then incorporate the learned event-related causal information into event prediction as prior knowledge. Two robust learning modules, including a feature reweighting module and an approximate constraint loss, are introduced to enable prior knowledge injection. We evaluate the proposed causal inference model on real-world event datasets and validate the effectiveness of proposed robust learning modules in event prediction by feeding learned causal information into different deep learning methods. Experimental results demonstrate the strengths of the proposed causal inference model for ITE estimation in societal events and showcase the beneficial properties of robust learning modules in societal event forecasting.|基于数据驱动的社会事件预测方法通过利用相关历史信息来预测未来事件。这类方法依赖历史标注数据，当数据有限或质量较差时难以实现准确预测。研究事件间的因果关系不仅能突破相关性分析的局限，更有助于提升事件预测的稳健性。然而将因果分析融入数据驱动的事件预测存在多重挑战：(一) 事件发生于复杂动态的社会环境中，大量未观测变量（即隐藏混淆因子）会同时影响潜在原因与结果；(二) 面对时空非独立同分布(non-IID)数据，为精确估计因果效应而建模隐藏混淆因子具有显著难度。本研究提出一个将因果效应估计融入事件预测的深度学习框架：首先针对具有时空属性的观测事件数据研究个体处理效应(ITE)估计问题，提出新型因果推理模型进行ITE估算；随后将学习到的事件因果信息作为先验知识嵌入事件预测过程。通过引入特征重加权模块和近似约束损失函数两个稳健学习模块，实现了先验知识的有效注入。我们在真实事件数据集上评估了所提出的因果推理模型，并通过将习得的因果信息输入不同深度学习方法，验证了稳健学习模块在事件预测中的有效性。实验结果表明：所提出的因果推理模型在社会事件ITE估计方面具有显著优势，且稳健学习模块在社会事件预测中展现出多重有益特性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Robust+Event+Forecasting+with+Spatiotemporal+Confounder+Learning)|1|

We evaluate the KGSSL framework in the context of stream flow modeling using CAMELS (Catchment Attributes and MEteorology for Large-sample Studies) which is a widely used hydrology benchmark dataset. Specifically, KGSSL outperforms baseline by 16% in predicting missing characteristics. Furthermore, in the context of forward modelling, KGSSL inferred characteristics provide a 35% improvement in performance over a standard baseline when the static characteristic are unknown.|机器学习正开始在水文流域径流预测等环境应用中提供最先进的性能表现。然而，由于主导水文过程存在变异性（这些过程最好通过一系列与过程相关的流域特征来捕捉），在实践中构建精确的大尺度径流模型仍然面临挑战。现有流域特征存在噪声和不确定性等诸多问题，对模型性能产生不利影响。为应对上述挑战，本文提出了一种新颖的知识引导自监督学习（KGSSL）逆向框架，可从驱动因子（输入）和响应（输出）数据中提取系统特征。该首创框架即使在特征数据损坏或缺失的情况下仍能实现稳健性能。我们使用水文领域广泛应用的基准数据集CAMELS（大样本研究集水区属性与气象数据），在径流建模场景中对KGSSL框架进行评估。具体而言：在预测缺失特征方面，KGSSL较基线方法性能提升16%；在前向建模场景中，当静态特征未知时，采用KGSSL推断特征可使模型性能较标准基线提升35%。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Robust+Inverse+Framework+using+Knowledge-guided+Self-Supervised+Learning:+An+application+to+Hydrology)|1|

This allows effective utilization of the strong language modeling capability of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs).

The resultant framework - which we call Edge-augmented Graph Transformer (EGT) - can directly accept, process and output structural information of arbitrary form, which is important for effective learning on graph-structured data. Our model exclusively uses global self-attention as an aggregation mechanism rather than static localized convolutional aggregation. This allows for unconstrained long-range dynamic interactions between nodes. Moreover, the edge channels allow the structural information to evolve from layer to layer, and prediction tasks on edges/links can be performed directly from the output embeddings of these channels. We verify the performance of EGT in a wide range of graph-learning experiments on benchmark datasets, in which it outperforms Convolutional/Message-Passing Graph Neural Networks. EGT sets a new state-of-the-art for the quantum-chemical regression task on the OGB-LSC PCQM4Mv2 dataset containing 3.8 million molecular graphs.

In this paper, we propose the first frequentist-based approach named JuryGCN in quantifying the uncertainty of GCN, where the key idea is to quantify the uncertainty of a node as the width of confidence interval by a jackknife estimator. Moreover, we leverage the influence functions to estimate the change in GCN parameters without re-training to scale up the computation. The proposed JuryGCN is capable of quantifying uncertainty deterministically without modifying the GCN architecture or introducing additional parameters. We perform extensive experimental evaluation on real-world datasets in the tasks of both active learning and semi-supervised node classification, which demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.|图卷积网络（GCN）在众多实际应用中展现出卓越的实证性能。现有大多数GCN研究主要关注精度指标，却忽视了模型对其预测结果的置信度或不确定性评估。作为可信图挖掘的基石，GCN的不确定性量化研究尚未得到充分探索，现有少量尝试要么无法提供确定性量化，要么需要通过引入额外参数或改变网络架构来调整训练流程。本文提出首个基于频率学派理论的GCN不确定性量化方法JuryGCN，其核心思想是通过折刀估计量将节点不确定性量化为置信区间宽度。此外，我们利用影响函数无需重新训练即可估计GCN参数变化，从而有效提升计算效率。所提出的JuryGCN能够在保持GCN架构不变、不引入额外参数的前提下实现确定性不确定性量化。我们在主动学习和半监督节点分类任务中基于真实数据集进行了广泛实验评估，结果验证了该方法的有效性。

The proposed network introduces a two-layer graph: the first layer is a graph of GO terms where each node is also a graph (gene graph). Such a Graph-in-Graph network can derive the biological functions of GO terms and generate proper descriptions. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed network, we build three large-scale benchmark datasets.

Existing graph neural network based methods mainly focus on classifying unlabeled nodes within fixed classes with abundant labeling. However, in many practical scenarios, graph evolves with emergence of new nodes and edges. Novel classes appear incrementally along with few labeling due to its newly emergence or lack of exploration. In this paper, we focus on this challenging but practical graph few-shot class-incremental learning (GFSCIL) problem and propose a novel method called Geometer. Instead of replacing and retraining the fully connected neural network classifer, Geometer predicts the label of a node by finding the nearest class prototype. Prototype is a vector representing a class in the metric space. With the pop-up of novel classes, Geometer learns and adjusts the attention-based prototypes by observing the geometric proximity, uniformity and separability. Teacher-student knowledge distillation and biased sampling are further introduced to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and unbalanced labeling problem respectively. Experimental results on four public datasets demonstrate that Geometer achieves a substantial improvement of 9.46% to 27.60% over state-of-the-art methods.|随着图数据规模的急剧扩张，节点分类在现实应用中的重要性日益凸显。现有基于图神经网络的方法主要专注于在具有充足标注信息的固定类别中对未标记节点进行分类。然而在实际场景中，图结构往往随着新节点和边的出现而动态演化。由于新类别的出现或探索不足，这些类别通常以增量方式出现且仅含少量标注样本。本文针对这一具有挑战性但实用性强的图少样本类增量学习（GFSCIL）问题，提出名为Geometer的创新解决方案。该方法摒弃了替换和重新训练全连接神经网络分类器的传统思路，通过寻找最近类别原型进行节点标签预测。原型是指在度量空间中表征类别的向量向量。面对新类别的持续出现，Geometer通过观察几何邻近性、均匀性和可分离性来学习并调整基于注意力的原型。此外引入师生知识蒸馏机制应对灾难性遗忘问题，采用偏置采样策略解决标注不平衡问题。在四个公开数据集上的实验表明，Geometer相较最先进方法实现了9.46%至27.60%的显著性能提升。

Due to the high cost of data collection, some developing cities have few available data, which makes it infeasible to train a well-performed model. To address this challenge, cross-city knowledge transfer has shown its promise, where the model learned from data-sufficient cities is leveraged to benefit the learning process of data-scarce cities. However, the spatio-temporal graphs among different cities show irregular structures and varied features, which limits the feasibility of existing Few-Shot Learning (FSL) methods. Therefore, we propose a model-agnostic few-shot learning framework for spatio-temporal graph called ST-GFSL. Specifically, to enhance feature extraction by transfering cross-city knowledge, ST-GFSL proposes to generate non-shared parameters based on node-level meta knowledge. The nodes in target city transfer the knowledge via parameter matching, retrieving from similar spatio-temporal characteristics. Furthermore, we propose to reconstruct the graph structure during meta-learning. The graph reconstruction loss is defined to guide structure-aware learning, avoiding structure deviation among different datasets. We conduct comprehensive experiments on four traffic speed prediction benchmarks and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of ST-GFSL compared with state-of-the-art methods.|时空图学习是处理交通流量、出租车需求及空气质量预测等城市计算任务的核心方法。由于数据采集成本高昂，部分发展中城市的可用数据稀缺，导致难以训练出高性能模型。为应对这一挑战，跨城市知识迁移方法展现出巨大潜力——通过利用从数据充足城市习得的模型来优化数据匮乏城市的学习过程。然而，不同城市的时空图具有不规则结构和差异化特征，限制了现有少样本学习（FSL）方法的适用性。为此，我们提出一种模型无关的时空图少样本学习框架ST-GFSL。该框架通过基于节点级元知识生成非共享参数以增强跨城市知识迁移的特征提取能力，目标城市节点通过参数匹配机制，从相似的时空特征中检索并迁移知识。此外，我们提出在元学习过程中重构图结构，通过定义图重构损失函数指导结构感知学习，避免不同数据集间的结构偏差。在四个交通速度预测基准上的综合实验表明，ST-GFSL相较现有最先进方法具有显著优势。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Spatio-Temporal+Graph+Few-Shot+Learning+with+Cross-City+Knowledge+Transfer)|1|

Deep learning models have greatly outperformed many traditional models, but these black-box models generally lack explainability in prediction and decision making. To reveal the underlying trend with understandable mathematical expressions, scientists and economists tend to use partial differential equations (PDEs) to explain the highly nonlinear dynamics of sequential patterns. However, it usually requires domain expert knowledge and a series of simplified assumptions, which is not always practical and can deviate from the ever-changing world. Is it possible to learn the differential relations from data dynamically to explain the time-evolving dynamics?

Particularly, this framework is comprised of learnable differential blocks, named P-blocks, which is proved to be able to approximate any time-evolving complex continuous functions in theory. Moreover, to capture the dynamics shift, this framework introduces a meta-learning controller to dynamically optimize the hyper-parameters of a hybrid PDE model. Extensive experiments on times series forecasting of financial, engineering, and health data show that our model can provide valuable interpretability and achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art models.

Conventional research mainly focuses on developing methods for the extraction and registration tasks separately under supervised settings. The performance of these methods highly depends on the amount of training samples and visual inspections performed by experts for error correction. However, in many medical studies, collecting voxel-level labels and conducting manual quality control in high-dimensional neuroimages (eg 3D MRI) are very expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, brain extraction and registration are highly related tasks in neuroimaging data and should be solved collectively. In this paper, we study the problem of unsupervised collective extraction and registration in neuroimaging data. We propose a unified end-to-end framework, called ERNet (Extraction-Registration Network), to jointly optimize the extraction and registration tasks, allowing feedback between them. Specifically, we use a pair of multi-stage extraction and registration modules to learn the extraction mask and transformation, where the extraction network improves the extraction accuracy incrementally and the registration network successively warps the extracted image until it is well-aligned with the target image.

However, most GNN methods are sensitive to the noise of graph structures. Graph structure learning (GSL) is then introduced for robustification, which contains two major parts: recovering the optimal graph and fine-tuning the GNN parameters on this generated graph for the downstream task. Nonetheless, most of the existing GSL solutions merely focus on the node features during the first module for graph generation and exploit label information only by back-propagation during the second module for GNN training. They neglect the different roles that labeled and unlabeled nodes could play in GSL for the semi-supervised task, leading to a sub-optimal graph under this setting. In this paper, we give a precise definition on the optimality of the refined graph and provide the exact form of an optimal asymmetric graph structure designed explicitly for the semi-supervised node classification by distinguishing the different roles of labeled and unlabeled nodes through theoretical analysis.

Utilizing MARL algorithms to coordinate multiple control units in the grid, which is able to handle rapid changes of power systems, has been widely studied in active voltage control task recently. However, existing approaches based on MARL ignore the unique nature of the grid and achieve limited performance.

In practice, real-world graphs generally follow the long-tail distribution, where a large number of classes only consist of limited labeled nodes. Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved significant improvements in node classification, their performance decreases substantially in such a few-shot scenario. The main reason can be attributed to the vast generalization gap between meta-training and meta-test due to the task variance caused by different node/class distributions in meta-tasks (i.e., node-level and class-level variance). Therefore, to effectively alleviate the impact of task variance, we propose a task-adaptive node classification framework under the few-shot learning setting. Specifically, we first accumulate meta-knowledge across classes with abundant labeled nodes. Then we transfer such knowledge to the classes with limited labeled nodes via our proposed task-adaptive modules. In particular, to accommodate the different node/class distributions among meta-tasks, we propose three essential modules to perform node-level, class-level, and task-level adaptations in each meta-task, respectively. In this way, our framework can conduct adaptations to different meta-tasks and thus advance the model generalization performance on meta-test tasks.

To combat the deadly opioid epidemic, a state-run prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) has been established to alleviate the drug over-prescribing problem in the US. Although PDMP provides a detailed prescription history related to opioids, it is still not enough to prevent opioid overdose because it cannot predict over-prescribing risk. In addition, existing machine learning-based methods mainly focus on drug doses while ignoring other prescribing patterns behind patients' historical records, thus resulting in suboptimal performance. To this end, we propose a novel model DDHGNN - Disentangled Dynamic Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network, for over-prescribing prediction. Specifically, we abstract the PDMP data into a dynamic heterogeneous graph which comprehensively depicts the prescribing and dispensing (P&D) relationships. Then, we design a dynamic heterogeneous graph neural network to learn patients' representations. Furthermore, we devise an adversarial disentangler to learn a disentangled representation which is particularly related to the prescribing patterns. Extensive experiments on a 1-year anonymous PDMP data demonstrate that DDHGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, revealing its promising future in preventing opioid overdose.|阿片类药物（如奥施康定和吗啡）是具有强成瘾性的处方药，易因开具过量导致药物滥用。近年来，美国阿片类药物危机日益严峻，相关致死率呈惊人增长态势。为应对这一致命危机，各州建立了处方药监控项目（PDMP）以缓解药物过量开具问题。尽管PDMP能提供详尽的阿片类药物处方记录，但其无法预测过量开具风险，仍不足以阻止药物滥用。现有机器学习方法主要关注药物剂量，却忽视了患者历史记录背后的其他处方模式，导致预测效果欠佳。为此，我们提出新型模型DDHGNN——解耦动态异质图神经网络，用于预测处方过量风险。具体而言，我们将PDMP数据抽象为动态异质图，全面描述处方与配药（P&D）关系；继而设计动态异质图神经网络学习患者表征；进一步开发对抗解耦器，获取与处方模式特异性相关的解耦表征。基于一年期匿名PDMP数据的大量实验表明，DDHGNN性能优于现有前沿方法，展现出其在预防阿片类药物滥用方面的应用潜力。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Disentangled+Dynamic+Heterogeneous+Graph+Learning+for+Opioid+Overdose+Prediction)|1|
|[Multi-fidelity Hierarchical Neural Processes](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539364)|Dongxia Wu, Matteo Chinazzi, Alessandro Vespignani, YiAn Ma, Rose Yu|Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Northeastern Univ, Boston, MA USA|Science and engineering fields use computer simulation extensively. These simulations are often run at multiple levels of sophistication to balance accuracy and efficiency. Multi-fidelity surrogate modeling reduces the computational cost by fusing different simulation outputs. Cheap data generated from low-fidelity simulators can be combined with limited high-quality data generated by an expensive high-fidelity simulator. Existing methods based on Gaussian processes rely on strong assumptions of the kernel functions and can hardly scale to high-dimensional settings. We propose Multi-fidelity Hierarchical Neural Processes (MF-HNP), a unified neural latent variable model for multi-fidelity surrogate modeling. MF-HNP inherits the flexibility and scalability of Neural Processes. The latent variables transform the correlations among different fidelity levels from observations to latent space. The predictions across fidelities are conditionally independent given the latent states. It helps alleviate the error propagation issue in existing methods. MF-HNP is flexible enough to handle non-nested high dimensional data at different fidelity levels with varying input and output dimensions. We evaluate MF-HNP on epidemiology and climate modeling tasks, achieving competitive performance in terms of accuracy and uncertainty estimation. In contrast to deep Gaussian Processes with only low-dimensional (< 10) tasks, our method shows great promise for speeding up high-dimensional complex simulations (over 7000 for epidemiology modeling and 45000 for climate modeling).|科学与工程领域广泛采用计算机仿真技术。为平衡精度与效率，这些仿真通常会在多个精度层级上运行。多保真度代理建模通过融合不同仿真输出，有效降低了计算成本。该方法能将低成本低精度模拟器生成的大量数据，与高成本高精度模拟器生成的有限高质量数据相结合。现有基于高斯过程的方法依赖核函数的强假设，难以扩展到高维场景。我们提出多保真度分层神经过程（MF-HNP），这是一种用于多保真度代理建模的统一神经隐变量模型。MF-HNP继承了神经过程的灵活性和可扩展性，通过隐变量将不同保真度层级间的相关性从观测空间转换到隐空间。在给定隐状态的条件下，跨保真度的预测具有条件独立性，这有助于缓解现有方法中的误差传播问题。MF-HNP能够灵活处理非嵌套的高维数据，适应不同保真度层级下变化的输入输出维度。我们在流行病学和气候建模任务上评估MF-HNP，其在预测精度和不确定性估计方面均表现出竞争优势。与仅能处理低维任务（<10维）的深度高斯过程相比，我们的方法在加速高维复杂仿真方面展现出巨大潜力（流行病学建模超过7000维，气候建模达45000维）。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Multi-fidelity+Hierarchical+Neural+Processes)|1|

E-commerce platforms display organic search results and advertisements (ads), collectively called items, together as a mixed list. The items displayed around the predicted ad, i.e. external items, may affect the user clicking on the predicted. Previous CTR models assume the user click only relies on the ad itself, which overlooks the effects of external items, referred to as external effects, or externalities. During the advertising prediction, the organic results have been generated by the organic system, while the final displayed ads on multiple ad slots have not been figured out, which leads to two challenges: 1) the predicted (target) ad may win any ad slot, bringing about diverse externalities. 2) external ads are undetermined, resulting in incomplete externalities. Facing the above challenges, inspired by the Transformer, we propose EXternality TRansformer (EXTR) which regards target ad with all slots as query and external items as key&value to model externalities in all exposure situations in parallel. Furthermore, we design a Potential Allocation Generator (PAG) for EXTR, to learn the allocation of potential external ads to complete the externalities. Extensive experimental results on Alibaba datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of externalities in the task of CTR prediction and illustrate that our proposed approach can bring significant profits to the real-world e-commerce platform.

|[Debiasing the Cloze Task in Sequential Recommendation with Bidirectional Transformers](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539430)|Khalil Damak, Sami Khenissi, Olfa Nasraoui|University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA|Bidirectional Transformer architectures are state-of-the-art sequential recommendation models that use a bi-directional representation capacity based on the Cloze task, a.k.a. Masked Language Modeling. The latter aims to predict randomly masked items within the sequence. Because they assume that the true interacted item is the most relevant one, an exposure bias results, where non-interacted items with low exposure propensities are assumed to be irrelevant. The most common approach to mitigating exposure bias in recommendation has been Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS), which consists of down-weighting the interacted predictions in the loss function in proportion to their propensities of exposure, yielding a theoretically unbiased learning. In this work, we argue and prove that IPS does not extend to sequential recommendation because it fails to account for the temporal nature of the problem. We then propose a novel propensity scoring mechanism, which can theoretically debias the Cloze task in sequential recommendation. Finally we empirically demonstrate the debiasing capabilities of our proposed approach and its robustness to the severity of exposure bias.|双向转换器体系结构是最先进的顺序推荐模型，它使用基于完形填空任务的双向表示能力，也就是掩码语言建模。后者旨在预测序列中随机掩盖的项目。因为他们假设真正的相互作用的项目是最相关的一个，暴露偏差的结果，其中没有相互作用的项目低暴露倾向被认为是无关紧要的。减轻推荐中暴露偏倚的最常见方法是逆倾向评分(IPS) ，其包括按照暴露倾向的比例降低损失函数中的相互作用预测的权重，从而产生理论上无偏倚的学习。在这项工作中，我们争论和证明 IPS 没有扩展到顺序推荐，因为它没有考虑到问题的时间性质。然后，我们提出了一种新的倾向评分机制，它可以在理论上降低完形填空任务的顺序推荐。最后，我们通过实证证明了我们提出的方法的去偏能力及其对暴露偏差严重程度的鲁棒性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Debiasing+the+Cloze+Task+in+Sequential+Recommendation+with+Bidirectional+Transformers)|0|
|[A Generalized Doubly Robust Learning Framework for Debiasing Post-Click Conversion Rate Prediction](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539270)|Quanyu Dai, Haoxuan Li, Peng Wu, Zhenhua Dong, XiaoHua Zhou, Rui Zhang, Rui Zhang, Jie Sun|ruizhang.info, Shenzhen, China; Huawei Noah's Ark Lab, Shenzhen, China; Peking University, Beijing, China; Huawei Hong Kong Theory Lab, Hong Kong, China; Beijing Technology and Business University, Beijing, China|Post-click conversion rate (CVR) prediction is an essential task for discovering user interests and increasing platform revenues in a range of industrial applications. One of the most challenging problems of this task is the existence of severe selection bias caused by the inherent self-selection behavior of users and the item selection process of systems. Currently, doubly robust (DR) learning approaches achieve the state-of-the-art performance for debiasing CVR prediction. However, in this paper, by theoretically analyzing the bias, variance and generalization bounds of DR methods, we find that existing DR approaches may have poor generalization caused by inaccurate estimation of propensity scores and imputation errors, which often occur in practice. Motivated by such analysis, we propose a generalized learning framework that not only unifies existing DR methods, but also provides a valuable opportunity to develop a series of new debiasing techniques to accommodate different application scenarios. Based on the framework, we propose two new DR methods, namely DR-BIAS and DR-MSE. DR-BIAS directly controls the bias of DR loss, while DR-MSE balances the bias and variance flexibly, which achieves better generalization performance. In addition, we propose a novel tri-level joint learning optimization method for DR-MSE in CVR prediction, and an efficient training algorithm correspondingly. We conduct extensive experiments on both real-world and semi-synthetic datasets, which validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.|点击后转换率(CVR)预测是发现用户兴趣和增加平台收入的一个重要任务，在一系列的工业应用。这项任务最具挑战性的问题之一是由于用户固有的自我选择行为和系统的项目选择过程所引起的严重选择偏差的存在。目前，双鲁棒(DR)学习方法在降低 CVR 预测偏差方面取得了最好的效果。然而，通过对 DR 方法的偏差、方差和泛化界限的理论分析，我们发现现有的 DR 方法可能由于在实际应用中经常出现的倾向分数估计不准确和插补错误而导致泛化能力较差。基于这样的分析，我们提出了一个通用的学习框架，它不仅统一了现有的 DR 方法，而且为开发一系列新的去偏技术以适应不同的应用场景提供了宝贵的机会。在此基础上，提出了两种新的 DR 方法: DR-BIAS 和 DR-MSE。DR-BIAS 直接控制 DR 损失的偏差，而 DR-MSE 灵活地平衡偏差和方差，从而获得更好的泛化性能。此外，本文还提出了一种新的基于 DR-MSE 的 CVR 预测三层联合学习优化方法，并给出了相应的训练算法。我们在真实世界和半合成数据集上进行了广泛的实验，验证了我们提出的方法的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=A+Generalized+Doubly+Robust+Learning+Framework+for+Debiasing+Post-Click+Conversion+Rate+Prediction)|0|
|[User-Event Graph Embedding Learning for Context-Aware Recommendation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539458)|Dugang Liu, Mingkai He, Jinwei Luo, Jiangxu Lin, Meng Wang, Xiaolian Zhang, Weike Pan, Zhong Ming|Shenzhen University & Guangdong Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Economy (SZ), Shenzhen, China; Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China; Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, Shenzhen, China; Southeast University, Nanjing, China|Most methods for context-aware recommendation focus on improving the feature interaction layer, but overlook the embedding layer. However, an embedding layer with random initialization often suffers in practice from the sparsity of the contextual features, as well as the interactions between the users (or items) and context. In this paper, we propose a novel user-event graph embedding learning (UEG-EL) framework to address these two sparsity challenges. Specifically, our UEG-EL contains three modules: 1) a graph construction module is used to obtain a user-event graph containing nodes for users, intents and items, where the intent nodes are generated by applying intent node attention (INA) on nodes of the contextual features; 2) a user-event collaborative graph convolution module is designed to obtain the refined embeddings of all features by executing a new convolution strategy on the user-event graph, where each intent node acts as a hub to efficiently propagate the information among different features; 3) a recommendation module is equipped to integrate some existing context-aware recommendation model, where the feature embeddings are directly initialized with the obtained refined embeddings. Moreover, we identify a unique challenge of the basic framework, that is, the contextual features associated with too many instances may suffer from noise when aggregating the information. We thus further propose a simple but effective variant, i.e., UEG-EL-V, in order to prune the information propagation of the contextual features. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets to verify the effectiveness and compatibility of our UEG-EL and its variant.|大多数上下文感知的推荐方法侧重于改进特征交互层，而忽略了嵌入层。然而，具有随机初始化的嵌入层在实践中经常受到上下文特征稀疏性以及用户(或项目)与上下文之间交互的影响。本文提出了一种新的用户事件图嵌入学习(UEG-EL)框架来解决这两个稀疏性问题。具体来说，我们的 UEG-EL 包含三个模块: 1)一个图形构造模块用于获得一个包含用户、意图和项目节点的用户事件图，其中意图节点是通过在上下文特征的节点上应用意图节点注意力(INA)来生成的; 2)一个用户事件协作图卷积模块用于通过在用户事件图上执行一个新的卷积策略来获得所有特征的精细嵌入，其中每个意图节点作为一个中心来有效地传播不同特征之间的信息; 3)一个推荐模块用于集成一些现有的上下文感知的推荐模型，其中特征嵌入是直接初始化。此外，我们发现了基本框架的一个独特的挑战，即与太多实例相关的上下文特征在聚合信息时可能会受到噪声的影响。因此，我们进一步提出了一个简单而有效的变体，即 UEG-EL-V，以修剪信息传播的上下文特征。最后，我们在三个公共数据集上进行了广泛的实验，以验证我们的 UEG-EL 及其变体的有效性和兼容性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=User-Event+Graph+Embedding+Learning+for+Context-Aware+Recommendation)|0|

Most of existing studies believe that high uncertainty can be a good indicator of potential reward, and thus primarily focus on the estimation of model uncertainty. We argue that such an approach overlooks the subsequent effect of exploration on model training. From the perspective of online learning, the adoption of an exploration strategy would also affect the collecting of training data, which further influences model learning. To understand the interaction between exploration and training, we design a Pseudo-Exploration module that simulates the model updating process after a certain item is explored and the corresponding feedback is received. We further show that such a process is equivalent to adding an adversarial perturbation to the model input, and thereby name our proposed approach as an the Adversarial Gradient Driven Exploration (AGE). For production deployment, we propose a dynamic gating unit to pre-determine the utility of an exploration. This enables us to utilize the limited amount of resources for exploration, and avoid wasting pageview resources on ineffective exploration. The effectiveness of AGE was firstly examined through an extensive number of ablation studies on an academic dataset. Meanwhile, AGE has also been deployed to one of the world-leading display advertising platforms, and we observe significant improvements on various top-line evaluation metrics.|在大规模在线推荐系统中，探索-开发(E & E)算法是处理反馈回路问题的常用算法。大多数已有的研究认为高不确定性可以作为潜在报酬的一个很好的指标，因此主要集中在模型不确定性的估计上。我们认为这种方法忽视了探索对模型训练的后续影响。从在线学习的角度来看，探索策略的采用也会影响训练数据的收集，从而进一步影响模型学习。为了理解探索与训练的相互作用，我们设计了一个拟探索模块，模拟探索某一项目并收到相应反馈后的模型更新过程。我们进一步表明，这样一个过程是相当于添加一个对抗扰动的模型输入，从而命名我们提出的方法作为一个对抗梯度驱动探索(AGE)。对于生产部署，我们提出了一个动态门控单元来预先确定勘探的效用。这使我们能够利用有限的资源进行探索，避免在无效探索上浪费页面浏览资源。AGE 的有效性首先通过一个学术数据集上的大量消融研究进行了检验。与此同时，AGE 也被部署到世界领先的展示广告平台之一，我们观察到各种顶线评估指标的显著改进。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Adversarial+Gradient+Driven+Exploration+for+Deep+Click-Through+Rate+Prediction)|0|

Reddy|Amazon, Palo Alto, CA, USA; Virginia Tech, Arlington, VA, USA|The large-scale nature of product catalog and the changing demands of customer queries makes product search a challenging problem. The customer queries are ambiguous and implicit. They may be looking for an exact match of their query, or a functional equivalent (i.e., substitute), or an accessory to go with it (i.e., complement). It is important to distinguish these three categories from merely classifying an item for a customer query as relevant or not. This information can help direct the customer and improve search applications to understand the customer mission. In this paper, we formulate search relevance as a multi-class classification problem and propose a graph-based solution to classify a given query-item pair as exact, substitute, complement, or irrelevant (ESCI). The customer engagement (clicks, add-to-cart, and purchases) between query and items serve as a crucial information for this problem. However, existing approaches rely purely on the textual information (such as BERT) and do not sufficiently focus on the structural relationships. Another challenge in including the structural information is the sparsity of such data in some regions. We propose Structure-Aware multilingual LAnguage Model (SALAM), that utilizes a language model along with a graph neural network, to extract region-specific semantics as well as relational information for the classification of query-product pairs. Our model is first pre-trained on a large region-agnostic dataset and behavioral graph data and then fine-tuned on region-specific versions to address the sparsity. We show in our experiments that SALAM significantly outperforms the current matching frameworks on the ESCI classification task in several regions. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of using a two-phased training setup (i.e., pre-training and fine-tuning) in capturing region-specific information. Also, we provide various challenges and solutions for using the model in an industrial setting and outline its contribution to the e-commerce engine.|产品目录的大规模性和客户查询需求的变化使得产品搜索成为一个具有挑战性的问题。客户查询是模糊和隐式的。他们可能在寻找与他们的查询完全匹配的查询，或者功能等价的查询(即替代查询) ，或者附属查询(即补充查询)。区分这三个类别与仅仅为客户查询分类一个项目是否相关是很重要的。这些信息可以帮助指导客户并改进搜索应用程序，以理解客户的使命。本文将搜索相关性表述为一个多类分类问题，并提出了一种基于图的解决方案，将给定的查询项对分类为精确、替代、补充或不相关(ESCI)。查询和项目之间的客户参与(单击、添加到购物车和购买)是解决此问题的关键信息。然而，现有的方法仅仅依赖于文本信息(比如 BERT) ，并没有充分关注结构关系。在纳入结构信息方面的另一个挑战是，一些区域的此类数据稀少。提出了一种基于结构感知的多语言语言模型(SALAM) ，该模型利用语言模型和图神经网络提取区域特定的语义和关系信息，用于查询产品对的分类。我们的模型首先在大型区域不可知数据集和行为图数据上进行预训练，然后在区域特定版本上进行微调，以解决稀疏性问题。我们的实验表明，在 ESCI 分类任务中，SALAM 在几个地区的性能明显优于目前的匹配框架。我们还演示了使用两阶段的训练设置(即预训练和微调)在捕获特定区域的信息方面的有效性。此外，我们提供了在工业环境中使用该模型的各种挑战和解决方案，并概述了其对电子商务引擎的贡献。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Graph-based+Multilingual+Language+Model:+Leveraging+Product+Relations+for+Search+Relevance)|0|

Faster delivery promise to the customer results in increased conversion and revenue. There are typically two mechanisms to control the delivery speed - a) replication of products across warehouses, and b) air-shipping the product. In this paper, we present a machine learning based framework to recommend air-shipping eligibility for products. Specifically, we develop a causal inference framework (referred to as Air Shipping Recommendation or ASPIRE) that balances the trade-off between revenue or conversion and delivery cost to decide whether a product should be shipped via air. We propose a doubly-robust estimation technique followed by an optimization algorithm to determine air eligibility of products and calculate the uplift in revenue and shipping cost. We ran extensive experiments (both offline and online) to demonstrate the superiority of our technique as compared to the incumbent policies and baseline approaches.

Conventional relevance models solely rely on the textual data, which suffer from the scarce semantic signals within the short queries. Recently, user historical click behaviors are incorporated in the format of click graphs to provide additional correlations beyond pure textual semantics, which contributes to advancing the relevance modeling performance. However, user behaviors are usually arbitrary and unpredictable, leading to the noisy and sparse graph topology. In addition, there exist other types of user behaviors besides clicks, which may also provide complementary information. In this paper, we study the novel problem of heterogeneous behavior graph learning to facilitate relevance modeling task. Our motivation lies in learning an optimal and task-relevant heterogeneous behavior graph consisting of multiple types of user behaviors. We further propose a novel HBGLR model to learn the behavior graph structure by mining the sophisticated correlations between node semantics and graph topology, and encode the textual semantics and structural heterogeneity into the learned representations. Our proposal is evaluated over real-world industry datasets, and has been mainstreamed in the Bing ads.

|[Combo-Fashion: Fashion Clothes Matching CTR Prediction with Item History](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539101)|Chenxu Zhu, Peng Du, Weinan Zhang, Yong Yu, Yang Cao|Alibaba Group, Hangzhou, China; Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China|As one of the fundamental trends for future development of recommender systems, Fashion Clothes Matching Recommendation for click-through rate (CTR) prediction has become an increasingly essential task. Unlike traditional single-item recommendation, a combo item, composed of a top item (e.g. a shirt) and a bottom item (e.g. a skirt), is recommended. In such a task, the matching effect between these two single items plays a crucial role, and greatly influences the users' preferences; however, it is usually neglected by previous approaches in CTR prediction. In this work, we tackle this problem by designing a novel algorithm called Combo-Fashion, which extracts the matching effect by introducing the matching history of the combo item with two cascaded modules: (i) Matching Search Module (MSM) seeks the popular combo items and undesirable ones as a positive set and a negative set, respectively; (ii) Matching Prediction Module (MPM) models the precise relationship between the candidate combo item and the positive/negative set by an attention-based deep model. Besides, the CPM Fashion Attribute, considered from characteristic, pattern and material, is applied to capture the matching effect further. As part of this work, we release two large-scale datasets consisting of 3.56 million and 6.01 million user behaviors with rich context and fashion information in millions of combo items. The experimental results over these two real-world datasets have demonstrated the superiority of our proposed model with significant improvements. Furthermore, we have deployed Combo-Fashion onto the platform of Taobao to recommend the combo items to the users, where an 8-day online A/B test proved the effectiveness of Combo-Fashion with an improvement of pCTR by 1.02% and uCTR by 0.70%.|作为推荐系统未来发展的基本趋势之一，服装搭配推荐系统的点进率预测已经成为一项日益重要的任务。不同于传统的单一项目推荐，一个组合项目，组成的顶部项目(如衬衫)和底部项目(如裙子) ，是推荐的。在这样一个任务中，这两个项目之间的匹配效果起着至关重要的作用，并且对用户的偏好有很大的影响，但是在以往的 CTR 预测方法中往往忽略了这一点。针对这一问题，本文设计了一种新的组合时尚算法，该算法通过引入组合项目的匹配历史来提取匹配效果，该算法由两个级联模块组成: (1)匹配搜索模块(MSM)分别将流行的组合项目和不受欢迎的组合项目作为一个正集和一个负集来搜索; (2)匹配预测模块(MPM)通过基于注意的深度模型来建立候选组合项目与正/负集之间的精确关系。此外，从特征、图案和材质三个方面考虑，运用 CPM 时尚属性进一步捕捉匹配效果。作为这项工作的一部分，我们发布了两个大型数据集，包括356万和601万用户行为，其中包含数百万个组合项目的丰富上下文和时尚信息。在这两个实际数据集上的实验结果显示了我们提出的模型的优越性，并有显著的改进。此外，我们还在淘宝平台上部署了 Combo-Fashion，向用户推荐组合项目，通过8天的在线 A/B 测试证明了 Combo-Fashion 的有效性，pCTR 提高了1.02% ，uCTR 提高了0.70% 。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Combo-Fashion:+Fashion+Clothes+Matching+CTR+Prediction+with+Item+History)|0|

Due to the low-rank nature of tensor in real applications, the latent factors can be used to perform tensor completion in numerous tasks, such as knowledge graph completion and timely recommendation. However, existing works solve the problem in Euclidean space, where the tensor is decomposed into Euclidean vectors. Recent studies show that hyperbolic space is roomier than Euclidean space. With the same dimension, a hyperbolic vector can represent richer information (e.g., hierarchical structure) than a Euclidean vector. In this paper, we propose to decompose tensor in hyperbolic space. Considering that the most popular optimization tools (e.g, SGD, Adam) have not been generalized in hyperbolic space, we design an adaptive optimization algorithm according to the distinctive property of hyperbolic manifold. To address the non-convex property of the problem, we adopt gradient ascent in our optimization algorithm to avoid getting trapped in local optimal landscapes. We conduct experiments on various tensor completion tasks and the result validates the superiority of our method over these baselines that solve the problem in Euclidean space.|张量分解旨在将输入张量分解为若干潜在因子。由于张量在实际应用中的低秩特性，潜在因子可以用来完成许多任务，如知识图的完成和及时推荐。然而，现有的工作解决了欧氏空间中的问题，其中张量分解成欧氏向量。最近的研究表明双曲空间比欧几里得空间更宽敞。在相同的维度下，双曲向量可以比矢量表示更丰富的信息(例如，层次结构)。在这篇文章中，我们提出在双曲空间中分解张量。考虑到最流行的优化工具(例如，SGD，Adam)还没有在双曲空间中推广，我们根据双曲流形的独特性质设计了一个自适应优化算法。为了解决该问题的非凸性，在优化算法中采用了梯度上升的方法，以避免陷入局部最优景观中。我们对各种张量完成任务进行了实验，实验结果验证了该方法相对于这些基线解决欧氏空间问题的优越性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Low-rank+Nonnegative+Tensor+Decomposition+in+Hyperbolic+Space)|0|

|[G2NET: A General Geography-Aware Representation Network for Hotel Search Ranking](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539025)|Jia Xu, Fei Xiong, Zulong Chen, Mingyuan Tao, Liangyue Li, Quan Lu|Guangxi University, Nanning, China; Alibaba Group, Hangzhou, China|Hotel search ranking is the core function of Online Travel Platforms (OTPs), while geography information of location entities involved in it plays a critically important role in guaranteeing its ranking quality. The closest line of works to the hotel search ranking problem is thus the next POI (or location) recommendation problem, which has extensive works but fails to cope with two new challenges, i.e., consideration of two more location entities and effective utilization of geographical information, in a hotel search ranking scenario. To this end, we propose a General Geography-aware representation NETwork (G2NET for short) to better represent geography information of location entities so as to optimize the hotel search ranking. In G2NET, to address the first challenge, we first propose the concept of Geography Interaction Schema (GIS) which is a meta template for representing the arbitrary number of location entity types and their interactions. Then, a novel geography interaction encoder is devised providing general representation ability for an instance of GIS, followed by an attentive operation that aggregates representations of instances corresponding to all historically interacted hotels of a user in a weighted manner. The second challenge is handled by the combined application of three proposed geography embedding modules in G2NET, each of which focuses on computing embeddings of location entities based on a certain aspect of geographical information of location entities. Moreover, a self-attention layer is deployed in G2NET, to capture correlations among historically interacted hotels of a user which provides non-trivial functionality of understanding the user's behaviors. Both offline and online experiments show that G2NET outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. G2NET has now been successfully deployed to provide the high-quality hotel search ranking service at Fliggy, one of the most popular OTPs in China, serving tens of millions of users.|酒店搜索排名是在线旅游平台(OTP)的核心功能，而位置实体的地理信息对于保证其排名质量起着至关重要的作用。因此，与酒店搜索排名问题最接近的工作是下一个 POI (或位置)推荐问题，这个问题有大量的工作，但未能应对两个新的挑战，即在一个酒店搜索排名场景中考虑另外两个位置实体和有效利用地理信息。为此，我们提出了一个通用地理感知表示网络(G2NET) ，以更好地表示位置实体的地理信息，从而优化酒店搜索排名。在 G2NET 中，为了应对第一个挑战，我们首先提出了地理交互模式(GIS)的概念，它是一个元模板，用于表示任意数量的位置实体类型及其交互。然后，设计了一种新颖的地理交互编码器，提供了 GIS 实例的一般表示能力，然后进行了注意操作，以加权的方式聚合了对应于用户的所有历史交互酒店的实例表示。第二个挑战是通过在 G2NET 中联合应用三个地理嵌入模块来解决，每个模块的重点都是基于位置实体的地理信息的某一方面来计算位置实体的嵌入。此外，在 G2NET 中部署了一个自我关注层，以捕获用户在历史上交互的酒店之间的相关性，从而提供了理解用户行为的重要功能。离线和在线实验都表明，G2NET 的性能优于最先进的方法。目前，g2NET 已成功部署到 Fliggy，为数千万用户提供高质量的酒店搜索排名服务。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=G2NET:+A+General+Geography-Aware+Representation+Network+for+Hotel+Search+Ranking)|0|

Our previous work demonstrated that general-purpose user embeddings based on mobile app usage helped article recommendations. However, high-dimensional embeddings are cumbersome for online usage, thus limiting the adoption. On the other hand, user clustering, which partitions users into several groups, can provide a lightweight, online-friendly, and explainable way to help recommendations. Effective user clustering for article recommendations based on mobile app usage faces unique challenges, including (1) the gap between an active user's behavior of mobile app usage and article reading, and (2) the gap between mobile app usage patterns of active and cold-start users. To address the challenges, we propose a tailored Dual Alignment User Clustering (DAUC) model, which applies a sample-wise contrastive alignment to eliminate the gap between active users' mobile app usage and article reading behavior, and a distribution-wise adversarial alignment to eliminate the gap between active users' and cold-start users' app usage behavior. With DAUC, cold-start recommendation-optimized user clustering based on mobile app usage can be achieved. On top of the user clusters, we further build candidate generation strategies, real-time features, and corresponding ranking models without much engineering difficulty. Both online and offline experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our work.|本文报道了我们最近向腾讯的冷启动用户推荐文章的做法。从信息丰富的领域转移知识以帮助用户建模是解决用户端冷启动问题的有效途径。我们以前的工作表明，基于移动应用程序使用的通用用户嵌入有助于文章推荐。但是，高维嵌入对于在线使用来说很麻烦，因此限制了采用。另一方面，用户集群(将用户划分为几个组)可以提供一种轻量级的、在线友好的、可解释的方式来帮助推荐。基于移动应用使用的文章推荐的有效用户聚类面临独特的挑战，包括(1)活跃用户的移动应用使用行为和文章阅读之间的差距，以及(2)活跃用户和冷启动用户的移动应用使用模式之间的差距。为了应对这些挑战，我们提出了一个定制的双对齐用户聚类(DAUC)模型，该模型应用样本对比对齐来消除活跃用户的移动应用程序使用和文章阅读行为之间的差距，以及分布式对抗对齐来消除活跃用户和冷启动用户的应用程序使用行为之间的差距。利用 DAUC，可以实现基于移动应用使用情况的冷启动推荐优化用户聚类。在用户集群的基础上，我们进一步构建了候选生成策略、实时特征以及相应的排序模型，这些都不需要很大的工程难度。这两个在线和离线实验都证明了我们工作的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Task-optimized+User+Clustering+based+on+Mobile+App+Usage+for+Cold-start+Recommendations)|0|
|[Promotheus: An End-to-End Machine Learning Framework for Optimizing Markdown in Online Fashion E-commerce](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539148)|Eleanor Loh, Jalaj Khandelwal, Brian Regan, Duncan A. Little|ASOS.com, London, United Kingdom|Managing discount promotional events ("markdown") is a significant part of running an e-commerce business, and inefficiencies here can significantly hamper a retailer's profitability. Traditional approaches for tackling this problem rely heavily on price elasticity modelling. However, the partial information nature of price elasticity modelling, together with the non-negotiable responsibility for protecting profitability, mean that machine learning practitioners must often go through great lengths to define strategies for measuring offline model quality. In the face of this, many retailers fall back on rule-based methods, thus forgoing significant gains in profitability that can be captured by machine learning. In this paper, we introduce two novel end-to-end markdown management systems for optimising markdown at different stages of a retailer's journey. The first system, "Ithax," enacts a rational supply-side pricing strategy without demand estimation, and can be usefully deployed as a "cold start" solution to collect markdown data while maintaining revenue control. The second system, "Promotheus," presents a full framework for markdown optimization with price elasticity. We describe in detail the specific modelling and validation procedures that, within our experience, have been crucial to building a system that performs robustly in the real world. Both markdown systems achieve superior profitability compared to decisions made by our experienced operations teams in a controlled online test, with improvements of 86% (Promotheus) and 79% (Ithax) relative to manual strategies. These systems have been deployed to manage markdown at ASOS.com, and both systems can be fruitfully deployed for price optimization across a wide variety of retail e-commerce settings.|管理折扣促销活动(“降价”)是经营电子商务业务的一个重要组成部分，这里的低效率会严重阻碍零售商的盈利能力。解决这一问题的传统方法在很大程度上依赖于价格弹性模型。然而，价格弹性建模的部分信息性质，加上保护盈利能力的不可协商的责任，意味着机器学习从业人员必须经常花费大量的时间来确定衡量离线模型质量的策略。面对这种情况，许多零售商退回到基于规则的方法，因此放弃了可以通过机器学习获得的利润率的显著增长。在本文中，我们介绍了两个新颖的端到端降价管理系统优化降价在不同阶段的零售商的旅程。第一个系统，“ Ithax”，制定了一个合理的供应侧定价策略，没有需求估计，可以作为一个有用的“冷启动”解决方案，收集降价数据，同时保持收入控制。第二个系统，“茂德修斯”，提出了一个完整的框架降价优化与价格弹性。我们详细描述了具体的建模和验证程序，根据我们的经验，这些程序对于建立一个在现实世界中运行良好的系统至关重要。与我们经验丰富的运营团队在受控的在线测试中做出的决策相比，这两种降价系统都实现了更高的盈利能力，相对于手工策略，降价系统的改进率分别为86% 和79% 。这些系统已经部署到 ASOS.com 管理降价，这两个系统都可以在各种零售电子商务环境中进行价格优化，从而取得丰硕成果。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Promotheus:+An+End-to-End+Machine+Learning+Framework+for+Optimizing+Markdown+in+Online+Fashion+E-commerce)|0|
|[Scalar is Not Enough: Vectorization-based Unbiased Learning to Rank](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539468)|Mouxiang Chen, Chenghao Liu, Zemin Liu, Jianling Sun|Singapore Management University, Singapore, Singapore; Salesforce Research Area, Singapore, Singapore; Zhejiang University & Alibaba-Zhejiang University Joint Institute of Frontier Technologies, Hangzhou, China|Unbiased learning to rank (ULTR) aims to train an unbiased ranking model from biased user click logs. Most of the current ULTR methods are based on the examination hypothesis (EH), which assumes that the click probability can be factorized into two scalar functions, one related to ranking features and the other related to bias factors. Unfortunately, the interactions among features, bias factors and clicks are complicated in practice, and usually cannot be factorized in this independent way. Fitting click data with EH could lead to model misspecification and bring the approximation error. In this paper, we propose a vector-based EH and formulate the click probability as a dot product of two vector functions. This solution is complete due to its universality in fitting arbitrary click functions. Based on it, we propose a novel model named Vectorization to adaptively learn the relevance embeddings and sort documents by projecting embeddings onto a base vector. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art ULTR methods on complex real clicks as well as simple simulated clicks.|无偏学习排名(ULTR)的目的是从有偏见的用户点击日志中训练一个无偏见的排名模型。目前的 ULTR 方法大多基于检验假设(EH) ，假设点击概率可以分解为两个标量函数，一个与排序特征有关，另一个与偏差因子有关。遗憾的是，特征、偏差因素和点击之间的相互作用在实践中是复杂的，通常不能以这种独立的方式进行因子分解。将 click 数据与 EH 进行匹配可能导致模型错误说明，并带来逼近误差。本文提出了一种基于向量的 EH，并将点击概率表示为两个向量函数的点乘。该解决方案是完整的，因为它在拟合任意点击函数的通用性。在此基础上，提出了一种新的向量化模型，通过向基向量投影来自适应地学习相关嵌入和排序文档。大量的实验表明，我们的方法在复杂的真实点击和简单的模拟点击方面明显优于最先进的 ULTR 方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Scalar+is+Not+Enough:+Vectorization-based+Unbiased+Learning+to+Rank)|0|
|[Efficient Approximate Algorithms for Empirical Variance with Hashed Block Sampling](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539377)|Xingguang Chen, Fangyuan Zhang, Sibo Wang|The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China|Empirical variance is a fundamental concept widely used in data management and data analytics, e.g., query optimization, approximate query processing, and feature selection. A direct solution to derive the empirical variance is scanning the whole data table, which is expensive when the data size is huge. Hence, most current works focus on approximate answers by sampling. For results with approximation guarantees, the samples usually need to be uniformly independent random, incurring high cache miss rates especially in compact columnar style layouts. An alternative uses block sampling to avoid this issue, which directly samples a block of consecutive records fitting page sizes instead of sampling one record each time. However, this provides no theoretical guarantee. Existing studies show that the practical estimations can be inaccurate as the records within a block can be correlated. Motivated by this, we investigate how to provide approximation guarantees for empirical variances with block sampling from a theoretical perspective. Our results shows that if the records stored in a table are 4-wise independent to each other according to keys, a slightly modified block sampling can provide the same approximation guarantee with the same asymptotic sampling cost as that of independent random sampling. In practice, storing records via hash clusters or hash organized tables are typical scenarios in modern commercial database systems. Thus, for data analysis on tables in the data lake or OLAP stores that are exported from such hash-based storage, our strategy can be easily integrated to improve the sampling efficiency. Based on our sampling strategy, we present an approximate algorithm for empirical variance and an approximate top-k algorithm to return the k columns with the highest empirical variance scores. Extensive experiments show that our solutions outperform existing solutions by up to an order of magnitude.|经验方差是数据管理和数据分析中广泛使用的一个基本概念，如查询优化、近似查询处理和特征选择。推导经验方差的直接方法是对整个数据表进行扫描，当数据量很大时，扫描成本很高。因此，目前大多数的工作集中在抽样近似答案。对于具有近似保证的结果，样本通常需要是一致独立的随机的，特别是在紧凑的柱状样式布局中，会导致高缓存错过率。另一种方法是使用块抽样来避免这个问题，即直接抽样一个连续的记录块来适应页面大小，而不是每次抽样一个记录。然而，这并不能提供理论上的保证。现有的研究表明，实际的估计可能是不准确的，因为一个区块内的记录可以相关。在此基础上，我们从理论的角度研究了如何为区组抽样的经验方差提供近似保证。结果表明，如果存储在表中的记录按键相互独立，稍加修改的块抽样可以提供与独立随机抽样相同的渐近抽样代价的近似保证。在实践中，通过散列集群或散列组织表存储记录是现代商业数据库系统中的典型场景。因此，对于从这种基于散列的存储器导出的数据湖或 OLAP 存储器中的表的数据分析，可以很容易地将我们的策略集成起来以提高采样效率。基于我们的抽样策略，我们提出了一个经验方差的近似算法和一个近似 top-k 算法来返回经验方差得分最高的 k 列。大量的实验表明，我们的解决方案比现有解决方案的性能高出一个数量级。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Efficient+Approximate+Algorithms+for+Empirical+Variance+with+Hashed+Block+Sampling)|0|
|[Towards a Native Quantum Paradigm for Graph Representation Learning: A Sampling-based Recurrent Embedding Approach](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539327)|Ge Yan, Yehui Tang, Junchi Yan|Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China|Graph representation learning has been extensively studied, and recent models can well incorporate both node features and graph structures. Despite these progress, the inherent scalability challenge for classical computers of processing graph data and solving the downstream tasks (many are NP-hard) is still a bottleneck for existing classical graph learning models. On the other hand, quantum computing is known a promising direction for its theoretically verified scalability as well as the increasing evidence for the access to physical quantum machine in near-term. Different from many existing classical-quantum hybrid machine learning models on graphs, in this paper we take a more aggressive initiative for developing a native quantum paradigm for (attributed) graph representation learning, which to our best knowledge, has not been fulfilled in literature yet. Specifically, our model adopts the well-established theory and technique in quantum computing e.g. quantum random walk, and adapt it to the attributed graph. Then the node attribute quantum state sequence is fed into a quantum recurrent network to obtain the final node embedding. Experimental results on three public datasets show the effectiveness of our quantum model which also outperforms a classical learning approach GraphRNA notably in terms of efficiency even on a classical computer. Though it is still restricted to the classical loss-based learning paradigm with gradient descent for model parameter training, while our computing scheme is compatible with quantum computing without involving classical computers. This is in fact largely in contrast to many hybrid quantum graph learning models which often involve many steps and modules having to be performed on classical computers.|图表示学习已经得到了广泛的研究，现有的模型能够很好地结合节点特征和图结构。尽管取得了这些进展，经典计算机在处理图形数据和解决下游任务(许多是 NP 难的)方面固有的可伸缩性挑战仍然是现有经典图形学习模型的瓶颈。另一方面，量子计算因其在理论上被证实的可扩展性以及近期越来越多的物理量子计算的证据而被认为是一个有前途的方向。与许多现有的经典-量子混合机器学习模型不同，本文采取了更积极的主动性，开发了一个本土的量子范式(属性)图表示学习，据我们所知，这尚未在文献中得到实现。具体地说，我们的模型采用了量子计算中已经成熟的理论和技术，例如量子随机游走，并将其适用于属性图。然后将节点属性量子状态序列输入到量子递归网络中，得到最终的节点嵌入。在三个公共数据集上的实验结果表明了量子模型的有效性，即使在经典的计算机上，量子模型的效率也明显优于经典的学习方法 GraphRNA。虽然我们的计算机系统仍然局限于传统的以损失为基础的学习范式，并且只有模型参数训练的梯度下降法，但我们的计算机系统可以与量子计算兼容，而不需要使用传统的计算机。这实际上在很大程度上与许多混合量子图学习模型形成对比，这些模型通常涉及许多步骤和模块，必须在经典计算机上执行。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Towards+a+Native+Quantum+Paradigm+for+Graph+Representation+Learning:+A+Sampling-based+Recurrent+Embedding+Approach)|0|
|[Toward Real-life Dialogue State Tracking Involving Negative Feedback Utterances](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539385)|Puhai Yang, Heyan Huang, Wei Wei, XianLing Mao|Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China; Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; Beijing Institute of Technology & Beijing Engineering Research Center of High Volume Language Information Processing and Cloud Computing Applications, Beijing, China|Recently, the research of dialogue systems has been widely concerned, especially task-oriented dialogue systems, which have received increased attention due to their wide application prospect. As a core component, dialogue state tracking (DST) plays a key role in task-oriented dialogue systems, and its function is to parse natural language dialogues into dialogue state formed by slot-value pairs. It is well known that dialogue state tracking has been well studied and explored on current benchmark datasets such as the MultiWOZ. However, almost all current research completely ignores the user negative feedback utterances that exist in real-life conversations when a system error occurs, which often contains user-provided corrective information for the system error. Obviously, user negative feedback utterances can be used to correct the inevitable errors in automatic speech recognition and model generalization. Thus, in this paper, we will explore the role of negative feedback utterances in dialogue state tracking in detail through simulated negative feedback utterances. Specifically, due to the lack of dataset involving negative feedback utterances, first, we have to define the schema of user negative feedback utterances and propose a joint modeling method for feedback utterance generation and filtering. Then, we explore three aspects of interaction mechanism that should be considered in real-life conversations involving negative feedback utterances and propose evaluation metrics related to negative feedback utterances. Finally, on WOZ2.0 and MultiWOZ2.1 datasets, by constructing simulated negative feedback utterances in training and testing, we not only verify the important role of negative feedback utterances in dialogue state tracking, but also analyze the advantages and disadvantages of different interaction mechanisms involving negative feedback utterances, lighting future research on negative feedback utterances.|近年来，对话系统的研究受到了广泛的关注，尤其是面向任务的对话系统，由于其广阔的应用前景而受到越来越多的关注。对话状态跟踪(DST)是任务导向对话系统的核心组成部分，其功能是将自然语言对话解析为由插槽值对形成的对话状态。众所周知，对话状态跟踪已经在当前的基准数据集(如 MultiWOZ)上得到了很好的研究和探索。然而，目前几乎所有的研究都完全忽视了系统错误发生时用户在现实交谈中的负面反馈语，其中往往包含用户提供的系统错误纠正信息。显然，用户负反馈话语可以用来纠正语音自动识别和模型推广中不可避免的错误。因此，本文将通过模拟负反馈话语来详细探讨负反馈话语在对话状态跟踪中的作用。具体来说，由于缺乏涉及负反馈话语的数据集，首先，我们必须定义用户负反馈话语的模式，并提出一种联合建模的方法来生成和过滤反馈话语。然后，从三个方面探讨了负反馈话语在现实会话中应该考虑的互动机制，并提出了与负反馈话语相关的评价指标。最后，在 WOZ2.0和 MultiWOZ2.1数据集上，通过构建训练和测试中的模拟负反馈话语，不仅验证了负反馈话语在对话状态跟踪中的重要作用，而且分析了负反馈话语不同交互机制的优缺点，为进一步研究负反馈话语提供参考。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Toward+Real-life+Dialogue+State+Tracking+Involving+Negative+Feedback+Utterances)|0|

In this paper, we focus on the real-world scenario where these factors can be explicitly captured (the users are exposed with decision factor-based persuasion texts, i.e., persuasion factors). Although it allows us for explicit modeling of user-decision process, there are critical challenges including the persuasion factor's representation learning and effect estimation, along with the data-sparsity problem. To address them, in this work, we present our POEM (short for Persuasion factOr Effect Modeling) system. We first propose the persuasion-factor graph convolutional layers for encoding and learning representations from the persuasion-aware interaction data. Then we develop a prediction layer that fully considers the user sensitivity to the persuasion factors. Finally, to address the data-sparsity issue, we propose a counterfactual learning-based data augmentation method to enhance the supervision signal.

Mining this knowledge can: (a) immediately help better explain observed and predicted player behavior; and (b) consequently propel deeper understanding towards players' experience, growth and protection. To this effect, we focus on discovery of the "game behaviours" as micro-patterns formed by continuous sequence of games and the persistent "play styles" of the players' as a sequence of such sequences on an online skill gaming platform for Rummy. We propose a two stage deep neural network, CognitionNet. The first stage focuses on mining game behaviours as cluster representations in a latent space while the second aggregates over these micro patterns to discover play styles via a supervised classification objective around player engagement. The dual objective allows CognitionNet to reveal several player psychology inspired decision making and tactics.

Unfortunately, federated recommender systems are vulnerable to poisoning attacks by malicious clients. Existing recommender system poisoning methods mainly focus on promoting the recommendation chances of target items due to financial incentives. In fact, in real-world scenarios, the attacker may also attempt to degrade the overall performance of recommender systems. However, existing general FL poisoning methods for degrading model performance are either ineffective or not concealed in poisoning federated recommender systems. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective and covert poisoning attack method on federated recommendation, named FedAttack. Its core idea is using globally hardest samples to subvert model training. More specifically, the malicious clients first infer user embeddings based on local user profiles. Next, they choose the candidate items that are most relevant to the user embeddings as hardest negative samples, and find the candidates farthest from the user embeddings as hardest positive samples. The model gradients inferred from these poisoned samples are then uploaded for aggregation. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that FedAttack can effectively degrade the performance of various federated recommender systems, meanwhile cannot be effectively detected nor defended by many existing methods.|联邦学习（FL）是一种从去中心化用户数据中学习个性化推荐模型的可行技术。然而，联邦推荐系统易受恶意客户端投毒攻击的威胁。现有推荐系统投毒方法主要基于经济利益驱动，侧重于提升目标物品的推荐概率。事实上，在真实场景中，攻击者可能还会试图降低推荐系统的整体性能。但现有旨在降低模型性能的通用联邦学习投毒方法，在攻击联邦推荐系统时要么效果有限，要么缺乏隐蔽性。本文提出一种简单却高效隐蔽的联邦推荐投毒攻击方法FedAttack，其核心思想是利用全局最难样本颠覆模型训练。具体而言：恶意客户端首先基于本地用户画像推断用户嵌入向量；接着选择与用户嵌入最相关的候选物品作为最难负样本，同时选取距离用户嵌入最远的候选物品作为最难正样本；最终将这些 poisoned 样本推断出的模型梯度上传聚合。在两个基准数据集上的大量实验表明，FedAttack能有效降低多种联邦推荐系统的性能，且现有检测与防御方法均难以有效应对该攻击。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=FedAttack:+Effective+and+Covert+Poisoning+Attack+on+Federated+Recommendation+via+Hard+Sampling)|0|

Deep learning is widely applied to mine expressive tags to users from their historical interactions in the system, e.g., click, conversion action in the advertising chain. The usual approach is to take a certain action as the objective, and introduce multiple independent Two-Tower models to predict the possibility of users' action on tags (known as CTR or CVR prediction). The predicted users' high probably attractive tags are to represent their preferences. However, the single-action models cannot learn complementarily and support effective training on data-sparse actions. Besides, limited by the lack of information fusion between the two towers, the model learns insufficiently to represent users' preferences on various tag topics well. This paper introduces a novel multi-task model called Mixture of Virtual-Kernel Experts (MVKE) to learn user preferences on various actions and topics unitedly. In MVKE, we propose a concept of Virtual-Kernel Expert, which focuses on modeling one particular facet of the user's preferences, and all of them learn coordinately. Besides, the gate-based structure used in MVKE builds an information fusion bridge between two towers, improving the model's capability and maintaining high efficiency. We apply the model in Tencent Advertising System, where both online and offline evaluations show that our method has a significant improvement compared with the existing ones and brings about an obvious lift to actual advertising revenue.|在在线广告和推荐系统等工业应用中，多样化且准确的用户画像能极大助力个性化提升。深度学习被广泛应用于从用户历史交互行为（如广告链中的点击、转化行为）中挖掘富有表现力的用户标签。常规做法是以特定动作为目标，引入多个独立双塔模型来预测用户对标签的行为可能性（即CTR或CVR预测），再将预测的高吸引力标签作为用户偏好表征。然而，单行为模型无法实现互补学习，也难以在数据稀疏的行为上有效训练。此外，受限于双塔间信息融合的缺失，模型难以充分学习用户在不同标签主题上的偏好表征。本文提出一种名为虚拟核专家混合模型（MVKE）的新型多任务模型，可联合学习用户在不同行为和主题上的偏好。该模型创新性地提出虚拟核专家概念——每个专家专注于建模用户偏好的特定维度，并通过协同学习机制实现知识共享。MVKE采用的门控结构在双塔间构建了信息融合桥梁，在提升模型能力的同时保持了高效率。我们将该模型应用于腾讯广告系统，线上线下评估均表明：相较现有方法，本方案带来显著提升并实际拉动广告收入增长。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Mixture+of+Virtual-Kernel+Experts+for+Multi-Objective+User+Profile+Modeling)|0|
|[Embedding Compression with Hashing for Efficient Representation Learning in Large-Scale Graph](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539068)|ChinChia Michael Yeh, Mengting Gu, Yan Zheng, Huiyuan Chen, Javid Ebrahimi, Zhongfang Zhuang, Junpeng Wang, Liang Wang, Wei Zhang|Researcher, VISA; Research Scientist, VISA; Visa Res, Austin, TX 78759 USA; Principal Scientist, VISA|Graph neural networks (GNNs) are deep learning models designed specifically for graph data, and they typically rely on node features as the input to the first layer. When applying such a type of network on the graph without node features, one can extract simple graph-based node features (e.g., number of degrees) or learn the input node representations (i.e., embeddings) when training the network. While the latter approach, which trains node embeddings, more likely leads to better performance, the number of parameters associated with the embeddings grows linearly with the number of nodes. It is therefore impractical to train the input node embeddings together with GNNs within graphics processing unit (GPU) memory in an end-to-end fashion when dealing with industrial-scale graph data. Inspired by the embedding compression methods developed for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, we develop a node embedding compression method where each node is compactly represented with a bit vector instead of a floating-point vector. The parameters utilized in the compression method can be trained together with GNNs. We show that the proposed node embedding compression method achieves superior performance compared to the alternatives.|图神经网络（GNN）是专为图数据设计的深度学习模型，其第一层通常以节点特征作为输入。当将此类网络应用于无节点特征的图结构时，既可提取基于图的简单节点特征（如度数值），也可在训练网络时学习输入节点的表示（即嵌入）。虽然通过训练节点嵌入的方法往往能获得更优性能，但与之相关的参数量会随节点数量线性增长。因此，在处理工业级规模的图数据时，以端到端方式在图形处理器（GPU）内存中同时训练输入节点嵌入与图神经网络实际上并不可行。受自然语言处理（NLP）任务中嵌入压缩方法的启发，我们开发了一种节点嵌入压缩技术：每个节点通过比特向量而非浮点向量进行紧凑表示，且压缩方法中涉及的参数可与图神经网络协同训练。实验表明，相较于其他方案，本文提出的节点嵌入压缩方法实现了更优越的性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Embedding+Compression+with+Hashing+for+Efficient+Representation+Learning+in+Large-Scale+Graph)|0|

Intelligent pre-consultation (IPC) is a relatively new application deployed on mobile terminals for collecting patient's information before a face-to-face consultation. It takes advantages of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to assist doctors on clinical decision-making. One of key functions of IPC is to detect medical symptoms from patient queries. By extracting symptoms from patient queries, IPC is able to collect more information on patient's health status by asking symptom-related questions. All collected information will be summarized as a medical record for doctors to make clinical decision. This saves a great deal of time for both doctors and patients. Detecting symptoms from patient's query is challenging, as most patients lack medical background and often tend to use colloquial language to describe their symptoms. In this work, we formulate symptom detection as a retrieval problem and propose a bi-directional hard-negative enforced noise contrastive estimation method (Bi-hardNCE) to tackle the symptom detection problem. Bi-hardNCE has both forward contrastive estimation and backward contrastive estimation, which forces model to distinguish the true symptom from negative symptoms and meanwhile distinguish true query from negative queries. To include more informative negatives, our Bi-hardNCE adopts a hard-negative mining strategy and a false-negative eliminating strategy, which achieved a significant improvement on performance. Our proposed model outperforms commonly used retrieval models by a large margin.|在医疗应用中运用人工智能（AI）技术，有助于全球应对医护人员短缺问题，并提升医疗服务的效率与生产力。智能预问诊（IPC）作为新兴移动终端应用，可在面诊前收集患者信息。该系统依托前沿机器学习技术辅助医生进行临床决策，其核心功能是从患者主诉中识别医疗症状。通过提取症状信息，IPC能进一步提出症状相关问题以获取更全面的健康状况数据，所有采集信息将汇总成医疗档案供医生临床决策，显著节省医患双方时间。由于患者多缺乏医学背景且常使用口语化描述，症状检测面临巨大挑战。本研究将症状检测构建为检索任务，提出双向硬负样本增强噪声对比估计方法（Bi-hardNCE）。该模型同时具备前向对比估计与后向对比估计机制，既能区分真实症状与负样本症状，又能区分真实主诉与负样本主诉。通过采用硬负样本挖掘策略和假负样本消除策略，Bi-hardNCE实现了更具信息量的负样本纳入，显著提升检测性能。实验表明，该模型性能远超常用检索模型。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Medical+Symptom+Detection+in+Intelligent+Pre-Consultation+Using+Bi-directional+Hard-Negative+Noise+Contrastive+Estimation)|0|
|[User-tag Profile Modeling in Recommendation System via Contrast Weighted Tag Masking](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539102)|Chenxu Zhu, Peng Du, Xianghui Zhu, Weinan Zhang, Yong Yu, Yang Cao|Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; Alibaba Grp, Beijing, Peoples R China|User-tag profile modeling has become one of the novel and significant trends for the future development of industrial recommendation systems, which can be divided into two fundamental tasks: User Preferred Tag (UPT) and Tag Preferred User (TPU) in practical scenarios. In most existing deep learning models for user-tag profiling, the network inputs all the combined tags of the item with the user features when training but inputs only one tag with the user feature to evaluate the user's preference on a single tag when testing. This leads to data discrepancy between the training and testing samples. To address such an issue, we attempt a novel Random Masking Model (RMM) to remain only one tag at the training time by masking. However, it causes two other serious downsides. First, not all tags attached to the same item are equally predictive. Irrelevant tags may introduce noisy signals and thus cause performance degradation. Second, it neglects the impact of combined tags aggregated together, which may be an essential factor leading to user clicks. Therefore, we further propose a framework called Contrast Weighted Tag Masking (CWTM) in this work, which tackles these two issues with two modules: (i) Weighted Masking Module (WMM) introduces the importance network to compute a score for each tag attached to the item and then samples from these tags weightedly according to the score; (ii) Contrast Module (CM) makes use of a contrastive learning architecture to inherit and distill some understanding about the effect of aggregated tags. Offline experiments on four datasets (three public datasets and one proprietary industrial dataset) demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of CWTM over the state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, CWTM has been deployed on the training platform of Alibaba advertising systems and achieved substantial improvements of ROI and CVR by 16.8% and 9.6%, respectively.|用户标签画像建模已成为工业推荐系统未来发展的新兴重要趋势，在实际场景中可分解为两大基础任务：用户偏好标签（UPT）和标签偏好用户（TPU）。现有大多数用户标签画像深度学习模型在训练时将商品所有组合标签与用户特征共同输入网络，但在测试时仅使用单一标签与用户特征评估用户对单个标签的偏好，导致训练样本与测试样本存在数据分布差异。为解决该问题，我们尝试采用随机掩码模型（RMM）在训练时通过掩码仅保留一个标签。然而这种方法会引发两个新问题：首先，同一商品的所有标签并非都具有同等预测力，无关标签可能引入噪声信号导致性能下降；其次，该方法忽略了组合标签聚合产生的影响，而这可能是引发用户点击的关键因素。因此，我们进一步提出对比加权标签掩码框架（CWTM），通过两个核心模块解决上述问题：（1）加权掩码模块（WMM）引入重要性网络计算商品各标签的权重分数，并依此进行加权采样；（2）对比模块（CM）采用对比学习架构继承并提炼对聚合标签效应的理解。在四个数据集（三个公共数据集和一个工业专有数据集）上的离线实验表明，CWTM在效果上显著优于现有最优基线模型。此外，CWTM已部署于阿里巴巴广告系统训练平台，成功实现投资回报率（ROI）和转化率（CVR）分别提升16.8%和9.6%的显著改进。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=User-tag+Profile+Modeling+in+Recommendation+System+via+Contrast+Weighted+Tag+Masking)|0|

Our objective in this problem is to minimize the query complexity while ensuring accuracy. We propose a method to select the query node such that we can push the search process as much as possible and an online method to infer which node is the target after collecting a new answer.

However, most existing work imposes strong distributional assumptions (e.g., Beta distribution) to represent entities and queries into presumed distributional shape, which limits their expressive power. Moreover, query embeddings are challenging due to the relational complexities in multi-relational KGs (e.g., symmetry, anti-symmetry and transitivity). To bridge the gap, we propose a logical query reasoning framework, Line Embedding (LinE), for FOL queries. To relax the distributional assumptions, we introduce the logic space transformation layer, which is a generic neural function that converts embeddings from probabilistic distribution space to LinE embeddings space. To tackle multi-relational and logical complexities, we formulate neural relation-specific projections and individual logical operators to truthfully ground LinE query embeddings on logical regularities and KG factoids. Lastly, to verify the LinE embedding quality, we generate a FOL query dataset from WordNet, which richly encompasses hierarchical relations. Extensive experiments show superior reasoning sensitivity of LinE on three benchmarks against strong baselines, particularly for multi-hop relational queries and negation-related queries.|知识图谱（KG）上的一阶逻辑（FOL）查询推理通过逻辑运算符（包括合取、析取、存在量词与否定）在嵌入空间中执行查询推断以逼近真实答案。然而现有研究大多采用强分布假设（如贝塔分布）将实体与查询映射至预设分布形态，限制了其表达能力。此外，由于多关系知识图谱中存在复杂关系特性（如对称性、非对称性与传递性），查询嵌入面临巨大挑战。为此，我们提出面向一阶逻辑查询的逻辑推理框架Line Embedding（LinE）。为弱化分布假设，我们设计了逻辑空间转换层——一种将嵌入从概率分布空间转换至LinE嵌入空间的通用神经函数。针对多关系与逻辑复杂性，我们构建了神经关系特定投影与独立逻辑运算符，使LinE查询嵌入忠实遵循逻辑规则与知识图谱事实。最后，为验证LinE嵌入质量，我们从富含层次关系的WordNet中生成了一阶逻辑查询数据集。大量实验表明，LinE在三个基准数据集上对多跳关系查询和否定相关查询展现出卓越的推理敏感性，显著优于现有强基线模型。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=LinE:+Logical+Query+Reasoning+over+Hierarchical+Knowledge+Graphs)|0|

In this work, we introduce an automatic method to design the BO search space with the aid of tuning history from past tasks. This simple yet effective approach can be used to endow many existing BO methods with transfer learning capabilities. In addition, it enjoys the three advantages: universality, generality, and safeness.

In this paper, an effective graph structural attack is investigated to disrupt graph spectral filters in the Fourier domain, which are the theoretical foundation of GCNs. We define the notion of spectral distance based on the eigenvalues of graph Laplacian to measure the disruption of spectral filters. We realize the attack by maximizing the spectral distance and propose an efficient approximation to reduce the time complexity brought by eigen-decomposition. The experiments demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness of the proposed attack in both black-box and white-box settings for both test-time evasion attacks and training-time poisoning attacks. Our qualitative analysis suggests the connection between the imposed spectral changes in the Fourier domain and the attack behavior in the spatial domain, which provides empirical evidence that maximizing spectral distance is an effective way to change the graph structural property and thus disturb the frequency components for graph filters to affect the learning of GCNs.|图卷积网络（GCN）因其在图学习任务中展现出的优异性能激发了广泛研究兴趣，但同时也被证实易受对抗攻击影响。本文研究了一种有效的图结构攻击方法，通过干扰傅里叶域的图谱滤波器——该理论构成GCN的基础框架——来实现攻击效果。我们基于图拉普拉斯矩阵的特征值定义了谱距离概念，用以衡量对谱滤波器的破坏程度。通过最大化谱距离实现攻击，并提出一种高效近似算法以降低特征分解带来的时间复杂度。实验证明，所提出的攻击方法在黑盒与白盒设置下，针对测试阶段规避攻击和训练阶段投毒攻击均具有显著效果。定性分析表明，傅里叶域的频谱变化与空间域的攻击行为存在关联，这为"最大化谱距离是通过改变图结构属性来干扰图谱滤波器频率成分，进而影响GCN学习"的有效性提供了实证依据。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Graph+Structural+Attack+by+Perturbing+Spectral+Distance)|0|

|[FedWalk: Communication Efficient Federated Unsupervised Node Embedding with Differential Privacy](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539308)|Qiying Pan, Yifei Zhu||Node embedding aims to map nodes in the complex graph into low-dimensional representations. The real-world large-scale graphs and difficulties of labeling motivate wide studies of unsupervised node embedding problems. Nevertheless, previous effort mostly operates in a centralized setting where a complete graph is given. With the growing awareness of data privacy, data holders who are only aware of one vertex and its neighbours demand greater privacy protection. In this paper, we introduce FedWalk, a random-walk-based unsupervised node embedding algorithm that operates in such a node-level visibility graph with raw graph information remaining locally. FedWalk is designed to offer centralized competitive graph representation capability with data privacy protection and great communication efficiency. FedWalk instantiates the prevalent federated paradigm and contains three modules. We first design a hierarchical clustering tree (HCT) constructor to extract the structural feature of each node. A dynamic time warping algorithm seamlessly handles the structural heterogeneity across different nodes. Based on the constructed HCT, we then design a random walk generator, wherein a sequence encoder is designed to preserve privacy and a two-hop neighbor predictor is designed to save communication cost. The generated random walks are then used to update node embedding based on a SkipGram model. Extensive experiments on two large graphs demonstrate that Fed-Walk achieves competitive representativeness as a centralized node embedding algorithm does with only up to 1.8% Micro-F1 score and 4.4% Marco-F1 score loss while reducing about 6.7 times of inter-device communication per walk.|节点嵌入旨在将复杂网络中的节点映射为低维表示。现实世界的大规模图数据与标注困难性推动了无监督节点嵌入问题的广泛研究。然而现有方法大多基于集中式设置运行，需获取完整的图结构。随着数据隐私意识的增强，仅掌握单个顶点及其邻域信息的数据持有者需要更强的隐私保护。本文提出FedWalk——一种基于随机游走的无监督节点嵌入算法，可在仅具有节点级可见性的图数据上运行，保持原始图信息始终存储于本地。该算法在实现与集中式方法竞争力相当的图表示能力的同时，兼具数据隐私保护特性和优异的通信效率。FedWalk具体实现了联邦学习范式，包含三大核心模块：首先设计层次化聚类树（HCT）构造器以提取节点结构特征，通过动态时间规整算法无缝处理不同节点间的结构异质性；基于构建的HCT，设计包含隐私保护序列编码器和双跳邻居预测器的随机游走生成器以节省通信成本；生成的游走序列最终通过SkipGram模型更新节点嵌入。在两大真实图谱上的实验表明，FedWalk仅产生最高1.8%的Micro-F1分数和4.4%的Macro-F1分数损失即可达到与集中式节点嵌入算法相当的表示能力，同时将每次游走的设备间通信量降低约6.7倍。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=FedWalk:+Communication+Efficient+Federated+Unsupervised+Node+Embedding+with+Differential+Privacy)|0|
|[Fair Ranking as Fair Division: Impact-Based Individual Fairness in Ranking](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539353)|Yuta Saito, Thorsten Joachims|Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA|Rankings have become the primary interface in two-sided online markets. Many have noted that the rankings not only affect the satisfaction of the users (e.g., customers, listeners, employers, travelers), but that the position in the ranking allocates exposure -- and thus economic opportunity -- to the ranked items (e.g., articles, products, songs, job seekers, restaurants, hotels). This has raised questions of fairness to the items, and most existing works have addressed fairness by explicitly linking item exposure to item relevance. However, we argue that any particular choice of such a link function may be difficult to defend, and we show that the resulting rankings can still be unfair. To avoid these shortcomings, we develop a new axiomatic approach that is rooted in principles of fair division. This not only avoids the need to choose a link function, but also more meaningfully quantifies the impact on the items beyond exposure. Our axioms of envy-freeness and dominance over uniform ranking postulate that for a fair ranking policy every item should prefer their own rank allocation over that of any other item, and that no item should be actively disadvantaged by the rankings. To compute ranking policies that are fair according to these axioms, we propose a new ranking objective related to the Nash Social Welfare. We show that the solution has guarantees regarding its envy-freeness, its dominance over uniform rankings for every item, and its Pareto optimality. In contrast, we show that conventional exposure-based fairness can produce large amounts of envy and have a highly disparate impact on the items. Beyond these theoretical results, we illustrate empirically how our framework controls the trade-off between impact-based individual item fairness and user utility.|排名已成为双边在线市场的主要界面。许多研究指出，排名不仅影响用户（如顾客、听众、雇主、旅行者）的满意度，更通过排序位置为被排名对象（如文章、产品、歌曲、求职者、餐厅、酒店）分配曝光度——进而影响其经济机会。这引发了关于对待被排名对象公平性的讨论，现有研究大多通过将曝光度与内容相关性显式关联来实现公平。然而我们认为，这种关联函数的具体选择往往缺乏理论依据，且实证表明由此产生的排名仍可能存在不公。为克服这些缺陷，我们基于公平分配原则提出了一种新的公理化方法。该方法不仅无需选择关联函数，还能超越曝光度维度更有效地量化排名对被排名对象的影响。我们提出的"无嫉妒性"和"均匀排名优势"公理要求：在公平排名策略下，每个被排名对象都应更偏好自身获得的排名分配而非其他对象的排名分配，且没有对象会因排名策略而处于主动劣势。为实现符合这些公理要求的排名策略，我们提出了与纳什社会福利相关的新排名目标函数。研究证明该解决方案具有无嫉妒性保障、对所有对象的均匀排名优势特性以及帕累托最优性。相比之下，传统基于曝光度的公平性方法可能产生严重嫉妒现象并对不同对象造成高度差异化影响。除理论成果外，我们通过实证研究表明该框架如何基于影响力实现个体公平性与用户效用的权衡控制。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Fair+Ranking+as+Fair+Division:+Impact-Based+Individual+Fairness+in+Ranking)|0|

Concretely, we build a query-specific relation graph to model the complicated query-document relationship from an entity view. Then a graph neural network and node weight adjust algorithm are applied to the relation graph to obtain context-aware entity representations and document representations at each selection step. The diversity features are derived from the updated node representations of the relation graph.

Despite their effectiveness, however, most of the current recommendation models rely on sufficient and high-quality training data, such that the learned representations can well capture accurate user preference. User behavior data in many practical recommendation scenarios is often noisy and exhibits skewed distribution, which may result in suboptimal representation performance in GNN-based models. In this paper, we propose SHT, a novel Self-Supervised Hypergraph Transformer framework (SHT) which augments user representations by exploring the global collaborative relationships in an explicit way. Specifically, we first empower the graph neural CF paradigm to maintain global collaborative effects among users and items with a hypergraph transformer network. With the distilled global context, a cross-view generative self-supervised learning component is proposed for data augmentation over the user-item interaction graph, so as to enhance the robustness of recommender systems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SHT can significantly improve the performance over various state-of-the-art baselines. Further ablation studies show the superior representation ability of our SHT recommendation framework in alleviating the data sparsity and noise issues.

|[MetaPTP: An Adaptive Meta-optimized Model for Personalized Spatial Trajectory Prediction](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539360)|Yuan Xu, Jiajie Xu, Jing Zhao, Kai Zheng, An Liu, Lei Zhao, Xiaofang Zhou|Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Chengdu, Peoples R China; Soochow Univ, Suzhou, Peoples R China|Trajectory prediction is a fundamental problem for a wide spectrum of location-based applications. Existing methods can achieve inspiring results in predicting personal frequent routes conditioned on massive historical data. However, trajectory estimation may involve cold-start routes or users due to the data sparsity problem, which severely limits the performance of spatial trajectory prediction. Although meta-learning models can alleviate the cold-start problem, they simply utilize the same initialization for all tasks and thus cannot fit each user well due to users' varying travel preferences. To this end, we propose an adaptive meta-optimized model called MetaPTP for personalized spatial trajectory prediction. Specifically, it adopts a soft-clustering based method to guide the network initialization in a finer granularity, so that shared knowledge can be better transferred across users with similar travel preferences. Besides, towards model fine-tuning, an effective trajectory sampling method is introduced to generate meaningful support set, which simultaneously considers user preference and spatial trace similarities to provide task-related information for model adaptation. In addition, we design a weight generator to adaptively assign reasonable weights to trajectories in support set to avoid sub-optimal results which will occur when fine-tuning the initial network with the same weight for trajectories with different user preferences and spatial distributions. Finally, extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model.|轨迹预测是各类基于位置应用的基础性问题。现有方法在利用海量历史数据预测个人高频路线方面已能取得优异效果。但由于数据稀疏性问题，轨迹估算可能涉及冷启动路线或用户，这严重限制了空间轨迹预测的性能。尽管元学习模型能够缓解冷启动问题，但它们对所有任务采用相同的初始化方式，由于用户出行偏好存在差异，无法很好地适配每个用户。为此，我们提出了一种自适应元优化模型MetaPTP，用于个性化空间轨迹预测。该模型采用基于软聚类的方法，以更细粒度指导网络初始化，使得具有相似出行偏好的用户之间能更好地实现知识迁移。在模型微调方面，我们引入有效的轨迹采样方法生成高质量支持集，该方法同时考虑用户偏好和空间轨迹相似性，为模型适配提供任务相关信息。此外，我们设计了权重生成器，自适应地为支持集中的轨迹分配合适权重，避免在对初始网络进行微调时，因对不同用户偏好和空间分布的轨迹采用相同权重而导致的次优结果。最终，在两个真实数据集上的大量实验证明了我们模型的优越性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=MetaPTP:+An+Adaptive+Meta-optimized+Model+for+Personalized+Spatial+Trajectory+Prediction)|0|

Vuduc|Georgia Inst Technol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; Amazon, Seattle, WA USA|This paper describes a new method for representing embedding tables of graph neural networks (GNNs) more compactly via tensor-train (TT) decomposition. We consider the scenario where (a) the graph data that lack node features, thereby requiring the learning of embeddings during training; and (b) we wish to exploit GPU platforms, where smaller tables are needed to reduce host-to-GPU communication even for large-memory GPUs. The use of TT enables a compact parameterization of the embedding, rendering it small enough to fit entirely on modern GPUs even for massive graphs. When combined with judicious schemes for initialization and hierarchical graph partitioning, this approach can reduce the size of node embedding vectors by 1,659 times to 81,362 times on large publicly available benchmark datasets, achieving comparable or better accuracy and significant speedups on multi-GPU systems. In some cases, our model without explicit node features on input can even match the accuracy of models that use node features.|本文介绍了一种通过张量链(TT)分解实现图神经网络嵌入表紧凑表示的新方法。该方法主要针对两种场景：(a) 图数据缺乏节点特征，需要在训练过程中学习嵌入表示；(b)需要在GPU平台上运行，即使是大内存GPU也需要通过减小表规模来降低主机到GPU的通信开销。TT分解技术能够实现嵌入参数的紧凑化表征，使其即使处理超大规模图数据时也能完全适配现代GPU的显存容量。当结合智能初始化策略和分层图划分方案时，该方法在大型公开基准数据集上可将节点嵌入向量的尺寸缩小1,659至81,362倍，在保持相当或更优精度的同时，显著提升多GPU系统的训练速度。在某些情况下，我们未使用显式节点特征的模型甚至可以达到使用节点特征模型的精度水平。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Nimble+GNN+Embedding+with+Tensor-Train+Decomposition)|0|

Though extensive studies on recommendation systems are devoted to providing the most well-matched videos for each view request, fitting the data without considering inherent biases such as selection bias and exposure bias will result in serious issues. In this paper, we formalize the exposure proportion strategy as a policy-making problem with multi-dimensional continuous treatment under certain constraints from a causal inference point of view. We propose a novel ensemble policy learning method based on causal trees, called Maximum Difference of Preference Point Forest (MDP2 Forest), which overcomes the shortcomings of existing policy learning approaches. Experimental results on both simulated and synthetic datasets show the superiority of our algorithm compared to other policy learning or causal inference methods in terms of the treatment estimation accuracy and the mean regret. Furthermore, the proposed MDP2 Forest method can also adapt to a wide range of business settings such as imposing different kinds of constraints on the multi-dimensional treatment.|在短视频平台的生态中，各类视频的最佳曝光比例对于从宏观层面指导推荐系统和内容生产至关重要。尽管现有大量研究致力于为每次观看请求提供最匹配的视频推荐，但若忽略选择偏差和曝光偏差等固有偏差而直接拟合数据，将引发严重问题。本文从因果推断的视角出发，将曝光比例策略形式化为特定约束下的多维连续处理变量决策问题。我们提出了一种基于因果树的新型集成策略学习方法——偏好点最大差异森林（MDP2 Forest），该方法克服了现有策略学习方法的缺陷。在仿真数据集与合成数据集上的实验结果表明，相较于其他策略学习或因果推断方法，我们的算法在处理效应估计精度和平均遗憾值方面均表现出优越性。此外，所提出的MDP2 Forest方法还能适应多样化的业务场景，例如对多维处理变量施加不同类型约束的情况。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=MDP2+Forest:+A+Constrained+Continuous+Multi-dimensional+Policy+Optimization+Approach+for+Short-video+Recommendation)|0|

In this work, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning agent to perform floorplanning, one of the early stages of VLSI physical design. Traditional methods to solve floorplanning problem are intractable for large circuit netlists and impossible to learn from past experience. We adopt the domain knowledge of floorplanning representation and propose a learning-based method that directly predicts block id and location through an RL framework. The resulting solutions are platform-independent and can be converted into layout within $O(n)$ time. We encode the hypernet information in the circuit netlist in a one-to-one mapping through hypergraph neural networks. Furthermore, We deploy transformer-like action selection to allow for transferability and generalization across netlist circuits with different sizes and handle the large discrete action space. This allows the parameter space of our model to remain the same regardless of the number of blocks. Our RL agent is able to transfer previously learnt knowledge to quickly optimize a new design with different size and purpose. To our knowledge, this is the first work to select both id and block position with an entirely end-to-end learning-based framework that can generalize. Results on publicly available benchmarks of GSRC and MCNC demonstrate that our method can outperform the baselines while being able to generalize.|近年来，深度强化学习领域在应对现实世界挑战方面取得了显著成就。本研究提出了一种新型深度强化学习智能体，用于执行超大规模集成电路（VLSI）物理设计早期阶段的关键任务——布局规划。传统布局规划方法难以处理大规模电路网表，且无法从历史经验中学习。我们融合了布局规划表示的领域知识，提出一种基于学习的方法，通过强化学习框架直接预测模块ID与位置。所得解决方案具有平台无关性，并可在O(n)时间内转换为物理布局。

Hence, to design a ranking function that gives useful and personalized post recommendations, it would be helpful to be able to predict the affective response a user may have to a post (e.g., entertained, informed, angered). This paper describes the challenges and solutions we developed to apply Affective Computing to social media recommendation systems. We address several types of challenges. First, we devise a taxonomy of affects that was small (for practical purposes) yet covers the important nuances needed for the application. Second, to collect training data for our models, we balance between signals that are already available to us (namely, different types of user engagement) and data we collected through a carefully crafted human annotation effort on 800k posts. We demonstrate that affective response information learned from this dataset improves a module in the recommendation system by more than 8%.

Active learning (AL) and semi-supervised learning (SSL) are two effective, but often isolated, means to alleviate the data-hungry problem. Some recent studies explored the potential of combining AL and SSL to better probe the unlabeled data. However, almost all these contemporary SSL-AL works use a simple combination strategy, ignoring SSL and AL's inherent relation. Further, other methods suffer from high computational costs when dealing with large-scale, high-dimensional datasets. Motivated by the industry practice of labeling data, we propose an innovative Inconsistency-based virtual aDvErsarial Active Learning (IDEAL) algorithm to further investigate SSL-AL's potential superiority and achieve mutual enhancement of AL and SSL, i.e., SSL propagates label information to unlabeled samples and provides smoothed embeddings for AL, while AL excludes samples with inconsistent predictions and considerable uncertainty for SSL. We estimate unlabeled samples' inconsistency by augmentation strategies of different granularities, including fine-grained continuous perturbation exploration and coarse-grained data transformations. Extensive experiments, in both text and image domains, validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, comparing it against state-of-the-art baselines.

The goal of Rax is to facilitate easy prototyping of LTR systems by leveraging the flexibility and simplicity of JAX. Rax provides a diverse set of popular ranking metrics and losses that integrate well with the rest of the JAX ecosystem. Furthermore, Rax implements a system of ranking-specific function transformations which allows fine-grained customization of ranking losses and metrics. Most notably Rax provides approx_t12n: a function transformation (t12n) that can transform any of our ranking metrics into an approximate and differentiable form that can be optimized. This provides a systematic way to directly optimize neural ranking models for ranking metrics that are not easily optimizable in other libraries. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of Rax by benchmarking neural models implemented using Flax and trained using Rax on two popular LTR benchmarks: WEB30K and Istella. Furthermore, we show that integrating ranking losses with T5, a large language model, can improve overall ranking performance on the MS MARCO passage ranking task.

To account for system efficiency, simple vector-product based models are commonly deployed in the pre-ranking stage. Recent works consider distilling the high knowledge of large ranking models to small pre-ranking models for better effectiveness. However, two major challenges in pre-ranking system still exist: (i) without explicitly modeling the performance gain versus computation cost, the predefined latency constraint in the pre-ranking stage inevitably leads to suboptimal solutions; (ii) transferring the ranking teacher's knowledge to a pre-ranking student with a predetermined handcrafted architecture still suffers from the loss of model performance. In this work, a novel framework AutoFAS is proposed which jointly optimizes the efficiency and effectiveness of the pre-ranking model: (i) AutoFAS for the first time simultaneously selects the most valuable features and network architectures using Neural Architecture Search (NAS) technique; (ii) equipped with ranking model guided reward during NAS procedure, AutoFAS can select the best pre-ranking architecture for a given ranking teacher without any computation overhead.

For Internet companies, this has the potential to degrade the user experience and increase user abandonment. Therefore, quality control gates are an important component of the software delivery process. These are used to build confidence in the reliability of a release or change. Towards this end, a common approach is to perform a canary test to evaluate new software under production workloads. Detecting defects as early as possible is necessary to reduce exposure and to provide immediate feedback to the developer. We present a statistical framework for rapidly detecting regressions in software deployments. Our approach is based on sequential tests of stochastic order and of equality in distribution.

|[Retrieval-Based Gradient Boosting Decision Trees for Disease Risk Assessment](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539052)|Handong Ma, Jiahang Cao, Yuchen Fang, Weinan Zhang, Wenbo Sheng, Shaodian Zhang, Yong Yu|Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; Shanghai Synyi Med Technol Co Ltd, Shanghai, Peoples R China|In recent years, machine learning methods have been widely used in modern electronic health record (EHR) systems, and have shown more accurate prediction performance on disease risk assessment tasks than traditional methods. However, most of the existing machine learning methods make the assessment solely based on features of the target case but ignore the cross-sample feature interactions between the target case and other similar cases, which is inconsistent with the general practice of evidence-based medicine of making diagnoses based on existing clinical experience. Moreover, current methods that focus on mining cross-sample information rely on deep neural networks to extract cross-sample feature interactions, which would suffer from the problems of data insufficiency, data heterogeneity and lack of interpretability in disease risk assessment tasks. In this work, we propose a novel retrieval-based gradient boosting decision trees (RB-GBDT) model with a cross-sample extractor to mine cross-sample information while exploiting the superiority of GBDT of robustness, generalization and interpretability. Experiments on real-world clinical datasets show the superiority and efficacy of RB-GBDT on disease risk assessment tasks. The developed software has been deployed in hospital as an auxiliary diagnosis tool for risk assessment of venous thromboembolism.|近年来，机器学习方法在现代电子健康记录（EHR）系统中得到广泛应用，在疾病风险评估任务中展现出比传统方法更精准的预测性能。然而现有机器学习方法大多仅基于目标病例的特征进行评估，忽视了目标病例与其他相似病例间的跨样本特征交互，这与基于现有临床经验进行诊断的循证医学通用实践不相符。此外，当前专注于挖掘跨样本信息的方法依赖深度神经网络提取跨样本特征交互，在疾病风险评估任务中易受数据不足、数据异构性及可解释性缺失等问题的制约。本研究提出一种新型检索式梯度提升决策树（RB-GBDT）模型，通过跨样本特征提取器挖掘跨样本信息，同时发挥GBDT模型鲁棒性、泛化性和可解释性优势。在真实临床数据集上的实验表明，RB-GBDT在疾病风险评估任务中具有卓越效能。该软件已作为静脉血栓栓塞风险评估的辅助诊断工具在医院部署应用。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Retrieval-Based+Gradient+Boosting+Decision+Trees+for+Disease+Risk+Assessment)|0|

Cable junctions of underground distribution networks operate in harsh conditions, potentially leading to failure overtime. Faults can be prevented by the timely detection of local hotspot on these junctions. Hotspot detection is carried out by mean of image segmentation using a deep neural network. Special care is given to uncertainty estimation and validation. Uncertainty is used to assess the quality of a segmentation to avoid misdiagnosis or returning in the field to recapture images. It is also proposed as a tool to evaluate whether unannotated images should be included in the dataset.

|[CERAM: Coverage Expansion for Recommendations by Associating Discarded Models](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539207)|Yoshiki Matsune, Kota Tsubouchi, Nobuhiko Nishio|Ritsumeikan Univ, Shiga, Japan; Yahoo Japan Corp, Tokyo, Japan|Systems that utilize and manage predictive models have become increasingly significant in industry. In the services offered by Yahoo! JAPAN, once a predictive model is utilized for recommendations, it is thrown away. Such models could however be reused for expanding the coverage of other recommendations. Here, our goal is to construct recommendation systems that expand the coverage of recommendations by effectively utilizing models which would otherwise be discarded. Another goal is to deploy such a recommendation system on real services and make practical use of it. In this paper, we describe a recommendation system that achieves these two goals by overcoming the challenges facing its deployment on real services. Specifically, we developed an optimization method that alleviates the psychological barrier against using the recommendation system and clarified the performance of our method in making real recommendations. An offline test and a large-scale online test on making real recommendations showed that our method substantially expands the coverage of recommendations. As a highlight of the results, our method made recommendations to 76.9 times more users at the same level of recommendation performance as the currently used recommendation system by the service. Overall, the results show that our method has a huge impact on services and can be applied to real recommendations.|利用和管理预测模型的系统在工业领域已变得日益重要。在Yahoo!

|[Intelligent Request Strategy Design in Recommender System](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539123)|Xufeng Qian, Yue Xu, Fuyu Lv, Shengyu Zhang, Ziwen Jiang, Qingwen Liu, Xiaoyi Zeng, TatSeng Chua, Fei Wu|Zhejiang Univ, Shanghai Inst Adv Study, Shanghai AI Lab, Shanghai, Peoples R China; Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; Zhejiang Univ, Inst Artificial Intelligence, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; Alibaba Grp, Hangzhou, Peoples R China|Waterfall Recommender System (RS), a popular form of RS in mobile applications, is a stream of recommended items consisting of successive pages that can be browsed by scrolling. In waterfall RS, when a user finishes browsing a page, the edge (e.g., mobile phones) would send a request to the cloud server to get a new page of recommendations, known as the paging request mechanism. RSs typically put a large number of items into one page to reduce excessive resource consumption from numerous paging requests, which, however, would diminish the RSs' ability to timely renew the recommendations according to users' real-time interest and lead to a poor user experience. Intuitively, inserting additional requests inside pages to update the recommendations with a higher frequency can alleviate the problem. However, previous attempts, including only non-adaptive strategies (e.g., insert requests uniformly), would eventually lead to resource overconsumption. To this end, we envision a new learning task of edge intelligence named Intelligent Request Strategy Design (IRSD). It aims to improve the effectiveness of waterfall RSs by determining the appropriate occasions of request insertion based on users' real-time intention. Moreover, we propose a new paradigm of adaptive request insertion strategy named Uplift-based On-edge Smart Request Framework (AdaRequest). AdaRequest 1) captures the dynamic change of users' intentions by matching their real-time behaviors with their historical interests based on attention-based neural networks. 2) estimates the counterfactual uplift of user purchase brought by an inserted request based on causal inference. 3) determines the final request insertion strategy by maximizing the utility function under online resource constraints. We conduct extensive experiments on both offline dataset and online A/B test to verify the effectiveness of AdaRequest. Remarkably, AdaRequest has been deployed on the Waterfall RS of Taobao and brought over 3% lift on Gross Merchandise Value (GMV).|瀑布流推荐系统（RS）是移动应用中常见的推荐形式，通过连续分页呈现推荐内容流供用户滚动浏览。在该系统中，用户浏览完当前页面后，终端设备（如手机）会向云端服务器发送请求获取新推荐页，这种机制称为分页请求。为减少频繁分页导致的资源消耗，系统通常会在单页内加载大量内容，但这会降低根据用户实时兴趣动态更新推荐的能力，最终影响用户体验。直观的解决方案是在页面浏览过程中插入额外请求以提高更新频率，但现有非自适应策略（如均匀插入请求）会导致资源过度消耗。为此，我们提出名为智能请求策略设计（IRSD）的边缘智能学习任务，其核心是基于用户实时意图动态判定请求插入时机以提升推荐效果。我们进一步提出自适应请求插入框架AdaRequest，其具备三大特性：1）通过基于注意力神经网络的实时行为与历史兴趣匹配机制感知用户意图动态变化；2）基于因果推理估计插入请求带来的用户购买转化提升效应；3）在在线资源约束下通过效用函数最大化确定最终请求插入策略。通过离线和在线A/B测试的广泛实验验证了AdaRequest的有效性，该框架已在淘宝瀑布流推荐系统完成部署，推动平台总交易额（GMV）提升超3%。

As state-of-the-art models grow in size in the order of trillions of parameters, their computational complexity and cost also increase rapidly. Since 2012, the cost of deep learning doubled roughly every quarter, and this trend is likely to continue. ML practitioners have to cope with common challenges of efficient resource utilization when training such large models. In this paper, we propose a new profiling tool that cross-correlates relevant system utilization metrics and framework operations. The tool supports profiling DL models at scale, identifies performance bottlenecks, and provides insights with recommendations. We deployed the profiling functionality as an add-on to Amazon SageMaker Debugger, a fully-managed service that leverages an on-the-fly analysis system (called rules) to automatically identify complex issues in DL training jobs. By presenting deployment results and customer case studies, we show that it enables users to identify and fix issues caused by inefficient hardware resource usage, thereby reducing training time and cost.|随着深度学习(DL)的兴起，机器学习(ML)已演变为计算与数据密集型领域，通常需要多节点多GPU集群的支持。由于最先进模型的参数量已增至万亿级别，其计算复杂度和成本也快速攀升。自2012年以来，深度学习成本每季度约翻一番，且这一趋势仍将持续。机器学习从业者在训练此类大模型时，必须应对高效资源利用的共同挑战。本文提出一种新型分析工具，可对系统利用率指标与框架操作进行跨维度关联分析。该工具支持大规模深度学习模型分析，能识别性能瓶颈并提供优化建议。我们将此分析功能作为亚马逊SageMaker Debugger的扩展组件进行部署——该全托管服务通过实时分析系统（称为rules规则）自动识别深度学习训练任务中的复杂问题。通过展示部署结果和客户案例，我们证明该工具可帮助用户识别并修复因硬件资源使用效率低下导致的问题，从而有效缩短训练时间并降低成本。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Profiling+Deep+Learning+Workloads+at+Scale+using+Amazon+SageMaker)|0|
|[Generative Adversarial Networks Enhanced Pre-training for Insufficient Electronic Health Records Modeling](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539020)|Houxing Ren, Jingyuan Wang, Wayne Xin Zhao|Beihang Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China; Renmin Univ China, Gaoling Sch Artificial Intelligence, Beijing, Peoples R China|In recent years, automatic computational systems based on deep learning are widely used in medical fields, such as automatic diagnosing and disease prediction. Most of these systems are designed for data sufficient scenarios. However, due to the disease rarity or privacy, the medical data are always insufficient. When applying these data-hungry deep learning models with insufficient data, it is likely to lead to issues of over-fitting and cause serious performance problems. Many data augmentation methods have been proposed to solve the data insufficiency problem, such as using GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) to generate training data. However, the augmented data usually contains lots of noise. Directly using them to train sensitive medical models is very difficult to achieve satisfactory results. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel deep model learning method for insufficient EHR (Electronic Health Record) data modeling, namely GRACE, which stands GeneRative Adversarial networks enhanCed prE-training. In the method, we propose an item-relation-aware GAN to capture changing trends and correlations among data for generating high-quality EHR records. Furthermore, we design a pre-training mechanism consisting of a masked records prediction task and a real-fake contrastive learning task to learn representations for EHR data using both generated and real data. After the pre-training, only the representations of real data is used to train the final prediction model. In this way, we can fully exploit useful information in generated data through pre-training, and also avoid the problems caused by directly using noisy generated data to train the final prediction model. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated using extensive experiments on three healthcare-related real-world datasets. We also deploy our method in a maternal and child health care hospital for the online test. Both offline and online experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. We believe doctors and patients can benefit from our effective learning method in various healthcare-related applications.|近年来，基于深度学习的自动化计算系统在医疗领域得到广泛应用，例如自动诊断和疾病预测等场景。这类系统大多面向数据充足的情境设计，但由于疾病罕见性或隐私限制，医疗数据往往存在不足问题。当数据饥渴型深度学习模型遭遇数据不足时，极易导致过拟合现象并引发严重性能问题。虽然已有研究提出通过生成对抗网络（GAN）等数据增强方法缓解数据不足，但生成数据通常包含大量噪声，直接将其用于训练高敏感度的医疗模型难以取得理想效果。为解决这一难题，我们提出面向电子健康记录（EHR）数据建模的新型深度学习方法GRACE（GeneRative Adversarial networks enhanCed prE-training）。该方法创新性地设计具有项目关系感知能力的GAN，通过捕捉数据间的变化趋势与关联性来生成高质量EHR记录；进而构建包含掩码记录预测任务和真假对比学习任务的预训练机制，同步利用生成数据与真实数据进行表征学习。预训练完成后，仅采用真实数据的表征来训练最终预测模型。这种方式既通过预训练充分挖掘生成数据中的有效信息，又规避了直接使用含噪生成数据训练最终模型可能产生的问题。通过在三个真实世界医疗数据集上的大量实验验证，本方法的有效性得到充分证明。我们还将该方法部署于某妇幼保健院进行线上测试，离线与在线实验结果均表明所提方法具有显著优势。我们相信该高效学习方法能在各类医疗健康应用中为医生和患者创造价值。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Generative+Adversarial+Networks+Enhanced+Pre-training+for+Insufficient+Electronic+Health+Records+Modeling)|0|

However, existing studies on recommender systems have primarily focused on e-commerce platforms and other online services. They did not consider the unique features of indoor shopping in real stores such as the physical environments and objects, which significantly affect the movement and purchase behaviors of customers, thereby representing the "spatiotemporal contexts" that are critical to identifying recommendable items. In this study, we propose a gamification approach wherein a real store is emulated in a pixel world and a recurrent convolutional network is trained to learn the spatiotemporal representation of offline shopping.

Despite various scenario brings personalized service, it also leads to challenges for the recommendation on multiple scenarios, especially the scenarios with limited traffic. To give desirable recommendation service for all scenarios and reduce the cost of resource consumption, how to leverage the information from multiple scenarios to construct a unified model becomes critical. Unfortunately, the performance of existing multi-scenario recommendation approaches is poor since they introduce unnecessary information from other scenarios to target scenario. In this paper, we show it is possible to selectively utilize the information from different scenarios to construct the scenario-aware estimators in a unified model. Specifically, we first do analysis on multi-scenario modeling with causal graph from the perspective of users and modeling processes, and then propose the Causal Inspired Intervention (CausalInt) framework for multi-scenario recommendation. CausalInt consists of three modules: (1) Invariant Representation Modeling module to squeeze out the scenario-aware information through disentangled representation learning and obtain a scenario-invariant representation; (2) Negative Effects Mitigating module to resolve conflicts between different scenarios and conflicts between scenario-specific and scenario-invariant representations via gradient based orthogonal regularization and model-agnostic meta learning, respectively; (3) Inter-Scenario Transferring module designs a novel TransNet to simulate a counterfactual intervention and effectively fuse the information from other scenarios.

|[Scale Calibration of Deep Ranking Models](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539072)|Le Yan, Zhen Qin, Xuanhui Wang, Michael Bendersky, Marc Najork|Google, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA|Learning-to-Rank (LTR) systems are ubiquitous in web applications nowadays. The existing literature mainly focuses on improving ranking performance by trying to generate the optimal order of candidate items. However, virtually all advanced ranking functions are not scale calibrated. For example, rankers have the freedom to add a constant to all item scores without changing their relative order. This property has resulted in several limitations in deploying advanced ranking methods in practice. On the one hand, it limits the use of effective ranking functions in important applications. For example, in ads ranking, predicted Click-Through Rate (pCTR) is used for ranking and is required to be calibrated for the downstream ads auction. This is a major reason that existing ads ranking methods use scale calibrated pointwise loss functions that may sacrifice ranking performance. On the other hand, popular ranking losses are translation-invariant. We rigorously show that, both theoretically and empirically, this property leads to training instability that may cause severe practical issues. In this paper, we study how to perform scale calibration of deep ranking models to address the above concerns. We design three different formulations to calibrate ranking models through calibrated ranking losses. Unlike existing post-processing methods, our calibration is performed during training, which can resolve the training instability issue without any additional processing. We conduct experiments on the standard LTR benchmark datasets and one of the largest sponsored search ads dataset from Google. Our results show that our proposed calibrated ranking losses can achieve nearly optimal results in terms of both ranking quality and score scale calibration.|学习排序（LTR）系统在当今网络应用中无处不在。现有研究主要集中于通过生成候选项目的最优顺序来提升排序性能，但几乎所有先进排序函数都缺乏尺度校准能力。例如，排序模型可以随意为所有项目分数添加常数而不改变其相对顺序。这一特性导致先进排序方法在实际部署中存在诸多局限：一方面，它限制了有效排序函数在重要场景中的应用。以广告排序为例，预测点击率（pCTR）不仅需要用于排序，还需为下游广告拍卖提供校准数值，这导致现有广告排序方法不得不采用可能牺牲排序性能的尺度校准逐点损失函数。另一方面，主流排序损失函数具有平移不变性。我们通过理论分析和实证研究证明，这一特性会导致训练不稳定，进而引发严重实践问题。本文研究如何对深度排序模型进行尺度校准以解决上述问题。我们设计三种不同方案，通过校准排序损失来实现模型校准。与现有后处理方法不同，我们的校准在训练过程中同步完成，无需额外处理即可解决训练不稳定问题。我们在标准LTR基准数据集和谷歌大型赞助搜索广告数据集上的实验表明，所提出的校准排序损失函数能在排序质量和分数尺度校准方面同时达到近乎最优的结果。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Scale+Calibration+of+Deep+Ranking+Models)|0|

Xia, Hongfu Liu|Brandeis Univ, Waltham, MA 02254 USA; Guardian Life Insurance, New York, NY USA|Corporate credit ratings issued by third-party rating agencies are quantified assessments of a company's creditworthiness. Credit Ratings highly correlate to the likelihood of a company defaulting on its debt obligations. These ratings play critical roles in investment decision-making as one of the key risk factors. They are also central to the regulatory framework such as BASEL II in calculating necessary capital for financial institutions. Being able to predict rating changes will greatly benefit both investors and regulators alike. In this paper, we consider the corporate credit rating migration early prediction problem, which predicts the credit rating of an issuer will be upgraded, unchanged, or downgraded after 12 months based on its latest financial reporting information at the time. We investigate the effectiveness of different standard machine learning algorithms and conclude these models deliver inferior performance. As part of our contribution, we propose a new Multi-task Envisioning Transformer-based Autoencoder (META) model to tackle this challenging problem. META consists of Positional Encoding, Transformer-based Autoencoder, and Multi-task Prediction to learn effective representations for both migration prediction and rating prediction. This enables META to better explore the historical data in the training stage for one-year later prediction. Experimental results show that META outperforms all baseline models.|第三方评级机构发布的企业信用评级是对公司偿债能力的量化评估。信用评级与企业债务违约可能性高度相关，作为关键风险因素之一，其在投资决策中扮演着重要角色。这些评级在BASEL II等监管框架中也居于核心地位，用于计算金融机构的必要资本金。准确预测评级变化将使投资者和监管机构共同受益。本文研究企业信用评级迁移的早期预测问题，即根据发行人最新的财务报告信息，预测12个月后其信用评级将上调、维持不变或下调。我们检验了不同标准机器学习算法的有效性，发现这些模型表现欠佳。作为创新贡献，我们提出新型多任务愿景变换器自编码器（META）模型来解决这一挑战性问题。该模型通过位置编码、基于变换器的自编码器和多任务预测三大组件，有效学习适用于评级迁移预测和信用评级预测的表征表示，从而在训练阶段更好地利用历史数据实现一年后的预测。实验结果表明，META模型在所有基线模型上均展现出更优性能。

Schifferer|NVIDIA, Sao Paulo, Brazil; NVIDIA, Berlin, Germany; NVIDIA, Sarasota, FL 95051 USA; NVIDIA, Stockholm, Sweden; NVIDIA, Toronto, ON, Canada|Recommender Systems (RecSys) are the engine of the modern internet and the catalyst for human decisions. The goal of a recommender system is to generate relevant recommendations for users from a collection of items or services that might interest them. Building a recommendation system is challenging because it requires multiple stages (item retrieval, filtering, ranking, ordering) to work together seamlessly and efficiently during training and inference. The biggest challenges faced by new practitioners are the lack of understanding around what RecSys look like in the real world and the difficulty in transitioning from the simple Matrix Factorization (MF) to more complex deep learning architectures with multiple input features, neural components and prediction heads. To address these challenges on building recommender systems, NVIDIA developed an open source framework, called Merlin. Merlin consists of a set of libraries and tools to help RecSys practitioners build models and pipelines easily and more efficiently. Merlin Models provides modularized building blocks that can be easily connected to build classic and state-of-the-art models. It offers flexibility at each stage: multiple input processing/representation modules, different layers for designing the model's architecture, prediction heads, loss functions, negative sampling techniques, among others. In this hands-on tutorial, participants will start with data preparation using NVTabular an open-source feature engineering and preprocessing library designed to quickly and easily manipulate large scale datasets. Participants will then work on modeling with Merlin Models library, building the fundamental recommendation models such as MF and then transitioning to more complex deep learning-based models for candidate retrieval. In each iteration, we will demonstrate the seamless integration between data preparation and model training. Over the span of this tutorial, participants will learn the fundamentals of recommender systems modeling and how to build a two-stage recommender system easily using open source Merlin libraries.|推荐系统（RecSys）是现代互联网的引擎，也是人类决策的催化剂。其核心目标是从可能吸引用户的物品或服务集合中生成相关推荐。构建推荐系统具有挑战性，因其需要多个阶段（物品召回、过滤、排序、序列调整）在训练与推理过程中无缝高效协同运作。新手从业者面临的最大挑战在于：一方面不了解真实场景中推荐系统的实际形态，另一方面难以从简单的矩阵分解（MF）模型过渡到具有多输入特征、神经组件和预测头的复杂深度学习架构。

为应对这些挑战，英伟达开发了名为Merlin的开源框架。该框架包含一系列库和工具，可帮助推荐系统从业者更轻松高效地构建模型与流水线。Merlin Models提供模块化构建单元，通过简单连接即可搭建经典模型与最先进模型。其在每个阶段均具备灵活性：支持多输入处理/表征模块、多种模型架构设计层、可定制预测头、损失函数及负采样技术等。

在本实践教程中，学员将首先使用NVTabular进行数据准备——这是一个专为快速处理大规模数据集而设计的开源特征工程与预处理库。随后学员将通过Merlin Models库构建基础推荐模型（如矩阵分解），并逐步过渡到基于深度学习的复杂候选召回模型。每个环节都将展示数据准备与模型训练间的无缝集成。通过本教程，学员将掌握推荐系统建模的基础知识，并学会使用开源Merlin库快速构建两阶段推荐系统。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Reducing+the+Friction+for+Building+Recommender+Systems+with+Merlin)|0|
|[Modern Theoretical Tools for Designing Information Retrieval System](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3542614)|Da Xu, Chuanwei Ruan|Walmart Labs, Sunnyvale, CA 94086 USA; Instacart, San Francisco, CA USA|In the past decade, deep learning has significantly reshaped the landscape of information retrieval (IR). The community has recently begun to notice the potential dangers of overusing less-understood mechanisms and over-simplified assumptions to learn patterns and make decisions. In particular, there is growing concerns on the interpretation, reliability, social impact, and long-term utility of real-world IR systems. Therefore, it has become a pressing issue to bring the IR community comprehensive and systematic tools to understand empirical domain solutions and motivate principled design ideas. We focus on the three pillar stones of modern IR systems: pattern recognition with deep learning, causal inference analysis, and online decision making (with bandits and reinforcement learning). Our objectives are as follows. For pattern recognition, we introduce theoretical tools that address the expressivity, optimization, generalization, and model diagnostic for widespread domain practices, including models from unsupervised, (semi-)supervised, meta-learning, and online learning. For causal inference analysis, we emphasize both learning from observational studies and optimizing online experiment design, leveraging the recent theoretical advancements from various domains. Finally, for online decision making (with bandits and reinforcement learning), we aim to resolve both the conceptual and practical learning, evaluation and deployment challenges by introducing powerful tools from robust optimization and optimal control. Our tutorial is inclusive: we not only cover a broad range of heating topics, more importantly, we substantiate our discussion with the production examples at Walmart and Instacart such that audiences with different backgrounds can learn to leverage the tools as instructed. Our tutorial can serve as a guideline for practitioners seeking justifications and principled design ideas, a playbook for researchers landing their innovations on IR productions, and an introductory course for those interested in learning the advanced topics and tools of IR.|过去十年间，深度学习显著重塑了信息检索（IR）领域的发展图景。学界近期开始注意到过度使用尚未被充分理解的机制和过度简化的假设来学习模式并做出决策的潜在风险。尤其值得关注的是，现实世界信息检索系统在可解释性、可靠性、社会影响及长期效用方面正引发日益增长的担忧。因此，为信息检索领域提供全面系统的工具以理解实证领域解决方案并激发基于原理的设计理念，已成为紧迫议题。我们聚焦现代信息检索系统的三大基石：基于深度学习的模式识别、因果推理分析以及在线决策（通过多臂老虎机和强化学习实现）。我们的目标如下：在模式识别方面，引入理论工具以解决广泛领域实践中的表达能力、优化、泛化及模型诊断问题，涵盖无监督、（半）监督、元学习及在线学习等模型；在因果推理分析方面，结合多领域最新理论进展，重点探讨从观察性研究中学习以及优化在线实验设计；最后针对在线决策（通过多臂老虎机和强化学习），通过引入鲁棒优化和最优控制的强大工具，旨在解决概念层面和实践层面的学习、评估与部署挑战。本教程具有广泛包容性：不仅涵盖众多热点议题，更重要的是通过沃尔玛和Instacart的生产案例实证分析，使不同背景的受众能按指导有效运用这些工具。本教程既可作为寻求理论依据与原理化设计思路的实践者指南，也可作为研究人员将其创新落地于信息检索产品的操作手册，同时还能为有意深入了解信息检索前沿议题与工具的学习者提供入门课程。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Modern+Theoretical+Tools+for+Designing+Information+Retrieval+System)|0|

They provide recommendation services in various areas, including shopping, eating, travelling and entertainment. RSs have achieved a great success and benefted the society. However, most of the research on RS has focused on the improvement of the recommendation accuracy, while ignoring other important qualities, such as trustworthiness (robustness, fairness, explainability, privacy and security) and social impact (influence on users' recognition and behaviours) of the recommendations. These are important aspects and cannot be overlooked since they measure properties that determine whether the recommendation service is reliable, trustworthy and benefcial to individual users and society. In this work, responsible recommendations refer to trustworthy recommendation techniques and positive-social-impact recommendation results. This workshop aims to engage with active researchers from the RS community, and other communities, as social science, to discuss state-of-the-art research results related to the core challenges of responsible recommendation services. We will focus on two main topics of responsible RSs: (1) developing reliable and trustworthy RS models and algorithms, to provide reliable recommendation results when facing a complex, uncertain and dynamic scenario; (2) assessing the social influence of RSs on human's recognition and behaviours and ensuring the influence is positive to the society.|随着数据科学与人工智能技术的进步，推荐系统日益呈现出更强大的功能与更高的精准度。这类系统已在购物、餐饮、旅行、娱乐等多个领域提供推荐服务，取得了显著成功并产生了积极的社会效益。然而现有研究大多聚焦于提升推荐准确度，却忽视了其他重要特性——包括推荐结果的可信度（涵盖鲁棒性、公平性、可解释性、隐私保护与安全性）以及社会影响（对用户认知与行为模式的塑造作用）。这些维度至关重要，因其直接决定了推荐服务是否具备可靠性、可信度以及对用户与社会产生正向价值。本研究将"负责任推荐"定义为兼具技术可信度与社会正向影响力的推荐范式。本次研讨会旨在汇聚推荐系统领域及其他相关学科（如社会科学）的活跃研究者，共同探讨负责任推荐服务的核心挑战与前沿研究成果。我们将重点关注两大主题：（1）开发可靠且可信的推荐模型与算法，使其在复杂、不确定和动态场景中仍能提供稳健的推荐结果；（2）评估推荐系统对人类认知与行为的社会影响，并确保这种影响对社会产生积极推动作用。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Data+Science+and+Artificial+Intelligence+for+Responsible+Recommendations)|0|

Due to the rapid technological and commercial innovation that opens up an ever-expanding set of products, the insufficient labeling data renders existing supervised or semi-supervised fraud detection models ineffective in these emerging services. However, the ever accumulated user behavioral data on online platforms might be helpful in improving the performance of fraud detection on newborn services. To this end, in this paper, we propose to pre-train user behavior sequences, which consist of orderly arranged actions, from the large-scale unlabeled data sources for online fraud detection. Recent studies illustrate accurate extraction of user intentions~(formed by consecutive actions) in behavioral sequences can propel improvements in the performance of online fraud detection. By anatomizing the characteristic of online fraud activities, we devise a model named UB-PTM that learns knowledge of fraud activities by three agent tasks at different granularities, i.e., action, intention, and sequence levels, from large-scale unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on three downstream transaction and user-level online fraud detection tasks demonstrate that our UB-PTM is able to outperform the state-of-the-art designing for specific tasks.|新冠疫情催生了大量新兴在线服务,同时也滋生了多样化的网络欺诈活动。由于技术和商业创新快速发展带来产品种类不断扩展,标注数据的匮乏使得现有监督或半监督欺诈检测模型在这些新兴服务中效果有限。然而,在线平台上持续积累的用户行为数据可能有助于提升新兴服务的欺诈检测性能。为此,本文提出从大规模无标注数据源中预训练用户行为序列(由有序排列的操作组成)以进行在线欺诈检测。近期研究表明,准确提取行为序列中用户意图(由连续操作形成)能够有效提升在线欺诈检测性能。通过剖析网络欺诈活动特征,我们设计了UB-PTM模型,该模型通过动作、意图和序列三个不同粒度的代理任务,从大规模无标注数据中学习欺诈活动知识。在三个下游交易级和用户级在线欺诈检测任务上的大量实验表明,我们的UB-PTM模型能够超越针对特定任务设计的最先进方案。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=User+Behavior+Pre-training+for+Online+Fraud+Detection)|0|
|[Sampling-based Estimation of the Number of Distinct Values in Distributed Environment](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539390)|Jiajun Li, Zhewei Wei, Bolin Ding, Xiening Dai, Lu Lu, Jingren Zhou|Renmin Univ China, Beijing, Peoples R China; Alibaba Grp, Hangzhou, Peoples R China|In data mining, estimating the number of distinct values (NDV) is a fundamental problem with various applications. Existing methods for estimating NDV can be broadly classified into two categories: i) scanning-based methods, which scan the entire data and maintain a sketch to approximate NDV; and ii) sampling-based methods, which estimate NDV using sampling data rather than accessing the entire data warehouse. Scanning-based methods achieve a lower approximation error at the cost of higher I/O and more time. Sampling-based estimation is preferable in applications with a large data volume and a permissible error restriction due to its higher scalability. However, while the sampling-based method is more effective on a single machine, it is less practical in a distributed environment with massive data volumes. For obtaining the final NDV estimators, the entire sample must be transferred throughout the distributed system, incurring a prohibitive communication cost when the sample rate is significant. This paper proposes a novel sketch-based distributed method that achieves sub-linear communication costs for distributed sampling-based NDV estimation under mild assumptions. Our method leverages a sketch-based algorithm to estimate the sample's frequency of frequency in the distributed streaming model, which is compatible with most classical sampling-based NDV estimators. Additionally, we provide theoretical evidence for our method's ability to minimize communication costs in the worst-case scenario. Extensive experiments show that our method saves orders of magnitude in communication costs compared to existing sampling- and sketch-based methods.|在数据挖掘领域，基数估计（NDV）是一个具有多种应用价值的基础性问题。现有NDV估计方法可分为两大类：一是基于扫描的方法，通过全量扫描数据并维护草图结构来近似估算基数；二是基于采样的方法，利用样本数据而非访问整个数据仓库进行估计。基于扫描的方法虽能实现较低近似误差，但需付出更高的I/O开销和时间成本。基于采样的方法因其更优的可扩展性，更适合数据量庞大且允许一定误差的应用场景。然而，尽管基于采样的方法在单机环境下表现优异，但在海量数据分布式环境中实用性有限——为获得最终基数估计值，需将完整样本在分布式系统中传输，当采样率较高时会产生难以承受的通信开销。本文提出一种基于草图的创新分布式方法，在温和假设条件下实现分布式采样基数估计的次线性通信成本。该方法通过基于草图的算法在分布式流模型下估计样本的频数之频数，可与多数经典采样基数估计器兼容。此外，我们通过理论证明该方法在最坏情况下仍能最小化通信成本。大量实验表明，相较现有基于采样和草图的方法，本方法可节省数量级的通信开销。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Sampling-based+Estimation+of+the+Number+of+Distinct+Values+in+Distributed+Environment)|0|

Given a finite sample, an empirical average is used as a standard estimation of the target kernel mean. Prior works have shown that better estimators can be constructed by shrinkage methods. In this work, we propose to corrupt data examples with noise from known distributions and present a new kernel mean estimator, called the marginalized kernel mean estimator, which estimates kernel mean under the corrupted distributions. Theoretically, we justify that the marginalized kernel mean estimator introduces implicit regularization in kernel mean estimation. Empirically, on a variety of tasks, we show that the marginalized kernel mean estimator is sample-efficient and obtains much lower estimation errors than the existing estimators.|再生核希尔伯特空间中的核均值估计是众多基于核的学习算法的核心。给定有限样本，经验平均值通常被用作目标核均值的标准估计方法。先前研究已证明，通过收缩方法可以构建出更优的估计量。本研究提出通过已知分布噪声干扰数据样本，进而提出一种新型核均值估计器——边缘化核均值估计器，该估计器可在受干扰分布下实现核均值估计。理论上，我们证明了边缘化核均值估计器在核均值估计中引入了隐式正则化机制。在实证研究中，通过多任务测试表明，边缘化核均值估计器具有优异的样本效率，其估计误差显著低于现有估计器。

Feature estimation is a crucial problem for analyzing real-world graphs whose features are commonly missing during the data collection process. Accurate estimation not only provides diverse information of nodes but also supports the inference of graph neural networks that require the full observation of node features. However, designing an effective approach for estimating high-dimensional features is challenging, since it requires an estimator to have large representation power, increasing the risk of overfitting. In this work, we propose SVGA (Structured Variational Graph Autoencoder), an accurate method for feature estimation. SVGA applies strong regularization to the distribution of latent variables by structured variational inference, which models the prior of variables as Gaussian Markov random field based on the graph structure. As a result, SVGA combines the advantages of probabilistic inference and graph neural networks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in real datasets.|给定一个节点特征存在部分观测的图，我们如何准确估计缺失特征？特征估计是分析现实世界图数据的关键问题，由于数据收集过程中常出现特征缺失现象。精确的特征估计不仅能提供丰富的节点信息，还能支持需要完整节点特征观测的图神经网络进行推理。然而，为高维特征估计设计有效方法具有挑战性，因为这要求估计器具备强大表征能力，同时会增大过拟合风险。本研究提出SVGA（结构化变分图自编码器）——一种精准的特征估计方法。该方法通过结构化变分推断对潜在变量分布实施强正则化，将变量先验建模为基于图结构的高斯马尔可夫随机场。SVGA由此融合了概率推断与图神经网络的双重优势，在真实数据集中实现了最先进的性能表现。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Accurate+Node+Feature+Estimation+with+Structured+Variational+Graph+Autoencoder)|0|

The problem of Answer Sentence Selection (AS2) refers to the task of selecting sentences, from a larger text, that are relevant and contain the answer to users' queries. While there has been a lot of success in building AS2 systems trained on open-domain data (e.g., SQuAD, NQ), they do not generalize well in closed-domain settings, since domain adaptation can be challenging due to poor availability and annotation expense of domain-specific data. This paper proposes SEDAN, an effective self-learning framework to adapt AS2 models for domain-specific applications. We leverage large pre-trained language models to automatically generate domain-specific QA pairs for domain adaptation. We further fine-tune a pre-trained Sentence-BERT architecture to capture semantic relatedness between questions and answer sentences for AS2.

|[CONFLUX: A Request-level Fusion Framework for Impression Allocation via Cascade Distillation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539044)|XiaoYu Wang, Bin Tan, Yonghui Guo, Tao Yang, Dongbo Huang, Lan Xu, Nikolaos M. Freris, Hao Zhou, Xiangyang Li|Tencent Advertising, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; Univ Sci & Technol China, LINKE Lab, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China|Guaranteed delivery (GD) and real-time bidding (RTB) constitute two parallel profit streams for the publisher. The diverse advertiser demands (brand or instant effect) result in different selling (in bulk or via auction) and pricing (fixed unit price or various bids) patterns, which naturally raises the fusion allocation issue of breaking the two markets' barrier and selling out at the global highest price boosting the total revenue. The fusion process complicates the competition between GD and RTB, and GD contracts with overlapping targeting. The non-stationary user traffic and bid landscape further worsen the situation, making the assignment unsupervised and hard to evaluate. Thus, a static policy or coarse-grained modeling from existing work is inferior to facing the above challenges. This paper proposes CONFLUX, a fusion framework located at the confluence of the parallel GD and RTB markets. CONFLUX functions in a cascaded process: a paradigm is first forged via linear programming to supervise CONFLUX's training, then a cumbersome network distills such paradigm by precisely modeling the competition at a request level and further transfers the generalization ability to a lightweight student via knowledge distillation. Finally, fine-tuning is periodically executed at the online stage to remedy the student's degradation, and a temporal distillation loss between the current and the previous model serves as a regularizer to prevent over-fitting. The procedure is analogous to a cascade distillation and hence its name. CONFLUX has been deployed on the Tencent advertising system for over six months through extensive experiments. Online A/B tests present a lift of 3.29%, 1.77%, and 3.63% of ad income, overall click-through rate, and cost-per-mille, respectively, which jointly contribute a revenue increase by hundreds of thousands RMB per day. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/zslomo/CONFLUX.|保量投放（GD）与实时竞价（RTB）构成了发布商的两大并行收益渠道。品牌广告主与效果广告主的不同需求（品牌曝光或即时转化），导致了不同的销售模式（批量预售或实时竞价）与定价机制（固定单价或动态出价），这自然引出了打破两个市场壁垒、以全局最高价售出库存并提升总收益的融合分配问题。该融合过程使得GD与RTB的竞争关系复杂化，且存在目标受众重叠的GD合约。非稳态的用户流量与竞价环境进一步加剧了问题难度，导致分配过程缺乏监督信号且难以评估。因此，面对上述挑战时，静态策略或现有工作的粗粒度建模方法均存在明显不足。

本文提出CONFLUX框架，该框架立足于GD与RTB并行市场的交汇点。CONFLUX采用级联式架构运作：首先通过线性规划构建最优分配范式以指导模型训练；随后通过笨重教师网络对请求级竞争关系进行精确建模，并利用知识蒸馏将泛化能力迁移至轻量级学生网络；最后在在线阶段定期执行微调以修正模型退化，同时通过当前模型与历史模型间的时序蒸馏损失作为正则项防止过拟合。该流程类似于级联蒸馏过程，故得名CONFLUX。本框架已在腾讯广告系统持续部署超过六个月，大量实验表明：在线A/B测试中广告收入、整体点击率和千次展示收益分别提升3.29%、1.77%和3.63，共同实现每日数十万元人民币的收入增长。代码已开源：https://github.com/zslomo/CONFLUX。

Existing methods first train a model to predict the conversion probability of the advertisement journeys with historical data and calculate the attribution of each touchpoint by using the results counterfactual predictions. An assumption of these works is the conversion prediction model is unbiased. It can give accurate predictions on any randomly assigned journey, including both the factual and counterfactual ones. Nevertheless, this assumption does not always hold as the user preferences act as the common cause for both ad generation and user conversion, involving the confounding bias and leading to an out-of-distribution (OOD) problem in the counterfactual prediction. In this paper, we define the causal MTA task and propose CausalMTA to solve this problem. It systemically eliminates the confounding bias from both static and dynamic perspectives and learn an unbiased conversion prediction model using historical data. We also provide a theoretical analysis to prove the effectiveness of CausalMTA with sufficient ad journeys.

Lee, Feng Shi, Jiliang Tang|Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; TigerGraph, Redwood City, CA 94065 USA|Machine learning on graph data has become a common area of interest across academia and industry. However, due to the size of real-world industry graphs (hundreds of millions of vertices and billions of edges) and the special architecture of graph neural net- works, it is still a challenge for practitioners and researchers to perform machine learning tasks on large-scale graph data. It typi- cally takes a powerful and expensive GPU machine to train a graph neural network on a million-vertex scale graph, let alone doing deep learning on real enterprise graphs. In this tutorial, we will cover how to develop and run performant graph algorithms and graph neural network models with TigerGraph [3], a massively parallel platform for graph analytics, and its Machine Learning Workbench with PyTorch Geometric [4] and DGL [8] support. Using an NFT transaction dataset [6], we will first investigate transactions using graph algorithms by themselves as methods of graph traversing, clustering, classification, and determining similarities between data. Secondly, we will show how to use those graph-derived features such as PageRank and embeddings to empower traditional machine learning models. Finally, we will demonstrate how to train common graph neural networks with TigerGraph and how to implement novel graph neural network models. Participants will use the Tiger- Graph ML Workbench Cloud to perform graph feature engineering and train their machine learning algorithms during the session.|图数据上的机器学习已成为学术界与工业界的共同关注点。然而，由于现实工业级图谱的庞大规模（数亿顶点与数十亿边）以及图神经网络的特殊架构，从业者与研究者在大规模图数据上执行机器学习任务仍面临挑战。通常需要配备高性能昂贵GPU的机器才能训练百万级顶点规模的图神经网络，更不用说在真实企业级图谱上进行深度学习。本教程将系统介绍如何利用TigerGraph[3]——一个支持大规模并行图分析的计算平台及其集成PyTorch Geometric[4]和DGL[8]的机器学习工作台，来开发并运行高性能图算法与图神经网络模型。我们将以NFT交易数据集[6]为例，首先演示如何通过图遍历、聚类、分类及数据相似性判定等图算法进行交易分析；其次展示如何运用PageRank和嵌入表示等图衍生特征增强传统机器学习模型；最后详解基于TigerGraph训练常见图神经网络的方法及创新模型的实现路径。参会者将使用TigerGraph机器学习云工作台，在课程中实际完成图特征工程与机器学习算法训练。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Efficient+Machine+Learning+on+Large-Scale+Graphs)|0|
|[FreeKD: Free-direction Knowledge Distillation for Graph Neural Networks](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539320)|Kaituo Feng, Changsheng Li, Ye Yuan, Guoren Wang|Beijing Inst Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China|Knowledge distillation (KD) has demonstrated its effectiveness to boost the performance of graph neural networks (GNNs), where its goal is to distill knowledge from a deeper teacher GNN into a shallower student GNN. However, it is actually difficult to train a satisfactory teacher GNN due to the well-known over-parametrized and over-smoothing issues, leading to invalid knowledge transfer in practical applications. In this paper, we propose the first Free-direction Knowledge Distillation framework via Reinforcement learning for GNNs, called FreeKD, which is no longer required to provide a deeper well-optimized teacher GNN. The core idea of our work is to collaboratively build two shallower GNNs in an effort to exchange knowledge between them via reinforcement learning in a hierarchical way. As we observe that one typical GNN model often has better and worse performances at different nodes during training, we devise a dynamic and free-direction knowledge transfer strategy that consists of two levels of actions: 1) node-level action determines the directions of knowledge transfer between the corresponding nodes of two networks; and then 2) structure-level action determines which of the local structures generated by the node-level actions to be propagated. In essence, our FreeKD is a general and principled framework which can be naturally compatible with GNNs of different architectures. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate our FreeKD outperforms two base GNNs in a large margin, and shows its efficacy to various GNNs. More surprisingly, our FreeKD has comparable or even better performance than traditional KD algorithms that distill knowledge from a deeper and stronger teacher GNN.|知识蒸馏（KD）已证明能有效提升图神经网络（GNN）性能，其核心目标是将深层教师GNN的知识提炼到浅层学生GNN中。然而由于众所周知的过参数化和过平滑问题，实际应用中难以训练出令人满意的教师GNN，导致知识传递失效。本文提出首个基于强化学习的自由方向知识蒸馏框架FreeKD，该框架不再需要提供经过深度优化的教师GNN。我们的核心思想是通过强化学习以分层方式协同构建两个浅层GNN，实现二者间的知识交换。通过观察到典型GNN模型在训练过程中不同节点往往存在性能波动，我们设计了一种动态自由方向知识传递策略，该策略包含两级动作：1）节点级动作决定两个网络对应节点间的知识传递方向；2）结构级动作决定由节点级动作生成的哪些局部结构需要传播。本质上，FreeKD是一个通用且具有原则性的框架，可自然兼容不同架构的GNN。在五个基准数据集上的大量实验表明，FreeKD显著优于两个基线GNN，并证明其对各类GNN的有效性。更令人惊讶的是，FreeKD的性能与传统KD算法（从更深层、更强壮的教师GNN中提取知识）相当甚至更优。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=FreeKD:+Free-direction+Knowledge+Distillation+for+Graph+Neural+Networks)|0|

Among others, inverse protein folding is a fundamental task in protein design, which aims at generating protein's amino acid sequence given a 3D graph structure. However, most existing methods for inverse protein folding are based on sequential generative models and therefore limited in uncertainty quantification and exploration ability to the entire protein space. To address the issues, we propose a sampling method for inverse protein folding (SIPF). Specifically, we formulate inverse protein folding as a sampling problem and design two pretrained neural networks as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) proposal distribution. To ensure sampling efficiency, we further design (i) an adaptive sampling scheme to select variables for sampling and (ii) an approximate target distribution as a surrogate of the unavailable target distribution. Empirical studies have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of SIPF, achieving 7.4% relative improvement on recovery rate and 6.4% relative reduction in perplexity compared to the best baseline.|蛋白质工程在药物发现领域具有重要应用价值。其中，逆蛋白质折叠是蛋白质设计中的一项基础性任务，其目标是根据三维图结构生成蛋白质的氨基酸序列。然而，现有的大多数逆蛋白质折叠方法基于序列生成模型，因此存在不确定性量化能力不足以及对整个蛋白质空间探索能力有限的问题。为解决这些局限性，我们提出了一种逆蛋白质折叠采样方法（SIPF）。具体而言，我们将逆蛋白质折叠问题构建为采样问题，并设计两个预训练神经网络作为马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛（MCMC）的建议分布。为确保采样效率，我们进一步设计了：（1）自适应采样方案用于选择待采样变量；（2）近似目标分布作为不可获得目标分布的替代。实证研究验证了SIPF方法的有效性，与最佳基线相比，恢复率相对提升7.4%，困惑度相对降低6.4%。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=SIPF:+Sampling+Method+for+Inverse+Protein+Folding)|0|
|[Antibody Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs) design using Constrained Energy Model](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539285)|Tianfan Fu, Jimeng Sun|Georgia Inst Technol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL USA|In recent years, therapeutic antibodies have become one of the fastest-growing classes of drugs and have been approved for the treatment of a wide range of indications, from cancer to autoimmune diseases. Complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) are part of the variable chains in antibodies and determine specific antibody-antigen binding. Some explorations use in silicon methods to design antibody CDR loops. However, the existing methods faced the challenges of maintaining the specific geometry shape of the CDR loops. This paper proposes a Constrained Energy Model (CEM) to address this issue. Specifically, we design a constrained manifold to characterize the geometry constraints of the CDR loops. Then we design the energy model in the constrained manifold and only depict the energy landscape of the manifold instead of the whole space in the vanilla energy model. The geometry shape of the generated CDR loops is automatically preserved. Theoretical analysis shows that learning on the constrained manifold requires less sample complexity than the unconstrained method. CEM's superiority is validated via thorough empirical studies, achieving consistent and significant improvement with up to 33.4% relative reduction in terms of 3D geometry error (Root Mean Square Deviation, RMSD) and 8.4% relative reduction in terms of amino acid sequence metric (perplexity) compared to the best baseline method.

The core of PLL is to learn efficient feature representations to facilitate label disambiguation. However, existing PLL methods only learn plain representations by coarse supervision, which is incapable of capturing sufficiently distinguishable representations, especially when confronted with the knotty label ambiguity, i.e., certain candidate labels share similar visual patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel framework partial label learning with semantic label representations dubbed ParSE, which consists of two synergistic processes, including visual-semantic representation learning and powerful label disambiguation. In the former process, we propose a novel weighted calibration rank loss that has two implications. First, it implies a progressive calibration strategy that utilizes the disambiguated label confidence to weight the similarity between each image feature embedding and its corresponding semantic label representations of all candidates. Second, it also considers the ranking relationship between candidate and non-candidate ones. Based on learned visual-semantic representations, subsequent label disambiguation is desirably endowed with more powerful abilities. Experiments on benchmarks show that ParSE outperforms state-of-the-art counterparts.|部分标记学习（PLL）致力于解决每个训练实例被赋予候选标记集合、而其中仅有一个为真实标记的问题。其核心在于学习有效的特征表示以促进标记消歧。然而现有PLL方法仅通过粗粒度监督学习平面表示，难以捕获足够区分的特征表征，尤其在处理棘手的标记模糊性问题时（即某些候选标记具有相似视觉模式）。本文提出新型语义标签表示框架ParSE，该框架包含视觉-语义表示学习与强效标记消歧两个协同过程。在前者中，我们提出具有双重作用的新型加权校准排序损失：一方面采用渐进式校准策略，利用已消解的标记置信度加权处理图像特征嵌入与所有候选语义标签表示之间的相似度；另一方面综合考虑候选标记与非候选标记间的排序关系。基于学习到的视觉-语义表示，后续标记消歧过程被赋予更强大的能力。基准测试表明，ParSE性能优于现有最先进方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Partial+Label+Learning+with+Semantic+Label+Representations)|0|

The algorithm works as a drop-in replacement that preserves all estimation properties of the HyperLogLog sketch, it is possible to convert back and forth between the compressed and uncompressed representations, and the compressed sketch maintains mergeability in the compressed domain. The compressed sketch can be updated in amortized constant time, assuming n is sufficiently larger than m. We provide a C++ implementation of the sketch, and show by experimental evaluation against well-known implementations by Google and Apache that our implementation provides small sketches while maintaining competitive update and merge times. Concretely, we observed approximately a 40% reduction in the sketch size. Furthermore, we obtain as a corollary a theoretical algorithm that compresses the sketch down to $młog_2łog_2łog_2łog_2 m+O(młogłogłog m/łogłog m+łogłog n)$ bits.|我们提出HyperLogLogLog——一种实用的HyperLogLog草图压缩方案，将用于估计不同元素数量n的m个寄存器草图从$O(m\log\log n)$比特压缩至$m\log_2\log_2\log_2 m + O(m+\log\log n)$比特。该算法可作为即插即用的替代方案，完整保留HyperLogLog草图的所有估计特性，支持压缩与未压缩表示形式之间的双向转换，且在压缩状态下仍保持可合并性。当n远大于m时，压缩草图的更新操作可在摊销常数时间内完成。我们提供了该草图的C++实现，并通过与谷歌和Apache知名实现的实验对比表明：我们的实现能在保持竞争力的更新与合并速度的同时，显著减小草图体积——具体观测到近40%的体积缩减。此外，我们推导出一个理论算法作为推论，可将草图进一步压缩至$m\log_2\log_2\log_2\log_2 m+O(m\log\log\log m/\log\log m+\log\log n)$比特。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=HyperLogLogLog:+Cardinality+Estimation+With+One+Log+More)|0|

SGMs are known to surpass other generative models, e.g., generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs). Being inspired by their big success, in this work, we fully customize them for generating fake tabular data. In particular, we are interested in oversampling minor classes since imbalanced classes frequently lead to sub-optimal training outcomes. To our knowledge, we are the first presenting a score-based tabular data oversampling method. Firstly, we re-design our own score network since we have to process tabular data. Secondly, we propose two options for our generation method: the former is equivalent to a style transfer for tabular data and the latter uses the standard generative policy of SGMs. Lastly, we define a fine-tuning method, which further enhances the oversampling quality.

However, new systems often have limited data for training the model, calling for effective knowledge transfer from other relevant grids. Specifically, Domain Adaptation (DA) seeks domain-invariant features to boost the model performance in the target domain. Nonetheless, existing DA techniques face significant challenges due to the unique characteristics of physical datasets: (1) complex spatial-temporal correlations, (2) diverse data sources including node/edge measurements and labels, and (3) large-scale data sizes. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-graph DA based on two core designs of graph kernels and graph coarsening. The former design handles spatial-temporal correlations and can incorporate networked measurements and labels conveniently. The spatial structures, temporal trends, measurement similarity, and label information together determine the similarity of two graphs, guiding the DA to find domain-invariant features. Mathematically, we construct a Graph kerNel-based distribution Adaptation (GNA) with a specifically-designed graph kernel. Then, we prove the proposed kernel is positive definite and universal, which strictly guarantees the feasibility of the used DA measure. However, the computation cost of the kernel is prohibitive for large systems. In response, we propose a novel coarsening process to obtain much smaller graphs for GNA. Finally, we report the superiority of GNA in diversified systems, including power systems, mass-damper systems, and human-activity sensing systems.|物理系统正通过低成本、低功耗传感器及先进的数据挖掘与机器学习技术，将监测能力延伸至边缘区域。然而，新建系统往往缺乏足够的训练数据，亟需从其他相关电网中实现有效的知识迁移。具体而言，域适应（DA）通过寻找域不变特征来提升模型在目标域的性能。但由于物理数据集具有三大独特特性：（1）复杂的时空相关性；（2）节点/边缘测量值和标签等多源数据；（3）大规模数据量，现有DA技术面临重大挑战。本文提出基于图核与图粗化双核心设计的新型跨图域适应方法。前者通过专门设计的图核处理时空相关性，并可无缝整合网络化测量值与标签数据——空间结构、时间趋势、测量相似性和标签信息共同决定了图的相似度，从而指导DA寻找域不变特征。在数学层面，我们构建了基于图核的分布自适应（GNA）框架，并严格证明了所提出核函数的正定性与普适性，从理论上保障了DA度量的可行性。针对大型系统核计算成本过高的问题，我们创新性地提出粗化处理方案，为GNA生成规模显著缩减的图结构。最终在电力系统、质量-阻尼系统和人体活动感知系统等多元场景中验证了GNA的优越性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Domain+Adaptation+in+Physical+Systems+via+Graph+Kernel)|0|

Although representation learning has advantages in prediction accuracy, it is inherently deficient in the abilities to interpret or to reason well. It has long been realized as far back as in 1990 by Marvin Minsky that connectionist networks and symbolic rules should co-exist in a system and overcome the deficiencies of each other. The goal of this paper is to show that it is feasible to simultaneously and efficiently perform representation learning (for connectionist networks) and rule learning spontaneously out of the same online training process for graph streams. We devise such a system called RL$^2$, and show, both analytically and empirically, that it is highly efficient and responsive for graph streams, and produces good results for both representation learning and rule learning in terms of prediction accuracy and returning top-quality rules for interpretation and building dynamic Bayesian networks.|异构图流在当今应用中十分普遍。尽管表示学习在预测准确性方面具有优势，但其在解释与推理能力方面存在固有不足。早在1990年，马文·明斯基就已指出：连接主义网络与符号规则应当共存于系统中，以相互弥补不足。本文旨在证明，针对图流数据，通过同一在线训练过程同步高效地实现表示学习（面向连接主义网络）与规则自主学习具有可行性。我们设计了名为RL$^2$的系统，通过理论分析和实验验证表明：该系统对图流处理具有高效性与快速响应特性，在表示学习和规则学习方面均能取得优异成果——既保证了预测精度，又能产出高质量规则用于解释推理与构建动态贝叶斯网络。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=RL2:+A+Call+for+Simultaneous+Representation+Learning+and+Rule+Learning+for+Graph+Streams)|0|
|[Learning Models of Individual Behavior in Chess](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539367)|Reid McIlroyYoung, Russell Wang, Siddhartha Sen, Jon M. Kleinberg, Ashton Anderson|Microsoft Res, New York, NY USA; Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA USA; Cornell, Ithaca, NY USA|AI systems that can capture human-like behavior are becoming increasingly useful in situations where humans may want to learn from these systems, collaborate with them, or engage with them as partners for an extended duration. In order to develop human-oriented AI systems, the problem of predicting human actions---as opposed to predicting optimal actions---has received considerable attention. Existing work has focused on capturing human behavior in an aggregate sense, which potentially limits the benefit any particular individual could gain from interaction with these systems. We extend this line of work by developing highly accurate predictive models of individual human behavior in chess. Chess is a rich domain for exploring human-AI interaction because it combines a unique set of properties: AI systems achieved superhuman performance many years ago, and yet humans still interact with them closely, both as opponents and as preparation tools, and there is an enormous corpus of recorded data on individual player games. Starting with Maia, an open-source version of AlphaZero trained on a population of human players, we demonstrate that we can significantly improve prediction accuracy of a particular player's moves by applying a series of fine-tuning methods. Furthermore, our personalized models can be used to perform stylometry---predicting who made a given set of moves---indicating that they capture human decision-making at an individual level. Our work demonstrates a way to bring AI systems into better alignment with the behavior of individual people, which could lead to large improvements in human-AI interaction.|能够模拟人类行为的AI系统正变得日益重要，这类系统适用于人类向其学习、与其协作或长期作为合作伙伴等场景。为开发以人类为中心的AI系统，预测人类行为（而非最优行为）的问题已受到广泛关注。现有研究主要聚焦于从整体层面捕捉人类行为模式，这可能限制了个体从与系统互动中获得的收益。我们通过构建高精度的国际象棋个人行为预测模型拓展了这一研究方向。国际象棋是探索人机交互的绝佳领域，因其兼具以下特性：多年前AI系统就已实现超人类水平的表现，但人类仍以对手和训练工具的形式与之密切互动，且存在海量的个人棋局数据记录。基于开源人类棋手训练版AlphaZero——Maia系统，我们通过应用系列微调方法，显著提升了对特定棋手行棋预测的准确率。此外，个性化模型可实现笔迹鉴定式预测（通过棋路风格识别对应棋手），这表明模型能在个体层面捕捉人类决策特征。本研究展示了使AI系统更好契合个体行为特征的技术路径，有望显著提升人机交互体验。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Learning+Models+of+Individual+Behavior+in+Chess)|0|

Motivated by the fact that the arms usually exhibit group behaviors and the mutual impacts exist among groups, we introduce a new model, Arm Group Graph (AGG), where the nodes represent the groups of arms and the weighted edges formulate the correlations among groups. To leverage the rich information in AGG, we propose a bandit algorithm, AGG-UCB, where the neural networks are designed to estimate rewards, and we propose to utilize graph neural networks (GNN) to learn the representations of arm groups with correlations. To solve the exploitation-exploration dilemma in bandits, we derive a new upper confidence bound (UCB) built on neural networks (exploitation) for exploration. Furthermore, we prove that AGG-UCB can achieve a near-optimal regret bound with over-parameterized neural networks, and provide the convergence analysis of GNN with fully-connected layers which may be of independent interest.

This may bring in unwanted bias since RL is a reward maximizing process instead of simple label matching. Given such an issue, we denote the frame importance as its contribution to the expected reward on a particular frame, and hypothesize that adapting such frame importance could benefit the performance of the distilled student policy. To verify our hypothesis, we analyze why and how frame importance matters in RL settings. Based on the analysis, we propose an importance prioritized PD framework that highlights the training on important frames, so as to learn efficiently. Particularly, the frame importance is measured by the reciprocal of weighted Shannon entropy from a teacher policy's action prescriptions. Experiments on Atari games and policy compression tasks show that capturing the frame importance significantly boosts the performance of the distilled policies.|策略蒸馏（PD）在深度强化学习（RL）领域已被广泛研究，但现有方法通常假设决策序列中的演示数据（即帧中的状态-动作对）呈均匀分布。这种假设可能引入偏差，因为强化学习本质是奖励最大化过程而非简单的标签匹配。针对该问题，我们将帧重要性定义为其对特定帧预期奖励的贡献度，并提出假设：适配帧重要性可提升被蒸馏学生策略的性能。为验证该假设，我们分析了帧重要性在强化学习环境中产生影响的机理，并基于此提出重要性优先的策略蒸馏框架，通过突出重要帧的训练实现高效学习。具体而言，帧重要性通过教师策略动作分布的加权香农熵倒数进行量化。在Atari游戏和策略压缩任务上的实验表明，捕捉帧重要性能够显著提升蒸馏策略的性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Importance+Prioritized+Policy+Distillation)|0|
|[DICE: Domain-attack Invariant Causal Learning for Improved Data Privacy Protection and Adversarial Robustness](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539242)|Qibing Ren, Yiting Chen, Yichuan Mo, Qitian Wu, Junchi Yan|Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China|The adversarial attack reveals the vulnerability of deep models by incurring test domain shift, while delusive attack relieves the privacy concern about personal data by injecting malicious noise into the training domain to make data unexploitable. However, beyond their successful applications, the two attacks can be easily defended by adversarial training (AT). While AT is not the panacea, it suffers from poor generalization for robustness. For the limitations of attack and defense, we argue that to fit data well, DNNs can learn the spurious relations between inputs and outputs, which are consequently utilized by the attack and defense and degrade their effectiveness, and DNNs can not easily capture the causal relations like humans to make robust decisions under attacks. In this paper, to better understand and improve attack and defense, we first take a bottom-up perspective to describe the correlations between latent factors and observed data, then analyze the effect of domain shift on DNNs induced by attack and finally develop our causal graph, namely Domain-attack Invariant Causal Model (DICM). Based on DICM, we propose a coherent causal invariant principle, which guides our algorithm design to infer the human-like causal relations. We call our algorithm Domain-attack Invariant Causal Learning (DICE) and the experimental results on two attacks and one defense task verify its effectiveness.|对抗性攻击通过引发测试域偏移揭示深度模型的脆弱性，而欺骗性攻击则通过向训练域注入恶意噪声使数据无法被利用，从而缓解个人隐私担忧。然而这两种攻击虽成功应用，却极易被对抗训练（AT）所防御。但对抗训练并非万能良方，其存在鲁棒性泛化能力不足的缺陷。针对攻击与防御的局限性，我们认为深度神经网络为更好地拟合数据，可能学习到输入与输出间的伪相关关系——这些伪关系被攻击与防御机制利用后反而会削弱其有效性，且深度神经网络难以像人类那样捕捉因果关系以在攻击下做出鲁棒决策。本文为深入理解并改进攻击与防御机制，首先采用自下而上的视角描述潜在因子与观测数据间的关联，进而分析攻击引发的域偏移对深度神经网络的影响，最终构建出域攻击不变因果模型（DICM）这一因果图。基于DICM，我们提出连贯的因果不变性原则指导算法设计，以推断类人因果关系的域攻击不变因果学习（DICE）算法。在两种攻击和一项防御任务上的实验结果验证了该算法的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=DICE:+Domain-attack+Invariant+Causal+Learning+for+Improved+Data+Privacy+Protection+and+Adversarial+Robustness)|0|
|[Balancing Bias and Variance for Active Weakly Supervised Learning](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539264)|Hitesh Sapkota, Qi Yu|Rochester Inst Technol, Rochester, NY 14623 USA|As a widely used weakly supervised learning scheme, modern multiple instance learning (MIL) models achieve competitive performance at the bag level. However, instance-level prediction, which is essential for many important applications, remains largely unsatisfactory. We propose to conduct novel active deep multiple instance learning that samples a small subset of informative instances for annotation, aiming to significantly boost the instance-level prediction. A variance regularized loss function is designed to properly balance the bias and variance of instance-level predictions, aiming to effectively accommodate the highly imbalanced instance distribution in MIL and other fundamental challenges. Instead of directly minimizing the variance regularized loss that is non-convex, we optimize a distributionally robust bag level likelihood as its convex surrogate. The robust bag likelihood provides a good approximation of the variance based MIL loss with a strong theoretical guarantee. It also automatically balances bias and variance, making it effective to identify the potentially positive instances to support active sampling. The robust bag likelihood can be naturally integrated with a deep architecture to support deep model training using mini-batches of positive-negative bag pairs. Finally, a novel P-F sampling function is developed that combines a probability vector and predicted instance scores, obtained by optimizing the robust bag likelihood. By leveraging the key MIL assumption, the sampling function can explore the most challenging bags and effectively detect their positive instances for annotation, which significantly improves the instance-level prediction. Experiments conducted over multiple real-world datasets clearly demonstrate the state-of-the-art instance-level prediction achieved by the proposed model.|作为一项广泛应用的弱监督学习方案，现代多示例学习（MIL）模型在包级别已实现优异性能。然而对于许多关键应用至关重要的实例级预测，其表现仍不尽如人意。我们提出一种新型主动深度多示例学习方法，通过采样少量信息丰富的实例进行标注，旨在显著提升实例级预测性能。本研究设计了一种方差正则化损失函数，通过合理平衡实例级预测的偏差与方差，有效应对MIL中高度不平衡的实例分布及其他基础性挑战。针对该非凸的方差正则化损失函数，我们通过优化分布鲁棒的包级别似然函数作为其凸替代目标。该鲁棒包似然函数在强理论保证下可有效近似基于方差的MIL损失，同时自动平衡偏差与方差，从而有效识别潜在正实例以支持主动采样。该鲁棒包似然可自然融入深度架构，支持使用正负包对的小批量数据进行深度模型训练。此外，通过结合概率向量与鲁棒包似然优化得到的实例预测分数，我们开发了新型P-F采样函数。该方法利用MIL的核心假设，能够探索最具挑战性的包并有效检测其中待标注的正实例，从而显著提升实例级预测精度。在多个真实数据集上的实验结果表明，所提出模型实现了当前最先进的实例级预测性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Balancing+Bias+and+Variance+for+Active+Weakly+Supervised+Learning)|0|
|[Learning Optimal Priors for Task-Invariant Representations in Variational Autoencoders](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539291)|Hiroshi Takahashi, Tomoharu Iwata, Atsutoshi Kumagai, Sekitoshi Kanai, Masanori Yamada, Yuki Yamanaka, Hisashi Kashima|Kyoto Univ, Kyoto, Japan; NTT, Nairobi, Kenya|The variational autoencoder (VAE) is a powerful latent variable model for unsupervised representation learning. However, it does not work well in case of insufficient data points. To improve the performance in such situations, the conditional VAE (CVAE) is widely used, which aims to share task-invariant knowledge with multiple tasks through the task-invariant latent variable. In the CVAE, the posterior of the latent variable given the data point and task is regularized by the task-invariant prior, which is modeled by the standard Gaussian distribution. Although this regularization encourages independence between the latent variable and task, the latent variable remains dependent on the task. To reduce this task-dependency, the previous work introduced an additional regularizer. However, its learned representation does not work well on the target tasks. In this study, we theoretically investigate why the CVAE cannot sufficiently reduce the task-dependency and show that the simple standard Gaussian prior is one of the causes. Based on this, we propose a theoretical optimal prior for reducing the task-dependency. In addition, we theoretically show that unlike the previous work, our learned representation works well on the target tasks. Experiments on various datasets show that our approach obtains better task-invariant representations, which improves the performances of various downstream applications such as density estimation and classification.|变分自编码器（VAE）是一种强大的潜在变量模型，可用于无监督表示学习。但在数据点不足的情况下，其性能表现不佳。为改善这一局限，条件变分自编码器（CVAE）被广泛采用，其通过任务无关潜在变量实现多任务间的知识共享。在CVAE框架中，基于数据点和任务给出的潜在变量后验分布会受到任务无关先验分布（以标准高斯分布建模）的正则化约束。尽管这种正则化促进了潜在变量与任务间的独立性，但潜在变量仍会保留对任务的依赖性。为降低这种任务依赖性，先前研究引入了额外的正则化项，但所学表征在目标任务上表现仍不理想。本研究从理论角度揭示了CVAE无法充分降低任务依赖性的原因，并证明简单的标准高斯先验是成因之一。基于此，我们提出了理论最优先验分布以降低任务依赖性。此外，我们通过理论证明：与先前工作不同，本方法所学表征在目标任务上表现优异。在多数据集上的实验表明，我们的方法能获得更优的任务无关表征，从而提升密度估计和分类等下游应用的性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Learning+Optimal+Priors+for+Task-Invariant+Representations+in+Variational+Autoencoders)|0|

Lauw|Singapore Management Univ, Singapore, Singapore|Classical recommendation methods typically render user representation as a single vector in latent space. Oftentimes, a user's interactions with items are influenced by several hidden factors. To better uncover these hidden factors, we seek disentangled representations. Existing disentanglement methods for recommendations are mainly concerned with user-item interactions alone. To further improve not only the effectiveness of recommendations but also the interpretability of the representations, we propose to learn a second set of disentangled user representations from textual content and to align the two sets of representations with one another. The purpose of this coupling is two-fold. For one benefit, we leverage textual content to resolve sparsity of user-item interactions, leading to higher recommendation accuracy. For another benefit, by regularizing factors learned from user-item interactions with factors learned from textual content, we map uninterpretable dimensions from user representation into words. An attention-based alignment is introduced to align and enrich hidden factors representations. A series of experiments conducted on four real-world datasets show the efficacy of our methods in improving recommendation quality.|传统推荐方法通常将用户表征呈现为潜在空间中的单一向量。由于用户与项目的交互行为往往受到多个潜在因素的影响，为了更好地揭示这些隐藏因素，我们寻求解耦式表征学习。现有推荐系统中的解耦方法主要仅关注用户-项目交互行为。为了进一步提升推荐效果并增强表征的可解释性，我们提出从文本内容中学习第二组解耦式用户表征，并将两组表征进行对齐。这种耦合设计具有双重优势：一方面，利用文本内容缓解用户-项目交互的稀疏性问题，从而提高推荐准确率；另一方面，通过将交互数据学习的因子与文本内容学习的因子进行正则化对齐，我们将用户表征中难以解释的维度映射到可理解的词汇空间。本文引入基于注意力机制的对齐方法来实现隐藏因子表征的对齐与增强。在四个真实数据集上进行的一系列实验证明了我们方法在提升推荐质量方面的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Aligning+Dual+Disentangled+User+Representations+from+Ratings+and+Textual+Content)|0|

However, the presence of unmeasured confounders increases the difficulty of estimating ICE in real-world scenarios. A wide range of methods have been proposed to address the unmeasured confounders with the aid of instrument variable (IV), which sources from the treatment randomization. The performance of these methods relies on the well-predefined IVs that satisfy the unconfounded instruments assumption (i.e., the IVs are independent with the unmeasured confounders given observed covariates), which is untestable and leads to finding a valid IV becomes an art rather than science. In this paper, we focus on estimating the ICE with confounded instruments that violate the unconfounded instruments assumption. By considering the conditional independence between the set of confounded instruments and the outcome variable, we propose a novel method, named CVAE-IV, to generate a substitute of the unmeasured confounder with a conditional variational autoencoder. Our theoretical analysis guarantees that the generated confounder substitute will identify unbiased ICE. Extensive experiments on bias demand prediction and Mendelian randomization analysis verify the effectiveness of our method.|学习个体化因果效应（ICE）在大数据分析的诸多领域具有至关重要的作用，从精细化政策评估到个性化治疗方案制定皆涵盖其中。然而在实际场景中，未测量混杂因子的存在增加了ICE估计的难度。现有研究多借助源自处理随机化的工具变量（IV）来解决未测量混杂因子问题，这些方法的性能依赖于满足"无混杂工具变量假设"（即给定观测协变量后IV与未测量混杂因子独立）的预定义IV。由于该假设不可检验，导致寻找有效IV的过程更像艺术而非科学。本文重点研究违反无混杂工具变量假设的混杂工具变量下的ICE估计问题。通过考虑混杂工具变量集与结果变量间的条件独立性，我们提出名为CVAE-IV的新方法，利用条件变分自编码器生成未测量混杂因子的替代变量。理论分析证明生成的混杂因子替代变量能够识别无偏ICE。在偏置需求预测和孟德尔随机化分析上的大量实验验证了本方法的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Estimating+Individualized+Causal+Effect+with+Confounded+Instruments)|0|

Traditional incremental learning methods will gradually forget old knowledge when learning new patterns, which is the catastrophic forgetting problem. Although saving and revisiting historical graph data alleviates the problem, the storage limitation in real-world applications reduces the amount of saved data, causing GNN to forget other knowledge. In this paper, we propose a streaming GNN based on generative replay, which can incrementally learn new patterns while maintaining existing knowledge without accessing historical data. Specifically, our model consists of the main model (GNN) and an auxiliary generative model. The generative model based on random walks with restart can learn and generate fake historical samples (i.e., nodes and their neighborhoods), which can be trained with real data to avoid the forgetting problem. Besides, we also design an incremental update algorithm for the generative model to maintain the graph distribution and for GNN to capture the current patterns. Our model is evaluated on different streaming data sets. The node classification results prove that our model can update the model efficiently and achieve comparable performance to model retraining.

However, most existing works are designed for the static setting, and can be hardly extended to the dynamic setting commonly seen in many real-world applications. In this paper, we focus on the more realistic open-set domain adaptation setting with a static source task and a time evolving target task where novel unknown target classes appear over time. Specifically, we show that the classification error of the new target task can be tightly bounded in terms of positive-unlabeled classification errors for historical tasks and open-set domain discrepancy across tasks. By empirically minimizing the upper bound of the target error, we propose a novel positive-unlabeled learning based algorithm named OuterAdapter for dynamic open-set domain adaptation with time evolving unknown classes.

To address these issues, we develop a new framework that provides appropriate modeling and adequate statistical analysis for nonstationary A/B tests. Without changing the infrastructure for any existing A/B test procedure, we propose a new estimator that views time as a continuous covariate to perform post stratification with a sample-dependent number of stratification levels. We prove central limit theorem in a natural limiting regime under nonstationarity, so that valid large-sample statistical inference is available. We show that the proposed estimator achieves the optimal asymptotic variance among all estimators.

These approaches are usually trained on graphs randomly generated with graph generators or sampled from existing datasets. However, we observe that such training graphs lead to poor testing performance if the testing graphs are not generated analogously, i.e., the generalibility of the models trained on those randomly generated training graphs are very limited. To address this critical issue, in this paper, we propose a new framework, named Learning with Iterative Graph Diversification (LIGD), and formulate a new research problem, named Diverse Graph Modification Problem (DGMP), that iteratively generate diversified training graphs and train the models that solve graph optimization problems to significantly improve their performance. We propose three approaches to solve DGMP by considering both the performance of the machine-learning approaches and the structural properties of the training graphs.

|[Learning Classifiers under Delayed Feedback with a Time Window Assumption](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539372)|Shota Yasui, Masahiro Kato||We consider training a binary classifier under delayed feedback (\emph{DF learning}). For example, in the conversion prediction in online ads, we initially receive negative samples that clicked the ads but did not buy an item; subsequently, some samples among them buy an item then change to positive. In the setting of DF learning, we observe samples over time, then learn a classifier at some point. We initially receive negative samples; subsequently, some samples among them change to positive. This problem is conceivable in various real-world applications such as online advertisements, where the user action takes place long after the first click. Owing to the delayed feedback, naive classification of the positive and negative samples returns a biased classifier. One solution is to use samples that have been observed for more than a certain time window assuming these samples are correctly labeled. However, existing studies reported that simply using a subset of all samples based on the time window assumption does not perform well, and that using all samples along with the time window assumption improves empirical performance. We extend these existing studies and propose a method with the unbiased and convex empirical risk that is constructed from all samples under the time window assumption. To demonstrate the soundness of the proposed method, we provide experimental results on a synthetic and open dataset that is the real traffic log datasets in online advertising.|我们研究在延迟反馈（\emph{DF学习}）场景下的二分类器训练问题。以在线广告转化预测为例：初始阶段我们获得的是点击广告但未购买商品的负样本；后续其中部分样本会产生购买行为并转为正样本。在DF学习框架中，我们随时间推移持续观测样本，并在特定时间点构建分类器。这种设置普遍存在于在线广告等现实应用场景中，用户行为往往在首次点击后很长时间才发生。

由于延迟反馈的存在，直接对正负样本进行分类会导致分类器产生偏差。现有解决方案之一是采用时间窗口假设，即仅使用观察时长超过特定阈值的样本（假定这些样本已被正确标记）。然而研究表明，单纯基于时间窗口假设使用样本子集效果有限，而结合时间窗口假设使用全量样本能提升模型性能。

Traditional model-based methods of sensor management are limited to specific systems/settings, which can be challenged when system knowledge is intractable. Fortunately, the large amount of data collected in real-time allows machine learning methods to be a complement. Especially, reinforcement learning-based control is recognized for its capability to dynamically interact with systems. However, the direct implementation of learning methods easily overfits and results in inaccurate physics modeling for sensor management. Although physical regularization is a popular direction to bridge the gap, learning-based sensor control still suffers from convergence failure under highly complex and uncertain scenarios. This paper develops physics-embedded and self-supervised reinforcement learning for sensor management using an intrinsic reward. Specifically, the intrinsic-motivated sensor management (IMSM) constructs the local surprise information from the physical latent features, which captures hidden states in observations, and thus intrinsically motivates the agent to speed-up exploration. We show that the designs can not only relieve the lack of consistency with underlying physics/physical dynamics, but also adapt the global objective of maximizing monitoring capabilities to local environment changes. We demonstrate its effectiveness by experiments on physical system sensor control. The proposed model is implemented for the sensor management of unmanned vehicles and sensor rescheduling in complex/settled power systems, with or without observability constraints. Numerical results show that our model provides consistently higher threat detection accuracy and better observability recovery, as compared to existing methods.|在现代复杂物理系统中，先进传感技术虽扩展了传感器覆盖范围，但也增加了基于实时数据提升系统监测能力的难度。传统基于模型的传感器管理方法受限于特定系统/场景，当系统知识难以获取时其有效性面临挑战。幸运的是，实时采集的海量数据为机器学习方法提供了补充途径，其中基于强化学习的控制方法因其动态系统交互能力备受关注。然而直接应用学习方法易导致过拟合，造成传感器管理中的物理建模失准。尽管物理正则化是弥合这一差距的热门方向，但在高度复杂和不确定场景下，基于学习的传感器控制仍存在收敛失败问题。本文提出一种嵌入物理机制且具有自监督特性的强化学习方法，通过内在奖励实现传感器管理。具体而言，内在激励传感器管理（IMSM）框架从物理潜在特征中构建局部惊奇信息，这些特征可捕捉观测中的隐藏状态，从而通过内在激励加速智能体的探索过程。我们证明该设计不仅能缓解与底层物理/物理动力学的一致性缺失问题，还能使最大化监测能力的全局目标适配局部环境变化。通过物理系统传感器控制实验验证了方法的有效性：将所提模型应用于无人驾驶车辆传感器管理及复杂/稳定电力系统中的传感器重调度任务，涵盖可观测性与不可观测性约束场景。数值结果表明，相较于现有方法，本模型持续提供更高的威胁检测精度和更优的可观测性恢复能力。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Intrinsic-Motivated+Sensor+Management:+Exploring+with+Physical+Surprise)|0|

In order to predict the unlabeled nodes from unseen classes, zero-shot node classification needs to transfer knowledge from seen classes to unseen classes. It is crucial to consider the relations between the classes in zero-shot node classification. However, the GCN only considers the relations between the nodes, not the relations between the classes. Therefore, the GCN can not handle the zero-shot node classification effectively. This paper proposes a Dual Bidirectional Graph Convolutional Networks (DBiGCN) that consists of dual BiGCNs from the perspective of the nodes and the classes, respectively. The BiGCN can integrate the relations between the nodes and between the classes simultaneously in an united network. In addition, to make the dual BiGCNs work collaboratively, a label consistency loss is introduced, which can achieve mutual guidance and mutual improvement between the dual BiGCNs. Finally, the experimental results on real-world graph data sets verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.|零样本节点分类对图卷积网络(GCN)等经典半监督节点分类算法构成重要挑战，尽管GCN已在节点分类领域获得广泛应用。为预测未知类别中的未标记节点，零样本节点分类需要实现从已知类别到未知类别的知识迁移。在此过程中，准确捕捉类别间关联至关重要。然而传统GCN仅考虑节点间关系而忽略类别间关联，导致其难以有效处理零样本节点分类任务。本文提出双双向图卷积网络(DBiGCN)，通过分别从节点视角和类别视角构建的双BiGCN结构，在统一网络中同步整合节点间与类别间关联。此外，通过引入标签一致性损失函数实现双BiGCN的协同工作机制，形成双向引导与共同优化的学习范式。最终在真实图数据集上的实验结果验证了所提方法的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Dual+Bidirectional+Graph+Convolutional+Networks+for+Zero-shot+Node+Classification)|0|

Recent research tries to solve this problem by deep learning methods. However, they are still unable to generalize well beyond training distributions. In this work, we propose to jointly leverage the strength of the physical and neural network models for crowd simulation by a Physics-Infused Machine Learning (PIML) framework. The key idea is to let the two models learn from each other by iteratively going through a physics-informed machine learning process and a machine-learning-aided physics discovery process. We present our realization of the framework with a novel neural network model, Physics-informed Crowd Simulator (PCS), and tailored interaction mechanisms enabling the two models to facilitate each other. Specifically, our designs enable the neural network model to identify generalizable signals from real-world data better and yield physically consistent simulations with the physical model's form and simulation results as a prior. Further, by performing symbolic regression on the well-trained neural network, we obtain improved physical models that better describe crowd dynamics. Extensive experiments on two publicly available large-scale real-world datasets show that, with the framework, we successfully obtain a neural network model with strong generalizability and a new physical model with valid physical meanings at the same time. Both models outperform existing state-of-the-art simulation methods in accuracy, fidelity, and generalizability, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the PIML framework for improving simulation performance and its capability for facilitating scientific discovery and deepening our understandings of crowd dynamics.

|[Few-shot Heterogeneous Graph Learning via Cross-domain Knowledge Transfer](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539431)|Qiannan Zhang, Xiaodong Wu, Qiang Yang, Chuxu Zhang, Xiangliang Zhang|Brandeis Univ, Waltham, MA 02254 USA; King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia; Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA|Graph few-shot learning seeks to alleviate the label scarcity problem resulting from the difficulties and high cost of data annotations in graph learning. However, the overwhelming solutions in graph few-shot learning focus on homogeneous graphs, ignoring the ubiquitous heterogeneous graphs (HGs), which represent real-world complex systems and domain knowledge with multi-typed nodes interconnected by multi-typed edges. To this end, we study the cross-domain few-shot learning problem over HGs and develop a novel model for Cross-domain Heterogeneous Graph Meta learning (CrossHG-Meta). The general idea is to promote the HG node classification in the data-scarce target domain by transferring meta-knowledge from a series of HGs in data-rich source domains. The key challenges are to 1) combat the heterogeneity in HGs to acquire the transferable meta-knowledge; 2) handle the domain shifts between the source HG and target HG; and 3) fast adapt to novel target tasks with few-shot annotated examples. Regarding the graph heterogeneity, CrossHG-Meta firstly builds a graph encoder to aggregate heterogeneous neighborhood information from multiple semantic contexts. Secondly, to tackle domain shifts, a cross-domain meta-learning strategy is proposed to include a domain critic, which is designed to explicitly lead cross-domain adaptation for meta-tasks in different domains and improve model generalizability. Last, to further alleviate data scarcity, CrossHG-Meta leverages unlabelled information in source domains with auxiliary self-supervised learning task to provide cross-domain contrastive regularization alongside the meta-optimization process to facilitate node embedding. Extensive experimental results on three multi-domain HG datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms various state-of-the-art baselines for multiple few-shot node classification tasks under the cross-domain setting.|图少样本学习旨在缓解图学习中因数据标注困难和高成本导致的标签稀缺问题。然而，现有图少样本学习方法大多聚焦于同构图，忽略了普遍存在的异构图（HGs）——这种由多类型节点通过多类型边相互连接构成的图结构能更真实地反映现实世界复杂系统和领域知识。为此，我们研究异构图的跨域少样本学习问题，并提出新型跨域异构图元学习模型CrossHG-Meta。该模型核心思想是通过从多个数据丰富的源域异构图中迁移元知识，提升数据稀缺目标域的异构图节点分类性能。研究面临三大关键挑战：1）克服异质性以获取可迁移的元知识；2）处理源域与目标域异构图间的域偏移；3）通过少量标注样本快速适应新目标任务。针对异质性挑战，CrossHG-Meta首先构建图编码器，从多语义上下文中聚合异构邻域信息；其次通过设计域批判器实现跨域元学习策略，显式引导不同域元任务的跨域适配并提升模型泛化能力；最后利用源域未标注信息，通过辅助自监督学习任务提供跨域对比正则化，在元优化过程中增强节点嵌入表示。在三个多域异构图数据集上的实验表明，该模型在跨域设置下的多种少样本节点分类任务中均优于现有先进基线方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Few-shot+Heterogeneous+Graph+Learning+via+Cross-domain+Knowledge+Transfer)|0|

Since the temporal boundaries and modalities annotations are not provided, only video-level event labels are available, this task is more challenging than conventional video understanding tasks.Most previous works attempt to analyze videos by jointly modeling the audio and video data and then learning information from the segment-level features with fixed lengths. However, such a design exist two defects: 1) The various semantic information hidden in temporal lengths is neglected, which may lead the models to learn incorrect information; 2) Due to the joint context modeling, the unique features of different modalities are not fully explored. In this paper, we propose a novel AVVP framework termedDual Hierarchical Hybrid Network (DHHN) to tackle the above two problems. Our DHHN method consists of three components: 1) A hierarchical context modeling network for extracting different semantics in multiple temporal lengths; 2) A modality-wise guiding network for learning unique information from different modalities; 3) A dual-stream framework generating audio and visual predictions separately. It maintains the best adaptions on different modalities, further boosting the video parsing performance. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our proposed method establishes the new state-of-the-art performance on the AVVP task.|弱监督音视频解析(AVVP)任务旨在将视频划分为时间片段，并根据模态预测事件类别，将其标记为可听、可见或两者兼具。由于未提供时间边界和模态标注，仅具备视频级事件标签，该任务比传统视频理解任务更具挑战性。现有方法大多通过联合建模音频与视频数据，从固定长度的片段级特征中学习信息，但此类设计存在两个缺陷：1）忽视了不同时间长度中隐含的多样化语义信息，可能导致模型学习错误信息；2）由于采用联合上下文建模，未能充分挖掘不同模态的独特特征。本文提出新型双层次混合网络(DHHN)框架以解决上述问题。该框架包含三个核心组件：1）分层上下文建模网络，用于提取多时间尺度的差异化语义；2）模态感知引导网络，用于学习不同模态的独特信息；3）双流预测框架，分别生成音频与视觉预测。该设计保持了对不同模态的最佳适应性，显著提升了视频解析性能。大量定量与定性实验表明，本方法在AVVP任务上取得了最先进的性能表现。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Adaptive+Learning+for+Weakly+Labeled+Streams)|0|
|[Adaptive Fairness-Aware Online Meta-Learning for Changing Environments](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539420)|Chen Zhao, Feng Mi, Xintao Wu, Kai Jiang, Latifur Khan, Feng Chen|Univ Texas Dallas, Richardson, TX 75083 USA; Univ Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA|The fairness-aware online learning framework has arisen as a powerful tool for the continual lifelong learning setting. The goal for the learner is to sequentially learn new tasks where they come one after another over time and the learner ensures the statistic parity of the new coming task across different protected sub-populations (e.g. race and gender). A major drawback of existing methods is that they make heavy use of the i.i.d assumption for data and hence provide static regret analysis for the framework. However, low static regret cannot imply a good performance in changing environments where tasks are sampled from heterogeneous distributions. To address the fairness-aware online learning problem in changing environments, in this paper, we first construct a novel regret metric FairSAR by adding long-term fairness constraints onto a strongly adapted loss regret. Furthermore, to determine a good model parameter at each round, we propose a novel adaptive fairness-aware online meta-learning algorithm, namely FairSAOML, which is able to adapt to changing environments in both bias control and model precision. The problem is formulated in the form of a bi-level convex-concave optimization with respect to the model's primal and dual parameters that are associated with the model's accuracy and fairness, respectively. The theoretic analysis provides sub-linear upper bounds for both loss regret and violation of cumulative fairness constraints. Our experimental evaluation on different real-world datasets with settings of changing environments suggests that the proposed FairSAOML significantly outperforms alternatives based on the best prior online learning approaches.|公平感知在线学习框架已成为持续终身学习场景中的强大工具。学习者的目标是按时间顺序依次学习不断出现的新任务，并确保新任务在不同受保护子群体（如种族和性别）间满足统计均等性。现有方法的主要缺陷在于严重依赖数据的独立同分布假设，因此仅能提供该框架的静态遗憾分析。然而在从异质分布中采样任务的变化环境中，低静态遗憾并不能保证良好的性能表现。为解决变化环境中的公平感知在线学习问题，本文首先通过在强适应损失遗憾中施加长期公平约束，构建了新型遗憾度量指标FairSAR。进而为在每轮迭代中确定最优模型参数，我们提出了一种新型自适应公平感知在线元学习算法FairSAOML，该算法能够在偏差控制和模型精度两方面适应变化环境。通过将模型参数分别关联精度与公平性的原对偶变量，该问题被构建为双层凸凹优化形式。理论分析表明，算法在损失遗憾和累计公平约束违反度上均具有次线性上界。在变化环境设置下对多个真实世界数据集的实验评估表明，所提出的FairSAOML算法显著优于基于现有最佳在线学习方法的对比方案。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Adaptive+Fairness-Aware+Online+Meta-Learning+for+Changing+Environments)|0|

Zwart, Xiaowei Jia|Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; US Geol Survey, Pittsburgh, PA USA|This paper proposes a graph-based meta learning approach to separately predict water quantity and quality variables for river segments in stream networks. Given the heterogeneous water dynamic patterns in large-scale basins, we introduce an additional meta-learning condition based on physical characteristics of stream segments, which allows learning different sets of initial parameters for different stream segments. Specifically, we develop a representation learning method that leverages physical simulations to embed the physical characteristics of each segment. The obtained embeddings are then used to cluster river segments and add the condition for the meta-learning process. We have tested the performance of the proposed method for predicting daily water temperature and streamflow for the Delaware River Basin (DRB) over a 14 year period. The results confirm the effectiveness of our method in predicting target variables even using sparse training samples. We also show that our method can achieve robust performance with different numbers of clusterings.|本文提出一种基于图的元学习方法，用于分别预测河网中各河段的水量和水质变量。针对大尺度流域中异质性的水动力模式，我们引入基于河段物理特征的附加元学习条件，使模型能够为不同河段学习不同的初始参数集。具体而言，我们开发了一种表征学习方法，通过物理模拟嵌入各河段的物理特征。所得嵌入向量用于对河段进行聚类，并为元学习过程添加条件约束。我们在特拉华河流域（DRB）开展了为期14年的日尺度水温与径流量预测实验，测试结果表明：即使在训练样本稀疏的情况下，该方法仍能有效预测目标变量。实验还证明，在不同聚类数量设置下，该方法均能保持稳健的预测性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Physics-Guided+Graph+Meta+Learning+for+Predicting+Water+Temperature+and+Streamflow+in+Stream+Networks)|0|

For end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks, the absence of human annotated labels along with the need for privacy preserving policies for model building makes it a daunting challenge. Motivated by these challenges, in this paper we use a cloud based framework for production systems to demonstrate insights from privacy preserving incremental learning for automatic speech recognition (ILASR). By privacy preserving, we mean, usage of ephemeral data which are not human annotated. This system is a step forward for production level ASR models for incremental/continual learning that offers near real-time test-bed for experimentation in the cloud for end-to-end ASR, while adhering to privacy-preserving policies. We show that the proposed system can improve the production models significantly ($3%$) over a new time period of six months even in the absence of human annotated labels with varying levels of weak supervision and large batch sizes in incremental learning. This improvement is $20%$ over test sets with new words and phrases in the new time period. We demonstrate the effectiveness of model building in a privacy-preserving incremental fashion for ASR while further exploring the utility of having an effective teacher model and use of large batch sizes.|增量学习是一种能够利用流式数据大规模构建和更新模型的范式。对于端到端自动语音识别（ASR）任务，由于缺乏人工标注标签且需遵循模型构建的隐私保护政策，这成为一项艰巨挑战。基于这些挑战，本文采用面向生产系统的云端框架，展示隐私保护型增量学习在自动语音识别（ILASR）中的应用价值。所谓隐私保护，是指使用未经人工标注的瞬时数据。该系统推动了生产级ASR模型在增量/持续学习领域的发展，为端到端ASR提供了近乎实时的云端实验测试平台，同时严格遵守隐私保护政策。实验表明，即使在没有人工标注标签的情况下，通过采用不同级别的弱监督和大批量增量学习策略，所提出的系统能在六个月内持续提升生产模型性能（提升幅度达3%）。对于包含新时段新词新短语的测试集，性能提升幅度高达20%。我们验证了隐私保护型增量学习在ASR模型构建中的有效性，并深入探讨了高效教师模型架构与大批量训练策略的实际效用。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=ILASR:+Privacy-Preserving+Incremental+Learning+for+Automatic+Speech+Recognition+at+Production+Scale)|0|

Because a future driver state can be accurately predicted from a request destination, it is possible to estimate the expected action value of assigning a ride request to an available driver as a Markov Decision Process using the Bellman Equation. These estimates are updated using temporal difference and are shown to adapt to changing marketplace conditions in real-time. While reinforcement learning has been studied for rideshare dispatch, fully-online approaches without offline priors or other guardrails had never been evaluated in the real world.

The world faces the rapid spread of infectious diseases such as SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), where a crucial goal is to predict potential future outbreaks and pandemics, as quickly as possible, using available data collected throughout the world. In this paper, we propose a new streaming algorithm, EPICAST, which is able to model, understand and forecast dynamical patterns in large co-evolving epidemiological data streams. Our proposed method is designed as a dynamic and flexible system, and is based on a unified non-linear differential equation. Our method has the following properties: (a) Effective: it operates on large co-evolving epidemiological data streams, and captures important world-wide trends, as well as location-specific patterns. It also performs real-time and long-term forecasting; (b) Adaptive: it incrementally monitors current dynamical patterns, and also identifies any abrupt changes in streams; (c) Scalable: our algorithm does not depend on data size, and thus is applicable to very large data streams. In extensive experiments on real datasets, we demonstrate that EPICAST outperforms the best existing state-of-the-art methods as regards accuracy and execution speed.|给定一个包含多地区每日病例/死亡/康复计数的大规模半无限共演化流行病学数据集合，我们如何实现增量式动态模式监测与未来行为预测？面对SARS-CoV-2（COVID-19）等传染病在全球的快速传播，核心目标在于利用全球收集的可用数据尽可能快速地预测潜在疫情爆发与流行趋势。本文提出新型流式算法EPICAST，能够对大规模共演化流行病学数据流中的动态模式进行建模、理解与预测。该方法采用动态灵活的系统设计，基于统一的非线性微分方程框架，具有以下特性：（a）高效性：可处理大规模共演化数据流，捕捉全球总体趋势与地区特异性模式，实现实时与长期预测；（b）自适应性：增量监测当前动态模式并识别数据流中的突变；（c）可扩展性：算法性能与数据规模无关，适用于超大规模数据流。在真实数据集上的大量实验表明，EPICAST在预测精度与执行效率方面均优于现有最先进方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Fast+Mining+and+Forecasting+of+Co-evolving+Epidemiological+Data+Streams)|0|
|[Design Domain Specific Neural Network via Symbolic Testing](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539118)|Hui Li, Xing Fu, Ruofan Wu, Jinyu Xu, Kai Xiao, Xiaofu Chang, Weiqiang Wang, Shuai Chen, Leilei Shi, Tao Xiong, Yuan Qi|Ant Grp, Hangzhou, Peoples R China|Deep sequence networks such as multi-head self-attention networks provide a promising way to extract effective representations from raw sequence data in an end-to-end fashion and have shown great success in various domains such as natural language processing, computer vision, $etc$. However, in domains such as financial risk management and anti-fraud where expert-derived features are heavily relied on, deep sequence models struggle to dominate the game.In this paper, we introduce a simple framework called symbolic testing to verify the learnability of certain expert-derived features over sequence data. A systematic investigation over simulated data reveals the fact that the self-attention architecture fails to learn some standard symbolic expressions like the count distinct operation. To overcome this deficiency, we propose a novel architecture named SHORING, which contains two components:event network andsequence network. Theevent network efficiently learns arbitrary high-orderevent-level conditional embeddings via a reparameterization trick while thesequence network integrates domain-specific aggregations into the sequence-level representation, thereby providing richer inductive biases compare to standard sequence architectures like self-attention. We conduct comprehensive experiments and ablation studies on synthetic datasets that mimic sequence data commonly seen in anti-fraud domain and three real-world datasets. The results show that SHORING learns commonly used symbolic features well, and experimentally outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin over real-world online transaction datasets. The symbolic testing framework and SHORING have been applied in anti-fraud model development at Alipay and improved performance of models for real-time fraud-detection.|多头自注意力网络等深度序列网络为从原始序列数据中端到端提取有效表征提供了可行路径，已在自然语言处理、计算机视觉等领域取得显著成功。然而在金融风险管理和反欺诈等高度依赖专家特征的领域，深度序列模型难以占据主导地位。本文提出名为符号化测试的简易框架，用于验证特定专家派生特征在序列数据上的可学习性。通过对模拟数据的系统性研究，我们发现自注意力架构无法学习计数去重等标准符号表达式。为克服这一缺陷，我们提出名为SHORING的新型架构，其包含事件网络与序列网络两大组件：事件网络通过重参数化技巧高效学习任意高阶事件级条件嵌入，而序列网络将领域特异性聚合运算融入序列级表征，相比自注意力等标准序列架构能提供更强的归纳偏置。我们在模拟反欺诈领域常见序列数据的合成数据集及三个真实数据集上进行了全面实验与消融研究。结果表明SHORING能有效学习常用符号特征，且在真实在线交易数据集上显著超越现有最优方法。该符号化测试框架与SHORING架构已应用于支付宝反欺诈模型开发，提升了实时欺诈检测模型的性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Design+Domain+Specific+Neural+Network+via+Symbolic+Testing)|0|
|[Arbitrary Distribution Modeling with Censorship in Real-Time Bidding Advertising](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539048)|Xu Li, Michelle Ma Zhang, Zhenya Wang, Youjun Tong|Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL USA; FreeWheel, Comcast Co, Beijing, Peoples R China|The purpose of Inventory Pricing is to bid the right prices to online ad opportunities, which is crucial for a Demand-Side Platform (DSP) to win advertising auctions in Real-Time Bidding (RTB). In the planning stage, advertisers need the forecast of probabilistic models to make bidding decisions. However, most of the previous works made strong assumptions on the distribution form of the winning price, which reduced their accuracy and weakened their ability to make generalizations. Though some works recently tried to fit the distribution directly, their complex structure lacked efficiency on online inference, which is critical for advertising systems. In this paper, we devise a novel loss function, Neighborhood Likelihood Loss (NLL), collaborating with a proposed framework, Arbitrary Distribution Modeling (ADM), to predict the winning price distribution under censorship with no pre-assumption required. We conducted experiments on two real-world experimental datasets and one large-scale, non-simulated production dataset in our system. Experiments showed that ADM outperformed the baselines both on algorithm and business metrics. This method has been released for one year and led to good yield in our system. Without any pre-assumed specific distribution form, ADM showed significant advantages in effectiveness and efficiency, demonstrating its great capability in modeling sophisticated price landscapes.|库存定价旨在为在线广告机会提供精准出价，这对需求方平台（DSP）在实时竞价（RTB）中赢得广告拍卖至关重要。在广告投放规划阶段，广告主需要概率模型的预测来制定竞价策略。然而现有研究大多对中标价格分布形式做了强假设，这既降低了预测准确性，也削弱了模型的泛化能力。尽管近期有研究尝试直接拟合价格分布，但其复杂结构难以满足广告系统对在线推断效率的严苛要求。本文设计了一种新型损失函数——邻域似然损失（NLL），结合提出的任意分布建模（ADM）框架，能够在无需预设分布形式的条件下预测截尾状态下的中标价格分布。我们在两个真实场景数据集和一个大规模非仿真生产数据集上进行实验，结果表明ADM在算法指标和商业指标上均超越基线模型。该方法已上线运行一年，为系统带来了显著收益。ADM无需预设特定分布形式，在效果和效率方面展现出显著优势，展现出对复杂价格场景的强大建模能力。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Arbitrary+Distribution+Modeling+with+Censorship+in+Real-Time+Bidding+Advertising)|0|
|[Para-Pred: Addressing Heterogeneity for City-Wide Indoor Status Estimation in On-Demand Delivery](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539167)|Wei Liu, Yi Ding, Shuai Wang, Yu Yang, Desheng Zhang|Rutgers State Univ, New Brunswick, NJ USA; Lehigh Univ, Bethlehem, PA USA; Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN USA; Southeast Univ, Dhaka, Bangladesh|On-demand delivery is a new form of logistics where customers place orders through online platforms and the platform arranges couriers to deliver them within a short time. The acquisition of indoor status (i.e., arrival or departure at the merchants) of couriers plays an important role in order dispatching and route planning. The Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) device is a promising solution for city-wide indoor status estimation due to the low hardware and deployment costs and low power consumption. However, the environment and smartphone model heterogeneities affect the status characteristics contained in the Bluetooth signal, resulting in the decline of status estimation performance. The previous methods to alleviate the heterogeneity are not suitable for city-wide scenarios with thousands of merchants and hundreds of smartphone models. In this paper, we propose Para-Pred, an indoor status estimation framework based on the graph neural network, which directly Predicts the effective indoor status estimation model Parameters for unseen scenarios. Our key idea is to utilize similarity between the influence patterns of heterogeneities on the Bluetooth signal to directly infer unseen scenarios' influence patterns. We evaluate the Para-Pred on 109,378 couriers with 672 smartphone models in 12,109 merchants from an on-demand delivery company. The evaluation results show that across environment and smartphone model heterogeneities, the accuracy and recall of our method achieve 93.62% and 95.20%, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions.|即时配送是一种新型物流形态，用户通过线上平台下单后，平台调度配送员在短时间内完成送达。精准获取配送员的室内状态（即到达或离开商户）对订单调度和路径规划至关重要。低功耗蓝牙设备因硬件与部署成本低、能耗少等优势，成为城市级室内状态监测的理想解决方案。但环境与智能手机型号的异构性会影响蓝牙信号中的状态特征，导致状态监测性能下降。现有消除异构性影响的方法难以适用于涵盖数千商户、数百种手机型号的城市级场景。本文提出基于图神经网络的室内状态监测框架Para-Pred，可直接为未知场景预测有效的室内状态监测模型参数。核心思路是利用异构性对蓝牙信号影响模式的相似性，直接推断未知场景的影响模式。我们通过某即时配送公司109,378名配送员、12,109家商户及672种手机型号的数据进行验证。测试结果表明：在环境与手机型号双重异构条件下，本方法的准确率和召回率分别达到93.62%与95.20%，优于现有最优解决方案。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Para-Pred:+Addressing+Heterogeneity+for+City-Wide+Indoor+Status+Estimation+in+On-Demand+Delivery)|0|
|[Uncovering the Heterogeneous Effects of Preference Diversity on User Activeness: A Dynamic Mixture Model](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539033)|Yunfei Lu, Peng Cui, Linyun Yu, Lei Li, Wenwu Zhu|Bytedance Inc, Beijing, Peoples R China; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA USA; Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China|Preference diversity arouses much research attention in recent years, as it is believed to be closely related to many profound problems such as user activeness in social media or recommendation systems. However, due to the lack of large-scale data with comprehensive user behavior log and accurate content labels, the real quantitative effect of preference diversity on user activeness is still largely unknown. This paper studies the heterogeneous effect of preference diversity on user activeness in social media. We examine large-scale real-world datasets collected from two of the most popular video-sharing social platforms in China, including the behavior logs of more than 787 thousand users and 1.95 million videos, with accurate content category information. We investigate the distribution and evolution of preference diversity, and find rich heterogeneity in the effect of preference diversity on the dynamic activeness. Furthermore, we discover the divergence of preference diversity mechanisms for the same user under different usage scenarios, such as active (where users actively seek information) and passive (where users passively receive information) modes. Unlike existing qualitative studies, we propose a universal mixture model with the capability of accurately fitting dynamic activeness curves while reflecting the heterogeneous patterns of preference diversity. To our best knowledge, this is the first quantitative model that incorporates the effect of preference diversity on user activeness. With the modeling parameters, we are able to make accurate churn and activeness predictions and provide decision support for increasing user activity through the intervention of diversity. Our findings and model comprehensively reveal the significance of preference diversity and provide potential implications for the design of future recommendation systems and social media.|近年来，偏好多样性引发广泛研究关注，因其被认为与社交媒体用户活跃度、推荐系统等深层问题密切相关。但由于缺乏具备完整用户行为日志和精准内容标签的大规模数据，偏好多样性对用户活跃度的真实量化影响仍不甚明晰。本研究通过分析来自中国两大头部视频社交平台的真实数据集（包含78.7万用户行为日志和195万条带精确分类标签的视频），系统探究偏好多样性对社交媒体用户活跃度的异质性影响。我们发现偏好多样性呈现特定分布规律与演化特征，且对动态活跃度的影响存在显著异质性。更值得注意的是，同一用户在主动（主动寻求信息）和被动（被动接收信息）两种使用场景下，偏好多样性机制呈现明显分化。与现有定性研究不同，我们提出一个通用混合模型，既能精准拟合动态活跃度曲线，又可反映偏好多样性的异质模式。据我们所知，这是首个量化偏好多样性对用户活跃度影响的模型。基于模型参数，我们能够精准预测用户流失与活跃度变化，并通过多样性干预为提升用户活跃度提供决策支持。本研究的发现与模型全面揭示了偏好多样性的重要性，为未来推荐系统与社交媒体设计提供了重要启示。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Uncovering+the+Heterogeneous+Effects+of+Preference+Diversity+on+User+Activeness:+A+Dynamic+Mixture+Model)|0|

|[Proactively Reducing the Hate Intensity of Online Posts via Hate Speech Normalization](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539161)|Sarah Masud, Manjot Bedi, Mohammad Aflah Khan, Md. Shad Akhtar, Tanmoy Chakraborty|IIIT Delhi, Delhi, India; Northeastern Univ, Boston, MA 02115 USA|Curbing online hate speech has become the need of the hour; however, a blanket ban on such activities is infeasible for several geopolitical and cultural reasons. To reduce the severity of the problem, in this paper, we introduce a novel task, hate speech normalization, that aims to weaken the intensity of hatred exhibited by an online post. The intention of hate speech normalization is not to support hate but instead to provide the users with a stepping stone towards non-hate while giving online platforms more time to monitor any improvement in the user's behavior. To this end, we manually curated a parallel corpus - hate texts and their normalized counterparts (a normalized text is less hateful and more benign). We introduce NACL, a simple yet efficient hate speech normalization model that operates in three stages - first, it measures the hate intensity of the original sample; second, it identifies the hate span(s) within it; and finally, it reduces hate intensity by paraphrasing the hate spans. We perform extensive experiments to measure the efficacy of NACL via three-way evaluation (intrinsic, extrinsic, and human-study). We observe that NACL outperforms six baselines - NACL yields a score of 0.1365 RMSE for the intensity prediction, 0.622 F1-score in the span identification, and 82.27 BLEU and 80.05 perplexity for the normalized text generation. We further show the generalizability of NACL across other platforms (Reddit, Facebook, Gab). An interactive prototype of NACL was put together for the user study. Further, the tool is being deployed in a real-world setting at Wipro AI as a part of its mission to tackle harmful content on online platforms.|遏制网络仇恨言论已成为当务之急，但出于地缘政治和文化等多重因素，全面禁止此类行为并不可行。为降低该问题的严重性，本文提出一项创新任务——仇恨言论规范化，旨在弱化网络帖子所表现的仇恨强度。仇恨言论规范化的目的并非支持仇恨，而是为用户提供向非仇恨言论过渡的垫脚石，同时为在线平台留出更多时间监测用户行为的改善情况。为此，我们手动构建了平行语料库（包含仇恨文本及其规范化版本，规范化文本仇恨程度更低、更具善意）。我们推出NACL模型，该简单高效的仇恨言论规范化模型分三阶段运作：首先测量原始样本的仇恨强度；其次识别其中的仇恨片段；最后通过复述重构仇恨片段以降低仇恨强度。我们通过三重评估（内在评估、外在评估和人工评估）进行大量实验以检验NACL效能。实验表明NACL在六个基线模型中表现最优——其强度预测的RMSE得分为0.1365，片段识别F1值为0.622，规范化文本生成BLEU分数达82.27且困惑度为80.05。我们进一步验证了NACL在其他平台（Reddit、Facebook、Gab）的泛化能力。为开展用户研究，我们搭建了NACL交互式原型。该工具目前正作为维布络人工智能公司解决在线平台有害内容使命的重要组成部分，被部署于实际应用场景中。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Proactively+Reducing+the+Hate+Intensity+of+Online+Posts+via+Hate+Speech+Normalization)|0|

In practice, it is vital to efficiently identify abnormal status of the working mechanical system, which can further facilitate the failure troubleshooting. In this paper, we propose a multi-pattern adversarial learning one-class classification framework, which allows us to use both the generator and the discriminator of an adversarial model for efficient ASD. The core idea is to learn reconstructing the normal patterns of acoustic data through two different patterns from auto-encoding generators, which succeeds in generalizing the fundamental role of a discriminator from identifying real and fake data to distinguishing between regional and local pattern reconstructions. Moreover, we design a novel balanceable detection strategy using both generators and a discriminator to achieve anomaly detection efficiently. Furthermore, we present a global filter layer for long-term interactions in the frequency domain space, which directly learns from the original data without introducing any human priors.

Souza, Glenn Eli Baker, Abdullah Mueen|Pontificia Univ Catolica Parana, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil; Air Force Res Lab, Albuquerque, NM USA; Univ New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA|The depth of a seismic event is an essential feature to discriminate natural earthquakes from events induced or created by humans. However, estimating the depth of a seismic event with a sparse set of seismic stations is a daunting task, and there is no globally usable method. This paper focuses on developing a machine learning model to accurately estimate the depth of arbitrary seismic events directly from seismograms. Our proposed deep learning architecture is not-so-deep compared to commonly found models in the literature for related tasks, consisting of two loosely connected levels of neural networks, associated with the seismic stations at the higher level and the individual channels of a station at the lower level. Thus, the model has significant advantages, including a reduced number of parameters for tuning and better interpretability to geophysicists. We evaluate our solution on seismic data collected from the SCEDC (Southern California Earthquake Data Center) catalog for regional events in California. The model can learn waveform features specific to a set of stations, while it struggles to generalize to completely novel sets of event sources and stations. In a simplified setting of separating shallow events from deep ones, the model achieved an 86.5% F1-score using the Southern California stations.|地震事件的深度是区分天然地震与人类诱发或制造事件的关键特征。然而，在台站稀疏的情况下估算震源深度是一项艰巨挑战，目前尚无全球通用的解决方案。本研究致力于开发一种机器学习模型，能够直接从地震波形数据中精确估算任意地震事件的深度。相比文献中常见相关任务的深度学习模型，我们提出的架构采用两个松散连接的神经网络层级——高层对应地震台站，底层对应单台站多通道数据，这种"非深度"设计具有显著优势：需调参数总量减少，且能为地球物理学家提供更好的可解释性。基于南加州地震数据中心（SCEDC）目录收集的区域地震数据评估表明，该模型能有效学习特定台站组合的波形特征，但在推广到全新震源-台站组合时表现受限。在以南加州台站数据分离浅源与深源事件的简化实验中，模型取得了86.5%的F1分数。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Septor:+Seismic+Depth+Estimation+Using+Hierarchical+Neural+Networks)|0|
|[Optimizing Long-Term Efficiency and Fairness in Ride-Hailing via Joint Order Dispatching and Driver Repositioning](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539060)|Jiahui Sun, Haiming Jin, Zhaoxing Yang, Lu Su, Xinbing Wang|Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA|The ride-hailing service offered by mobility-on-demand platforms, such as Uber and Didi Chuxing, has greatly facilitated people's traveling and commuting, and become increasingly popular in recent years. Efficiency (e.g., gross merchandise volume) has always been an important metric for such platforms. However, only focusing on the efficiency inevitably ignores the fairness of driver incomes, which could impair the sustainability of the overall ride-hailing system in the long run. To optimize the aforementioned two essential metrics, order dispatching and driver repositioning play an important role, as they impact not only the immediate, but also the future order-serving outcomes of drivers. Thus, in this paper, we aim to exploit joint order dispatching and driver repositioning to optimize both the long-term efficiency and fairness for ride-hailing platforms. To address this problem, we propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, referred to as JDRL, to help drivers make distributed order selection and repositioning decisions. Specifically, to cope with the variable action space, JDRL segments the action space into a fixed number of action groups, and fixes the policy output dimension for order selection as the number of action groups. In terms of the fairness criterion, JDRL adopts the max-min fairness, and augments the vanilla policy gradient to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between a minimization step and a policy improvement step to maximize both the worst and the overall performance of agents. In addition, we provide the theoretical convergence guarantee of our JDRL training algorithm even under non-convex policy networks and stochastic gradient updating. Extensive experiments are conducted with three public real-world ride-hailing order datasets, including over 2 million orders in Haikou, China, over 5 million orders in Chengdu, China, and over 6 million orders in New York City, USA. Experimental results show that JDRL demonstrates a consistent advantage compared to state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both efficiency and fairness. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that exploits joint order dispatching and driver repositioning to optimize both the long-term efficiency and fairness in a ride-hailing system.|网约车平台（如Uber、滴滴出行）提供的出行服务极大便利了人们的日常通勤与出行需求，近年来日益普及。效率指标（如总交易额）始终是此类平台的核心衡量标准，但单纯关注效率会忽视司机收入的公平性，长期而言可能损害整个网约车系统的可持续性。订单调度与司机重定位作为影响司机即时及未来接单效果的关键环节，对优化效率与公平性这两大核心指标具有重要作用。为此，本文通过联合订单调度与司机重定位，旨在实现网约车平台长期效率与公平性的协同优化。

针对该问题，我们提出名为JDRL的新型多智能体强化学习框架，以去中心化方式辅助司机进行订单选择与重定位决策。具体而言：为应对动态动作空间，JDRL将动作空间划分为固定数量的动作组，并将订单选择的策略输出维度固定为动作组数量；在公平性准则方面，采用最大最小公平原则，将原始策略梯度扩展为包含最小化步骤与策略改进步骤交替进行的迭代训练算法，以同步优化智能体的最差表现与整体表现。此外，即使在非凸策略网络和随机梯度更新的条件下，我们仍为JDRL训练算法提供了理论收敛性保证。

基于三个真实网约车订单数据集（包含中国海口超200万订单、中国成都超500万订单以及美国纽约超600万订单）开展的实验表明，JDRL在效率与公平性方面均显著优于现有先进基线方法。据我们所知，这是首项通过联合订单调度与司机重定位来协同优化网约车系统长期效率与公平性的研究工作。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Optimizing+Long-Term+Efficiency+and+Fairness+in+Ride-Hailing+via+Joint+Order+Dispatching+and+Driver+Repositioning)|0|
|[NENYA: Cascade Reinforcement Learning for Cost-Aware Failure Mitigation at Microsoft 365](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539127)|Lu Wang, Pu Zhao, Chao Du, Chuan Luo, Mengna Su, Fangkai Yang, Yudong Liu, Qingwei Lin, Min Wang, Yingnong Dang, Hongyu Zhang, Saravan Rajmohan, Dongmei Zhang|; Microsoft Azure, Seattle, WA USA; Microsoft 365, Suzhou, Peoples R China; Microsoft 365, Seattle, WA USA; Microsoft Res, Beijing, Peoples R China|Large-scale distributed systems, such as Microsoft 365's database system, require timely mitigation solutions to address failures and improve service availability and reliability. Still, mitigation actions can be costly as they may cause temporal performance degradation and even incur monetary expenses. Mitigation actions can be either administrated in a reactive fashion to contain detected failures or a proactive fashion to reduce potential failures. The proactive mitigation approach typically relies on a two-stage strategy: the prediction model will firstly identify instances (such as databases or disks) with high failure risk, then appropriate mitigation actions chosen by engineers or an automatic bandit learning model can be applied. As information is not fully shared across those two stages, important factors such as mitigation costs and states of instances are often ignored in one of those two stages. To address these issues, we propose NENYA, an end-to-end mitigation solution for a large-scale database system powered by a novel cascade reinforcement learning model. By taking the states of databases as input, NENYA directly outputs mitigation actions and is optimized based on jointly cumulative feedback on mitigation costs and failure rates. As the overwhelming majority of databases do not require mitigation actions, NENYA utilizes a novel cascade decision structure to firstly reliably filter out such databases and then focus on choosing appropriate mitigation actions for the rest. Extensive offline and online experiments have shown that our methods can outperform existing practices in reducing both failure rates of databases and mitigation costs. NENYA has been integrated into Microsoft 365, a productive platform, with sounding success.|大规模分布式系统（如Microsoft 365数据库系统）需要及时部署缓解方案以应对故障，从而提升服务可用性与可靠性。但缓解措施可能带来临时性能下降甚至产生经济成本，因此代价较高。缓解措施可分为两种模式：被动式——在检测到故障后实施管控；主动式——通过预先处置降低潜在故障风险。主动缓解通常采用两阶段策略：首先通过预测模型识别高故障风险的实例（如数据库或磁盘），随后由工程师或自动bandit学习模型选择缓解措施。由于两个阶段间信息未充分共享，缓解成本与实例状态等重要因素往往在某一阶段被忽略。

针对这些问题，我们提出NENYA——一种基于新型级联强化学习模型的大规模数据库系统端到端缓解方案。该系统以数据库状态作为输入，直接输出缓解措施，并根据缓解成本与故障率的联合累积反馈进行优化。鉴于绝大多数数据库无需实施缓解措施，NENYA采用创新级联决策结构：先可靠过滤无需处置的数据库，再专注于为剩余数据库选择合适的缓解措施。大量离线与在线实验表明，该方法在降低数据库故障率和缓解成本方面均优于现有方案。目前NENYA已成功集成至Microsoft 365生产平台，并取得显著成效。

Advertisers employ bidding strategies in RTB to optimize their advertising effects subject to various financial requirements, especially the return-on-investment (ROI) constraint. ROIs change non-monotonically during the sequential bidding process, and often induce a see-saw effect between constraint satisfaction and objective optimization. While some existing approaches show promising results in static or mildly changing ad markets, they fail to generalize to highly dynamic ad markets with ROI constraints, due to their inability to adaptively balance constraints and objectives amidst non-stationarity and partial observability. In this work, we specialize in ROI-Constrained Bidding in non-stationary markets. Based on a Partially Observable Constrained Markov Decision Process, our method exploits an indicator-augmented reward function free of extra trade-off parameters and develops a Curriculum-Guided Bayesian Reinforcement Learning (CBRL) framework to adaptively control the constraint-objective trade-off in non-stationary ad markets. Extensive experiments on a large-scale industrial dataset with two problem settings reveal that CBRL generalizes well in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data regimes, and enjoys superior learning efficiency and stability.|实时竞价（RTB）是现代在线广告系统中的重要机制。广告主通过RTB竞价策略在满足各类财务要求（尤其是投资回报率约束）的前提下优化广告效果。在连续竞价过程中，投资回报率呈现非单调变化特性，常常导致约束满足与目标优化之间产生跷跷板效应。现有方法虽然在静态或缓变广告市场中表现良好，但由于无法在非平稳性和部分可观测性环境下自适应平衡约束与目标，难以推广到具有ROI约束的高度动态广告市场。本研究专注于非平稳市场中的ROI约束竞价问题，基于部分可观测约束马尔可夫决策过程，提出无需额外权衡参数的指标增强奖励函数，并开发课程引导贝叶斯强化学习（CBRL）框架来自适应控制非平稳广告市场中的约束-目标权衡。基于大规模工业数据集在两种问题设置下的实验表明，CBRL在分布内和分布外数据机制中均具有良好的泛化能力，同时具备优异的学习效率和稳定性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=ROI-Constrained+Bidding+via+Curriculum-Guided+Bayesian+Reinforcement+Learning)|0|

However, accurately predicting product compatibility is difficult due to the heterogeneous product data and the lack of manually curated training data. We study the problem of discovering effective labeling rules that can enable weakly-supervised product compatibility prediction. We develop AMRule, a multi-view rule discovery framework that can (1) adaptively and iteratively discover novel rulers that can complement the current weakly-supervised model to improve compatibility prediction; (2) discover interpretable rules from both structured attribute tables and unstructured product descriptions. AMRule adaptively discovers labeling rules from large-error instances via a boosting-style strategy, the high-quality rules can remedy the current model's weak spots and refine the model iteratively. For rule discovery from structured product attributes, we generate composable high-order rules from decision trees; and for rule discovery from unstructured product descriptions, we generate prompt-based rules from a pre-trained language model. Experiments on 4 real-world datasets show that AMRule outperforms the baselines by 5.98% on average and improves rule quality and rule proposal efficiency.|在电子商务平台上，预测两个产品是否相互兼容是实现可信赖产品推荐和搜索体验的重要功能。然而，由于产品数据的异构性以及缺乏人工标注的训练数据，准确预测产品兼容性具有挑战性。本研究致力于发现有效的标注规则，以实现弱监督下的产品兼容性预测。我们提出了AMRule——一个多视角规则发现框架，该框架能够：（1）通过自适应迭代发现新型规则，补充现有弱监督模型以提升兼容性预测能力；（2）从结构化属性表和非结构化产品描述中发掘可解释规则。AMRule通过类 boosting 策略自适应地从高误差实例中发现标注规则，高质量规则可修正当前模型弱点并实现迭代优化。对于结构化产品属性，我们通过决策树生成可组合的高阶规则；对于非结构化产品描述，我们基于预训练语言模型生成提示式规则。在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，AMRule平均优于基线方法5.98%，同时提升了规则质量和规则提出效率。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Adaptive+Multi-view+Rule+Discovery+for+Weakly-Supervised+Compatible+Products+Prediction)|0|

Conventionally, ITE is predicted by modeling the treated and control response functions separately in their individual sample spaces. However, such an approach usually encounters two issues in practice, i.e. divergent distribution between treated and control groups due to treatment bias, and significant sample imbalance of their population sizes. This paper proposes Deep Entire Space Cross Networks (DESCN) to model treatment effects from an end-to-end perspective. DESCN captures the integrated information of the treatment propensity, the response, and the hidden treatment effect through a cross network in a multi-task learning manner. Our method jointly learns the treatment and response functions in the entire sample space to avoid treatment bias and employs an intermediate pseudo treatment effect prediction network to relieve sample imbalance. Extensive experiments are conducted on a synthetic dataset and a large-scaled production dataset from the E-commerce voucher distribution business. The results indicate that DESCN can successfully enhance the accuracy of ITE estimation and improve the uplift ranking performance. A sample of the production dataset and the source code are released to facilitate future research in the community, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first large-scale public biased treatment dataset for causal inference.|因果推断在电子商务与精准医疗等多个领域具有广泛应用，其性能高度依赖于个体处理效应(ITE)的准确估计。传统方法通过在各自样本空间中分别构建处理组和对照组的响应函数来预测ITE，但这种方法在实践中通常面临两个问题：因处理偏差导致的两组分布差异，以及样本群体规模显著不平衡。本文提出深度全空间交叉网络(DESCN)，从端到端视角对处理效应进行建模。该方法通过多任务学习框架下的交叉网络，同步捕获处理倾向、响应函数和隐藏处理效应的整合信息。DESCN在整个样本空间中联合学习处理函数与响应函数以避免处理偏差，并采用中间伪处理效应预测网络缓解样本不平衡问题。我们在合成数据集和来自电商优惠券分发业务的大规模生产数据集上进行了广泛实验。结果表明DESCN能有效提升ITE估计精度并改善 uplift 排序性能。我们开源了生产数据集样本和源代码以促进学界后续研究，据我们所知，这是首个面向因果推断的大规模公开偏差处理数据集。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=DESCN:+Deep+Entire+Space+Cross+Networks+for+Individual+Treatment+Effect+Estimation)|0|

It is an important optimization problem in modern logistic systems, since efficiently obtaining high-quality solutions can greatly reduce operation expenses as well as improve customer satisfaction. Most existing algorithms, including traditional non-learning heuristics and learning-based methods, only perform well on small-scale instances with usually no more than hundreds of customers. In this paper we present a novel Rewriting-by-Generating (RBG) framework which solves large-scale VRPs hierarchically. RBG consists of a rewriter agent that refines the customer division globally and an elementary generator to infer regional solutions locally. It is also flexible with multiple CVRP variant problems and could be continuously evolved with more up-to-date generator designs. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed RBG framework. It outperforms HGS, one of the best heuristic method for CVRPs and also shortens the inference time.

|[Scalable Online Disease Diagnosis via Multi-Model-Fused Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3542672)|Weijie He, Ting Chen|Tsinghua Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China|For those seeking healthcare advice online, AI based dialogue agents capable of interacting with patients to perform automatic disease diagnosis are a viable option. This application necessitates efficient inquiry of relevant disease symptoms in order to make accurate diagnosis recommendations. This can be formulated as a problem of sequential feature (symptom) selection and classification for which reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have been proposed as a natural solution. They perform well when the feature space is small, that is, the number of symptoms and diagnosable disease categories is limited, but they frequently fail in assignments with a large number of features. To address this challenge, we propose a Multi-Model-Fused Actor-Critic (MMF-AC) RL framework that consists of a generative actor network and a diagnostic critic network. The actor incorporates a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) to model the uncertainty induced by partial observations of features, thereby facilitating in making appropriate inquiries. In the critic network, a supervised diagnosis model for disease predictions is involved to precisely estimate the state-value function. Furthermore, inspired by the medical concept of differential diagnosis, we combine the generative and diagnosis models to create a novel reward shaping mechanism to address the sparse reward problem in large search spaces. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets for empirical evaluations. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of diagnostic accuracy and interaction efficiency while also being more effectively scalable to large search spaces.

Therefore, efficient vaccine allocation strategies are urgently called for, especially in large-scale metropolis where uneven health risk is manifested in nearby neighborhoods. However, there exist several key challenges in solving this problem: (1) great complexity in the large scale scenario adds to the difficulty in experts' vaccine allocation decision making; (2) heterogeneous information from all aspects in the metropolis' contact network makes information utilization difficult in decision making; (3) when utilizing the strong decision-making ability of reinforcement learning (RL) to solve the problem, poor explainability limits the credibility of the RL strategies.

We deal with the great complexity via a specially designed algorithm aggregating blocks in the metropolis into communities and we hierarchically integrate RL among the communities and experts solution within each community. We design a self-supervised contact network representation algorithm to fuse the heterogeneous information for efficient vaccine allocation decision making.

P., Ankit Agrawal|Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL USA; Tata Consultancy Serv, TCS Res, Pune, Maharashtra, India|Artificial intelligence and machine learning are being increasingly used in scientific domains such as computational fluid dynamics and chemistry. Particularly notable is a recently renewed interest in solving partial differential equations using machine learning models, especially deep neural networks, as partial differential equations arise in many scientific problems of interest. Within materials science literature, there has been a surge in publications on AI-enabled materials discovery, in the last five years. Despite this, the interaction between machine learning researchers and materials scientists (especially, scientists working on structural materials, their microstructures, textures and so on) has been very sparse. On the other hand, AI/ML techniques can clearly be integrated into materials design frameworks (e.g., MGI efforts) to support accelerated materials development, novel simulation methodologies and advanced data analytics. Hence there is an immediate need for exchange of ideas and collaborations between machine learning and materials science communities. We believe a workshop dedicated to this theme would be well- suited to foster such collaborations. The aim of this workshop is to bring together the computer science and materials science communities and foster deeper collaborations between the two to accelerate the adoption of AI/ML in materials science. We hope and envision this workshop to facilitate in building a community of researchers in this interdisciplinar area in the years ahead.||[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Machine+Learning+for+Materials+Science+(MLMS))|0|

This structure may be captured in the schema, in links between entities (e.g., graphs) or in rules describing the domain (e.g., knowledge graphs). Further, for richly structured prediction problems, there is often a need for a mix of both logical reasoning and statistical inference. In this talk, I will give an introduction to the field of Statistical Relational Learning (SRL), and I'll identify useful tips and tricks for exploiting structure in both the input and output space.

What are efficient algorithms? What are meaningful solutions? Big Data, Network Sciences, and Machine Learning have fundamentally challenged the basic characterizations in computing, from the conventional graph-theoretical modeling of networks to the traditional polynomial-time worst-case measures of efficiency: For a long time, graphs have been widely used for defining the structure of social and information networks. However, real-world network data and phenomena are much richer and more complex than what can be captured by nodes and edges. Network data is multifaceted, and thus network sciences require new theories, going beyond classic graph theory and graph-theoretical frameworks, to capture the multifaceted data. More than ever before, it is not just desirable, but essential, that efficient algorithms should be scalable. In other words, their complexity should be nearly linear or even sub-linear with respect to the problem size. Thus, scalability, not just polynomial-time computability, should be elevated as the central complexity notion for characterizing efficient computation.|什么是数据和网络模型？什么是高效算法？什么是有意义的解决方案？大数据、网络科学和机器学习从根本上挑战了计算的基本特征，从传统的网络图形理论建模到传统的多项式时间最坏情况的效率度量: 长期以来，图形被广泛用于定义社会和信息网络的结构。然而，真实世界的网络数据和现象比节点和边所能捕获的要丰富和复杂得多。网络数据是多方面的，因此网络科学需要超越经典图论和图论框架的新理论来捕获多方面的数据。与以往任何时候相比，有效的算法应该是可伸缩的，这不仅是可取的，而且是必要的。换句话说，相对于问题的大小，它们的复杂度应该接近线性，甚至是次线性。因此，可伸缩性，而不仅仅是多项式时间的可计算性，应该被提升为表征有效计算的核心复杂性概念。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Beyond+Traditional+Characterizations+in+the+Age+of+Data:+Big+Models,+Scalable+Algorithms,+and+Meaningful+Solutions)|0|

Variables are absent during inference because of long-term data loss (eg. sensor failures) or high -> low-resource domain shift between train / test. To the best of our knowledge, robustness of MTSF models in presence of such failures, has not been studied in the literature. Through extensive evaluation, we first show that the performance of state of the art methods degrade significantly in the VSF setting. We propose a non-parametric, wrapper technique that can be applied on top any existing forecast models. Through systematic experiments across 4 datasets and 5 forecast models, we show that our technique is able to recover close to 95% performance of the models even when only 15% of the original variables are present.|我们在多元时间序列预测（MTSF）领域提出了一项名为"变量子集预测（VSF）"的新推理任务，该任务要求在推理过程中仅能使用少量变量子集。变量在推理阶段缺失的原因包括长期数据丢失（如传感器故障）或训练/测试阶段存在高资源到低资源的域转移。据我们所知，现有文献尚未研究MTSF模型在此类故障情况下的鲁棒性。通过大量评估，我们首先发现当前最先进方法在VSF设置下的性能显著下降。我们提出了一种非参数化的封装技术，可应用于任何现有预测模型之上。通过对4个数据集和5种预测模型的系统实验表明，即使仅保留原始15%的变量，我们的技术仍能恢复模型接近95%的性能表现。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Multi-Variate+Time+Series+Forecasting+on+Variable+Subsets)|0|

Despite the existence of several provably exact algorithms for tree-metric fitting of data that inherently obeys tree-metric constraints, much less is known about how to best fit tree-metrics for data whose structure moderately (or substantially) differs from a tree. For such noisy data, most available algorithms perform poorly and often produce negative edge weights in representative trees. Furthermore, it is currently not known how to choose the most suitable approximation objective for noisy fitting. Our contributions are as follows. First, we propose a new approach to tree-metric denoising (HyperAid) in hyperbolic spaces which transforms the original data into data that is "more'' tree-like, when evaluated in terms of Gromov's δ hyperbolicity. Second, we perform an ablation study involving two choices for the approximation objective, l p norms and the Dasgupta loss. Third, we integrate HyperAid with schemes for enforcing nonnegative edge-weights. As a result, the HyperAid platform outperforms all other existing methods in the literature, including Neighbor Joining (NJ), TreeRep and T-REX, both on synthetic and real-world data. Synthetic data is represented by edge-augmented trees and shortest-distance metrics while the real-world datasets include Zoo, Iris, Glass, Segmentation and SpamBase; on these datasets, the average improvement with respect to NJ is $125.94%$.|树度量对距离的拟合问题在理论计算机科学和机器学习领域备受关注，这源于其在自然语言处理、系统发育学、癌症基因组学以及众多涉及层次聚类的应用场景中的重要作用。尽管对于本身符合树度量约束的数据，已有多种可证明精确的树度量拟合算法，但对于结构中度（或显著）偏离树状的数据，如何实现最优树度量拟合的研究仍十分有限。针对此类含噪声数据，现有算法大多表现不佳，且常在表征树中产生负边权重。此外，目前尚未确立如何为噪声拟合选择最合适的近似目标。我们的贡献如下：首先，提出双曲空间中的树度量去噪新方法（HyperAid），该方法依据Gromov δ双曲性度量，将原始数据转化为更具树状特性的数据；其次，通过消融实验对比两种近似目标（l p范数与Dasgupta损失函数）的性能表现；最后，将HyperAid与确保非负边权重的方案相结合。实验结果表明，无论是合成数据（边增强树与最短距离度量）还是真实数据集（Zoo、Iris、Glass、Segmentation和SpamBase），HyperAid平台的性能均优于现存所有方法（包括邻接归并算法、TreeRep和T-REX）。在真实数据集上，相较于邻接归并算法的平均性能提升达125.94%。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=HyperAid:+Denoising+in+Hyperbolic+Spaces+for+Tree-fitting+and+Hierarchical+Clustering)|0|

An unexplored area is that of algorithmic recourse for anomaly detection, specifically for tabular data with only discrete feature values. Here the problem is to present a set of counterfactuals that are deemed normal by the underlying anomaly detection model so that applications can utilize this information for explanation purposes or to recommend countermeasures. We present an approach-Context preserving Algorithmic Recourse for Anomalies in Tabular data(CARAT), that is effective, scalable, and agnostic to the underlying anomaly detection model. CARAT uses a transformer based encoder-decoder model to explain an anomaly by finding features with low likelihood. Subsequently semantically coherent counterfactuals are generated by modifying the highlighted features, using the overall context of features in the anomalous instance(s).

Dickerson, Brian Brubach|Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; Wellesley Coll, Wellesley, MA 02181 USA|The widespread use of machine learning algorithms in settings that directly affect human lives has instigated significant interest in designing variants of these algorithms that are provably fair. Recent work in this direction has produced numerous algorithms for the fundamental problem of clustering under many different notions of fairness. Perhaps the most common family of notions currently studied is group fairness, in which proportional group representation is ensured in every cluster. We extend this direction by considering the downstream application of clustering and how group fairness should be ensured for such a setting. Specifically, we consider a common setting in which a decision-maker runs a clustering algorithm, inspects the center of each cluster, and decides an appropriate outcome (label) for its corresponding cluster. In hiring for example, there could be two outcomes, positive (hire) or negative (reject), and each cluster would be assigned one of these two outcomes. To ensure group fairness in such a setting, we would desire proportional group representation in every label but not necessarily in every cluster as is done in group fair clustering. We provide algorithms for such problems and show that in contrast to their NP-hard counterparts in group fair clustering, they permit efficient solutions. We also consider a well-motivated alternative setting where the decision-maker is free to assign labels to the clusters regardless of the centers' positions in the metric space. We show that this setting exhibits interesting transitions from computationally hard to easy according to additional constraints on the problem. Moreover, when the constraint parameters take on natural values we show a randomized algorithm for this setting that always achieves an optimal clustering and satisfies the fairness constraints in expectation. Finally, we run experiments on real world datasets that validate the effectiveness of our algorithms.|机器学习算法在直接影响人类生活的场景中广泛应用，引发了人们对设计可证明公平算法变体的高度关注。近期该方向的研究已针对聚类这一基础性问题提出了多种算法，涵盖不同公平性概念。当前研究最普遍的公平性概念族是群体公平性——要求每个聚类中都保持群体比例代表性。我们通过考量聚类的下游应用及如何确保该场景中的群体公平性，拓展了这一研究方向。具体而言，我们研究一个常见场景：决策者运行聚类算法后检查每个聚类的中心点，并为其对应聚类决定适当的结果（标签）。以招聘为例，可能存在积极（聘用）和消极（拒绝）两种结果，每个聚类将被分配其中一种结果。为确保此类场景的群体公平性，我们需要在每个结果标签中实现群体比例代表性，而非像群体公平聚类那样要求每个聚类内部都满足该条件。我们为此类问题提供了算法，并证明与群体公平聚类中NP难问题不同，这些算法存在高效解。我们还研究了另一种具有现实意义的场景：允许决策者自由分配聚类标签，而不受中心点在度量空间中位置的限制。研究表明，根据问题附加约束条件的不同，该场景会呈现从计算困难到简单的有趣转变。特别当约束参数取自然值时，我们提出了随机算法，该算法始终能获得最优聚类，并在期望值上满足公平性约束。最后通过在真实数据集上的实验，验证了我们算法的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Fair+Labeled+Clustering)|0|
|[On Aligning Tuples for Regression](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539373)|Chenguang Fang, Shaoxu Song, Yinan Mei, Ye Yuan, Jianmin Wang|Tsinghua Univ, BNRist, Beijing, Peoples R China; Beijing Inst Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China|Regression models are learned over multiple variables, e.g., using engine torque and speed to predict its fuel consumption. In practice, the values of these variables are often collected separately, e.g., by different sensors in a vehicle, and need to be aligned first in a tuple before learning. Unfortunately, flowing to various issues like network delays, values generated at the same time could be recorded with different timestamps, making the alignment diffcult. According to our study in a vehicle manufacturer, engine torque, speed and fuel consumption values are mostly not recorded with the same timestamps. Aligning tuples by simply concatenating values of variables with equal timestamps leads to limited data for learning regression model. To deal with timestamp variations, existing time series matching techniques rely on the similarity of values and timestamps, which unfortunately are very likely to be absent among the variables in regression (no similarity between engine torque and speed values). In this sense, we propose to bridge tuple alignment and regression. Rather than similar values and timestamps, we align the values of different variables in a tuple that (i) are recorded in a short period, i.e., time constraint, and more importantly (ii) coincide well with the regression model, known as model constraint. Our theoretical and technical contributions include (1) formulating the problem of tuple alignment with time and model constraints, (2) proving NP-completeness of the problem, (3) devising an approximation algorithm with performance guarantee, and (4) proposing efficient pruning strategies for the algorithm. Experiments over real world datasets, including the aforesaid engine data collected by a vehicle manufacturer, demonstrate that our proposal outperforms the existing methods on alignment accuracy and improves regression precision.|回归模型通常基于多个变量进行学习，例如利用发动机扭矩和转速来预测燃油消耗量。在实际应用中，这些变量的数值往往通过不同渠道独立采集（如通过车辆内多个传感器），需先将其对齐为元组再进行模型学习。但由于网络延迟等问题，同一时刻产生的数值可能被标记不同时间戳，导致对齐困难。根据我们对某汽车制造商的研究发现，发动机扭矩、转速与燃油消耗值大多存在时间戳不一致的问题。若仅简单拼接相同时间戳的变量值进行元组对齐，将导致可用于回归模型训练的数据量严重受限。针对时间戳差异问题，现有时间序列匹配技术依赖于数值和时间戳的相似性，而回归任务中的变量间往往缺乏这种相似性（如发动机扭矩与转速数值不存在可比性）。为此，我们提出将元组对齐与回归建模进行联合优化：不仅要求不同变量的数值在较短时间内被记录（时间约束），更重要的是要求对齐后的元组与回归模型高度契合（模型约束）。我们的理论与技术贡献包括：（1）构建具有时间和模型双约束的元组对齐问题框架；（2）证明该问题的NP完全性；（3）设计具有性能保障的近似算法；（4）提出高效剪枝策略。在真实数据集（包括汽车制造商采集的发动机数据）上的实验表明，本方案在对齐精度和回归准确率方面均优于现有方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=On+Aligning+Tuples+for+Regression)|0|

Rather than the traditional axis-aligned trees, we use sparse oblique trees, which have far more modelling power, particularly with high-dimensional data, while remaining interpretable.

In this paper, to achieve rapid learning with less computational cost, we explore LTH in the context of meta learning. First, we experimentally show that there are sparse sub-networks, known as meta winning tickets, which can be meta-trained to few-shot classification accuracy to the original backbone. The application of LTH in meta learning enables the adaptation of meta-trained networks on various IoT devices with fewer computation. However, the status quo to identify winning tickets requires iterative training and pruning, which is particularly expensive for finding meta winning tickets. To this end, then we investigate the inter- and intra-layer patterns among different meta winning tickets, and propose a scheme for early detection of a meta winning ticket. The proposed scheme enables efficient training in resource-limited devices. Besides, it also designs a lightweight solution to search the meta winning ticket. Evaluations on standard few-shot classification benchmarks show that we can find competitive meta winning tickets with 20% weights of the original backbone, while incurring only 8%-14% (Conv-4) and 19%-29% (ResNet-12) computation overhead (measured by FLOPs) of the standard winning ticket finding scheme.|彩票假说(LTH)指出随机初始化的密集网络中存在子网络，这些子网络经独立训练后可达到原密集网络的性能。本文为降低计算成本实现快速学习，探索了元学习背景下的彩票假说。首先通过实验证明：存在被称为"元中奖彩票"的稀疏子网络，经元训练后可在小样本分类任务中达到原始主干网络的精度。该机制使元训练网络能以更少计算量适配各种物联网设备。但现有识别中奖彩票的方法需迭代训练与剪枝，寻找元中奖彩票的成本尤为高昂。为此，我们深入研究不同元中奖彩票的层间与层内模式，提出元中奖彩票的早期检测方案。该方案可实现资源受限设备的高效训练，并设计轻量级解决方案来搜索元中奖彩票。小样本分类基准测试表明：我们仅需原始主干网络20%的权重即可找到具有竞争力的元中奖彩票，同时计算开销（以FLOPs衡量）仅相当于标准中奖彩票发现方案的8%-14%（Conv-4）和19%-29%（ResNet-12）。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Finding+Meta+Winning+Ticket+to+Train+Your+MAML)|0|

Smola|Rice Univ, Houston, TX 77251 USA; ThirdAI Corp, Houston, TX USA; Amazon Web Serv, Palo Alto, CA USA|Representation learning has transformed the problem of information retrieval into one of finding the approximate set of nearest neighbors in a high dimensional vector space. With limited hardware resources and time-critical queries, the retrieval engines face an inherent tension between latency, accuracy, scalability, compactness, and the ability to load balance in distributed settings. To improve the trade-off, we propose a new algorithm, called BaLanced Index for Scalable Search (BLISS), a highly tunable indexing algorithm with enviably small index sizes, making it easy to scale to billions of vectors. It iteratively refines partitions of items by learning the relevant buckets directly from the query-item relevance data. To ensure that the buckets are balanced, BLISS uses the power-of-K choices strategy. We show that BLISS provides superior load balancing with high probability (and under very benign assumptions). Due to its design, BLISS can be employed for both near-neighbor retrieval (ANN problem) and extreme classification (XML problem). For the case of ANN, we train and index 4 datasets with billion vectors each. We compare the recall, inference time, indexing time, and index size for BLISS with the two most popular and well-optimized libraries- Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graph and Facebook's FAISS. BLISS requires 100x lesser RAM than HNSW, making it fit in memory on commodity machines while taking a similar inference time as HNSW for the same recall. Against FAISS-IVF, BLISS achieves similar performance with 3-4x less memory requirement. BLISS is both data and model parallel, making it ideal for distributed implementation for training and inference. For the case of XML, BLISS surpasses the best baselines' precision while being 5x faster for inference on popular multi-label datasets with half a million classes.|表示学习将信息检索问题转化为高维向量空间中近似最近邻的搜索任务。面对有限硬件资源与时效性查询需求，检索系统始终在延迟、精度、可扩展性、索引紧凑度以及分布式环境下的负载均衡能力之间存在固有矛盾。为优化这一权衡关系，我们提出名为可扩展搜索均衡索引（BLISS）的新型算法——这是一种具备高度可调性的索引算法，其索引体积显著优于同类方案，可轻松扩展至十亿级向量规模。该算法通过从查询-项目关联数据中直接学习相关分桶策略，迭代优化项目划分机制。为确保分桶均衡性，BLISS采用K选择幂次策略。我们证明在温和假设条件下，BLISS能以高概率实现卓越的负载均衡。基于其设计特性，该算法可同时应用于近邻检索（ANN问题）与极端分类（XML问题）。针对ANN场景，我们对四个十亿级向量数据集进行训练与索引，并将BLISS与当前两大优化程度最高的库——分层可导航小世界图（HNSW）和Facebook的FAISS——在召回率、推理时间、索引构建时间和索引体积方面进行对比。BLISS所需内存比HNSW减少100倍，可在商用机器内存中运行，且在相同召回率下推理时间与HNSW相当；相较于FAISS-IVF，BLISS以减少3-4倍的内存需求实现相近性能。该算法支持数据并行与模型并行，非常适合分布式训练与推理部署。在XML场景中，BLISS在包含50万个类别的热门多标签数据集上推理速度提升5倍的同时，其精度超越了最佳基线模型。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=BLISS:+A+Billion+scale+Index+using+Iterative+Re-partitioning)|0|

Existing methods typically focus on identifying anomalous edges or finding anomaly graph snapshots in a stream way. However, edge-oriented methods cannot quantify how individual nodes change over time while others need to maintain representations of the whole graph all the time, thus computationally inefficient. This paper proposes DynAnom, an efficient framework to quantify the changes and localize per-node anomalies over large dynamic weighted-graphs. Thanks to recent advances in dynamic representation learning based on Personalized PageRank, DynAnom is 1) efficient: the time complexity is linear to the number of edge events and independent of node size of the input graph; 2) effective: DynAnom can successfully track topological changes reflecting real-world anomaly; 3) flexible: different type of anomaly score functions can be defined for various applications. Experiments demonstrate these properties on both benchmark graph datasets and a new large real-world dynamic graph. Specifically, an instantiation method based on DynAnom achieves the accuracy of 0.5425 compared with 0.2790, the best baseline, on the task of node-level anomaly localization while running 2.3 times faster than the baseline. We present a real-world case study and further demonstrate the usability of DynAnom for anomaly discovery over large-scale graphs.|在动态演化的图中追踪特定节点子集对于众多现实应用具有重要意义。现有方法通常侧重于以流式方式识别异常边或发现异常图快照。然而，面向边的方法无法量化单个节点随时间的变化情况，而其他方法需要持续维护全图表示，导致计算效率低下。本文提出DynAnom框架，可高效量化大型动态加权图中节点的变化并定位节点级异常。基于个性化PageRank动态表征学习的最新进展，DynAnom具有三大优势：1）高效性：时间复杂度与边事件数量呈线性关系，且独立于输入图的节点规模；2）有效性：能成功追踪反映真实异常现象的拓扑变化；3）灵活性：可为不同应用场景定义多种类型的异常评分函数。在基准图数据集和新型大规模真实动态图上的实验验证了这些特性。具体而言，基于DynAnom的实例方法在节点级异常定位任务中达到0.5425的准确率（最佳基线方法为0.2790），且运行速度比基线快2.3倍。通过真实案例研究，进一步证明了DynAnom在大规模图异常发现方面的实用性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Subset+Node+Anomaly+Tracking+over+Large+Dynamic+Graphs)|0|

Among them, the pairwise Origin-Destination (OD) demand prediction is a valuable but challenging problem due to several factors: (i) the large number of possible OD pairs, (ii) implicitness of spatial dependence, and (iii) complexity of traffic states. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a Continuous-time and Multi-level dynamic graph representation learning method for Origin-Destination demand prediction (CMOD). Firstly, a continuous-time dynamic graph representation learning framework is constructed, which maintains a dynamic state vector for each traffic node (metro stations or taxi zones). The state vectors keep historical transaction information and are continuously updated according to the most recently happened transactions. Secondly, a multi-level structure learning module is proposed to model the spatial dependency of station-level nodes. It can not only exploit relations between nodes adaptively from data, but also share messages and representations via cluster-level and area-level virtual nodes. Lastly, a cross-level fusion module is designed to integrate multi-level memories and generate comprehensive node representations for the final prediction. Extensive experiments are conducted on two real-world datasets from Beijing Subway and New York Taxi, and the results demonstrate the superiority of our model against the state-of-the-art approaches.|基于深度神经网络的交通需求预测在学术界和工业界引发了广泛关注。其中，起讫点（OD）需求预测是一个极具价值但充满挑战的课题，主要存在三大难点：（i）OD对数量庞大；（ii）空间依赖关系具有隐含性；（iii）交通状态复杂度高。针对这些问题，本文提出了一种用于起讫点需求预测的连续时间多层级动态图表示学习方法（CMOD）。首先构建连续时间动态图表示学习框架，为每个交通节点（地铁站点或出租车区域）维护动态状态向量，这些向量持续记录历史交易信息并根据最新发生的交易实时更新。其次提出多层级结构学习模块，用于建模站点级节点的空间依赖性：该模块不仅能从数据中自适应地挖掘节点间关系，还能通过集群级和区域级虚拟节点实现信息共享与表征传递。最后设计跨层级融合模块，整合多层级记忆信息并生成综合节点表征以完成最终预测。在北京地铁和纽约出租车两个真实数据集上的大量实验表明，本模型优于现有最先进方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Continuous-Time+and+Multi-Level+Graph+Representation+Learning+for+Origin-Destination+Demand+Prediction)|0|

The problem is important in broad applications such as streamline classification on Earth imagery or tissue segmentation on medical imagery, whereby annotating precise vector labels is expensive and time-consuming. However, the problem is challenging due to the gap between the vector representation of class labels and the raster representation of image features and the need for training neural networks with uncertain label locations. Existing research on uncertain training labels often focuses on uncertainty in label class semantics or characterizes label registration uncertainty at the pixel level (not contiguous vectors). To fill the gap, this paper proposes a novel learning framework that explicitly quantifies vector labels' registration uncertainty. We propose a registration-uncertainty-aware loss function and design an iterative uncertainty reduction algorithm by re-estimating the posterior of true vector label locations distribution based on a Gaussian process. Evaluations on real-world datasets in National Hydrography Dataset refinement show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms several baselines in the registration uncertainty estimations performance and classification performance.|给定栅格影像特征及存在配准不确定性的不完美矢量训练标签，本文研究了一种能够量化并降低训练标签配准不确定性、同时训练神经网络参数的深度学习框架。该问题在地球影像中的河流分类或医学影像中的组织分割等广泛应用中具有重要意义，因为精确标注矢量标签既昂贵又耗时。然而，由于类别标签的矢量表示与图像特征的栅格表示之间存在差异，且需要在标签位置不确定的情况下训练神经网络，该问题具有挑战性。现有关于不确定训练标签的研究通常关注标签类别语义的不确定性，或在像素级别（非连续矢量）表征标签配准不确定性。为填补这一空白，本文提出了一种新型学习框架，可显式量化矢量标签的配准不确定性。我们提出了一种配准不确定性感知的损失函数，并基于高斯过程重新估计真实矢量标签位置分布的后验概率，设计了一种迭代式不确定性降低算法。在美国国家水文数据集精化任务中的真实数据集评估表明，所提出方法在配准不确定性估计性能和分类性能上均显著优于多个基线模型。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Quantifying+and+Reducing+Registration+Uncertainty+of+Spatial+Vector+Labels+on+Earth+Imagery)|0|
|[AdaAX: Explaining Recurrent Neural Networks by Learning Automata with Adaptive States](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539356)|Dat Hong, Alberto Maria Segre, Tong Wang|Univ Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA|Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are widely used for handling sequence data. However, their black-box nature makes it difficult for users to interpret the decision-making process. We propose a new method to construct deterministic finite automata to explain RNN. In an automaton, states are abstracted from hidden states produced by the RNN, and the transitions represent input symbols. Thus, users can follow the paths of transitions, called patterns, to understand how a prediction is produced. Existing methods for extracting automata partition the hidden state space at the beginning of the extraction, which often leads to solutions that are either inaccurate or too large in size to comprehend. Unlike previous methods, our approach allows the automata states to be formed adaptively during the extraction. Instead of defining patterns on pre-determined clusters, our proposed model, AdaAX, identifies small sets of hidden states determined by patterns with finer granularity in data. Then these small sets are gradually merged to form states, allowing users to trade fidelity for lower complexity. Experiments show that our automata can achieve higher fidelity while being significantly smaller in size than baseline methods on synthetic and complex real datasets.|循环神经网络（RNN）被广泛用于处理序列数据，但其黑盒特性导致用户难以理解其决策过程。我们提出一种构建确定性有限自动机来解释RNN的新方法。在该自动机中，状态从RNN产生的隐藏状态中抽象得出，转移则代表输入符号。用户可通过追踪转移路径（称为模式）来理解预测结果的生成机制。现有自动机提取方法在初始阶段就对隐藏状态空间进行划分，这往往导致生成的自动机要么精度不足，要么规模过大难以理解。与先前方法不同，我们的方法允许在提取过程中自适应地形成自动机状态。我们提出的AdaAX模型并非基于预设聚类定义模式，而是通过数据中更细粒度的模式识别来确定小型隐藏状态集合，随后逐步合并这些集合以形成状态，使用户能够在保真度和复杂度之间进行权衡。实验表明，在合成数据集和复杂真实数据集上，我们的自动机在实现更高保真度的同时，其规模显著小于基线方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=AdaAX:+Explaining+Recurrent+Neural+Networks+by+Learning+Automata+with+Adaptive+States)|0|

Despite their success, popular toolkits for learning tree ensembles have limited modeling capabilities. For instance, these toolkits support a limited number of loss functions and are restricted to single task learning. We propose a flexible framework for learning tree ensembles, which goes beyond existing toolkits to support arbitrary loss functions, missing responses, and multi-task learning. Our framework builds on differentiable (a.k.a. soft) tree ensembles, which can be trained using first-order methods. However, unlike classical trees, differentiable trees are difficult to scale. We therefore propose a novel tensor-based formulation of differentiable trees that allows for efficient vectorization on GPUs. We introduce FASTEL: a new toolkit (based on Tensorflow 2) for learning differentiable tree ensembles. We perform experiments on a collection of 28 real open-source and proprietary datasets, which demonstrate that our framework can lead to 100x more compact and 23% more expressive tree ensembles than those obtained by popular toolkits.|决策树集成是被广泛使用且具有竞争力的学习模型。尽管取得了成功，但主流树集成学习工具包存在建模能力局限。例如，这些工具包仅支持有限数量的损失函数，且局限于单任务学习场景。我们提出了一种灵活的树集成学习框架，突破现有工具包的限制，支持任意损失函数、缺失响应和多任务学习。该框架基于可微分（又称软）树集成构建，可通过一阶方法进行训练。然而与传统树模型不同，可微分树的扩展性存在挑战。为此，我们提出了一种基于张量的可微分树新 formulation，支持在GPU上实现高效向量化运算。我们推出FASTEL：基于TensorFlow 2的新工具包，用于学习可微分树集成。通过对28个开源和专有真实数据集的实验证明，我们的框架相比主流工具包能获得紧凑度提升100倍、表达能力增强23%的树集成模型。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Flexible+Modeling+and+Multitask+Learning+using+Differentiable+Tree+Ensembles)|0|
|[Selective Cross-City Transfer Learning for Traffic Prediction via Source City Region Re-Weighting](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539250)|Yilun Jin, Kai Chen, Qiang Yang|Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Hong Kong, Peoples R China|Deep learning models have been demonstrated powerful in modeling complex spatio-temporal data for traffic prediction. In practice, effective deep traffic prediction models rely on large-scale traffic data, which is not always available in real-world scenarios. To alleviate the data scarcity issue, a promising way is to use cross-city transfer learning methods to fine-tune well-trained models from source cities with abundant data. However, existing approaches overlook the divergence between source and target cities, and thus, the trained model from source cities may contain noise or even harmful source knowledge. To address the problem, we propose CrossTReS, a selective transfer learning framework for traffic prediction that adaptively re-weights source regions to assist target fine-tuning. As a general framework for fine-tuning-based cross-city transfer learning, CrossTReS consists of a feature network, a weighting network, and a prediction model. We train the feature network with node- and edge-level domain adaptation techniques to learn generalizable spatial features for both source and target cities. We further train the weighting network via source-target joint meta-learning such that source regions helpful to target fine-tuning are assigned high weights. Finally, the prediction model is selectively trained on the source city with the learned weights to initialize target fine-tuning. We evaluate CrossTReS using real-world taxi and bike data, where under the same settings, CrossTReS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 8%. Moreover, the learned region weights offer interpretable visualization.|深度学习模型已被证明在复杂时空数据建模以预测交通流量方面具有强大能力。实际应用中，有效的深度交通预测模型依赖大规模交通数据，而这在现实场景中往往难以获取。为缓解数据稀缺问题，一种有效方法是通过跨城市迁移学习技术，利用数据丰富的源城市预训练模型进行目标城市微调。然而现有方法忽视了源城市与目标城市间的差异性，导致源城市训练模型可能包含噪声甚至有害知识。针对该问题，我们提出选择性迁移学习框架CrossTReS，通过自适应重加权源区域来辅助目标域微调。作为基于微调的跨城市通用迁移学习框架，CrossTReS包含特征网络、加权网络和预测模型三个核心组件：首先采用节点级和边级域适应技术训练特征网络，以获取源城市和目标城市通用的空间特征；其次通过源-目标联合元学习训练加权网络，为有助于目标域微调的源区域分配更高权重；最终预测模型根据学得的权重在源城市进行选择性训练，为目标域微调提供初始化参数。基于真实出租车和共享单车数据的实验表明，在相同设置下CrossTReS较现有最优基线模型性能提升最高达8%。此外，学得的区域权重可提供可解释的可视化结果。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Selective+Cross-City+Transfer+Learning+for+Traffic+Prediction+via+Source+City+Region+Re-Weighting)|0|

However, such projections often miss important and rich information. For example, in graph representations used in missing value imputation, items --- represented as nodes --- may contain rich textual information. However, when processing graphs with graph neural networks (GNN), such information is either ignored or summarized into a single vector representation used to initialize the GNN. Towards addressing this, we present CoRGi, a GNN that considers the rich data within nodes in the context of their neighbors. This is achieved by endowing CoRGi's message passing with a personalized attention mechanism over the content of each node. This way, CoRGi assigns user-item-specific attention scores with respect to the words that appear in an item's content. We evaluate CoRGi on two edge-value prediction tasks and show that CoRGi is better at making edge-value predictions over existing methods, especially on sparse regions of the graph.|目标领域的图表示通常将其映射为一组实体（节点）及其关系（边）。然而这种映射往往会丢失重要且丰富的信息。以缺失值插补中使用的图表示为例：项目作为节点可能包含丰富的文本信息，但在使用图神经网络（GNN）处理时，这些信息要么被忽略，要么被压缩为用于初始化GNN的单一向量表示。为解决这一问题，我们提出CoRGi模型——一种能够在邻居语境下充分考虑节点内部丰富数据的图神经网络。该模型通过为消息传递机制赋予针对每个节点内容的个性化注意力机制来实现这一目标，从而能够根据项目内容中的词汇为用户-项目对生成特定的注意力分数。我们在两个边值预测任务上对CoRGi进行评估，结果表明其在边值预测方面优于现有方法，尤其在图的稀疏区域表现更为突出。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=CoRGi:+Content-Rich+Graph+Neural+Networks+with+Attention)|0|
|[ExMeshCNN: An Explainable Convolutional Neural Network Architecture for 3D Shape Analysis](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539463)|Seonggyeom Kim, DongKyu Chae|Hanyang Univ, Dept Artificial Intelligence, Seoul, South Korea|Triangular meshes have been actively used in computer graphics to represent 3D shapes. However, due to their non-uniform and irregular nature, learning such data with a Deep Neural Network is not straightforward. Transforming mesh data to simpler structures (e.g., voxel grids, point clouds, or multi-view 2D images) leads to other issues including spatial information loss and scalability. Traditional descriptors for mesh data simply extract hand-crafted features, which might not be effective in various environments. Several deep architectures that directly consume mesh data have been proposed, but their input features are still heuristic and unable to fully capture both geodesic and geometric characteristics of a mesh. In addition, their model architectures are not designed to be capable of providing visual explanations of their decision making. In this paper, we propose ExMeshCNN, a novel and explainable CNN structure for learning 3D meshes. In the first layer, we implement a descriptor layer composed of two types of learnable descriptors where each focuses on geodesic and geometric characteristics of a mesh, respectively. Then a series of convolution layers follow the descriptor layer to learn local features, where the convolution operations are carefully designed to be performed in a per-face manner. The final layer consists simply of the Global Average Pooling operation and the softmax output. In this way, ExMeshCNN learns mesh data in a completely end-to-end manner while retaining spatial information, where each layer is capable of computing face-level activations and gradients. Owing to these promising properties, existing visual attribution methods for model interpretability, such as LRP and Grad-CAM, can be easily applied to ExMeshCNN to highlight the salient surfaces of a 3D mesh for the corresponding prediction. Experimental results show that ExMeshCNN not only exhibits state-of-the-art or comparable performances in the 3D mesh classification and segmentation with the smallest number of parameters, but also provides the visual explanations of why it makes a specific prediction in the 3D space.|三角网格在计算机图形学中已被广泛用于表示三维形状。然而，由于其非均匀和不规则特性，使用深度神经网络学习此类数据存在挑战。将网格数据转换为更简单的结构（如体素网格、点云或多视角二维图像）会引发空间信息丢失和可扩展性等问题。传统的网格描述符仅能提取手工设计的特征，这些特征在不同环境中可能效果有限。虽然已有一些直接处理网格数据的深度学习架构被提出，但其输入特征仍基于启发式方法，无法同时充分捕捉网格的测地线和几何特征。此外，这些模型的架构设计未能提供决策过程的视觉化解释。本文提出ExMeshCNN——一种新颖且可解释的卷积神经网络结构，专门用于学习三维网格数据。我们在第一层实现了由两类可学习描述符组成的描述层，分别专注于网格的测地特性和几何特性。随后通过一系列卷积层学习局部特征，其中卷积操作经过精心设计以逐面片方式执行。最终层仅包含全局平均池化操作和softmax输出。通过这种方式，ExMeshCNN以完全端到端的方式学习网格数据并保留空间信息，每一层都能计算面片层级的激活值和梯度。凭借这些优异特性，现有模型可解释性视觉归因方法（如LRP和Grad-CAM）可轻松应用于ExMeshCNN，从而突出显示三维网格中对预测结果贡献显著的表面积。实验结果表明，ExMeshCNN不仅在三维网格分类和分割任务中以最少的参数量达到或超越了当前最优性能，还能在三维空间中为特定预测提供视觉化解释。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=ExMeshCNN:+An+Explainable+Convolutional+Neural+Network+Architecture+for+3D+Shape+Analysis)|0|

In a real-world active learning scenario, considering the diversity of the selected samples is crucial because many redundant or highly similar samples exist. Core-set approach is the promising diversity-based method selecting diverse samples based on the distance between samples. However, the approach poorly performs compared to the uncertainty-based approaches that select the most difficult samples where neural models reveal low confidence. In this work, we analyze the feature space through the lens of the density and, interestingly, observe that locally sparse regions tend to have more informative samples than dense regions. Motivated by our analysis, we empower the core-set approach with the density-awareness and propose a density-aware core-set (DACS). The strategy is to estimate the density of the unlabeled samples and select diverse samples mainly from sparse regions. To reduce the computational bottlenecks in estimating the density, we also introduce a new density approximation based on locality-sensitive hashing. Experimental results clearly demonstrate the efficacy of DACS in both classification and regression tasks and specifically show that DACS can produce state-of-the-art performance in a practical scenario. Since DACS is weakly dependent on neural architectures, we present a simple yet effective combination method to show that the existing methods can be beneficially combined with DACS.|主动学习通过从无标注数据集中标注信息量丰富的样本，能够高效构建标注数据集。在实际的主动学习场景中，由于存在大量冗余或高度相似的样本，考虑所选样本的多样性至关重要。核心集方法是基于多样性的代表性方法，它通过样本间距离筛选多样化样本。然而与基于不确定性的方法（选择神经网络模型置信度较低的最困难样本）相比，该方法表现欠佳。本研究从密度视角分析特征空间，有趣地发现局部稀疏区域往往比密集区域包含更多信息丰富的样本。基于此发现，我们为核⼼集方法注⼊密度感知能⼒，提出密度感知核⼼集（DACS）⽅法。该策略通过估计未标注样本的密度，主要从稀疏区域选择多样化样本。为降低密度估计的计算瓶颈，我们还引入了基于局部敏感哈希的新型密度近似算法。实验结果清晰证明了DACS在分类和回归任务中的有效性，特别展示了其在实践场景中可实现最先进性能。由于DACS对神经架构依赖性较弱，我们提出了一种简单有效的组合方法，证明现有方法可与DACS实现优势互补。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=In+Defense+of+Core-set:+A+Density-aware+Core-set+Selection+for+Active+Learning)|0|

In the real-world traffic system with traffic operation actions like traffic signal control or reversible lane changing, the system's state is influenced by both the historical states and the actions of traffic operations. In this paper, we consider the problem of modeling network-level traffic flow under a real-world setting, where the available data is sparse (i.e., only part of the traffic system is observed). We present DTIGNN, an approach that can predict network-level traffic flows from sparse data. DTIGNN models the traffic system as a dynamic graph influenced by traffic signals, learns the transition models grounded by fundamental transition equations from transportation, and predicts future traffic states with imputation in the process.

Since there exists learning dependency among knowledge attributes, it is crucial for cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs) to incorporate attribute hierarchy when assessing students. The attribute hierarchy is only explored by a few CDMs such as Attribute Hierarchy Method, and there are still two significant limitations in these methods. First, the time complexity would be unbearable when the number of attributes is large. Second, the assumption used to model the attribute hierarchy is too strong so that it may lose some information of the hierarchy and is not flexible enough to fit all situations. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Bayesian network-based Hierarchical Cognitive Diagnosis Framework (HierCDF), which enables many traditional diagnostic models to flexibly integrate the attribute hierarchy for better diagnosis. Specifically, we first use an efficient Bayesian network to model the influence of attribute hierarchy on students' cognitive states. Then we design a CDM adaptor to bridge the gap between students' cognitive states and the input features of existing diagnostic models. Finally, we analyze the generality and complexity of HierCDF to show its effectiveness in modeling hierarchy information. The performance of HierCDF is experimentally proved on real-world large-scale datasets.|认知诊断评估是智能教育中的基础任务，旨在量化学生对知识属性的认知水平。由于知识属性间存在学习依赖性，认知诊断模型在评估学生时必须纳入属性层级关系。目前仅属性层级法等少数模型探索了这种层级关系，且存在两大显著局限：一是属性数量较多时时间复杂度难以承受；二是层级建模假设过于严格，可能导致层级信息丢失且灵活性不足。为解决这些问题，我们提出基于贝叶斯网络的层级认知诊断框架（HierCDF），使传统诊断模型能灵活整合属性层级以提升诊断效能。具体而言，首先采用高效贝叶斯网络建模属性层级对认知状态的影响，随后设计认知诊断模型适配器桥接认知状态与现有诊断模型的输入特征，最后通过泛化性和复杂度分析验证框架建模层级信息的有效性。在真实大规模数据集上的实验证明了HierCDF的优越性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=HierCDF:+A+Bayesian+Network-based+Hierarchical+Cognitive+Diagnosis+Framework)|0|
|[Mining Spatio-Temporal Relations via Self-Paced Graph Contrastive Learning](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539422)|Rongfan Li, Ting Zhong, Xinke Jiang, Goce Trajcevski, Jin Wu, Fan Zhou|Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Chengdu, Peoples R China; Iowa State Univ, Ames, IA 50011 USA|Modeling complex spatial and temporal dependencies are indispensable for location-bound time series learning. Existing methods, typically relying on graph neural networks (GNNs) and temporal learning modules based on recurrent neural networks, have achieved significant performance improvements. However, their representation capabilities and prediction results are limited when pre-defined graphs are unavailable. Unlike spatio-temporal GNNs focusing on designing complex architectures, we propose a novel adaptive graph construction strategy: Self-Paced Graph Contrastive Learning (SPGCL). It learns informative relations by maximizing the distinguishing margin between positive and negative neighbors and generates an optimal graph with a self-paced strategy. Specifically, the existing neighborhoods iteratively absorb more reliable nodes with the highest affinity scores as new neighbors to generate the next-round neighborhoods, and augmentations are applied to improve the transferability and robustness. As the adaptively self-paced graph approaches the optimized graph for prediction, the mutual information between nodes and the corresponding neighbors is maximized. Our work provides a new perspective of addressing spatio-temporal learning problems beyond information aggregation in Euclidean space and can be generalized to different tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on two typical spatio-temporal learning tasks (traffic forecasting and land displacement prediction) demonstrate the superior performance of SPGCL against the state-of-the-art.|对位置相关时间序列学习而言，建模复杂的时空依赖性至关重要。现有方法通常依赖图神经网络（GNN）和基于循环神经网络的时间学习模块，已取得显著性能提升。然而当预定义图不可获取时，这些方法的表征能力和预测结果会受到限制。与专注于设计复杂架构的时空图神经网络不同，我们提出了一种新颖的自适应图构建策略：自步调图对比学习（SPGCL）。该方法通过最大化正负邻居间的区分边际来学习信息化关系，并采用自步调策略生成最优图。具体而言，现有邻域通过迭代吸收具有最高亲和度得分的可靠节点作为新邻居，从而生成下一轮邻域，并应用数据增强提升可迁移性和鲁棒性。当自适应自步调图逐渐逼近预测所需的最优图时，节点与对应邻居间的互信息达到最大化。本研究提供了超越欧氏空间信息聚合的时空学习问题解决新视角，可推广至不同任务。在两种典型时空学习任务（交通预测和地表位移预测）上的大量实验表明，SPGCL相比现有最优方法具有卓越性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Mining+Spatio-Temporal+Relations+via+Self-Paced+Graph+Contrastive+Learning)|0|

|[Sparse Conditional Hidden Markov Model for Weakly Supervised Named Entity Recognition](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539247)|Yinghao Li, Le Song, Chao Zhang|Georgia Inst Technol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; MBZUAI, BioMap, Beijing, Peoples R China|Weakly supervised named entity recognition methods train label models to aggregate the token annotations of multiple noisy labeling functions (LFs) without seeing any manually annotated labels. To work well, the label model needs to contextually identify and emphasize well-performed LFs while down-weighting the under-performers. However, evaluating the LFs is challenging due to the lack of ground truths. To address this issue, we propose the sparse conditional hidden Markov model (Sparse-CHMM). Instead of predicting the entire emission matrix as other HMM-based methods, Sparse-CHMM focuses on estimating its diagonal elements, which are considered as the reliability scores of the LFs. The sparse scores are then expanded to the full-fledged emission matrix with pre-defined expansion functions. We also augment the emission with weighted XOR scores, which track the probabilities of an LF observing incorrect entities. Sparse-CHMM is optimized through unsupervised learning with a three-stage training pipeline that reduces the training difficulty and prevents the model from falling into local optima. Compared with the baselines in the Wrench benchmark, Sparse-CHMM achieves a 3.01 average F1 score improvement on five comprehensive datasets. Experiments show that each component of Sparse-CHMM is effective, and the estimated LF reliabilities strongly correlate with true LF F1 scores.|弱监督命名实体识别方法通过训练标签模型来聚合多个噪声标注函数(LF)的标签标注结果，而无需使用任何人工标注数据。为达到良好效果，标签模型需要根据上下文识别并突出表现良好的标注函数，同时降低表现不佳函数的权重。然而由于缺乏真实标注数据，评估标注函数的性能颇具挑战。针对该问题，我们提出稀疏条件隐马尔可夫模型(Sparse-CHMM)。与其他基于隐马尔可夫模型的方法不同，Sparse-CHMM不预测完整的发射矩阵，而是专注于估计其对角线元素——这些元素被视为标注函数的可靠性评分。随后通过预定义的扩展函数将稀疏评分扩展为完整的发射矩阵。我们还采用加权异或评分增强发射矩阵，该评分可追踪标注函数观测到错误实体的概率。通过三阶段训练流程的无监督学习进行优化，Sparse-CHMM有效降低了训练难度并避免模型陷入局部最优。在Wrench基准测试中，Sparse-CHMM在五个综合数据集上实现了平均F1值3.01%的提升。实验表明该模型的每个组件均有效，且估计的标注函数可靠性与真实F1分数呈现强相关性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Sparse+Conditional+Hidden+Markov+Model+for+Weakly+Supervised+Named+Entity+Recognition)|0|

Due to its highly dynamic nature, temporally averaged fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) can only provide a narrow view of underlying brain activities. Previous works lack the ability to learn and interpret the latent dynamics in brain architectures. This paper builds an efficient graph neural network model that incorporates both region-mapped fMRI sequences and structural connectivities obtained from DWI (diffusion-weighted imaging) as inputs. We find good representations of the latent brain dynamics through learning sample-level adaptive adjacency matrices and performing a novel multi-resolution inner cluster smoothing. We also attribute inputs with integrated gradients, which enables us to infer (1) highly involved brain connections and subnetworks for each task, (2) temporal keyframes of imaging sequences that characterize tasks, and (3) subnetworks that discriminate between individual subjects.

As annotating large amounts of data is time-consuming and labor-intensive, data scarcity occurs frequently in real-world scenarios, which motivates multi-label few-shot aspect category detection. However, research on this problem is still in infancy and few methods are available. In this paper, we propose a novel label-enhanced prototypical network (LPN) for multi-label few-shot aspect category detection. The highlights of LPN can be summarized as follows. First, it leverages label description as auxiliary knowledge to learn more discriminative prototypes, which can retain aspect-relevant information while eliminating the harmful effect caused by irrelevant aspects. Second, it integrates with contrastive learning, which encourages that the sentences with the same aspect label are pulled together in embedding space while simultaneously pushing apart the sentences with different aspect labels. In addition, it introduces an adaptive multi-label inference module to predict the aspect count in the sentence, which is simple yet effective.

It protects minority subgroups by requiring the learned representations to be independent of sensitive attributes. To achieve independence, the vast majority of the existing work primarily relaxes it to the minimization of the mutual information between sensitive attributes and learned representations. However, direct computation of mutual information is computationally intractable, and various upper bounds currently used either are still intractable or contradict the utility of the learned representations. In this paper, we introduce distance covariance as a new dependence measure into fair representation learning. By observing that sensitive attributes (e.g., gender, race, and age group) are typically categorical, the distance covariance can be converted to a tractable penalty term without contradicting the utility desideratum. Based on the tractable penalty, we propose FairDisCo, a variational method to learn fair representations.

Most mainstream methods treat each local observation as an entirety when modeling the decentralized local utility functions. However, they ignore the fact that local observation information can be further divided into several entities, and only part of the entities is helpful to model inference. Moreover, the importance of different entities may change over time. To improve the performance of decentralized policies, the attention mechanism is used to capture features of local information. Nevertheless, existing attention models rely on dense fully connected graphs and cannot better perceive important states. To this end, we propose a sparse state based MARL (S2RL) framework, which utilizes a sparse attention mechanism to discard irrelevant information in local observations. The local utility functions are estimated through the self-attention and sparse attention mechanisms separately, then are combined into a standard joint value function and auxiliary joint value function in the central critic. We design the S2RL framework as a plug-and-play module, making it general enough to be applied to various methods. Extensive experiments on StarCraft II show that S2RL can significantly improve the performance of many state-of-the-art methods.|协作式多智能体强化学习（MARL）已在众多实际应用中广泛使用，其中每个智能体根据自身观察做出决策。主流方法在建模分散式局部效用函数时，通常将局部观察视为整体进行处理。然而，这些方法忽略了局部观察信息可进一步划分为多个实体，且仅部分实体对模型推理具有帮助作用这一事实。更重要的是，不同实体的重要性会随时间动态变化。为提升分散式策略的性能，现有研究采用注意力机制来捕捉局部信息的特征。但现有注意力模型依赖于稠密的全连接图结构，难以有效感知关键状态。为此，我们提出基于稀疏状态的MARL框架（S2RL），通过稀疏注意力机制剔除局部观察中的无关信息。该框架分别通过自注意力机制和稀疏注意力机制估计局部效用函数，并将其整合为中心评论器中的标准联合值函数与辅助联合值函数。S2RL被设计为即插即用模块，具有强通用性可应用于多种方法。在《星际争霸II》上的大量实验表明，S2RL能显著提升多种前沿方法的性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=S2RL:+Do+We+Really+Need+to+Perceive+All+States+in+Deep+Multi-Agent+Reinforcement+Learning?)|0|

It plays a pivotal role in causal discovery and many other downstream applications. The methods for causal skeleton learning fall into three primary categories: constraint-based, score-based, and gradient-based methods. This paper, for the first time, advocates for learning a causal skeleton in a supervision-based setting, where the algorithm learns from additional datasets associated with the ground-truth BNs (complementary to input observational data). Concretizing a supervision-based method is non-trivial due to the high complexity of the problem itself, and the potential "domain shift" between training data (i.e., additional datasets associated with ground-truth BNs) and test data (i.e., observational data) in the supervision-based setting. First, it is well-known that skeleton learning suffers worst-case exponential complexity. Second, conventional supervised learning assumes an independent and identical distribution (i.i.d.) on test data, which is not easily attainable due to the divergent underlying causal mechanisms between training and test data. Our proposed framework, ML4S, adopts order-based cascade classifiers and pruning strategies that can withstand high computational overhead without sacrificing accuracy. To address the "domain shift" challenge, we generate training data from vicinal graphs w.r.t. the target BN. The associated datasets of vicinal graphs share similar joint distributions with the observational data. We evaluate ML4S on a variety of datasets and observe that it remarkably outperforms the state of the arts, demonstrating the great potential of the supervision-based skeleton learning paradigm.|因果骨架学习旨在从观测数据中识别潜在因果贝叶斯网络（BN）的无向图结构。该技术在因果发现及众多下游应用中具有关键作用。现有因果骨架学习方法主要分为三类：基于约束的方法、基于评分的方法和基于梯度的方法。本文首次提出在监督学习框架下进行因果骨架学习，该算法通过结合真实因果贝叶斯网络对应的附加数据集（作为输入观测数据的补充）进行训练。由于问题本身的高复杂性，以及监督学习框架中训练数据（即真实BN对应的附加数据集）与测试数据（即观测数据）可能存在的"域偏移"现象，实现有效的监督式学习方法面临重大挑战。首先，骨架学习在最坏情况下具有指数级计算复杂度已是公认难题。其次，传统监督学习假设测试数据满足独立同分布（i.i.d.），但由于训练数据与测试数据背后潜在的因果机制存在差异，该假设难以成立。我们提出的ML4S框架采用基于级联排序的分类器架构和剪枝策略，在保持精度的同时能有效应对高计算开销。针对"域偏移"挑战，我们通过目标BN的邻近图生成训练数据，这些邻近图对应的数据集与观测数据具有相似的联合分布。我们在多个数据集上评估ML4S，发现其性能显著超越现有最优方法，充分证明了监督式骨架学习范式的巨大潜力。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=ML4S:+Learning+Causal+Skeleton+from+Vicinal+Graphs)|0|

Though prevalent and effective in many applications, conventional approaches such as RNNs and Transformers, struggle with handling the non-stationary characteristics (i.e., such temporal-correlation among events would change over time), which is indeed encountered in many real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present a non-stationary time-aware kernelized attention approach for input sequences of neural networks. By constructing the Generalized Spectral Mixture Kernel (GSMK), and integrating it to the attention mechanism, we mathematically reveal its representation capability in terms of the time-dependent temporal-correlation. Following that, a novel neural network structure is proposed, which would enable us to encode both stationary and non-stationary time event series.

In empirical evaluations we show that our method, VARIO, finds invariant variable sets, reveals mechanism changes, and discovers causal networks, such as on real-world data that gives insight into the signaling pathways in human immune cells.|尽管因果机制的不变性已激发稳健机器学习与因果推断领域的多项研究，但因果机制本身也可能因群体特异性差异、数据收集背景或干预措施等因素在不同领域发生变化。为从数据中发现不变性与变化性机制，我们提出将因果关系的算法模型扩展至机制变化场景，并基于最小描述长度原则进行实例化。其核心在于：针对连续变量Y在多重语境C中的表现，若变量X到Y的回归函数g在所有语境中均具有简洁的描述形式，则判定X为因果变量。通过实证评估，我们提出的VARIO方法能够识别不变变量集、揭示机制变化并发现因果网络——例如在真实世界数据分析中成功揭示了人类免疫细胞信号传导通路的内在规律。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Discovering+Invariant+and+Changing+Mechanisms+from+Data)|0|
|[Minimizing Congestion for Balanced Dominators](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539371)|Yosuke Mizutani, Annie Staker, Blair D. Sullivan|Univ Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA|A primary challenge in metagenomics is reconstructing individual microbial genomes from the mixture of short fragments created by sequencing. Recent work leverages the sparsity of the assembly graph to find r-dominating sets which enable rapid approximate queries through a dominator-centric graph partition. In this paper, we consider two problems related to reducing uncertainty and improving scalability in this setting. First, we observe that nodes with multiple closest dominators necessitate arbitrary tie-breaking in the existing pipeline. As such, we propose findingsparse dominating sets which minimize this effect via a newcongestion parameter. We prove minimizing congestion is NP-hard, and give an O (√Δr) approximation algorithm, where Δ is the max degree. To improve scalability, the graph should be partitioned into uniformly sized pieces, subject to placing vertices with a closest dominator. This leads to balanced neighborhood partitioning : given an r-dominating set, find a partition into connected subgraphs with optimal uniformity so that each vertex is co-assigned with some closest dominator. Using variance of piece sizes to measure uniformity, we show this problem is NP-hard iff r is greater than 1. We design and analyze several algorithms, including a polynomial-time approach which is exact when r=1 (and heuristic otherwise). We complement our theoretical results with computational experiments on a corpus of real-world networks showing sparse dominating sets lead to more balanced neighborhood partitionings. Further, on the metagenome fHuSB1, our approach maintains high query containment and similarity while reducing piece size variance.|宏基因组学中的一个核心挑战是从测序产生的短片段混合物中重建个体微生物基因组。近期研究利用组装图的稀疏性寻找r-支配集，通过以支配节点为中心的图划分实现快速近似查询。本文针对该领域中降低不确定性和提升可扩展性两大问题展开研究。首先，我们观察到当节点存在多个最近支配节点时，现有流程需进行任意断点处理。为此，我们提出通过新型拥塞参数寻找稀疏支配集以最小化该影响，并证明最小化拥塞属于NP难问题，同时给出O(√Δr)近似算法（Δ为最大度值）。为提升可扩展性，需在遵循"顶点与最近支配节点同组"原则下将图划分为均匀子块，由此引出平衡邻域划分问题：给定r-支配集，寻求将图划分为连通子图的最优均匀方案。通过子图尺寸方差衡量均匀度，我们证明该问题在r＞1时具NP难特性。我们设计并分析了多种算法，包括在r=1时精确的多项式时间算法（r＞1时启发性适用）。通过真实网络数据集的计算实验证实：稀疏支配集可产生更平衡的邻域划分。在fHuSB1宏基因组数据上，我们的方法在降低子图尺寸方差的同时，保持了高查询包含度与相似性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Minimizing+Congestion+for+Balanced+Dominators)|0|

Most existing works rely on adversarial representation learning to inject some invariance into representation. However, adversarial learning methods are known to suffer from relatively unstable training, and this might harm the balance between fairness and predictiveness of representation. We propose a new approach, learningFAir Representation via distributional CONtrastive Variational AutoEncoder (FarconVAE), which induces the latent space to be disentangled into sensitive and non-sensitive parts. We first construct the pair of observations with different sensitive attributes but with the same labels. Then, FarconVAE enforces each non-sensitive latent to be closer, while sensitive latents to be far from each other and also far from the non-sensitive latent by contrasting their distributions. We provide a new type of contrastive loss motivated by Gaussian and Student-t kernels for distributional contrastive learning with theoretical analysis. Besides, we adopt a new swap-reconstruction loss to boost the disentanglement further. FarconVAE shows superior performance on fairness, pretrained model debiasing, and domain generalization tasks from various modalities, including tabular, image, and text.|学习公平表示对于实现公平性或消除敏感信息偏差至关重要。现有研究大多依赖对抗式表示学习来注入某种不变性。然而众所周知，对抗学习方法存在训练不稳定的问题，这可能影响表示在公平性与预测性之间的平衡。我们提出了一种新方法——通过分布对比变分自编码器学习公平表示（FarconVAE），该方法将潜在空间解耦为敏感部分与非敏感部分。我们首先构建具有不同敏感属性但相同标签的观测数据对，随后FarconVAE通过对比分布，强制非敏感潜在变量相互靠近，而敏感潜在变量不仅相互远离，同时与非敏感潜在变量保持距离。基于高斯核和学生t核的理论分析，我们提出了一种新型分布对比损失函数。此外，采用交换重构损失进一步增强解耦效果。FarconVAE在表格、图像和文本等多种模态的公平性任务、预训练模型去偏任务及领域泛化任务中均展现出卓越性能。

|[MetaV: A Meta-Verifier Approach to Task-Agnostic Model Fingerprinting](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539257)|Xudong Pan, Yifan Yan, Mi Zhang, Min Yang|Fudan Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China|Protecting the intellectual property (IP) of deep neural networks (DNN) becomes an urgent concern for IT corporations. For model piracy forensics, previous model fingerprinting schemes are commonly based on adversarial examples constructed for the owner's model as the fingerprint, and verify whether a suspect model is indeed pirated from the original model by matching the behavioral pattern on the fingerprint examples between one another. However, these methods heavily rely on the characteristics of classification tasks which inhibits their application to more general scenarios. To address this issue, we present MetaV, the first task-agnostic model fingerprinting framework which enables fingerprinting on a much wider range of DNNs independent from the downstream learning task, and exhibits strong robustness against a variety of ownership obfuscation techniques. Specifically, we generalize previous schemes into two critical design components in MetaV: the adaptive fingerprint and the meta-verifier, which are jointly optimized such that the meta-verifier learns to determine whether a suspect model is stolen based on the concatenated outputs of the suspect model on the adaptive fingerprint. As a key of being task-agnostic, the full process makes no assumption on the model internals in the ensemble only if they have the same input and output dimensions. Spanning classification, regression and generative modeling, extensive experimental results validate the substantially improved performance of MetaV over the state-of-the-art fingerprinting schemes and demonstrate the enhanced generality of MetaV for providing task-agnostic fingerprinting. For example, on fingerprinting ResNet-18 trained for skin cancer diagnosis, MetaV achieves simultaneously 100% true positives and 100% true negatives on a diverse test set of 70 suspect models, achieving an about 220% relative improvement in ARUC over the optimal baseline.|保护深度神经网络（DNN）的知识产权（IP）已成为科技企业的紧迫议题。针对模型盗版取证，现有模型指纹方案通常以针对所有者模型构建的对抗样本作为指纹，通过比对可疑模型与原始模型在指纹样本上的行为模式一致性来验证盗版行为。然而，这些方法过度依赖分类任务的特性，限制了其在更广泛场景中的应用。为此，我们提出首个任务无关的模型指纹框架MetaV，该框架可脱离下游学习任务对更广泛的DNN模型进行指纹识别，并对多种所有权混淆技术展现出强鲁棒性。具体而言，我们将现有方案泛化为MetaV的两个核心组件：自适应指纹与元验证器。通过联合优化使元验证器学会根据可疑模型在自适应指纹上的拼接输出判断其是否盗版。作为实现任务无关的关键，整个流程仅需确保模型集合具有相同的输入输出维度，无需任何模型内部结构的先验假设。在分类、回归和生成建模三大任务上的大量实验表明，MetaV相比最先进指纹方案性能显著提升，验证了其增强的任务无关通用性。以皮肤癌诊断任务的ResNet-18模型为例，MetaV在包含70个可疑模型的多样化测试集上同时实现100%真阳性率和100%真阴性率，其ARUC指标相较最优基线实现约220%的相对提升。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=MetaV:+A+Meta-Verifier+Approach+to+Task-Agnostic+Model+Fingerprinting)|0|
|[Predicting Opinion Dynamics via Sociologically-Informed Neural Networks](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539228)|Maya Okawa, Tomoharu Iwata|NTT Human Informat Labs, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan; NTT Commun Sci Labs, Kyoto, Japan|Opinion formation and propagation are crucial phenomena in social networks and have been extensively studied across several disciplines. Traditionally, theoretical models of opinion dynamics have been proposed to describe the interactions between individuals (i.e., social interaction) and their impact on the evolution of collective opinions. Although these models can incorporate sociological and psychological knowledge on the mechanisms of social interaction, they demand extensive calibration with real data to make reliable predictions, requiring much time and effort. Recently, the widespread use of social media platforms provides new paradigms to learn deep learning models from a large volume of social media data. However, these methods ignore any scientific knowledge about the mechanism of social interaction. In this work, we present the first hybrid method called Sociologically-Informed Neural Network (SINN), which integrates theoretical models and social media data by transporting the concepts of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) from natural science (i.e., physics) into social science (i.e., sociology and social psychology). In particular, we recast theoretical models as ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Then we train a neural network that simultaneously approximates the data and conforms to the ODEs that represent the social scientific knowledge. In addition, we extend PINNs by integrating matrix factorization and a language model to incorporate rich side information (e.g., user profiles) and structural knowledge (e.g., cluster structure of the social interaction network). Moreover, we develop an end-to-end training procedure for SINN, which involves Gumbel-Softmax approximation to include stochastic mechanisms of social interaction. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets show SINN outperforms six baseline methods in predicting opinion dynamics.|观点形成与传播是社交网络中的关键现象，已在多个学科领域得到广泛研究。传统上，学者们提出观点动力学的理论模型来描述个体间互动（即社会互动）及其对集体观点演化的影响。尽管这些模型能够融入关于社会互动机制的社会学和心理学知识，但需要大量真实数据进行校准才能做出可靠预测，耗费大量时间和精力。近年来，社交媒体平台的广泛使用为从海量社交媒体数据中学习深度学习模型提供了新范式，但这些方法忽略了关于社会互动机制的科学知识。本研究首次提出名为"社会学知识引导神经网络"（SINN）的混合方法，通过将物理信息神经网络（PINNs）的概念从自然科学（物理学）迁移到社会科学（社会学与社会心理学），实现了理论模型与社交媒体数据的融合。具体而言，我们将理论模型重构为常微分方程（ODEs），然后训练一个同时满足数据拟合和符合社会科学知识ODEs约束的神经网络。此外，我们通过集成矩阵分解和语言模型来扩展PINNs，以融入丰富的辅助信息（如用户画像）和结构知识（如社交互动网络的聚类结构）。更重要的是，我们开发了SINN的端到端训练流程，采用Gumbel-Softmax近似方法来包含社会互动的随机机制。在真实世界和合成数据集上的大量实验表明，SINN在预测观点动力学方面优于六种基线方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Predicting+Opinion+Dynamics+via+Sociologically-Informed+Neural+Networks)|0|

To defend against MI attacks, previous work utilizes a unilateral dependency optimization strategy, i.e., minimizing the dependency between inputs (i.e., features) and outputs (i.e., labels) during training the classifier. However, such a minimization process conflicts with minimizing the supervised loss that aims to maximize the dependency between inputs and outputs, causing an explicit trade-off between model robustness against MI attacks and model utility on classification tasks. In this paper, we aim to minimize the dependency between the latent representations and the inputs while maximizing the dependency between latent representations and the outputs, named a bilateral dependency optimization (BiDO) strategy. In particular, we use the dependency constraints as a universally applicable regularizer in addition to commonly used losses for deep neural networks (e.g., cross-entropy), which can be instantiated with appropriate dependency criteria according to different tasks. To verify the efficacy of our strategy, we propose two implementations of BiDO, by using two different dependency measures: BiDO with constrained covariance (BiDO-COCO) and BiDO with Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (BiDO-HSIC). Experiments show that BiDO achieves the state-of-the-art defense performance for a variety of datasets, classifiers, and MI attacks while suffering a minor classification-accuracy drop compared to the well-trained classifier with no defense, which lights up a novel road to defend against MI attacks.|仅通过使用训练有素的分类器，模型逆向（MI）攻击便能恢复用于训练分类器的数据，导致训练数据的隐私泄露。为防御MI攻击，已有研究采用单边依赖优化策略，即在训练分类器时最小化输入（特征）与输出（标签）之间的依赖性。然而，这种最小化过程与旨在最大化输入输出依赖性的监督损失最小化目标相冲突，导致模型抗MI攻击的鲁棒性与模型在分类任务上的实用性之间出现明显权衡。本文提出双边依赖优化（BiDO）策略，旨在最小化潜在表示与输入之间依赖性的同时，最大化潜在表示与输出之间的依赖性。具体而言，我们将依赖约束作为通用正则化项，与深度神经网络常用损失函数（如交叉熵）结合使用，并可根据不同任务选用合适的依赖度量准则进行实例化。为验证策略有效性，我们基于两种依赖度量提出BiDO的两种实现：基于约束协方差的BiDO（BiDO-COCO）和基于希尔伯特-施密特独立性准则的BiDO（BiDO-HSIC）。实验表明，在多种数据集、分类器和MI攻击场景下，BiDO均达到最先进的防御性能，且与无防御的成熟分类器相比仅产生轻微的分类精度损失，这为防御MI攻击开辟了新路径。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Bilateral+Dependency+Optimization:+Defending+Against+Model-inversion+Attacks)|0|

However, symbolic computation is always treated as an end-to-end blackbox prediction task, where human-like symbolic deductive logic is missing. In this paper, we argue that any complex symbolic computation can be broken down to a sequence of finite Fundamental Computation Transformations (FCT), which are grounded as certain mathematical expression computation transformations. The entire computation sequence represents a full human understandable symbolic deduction process. Instead of studying on different end-to-end neural network applications, this paper focuses on approximating FCT which further build up symbolic deductive logic. To better mimic symbolic computations with math expression transformations, we propose a novel tree representation learning architecture GATE (Graph Aggregation Transformer Encoder) for math expressions. We generate a large-scale math expression transformation dataset for training purpose and collect a real-world dataset for validation. Experiments demonstrate the feasibility of producing step-by-step human-like symbolic deduction sequences with the proposed approach, which outperforms other neural network approaches and heuristic approaches.|神经网络在符号计算领域的能力已通过大量近期研究得以显现。然而，符号计算始终被视为端到端的黑箱预测任务，其中缺乏类人的符号演绎逻辑。本文提出，任何复杂的符号计算均可被分解为有限个基本计算变换（FCT）的序列，这些变换以特定数学表达式计算转换的形式实现。完整的计算序列构成了人类可理解的符号演绎过程。不同于研究各类端到端的神经网络应用，本文着眼于逼近能构建符号演绎逻辑的基本计算变换。为更好地通过数学表达式变换模拟符号计算，我们提出创新的树状表征学习架构GATE（图聚合Transformer编码器）用于数学表达式处理。我们生成大规模数学表达式转换数据集用于训练，并收集真实场景数据集进行验证。实验证明，采用所提出方法可生成逐步推进的类人符号演绎序列，其性能优于其他神经网络方法与启发式方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Compute+Like+Humans:+Interpretable+Step-by-step+Symbolic+Computation+with+Deep+Neural+Network)|0|

Generally, two major components information extraction (IE) and entity linking (EL) are involved in KG construction. However, the existing approaches just focus on evaluating the triple accuracy that indicates the IE quality, completely ignoring the entity accuracy. Motivated by the fact that the major advance of machines is the strong computing power while humans are skilled in correctness verification, we propose an efficient interactive method to reduce the overall cost for evaluating the KG quality, which produces accuracy estimates with a statistical guarantee for both triples and entities. Instead of annotating triples and entities separately, we design a general annotation cost that blends triples and entities generated from the identical source text. During human verification, the machine can pre-compute and infer triples to be annotated in the next round by speculating human feedback. The human-machine collaborative mechanism is optimized by formulating an order selection problem of triples which is NP-hard. Thus, a Monte Carlo Tree Search is proposed to guide the annotation process by finding an approximate solution.

Rossi, Yun Fu|Adobe Res, San Francisco, CA 94107 USA; Northeastern Univ, Boston, MA 02115 USA|Tabular pre-training models have received increasing attention due to the wide-ranging applications for tabular data analysis. However, most of the existing solutions are directly built upon the tabular data with a mixture of non-semantic and semantic contents. According to the statistics, only 30% of tabular data in wikitables are semantic entities that are surrounded and isolated by enormous irregular characters such as numbers, strings, symbols, etc. Despite the small portion, such semantic entities are crucial for table understanding. This paper attempts to enhance the existing tabular pre-training model by injecting common-sense knowledge from external sources. Compared with the knowledge injection in the natural language pre-training models, the tabular model naturally requires overcoming the domain gaps between external knowledge and tabular data with significant differences in both structures and contents. To this end, we propose the dual-adapters inserted within the pre-trained tabular model for flexible and efficient knowledge injection. The two parallel adapters are trained by the knowledge graph triplets and semantically augmented tables respectively for infusion and alignment with the tabular data. In addition, a path-wise attention layer is attached below to fuse the cross-domain representation with the weighted contribution.

Recent research has shown that existing survival techniques are prone to unintentional biases towards protected attributes such as age, race, and/or gender. For example, censoring assumed to be unrelated to the prognosis and covariates (typically violated in real data) often leads to overestimation and biased survival predictions for different protected groups. In order to attenuate harmful bias and ensure fair survival predictions, we introduce fairness definitions based on survival functions and censoring. We propose novel fair and interpretable survival models which use pseudo valued-based objective functions with fairness definitions as constraints for predicting subject-specific survival probabilities. Experiments on three real-world survival datasets demonstrate that our proposed fair survival models show significant improvement over existing survival techniques in terms of accuracy and fairness measures. We show that our proposed models provide fair predictions for protected attributes under different types and amounts of censoring.

|[A Generalized Backward Compatibility Metric](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539465)|Tomoya Sakai|NEC Corp Ltd, Minato ku, Tokyo, Japan|Retraining a classifier with new data is inseparable from ML/AI applications, but most of the existing ML methods do not take into account the backward compatibility of predictions. That is, although the overall performance of a new classifier is improved, users will be confused by the wrong predictions of the new classifier, especially when the predictions of the old classifier are correct for the same samples. To this end, several metrics and learning methods for backward compatibility have been actively studied recently. Despite significant interest in backward compatibility, the metrics and methods are not well known from a theoretical perspective. In this paper, we first analyze the existing backward compatibility metrics and reveal that these metrics essentially assess the same quantity between old and new models. In addition, to obtain a unified view of backward compatibility metrics, we propose a generalized backward compatibility (GBC) metric that can represent the existing backward compatibility metrics. We formulate a learning objective based on the GBC metric and derive the estimation error bound, and the result is applied to one of the existing methods. Through further analysis, we reveal that the existing backward compatibility metrics are not suitable for imbalanced classification.

|[Multi-View Clustering for Open Knowledge Base Canonicalization](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539449)|Wei Shen, Yang Yang, Yinan Liu|Nankai Univ, Coll Comp Sci, TMCC, TKLNDST, Tianjin, Peoples R China|Open information extraction (OIE) methods extract plenty of OIE triples from unstructured text, which compose large open knowledge bases (OKBs). Noun phrases and relation phrases in such OKBs are not canonicalized, which leads to scattered and redundant facts. It is found that two views of knowledge (i.e., a fact view based on the fact triple and a context view based on the fact triple's source context) provide complementary information that is vital to the task of OKB canonicalization, which clusters synonymous noun phrases and relation phrases into the same group and assigns them unique identifiers. However, these two views of knowledge have so far been leveraged in isolation by existing works. In this paper, we propose CMVC, a novel unsupervised framework that leverages these two views of knowledge jointly for canonicalizing OKBs without the need of manually annotated labels. To achieve this goal, we propose a multi-view CH K-Means clustering algorithm to mutually reinforce the clustering of view-specific embeddings learned from each view by considering their different clustering qualities. In order to further enhance the canonicalization performance, we propose a training data optimization strategy in terms of data quantity and data quality respectively in each particular view to refine the learned view-specific embeddings in an iterative manner. Additionally, we propose a Log-Jump algorithm to predict the optimal number of clusters in a data-driven way without requiring any labels. We demonstrate the superiority of our framework through extensive experiments on multiple real-world OKB data sets against state-of-the-art methods.|开放信息抽取（OIE）方法从非结构化文本中提取大量OIE三元组，构成了大规模开放知识库（OKB）。此类OKB中的名词短语和关系短语未经规范化处理，导致知识事实分散冗余。研究发现，知识的双视角（即基于事实三元组的事实视角与基于三元组源上下文的情境视角）为OKB规范化任务提供了至关重要的互补信息——该任务通过将同义名词短语和关系短语聚类至同一组并分配唯一标识符来实现知识规范化。然而现有研究始终孤立地利用这两种知识视角。本文提出无监督框架CMVC，首次联合利用双视角知识实现OKB的自动化规范化，无需人工标注数据。为实现这一目标，我们提出多视角CH K-Means聚类算法，通过考量不同视角特有的聚类质量，使从各视角学习到的视角特定嵌入在聚类过程中相互增强。为进一步提升规范化性能，我们针对每个特定视角分别提出数据数量与数据质量双维度的训练数据优化策略，以迭代方式精化学习的视角特定嵌入。此外，我们提出Log-Jump算法，通过数据驱动方式预测最佳聚类数量而无需任何标注。通过在多个真实世界OKB数据集上开展的广泛实验，我们验证了本框架相较于现有最优方法的卓越性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Multi-View+Clustering+for+Open+Knowledge+Base+Canonicalization)|0|

Herewe analyze task fMRI (t-fMRI) data where the subject performs a multi-event task over multiple trials. t-fMRI data allows exploring more challenging applications such as prognosis of treatment but at the cost of being more complex to analyze. Not only do multiple types of trials exist but the trials of each type are repeated a varying number of times for each subject. This leads to a multi-view (multiple types of trials) and multi-instance (multiple trials of each type of each subject) setting. We propose a deep multi-model architecture to encode multi-view brain activities from t-fMRI data and a multi-layer perceptron ensemble model to combine these view models and make subject-wise predictions. We explore domain adaptation transfer learning between models to address unbalanced views and a novel way to make predictions out of multi-instance embeddings. We evaluate our model's performance on subject-wise cross-validations to accurately determine performance. The experimental results show the proposed method outperforms published methods on the AX-CPT fMRI data for the prognosis problem of predicting treatment improvement in recent-onset childhood schizophrenia.

However, due to unforeseen situations in the open world, distribution shift often occurs in applications. For instance, in the image recognition task, an unpredictable distributional shift may occur due to changes in background or lighting. Furthermore, to alleviate the harm of distribution shift, the resource budget is not infinite and often constrained. To cope with such a novel problem Resource Constrained Adaptation under Unknown Shift, in this paper we study active model adaptation both theoretically and empirically. First, we present a generalization analysis of active model adaptation for distribution shift. In theory, we show that active model adaptation could improve the generalization error from O(1/N) to O(1/N), with only a few queried samples. Second, based on the theoretical analysis, we present a systemic solution Auto, consisting of three sub-steps, that is, distribution tracking, sample selection and model adaptation. Specifically, we design a shifted distribution detection module to locate the distributional shifted samples. To fit the labeling budget, we employ a core-set algorithm to enhance the informativeness of the selected samples. Finally, we update the model through the newly queried labeled data. We conduct empirical studies of nine existing active strategies on diverse real world data sets and the results show that Auto could remarkably outperform all the baselines.|成功的机器学习通常依赖于固定的数据分布。然而在开放世界中，由于不可预见的状况，实际应用常会出现分布偏移。例如在图像识别任务中，背景或光照条件的变化可能导致不可预测的分布偏移。此外，为缓解分布偏移带来的危害，资源预算往往有限而非无限。为应对这一"未知偏移下的资源受限自适应"新问题，本文从理论与实证两方面研究主动模型自适应方法。首先，我们提出了分布偏移场景下主动模型自适应的泛化性理论分析，从理论上证明仅需少量查询样本即可将泛化误差从O(1/N)提升至O(1/N²)。其次基于理论分析，我们构建了包含三个子步骤的系统性解决方案Auto：分布追踪、样本选择与模型自适应。具体而言，我们设计了偏移分布检测模块来定位分布偏移样本；为适配标注预算，采用核心集算法增强所选样本的信息量；最后通过新获取的标注数据更新模型。我们在多个真实世界数据集上对九种现有主动策略进行实证研究，结果表明Auto能够显著超越所有基线方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Active+Model+Adaptation+Under+Unknown+Shift)|0|

However, concerns have been raised that GNNs could make biased decisions against underprivileged groups or individuals. To remedy this issue, researchers have proposed various fairness notions including individual fairness that gives similar predictions to similar individuals. However, existing methods in individual fairness rely on Lipschitz condition: they only optimize overall individual fairness and disregard equality of individual fairness between groups. This leads to drastically different levels of individual fairness among groups. We tackle this problem by proposing a novel GNN framework GUIDE to achieve group equality informed individual fairness in GNNs. We aim to not only achieve individual fairness but also equalize the levels of individual fairness among groups. Specifically, our framework operates on the similarity matrix of individuals to learn personalized attention to achieve individual fairness without group level disparity. Comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that GUIDE obtains good balance of group equality informed individual fairness and model utility.

However, deep learning models often require a large amount of annotated data to achieve satisfactory performance, and NER annotation is significantly time-consuming and labor-intensive due to the fine-grained labels. To address this issue, we propose a textual data augmentation method that can automatically generate informative synthetic samples, which contribute to the development of a robust classifier. The proposed method generates additional training data by estimating the optimal level of worst-case transformation of training data while preserving the original annotation, and includes them into training to construct a robust decision boundary. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets in a low-resource environment reveal that the proposed method outperforms two baseline augmentation methods including human annotation, which is typically considered to provide a decent amount of performance boost.

Momentum-based acceleration of SGD is the default optimizer for many deep learning models. However, there is a lack of general convergence guarantees for many existing momentum variants in conjunction withstochastic gradient. It is also unclear how the momentum methods may affect thegeneralization error. In this paper, we give a unified analysis of several popular optimizers, e.g., Polyak's heavy ball momentum and Nesterov's accelerated gradient. Our contribution is threefold. First, we give a unified convergence guarantee for a large class of momentum variants in thestochastic setting. Notably, our results cover both convex and nonconvex objectives. Second, we prove a generalization bound for neural networks trained by momentum variants. We analyze how hyperparameters affect the generalization bound and consequently propose guidelines on how to tune these hyperparameters in various momentum schemes to generalize well. We provide extensive empirical evidence to our proposed guidelines. Third, this study fills the vacancy of a formal analysis of fine-tuning in literature.

Observing winds is a complex process and presents a large gap in NASA's Earth Observation System. Atmospheric motion vectors (AMVs) aim to fill this gap by making numerical estimates of cloud movement between sequences of multi-spectral satellite images, tracking clouds and water vapor. Recent imaging hardware and software advancements have enabled the use of numerical optical flow techniques to produce accurate and dense vector fields outperforming traditional methods. This work presents WindFlow as the first machine learning based system for feature tracking atmospheric motion using optical flow. Due to the lack of large-scale satellite-based observations, we leverage high-resolution numerical simulations from NASA's GEOS-5 Nature Run to perform supervised learning and transfer to satellite images. We demonstrate that our approach using deep learning based optical flow scales to ultra-high-resolution images of size 2881x5760 with less than 1 m/s bias and 2.5 m/s average error. Four network and learning architectures are compared and it is found that recurrent all-pairs field transforms (RAFT) produces the lowest errors on all metrics for wind speed and direction. Results on held out numerical outputs show RAFT's good performance in each of the spatial, temporal, and physical dimensions. A comparison between WindFlow and an operational AMV product against rawinsonde observations shows that RAFT transfers across simulations and thermal infrared satellite observations. This work shows that machine learning based optical flow is an efficient approach to generating robust feature tracking for AMVs consistently over large regions.|大气风是影响自然灾害、能源输送、洋流运动、大尺度环流和生态系统通量的关键物理现象。由于观测过程复杂，风场观测一直是NASA地球观测系统中的重要空白领域。大气运动矢量（AMV）技术通过分析多光谱卫星图像序列中的云层运动，追踪云系和水汽轨迹来填补这一空白。近年来成像硬件与软件的进步，使得数值光流技术能够生成比传统方法更精确、更密集的矢量场。本研究提出的WindFlow系统首次实现基于机器学习的光流法大气运动特征追踪。针对卫星观测数据不足的现状，我们利用NASA GEOS-5 Nature Run的高分辨率数值模拟数据进行监督学习，并将其迁移至卫星图像。实验表明，基于深度学习的光流方法可扩展至2881×5760像素的超高分辨率图像，风速偏差小于1米/秒，平均误差低于2.5米/秒。通过比较四种网络与学习架构，发现循环全对场变换（RAFT）在风速风向所有指标上误差最低。在预留数值输出数据上的测试表明，RAFT在空间、时间和物理维度均表现良好。将WindFlow与业务化AMV产品分别对比无线电探空观测数据，证实RAFT能够有效实现数值模拟与热红外卫星观测的跨域迁移。本研究表明，基于机器学习的光流法是一种高效方法，可在大范围区域内持续生成稳健的AMV特征追踪结果。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Dense+Feature+Tracking+of+Atmospheric+Winds+with+Deep+Optical+Flow)|0|

Although a number of works have been proposed in recent years, most of contemporary works acquire the traits parameters of learners and items in a transductive way, which are only suitable for stationary data. However, in the real scenario, the data is collected online, where learners, test items and interactions usually grow continuously, which can rarely meet the stationary condition. To this end, we propose a novel framework, Incremental Cognitive Diagnosis (ICD), to tailor cognitive diagnosis into the online scenario of intelligent education. Specifically, we first design a Deep Trait Network (DTN), which acquires the trait parameters in an inductive way rather than a transductive way. Then, we propose an Incremental Update Algorithm (IUA) to balance the effectiveness and training efficiency. We carry out Turning Point (TP) analysis to reduce update frequency, where we derive the minimum update condition based on the monotonicity theory of cognitive diagnosis. Meanwhile, we use a momentum update strategy on the incremental data to decrease update time without sacrificing effectiveness. Moreover, to keep the trait parameters as stable as possible, we refine the loss function in the incremental updating stage. Last but no least, our ICD is a general framework which can be applied to most of contemporary cognitive diagnosis models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to investigate the incremental cognitive diagnosis problem with theoretical results about the update condition and a tailored incremental learning strategy.

To our best knowledge, we propose the first differentially private topic mining technique (namely TopicDP) which injects well-calibrated Gaussian noise into the matrix output of any topic mining algorithm to ensure differential privacy and good utility. Specifically, we smoothen the sensitivity for the Gaussian mechanism via sensitivity sampling, which addresses the major challenges resulted from the high sensitivity in topic mining for differential privacy. Furthermore, we theoretically prove the differential privacy guarantee under the Rényi differential privacy mechanism and the utility error bounds of TopicDP. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on two real-word text datasets (Enron email and Amazon Reviews), and the experimental results demonstrate that TopicDP is a model-agnostic framework that can generate better privacy preserving performance for topic mining as compared against other differential privacy mechanisms.|主题挖掘旨在从文本数据（如文档、电子邮件和产品评论）中提取模式与洞察，可应用于意图检测等多个场景。然而，主题挖掘可能对贡献文本语料的用户构成严重隐私威胁，因为攻击者凭借特定背景知识可能从文本数据中重新识别用户身份。据我们所知，我们提出了首个差分隐私主题挖掘技术（命名为TopicDP），该技术通过向任意主题挖掘算法的矩阵输出注入精确校准的高斯噪声，在保证差分隐私的同时维持良好实用性。具体而言，我们通过灵敏度采样机制平滑高斯机制的敏感度，有效解决了差分隐私主题挖掘中因高敏感度带来的核心挑战。此外，我们从理论层面证明了TopicDP在Rényi差分隐私框架下的隐私保障能力，并推导出其效用误差边界。最后，我们在两个真实文本数据集（Enron电子邮件和亚马逊评论）上进行了大量实验，结果表明与其他差分隐私机制相比，TopicDP作为模型无关框架能够为主题挖掘提供更优的隐私保护性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=A+Model-Agnostic+Approach+to+Differentially+Private+Topic+Mining)|0|

Can we simultaneously address the automation, explicitness, and optimal challenges in representation space reconstruction for a machine learning task? To answer this question, we propose a group-wise reinforcement generation perspective. We reformulate representation space reconstruction into an interactive process of nested feature generation and selection, where feature generation is to generate new meaningful and explicit features, and feature selection is to eliminate redundant features to control feature sizes. We develop a cascading reinforcement learning method that leverages three cascading Markov Decision Processes to learn optimal generation policies to automate the selection of features and operations and the feature crossing. We design a group-wise generation strategy to cross a feature group, an operation, and another feature group to generate new features and find the strategy that can enhance exploration efficiency and augment reward signals of cascading agents. Finally, we present extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, traceability, and explicitness of our system.|表示（特征）空间是一种数据向量化的环境，在此空间中可计算距离、刻画模式并嵌入几何结构。构建优质表示空间对于解决维度灾难、提升模型泛化能力、克服数据稀疏性以及增强经典模型可用性至关重要。现有研究（如特征工程和表示学习）在实现全自动化（如过度依赖密集型劳动与经验）、可解释的显式性（如可追溯的重构过程与可解释的新特征）以及灵活最优性（如最优特征空间重构未嵌入下游任务）方面存在局限。我们能否在机器学习任务的特征空间重构中同时解决自动化、显式性与最优化这三大挑战？针对该问题，本文提出一种分组强化生成框架。我们将特征空间重构重新定义为嵌套式特征生成与选择的交互过程：特征生成旨在创建有意义且显式的新特征，特征选择则通过消除冗余特征来控制特征规模。我们开发了一种级联强化学习方法，利用三个级联马尔可夫决策过程学习最优生成策略，以实现特征选择、操作选择及特征交叉的自动化。设计了分组生成策略，通过交叉特征组、操作符与另一特征组来生成新特征，该策略能提升探索效率并增强级联智能体的奖励信号。最后，通过大量实验验证了系统在有效性、效率、可追溯性与可解释性方面的优势。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Group-wise+Reinforcement+Feature+Generation+for+Optimal+and+Explainable+Representation+Space+Reconstruction)|0|

In this work, we propose a novel framework to elicit relational structures from large-scale pre-trained language models (PLMs) via a probing procedure based on Poincaré distance metric, and use the induced relations to augment current graph-based parsers for better schema linking. Compared with commonly-used rule-based methods for schema linking, we found that probing relations can robustly capture semantic correspondences, even when surface forms of mentions and entities differ. Moreover, our probing procedure is entirely unsupervised and requires no additional parameters. Extensive experiments show that our framework sets new state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks. We empirically verify that our probing procedure can indeed find desired relational structures through qualitative analysis.|构建可应用于新数据库的文本到SQL解析器的重要性早已得到公认，而实现这一目标的关键步骤是模式链接——即在生成SQL时准确识别未见过的列或表的提及。本研究提出了一种新颖框架，通过基于庞加莱距离度量的探测过程，从大规模预训练语言模型中提取关系结构，并利用推导出的关系来增强当前基于图的解析器，以优化模式链接。与常用的基于规则的模式链接方法相比，我们发现关系探测能够稳健地捕捉语义对应关系，即使在提及项与实体表面形式存在差异的情况下也是如此。此外，我们的探测过程完全无监督，且无需额外参数。大量实验表明，我们的框架在三个基准测试中创造了最新的性能纪录。我们通过定性分析实证验证了该探测过程确实能够发现预期的关系结构。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Proton:+Probing+Schema+Linking+Information+from+Pre-trained+Language+Models+for+Text-to-SQL+Parsing)|0|
|[Partial Label Learning with Discrimination Augmentation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539363)|Wei Wang, MinLing Zhang|Southeast Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210096, Peoples R China|Partial label learning is a weakly supervised learning framework where each training example is associated with multiple candidate labels, among which only one is valid. Existing works on partial label learning mainly focus on classification model induction by disambiguating candidate label sets in the output space. Nevertheless, the feature representations of partial label training examples may be less informative of the ground-truth labels, which may result in negative influences on the disambiguation process. To circumvent this difficulty, the first attempt towards discrimination augmentation for partial label learning is investigated in this paper. The feature space is enriched with confidence-rated class prototype features to replenish discriminative characteristics of the underlying ground-truth labels for partial label training examples. Specially, an optimization formulation is proposed to jointly optimize the class prototype and estimate the labeling confidence over partial label training examples, which enforces both global consistency in the feature space and local consistency in the label space. We show that the class prototypes and the labeling confidence can be solved via alternating optimization. Extensive experiments on synthetic as well as real-world data sets validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for improving the generalization performance of state-of-the-art partial label learning algorithms.|偏标记学习是一种弱监督学习框架，其中每个训练样本与多个候选标签相关联，而其中仅有一个是真实标记。现有的偏标记学习方法主要关注通过在输出空间中对候选标签集进行消歧来诱导分类模型。然而，偏标记训练样本的特征表示可能包含较少的真实标签信息，这可能会对消歧过程产生负面影响。为克服这一困难，本文首次探索了偏标记学习中判别性增强的方法。通过引入带置信度评级的类别原型特征来丰富特征空间，以补充偏标记训练样本中潜在真实标签的判别特性。特别地，我们提出了一个联合优化类别原型和估计偏标记训练样本标注置信度的优化模型，该模型同时强化了特征空间的全局一致性与标签空间的局部一致性。我们证明类别原型和标注置信度可以通过交替优化算法求解。在合成数据集和真实数据集上的大量实验验证了所提方法在提升现有先进偏标记学习算法泛化性能方面的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Partial+Label+Learning+with+Discrimination+Augmentation)|0|
|[An Embedded Feature Selection Framework for Control](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539290)|Jiawen Wei, Fangyuan Wang, Wanxin Zeng, Wenwei Lin, Ning Gui|Cent South Univ, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; Zhejiang Sci Tech Univ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China|Reducing sensor requirements while keeping optimal control performance is crucial to many industrial control applications to achieve robust, low-cost, and computation-efficient controllers. However, existing feature selection solutions for the typical machine learning domain can hardly be applied in the domain of control with changing dynamics. In this paper, a novel framework, namely the Dual-world embedded Attentive Feature Selection (D-AFS), can efficiently select the most relevant sensors for the system under dynamic control. Rather than the one world used in most Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms, D-AFS has both the real world and its virtual peer with twisted features. By analyzing the DRL's response in two worlds, D-AFS can quantitatively identify respective features' importance towards control. A well-known active flow control problem, cylinder drag reduction, is used for evaluation. Results show that D-AFS successfully finds an optimized five-probes layout with 18.7% drag reduction than the state-of-the-art solution with 151 probes and 49.2% reduction than five-probes layout by human experts. We also apply this solution to four OpenAI classical control cases. In all cases, D-AFS achieves the same or better sensor configurations than originally provided solutions. Results highlight, we argued, a new way to achieve efficient and optimal sensor designs for experimental or industrial systems.

|[SagDRE: Sequence-Aware Graph-Based Document-Level Relation Extraction with Adaptive Margin Loss](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539304)|Ying Wei, Qi Li|Iowa State Univ, Ames, IA 50011 USA|Relation extraction (RE) is an important task for many natural language processing applications. Document-level relation extraction task aims to extract the relations within a document and poses many challenges to the RE tasks as it requires reasoning across sentences and handling multiple relations expressed in the same document. Existing state-of-the-art document-level RE models use the graph structure to better connect long-distance correlations. In this work, we propose SagDRE model, which further considers and captures the original sequential information from the text. The proposed model learns sentence-level directional edges to capture the information flow in the document and uses the token-level sequential information to encode the shortest paths from one entity to the other. In addition, we propose an adaptive margin loss to address the long-tailed multi-label problem of document-level RE tasks, where multiple relations can be expressed in a document for an entity pair and there are a few popular relations. The loss function aims to encourage separations between positive and negative classes. The experimental results on datasets from various domains demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.|关系抽取是众多自然语言处理应用中的关键任务。文档级关系抽取旨在提取文档内部的关系，由于需要跨句推理并处理同一文档中表达的多种关系，该任务对关系抽取提出了诸多挑战。当前最先进的文档级关系抽取模型采用图结构来更好地连接长距离关联。本研究提出SagDRE模型，该模型进一步考虑并捕捉文本中的原始序列信息。所提出的模型通过学习句子级有向边来捕获文档中的信息流，并利用词元级序列信息编码实体间的最短路径。此外，针对文档级关系抽取中存在的长尾多标签问题——即同一实体对可能表达多种关系，且存在少数高频关系的现象，我们提出自适应边界损失函数。该损失函数旨在增强正负类别之间的区分度。在多领域数据集上的实验结果验证了所提方法的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=SagDRE:+Sequence-Aware+Graph-Based+Document-Level+Relation+Extraction+with+Adaptive+Margin+Loss)|0|
|[Beyond Point Prediction: Capturing Zero-Inflated & Heavy-Tailed Spatiotemporal Data with Deep Extreme Mixture Models](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539464)|Tyler Wilson, Andrew McDonald, Asadullah Hill Galib, PangNing Tan, Lifeng Luo|Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA|Zero-inflated, heavy-tailed spatiotemporal data is common across science and engineering, from climate science to meteorology and seismology. A central modeling objective in such settings is to forecast the intensity, frequency, and timing of extreme and non-extreme events; yet in the context of deep learning, this objective presents several key challenges. First, a deep learning framework applied to such data must unify a mixture of distributions characterizing the zero events, moderate events, and extreme events. Second, the framework must be capable of enforcing parameter constraints across each component of the mixture distribution. Finally, the framework must be flexible enough to accommodate for any changes in the threshold used to define an extreme event after training. To address these challenges, we propose Deep Extreme Mixture Model (DEMM), fusing a deep learning-based hurdle model with extreme value theory to enable point and distribution prediction of zero-inflated, heavy-tailed spatiotemporal variables. The framework enables users to dynamically set a threshold for defining extreme events at inference-time without the need for retraining. We present an extensive experimental analysis applying DEMM to precipitation forecasting, and observe significant improvements in point and distribution prediction.
