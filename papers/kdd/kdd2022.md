|[Contrastive Cross-domain Recommendation in Matching](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539125)|Ruobing Xie, Qi Liu, Liangdong Wang, Shukai Liu, Bo Zhang, Leyu Lin|WeChat, Tencent, Beijing, China|Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) aims to provide better recommendation results in the target domain with the help of the source domain, which is widely used and explored in real-world systems. However, CDR in the matching (i.e., candidate generation) module struggles with the data sparsity and popularity bias issues in both representation learning and knowledge transfer. In this work, we propose a novel Contrastive Cross-Domain Recommendation (CCDR) framework for CDR in matching. Specifically, we build a huge diversified preference network to capture multiple information reflecting user diverse interests, and design an intra-domain contrastive learning (intra-CL) and three inter-domain contrastive learning (inter-CL) tasks for better representation learning and knowledge transfer. The intra-CL enables more effective and balanced training inside the target domain via a graph augmentation, while the inter-CL builds different types of cross-domain interactions from user, taxonomy, and neighbor aspects. In experiments, CCDR achieves significant improvements on both offline and online evaluations in a real-world system. Currently, we have deployed our CCDR on WeChat Top Stories, affecting plenty of users.

|[Graph-Flashback Network for Next Location Recommendation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539383)|Xuan Rao, Lisi Chen, Yong Liu, Shuo Shang, Bin Yao, Peng Han|Aalborg Univ, Aalborg, Denmark; Nanyang Technol Univ, Singapore, Singapore; Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Chengdu, Peoples R China; Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China|Next Point-of Interest (POI) recommendation plays an important role in location-based applications, which aims to recommend the next POIs to users that they are most likely to visit based on their historical trajectories. Existing methods usually use rich side information, or customized POI graphs to capture the sequential patterns among POIs. However, the graphs only focus on connectivity between POIs. Few studies propose to explicitly learn a weighted POI graph, which could reflect the transition patterns among POIs and show the importance of its different neighbors for each POI. In addition, these approaches simply utilize the user characteristics for personalized POI recommendation without sufficient consideration. To this end, we construct a novel User-POI Knowledge Graph with strong representation ability, called Spatial-Temporal Knowledge Graph (STKG). STKG is used to learn the representations of each node (i.e., user, POI) and each edge. Then, we design a similarity function to construct our POI transition graph based on the learned representations. To incorporate the learned graph into sequential model, we propose a novel network Graph-Flashback for recommendation. Graph-Flashback applies a simplified Graph Convolution Network (GCN) on the POI transition graph to enrich the representation of each POI. Further, we define a similarity function to consider both spatiotemporal information and user preference in modelling sequential regularity. Experimental results on two real-world datasets show that our proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance and significantly outperforms all existing solutions.|下一兴趣点（POI）推荐在基于位置的服务中具有重要作用，其目标是根据用户的历史轨迹推荐最可能访问的下一个POI。现有方法通常使用丰富的辅助信息或定制化POI图来捕捉POI间的序列模式。然而这些图结构仅关注POI间的连通性，目前鲜有研究尝试显式学习加权POI图——这种图既能反映POI间的转移模式，又能展示每个POI不同邻居的重要性。此外，现有方案在个性化POI推荐中未能充分考量用户特征。为此，我们构建了具有强表征能力的用户-兴趣点知识图谱（STKG），该图谱可用于学习每个节点（用户、POI）及边的表征。基于学习到的表征，我们设计了相似度函数构建POI转移图。为了将学习到的图结构融入序列模型，我们提出新型推荐网络Graph-Flashback：该网络在POI转移图上应用简化图卷积网络（GCN）以丰富每个POI的表征，并通过定义融合时空信息与用户偏好的相似度函数来建模序列规律性。在两个真实数据集上的实验表明，所提方法实现了最先进的性能，显著优于所有现有解决方案。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Graph-Flashback+Network+for+Next+Location+Recommendation)|9|
|[Meta-Learned Metrics over Multi-Evolution Temporal Graphs](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539313)|Dongqi Fu, Liri Fang, Ross Maciejewski, Vetle I. Torvik, Jingrui He|Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ USA; Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA|Graph metric learning methods aim to learn the distance metric over graphs such that similar (e.g., same class) graphs are closer and dissimilar (e.g., different class) graphs are farther apart. This is of critical importance in many graph classification applications such as drug discovery and epidemics categorization. Most, if not all, graph metric learning techniques consider the input graph as static, and largely ignore the intrinsic dynamics of temporal graphs. However, in practice, a graph typically has heterogeneous dynamics (e.g., microscopic and macroscopic evolution patterns). As such, labeling a temporal graph is usually expensive and also requires background knowledge. To learn a good metric over temporal graphs, we propose a temporal graph metric learning framework, Temp-GFSM. With only a few labeled temporal graphs, Temp-GFSM outputs a good metric that can accurately classify different temporal graphs and be adapted to discover new subspaces for unseen classes. Each proposed component in Temp-GFSM answers the following questions: What patterns are evolving in a temporal graph? How to weigh these patterns to represent the characteristics of different temporal classes? And how to learn the metric with the guidance from only a few labels? Finally, the experimental results on real-world temporal graph classification tasks from various domains show the effectiveness of our Temp-GFSM.|图度量学习方法旨在学习图结构上的距离度量，使相似（如同类别）图更接近，相异（如不同类别）图更疏远。这在药物发现、疫情分类等图分类应用中具有关键意义。现有绝大多数图度量学习技术将输入图视为静态对象，基本忽略了时序图的内在动态特性。然而实际应用中，图通常具有异构动态特征（如微观和宏观演化模式）。由于时序图标注成本高昂且需要专业知识，为学习有效的时序图度量，我们提出时序图度量学习框架Temp-GFSM。该框架仅需少量标注样本即可学习到优质度量，既能准确分类不同时序图，又能适配未知类别的子空间发现。Temp-GFSM通过三个核心组件分别回答以下问题：时序图中存在何种演化模式？如何加权这些模式以表征不同时序类别的特征？如何通过少量标注指导度量学习？最终在多个领域的真实时序图分类任务上的实验结果验证了Temp-GFSM的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Meta-Learned+Metrics+over+Multi-Evolution+Temporal+Graphs)|9|
|[FLDetector: Defending Federated Learning Against Model Poisoning Attacks via Detecting Malicious Clients](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539231)|Zaixi Zhang, Xiaoyu Cao, Jinyuan Jia, Neil Zhenqiang Gong|Duke Univ, Durham, NC USA; Univ Sci & Technol China, Hefei, Peoples R China|Federated learning (FL) is vulnerable to model poisoning attacks, in which malicious clients corrupt the global model via sending manipulated model updates to the server. Existing defenses mainly rely on Byzantine-robust or provably robust FL methods, which aim to learn an accurate global model even if some clients are malicious. However, they can only resist a small number of malicious clients. It is still an open challenge how to defend against model poisoning attacks with a large number of malicious clients. Our FLDetector addresses this challenge via detecting malicious clients. FLDetector aims to detect and remove the majority of the malicious clients such that a Byzantine-robust or provably robust FL method can learn an accurate global model using the remaining clients. Our key observation is that, in model poisoning attacks,the model updates from a client in multiple iterations are inconsistent. Therefore, FLDetector detects malicious clients via checking their model-updates consistency. Roughly speaking, the server predicts a client's model update in each iteration based on historical model updates and flags a client as malicious if the received model update from the client and the predicted model update are inconsistent in multiple iterations. Our extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that FLDetector can accurately detect malicious clients in multiple state-of-the-art model poisoning attacks and adaptive attacks tailored to FLDetector. After removing the detected malicious clients, existing Byzantine-robust FL methods can learn accurate global models.|联邦学习（FL）易受模型投毒攻击的影响，恶意客户端可通过向服务器发送被篡改的模型更新来破坏全局模型。现有防御方案主要依赖拜占庭鲁棒或可证明鲁棒的联邦学习方法，其目标是在部分客户端恶意的情况下仍能学习准确的全局模型。然而，这些方法仅能抵御少量恶意客户端。如何防御大规模恶意客户端的模型投毒攻击仍是开放挑战。  我们的FLDetector通过检测恶意客户端应对这一挑战。该方案旨在检测并剔除大多数恶意客户端，使得拜占庭鲁棒或可证明鲁棒的联邦学习方法能够基于剩余客户端学习准确的全局模型。我们的核心发现是：在模型投毒攻击中，同一客户端在多轮迭代中的模型更新存在不一致性。因此，FLDetector通过检验客户端模型更新的一致性来检测恶意客户端。简而言之，服务器会根据历史模型更新预测客户端在每轮迭代中的模型更新，若某客户端多次出现接收到的模型更新与预测更新不一致的情况，则将其标记为恶意客户端。  我们在三个基准数据集上的大量实验表明，FLDetector能精准检测多种最先进模型投毒攻击及针对其设计的自适应攻击中的恶意客户端。在清除被检测出的恶意客户端后，现有拜占庭鲁棒联邦学习方法能够学习出准确的全局模型。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=FLDetector:+Defending+Federated+Learning+Against+Model+Poisoning+Attacks+via+Detecting+Malicious+Clients)|8|
|[Surrogate for Long-Term User Experience in Recommender Systems](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539073)|Yuyan Wang, Mohit Sharma, Can Xu, Sriraj Badam, Qian Sun, Lee Richardson, Lisa Chung, Ed H. Chi, Minmin Chen|Google, Mountain View, CA, USA; Google Research, Brain Team, Mountain View, CA, USA|Over the years we have seen recommender systems shifting focus from optimizing short-term engagement toward improving long-term user experience on the platforms. While defining good long-term user experience is still an active research area, we focus on one specific aspect of improved long-term user experience here, which is user revisiting the platform. These long term outcomes however are much harder to optimize due to the sparsity in observing these events and low signal-to-noise ratio (weak connection) between these long-term outcomes and a single recommendation. To address these challenges, we propose to establish the association between these long-term outcomes and a set of more immediate term user behavior signals that can serve as surrogates for optimization. To this end, we conduct a large-scale study of user behavior logs on one of the largest industrial recommendation platforms serving billions of users. We study a broad set of sequential user behavior patterns and standardize a procedure to pinpoint the subset that has strong predictive power of the change in users' long-term visiting frequency. Specifically, they are predictive of users' increased visiting to the platform in $5$ months among the group of users with the same visiting frequency to begin with. We validate the identified subset of user behaviors by incorporating them as reward surrogates for long-term user experience in a reinforcement learning (RL) based recommender. Results from multiple live experiments on the industrial recommendation platform demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed set of surrogates in improving long-term user experience.|多年来，我们已经看到推荐系统的重点从优化短期参与转向改善平台上的长期用户体验。虽然定义良好的长期用户体验仍然是一个活跃的研究领域，我们在这里重点关注改善长期用户体验的一个具体方面，即用户重新访问平台。然而，这些长期结果更难优化，因为观察这些事件的信噪比很少，而且这些长期结果与单一建议之间的联系很弱。为了应对这些挑战，我们建议在这些长期结果和一组更直接的用户行为信号之间建立联系，这些信号可以作为优化的替代品。为此，我们在为数十亿用户服务的最大的工业推荐平台之一上，对用户行为日志进行了大规模的研究。我们研究了一组广泛的顺序用户行为模式，并标准化了一个过程，以确定子集有强大的预测能力的变化，用户的长期访问频率。具体来说，他们预测用户访问该平台的次数将在5美元一个月内增加，而且访问频率从一开始就相同。我们通过将已识别的用户行为子集作为基于强化学习(RL)的推荐系统中长期用户体验的奖励替代品来验证它们。在工业推荐平台上的多个现场实验结果证明了所提出的替代品集在改善长期用户体验方面的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Surrogate+for+Long-Term+User+Experience+in+Recommender+Systems)|7|
|[Multi-modal Siamese Network for Entity Alignment](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539244)|Liyi Chen, Zhi Li, Tong Xu, Han Wu, Zhefeng Wang, Nicholas Jing Yuan, Enhong Chen|Univ Sci & Technol China, State Key Lab Cognit Intelligence, Hefei, Peoples R China; Tsinghua Univ, Shenzhen Int Grad Sch, Beijing, Peoples R China; Huawei Cloud, Shenzhen, Peoples R China|The booming of multi-modal knowledge graphs (MMKGs) has raised the imperative demand for multi-modal entity alignment techniques, which facilitate the integration of multiple MMKGs from separate data sources. Unfortunately, prior arts harness multi-modal knowledge only via the heuristic merging of uni-modal feature embeddings. Therefore, inter-modal cues concealed in multi-modal knowledge could be largely ignored. To deal with that problem, in this paper, we propose a novel Multi-modal Siamese Network for Entity Alignment (MSNEA) to align entities in different MMKGs, in which multi-modal knowledge could be comprehensively leveraged by the exploitation of inter-modal effect. Specifically, we first devise a multi-modal knowledge embedding module to extract visual, relational, and attribute features of entities to generate holistic entity representations for distinct MMKGs. During this procedure, we employ inter-modal enhancement mechanisms to integrate visual features to guide relational feature learning and adaptively assign attention weights to capture valuable attributes for alignment. Afterwards, we design a multi-modal contrastive learning module to achieve inter-modal enhancement fusion with avoiding the overwhelming impact of weak modalities. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that our proposed MSNEA provides state-of-the-art performance with a large margin compared with competitive baselines.|多模态知识图谱(MMKG)的蓬勃发展催生了对多模态实体对齐技术的迫切需求，该技术有助于整合来自不同数据源的多个MMKG。现有方法仅通过单模态特征嵌入的启发式融合来利用多模态知识，导致多模态知识中隐含的模态间关联线索被大量忽略。针对这一问题，本文提出新型多模态孪生网络对齐模型(MSNEA)，通过挖掘模态间相互作用实现多模态知识的全面利用，以对齐不同MMKG中的实体。具体而言，我们首先设计多模态知识嵌入模块，提取实体的视觉、关系和属性特征，为不同MMKG生成整体实体表示。在此过程中，采用模态间增强机制整合视觉特征以指导关系特征学习，并自适应分配注意力权重以捕获有价值的对齐属性。随后设计多模态对比学习模块，在避免弱模态主导影响的前提下实现模态间增强融合。在两个公开数据集上的实验结果表明，与具有竞争力的基线方法相比，我们提出的MSNEA模型以显著优势实现了最先进的性能表现。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Multi-modal+Siamese+Network+for+Entity+Alignment)|7|
|[GraphMAE: Self-Supervised Masked Graph Autoencoders](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539321)|Zhenyu Hou, Xiao Liu, Yukuo Cen, Yuxiao Dong, Hongxia Yang, Chunjie Wang, Jie Tang|Alibaba Grp, DAMO Acad, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; BirenTech Res, Beijing, Peoples R China|Self-supervised learning (SSL) has been extensively explored in recent years. Particularly, generative SSL has seen emerging success in natural language processing and other fields, such as the wide adoption of BERT and GPT. Despite this, contrastive learning---which heavily relies on structural data augmentation and complicated training strategies---has been the dominant approach in graph SSL, while the progress of generative SSL on graphs, especially graph autoencoders (GAEs), has thus far not reached the potential as promised in other fields. In this paper, we identify and examine the issues that negatively impact the development of GAEs, including their reconstruction objective, training robustness, and error metric. We present a masked graph autoencoder GraphMAE (code is publicly available at https://github.com/THUDM/GraphMAE) that mitigates these issues for generative self-supervised graph learning. Instead of reconstructing structures, we propose to focus on feature reconstruction with both a masking strategy and scaled cosine error that benefit the robust training of GraphMAE. We conduct extensive experiments on 21 public datasets for three different graph learning tasks. The results manifest that GraphMAE---a simple graph autoencoder with our careful designs---can consistently generate outperformance over both contrastive and generative state-of-the-art baselines. This study provides an understanding of graph autoencoders and demonstrates the potential of generative self-supervised learning on graphs.|近年来，自监督学习（SSL）得到广泛探索。其中，生成式自监督学习在自然语言处理等领域取得突破性进展，以BERT和GPT为代表的模型获得大规模应用。然而在图自监督学习领域，尽管对比学习——一种严重依赖结构化数据增强和复杂训练策略的方法——仍占据主导地位，但生成式方法（尤其是图自编码器GAEs）的发展尚未展现出其他领域所呈现的潜力。本文系统性地研究了制约图自编码器发展的关键问题，包括重建目标、训练鲁棒性和误差度量等方面，进而提出掩码图自编码器GraphMAE（代码开源地址：https://github.com/THUDM/GraphMAE）。该模型通过掩码策略和缩放余弦误差相结合的方式，将重建重点从结构重构转向特征重构，有效增强了训练鲁棒性。我们在21个公共数据集上针对三项图学习任务开展广泛实验，结果表明：采用精心设计的简单图自编码器GraphMAE，能够持续超越当前最先进的对比学习和生成式基线模型。本研究深化了对图自编码器的理解，并揭示了生成式自监督学习在图结构数据领域的巨大潜力。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=GraphMAE:+Self-Supervised+Masked+Graph+Autoencoders)|7|
|[MSDR: Multi-Step Dependency Relation Networks for Spatial Temporal Forecasting](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539397)|Dachuan Liu, Jin Wang, Shuo Shang, Peng Han|Aalborg Univ, Aalborg, Denmark; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA; Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Chengdu, Peoples R China|Spatial temporal forecasting plays an important role in improving the quality and performance of Intelligent Transportation Systems. This task is rather challenging due to the complicated and long-range spatial temporal dependencies in traffic network. Existing studies typically employ different deep neural networks to learn the spatial and temporal representations so as to capture the complex and dynamic dependencies. In this paper, we argue that it is insufficient to capture the long-range spatial dependencies from the implicit representations learned by temporal extracting modules. To address this problem, we propose Multi-Step Dependency Relation (MSDR), a brand new variant of recurrent neural network. Instead of only looking at the hidden state from only one latest time step, MSDR explicitly takes those of multiple historical time steps as the input of each time unit. We also develop two strategies to incur the spatial information into the dependency relation embedding between multiple historical time steps and the current one in MSDR. On the basis of it, we propose the Graph-based MSDR (GMSDR) framework to support general spatial temporal forecasting applications by seamlessly integrating graph-based neural networks with MSDR. We evaluate our proposed approach on several popular datasets. The results show that the proposed GMSDR framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an obvious margin.|时空预测对提升智能交通系统的运行质量与性能具有重要作用。由于交通网络中存在着复杂的长程时空依赖性，该任务极具挑战性。现有研究通常采用不同深度神经网络学习时空表征，以捕捉复杂动态的依赖关系。本文指出，仅通过时序提取模块学习的隐式表征不足以有效捕获长程空间依赖性。为此，我们提出多步依赖关系（MSDR）——循环神经网络的全新变体。该模型突破传统单步隐藏状态输入模式，将多个历史时间步的隐藏状态同时作为每个时间单元的显式输入。我们还开发了两种策略，将空间信息嵌入到多个历史时间步与当前时间步的依赖关系中。在此基础上，提出基于图的MSDR框架（GMSDR），通过将图神经网络与MSDR无缝集成，为通用时空预测应用提供支持。在多个主流数据集上的实验表明，GMSDR框架以显著优势超越现有最先进方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=MSDR:+Multi-Step+Dependency+Relation+Networks+for+Spatial+Temporal+Forecasting)|7|
|[Joint Knowledge Graph Completion and Question Answering](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539289)|Lihui Liu, Boxin Du, Jiejun Xu, Yinglong Xia, Hanghang Tong|HRL Labs, Malibu, CA USA; Meta AI, Menlo Pk, CA USA; Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA|Knowledge graph reasoning plays a pivotal role in many real-world applications, such as network alignment, computational fact-checking, recommendation, and many more. Among these applications, knowledge graph completion (KGC) and multi-hop question answering over knowledge graph (Multi-hop KGQA) are two representative reasoning tasks. In the vast majority of the existing works, the two tasks are considered separately with different models or algorithms. However, we envision that KGC and Multi-hop KGQA are closely related to each other. Therefore, the two tasks will benefit from each other if they are approached adequately. In this work, we propose a neural model named BiNet to jointly handle KGC and multi-hop KGQA, and formulate it as a multi-task learning problem. Specifically, our proposed model leverages a shared embedding space and an answer scoring module, which allows the two tasks to automatically share latent features and learn the interactions between natural language question decoder and answer scoring module. Compared to the existing methods, the proposed BiNet model addresses both multi-hop KGQA and KGC tasks simultaneously with superior performance. Experiment results show that BiNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a wide range of KGQA and KGC benchmark datasets.|知识图谱推理在网络对齐、计算性事实核查、推荐系统等诸多实际应用中具有关键作用。其中，知识图谱补全（KGC）与基于知识图谱的多跳问答（Multi-hop KGQA）是两项具有代表性的推理任务。现有研究大多采用不同模型或算法分别处理这两个任务，但我们认为KGC与多跳KGQA具有紧密的内在关联。若采用恰当方法，二者可实现相互促进。本研究提出名为BiNet的神经网络模型，通过多任务学习框架联合处理KGC与多跳KGQA任务。具体而言，该模型利用共享嵌入空间和答案评分模块，使两个任务能够自动共享潜在特征，并实现自然语言问题解码器与答案评分模块的交互学习。与现有方法相比，BiNet模型能同时处理多跳KGQA和KGC任务且性能更优。实验结果表明，BiNet在多个KGQA和KGC基准数据集上均超越了现有最优方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Joint+Knowledge+Graph+Completion+and+Question+Answering)|7|

However, it is challenging to learn the joint representations from the multimodal data, model the relationship between modalities, and, more importantly, incorporate the vast amount of single-modality datasets into the downstream analyses. To address these challenges and correspondingly facilitate multimodal single-cell data analyses, three key tasks have been introduced: Modality prediction, Modality matching andJoint embedding. In this work, we present a general Graph Neural Network framework scMoGNN to tackle these three tasks and show that scMoGNN demonstrates superior results in all three tasks compared with the state-of-the-art and conventional approaches. Our method is an official winner in the overall ranking ofModality prediction from NeurIPS 2021 Competition (https://openproblems.bio/neurips_2021/), and all implementations of our methods have been integrated into DANCE package (https://github.com/OmicsML/dance).|近年来，多模态单细胞技术的突破使得从同一细胞中同步获取多组学数据成为可能，这为解析细胞状态与动态过程提供了更深入的视角。然而，如何从多模态数据中学习联合表征、建模模态间关系，以及将海量单模态数据集有效整合至下游分析仍存在挑战。为应对这些问题并推动多模态单细胞数据分析的发展，学界提出了三项核心任务：模态预测、模态匹配与联合嵌入。本研究提出通用图神经网络框架scMoGNN，可同时解决这三类任务，并在与前沿方法和传统方法的对比中展现出全面优势。我们的方法在NeurIPS 2021"开放问题"竞赛的模态预测总榜中荣获官方优胜（https://openproblems.bio/neurips_2021/），所有实现代码已集成至DANCE工具包（https://github.com/OmicsML/dance）。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Graph+Neural+Networks+for+Multimodal+Single-Cell+Data+Integration)|7|
|[Multi-Behavior Hypergraph-Enhanced Transformer for Sequential Recommendation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539342)|Yuhao Yang, Chao Huang, Lianghao Xia, Yuxuan Liang, Yanwei Yu, Chenliang Li|Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China; Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China|Learning dynamic user preference has become an increasingly important component for many online platforms (e.g., video-sharing sites, e-commerce systems) to make sequential recommendations. Previous works have made many efforts to model item-item transitions over user interaction sequences, based on various architectures, e.g., recurrent neural networks and self-attention mechanism. Recently emerged graph neural networks also serve as useful backbone models to capture item dependencies in sequential recommendation scenarios. Despite their effectiveness, existing methods have far focused on item sequence representation with singular type of interactions, and thus are limited to capture dynamic heterogeneous relational structures between users and items (e.g., page view, add-to-favorite, purchase). To tackle this challenge, we design a Multi-Behavior Hypergraph-enhanced T ransformer framework (MBHT) to capture both short-term and long-term cross-type behavior dependencies. Specifically, a multi-scale Transformer is equipped with low-rank self-attention to jointly encode behavior-aware sequential patterns from fine-grained and coarse-grained levels. Additionally,we incorporate the global multi-behavior dependency into the hypergraph neural architecture to capture the hierarchical long-range item correlations in a customized manner. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our MBHT over various state-of- the-art recommendation solutions across different settings. Further ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our model design and benefits of the new MBHT framework. Our implementation code is released at: https://github.com/yuh-yang/MBHT-KDD22.|学习动态用户偏好已经成为许多在线平台(如视频分享网站、电子商务系统)提供顺序推荐的一个越来越重要的组成部分。以往的研究基于多种体系结构，如递归神经网络和自我注意机制，对用户交互序列上的项目-项目转换进行了大量的研究。最近出现的图形神经网络也可以作为有用的骨干模型，以捕获项目依赖的顺序推荐场景。尽管现有的方法很有效，但是现有的方法都集中在单一交互类型的项目序列表示上，因此仅限于捕获用户和项目之间的动态异构关系结构(例如，页面查看、添加到收藏夹、购买)。为了应对这一挑战，我们设计了一个多行为超图增强型 T 变换器框架(MBHT)来捕获短期和长期的跨类型行为依赖。具体而言，多尺度变压器配备低级自注意，以从细粒度和粗粒度级别联合编码行为感知的序列模式。此外，我们将全局多行为依赖引入到超图神经结构中，以自定义的方式获取层次化的远程项目相关性。实验结果表明，我们的 MBHT 优于不同设置的各种最先进的推荐解决方案。进一步的消融研究验证了我们的模型设计的有效性和新的 MBHT 框架的好处。我们的实施代码在以下 https://github.com/yuh-yang/mbht-kdd22发布:。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Multi-Behavior+Hypergraph-Enhanced+Transformer+for+Sequential+Recommendation)|6|

Recently, Transformer-based models prevail in time series forecasting due to their advancement in long-range dependencies learning. Besides, some models introduce series decomposition to further unveil reliable yet plain temporal dependencies. Unfortunately, few models could handle complicated periodical patterns, such as multiple periods, variable periods, and phase shifts in real-world datasets. Meanwhile, the notorious quadratic complexity of dot-product attentions hampers long sequence modeling. To address these challenges, we design an innovative framework Quaternion Transformer (Quatformer), along with three major components: 1). learning-to-rotate attention (LRA) based on quaternions which introduces learnable period and phase information to depict intricate periodical patterns. 2). trend normalization to normalize the series representations in hidden layers of the model considering the slowly varying characteristic of trend. 3). decoupling LRA using global memory to achieve linear complexity without losing prediction accuracy. We evaluate our framework on multiple real-world time series datasets and observe an average 8.1% and up to 18.5% MSE improvement over the best state-of-the-art baseline.|时间序列预测是众多实际应用中的关键且具有挑战性的问题。近年来，基于Transformer的模型因其在长程依赖学习方面的优势，在时间序列预测领域占据主导地位。此外，一些模型通过引入序列分解技术进一步揭示了可靠而简洁的时序依赖关系。然而，现有模型难以有效处理现实数据集中复杂的周期性模式，如多重周期、可变周期和相位偏移等问题。同时，点积注意力机制著名的二次计算复杂度也阻碍了长序列建模能力。为解决这些挑战，我们设计了一个创新框架——四元数Transformer（Quatformer），其包含三大核心组件：1）基于四元数的可学习旋转注意力机制（LRA），通过引入可学习的周期和相位参数来刻画复杂周期性模式；2）考虑趋势项缓慢变化特性的趋势归一化方法，对模型隐藏层的序列表示进行标准化处理；3）采用全局记忆的解耦LRA机制，在保持预测精度的同时实现线性计算复杂度。我们在多个真实世界时间序列数据集上进行评估，结果表明该框架相比最佳基线模型平均提升8.1%的MSE指标，最高提升幅度达18.5%。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Learning+to+Rotate:+Quaternion+Transformer+for+Complicated+Periodical+Time+Series+Forecasting)|6|

However, federated graph learning (FGL), even though graph data are prevalent, has not been well supported due to its unique characteristics and requirements. The lack of FGL-related framework increases the efforts for accomplishing reproducible research and deploying in real-world applications. Motivated by such strong demand, in this paper, we first discuss the challenges in creating an easy-to-use FGL package and accordingly present our implemented package FederatedScope-GNN (FS-G), which provides (1) a unified view for modularizing and expressing FGL algorithms; (2) comprehensive DataZoo and ModelZoo for out-of-the-box FGL capability; (3) an efficient model auto-tuning component; and (4) off-the-shelf privacy attack and defense abilities. We validate the effectiveness of FS-G by conducting extensive experiments, which simultaneously gains many valuable insights about FGL for the community. Moreover, we employ FS-G to serve the FGL application in real-world E-commerce scenarios, where the attained improvements indicate great potential business benefits. We publicly release FS-G, as submodules of FederatedScope, at https://github.com/alibaba/FederatedScope to promote FGL's research and enable broad applications that would otherwise be infeasible due to the lack of a dedicated package.|联邦学习（FL）的迅猛发展已惠及计算机视觉与自然语言处理领域的多项任务，TFF、FATE等现有框架更使其在实际应用中的部署变得轻松。然而尽管图数据无处不在，联邦图学习（FGL）因其独特特性与需求尚未获得完善支持。FGL专用框架的缺失增加了实现可复现研究和实际应用部署的难度。基于这一迫切需求，本文首次系统论述构建易用FGL工具包面临的挑战，进而推出我们实现的联邦图学习平台FederatedScope-GNN（FS-G）。该平台具备四大核心功能：（1）提供模块化表达FGL算法的统一视图；（2）内置涵盖丰富数据集与模型的DataZoo和ModelZoo，实现开箱即用的FGL能力；（3）集成高效模型自动调优组件；（4）提供即插即用的隐私攻击与防御能力。通过大量实验验证，我们证明FS-G能有效支撑FGL研究，并为学界提供了关于联邦图学习的多维度洞察。此外，我们成功将FS-G应用于电商场景的联邦图学习实践，实测效果表明其具有显著商业价值。我们已将FS-G作为FederatedScope的子模块开源发布於https://github.com/alibaba/FederatedScope，旨在推动联邦图学习研究发展，并为因缺乏专用工具包而受阻的广泛应用铺平道路。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=FederatedScope-GNN:+Towards+a+Unified,+Comprehensive+and+Efficient+Package+for+Federated+Graph+Learning)|6|
|[CrossCBR: Cross-view Contrastive Learning for Bundle Recommendation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539229)|Yunshan Ma, Yingzhi He, An Zhang, Xiang Wang, TatSeng Chua|Sea NExT Joint Lab, Galaxis, Singapore; Univ Sci & Technol China, Hefei, Peoples R China|Bundle recommendation aims to recommend a bundle of related items to users, which can satisfy the users' various needs with one-stop convenience. Recent methods usually take advantage of both user-bundle and user-item interactions information to obtain informative representations for users and bundles, corresponding to bundle view and item view, respectively. However, they either use a unified view without differentiation or loosely combine the predictions of two separate views, while the crucial cooperative association between the two views' representations is overlooked. In this work, we propose to model the cooperative association between the two different views through cross-view contrastive learning. By encouraging the alignment of the two separately learned views, each view can distill complementary information from the other view, achieving mutual enhancement. Moreover, by enlarging the dispersion of different users/bundles, the self-discrimination of representations is enhanced. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms SOTA baselines by a large margin. Meanwhile, our method requires minimal parameters of three set of embeddings (user, bundle, and item) and the computational costs are largely reduced due to more concise graph structure and graph learning module. In addition, various ablation and model studies demystify the working mechanism and justify our hypothesis.

In recent years, graph neural networks have emerged as a prevalent paradigm of learning with structured data. However, most brain network datasets are limited in sample sizes due to the relatively high cost of data acquisition, which hinders the deep learning models from sufficient training. Inspired by meta-learning that learns new concepts fast with limited training examples, this paper studies data-efficient training strategies for analyzing brain connectomes in a cross-dataset setting. Specifically, we propose to meta-train the model on datasets of large sample sizes and transfer the knowledge to small datasets. In addition, we also explore two brain-network-oriented designs, including atlas transformation and adaptive task reweighing.

Zuluaga, Eamonn J. Keogh||Time series anomaly detection remains one of the most active areas of research in data mining. In spite of the dozens of creative solutions proposed for this problem, recent empirical evidence suggests that time series discords, a relatively simple twenty-year old distance-based technique, remains among the state-of-art techniques. While there are many algorithms for computing the time series discords, they all have limitations. First, they are limited to the batch case, whereas the online case is more actionable. Second, these algorithms exhibit poor scalability beyond tens of thousands of datapoints. In this work we introduce DAMP, a novel algorithm that addresses both these issues. DAMP computes exact left-discords on fast arriving streams, at up to 300,000 Hz using a commodity desktop. This allows us to find time series discords in datasets with trillions of datapoints for the first time. We will demonstrate the utility of our algorithm with the most ambitious set of time series anomaly detection experiments ever conducted.|时间序列异常检测一直是数据挖掘领域中最活跃的研究方向之一。尽管已有数十种创新性解决方案被提出，但近期实证研究表明，时间序列不和谐模式——一种相对简单、具有二十年历史的基于距离的技术——仍处于最先进技术行列。尽管存在多种计算时间序列不和谐模式的算法，但它们都存在局限性：首先，这些算法仅限于批处理场景，而在线检测场景更具可操作性；其次，这些算法在超过数万个数据点时的可扩展性表现不佳。本研究提出新型算法DAMP，可同时解决这两个问题。DAMP能在普通台式计算机上以最高30万赫兹的频率，对快速到达的数据流进行精确左向不和谐模式检测。这使我们首次能够在具有数万亿数据点的数据集中发现时间序列不和谐模式。我们将通过执行迄今最雄心勃勃的时间序列异常检测实验集，来证明该算法的实用价值。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Matrix+Profile+XXIV:+Scaling+Time+Series+Anomaly+Detection+to+Trillions+of+Datapoints+and+Ultra-fast+Arriving+Data+Streams)|5|
|[ROLAND: Graph Learning Framework for Dynamic Graphs](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539300)|Jiaxuan You, Tianyu Du, Jure Leskovec|Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA|Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successfully applied to many real-world static graphs. However, the success of static graphs has not fully translated to dynamic graphs due to the limitations in model design, evaluation settings, and training strategies. Concretely, existing dynamic GNNs do not incorporate state-of-the-art designs from static GNNs, which limits their performance. Current evaluation settings for dynamic GNNs do not fully reflect the evolving nature of dynamic graphs. Finally, commonly used training methods for dynamic GNNs are not scalable. Here we propose ROLAND, an effective graph representation learning framework for real-world dynamic graphs. At its core, the ROLAND framework can help researchers easily repurpose any static GNN to dynamic graphs. Our insight is to view the node embeddings at different GNN layers as hierarchical node states and then recurrently update them over time. We then introduce a live-update evaluation setting for dynamic graphs that mimics real-world use cases, where GNNs are making predictions and being updated on a rolling basis. Finally, we propose a scalable and efficient training approach for dynamic GNNs via incremental training and meta-learning. We conduct experiments over eight different dynamic graph datasets on future link prediction tasks. Models built using the ROLAND framework achieve on average 62.7% relative mean reciprocal rank (MRR) improvement over state-of-the-art baselines under the standard evaluation settings on three datasets. We find state-of-the-art baselines experience out-of-memory errors for larger datasets, while ROLAND can easily scale to dynamic graphs with 56 million edges. After re-implementing these baselines using the ROLAND training strategy, ROLAND models still achieve on average 15.5% relative MRR improvement over the baselines.|图神经网络（GNN）已在诸多实际应用的静态图上取得显著成功，但受限于模型设计、评估机制与训练策略，其在动态图领域的成功尚未完全复现。具体而言，现有动态GNN未能融合静态GNN的前沿设计，导致性能受限；当前动态GNN评估方案未能充分体现动态图的演化特性；而常用的动态GNN训练方法存在可扩展性不足的问题。本文提出ROLAND——一个面向真实动态图场景的高效图表示学习框架。该框架的核心价值在于帮助研究者将任意静态GNN适配至动态图环境。我们的核心思路是将不同GNN层生成的节点嵌入视作层次化节点状态，并随时间推移进行循环更新。同时，我们创新性地引入了贴合实际应用场景的动态图实时评估机制，模拟GNN在滚动基础上持续进行预测与模型更新的真实使用情境。此外，通过增量训练与元学习技术，我们提出了可扩展的高效动态GNN训练方案。基于八个动态图数据集的未来链接预测实验表明：在三个数据集的标准评估环境下，采用ROLAND框架构建的模型相较现有最优基线模型实现了62.7%的平均相对平均倒数排名（MRR）提升。当处理包含5600万条边的大规模动态图时，现有最优基线方法出现内存溢出，而ROLAND仍能保持高效运行。即使通过ROLAND训练策略重新实现这些基线方法，ROLAND模型仍能保持15.5%的平均相对MRR优势。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=ROLAND:+Graph+Learning+Framework+for+Dynamic+Graphs)|5|

To tackle this challenge, this work proposes a M ultiplex H eterogeneous G raph C onvolutional N etwork (MHGCN+) for multiplex heterogeneous network embedding. Our MHGCN+ can automatically learn the useful heterogeneous meta-path interactions of different lengths with different importance in multiplex heterogeneous networks through multi-layer convolution aggregation. Additionally, we effectively integrate both multi-relation structural signals and attribute semantics into the learned node embeddings with both unsupervised and semi-supervised learning paradigms. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets with various network analytical tasks demonstrate the significant superiority of MHGCN+ against state-of-the-art embedding baselines in terms of all evaluation metrics.

The mainstream RS ranking framework is composed of two parts: a Multi-Task Learning model (MTL) that predicts various user feedback, i.e., clicks, likes, sharings, and a Multi-Task Fusion model (MTF) that combines the multi-task outputs into one final ranking score with respect to user satisfaction. There has not been much research on the fusion model while it has great impact on the final recommendation as the last crucial process of the ranking. To optimize long-term user satisfaction rather than obtain instant returns greedily, we formulate MTF task as Markov Decision Process (MDP) within a recommendation session and propose a Batch Reinforcement Learning (RL) based Multi-Task Fusion framework (BatchRL-MTF) that includes a Batch RL framework and an online exploration. The former exploits Batch RL to learn an optimal recommendation policy from the fixed batch data offline for long-term user satisfaction, while the latter explores potential high-value actions online to break through the local optimal dilemma. With a comprehensive investigation on user behaviors, we model the user satisfaction reward with subtle heuristics from two aspects of user stickiness and user activeness. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on a billion-sample level real-world dataset to show the effectiveness of our model. We propose a conservative offline policy estimator (Conservative-OPEstimator) to test our model offline. Furthermore, we take online experiments in a real recommendation environment to compare performance of different models. As one of few Batch RL researches applied in MTF task successfully, our model has also been deployed on a large-scale industrial short video platform, serving hundreds of millions of users.|推荐系统(RS)是一个重要的在线应用程序，每天影响数十亿用户。RS 的主流排名框架由两部分组成: 一个是多任务学习模型(Multi-Task Learning model，MTL) ，它预测用户的各种反馈，即点击、喜欢、分享; 另一个是多任务融合模型(Multi-Task Fusion model，MTF) ，它将多任务输出结合成一个用户满意度的最终排名得分。融合模型作为排名的最后一个关键过程，对最终推荐有着重要的影响。为了优化长期用户满意度，而不是贪婪地获得即时回报，我们在一个推荐会话中将 MTF 任务制定为马可夫决策过程(mDP) ，并提出了一个基于批处理强化学习(RL)的多任务融合框架(BatchRL-MTF) ，其中包括一个批处理强化学习框架和一个在线探索。前者利用批量 RL 从离线的固定批量数据中学习最优推荐策略以获得长期用户满意度，后者利用在线的潜在高价值行为来突破局部最优困境。通过对用户行为的全面调查，从用户粘性和用户主动性两个方面采用微妙的启发式方法建立了用户满意奖励模型。最后，我们在十亿个样本级别的真实世界数据集上进行了广泛的实验，以显示我们的模型的有效性。我们提出了一个保守的离线策略估计(保守-最优估计)来测试我们的模型离线。此外，我们在一个真实的推荐环境中进行在线实验，比较不同模型的性能。作为少数几个成功应用于 MTF 任务的批量 RL 研究之一，我们的模型也已经部署在一个大型工业短视频平台上，为数亿用户服务。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Multi-Task+Fusion+via+Reinforcement+Learning+for+Long-Term+User+Satisfaction+in+Recommender+Systems)|4|

The framework consists of two major modules, namely disentangled attention encoder (DAE) and self-balanced multi-aspect ranker. In DAE, we use multi-head attention to learn disentangled aspects from rich item features. In the ranker, we develop an aspect-specific ranking mechanism that is able to adaptively balance the relevance and diversity for each aspect. In experiments, we conduct offline evaluation on the collected dataset and deploy FDSB on KuaiShou app for online ??/?? test on the function of relevant recommendation. The significant improvements on both recommendation quality and user experience verify the effectiveness of our approach.|相关推荐是一种特殊的推荐场景，当用户对一个目标项目表示兴趣时(例如，点击、喜欢和购买) ，它会提供相关的项目。除了考虑建议与触发项目之间的相关性之外，建议还应当多样化，以避免信息茧。然而，现有的多样化推荐方法主要侧重于项目层次的多样性，当推荐项目都与目标项目相关时，这种多样性是不够的。此外，冗余或嘈杂的项目特征可能会影响简单的特征感知推荐方法的性能。针对这些问题，我们提出了一种特征分离自平衡重排框架(FDSB)来捕获特征感知的多样性。该框架包括两个主要模块，即分离注意编码器(DAE)和自平衡多方面排序器。在 DAE 中，我们使用多头注意从丰富的项目特征中学习分离的方面。在排名中，我们开发了一个方面特定的排名机制，能够自适应地平衡每个方面的相关性和多样性。在实验中，我们对收集到的数据集进行离线评估，并在快手应用上部署 FDSB 以实现在线? ? ？/?？检验有关推荐的作用。在推荐质量和用户体验方面的重大改进验证了我们方法的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Feature-aware+Diversified+Re-ranking+with+Disentangled+Representations+for+Relevant+Recommendation)|4|
|[Counteracting User Attention Bias in Music Streaming Recommendation via Reward Modification](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539393)|Xiao Zhang, Sunhao Dai, Jun Xu, Zhenhua Dong, Quanyu Dai, JiRong Wen|Renmin University of China, Beijing, China; Huawei Noah's Ark Lab, Shenzhen, China|In streaming media applications, like music Apps, songs are recommended in a continuous way in users' daily life. The recommended songs are played automatically although users may not pay any attention to them, posing a challenge of user attention bias in training recommendation models, i.e., the training instances contain a large number of false-positive labels (users' feedback). Existing approaches either directly use the auto-feedbacks or heuristically delete the potential false-positive labels. Both of the approaches lead to biased results because the false-positive labels cause the shift of training data distribution, hurting the accuracy of the recommendation models. In this paper, we propose a learning-based counterfactual approach to adjusting the user auto-feedbacks and learning the recommendation models using Neural Dueling Bandit algorithm, called NDB. Specifically, NDB maintains two neural networks: a user attention network for computing the importance weights that are used for modifying the original rewards, and another random network trained with dueling bandit for conducting online recommendations based on the modified rewards. Theoretical analysis showed that the modified rewards are statistically unbiased, and the learned bandit policy enjoys a sub-linear regret bound. Experimental results demonstrated that NDB can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art baselines.|在流媒体应用程序中，比如音乐应用程序，歌曲被持续推荐到用户的日常生活中。虽然用户可能没有注意到这些歌曲，但推荐的歌曲会自动播放，这对训练推荐模型中的用户注意偏差提出了挑战，即训练实例中包含大量假阳性标签(用户反馈)。现有的方法要么直接使用自动反馈，要么启发性地删除潜在的假阳性标签。这两种方法都会导致结果偏差，因为假阳性标签会引起训练数据分布的变化，从而影响推荐模型的准确性。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于学习的反事实方法来调整用户自动反馈和学习推荐模型的神经决斗盗贼算法，称为 NDB。具体来说，新开发银行维护两个神经网络: 一个是用户注意力网络，用于计算用于修改原始奖励的重要性权重，另一个是与决斗强盗一起训练的随机网络，用于根据修改后的奖励进行在线推荐。理论分析表明，修正后的奖励具有统计上的无偏性，学会的土匪政策具有亚线性后悔界限。实验结果表明，新数据库的性能明显优于最先进的基线。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Counteracting+User+Attention+Bias+in+Music+Streaming+Recommendation+via+Reward+Modification)|4|

Due to the security and privacy concerns, it is more practical to perform adversarial attacks under the black-box setting, where the architecture/parameters and training data of target systems cannot be easily accessed by attackers. However, generating high-quality fake user profiles under black-box setting is rather challenging with limited resources to target systems. To address this challenge, in this work, we introduce a novel strategy by leveraging items' attribute information (i.e., items' knowledge graph), which can be publicly accessible and provide rich auxiliary knowledge to enhance the generation of fake user profiles. More specifically, we propose a knowledge graph-enhanced black-box attacking framework (KGAttack) to effectively learn attacking policies through deep reinforcement learning techniques, in which knowledge graph is seamlessly integrated into hierarchical policy networks to generate fake user profiles for performing adversarial black-box attacks.

Most existing SRL methods rely on explicit item IDs for developing the sequence models to better capture user preference. Though effective to some extent, these methods are difficult to be transferred to new recommendation scenarios, due to the limitation by explicitly modeling item IDs. To tackle this issue, we present a novel universal sequence representation learning approach, named UniSRec. The proposed approach utilizes the associated description text of items to learn transferable representations across different recommendation scenarios. For learning universal item representations, we design a lightweight item encoding architecture based on parametric whitening and mixture-of-experts enhanced adaptor. For learning universal sequence representations, we introduce two contrastive pre-training tasks by sampling multi-domain negatives. With the pre-trained universal sequence representation model, our approach can be effectively transferred to new recommendation domains or platforms in a parameter-efficient way, under either inductive or transductive settings. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Especially, our approach also leads to a performance improvement in a cross-platform setting, showing the strong transferability of the proposed universal SRL method.

Hence, they have become the de facto solution in a variety of decision-making scenarios. However, GNNs could yield biased results against certain demographic subgroups. Some recent works have empirically shown that the biased structure of the input network is a significant source of bias for GNNs. Nevertheless, no studies have systematically scrutinized which part of the input network structure leads to biased predictions for any given node. The low transparency on how the structure of the input network influences the bias in GNN outcome largely limits the safe adoption of GNNs in various decision-critical scenarios. In this paper, we study a novel research problem of structural explanation of bias in GNNs. Specifically, we propose a novel post-hoc explanation framework to identify two edge sets that can maximally account for the exhibited bias and maximally contribute to the fairness level of the GNN prediction for any given node, respectively. Such explanations not only provide a comprehensive understanding of bias/fairness of GNN predictions but also have practical significance in building an effective yet fair GNN model. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework towards delivering effective structural explanations for the bias of GNNs.

There are two important reasoning tasks on KGs: (1) single-hop knowledge graph completion, which involves predicting individual links in the KG; and (2), multi-hop reasoning, where the goal is to predict which KG entities satisfy a given logical query. Embedding-based methods solve both tasks by first computing an embedding for each entity and relation, then using them to form predictions. However, existing scalable KG embedding frameworks only support single-hop knowledge graph completion and cannot be applied to the more challenging multi-hop reasoning task. Here we present Scalable Multi-hOp REasoning (SMORE), the first general framework for both single-hop and multi-hop reasoning in KGs. Using a single machine SMORE can perform multi-hop reasoning in Freebase KG (86M entities, 338M edges), which is 1,500x larger than previously considered KGs. The key to SMORE's runtime performance is a novel bidirectional rejection sampling that achieves a square root reduction of the complexity of online training data generation. Furthermore, SMORE exploits asynchronous scheduling, overlapping CPU-based data sampling, GPU-based embedding computation, and frequent CPU--GPU IO. SMORE increases throughput (i.e., training speed) over prior multi-hop KG frameworks by 2.2x with minimal GPU memory requirements (2GB for training 400-dim embeddings on 86M-node Freebase) and achieves near linear speed-up with the number of GPUs. Moreover, on the simpler single-hop knowledge graph completion task SMORE achieves comparable or even better runtime performance to state-of-the-art frameworks on both single GPU and multi-GPU settings.|知识图谱（KGs）以头实体-关系-尾实体的三元组形式捕获知识，是众多人工智能系统的核心组件。知识图谱上存在两项重要推理任务：（1）单跳知识图谱补全，涉及预测知识图谱中的独立链接；（2）多跳推理，旨在预测哪些知识图谱实体能满足给定的逻辑查询。基于嵌入的方法通过先计算每个实体和关系的嵌入表示，再利用这些嵌入进行预测来解决这两类任务。然而，现有可扩展的知识图谱嵌入框架仅支持单跳知识图谱补全，无法应用于更具挑战性的多跳推理任务。本文提出可扩展多跳推理框架（SMORE），这是首个同时支持知识图谱单跳与多跳推理的通用框架。在单机环境下，SMORE可在包含8600万个实体、3.38亿条边的Freebase知识图谱上完成多跳推理，其规模是先前处理图谱的1500倍。SMORE实现高效运行的关键在于采用了一种新颖的双向拒绝采样技术，将在线训练数据生成的复杂度降低至平方根级别。此外，该框架通过异步调度机制，实现了基于CPU的数据采样、基于GPU的嵌入计算以及频繁的CPU-GPU输入输出操作三者重叠并行。相比现有多跳知识图谱框架，SMORE在仅需极小GPU内存（在8600万节点的Freebase上训练400维嵌入仅需2GB）的前提下，将吞吐量（即训练速度）提升2.2倍，并随GPU数量增加实现近线性加速。而在更简单的单跳知识图谱补全任务中，SMORE在单GPU与多GPU环境下均达到甚至超越了最先进框架的运行时性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=SMORE:+Knowledge+Graph+Completion+and+Multi-hop+Reasoning+in+Massive+Knowledge+Graphs)|4|

However, they may inherit historical prejudices from training data, leading to discriminatory bias in predictions. Although some work has developed fair GNNs, most of them directly borrow fair representation learning techniques from non-graph domains without considering the potential problem of sensitive attribute leakage caused by feature propagation in GNNs. However, we empirically observe that feature propagation could vary the correlation of previously innocuous non-sensitive features to the sensitive ones. This can be viewed as a leakage of sensitive information which could further exacerbate discrimination in predictions. Thus, we design two feature masking strategies according to feature correlations to highlight the importance of considering feature propagation and correlation variation in alleviating discrimination. Motivated by our analysis, we propose Fair View Graph Neural Network (FairVGNN) to generate fair views of features by automatically identifying and masking sensitive-correlated features considering correlation variation after feature propagation. Given the learned fair views, we adaptively clamp weights of the encoder to avoid using sensitive-related features. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that FairVGNN enjoys a better trade-off between model utility and fairness. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/YuWVandy/FairVGNN.|图神经网络（GNNs）在图表征学习方面展现出强大能力，然而其可能从训练数据中继承历史偏见，导致预测结果存在歧视性偏差。尽管已有研究开发了公平性图神经网络，但大多数方法直接套用非图域中的公平表征学习技术，未能考虑GNN特征传播可能引发的敏感属性泄露问题。我们通过实证研究发现，特征传播会改变原本与敏感属性无关的非敏感特征之间的相关性，这种现象可视为敏感信息的隐性泄露，可能进一步加剧预测歧视。为此，我们根据特征相关性设计两种特征掩码策略，以凸显在消除歧视时考虑特征传播与相关性动态变化的重要性。基于此分析，我们提出公平视图图神经网络（FairVGNN），该模型通过自动识别并掩码经过特征传播后与敏感属性相关的特征，生成公平的特征视图。基于学习得到的公平视图，我们自适应调整编码器权重以避免使用敏感相关特征。在真实数据集上的实验表明，FairVGNN在模型效用与公平性之间实现了更优的平衡。代码已开源于https://github.com/YuWVandy/FairVGNN。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Improving+Fairness+in+Graph+Neural+Networks+via+Mitigating+Sensitive+Attribute+Leakage)|4|

Thus, instead of investigating graph augmentation in the input space, we alternatively propose to perform augmentations on the hidden features (feature augmentation).

Such tribe-style graphs present different patterns to distinguish risky companies from normal ones.

It has become increasingly important given the ever-growing popularity of online videos. However, prediction of watch time not only depends on the match between the user and the video but is often mislead by the duration of the video itself. With the goal of improving watch time, recommendation is always biased towards videos with long duration. Models trained on this imbalanced data face the risk of bias amplification, which misguides platforms to over-recommend videos with long duration but overlook the underlying user interests. This paper presents the first work to study duration bias in watch-time prediction for video recommendation. We employ a causal graph illuminating that duration is a confounding factor that concurrently affects video exposure and watch-time prediction---the first effect on video causes the bias issue and should be eliminated, while the second effect on watch time originates from video intrinsic characteristics and should be preserved. To remove the undesired bias but leverage the natural effect, we propose a Duration-Deconfounded Quantile-based (D2Q) watch-time prediction framework, which allows for scalability to perform on industry production systems. Through extensive offline evaluation and live experiments, we showcase the effectiveness of this duration-deconfounding framework by significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art baselines.

In addition to saving the memory footprint, it further develops solid online inference acceleration with bitwise operations, providing alternative flexibility for the realistic deployment. The empirical results over five large real-world benchmarks show that BiGeaR achieves about 22%~40% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art quantization-based recommender system, and recovers about 95%~102% of the performance capability of the best full-precision counterpart with over 8× time and space reduction.|学习向量化嵌入是各类用户-物品匹配推荐系统的核心。为实现高效在线推理，表征量化技术通过将隐特征嵌入为紧凑的离散数值序列，在优化内存和计算开销方面展现出巨大潜力。然而现有研究仅聚焦数值量化，却忽视了伴随的信息损失问题，导致系统性能显著下降。本文提出一种新型量化框架BiGeaR，通过二值化图表示实现Top-K推荐。我们在二值化表征学习的前、中、后三阶段引入多层面量化增强机制，显著保留了嵌入二值化过程中的信息完整性。该方案在节省内存占用的同时，进一步通过位运算实现实时的在线推理加速，为实际部署提供灵活选择。在五个大型真实场景基准测试中，BiGeaR相比最先进的量化推荐系统性能提升约22%~40%，并以超过8倍的时间空间压缩比，恢复最佳全精度对比模型约95%~102%的性能表现。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Learning+Binarized+Graph+Representations+with+Multi-faceted+Quantization+Reinforcement+for+Top-K+Recommendation)|3|

However, existing methods forgo possible unmeasured confounders (e.g., user financial status), which can result in biased propensities and hurt recommendation performance. This work combats the risk of unmeasured confounders in recommender systems. Towards this end, we propose Robust Deconfounder (RD) that accounts for the effect of unmeasured confounders on propensities, under the mild assumption that the effect is bounded. It estimates the bound with sensitivity analysis, learning a recommender model robust to unmeasured confounders within the bound by adversarial learning. However, pursuing robustness within a bound may restrict model accuracy. To avoid the trade-off between robustness and accuracy, we further propose Benchmarked RD (BRD) that incorporates a pre-trained model into the learning as the benchmark. Theoretical analyses prove the stronger robustness of our methods compared to existing propensity-based deconfounders, and also prove the no-harm property of BRD. Our methods are applicable to any propensity-based estimators, where we select three representative ones: IPS, Doubly Robust, and AutoDebias. We conduct experiments on three real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.|推荐系统需回应干预性问题“若向用户推荐某项目，其反馈将如何”，这要求估算推荐行为对用户反馈的因果效应。通常需要阻断同时影响推荐结果和用户反馈的混杂因子干扰。为减轻混杂偏差，现有策略将倾向性评分纳入模型学习，但这类方法忽略了潜在未测混杂因子（如用户财务状况）的影响，可能导致倾向性估计偏差并损害推荐性能。本研究致力于应对推荐系统中未测混杂因子带来的风险。为此，我们提出鲁棒去混杂（RD）方法，在"未测混杂因子对倾向性的影响有界"这一温和假设下，量化未测混杂因子对倾向评分的影响。该方法通过敏感性分析估计影响边界，并采用对抗学习训练出在边界内对未测混杂因子具有鲁棒性的推荐模型。然而追求边界内的鲁棒性可能限制模型精度，为避免鲁棒性与精度的权衡，我们进一步提出基准化RD（BRD）方法，将预训练模型作为基准融入学习过程。理论分析证明：相比现有基于倾向性评分的去混杂方法，我们提出的方法具有更强鲁棒性，同时证明了BRD的"无损"特性。我们的方法适用于所有基于倾向性评分的估计器，本文选取三种代表性方法：逆概率加权、双稳健估计和AutoDebias。通过在三个真实数据集上的实验，验证了所提方法的有效性。  （注：根据学术论文摘要的翻译规范，对以下要点进行了专业化处理： 1. 专业术语统一："propensity"译为"倾向性评分"，"unmeasured confounders"译为"未测混杂因子" 2. 方法名称保留英文缩写RD/BRD并补充中文全称 3. 技术概念准确传达："adversarial learning"译为"对抗学习"，"sensitivity analysis"译为"敏感性分析" 4. 因果推断核心思想完整呈现：明确区分"因果效应"、"混杂偏差"等关键概念 5. 长难句拆分重组：将英语复合句转换为符合中文表达习惯的短句结构）|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Addressing+Unmeasured+Confounder+for+Recommendation+with+Sensitivity+Analysis)|3|

To make the best out of feature interactions, we propose a graph neural network approach to effectively model them, together with a novel technique to automatically detect those feature interactions that are beneficial in terms of recommendation accuracy. The automatic feature interaction detection is achieved via edge prediction with an L0 activation regularization.

The majority of existing feature selection methods, however, aim to select only a fixed subset of features. This setting cannot fit the dynamic and complex environments of practical recommender systems, where the contribution of a specific feature varies significantly across user-item interactions. In this paper, we propose an adaptive feature selection framework, AdaFS, for deep recommender systems. To be specific, we develop a novel controller network to automatically select the most relevant features from the whole feature space, which fits the dynamic recommendation environment better. Besides, different from classic feature selection approaches, the proposed controller can adaptively score each example of user-item interactions, and identify the most informative features correspondingly for subsequent recommendation tasks.

Embedding-based approaches have dominated the EA task in recent years. Those methods face problems that come from the geometric properties of embedding vectors, including hubness and isolation. To solve these geometric problems, many normalization approaches have been adopted for EA. However, the increasing scale of KGs renders it hard for EA models to adopt the normalization processes, thus limiting their usage in real-world applications. To tackle this challenge, we present ClusterEA, a general framework that is capable of scaling up EA models and enhancing their results by leveraging normalization methods on mini-batches with a high entity equivalent rate. ClusterEA contains three components to align entities between large-scale KGs, including stochastic training, ClusterSampler, and SparseFusion. It first trains a large-scale Siamese GNN for EA in a stochastic fashion to produce entity embeddings. Based on the embeddings, a novel ClusterSampler strategy is proposed for sampling highly overlapped mini-batches. Finally, ClusterEA incorporates SparseFusion, which normalizes local and global similarity and then fuses all similarity matrices to obtain the final similarity matrix.

|[Source Localization of Graph Diffusion via Variational Autoencoders for Graph Inverse Problems](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539288)|Chen Ling, Junji Jiang, Junxiang Wang, Liang Zhao|Tianjin Univ, Tianjin, Peoples R China; Emory Univ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA|Graph diffusion problems such as the propagation of rumors, computer viruses, or smart grid failures are ubiquitous and societal. Hence it is usually crucial to identify diffusion sources according to the current graph diffusion observations. Despite its tremendous necessity and significance in practice, source localization, as the inverse problem of graph diffusion, is extremely challenging as it is ill-posed: different sources may lead to the same graph diffusion patterns. Different from most traditional source localization methods, this paper focuses on a probabilistic manner to account for the uncertainty of different candidate sources. Such endeavors require to overcome significant challenges along the way including: 1) the uncertainty in graph diffusion source localization is hard to be quantified; 2) the complex patterns of the graph diffusion sources are difficult to be probabilistically characterized; 3) the generalization under any underlying diffusion patterns is hard to be imposed. To solve the above challenges, this paper presents a generic framework: Source Localization Variational AutoEncoder (SL-VAE) for locating the diffusion sources under arbitrary diffusion patterns. Particularly, we propose a probabilistic model that leverages the forward diffusion estimation model along with deep generative models to approximate the diffusion source distribution for quantifying the uncertainty. SL-VAE further utilizes prior knowledge of the source-observation pairs to characterize the complex patterns of diffusion sources by a learned generative prior. Lastly, a unified objective that integrates the forward diffusion estimation model is derived to enforce the model to generalize under arbitrary diffusion patterns. Extensive experiments are conducted on $7$ real-world datasets to demonstrate the superiority of SL-VAE in reconstructing the diffusion sources by excelling the state-of-the-arts on average 20% in AUC score.

Recently, geometric deep learning has achieved great success in non-Euclidean domains.

Several challenges include: 1) It is challenging to extract and preserve multi-level rotation and translation equivariant information during learning. 2) Difficulty in developing appropriate tools to effectively leverage the input spatial representations to capture complex geometries across the spatial dimension. 3) Difficulty in incorporating various geometric features and preserving the inherent structural relations.

However, recent studies highlight the importance of higher-order network analysis, where complex structures called motifs are the first-class citizens. We first show that existing link prediction schemes fail to effectively predict motifs. To alleviate this, we establish a general motif prediction problem and we propose several heuristics that assess the chances for a specified motif to appear. To make the scores realistic, our heuristics consider - among others - correlations between links, i.e., the potential impact of some arriving links on the appearance of other links in a given motif. Finally, for highest accuracy, we develop a graph neural network (GNN) architecture for motif prediction. Our architecture offers vertex features and sampling schemes that capture the rich structural properties of motifs. While our heuristics are fast and do not need any training, GNNs ensure highest accuracy of predicting motifs, both for dense (e.g., k-cliques) and for sparse ones (e.g., k-stars). We consistently outperform the best available competitor by more than 10% on average and up to 32% in area under the curve.

Yu|Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; Univ Illinois, Chicago, IL USA; South China Agr Univ, Guangzhou, Peoples R China|Multi-view subspace clustering targets at clustering data lying in a union of low-dimensional subspaces. Generally, an n X n affinity graph is constructed, on which spectral clustering is then performed to achieve the final clustering. Both graph construction and graph partitioning of spectral clustering suffer from quadratic or even cubic time and space complexity, leading to difficulty in clustering large-scale datasets. Some efforts have recently been made to capture data distribution in multiple views by selecting key anchor bases beforehand with k-means or uniform sampling strategy. Nevertheless, few of them pay attention to the algebraic property of the anchors. How to learn a set of high-quality orthogonal bases in a unified framework, while maintaining its scalability for very large datasets, remains a big challenge. In view of this, we propose an Efficient Orthogonal Multi-view Subspace Clustering (OMSC) model with almost linear complexity. Specifically, the anchor learning, graph construction and partition are jointly modeled in a unified framework. With the mutual enhancement of each other, a more discriminative and flexible anchor representation and cluster indicator can be jointly obtained. An alternate minimizing strategy is developed to deal with the optimization problem, which is proved to have linear time complexity w.r.t. the sample number. Extensive experiments have been conducted to confirm the superiority of the proposed OMSC method.

However, such metrics are heuristically built as an aggregate of multiple desirable aspects, introduce parameters and wipe out the interpretability of the output. In this article, we first highlight the limitations of the classical precision/recall, as well as the main issues of the recent event-based metrics -- for instance, we show that an adversary algorithm can reach high precision and recall on almost any dataset under weak assumption. To cope with the above problems, we propose a theoretically grounded, robust, parameter-free and interpretable extension to precision/recall metrics, based on the concept of ``affiliation'' between the ground truth and the prediction sets. Our metrics leverage measures of duration between ground truth and predictions, and have thus an intuitive interpretation. By further comparison against random sampling, we obtain a normalized precision/recall, quantifying how much a given set of results is better than a random baseline prediction. By construction, our approach keeps the evaluation local regarding ground truth events, enabling fine-grained visualization and interpretation of algorithmic results.

|[Feature Overcorrelation in Deep Graph Neural Networks: A New Perspective](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539445)|Wei Jin, Xiaorui Liu, Yao Ma, Charu C. Aggarwal, Jiliang Tang|IBM TJ Watson Res Ctr, Yorktown Hts, NY USA; Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; New Jersey Inst Technol, Newark, NJ 07102 USA|Recent years have witnessed remarkable success achieved by graph neural networks (GNNs) in many real-world applications such as recommendation and drug discovery. Despite the success, oversmoothing has been identified as one of the key issues which limit the performance of deep GNNs. It indicates that the learned node representations are highly indistinguishable due to the stacked aggregators. In this paper, we propose a new perspective to look at the performance degradation of deep GNNs, i.e., feature overcorrelation. Through empirical and theoretical study on this matter, we demonstrate the existence of feature overcorrelation in deeper GNNs and reveal potential reasons leading to this issue. To reduce the feature correlation, we propose a general framework DeCorr which can encourage GNNs to encode less redundant information. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that DeCorr can help enable deeper GNNs and is complementary to existing techniques tackling the oversmoothing issue.|近年来，图神经网络（GNNs）在推荐系统和药物研发等实际应用中取得了显著成功。尽管成果丰硕，但过度平滑已被确认为限制深度GNN性能的核心问题之一——堆叠聚合器导致学习到的节点表征高度趋同。本文提出从特征过度相关的新视角审视深度GNN性能退化问题。通过实证与理论分析，我们证明了深层GNN中确实存在特征过度相关现象，并揭示了导致该问题的潜在成因。为降低特征相关性，我们提出通用框架DeCorr，可促使GNN编码更少冗余信息。大量实验表明，DeCorr不仅能助力构建更深层GNN，还可与现有解决过度平滑问题的技术形成互补。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Feature+Overcorrelation+in+Deep+Graph+Neural+Networks:+A+New+Perspective)|3|
|[Learned Token Pruning for Transformers](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539260)|Sehoon Kim, Sheng Shen, David Thorsley, Amir Gholami, Woosuk Kwon, Joseph Hassoun, Kurt Keutzer|Samsung Semicond Inc, San Jose, CA USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA|Efficient deployment of transformer models in practice is challenging due to their inference cost including memory footprint, latency, and power consumption, which scales quadratically with input sequence length. To address this, we present a novel token reduction method dubbed Learned Token Pruning (LTP) which adaptively removes unimportant tokens as an input sequence passes through transformer layers. In particular, LTP prunes tokens with an attention score below a threshold, whose value is learned for each layer during training. Our threshold-based method allows the length of the pruned sequence to vary adaptively based on the input sequence, and avoids algorithmically expensive operations such as top-k token selection. We extensively test the performance of LTP on GLUE and SQuAD tasks and show that our method outperforms the prior state-of-the-art token pruning methods by up to ∽2.5% higher accuracy with the same amount of FLOPs. In particular, LTP achieves up to 2.1× FLOPs reduction with less than 1% accuracy drop, which results in up to 1.9× and 2.0× throughput improvement on Intel Haswell CPUs and NVIDIA V100 GPUs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that LTP is more robust than prior methods to variations in input sequence lengths. Our code has been developed in PyTorch and open-sourced|实践中，由于Transformer模型存在内存占用、延迟和功耗等推理成本问题，且这些成本随输入序列长度呈二次方增长，其高效部署面临巨大挑战。为此，我们提出了一种名为"学习型令牌剪枝"（LTP）的新型令牌缩减方法，该方法能在输入序列通过Transformer层时自适应地移除不重要令牌。具体而言，LTP会剪除注意力分数低于动态阈值的令牌——该阈值在训练过程中为每一层单独学习得到。这种基于阈值的方法使剪枝后的序列长度能根据输入序列自适应调整，同时避免了计算成本较高的操作（如Top-K令牌选择）。我们在GLUE和SQuAD任务上对LTP进行了全面测试，结果表明：在相同FLOPs条件下，本方法比现有最优令牌剪枝技术的准确率最高提升约2.5%。特别值得注意的是，LTP在准确率下降不足1%的情况下实现了最高2.1倍的FLOPs缩减，这使得在Intel Haswell CPU和NVIDIA V100 GPU上的吞吐量分别提升至1.9倍和2.0倍。此外，我们还证明LTP相比现有方法对输入序列长度变化具有更强适应性。相关代码已基于PyTorch实现并开源。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Learned+Token+Pruning+for+Transformers)|3|

Recently, due to the scarcity of labeled molecules, self-supervised learning methods for learning generalizable and transferable representations of molecular graphs have attracted lots of attention. In this paper, we argue that there exist two major issues hindering current self-supervised learning methods from obtaining desired performance on molecular property prediction, that is, the ill-defined pre-training tasks and the limited model capacity. To this end, we introduce Knowledge-guided Pre-training of Graph Transformer (KPGT), a novel self-supervised learning framework for molecular graph representation learning, to alleviate the aforementioned issues and improve the performance on the downstream molecular property prediction tasks. More specifically, we first introduce a high-capacity model, named Line Graph Transformer (LiGhT), which emphasizes the importance of chemical bonds and is mainly designed to model the structural information of molecular graphs. Then, a knowledge-guided pre-training strategy is proposed to exploit the additional knowledge of molecules to guide the model to capture the abundant structural and semantic information from large-scale unlabeled molecular graphs. Extensive computational tests demonstrated that KPGT can offer superior performance over current state-of-the-art methods on several molecular property prediction tasks.|设计精确的分子性质预测深度学习模型在药物和材料发现领域扮演着日益重要的角色。当前由于标记分子数据稀缺，能够学习可泛化、可迁移分子图表示的自监督学习方法受到广泛关注。本文指出当前自监督学习方法在分子性质预测中面临两大核心问题：预训练任务定义不明确以及模型容量有限。为此，我们提出知识引导的图Transformer预训练框架（KPGT），这一新型自监督学习框架通过缓解上述问题来提升下游分子性质预测任务的性能。具体而言，我们首先设计了高容量模型——线图Transformer（LiGhT），该模型强调化学键的重要性，主要用于建模分子图的结构信息；随后提出知识引导的预训练策略，利用分子附加知识指导模型从大规模未标记分子图中捕获丰富的结构与语义信息。大量计算实验表明，KPGT在多个分子性质预测任务上均能超越现有最先进方法的性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=KPGT:+Knowledge-Guided+Pre-training+of+Graph+Transformer+for+Molecular+Property+Prediction)|3|

Hecht, Jaime Teevan|Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; Microsoft, Redmond, WA USA|Hypergraphs provide an effective abstraction for modeling multi-way group interactions among nodes, where each hyperedge can connect any number of nodes. Different from most existing studies which leverage statistical dependencies , we study hypergraphs from the perspective of causality . Specifically, we focus on the problem of individual treatment effect (ITE) estimation on hypergraphs, aiming to estimate how much an intervention (e.g., wearing face covering) would causally affect an outcome (e.g., COVID-19 infection) of each individual node. Existing works on ITE estimation either assume that the outcome of one individual should not be influenced by the treatment of other individuals (i.e., no interference ), or assume the interference only exists between connected individuals in an ordinary graph. We argue that these assumptions can be unrealistic on real-world hypergraphs, where higher-order interference can affect the ITE estimations due to group interactions. We investigate high-order interference modeling, and propose a new causality learning framework powered by hypergraph neural networks. Extensive experiments on real-world hypergraphs verify the superiority of our framework over existing baselines|超图为建模节点间多元群体交互提供了有效抽象，其中每个超边可连接任意数量的节点。与现有大多数利用统计依赖性的研究不同，我们从因果关系的角度研究超图。具体而言，我们聚焦于超图上的个体处理效应（ITE）估计问题，旨在量化干预措施（如佩戴口罩）对每个个体节点结果（如新冠肺炎感染）的因果影响程度。现有ITE估计研究要么假设个体结果不应受其他个体处理措施影响（即无干扰假设），要么假定干扰仅存在于普通图的相连个体之间。我们认为这些假设在现实超图中可能不成立——由于群体交互作用，高阶干扰会影响ITE估计结果。我们深入研究了高阶干扰建模，并提出了一种基于超图神经网络的新型因果学习框架。在真实超图上的大量实验证实，该框架性能优于现有基线方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Learning+Causal+Effects+on+Hypergraphs)|3|
|[Pre-training Enhanced Spatial-temporal Graph Neural Network for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539396)|Zezhi Shao, Zhao Zhang, Fei Wang, Yongjun Xu|Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Comp Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China; Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Comp Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China|Multivariate Time Series (MTS) forecasting plays a vital role in a wide range of applications. Recently, Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have become increasingly popular MTS forecasting methods. STGNNs jointly model the spatial and temporal patterns of MTS through graph neural networks and sequential models, significantly improving the prediction accuracy. But limited by model complexity, most STGNNs only consider short-term historical MTS data, such as data over the past one hour. However, the patterns of time series and the dependencies between them (i.e., the temporal and spatial patterns) need to be analyzed based on long-term historical MTS data. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, in which STGNN is Enhanced by a scalable time series Pre-training model (STEP). Specifically, we design a pre-training model to efficiently learn temporal patterns from very long-term history time series (e.g., the past two weeks) and generate segment-level representations. These representations provide contextual information for short-term time series input to STGNNs and facilitate modeling dependencies between time series. Experiments on three public real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework is capable of significantly enhancing downstream STGNNs, and our pre-training model aptly captures temporal patterns.|多元时间序列预测在众多应用场景中具有重要作用。近年来，时空图神经网络已成为日益流行的MTS预测方法。该方法通过图神经网络与序列模型共同建模MTS的时空模式，显著提升了预测精度。但受模型复杂度限制，现有STGNN大多仅考虑短期历史MTS数据（如过去一小时的数据）。然而时间序列的规律及其相互依赖关系（即时序模式与空间模式）需要基于长期历史MTS数据进行分析。针对此问题，我们提出一种创新框架：通过可扩展时序预训练模型增强STGNN（STEP）。具体而言，我们设计了一个预训练模型，能够从超长期历史序列（如过去两周数据）中高效学习时序模式，并生成片段级表征。这些表征为STGNN输入的短期时间序列提供上下文信息，并助力建模时间序列间的依赖关系。在三个真实世界公开数据集上的实验表明，本框架能显著增强下游STGNN性能，且预训练模型可有效捕捉时序规律。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Pre-training+Enhanced+Spatial-temporal+Graph+Neural+Network+for+Multivariate+Time+Series+Forecasting)|3|
|[GPPT: Graph Pre-training and Prompt Tuning to Generalize Graph Neural Networks](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539249)|Mingchen Sun, Kaixiong Zhou, Xin He, Ying Wang, Xin Wang|Rice Univ, Houston, TX USA; Jilin Univ, Changchun, Peoples R China|Despite the promising representation learning of graph neural networks (GNNs), the supervised training of GNNs notoriously requires large amounts of labeled data from each application. An effective solution is to apply the transfer learning in graph: using easily accessible information to pre-train GNNs, and fine-tuning them to optimize the downstream task with only a few labels. Recently, many efforts have been paid to design the self-supervised pretext tasks, and encode the universal graph knowledge among the various applications. However, they rarely notice the inherent training objective gap between the pretext and downstream tasks. This significant gap often requires costly fine-tuning for adapting the pre-trained model to downstream problem, which prevents the efficient elicitation of pre-trained knowledge and then results in poor results. Even worse, the naive pre-training strategy usually deteriorates the downstream task, and damages the reliability of transfer learning in graph data. To bridge the task gap, we propose a novel transfer learning paradigm to generalize GNNs, namely graph pre-training and prompt tuning (GPPT). Specifically, we first adopt the masked edge prediction, the most simplest and popular pretext task, to pre-train GNNs. Based on the pre-trained model, we propose the graph prompting function to modify the standalone node into a token pair, and reformulate the downstream node classification looking the same as edge prediction. The token pair is consisted of candidate label class and node entity. Therefore, the pre-trained GNNs could be applied without tedious fine-tuning to evaluate the linking probability of token pair, and produce the node classification decision. The extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of GPPT, delivering an average improvement of 4.29% in few-shot graph analysis and accelerating the model convergence up to 4.32X. The code is available in: https://github.com/MingChen-Sun/GPPT.|尽管图神经网络（GNN）在表示学习方面前景广阔，但其监督训练众所周知需要每个应用场景下的大量标注数据。一种有效的解决方案是在图数据中应用迁移学习：利用易获取的信息对GNN进行预训练，再通过少量标注数据微调以优化下游任务。近年来，研究者们投入大量精力设计自监督代理任务，以编码不同应用间的通用图知识。然而，这些方法很少关注代理任务与下游任务之间固有的训练目标差异。这种显著差异往往需要昂贵的微调成本使预训练模型适配下游问题，这不仅阻碍预训练知识的高效激发，还导致效果不佳。更严重的是，简单的预训练策略通常会恶化下游任务性能，损害图数据迁移学习的可靠性。为弥合任务差距，我们提出了一种新颖的图神经网络泛化迁移学习范式——图预训练与提示调优（GPPT）。具体而言，我们首先采用最简单流行的掩蔽边预测作为代理任务预训练GNN。基于预训练模型，我们提出图提示函数将独立节点转换为标记对，并将下游节点分类任务重构为与边预测相同的形式。该标记对由候选标签类和节点实体构成，使得预训练GNN无需繁琐微调即可评估标记对的连接概率，进而生成节点分类决策。在八个基准数据集上的大量实验证明了GPPT的优越性：在少样本图分析中平均提升4.29%，模型收敛速度最高加快4.32倍。代码已开源：https://github.com/MingChen-Sun/GPPT。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=GPPT:+Graph+Pre-training+and+Prompt+Tuning+to+Generalize+Graph+Neural+Networks)|3|

As real-world events have different granularities, from the top-level themes to key events and then to event mentions corresponding to concrete actions, there are generally two lines of research: (1) theme detection tries to identify from a news corpus major themes (e.g., "2019 Hong Kong Protests" versus "2020 U.S. Presidential Election") which have very distinct semantics; and (2) action extraction aims to extract from a single document mention-level actions (e.g., "the police hit the left arm of the protester") that are often too fine-grained for comprehending the real-world event. In this paper, we propose a new task, key event detection at the intermediate level, which aims to detect from a news corpus key events (e.g., "HK Airport Protest on Aug. 12-14"), each happening at a particular time/location and focusing on the same topic. This task can bridge event understanding and structuring and is inherently challenging because of (1) the thematic and temporal closeness of different key events and (2) the scarcity of labeled data due to the fast-evolving nature of news articles. To address these challenges, we develop an unsupervised key event detection framework, EvMine, that (1) extracts temporally frequent peak phrases using a novel ttf-itf score, (2) merges peak phrases into event-indicative feature sets by detecting communities from our designed peak phrase graph that captures document co-occurrences, semantic similarities, and temporal closeness signals, and (3) iteratively retrieves documents related to each key event by training a classifier with automatically generated pseudo labels from the event-indicative feature sets and refining the detected key events using the retrieved documents in each iteration. Extensive experiments and case studies show EvMine outperforms all the baseline methods and its ablations on two real-world news corpora.|新闻语料库的自动事件检测是挖掘快速演化的结构化知识的关键任务。由于现实事件存在不同粒度层次——从顶层主题到关键事件，再到对应具体动作的事件提及，现有研究主要分为两个方向：（1）主题检测旨在从新闻语料中识别语义差异显著的主要主题（如"2019香港抗议事件"与"2020美国总统大选"）；（2）动作抽取则致力于从单篇文档中提取提及级别的动作（如"警察击打抗议者左臂"），这类信息往往过于细粒度而难以理解现实事件。本文提出一种介于两者之间的新任务——关键事件检测，其目标是从新闻语料中检测具有特定时间/地点属性且聚焦同一主题的关键事件（如"8月12-14日香港机场抗议"）。该任务能够桥接事件理解与结构化工作，但其固有挑战在于：（1）不同关键事件存在主题与时间紧密性；（2）新闻文章快速演变的特性导致标注数据稀缺。为应对这些挑战，我们开发了无监督关键事件检测框架EvMine，其核心流程包括：（1）使用新颖的ttf-itf指标提取时序高频峰值短语；（2）通过构建融合文档共现、语义相似性和时间紧密性信号的峰值短语图进行社区发现，将峰值短语合并为事件指示特征集；（3）利用事件指示特征集自动生成伪标签训练分类器，迭代检索每个关键事件相关文档，并通过检索结果持续优化检测结果。在两个真实新闻语料库上的大量实验与案例研究表明，EvMine在所有基线方法及其消融实验中均表现出优越性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Unsupervised+Key+Event+Detection+from+Massive+Text+Corpora)|3|

Our approach combines Sparse Autoencoder and Graph Neural Network, the latter of which predicts future time series behavior from sparse latent representations learned by the former as well as graph structures learned through recurrent feature embedding. Experimenting on three real-world cyber-physical system datasets, we empirically demonstrate that the proposed method enhances the overall anomaly detection performance, outperforming baseline approaches. Moreover, we show that mining sparse latent patterns from high-dimensional time series improves the robustness of the graph-based forecasting model.

However, the success halts within individual ride hailing platforms because sharing raw order dispatching data across platforms may leak user privacy and business secrets. Such data isolation not only impairs user experience but also decreases the potential revenues of the platforms. In this paper, we advocate federated order dispatching for cross-platform ride hailing, where multiple platforms collaboratively make dispatching decisions without sharing their local data. Realizing this concept calls for new federated learning strategies that tackle the unique challenges on effectiveness, privacy and efficiency in the context of order dispatching. In response, we devise Federated Learning-to-Dispatch (Fed-LTD), a framework that allows effective order dispatching by sharing both dispatching models and decisions while providing privacy protection of raw data and high efficiency. We validate Fed-LTD via large-scale trace-driven experiments with Didi GAIA dataset. Extensive evaluations show that Fed-LTD outperforms single-platform order dispatching by 10.24% to 54.07% in terms of total revenue.|基于学习的智能派单技术在网约车领域取得显著成功，但这种成功目前局限于单一平台内部。由于跨平台共享原始派单数据可能泄露用户隐私与商业机密，数据孤岛现象不仅损害用户体验，也限制了平台的潜在收益。本文提出面向跨平台网约车的联邦化派单方案，使多个平台能在不共享本地数据的情况下协同制定派单决策。实现该方案需要开发新型联邦学习策略，以应对派单场景下在有效性、隐私保护和效率方面的独特挑战。为此，我们设计联邦学习派单框架（Fed-LTD），该框架通过共享派单模型与决策指令，在保障原始数据隐私与高效运行的同时实现高效派单。基于滴滴GAIA数据集的大规模轨迹驱动实验验证表明，Fed-LTD框架相较于单平台派单模式，可将平台总收益提升10.24%至54.07%。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Fed-LTD:+Towards+Cross-Platform+Ride+Hailing+via+Federated+Learning+to+Dispatch)|3|

While most prior work focuses on building product embeddings from features coming from a single modality, we introduce a transformer-based architecture capable of aggregating information from both text and image modalities and show that it significantly outperforms single modality baselines.

Typically, a CRS consists of a recommendation module to predict preferred items for users and a conversation module to generate appropriate responses. To develop an effective CRS, it is essential to seamlessly integrate the two modules. Existing works either design semantic alignment strategies, or share knowledge resources and representations between the two modules. However, these approaches still rely on different architectures or techniques to develop the two modules, making it difficult for effective module integration. To address this problem, we propose a unified CRS model named UniCRS based on knowledge-enhanced prompt learning. Our approach unifies the recommendation and conversation subtasks into the prompt learning paradigm, and utilizes knowledge-enhanced prompts based on a fixed pre-trained language model (PLM) to fulfill both subtasks in a unified approach. In the prompt design, we include fused knowledge representations, task-specific soft tokens, and the dialogue context, which can provide sufficient contextual information to adapt the PLM for the CRS task. Besides, for the recommendation subtask, we also incorporate the generated response template as an important part of the prompt, to enhance the information interaction between the two subtasks. Extensive experiments on two public CRS datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach.

Nevertheless, the cloud-based recommendation in the industry is still very important considering its powerful model capacity and the efficient candidate generation from the billion-scale item pool. Previous attempts to integrate the merits of both paradigms mainly resort to a sequential mechanism, which builds the on-device recommender on top of the cloud-based recommendation. However, such a design is inflexible when user interests dramatically change: the on-device model is stuck by the limited item cache while the cloud-based recommendation based on the large item pool do not respond without the new re-fresh feedback. To overcome this issue, we propose a meta controller to dynamically manage the collaboration between the on-device recommender and the cloud-based recommender, and introduce a novel efficient sample construction from the causal perspective to solve the dataset absence issue of meta controller.

Although the uniform (or unbiased) data may help for the purpose of general debiasing, such data can either be hardly available or induce high experimental cost. In this paper, we consider a more practical setting where we aim to conduct general debiasing with the biased observational data alone. We assume that the observational user behaviors are determined by invariant preference (i.e. a user's true preference) and the variant preference (affected by some unobserved confounders).

Many disk failure prediction techniques have been developed to predict failures before they actually occur, allowing proactive steps to be taken to minimize service disruption and increase service reliability. Existing approaches for disk failure prediction do not differentiate among various types of disk failure. In industrial practice, however, different product teams treat distinct types of disk failures as different prediction tasks in large-scale online service systems like Microsoft 365. For example, hardware operation team is concerned with physical disk errors, while database service team focuses on I/O delay.

In addition, MTHC introduces a novel hierarchy-aware mechanism to deal with the data imbalance problem, which is a severe issue in the area of disk failure prediction. We show that MTHC can be easily utilized to enhance most state-of-the-art disk failure prediction models. Our experiments on both industrial and public datasets demonstrate that such disk failure prediction models enhanced by MTHC performs much better than those models working without MTHC. Furthermore, our experiments also present that the hierarchical-aware mechanism underlying MTHC can alleviate the data imbalance problem and thus improve the practical performance of various disk failure prediction models.

Since the corpus is vast, achieving an efficient query-to-video search can be challenging. Because traditional approximate nearest neighborhood (ANN) search methods are based simple similarities (e.g., cosine or inner products) on embedding vectors. They are often not sufficient for bridging the modal gap between a text query and video advertisements and typically can only achieve sub-optimal performance in query-to-video search. Tree-based deep model (TDM) overcomes the limited matching capability of embedding-based methods but suffers from the data sparsity problem. Deep retrieval model adopts a graph-based model which overcomes the data sparsity problem in TDM by sharing the nodes. But the shared nodes entangle features of different items, making it difficult to distinguish similar items. In this work, we enhance the graph-based model through sub-path embedding to differentiate similar videos. The added sub-path embedding provides personalized characteristics, beneficial for modeling fine-grain details to discriminate similar items.

While shallow multi-task learning can learn task relations, it can only handle pre-defined features. Modern deep multi-task learning can jointly learn latent features and task sharing, but they are obscure in task relation. Also, they pre-define which layers and neurons should share across tasks and cannot learn adaptively. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a new multi-task learning framework that jointly learns latent features and explicit task relations by complementing the strength of existing shallow and deep multitask learning scenarios. Specifically, we propose to model the task relation as the similarity between tasks' input gradients, with a theoretical analysis of their equivalency. In addition, we innovatively propose a multi-task learning objective that explicitly learns task relations by a new regularizer. Theoretical analysis shows that the generalizability error has been reduced thanks to the proposed regularizer.

It usually requires a local model and a federated model, but this approach is either limited to partial parameter exchange or requires additional local updates, each of which is helpless to novel clients and burdensome to the client's computational capacity.

Despite these various structures in KGs, recent works on embedding KGs assume that the entire KG belongs to only one of the two views but not both simultaneously. For works that seek to put both views of the KG together, the instance and ontology views are assumed to belong to the same geometric space, such as all nodes embedded in the same Euclidean space or non-Euclidean product space, an assumption no longer reasonable for two-view KGs where different portions of the graph exhibit different structures. To address this issue, we define and construct a dual-geometric space embedding model (DGS) that models two-view KGs using a complex non-Euclidean geometric space, by embedding different portions of the KG in different geometric spaces. DGS utilizes the spherical space, hyperbolic space, and their intersecting space in a unified framework for learning embeddings. Furthermore, for the spherical space, we propose novel closed spherical space operators that directly decompose to using properties of the spherical space without the need for mapping to an approximate tangent space. Experiments on public datasets show that DGS significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baseline models on KG completion tasks, demonstrating its ability to better model heterogeneous structures in KGs.|双视角知识图谱（KG）联合表征了两个组成部分：用于抽象与常识概念的本体视角，以及用于从本体概念实例化的特定实体的实例视角。因此，这类知识图谱同时包含从本体视角呈现的层次化结构以及从实例视角呈现的循环化结构。尽管知识图谱存在这种结构异质性，现有图谱表示学习研究通常假定整个图谱仅属于单一视角，而非同时包含两种视角。在试图融合双视角的研究中，实例与本体视图往往被强制置于同一几何空间（如所有节点嵌入同一欧几里得空间或非欧几里得积空间），这一假设对于具有异构结构的双视角知识图谱已不再合理。为解决该问题，我们定义并构建了双几何空间嵌入模型（DGS），通过将图谱不同部分嵌入差异化几何空间，采用复杂的非欧几里得几何空间对双视角知识图谱进行建模。DGS创新性地将球面空间、双曲空间及其交集空间整合到统一框架中进行嵌入学习。针对球面空间，我们提出了新型封闭球面空间运算算子，可直接利用球面空间特性进行分解运算，无需映射至近似切空间。在公开数据集上的实验表明，DGS在知识图谱补全任务上显著优于现有最先进基线模型，证明了其更好地建模知识图谱异构结构的能力。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Dual-Geometric+Space+Embedding+Model+for+Two-View+Knowledge+Graphs)|2|

GitHub, as the largest platform, not only attracts developers and researchers to contribute legitimate software and research-related source code but has also become a popular platform for an increasing number of cybercriminals to perform continuous cyberattacks. Hence, some tools have been developed to learn representations of repositories on GitHub for various related applications (e.g., malicious repository detection) recently. However, most of them merely focus on code content while ignoring the rich relational data among repositories. In addition, they usually require a mass of resources to obtain sufficient labeled data for model training while ignoring the usefully handy unlabeled data. To this end, we propose a novel model Rep2Vec which integrates the code content, the structural relations, and the unlabeled data to learn the repository representations. First, to comprehensively model the repository data, we build a repository heterogeneous graph (Rep-HG) which is encoded by a graph neural network. Afterwards, to fully exploit unlabeled data in Rep-HG, we introduce adversarial attacks to generate more challenging contrastive pairs for the contrastive learning module to train the encoder in node view and meta-path view simultaneously. To alleviate the workload of the encoder against attacks, we further design a dual-stream contrastive learning module that integrates contrastive learning on adversarial graph and original graph together. Finally, the pre-trained encoder is fine-tuned to the downstream task, and further enhanced by a knowledge distillation module. Extensive experiments on the collected dataset from GitHub demonstrate the effectiveness of Rep2Vec in comparison with state-of-the-art methods for multiple repository tasks.|在软件数量指数级增长和基于拉取请求的开发系统Git兴起的推动下，各类社交编程平台上涌现出大量开源软件。作为最大平台的GitHub不仅吸引开发者和研究者贡献合法软件及研究相关源代码，也日益成为网络犯罪分子实施持续网络攻击的流行平台。为此，近期已开发出一些工具来学习GitHub代码库的表征，以支持恶意代码库检测等相关应用。然而现有方法大多仅关注代码内容而忽略代码库间丰富的关联数据，且通常需要大量资源获取标注数据进行模型训练，却未有效利用易于获取的未标注数据。  针对上述问题，我们提出新型模型Rep2Vec，通过融合代码内容、结构关系和未标注数据来学习代码库表征。首先构建代码库异质图(Rep-HG)全面建模代码库数据，并采用图神经网络进行编码。随后为充分利用未标注数据，引入对抗攻击生成更具挑战性的对比样本对，使对比学习模块能同时在节点视图和元路径视图训练编码器。为减轻编码器对抗攻击的负担，进一步设计双流对比学习模块，将对抗图和原始图的对比学习进行整合。最终通过下游任务对预训练编码器进行微调，并采用知识蒸馏模块增强性能。在从GitHub采集的数据集上进行大量实验表明，Rep2Vec在多项代码库任务上相比最先进方法具有显著优势。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Rep2Vec:+Repository+Embedding+via+Heterogeneous+Graph+Adversarial+Contrastive+Learning)|2|

While a large number of public charging stations are available, the use of these stations is often imbalanced, causing many problems to Charging Station Operators (CSOs). To this end, in this paper, we propose a Multi-Agent Graph Convolutional Reinforcement Learning (MAGC) framework to enable CSOs to achieve more effective use of these stations by providing dynamic pricing for each of the continuously arising charging requests with optimizing multiple long-term commercial goals. Specifically, we first formulate this charging station request-specific dynamic pricing problem as a mixed competitive-cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning task, where each charging station is regarded as an agent. Moreover, by modeling the whole charging market as a dynamic heterogeneous graph, we devise a multi-view heterogeneous graph attention networks to integrate complex interplay between agents induced by their diversified relationships. Then, we propose a shared meta generator to generate individual customized dynamic pricing policies for large-scale yet diverse agents based on the extracted meta characteristics. Finally, we design a contrastive heterogeneous graph pooling representation module to learn a condensed yet effective state action representation to facilitate policy learning of large-scale agents. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MAGC and empirically show that the overall use of stations can be improved if all the charging stations in a charging market embrace our dynamic pricing policy.|电动汽车（EV）已成为前景广阔的低碳交通目标。尽管现有大量公共充电站，但这些站点使用率往往不均衡，给充电站运营商（CSO）带来诸多问题。为此，本文提出多智能体图卷积强化学习（MAGC）框架，通过为持续产生的充电请求提供动态定价并优化多个长期商业目标，助力充电站运营商实现更高效的资源利用。具体而言：首先将充电站请求特异性动态定价问题构建为混合竞争-协作型多智能体强化学习任务，每个充电站被视为独立智能体；进而通过将整个充电市场建模为动态异构图，设计多视角异构图注意力网络以整合智能体间因多元化关系产生的复杂交互；随后提出共享元生成器，基于提取的元特征为大规模异构智能体生成个性化动态定价策略；最后设计对比式异构图池化表征模块，学习压缩但有效的状态动作表征以促进大规模智能体的策略学习。在两个真实场景数据集上的大量实验验证了MAGC的有效性，并实证表明当充电市场内所有充电站均采用本动态定价策略时，整体站点利用率可获得提升。  （注：本翻译严格遵循学术论文摘要的规范表述，在保持专业术语准确性的同时，采用符合中文科技文献表达习惯的句式结构，如被动语态转换、长句拆分、专业术语统一（如"multi-agent"统一译为"多智能体"）、概念显化（如"continuously arising charging requests"译为"持续产生的充电请求"）等策略，确保学术信息的精确传递与语言的自然流畅。）|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Multi-Agent+Graph+Convolutional+Reinforcement+Learning+for+Dynamic+Electric+Vehicle+Charging+Pricing)|2|
|[Learning Backward Compatible Embeddings](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539194)|Weihua Hu, Rajas Bansal, Kaidi Cao, Nikhil Rao, Karthik Subbian, Jure Leskovec|Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Amazon, Seattle, WA USA|Embeddings, low-dimensional vector representation of objects, are fundamental in building modern machine learning systems. In industrial settings, there is usually an embedding team that trains an embedding model to solve intended tasks (e.g., product recommendation). The produced embeddings are then widely consumed by consumer teams to solve their unintended tasks (e.g., fraud detection). However, as the embedding model gets updated and retrained to improve performance on the intended task, the newly-generated embeddings are no longer compatible with the existing consumer models. This means that historical versions of the embeddings can never be retired or all consumer teams have to retrain their models to make them compatible with the latest version of the embeddings, both of which are extremely costly in practice. Here we study the problem of embedding version updates and their backward compatibility. We formalize the problem where the goal is for the embedding team to keep updating the embedding version, while the consumer teams do not have to retrain their models. We develop a solution based on learning backward compatible embeddings, which allows the embedding model version to be updated frequently, while also allowing the latest version of the embedding to be quickly transformed into any backward compatible historical version of it, so that consumer teams do not have to retrain their models. Under our framework, we explore six methods and systematically evaluate them on a real-world recommender system application. We show that the best method, which we call BC-Aligner, maintains backward compatibility with existing unintended tasks even after multiple model version updates. Simultaneously, BC-Aligner achieves the intended task performance similar to the embedding model that is solely optimized for the intended task.|嵌入（Embeddings）作为对象的低维向量表示，是构建现代机器学习系统的基础。在工业环境中，通常由专业嵌入团队训练嵌入模型来解决特定目标任务（如商品推荐）。生成的嵌入向量随后被消费团队广泛用于解决非目标场景任务（如欺诈检测）。然而，当嵌入模型为提升目标任务的性能而进行更新和重训练时，新生成的嵌入向量与现有消费模型之间会出现兼容性问题。这意味着要么永久保留历史版本的嵌入向量，要么所有消费团队必须重新训练模型以适应最新版本的嵌入向量——这两种方案在实践中都成本极高。本文针对嵌入版本更新及其向后兼容性问题展开研究。我们将该问题形式化定义为：嵌入团队需要持续更新嵌入版本，而消费团队无需重新训练模型。我们提出了一种基于后向兼容嵌入学习的解决方案，该方案既允许频繁更新嵌入模型版本，又能将最新版本的嵌入快速转换为任何历史兼容版本，从而免除消费团队的模型重训练负担。在此框架下，我们探索了六种方法，并在真实推荐系统应用中进行了系统性评估。研究表明，被命名为"BC-Aligner"的最佳方法即使在多次模型版本更新后，仍能保持与现有非目标任务的向后兼容性。同时，BC-Aligner在目标任务上取得的性能与专门针对该任务优化的嵌入模型相当。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Learning+Backward+Compatible+Embeddings)|2|

Popular data like viral videos can be cached on edge servers to serve users with low latency. Investigating the integrity of these edge data is critical and challenging as edge servers often suffer from unreliability and constrained resources. Meanwhile, EDI (edge data integrity) investigation must be performed by edge servers collaboratively at the edge to avoid excessive backhaul network traffic. There are two main challenges in practice: 1) there is a lack of Byzantine-tolerant collaborative investigation method; and 2) edge servers may be reluctant to collaborate without proper incentives. To tackle these challenges systematically, this paper proposes a novel scheme named EdgeWatch to enable robust and collaborative EDI investigation in a decentralized manner based on blockchain. Under EdgeWatch, edge servers collaborate on EDI investigation following a novel integrity consensus. A blockchain system comprises of three main components is built as the infrastructure to facilitate integrity consensus: 1) an incentive mechanism that motivates edge servers to participate in EDI investigation; 2) a reputation system that elects reliable leaders for block consensus; and 3) a leader randomization technique that protects leaders from targeted attacks. We evaluate it against three representative schemes experimentally. The results demonstrate the high precision, efficiency, and robustness of EdgeWatch.|移动边缘计算（MEC）通过在临近用户的网络边缘部署服务器，从基础设施层面提升了数据缓存性能。热门数据（如病毒式传播视频）可缓存在边缘服务器上，以低延迟方式服务用户。由于边缘服务器存在可靠性不足和资源受限的特点，确保边缘数据完整性（EDI）的研究既至关重要又充满挑战。同时，EDI验证必须由边缘服务器协同完成，以避免产生过多的回传网络流量。实践中存在两大挑战：1）缺乏具有拜占庭容错能力的协同验证方法；2）缺乏适当激励机制时边缘服务器缺乏协作意愿。为系统性地解决这些问题，本文提出创新型方案EdgeWatch，基于区块链实现去中心化的鲁棒协同EDI验证。该方案通过新颖的完整性共识机制指导边缘服务器进行协作，并构建包含三大核心组件的区块链基础设施：1）激励边缘服务器参与验证的激励机制；2）选举可靠领导者参与区块共识的声誉系统；3）保护领导者免受针对性攻击的随机化领导者选择技术。通过三类典型方案的对比实验，结果表明EdgeWatch具有高精度、高效率和高鲁棒性的优势。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=EdgeWatch:+Collaborative+Investigation+of+Data+Integrity+at+the+Edge+based+on+Blockchain)|2|

Furthermore, recent years have witnessed an exponential growth of the model scale--from Google's 2016 model with 1 billion parameters to the latest Facebook's model with 12 trillion parameters. Significant quality boost has come with each jump of the model capacity, which makes us believe the era of 100 trillion parameters is around the corner. However, the training of such models is challenging even within industrial scale data centers. This difficulty is inherited from the staggering heterogeneity of the training computation--the model's embedding layer could include more than 99.99% of the total model size, which is extremely memory-intensive; while the rest neural network is increasingly computation-intensive. To support the training of such huge models, an efficient distributed training system is in urgent need. In this paper, we resolve this challenge by careful co-design of both the optimization algorithm and the distributed system architecture. Specifically, in order to ensure both the training efficiency and the training accuracy, we design a novel hybrid training algorithm, where the embedding layer and the dense neural network are handled by different synchronization mechanisms; then we build a system called Persia (short for parallel recommendation training system with hybrid acceleration) to support this hybrid training algorithm. Both theoretical demonstration and empirical study up to 100 trillion parameters have conducted to justified the system design and implementation of Persia. We make Persia publicly available (at this https URL) so that anyone would be able to easily train a recommender model at the scale of 100 trillion parameters.|基于深度学习的模型已占据当前生产推荐系统的主流。近年来，模型规模呈现指数级增长——从谷歌2016年拥有10亿参数的模型，到脸书最新发布的12万亿参数模型。模型容量的每次跃迁都带来显著的质量提升，这使我们相信百万亿参数时代即将到来。然而，即使依托工业级数据中心，此类模型的训练仍面临巨大挑战。这一困境源于训练计算的惊人异构性：模型嵌入层可占据总参数量99.99%以上，具有极高的内存需求；而其余神经网络部分则日益凸显计算密集型特征。为支持此类超大规模模型训练，亟需高效的分布式训练系统。本文通过协同设计优化算法与分布式系统架构来解决这一难题。具体而言，为兼顾训练效率与精度，我们设计了一种新颖的混合训练算法：对嵌入层和稠密神经网络分别采用不同的同步机制；进而构建名为Persia（混合加速并行推荐训练系统）的支持框架。我们通过理论论证与高达百万亿参数的实证研究，验证了Persia的系统设计与实现。现已将Persia开源（https://github.com/PersiaML/Persia），使所有研究者都能轻松训练百万亿级别的推荐模型。  （注：根据学术惯例，原文中的"12 trillion"和"100 trillion"分别译为"12万亿"与"百万亿"。开源地址保留原始URL，实际发布时需确认其有效性）|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Persia:+An+Open,+Hybrid+System+Scaling+Deep+Learning-based+Recommenders+up+to+100+Trillion+Parameters)|2|

Warner, Derek R. Harford, Thomas George Kannampallil, Chenyang Lu|Washington Univ, Sch Med, St Louis, MO USA; Washington Univ, McKelvey Sch Engn, St Louis, MO 63110 USA|Burnout is a significant public health concern affecting nearly half of the healthcare workforce. This paper presents the first end-to-end deep learning framework for predicting physician burnout based on electronic health record (EHR) activity logs, digital traces of physician work activities that are available in any EHR system. In contrast to prior approaches that exclusively relied on surveys for burnout measurement, our framework directly learns deep representations of physician behaviors from large-scale clinician activity logs to predict burnout. We propose the Hierarchical burnout Prediction based on Activity Logs (HiPAL), featuring a pre-trained time-dependent activity embedding mechanism tailored for activity logs and a hierarchical predictive model, which mirrors the natural hierarchical structure of clinician activity logs and captures physicians' evolving burnout risk at both short-term and long-term levels. To utilize the large amount of unlabeled activity logs, we propose a semi-supervised framework that learns to transfer knowledge extracted from unlabeled clinician activities to the HiPAL-based prediction model. The experiment on over 15 million clinician activity logs collected from the EHR at a large academic medical center demonstrates the advantages of our proposed framework in predictive performance of physician burnout and training efficiency over state-of-the-art approaches.|职业倦怠是影响近半数医护人员的重要公共卫生问题。本文首次提出基于电子健康记录（EHR）活动日志预测医生职业倦怠的端到端深度学习框架。与以往仅依靠问卷调查测量倦怠的方法不同，我们的框架直接从大规模临床活动日志中学习医生行为的深度表征进行预测。我们提出了基于活动日志的分层倦怠预测模型（HiPAL），其特点包括：专为活动日志设计的预训练时间依赖活动嵌入机制，以及反映临床活动日志自然层级结构的分层预测模型，可同步捕捉医生短期与长期动态变化的倦怠风险。为利用大量未标注活动日志，我们设计了半监督框架，能够将从无标注临床活动中提取的知识迁移至HiPAL预测模型。基于某大型学术医疗中心EHR系统中超过1500万条临床活动日志的实验表明，该框架在医生倦怠预测性能和训练效率方面均优于现有最先进方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=HiPAL:+A+Deep+Framework+for+Physician+Burnout+Prediction+Using+Activity+Logs+in+Electronic+Health+Records)|2|

Existing prediction models that forecast the first outbreak wave using mobility data may not be applicable to the multiwave prediction, because the evidence in the USA and Japan has shown that mobility patterns across different waves exhibit varying relationships with fluctuations in infection cases. Therefore, to predict the multiwave pandemic, we propose a Social Awareness-Based Graph Neural Network (SAB-GNN) that considers the decay of symptom-related web search frequency to capture the changes in public awareness across multiple waves. Our model combines GNN and LSTM to model the complex relationships among urban districts, inter-district mobility patterns, web search history, and future COVID-19 infections. We train our model to predict future pandemic outbreaks in the Tokyo area using its mobility and web search data from April 2020 to May 2021 across four pandemic waves collected by Yahoo Japan Corporation under strict privacy protection rules. Results demonstrate our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as ST-GNN, MPNN, and GraphLSTM. Though our model is not computationally expensive (only 3 layers and 10 hidden neurons), the proposed model enables public agencies to anticipate and prepare for future pandemic outbreaks.|新冠肺炎的反复爆发对全球社会产生了持续性影响，这要求我们利用早期可获取的多元数据构建疫情波动预测模型。现有基于人流移动数据预测首波疫情的模型可能不适用于多波次疫情预测，因为美国和日本的证据表明，不同波次中人员流动模式与感染病例波动之间的关系存在差异。为此，我们提出一种基于社会认知的图神经网络（SAB-GNN），通过分析症状相关网络搜索频次的衰减来捕捉多波疫情期间公众认知的变化。该模型结合图神经网络与长短期记忆网络，构建了城市区域、跨区域人流移动模式、网络搜索历史与未来新冠感染之间的复杂关系图谱。我们使用雅虎日本公司在严格隐私保护规则下收集的2020年4月至2021年5月东京地区四波疫情期间的人流移动和网络搜索数据训练模型，结果表明其性能优于ST-GNN、MPNN和GraphLSTM等先进基线模型。尽管模型计算成本较低（仅3层网络结构和10个隐藏神经元），但能使公共机构有效预测并应对未来疫情爆发。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Multiwave+COVID-19+Prediction+from+Social+Awareness+Using+Web+Search+and+Mobility+Data)|2|

So the measurement of item unfairness depends on the modeling of item utility, and most previous approaches estimated item utility simply based on user-item interaction logs in recommender systems. The Click-through rate (CTR) is the most popular one. However, we argue that these types of item utilities (named observed utility here) measurements may result in unfair exposures of items. The number of exposure for each item is uneven, and recommendation methods select the exposure audiences (users). In this work, we propose the concept of items' fair utility, defined as the proportion of users who are interested in the item among all users. Firstly, we conduct a large-scale random exposure experiment to collect the fair utility in a real-world recommender application. Significant differences are observed between the fair utility and the widely used observed utility (CTR). Then, intending to obtain fair utility at a low cost, we propose an exploratory task for real-time estimations of fair utility with handy historical interaction logs. Encouraging results are achieved, validating the feasibility of fair utility projections. Furthermore, we present a fairness-aware re-distribution framework and conduct abundant simulation experiments, adopting fair utility to improve fairness and overall recommendation performance at the same time. Online and offline results show that both item fairness and recommendation quality can be improved simultaneously by introducing item fair utility.|近年来，随着推荐系统的发展，项目公平性问题已成为重要关注点之一，其核心在于项目曝光度是否与其效用值相匹配。项目不公平性的衡量取决于项目效用的建模方式，而现有方法大多仅基于推荐系统中的用户-项目交互日志来估算项目效用，其中点击率（CTR）是最常用的指标。然而，我们认为这类项目效用（本文称为"观测效用"）的测量方式可能导致不公平的项目曝光分布。由于每个项目的曝光次数存在不均衡性，且推荐方法自主选择曝光受众（用户），我们提出了"项目公平效用"的概念，即对所有用户中对该项目感兴趣的用户比例进行量化。首先，我们在真实推荐场景中开展大规模随机曝光实验以采集公平效用数据，发现公平效用与广泛采用的观测效用（CTR）存在显著差异。随后，为低成本获取公平效用，我们提出一项探索性任务：利用现有历史交互日志实现公平效用的实时估算。实验取得鼓舞人心的成果，验证了公平效用预测的可行性。进一步地，我们构建了公平感知的再分配框架并进行大量模拟实验，通过采用公平效用同时提升推荐公平性与整体性能。线上与线下实验结果均表明，引入项目公平效用可同步提升项目公平性和推荐质量。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Make+Fairness+More+Fair:+Fair+Item+Utility+Estimation+and+Exposure+Re-Distribution)|2|

Unfortunately, existing approaches fall too short for these challenges; online anomaly detection methods bear the burden of handling the complexity while offline deep anomaly detection methods suffer from the evolving data distribution. This paper presents a framework for online deep anomaly detection, ARCUS, which can be instantiated with any autoencoder-based deep anomaly detection methods. It handles the complex and evolving data streams using an adaptive model pooling approach with two novel techniques: concept-driven inference and drift-aware model pool update; the former detects anomalies with a combination of models most appropriate for the complexity, and the latter adapts the model pool dynamically to fit the evolving data streams. In comprehensive experiments with ten data sets which are both high-dimensional and concept-drifted, ARCUS improved the anomaly detection accuracy of the streaming variants of state-of-the-art autoencoder-based methods and that of the state-of-the-art streaming anomaly detection methods by up to 22% and 37%, respectively.|针对数据流的在线异常检测对众多应用场景的安全保障至关重要，但由于物联网设备和云基础设施产生的数据流具有复杂性和动态演化特性，该任务正面临严峻挑战。现有方法难以应对这些挑战：在线异常检测方法需独立处理数据复杂性，而离线深度异常检测方法则无法适应动态演变的数据分布。本文提出在线深度异常检测框架ARCUS，该框架可兼容所有基于自编码器的深度异常检测方法，通过采用包含两项创新技术的自适应模型池方法应对复杂动态数据流——概念驱动推理机制根据数据复杂性选择最优模型组合进行异常检测，漂移感知模型池更新机制动态调整模型池以适应数据流演化。在十组兼具高维特性和概念漂移特性的数据集综合实验中，ARCUS框架将基于自编码器的流式检测方法性能提升最高达22%，将先进流式异常检测方法性能提升最高达37%。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Adaptive+Model+Pooling+for+Online+Deep+Anomaly+Detection+from+a+Complex+Evolving+Data+Stream)|2|

However, consumption intent is implicit, and only a few known intents have been explored from the user consumption data in Meituan. Hence, discovering new consumption intents is a crucial but challenging task, which suffers from two critical challenges: 1) how to encode the consumption intent related to multiple aspects of preferences, and 2) how to discover the new intents with only a few known ones. In Meituan, we designed the AutoIntent system, consisting of the disentangled intent encoder and intent discovery decoder, to address the above challenges. Specifically, for the disentangled intent encoder, we construct three groups of dual hypergraphs to capture the high-order relations under the three aspects of preferences and then utilize the designed hypergraph neural networks to extract disentangled intent features.

As a result, hierarchical clustering provides richer information and insight into a dataset than partitioning clustering. However, hierarchical clustering algorithms often have two weaknesses: scalability and the capacity to handle clusters of varying densities. This is because they rely on pairwise point-based similarity calculations and the similarity measure is independent of data distribution. In this paper, we aim to overcome these weaknesses and propose a novel efficient hierarchical clustering called StreaKHC that enables massive streaming data to be mined. The enabling factor is the use of a scalable point-set kernel to measure the similarity between an existing cluster in the cluster tree and a new point in the data stream. It also has an efficient mechanism to update the hierarchical structure so that a high-quality cluster tree can be maintained in real-time. Our extensive empirical evaluation shows that StreaKHC is more accurate and more efficient than existing hierarchical clustering algorithms.|层次聚类能够生成具有不同粒度的聚类树结构，因此相比划分式聚类能提供更丰富的数据集信息和洞察。然而传统层次聚类算法通常存在两大缺陷：可扩展性不足以及处理多密度集群的能力有限，这是因为它们依赖基于点对点的相似度计算，且相似性度量与数据分布无关。本文旨在克服这些缺陷，提出了一种名为StreaKHC的新型高效层次聚类算法，可实现海量流式数据的挖掘。该算法的核心创新在于采用可扩展的点集核函数来度量聚类树中现有集群与数据流中新数据点之间的相似性，同时具备高效的层次结构更新机制，能够实时维护高质量的聚类树。我们通过大量实验评估证明，StreaKHC相比现有层次聚类算法具有更高的准确性和运行效率。  （注：根据学术论文翻译规范，对以下要点进行了专业化处理： 1. 专业术语统一："hierarchical clustering"译为"层次聚类"，"partitioning clustering"译为"划分式聚类" 2. 技术概念准确转换："point-set kernel"译为"点集核函数"，"streaming data"译为"流式数据" 3. 长句结构符合中文表达习惯，如将英语被动语态转换为中文主动表述 4. 重要算法名称StreaKHC保留原文大写形式 5. 学术表述严谨性："empirical evaluation"译为"实验评估"而非"经验评估"）|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Streaming+Hierarchical+Clustering+Based+on+Point-Set+Kernel)|2|

Nevertheless, the overstacked architecture of deep graph models makes it difficult to deploy and rapidly test on mobile or embedded systems. To compress over-stacked GNNs, knowledge distillation via a teacher-student architecture turns out to be an effective technique, where the key step is to measure the discrepancy between teacher and student networks with predefined distance functions. However, using the same distance for graphs of various structures may be unfit, and the optimal distance formulation is hard to determine. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel Adversarial Knowledge Distillation framework for graph models named GraphAKD, which adversarially trains a discriminator and a generator to adaptively detect and decrease the discrepancy. Specifically, noticing that the well-captured inter-node and inter-class correlations favor the success of deep GNNs, we propose to criticize the inherited knowledge from node-level and class-level views with a trainable discriminator. The discriminator distinguishes between teacher knowledge and what the student inherits, while the student GNN works as a generator and aims to fool the discriminator. Experiments on nodelevel and graph-level classification benchmarks demonstrate that GraphAKD improves the student performance by a large margin. The results imply that GraphAKD can precisely transfer knowledge from a complicated teacher GNN to a compact student GNN.|深度图神经网络（GNN）已被证明能有效建模图结构数据。然而，深度图模型的过度堆叠架构使其难以在移动或嵌入式系统中进行部署和快速测试。为压缩过堆叠的GNN，基于师生架构的知识蒸馏成为一种有效技术，其关键步骤是通过预定义距离函数衡量师生网络间的差异。但为不同结构的图使用相同距离度量可能不适用，且最优距离公式难以确定。针对这些问题，我们提出新型对抗式知识蒸馏框架GraphAKD，通过对抗训练判别器与生成器实现差异的自适应检测与削减。具体而言，我们观察到深度GNN的成功得益于其对节点间与类间关联的精准捕捉，因此提出采用可训练判别器，分别从节点级和类级视角批判性评估学生网络继承的知识。判别器负责区分教师知识与学生继承知识，而学生GNN作为生成器旨在迷惑判别器。在节点级和图级分类基准上的实验表明，GraphAKD使学生网络性能显著提升，证明该框架能精准地将复杂教师GNN的知识迁移至轻量化学生GNN中。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Compressing+Deep+Graph+Neural+Networks+via+Adversarial+Knowledge+Distillation)|2|
|[UD-GNN: Uncertainty-aware Debiased Training on Semi-Homophilous Graphs](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539483)|Yang Liu, Xiang Ao, Fuli Feng, Qing He|Univ Sci & Technol China, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China; Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Comp Technol, CAS, Beijing, Peoples R China|Recent studies on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) point out that most GNNs depend on the homophily assumption but fail to generalize to graphs with heterophily where dissimilar nodes connect. The concept of homophily or heterophily defined previously is a global measurement of the whole graph and cannot describe the local connectivity of a node. From the node-level perspective, we find that real-world graph structures exhibit a mixture of homophily and heterophily, which refers to the co-existence of both homophilous and heterophilous nodes. Under such a mixture, we reveal that GNNs are severely biased towards homophilous nodes, suffering a sharp performance drop on heterophilous nodes. To mitigate the bias issue, we explore an Uncertainty-aware Debiasing (UD) framework, which retains the knowledge of the biased model on certain nodes and compensates for the nodes with high uncertainty. In particular, UD estimates the uncertainty of the GNN output to recognize heterophilous nodes. UD then trains a debiased GNN by pruning the biased parameters with certain nodes and retraining the pruned parameters on nodes with high uncertainty. We apply UD on both homophilous GNNs (GCN and GAT) and heterophilous GNNs (Mixhop and GPR-GNN) and conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets, where the debiased model consistently performs better and narrows the performance gap between homophilous and heterophilous nodes.|近期关于图神经网络(GNN)的研究指出，大多数GNN模型依赖于同配性假设，难以泛化到具有异配性(相异节点相连)的图结构。先前定义的同配性或异配性概念是对图结构的全局度量，无法描述节点的局部连接特性。从节点层面出发，我们发现现实世界图结构同时存在同配性与异配性混合特征，即同配节点与异配节点共存的现象。在此混合环境下，我们揭示GNN模型存在严重偏向同配节点的问题，导致其在异配节点上的性能急剧下降。为缓解这种偏差问题，我们提出一种不确定性感知去偏(UD)框架，该框架保留偏置模型在特定节点上的知识，并对高不确定性节点进行补偿。具体而言，UD通过估计GNN输出的不确定性来识别异配节点，随后通过剪裁模型在特定节点上的偏置参数，并在高不确定性节点上重新训练剪裁后的参数来训练去偏GNN。我们将UD应用于同配型GNN(GCN、GAT)和异配型GNN(Mixhop、GPR-GNN)，在合成数据集和基准数据集上的实验表明，去偏模型性能持续提升，并显著缩小了同配节点与异配节点之间的性能差距。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=UD-GNN:+Uncertainty-aware+Debiased+Training+on+Semi-Homophilous+Graphs)|2|

Although considerable efforts have been made to solve this problem, most of them decompose a trajectory into several segments and then compute the travel time by integrating the attributes from all segments. The segment view, though being able to depict the local traffic conditions straightforwardly, is insufficient to embody the intrinsic structure of trajectories on the road network. To overcome the limitation, this study proposes multi-view trajectory representation that comprehensively interprets a trajectory from the segment-, link-, and intersection-views. To fulfill the purpose, we design a hierarchical self-attention network (HierETA) that accurately models the local traffic conditions and the underlying trajectory structure. Specifically, a segment encoder is developed to capture the spatio-temporal dependencies at a fine granularity, within which an adaptive self-attention module is designed to boost performance. Further, a joint link-intersection encoder is developed to characterize the natural trajectory structure consisting of alternatively arranged links and intersections. Afterward, a hierarchy-aware attention decoder is designed to realize a tradeoff between the multi-view spatio-temporal features. The hierarchical encoders and the attentive decoder are simultaneously learned to achieve an overall optimality. Experiments on two large-scale practical datasets show the superiority of HierETA over the state-of-the-arts.|到达时间估计是智能交通系统中的关键任务。尽管已有大量研究致力于解决该问题，但多数方法将轨迹分解为若干路段，通过整合所有路段的属性来计算行程时间。这种路段视角虽能直观反映局部交通状况，却难以体现路网轨迹的内在结构特征。为突破这一局限，本研究提出多视角轨迹表征方法，从路段、连接线和交叉口三个维度综合解析轨迹。基于此，我们设计了分层自注意力网络（HierETA），精准建模局部交通状况与深层轨迹结构。具体而言：开发路段编码器以细粒度捕捉时空依赖性，其中创新性引入自适应自注意力模块以提升性能；构建联合连接线-交叉口编码器，表征由连接线与交叉口交替构成的天然轨迹结构；设计层次感知注意力解码器，实现多视角时空特征的动态权衡。通过同步优化分层编码器与注意力解码器，实现整体性能最优。在两个大规模真实数据集上的实验表明，HierETA显著优于现有最优方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Interpreting+Trajectories+from+Multiple+Views:+A+Hierarchical+Self-Attention+Network+for+Estimating+the+Time+of+Arrival)|2|

In this paper, we formulate the root cause analysis problem as a new causal inference task namedintervention recognition. We proposed a novel unsupervised causal inference-based method namedCausal Inference-based Root Cause Analysis (CIRCA). The core idea is a sufficient condition for a monitoring variable to be a root cause indicator,i.e., the change of probability distribution conditioned on the parents in the Causal Bayesian Network (CBN). Towards the application in online service systems, CIRCA constructs a graph among monitoring metrics based on the knowledge of system architecture and a set of causal assumptions.

To guide the model toward better explanations, techniques in explanation supervision - which add supervision signals on the model explanation - have started to show promising effects on improving both the generalizability as and intrinsic interpretability of Deep Neural Networks. However, the research on supervising explanations, especially in vision-based applications represented through saliency maps, is in its early stage due to several inherent challenges: 1) inaccuracy of the human explanation annotation boundary, 2) incompleteness of the human explanation annotation region, and 3) inconsistency of the data distribution between human annotation and model explanation maps. To address the challenges, we propose a generic RES framework for guiding visual explanation by developing a novel objective that handles inaccurate boundary, incomplete region, and inconsistent distribution of human annotations, with a theoretical justification on model generalizability. Extensive experiments on two real-world image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on enhancing both the reasonability of the explanation and the performance of the backbone DNNs model.|尽管现代深度神经网络（DNN）的可解释性技术快速发展——其焦点主要集中于"如何生成解释"，但针对解释本身质量的检验（如"解释是否准确"）以及解释质量提升（如"当解释不准确时如何调整模型以生成更精确解释"）等进阶研究问题仍相对欠缺探索。为引导模型产生更好的解释，解释监督技术通过为模型解释添加监督信号，在提升深度神经网络的泛化能力和内在可解释性方面展现出显著效果。然而，由于存在若干固有挑战，基于视觉显著性图谱的解释监督研究仍处于早期阶段：1）人工解释标注边界的不精确性；2）人工解释标注区域的不完整性；3）人工标注与模型解释图谱之间的数据分布不一致性。针对这些挑战，我们提出通用RES框架，通过构建新型目标函数处理人工标注的边界不精确、区域不完整和分布不一致问题，并从理论层面证明了其对模型泛化能力的提升。在两个真实世界图像数据集上的大量实验表明，该框架能有效提升解释的合理性及主干DNN模型的性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=RES:+A+Robust+Framework+for+Guiding+Visual+Explanation)|2|

Unlike machine-made time series, these action sequences are highly disparate as the time taken to finish a similar action might vary between different persons. Therefore, understanding the dynamics of these sequences is essential for many downstream tasks such as activity length prediction, goal prediction, etc. Existing neural approaches that model an activity sequence are either limited to visual data or are task-specific, i.e., limited to next action or goal prediction. In this paper, we present ProActive, a neural marked temporal point process (MTPP) framework for modeling the continuous-time distribution of actions in an activity sequence while simultaneously addressing three high-impact problems - next action prediction, sequence-goal prediction, and end-to-end sequence generation. Specifically, we utilize a self-attention module with temporal normalizing flows to model the influence and the inter-arrival times between actions in a sequence. Moreover, for time-sensitive prediction, we perform an early detection of sequence goal via a constrained margin-based optimization procedure. This in-turn allows ProActive to predict the sequence goal using a limited number of actions. Extensive experiments on sequences derived from three activity recognition datasets show the significant accuracy boost of ProActive over the state-of-the-art in terms of action and goal prediction, and the first-ever application of end-to-end action sequence generation.|人类活动可被表征为一系列为实现特定目标而执行的时序动作序列。与机器生成的时间序列不同，这些动作序列具有高度异质性，因为不同个体完成相似动作所需时间存在差异。因此，理解这些序列的动态特性对于活动时长预测、目标预测等下游任务至关重要。现有建模活动序列的神经方法要么局限于视觉数据，要么具有任务特定性——仅限于下一动作或目标预测。本文提出ProActive框架，这是一种神经标记时间点过程（MTPP）模型，既能对活动序列中动作的连续时间分布进行建模，同时解决三个高价值问题：下一动作预测、序列目标预测和端到端序列生成。具体而言，我们采用具有时间标准化流的自注意力模块来建模序列中动作间的相互影响和到达时间间隔。针对时间敏感型预测任务，我们通过约束边际优化程序实现序列目标的早期检测，这使得ProActive能够仅通过有限动作即可预测序列目标。在源自三个活动识别数据集的序列上进行的广泛实验表明：ProActive在动作和目标预测精度上显著超越现有最优技术，并首次实现了端到端动作序列生成的实际应用。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=ProActive:+Self-Attentive+Temporal+Point+Process+Flows+for+Activity+Sequences)|2|

In FL, the data is kept locally by each user. This protects the user privacy, but also makes the server difficult to verify data quality, especially if the data are correctly labeled. Training with corrupted labels is harmful to the federated learning task; however, little attention has been paid to FL in the case of label noise. In this paper, we focus on this problem and propose a learning-based reweighting approach to mitigate the effect of noisy labels in FL. More precisely, we tuned a weight for each training sample such that the learned model has optimal generalization performance over a validation set. More formally, the process can be formulated as a Federated Bilevel Optimization problem. Bilevel optimization problem is a type of optimization problem with two levels of entangled problems. The non-distributed bilevel problems have witnessed notable progress recently with new efficient algorithms. However, solving bilevel optimization problems under the Federated Learning setting is under-investigated. We identify that the high communication cost in hypergradient evaluation is the major bottleneck. So we propose Comm-FedBiO to solve the general Federated Bilevel Optimization problems; more specifically, we propose two communication-efficient subroutines to estimate the hypergradient. Convergence analysis of the proposed algorithms is also provided. Finally, we apply the proposed algorithms to solve the noisy label problem.

However, recent studies have shown that attackers can catastrophically degrade the performance of GNNs by maliciously modifying the graph structure. A straightforward solution to remedy this issue is to model the edge weights by learning a metric function between pairwise representations of two end nodes, which attempts to assign low weights to adversarial edges. The existing methods use either raw features or representations learned by supervised GNNs to model the edge weights. However, both strategies are faced with some immediate problems: raw features cannot represent various properties of nodes (e.g., structure information), and representations learned by supervised GNN may suffer from the poor performance of the classifier on the poisoned graph. We need representations that carry both feature information and as mush correct structure information as possible and are insensitive to structural perturbations. To this end, we propose an unsupervised pipeline, named STABLE, to optimize the graph structure. Finally, we input the well-refined graph into a downstream classifier. For this part, we design an advanced GCN that significantly enhances the robustness of vanilla GCN [24] without increasing the time complexity.

We demonstrate that the connection patterns in graphs are informative for outlier detection, and propose Out-of-Distribution Graph Attention Network (OODGAT), a novel GNN model which explicitly models the interaction between different kinds of nodes and separate inliers from outliers during feature propagation.

Instead of underscoring the causal features, the attended graphs are prone to visit the noncausal features as the shortcut to predictions. Such shortcut features might easily change outside the training distribution, thereby making the GNN classifiers suffer from poor generalization. In this work, we take a causal look at the GNN modeling for graph classification. With our causal assumption, the shortcut feature serves as a confounder between the causal feature and prediction. It tricks the classifier to learn spurious correlations that facilitate the prediction in in-distribution (ID) test evaluation, while causing the performance drop in out-of-distribution (OOD) test data. To endow the classifier with better interpretation and generalization, we propose the Causal Attention Learning (CAL) strategy, which discovers the causal patterns and mitigates the confounding effect of shortcuts. Specifically, we employ attention modules to estimate the causal and shortcut features of the input graph. We then parameterize the backdoor adjustment of causal theory -- combine each causal feature with various shortcut features. It encourages the stable relationships between the causal estimation and the prediction, regardless of the changes in shortcut parts and distributions. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CAL.|在图分类任务中，基于注意力机制和池化操作的图神经网络（GNN）已成为提取关键特征和支持预测的主流方法。这些方法大多遵循"学习注意力"的范式，通过最大化被关注图与真实标签之间的互信息进行优化。然而，该范式会导致GNN分类器盲目吸收训练数据中输入特征与标签之间的所有统计关联，而无法区分特征的因果效应与非因果效应。被关注的图结构往往会绕过因果特征，转而利用非因果特征作为预测捷径。此类捷径特征在训练分布之外极易发生变化，从而导致GNN分类器的泛化能力显著下降。  本研究从因果视角重新审视图分类中的GNN建模。根据我们的因果假设，捷径特征在因果特征与预测结果之间扮演了混淆变量的角色。它诱导分类器学习伪相关关系：虽然在分布内（ID）测试评估中能提升预测效果，但在分布外（OOD）测试数据上会导致性能退化。为增强分类器的可解释性与泛化能力，我们提出因果注意力学习（CAL）策略，通过发现因果模式并减轻捷径特征的混淆效应来实现这一目标。具体而言，我们采用注意力模块分别估计输入图的因果特征和捷径特征，随后对因果理论中的后门调整进行参数化建模——将每个因果特征与多种捷径特征进行组合。该方法能强化因果估计与预测结果之间的稳定关联，而不受捷径部分及分布变化的影响。在合成数据集和真实数据集上的大量实验验证了CAL方法的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Causal+Attention+for+Interpretable+and+Generalizable+Graph+Classification)|2|

However, the optimal architecture is applied to all the instances (i.e., nodes, in the context of graph) equally, which might be insufficient to handle the diverse local patterns ingrained in a graph, as shown in this paper and some very recent studies. Thus, we argue the necessity of node-wise architecture search for GNN. Nevertheless, node-wise architecture cannot be realized by trivially applying NAS methods node by node due to the scalability issue and the need for determining test nodes' architectures. To tackle these challenges, we propose a framework wherein the parametric controllers decide the GNN architecture for each node based on its local patterns. We instantiate our framework with depth, aggregator and resolution controllers, and then elaborate on learning the backbone GNN model and the controllers to encourage their cooperation. Empirically, we justify the effects of node-wise architecture through the performance improvements introduced by the three controllers, respectively. Moreover, our proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on five of the ten real-world datasets, where the diversity of these datasets has hindered any graph convolution-based method to lead on them simultaneously. This result further confirms that node-wise architecture can help GNNs become versatile models.|近年来，图神经网络架构搜索（NAS）因其能为给定图数据寻找最优架构而日益受到关注。然而，现有方法将最优架构同等应用于所有实例（即图中的节点），如本文及最新研究表明，这种处理方式可能难以应对图中固有的多样化局部模式。因此，我们提出图神经网络需要进行节点级架构搜索的必要性。但受限于计算可扩展性及测试节点架构确定的难题，通过简单逐节点应用NAS方法无法实现节点级架构。为解决这些挑战，我们提出一个框架：参数化控制器根据每个节点的局部模式决定其GNN架构。我们通过深度控制器、聚合控制器和分辨率控制器实现该框架，并详细阐述如何促进主干GNN模型与控制器的协同学习。实验结果表明，三个控制器分别带来的性能提升验证了节点级架构的有效性。此外，在十个真实数据集的五个基准测试中，我们提出的框架显著优于现有最优方法——这些数据集的多样性曾使所有基于图卷积的方法难以同时领先。该结果进一步证实节点级架构有助于GNN成为通用性更强的模型。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Graph+Neural+Networks+with+Node-wise+Architecture)|2|

However, traditional community detection algorithms fail to pinpoint a particular kind of community. This limits its applicability in real-world networks, e.g., distinguishing fraud groups from normal ones in transaction networks. Recently, semi-supervised community detection emerges as a solution. It aims to seek other similar communities in the network with few labeled communities as training data. Existing works can be regarded as seed-based: locate seed nodes and then develop communities around seeds. However, these methods are quite sensitive to the quality of selected seeds since communities generated around a mis-detected seed may be irrelevant. Besides, they have individual issues, e.g., inflexibility and high computational overhead. To address these issues, we propose CLARE, which consists of two key components, Community Locator and Community Rewriter. Our idea is that we can locate potential communities and then refine them. Therefore, the community locator is proposed for quickly locating potential communities by seeking subgraphs that are similar to training ones in the network. To further adjust these located communities, we devise the community rewriter. Enhanced by deep reinforcement learning, it suggests intelligent decisions, such as adding or dropping nodes, to refine community structures flexibly. Extensive experiments verify both the effectiveness and efficiency of our work compared with prior state-of-the-art approaches on multiple real-world datasets.|社区检测指发现紧密关联子图以理解网络结构的任务。然而传统社区检测算法无法准确定位特定类型的社区，这限制了其在现实网络中的应用，例如在交易网络中区分欺诈群体与正常群体。近年来，半监督社区检测作为解决方案应运而生，其目标是通过少量已标注社区作为训练数据，在网络中寻找其他相似社区。现有方法可视为基于种子的方法：先定位种子节点，随后围绕种子扩展社区。但这类方法对所选种子质量非常敏感，因为围绕误判种子生成的社区可能完全不相关。此外，它们还存在各自局限性，如灵活性不足和计算开销过大。  为解决这些问题，我们提出CLARE框架，其包含两个核心组件：社区定位器与社区重写器。我们的核心思路是先定位潜在社区再进行优化。社区定位器通过寻找网络中与训练样本相似的子图来实现快速社区定位。为进一步优化已定位的社区，我们设计了基于深度强化学习的社区重写器，该组件能智能建议节点增删等操作，灵活调整社区结构。在多个真实数据集上的实验表明，相较于现有先进方法，我们的方案在效能与效率方面均具有显著优势。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=CLARE:+A+Semi-supervised+Community+Detection+Algorithm)|2|

Along this line, existing methods usually assume that the graph structure (or the adjacency matrix), which determines the aggregation manner of graph neural network, is fixed either by definition or self-learning. However, the interactions of variables can be dynamic and evolutionary in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, the interactions of time series are quite different if they are observed at different time scales. To equip the graph neural network with a flexible and practical graph structure, in this paper, we investigate how to model the evolutionary and multi-scale interactions of time series. In particular, we first provide a hierarchical graph structure cooperated with the dilated convolution to capture the scale-specific correlations among time series. Then, a series of adjacency matrices are constructed under a recurrent manner to represent the evolving correlations at each layer. Moreover, a unified neural network is provided to integrate the components above to get the final prediction. In this way, we can capture the pair-wise correlations and temporal dependency simultaneously. Finally, experiments on both single-step and multi-step forecasting tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art approaches.|近期研究表明，图神经网络在多变量时间序列预测领域展现出巨大潜力——该方法将时间序列间的交互关系描述为图结构，并将变量表示为图节点。基于这一思路，现有方法通常假设决定图神经网络聚合方式的图结构（即邻接矩阵）是通过定义或自学习方式固定的。然而在实际场景中，变量间的交互作用往往具有动态演化特性。更重要的是，当在不同时间尺度下观察时，时间序列的交互模式会存在显著差异。为使图神经网络具备灵活实用的图结构，本文重点研究如何建模时间序列的演化性多尺度交互关系。具体而言，我们首先提出结合空洞卷积的分层图结构来捕捉时间序列间特定尺度的相关性；随后采用循环方式构建一系列邻接矩阵，以表征每一层中持续演化的关联关系；进一步设计统一神经网络集成上述组件以获得最终预测结果。通过这种方式，我们能够同步捕捉变量间的成对相关性与时间依赖性。最终在单步与多步预测任务上的实验表明，该方法较现有最优方法具有显著优势。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Learning+the+Evolutionary+and+Multi-scale+Graph+Structure+for+Multivariate+Time+Series+Forecasting)|2|

Conventional methods usually assume that each sample (patient) is associated with the unified observed modalities, and all modalities are available for each sample. However, missing modality caused by various clinical and social reasons is a common issue in real-world clinical scenarios. Existing methods mostly rely on solving a generative model that learns a mapping from the latent space to the original input space, which is an unstable ill-posed inverse problem. To relieve the underdetermined system, we propose a model solving a direct problem, dubbed learning with Missing Modalities in Multimodal healthcare data (M3Care). M3Care is an end-to-end model compensating the missing information of the patients with missing modalities to perform clinical analysis. Instead of generating raw missing data, M3Care imputes the task-related information of the missing modalities in the latent space by the auxiliary information from each patient's similar neighbors, measured by a task-guided modality-adaptive similarity metric, and thence conducts the clinical tasks. The task-guided modality-adaptive similarity metric utilizes the uncensored modalities of the patient and the other patients who also have the same uncensored modalities to find similar patients. Experiments on real-world datasets show that M3Care outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, the findings discovered by M3Care are consistent with experts and medical knowledge, demonstrating the capability and the potential of providing useful insights and explanations.|多模态电子健康档案（EHR）数据在临床应用中已被广泛使用。传统方法通常假设每个样本（患者）具有统一的观测模态，且所有模态对每个样本均可用。然而在实际临床场景中，由于各类临床与社会因素导致的数据模态缺失已成为普遍问题。现有方法多依赖于求解从隐空间到原始输入空间的映射生成模型，但这属于不稳定的不适定逆问题。为缓解这一欠定系统，我们提出了一种直接问题求解模型——多模态医疗数据缺失模态学习方法（M3Care）。该端到端模型通过补偿缺失模态患者的有效信息来完成临床分析，其核心创新在于：不在原始数据层面生成缺失模态，而是通过任务引导的模态自适应相似度度量，从具有相似特征的患者邻居中提取辅助信息，在隐空间内补全与任务相关的缺失模态信息，进而执行临床任务。该相似度度量利用患者未缺失模态与其他具有相同未缺失模态的患者数据进行相似患者匹配。在真实世界数据集上的实验表明，M3Care性能优于现有最优基线方法。此外，该方法发现的规律与专家知识和医学认知高度一致，证明了其提供有效洞见与临床解释的能力与潜力。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=M3Care:+Learning+with+Missing+Modalities+in+Multimodal+Healthcare+Data)|2|

Maus, Svetomir N. Markovic, Alexey A. Leontovich, Raymond Moore|Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; Mayo Clin, Rochester, MN USA|The goal of spatially explainable artificial intelligence (AI) classification approach is to build a classifier to distinguish two classes (e.g., responder, non-responder) based on the their spatial arrangements (e.g., spatial interactions between different point categories) given multi-category point data from two classes. This problem is important for generating hypotheses towards discovering new immunotherapies for cancer treatment as well as for other applications in biomedical research and microbial ecology. This problem is challenging due to an exponential number of category subsets which may vary in the strength of their spatial interactions. Most prior efforts on using human selected spatial association measures may not be sufficient for capturing the relevant spatial interactions (e.g., surrounded by) which may be of biological significance. In addition, the related deep neural networks are limited to category pairs and do not explore larger subsets of point categories. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Spatial-interaction Aware Multi-Category deep neural Network (SAMCNet) architecture and contribute novel local reference frame characterization and point pair prioritization layers for spatially explainable classification. Experimental results on multiple cancer datasets (e.g., MxIF) show that the proposed architecture provides higher prediction accuracy over baseline methods. A real-world case study demonstrates that the proposed work discovers patterns that are missed by the existing methods and has the potential to inspire new scientific discoveries.|空间可解释人工智能分类方法的目标是构建一个分类器，基于两类样本（如应答者与非应答者）的空间分布模式（例如不同点类别间的空间相互作用），对来自这两类的多类别点数据进行区分。该方法对于推动癌症治疗新免疫疗法的假设生成，以及在生物医学研究和微生物生态学等领域的应用具有重要意义。该研究面临的核心挑战在于存在指数级数量的类别子集，且这些子集的空间相互作用强度存在差异。现有研究大多采用人工选择的空间关联度量，可能难以捕捉具有生物学意义的相关空间相互作用模式（如"被包围"关系）。此外，相关深度神经网络仅局限于处理成对类别，未能探索更大规模的点类别子集。为突破这些局限，我们提出空间交互感知多类别深度神经网络架构，并创新性地引入了局部参考系表征层和点对优先级排序层，以实现空间可解释分类。在多个癌症数据集上的实验结果表明，该架构相比基线方法具有更高的预测准确度。通过真实案例研究证实，所提出的方法能够发现现有技术遗漏的模式，具备推动新科学发现的潜力。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=SAMCNet:+Towards+a+Spatially+Explainable+AI+Approach+for+Classifying+MxIF+Oncology+Data)|2|

Existing FL methods usually assume the global model can be trained on any participating client. However, in real applications, the devices of clients are usually heterogeneous, and have different computing power. Although big models like BERT have achieved huge success in AI, it is difficult to apply them to heterogeneous FL with weak clients. The straightforward solutions like removing the weak clients or using a small model to fit all clients will lead to some problems, such as under-representation of dropped clients and inferior accuracy due to data loss or limited model representation ability. In this work, we propose InclusiveFL, a client-inclusive federated learning method to handle this problem. The core idea of InclusiveFL is to assign models of different sizes to clients with different computing capabilities, bigger models for powerful clients and smaller ones for weak clients. We also propose an effective method to share the knowledge among local models with different sizes. In this way, all the clients can participate in FL training, and the final model can be big and powerful enough. Besides, we propose a momentum knowledge distillation method to better transfer knowledge in big models on powerful clients to the small models on weak clients. Extensive experiments on many real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of InclusiveFL in learning accurate models from clients with heterogeneous devices under the FL framework.|联邦学习（FL）是一种通过隐私保护方式从分散数据中训练全局模型的重要范式。现有联邦学习方法通常假设全局模型可在任意参与客户端上训练，然而实际应用中客户端设备通常具有异构特性，且计算能力存在差异。尽管像BERT这样的大型模型在人工智能领域取得巨大成功，但将其应用于存在弱客户端的异构联邦学习仍面临困难。直接解决方案（如剔除弱客户端或使用小模型适配所有客户端）会引发诸多问题：被剔除客户端代表性不足、数据丢失导致精度下降，或模型表达能力有限导致性能劣化。为此，我们提出包容性联邦学习（InclusiveFL），通过为不同计算能力的客户端分配不同规模的模型（强大客户端使用大模型，弱客户端使用小模型），并创新性地提出跨规模本地模型间的知识共享机制，使所有客户端都能参与联邦学习训练，同时确保最终模型具备足够强大的表达能力。此外，我们提出动量知识蒸馏方法，以更高效地将强大客户端大模型的知识迁移至弱客户端的小模型。在多个真实场景基准数据集上的大量实验证明，InclusiveFL能够有效在联邦学习框架下从异构设备客户端中学习出精确模型。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=No+One+Left+Behind:+Inclusive+Federated+Learning+over+Heterogeneous+Devices)|2|

However, an important question remains: how can we extract relevant information from the user's utterances and use it in the retrieval or recommendation in the next turn of the conversation? Utilizing relevant information from users' utterances leads the system to better results at the end of the conversation. In this paper, we propose a model based on reinforcement learning, namely RelInCo, which takes the user's utterances and the context of the conversation and classifies each word in the user's utterances as belonging to the relevant or non-relevant class.

However, EBR in sponsored search is distinguished from other generic scenarios and technically challenging due to the need of serving multiple retrieval purposes: firstly, it has to retrieve high-relevance ads, which may exactly serve user's search intent; secondly, it needs to retrieve high-CTR ads so as to maximize the overall user clicks. In this paper, we present a novel representation learning framework Uni-Retriever developed for Bing Search, which unifies two different training modes knowledge distillation and contrastive learning to realize both required objectives. On one hand, the capability of making high-relevance retrieval is established by distilling knowledge from the "relevance teacher model''. On the other hand, the capability of making high-CTR retrieval is optimized by learning to discriminate user's clicked ads from the entire corpus. The two training modes are jointly performed as a multi-objective learning process, such that the ads of high relevance and CTR can be favored by the generated embeddings. Besides the learning strategy, we also elaborate our solution for EBR serving pipeline built upon the substantially optimized DiskANN, where massive-scale EBR can be performed with competitive time and memory efficiency, and accomplished in high-quality.

From a user's past activities validated by defined safety process, NxtPost seeks to learn a representation for the user's dynamic content preference and to predict the next post user may be interested in.

|[ReprBERT: Distilling BERT to an Efficient Representation-Based Relevance Model for E-Commerce](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539090)|Shaowei Yao, Jiwei Tan, Xi Chen, Juhao Zhang, Xiaoyi Zeng, Keping Yang|Alibaba Group, Hangzhou, China|Text relevance or text matching of query and product is an essential technique for e-commerce search engine, which helps users find the desirable products and is also crucial to ensuring user experience. A major difficulty for e-commerce text relevance is the severe vocabulary gap between query and product. Recently, neural networks have been the mainstream for the text matching task owing to the better performance for semantic matching. Practical e-commerce relevance models are usually representation-based architecture, which can pre-compute representations offline and are therefore online efficient. Interaction-based models, although can achieve better performance, are mostly time-consuming and hard to be deployed online. Recently BERT has achieved significant progress on many NLP tasks including text matching, and it is of great value but also big challenge to deploy BERT to the e-commerce relevance task. To realize this goal, we propose ReprBERT, which has the advantages of both excellent performance and low latency, by distilling the interaction-based BERT model to a representation-based architecture. To reduce the performance decline, we investigate the key reasons and propose two novel interaction strategies to resolve the absence of representation interaction and low-level semantic interaction. Finally, ReprBERT can achieve only about 1.5% AUC loss from the interaction-based BERT, but has more than 10% AUC improvement compared to previous state-of-the-art representation-based models. ReprBERT has already been deployed on the search engine of Taobao and serving the entire search traffic, achieving significant gain of user experience and business profit.|查询和产品的文本相关性或文本匹配是电子商务搜索引擎的关键技术，它可以帮助用户找到想要的产品，也是保证用户体验的关键。电子商务文本相关性的一个主要困难是查询和产品之间严重的词汇差距。近年来，神经网络以其较好的语义匹配性能成为文本匹配的主流。实用的电子商务相关性模型通常是基于表示的体系结构，它可以离线预先计算表示，因此具有在线效率。基于交互的模型，尽管可以获得更好的性能，但是大部分都是耗时的，并且很难在线部署。近年来，BERT 在包括文本匹配在内的许多自然语言处理任务中取得了显著的进展，将 BERT 部署到电子商务相关任务中具有很大的价值，但也面临很大的挑战。为了实现这一目标，我们提出了 ReprBERT，它具有良好的性能和低延迟的优点，通过提炼基于交互的 BERT 模型到一个基于表示的体系结构。为了减少表征交互和低层次语义交互的缺失，本文研究了表征交互和低层次语义交互的关键原因，并提出了两种新的交互策略来解决表征交互和低层次语义交互的缺失问题。最后，ReprBERT 只能从基于交互的 BERT 中获得约1.5% 的 AUC 损失，但与以前的基于最先进表示的模型相比，具有超过10% 的 AUC 改善。ReprBERT 已经部署在淘宝的搜索引擎上，服务于整个搜索流量，取得了显著的用户体验和商业利润收益。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=ReprBERT:+Distilling+BERT+to+an+Efficient+Representation-Based+Relevance+Model+for+E-Commerce)|1|
|[Learning Supplementary NLP Features for CTR Prediction in Sponsored Search](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539064)|Dong Wang, Shaoguang Yan, Yunqing Xia, Kavé Salamatian, Weiwei Deng, Qi Zhang|Microsoft Corporation, Beijing, China; University of Savoie & Tallinn University of Technology, Annecy, France|In sponsored search engines, pre-trained language models have shown promising performance improvements on Click-Through-Rate (CTR) prediction. A widely used approach for utilizing pre-trained language models in CTR prediction consists of fine-tuning the language models with click labels and early stopping on peak value of the obtained Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC). Thereafter the output of these fine-tuned models, i.e., the final score or intermediate embedding generated by language model, is used as a new Natural Language Processing (NLP) feature into CTR prediction baseline. This cascade approach avoids complicating the CTR prediction baseline, while keeping flexibility and agility. However, we show in this work that calibrating separately the language model based on the peak single model AUC does not always yield NLP features that give the best performance in CTR prediction model ultimately. Our analysis reveals that the misalignment is due to overlap and redundancy between the new NLP features and the existing features in CTR prediction baseline. In other words, the NLP features can improve CTR prediction better if such overlap can be reduced. For this purpose, we introduce a simple and general joint-training framework for fine-tuning of language models, combined with the already existing features in CTR prediction baseline, to extract supplementary knowledge for NLP feature. Moreover, we develop an efficient Supplementary Knowledge Distillation (SuKD) that transfers the supplementary knowledge learned by a heavy language model to a light and serviceable model. Comprehensive experiments on both public data and commercial data presented in this work demonstrate that the new NLP features resulting from the joint-training framework can outperform significantly the ones from the independent fine-tuning based on click labels. we also show that the light model distilled with SuKD can provide obvious AUC improvement in CTR prediction over the traditional feature-based knowledge distillation.|在赞助商搜索引擎中，预先训练好的语言模型在点击率(Click-Through-Rate，CTR)预测方面显示出有希望的性能改进。一个广泛使用的方法，利用预先训练的语言模型在点击率预测包括微调的语言模型与点击标签和早期停止在 ROC 曲线下面积(AUC)峰值获得。然后，这些微调模型的输出，即语言模型生成的最终分数或中间嵌入，被用作 CTR 预测基线的一个新的自然语言处理(NLP)特征。这种级联方法避免了使 CTR 预测基线复杂化，同时保持了灵活性和敏捷性。然而，我们的工作表明，基于峰值单模型 AUC 分别标定语言模型并不总是产生 NLP 特征，最终给出 CTR 预测模型的最佳性能。我们的分析表明，失调是由于重叠和冗余之间的新 NLP 特征和现有的特征在 CTR 预测基线。换句话说，如果能够减少这种重叠，NLP 特征能够更好地提高 CTR 预测。为此，本文提出了一种简单通用的语言模型微调联合训练框架，结合 CTR 预测基线中已有的特征，提取 NLP 特征的补充知识。此外，我们开发了一个有效的补充知识提取(SuKD) ，将重语言模型所学到的补充知识转化为一个简单易用的模型。对公共数据和商业数据的综合实验表明，联合训练框架所产生的新的自然语言处理特征可以显著优于基于点击标签的独立微调。与传统的基于特征的知识提取方法相比，用 SuKD 提取的光模型在 CTR 预测方面可以提供明显的 AUC 改进。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Learning+Supplementary+NLP+Features+for+CTR+Prediction+in+Sponsored+Search)|1|

However, the embedding tables often demand an extremely large number of parameters, which become the storage and efficiency bottlenecks. Distributed training solutions have been adopted to partition the embedding tables into multiple devices. However, the embedding tables can easily lead to imbalances if not carefully partitioned. This is a significant design challenge of distributed systems named embedding table sharding, i.e., how we should partition the embedding tables to balance the costs across devices, which is a non-trivial task because 1) it is hard to efficiently and precisely measure the cost, and 2) the partition problem is known to be NP-hard. In this work, we introduce our novel practice in Meta, namely AutoShard, which uses a neural cost model to directly predict the multi-table costs and leverages deep reinforcement learning to solve the partition problem. Experimental results on an open-sourced large-scale synthetic dataset and Meta's production dataset demonstrate the superiority of AutoShard over the heuristics. Moreover, the learned policy of AutoShard can transfer to sharding tasks with various numbers of tables and different ratios of the unseen tables without any fine-tuning. Furthermore, AutoShard can efficiently shard hundreds of tables in seconds. The effectiveness, transferability, and efficiency of AutoShard make it desirable for production use.

However, the global data distribution, as a mixture of all the users' data distributions, for training a global model may deviate from each user's local distribution for inference, making the global model non-optimal for each individual user. To mitigate distribution discrepancy, on-device training over local data for model personalization is a potential solution, but suffers from serious overfitting. In this work, we propose a new device-cloud collaborative learning framework under the paradigm of domain adaption, called MPDA, to break the dilemmas of purely cloud-based learning and on-device training. From the perspective of a certain user, the general idea of MPDA is to retrieve some similar data from the cloud's global pool, which functions as large-scale source domains, to augment the user's local data as the target domain. The key principle of choosing which outside data depends on whether the model trained over these data can generalize well over the local data. We theoretically analyze that MPDA can reduce distribution discrepancy and overfitting risk. We also extensively evaluate over the public MovieLens 20M and Amazon Electronics datasets, as well as an industrial dataset collected from Mobile Taobao over a period of 30 days. We finally build a device-tunnel-cloud system pipeline, deploy MPDA in the icon area of Mobile Taobao for click-through rate prediction, and conduct online A/B testing. Both offline and online results demonstrate that MPDA outperforms the baselines of cloud-based learning and on-device training only over local data, from multiple offline and online metrics.|基于云的学习是目前学术界和工业界的主流。然而，全局数据分布作为所有用户数据分布的混合，用于训练全局模型可能偏离每个用户的局部分布进行推理，使得全局模型对于每个用户不是最优的。为了缓解分布差异，对模型个性化的本地数据进行设备上的训练是一个潜在的解决方案，但是存在严重的过拟合问题。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个新的设备-云计算合作学习框架，在领域适应的范例下称为 MPDA，以打破纯粹基于云的学习和设备上培训的困境。从某个用户的角度来看，MPDA 的总体思想是从作为大规模源域的云的全局池中检索一些类似的数据，以增加用户的本地数据作为目标域。选择哪些外部数据的关键原则取决于对这些数据进行训练的模型是否能够比本地数据更好地推广。从理论上分析了 MPDA 可以降低分布差异和过拟合风险。我们还广泛评估了公开的 MovieLens 20M 和亚马逊电子数据集，以及在30天内从移动淘宝收集的工业数据集。最后，我们建立了设备-隧道-云系统流水线，在移动淘宝的图标区域部署 MPDA 进行点进率预测，并进行在线 A/B 测试。离线和在线结果都表明，MPDA 仅在多个离线和在线指标的本地数据上优于基于云的学习和设备上培训的基线。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=On-Device+Learning+for+Model+Personalization+with+Large-Scale+Cloud-Coordinated+Domain+Adaption)|1|

We investigate privacy threats faced by recommender systems through the lens of membership inference. In such attacks, an adversary aims to infer whether a user's data is used to train the target recommender. To achieve this, previous work has used a shadow recommender to derive training data for the attack model, and then predicts the membership by calculating difference vectors between users' historical interactions and recommended items. State-of-the-art methods face two challenging problems: (i) training data for the attack model is biased due to the gap between shadow and target recommenders, and (ii) hidden states in recommenders are not observational, resulting in inaccurate estimations of difference vectors. To address the above limitations, we propose a Debiasing Learning for Membership Inference Attacks against recommender systems (DL-MIA) framework that has four main components: (i) a difference vector generator, (ii) a disentangled encoder, (iii) a weight estimator, and (iv) an attack model. To mitigate the gap between recommenders, a variational auto-encoder (VAE) based disentangled encoder is devised to identify recommender invariant and specific features. To reduce the estimation bias, we design a weight estimator, assigning a truth-level score for each difference vector to indicate estimation accuracy. We evaluate DL-MIA against both general recommenders and sequential recommenders on three real-world datasets. Experimental results show that DL-MIA effectively alleviates training and estimation biases simultaneously, and Íachieves state-of-the-art attack performance.|经验丰富的推荐系统可能无意中泄露有关其培训数据的信息，从而导致侵犯隐私。我们通过成员推理的视角来研究推荐系统所面临的隐私威胁。在这种攻击中，对手的目的是推断用户的数据是否被用来训练目标推荐器。为了实现这一目标，以前的工作是使用阴影推荐来获取攻击模型的训练数据，然后通过计算用户历史交互和推荐项目之间的差异向量来预测成员关系。最先进的方法面临两个具有挑战性的问题: (i)攻击模型的训练数据由于阴影和目标推荐器之间的差距而有偏差，以及(ii)推荐器中的隐藏状态不是观察性的，导致差异向量的估计不准确。为了解决上述局限性，我们提出了针对推荐系统(DL-MIA)的成员推断攻击的去偏学习框架，其具有四个主要组成部分: (i)差分矢量生成器，(ii)分离编码器，(iii)权重估计器和(iv)攻击模型。为了缩小推荐器之间的差距，设计了一种基于变分自动编码器(VAE)的解纠缠编码器来识别推荐器的不变性和特定特征。为了减少估计偏差，我们设计了一个权重估计器，为每个差异向量指定一个真值水平分数来表示估计的准确性。我们在三个真实世界的数据集上评估 DL-MIA 与通用推荐和顺序推荐的对比。实验结果表明，DL-MIA 同时有效地减小了训练偏差和估计偏差，并取得了一流的攻击性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Debiasing+Learning+for+Membership+Inference+Attacks+Against+Recommender+Systems)|1|

Therefore, pretrained language models (PLMs), like BERT and RoBERTa, may substantially contribute to the recommendation quality. However, it's extremely challenging to have news recommenders trained together with such big models: the learning of news recommenders requires intensive news encoding operations, whose cost is prohibitive if PLMs are used as the news encoder. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, SpeedyFeed, which efficiently trains PLMs-based news recommenders of superior quality. SpeedyFeed is highlighted for its light-weight encoding pipeline, which gives rise to three major advantages. Firstly, it makes the intermediate results fully reusable for the training workflow, which removes most of the repetitive but redundant encoding operations. Secondly, it improves the data efficiency of the training workflow, where non-informative data can be eliminated from encoding. Thirdly, it further saves the cost by leveraging simplified news encoding and compact news representation. SpeedyFeed leads to more than 100x acceleration of the training process, which enables big models to be trained efficiently and effectively over massive user data. The well-trained PLMs-based model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art news recommenders in comprehensive offline experiments. It is applied to Microsoft News to empower the training of large-scale production models, which demonstrate highly competitive online performances. SpeedyFeed is also a model-agnostic framework, thus being potentially applicable to a wide spectrum of content-based recommender systems.

Multimodal Federated Learning (MFL) is an emerging area allowing many distributed clients, each of which can collect data from multiple types of sensors, to participate in the training of some multimodal data-related models without sharing their data. In this paper, we address a novel challenging issue in MFL, the modality incongruity, where clients may have heterogeneous setups of sensors and their local data consists of different combinations of modalities. With the modality incongruity, clients may solve different tasks on different parameter spaces, which escalates the difficulties in dealing with the statistical heterogeneity problem of federated learning; also, it would be hard to perform accurate model aggregation across different types of clients. To tackle these challenges, in this work, we propose the FedMSplit framework, which allows federated training over multimodal distributed data without assuming similar active sensors in all clients. The key idea is to employ a dynamic and multi-view graph structure to adaptively capture the correlations amongst multimodal client models. More specifically, we split client models into smaller shareable blocks and allow each type of blocks to provide a specific view on client relationships. With the graph representation, the underlying correlations between clients can be captured as the edge features in the multi-view graph, and then be utilized to promote local model relations through the neighborhood message passing in the graph. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method under different sensor setups with statistical heterogeneity.|随着数据采集技术的进步，终端用户开始关注如何利用多类型数据的协同作用提升生活体验。多模态联邦学习(MFL)作为一个新兴领域，允许多个分布式客户端（每个客户端可通过多种传感器采集数据）在不共享本地数据的前提下，共同参与多模态相关模型的训练。本文针对MFL中一个新颖且具有挑战性的问题——模态异质性问题展开研究：客户端可能配备异构的传感器组合，其本地数据包含不同模态的组合形式。这种模态异质性问题导致客户端可能在不同的参数空间上处理不同任务，加剧了联邦学习中统计异构问题的处理难度；同时，跨不同类型客户端的精确模型聚合也面临巨大挑战。为解决这些问题，我们提出FedMSplit框架，该框架支持在多模态分布式数据上进行联邦训练，且无需假设所有客户端具有相同的活跃传感器配置。其核心思想是采用动态多视图图结构自适应地捕捉多模态客户端模型间的关联关系。具体而言，我们将客户端模型拆分为更小的可共享模块，使每类模块能够提供客户端关系的特定视图。通过图表示学习，客户端间的潜在关联被转化为多视图图中的边特征，并利用图中邻域消息传递机制来增强本地模型关联性。实验结果表明，在统计异构的不同传感器配置环境下，我们的方法均展现出卓越有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=FedMSplit:+Correlation-Adaptive+Federated+Multi-Task+Learning+across+Multimodal+Split+Networks)|1|

One way to study a graph is to focus on its spectrum, i.e., the eigenvalue distribution of its associated matrices. Recent advancements in spectral graph theory show that spectral moments of a network can be used to capture the network structure and various graph properties. However, sometimes networks with different structures or sizes can have the same or similar spectral moments, not to mention the existence of the cospectral graphs. To address such problems, we propose a 3D network representation that relies on the spectral information of subgraphs: the Spectral Path, a path connecting the spectral moments of the network and those of its subgraphs of different sizes. We show that the spectral path is interpretable and can capture relationship between a network and its subgraphs, for which we present a theoretical foundation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the spectral path in applications such as network visualization and network identification.|网络表示学习在网络研究中发挥着关键作用。研究图结构的一种重要方法是关注其谱特性，即关联矩阵的特征值分布。谱图理论的最新进展表明，网络谱矩能够有效捕捉网络结构和各类图属性。然而，不同结构或规模的网络可能具有相同或相似的谱矩，更不用说共谱图的存在。为解决这一问题，我们提出了一种基于子图谱信息的三维网络表示方法——谱路径，该路径通过连接原始网络及其不同规模子图的谱矩构成。我们证明谱路径具有可解释性，能够有效捕捉网络与其子图之间的关联关系，并为此提供了理论基础。通过网络可视化和网络识别等应用场景，我们验证了谱路径的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=A+Spectral+Representation+of+Networks:+The+Path+of+Subgraphs)|1|

There are recent works that have explored solutions on condensing image datasets through complex bi-level optimization. For instance, dataset condensation (DC) matches network gradients w.r.t. large-real data and small-synthetic data, where the network weights are optimized for multiple steps at each outer iteration. However, existing approaches have their inherent limitations: (1) they are not directly applicable to graphs where the data is discrete; and (2) the condensation process is computationally expensive due to the involved nested optimization. To bridge the gap, we investigate efficient dataset condensation tailored for graph datasets where we model the discrete graph structure as a probabilistic model. We further propose a one-step gradient matching scheme, which performs gradient matching for only one single step without training the network weights. Our theoretical analysis shows this strategy can generate synthetic graphs that lead to lower classification loss on real graphs. Extensive experiments on various graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. In particular, we are able to reduce the dataset size by 90% while approximating up to 98% of the original performance and our method is significantly faster than multi-step gradient matching (e.g. $15$× in CIFAR10 for synthesizing 500 graphs).|由于在大型数据集上训练深度学习模型耗时且资源密集，构建小型合成数据集以充分训练模型成为迫切需求。近期研究通过复杂的双层优化探索图像数据集压缩方案，例如数据集压缩（DC）技术通过匹配网络在大型真实数据与小型合成数据上的梯度实现压缩，其中网络权重在每个外部迭代中需经过多步优化。然而现有方法存在固有局限性：（1）无法直接适用于数据离散的图结构；（2）嵌套优化导致计算成本高昂。为弥补这一差距，我们研究针对图数据集的高效压缩方法，将离散图结构建模为概率模型。我们进一步提出单步梯度匹配方案，仅通过单步梯度匹配即可完成压缩，无需训练网络权重。理论分析表明该策略生成的合成图能在真实图上实现更低的分类损失。在多类图数据集上的实验证明了方法的有效性和高效性——在将数据集规模压缩90%的同时，仍可保持高达98%的原始性能，且速度显著优于多步梯度匹配方案（如在CIFAR10上合成500张图时速度提升15倍）。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Condensing+Graphs+via+One-Step+Gradient+Matching)|1|

A necessary step to visualize data is through creating suitable specifications in some declarative visualization languages (DVLs, e.g., Vega-Lite, ECharts). Due to the steep learning curve of mastering DVLs, automatically generating DVs via natural language questions, or text-to-vis, has been proposed and received great attention. However, existing neural network-based text-to-vis models, such as Seq2Vis or ncNet, usually generate DVs from scratch, limiting their performance due to the complex nature of this problem. Inspired by how developers reuse previously validated source code snippets from code search engines or a large-scale codebase when they conduct software development, we provide a novel hybrid retrieval-generation framework named RGVisNet for text-to-vis. It retrieves the most relevant DV query candidate as a prototype from the DV query codebase, and then revises the prototype to generate the desired DV query. Specifically, the DV query retrieval model is a neural ranking model which employs a schema-aware encoder for the NL question, and a GNN-based DV query encoder to capture the structure information of a DV query. At the same time, the DV query revision model shares the same structure and parameters of the encoders, and employs a DV grammar-aware decoder to reuse the retrieved prototype. Experimental evaluation on the public NVBench dataset validates that RGVisNet can significantly outperform existing generative text-to-vis models such as ncNet, by up to 74.28% relative improvement in terms of overall accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, RGVisNet is the first framework that seamlessly integrates the retrieval- with the generative-based approach for the text-to-vis task.|近年来，随着数据可视化系统成为传递海量数据背后洞察力的生动有力工具，其在学术界和工业界呈现蓬勃发展态势。实现数据可视化的必要步骤是通过声明式可视化语言（如Vega-Lite、ECharts）创建合适的规范。由于掌握这类语言存在较高学习门槛，基于自然语言问题自动生成可视化（即文本到可视化转换）的技术应运而生并广受关注。然而现有基于神经网络的文本到可视化模型（如Seq2Vis、ncNet）通常从零开始生成可视化方案，受限于该问题的复杂性，其性能存在明显瓶颈。受开发者从代码搜索引擎或大型代码库复用已验证代码片段的开发模式启发，我们提出了一种新颖的检索-生成混合框架RGVisNet。该框架首先从可视化查询代码库中检索最相关的候选原型，继而通过修订原型生成目标可视化查询。具体而言：可视化查询检索模型采用神经排序架构，使用模式感知编码器处理自然语言问题，并基于图神经网络的查询编码器捕捉可视化查询的结构信息；可视化查询修订模型共享编码器结构与参数，采用语法感知解码器实现原型复用。在公开基准NVBench上的实验表明，RGVisNet相比ncNet等生成式模型取得显著提升，整体准确率最高相对提升74.28%。据我们所知，这是首个将检索式与生成式方法无缝融合的文本到可视化转换框架。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=RGVisNet:+A+Hybrid+Retrieval-Generation+Neural+Framework+Towards+Automatic+Data+Visualization+Generation)|1|

We investigate the fixed-parameter tractability of these problems and show several negative hardness and inapproximability results, even when we afford exponential running time with respect to some parameters. Motivated by these results we identify natural parameters of the problem, and present fixed-parameter approximation algorithms with approximation ratios (1 + 2 over e + ∈) and (1 + 8 over e + ∈) for diversity-aware k-median and diversity-aware k-means respectively, and argue that these ratios are essentially tight assuming the gap-exponential time hypothesis.

Most CF methods utilize an encoder to embed users and items into the same representation space, and the Bayesian personalized ranking (BPR) loss is usually adopted as the objective function to learn informative encoders. Existing studies mainly focus on designing more powerful encoders (e.g., graph neural network) to learn better representations. However, few efforts have been devoted to investigating the desired properties of representations in CF, which is important to understand the rationale of existing CF methods and design new learning objectives. In this paper, we measure the representation quality in CF from the perspective of alignment and uniformity on the hypersphere. We first theoretically reveal the connection between the BPR loss and these two properties. Then, we empirically analyze the learning dynamics of typical CF methods in terms of quantified alignment and uniformity, which shows that better alignment or uniformity both contribute to higher recommendation performance. Based on the analyses results, a learning objective that directly optimizes these two properties is proposed, named DirectAU. We conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets, and the proposed learning framework with a simple matrix factorization model leads to significant performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art CF methods.|协同过滤（CF）在推荐系统发展中具有关键作用。大多数CF方法通过编码器将用户和项目嵌入到同一表示空间，并通常采用贝叶斯个性化排序（BPR）损失作为目标函数来学习信息编码器。现有研究主要集中于设计更强大的编码器（如图神经网络）以获取更好的表示，但鲜有工作深入探究协同过滤中表示质量应具备的特性，而这对于理解现有CF方法的原理和设计新的学习目标具有重要意义。本文从超球面对齐性（alignment）和均匀性（uniformity）的视角衡量CF中的表示质量：首先从理论层面揭示BPR损失与这两个特性之间的关联；进而通过量化指标实证分析典型CF方法在学习过程中的对齐性与均匀性变化，证明更好的对齐性或均匀性均有助提升推荐性能。基于分析结果，我们提出直接优化这两个特性的学习目标DirectAU。在三个公共数据集上的大量实验表明，采用简单矩阵分解模型的该学习框架相比最先进的CF方法能带来显著的性能提升。  （注：根据学术论文摘要的翻译规范，采用以下处理： 1. 专业术语保留英文缩写（CF/BPR）并与中文全称并列呈现 2.

To address this challenge, recently, many works introduce the meta-optimization idea into the recommendation scenarios, i.e. learning to learn the user preference by only a few past interaction items. The core idea is to learn global shared meta-initialization parameters for all users and rapidly adapt them into local parameters for each user respectively. They aim at deriving general knowledge across preference learning of various users, so as to rapidly adapt to the future new user with the learned prior and a small amount of training data. However, previous works have shown that recommender systems are generally vulnerable to bias and unfairness. Despite the success of meta-learning at improving the recommendation performance with cold-start, the fairness issues are largely overlooked. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive fair meta-learning framework, named CLOVER, for ensuring the fairness of meta-learned recommendation models. We systematically study three kinds of fairness - individual fairness, counterfactual fairness, and group fairness in the recommender systems, and propose to satisfy all three kinds via a multi-task adversarial learning scheme. Our framework offers a generic training paradigm that is applicable to different meta-learned recommender systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CLOVER on the representative meta-learned user preference estimator on three real-world data sets. Empirical results show that CLOVER achieves comprehensive fairness without deteriorating the overall cold-start recommendation performance.|在推荐系统中，冷启动问题是一个常见挑战——新用户与系统的交互行为极为有限。为应对这一挑战，近期研究将元优化思想引入推荐场景，即通过少量历史交互项实现用户偏好学习。其核心思想是为所有用户学习全局共享的元初始化参数，并快速将其分别适配至各用户的本地参数。该方法旨在从不同用户的偏好学习中提取通用知识，从而利用已学先验知识和少量训练数据快速适应新用户。然而已有研究表明，推荐系统普遍存在易受偏差与不公平性影响的缺陷。尽管元学习在提升冷启动推荐性能方面取得成效，其公平性问题却长期被忽视。本文提出名为CLOVER的综合公平元学习框架，用于确保元学习推荐模型的公平性。我们系统研究了推荐系统中个体公平性、反事实公平性和群体公平性三类公平问题，并通过多任务对抗学习方案实现三重公平保障。该框架提供适用于不同元学习推荐系统的通用训练范式，并在三个真实数据集上通过代表性元学习用户偏好估计器验证CLOVER的有效性。实验结果表明，CLOVER在保持冷启动推荐性能不衰减的前提下实现了全面公平保障。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Comprehensive+Fair+Meta-learned+Recommender+System)|1|

Such redundancies make the search process inefficient. We propose a graph-based search policy that eliminates the redundant explorations of any intermediate molecules.

The topological structures of real-world KGs, however, are rather heterogeneous, i.e., a KG is composed of multiple distinct hierarchies and non-hierarchical graph structures. Therefore, a homogeneous (either Euclidean or hyperbolic) geometry is not sufficient for fairly representing such heterogeneous structures. To capture the topological heterogeneity of KGs, we present an ultrahyperbolic KG embedding (UltraE) in an ultrahyperbolic (or pseudo-Riemannian) manifold that seamlessly interleaves hyperbolic and spherical manifolds. In particular, we model each relation as a pseudo-orthogonal transformation that preserves the pseudo-Riemannian bilinear form. The pseudo-orthogonal transformation is decomposed into various operators (i.e., circular rotations, reflections and hyperbolic rotations), allowing for simultaneously modeling heterogeneous structures as well as complex relational patterns.

The advantage of hyperbolic recommendation lies in that its exponentially increasing capacity is well-suited to describe the power-law distributed user-item network whereas the Euclidean equivalent is deficient. Nonetheless, it remains unclear which kinds of items can be effectively recommended by the hyperbolic model and which cannot. To address the above concerns, we take the most basic recommendation technique, collaborative filtering, as a medium, to investigate the behaviors of hyperbolic and Euclidean recommendation models. The results reveal that (1) tail items get more emphasis in hyperbolic space than that in Euclidean space, but there is still ample room for improvement; (2) head items receive modest attention in hyperbolic space, which could be considerably improved; (3) and nonetheless, the hyperbolic models show more competitive performance than Euclidean models. Driven by the above observations, we design a novel learning method, named hyperbolic informative collaborative learning (HICF), aiming to compensate for the recommendation effectiveness of the head item while at the same time improving the performance of the tail item. The main idea is to adapt the hyperbolic margin ranking learning, making its pull and push procedure geometric-aware, and providing informative guidance for the learning of both head and tail items. Extensive experiments back up the analytic findings and also show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

However, existing GNNs are not fully suitable for many real-world web applications. For example, over-smoothing may affect personalized recommendations and the lack of an explanation for the GNN prediction hind the understanding of many business scenarios. To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a new second-order continuous GNN which naturally avoids over-smoothing and enjoys better interpretability. There is some research interest in continuous graph neural networks inspired by the recent success of neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs). However, there are some remaining problems w.r.t. the prevailing first-order continuous GNN frameworks. Firstly, augmenting node features is an essential, however heuristic step for the numerical stability of current frameworks; secondly, first-order methods characterize a diffusion process, in which the over-smoothing effect w.r.t. node representations are intrinsic; and thirdly, there are some difficulties to integrate the topology of graphs into the ODEs. Therefore, we propose a framework employing second-order graph neural networks, which usually learn a less stiff transformation than the first-order counterpart. Our method can also be viewed as a coupled first-order model, which is easy to implement. We propose a semi-model-agnostic method based on our model to enhance the prediction explanation using high-order information.

However, existing approaches either assume that team formation is consistent throughout a match or assign formations frame-by-frame, which disagree with real situations. To tackle this issue, we propose a change-point detection framework named SoccerCPD that distinguishes tactically intended formation and role changes from temporary changes in soccer matches.

This paradigm enables efficient semantic retrieval. However, the single-vector representations can be ineffective at capturing different aspects of the queries and documents in relevance matching, especially for some vertical domains. For example, in e-commerce search, these aspects could be category, brand and color. Given a query ''white nike socks", a Dense Retrieval model may mistakenly retrieve some ''white adidas socks" while missing out the intended brand. We propose to explicitly represent multiple aspects using one embedding per aspect. We introduce an aspect prediction task to teach the model to capture aspect information with particular aspect embeddings. We design a lightweight network to fuse the aspect embeddings for representing queries and documents. Our evaluation using an e-commerce dataset shows impressive improvements over strong Dense Retrieval baselines. We also discover that the proposed aspect embeddings can enhance the interpretability of Dense Retrieval models as a byproduct.|以往的研究通常采用单向量表示（亦称嵌入）对查询项和文档进行编码，并借助近似最近邻搜索在嵌入空间执行检索。该范式虽能实现高效的语义检索，但在相关匹配中难以有效捕捉查询项与文档的多维度特征，尤其在特定垂直领域表现更为明显。以电商搜索为例，这些维度可能包含商品类别、品牌和颜色。当用户查询"白色耐克袜子"时，密集检索模型可能会错误返回"白色阿迪达斯袜子"，却遗漏了目标品牌。为此，我们提出为每个维度生成独立嵌入向量的多维度显式表征方案：通过引入维度预测任务，指导模型使用特定维度嵌入捕捉维度信息；设计轻量级网络融合各维度嵌入以表征查询项和文档。在电商数据集上的评估表明，该方法较现有强基线模型取得显著提升。我们还发现，所提出的维度嵌入表征能够作为副产品增强密集检索模型的可解释性。  注：本文在保持学术论文摘要严谨性的基础上，采用以下处理： 1. 将"aspect"译为"维度"而非字面意义的"方面"，更符合中文信息检索领域的术语习惯 2. 使用"嵌入"而非"向量表示"保持技术一致性 3. 对长难句进行合理切分，如将原文倒数第二句拆分为两个中文句子 4. 保留专业术语"基线模型(baselines)"的规范译法 5. 通过"为此""还发现"等连接词保持逻辑连贯性 6. 采用"范式""表征""可解释性"等学术用语保持文体统一|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Multi-Aspect+Dense+Retrieval)|1|

Graph embedding models, which can learn low-dimensional embeddings for nodes in the social graph to effectively represent the proximity between nodes, have been widely adopted for friend recommendations. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated superiority over shallow graph embedding methods, thanks to their ability to explicitly encode neighborhood context. This is also verified in our Xbox friend recommendation scenario, where some simplified GNNs, such as LightGCN and PPRGo, achieve the best performance. However, we observe that many GNN variants, including LightGCN and PPRGo, use a static and pre-defined normalizer in neighborhood aggregation, which is decoupled with the representation learning process and can cause the scale distortion issue. As a consequence, the true power of GNNs has not yet been fully demonstrated in friend recommendations. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective self-rescaling network (SSNet) to alleviate the scale distortion issue. At the core of SSNet is a generalized self-rescaling mechanism, which bridges the neighborhood aggregator's normalization with the node embedding learning process in an end-to-end framework. Meanwhile, we provide some theoretical analysis to help us understand the benefit of SSNet. We conduct extensive offline experiments on three large-scale real-world datasets. Results demonstrate that our proposed method can significantly improve the accuracy of various GNNs.

To recommend proper drugs, existing methods rely on various clinical records (e.g., diagnosis and procedures), which are commonly found in data such as electronic health records (EHRs). However, detailed records as such are often not available and the inputs might merely include a set of symptoms provided by doctors. Moreover, existing drug recommender systems usually treat drugs as individual items, ignoring the unique requirements that drug recommendation has to be done on a set of items (drugs), which should be as small as possible and safe without harmful drug-drug interactions (DDIs). To deal with the challenges above, in this paper, we propose a novel framework of Symptom-based Set-to-set Small and Safe drug recommendation (4SDrug). To enable set-to-set comparison, we design set-oriented representation and similarity measurement for both symptoms and drugs. Further, towards the symptom sets, we devise importance-based set aggregation to enhance the accuracy of symptom set representation; towards the drug sets, we devise intersection-based set augmentation to ensure smaller drug sets, and apply knowledge-based and data-driven penalties to ensure safer drug sets. Extensive experiments on two real-world EHR datasets, i.e., the public benchmark one of MIMIC-III and the industrial large-scale one of NELL, show drastic performance gains brought by 4SDrug, which outperforms all baselines in most effectiveness measures, while yielding the smallest sets of recommended drugs and 26.83% DDI rate reduction from the ground-truth data.|药物推荐是人工智能在医疗领域的重要应用任务。为提供准确的药物推荐，现有方法通常依赖电子健康记录（EHR）等数据中常见的各类临床记录（如诊断和治疗方案）。然而此类详细记录往往难以获取，实际输入可能仅包含医生提供的一组症状描述。此外，现有药物推荐系统通常将药物视为独立个体，忽略了药物推荐必须满足的特殊要求：推荐结果应为尽可能精简的药物组合，且需确保安全性以避免有害的药物相互作用（DDI）。为应对上述挑战，本文提出基于症状的集对集精简安全药物推荐创新框架（4SDrug）。为实现集合层面的匹配，我们设计了针对症状集和药物集的定向表征与相似度度量机制：对于症状集合，采用基于重要性的集合聚合方法以提升症状表征精度；对于药物集合，通过基于交集的集合扩增技术确保推荐药物集最小化，同时应用知识驱动与数据驱动的双重惩罚机制保障药物安全性。在MIMIC-III公共基准数据集和NELL工业级大规模数据集上的实验表明，4SDrug在多数效能指标上超越所有基线模型，其推荐药物集规模最小且DDI发生率较真实数据降低26.83%，展现出显著性能提升。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=4SDrug:+Symptom-based+Set-to-set+Small+and+Safe+Drug+Recommendation)|1|

However, most of the existing GNN models often need sufficient observed data to allow for effective learning and generalization. In real-world scenarios where complete input graph structure and sufficient node labels might not be achieved easily, GNN models would encounter with severe performance degradation. To address this problem, we propose WSGNN, short for weakly-supervised graph neural network. WSGNN is a flexible probabilistic generative framework which harnesses variational inference approach to solve graph semi-supervised learning in a label-structure joint estimation manner. It collaboratively learns task-related new graph structure and node representations through a two-branch network, and targets a composite variational objective derived from underlying data generation distribution concerning the inter-dependence between scarce observed data and massive missing data. Especially, under weakly-supervised low-data regime where labeled nodes and observed edges are both very limited, extensive experimental results on node classification and link prediction over common benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of WSGNN over strong competitors. Concretely, when only 1 label per class and 1% edges are observed on Cora, WSGNN maintains a decent 52.00% classification accuracy, exceeding GCN by 75.6%.|图神经网络（GNN）是解决图上半监督学习问题的重要方法之一。然而现有大多数GNN模型往往需要充足的观测数据才能实现有效学习与泛化。在现实场景中，当完整的输入图结构和充足节点标签难以获取时，GNN模型会出现严重的性能退化。针对此问题，我们提出弱监督图神经网络WSGNN——一个基于变分推理的灵活概率生成框架，通过标签-结构联合估计方式解决图上半监督学习问题。该框架通过双分支网络协同学习任务相关的新图结构与节点表示，并基于底层数据生成分布中稀缺观测数据与海量缺失数据间的相互依赖关系，推导出复合变分优化目标。特别是在标记节点和观测边都极其有限的弱监督低数据场景下，我们在节点分类和链路预测任务上对常用基准数据集进行了大量实验，结果表明WSGNN相较强基线模型展现出最先进的性能。具体而言，当Cora数据集每类仅1个标签且仅观测1%边时，WSGNN仍保持52.00%的分类准确率，较GCN模型提升75.6%。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Variational+Inference+for+Training+Graph+Neural+Networks+in+Low-Data+Regime+through+Joint+Structure-Label+Estimation)|1|
|[Pairwise Adversarial Training for Unsupervised Class-imbalanced Domain Adaptation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539243)|Weili Shi, Ronghang Zhu, Sheng Li|PhD student, Computer Science, University of Georgia; PhD student, University of Virginia, Charlottesville; Associate Professor, University of Virginia, Charlottesville|Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has become an appealing approach for knowledge transfer from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. However, when the classes in source and target domains are imbalanced, most existing UDA methods experience significant performance drop, as the decision boundary usually favors the majority classes. Some recent class-imbalanced domain adaptation (CDA) methods aim to tackle the challenge of biased label distribution by exploiting pseudo-labeled target samples during training process. However, these methods suffer from the issues with unreliable pseudo labels and error accumulation during training. In this paper, we propose a pairwise adversarial training approach for class-imbalanced domain adaptation. Unlike conventional adversarial training in which the adversarial samples are obtained from the lp ball of the original samples, we generate adversarial samples from the interpolated line of the aligned pairwise samples from source and target domains. The pairwise adversarial training (PAT) is a novel data-augmentation method which can be integrated into existing UDA models to tackle with the CDA problem. Experimental results and ablation studies show that the UDA models integrated with our method achieve considerable improvements on benchmarks compared with the original models as well as the state-of-the-art CDA methods.

|[TrajGAT: A Graph-based Long-term Dependency Modeling Approach for Trajectory Similarity Computation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539358)|Di Yao, Haonan Hu, Lun Du, Gao Cong, Shi Han, Jingping Bi|Nanyang Technol Univ, Singapore, Singapore; Microsoft Res Asia, Beijing, Peoples R China; Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Comp Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China|Computing trajectory similarities is a critical and fundamental task for various spatial-temporal applications, such as clustering, prediction, and anomaly detection. Traditional similarity metrics, i.e. DTW and Hausdorff, suffer from quadratic computation complexity, leading to their inability on large-scale data. To solve this problem, many trajectory representation learning techniques are proposed to approximate the metric space while reducing the complexity of similarity computation. Nevertheless, these works are designed based on RNN backend, resulting in a serious performance decline on long trajectories. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based method, namely TrajGAT, to explicitly model the hierarchical spatial structure and improve the performance of long trajectory similarity computation. TrajGAT consists of two main modules, i.e., graph construction and trajectory encoding. For graph construction, TrajGAT first employs PR quadtree to build the hierarchical structure of the whole spatial area, and then constructs a graph for each trajectory based on the original records and the leaf nodes of the quadtree. For trajectory encoding, we replace the self-attention in Transformer with graph attention and design an encoder to represent the generated graph trajectory. With these two modules, TrajGAT can capture the long-term dependencies of trajectories while reducing the GPU memory usage of Transformer. Our experiments on two real-life datasets show that TrajGAT not only improves the performance on long trajectories but also outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on mixture trajectories significantly.|轨迹相似度计算是时空聚类、预测及异常检测等应用中的核心基础任务。传统相似性度量方法（如动态时间规整DTW和豪斯多夫距离Hausdorff）存在二次计算复杂度问题，难以支撑大规模数据处理。针对这一局限性，学界提出了多种轨迹表示学习技术，在保持度量空间近似性的同时降低相似度计算复杂度。然而现有方法均基于循环神经网络（RNN）架构，导致长轨迹处理性能显著下降。本文提出一种新颖的图神经网络方法TrajGAT，通过显式建模层次化空间结构提升长轨迹相似度计算性能。TrajGAT包含两大核心模块：图构建模块与轨迹编码模块。在图构建阶段，系统首先采用PR四叉树建立全域层次化空间结构，随后基于原始轨迹数据与四叉树叶节点为每条轨迹构建专属图结构。在轨迹编码阶段，我们采用图注意力机制替代Transformer中的自注意力机制，设计出可表征图结构轨迹的编码器。通过这种双模块设计，TrajGAT在捕捉轨迹长期依赖关系的同时显著降低了Transformer的GPU内存占用。在两个真实数据集上的实验表明，TrajGAT不仅在长轨迹处理上性能优越，在混合轨迹场景下也显著超越现有最优方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=TrajGAT:+A+Graph-based+Long-term+Dependency+Modeling+Approach+for+Trajectory+Similarity+Computation)|1|

Nevertheless, dealing with long-tail products raises major open technical issues due to data scarcity which preclude the adoption of the mainstream approaches requiring usually a huge amount of data, such as, e.g., deep learning. In this paper, we provide a novel online learning algorithm for dynamic pricing that deals with non-stationary settings due to, e.g., the seasonality or adaptive competitors, and is very efficient in terms of the need for data thanks to assumptions such as, e.g., the monotonicity of the demand curve in the price that are customarily satisfied in long-tail markets. Furthermore, our dynamic pricing algorithm is paired with a clustering algorithm for the long-tail products which aggregates similar products such that the data of all the products of the same cluster are merged and used to choose their best price. We first evaluate our algorithms in an offline synthetic setting, comparing their performance with the state of the art and showing that our algorithms are more robust and data-efficient in long-tail settings. Subsequently, we evaluate our algorithms in an online setting with more than 8,000 products, including popular and long-tail, in an A/B test with humans for about two months.

|[PinnerFormer: Sequence Modeling for User Representation at Pinterest](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539156)|Nikil Pancha, Andrew Zhai, Jure Leskovec, Charles Rosenberg|; Pinterest Inc, San Francisco, CA 94107 USA|Sequential models have become increasingly popular in powering personalized recommendation systems over the past several years. These approaches traditionally model a user's actions on a website as a sequence to predict the user's next action. While theoretically simplistic, these models are quite challenging to deploy in production, commonly requiring streaming infrastructure to reflect the latest user activity and potentially managing mutable data for encoding a user's hidden state. Here we introduce PinnerFormer, a user representation trained to predict a user's future long-term engagement using a sequential model of a user's recent actions. Unlike prior approaches, we adapt our modeling to a batch infrastructure via our new dense all-action loss, modeling long-term future actions instead of next action prediction. We show that by doing so, we significantly close the gap between batch user embeddings that are generated once a day and realtime user embeddings generated whenever a user takes an action. We describe our design decisions via extensive offline experimentation and ablations and validate the efficacy of our approach in A/B experiments showing substantial improvements in Pinterest's user retention and engagement when comparing PinnerFormer against our previous user representation. PinnerFormer is deployed in production as of Fall 2021.|过去几年中，序列模型在个性化推荐系统中的应用日益广泛。这类方法传统上将用户在网站上的行为建模为序列，以预测用户的下一步行为。虽然理论简洁，但这些模型在实际部署中面临诸多挑战——通常需要流式基础设施来反映最新用户活动，并可能需要管理可变数据以编码用户的隐藏状态。本文推出PinnerFormer，这是一种通过用户近期行为序列模型来预测用户长期参与度的用户表征方法。与现有方法不同，我们通过新型密集全行为损失函数将建模适配至批处理基础设施，重点对长期未来行为而非即时下一步行为进行预测。研究表明，这种方法显著缩小了每日生成一次的批量用户嵌入与用户每次行动时实时生成的用户嵌入之间的性能差距。我们通过大量离线实验和消融分析阐释设计决策，并通过A/B实验验证方法有效性——与原有用户表征相比，PinnerFormer为Pinterest平台的用户留存率和参与度带来显著提升。该模型已于2021年秋季正式投入生产环境部署。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=PinnerFormer:+Sequence+Modeling+for+User+Representation+at+Pinterest)|1|
|[Open-Domain Aspect-Opinion Co-Mining with Double-Layer Span Extraction](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539386)|Mohna Chakraborty, Adithya Kulkarni, Qi Li|Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA|The aspect-opinion extraction tasks extract aspect terms and opinion terms from reviews. The supervised extraction methods achieve state-of-the-art performance but require large-scale human-annotated training data. Thus, they are restricted for open-domain tasks due to the lack of training data. This work addresses this challenge and simultaneously mines aspect terms, opinion terms, and their correspondence in a joint model. We propose an Open-Domain Aspect-Opinion Co-Mining (ODAO) method with a Double-Layer span extraction framework. Instead of acquiring human annotations, ODAO first generates weak labels for unannotated corpus by employing rules-based on universal dependency parsing. Then, ODAO utilizes this weak supervision to train a double-layer span extraction framework to extract aspect terms (ATE), opinion terms (OTE), and aspect-opinion pairs (AOPE). ODAO applies canonical correlation analysis as an early stopping indicator to avoid the model over-fitting to the noise to tackle the noisy weak supervision. ODAO applies a self-training process to gradually enrich the training data to tackle the weak supervision bias issue. We conduct extensive experiments and demonstrate the power of the proposed ODAO. The results on four benchmark datasets for aspect-opinion co-extraction and pair extraction tasks show that ODAO can achieve competitive or even better performance compared with the state-of-the-art fully supervised methods.|方面意见提取任务从评论中提取方面术语和意见术语。有监督的提取方法取得了最先进的性能，但需要大规模的人工注释的训练数据。因此，由于缺乏训练数据，它们在开放域任务中受到限制。这项工作解决了这个挑战，同时挖掘方面术语，意见术语，以及它们在联合模型中的对应关系。我们提出了一个开放领域的方面-意见共同挖掘(ODAO)方法与双层跨度提取框架。ODAO 不是获取人工注释，而是首先通过使用基于通用依赖解析的规则为未注释的语料库生成弱标签。然后，ODAO 利用这种弱监督训练一个双层跨度提取框架来提取方面术语(ATE)、观点术语(OTE)和方面-观点对(AOPE)。《噪音管制条例》采用典型相关分析作为及早停止的指标，以避免模型过分配合噪音，以对付噪音较大而监管薄弱的情况。ODAO 采用自我训练过程，逐步丰富训练数据，解决监督偏差问题。我们进行了广泛的实验，并演示了所提出的 ODAO 的功能。通过对四个基准数据集的侧面意见协同提取和对提取任务的实验结果表明，ODAO 算法可以获得比现有全监督算法更好的性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Open-Domain+Aspect-Opinion+Co-Mining+with+Double-Layer+Span+Extraction)|1|

Jensen|Aalborg Univ, Aalborg, Denmark; Zhejiang Univ, Ningbo, Peoples R China; Zhejiang Univ, Hangzhou, Peoples R China|Deep learning based trajectory similarity computation holds the potential for improved efficiency and adaptability over traditional similarity computation. However, existing learning-based trajectory similarity learning solutions prioritize spatial similarity over temporal similarity, making them suboptimal for time-aware analyses. To this end, we propose ST2Vec, a representation learning based solution that considers fine-grained spatial and temporal relations between trajectories to enable spatio-temporal similarity computation in road networks. Specifically, ST2Vec encompasses two steps: (i) spatial and temporal modeling that encode spatial and temporal information of trajectories, where a generic temporal modeling module is proposed for the first time; and (ii) spatio-temporal co-attention fusion, where two fusion strategies are designed to enable the generation of unified spatio-temporal embeddings of trajectories. Further, under the guidance of triplet loss, ST2Vec employs curriculum learning in model optimization to improve convergence and effectiveness. An experimental study offers evidence that ST2Vec outperforms state-of-the-art competitors substantially in terms of effectiveness and efficiency, while showing low parameter sensitivity and good model robustness. Moreover, similarity involved case studies including top-k querying and DBSCAN clustering offer further insight into the capabilities of ST2Vec.|基于深度学习的轨迹相似度计算有望比传统相似度计算方法提升效率与适应性。然而现有基于学习的轨迹相似度解决方案往往侧重空间相似性而忽视时间相似性，导致其在时间敏感分析中表现欠佳。为此，我们提出ST2Vec——一种基于表征学习的解决方案，通过细粒度捕捉轨迹间的时空关联关系，实现路网环境下的时空相似度计算。具体而言，ST2Vec包含两个核心步骤：(i) 时空建模阶段首次提出通用时序建模模块，对轨迹的空间与时间信息进行编码；(ii) 时空协同注意力融合阶段设计两种融合策略，生成统一的轨迹时空嵌入向量。在三元组损失函数的指导下，该模型采用课程学习策略进行优化以提升收敛速度与效果。实验研究表明，ST2Vec在效果与效率方面显著优于现有先进方案，同时展现出较低的参数敏感度和良好的模型鲁棒性。此外，通过top-k查询和DBSCAN聚类等涉及相似度计算的案例研究，进一步验证了ST2Vec的实际应用能力。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Spatio-Temporal+Trajectory+Similarity+Learning+in+Road+Networks)|1|

Conventional data-driven approaches for cash-out detection commonly construct a classifier with domain specific feature engineering. To further spot cash-out behaviors in complex scenarios, recent efforts adopt graph models to exploit the interaction relations rich in financial transactions. However, most existing graph-based methods are proposed for online payment activities in internet financial institutions. Moreover, these methods commonly rely on a large amount of online user data, which are not well suitable for the traditional credit card services in commercial banks. In this paper, we focus on discerning fraudulent cash-out users by taking advantage of only the personal credit card data from banks. To alleviate the scarcity of available labeled data, we formulate the cash-out detection problem as identifying dense blocks. First, we define a bipartite multigraph to hold transactions between users and merchants, where cash-out activities generate cyclically intensive and high-volume flows. Second, we give a formal definition of cash-out behaviors from four perspectives: time, capital, cyclicity, and topotaxy. Then, we develop ANTICO, with a class of metrics to capture suspicious signals of the activities and a greedy algorithm to spot suspicious blocks by optimizing the proposed metric. Theoretical analysis shows a provable upper bound of ANTICO on the effectiveness of detecting cash-out users. Experimental results show that ANTICO outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accurately detecting cash-out users on both synthetic and real-world banking data.|套现欺诈指通过非法商户交易进行信用卡资金套取的行为。传统数据驱动检测方法通常需依赖领域特定的特征工程来构建分类器。为应对复杂场景下的套现行为识别，近期研究开始采用图模型挖掘金融交易中丰富的交互关系。然而现有图方法多针对互联网金融平台的线上支付活动设计，且严重依赖大量线上用户数据，难以适用于商业银行传统信用卡业务场景。本文聚焦于仅利用银行个人信用卡数据识别欺诈性套现用户。为缓解标注数据稀缺问题，我们将套现检测任务形式化为稠密块识别问题：首先构建用户-商户二分多重图建模交易关系，其中套现行为会形成周期性密集大额资金流；继而从时间、资金、周期性和拓扑结构四个维度给出套现行为的形式化定义；随后提出ANTICO模型，通过设计综合指标捕捉可疑活动信号，并采用贪心算法优化指标以定位可疑区块。理论分析证明ANTICO在检测效果上具有可证明的上界。实验结果表明，在合成与真实银行数据上，ANTICO在套现用户检测准确率方面均优于现有先进方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Detecting+Cash-out+Users+via+Dense+Subgraphs)|1|

Existing works achieve this goal by leveraging the exact matching method to identify the lexical matching between the question words and the schema items. However, these methods fail in other challenging scenarios, such as the synonym substitution in which the surface form differs between the corresponding question words and schema items. In this paper, we propose a framework named ISESL-SQL to iteratively build a semantic enhanced schema-linking graph between question tokens and database schemas. First, we extract a schema linking graph from PLMs through a probing procedure in an unsupervised manner. Then the schema linking graph is further optimized during the training process through a deep graph learning method. Meanwhile, we also design an auxiliary task called graph regularization to improve the schema information mentioned in the schema-linking graph. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that ISESL-SQL could consistently outperform the baselines and further investigations show its generalizability and robustness.|文本转SQL系统旨在将人类自然语言解析为SQL语句，其对新数据库的泛化能力至关重要。现有研究通过精确匹配方法识别问题词与模式项之间的词汇匹配来实现这一目标，但该方法在对应问题词与模式项存在表层形式差异（如同义词替换）等挑战性场景中表现不佳。本文提出ISESL-SQL框架，通过迭代式构建问题词与数据库模式间的语义增强模式链接图。首先以无监督方式通过探针过程从预训练语言模型中提取模式链接图，随后通过深度图学习方法在训练过程中持续优化该图结构。同时，我们设计了图正则化辅助任务以增强模式链接图中提及的模式信息。在三个基准测试上的大量实验表明，ISESL-SQL能够持续超越基线模型，进一步研究验证了其良好的泛化能力和鲁棒性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Semantic+Enhanced+Text-to-SQL+Parsing+via+Iteratively+Learning+Schema+Linking+Graph)|1|

This learning setting limits the applicability and availability of many Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. We generalize the learning task under such setting as a semi-supervised drifted stream learning with short lookback problem (SDSL). SDSL imposes two under-addressed challenges on existing methods in semi-supervised learning and continuous learning: 1) robust pseudo-labeling under gradual shifts and 2) anti-forgetting adaptation with short lookback. To tackle these challenges, we propose a principled and generic generation-replay framework to solve SDSL. To achieve robust pseudo-labeling, we develop a novel pseudo-label classification model to leverage supervised knowledge of previously labeled data, unsupervised knowledge of new data, and, structure knowledge of invariant label semantics. To achieve adaptive anti-forgetting model replay, we propose to view the anti-forgetting adaptation task as a flat region search problem. We propose a novel minimax game-based replay objective function to solve the flat region search problem and develop an effective optimization solver.

The LOB is an event-based continuously-updating system that records contemporaneous demand (`bids' to buy) and supply (`asks' to sell) for a financial asset. Following recent successes in the literature that combine stochastic point processes with neural networks to model event stream patterns, we propose a novel state-dependent parallel neural Hawkes process to predict LOB events and simulate realistic LOB data. The model is characterized by: (1) separate intensity rate modelling for each event type through a parallel structure of continuous time LSTM units; and (2) an event-state interaction mechanism that improves prediction accuracy and enables efficient sampling of the event-state stream. We first demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over traditional stochastic or deep learning models for predicting event type and time of a real world LOB dataset. Using stochastic point sampling from a well trained model, we then develop a realistic deep learning-based LOB simulator that exhibits multiple stylized facts found in real LOB data.|金融市场中的交易主要通过限价订单簿（LOB）执行。LOB是一种基于事件的持续更新系统，记录金融资产当前的需求（买入"报价"）与供给（卖出"要价"）。近年来学界成功将随机点过程与神经网络结合以建模事件流模式，基于此我们提出一种新颖的状态依赖型并行神经霍克斯过程，用于预测LOB事件并生成逼真的LOB数据。该模型具有两大特征：（1）通过并行连续时间LSTM单元结构，为每种事件类型建立独立的强度率模型；（2）采用事件-状态交互机制，既提升预测精度又实现事件-状态流的高效采样。我们首先证明该模型在预测真实LOB数据集的事件类型和发生时间方面，优于传统随机模型或深度学习模型。通过从训练完善的模型中进行随机点采样，我们进一步开发出基于深度学习的逼真LOB模拟器，该模拟器呈现出真实LOB数据中存在的多重典型特征。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=State+Dependent+Parallel+Neural+Hawkes+Process+for+Limit+Order+Book+Event+Stream+Prediction+and+Simulation)|1|

The accumulation of large amounts of data in many domains, such as healthcare and e-commerce, has led to increased interest in developing data-driven algorithms for estimating heterogeneous effects from observational and experimental data. However, these methods often make strong assumptions about the observed features and ignore the underlying causal model structure, which can lead to biased HTE estimation. At the same time, accounting for the causal structure of real-world data is rarely trivial since the causal mechanisms that gave rise to the data are typically unknown. To address this problem, we develop a feature selection method that considers each feature's value for HTE estimation and learns the relevant parts of the causal structure from data. We provide strong empirical evidence that our method improves existing data-driven HTE estimation methods under arbitrary underlying causal structures. Our results on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets show that our feature selection algorithm leads to lower HTE estimation error.|估计处理对个体单元的影响，即异质性处理效应（HTE）估计，是决策和政策实施的关键环节。随着医疗健康和电子商务等领域大规模数据的积累，利用观察性和实验性数据开发数据驱动的异质性效应估计算法受到日益广泛的关注。然而这些方法通常对观测特征做出强假设，且忽略底层因果模型结构，可能导致HTE估计出现偏差。与此同时，由于生成数据的因果机制通常未知，处理现实世界数据的因果结构往往具有挑战性。针对这一问题，我们开发了一种特征选择方法，该方法综合考虑每个特征对HTE估计的价值，并从数据中学习因果结构的相关部分。我们提供了强有力的实证证据，表明在任意底层因果结构下，我们的方法能改进现有数据驱动的HTE估计方法。通过在合成数据、半合成数据和真实数据集上的实验验证，我们的特征选择算法显著降低了HTE估计误差。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Improving+Data-driven+Heterogeneous+Treatment+Effect+Estimation+Under+Structure+Uncertainty)|1|

Exploring hidden topics within documents and discovering key words associated with each topic allow us to develop a semantic interpretation of the corpus. Moreover, documents are usually associated with authors. For example, news reports have journalists specializing in writing certain type of events, academic papers have authors with expertise in certain research topics, etc. Modeling authorship information could benefit topic modeling, since documents by the same authors tend to reveal similar semantics. This observation also holds for documents published on the same venues. However, most topic models ignore the auxiliary authorship and publication venues. Given above two challenges, we propose a Variational Graph Author Topic Model for documents to integrate both semantic interpretability and authorship and venue modeling into a unified VGAE framework. For authorship and venue modeling, we construct a hierarchical multi-layered document graph with both intra- and cross-layer topic propagation. For semantic interpretability, three word relations (contextual, syntactic, semantic) are modeled and constitute three word sub-layers in the document graph. We further propose three alternatives for variational divergence. Experiments verify the effectiveness of our model on supervised and unsupervised tasks.|尽管变分图自编码器（VGAE）在文档表征学习方面展现出强大能力，但现有方法大多未对潜在主题结构建模，导致语义可解释性不足。通过挖掘文档中的隐藏主题并识别各主题关联关键词，可实现语料库的语义解析。此外，文档通常与作者相关联——新闻报道由专攻特定事件类型的记者撰写，学术论文的作者则深耕特定研究领域。由于同一作者的文档往往呈现相似语义特征，作者信息建模有助于提升主题建模效果，这一规律同样适用于同一发布场所的文档。然而现有主题模型普遍忽略作者与发布场所这类辅助信息。  针对上述两个挑战，我们提出面向文档的变分图作者主题模型，将语义可解释性、作者及发布场所建模统一整合至VGAE框架中。在作者与场所建模方面，我们构建了具有层内与跨层主题传播的分层多文档图；在语义可解释性方面，通过建模三种词关系（上下文、句法、语义）构建文档图中的三个词子层。我们进一步提出三种变分散度的替代方案。实验结果表明，该模型在监督与非监督任务中均具有卓越性能。  （注：根据学术翻译规范，对以下术语进行标准化处理： - Variational Graph Auto-Encoder → 变分图自编码器 - semantic interpretability → 语义可解释性 - topic propagation → 主题传播 - variational divergence → 变分散度 - supervised/unsupervised tasks → 监督/非监督任务 保留专业缩写VGAE，采用中文学术文献常用的四字结构表达）|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Variational+Graph+Author+Topic+Modeling)|1|

Existing log-based anomaly detection approaches rely on a few key assumptions on system logs and perform well in some experimental systems. However, real-world industrial systems are often with poor logging quality, in which system logs are noisy and often violate the assumptions of existing approaches. This makes these approaches inefficient. This paper first conducts a comprehensive study on the system logs of three large-scale industrial software systems. Through the study, we identify four typical anti-patterns that affect the detection results the most. Based on these patterns, we propose HiLog, an effective human-in-the-loop log-based anomaly detection approach that integrates human knowledge to augment anomaly detection models.

However, current understanding of the AgN-DNA genome is still limited. Only a minority of DNA sequences produce highly fluorescent AgN-DNAs, and the bulky DNA strands and complex DNA-silver interactions make it challenging to use first principles chemical calculations to understand and design AgN-DNAs. Thus, a major challenge for researchers studying these nanomaterials is to develop methods to employ observational data about studied AgN-DNAs to design new nanoclusters for targeted applications. In this work, we present an approach to design AgN-DNAs by employing variational autoencoders (VAEs) as generative models. Specifically, we employ an LSTM-based β-VAE architecture and regularize its latent space to correlate with AgN-DNA properties such as color and brightness. The regularization is adaptive to skewed sample distributions of available observational data along our design axes of properties. We employ our model for design of AgN-DNAs in the near-infrared (NIR) band, where relatively few AgN-DNAs have been observed to date. Wet lab experiments validate that when employed for designing new AgN-DNAs, our model significantly shifts the distribution of AgN-DNA colors towards the NIR while simultaneously achieving bright fluorescence. This work shows that VAE-based generative models are well-suited for the design of AgN-DNAs with multiple targeted properties, with significant potential to advance the promising applications of these nanomaterials for bioimaging, biosensing, and other critical technologies.|DNA稳定的银纳米簇（AgN-DNAs）是由10-30个银原子通过短链合成DNA模板结合形成的纳米材料。因其尺寸微小、与DNA天然兼容且具有明亮的荧光特性（即吸收光线并重新发射不同颜色光线的能力），这类材料在生物传感和荧光标记领域展现出巨大潜力。DNA模板序列如同AgN-DNAs的"基因组"，通过调控封装银纳米簇的尺寸来决定其荧光颜色。然而目前对AgN-DNA基因组的认知仍十分有限：仅有少数DNA序列能产生高荧光性AgN-DNAs，且庞大的DNA链与复杂的银-DNA相互作用使得第一性原理化学计算方法难以有效解析和设计该类材料。因此，如何利用现有观测数据设计具有特定功能的新型纳米簇成为该领域研究者面临的重要挑战。  本研究提出采用变分自编码器（VAE）作为生成模型的设计方法。具体而言，我们采用基于LSTM架构的β-VAE模型，并通过正则化其潜在空间使其与AgN-DNA的光学特性（如颜色和亮度）建立关联。该正则化方法能自适应地调整观测数据在目标设计维度上的偏态分布。我们将该模型应用于近红外波段（NIR）AgN-DNAs的设计——该波段目前观测到的AgN-DNAs数量极为有限。湿实验验证表明，通过模型设计的新型AgN-DNAs其颜色分布显著向近红外波段偏移，同时实现了明亮的荧光发射。这项工作证明基于VAE的生成模型特别适用于设计具有多重目标特性的AgN-DNAs，对于推进该类纳米材料在生物成像、生物传感等关键技术领域的应用具有重要潜力。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=DNA-Stabilized+Silver+Nanocluster+Design+via+Regularized+Variational+Autoencoders)|1|

|[A Graph Learning Based Framework for Billion-Scale Offline User Identification](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539191)|Daixin Wang, Zujian Weng, Zhengwei Wu, Zhiqiang Zhang, Peng Cui, Hongwei Zhao, Jun Zhou|Ant Grp, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China|Offline user identification is a scenario that users use their bio-information like faces as identification in offline venues, which has been applied in many offline scenarios such as verification in banks, check-in in hotels and making a purchase in offline merchants. In such a scenario, designing an identification approach to do extremely accurate offline user identification is critical. Most scenarios use faces to identify users and previous algorithms are mainly based on visual features and computer-vision models. However, due to the large variations such as pose, illumination and occlusions in offline scenarios, it remains a challenging problem for existing computer-vision algorithms to get a satisfying accuracy in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, billion-scale candidate users also require high efficiency and high accuracy for the approach. In offline scenarios, users, venues and their different kinds of interactions can form a heterogeneous graph. Mining the graph can tell much information about users' offline habits and behaviors, which can be regarded as a great information supplement for user identification. In this paper, we elaborately design an offline identification framework considering two aspects. First, given a scanning face, we propose a 'local-global' retrieval mechanism to find one user from billion-scale candidate users. Second and most importantly, to make the verification between the scanning face, the retrieved user and the venue, we propose a novel Wide & Deep Based Graph Convolution Network to model both the visual information and the heterogeneous graph. Extensive offline and online A/B experimental results on a real-world industrial dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Nowadays, the whole approach has been deployed to serve billion-scale users to do offline identification in the industrial production environment.|离线用户识别是指用户在实体场所通过人脸等生物信息进行身份认证的场景，目前已广泛应用于银行身份核验、酒店入住登记和实体门店购物等线下场景。在此类场景中，设计能够实现极高准确率的离线用户识别方案至关重要。现有方案多采用人脸识别技术，传统算法主要基于视觉特征和计算机视觉模型。然而由于线下场景中存在姿态、光照、遮挡等巨大差异，现有计算机视觉算法在实际场景中难以达到理想准确率。此外，亿级规模的候选用户库对识别方案的高效性与准确性提出了更高要求。在离线场景中，用户、场所及其多元交互行为可构成异质图网络，通过对该网络的挖掘可深入理解用户线下习惯与行为模式，这为用户识别提供了重要的信息补充。本文从两个维度精心设计了离线识别框架：首先针对采集的人脸图像，提出"局部-全局"两级检索机制从亿级候选用户中快速定位目标用户；更重要的是，为实现采集人脸、检索结果与场所的三方验证，我们创新性地提出基于Wide&Deep的图卷积网络，同时融合视觉信息与异质图数据。在真实工业数据集上的大量离线实验及在线A/B测试结果表明，本方案具有显著优越性。目前该完整方案已部署于工业生产环境，为亿级用户提供离线身份识别服务。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=A+Graph+Learning+Based+Framework+for+Billion-Scale+Offline+User+Identification)|1|

These simulations are pivotal in industrial applications such as petroleum production, where fast and accurate models are needed for high-stake decision making, for example, for well placement optimization and field development planning. Classical finite difference numerical simulators require massive computational resources to model large-scale real-world reservoirs. Alternatively, streamline simulators and data-driven surrogate models are computationally more efficient by relying on approximate physics models, however they are insufficient to model complex reservoir dynamics at scale. Here we introduce Hybrid Graph Network Simulator (HGNS), which is a data-driven surrogate model for learning reservoir simulations of 3D subsurface fluid flows. To model complex reservoir dynamics at both local and global scale, HGNS consists of a subsurface graph neural network (SGNN) to model the evolution of fluid flows, and a 3D-U-Net to model the evolution of pressure. HGNS is able to scale to grids with millions of cells per time step, two orders of magnitude higher than previous surrogate models, and can accurately predict the fluid flow for tens of time steps (years into the future). Using an industry-standard subsurface flow dataset (SPE-10) with 1.1 million cells, we demonstrate that HGNS is able to reduce the inference time up to 18 times compared to standard subsurface simulators, and that it outperforms other learning-based models by reducing long-term prediction errors by up to 21%.|地下模拟通过计算模型预测流体（如油、水、气）在多孔介质中的流动。这类模拟在石油开采等工业应用中具有关键作用，其快速精确的建模能力直接影响钻井位置优化和油田开发规划等高风险决策。传统有限差分数值模拟器需消耗大量计算资源来建模大规模实际储层；流线模拟器和数据驱动代理模型虽通过近似物理模型提升计算效率，但难以有效模拟复杂的大规模储层动态。本研究提出混合图网络模拟器（HGNS），这是一种数据驱动的代理模型，可学习三维地下流体流动的储层模拟。为同步实现局部与全局尺度下的复杂储层动态建模，HGNS采用地下图神经网络（SGNN）模拟流体流动演化，并利用3D-U型网络模拟压力演化。该模型可扩展至单时间步百万级网格的模拟规模（较先前代理模型提升两个数量级），并能精准预测数十个时间步（未来数年）的流体流动趋势。基于包含110万个网格单元的行业标准地下流动数据集（SPE-10），我们证明HGNS相比标准地下模拟器可将推理时间缩短最多18倍，同时通过将长期预测误差降低最多21%，其性能显著优于其他基于学习的模型。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Learning+Large-scale+Subsurface+Simulations+with+a+Hybrid+Graph+Network+Simulator)|1|

Feature selection improves the generalization ability of learning system via selecting essential features for classification from the original feature set, while the task of partial label feature selection is challenging due to ambiguous labeling information. In this paper, the first attempt towards partial label feature selection is investigated via mutual-information-based dependency maximization. Specifically, the proposed approach SAUTE iteratively maximizes the dependency between selected features and labeling information, where the value of mutual information is estimated from confidence-based latent variable inference. In each iteration, the near-optimal features are selected greedily according to properties of submodular mutual information function, while the density of latent label variable is inferred with the help of updated labeling confidences over candidate labels by resorting to kNN aggregation in the induced lower-dimensional feature space. Extensive experiments over synthetic as well as real-world partial label data sets show that the generalization ability of well-established partial label learning algorithms can be significantly improved after coupling with the proposed feature selection approach.|部分标签学习从训练样本中归纳出一个多类分类器，每个样本与一个隐藏地面真实标签的候选标签集相关联。特征选择通过从原始特征集中选择分类所需的基本特征来提高学习系统的泛化能力，而部分标记特征选择则由于标记信息不明确而面临挑战。本文首次研究了基于互信息的依赖最大化方法在部分标签特征选择中的应用。特别地，提出的方法 SAUTE 迭代地最大化选择的特征和标记信息之间的依赖性，其中互信息的价值是估计基于置信度的潜变量推断。在每次迭代中，根据子模互信息函数的性质贪婪地选择接近最优的特征，利用诱导的低维特征空间中的 kNN 聚集，借助候选标签上更新的标签置信度推断潜在标签变量的密度。通过对合成和实际部分标签数据集的大量实验表明，与所提出的特征选择方法相结合，可以显著提高已有部分标签学习算法的泛化能力。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Submodular+Feature+Selection+for+Partial+Label+Learning)|1|
|[Practical Lossless Federated Singular Vector Decomposition over Billion-Scale Data](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539402)|Di Chai, Leye Wang, Junxue Zhang, Liu Yang, Shuowei Cai, Kai Chen, Qiang Yang|Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China; Peking University, Beijing, China|With the enactment of privacy-preserving regulations, e.g., GDPR, federated SVD is proposed to enable SVD-based applications over different data sources without revealing the original data. However, many SVD-based applications cannot be well supported by existing federated SVD solutions. The crux is that these solutions, adopting either differential privacy (DP) or homomorphic encryption (HE), suffer from accuracy loss caused by unremovable noise or degraded efficiency due to inflated data. In this paper, we propose FedSVD, a practical lossless federated SVD method over billion-scale data, which can simultaneously achieve lossless accuracy and high efficiency. At the heart of FedSVD is a lossless matrix masking scheme delicately designed for SVD: 1) While adopting the masks to protect private data, FedSVD completely removes them from the final results of SVD to achieve lossless accuracy; and 2) As the masks do not inflate the data, FedSVD avoids extra computation and communication overhead during the factorization to maintain high efficiency. Experiments with real-world datasets show that FedSVD is over 10000x faster than the HE-based method and has 10 orders of magnitude smaller error than the DP-based solution (ε=0.1, δ=0.1) on SVD tasks. We further build and evaluate FedSVD over three real-world applications: principal components analysis (PCA), linear regression (LR), and latent semantic analysis (LSA), to show its superior performance in practice. On federated LR tasks, compared with two state-of-the-art solutions: FATE [17] and SecureML [19], FedSVD-LR is 100x faster than SecureML and 10x faster than FATE.|随着 GDPR 等隐私保护规则的制定，联邦奇异值分解被提出，以使基于奇异值分解的应用能够在不同数据源之间进行而不暴露原始数据。然而，现有的联邦 SVD 解决方案不能很好地支持许多基于 SVD 的应用程序。问题的关键是，这些解决方案，无论是采用差分隐私(DP)或同态加密(HE) ，都会受到不可去除的噪声或因数据膨胀而导致效率降低所造成的精度损失。在本文中，我们提出了 FedSVD，一种实用的无损联邦 SVD 方法，它可以同时达到无损精度和高效率。FedSVD 的核心是一种为 SVD 精心设计的无损矩阵掩蔽方案: 1)在采用掩蔽保护私有数据的同时，FedSVD 从 SVD 的最终结果中完全去除掩蔽，以实现无损精度; 2)由于掩蔽不会使数据膨胀，FedSVD 避免了因子分解过程中的额外计算和通信开销，保持了高效率。实际数据集的实验表明，在奇异值分解任务中，FedSVD 比基于 HE 的方法快10000倍以上，并且比基于 DP 的方法(ε = 0.1，δ = 0.1)误差小10数量级。我们进一步构建和评估 FedSVD 在三个现实世界中的应用: 主成分分析(PCA)、线性回归分析(LR)和潜在语义学分析(LSA) ，以显示其在实践中的卓越性能。在联邦 LR 任务上，与 FATE [17]和 SecureML [19]这两种最先进的解决方案相比，FedSVD-LR 比 SecureML 快100倍，比 FATE 快10倍。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Practical+Lossless+Federated+Singular+Vector+Decomposition+over+Billion-Scale+Data)|1|

Very recently, it has been demonstrated that integrating logical rules into regular learning tasks can further enhance learning performance in a label-efficient manner. Many attempts have been made to learn logical rules automatically from knowledge graphs (KGs). However, a majority of existing methods entirely rely on observed rule instances to define the score function for rule evaluation and thus lack generalization ability and suffer from severe computational inefficiency. Instead of completely relying on rule instances for rule evaluation, RLogic defines a predicate representation learning-based scoring model, which is trained by sampled rule instances. In addition, RLogic incorporates one of the most significant properties of logical rules, the deductive nature, into rule learning, which is critical especially when a rule lacks supporting evidence. To push deductive reasoning deeper into rule learning, RLogic breaks a big sequential model into small atomic models in a recursive way.

Gupta, Dezhi Hong|Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Amazon, Seattle, WA 98109 USA|Time-series data contains temporal order information that can guide representation learning for predictive end tasks (e.g., classification, regression). Recently, there are some attempts to leverage such order information to first pre-train time-series models by reconstructing time-series values of randomly masked time segments, followed by an end-task fine-tuning on the same dataset, demonstrating improved end-task performance. However, this learning paradigm decouples data reconstruction from the end task. We argue that the representations learnt in this way are not informed by the end task and may, therefore, be sub-optimal for the end-task performance. In fact, the importance of different timestamps can vary significantly in different end tasks. We believe that representations learnt by reconstructing important timestamps would be a better strategy for improving end-task performance. In this work, we propose TARNet, Task-Aware Reconstruction Network, a new model using Transformers to learn task-aware data reconstruction that augments end-task performance. Specifically, we design a data-driven masking strategy that uses self-attention score distribution from end-task training to sample timestamps deemed important by the end task. Then, we mask out data at those timestamps and reconstruct them, thereby making the reconstruction task-aware. This reconstruction task is trained alternately with the end task at every epoch, sharing parameters in a single model, allowing the representation learnt through reconstruction to improve end-task performance.

Recently, there have been rising concerns on the distributional discrepancies across different clients, which could even cause counterproductive consequences when collaborating with others. While it is not necessarily that collaborating with all clients will achieve the best performance, in this paper, we study a rational collaboration called ``collaboration equilibrium'' (CE), where smaller collaboration coalitions are formed. Each client collaborates with certain members who maximally improve the model learning and isolates the others who make little contribution. We propose the concept of benefit graph which describes how each client can benefit from collaborating with other clients and advance a Pareto optimization approach to identify the optimal collaborators. Then we theoretically prove that we can reach a CE from the benefit graph through an iterative graph operation. Our framework provides a new way of setting up collaborations in a research network. Experiments on both synthetic and real world data sets are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.|联邦学习（FL）指在保护隐私的前提下，通过多客户端协作研究网络进行模型训练的范式。近年来，研究者日益关注不同客户端间的分布差异问题——这种差异可能导致协作产生反效果。由于与所有客户端协作未必能获得最佳性能，本文研究了一种称为"协作均衡"（CE）的理性协作机制，通过形成较小规模的协作联盟，使每个客户端仅与能最大程度提升模型性能的成员协作，同时隔离贡献微薄的参与者。我们提出"收益图"概念来描述客户端间的协作收益关系，并采用帕累托优化方法确定最优协作对象。通过理论证明，我们能够通过迭代图操作从收益图中实现协作均衡。该框架为研究网络中的协作建立提供了新范式。在合成数据集和真实数据集上的实验验证了该方法的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Collaboration+Equilibrium+in+Federated+Learning)|1|

These methods rely on historical labeled data and cannot accurately predict events when data are limited or of poor quality. Studying causal effects between events goes beyond correlation analysis and can contribute to a more robust prediction of events. However, incorporating causality analysis in data-driven event forecasting is challenging due to several factors: (i) Events occur in a complex and dynamic social environment. Many unobserved variables, i.e., hidden confounders, affect both potential causes and outcomes. (ii) Given spatiotemporal non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data, modeling hidden confounders for accurate causal effect estimation is not trivial. In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework that integrates causal effect estimation into event forecasting. We first study the problem of Individual Treatment Effect (ITE) estimation from observational event data with spatiotemporal attributes and present a novel causal inference model to estimate ITEs. We then incorporate the learned event-related causal information into event prediction as prior knowledge. Two robust learning modules, including a feature reweighting module and an approximate constraint loss, are introduced to enable prior knowledge injection. We evaluate the proposed causal inference model on real-world event datasets and validate the effectiveness of proposed robust learning modules in event prediction by feeding learned causal information into different deep learning methods. Experimental results demonstrate the strengths of the proposed causal inference model for ITE estimation in societal events and showcase the beneficial properties of robust learning modules in societal event forecasting.|基于数据驱动的社会事件预测方法通过利用相关历史信息来预测未来事件。这类方法依赖历史标注数据，当数据有限或质量较差时难以实现准确预测。研究事件间的因果关系不仅能突破相关性分析的局限，更有助于提升事件预测的稳健性。然而将因果分析融入数据驱动的事件预测存在多重挑战：(一) 事件发生于复杂动态的社会环境中，大量未观测变量（即隐藏混淆因子）会同时影响潜在原因与结果；(二) 面对时空非独立同分布(non-IID)数据，为精确估计因果效应而建模隐藏混淆因子具有显著难度。本研究提出一个将因果效应估计融入事件预测的深度学习框架：首先针对具有时空属性的观测事件数据研究个体处理效应(ITE)估计问题，提出新型因果推理模型进行ITE估算；随后将学习到的事件因果信息作为先验知识嵌入事件预测过程。通过引入特征重加权模块和近似约束损失函数两个稳健学习模块，实现了先验知识的有效注入。我们在真实事件数据集上评估了所提出的因果推理模型，并通过将习得的因果信息输入不同深度学习方法，验证了稳健学习模块在事件预测中的有效性。实验结果表明：所提出的因果推理模型在社会事件ITE估计方面具有显著优势，且稳健学习模块在社会事件预测中展现出多重有益特性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Robust+Event+Forecasting+with+Spatiotemporal+Confounder+Learning)|1|

However, building accurate broad-scale models for streamflow remains challenging in practice due to the variability in the dominant hydrologic processes, which are best captured by sets of process-related basin characteristics. Existing basin characteristics suffer from noise and uncertainty, among many other things, which adversely impact model performance. To tackle the above challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel Knowledge-guided Self-Supervised Learning (KGSSL) inverse framework to extract system characteristics from driver(input) and response(output) data. This first-of-its-kind framework achieves robust performance even when characteristics are corrupted or missing. We evaluate the KGSSL framework in the context of stream flow modeling using CAMELS (Catchment Attributes and MEteorology for Large-sample Studies) which is a widely used hydrology benchmark dataset. Specifically, KGSSL outperforms baseline by 16% in predicting missing characteristics. Furthermore, in the context of forward modelling, KGSSL inferred characteristics provide a 35% improvement in performance over a standard baseline when the static characteristic are unknown.|机器学习正开始在水文流域径流预测等环境应用中提供最先进的性能表现。然而，由于主导水文过程存在变异性（这些过程最好通过一系列与过程相关的流域特征来捕捉），在实践中构建精确的大尺度径流模型仍然面临挑战。现有流域特征存在噪声和不确定性等诸多问题，对模型性能产生不利影响。为应对上述挑战，本文提出了一种新颖的知识引导自监督学习（KGSSL）逆向框架，可从驱动因子（输入）和响应（输出）数据中提取系统特征。该首创框架即使在特征数据损坏或缺失的情况下仍能实现稳健性能。我们使用水文领域广泛应用的基准数据集CAMELS（大样本研究集水区属性与气象数据），在径流建模场景中对KGSSL框架进行评估。具体而言：在预测缺失特征方面，KGSSL较基线方法性能提升16%；在前向建模场景中，当静态特征未知时，采用KGSSL推断特征可使模型性能较标准基线提升35%。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Robust+Inverse+Framework+using+Knowledge-guided+Self-Supervised+Learning:+An+application+to+Hydrology)|1|

We therefore make use of the new objective function to (a) judge the performance of a quantum annealer, and (b) compare this approach with existing heuristic core-periphery partitioning methods. The quantum annealing is performed on a commercially available D-Wave machine. The QUBO problem involves a full matrix even when the underlying network is sparse. Hence, we develop and test a sparsified version of the original QUBO which increases the available problem dimension for the quantum annealer.

Recently, prompt-based tuning has demonstrated superior performance to standard fine-tuning in few-shot scenarios by formulating the entity type classification task as a ''fill-in-the-blank'' problem. This allows effective utilization of the strong language modeling capability of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs). Despite the success of current prompt-based tuning approaches, two major challenges remain: (1) the verbalizer in prompts is either manually designed or constructed from external knowledge bases, without considering the target corpus and label hierarchy information, and (2) current approaches mainly utilize the representation power of PLMs, but have not explored their generation power acquired through extensive general-domain pre-training. In this work, we propose a novel framework for few-shot FET consisting of two modules: (1) an entity type label interpretation module automatically learns to relate type labels to the vocabulary by jointly leveraging few-shot instances and the label hierarchy, and (2) a type-based contextualized instance generator produces new instances based on given instances to enlarge the training set for better generalization. On three benchmark datasets, our model outperforms existing methods by significant margins.|本研究关注小样本细粒度实体类型标注（FET）问题——即每个实体类型仅提供少量带上下文的标注实体提及。近年来，基于提示的调优方法通过将实体类型分类任务构建为"填空"问题，在小样本场景中展现出优于标准微调的性能，从而有效利用了预训练语言模型（PLM）强大的语言建模能力。尽管现有基于提示的方法取得成功，仍存在两大挑战：（1）提示中的标签词化器要么人工设计，要么借助外部知识库构建，未考虑目标语料和标签层级信息；（2）当前方法主要利用PLM的表征能力，尚未充分挖掘其通过大规模通用领域预训练获得的生成能力。为此，我们提出一个新颖的小样本FET框架，包含两个模块：（1）实体类型标签解释模块通过联合利用小样本实例和标签层级结构，自动学习将类型标签与词汇表关联；（2）基于类型的上下文实例生成器根据给定实例生成新样本，以扩大训练集并提升泛化能力。在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，本模型以显著优势超越现有方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Few-Shot+Fine-Grained+Entity+Typing+with+Automatic+Label+Interpretation+and+Instance+Generation)|1|

Zaki, Dharmashankar Subramanian|IBM TJ Watson Res Ctr, Yorktown Hts, NY USA; Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Troy, NY 12180 USA|We propose an extension to the transformer neural network architecture for general-purpose graph learning by adding a dedicated pathway for pairwise structural information, called edge channels. The resultant framework - which we call Edge-augmented Graph Transformer (EGT) - can directly accept, process and output structural information of arbitrary form, which is important for effective learning on graph-structured data. Our model exclusively uses global self-attention as an aggregation mechanism rather than static localized convolutional aggregation. This allows for unconstrained long-range dynamic interactions between nodes. Moreover, the edge channels allow the structural information to evolve from layer to layer, and prediction tasks on edges/links can be performed directly from the output embeddings of these channels. We verify the performance of EGT in a wide range of graph-learning experiments on benchmark datasets, in which it outperforms Convolutional/Message-Passing Graph Neural Networks. EGT sets a new state-of-the-art for the quantum-chemical regression task on the OGB-LSC PCQM4Mv2 dataset containing 3.8 million molecular graphs. Our findings indicate that global self-attention based aggregation can serve as a flexible, adaptive and effective replacement of graph convolution for general-purpose graph learning.

The vast majority of existing works on GCN primarily focus on the accuracy while ignoring how confident or uncertain a GCN is with respect to its predictions. Despite being a cornerstone of trustworthy graph mining, uncertainty quantification on GCN has not been well studied and the scarce existing efforts either fail to provide deterministic quantification or have to change the training procedure of GCN by introducing additional parameters or architectures. In this paper, we propose the first frequentist-based approach named JuryGCN in quantifying the uncertainty of GCN, where the key idea is to quantify the uncertainty of a node as the width of confidence interval by a jackknife estimator. Moreover, we leverage the influence functions to estimate the change in GCN parameters without re-training to scale up the computation. The proposed JuryGCN is capable of quantifying uncertainty deterministically without modifying the GCN architecture or introducing additional parameters. We perform extensive experimental evaluation on real-world datasets in the tasks of both active learning and semi-supervised node classification, which demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.|图卷积网络（GCN）在众多实际应用中展现出卓越的实证性能。现有大多数GCN研究主要关注精度指标，却忽视了模型对其预测结果的置信度或不确定性评估。作为可信图挖掘的基石，GCN的不确定性量化研究尚未得到充分探索，现有少量尝试要么无法提供确定性量化，要么需要通过引入额外参数或改变网络架构来调整训练流程。本文提出首个基于频率学派理论的GCN不确定性量化方法JuryGCN，其核心思想是通过折刀估计量将节点不确定性量化为置信区间宽度。此外，我们利用影响函数无需重新训练即可估计GCN参数变化，从而有效提升计算效率。所提出的JuryGCN能够在保持GCN架构不变、不引入额外参数的前提下实现确定性不确定性量化。我们在主动学习和半监督节点分类任务中基于真实数据集进行了广泛实验评估，结果验证了该方法的有效性。  （注：翻译过程中对以下术语进行了专业处理： - "frequentist-based approach"译为"频率学派理论方法" - "jackknife estimator"译为"折刀估计量" - "influence functions"译为"影响函数" - 保持了"JuryGCN"专业术语的原文形式 - 将"deterministically"译为"确定性"以符合数学表述习惯）|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=JuryGCN:+Quantifying+Jackknife+Uncertainty+on+Graph+Convolutional+Networks)|1|

Such a Graph-in-Graph network can derive the biological functions of GO terms and generate proper descriptions. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed network, we build three large-scale benchmark datasets.

Existing graph neural network based methods mainly focus on classifying unlabeled nodes within fixed classes with abundant labeling. However, in many practical scenarios, graph evolves with emergence of new nodes and edges. Novel classes appear incrementally along with few labeling due to its newly emergence or lack of exploration. In this paper, we focus on this challenging but practical graph few-shot class-incremental learning (GFSCIL) problem and propose a novel method called Geometer. Instead of replacing and retraining the fully connected neural network classifer, Geometer predicts the label of a node by finding the nearest class prototype. Prototype is a vector representing a class in the metric space. With the pop-up of novel classes, Geometer learns and adjusts the attention-based prototypes by observing the geometric proximity, uniformity and separability. Teacher-student knowledge distillation and biased sampling are further introduced to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and unbalanced labeling problem respectively. Experimental results on four public datasets demonstrate that Geometer achieves a substantial improvement of 9.46% to 27.60% over state-of-the-art methods.|随着图数据规模的急剧扩张，节点分类在现实应用中的重要性日益凸显。现有基于图神经网络的方法主要专注于在具有充足标注信息的固定类别中对未标记节点进行分类。然而在实际场景中，图结构往往随着新节点和边的出现而动态演化。由于新类别的出现或探索不足，这些类别通常以增量方式出现且仅含少量标注样本。本文针对这一具有挑战性但实用性强的图少样本类增量学习（GFSCIL）问题，提出名为Geometer的创新解决方案。该方法摒弃了替换和重新训练全连接神经网络分类器的传统思路，通过寻找最近类别原型进行节点标签预测。原型是指在度量空间中表征类别的向量向量。面对新类别的持续出现，Geometer通过观察几何邻近性、均匀性和可分离性来学习并调整基于注意力的原型。此外引入师生知识蒸馏机制应对灾难性遗忘问题，采用偏置采样策略解决标注不平衡问题。在四个公开数据集上的实验表明，Geometer相较最先进方法实现了9.46%至27.60%的显著性能提升。  （注：根据学术论文翻译规范，对专业术语如"graph neural network"译为"图神经网络"、"few-shot"译为"少样本"、"catastrophic forgetting"译为"灾难性遗忘"等保持统一；长难句按中文表达习惯进行拆分重组；数值范围表达采用中文惯用的连接号；被动语态转换为主动式表达；保留英文缩写GFSCIL并在首次出现时标注全称）|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Geometer:+Graph+Few-Shot+Class-Incremental+Learning+via+Prototype+Representation)|1|

Due to the high cost of data collection, some developing cities have few available data, which makes it infeasible to train a well-performed model. To address this challenge, cross-city knowledge transfer has shown its promise, where the model learned from data-sufficient cities is leveraged to benefit the learning process of data-scarce cities. However, the spatio-temporal graphs among different cities show irregular structures and varied features, which limits the feasibility of existing Few-Shot Learning (FSL) methods. Therefore, we propose a model-agnostic few-shot learning framework for spatio-temporal graph called ST-GFSL. Specifically, to enhance feature extraction by transfering cross-city knowledge, ST-GFSL proposes to generate non-shared parameters based on node-level meta knowledge. The nodes in target city transfer the knowledge via parameter matching, retrieving from similar spatio-temporal characteristics. Furthermore, we propose to reconstruct the graph structure during meta-learning. The graph reconstruction loss is defined to guide structure-aware learning, avoiding structure deviation among different datasets. We conduct comprehensive experiments on four traffic speed prediction benchmarks and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of ST-GFSL compared with state-of-the-art methods.|时空图学习是处理交通流量、出租车需求及空气质量预测等城市计算任务的核心方法。由于数据采集成本高昂，部分发展中城市的可用数据稀缺，导致难以训练出高性能模型。为应对这一挑战，跨城市知识迁移方法展现出巨大潜力——通过利用从数据充足城市习得的模型来优化数据匮乏城市的学习过程。然而，不同城市的时空图具有不规则结构和差异化特征，限制了现有少样本学习（FSL）方法的适用性。为此，我们提出一种模型无关的时空图少样本学习框架ST-GFSL。该框架通过基于节点级元知识生成非共享参数以增强跨城市知识迁移的特征提取能力，目标城市节点通过参数匹配机制，从相似的时空特征中检索并迁移知识。此外，我们提出在元学习过程中重构图结构，通过定义图重构损失函数指导结构感知学习，避免不同数据集间的结构偏差。在四个交通速度预测基准上的综合实验表明，ST-GFSL相较现有最先进方法具有显著优势。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Spatio-Temporal+Graph+Few-Shot+Learning+with+Cross-City+Knowledge+Transfer)|1|

Deep learning models have greatly outperformed many traditional models, but these black-box models generally lack explainability in prediction and decision making. To reveal the underlying trend with understandable mathematical expressions, scientists and economists tend to use partial differential equations (PDEs) to explain the highly nonlinear dynamics of sequential patterns. However, it usually requires domain expert knowledge and a series of simplified assumptions, which is not always practical and can deviate from the ever-changing world. Is it possible to learn the differential relations from data dynamically to explain the time-evolving dynamics? In this work, we propose an learning framework that can automatically obtain interpretable PDE models from sequential data. Particularly, this framework is comprised of learnable differential blocks, named P-blocks, which is proved to be able to approximate any time-evolving complex continuous functions in theory.

Conventional research mainly focuses on developing methods for the extraction and registration tasks separately under supervised settings. The performance of these methods highly depends on the amount of training samples and visual inspections performed by experts for error correction. However, in many medical studies, collecting voxel-level labels and conducting manual quality control in high-dimensional neuroimages (eg 3D MRI) are very expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, brain extraction and registration are highly related tasks in neuroimaging data and should be solved collectively. In this paper, we study the problem of unsupervised collective extraction and registration in neuroimaging data. We propose a unified end-to-end framework, called ERNet (Extraction-Registration Network), to jointly optimize the extraction and registration tasks, allowing feedback between them. Specifically, we use a pair of multi-stage extraction and registration modules to learn the extraction mask and transformation, where the extraction network improves the extraction accuracy incrementally and the registration network successively warps the extracted image until it is well-aligned with the target image. Experiment results on real-world datasets show that our proposed method can effectively improve the performance on extraction and registration tasks in neuroimaging data.|脑组织提取与配准是神经影像数据分析中的重要预处理步骤，其目标是从磁共振成像扫描中提取脑区（即提取步骤），并将其与目标脑图像进行对齐（即配准步骤）。传统研究主要侧重于在监督环境下分别开发提取与配准任务的方法，这些方法的性能高度依赖于训练样本数量以及专家进行纠错的视觉检查。然而在许多医学研究中，收集体素级标签并对高维神经影像（如三维磁共振图像）进行人工质量控制成本高昂且耗时。此外，脑组织提取与配准在神经影像数据中是高度关联的任务，应当协同求解。本文研究神经影像数据中无监督协同提取与配准问题，提出名为ERNet（提取-配准网络）的端到端统一框架，通过联合优化提取与配准任务实现双向反馈。具体而言，我们采用多级提取模块与多级配准模块的组合来学习提取掩模和空间变换——提取网络逐步提升提取精度，配准网络对提取后的图像进行连续形变直至与目标图像精确对齐。真实数据集上的实验结果表明，本方法能有效提升神经影像数据中提取与配准任务的性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=ERNet:+Unsupervised+Collective+Extraction+and+Registration+in+Neuroimaging+Data)|1|
|[Towards an Optimal Asymmetric Graph Structure for Robust Semi-supervised Node Classification](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539332)|Zixing Song, Yifei Zhang, Irwin King|Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China|Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated great power for the semi-supervised node classification task. However, most GNN methods are sensitive to the noise of graph structures. Graph structure learning (GSL) is then introduced for robustification, which contains two major parts: recovering the optimal graph and fine-tuning the GNN parameters on this generated graph for the downstream task. Nonetheless, most of the existing GSL solutions merely focus on the node features during the first module for graph generation and exploit label information only by back-propagation during the second module for GNN training. They neglect the different roles that labeled and unlabeled nodes could play in GSL for the semi-supervised task, leading to a sub-optimal graph under this setting. In this paper, we give a precise definition on the optimality of the refined graph and provide the exact form of an optimal asymmetric graph structure designed explicitly for the semi-supervised node classification by distinguishing the different roles of labeled and unlabeled nodes through theoretical analysis. We propose a probabilistic model to infer the edge weights in this graph, which can be jointly trained with the subsequent node classification component.

Among them, voltage fluctuations caused by the instability of renewable energy are receiving increasing attention. Utilizing MARL algorithms to coordinate multiple control units in the grid, which is able to handle rapid changes of power systems, has been widely studied in active voltage control task recently. However, existing approaches based on MARL ignore the unique nature of the grid and achieve limited performance. In this paper, we introduce the transformer architecture to extract representations adapting to power network problems and propose a Transformer-based Multi-Agent Actor-Critic framework (T-MAAC) to stabilize voltage in power distribution networks. In addition, we adopt a novel auxiliary-task training process tailored to the voltage control task, which improves the sample efficiency and facilitating the representation learning of the transformer-based model. We couple T-MAAC with different multi-agent actor-critic algorithms, and the consistent improvements on the active voltage control task demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.|随着可再生能源并网程度的不断提高，配电系统运行面临一系列技术挑战。其中，由可再生能源不稳定性引发的电压波动问题日益受到关注。近年来，利用多智能体强化学习算法协调电网中多个控制单元以应对电力系统的快速变化，已在主动电压控制任务中得到广泛研究。然而，现有基于多智能体强化学习的方法未能充分考虑电网特性，导致控制性能受限。本文创新性地引入Transformer架构来提取适应电网问题的表征，并提出基于Transformer的多智能体演员-评论员框架（T-MAAC）以实现配电网电压稳定控制。此外，我们设计了一种针对电压控制任务的新型辅助训练方法，有效提升了样本利用率并促进Transformer模型的表征学习能力。通过将T-MAAC与不同多智能体演员-评论员算法结合进行实验，在主动电压控制任务中取得的持续性改进验证了该方法的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Stabilizing+Voltage+in+Power+Distribution+Networks+via+Multi-Agent+Reinforcement+Learning+with+Transformer)|1|

In practice, real-world graphs generally follow the long-tail distribution, where a large number of classes only consist of limited labeled nodes. Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved significant improvements in node classification, their performance decreases substantially in such a few-shot scenario. The main reason can be attributed to the vast generalization gap between meta-training and meta-test due to the task variance caused by different node/class distributions in meta-tasks (i.e., node-level and class-level variance). Therefore, to effectively alleviate the impact of task variance, we propose a task-adaptive node classification framework under the few-shot learning setting. Specifically, we first accumulate meta-knowledge across classes with abundant labeled nodes. Then we transfer such knowledge to the classes with limited labeled nodes via our proposed task-adaptive modules. In particular, to accommodate the different node/class distributions among meta-tasks, we propose three essential modules to perform node-level, class-level, and task-level adaptations in each meta-task, respectively. In this way, our framework can conduct adaptations to different meta-tasks and thus advance the model generalization performance on meta-test tasks.

Recently, the opioid epidemic is increasingly serious across the US as its related deaths have risen at alarming rates. To combat the deadly opioid epidemic, a state-run prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) has been established to alleviate the drug over-prescribing problem in the US. Although PDMP provides a detailed prescription history related to opioids, it is still not enough to prevent opioid overdose because it cannot predict over-prescribing risk. In addition, existing machine learning-based methods mainly focus on drug doses while ignoring other prescribing patterns behind patients' historical records, thus resulting in suboptimal performance. To this end, we propose a novel model DDHGNN - Disentangled Dynamic Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network, for over-prescribing prediction. Specifically, we abstract the PDMP data into a dynamic heterogeneous graph which comprehensively depicts the prescribing and dispensing (P&D) relationships. Then, we design a dynamic heterogeneous graph neural network to learn patients' representations. Furthermore, we devise an adversarial disentangler to learn a disentangled representation which is particularly related to the prescribing patterns. Extensive experiments on a 1-year anonymous PDMP data demonstrate that DDHGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, revealing its promising future in preventing opioid overdose.|阿片类药物（如奥施康定和吗啡）是具有强成瘾性的处方药，易因开具过量导致药物滥用。近年来，美国阿片类药物危机日益严峻，相关致死率呈惊人增长态势。为应对这一致命危机，各州建立了处方药监控项目（PDMP）以缓解药物过量开具问题。尽管PDMP能提供详尽的阿片类药物处方记录，但其无法预测过量开具风险，仍不足以阻止药物滥用。现有机器学习方法主要关注药物剂量，却忽视了患者历史记录背后的其他处方模式，导致预测效果欠佳。为此，我们提出新型模型DDHGNN——解耦动态异质图神经网络，用于预测处方过量风险。具体而言，我们将PDMP数据抽象为动态异质图，全面描述处方与配药（P&D）关系；继而设计动态异质图神经网络学习患者表征；进一步开发对抗解耦器，获取与处方模式特异性相关的解耦表征。基于一年期匿名PDMP数据的大量实验表明，DDHGNN性能优于现有前沿方法，展现出其在预防阿片类药物滥用方面的应用潜力。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Disentangled+Dynamic+Heterogeneous+Graph+Learning+for+Opioid+Overdose+Prediction)|1|

These simulations are often run at multiple levels of sophistication to balance accuracy and efficiency. Multi-fidelity surrogate modeling reduces the computational cost by fusing different simulation outputs. Cheap data generated from low-fidelity simulators can be combined with limited high-quality data generated by an expensive high-fidelity simulator. Existing methods based on Gaussian processes rely on strong assumptions of the kernel functions and can hardly scale to high-dimensional settings. We propose Multi-fidelity Hierarchical Neural Processes (MF-HNP), a unified neural latent variable model for multi-fidelity surrogate modeling. MF-HNP inherits the flexibility and scalability of Neural Processes. The latent variables transform the correlations among different fidelity levels from observations to latent space. The predictions across fidelities are conditionally independent given the latent states. It helps alleviate the error propagation issue in existing methods. MF-HNP is flexible enough to handle non-nested high dimensional data at different fidelity levels with varying input and output dimensions. We evaluate MF-HNP on epidemiology and climate modeling tasks, achieving competitive performance in terms of accuracy and uncertainty estimation. In contrast to deep Gaussian Processes with only low-dimensional (< 10) tasks, our method shows great promise for speeding up high-dimensional complex simulations (over 7000 for epidemiology modeling and 45000 for climate modeling).|科学与工程领域广泛采用计算机仿真技术。为平衡精度与效率，这些仿真通常会在多个精度层级上运行。多保真度代理建模通过融合不同仿真输出，有效降低了计算成本。该方法能将低成本低精度模拟器生成的大量数据，与高成本高精度模拟器生成的有限高质量数据相结合。现有基于高斯过程的方法依赖核函数的强假设，难以扩展到高维场景。我们提出多保真度分层神经过程（MF-HNP），这是一种用于多保真度代理建模的统一神经隐变量模型。MF-HNP继承了神经过程的灵活性和可扩展性，通过隐变量将不同保真度层级间的相关性从观测空间转换到隐空间。在给定隐状态的条件下，跨保真度的预测具有条件独立性，这有助于缓解现有方法中的误差传播问题。MF-HNP能够灵活处理非嵌套的高维数据，适应不同保真度层级下变化的输入输出维度。我们在流行病学和气候建模任务上评估MF-HNP，其在预测精度和不确定性估计方面均表现出竞争优势。与仅能处理低维任务（<10维）的深度高斯过程相比，我们的方法在加速高维复杂仿真方面展现出巨大潜力（流行病学建模超过7000维，气候建模达45000维）。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Multi-fidelity+Hierarchical+Neural+Processes)|1|

In this work, we investigate why these perturbations work in principle. We are the first to unveil an important population property of the perturbations of these attacks: they are almost linearly separable when assigned with the target labels of the corresponding samples, which hence can work as shortcuts for the learning objective. We further verify that linear separability is indeed the workhorse for availability attacks. We synthesize linearly-separable perturbations as attacks and show that they are as powerful as the deliberately crafted attacks. Moreover, such synthetic perturbations are much easier to generate. For example, previous attacks need dozens of hours to generate perturbations for ImageNet while our algorithm only needs several seconds. Our finding also suggests that the shortcut learning is more widely present than previously believed as deep models would rely on shortcuts even if they are of an imperceptible scale and mixed together with the normal features.

However, drastic performance degradation is always observed when a GNN is stacked with many layers. As a result, most GNNs only have shallow architectures, which limits their expressive power and exploitation of deep neighborhoods. Most recent studies attribute the performance degradation of deep GNNs to the over-smoothing issue. In this paper, we disentangle the conventional graph convolution operation into two independent operations: Propagation (P) and Transformation (T). Following this, the depth of a GNN can be split into the propagation depth (Dp) and the transformation depth (Dt). Through extensive experiments, we find that the major cause for the performance degradation of deep GNNs is the model degradation issue caused by large Dt rather than the over-smoothing issue mainly caused by large Dp. Further, we present Adaptive Initial Residual (AIR), a plug-and-play module compatible with all kinds of GNN architectures, to alleviate the model degradation issue and the over-smoothing issue simultaneously. Experimental results on six real-world datasets demonstrate that GNNs equipped with AIR outperform most GNNs with shallow architectures owing to the benefits of both large DD_p$ and Dt, while the time costs associated with AIR can be ignored.|图神经网络（GNN）在各种图挖掘任务中取得了显著成功。然而当GNN堆叠过多层时，总会观察到剧烈的性能退化现象。这导致现有GNN大多采用浅层架构，限制了模型表达能力与深层邻域信息的利用。当前研究普遍将深度GNN的性能退化归因于过度平滑问题。本文通过将传统图卷积操作解耦为两个独立操作：传播（P）与变换（T），将GNN的深度分解为传播深度（Dp）和变换深度（Dt）。大量实验表明，深度GNN性能退化的主要成因是由较大Dt导致的模型退化问题，而非由较大Dp主导的过度平滑问题。在此基础上，我们提出自适应初始残差（AIR）模块——一种可适配所有GNN架构的即插即用方案，能够同步缓解模型退化与过度平滑问题。在六个真实数据集上的实验表明，配备AIR的GNN凭借较大Dp与Dt的双重优势，性能超越大多数浅层GNN架构，而AIR引入的时间成本可忽略不计。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Model+Degradation+Hinders+Deep+Graph+Neural+Networks)|1|

The newly collected data usually consist of multiple modalities and are characterized with multiple labels, thus exhibiting the co-existence of multiple types of heterogeneity. Although state-of-the-art techniques are good at modeling the complex heterogeneity with sufficient label information, such label information can be quite expensive to obtain in real applications. Recently, researchers pay great attention to contrastive learning due to its prominent performance by utilizing rich unlabeled data. However, existing work on contrastive learning is not able to address the problem of false-negative pairs, i.e., some 'negative' pairs may have similar representations if they have the same label. To overcome the issues, in this paper, we propose a unified heterogeneous learning framework, which combines both the weighted unsupervised contrastive loss and the weighted supervised contrastive loss to model multiple types of heterogeneity. We first provide a theoretical analysis showing that the vanilla contrastive learning loss easily leads to the sub-optimal solution in the presence of false-negative pairs, whereas the proposed weighted loss could automatically adjust the weight based on the similarity of the learned representations to mitigate this issue. Experimental results on real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed framework modeling multiple types of heterogeneity.|随着大数据在多领域高影响力应用中的涌现，我们时常面临复杂异构性的挑战。新采集的数据通常包含多模态特征并具有多标签特性，因而呈现出多种异构类型共存的特性。尽管现有先进技术能够基于充足标签信息对复杂异构性进行有效建模，但在实际应用中获取此类标签信息的成本往往十分高昂。近年来，对比学习因其能充分利用未标注数据而展现卓越性能，受到研究者的广泛关注。然而，现有对比学习方法尚不能有效处理假负例对问题——即具有相同标签的样本在表征空间中可能具有高度相似性，却被错误视为负样本。为克服这一局限，本文提出一个统一的异构学习框架，通过融合加权无监督对比损失与加权有监督对比损失来实现对多种异构类型的联合建模。我们首先从理论角度证明：传统对比学习损失在存在假负例对时容易导致次优解，而提出的加权损失能根据学习表征的相似度自动调整权重以缓解该问题。在真实数据集上的实验结果表明，所提框架在建模多种异构类型时具有显著的有效性与高效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Contrastive+Learning+with+Complex+Heterogeneity)|1|

However, existing approaches either focus on talent demand or supply forecasting, but overlook the interconnection between demand-supply sequences among different companies and positions. To this end, in this paper, we propose a Dynamic Heterogeneous Graph Enhanced Meta-learning (DH-GEM) framework for fine-grained talent demand-supply joint prediction. Specifically, we first propose a Demand-Supply Joint Encoder-Decoder (DSJED) and a Dynamic Company-Position Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network (DyCP-HGCN) to respectively capture the intrinsic correlation between demand and supply sequences and company-position pairs. Moreover, a Loss-Driven Sampling based Meta-learner (LDSM) is proposed to optimize long-tail forecasting tasks with a few training data. Extensive experiments have been conducted on three real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared with five baselines.

This makes them suitable to uncover complex relationships between vastly different data types, thus lowering the dependency on labor-intensive feature engineering methods. Leveraging deep representation learning, we propose a generic, robust and systematic model that is able to combine multiple data modalities in a permutation and modes-number-invariant fashion, both fundamental properties to properly face changes in data type content and availability. To this end, we treat each multi-modal data sample as a set and utilise autoencoders to learn a fixed size, permutation invariant representation that can be used in any decision making process. We build upon previous work that demonstrates the feasibility of presenting a set as an input to autoencoders through content-based attention mechanisms. However, since model inputs and outputs are permutation invariant, we develop an end-to-end architecture that approximates the solution of a linear sum assignment problem, i.e., a minimum-cost bijective mapping problem, to ensure a match between the elements of the input and the output set for effective loss calculation. We demonstrate the model capability to learn a combined representation while preserving individual mode characteristics focusing on the task of reconstructing multi-omic cancer data.

They are produced, transported, and consumed in modern cities every day, which breeds many unknown hazardous chemicals-related locations (HCLs) that are out of the supervision of management departments and accompanying huge threats to urban safety. How to recognize these unknown HCLs and identify their risk levels is an essential task for urban hazardous chemicals management. To accomplish this task, in this work, we propose a system named as CityShield to discover hidden HCLs and classify their risk levels based on trajectories of hazardous chemicals transportation vehicles. The CityShield system consists of three components. The first component is Data Pre-processing, which filters noises in raw trajectories and probes stable transportation vehicles' stay points from massive uncertain GPS points. The second is HCL Recognition, which adopts the proposed HCL-Rec algorithm to cluster stay points into polygonal HCLs, and avoids the improper location merging problem caused by the skewed spatial distribution of HCLs. The third component is HCL Classification, which introduces the HCL relation graph as auxiliary information to overcome the label scarcity problem of HCLs. It adopts a self-supervised method consisting of four pre-training tasks to learn high-quality representations for HCLs from the graph, which are finally used to classify the categories and risk levels of HCLs. The CityShield system has been deployed in Nantong, an important hazardous chemicals import and export city in China. Experiments and case studies on two large-scale real-world datasets collected from Nantong demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed system. In real-world applications, the CityShield system discovered 173 high-risk unknown HCLs for the Nantong government, and successfully moved the hazardous chemicals management of Nantong to the prevention rather than emergency response side.|随着工业化和城市化的空前发展，众多危险化学品已成为日常生活中不可或缺的组成部分。这些化学品每日在现代城市中生产、运输和消耗，催生了大量处于监管部门视野之外的未知危化品相关场所（HCLs），给城市安全带来巨大威胁。如何识别这些未知HCLs并判定其风险等级，已成为城市危化品管理的核心课题。为此，本研究提出名为CityShield的系统，基于危化品运输车辆轨迹数据实现隐蔽HCLs的发现与风险分级。该系统包含三大模块：数据预处理模块通过噪声过滤从海量不确定GPS点中提取稳定运输车辆的停留点；HCL识别模块采用提出的HCL-Rec算法将停留点聚类为多边形HCLs，有效规避因空间分布偏斜导致的位置误合并问题；HCL分类模块引入HCL关系图作为辅助信息，通过包含四项预训练任务的自监督方法从图中学习高质量场所表征，最终实现HCL类别与风险等级的精准判定。该系统已在我国重要危化品进出口城市南通部署实施，基于当地采集的两大规模真实数据集的实验与案例研究验证了系统的有效性。在实际应用中，CityShield系统已为南通市政府识别出173个高风险未知HCLs，成功推动当地危化品管理从事后应急向事前预防转型。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Precision+CityShield+Against+Hazardous+Chemicals+Threats+via+Location+Mining+and+Self-Supervised+Learning)|1|

While significant progress has been made to achieve accurate representations for downstream applications, the learned representations often lack interpretability and do not expose semantic meanings. Different from previous efforts on the entangled feature space, we aim to extract the semantic-rich temporal correlations in the latent interpretable factorized representation of the data. Motivated by the success of disentangled representation learning in computer vision, we study the possibility of learning semantic-rich time-series representations, which remains unexplored due to three main challenges: 1) sequential data structure introduces complex temporal correlations and makes the latent representations hard to interpret, 2) sequential models suffer from KL vanishing problem, and 3) interpretable semantic concepts for time-series often rely on multiple factors instead of individuals. To bridge the gap, we propose Disentangle Time Series (DTS), a novel disentanglement enhancement framework for sequential data. Specifically, to generate hierarchical semantic concepts as the interpretable and disentangled representation of time-series, DTS introduces multi-level disentanglement strategies by covering both individual latent factors and group semantic segments. We further theoretically show how to alleviate the KL vanishing problem: DTS introduces a mutual information maximization term, while preserving a heavier penalty on the total correlation and the dimension-wise KL to keep the disentanglement property. Experimental results on various real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that the representations learned by DTS achieve superior performance in downstream applications, with high interpretability of semantic concepts.|时间序列表征学习是时序分析的基础任务。尽管在获取适用于下游应用的精确表征方面已取得显著进展，但所学表征往往缺乏可解释性且无法呈现语义含义。与先前在纠缠特征空间上的研究不同，我们的目标是从数据的潜在可解释因子化表征中提取富含语义的时序相关性。受计算机视觉中解耦表征学习成功的启发，我们探索学习富含语义的时间序列表征的可能性——该领域因三大挑战尚未被充分探索：1）序列数据结构引入复杂时序相关性，导致潜在表征难以解释；2）序列模型存在KL散度消失问题；3）时间序列的可解释语义概念通常依赖于多重因素而非单一要素。为弥补这一空白，我们提出解耦时间序列框架——一种针对序列数据的新型解耦增强框架。具体而言，为生成具有层次结构的语义概念作为时间序列的可解释解耦表征，DTS通过同时覆盖个体潜在因子和群体语义片段，引入多层次解耦策略。我们进一步从理论层面论证了如何缓解KL消失问题：DTS在保持对总相关性和维度KL散度更强惩罚以维持解耦特性的同时，引入了互信息最大化项。在多个真实世界基准数据集上的实验结果表明，DTS学习到的表征在下游任务中具有卓越性能，并能实现语义概念的高可解释性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Towards+Learning+Disentangled+Representations+for+Time+Series)|1|

A member's abilities represent the potential of a member projecting his/her social values to others, and also represent the level of credibility and authority for a member to hold certain status. Therefore, the concepts of status and ability are deeply related, and should be consistent with each other. In this paper, we establish the consistency models among different member status and their abilities through analyzing member data and integrating domain knowledge. We use these models to help our members refine their inconsistent status, at the same time, identify ability gaps. To reliably refine a member status, we introduce a practical and human-in-the-loop methodology to build status hierarchy. Conditioned on the hierarchical structure, our modeling process exploits the associations between status and abilities. We applied the technique to LinkedIn member titles -- one of the major types of the member status, and member skills -- the main ability representations at LinkedIn. We showed that our models are intuitive and perform well. The skill gaps identified are actionable and concise. In this paper, we also discuss the aspects of building such systems, and how we could deploy the models in production.|在社交网络环境中，成员状态体现着其在网络中的社会价值。成员能力既代表着个人向社会传递价值的潜力，也构成了特定身份所需可信度与权威性的衡量基准。因此，状态与能力这两个概念具有深刻的内在关联，彼此应当相互契合。本文通过分析成员数据并融合领域知识，建立了不同成员状态与其能力之间的关联模型。这些模型既能帮助成员优化不匹配的状态标识，又可精准识别能力差距。为确保状态优化的可靠性，我们引入了一套实用且融入人工校验的层级构建方法。基于这种层级结构，我们的建模过程深入挖掘了状态与能力之间的潜在关联。  我们将该技术应用于领英平台上的成员职位（主要状态标识）与技能（核心能力表征）体系。实践表明，所建模型不仅直观有效，识别出的技能差距也具有可操作性且简洁明确。本文还探讨了构建此类系统的关键要素，以及如何将模型部署至生产环境的实施方案。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=CS-RAD:+Conditional+Member+Status+Refinement+and+Ability+Discovery+for+Social+Network+Applications)|1|

In the course of our work on GNN infrastructure and open-source software at Google, we have sought to develop benchmarks that are robust, tunable, scalable, and generalizable.

GraphWorld can be run on a single machine without specialized hardware, or it can be easily scaled up to run on arbitrary clusters or cloud frameworks. Using GraphWorld, a user has fine-grained control over graph generator parameters, and can benchmark arbitrary GNN models with built-in hyperparameter tuning. We present insights from GraphWorld experiments regarding the performance characteristics of thirteen GNN models and baselines over millions of benchmark datasets. We further show that GraphWorld efficiently explores regions of benchmark dataset space uncovered by standard benchmarks, revealing comparisons between models that have not been historically obtainable.

With the recent availability of public, large ground-truth datasets such as PubLayNet and DocBank, deep-learning models have proven to be very effective at layout detection and segmentation. While these datasets are of adequate size to train such models, they severely lack in layout variability since they are sourced from scientific article repositories such as PubMed and arXiv only. Consequently, the accuracy of the layout segmentation drops significantly when these models are applied on more challenging and diverse layouts. In this paper, we presentDocLayNet, a new, publicly available, document-layout annotation dataset in COCO format. It contains 80863 manually annotated pages from diverse data sources to represent a wide variability in layouts. For each PDF page, the layout annotations provide labelled bounding-boxes with a choice of 11 distinct classes. DocLayNet also provides a subset of double- and triple-annotated pages to determine the inter-annotator agreement. In multiple experiments, we provide baseline accuracy scores (in mAP) for a set of popular object detection models. We also demonstrate that these models fall approximately 10% behind the inter-annotator agreement. Furthermore, we provide evidence that DocLayNet is of sufficient size.

This problem involves causal reasoning to estimate the individual causal effect (ICE) on the survival outcome, i.e., job retention time, to determine the most effective intervention for a worker. Existing methods are not suitable to solve our problem. They are mostly developed for non-causal or non-survival challenges, while methods for causal survival analysis are under-explored. This paper proposes a representation learning method for recommending personalized interventions that can generate a maximum increase in job retention time for workers with disability. In our method, observed covariates are disentangled into latent variables based on which confounding and censoring biases are eliminated, and the ICE prediction model is built. Since true ICE values are not directly measurable in observational data, a reverse engineering technique is developed to estimate ICE for training samples. These estimated ICE values are then used as the pseudo ground truth to train the prediction model. Experiments with a case study of Australian workers with disability show that by adopting personalized interventions recommended by our method, disabled workers can increase their job retention time by up to 2.8 months.

Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show how the PCRL reduces the waiting and travel time while increasing the benefit of the charging plan compared to five baselines. Compared to the existing infrastructure, we can reduce the waiting time by up to 97% and increase the benefit up to 497%.|从传统交通向电动出行的转型在很大程度上取决于充电基础设施的可用性与布局优化。本文针对城市区域充电站的最优布局问题展开研究，在设定预算约束的前提下，我们实现了区域内充电设施供给的最大化，并同步缩短了等待时间、行驶时间与充电时长。此外，本研究创新性地引入家庭充电场景，以更精准地测算全域实际充电需求。我们将充电站布局问题构建为一个非线性整数优化模型，该模型同时求解充电站最优选址与不同充电类型的充电桩最优配置数量。基于此，我们设计了一种新颖的深度强化学习方法（PCRL）来解决该布局优化问题。通过在实际数据集上的大量实验表明，相较于五种基线方法，PCRL在提升充电方案效益的同时有效降低了等待时间与行驶时间。与现有基础设施相比，该方法最高可降低97%的等待时间，并实现高达497%的效益提升。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Reinforcement+Learning-based+Placement+of+Charging+Stations+in+Urban+Road+Networks)|1|

Exploring why traffic congestion occurs is significantly important to effectively address the problem of traffic congestion and improve user experience. Traditional approaches to mine the congestion causes depend on human efforts, which is time consuming and cost-intensive. Hence, we aim to discover the known and unknown causes of traffic congestion in a systematic way. However, to achieve it, there are three challenges: 1) traffic congestion is affected by several factors with complex spatio-temporal relations; 2) the amount of congestion data with known causes is small due to the limitation of human label; 3) more unknown congestion causes are unexplored since several factors contribute to traffic congestion. To address above challenges, we design a congestion cause discovery system consisting of two modules: 1) congestion feature extraction, which extracts the important features influencing congestion; and 2) congestion cause discovery, which utilize a deep semi-supervised learning based method to discover the causes of traffic congestion with limited labeled causes. Specifically, it first leverages a few labeled data as prior knowledge to pre-train the model. Then, the k-means algorithm is performed to produce the clusters. Extensive experiments show that the performance of our proposed method is superior to the baselines. Additionally, our system is deployed and used in the practical production environment at Amap.|交通拥堵导致行程时间显著延长，严重影响了人们的日常出行体验。探究拥堵成因对有效解决交通拥堵问题、提升用户体验至关重要。传统的拥堵原因挖掘方法依赖人工处理，耗时耗力且成本高昂。为此，我们致力于以系统化方式发掘已知与未知的拥堵成因。然而实现这一目标面临三大挑战：1）交通拥堵受多因素影响且具有复杂的时空关联；2）受人工标注所限，已知成因的拥堵数据量稀少；3）由于影响因素众多，大量未知拥堵成因尚待发掘。为应对这些挑战，我们设计了一套包含两个模块的拥堵成因发现系统：1）拥堵特征提取模块，用于识别影响拥堵的重要特征；2）拥堵成因发现模块，采用基于深度半监督学习的方法，在有限标注数据条件下发掘拥堵成因。具体而言，该方法首先利用少量标注数据作为先验知识进行模型预训练，随后通过k-means算法生成聚类簇。大量实验表明，我们提出的方法性能优于基线模型。目前该系统已在Amap（高德地图）实际生产环境中部署应用。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Learning+to+Discover+Causes+of+Traffic+Congestion+with+Limited+Labeled+Data)|1|
|[A Framework for Multi-stage Bonus Allocation in Meal Delivery Platform](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539202)|Zhuolin Wu, Li Wang, Fangsheng Huang, Linjun Zhou, Yu Song, Chengpeng Ye, Pengyu Nie, Hao Ren, Jinghua Hao, Renqing He, Zhizhao Sun|Meituan, Beijing, Peoples R China|Online meal delivery is undergoing explosive growth, as this service is becoming increasingly popular. A meal delivery platform aims to provide excellent and stable services for customers and restaurants. However, in reality, several hundred thousand orders are canceled per day in the Meituan meal delivery platform since they are not accepted by the crowd soucing drivers. The cancellation of the orders is incredibly detrimental to the customer's repurchase rate and the reputation of the Meituan meal delivery platform. To solve this problem, a certain amount of specific funds is provided by Meituan's business managers to encourage the crowdsourcing drivers to accept more orders. To make better use of the funds, in this work, we propose a framework to deal with the multi-stage bonus allocation problem for a meal delivery platform. The objective of this framework is to maximize the number of accepted orders within a limited bonus budget. This framework consists of a semi-black-box acceptance probability model, a Lagrangian dual-based dynamic programming algorithm, and an online allocation algorithm. The semi-black-box acceptance probability model is employed to forecast the relationship between the bonus allocated to order and its acceptance probability, the Lagrangian dual-based dynamic programming algorithm aims to calculate the empirical Lagrangian multiplier for each allocation stage offline based on the historical data set, and the online allocation algorithm uses the results attained in the offline part to calculate a proper delivery bonus for each order. To verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework, both offline experiments on a real-world data set and online A/B tests on the Meituan meal delivery platform are conducted. Our results show that using the proposed framework, the total order cancellations can be decreased by more than 25% in reality.|随着在线餐饮配送服务的日益普及，该行业正经历爆发式增长。餐饮配送平台致力于为顾客和餐厅提供优质稳定的服务。然而现实中，美团配送平台每日有数十万订单因未被众包骑手接单而取消。订单取消严重影响了顾客复购率和平台声誉。为解决该问题，美团运营管理人员设立专项激励资金，鼓励骑手承接更多订单。为优化资金使用效率，本研究提出一个处理多阶段补贴分配问题的框架，旨在有限预算内最大化订单承接量。该框架包含半黑盒接单概率模型、基于拉格朗日对偶的动态规划算法及在线分配算法：半黑盒模型用于预测订单补贴与接单概率的关联关系；拉格朗日对偶动态规划算法基于历史数据离线计算各分配阶段的经验乘子；在线分配算法则利用离线计算结果为每笔订单生成合理补贴。为验证框架有效性，我们同时在真实数据集进行离线实验和在美团平台开展在线A/B测试。结果表明，该框架在实际应用中可降低超过25%的订单取消量。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=A+Framework+for+Multi-stage+Bonus+Allocation+in+Meal+Delivery+Platform)|1|

E-commerce platforms display organic search results and advertisements (ads), collectively called items, together as a mixed list. The items displayed around the predicted ad, i.e. external items, may affect the user clicking on the predicted. Previous CTR models assume the user click only relies on the ad itself, which overlooks the effects of external items, referred to as external effects, or externalities. During the advertising prediction, the organic results have been generated by the organic system, while the final displayed ads on multiple ad slots have not been figured out, which leads to two challenges: 1) the predicted (target) ad may win any ad slot, bringing about diverse externalities. 2) external ads are undetermined, resulting in incomplete externalities. Facing the above challenges, inspired by the Transformer, we propose EXternality TRansformer (EXTR) which regards target ad with all slots as query and external items as key&value to model externalities in all exposure situations in parallel. Furthermore, we design a Potential Allocation Generator (PAG) for EXTR, to learn the allocation of potential external ads to complete the externalities. Extensive experimental results on Alibaba datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of externalities in the task of CTR prediction and illustrate that our proposed approach can bring significant profits to the real-world e-commerce platform.

Masked Language Modeling. The latter aims to predict randomly masked items within the sequence. Because they assume that the true interacted item is the most relevant one, an exposure bias results, where non-interacted items with low exposure propensities are assumed to be irrelevant. The most common approach to mitigating exposure bias in recommendation has been Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS), which consists of down-weighting the interacted predictions in the loss function in proportion to their propensities of exposure, yielding a theoretically unbiased learning. In this work, we argue and prove that IPS does not extend to sequential recommendation because it fails to account for the temporal nature of the problem. We then propose a novel propensity scoring mechanism, which can theoretically debias the Cloze task in sequential recommendation. Finally we empirically demonstrate the debiasing capabilities of our proposed approach and its robustness to the severity of exposure bias.|双向转换器体系结构是最先进的顺序推荐模型，它使用基于完形填空任务的双向表示能力，也就是掩码语言建模。后者旨在预测序列中随机掩盖的项目。因为他们假设真正的相互作用的项目是最相关的一个，暴露偏差的结果，其中没有相互作用的项目低暴露倾向被认为是无关紧要的。减轻推荐中暴露偏倚的最常见方法是逆倾向评分(IPS) ，其包括按照暴露倾向的比例降低损失函数中的相互作用预测的权重，从而产生理论上无偏倚的学习。在这项工作中，我们争论和证明 IPS 没有扩展到顺序推荐，因为它没有考虑到问题的时间性质。然后，我们提出了一种新的倾向评分机制，它可以在理论上降低完形填空任务的顺序推荐。最后，我们通过实证证明了我们提出的方法的去偏能力及其对暴露偏差严重程度的鲁棒性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Debiasing+the+Cloze+Task+in+Sequential+Recommendation+with+Bidirectional+Transformers)|0|

One of the most challenging problems of this task is the existence of severe selection bias caused by the inherent self-selection behavior of users and the item selection process of systems. Currently, doubly robust (DR) learning approaches achieve the state-of-the-art performance for debiasing CVR prediction. However, in this paper, by theoretically analyzing the bias, variance and generalization bounds of DR methods, we find that existing DR approaches may have poor generalization caused by inaccurate estimation of propensity scores and imputation errors, which often occur in practice. Motivated by such analysis, we propose a generalized learning framework that not only unifies existing DR methods, but also provides a valuable opportunity to develop a series of new debiasing techniques to accommodate different application scenarios. Based on the framework, we propose two new DR methods, namely DR-BIAS and DR-MSE. DR-BIAS directly controls the bias of DR loss, while DR-MSE balances the bias and variance flexibly, which achieves better generalization performance. In addition, we propose a novel tri-level joint learning optimization method for DR-MSE in CVR prediction, and an efficient training algorithm correspondingly. We conduct extensive experiments on both real-world and semi-synthetic datasets, which validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.|点击后转换率(CVR)预测是发现用户兴趣和增加平台收入的一个重要任务，在一系列的工业应用。这项任务最具挑战性的问题之一是由于用户固有的自我选择行为和系统的项目选择过程所引起的严重选择偏差的存在。目前，双鲁棒(DR)学习方法在降低 CVR 预测偏差方面取得了最好的效果。然而，通过对 DR 方法的偏差、方差和泛化界限的理论分析，我们发现现有的 DR 方法可能由于在实际应用中经常出现的倾向分数估计不准确和插补错误而导致泛化能力较差。基于这样的分析，我们提出了一个通用的学习框架，它不仅统一了现有的 DR 方法，而且为开发一系列新的去偏技术以适应不同的应用场景提供了宝贵的机会。在此基础上，提出了两种新的 DR 方法: DR-BIAS 和 DR-MSE。DR-BIAS 直接控制 DR 损失的偏差，而 DR-MSE 灵活地平衡偏差和方差，从而获得更好的泛化性能。此外，本文还提出了一种新的基于 DR-MSE 的 CVR 预测三层联合学习优化方法，并给出了相应的训练算法。我们在真实世界和半合成数据集上进行了广泛的实验，验证了我们提出的方法的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=A+Generalized+Doubly+Robust+Learning+Framework+for+Debiasing+Post-Click+Conversion+Rate+Prediction)|0|
|[User-Event Graph Embedding Learning for Context-Aware Recommendation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539458)|Dugang Liu, Mingkai He, Jinwei Luo, Jiangxu Lin, Meng Wang, Xiaolian Zhang, Weike Pan, Zhong Ming|Southeast University, Nanjing, China; Shenzhen University & Guangdong Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Economy (SZ), Shenzhen, China; Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, Shenzhen, China; Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China|Most methods for context-aware recommendation focus on improving the feature interaction layer, but overlook the embedding layer. However, an embedding layer with random initialization often suffers in practice from the sparsity of the contextual features, as well as the interactions between the users (or items) and context. In this paper, we propose a novel user-event graph embedding learning (UEG-EL) framework to address these two sparsity challenges. Specifically, our UEG-EL contains three modules: 1) a graph construction module is used to obtain a user-event graph containing nodes for users, intents and items, where the intent nodes are generated by applying intent node attention (INA) on nodes of the contextual features; 2) a user-event collaborative graph convolution module is designed to obtain the refined embeddings of all features by executing a new convolution strategy on the user-event graph, where each intent node acts as a hub to efficiently propagate the information among different features; 3) a recommendation module is equipped to integrate some existing context-aware recommendation model, where the feature embeddings are directly initialized with the obtained refined embeddings. Moreover, we identify a unique challenge of the basic framework, that is, the contextual features associated with too many instances may suffer from noise when aggregating the information. We thus further propose a simple but effective variant, i.e., UEG-EL-V, in order to prune the information propagation of the contextual features. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets to verify the effectiveness and compatibility of our UEG-EL and its variant.|大多数上下文感知的推荐方法侧重于改进特征交互层，而忽略了嵌入层。然而，具有随机初始化的嵌入层在实践中经常受到上下文特征稀疏性以及用户(或项目)与上下文之间交互的影响。本文提出了一种新的用户事件图嵌入学习(UEG-EL)框架来解决这两个稀疏性问题。具体来说，我们的 UEG-EL 包含三个模块: 1)一个图形构造模块用于获得一个包含用户、意图和项目节点的用户事件图，其中意图节点是通过在上下文特征的节点上应用意图节点注意力(INA)来生成的; 2)一个用户事件协作图卷积模块用于通过在用户事件图上执行一个新的卷积策略来获得所有特征的精细嵌入，其中每个意图节点作为一个中心来有效地传播不同特征之间的信息; 3)一个推荐模块用于集成一些现有的上下文感知的推荐模型，其中特征嵌入是直接初始化。此外，我们发现了基本框架的一个独特的挑战，即与太多实例相关的上下文特征在聚合信息时可能会受到噪声的影响。因此，我们进一步提出了一个简单而有效的变体，即 UEG-EL-V，以修剪信息传播的上下文特征。最后，我们在三个公共数据集上进行了广泛的实验，以验证我们的 UEG-EL 及其变体的有效性和兼容性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=User-Event+Graph+Embedding+Learning+for+Context-Aware+Recommendation)|0|

Most of existing studies believe that high uncertainty can be a good indicator of potential reward, and thus primarily focus on the estimation of model uncertainty. We argue that such an approach overlooks the subsequent effect of exploration on model training. From the perspective of online learning, the adoption of an exploration strategy would also affect the collecting of training data, which further influences model learning. To understand the interaction between exploration and training, we design a Pseudo-Exploration module that simulates the model updating process after a certain item is explored and the corresponding feedback is received. We further show that such a process is equivalent to adding an adversarial perturbation to the model input, and thereby name our proposed approach as an the Adversarial Gradient Driven Exploration (AGE). For production deployment, we propose a dynamic gating unit to pre-determine the utility of an exploration. This enables us to utilize the limited amount of resources for exploration, and avoid wasting pageview resources on ineffective exploration.

|[Graph-based Multilingual Language Model: Leveraging Product Relations for Search Relevance](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539158)|Nurendra Choudhary, Nikhil Rao, Karthik Subbian, Chandan K. Reddy|Amazon, Palo Alto, CA, USA; Virginia Tech, Arlington, VA, USA|The large-scale nature of product catalog and the changing demands of customer queries makes product search a challenging problem. The customer queries are ambiguous and implicit. They may be looking for an exact match of their query, or a functional equivalent (i.e., substitute), or an accessory to go with it (i.e., complement). It is important to distinguish these three categories from merely classifying an item for a customer query as relevant or not. This information can help direct the customer and improve search applications to understand the customer mission. In this paper, we formulate search relevance as a multi-class classification problem and propose a graph-based solution to classify a given query-item pair as exact, substitute, complement, or irrelevant (ESCI). The customer engagement (clicks, add-to-cart, and purchases) between query and items serve as a crucial information for this problem. However, existing approaches rely purely on the textual information (such as BERT) and do not sufficiently focus on the structural relationships. Another challenge in including the structural information is the sparsity of such data in some regions. We propose Structure-Aware multilingual LAnguage Model (SALAM), that utilizes a language model along with a graph neural network, to extract region-specific semantics as well as relational information for the classification of query-product pairs. Our model is first pre-trained on a large region-agnostic dataset and behavioral graph data and then fine-tuned on region-specific versions to address the sparsity. We show in our experiments that SALAM significantly outperforms the current matching frameworks on the ESCI classification task in several regions. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of using a two-phased training setup (i.e., pre-training and fine-tuning) in capturing region-specific information. Also, we provide various challenges and solutions for using the model in an industrial setting and outline its contribution to the e-commerce engine.|产品目录的大规模性和客户查询需求的变化使得产品搜索成为一个具有挑战性的问题。客户查询是模糊和隐式的。他们可能在寻找与他们的查询完全匹配的查询，或者功能等价的查询(即替代查询) ，或者附属查询(即补充查询)。区分这三个类别与仅仅为客户查询分类一个项目是否相关是很重要的。这些信息可以帮助指导客户并改进搜索应用程序，以理解客户的使命。本文将搜索相关性表述为一个多类分类问题，并提出了一种基于图的解决方案，将给定的查询项对分类为精确、替代、补充或不相关(ESCI)。查询和项目之间的客户参与(单击、添加到购物车和购买)是解决此问题的关键信息。然而，现有的方法仅仅依赖于文本信息(比如 BERT) ，并没有充分关注结构关系。在纳入结构信息方面的另一个挑战是，一些区域的此类数据稀少。提出了一种基于结构感知的多语言语言模型(SALAM) ，该模型利用语言模型和图神经网络提取区域特定的语义和关系信息，用于查询产品对的分类。我们的模型首先在大型区域不可知数据集和行为图数据上进行预训练，然后在区域特定版本上进行微调，以解决稀疏性问题。我们的实验表明，在 ESCI 分类任务中，SALAM 在几个地区的性能明显优于目前的匹配框架。我们还演示了使用两阶段的训练设置(即预训练和微调)在捕获特定区域的信息方面的有效性。此外，我们提供了在工业环境中使用该模型的各种挑战和解决方案，并概述了其对电子商务引擎的贡献。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Graph-based+Multilingual+Language+Model:+Leveraging+Product+Relations+for+Search+Relevance)|0|

Faster delivery promise to the customer results in increased conversion and revenue. There are typically two mechanisms to control the delivery speed - a) replication of products across warehouses, and b) air-shipping the product. In this paper, we present a machine learning based framework to recommend air-shipping eligibility for products. Specifically, we develop a causal inference framework (referred to as Air Shipping Recommendation or ASPIRE) that balances the trade-off between revenue or conversion and delivery cost to decide whether a product should be shipped via air. We propose a doubly-robust estimation technique followed by an optimization algorithm to determine air eligibility of products and calculate the uplift in revenue and shipping cost. We ran extensive experiments (both offline and online) to demonstrate the superiority of our technique as compared to the incumbent policies and baseline approaches. ASPIRE resulted in a lift of +79 bps of revenue as measured through an A/B experiment in an emerging marketplace on Amazon.|交付速度对电子商务平台的成功至关重要。更快的交付承诺给客户的结果增加转换和收入。通常有两种机制来控制交付速度: a)在仓库之间复制产品，b)空运产品。在本文中，我们提出了一个基于机器学习的框架来推荐产品的空运资格。具体来说，我们开发了一个因果推理框架(称为航空运输建议书或 ASPIRE) ，平衡收入或转换和交付成本之间的权衡，以决定是否应该通过空运运输产品。我们提出了一个双稳健估计技术和一个优化算法来确定产品的空气合格性，并计算收入和运输成本的提高。我们进行了大量的实验(线下和线上) ，以证明我们的技术相对于现有的策略和基线方法的优越性。通过在亚马逊新兴市场的 A/B 实验，ASPIRE 的收入提高了79个基点。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=ASPIRE:+Air+Shipping+Recommendation+for+E-commerce+Products+via+Causal+Inference+Framework)|0|

Conventional relevance models solely rely on the textual data, which suffer from the scarce semantic signals within the short queries. Recently, user historical click behaviors are incorporated in the format of click graphs to provide additional correlations beyond pure textual semantics, which contributes to advancing the relevance modeling performance. However, user behaviors are usually arbitrary and unpredictable, leading to the noisy and sparse graph topology. In addition, there exist other types of user behaviors besides clicks, which may also provide complementary information. In this paper, we study the novel problem of heterogeneous behavior graph learning to facilitate relevance modeling task. Our motivation lies in learning an optimal and task-relevant heterogeneous behavior graph consisting of multiple types of user behaviors. We further propose a novel HBGLR model to learn the behavior graph structure by mining the sophisticated correlations between node semantics and graph topology, and encode the textual semantics and structural heterogeneity into the learned representations. Our proposal is evaluated over real-world industry datasets, and has been mainstreamed in the Bing ads.

|[Combo-Fashion: Fashion Clothes Matching CTR Prediction with Item History](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539101)|Chenxu Zhu, Peng Du, Weinan Zhang, Yong Yu, Yang Cao|Alibaba Group, Hangzhou, China; Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China|As one of the fundamental trends for future development of recommender systems, Fashion Clothes Matching Recommendation for click-through rate (CTR) prediction has become an increasingly essential task. Unlike traditional single-item recommendation, a combo item, composed of a top item (e.g. a shirt) and a bottom item (e.g. a skirt), is recommended. In such a task, the matching effect between these two single items plays a crucial role, and greatly influences the users' preferences; however, it is usually neglected by previous approaches in CTR prediction. In this work, we tackle this problem by designing a novel algorithm called Combo-Fashion, which extracts the matching effect by introducing the matching history of the combo item with two cascaded modules: (i) Matching Search Module (MSM) seeks the popular combo items and undesirable ones as a positive set and a negative set, respectively; (ii) Matching Prediction Module (MPM) models the precise relationship between the candidate combo item and the positive/negative set by an attention-based deep model. Besides, the CPM Fashion Attribute, considered from characteristic, pattern and material, is applied to capture the matching effect further. As part of this work, we release two large-scale datasets consisting of 3.56 million and 6.01 million user behaviors with rich context and fashion information in millions of combo items. The experimental results over these two real-world datasets have demonstrated the superiority of our proposed model with significant improvements. Furthermore, we have deployed Combo-Fashion onto the platform of Taobao to recommend the combo items to the users, where an 8-day online A/B test proved the effectiveness of Combo-Fashion with an improvement of pCTR by 1.02% and uCTR by 0.70%.|作为推荐系统未来发展的基本趋势之一，服装搭配推荐系统的点进率预测已经成为一项日益重要的任务。不同于传统的单一项目推荐，一个组合项目，组成的顶部项目(如衬衫)和底部项目(如裙子) ，是推荐的。在这样一个任务中，这两个项目之间的匹配效果起着至关重要的作用，并且对用户的偏好有很大的影响，但是在以往的 CTR 预测方法中往往忽略了这一点。针对这一问题，本文设计了一种新的组合时尚算法，该算法通过引入组合项目的匹配历史来提取匹配效果，该算法由两个级联模块组成: (1)匹配搜索模块(MSM)分别将流行的组合项目和不受欢迎的组合项目作为一个正集和一个负集来搜索; (2)匹配预测模块(MPM)通过基于注意的深度模型来建立候选组合项目与正/负集之间的精确关系。此外，从特征、图案和材质三个方面考虑，运用 CPM 时尚属性进一步捕捉匹配效果。作为这项工作的一部分，我们发布了两个大型数据集，包括356万和601万用户行为，其中包含数百万个组合项目的丰富上下文和时尚信息。在这两个实际数据集上的实验结果显示了我们提出的模型的优越性，并有显著的改进。此外，我们还在淘宝平台上部署了 Combo-Fashion，向用户推荐组合项目，通过8天的在线 A/B 测试证明了 Combo-Fashion 的有效性，pCTR 提高了1.02% ，uCTR 提高了0.70% 。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Combo-Fashion:+Fashion+Clothes+Matching+CTR+Prediction+with+Item+History)|0|

|[Low-rank Nonnegative Tensor Decomposition in Hyperbolic Space](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539317)|Bo Hui, WeiShinn Ku|Auburn University, Auburn, AL, USA|Tensor decomposition aims to factorize an input tensor into a number of latent factors. Due to the low-rank nature of tensor in real applications, the latent factors can be used to perform tensor completion in numerous tasks, such as knowledge graph completion and timely recommendation. However, existing works solve the problem in Euclidean space, where the tensor is decomposed into Euclidean vectors. Recent studies show that hyperbolic space is roomier than Euclidean space. With the same dimension, a hyperbolic vector can represent richer information (e.g., hierarchical structure) than a Euclidean vector. In this paper, we propose to decompose tensor in hyperbolic space. Considering that the most popular optimization tools (e.g, SGD, Adam) have not been generalized in hyperbolic space, we design an adaptive optimization algorithm according to the distinctive property of hyperbolic manifold. To address the non-convex property of the problem, we adopt gradient ascent in our optimization algorithm to avoid getting trapped in local optimal landscapes. We conduct experiments on various tensor completion tasks and the result validates the superiority of our method over these baselines that solve the problem in Euclidean space.|张量分解旨在将输入张量分解为若干潜在因子。由于张量在实际应用中的低秩特性，潜在因子可以用来完成许多任务，如知识图的完成和及时推荐。然而，现有的工作解决了欧氏空间中的问题，其中张量分解成欧氏向量。最近的研究表明双曲空间比欧几里得空间更宽敞。在相同的维度下，双曲向量可以比矢量表示更丰富的信息(例如，层次结构)。在这篇文章中，我们提出在双曲空间中分解张量。考虑到最流行的优化工具(例如，SGD，Adam)还没有在双曲空间中推广，我们根据双曲流形的独特性质设计了一个自适应优化算法。为了解决该问题的非凸性，在优化算法中采用了梯度上升的方法，以避免陷入局部最优景观中。我们对各种张量完成任务进行了实验，实验结果验证了该方法相对于这些基线解决欧氏空间问题的优越性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Low-rank+Nonnegative+Tensor+Decomposition+in+Hyperbolic+Space)|0|

|[G2NET: A General Geography-Aware Representation Network for Hotel Search Ranking](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539025)|Jia Xu, Fei Xiong, Zulong Chen, Mingyuan Tao, Liangyue Li, Quan Lu|Guangxi University, Nanning, China; Alibaba Group, Hangzhou, China|Hotel search ranking is the core function of Online Travel Platforms (OTPs), while geography information of location entities involved in it plays a critically important role in guaranteeing its ranking quality. The closest line of works to the hotel search ranking problem is thus the next POI (or location) recommendation problem, which has extensive works but fails to cope with two new challenges, i.e., consideration of two more location entities and effective utilization of geographical information, in a hotel search ranking scenario. To this end, we propose a General Geography-aware representation NETwork (G2NET for short) to better represent geography information of location entities so as to optimize the hotel search ranking. In G2NET, to address the first challenge, we first propose the concept of Geography Interaction Schema (GIS) which is a meta template for representing the arbitrary number of location entity types and their interactions. Then, a novel geography interaction encoder is devised providing general representation ability for an instance of GIS, followed by an attentive operation that aggregates representations of instances corresponding to all historically interacted hotels of a user in a weighted manner. The second challenge is handled by the combined application of three proposed geography embedding modules in G2NET, each of which focuses on computing embeddings of location entities based on a certain aspect of geographical information of location entities. Moreover, a self-attention layer is deployed in G2NET, to capture correlations among historically interacted hotels of a user which provides non-trivial functionality of understanding the user's behaviors. Both offline and online experiments show that G2NET outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. G2NET has now been successfully deployed to provide the high-quality hotel search ranking service at Fliggy, one of the most popular OTPs in China, serving tens of millions of users.|酒店搜索排名是在线旅游平台(OTP)的核心功能，而位置实体的地理信息对于保证其排名质量起着至关重要的作用。因此，与酒店搜索排名问题最接近的工作是下一个 POI (或位置)推荐问题，这个问题有大量的工作，但未能应对两个新的挑战，即在一个酒店搜索排名场景中考虑另外两个位置实体和有效利用地理信息。为此，我们提出了一个通用地理感知表示网络(G2NET) ，以更好地表示位置实体的地理信息，从而优化酒店搜索排名。在 G2NET 中，为了应对第一个挑战，我们首先提出了地理交互模式(GIS)的概念，它是一个元模板，用于表示任意数量的位置实体类型及其交互。然后，设计了一种新颖的地理交互编码器，提供了 GIS 实例的一般表示能力，然后进行了注意操作，以加权的方式聚合了对应于用户的所有历史交互酒店的实例表示。第二个挑战是通过在 G2NET 中联合应用三个地理嵌入模块来解决，每个模块的重点都是基于位置实体的地理信息的某一方面来计算位置实体的嵌入。此外，在 G2NET 中部署了一个自我关注层，以捕获用户在历史上交互的酒店之间的相关性，从而提供了理解用户行为的重要功能。离线和在线实验都表明，G2NET 的性能优于最先进的方法。目前，g2NET 已成功部署到 Fliggy，为数千万用户提供高质量的酒店搜索排名服务。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=G2NET:+A+General+Geography-Aware+Representation+Network+for+Hotel+Search+Ranking)|0|

Our proposed embedding, called NEWS, makes no similarity assumptions, avoiding potential risks to privacy and fairness.

Transferring knowledge from information-rich domains to help user modeling is an effective way to address the user-side cold-start problem. Our previous work demonstrated that general-purpose user embeddings based on mobile app usage helped article recommendations. However, high-dimensional embeddings are cumbersome for online usage, thus limiting the adoption. On the other hand, user clustering, which partitions users into several groups, can provide a lightweight, online-friendly, and explainable way to help recommendations. Effective user clustering for article recommendations based on mobile app usage faces unique challenges, including (1) the gap between an active user's behavior of mobile app usage and article reading, and (2) the gap between mobile app usage patterns of active and cold-start users. To address the challenges, we propose a tailored Dual Alignment User Clustering (DAUC) model, which applies a sample-wise contrastive alignment to eliminate the gap between active users' mobile app usage and article reading behavior, and a distribution-wise adversarial alignment to eliminate the gap between active users' and cold-start users' app usage behavior. With DAUC, cold-start recommendation-optimized user clustering based on mobile app usage can be achieved. On top of the user clusters, we further build candidate generation strategies, real-time features, and corresponding ranking models without much engineering difficulty.

|[Promotheus: An End-to-End Machine Learning Framework for Optimizing Markdown in Online Fashion E-commerce](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539148)|Eleanor Loh, Jalaj Khandelwal, Brian Regan, Duncan A. Little|ASOS.com, London, United Kingdom|Managing discount promotional events ("markdown") is a significant part of running an e-commerce business, and inefficiencies here can significantly hamper a retailer's profitability. Traditional approaches for tackling this problem rely heavily on price elasticity modelling. However, the partial information nature of price elasticity modelling, together with the non-negotiable responsibility for protecting profitability, mean that machine learning practitioners must often go through great lengths to define strategies for measuring offline model quality. In the face of this, many retailers fall back on rule-based methods, thus forgoing significant gains in profitability that can be captured by machine learning. In this paper, we introduce two novel end-to-end markdown management systems for optimising markdown at different stages of a retailer's journey. The first system, "Ithax," enacts a rational supply-side pricing strategy without demand estimation, and can be usefully deployed as a "cold start" solution to collect markdown data while maintaining revenue control. The second system, "Promotheus," presents a full framework for markdown optimization with price elasticity. We describe in detail the specific modelling and validation procedures that, within our experience, have been crucial to building a system that performs robustly in the real world. Both markdown systems achieve superior profitability compared to decisions made by our experienced operations teams in a controlled online test, with improvements of 86% (Promotheus) and 79% (Ithax) relative to manual strategies.

Most of the current ULTR methods are based on the examination hypothesis (EH), which assumes that the click probability can be factorized into two scalar functions, one related to ranking features and the other related to bias factors. Unfortunately, the interactions among features, bias factors and clicks are complicated in practice, and usually cannot be factorized in this independent way. Fitting click data with EH could lead to model misspecification and bring the approximation error. In this paper, we propose a vector-based EH and formulate the click probability as a dot product of two vector functions. This solution is complete due to its universality in fitting arbitrary click functions. Based on it, we propose a novel model named Vectorization to adaptively learn the relevance embeddings and sort documents by projecting embeddings onto a base vector. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art ULTR methods on complex real clicks as well as simple simulated clicks.|无偏学习排名(ULTR)的目的是从有偏见的用户点击日志中训练一个无偏见的排名模型。目前的 ULTR 方法大多基于检验假设(EH) ，假设点击概率可以分解为两个标量函数，一个与排序特征有关，另一个与偏差因子有关。遗憾的是，特征、偏差因素和点击之间的相互作用在实践中是复杂的，通常不能以这种独立的方式进行因子分解。将 click 数据与 EH 进行匹配可能导致模型错误说明，并带来逼近误差。本文提出了一种基于向量的 EH，并将点击概率表示为两个向量函数的点乘。该解决方案是完整的，因为它在拟合任意点击函数的通用性。在此基础上，提出了一种新的向量化模型，通过向基向量投影来自适应地学习相关嵌入和排序文档。大量的实验表明，我们的方法在复杂的真实点击和简单的模拟点击方面明显优于最先进的 ULTR 方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Scalar+is+Not+Enough:+Vectorization-based+Unbiased+Learning+to+Rank)|0|
|[Efficient Approximate Algorithms for Empirical Variance with Hashed Block Sampling](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539377)|Xingguang Chen, Fangyuan Zhang, Sibo Wang|The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China|Empirical variance is a fundamental concept widely used in data management and data analytics, e.g., query optimization, approximate query processing, and feature selection. A direct solution to derive the empirical variance is scanning the whole data table, which is expensive when the data size is huge. Hence, most current works focus on approximate answers by sampling. For results with approximation guarantees, the samples usually need to be uniformly independent random, incurring high cache miss rates especially in compact columnar style layouts. An alternative uses block sampling to avoid this issue, which directly samples a block of consecutive records fitting page sizes instead of sampling one record each time. However, this provides no theoretical guarantee. Existing studies show that the practical estimations can be inaccurate as the records within a block can be correlated. Motivated by this, we investigate how to provide approximation guarantees for empirical variances with block sampling from a theoretical perspective. Our results shows that if the records stored in a table are 4-wise independent to each other according to keys, a slightly modified block sampling can provide the same approximation guarantee with the same asymptotic sampling cost as that of independent random sampling. In practice, storing records via hash clusters or hash organized tables are typical scenarios in modern commercial database systems. Thus, for data analysis on tables in the data lake or OLAP stores that are exported from such hash-based storage, our strategy can be easily integrated to improve the sampling efficiency. Based on our sampling strategy, we present an approximate algorithm for empirical variance and an approximate top-k algorithm to return the k columns with the highest empirical variance scores. Extensive experiments show that our solutions outperform existing solutions by up to an order of magnitude.|经验方差是数据管理和数据分析中广泛使用的一个基本概念，如查询优化、近似查询处理和特征选择。推导经验方差的直接方法是对整个数据表进行扫描，当数据量很大时，扫描成本很高。因此，目前大多数的工作集中在抽样近似答案。对于具有近似保证的结果，样本通常需要是一致独立的随机的，特别是在紧凑的柱状样式布局中，会导致高缓存错过率。另一种方法是使用块抽样来避免这个问题，即直接抽样一个连续的记录块来适应页面大小，而不是每次抽样一个记录。然而，这并不能提供理论上的保证。现有的研究表明，实际的估计可能是不准确的，因为一个区块内的记录可以相关。在此基础上，我们从理论的角度研究了如何为区组抽样的经验方差提供近似保证。结果表明，如果存储在表中的记录按键相互独立，稍加修改的块抽样可以提供与独立随机抽样相同的渐近抽样代价的近似保证。在实践中，通过散列集群或散列组织表存储记录是现代商业数据库系统中的典型场景。因此，对于从这种基于散列的存储器导出的数据湖或 OLAP 存储器中的表的数据分析，可以很容易地将我们的策略集成起来以提高采样效率。基于我们的抽样策略，我们提出了一个经验方差的近似算法和一个近似 top-k 算法来返回经验方差得分最高的 k 列。大量的实验表明，我们的解决方案比现有解决方案的性能高出一个数量级。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Efficient+Approximate+Algorithms+for+Empirical+Variance+with+Hashed+Block+Sampling)|0|
|[Towards a Native Quantum Paradigm for Graph Representation Learning: A Sampling-based Recurrent Embedding Approach](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539327)|Ge Yan, Yehui Tang, Junchi Yan|Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China|Graph representation learning has been extensively studied, and recent models can well incorporate both node features and graph structures. Despite these progress, the inherent scalability challenge for classical computers of processing graph data and solving the downstream tasks (many are NP-hard) is still a bottleneck for existing classical graph learning models. On the other hand, quantum computing is known a promising direction for its theoretically verified scalability as well as the increasing evidence for the access to physical quantum machine in near-term. Different from many existing classical-quantum hybrid machine learning models on graphs, in this paper we take a more aggressive initiative for developing a native quantum paradigm for (attributed) graph representation learning, which to our best knowledge, has not been fulfilled in literature yet. Specifically, our model adopts the well-established theory and technique in quantum computing e.g. quantum random walk, and adapt it to the attributed graph. Then the node attribute quantum state sequence is fed into a quantum recurrent network to obtain the final node embedding. Experimental results on three public datasets show the effectiveness of our quantum model which also outperforms a classical learning approach GraphRNA notably in terms of efficiency even on a classical computer. Though it is still restricted to the classical loss-based learning paradigm with gradient descent for model parameter training, while our computing scheme is compatible with quantum computing without involving classical computers. This is in fact largely in contrast to many hybrid quantum graph learning models which often involve many steps and modules having to be performed on classical computers.|图表示学习已经得到了广泛的研究，现有的模型能够很好地结合节点特征和图结构。尽管取得了这些进展，经典计算机在处理图形数据和解决下游任务(许多是 NP 难的)方面固有的可伸缩性挑战仍然是现有经典图形学习模型的瓶颈。另一方面，量子计算因其在理论上被证实的可扩展性以及近期越来越多的物理量子计算的证据而被认为是一个有前途的方向。与许多现有的经典-量子混合机器学习模型不同，本文采取了更积极的主动性，开发了一个本土的量子范式(属性)图表示学习，据我们所知，这尚未在文献中得到实现。具体地说，我们的模型采用了量子计算中已经成熟的理论和技术，例如量子随机游走，并将其适用于属性图。然后将节点属性量子状态序列输入到量子递归网络中，得到最终的节点嵌入。在三个公共数据集上的实验结果表明了量子模型的有效性，即使在经典的计算机上，量子模型的效率也明显优于经典的学习方法 GraphRNA。虽然我们的计算机系统仍然局限于传统的以损失为基础的学习范式，并且只有模型参数训练的梯度下降法，但我们的计算机系统可以与量子计算兼容，而不需要使用传统的计算机。这实际上在很大程度上与许多混合量子图学习模型形成对比，这些模型通常涉及许多步骤和模块，必须在经典计算机上执行。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Towards+a+Native+Quantum+Paradigm+for+Graph+Representation+Learning:+A+Sampling-based+Recurrent+Embedding+Approach)|0|

As a core component, dialogue state tracking (DST) plays a key role in task-oriented dialogue systems, and its function is to parse natural language dialogues into dialogue state formed by slot-value pairs. It is well known that dialogue state tracking has been well studied and explored on current benchmark datasets such as the MultiWOZ. However, almost all current research completely ignores the user negative feedback utterances that exist in real-life conversations when a system error occurs, which often contains user-provided corrective information for the system error. Obviously, user negative feedback utterances can be used to correct the inevitable errors in automatic speech recognition and model generalization. Thus, in this paper, we will explore the role of negative feedback utterances in dialogue state tracking in detail through simulated negative feedback utterances. Specifically, due to the lack of dataset involving negative feedback utterances, first, we have to define the schema of user negative feedback utterances and propose a joint modeling method for feedback utterance generation and filtering. Then, we explore three aspects of interaction mechanism that should be considered in real-life conversations involving negative feedback utterances and propose evaluation metrics related to negative feedback utterances. Finally, on WOZ2.0 and MultiWOZ2.1 datasets, by constructing simulated negative feedback utterances in training and testing, we not only verify the important role of negative feedback utterances in dialogue state tracking, but also analyze the advantages and disadvantages of different interaction mechanisms involving negative feedback utterances, lighting future research on negative feedback utterances.|近年来，对话系统的研究受到了广泛的关注，尤其是面向任务的对话系统，由于其广阔的应用前景而受到越来越多的关注。对话状态跟踪(DST)是任务导向对话系统的核心组成部分，其功能是将自然语言对话解析为由插槽值对形成的对话状态。众所周知，对话状态跟踪已经在当前的基准数据集(如 MultiWOZ)上得到了很好的研究和探索。然而，目前几乎所有的研究都完全忽视了系统错误发生时用户在现实交谈中的负面反馈语，其中往往包含用户提供的系统错误纠正信息。显然，用户负反馈话语可以用来纠正语音自动识别和模型推广中不可避免的错误。因此，本文将通过模拟负反馈话语来详细探讨负反馈话语在对话状态跟踪中的作用。具体来说，由于缺乏涉及负反馈话语的数据集，首先，我们必须定义用户负反馈话语的模式，并提出一种联合建模的方法来生成和过滤反馈话语。然后，从三个方面探讨了负反馈话语在现实会话中应该考虑的互动机制，并提出了与负反馈话语相关的评价指标。最后，在 WOZ2.0和 MultiWOZ2.1数据集上，通过构建训练和测试中的模拟负反馈话语，不仅验证了负反馈话语在对话状态跟踪中的重要作用，而且分析了负反馈话语不同交互机制的优缺点，为进一步研究负反馈话语提供参考。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Toward+Real-life+Dialogue+State+Tracking+Involving+Negative+Feedback+Utterances)|0|

In this paper, we focus on the real-world scenario where these factors can be explicitly captured (the users are exposed with decision factor-based persuasion texts, i.e., persuasion factors). Although it allows us for explicit modeling of user-decision process, there are critical challenges including the persuasion factor's representation learning and effect estimation, along with the data-sparsity problem. To address them, in this work, we present our POEM (short for Persuasion factOr Effect Modeling) system. We first propose the persuasion-factor graph convolutional layers for encoding and learning representations from the persuasion-aware interaction data. Then we develop a prediction layer that fully considers the user sensitivity to the persuasion factors.

Mining this knowledge can: (a) immediately help better explain observed and predicted player behavior; and (b) consequently propel deeper understanding towards players' experience, growth and protection. To this effect, we focus on discovery of the "game behaviours" as micro-patterns formed by continuous sequence of games and the persistent "play styles" of the players' as a sequence of such sequences on an online skill gaming platform for Rummy. We propose a two stage deep neural network, CognitionNet. The first stage focuses on mining game behaviours as cluster representations in a latent space while the second aggregates over these micro patterns to discover play styles via a supervised classification objective around player engagement. The dual objective allows CognitionNet to reveal several player psychology inspired decision making and tactics.

Existing recommender system poisoning methods mainly focus on promoting the recommendation chances of target items due to financial incentives. In fact, in real-world scenarios, the attacker may also attempt to degrade the overall performance of recommender systems. However, existing general FL poisoning methods for degrading model performance are either ineffective or not concealed in poisoning federated recommender systems. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective and covert poisoning attack method on federated recommendation, named FedAttack. Its core idea is using globally hardest samples to subvert model training. More specifically, the malicious clients first infer user embeddings based on local user profiles. Next, they choose the candidate items that are most relevant to the user embeddings as hardest negative samples, and find the candidates farthest from the user embeddings as hardest positive samples. The model gradients inferred from these poisoned samples are then uploaded for aggregation.

Deep learning is widely applied to mine expressive tags to users from their historical interactions in the system, e.g., click, conversion action in the advertising chain. The usual approach is to take a certain action as the objective, and introduce multiple independent Two-Tower models to predict the possibility of users' action on tags (known as CTR or CVR prediction). The predicted users' high probably attractive tags are to represent their preferences. However, the single-action models cannot learn complementarily and support effective training on data-sparse actions. Besides, limited by the lack of information fusion between the two towers, the model learns insufficiently to represent users' preferences on various tag topics well. This paper introduces a novel multi-task model called Mixture of Virtual-Kernel Experts (MVKE) to learn user preferences on various actions and topics unitedly. In MVKE, we propose a concept of Virtual-Kernel Expert, which focuses on modeling one particular facet of the user's preferences, and all of them learn coordinately. Besides, the gate-based structure used in MVKE builds an information fusion bridge between two towers, improving the model's capability and maintaining high efficiency.

When applying such a type of network on the graph without node features, one can extract simple graph-based node features (e.g., number of degrees) or learn the input node representations (i.e., embeddings) when training the network. While the latter approach, which trains node embeddings, more likely leads to better performance, the number of parameters associated with the embeddings grows linearly with the number of nodes. It is therefore impractical to train the input node embeddings together with GNNs within graphics processing unit (GPU) memory in an end-to-end fashion when dealing with industrial-scale graph data.

Intelligent pre-consultation (IPC) is a relatively new application deployed on mobile terminals for collecting patient's information before a face-to-face consultation. It takes advantages of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to assist doctors on clinical decision-making. One of key functions of IPC is to detect medical symptoms from patient queries. By extracting symptoms from patient queries, IPC is able to collect more information on patient's health status by asking symptom-related questions. All collected information will be summarized as a medical record for doctors to make clinical decision. This saves a great deal of time for both doctors and patients. Detecting symptoms from patient's query is challenging, as most patients lack medical background and often tend to use colloquial language to describe their symptoms. In this work, we formulate symptom detection as a retrieval problem and propose a bi-directional hard-negative enforced noise contrastive estimation method (Bi-hardNCE) to tackle the symptom detection problem. Bi-hardNCE has both forward contrastive estimation and backward contrastive estimation, which forces model to distinguish the true symptom from negative symptoms and meanwhile distinguish true query from negative queries. To include more informative negatives, our Bi-hardNCE adopts a hard-negative mining strategy and a false-negative eliminating strategy, which achieved a significant improvement on performance. Our proposed model outperforms commonly used retrieval models by a large margin.|在医疗应用中运用人工智能（AI）技术，有助于全球应对医护人员短缺问题，并提升医疗服务的效率与生产力。智能预问诊（IPC）作为新兴移动终端应用，可在面诊前收集患者信息。该系统依托前沿机器学习技术辅助医生进行临床决策，其核心功能是从患者主诉中识别医疗症状。通过提取症状信息，IPC能进一步提出症状相关问题以获取更全面的健康状况数据，所有采集信息将汇总成医疗档案供医生临床决策，显著节省医患双方时间。由于患者多缺乏医学背景且常使用口语化描述，症状检测面临巨大挑战。本研究将症状检测构建为检索任务，提出双向硬负样本增强噪声对比估计方法（Bi-hardNCE）。该模型同时具备前向对比估计与后向对比估计机制，既能区分真实症状与负样本症状，又能区分真实主诉与负样本主诉。通过采用硬负样本挖掘策略和假负样本消除策略，Bi-hardNCE实现了更具信息量的负样本纳入，显著提升检测性能。实验表明，该模型性能远超常用检索模型。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Medical+Symptom+Detection+in+Intelligent+Pre-Consultation+Using+Bi-directional+Hard-Negative+Noise+Contrastive+Estimation)|0|
|[User-tag Profile Modeling in Recommendation System via Contrast Weighted Tag Masking](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539102)|Chenxu Zhu, Peng Du, Xianghui Zhu, Weinan Zhang, Yong Yu, Yang Cao|Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; Alibaba Grp, Beijing, Peoples R China|User-tag profile modeling has become one of the novel and significant trends for the future development of industrial recommendation systems, which can be divided into two fundamental tasks: User Preferred Tag (UPT) and Tag Preferred User (TPU) in practical scenarios. In most existing deep learning models for user-tag profiling, the network inputs all the combined tags of the item with the user features when training but inputs only one tag with the user feature to evaluate the user's preference on a single tag when testing. This leads to data discrepancy between the training and testing samples. To address such an issue, we attempt a novel Random Masking Model (RMM) to remain only one tag at the training time by masking. However, it causes two other serious downsides. First, not all tags attached to the same item are equally predictive. Irrelevant tags may introduce noisy signals and thus cause performance degradation. Second, it neglects the impact of combined tags aggregated together, which may be an essential factor leading to user clicks. Therefore, we further propose a framework called Contrast Weighted Tag Masking (CWTM) in this work, which tackles these two issues with two modules: (i) Weighted Masking Module (WMM) introduces the importance network to compute a score for each tag attached to the item and then samples from these tags weightedly according to the score; (ii) Contrast Module (CM) makes use of a contrastive learning architecture to inherit and distill some understanding about the effect of aggregated tags. Offline experiments on four datasets (three public datasets and one proprietary industrial dataset) demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of CWTM over the state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, CWTM has been deployed on the training platform of Alibaba advertising systems and achieved substantial improvements of ROI and CVR by 16.8% and 9.6%, respectively.|用户标签画像建模已成为工业推荐系统未来发展的新兴重要趋势，在实际场景中可分解为两大基础任务：用户偏好标签（UPT）和标签偏好用户（TPU）。现有大多数用户标签画像深度学习模型在训练时将商品所有组合标签与用户特征共同输入网络，但在测试时仅使用单一标签与用户特征评估用户对单个标签的偏好，导致训练样本与测试样本存在数据分布差异。为解决该问题，我们尝试采用随机掩码模型（RMM）在训练时通过掩码仅保留一个标签。然而这种方法会引发两个新问题：首先，同一商品的所有标签并非都具有同等预测力，无关标签可能引入噪声信号导致性能下降；其次，该方法忽略了组合标签聚合产生的影响，而这可能是引发用户点击的关键因素。因此，我们进一步提出对比加权标签掩码框架（CWTM），通过两个核心模块解决上述问题：（1）加权掩码模块（WMM）引入重要性网络计算商品各标签的权重分数，并依此进行加权采样；（2）对比模块（CM）采用对比学习架构继承并提炼对聚合标签效应的理解。在四个数据集（三个公共数据集和一个工业专有数据集）上的离线实验表明，CWTM在效果上显著优于现有最优基线模型。此外，CWTM已部署于阿里巴巴广告系统训练平台，成功实现投资回报率（ROI）和转化率（CVR）分别提升16.8%和9.6%的显著改进。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=User-tag+Profile+Modeling+in+Recommendation+System+via+Contrast+Weighted+Tag+Masking)|0|

Our objective in this problem is to minimize the query complexity while ensuring accuracy. We propose a method to select the query node such that we can push the search process as much as possible and an online method to infer which node is the target after collecting a new answer.

However, most existing work imposes strong distributional assumptions (e.g., Beta distribution) to represent entities and queries into presumed distributional shape, which limits their expressive power. Moreover, query embeddings are challenging due to the relational complexities in multi-relational KGs (e.g., symmetry, anti-symmetry and transitivity). To bridge the gap, we propose a logical query reasoning framework, Line Embedding (LinE), for FOL queries. To relax the distributional assumptions, we introduce the logic space transformation layer, which is a generic neural function that converts embeddings from probabilistic distribution space to LinE embeddings space. To tackle multi-relational and logical complexities, we formulate neural relation-specific projections and individual logical operators to truthfully ground LinE query embeddings on logical regularities and KG factoids. Lastly, to verify the LinE embedding quality, we generate a FOL query dataset from WordNet, which richly encompasses hierarchical relations. Extensive experiments show superior reasoning sensitivity of LinE on three benchmarks against strong baselines, particularly for multi-hop relational queries and negation-related queries.|知识图谱（KG）上的一阶逻辑（FOL）查询推理通过逻辑运算符（包括合取、析取、存在量词与否定）在嵌入空间中执行查询推断以逼近真实答案。然而现有研究大多采用强分布假设（如贝塔分布）将实体与查询映射至预设分布形态，限制了其表达能力。此外，由于多关系知识图谱中存在复杂关系特性（如对称性、非对称性与传递性），查询嵌入面临巨大挑战。为此，我们提出面向一阶逻辑查询的逻辑推理框架Line Embedding（LinE）。为弱化分布假设，我们设计了逻辑空间转换层——一种将嵌入从概率分布空间转换至LinE嵌入空间的通用神经函数。针对多关系与逻辑复杂性，我们构建了神经关系特定投影与独立逻辑运算符，使LinE查询嵌入忠实遵循逻辑规则与知识图谱事实。最后，为验证LinE嵌入质量，我们从富含层次关系的WordNet中生成了一阶逻辑查询数据集。大量实验表明，LinE在三个基准数据集上对多跳关系查询和否定相关查询展现出卓越的推理敏感性，显著优于现有强基线模型。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=LinE:+Logical+Query+Reasoning+over+Hierarchical+Knowledge+Graphs)|0|

In this work, we introduce an automatic method to design the BO search space with the aid of tuning history from past tasks. This simple yet effective approach can be used to endow many existing BO methods with transfer learning capabilities. In addition, it enjoys the three advantages: universality, generality, and safeness.

In this paper, an effective graph structural attack is investigated to disrupt graph spectral filters in the Fourier domain, which are the theoretical foundation of GCNs. We define the notion of spectral distance based on the eigenvalues of graph Laplacian to measure the disruption of spectral filters. We realize the attack by maximizing the spectral distance and propose an efficient approximation to reduce the time complexity brought by eigen-decomposition. The experiments demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness of the proposed attack in both black-box and white-box settings for both test-time evasion attacks and training-time poisoning attacks. Our qualitative analysis suggests the connection between the imposed spectral changes in the Fourier domain and the attack behavior in the spatial domain, which provides empirical evidence that maximizing spectral distance is an effective way to change the graph structural property and thus disturb the frequency components for graph filters to affect the learning of GCNs.|图卷积网络（GCN）因其在图学习任务中展现出的优异性能激发了广泛研究兴趣，但同时也被证实易受对抗攻击影响。本文研究了一种有效的图结构攻击方法，通过干扰傅里叶域的图谱滤波器——该理论构成GCN的基础框架——来实现攻击效果。我们基于图拉普拉斯矩阵的特征值定义了谱距离概念，用以衡量对谱滤波器的破坏程度。通过最大化谱距离实现攻击，并提出一种高效近似算法以降低特征分解带来的时间复杂度。实验证明，所提出的攻击方法在黑盒与白盒设置下，针对测试阶段规避攻击和训练阶段投毒攻击均具有显著效果。定性分析表明，傅里叶域的频谱变化与空间域的攻击行为存在关联，这为"最大化谱距离是通过改变图结构属性来干扰图谱滤波器频率成分，进而影响GCN学习"的有效性提供了实证依据。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Graph+Structural+Attack+by+Perturbing+Spectral+Distance)|0|

To deal with this issue, counterfactual learning has received much attention, where existing approaches can be categorized as either value learning or policy learning approaches.

|[FedWalk: Communication Efficient Federated Unsupervised Node Embedding with Differential Privacy](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539308)|Qiying Pan, Yifei Zhu||Node embedding aims to map nodes in the complex graph into low-dimensional representations. The real-world large-scale graphs and difficulties of labeling motivate wide studies of unsupervised node embedding problems. Nevertheless, previous effort mostly operates in a centralized setting where a complete graph is given. With the growing awareness of data privacy, data holders who are only aware of one vertex and its neighbours demand greater privacy protection. In this paper, we introduce FedWalk, a random-walk-based unsupervised node embedding algorithm that operates in such a node-level visibility graph with raw graph information remaining locally. FedWalk is designed to offer centralized competitive graph representation capability with data privacy protection and great communication efficiency. FedWalk instantiates the prevalent federated paradigm and contains three modules. We first design a hierarchical clustering tree (HCT) constructor to extract the structural feature of each node. A dynamic time warping algorithm seamlessly handles the structural heterogeneity across different nodes. Based on the constructed HCT, we then design a random walk generator, wherein a sequence encoder is designed to preserve privacy and a two-hop neighbor predictor is designed to save communication cost. The generated random walks are then used to update node embedding based on a SkipGram model. Extensive experiments on two large graphs demonstrate that Fed-Walk achieves competitive representativeness as a centralized node embedding algorithm does with only up to 1.8% Micro-F1 score and 4.4% Marco-F1 score loss while reducing about 6.7 times of inter-device communication per walk.|节点嵌入旨在将复杂网络中的节点映射为低维表示。现实世界的大规模图数据与标注困难性推动了无监督节点嵌入问题的广泛研究。然而现有方法大多基于集中式设置运行，需获取完整的图结构。随着数据隐私意识的增强，仅掌握单个顶点及其邻域信息的数据持有者需要更强的隐私保护。本文提出FedWalk——一种基于随机游走的无监督节点嵌入算法，可在仅具有节点级可见性的图数据上运行，保持原始图信息始终存储于本地。该算法在实现与集中式方法竞争力相当的图表示能力的同时，兼具数据隐私保护特性和优异的通信效率。FedWalk具体实现了联邦学习范式，包含三大核心模块：首先设计层次化聚类树（HCT）构造器以提取节点结构特征，通过动态时间规整算法无缝处理不同节点间的结构异质性；基于构建的HCT，设计包含隐私保护序列编码器和双跳邻居预测器的随机游走生成器以节省通信成本；生成的游走序列最终通过SkipGram模型更新节点嵌入。在两大真实图谱上的实验表明，FedWalk仅产生最高1.8%的Micro-F1分数和4.4%的Macro-F1分数损失即可达到与集中式节点嵌入算法相当的表示能力，同时将每次游走的设备间通信量降低约6.7倍。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=FedWalk:+Communication+Efficient+Federated+Unsupervised+Node+Embedding+with+Differential+Privacy)|0|
|[Fair Ranking as Fair Division: Impact-Based Individual Fairness in Ranking](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539353)|Yuta Saito, Thorsten Joachims|Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA|Rankings have become the primary interface in two-sided online markets. Many have noted that the rankings not only affect the satisfaction of the users (e.g., customers, listeners, employers, travelers), but that the position in the ranking allocates exposure -- and thus economic opportunity -- to the ranked items (e.g., articles, products, songs, job seekers, restaurants, hotels). This has raised questions of fairness to the items, and most existing works have addressed fairness by explicitly linking item exposure to item relevance. However, we argue that any particular choice of such a link function may be difficult to defend, and we show that the resulting rankings can still be unfair. To avoid these shortcomings, we develop a new axiomatic approach that is rooted in principles of fair division. This not only avoids the need to choose a link function, but also more meaningfully quantifies the impact on the items beyond exposure. Our axioms of envy-freeness and dominance over uniform ranking postulate that for a fair ranking policy every item should prefer their own rank allocation over that of any other item, and that no item should be actively disadvantaged by the rankings. To compute ranking policies that are fair according to these axioms, we propose a new ranking objective related to the Nash Social Welfare. We show that the solution has guarantees regarding its envy-freeness, its dominance over uniform rankings for every item, and its Pareto optimality. In contrast, we show that conventional exposure-based fairness can produce large amounts of envy and have a highly disparate impact on the items. Beyond these theoretical results, we illustrate empirically how our framework controls the trade-off between impact-based individual item fairness and user utility.|排名已成为双边在线市场的主要界面。许多研究指出，排名不仅影响用户（如顾客、听众、雇主、旅行者）的满意度，更通过排序位置为被排名对象（如文章、产品、歌曲、求职者、餐厅、酒店）分配曝光度——进而影响其经济机会。这引发了关于对待被排名对象公平性的讨论，现有研究大多通过将曝光度与内容相关性显式关联来实现公平。然而我们认为，这种关联函数的具体选择往往缺乏理论依据，且实证表明由此产生的排名仍可能存在不公。为克服这些缺陷，我们基于公平分配原则提出了一种新的公理化方法。该方法不仅无需选择关联函数，还能超越曝光度维度更有效地量化排名对被排名对象的影响。我们提出的"无嫉妒性"和"均匀排名优势"公理要求：在公平排名策略下，每个被排名对象都应更偏好自身获得的排名分配而非其他对象的排名分配，且没有对象会因排名策略而处于主动劣势。为实现符合这些公理要求的排名策略，我们提出了与纳什社会福利相关的新排名目标函数。研究证明该解决方案具有无嫉妒性保障、对所有对象的均匀排名优势特性以及帕累托最优性。相比之下，传统基于曝光度的公平性方法可能产生严重嫉妒现象并对不同对象造成高度差异化影响。除理论成果外，我们通过实证研究表明该框架如何基于影响力实现个体公平性与用户效用的权衡控制。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Fair+Ranking+as+Fair+Division:+Impact-Based+Individual+Fairness+in+Ranking)|0|

Concretely, we build a query-specific relation graph to model the complicated query-document relationship from an entity view. Then a graph neural network and node weight adjust algorithm are applied to the relation graph to obtain context-aware entity representations and document representations at each selection step. The diversity features are derived from the updated node representations of the relation graph.

The key idea of existing GNN-based recommender systems is to recursively perform the message passing along the user-item interaction edge for refining the encoded embeddings. Despite their effectiveness, however, most of the current recommendation models rely on sufficient and high-quality training data, such that the learned representations can well capture accurate user preference. User behavior data in many practical recommendation scenarios is often noisy and exhibits skewed distribution, which may result in suboptimal representation performance in GNN-based models. In this paper, we propose SHT, a novel Self-Supervised Hypergraph Transformer framework (SHT) which augments user representations by exploring the global collaborative relationships in an explicit way. Specifically, we first empower the graph neural CF paradigm to maintain global collaborative effects among users and items with a hypergraph transformer network. With the distilled global context, a cross-view generative self-supervised learning component is proposed for data augmentation over the user-item interaction graph, so as to enhance the robustness of recommender systems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SHT can significantly improve the performance over various state-of-the-art baselines.

Existing methods can achieve inspiring results in predicting personal frequent routes conditioned on massive historical data. However, trajectory estimation may involve cold-start routes or users due to the data sparsity problem, which severely limits the performance of spatial trajectory prediction. Although meta-learning models can alleviate the cold-start problem, they simply utilize the same initialization for all tasks and thus cannot fit each user well due to users' varying travel preferences. To this end, we propose an adaptive meta-optimized model called MetaPTP for personalized spatial trajectory prediction. Specifically, it adopts a soft-clustering based method to guide the network initialization in a finer granularity, so that shared knowledge can be better transferred across users with similar travel preferences. Besides, towards model fine-tuning, an effective trajectory sampling method is introduced to generate meaningful support set, which simultaneously considers user preference and spatial trace similarities to provide task-related information for model adaptation. In addition, we design a weight generator to adaptively assign reasonable weights to trajectories in support set to avoid sub-optimal results which will occur when fine-tuning the initial network with the same weight for trajectories with different user preferences and spatial distributions. Finally, extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model.|轨迹预测是各类基于位置应用的基础性问题。现有方法在利用海量历史数据预测个人高频路线方面已能取得优异效果。但由于数据稀疏性问题，轨迹估算可能涉及冷启动路线或用户，这严重限制了空间轨迹预测的性能。尽管元学习模型能够缓解冷启动问题，但它们对所有任务采用相同的初始化方式，由于用户出行偏好存在差异，无法很好地适配每个用户。为此，我们提出了一种自适应元优化模型MetaPTP，用于个性化空间轨迹预测。该模型采用基于软聚类的方法，以更细粒度指导网络初始化，使得具有相似出行偏好的用户之间能更好地实现知识迁移。在模型微调方面，我们引入有效的轨迹采样方法生成高质量支持集，该方法同时考虑用户偏好和空间轨迹相似性，为模型适配提供任务相关信息。此外，我们设计了权重生成器，自适应地为支持集中的轨迹分配合适权重，避免在对初始网络进行微调时，因对不同用户偏好和空间分布的轨迹采用相同权重而导致的次优结果。最终，在两个真实数据集上的大量实验证明了我们模型的优越性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=MetaPTP:+An+Adaptive+Meta-optimized+Model+for+Personalized+Spatial+Trajectory+Prediction)|0|

Vuduc|Georgia Inst Technol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; Amazon, Seattle, WA USA|This paper describes a new method for representing embedding tables of graph neural networks (GNNs) more compactly via tensor-train (TT) decomposition. We consider the scenario where (a) the graph data that lack node features, thereby requiring the learning of embeddings during training; and (b) we wish to exploit GPU platforms, where smaller tables are needed to reduce host-to-GPU communication even for large-memory GPUs. The use of TT enables a compact parameterization of the embedding, rendering it small enough to fit entirely on modern GPUs even for massive graphs. When combined with judicious schemes for initialization and hierarchical graph partitioning, this approach can reduce the size of node embedding vectors by 1,659 times to 81,362 times on large publicly available benchmark datasets, achieving comparable or better accuracy and significant speedups on multi-GPU systems. In some cases, our model without explicit node features on input can even match the accuracy of models that use node features.|本文介绍了一种通过张量链(TT)分解实现图神经网络嵌入表紧凑表示的新方法。该方法主要针对两种场景：(a) 图数据缺乏节点特征，需要在训练过程中学习嵌入表示；(b)需要在GPU平台上运行，即使是大内存GPU也需要通过减小表规模来降低主机到GPU的通信开销。TT分解技术能够实现嵌入参数的紧凑化表征，使其即使处理超大规模图数据时也能完全适配现代GPU的显存容量。当结合智能初始化策略和分层图划分方案时，该方法在大型公开基准数据集上可将节点嵌入向量的尺寸缩小1,659至81,362倍，在保持相当或更优精度的同时，显著提升多GPU系统的训练速度。在某些情况下，我们未使用显式节点特征的模型甚至可以达到使用节点特征模型的精度水平。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Nimble+GNN+Embedding+with+Tensor-Train+Decomposition)|0|

Though extensive studies on recommendation systems are devoted to providing the most well-matched videos for each view request, fitting the data without considering inherent biases such as selection bias and exposure bias will result in serious issues. In this paper, we formalize the exposure proportion strategy as a policy-making problem with multi-dimensional continuous treatment under certain constraints from a causal inference point of view. We propose a novel ensemble policy learning method based on causal trees, called Maximum Difference of Preference Point Forest (MDP2 Forest), which overcomes the shortcomings of existing policy learning approaches. Experimental results on both simulated and synthetic datasets show the superiority of our algorithm compared to other policy learning or causal inference methods in terms of the treatment estimation accuracy and the mean regret.

In this work, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning agent to perform floorplanning, one of the early stages of VLSI physical design. Traditional methods to solve floorplanning problem are intractable for large circuit netlists and impossible to learn from past experience. We adopt the domain knowledge of floorplanning representation and propose a learning-based method that directly predicts block id and location through an RL framework. The resulting solutions are platform-independent and can be converted into layout within $O(n)$ time. We encode the hypernet information in the circuit netlist in a one-to-one mapping through hypergraph neural networks. Furthermore, We deploy transformer-like action selection to allow for transferability and generalization across netlist circuits with different sizes and handle the large discrete action space. This allows the parameter space of our model to remain the same regardless of the number of blocks. Our RL agent is able to transfer previously learnt knowledge to quickly optimize a new design with different size and purpose. To our knowledge, this is the first work to select both id and block position with an entirely end-to-end learning-based framework that can generalize.

This paper describes the challenges and solutions we developed to apply Affective Computing to social media recommendation systems. We address several types of challenges. First, we devise a taxonomy of affects that was small (for practical purposes) yet covers the important nuances needed for the application. Second, to collect training data for our models, we balance between signals that are already available to us (namely, different types of user engagement) and data we collected through a carefully crafted human annotation effort on 800k posts.

Active learning (AL) and semi-supervised learning (SSL) are two effective, but often isolated, means to alleviate the data-hungry problem. Some recent studies explored the potential of combining AL and SSL to better probe the unlabeled data. However, almost all these contemporary SSL-AL works use a simple combination strategy, ignoring SSL and AL's inherent relation. Further, other methods suffer from high computational costs when dealing with large-scale, high-dimensional datasets. Motivated by the industry practice of labeling data, we propose an innovative Inconsistency-based virtual aDvErsarial Active Learning (IDEAL) algorithm to further investigate SSL-AL's potential superiority and achieve mutual enhancement of AL and SSL, i.e., SSL propagates label information to unlabeled samples and provides smoothed embeddings for AL, while AL excludes samples with inconsistent predictions and considerable uncertainty for SSL. We estimate unlabeled samples' inconsistency by augmentation strategies of different granularities, including fine-grained continuous perturbation exploration and coarse-grained data transformations. Extensive experiments, in both text and image domains, validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, comparing it against state-of-the-art baselines.

The goal of Rax is to facilitate easy prototyping of LTR systems by leveraging the flexibility and simplicity of JAX. Rax provides a diverse set of popular ranking metrics and losses that integrate well with the rest of the JAX ecosystem. Furthermore, Rax implements a system of ranking-specific function transformations which allows fine-grained customization of ranking losses and metrics. Most notably Rax provides approx_t12n: a function transformation (t12n) that can transform any of our ranking metrics into an approximate and differentiable form that can be optimized. This provides a systematic way to directly optimize neural ranking models for ranking metrics that are not easily optimizable in other libraries. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of Rax by benchmarking neural models implemented using Flax and trained using Rax on two popular LTR benchmarks: WEB30K and Istella. Furthermore, we show that integrating ranking losses with T5, a large language model, can improve overall ranking performance on the MS MARCO passage ranking task.

To account for system efficiency, simple vector-product based models are commonly deployed in the pre-ranking stage. Recent works consider distilling the high knowledge of large ranking models to small pre-ranking models for better effectiveness. However, two major challenges in pre-ranking system still exist: (i) without explicitly modeling the performance gain versus computation cost, the predefined latency constraint in the pre-ranking stage inevitably leads to suboptimal solutions; (ii) transferring the ranking teacher's knowledge to a pre-ranking student with a predetermined handcrafted architecture still suffers from the loss of model performance. In this work, a novel framework AutoFAS is proposed which jointly optimizes the efficiency and effectiveness of the pre-ranking model: (i) AutoFAS for the first time simultaneously selects the most valuable features and network architectures using Neural Architecture Search (NAS) technique; (ii) equipped with ranking model guided reward during NAS procedure, AutoFAS can select the best pre-ranking architecture for a given ranking teacher without any computation overhead.

Special care is given to uncertainty estimation and validation. Uncertainty is used to assess the quality of a segmentation to avoid misdiagnosis or returning in the field to recapture images. It is also proposed as a tool to evaluate whether unannotated images should be included in the dataset. System performance has been evaluated on a test dataset as well as in the field by regular inspection teams. Promising results obtained so far led to the deployment of the vision system on a fleet of five inspection trucks performing inspection over the province over the last year Authorization was granted to scale the solution to 35 trucks starting this year.|本文介绍了一种热成像视觉系统，用于检测魁北克水电公司地下配电网络中常见各类电缆接头上的热点类型。地下配电网络的电缆接头长期在恶劣环境下运行，随时间推移可能发生故障。通过及时检测这些接头上的局部热点可有效预防故障发生。该系统采用深度神经网络进行图像分割以实现热点检测，特别注重不确定性估计与验证环节——通过不确定性评估来判定分割结果的质量，避免误诊或需要重新现场采集图像的情况，同时也将其作为评估未标注图像是否应纳入数据集的工具。该系统性能已通过测试数据集及常规巡检团队的实地检测得到验证。目前取得的积极成果促使该视觉系统于去年在省内执行巡检的五辆检测车上完成部署，并已获准从今年起将应用规模扩展至35辆检测车。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Towards+Reliable+Detection+of+Dielectric+Hotspots+in+Thermal+Images+of+the+Underground+Distribution+Network)|0|
|[CERAM: Coverage Expansion for Recommendations by Associating Discarded Models](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539207)|Yoshiki Matsune, Kota Tsubouchi, Nobuhiko Nishio|Ritsumeikan Univ, Shiga, Japan; Yahoo Japan Corp, Tokyo, Japan|Systems that utilize and manage predictive models have become increasingly significant in industry. In the services offered by Yahoo! JAPAN, once a predictive model is utilized for recommendations, it is thrown away. Such models could however be reused for expanding the coverage of other recommendations. Here, our goal is to construct recommendation systems that expand the coverage of recommendations by effectively utilizing models which would otherwise be discarded. Another goal is to deploy such a recommendation system on real services and make practical use of it. In this paper, we describe a recommendation system that achieves these two goals by overcoming the challenges facing its deployment on real services. Specifically, we developed an optimization method that alleviates the psychological barrier against using the recommendation system and clarified the performance of our method in making real recommendations. An offline test and a large-scale online test on making real recommendations showed that our method substantially expands the coverage of recommendations. As a highlight of the results, our method made recommendations to 76.9 times more users at the same level of recommendation performance as the currently used recommendation system by the service. Overall, the results show that our method has a huge impact on services and can be applied to real recommendations.|利用和管理预测模型的系统在工业领域已变得日益重要。在Yahoo!

|[Intelligent Request Strategy Design in Recommender System](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539123)|Xufeng Qian, Yue Xu, Fuyu Lv, Shengyu Zhang, Ziwen Jiang, Qingwen Liu, Xiaoyi Zeng, TatSeng Chua, Fei Wu|Alibaba Grp, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; Zhejiang Univ, Shanghai Inst Adv Study, Shanghai AI Lab, Shanghai, Peoples R China; Zhejiang Univ, Inst Artificial Intelligence, Hangzhou, Peoples R China|Waterfall Recommender System (RS), a popular form of RS in mobile applications, is a stream of recommended items consisting of successive pages that can be browsed by scrolling. In waterfall RS, when a user finishes browsing a page, the edge (e.g., mobile phones) would send a request to the cloud server to get a new page of recommendations, known as the paging request mechanism. RSs typically put a large number of items into one page to reduce excessive resource consumption from numerous paging requests, which, however, would diminish the RSs' ability to timely renew the recommendations according to users' real-time interest and lead to a poor user experience. Intuitively, inserting additional requests inside pages to update the recommendations with a higher frequency can alleviate the problem. However, previous attempts, including only non-adaptive strategies (e.g., insert requests uniformly), would eventually lead to resource overconsumption. To this end, we envision a new learning task of edge intelligence named Intelligent Request Strategy Design (IRSD). It aims to improve the effectiveness of waterfall RSs by determining the appropriate occasions of request insertion based on users' real-time intention. Moreover, we propose a new paradigm of adaptive request insertion strategy named Uplift-based On-edge Smart Request Framework (AdaRequest). AdaRequest 1) captures the dynamic change of users' intentions by matching their real-time behaviors with their historical interests based on attention-based neural networks. 2) estimates the counterfactual uplift of user purchase brought by an inserted request based on causal inference. 3) determines the final request insertion strategy by maximizing the utility function under online resource constraints. We conduct extensive experiments on both offline dataset and online A/B test to verify the effectiveness of AdaRequest. Remarkably, AdaRequest has been deployed on the Waterfall RS of Taobao and brought over 3% lift on Gross Merchandise Value (GMV).|瀑布流推荐系统（RS）是移动应用中常见的推荐形式，通过连续分页呈现推荐内容流供用户滚动浏览。在该系统中，用户浏览完当前页面后，终端设备（如手机）会向云端服务器发送请求获取新推荐页，这种机制称为分页请求。为减少频繁分页导致的资源消耗，系统通常会在单页内加载大量内容，但这会降低根据用户实时兴趣动态更新推荐的能力，最终影响用户体验。直观的解决方案是在页面浏览过程中插入额外请求以提高更新频率，但现有非自适应策略（如均匀插入请求）会导致资源过度消耗。为此，我们提出名为智能请求策略设计（IRSD）的边缘智能学习任务，其核心是基于用户实时意图动态判定请求插入时机以提升推荐效果。我们进一步提出自适应请求插入框架AdaRequest，其具备三大特性：1）通过基于注意力神经网络的实时行为与历史兴趣匹配机制感知用户意图动态变化；2）基于因果推理估计插入请求带来的用户购买转化提升效应；3）在在线资源约束下通过效用函数最大化确定最终请求插入策略。通过离线和在线A/B测试的广泛实验验证了AdaRequest的有效性，该框架已在淘宝瀑布流推荐系统完成部署，推动平台总交易额（GMV）提升超3%。  （注：译文严格遵循技术文档的专业表述规范，采用"瀑布流推荐系统""分页请求机制""因果推理"等符合中文计算机领域术语习惯的译法，保留"AdaRequest""GMV"等专有名词原称，通过拆分英文长句为中文短句结构（如将三个特性说明重构为分号连接句式），确保技术逻辑的准确传递与专业阅读体验的流畅性。）|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Intelligent+Request+Strategy+Design+in+Recommender+System)|0|

As state-of-the-art models grow in size in the order of trillions of parameters, their computational complexity and cost also increase rapidly. Since 2012, the cost of deep learning doubled roughly every quarter, and this trend is likely to continue. ML practitioners have to cope with common challenges of efficient resource utilization when training such large models. In this paper, we propose a new profiling tool that cross-correlates relevant system utilization metrics and framework operations. The tool supports profiling DL models at scale, identifies performance bottlenecks, and provides insights with recommendations. We deployed the profiling functionality as an add-on to Amazon SageMaker Debugger, a fully-managed service that leverages an on-the-fly analysis system (called rules) to automatically identify complex issues in DL training jobs. By presenting deployment results and customer case studies, we show that it enables users to identify and fix issues caused by inefficient hardware resource usage, thereby reducing training time and cost.|随着深度学习(DL)的兴起，机器学习(ML)已演变为计算与数据密集型领域，通常需要多节点多GPU集群的支持。由于最先进模型的参数量已增至万亿级别，其计算复杂度和成本也快速攀升。自2012年以来，深度学习成本每季度约翻一番，且这一趋势仍将持续。机器学习从业者在训练此类大模型时，必须应对高效资源利用的共同挑战。本文提出一种新型分析工具，可对系统利用率指标与框架操作进行跨维度关联分析。该工具支持大规模深度学习模型分析，能识别性能瓶颈并提供优化建议。我们将此分析功能作为亚马逊SageMaker Debugger的扩展组件进行部署——该全托管服务通过实时分析系统（称为rules规则）自动识别深度学习训练任务中的复杂问题。通过展示部署结果和客户案例，我们证明该工具可帮助用户识别并修复因硬件资源使用效率低下导致的问题，从而有效缩短训练时间并降低成本。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Profiling+Deep+Learning+Workloads+at+Scale+using+Amazon+SageMaker)|0|
|[Generative Adversarial Networks Enhanced Pre-training for Insufficient Electronic Health Records Modeling](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539020)|Houxing Ren, Jingyuan Wang, Wayne Xin Zhao|Beihang Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China; Renmin Univ China, Gaoling Sch Artificial Intelligence, Beijing, Peoples R China|In recent years, automatic computational systems based on deep learning are widely used in medical fields, such as automatic diagnosing and disease prediction. Most of these systems are designed for data sufficient scenarios. However, due to the disease rarity or privacy, the medical data are always insufficient. When applying these data-hungry deep learning models with insufficient data, it is likely to lead to issues of over-fitting and cause serious performance problems. Many data augmentation methods have been proposed to solve the data insufficiency problem, such as using GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) to generate training data. However, the augmented data usually contains lots of noise. Directly using them to train sensitive medical models is very difficult to achieve satisfactory results. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel deep model learning method for insufficient EHR (Electronic Health Record) data modeling, namely GRACE, which stands GeneRative Adversarial networks enhanCed prE-training. In the method, we propose an item-relation-aware GAN to capture changing trends and correlations among data for generating high-quality EHR records. Furthermore, we design a pre-training mechanism consisting of a masked records prediction task and a real-fake contrastive learning task to learn representations for EHR data using both generated and real data. After the pre-training, only the representations of real data is used to train the final prediction model. In this way, we can fully exploit useful information in generated data through pre-training, and also avoid the problems caused by directly using noisy generated data to train the final prediction model. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated using extensive experiments on three healthcare-related real-world datasets. We also deploy our method in a maternal and child health care hospital for the online test. Both offline and online experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. We believe doctors and patients can benefit from our effective learning method in various healthcare-related applications.|近年来，基于深度学习的自动化计算系统在医疗领域得到广泛应用，例如自动诊断和疾病预测等场景。这类系统大多面向数据充足的情境设计，但由于疾病罕见性或隐私限制，医疗数据往往存在不足问题。当数据饥渴型深度学习模型遭遇数据不足时，极易导致过拟合现象并引发严重性能问题。虽然已有研究提出通过生成对抗网络（GAN）等数据增强方法缓解数据不足，但生成数据通常包含大量噪声，直接将其用于训练高敏感度的医疗模型难以取得理想效果。为解决这一难题，我们提出面向电子健康记录（EHR）数据建模的新型深度学习方法GRACE（GeneRative Adversarial networks enhanCed prE-training）。该方法创新性地设计具有项目关系感知能力的GAN，通过捕捉数据间的变化趋势与关联性来生成高质量EHR记录；进而构建包含掩码记录预测任务和真假对比学习任务的预训练机制，同步利用生成数据与真实数据进行表征学习。预训练完成后，仅采用真实数据的表征来训练最终预测模型。这种方式既通过预训练充分挖掘生成数据中的有效信息，又规避了直接使用含噪生成数据训练最终模型可能产生的问题。通过在三个真实世界医疗数据集上的大量实验验证，本方法的有效性得到充分证明。我们还将该方法部署于某妇幼保健院进行线上测试，离线与在线实验结果均表明所提方法具有显著优势。我们相信该高效学习方法能在各类医疗健康应用中为医生和患者创造价值。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Generative+Adversarial+Networks+Enhanced+Pre-training+for+Insufficient+Electronic+Health+Records+Modeling)|0|

They did not consider the unique features of indoor shopping in real stores such as the physical environments and objects, which significantly affect the movement and purchase behaviors of customers, thereby representing the "spatiotemporal contexts" that are critical to identifying recommendable items.

Despite various scenario brings personalized service, it also leads to challenges for the recommendation on multiple scenarios, especially the scenarios with limited traffic. To give desirable recommendation service for all scenarios and reduce the cost of resource consumption, how to leverage the information from multiple scenarios to construct a unified model becomes critical. Unfortunately, the performance of existing multi-scenario recommendation approaches is poor since they introduce unnecessary information from other scenarios to target scenario. In this paper, we show it is possible to selectively utilize the information from different scenarios to construct the scenario-aware estimators in a unified model. Specifically, we first do analysis on multi-scenario modeling with causal graph from the perspective of users and modeling processes, and then propose the Causal Inspired Intervention (CausalInt) framework for multi-scenario recommendation. CausalInt consists of three modules: (1) Invariant Representation Modeling module to squeeze out the scenario-aware information through disentangled representation learning and obtain a scenario-invariant representation; (2) Negative Effects Mitigating module to resolve conflicts between different scenarios and conflicts between scenario-specific and scenario-invariant representations via gradient based orthogonal regularization and model-agnostic meta learning, respectively; (3) Inter-Scenario Transferring module designs a novel TransNet to simulate a counterfactual intervention and effectively fuse the information from other scenarios.

|[Scale Calibration of Deep Ranking Models](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539072)|Le Yan, Zhen Qin, Xuanhui Wang, Michael Bendersky, Marc Najork|Google, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA|Learning-to-Rank (LTR) systems are ubiquitous in web applications nowadays. The existing literature mainly focuses on improving ranking performance by trying to generate the optimal order of candidate items. However, virtually all advanced ranking functions are not scale calibrated. For example, rankers have the freedom to add a constant to all item scores without changing their relative order. This property has resulted in several limitations in deploying advanced ranking methods in practice. On the one hand, it limits the use of effective ranking functions in important applications. For example, in ads ranking, predicted Click-Through Rate (pCTR) is used for ranking and is required to be calibrated for the downstream ads auction. This is a major reason that existing ads ranking methods use scale calibrated pointwise loss functions that may sacrifice ranking performance. On the other hand, popular ranking losses are translation-invariant. We rigorously show that, both theoretically and empirically, this property leads to training instability that may cause severe practical issues. In this paper, we study how to perform scale calibration of deep ranking models to address the above concerns. We design three different formulations to calibrate ranking models through calibrated ranking losses. Unlike existing post-processing methods, our calibration is performed during training, which can resolve the training instability issue without any additional processing. We conduct experiments on the standard LTR benchmark datasets and one of the largest sponsored search ads dataset from Google. Our results show that our proposed calibrated ranking losses can achieve nearly optimal results in terms of both ranking quality and score scale calibration.|学习排序（LTR）系统在当今网络应用中无处不在。现有研究主要集中于通过生成候选项目的最优顺序来提升排序性能，但几乎所有先进排序函数都缺乏尺度校准能力。例如，排序模型可以随意为所有项目分数添加常数而不改变其相对顺序。这一特性导致先进排序方法在实际部署中存在诸多局限：一方面，它限制了有效排序函数在重要场景中的应用。以广告排序为例，预测点击率（pCTR）不仅需要用于排序，还需为下游广告拍卖提供校准数值，这导致现有广告排序方法不得不采用可能牺牲排序性能的尺度校准逐点损失函数。另一方面，主流排序损失函数具有平移不变性。我们通过理论分析和实证研究证明，这一特性会导致训练不稳定，进而引发严重实践问题。本文研究如何对深度排序模型进行尺度校准以解决上述问题。我们设计三种不同方案，通过校准排序损失来实现模型校准。与现有后处理方法不同，我们的校准在训练过程中同步完成，无需额外处理即可解决训练不稳定问题。我们在标准LTR基准数据集和谷歌大型赞助搜索广告数据集上的实验表明，所提出的校准排序损失函数能在排序质量和分数尺度校准方面同时达到近乎最优的结果。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Scale+Calibration+of+Deep+Ranking+Models)|0|

Being able to predict rating changes will greatly benefit both investors and regulators alike. In this paper, we consider the corporate credit rating migration early prediction problem, which predicts the credit rating of an issuer will be upgraded, unchanged, or downgraded after 12 months based on its latest financial reporting information at the time.

The goal of a recommender system is to generate relevant recommendations for users from a collection of items or services that might interest them. Building a recommendation system is challenging because it requires multiple stages (item retrieval, filtering, ranking, ordering) to work together seamlessly and efficiently during training and inference. The biggest challenges faced by new practitioners are the lack of understanding around what RecSys look like in the real world and the difficulty in transitioning from the simple Matrix Factorization (MF) to more complex deep learning architectures with multiple input features, neural components and prediction heads. To address these challenges on building recommender systems, NVIDIA developed an open source framework, called Merlin. Merlin consists of a set of libraries and tools to help RecSys practitioners build models and pipelines easily and more efficiently. Merlin Models provides modularized building blocks that can be easily connected to build classic and state-of-the-art models. It offers flexibility at each stage: multiple input processing/representation modules, different layers for designing the model's architecture, prediction heads, loss functions, negative sampling techniques, among others. In this hands-on tutorial, participants will start with data preparation using NVTabular an open-source feature engineering and preprocessing library designed to quickly and easily manipulate large scale datasets. Participants will then work on modeling with Merlin Models library, building the fundamental recommendation models such as MF and then transitioning to more complex deep learning-based models for candidate retrieval. In each iteration, we will demonstrate the seamless integration between data preparation and model training. Over the span of this tutorial, participants will learn the fundamentals of recommender systems modeling and how to build a two-stage recommender system easily using open source Merlin libraries.|推荐系统（RecSys）是现代互联网的引擎，也是人类决策的催化剂。其核心目标是从可能吸引用户的物品或服务集合中生成相关推荐。构建推荐系统具有挑战性，因其需要多个阶段（物品召回、过滤、排序、序列调整）在训练与推理过程中无缝高效协同运作。新手从业者面临的最大挑战在于：一方面不了解真实场景中推荐系统的实际形态，另一方面难以从简单的矩阵分解（MF）模型过渡到具有多输入特征、神经组件和预测头的复杂深度学习架构。  为应对这些挑战，英伟达开发了名为Merlin的开源框架。该框架包含一系列库和工具，可帮助推荐系统从业者更轻松高效地构建模型与流水线。Merlin Models提供模块化构建单元，通过简单连接即可搭建经典模型与最先进模型。其在每个阶段均具备灵活性：支持多输入处理/表征模块、多种模型架构设计层、可定制预测头、损失函数及负采样技术等。  在本实践教程中，学员将首先使用NVTabular进行数据准备——这是一个专为快速处理大规模数据集而设计的开源特征工程与预处理库。随后学员将通过Merlin Models库构建基础推荐模型（如矩阵分解），并逐步过渡到基于深度学习的复杂候选召回模型。每个环节都将展示数据准备与模型训练间的无缝集成。通过本教程，学员将掌握推荐系统建模的基础知识，并学会使用开源Merlin库快速构建两阶段推荐系统。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Reducing+the+Friction+for+Building+Recommender+Systems+with+Merlin)|0|

The community has recently begun to notice the potential dangers of overusing less-understood mechanisms and over-simplified assumptions to learn patterns and make decisions. In particular, there is growing concerns on the interpretation, reliability, social impact, and long-term utility of real-world IR systems. Therefore, it has become a pressing issue to bring the IR community comprehensive and systematic tools to understand empirical domain solutions and motivate principled design ideas. We focus on the three pillar stones of modern IR systems: pattern recognition with deep learning, causal inference analysis, and online decision making (with bandits and reinforcement learning). Our objectives are as follows. For pattern recognition, we introduce theoretical tools that address the expressivity, optimization, generalization, and model diagnostic for widespread domain practices, including models from unsupervised, (semi-)supervised, meta-learning, and online learning. For causal inference analysis, we emphasize both learning from observational studies and optimizing online experiment design, leveraging the recent theoretical advancements from various domains. Finally, for online decision making (with bandits and reinforcement learning), we aim to resolve both the conceptual and practical learning, evaluation and deployment challenges by introducing powerful tools from robust optimization and optimal control. Our tutorial is inclusive: we not only cover a broad range of heating topics, more importantly, we substantiate our discussion with the production examples at Walmart and Instacart such that audiences with different backgrounds can learn to leverage the tools as instructed. Our tutorial can serve as a guideline for practitioners seeking justifications and principled design ideas, a playbook for researchers landing their innovations on IR productions, and an introductory course for those interested in learning the advanced topics and tools of IR.|过去十年间，深度学习显著重塑了信息检索（IR）领域的发展图景。学界近期开始注意到过度使用尚未被充分理解的机制和过度简化的假设来学习模式并做出决策的潜在风险。尤其值得关注的是，现实世界信息检索系统在可解释性、可靠性、社会影响及长期效用方面正引发日益增长的担忧。因此，为信息检索领域提供全面系统的工具以理解实证领域解决方案并激发基于原理的设计理念，已成为紧迫议题。我们聚焦现代信息检索系统的三大基石：基于深度学习的模式识别、因果推理分析以及在线决策（通过多臂老虎机和强化学习实现）。我们的目标如下：在模式识别方面，引入理论工具以解决广泛领域实践中的表达能力、优化、泛化及模型诊断问题，涵盖无监督、（半）监督、元学习及在线学习等模型；在因果推理分析方面，结合多领域最新理论进展，重点探讨从观察性研究中学习以及优化在线实验设计；最后针对在线决策（通过多臂老虎机和强化学习），通过引入鲁棒优化和最优控制的强大工具，旨在解决概念层面和实践层面的学习、评估与部署挑战。本教程具有广泛包容性：不仅涵盖众多热点议题，更重要的是通过沃尔玛和Instacart的生产案例实证分析，使不同背景的受众能按指导有效运用这些工具。本教程既可作为寻求理论依据与原理化设计思路的实践者指南，也可作为研究人员将其创新落地于信息检索产品的操作手册，同时还能为有意深入了解信息检索前沿议题与工具的学习者提供入门课程。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Modern+Theoretical+Tools+for+Designing+Information+Retrieval+System)|0|

They provide recommendation services in various areas, including shopping, eating, travelling and entertainment. RSs have achieved a great success and benefted the society. However, most of the research on RS has focused on the improvement of the recommendation accuracy, while ignoring other important qualities, such as trustworthiness (robustness, fairness, explainability, privacy and security) and social impact (influence on users' recognition and behaviours) of the recommendations. These are important aspects and cannot be overlooked since they measure properties that determine whether the recommendation service is reliable, trustworthy and benefcial to individual users and society. In this work, responsible recommendations refer to trustworthy recommendation techniques and positive-social-impact recommendation results. This workshop aims to engage with active researchers from the RS community, and other communities, as social science, to discuss state-of-the-art research results related to the core challenges of responsible recommendation services. We will focus on two main topics of responsible RSs: (1) developing reliable and trustworthy RS models and algorithms, to provide reliable recommendation results when facing a complex, uncertain and dynamic scenario; (2) assessing the social influence of RSs on human's recognition and behaviours and ensuring the influence is positive to the society.|随着数据科学与人工智能技术的进步，推荐系统日益呈现出更强大的功能与更高的精准度。这类系统已在购物、餐饮、旅行、娱乐等多个领域提供推荐服务，取得了显著成功并产生了积极的社会效益。然而现有研究大多聚焦于提升推荐准确度，却忽视了其他重要特性——包括推荐结果的可信度（涵盖鲁棒性、公平性、可解释性、隐私保护与安全性）以及社会影响（对用户认知与行为模式的塑造作用）。这些维度至关重要，因其直接决定了推荐服务是否具备可靠性、可信度以及对用户与社会产生正向价值。本研究将"负责任推荐"定义为兼具技术可信度与社会正向影响力的推荐范式。本次研讨会旨在汇聚推荐系统领域及其他相关学科（如社会科学）的活跃研究者，共同探讨负责任推荐服务的核心挑战与前沿研究成果。我们将重点关注两大主题：（1）开发可靠且可信的推荐模型与算法，使其在复杂、不确定和动态场景中仍能提供稳健的推荐结果；（2）评估推荐系统对人类认知与行为的社会影响，并确保这种影响对社会产生积极推动作用。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Data+Science+and+Artificial+Intelligence+for+Responsible+Recommendations)|0|
|[User Behavior Pre-training for Online Fraud Detection](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539126)|Can Liu, Yuncong Gao, Li Sun, Jinghua Feng, Hao Yang, Xiang Ao|Alibaba Grp, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Comp Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China|The outbreak of COVID-19 burgeons newborn services on online platforms and simultaneously buoys multifarious online fraud activities. Due to the rapid technological and commercial innovation that opens up an ever-expanding set of products, the insufficient labeling data renders existing supervised or semi-supervised fraud detection models ineffective in these emerging services. However, the ever accumulated user behavioral data on online platforms might be helpful in improving the performance of fraud detection on newborn services. To this end, in this paper, we propose to pre-train user behavior sequences, which consist of orderly arranged actions, from the large-scale unlabeled data sources for online fraud detection. Recent studies illustrate accurate extraction of user intentions~(formed by consecutive actions) in behavioral sequences can propel improvements in the performance of online fraud detection. By anatomizing the characteristic of online fraud activities, we devise a model named UB-PTM that learns knowledge of fraud activities by three agent tasks at different granularities, i.e., action, intention, and sequence levels, from large-scale unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on three downstream transaction and user-level online fraud detection tasks demonstrate that our UB-PTM is able to outperform the state-of-the-art designing for specific tasks.|新冠疫情催生了大量新兴在线服务,同时也滋生了多样化的网络欺诈活动。由于技术和商业创新快速发展带来产品种类不断扩展,标注数据的匮乏使得现有监督或半监督欺诈检测模型在这些新兴服务中效果有限。然而,在线平台上持续积累的用户行为数据可能有助于提升新兴服务的欺诈检测性能。为此,本文提出从大规模无标注数据源中预训练用户行为序列(由有序排列的操作组成)以进行在线欺诈检测。近期研究表明,准确提取行为序列中用户意图(由连续操作形成)能够有效提升在线欺诈检测性能。通过剖析网络欺诈活动特征,我们设计了UB-PTM模型,该模型通过动作、意图和序列三个不同粒度的代理任务,从大规模无标注数据中学习欺诈活动知识。在三个下游交易级和用户级在线欺诈检测任务上的大量实验表明,我们的UB-PTM模型能够超越针对特定任务设计的最先进方案。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=User+Behavior+Pre-training+for+Online+Fraud+Detection)|0|
|[Sampling-based Estimation of the Number of Distinct Values in Distributed Environment](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539390)|Jiajun Li, Zhewei Wei, Bolin Ding, Xiening Dai, Lu Lu, Jingren Zhou|Alibaba Grp, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; Renmin Univ China, Beijing, Peoples R China|In data mining, estimating the number of distinct values (NDV) is a fundamental problem with various applications. Existing methods for estimating NDV can be broadly classified into two categories: i) scanning-based methods, which scan the entire data and maintain a sketch to approximate NDV; and ii) sampling-based methods, which estimate NDV using sampling data rather than accessing the entire data warehouse. Scanning-based methods achieve a lower approximation error at the cost of higher I/O and more time. Sampling-based estimation is preferable in applications with a large data volume and a permissible error restriction due to its higher scalability. However, while the sampling-based method is more effective on a single machine, it is less practical in a distributed environment with massive data volumes. For obtaining the final NDV estimators, the entire sample must be transferred throughout the distributed system, incurring a prohibitive communication cost when the sample rate is significant. This paper proposes a novel sketch-based distributed method that achieves sub-linear communication costs for distributed sampling-based NDV estimation under mild assumptions. Our method leverages a sketch-based algorithm to estimate the sample's frequency of frequency in the distributed streaming model, which is compatible with most classical sampling-based NDV estimators. Additionally, we provide theoretical evidence for our method's ability to minimize communication costs in the worst-case scenario. Extensive experiments show that our method saves orders of magnitude in communication costs compared to existing sampling- and sketch-based methods.|在数据挖掘领域，基数估计（NDV）是一个具有多种应用价值的基础性问题。现有NDV估计方法可分为两大类：一是基于扫描的方法，通过全量扫描数据并维护草图结构来近似估算基数；二是基于采样的方法，利用样本数据而非访问整个数据仓库进行估计。基于扫描的方法虽能实现较低近似误差，但需付出更高的I/O开销和时间成本。基于采样的方法因其更优的可扩展性，更适合数据量庞大且允许一定误差的应用场景。然而，尽管基于采样的方法在单机环境下表现优异，但在海量数据分布式环境中实用性有限——为获得最终基数估计值，需将完整样本在分布式系统中传输，当采样率较高时会产生难以承受的通信开销。本文提出一种基于草图的创新分布式方法，在温和假设条件下实现分布式采样基数估计的次线性通信成本。该方法通过基于草图的算法在分布式流模型下估计样本的频数之频数，可与多数经典采样基数估计器兼容。此外，我们通过理论证明该方法在最坏情况下仍能最小化通信成本。大量实验表明，相较现有基于采样和草图的方法，本方法可节省数量级的通信开销。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Sampling-based+Estimation+of+the+Number+of+Distinct+Values+in+Distributed+Environment)|0|

Given a finite sample, an empirical average is used as a standard estimation of the target kernel mean. Prior works have shown that better estimators can be constructed by shrinkage methods. In this work, we propose to corrupt data examples with noise from known distributions and present a new kernel mean estimator, called the marginalized kernel mean estimator, which estimates kernel mean under the corrupted distributions. Theoretically, we justify that the marginalized kernel mean estimator introduces implicit regularization in kernel mean estimation. Empirically, on a variety of tasks, we show that the marginalized kernel mean estimator is sample-efficient and obtains much lower estimation errors than the existing estimators.|再生核希尔伯特空间中的核均值估计是众多基于核的学习算法的核心。给定有限样本，经验平均值通常被用作目标核均值的标准估计方法。先前研究已证明，通过收缩方法可以构建出更优的估计量。本研究提出通过已知分布噪声干扰数据样本，进而提出一种新型核均值估计器——边缘化核均值估计器，该估计器可在受干扰分布下实现核均值估计。理论上，我们证明了边缘化核均值估计器在核均值估计中引入了隐式正则化机制。在实证研究中，通过多任务测试表明，边缘化核均值估计器具有优异的样本效率，其估计误差显著低于现有估计器。  （译文说明：采用学术论文的规范表述方式，精准翻译专业术语如"reproducing kernel Hilbert space"译为"再生核希尔伯特空间"，"implicit regularization"译为"隐式正则化"。保持原文的学术严谨性，同时通过"显著低于"等符合中文论文表达的措辞增强专业性。句式结构根据中文表达习惯进行了重组，如将英文长句拆分为符合中文阅读节奏的短句。）|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Sample-Efficient+Kernel+Mean+Estimator+with+Marginalized+Corrupted+Data)|0|
|[Accurate Node Feature Estimation with Structured Variational Graph Autoencoder](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539337)|Jaemin Yoo, Hyunsik Jeon, Jinhong Jung, U Kang|Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; JBNU, Jeonju, South Korea; Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul, South Korea|Given a graph with partial observations of node features, how can we estimate the missing features accurately? Feature estimation is a crucial problem for analyzing real-world graphs whose features are commonly missing during the data collection process. Accurate estimation not only provides diverse information of nodes but also supports the inference of graph neural networks that require the full observation of node features. However, designing an effective approach for estimating high-dimensional features is challenging, since it requires an estimator to have large representation power, increasing the risk of overfitting. In this work, we propose SVGA (Structured Variational Graph Autoencoder), an accurate method for feature estimation. SVGA applies strong regularization to the distribution of latent variables by structured variational inference, which models the prior of variables as Gaussian Markov random field based on the graph structure. As a result, SVGA combines the advantages of probabilistic inference and graph neural networks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in real datasets.|给定一个节点特征存在部分观测的图，我们如何准确估计缺失特征？特征估计是分析现实世界图数据的关键问题，由于数据收集过程中常出现特征缺失现象。精确的特征估计不仅能提供丰富的节点信息，还能支持需要完整节点特征观测的图神经网络进行推理。然而，为高维特征估计设计有效方法具有挑战性，因为这要求估计器具备强大表征能力，同时会增大过拟合风险。本研究提出SVGA（结构化变分图自编码器）——一种精准的特征估计方法。该方法通过结构化变分推断对潜在变量分布实施强正则化，将变量先验建模为基于图结构的高斯马尔可夫随机场。SVGA由此融合了概率推断与图神经网络的双重优势，在真实数据集中实现了最先进的性能表现。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Accurate+Node+Feature+Estimation+with+Structured+Variational+Graph+Autoencoder)|0|

McCrae|Huawei Res, Dublin, Ireland; Amazon Alexa AI, Cambridge, England; Natl Univ Ireland Galway, Data Sci Inst, Galway, Ireland|Selecting an appropriate and relevant context forms an essential component for the efficacy of several information retrieval applications like Question Answering (QA) systems. The problem of Answer Sentence Selection (AS2) refers to the task of selecting sentences, from a larger text, that are relevant and contain the answer to users' queries. While there has been a lot of success in building AS2 systems trained on open-domain data (e.g., SQuAD, NQ), they do not generalize well in closed-domain settings, since domain adaptation can be challenging due to poor availability and annotation expense of domain-specific data. This paper proposes SEDAN, an effective self-learning framework to adapt AS2 models for domain-specific applications. We leverage large pre-trained language models to automatically generate domain-specific QA pairs for domain adaptation. We further fine-tune a pre-trained Sentence-BERT architecture to capture semantic relatedness between questions and answer sentences for AS2. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach (over existing state-of-the-art AS2 baselines) on different Question Answering benchmark datasets.|选择合适的相关语境是提升问答系统等多项信息检索应用效能的关键环节。答案句选择（AS2）任务旨在从长篇文本中筛选出与用户查询相关且包含答案的句子。尽管基于开放领域数据（如SQuAD、NQ）训练的AS2系统已取得显著成果，但由于领域特定数据获取困难且标注成本高昂，这类系统在封闭领域场景中的泛化能力仍然有限。本文提出SEDAN——一种有效的自学习框架，用于使AS2模型适配特定领域应用。我们利用大规模预训练语言模型自动生成领域特定的问答对以实现领域自适应，并进一步对预训练的Sentence-BERT架构进行微调，以捕捉问答句之间的语义相关性。大量实验证明，我们所提出的方法在不同问答基准数据集上均优于现有最先进的AS2基线模型。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Semantic+Aware+Answer+Sentence+Selection+Using+Self-Learning+Based+Domain+Adaptation)|0|
|[CONFLUX: A Request-level Fusion Framework for Impression Allocation via Cascade Distillation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539044)|XiaoYu Wang, Bin Tan, Yonghui Guo, Tao Yang, Dongbo Huang, Lan Xu, Nikolaos M. Freris, Hao Zhou, Xiangyang Li|Tencent Advertising, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; Univ Sci & Technol China, LINKE Lab, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China|Guaranteed delivery (GD) and real-time bidding (RTB) constitute two parallel profit streams for the publisher. The diverse advertiser demands (brand or instant effect) result in different selling (in bulk or via auction) and pricing (fixed unit price or various bids) patterns, which naturally raises the fusion allocation issue of breaking the two markets' barrier and selling out at the global highest price boosting the total revenue. The fusion process complicates the competition between GD and RTB, and GD contracts with overlapping targeting. The non-stationary user traffic and bid landscape further worsen the situation, making the assignment unsupervised and hard to evaluate. Thus, a static policy or coarse-grained modeling from existing work is inferior to facing the above challenges. This paper proposes CONFLUX, a fusion framework located at the confluence of the parallel GD and RTB markets. CONFLUX functions in a cascaded process: a paradigm is first forged via linear programming to supervise CONFLUX's training, then a cumbersome network distills such paradigm by precisely modeling the competition at a request level and further transfers the generalization ability to a lightweight student via knowledge distillation. Finally, fine-tuning is periodically executed at the online stage to remedy the student's degradation, and a temporal distillation loss between the current and the previous model serves as a regularizer to prevent over-fitting. The procedure is analogous to a cascade distillation and hence its name. CONFLUX has been deployed on the Tencent advertising system for over six months through extensive experiments. Online A/B tests present a lift of 3.29%, 1.77%, and 3.63% of ad income, overall click-through rate, and cost-per-mille, respectively, which jointly contribute a revenue increase by hundreds of thousands RMB per day. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/zslomo/CONFLUX.|保量投放（GD）与实时竞价（RTB）构成了发布商的两大并行收益渠道。品牌广告主与效果广告主的不同需求（品牌曝光或即时转化），导致了不同的销售模式（批量预售或实时竞价）与定价机制（固定单价或动态出价），这自然引出了打破两个市场壁垒、以全局最高价售出库存并提升总收益的融合分配问题。该融合过程使得GD与RTB的竞争关系复杂化，且存在目标受众重叠的GD合约。非稳态的用户流量与竞价环境进一步加剧了问题难度，导致分配过程缺乏监督信号且难以评估。因此，面对上述挑战时，静态策略或现有工作的粗粒度建模方法均存在明显不足。  本文提出CONFLUX框架，该框架立足于GD与RTB并行市场的交汇点。CONFLUX采用级联式架构运作：首先通过线性规划构建最优分配范式以指导模型训练；随后通过笨重教师网络对请求级竞争关系进行精确建模，并利用知识蒸馏将泛化能力迁移至轻量级学生网络；最后在在线阶段定期执行微调以修正模型退化，同时通过当前模型与历史模型间的时序蒸馏损失作为正则项防止过拟合。该流程类似于级联蒸馏过程，故得名CONFLUX。本框架已在腾讯广告系统持续部署超过六个月，大量实验表明：在线A/B测试中广告收入、整体点击率和千次展示收益分别提升3.29%、1.77%和3.63，共同实现每日数十万元人民币的收入增长。代码已开源：https://github.com/zslomo/CONFLUX。  （注：根据学术规范，技术术语采用以下译法： - Guaranteed delivery: 保量投放（GD） - Real-time bidding: 实时竞价（RTB）   - Click-through rate: 点击率 - Cost-per-mille: 千次展示收益 - Knowledge distillation: 知识蒸馏 - Linear programming: 线性规划 - Fine-tuning: 微调 - Over-fitting: 过拟合）|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=CONFLUX:+A+Request-level+Fusion+Framework+for+Impression+Allocation+via+Cascade+Distillation)|0|

Existing methods first train a model to predict the conversion probability of the advertisement journeys with historical data and calculate the attribution of each touchpoint by using the results counterfactual predictions. An assumption of these works is the conversion prediction model is unbiased. It can give accurate predictions on any randomly assigned journey, including both the factual and counterfactual ones. Nevertheless, this assumption does not always hold as the user preferences act as the common cause for both ad generation and user conversion, involving the confounding bias and leading to an out-of-distribution (OOD) problem in the counterfactual prediction. In this paper, we define the causal MTA task and propose CausalMTA to solve this problem. It systemically eliminates the confounding bias from both static and dynamic perspectives and learn an unbiased conversion prediction model using historical data. We also provide a theoretical analysis to prove the effectiveness of CausalMTA with sufficient ad journeys. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real data in Alibaba advertising platform show that CausalMTA can not only achieve better prediction performance than the state-of-the-art method but also generate meaningful attribution credits across different advertising channels.|多触点归因（MTA）旨在量化用户转化路径中每个广告触点的贡献度，对预算分配与自动化广告投放至关重要。现有方法通常先基于历史数据训练转化概率预测模型，再通过反事实预测计算各触点 attribution。这类方法隐含一个重要假设：转化预测模型需保持无偏性，即能对随机分配的广告路径（包括事实与反事实路径）进行准确预测。然而，由于用户偏好同时影响广告生成与用户转化行为，会引发混淆偏差并导致反事实预测中的分布外（OOD）问题，使得该假设在实际场景中难以成立。本文首次明确定义因果MTA任务，并提出CausalMTA解决方案：通过静态与动态双视角系统消除混淆偏差，基于历史数据学习无偏的转化预测模型。我们同时提供理论证明，论证CausalMTA在充足广告路径数据下的有效性。在阿里巴巴广告平台的合成数据与真实数据实验中，CausalMTA不仅超越了现有最优方法的预测性能，还能在不同广告渠道间生成具有业务解释性的归因分值。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=CausalMTA:+Eliminating+the+User+Confounding+Bias+for+Causal+Multi-touch+Attribution)|0|

|[FreeKD: Free-direction Knowledge Distillation for Graph Neural Networks](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539320)|Kaituo Feng, Changsheng Li, Ye Yuan, Guoren Wang|Beijing Inst Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China|Knowledge distillation (KD) has demonstrated its effectiveness to boost the performance of graph neural networks (GNNs), where its goal is to distill knowledge from a deeper teacher GNN into a shallower student GNN. However, it is actually difficult to train a satisfactory teacher GNN due to the well-known over-parametrized and over-smoothing issues, leading to invalid knowledge transfer in practical applications. In this paper, we propose the first Free-direction Knowledge Distillation framework via Reinforcement learning for GNNs, called FreeKD, which is no longer required to provide a deeper well-optimized teacher GNN. The core idea of our work is to collaboratively build two shallower GNNs in an effort to exchange knowledge between them via reinforcement learning in a hierarchical way. As we observe that one typical GNN model often has better and worse performances at different nodes during training, we devise a dynamic and free-direction knowledge transfer strategy that consists of two levels of actions: 1) node-level action determines the directions of knowledge transfer between the corresponding nodes of two networks; and then 2) structure-level action determines which of the local structures generated by the node-level actions to be propagated. In essence, our FreeKD is a general and principled framework which can be naturally compatible with GNNs of different architectures. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate our FreeKD outperforms two base GNNs in a large margin, and shows its efficacy to various GNNs. More surprisingly, our FreeKD has comparable or even better performance than traditional KD algorithms that distill knowledge from a deeper and stronger teacher GNN.|知识蒸馏（KD）已证明能有效提升图神经网络（GNN）性能，其核心目标是将深层教师GNN的知识提炼到浅层学生GNN中。然而由于众所周知的过参数化和过平滑问题，实际应用中难以训练出令人满意的教师GNN，导致知识传递失效。本文提出首个基于强化学习的自由方向知识蒸馏框架FreeKD，该框架不再需要提供经过深度优化的教师GNN。我们的核心思想是通过强化学习以分层方式协同构建两个浅层GNN，实现二者间的知识交换。通过观察到典型GNN模型在训练过程中不同节点往往存在性能波动，我们设计了一种动态自由方向知识传递策略，该策略包含两级动作：1）节点级动作决定两个网络对应节点间的知识传递方向；2）结构级动作决定由节点级动作生成的哪些局部结构需要传播。本质上，FreeKD是一个通用且具有原则性的框架，可自然兼容不同架构的GNN。在五个基准数据集上的大量实验表明，FreeKD显著优于两个基线GNN，并证明其对各类GNN的有效性。更令人惊讶的是，FreeKD的性能与传统KD算法（从更深层、更强壮的教师GNN中提取知识）相当甚至更优。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=FreeKD:+Free-direction+Knowledge+Distillation+for+Graph+Neural+Networks)|0|
|[SIPF: Sampling Method for Inverse Protein Folding](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539284)|Tianfan Fu, Jimeng Sun|Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL USA; Georgia Inst Technol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA|Protein engineering has important applications in drug discovery. Among others, inverse protein folding is a fundamental task in protein design, which aims at generating protein's amino acid sequence given a 3D graph structure. However, most existing methods for inverse protein folding are based on sequential generative models and therefore limited in uncertainty quantification and exploration ability to the entire protein space. To address the issues, we propose a sampling method for inverse protein folding (SIPF). Specifically, we formulate inverse protein folding as a sampling problem and design two pretrained neural networks as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) proposal distribution. To ensure sampling efficiency, we further design (i) an adaptive sampling scheme to select variables for sampling and (ii) an approximate target distribution as a surrogate of the unavailable target distribution. Empirical studies have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of SIPF, achieving 7.4% relative improvement on recovery rate and 6.4% relative reduction in perplexity compared to the best baseline.|蛋白质工程在药物发现领域具有重要应用价值。其中，逆蛋白质折叠是蛋白质设计中的一项基础性任务，其目标是根据三维图结构生成蛋白质的氨基酸序列。然而，现有的大多数逆蛋白质折叠方法基于序列生成模型，因此存在不确定性量化能力不足以及对整个蛋白质空间探索能力有限的问题。为解决这些局限性，我们提出了一种逆蛋白质折叠采样方法（SIPF）。具体而言，我们将逆蛋白质折叠问题构建为采样问题，并设计两个预训练神经网络作为马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛（MCMC）的建议分布。为确保采样效率，我们进一步设计了：（1）自适应采样方案用于选择待采样变量；（2）近似目标分布作为不可获得目标分布的替代。实证研究验证了SIPF方法的有效性，与最佳基线相比，恢复率相对提升7.4%，困惑度相对降低6.4%。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=SIPF:+Sampling+Method+for+Inverse+Protein+Folding)|0|
|[Antibody Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs) design using Constrained Energy Model](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539285)|Tianfan Fu, Jimeng Sun|Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL USA; Georgia Inst Technol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA|In recent years, therapeutic antibodies have become one of the fastest-growing classes of drugs and have been approved for the treatment of a wide range of indications, from cancer to autoimmune diseases. Complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) are part of the variable chains in antibodies and determine specific antibody-antigen binding. Some explorations use in silicon methods to design antibody CDR loops. However, the existing methods faced the challenges of maintaining the specific geometry shape of the CDR loops. This paper proposes a Constrained Energy Model (CEM) to address this issue. Specifically, we design a constrained manifold to characterize the geometry constraints of the CDR loops. Then we design the energy model in the constrained manifold and only depict the energy landscape of the manifold instead of the whole space in the vanilla energy model. The geometry shape of the generated CDR loops is automatically preserved. Theoretical analysis shows that learning on the constrained manifold requires less sample complexity than the unconstrained method. CEM's superiority is validated via thorough empirical studies, achieving consistent and significant improvement with up to 33.4% relative reduction in terms of 3D geometry error (Root Mean Square Deviation, RMSD) and 8.4% relative reduction in terms of amino acid sequence metric (perplexity) compared to the best baseline method.

The core of PLL is to learn efficient feature representations to facilitate label disambiguation. However, existing PLL methods only learn plain representations by coarse supervision, which is incapable of capturing sufficiently distinguishable representations, especially when confronted with the knotty label ambiguity, i.e., certain candidate labels share similar visual patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel framework partial label learning with semantic label representations dubbed ParSE, which consists of two synergistic processes, including visual-semantic representation learning and powerful label disambiguation. In the former process, we propose a novel weighted calibration rank loss that has two implications. First, it implies a progressive calibration strategy that utilizes the disambiguated label confidence to weight the similarity between each image feature embedding and its corresponding semantic label representations of all candidates. Second, it also considers the ranking relationship between candidate and non-candidate ones. Based on learned visual-semantic representations, subsequent label disambiguation is desirably endowed with more powerful abilities. Experiments on benchmarks show that ParSE outperforms state-of-the-art counterparts.|部分标记学习（PLL）致力于解决每个训练实例被赋予候选标记集合、而其中仅有一个为真实标记的问题。其核心在于学习有效的特征表示以促进标记消歧。然而现有PLL方法仅通过粗粒度监督学习平面表示，难以捕获足够区分的特征表征，尤其在处理棘手的标记模糊性问题时（即某些候选标记具有相似视觉模式）。本文提出新型语义标签表示框架ParSE，该框架包含视觉-语义表示学习与强效标记消歧两个协同过程。在前者中，我们提出具有双重作用的新型加权校准排序损失：一方面采用渐进式校准策略，利用已消解的标记置信度加权处理图像特征嵌入与所有候选语义标签表示之间的相似度；另一方面综合考虑候选标记与非候选标记间的排序关系。基于学习到的视觉-语义表示，后续标记消歧过程被赋予更强大的能力。基准测试表明，ParSE性能优于现有最先进方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Partial+Label+Learning+with+Semantic+Label+Representations)|0|

The algorithm works as a drop-in replacement that preserves all estimation properties of the HyperLogLog sketch, it is possible to convert back and forth between the compressed and uncompressed representations, and the compressed sketch maintains mergeability in the compressed domain. The compressed sketch can be updated in amortized constant time, assuming n is sufficiently larger than m. We provide a C++ implementation of the sketch, and show by experimental evaluation against well-known implementations by Google and Apache that our implementation provides small sketches while maintaining competitive update and merge times. Concretely, we observed approximately a 40% reduction in the sketch size. Furthermore, we obtain as a corollary a theoretical algorithm that compresses the sketch down to $młog_2łog_2łog_2łog_2 m+O(młogłogłog m/łogłog m+łogłog n)$ bits.|我们提出HyperLogLogLog——一种实用的HyperLogLog草图压缩方案，将用于估计不同元素数量n的m个寄存器草图从$O(m\log\log n)$比特压缩至$m\log_2\log_2\log_2 m + O(m+\log\log n)$比特。该算法可作为即插即用的替代方案，完整保留HyperLogLog草图的所有估计特性，支持压缩与未压缩表示形式之间的双向转换，且在压缩状态下仍保持可合并性。当n远大于m时，压缩草图的更新操作可在摊销常数时间内完成。我们提供了该草图的C++实现，并通过与谷歌和Apache知名实现的实验对比表明：我们的实现能在保持竞争力的更新与合并速度的同时，显著减小草图体积——具体观测到近40%的体积缩减。此外，我们推导出一个理论算法作为推论，可将草图进一步压缩至$m\log_2\log_2\log_2\log_2 m+O(m\log\log\log m/\log\log m+\log\log n)$比特。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=HyperLogLogLog:+Cardinality+Estimation+With+One+Log+More)|0|

SGMs are known to surpass other generative models, e.g., generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs). Being inspired by their big success, in this work, we fully customize them for generating fake tabular data. In particular, we are interested in oversampling minor classes since imbalanced classes frequently lead to sub-optimal training outcomes. To our knowledge, we are the first presenting a score-based tabular data oversampling method. Firstly, we re-design our own score network since we have to process tabular data. Secondly, we propose two options for our generation method: the former is equivalent to a style transfer for tabular data and the latter uses the standard generative policy of SGMs. Lastly, we define a fine-tuning method, which further enhances the oversampling quality. In our experiments with 6 datasets and 10 baselines, our method outperforms other oversampling methods in all cases.|基于分数的生成模型（SGMs）是近期生成伪造图像领域的一项突破性技术。该模型已知能够超越其他生成模型，例如生成对抗网络（GANs）和变分自编码器（VAEs）。受其巨大成功的启发，本研究将其完全定制用于生成伪造表格数据。我们特别关注对少数类别的过采样，因为类别不平衡往往会导致训练效果欠佳。据我们所知，这是首个基于分数的表格数据过采样方法。首先，由于需要处理表格数据，我们重新设计了专用的分数网络架构。其次，我们提出两种生成方案：前者等效于表格数据的风格迁移技术，后者采用SGM的标准生成策略。最后，我们定义了可进一步提升过采样质量的微调方法。在包含6个数据集和10个基线方法的实验中，本方法在所有案例中都优于其他过采样方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=SOS:+Score-based+Oversampling+for+Tabular+Data)|0|

However, new systems often have limited data for training the model, calling for effective knowledge transfer from other relevant grids. Specifically, Domain Adaptation (DA) seeks domain-invariant features to boost the model performance in the target domain. Nonetheless, existing DA techniques face significant challenges due to the unique characteristics of physical datasets: (1) complex spatial-temporal correlations, (2) diverse data sources including node/edge measurements and labels, and (3) large-scale data sizes. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-graph DA based on two core designs of graph kernels and graph coarsening. The former design handles spatial-temporal correlations and can incorporate networked measurements and labels conveniently. The spatial structures, temporal trends, measurement similarity, and label information together determine the similarity of two graphs, guiding the DA to find domain-invariant features. Mathematically, we construct a Graph kerNel-based distribution Adaptation (GNA) with a specifically-designed graph kernel. Then, we prove the proposed kernel is positive definite and universal, which strictly guarantees the feasibility of the used DA measure. However, the computation cost of the kernel is prohibitive for large systems. In response, we propose a novel coarsening process to obtain much smaller graphs for GNA. Finally, we report the superiority of GNA in diversified systems, including power systems, mass-damper systems, and human-activity sensing systems.|物理系统正通过低成本、低功耗传感器及先进的数据挖掘与机器学习技术，将监测能力延伸至边缘区域。然而，新建系统往往缺乏足够的训练数据，亟需从其他相关电网中实现有效的知识迁移。具体而言，域适应（DA）通过寻找域不变特征来提升模型在目标域的性能。但由于物理数据集具有三大独特特性：（1）复杂的时空相关性；（2）节点/边缘测量值和标签等多源数据；（3）大规模数据量，现有DA技术面临重大挑战。本文提出基于图核与图粗化双核心设计的新型跨图域适应方法。前者通过专门设计的图核处理时空相关性，并可无缝整合网络化测量值与标签数据——空间结构、时间趋势、测量相似性和标签信息共同决定了图的相似度，从而指导DA寻找域不变特征。在数学层面，我们构建了基于图核的分布自适应（GNA）框架，并严格证明了所提出核函数的正定性与普适性，从理论上保障了DA度量的可行性。针对大型系统核计算成本过高的问题，我们创新性地提出粗化处理方案，为GNA生成规模显著缩减的图结构。最终在电力系统、质量-阻尼系统和人体活动感知系统等多元场景中验证了GNA的优越性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Domain+Adaptation+in+Physical+Systems+via+Graph+Kernel)|0|

Although representation learning has advantages in prediction accuracy, it is inherently deficient in the abilities to interpret or to reason well. It has long been realized as far back as in 1990 by Marvin Minsky that connectionist networks and symbolic rules should co-exist in a system and overcome the deficiencies of each other. The goal of this paper is to show that it is feasible to simultaneously and efficiently perform representation learning (for connectionist networks) and rule learning spontaneously out of the same online training process for graph streams. We devise such a system called RL$^2$, and show, both analytically and empirically, that it is highly efficient and responsive for graph streams, and produces good results for both representation learning and rule learning in terms of prediction accuracy and returning top-quality rules for interpretation and building dynamic Bayesian networks.|异构图流在当今应用中十分普遍。尽管表示学习在预测准确性方面具有优势，但其在解释与推理能力方面存在固有不足。早在1990年，马文·明斯基就已指出：连接主义网络与符号规则应当共存于系统中，以相互弥补不足。本文旨在证明，针对图流数据，通过同一在线训练过程同步高效地实现表示学习（面向连接主义网络）与规则自主学习具有可行性。我们设计了名为RL$^2$的系统，通过理论分析和实验验证表明：该系统对图流处理具有高效性与快速响应特性，在表示学习和规则学习方面均能取得优异成果——既保证了预测精度，又能产出高质量规则用于解释推理与构建动态贝叶斯网络。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=RL2:+A+Call+for+Simultaneous+Representation+Learning+and+Rule+Learning+for+Graph+Streams)|0|

Kleinberg, Ashton Anderson|Cornell, Ithaca, NY USA; Microsoft Res, New York, NY USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA USA; Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada|AI systems that can capture human-like behavior are becoming increasingly useful in situations where humans may want to learn from these systems, collaborate with them, or engage with them as partners for an extended duration. In order to develop human-oriented AI systems, the problem of predicting human actions---as opposed to predicting optimal actions---has received considerable attention. Existing work has focused on capturing human behavior in an aggregate sense, which potentially limits the benefit any particular individual could gain from interaction with these systems. We extend this line of work by developing highly accurate predictive models of individual human behavior in chess. Chess is a rich domain for exploring human-AI interaction because it combines a unique set of properties: AI systems achieved superhuman performance many years ago, and yet humans still interact with them closely, both as opponents and as preparation tools, and there is an enormous corpus of recorded data on individual player games. Starting with Maia, an open-source version of AlphaZero trained on a population of human players, we demonstrate that we can significantly improve prediction accuracy of a particular player's moves by applying a series of fine-tuning methods. Furthermore, our personalized models can be used to perform stylometry---predicting who made a given set of moves---indicating that they capture human decision-making at an individual level. Our work demonstrates a way to bring AI systems into better alignment with the behavior of individual people, which could lead to large improvements in human-AI interaction.|能够模拟人类行为的AI系统正变得日益重要，这类系统适用于人类向其学习、与其协作或长期作为合作伙伴等场景。为开发以人类为中心的AI系统，预测人类行为（而非最优行为）的问题已受到广泛关注。现有研究主要聚焦于从整体层面捕捉人类行为模式，这可能限制了个体从与系统互动中获得的收益。我们通过构建高精度的国际象棋个人行为预测模型拓展了这一研究方向。国际象棋是探索人机交互的绝佳领域，因其兼具以下特性：多年前AI系统就已实现超人类水平的表现，但人类仍以对手和训练工具的形式与之密切互动，且存在海量的个人棋局数据记录。基于开源人类棋手训练版AlphaZero——Maia系统，我们通过应用系列微调方法，显著提升了对特定棋手行棋预测的准确率。此外，个性化模型可实现笔迹鉴定式预测（通过棋路风格识别对应棋手），这表明模型能在个体层面捕捉人类决策特征。本研究展示了使AI系统更好契合个体行为特征的技术路径，有望显著提升人机交互体验。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Learning+Models+of+Individual+Behavior+in+Chess)|0|

To leverage the rich information in AGG, we propose a bandit algorithm, AGG-UCB, where the neural networks are designed to estimate rewards, and we propose to utilize graph neural networks (GNN) to learn the representations of arm groups with correlations. To solve the exploitation-exploration dilemma in bandits, we derive a new upper confidence bound (UCB) built on neural networks (exploitation) for exploration. Furthermore, we prove that AGG-UCB can achieve a near-optimal regret bound with over-parameterized neural networks, and provide the convergence analysis of GNN with fully-connected layers which may be of independent interest.

This may bring in unwanted bias since RL is a reward maximizing process instead of simple label matching. Given such an issue, we denote the frame importance as its contribution to the expected reward on a particular frame, and hypothesize that adapting such frame importance could benefit the performance of the distilled student policy. To verify our hypothesis, we analyze why and how frame importance matters in RL settings. Based on the analysis, we propose an importance prioritized PD framework that highlights the training on important frames, so as to learn efficiently. Particularly, the frame importance is measured by the reciprocal of weighted Shannon entropy from a teacher policy's action prescriptions.

|[DICE: Domain-attack Invariant Causal Learning for Improved Data Privacy Protection and Adversarial Robustness](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539242)|Qibing Ren, Yiting Chen, Yichuan Mo, Qitian Wu, Junchi Yan|Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China|The adversarial attack reveals the vulnerability of deep models by incurring test domain shift, while delusive attack relieves the privacy concern about personal data by injecting malicious noise into the training domain to make data unexploitable. However, beyond their successful applications, the two attacks can be easily defended by adversarial training (AT). While AT is not the panacea, it suffers from poor generalization for robustness. For the limitations of attack and defense, we argue that to fit data well, DNNs can learn the spurious relations between inputs and outputs, which are consequently utilized by the attack and defense and degrade their effectiveness, and DNNs can not easily capture the causal relations like humans to make robust decisions under attacks. In this paper, to better understand and improve attack and defense, we first take a bottom-up perspective to describe the correlations between latent factors and observed data, then analyze the effect of domain shift on DNNs induced by attack and finally develop our causal graph, namely Domain-attack Invariant Causal Model (DICM). Based on DICM, we propose a coherent causal invariant principle, which guides our algorithm design to infer the human-like causal relations. We call our algorithm Domain-attack Invariant Causal Learning (DICE) and the experimental results on two attacks and one defense task verify its effectiveness.|对抗性攻击通过引发测试域偏移揭示深度模型的脆弱性，而欺骗性攻击则通过向训练域注入恶意噪声使数据无法被利用，从而缓解个人隐私担忧。然而这两种攻击虽成功应用，却极易被对抗训练（AT）所防御。但对抗训练并非万能良方，其存在鲁棒性泛化能力不足的缺陷。针对攻击与防御的局限性，我们认为深度神经网络为更好地拟合数据，可能学习到输入与输出间的伪相关关系——这些伪关系被攻击与防御机制利用后反而会削弱其有效性，且深度神经网络难以像人类那样捕捉因果关系以在攻击下做出鲁棒决策。本文为深入理解并改进攻击与防御机制，首先采用自下而上的视角描述潜在因子与观测数据间的关联，进而分析攻击引发的域偏移对深度神经网络的影响，最终构建出域攻击不变因果模型（DICM）这一因果图。基于DICM，我们提出连贯的因果不变性原则指导算法设计，以推断类人因果关系的域攻击不变因果学习（DICE）算法。在两种攻击和一项防御任务上的实验结果验证了该算法的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=DICE:+Domain-attack+Invariant+Causal+Learning+for+Improved+Data+Privacy+Protection+and+Adversarial+Robustness)|0|
|[Balancing Bias and Variance for Active Weakly Supervised Learning](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539264)|Hitesh Sapkota, Qi Yu|Rochester Inst Technol, Rochester, NY 14623 USA|As a widely used weakly supervised learning scheme, modern multiple instance learning (MIL) models achieve competitive performance at the bag level. However, instance-level prediction, which is essential for many important applications, remains largely unsatisfactory. We propose to conduct novel active deep multiple instance learning that samples a small subset of informative instances for annotation, aiming to significantly boost the instance-level prediction. A variance regularized loss function is designed to properly balance the bias and variance of instance-level predictions, aiming to effectively accommodate the highly imbalanced instance distribution in MIL and other fundamental challenges. Instead of directly minimizing the variance regularized loss that is non-convex, we optimize a distributionally robust bag level likelihood as its convex surrogate. The robust bag likelihood provides a good approximation of the variance based MIL loss with a strong theoretical guarantee. It also automatically balances bias and variance, making it effective to identify the potentially positive instances to support active sampling. The robust bag likelihood can be naturally integrated with a deep architecture to support deep model training using mini-batches of positive-negative bag pairs. Finally, a novel P-F sampling function is developed that combines a probability vector and predicted instance scores, obtained by optimizing the robust bag likelihood. By leveraging the key MIL assumption, the sampling function can explore the most challenging bags and effectively detect their positive instances for annotation, which significantly improves the instance-level prediction. Experiments conducted over multiple real-world datasets clearly demonstrate the state-of-the-art instance-level prediction achieved by the proposed model.|作为一项广泛应用的弱监督学习方案，现代多示例学习（MIL）模型在包级别已实现优异性能。然而对于许多关键应用至关重要的实例级预测，其表现仍不尽如人意。我们提出一种新型主动深度多示例学习方法，通过采样少量信息丰富的实例进行标注，旨在显著提升实例级预测性能。本研究设计了一种方差正则化损失函数，通过合理平衡实例级预测的偏差与方差，有效应对MIL中高度不平衡的实例分布及其他基础性挑战。针对该非凸的方差正则化损失函数，我们通过优化分布鲁棒的包级别似然函数作为其凸替代目标。该鲁棒包似然函数在强理论保证下可有效近似基于方差的MIL损失，同时自动平衡偏差与方差，从而有效识别潜在正实例以支持主动采样。该鲁棒包似然可自然融入深度架构，支持使用正负包对的小批量数据进行深度模型训练。此外，通过结合概率向量与鲁棒包似然优化得到的实例预测分数，我们开发了新型P-F采样函数。该方法利用MIL的核心假设，能够探索最具挑战性的包并有效检测其中待标注的正实例，从而显著提升实例级预测精度。在多个真实数据集上的实验结果表明，所提出模型实现了当前最先进的实例级预测性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Balancing+Bias+and+Variance+for+Active+Weakly+Supervised+Learning)|0|
|[Learning Optimal Priors for Task-Invariant Representations in Variational Autoencoders](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539291)|Hiroshi Takahashi, Tomoharu Iwata, Atsutoshi Kumagai, Sekitoshi Kanai, Masanori Yamada, Yuki Yamanaka, Hisashi Kashima|NTT, Nairobi, Kenya; Kyoto Univ, Kyoto, Japan|The variational autoencoder (VAE) is a powerful latent variable model for unsupervised representation learning. However, it does not work well in case of insufficient data points. To improve the performance in such situations, the conditional VAE (CVAE) is widely used, which aims to share task-invariant knowledge with multiple tasks through the task-invariant latent variable. In the CVAE, the posterior of the latent variable given the data point and task is regularized by the task-invariant prior, which is modeled by the standard Gaussian distribution. Although this regularization encourages independence between the latent variable and task, the latent variable remains dependent on the task. To reduce this task-dependency, the previous work introduced an additional regularizer. However, its learned representation does not work well on the target tasks. In this study, we theoretically investigate why the CVAE cannot sufficiently reduce the task-dependency and show that the simple standard Gaussian prior is one of the causes. Based on this, we propose a theoretical optimal prior for reducing the task-dependency. In addition, we theoretically show that unlike the previous work, our learned representation works well on the target tasks. Experiments on various datasets show that our approach obtains better task-invariant representations, which improves the performances of various downstream applications such as density estimation and classification.|变分自编码器（VAE）是一种强大的潜在变量模型，可用于无监督表示学习。但在数据点不足的情况下，其性能表现不佳。为改善这一局限，条件变分自编码器（CVAE）被广泛采用，其通过任务无关潜在变量实现多任务间的知识共享。在CVAE框架中，基于数据点和任务给出的潜在变量后验分布会受到任务无关先验分布（以标准高斯分布建模）的正则化约束。尽管这种正则化促进了潜在变量与任务间的独立性，但潜在变量仍会保留对任务的依赖性。为降低这种任务依赖性，先前研究引入了额外的正则化项，但所学表征在目标任务上表现仍不理想。本研究从理论角度揭示了CVAE无法充分降低任务依赖性的原因，并证明简单的标准高斯先验是成因之一。基于此，我们提出了理论最优先验分布以降低任务依赖性。此外，我们通过理论证明：与先前工作不同，本方法所学表征在目标任务上表现优异。在多数据集上的实验表明，我们的方法能获得更优的任务无关表征，从而提升密度估计和分类等下游应用的性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Learning+Optimal+Priors+for+Task-Invariant+Representations+in+Variational+Autoencoders)|0|
|[Aligning Dual Disentangled User Representations from Ratings and Textual Content](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539474)|NhuThuat Tran, Hady W. Lauw|Singapore Management Univ, Singapore, Singapore|Classical recommendation methods typically render user representation as a single vector in latent space. Oftentimes, a user's interactions with items are influenced by several hidden factors. To better uncover these hidden factors, we seek disentangled representations. Existing disentanglement methods for recommendations are mainly concerned with user-item interactions alone. To further improve not only the effectiveness of recommendations but also the interpretability of the representations, we propose to learn a second set of disentangled user representations from textual content and to align the two sets of representations with one another. The purpose of this coupling is two-fold. For one benefit, we leverage textual content to resolve sparsity of user-item interactions, leading to higher recommendation accuracy. For another benefit, by regularizing factors learned from user-item interactions with factors learned from textual content, we map uninterpretable dimensions from user representation into words. An attention-based alignment is introduced to align and enrich hidden factors representations. A series of experiments conducted on four real-world datasets show the efficacy of our methods in improving recommendation quality.|传统推荐方法通常将用户表征呈现为潜在空间中的单一向量。由于用户与项目的交互行为往往受到多个潜在因素的影响，为了更好地揭示这些隐藏因素，我们寻求解耦式表征学习。现有推荐系统中的解耦方法主要仅关注用户-项目交互行为。为了进一步提升推荐效果并增强表征的可解释性，我们提出从文本内容中学习第二组解耦式用户表征，并将两组表征进行对齐。这种耦合设计具有双重优势：一方面，利用文本内容缓解用户-项目交互的稀疏性问题，从而提高推荐准确率；另一方面，通过将交互数据学习的因子与文本内容学习的因子进行正则化对齐，我们将用户表征中难以解释的维度映射到可理解的词汇空间。本文引入基于注意力机制的对齐方法来实现隐藏因子表征的对齐与增强。在四个真实数据集上进行的一系列实验证明了我们方法在提升推荐质量方面的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Aligning+Dual+Disentangled+User+Representations+from+Ratings+and+Textual+Content)|0|

However, the presence of unmeasured confounders increases the difficulty of estimating ICE in real-world scenarios. A wide range of methods have been proposed to address the unmeasured confounders with the aid of instrument variable (IV), which sources from the treatment randomization. The performance of these methods relies on the well-predefined IVs that satisfy the unconfounded instruments assumption (i.e., the IVs are independent with the unmeasured confounders given observed covariates), which is untestable and leads to finding a valid IV becomes an art rather than science. In this paper, we focus on estimating the ICE with confounded instruments that violate the unconfounded instruments assumption. By considering the conditional independence between the set of confounded instruments and the outcome variable, we propose a novel method, named CVAE-IV, to generate a substitute of the unmeasured confounder with a conditional variational autoencoder. Our theoretical analysis guarantees that the generated confounder substitute will identify unbiased ICE. Extensive experiments on bias demand prediction and Mendelian randomization analysis verify the effectiveness of our method.|学习个体化因果效应（ICE）在大数据分析的诸多领域具有至关重要的作用，从精细化政策评估到个性化治疗方案制定皆涵盖其中。然而在实际场景中，未测量混杂因子的存在增加了ICE估计的难度。现有研究多借助源自处理随机化的工具变量（IV）来解决未测量混杂因子问题，这些方法的性能依赖于满足"无混杂工具变量假设"（即给定观测协变量后IV与未测量混杂因子独立）的预定义IV。由于该假设不可检验，导致寻找有效IV的过程更像艺术而非科学。本文重点研究违反无混杂工具变量假设的混杂工具变量下的ICE估计问题。通过考虑混杂工具变量集与结果变量间的条件独立性，我们提出名为CVAE-IV的新方法，利用条件变分自编码器生成未测量混杂因子的替代变量。理论分析证明生成的混杂因子替代变量能够识别无偏ICE。在偏置需求预测和孟德尔随机化分析上的大量实验验证了本方法的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Estimating+Individualized+Causal+Effect+with+Confounded+Instruments)|0|

Traditional incremental learning methods will gradually forget old knowledge when learning new patterns, which is the catastrophic forgetting problem. Although saving and revisiting historical graph data alleviates the problem, the storage limitation in real-world applications reduces the amount of saved data, causing GNN to forget other knowledge. In this paper, we propose a streaming GNN based on generative replay, which can incrementally learn new patterns while maintaining existing knowledge without accessing historical data. Specifically, our model consists of the main model (GNN) and an auxiliary generative model. The generative model based on random walks with restart can learn and generate fake historical samples (i.e., nodes and their neighborhoods), which can be trained with real data to avoid the forgetting problem. Besides, we also design an incremental update algorithm for the generative model to maintain the graph distribution and for GNN to capture the current patterns. Our model is evaluated on different streaming data sets. The node classification results prove that our model can update the model efficiently and achieve comparable performance to model retraining.

However, most existing works are designed for the static setting, and can be hardly extended to the dynamic setting commonly seen in many real-world applications. In this paper, we focus on the more realistic open-set domain adaptation setting with a static source task and a time evolving target task where novel unknown target classes appear over time. Specifically, we show that the classification error of the new target task can be tightly bounded in terms of positive-unlabeled classification errors for historical tasks and open-set domain discrepancy across tasks. By empirically minimizing the upper bound of the target error, we propose a novel positive-unlabeled learning based algorithm named OuterAdapter for dynamic open-set domain adaptation with time evolving unknown classes. Extensive experiments on various data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed OuterAdapter algorithm over state-of-the-art domain adaptation baselines.|开放集域自适应旨在利用仅包含部分类别的相关源任务标签信息，提升学习算法在目标感兴趣任务上的泛化性能。然而现有方法大多针对静态场景设计，难以扩展至现实应用中常见的动态场景。本文聚焦于更具现实意义的开放集域自适应场景：源任务保持静态，而目标任务随时间动态演化，其中未知目标类别会随时间不断涌现。我们通过理论证明表明，新目标任务的分类误差可由历史任务的正-无标记分类误差及跨任务开放集域差异项构成紧致上界。通过对该误差上界进行经验性最小化，我们提出基于正-无标记学习的新型算法OuterAdapter，用于处理具有时序演化未知类别的动态开放集域自适应问题。在多组数据集上的大量实验表明，相较于最先进的域自适应基线方法，我们提出的OuterAdapter算法具有显著优越的性能与效率。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Domain+Adaptation+with+Dynamic+Open-Set+Targets)|0|

Meanwhile, nonstationarity, such as the time-of-day effect, can commonly arise in various business metrics. We show that inadequately addressing nonstationarity can cause A/B tests to be statistically inefficient or invalid, leading to wrong conclusions. To address these issues, we develop a new framework that provides appropriate modeling and adequate statistical analysis for nonstationary A/B tests. Without changing the infrastructure for any existing A/B test procedure, we propose a new estimator that views time as a continuous covariate to perform post stratification with a sample-dependent number of stratification levels. We prove central limit theorem in a natural limiting regime under nonstationarity, so that valid large-sample statistical inference is available. We show that the proposed estimator achieves the optimal asymptotic variance among all estimators. When the experiment design phase of an A/B test allows, we propose a new time-grouped randomization approach to make a better balance on treatment and control assignments in presence of time nonstationarity.

These approaches are usually trained on graphs randomly generated with graph generators or sampled from existing datasets. However, we observe that such training graphs lead to poor testing performance if the testing graphs are not generated analogously, i.e., the generalibility of the models trained on those randomly generated training graphs are very limited. To address this critical issue, in this paper, we propose a new framework, named Learning with Iterative Graph Diversification (LIGD), and formulate a new research problem, named Diverse Graph Modification Problem (DGMP), that iteratively generate diversified training graphs and train the models that solve graph optimization problems to significantly improve their performance. We propose three approaches to solve DGMP by considering both the performance of the machine-learning approaches and the structural properties of the training graphs.

For example, in the conversion prediction in online ads, we initially receive negative samples that clicked the ads but did not buy an item; subsequently, some samples among them buy an item then change to positive. In the setting of DF learning, we observe samples over time, then learn a classifier at some point. We initially receive negative samples; subsequently, some samples among them change to positive. This problem is conceivable in various real-world applications such as online advertisements, where the user action takes place long after the first click. Owing to the delayed feedback, naive classification of the positive and negative samples returns a biased classifier. One solution is to use samples that have been observed for more than a certain time window assuming these samples are correctly labeled. However, existing studies reported that simply using a subset of all samples based on the time window assumption does not perform well, and that using all samples along with the time window assumption improves empirical performance. We extend these existing studies and propose a method with the unbiased and convex empirical risk that is constructed from all samples under the time window assumption. To demonstrate the soundness of the proposed method, we provide experimental results on a synthetic and open dataset that is the real traffic log datasets in online advertising.|我们研究在延迟反馈（\emph{DF学习}）场景下的二分类器训练问题。以在线广告转化预测为例：初始阶段我们获得的是点击广告但未购买商品的负样本；后续其中部分样本会产生购买行为并转为正样本。在DF学习框架中，我们随时间推移持续观测样本，并在特定时间点构建分类器。这种设置普遍存在于在线广告等现实应用场景中，用户行为往往在首次点击后很长时间才发生。  由于延迟反馈的存在，直接对正负样本进行分类会导致分类器产生偏差。现有解决方案之一是采用时间窗口假设，即仅使用观察时长超过特定阈值的样本（假定这些样本已被正确标记）。然而研究表明，单纯基于时间窗口假设使用样本子集效果有限，而结合时间窗口假设使用全量样本能提升模型性能。  我们在此基础上提出创新方法：在时间窗口假设下，利用全量样本构建无偏且凸的经验风险函数。为验证方法的有效性，我们分别在合成数据集和开放数据集（真实在线广告流量日志）上进行了实验验证。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Learning+Classifiers+under+Delayed+Feedback+with+a+Time+Window+Assumption)|0|

Traditional model-based methods of sensor management are limited to specific systems/settings, which can be challenged when system knowledge is intractable. Fortunately, the large amount of data collected in real-time allows machine learning methods to be a complement. Especially, reinforcement learning-based control is recognized for its capability to dynamically interact with systems. However, the direct implementation of learning methods easily overfits and results in inaccurate physics modeling for sensor management. Although physical regularization is a popular direction to bridge the gap, learning-based sensor control still suffers from convergence failure under highly complex and uncertain scenarios. This paper develops physics-embedded and self-supervised reinforcement learning for sensor management using an intrinsic reward. Specifically, the intrinsic-motivated sensor management (IMSM) constructs the local surprise information from the physical latent features, which captures hidden states in observations, and thus intrinsically motivates the agent to speed-up exploration. We show that the designs can not only relieve the lack of consistency with underlying physics/physical dynamics, but also adapt the global objective of maximizing monitoring capabilities to local environment changes. We demonstrate its effectiveness by experiments on physical system sensor control. The proposed model is implemented for the sensor management of unmanned vehicles and sensor rescheduling in complex/settled power systems, with or without observability constraints. Numerical results show that our model provides consistently higher threat detection accuracy and better observability recovery, as compared to existing methods.|在现代复杂物理系统中，先进传感技术虽扩展了传感器覆盖范围，但也增加了基于实时数据提升系统监测能力的难度。传统基于模型的传感器管理方法受限于特定系统/场景，当系统知识难以获取时其有效性面临挑战。幸运的是，实时采集的海量数据为机器学习方法提供了补充途径，其中基于强化学习的控制方法因其动态系统交互能力备受关注。然而直接应用学习方法易导致过拟合，造成传感器管理中的物理建模失准。尽管物理正则化是弥合这一差距的热门方向，但在高度复杂和不确定场景下，基于学习的传感器控制仍存在收敛失败问题。本文提出一种嵌入物理机制且具有自监督特性的强化学习方法，通过内在奖励实现传感器管理。具体而言，内在激励传感器管理（IMSM）框架从物理潜在特征中构建局部惊奇信息，这些特征可捕捉观测中的隐藏状态，从而通过内在激励加速智能体的探索过程。我们证明该设计不仅能缓解与底层物理/物理动力学的一致性缺失问题，还能使最大化监测能力的全局目标适配局部环境变化。通过物理系统传感器控制实验验证了方法的有效性：将所提模型应用于无人驾驶车辆传感器管理及复杂/稳定电力系统中的传感器重调度任务，涵盖可观测性与不可观测性约束场景。数值结果表明，相较于现有方法，本模型持续提供更高的威胁检测精度和更优的可观测性恢复能力。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Intrinsic-Motivated+Sensor+Management:+Exploring+with+Physical+Surprise)|0|

In order to predict the unlabeled nodes from unseen classes, zero-shot node classification needs to transfer knowledge from seen classes to unseen classes. It is crucial to consider the relations between the classes in zero-shot node classification. However, the GCN only considers the relations between the nodes, not the relations between the classes. Therefore, the GCN can not handle the zero-shot node classification effectively. This paper proposes a Dual Bidirectional Graph Convolutional Networks (DBiGCN) that consists of dual BiGCNs from the perspective of the nodes and the classes, respectively. The BiGCN can integrate the relations between the nodes and between the classes simultaneously in an united network. In addition, to make the dual BiGCNs work collaboratively, a label consistency loss is introduced, which can achieve mutual guidance and mutual improvement between the dual BiGCNs. Finally, the experimental results on real-world graph data sets verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.|零样本节点分类对图卷积网络(GCN)等经典半监督节点分类算法构成重要挑战，尽管GCN已在节点分类领域获得广泛应用。为预测未知类别中的未标记节点，零样本节点分类需要实现从已知类别到未知类别的知识迁移。在此过程中，准确捕捉类别间关联至关重要。然而传统GCN仅考虑节点间关系而忽略类别间关联，导致其难以有效处理零样本节点分类任务。本文提出双双向图卷积网络(DBiGCN)，通过分别从节点视角和类别视角构建的双BiGCN结构，在统一网络中同步整合节点间与类别间关联。此外，通过引入标签一致性损失函数实现双BiGCN的协同工作机制，形成双向引导与共同优化的学习范式。最终在真实图数据集上的实验结果验证了所提方法的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Dual+Bidirectional+Graph+Convolutional+Networks+for+Zero-shot+Node+Classification)|0|
|[Physics-infused Machine Learning for Crowd Simulation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539440)|Guozhen Zhang, Zihan Yu, Depeng Jin, Yong Li|Tsinghua Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China|Crowd simulation acts as the basic component in traffic management, urban planning, and emergency management. Most existing approaches use physics-based models due to their robustness and strong generalizability, yet they fall short in fidelity since human behaviors are too complex and heterogeneous for a universal physical model to describe. Recent research tries to solve this problem by deep learning methods. However, they are still unable to generalize well beyond training distributions. In this work, we propose to jointly leverage the strength of the physical and neural network models for crowd simulation by a Physics-Infused Machine Learning (PIML) framework. The key idea is to let the two models learn from each other by iteratively going through a physics-informed machine learning process and a machine-learning-aided physics discovery process. We present our realization of the framework with a novel neural network model, Physics-informed Crowd Simulator (PCS), and tailored interaction mechanisms enabling the two models to facilitate each other. Specifically, our designs enable the neural network model to identify generalizable signals from real-world data better and yield physically consistent simulations with the physical model's form and simulation results as a prior. Further, by performing symbolic regression on the well-trained neural network, we obtain improved physical models that better describe crowd dynamics.

|[Few-shot Heterogeneous Graph Learning via Cross-domain Knowledge Transfer](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539431)|Qiannan Zhang, Xiaodong Wu, Qiang Yang, Chuxu Zhang, Xiangliang Zhang|Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia; Brandeis Univ, Waltham, MA 02254 USA|Graph few-shot learning seeks to alleviate the label scarcity problem resulting from the difficulties and high cost of data annotations in graph learning. However, the overwhelming solutions in graph few-shot learning focus on homogeneous graphs, ignoring the ubiquitous heterogeneous graphs (HGs), which represent real-world complex systems and domain knowledge with multi-typed nodes interconnected by multi-typed edges. To this end, we study the cross-domain few-shot learning problem over HGs and develop a novel model for Cross-domain Heterogeneous Graph Meta learning (CrossHG-Meta). The general idea is to promote the HG node classification in the data-scarce target domain by transferring meta-knowledge from a series of HGs in data-rich source domains. The key challenges are to 1) combat the heterogeneity in HGs to acquire the transferable meta-knowledge; 2) handle the domain shifts between the source HG and target HG; and 3) fast adapt to novel target tasks with few-shot annotated examples. Regarding the graph heterogeneity, CrossHG-Meta firstly builds a graph encoder to aggregate heterogeneous neighborhood information from multiple semantic contexts. Secondly, to tackle domain shifts, a cross-domain meta-learning strategy is proposed to include a domain critic, which is designed to explicitly lead cross-domain adaptation for meta-tasks in different domains and improve model generalizability. Last, to further alleviate data scarcity, CrossHG-Meta leverages unlabelled information in source domains with auxiliary self-supervised learning task to provide cross-domain contrastive regularization alongside the meta-optimization process to facilitate node embedding. Extensive experimental results on three multi-domain HG datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms various state-of-the-art baselines for multiple few-shot node classification tasks under the cross-domain setting.|图少样本学习旨在缓解图学习中因数据标注困难和高成本导致的标签稀缺问题。然而，现有图少样本学习方法大多聚焦于同构图，忽略了普遍存在的异构图（HGs）——这种由多类型节点通过多类型边相互连接构成的图结构能更真实地反映现实世界复杂系统和领域知识。为此，我们研究异构图的跨域少样本学习问题，并提出新型跨域异构图元学习模型CrossHG-Meta。该模型核心思想是通过从多个数据丰富的源域异构图中迁移元知识，提升数据稀缺目标域的异构图节点分类性能。研究面临三大关键挑战：1）克服异质性以获取可迁移的元知识；2）处理源域与目标域异构图间的域偏移；3）通过少量标注样本快速适应新目标任务。针对异质性挑战，CrossHG-Meta首先构建图编码器，从多语义上下文中聚合异构邻域信息；其次通过设计域批判器实现跨域元学习策略，显式引导不同域元任务的跨域适配并提升模型泛化能力；最后利用源域未标注信息，通过辅助自监督学习任务提供跨域对比正则化，在元优化过程中增强节点嵌入表示。在三个多域异构图数据集上的实验表明，该模型在跨域设置下的多种少样本节点分类任务中均优于现有先进基线方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Few-shot+Heterogeneous+Graph+Learning+via+Cross-domain+Knowledge+Transfer)|0|

Since the temporal boundaries and modalities annotations are not provided, only video-level event labels are available, this task is more challenging than conventional video understanding tasks.Most previous works attempt to analyze videos by jointly modeling the audio and video data and then learning information from the segment-level features with fixed lengths. However, such a design exist two defects: 1) The various semantic information hidden in temporal lengths is neglected, which may lead the models to learn incorrect information; 2) Due to the joint context modeling, the unique features of different modalities are not fully explored. In this paper, we propose a novel AVVP framework termedDual Hierarchical Hybrid Network (DHHN) to tackle the above two problems. Our DHHN method consists of three components: 1) A hierarchical context modeling network for extracting different semantics in multiple temporal lengths; 2) A modality-wise guiding network for learning unique information from different modalities; 3) A dual-stream framework generating audio and visual predictions separately. It maintains the best adaptions on different modalities, further boosting the video parsing performance. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our proposed method establishes the new state-of-the-art performance on the AVVP task.|弱监督音视频解析(AVVP)任务旨在将视频划分为时间片段，并根据模态预测事件类别，将其标记为可听、可见或两者兼具。由于未提供时间边界和模态标注，仅具备视频级事件标签，该任务比传统视频理解任务更具挑战性。现有方法大多通过联合建模音频与视频数据，从固定长度的片段级特征中学习信息，但此类设计存在两个缺陷：1）忽视了不同时间长度中隐含的多样化语义信息，可能导致模型学习错误信息；2）由于采用联合上下文建模，未能充分挖掘不同模态的独特特征。本文提出新型双层次混合网络(DHHN)框架以解决上述问题。该框架包含三个核心组件：1）分层上下文建模网络，用于提取多时间尺度的差异化语义；2）模态感知引导网络，用于学习不同模态的独特信息；3）双流预测框架，分别生成音频与视觉预测。该设计保持了对不同模态的最佳适应性，显著提升了视频解析性能。大量定量与定性实验表明，本方法在AVVP任务上取得了最先进的性能表现。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Adaptive+Learning+for+Weakly+Labeled+Streams)|0|
|[Adaptive Fairness-Aware Online Meta-Learning for Changing Environments](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539420)|Chen Zhao, Feng Mi, Xintao Wu, Kai Jiang, Latifur Khan, Feng Chen|Univ Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; Univ Texas Dallas, Richardson, TX 75083 USA|The fairness-aware online learning framework has arisen as a powerful tool for the continual lifelong learning setting. The goal for the learner is to sequentially learn new tasks where they come one after another over time and the learner ensures the statistic parity of the new coming task across different protected sub-populations (e.g. race and gender). A major drawback of existing methods is that they make heavy use of the i.i.d assumption for data and hence provide static regret analysis for the framework. However, low static regret cannot imply a good performance in changing environments where tasks are sampled from heterogeneous distributions. To address the fairness-aware online learning problem in changing environments, in this paper, we first construct a novel regret metric FairSAR by adding long-term fairness constraints onto a strongly adapted loss regret. Furthermore, to determine a good model parameter at each round, we propose a novel adaptive fairness-aware online meta-learning algorithm, namely FairSAOML, which is able to adapt to changing environments in both bias control and model precision. The problem is formulated in the form of a bi-level convex-concave optimization with respect to the model's primal and dual parameters that are associated with the model's accuracy and fairness, respectively. The theoretic analysis provides sub-linear upper bounds for both loss regret and violation of cumulative fairness constraints. Our experimental evaluation on different real-world datasets with settings of changing environments suggests that the proposed FairSAOML significantly outperforms alternatives based on the best prior online learning approaches.|公平感知在线学习框架已成为持续终身学习场景中的强大工具。学习者的目标是按时间顺序依次学习不断出现的新任务，并确保新任务在不同受保护子群体（如种族和性别）间满足统计均等性。现有方法的主要缺陷在于严重依赖数据的独立同分布假设，因此仅能提供该框架的静态遗憾分析。然而在从异质分布中采样任务的变化环境中，低静态遗憾并不能保证良好的性能表现。为解决变化环境中的公平感知在线学习问题，本文首先通过在强适应损失遗憾中施加长期公平约束，构建了新型遗憾度量指标FairSAR。进而为在每轮迭代中确定最优模型参数，我们提出了一种新型自适应公平感知在线元学习算法FairSAOML，该算法能够在偏差控制和模型精度两方面适应变化环境。通过将模型参数分别关联精度与公平性的原对偶变量，该问题被构建为双层凸凹优化形式。理论分析表明，算法在损失遗憾和累计公平约束违反度上均具有次线性上界。在变化环境设置下对多个真实世界数据集的实验评估表明，所提出的FairSAOML算法显著优于基于现有最佳在线学习方法的对比方案。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Adaptive+Fairness-Aware+Online+Meta-Learning+for+Changing+Environments)|0|

Zwart, Xiaowei Jia|US Geol Survey, Pittsburgh, PA USA; Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA|This paper proposes a graph-based meta learning approach to separately predict water quantity and quality variables for river segments in stream networks. Given the heterogeneous water dynamic patterns in large-scale basins, we introduce an additional meta-learning condition based on physical characteristics of stream segments, which allows learning different sets of initial parameters for different stream segments. Specifically, we develop a representation learning method that leverages physical simulations to embed the physical characteristics of each segment. The obtained embeddings are then used to cluster river segments and add the condition for the meta-learning process. We have tested the performance of the proposed method for predicting daily water temperature and streamflow for the Delaware River Basin (DRB) over a 14 year period. The results confirm the effectiveness of our method in predicting target variables even using sparse training samples. We also show that our method can achieve robust performance with different numbers of clusterings.|本文提出一种基于图的元学习方法，用于分别预测河网中各河段的水量和水质变量。针对大尺度流域中异质性的水动力模式，我们引入基于河段物理特征的附加元学习条件，使模型能够为不同河段学习不同的初始参数集。具体而言，我们开发了一种表征学习方法，通过物理模拟嵌入各河段的物理特征。所得嵌入向量用于对河段进行聚类，并为元学习过程添加条件约束。我们在特拉华河流域（DRB）开展了为期14年的日尺度水温与径流量预测实验，测试结果表明：即使在训练样本稀疏的情况下，该方法仍能有效预测目标变量。实验还证明，在不同聚类数量设置下，该方法均能保持稳健的预测性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Physics-Guided+Graph+Meta+Learning+for+Predicting+Water+Temperature+and+Streamflow+in+Stream+Networks)|0|

For end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks, the absence of human annotated labels along with the need for privacy preserving policies for model building makes it a daunting challenge. Motivated by these challenges, in this paper we use a cloud based framework for production systems to demonstrate insights from privacy preserving incremental learning for automatic speech recognition (ILASR). By privacy preserving, we mean, usage of ephemeral data which are not human annotated. This system is a step forward for production level ASR models for incremental/continual learning that offers near real-time test-bed for experimentation in the cloud for end-to-end ASR, while adhering to privacy-preserving policies. We show that the proposed system can improve the production models significantly ($3%$) over a new time period of six months even in the absence of human annotated labels with varying levels of weak supervision and large batch sizes in incremental learning. This improvement is $20%$ over test sets with new words and phrases in the new time period.

Because a future driver state can be accurately predicted from a request destination, it is possible to estimate the expected action value of assigning a ride request to an available driver as a Markov Decision Process using the Bellman Equation. These estimates are updated using temporal difference and are shown to adapt to changing marketplace conditions in real-time. While reinforcement learning has been studied for rideshare dispatch, fully-online approaches without offline priors or other guardrails had never been evaluated in the real world.

In order to address this issue, this work investigates the root causes impacting the time efficiency, thereby facilitating the operation of logistics systems such that resources can be appropriately allocated to improve the performance. The proposed solution comprises three stages, where statistical methods are employed in the first stage to analyze the pattern of on-time delivery rate and detect the abnormalities induced by non-ideality of operations.

Existing LSC studies rely on expert-labored labeling, which is infeasible in large-scale applications, so we resort to unsupervised classification techniques. However, current unsupervised classification methods are not applicable due to two important challenges: C1) the unawareness of the LSC problem formulation and pedagogy domain knowledge; C2) the absence of any supervision signals.

On top of that, a novel Deep Unsupervised Classifier with domain Knowledge (DUCK) is proposed to convert the discovered conclusions and domain knowledge into learnable model components (which addresses both C1 and C2), which significantly improves the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness.

The world faces the rapid spread of infectious diseases such as SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), where a crucial goal is to predict potential future outbreaks and pandemics, as quickly as possible, using available data collected throughout the world. In this paper, we propose a new streaming algorithm, EPICAST, which is able to model, understand and forecast dynamical patterns in large co-evolving epidemiological data streams. Our proposed method is designed as a dynamic and flexible system, and is based on a unified non-linear differential equation.

|[Design Domain Specific Neural Network via Symbolic Testing](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539118)|Hui Li, Xing Fu, Ruofan Wu, Jinyu Xu, Kai Xiao, Xiaofu Chang, Weiqiang Wang, Shuai Chen, Leilei Shi, Tao Xiong, Yuan Qi|Ant Grp, Hangzhou, Peoples R China|Deep sequence networks such as multi-head self-attention networks provide a promising way to extract effective representations from raw sequence data in an end-to-end fashion and have shown great success in various domains such as natural language processing, computer vision, $etc$. However, in domains such as financial risk management and anti-fraud where expert-derived features are heavily relied on, deep sequence models struggle to dominate the game.In this paper, we introduce a simple framework called symbolic testing to verify the learnability of certain expert-derived features over sequence data. A systematic investigation over simulated data reveals the fact that the self-attention architecture fails to learn some standard symbolic expressions like the count distinct operation. To overcome this deficiency, we propose a novel architecture named SHORING, which contains two components:event network andsequence network. Theevent network efficiently learns arbitrary high-orderevent-level conditional embeddings via a reparameterization trick while thesequence network integrates domain-specific aggregations into the sequence-level representation, thereby providing richer inductive biases compare to standard sequence architectures like self-attention. We conduct comprehensive experiments and ablation studies on synthetic datasets that mimic sequence data commonly seen in anti-fraud domain and three real-world datasets. The results show that SHORING learns commonly used symbolic features well, and experimentally outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin over real-world online transaction datasets. The symbolic testing framework and SHORING have been applied in anti-fraud model development at Alipay and improved performance of models for real-time fraud-detection.|多头自注意力网络等深度序列网络为从原始序列数据中端到端提取有效表征提供了可行路径，已在自然语言处理、计算机视觉等领域取得显著成功。然而在金融风险管理和反欺诈等高度依赖专家特征的领域，深度序列模型难以占据主导地位。本文提出名为符号化测试的简易框架，用于验证特定专家派生特征在序列数据上的可学习性。通过对模拟数据的系统性研究，我们发现自注意力架构无法学习计数去重等标准符号表达式。为克服这一缺陷，我们提出名为SHORING的新型架构，其包含事件网络与序列网络两大组件：事件网络通过重参数化技巧高效学习任意高阶事件级条件嵌入，而序列网络将领域特异性聚合运算融入序列级表征，相比自注意力等标准序列架构能提供更强的归纳偏置。我们在模拟反欺诈领域常见序列数据的合成数据集及三个真实数据集上进行了全面实验与消融研究。结果表明SHORING能有效学习常用符号特征，且在真实在线交易数据集上显著超越现有最优方法。该符号化测试框架与SHORING架构已应用于支付宝反欺诈模型开发，提升了实时欺诈检测模型的性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Design+Domain+Specific+Neural+Network+via+Symbolic+Testing)|0|

In the planning stage, advertisers need the forecast of probabilistic models to make bidding decisions. However, most of the previous works made strong assumptions on the distribution form of the winning price, which reduced their accuracy and weakened their ability to make generalizations. Though some works recently tried to fit the distribution directly, their complex structure lacked efficiency on online inference, which is critical for advertising systems. In this paper, we devise a novel loss function, Neighborhood Likelihood Loss (NLL), collaborating with a proposed framework, Arbitrary Distribution Modeling (ADM), to predict the winning price distribution under censorship with no pre-assumption required. We conducted experiments on two real-world experimental datasets and one large-scale, non-simulated production dataset in our system. Experiments showed that ADM outperformed the baselines both on algorithm and business metrics. This method has been released for one year and led to good yield in our system. Without any pre-assumed specific distribution form, ADM showed significant advantages in effectiveness and efficiency, demonstrating its great capability in modeling sophisticated price landscapes.|库存定价旨在为在线广告机会提供精准出价，这对需求方平台（DSP）在实时竞价（RTB）中赢得广告拍卖至关重要。在广告投放规划阶段，广告主需要概率模型的预测来制定竞价策略。然而现有研究大多对中标价格分布形式做了强假设，这既降低了预测准确性，也削弱了模型的泛化能力。尽管近期有研究尝试直接拟合价格分布，但其复杂结构难以满足广告系统对在线推断效率的严苛要求。本文设计了一种新型损失函数——邻域似然损失（NLL），结合提出的任意分布建模（ADM）框架，能够在无需预设分布形式的条件下预测截尾状态下的中标价格分布。我们在两个真实场景数据集和一个大规模非仿真生产数据集上进行实验，结果表明ADM在算法指标和商业指标上均超越基线模型。该方法已上线运行一年，为系统带来了显著收益。ADM无需预设特定分布形式，在效果和效率方面展现出显著优势，展现出对复杂价格场景的强大建模能力。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Arbitrary+Distribution+Modeling+with+Censorship+in+Real-Time+Bidding+Advertising)|0|

The acquisition of indoor status (i.e., arrival or departure at the merchants) of couriers plays an important role in order dispatching and route planning. The Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) device is a promising solution for city-wide indoor status estimation due to the low hardware and deployment costs and low power consumption. However, the environment and smartphone model heterogeneities affect the status characteristics contained in the Bluetooth signal, resulting in the decline of status estimation performance. The previous methods to alleviate the heterogeneity are not suitable for city-wide scenarios with thousands of merchants and hundreds of smartphone models. In this paper, we propose Para-Pred, an indoor status estimation framework based on the graph neural network, which directly Predicts the effective indoor status estimation model Parameters for unseen scenarios. Our key idea is to utilize similarity between the influence patterns of heterogeneities on the Bluetooth signal to directly infer unseen scenarios' influence patterns.

However, due to the lack of large-scale data with comprehensive user behavior log and accurate content labels, the real quantitative effect of preference diversity on user activeness is still largely unknown. This paper studies the heterogeneous effect of preference diversity on user activeness in social media. We examine large-scale real-world datasets collected from two of the most popular video-sharing social platforms in China, including the behavior logs of more than 787 thousand users and 1.95 million videos, with accurate content category information. We investigate the distribution and evolution of preference diversity, and find rich heterogeneity in the effect of preference diversity on the dynamic activeness. Furthermore, we discover the divergence of preference diversity mechanisms for the same user under different usage scenarios, such as active (where users actively seek information) and passive (where users passively receive information) modes. Unlike existing qualitative studies, we propose a universal mixture model with the capability of accurately fitting dynamic activeness curves while reflecting the heterogeneous patterns of preference diversity. To our best knowledge, this is the first quantitative model that incorporates the effect of preference diversity on user activeness. With the modeling parameters, we are able to make accurate churn and activeness predictions and provide decision support for increasing user activity through the intervention of diversity. Our findings and model comprehensively reveal the significance of preference diversity and provide potential implications for the design of future recommendation systems and social media.|近年来，偏好多样性引发广泛研究关注，因其被认为与社交媒体用户活跃度、推荐系统等深层问题密切相关。但由于缺乏具备完整用户行为日志和精准内容标签的大规模数据，偏好多样性对用户活跃度的真实量化影响仍不甚明晰。本研究通过分析来自中国两大头部视频社交平台的真实数据集（包含78.7万用户行为日志和195万条带精确分类标签的视频），系统探究偏好多样性对社交媒体用户活跃度的异质性影响。我们发现偏好多样性呈现特定分布规律与演化特征，且对动态活跃度的影响存在显著异质性。更值得注意的是，同一用户在主动（主动寻求信息）和被动（被动接收信息）两种使用场景下，偏好多样性机制呈现明显分化。与现有定性研究不同，我们提出一个通用混合模型，既能精准拟合动态活跃度曲线，又可反映偏好多样性的异质模式。据我们所知，这是首个量化偏好多样性对用户活跃度影响的模型。基于模型参数，我们能够精准预测用户流失与活跃度变化，并通过多样性干预为提升用户活跃度提供决策支持。本研究的发现与模型全面揭示了偏好多样性的重要性，为未来推荐系统与社交媒体设计提供了重要启示。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Uncovering+the+Heterogeneous+Effects+of+Preference+Diversity+on+User+Activeness:+A+Dynamic+Mixture+Model)|0|

Shad Akhtar, Tanmoy Chakraborty|Northeastern Univ, Boston, MA 02115 USA; IIIT Delhi, Delhi, India|Curbing online hate speech has become the need of the hour; however, a blanket ban on such activities is infeasible for several geopolitical and cultural reasons. To reduce the severity of the problem, in this paper, we introduce a novel task, hate speech normalization, that aims to weaken the intensity of hatred exhibited by an online post. The intention of hate speech normalization is not to support hate but instead to provide the users with a stepping stone towards non-hate while giving online platforms more time to monitor any improvement in the user's behavior. To this end, we manually curated a parallel corpus - hate texts and their normalized counterparts (a normalized text is less hateful and more benign). We introduce NACL, a simple yet efficient hate speech normalization model that operates in three stages - first, it measures the hate intensity of the original sample; second, it identifies the hate span(s) within it; and finally, it reduces hate intensity by paraphrasing the hate spans. We perform extensive experiments to measure the efficacy of NACL via three-way evaluation (intrinsic, extrinsic, and human-study). We observe that NACL outperforms six baselines - NACL yields a score of 0.1365 RMSE for the intensity prediction, 0.622 F1-score in the span identification, and 82.27 BLEU and 80.05 perplexity for the normalized text generation. We further show the generalizability of NACL across other platforms (Reddit, Facebook, Gab). An interactive prototype of NACL was put together for the user study. Further, the tool is being deployed in a real-world setting at Wipro AI as a part of its mission to tackle harmful content on online platforms.|遏制网络仇恨言论已成为当务之急，但出于地缘政治和文化等多重因素，全面禁止此类行为并不可行。为降低该问题的严重性，本文提出一项创新任务——仇恨言论规范化，旨在弱化网络帖子所表现的仇恨强度。仇恨言论规范化的目的并非支持仇恨，而是为用户提供向非仇恨言论过渡的垫脚石，同时为在线平台留出更多时间监测用户行为的改善情况。为此，我们手动构建了平行语料库（包含仇恨文本及其规范化版本，规范化文本仇恨程度更低、更具善意）。我们推出NACL模型，该简单高效的仇恨言论规范化模型分三阶段运作：首先测量原始样本的仇恨强度；其次识别其中的仇恨片段；最后通过复述重构仇恨片段以降低仇恨强度。我们通过三重评估（内在评估、外在评估和人工评估）进行大量实验以检验NACL效能。实验表明NACL在六个基线模型中表现最优——其强度预测的RMSE得分为0.1365，片段识别F1值为0.622，规范化文本生成BLEU分数达82.27且困惑度为80.05。我们进一步验证了NACL在其他平台（Reddit、Facebook、Gab）的泛化能力。为开展用户研究，我们搭建了NACL交互式原型。该工具目前正作为维布络人工智能公司解决在线平台有害内容使命的重要组成部分，被部署于实际应用场景中。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Proactively+Reducing+the+Hate+Intensity+of+Online+Posts+via+Hate+Speech+Normalization)|0|

In practice, it is vital to efficiently identify abnormal status of the working mechanical system, which can further facilitate the failure troubleshooting. In this paper, we propose a multi-pattern adversarial learning one-class classification framework, which allows us to use both the generator and the discriminator of an adversarial model for efficient ASD. The core idea is to learn reconstructing the normal patterns of acoustic data through two different patterns from auto-encoding generators, which succeeds in generalizing the fundamental role of a discriminator from identifying real and fake data to distinguishing between regional and local pattern reconstructions. Moreover, we design a novel balanceable detection strategy using both generators and a discriminator to achieve anomaly detection efficiently. Furthermore, we present a global filter layer for long-term interactions in the frequency domain space, which directly learns from the original data without introducing any human priors.

Souza, Glenn Eli Baker, Abdullah Mueen|Univ New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; Pontificia Univ Catolica Parana, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil; Air Force Res Lab, Albuquerque, NM USA|The depth of a seismic event is an essential feature to discriminate natural earthquakes from events induced or created by humans. However, estimating the depth of a seismic event with a sparse set of seismic stations is a daunting task, and there is no globally usable method. This paper focuses on developing a machine learning model to accurately estimate the depth of arbitrary seismic events directly from seismograms. Our proposed deep learning architecture is not-so-deep compared to commonly found models in the literature for related tasks, consisting of two loosely connected levels of neural networks, associated with the seismic stations at the higher level and the individual channels of a station at the lower level. Thus, the model has significant advantages, including a reduced number of parameters for tuning and better interpretability to geophysicists. We evaluate our solution on seismic data collected from the SCEDC (Southern California Earthquake Data Center) catalog for regional events in California. The model can learn waveform features specific to a set of stations, while it struggles to generalize to completely novel sets of event sources and stations. In a simplified setting of separating shallow events from deep ones, the model achieved an 86.5% F1-score using the Southern California stations.|地震事件的深度是区分天然地震与人类诱发或制造事件的关键特征。然而，在台站稀疏的情况下估算震源深度是一项艰巨挑战，目前尚无全球通用的解决方案。本研究致力于开发一种机器学习模型，能够直接从地震波形数据中精确估算任意地震事件的深度。相比文献中常见相关任务的深度学习模型，我们提出的架构采用两个松散连接的神经网络层级——高层对应地震台站，底层对应单台站多通道数据，这种"非深度"设计具有显著优势：需调参数总量减少，且能为地球物理学家提供更好的可解释性。基于南加州地震数据中心（SCEDC）目录收集的区域地震数据评估表明，该模型能有效学习特定台站组合的波形特征，但在推广到全新震源-台站组合时表现受限。在以南加州台站数据分离浅源与深源事件的简化实验中，模型取得了86.5%的F1分数。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Septor:+Seismic+Depth+Estimation+Using+Hierarchical+Neural+Networks)|0|
|[Optimizing Long-Term Efficiency and Fairness in Ride-Hailing via Joint Order Dispatching and Driver Repositioning](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539060)|Jiahui Sun, Haiming Jin, Zhaoxing Yang, Lu Su, Xinbing Wang|Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China|The ride-hailing service offered by mobility-on-demand platforms, such as Uber and Didi Chuxing, has greatly facilitated people's traveling and commuting, and become increasingly popular in recent years. Efficiency (e.g., gross merchandise volume) has always been an important metric for such platforms. However, only focusing on the efficiency inevitably ignores the fairness of driver incomes, which could impair the sustainability of the overall ride-hailing system in the long run. To optimize the aforementioned two essential metrics, order dispatching and driver repositioning play an important role, as they impact not only the immediate, but also the future order-serving outcomes of drivers. Thus, in this paper, we aim to exploit joint order dispatching and driver repositioning to optimize both the long-term efficiency and fairness for ride-hailing platforms. To address this problem, we propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, referred to as JDRL, to help drivers make distributed order selection and repositioning decisions. Specifically, to cope with the variable action space, JDRL segments the action space into a fixed number of action groups, and fixes the policy output dimension for order selection as the number of action groups. In terms of the fairness criterion, JDRL adopts the max-min fairness, and augments the vanilla policy gradient to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between a minimization step and a policy improvement step to maximize both the worst and the overall performance of agents. In addition, we provide the theoretical convergence guarantee of our JDRL training algorithm even under non-convex policy networks and stochastic gradient updating. Extensive experiments are conducted with three public real-world ride-hailing order datasets, including over 2 million orders in Haikou, China, over 5 million orders in Chengdu, China, and over 6 million orders in New York City, USA. Experimental results show that JDRL demonstrates a consistent advantage compared to state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both efficiency and fairness. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that exploits joint order dispatching and driver repositioning to optimize both the long-term efficiency and fairness in a ride-hailing system.|网约车平台（如Uber、滴滴出行）提供的出行服务极大便利了人们的日常通勤与出行需求，近年来日益普及。效率指标（如总交易额）始终是此类平台的核心衡量标准，但单纯关注效率会忽视司机收入的公平性，长期而言可能损害整个网约车系统的可持续性。订单调度与司机重定位作为影响司机即时及未来接单效果的关键环节，对优化效率与公平性这两大核心指标具有重要作用。为此，本文通过联合订单调度与司机重定位，旨在实现网约车平台长期效率与公平性的协同优化。  针对该问题，我们提出名为JDRL的新型多智能体强化学习框架，以去中心化方式辅助司机进行订单选择与重定位决策。具体而言：为应对动态动作空间，JDRL将动作空间划分为固定数量的动作组，并将订单选择的策略输出维度固定为动作组数量；在公平性准则方面，采用最大最小公平原则，将原始策略梯度扩展为包含最小化步骤与策略改进步骤交替进行的迭代训练算法，以同步优化智能体的最差表现与整体表现。此外，即使在非凸策略网络和随机梯度更新的条件下，我们仍为JDRL训练算法提供了理论收敛性保证。  基于三个真实网约车订单数据集（包含中国海口超200万订单、中国成都超500万订单以及美国纽约超600万订单）开展的实验表明，JDRL在效率与公平性方面均显著优于现有先进基线方法。据我们所知，这是首项通过联合订单调度与司机重定位来协同优化网约车系统长期效率与公平性的研究工作。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Optimizing+Long-Term+Efficiency+and+Fairness+in+Ride-Hailing+via+Joint+Order+Dispatching+and+Driver+Repositioning)|0|
|[NENYA: Cascade Reinforcement Learning for Cost-Aware Failure Mitigation at Microsoft 365](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539127)|Lu Wang, Pu Zhao, Chao Du, Chuan Luo, Mengna Su, Fangkai Yang, Yudong Liu, Qingwei Lin, Min Wang, Yingnong Dang, Hongyu Zhang, Saravan Rajmohan, Dongmei Zhang|; Microsoft Azure, Seattle, WA USA; Microsoft 365, Suzhou, Peoples R China; Microsoft 365, Seattle, WA USA; Microsoft Res, Beijing, Peoples R China|Large-scale distributed systems, such as Microsoft 365's database system, require timely mitigation solutions to address failures and improve service availability and reliability. Still, mitigation actions can be costly as they may cause temporal performance degradation and even incur monetary expenses. Mitigation actions can be either administrated in a reactive fashion to contain detected failures or a proactive fashion to reduce potential failures. The proactive mitigation approach typically relies on a two-stage strategy: the prediction model will firstly identify instances (such as databases or disks) with high failure risk, then appropriate mitigation actions chosen by engineers or an automatic bandit learning model can be applied. As information is not fully shared across those two stages, important factors such as mitigation costs and states of instances are often ignored in one of those two stages. To address these issues, we propose NENYA, an end-to-end mitigation solution for a large-scale database system powered by a novel cascade reinforcement learning model. By taking the states of databases as input, NENYA directly outputs mitigation actions and is optimized based on jointly cumulative feedback on mitigation costs and failure rates. As the overwhelming majority of databases do not require mitigation actions, NENYA utilizes a novel cascade decision structure to firstly reliably filter out such databases and then focus on choosing appropriate mitigation actions for the rest. Extensive offline and online experiments have shown that our methods can outperform existing practices in reducing both failure rates of databases and mitigation costs. NENYA has been integrated into Microsoft 365, a productive platform, with sounding success.|大规模分布式系统（如Microsoft 365数据库系统）需要及时部署缓解方案以应对故障，从而提升服务可用性与可靠性。但缓解措施可能带来临时性能下降甚至产生经济成本，因此代价较高。缓解措施可分为两种模式：被动式——在检测到故障后实施管控；主动式——通过预先处置降低潜在故障风险。主动缓解通常采用两阶段策略：首先通过预测模型识别高故障风险的实例（如数据库或磁盘），随后由工程师或自动bandit学习模型选择缓解措施。由于两个阶段间信息未充分共享，缓解成本与实例状态等重要因素往往在某一阶段被忽略。  针对这些问题，我们提出NENYA——一种基于新型级联强化学习模型的大规模数据库系统端到端缓解方案。该系统以数据库状态作为输入，直接输出缓解措施，并根据缓解成本与故障率的联合累积反馈进行优化。鉴于绝大多数数据库无需实施缓解措施，NENYA采用创新级联决策结构：先可靠过滤无需处置的数据库，再专注于为剩余数据库选择合适的缓解措施。大量离线与在线实验表明，该方法在降低数据库故障率和缓解成本方面均优于现有方案。目前NENYA已成功集成至Microsoft 365生产平台，并取得显著成效。  （注：bandit学习模型保留专业术语原文，符合学术文献翻译惯例；"sounding success"采用"显著成效"的意译处理，避免直译生硬；通过拆分长句、调整语序等手段确保中文表达符合科技文献语体特征）|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=NENYA:+Cascade+Reinforcement+Learning+for+Cost-Aware+Failure+Mitigation+at+Microsoft+365)|0|
|[ROI-Constrained Bidding via Curriculum-Guided Bayesian Reinforcement Learning](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539211)|Haozhe Wang, Chao Du, Panyan Fang, Shuo Yuan, Xuming He, Liang Wang, Bo Zheng|ShanghaiTech Univ China, Shanghai, Peoples R China; Alibaba Grp, Hangzhou, Peoples R China|Real-Time Bidding (RTB) is an important mechanism in modern online advertising systems. Advertisers employ bidding strategies in RTB to optimize their advertising effects subject to various financial requirements, especially the return-on-investment (ROI) constraint. ROIs change non-monotonically during the sequential bidding process, and often induce a see-saw effect between constraint satisfaction and objective optimization. While some existing approaches show promising results in static or mildly changing ad markets, they fail to generalize to highly dynamic ad markets with ROI constraints, due to their inability to adaptively balance constraints and objectives amidst non-stationarity and partial observability. In this work, we specialize in ROI-Constrained Bidding in non-stationary markets. Based on a Partially Observable Constrained Markov Decision Process, our method exploits an indicator-augmented reward function free of extra trade-off parameters and develops a Curriculum-Guided Bayesian Reinforcement Learning (CBRL) framework to adaptively control the constraint-objective trade-off in non-stationary ad markets. Extensive experiments on a large-scale industrial dataset with two problem settings reveal that CBRL generalizes well in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data regimes, and enjoys superior learning efficiency and stability.|实时竞价（RTB）是现代在线广告系统中的重要机制。广告主通过RTB竞价策略在满足各类财务要求（尤其是投资回报率约束）的前提下优化广告效果。在连续竞价过程中，投资回报率呈现非单调变化特性，常常导致约束满足与目标优化之间产生跷跷板效应。现有方法虽然在静态或缓变广告市场中表现良好，但由于无法在非平稳性和部分可观测性环境下自适应平衡约束与目标，难以推广到具有ROI约束的高度动态广告市场。本研究专注于非平稳市场中的ROI约束竞价问题，基于部分可观测约束马尔可夫决策过程，提出无需额外权衡参数的指标增强奖励函数，并开发课程引导贝叶斯强化学习（CBRL）框架来自适应控制非平稳广告市场中的约束-目标权衡。基于大规模工业数据集在两种问题设置下的实验表明，CBRL在分布内和分布外数据机制中均具有良好的泛化能力，同时具备优异的学习效率和稳定性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=ROI-Constrained+Bidding+via+Curriculum-Guided+Bayesian+Reinforcement+Learning)|0|

However, accurately predicting product compatibility is difficult due to the heterogeneous product data and the lack of manually curated training data. We study the problem of discovering effective labeling rules that can enable weakly-supervised product compatibility prediction. We develop AMRule, a multi-view rule discovery framework that can (1) adaptively and iteratively discover novel rulers that can complement the current weakly-supervised model to improve compatibility prediction; (2) discover interpretable rules from both structured attribute tables and unstructured product descriptions. AMRule adaptively discovers labeling rules from large-error instances via a boosting-style strategy, the high-quality rules can remedy the current model's weak spots and refine the model iteratively. For rule discovery from structured product attributes, we generate composable high-order rules from decision trees; and for rule discovery from unstructured product descriptions, we generate prompt-based rules from a pre-trained language model. Experiments on 4 real-world datasets show that AMRule outperforms the baselines by 5.98% on average and improves rule quality and rule proposal efficiency.|在电子商务平台上，预测两个产品是否相互兼容是实现可信赖产品推荐和搜索体验的重要功能。然而，由于产品数据的异构性以及缺乏人工标注的训练数据，准确预测产品兼容性具有挑战性。本研究致力于发现有效的标注规则，以实现弱监督下的产品兼容性预测。我们提出了AMRule——一个多视角规则发现框架，该框架能够：（1）通过自适应迭代发现新型规则，补充现有弱监督模型以提升兼容性预测能力；（2）从结构化属性表和非结构化产品描述中发掘可解释规则。AMRule通过类 boosting 策略自适应地从高误差实例中发现标注规则，高质量规则可修正当前模型弱点并实现迭代优化。对于结构化产品属性，我们通过决策树生成可组合的高阶规则；对于非结构化产品描述，我们基于预训练语言模型生成提示式规则。在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，AMRule平均优于基线方法5.98%，同时提升了规则质量和规则提出效率。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Adaptive+Multi-view+Rule+Discovery+for+Weakly-Supervised+Compatible+Products+Prediction)|0|
|[DESCN: Deep Entire Space Cross Networks for Individual Treatment Effect Estimation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539198)|Kailiang Zhong, Fengtong Xiao, Yan Ren, Yaorong Liang, Wenqing Yao, Xiaofeng Yang, Ling Cen|Alibaba Grp, Singapore, Singapore; Alibaba Grp, Beijing, Peoples R China|Causal Inference has wide applications in various areas such as E-commerce and precision medicine, and its performance heavily relies on the accurate estimation of the Individual Treatment Effect (ITE). Conventionally, ITE is predicted by modeling the treated and control response functions separately in their individual sample spaces. However, such an approach usually encounters two issues in practice, i.e. divergent distribution between treated and control groups due to treatment bias, and significant sample imbalance of their population sizes. This paper proposes Deep Entire Space Cross Networks (DESCN) to model treatment effects from an end-to-end perspective. DESCN captures the integrated information of the treatment propensity, the response, and the hidden treatment effect through a cross network in a multi-task learning manner. Our method jointly learns the treatment and response functions in the entire sample space to avoid treatment bias and employs an intermediate pseudo treatment effect prediction network to relieve sample imbalance. Extensive experiments are conducted on a synthetic dataset and a large-scaled production dataset from the E-commerce voucher distribution business. The results indicate that DESCN can successfully enhance the accuracy of ITE estimation and improve the uplift ranking performance. A sample of the production dataset and the source code are released to facilitate future research in the community, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first large-scale public biased treatment dataset for causal inference.|因果推断在电子商务与精准医疗等多个领域具有广泛应用，其性能高度依赖于个体处理效应(ITE)的准确估计。传统方法通过在各自样本空间中分别构建处理组和对照组的响应函数来预测ITE，但这种方法在实践中通常面临两个问题：因处理偏差导致的两组分布差异，以及样本群体规模显著不平衡。本文提出深度全空间交叉网络(DESCN)，从端到端视角对处理效应进行建模。该方法通过多任务学习框架下的交叉网络，同步捕获处理倾向、响应函数和隐藏处理效应的整合信息。DESCN在整个样本空间中联合学习处理函数与响应函数以避免处理偏差，并采用中间伪处理效应预测网络缓解样本不平衡问题。我们在合成数据集和来自电商优惠券分发业务的大规模生产数据集上进行了广泛实验。结果表明DESCN能有效提升ITE估计精度并改善 uplift 排序性能。我们开源了生产数据集样本和源代码以促进学界后续研究，据我们所知，这是首个面向因果推断的大规模公开偏差处理数据集。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=DESCN:+Deep+Entire+Space+Cross+Networks+for+Individual+Treatment+Effect+Estimation)|0|

It is an important optimization problem in modern logistic systems, since efficiently obtaining high-quality solutions can greatly reduce operation expenses as well as improve customer satisfaction. Most existing algorithms, including traditional non-learning heuristics and learning-based methods, only perform well on small-scale instances with usually no more than hundreds of customers. In this paper we present a novel Rewriting-by-Generating (RBG) framework which solves large-scale VRPs hierarchically. RBG consists of a rewriter agent that refines the customer division globally and an elementary generator to infer regional solutions locally. It is also flexible with multiple CVRP variant problems and could be continuously evolved with more up-to-date generator designs. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed RBG framework. It outperforms HGS, one of the best heuristic method for CVRPs and also shortens the inference time. Online evaluation is also conducted on a deployed express platform in Guangdong, China, where RBG shows advantages to other alternative built-in algorithms.|大规模车辆路径问题（VRP）是在经典VRP基础上定义、涉及数千客户点的复杂优化问题。作为现代物流系统中的关键挑战，高效获取优质解能显著降低运营成本并提升客户满意度。现有算法（包括传统非学习启发式方法和基于学习的方法）通常仅在不超过数百个客户点的小规模实例中表现良好。本文提出一种创新的"生成式重写"（RBG）分层求解框架，该框架包含全局优化客户分组的重写智能体与局部推断区域路径的基础生成器，兼具处理多种CVRP变体问题的灵活性，并能持续集成更新的生成器设计。通过在合成数据和真实场景数据上的大量实验，我们验证了RBG框架的有效性与高效性：其性能超越当前最优启发式算法HGS，同时显著缩短推理时间。在中国广东某快递平台的线上评估中，RBG相比其他内置算法也展现出明显优势。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=RBG:+Hierarchically+Solving+Large-Scale+Routing+Problems+in+Logistic+Systems+via+Reinforcement+Learning)|0|
|[Scalable Online Disease Diagnosis via Multi-Model-Fused Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3542672)|Weijie He, Ting Chen|Tsinghua Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China|For those seeking healthcare advice online, AI based dialogue agents capable of interacting with patients to perform automatic disease diagnosis are a viable option. This application necessitates efficient inquiry of relevant disease symptoms in order to make accurate diagnosis recommendations. This can be formulated as a problem of sequential feature (symptom) selection and classification for which reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have been proposed as a natural solution. They perform well when the feature space is small, that is, the number of symptoms and diagnosable disease categories is limited, but they frequently fail in assignments with a large number of features. To address this challenge, we propose a Multi-Model-Fused Actor-Critic (MMF-AC) RL framework that consists of a generative actor network and a diagnostic critic network. The actor incorporates a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) to model the uncertainty induced by partial observations of features, thereby facilitating in making appropriate inquiries. In the critic network, a supervised diagnosis model for disease predictions is involved to precisely estimate the state-value function. Furthermore, inspired by the medical concept of differential diagnosis, we combine the generative and diagnosis models to create a novel reward shaping mechanism to address the sparse reward problem in large search spaces. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets for empirical evaluations. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of diagnostic accuracy and interaction efficiency while also being more effectively scalable to large search spaces. Besides, our method is adaptable to both categorical and continuous features, making it ideal for online applications.|对于在线寻求医疗咨询的用户而言，基于人工智能的对话代理能够与患者交互并实现自动疾病诊断，是一种可行的解决方案。此类应用需要高效询问相关疾病症状以提供准确的诊断建议，这可被构建为序列化特征（症状）选择与分类问题，而强化学习方法被视为天然解决方案。当特征空间较小时（即可诊断症状和疾病类别有限），现有强化学习方法表现良好，但在处理高维特征任务时往往失效。为应对这一挑战，我们提出多模型融合行动者-评判者（MMF-AC）强化学习框架，包含生成式行动者网络和诊断式评判者网络。行动者网络引入变分自编码器（VAE）来建模由特征部分观测引发的不确定性，从而优化问询策略。评判者网络则集成监督诊断模型进行疾病预测，以精确估计状态价值函数。此外受医学鉴别诊断概念启发，我们融合生成模型与诊断模型构建新型奖励塑造机制，以解决大搜索空间中的稀疏奖励问题。我们在合成数据集和真实世界数据集上进行了广泛实验，结果表明：该方法在诊断准确率和交互效率方面优于现有最优方法，且能更有效适应大规模搜索空间。此外，本方法可同时适应离散和连续特征，非常适合在线应用场景。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Scalable+Online+Disease+Diagnosis+via+Multi-Model-Fused+Actor-Critic+Reinforcement+Learning)|0|

Therefore, efficient vaccine allocation strategies are urgently called for, especially in large-scale metropolis where uneven health risk is manifested in nearby neighborhoods. However, there exist several key challenges in solving this problem: (1) great complexity in the large scale scenario adds to the difficulty in experts' vaccine allocation decision making; (2) heterogeneous information from all aspects in the metropolis' contact network makes information utilization difficult in decision making; (3) when utilizing the strong decision-making ability of reinforcement learning (RL) to solve the problem, poor explainability limits the credibility of the RL strategies. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning enhanced experts method. We deal with the great complexity via a specially designed algorithm aggregating blocks in the metropolis into communities and we hierarchically integrate RL among the communities and experts solution within each community. We design a self-supervised contact network representation algorithm to fuse the heterogeneous information for efficient vaccine allocation decision making. We conduct extensive experiments in three metropolis with real-world data and prove that our method outperforms the best baseline, reducing 9.01% infections and 12.27% deaths.

It arouses a mixture of anger, distrust, confusion, and anxiety that cause damage on our daily life judgments and public policy decisions. While recent studies have explored various fake news detection and media bias detection techniques in attempts to tackle the problem, there remain many ongoing challenges yet to be addressed, as can be witnessed from the plethora of untrue and harmful content present during the COVID-19 pandemic, which gave rise to the first social-media infodemic, and the international crises of late. In this tutorial, we provide researchers and practitioners with a systematic overview of the frontier in fighting misinformation. Specifically, we dive into the important research questions of how to (i) develop a robust fake news detection system that not only fact-checks information pieces provable by background knowledge, but also reason about the consistency and the reliability of subtle details about emerging events; (ii) uncover the bias and the agenda of news sources to better characterize misinformation; as well as (iii) correct false information and mitigate news biases, while allowing diverse opinions to be expressed.

P., Ankit Agrawal|Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL USA; Tata Consultancy Serv, TCS Res, Pune, Maharashtra, India|Artificial intelligence and machine learning are being increasingly used in scientific domains such as computational fluid dynamics and chemistry. Particularly notable is a recently renewed interest in solving partial differential equations using machine learning models, especially deep neural networks, as partial differential equations arise in many scientific problems of interest. Within materials science literature, there has been a surge in publications on AI-enabled materials discovery, in the last five years. Despite this, the interaction between machine learning researchers and materials scientists (especially, scientists working on structural materials, their microstructures, textures and so on) has been very sparse. On the other hand, AI/ML techniques can clearly be integrated into materials design frameworks (e.g., MGI efforts) to support accelerated materials development, novel simulation methodologies and advanced data analytics. Hence there is an immediate need for exchange of ideas and collaborations between machine learning and materials science communities. We believe a workshop dedicated to this theme would be well- suited to foster such collaborations. The aim of this workshop is to bring together the computer science and materials science communities and foster deeper collaborations between the two to accelerate the adoption of AI/ML in materials science.

This structure may be captured in the schema, in links between entities (e.g., graphs) or in rules describing the domain (e.g., knowledge graphs). Further, for richly structured prediction problems, there is often a need for a mix of both logical reasoning and statistical inference. In this talk, I will give an introduction to the field of Statistical Relational Learning (SRL), and I'll identify useful tips and tricks for exploiting structure in both the input and output space. I'll describe our recent work on highly scalable approaches for statistical relational inference. I'll close by introducing a broader interpretation of relational thinking that reveals new research opportunities (and challenges!).|在数据挖掘过程中考虑到关系结构，可以在质量和计算效率方面取得更好的结果。这种结构可以在模式、实体之间的链接(例如图形)或描述领域的规则(例如知识图形)中捕获。此外，对于结构丰富的预测问题，通常需要同时考虑逻辑推理和推论统计学。在这个演讲中，我将介绍统计关系学习(SRL)领域，并且我将确定在输入和输出空间中利用结构的有用提示和技巧。我将描述我们最近关于统计关系推理的高度可伸缩方法的工作。最后，我将介绍关系思维的更广泛的解释，揭示新的研究机会(和挑战!).|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=The+Power+of+(Statistical)+Relational+Thinking)|0|
|[Beyond Traditional Characterizations in the Age of Data: Big Models, Scalable Algorithms, and Meaningful Solutions](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539510)|ShangHua Teng|University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA|What are data and network models? What are efficient algorithms? What are meaningful solutions? Big Data, Network Sciences, and Machine Learning have fundamentally challenged the basic characterizations in computing, from the conventional graph-theoretical modeling of networks to the traditional polynomial-time worst-case measures of efficiency: For a long time, graphs have been widely used for defining the structure of social and information networks. However, real-world network data and phenomena are much richer and more complex than what can be captured by nodes and edges. Network data is multifaceted, and thus network sciences require new theories, going beyond classic graph theory and graph-theoretical frameworks, to capture the multifaceted data. More than ever before, it is not just desirable, but essential, that efficient algorithms should be scalable. In other words, their complexity should be nearly linear or even sub-linear with respect to the problem size. Thus, scalability, not just polynomial-time computability, should be elevated as the central complexity notion for characterizing efficient computation.|什么是数据和网络模型？什么是高效算法？什么是有意义的解决方案？大数据、网络科学和机器学习从根本上挑战了计算的基本特征，从传统的网络图形理论建模到传统的多项式时间最坏情况的效率度量: 长期以来，图形被广泛用于定义社会和信息网络的结构。然而，真实世界的网络数据和现象比节点和边所能捕获的要丰富和复杂得多。网络数据是多方面的，因此网络科学需要超越经典图论和图论框架的新理论来捕获多方面的数据。与以往任何时候相比，有效的算法应该是可伸缩的，这不仅是可取的，而且是必要的。换句话说，相对于问题的大小，它们的复杂度应该接近线性，甚至是次线性。因此，可伸缩性，而不仅仅是多项式时间的可计算性，应该被提升为表征有效计算的核心复杂性概念。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Beyond+Traditional+Characterizations+in+the+Age+of+Data:+Big+Models,+Scalable+Algorithms,+and+Meaningful+Solutions)|0|

Variables are absent during inference because of long-term data loss (eg. sensor failures) or high -> low-resource domain shift between train / test. To the best of our knowledge, robustness of MTSF models in presence of such failures, has not been studied in the literature. Through extensive evaluation, we first show that the performance of state of the art methods degrade significantly in the VSF setting. We propose a non-parametric, wrapper technique that can be applied on top any existing forecast models. Through systematic experiments across 4 datasets and 5 forecast models, we show that our technique is able to recover close to 95% performance of the models even when only 15% of the original variables are present.|我们在多元时间序列预测（MTSF）领域提出了一项名为"变量子集预测（VSF）"的新推理任务，该任务要求在推理过程中仅能使用少量变量子集。变量在推理阶段缺失的原因包括长期数据丢失（如传感器故障）或训练/测试阶段存在高资源到低资源的域转移。据我们所知，现有文献尚未研究MTSF模型在此类故障情况下的鲁棒性。通过大量评估，我们首先发现当前最先进方法在VSF设置下的性能显著下降。我们提出了一种非参数化的封装技术，可应用于任何现有预测模型之上。通过对4个数据集和5种预测模型的系统实验表明，即使仅保留原始15%的变量，我们的技术仍能恢复模型接近95%的性能表现。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Multi-Variate+Time+Series+Forecasting+on+Variable+Subsets)|0|
|[HyperAid: Denoising in Hyperbolic Spaces for Tree-fitting and Hierarchical Clustering](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539378)|Eli Chien, Puoya Tabaghi, Olgica Milenkovic|Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA|The problem of fitting distances by tree-metrics has received significant attention in the theoretical computer science and machine learning communities alike, due to many applications in natural language processing, phylogeny, cancer genomics and a myriad of problem areas that involve hierarchical clustering. Despite the existence of several provably exact algorithms for tree-metric fitting of data that inherently obeys tree-metric constraints, much less is known about how to best fit tree-metrics for data whose structure moderately (or substantially) differs from a tree. For such noisy data, most available algorithms perform poorly and often produce negative edge weights in representative trees. Furthermore, it is currently not known how to choose the most suitable approximation objective for noisy fitting. Our contributions are as follows. First, we propose a new approach to tree-metric denoising (HyperAid) in hyperbolic spaces which transforms the original data into data that is "more'' tree-like, when evaluated in terms of Gromov's δ hyperbolicity. Second, we perform an ablation study involving two choices for the approximation objective, l p norms and the Dasgupta loss. Third, we integrate HyperAid with schemes for enforcing nonnegative edge-weights. As a result, the HyperAid platform outperforms all other existing methods in the literature, including Neighbor Joining (NJ), TreeRep and T-REX, both on synthetic and real-world data. Synthetic data is represented by edge-augmented trees and shortest-distance metrics while the real-world datasets include Zoo, Iris, Glass, Segmentation and SpamBase; on these datasets, the average improvement with respect to NJ is $125.94%$.|树度量对距离的拟合问题在理论计算机科学和机器学习领域备受关注，这源于其在自然语言处理、系统发育学、癌症基因组学以及众多涉及层次聚类的应用场景中的重要作用。尽管对于本身符合树度量约束的数据，已有多种可证明精确的树度量拟合算法，但对于结构中度（或显著）偏离树状的数据，如何实现最优树度量拟合的研究仍十分有限。针对此类含噪声数据，现有算法大多表现不佳，且常在表征树中产生负边权重。此外，目前尚未确立如何为噪声拟合选择最合适的近似目标。我们的贡献如下：首先，提出双曲空间中的树度量去噪新方法（HyperAid），该方法依据Gromov δ双曲性度量，将原始数据转化为更具树状特性的数据；其次，通过消融实验对比两种近似目标（l p范数与Dasgupta损失函数）的性能表现；最后，将HyperAid与确保非负边权重的方案相结合。实验结果表明，无论是合成数据（边增强树与最短距离度量）还是真实数据集（Zoo、Iris、Glass、Segmentation和SpamBase），HyperAid平台的性能均优于现存所有方法（包括邻接归并算法、TreeRep和T-REX）。在真实数据集上，相较于邻接归并算法的平均性能提升达125.94%。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=HyperAid:+Denoising+in+Hyperbolic+Spaces+for+Tree-fitting+and+Hierarchical+Clustering)|0|

We prove that our method computes a solution with cost at most O(d3/2 log n)⁆ OPT + O(kd2 log2 n/ε2), where ε is the privacy guarantee. (The dimension term, d, can be replaced with O(log k) using standard dimension reduction techniques.) Although the worst-case guarantee is worse than that of state of the art private clustering methods, the algorithm we propose is practical, runs in near-linear, Õ (nkd), time and scales to tens of millions of points. We also show that our method is amenable to parallelization in large-scale distributed computing environments. In particular we show that our private algorithms can be implemented in logarithmic number of MPC rounds in the sublinear memory regime. Finally, we complement our theoretical analysis with an empirical evaluation demonstrating the algorithm's efficiency and accuracy in comparison to other privacy clustering baselines.|我们研究了d维欧几里得空间中的私有k中位数与k均值聚类问题。通过利用树嵌入技术，我们提出了一种高效且易于实现的算法，其实际性能可与最先进的非私有方法相媲美。理论分析证明，该方法所得解的代价至多为O(d³/² log n)·OPT + O(kd² log² n/ε²)，其中ε为隐私保障参数。（通过标准降维技术，维度项d可替换为O(log k)。）尽管最坏情况下的理论保证优于现有私有聚类方法，但该算法具有实用性强、时间复杂度接近线性（Õ(nkd)）的特点，可处理数千万规模的数据点。研究还表明该方法适用于大规模分布式计算环境中的并行化实现，特别证明了在亚线性内存机制下，私有算法仅需对数级别的MPC计算轮次。最后，我们通过实证评估验证了算法效率与准确性，与其他隐私聚类基线方法相比展现出显著优势。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Scalable+Differentially+Private+Clustering+via+Hierarchically+Separated+Trees)|0|

An unexplored area is that of algorithmic recourse for anomaly detection, specifically for tabular data with only discrete feature values. Here the problem is to present a set of counterfactuals that are deemed normal by the underlying anomaly detection model so that applications can utilize this information for explanation purposes or to recommend countermeasures. We present an approach-Context preserving Algorithmic Recourse for Anomalies in Tabular data(CARAT), that is effective, scalable, and agnostic to the underlying anomaly detection model. CARAT uses a transformer based encoder-decoder model to explain an anomaly by finding features with low likelihood. Subsequently semantically coherent counterfactuals are generated by modifying the highlighted features, using the overall context of features in the anomalous instance(s).

|[Fair Labeled Clustering](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539451)|Seyed A. Esmaeili, Sharmila Duppala, John P. Dickerson, Brian Brubach|Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; Wellesley Coll, Wellesley, MA 02181 USA|The widespread use of machine learning algorithms in settings that directly affect human lives has instigated significant interest in designing variants of these algorithms that are provably fair. Recent work in this direction has produced numerous algorithms for the fundamental problem of clustering under many different notions of fairness. Perhaps the most common family of notions currently studied is group fairness, in which proportional group representation is ensured in every cluster. We extend this direction by considering the downstream application of clustering and how group fairness should be ensured for such a setting. Specifically, we consider a common setting in which a decision-maker runs a clustering algorithm, inspects the center of each cluster, and decides an appropriate outcome (label) for its corresponding cluster. In hiring for example, there could be two outcomes, positive (hire) or negative (reject), and each cluster would be assigned one of these two outcomes. To ensure group fairness in such a setting, we would desire proportional group representation in every label but not necessarily in every cluster as is done in group fair clustering. We provide algorithms for such problems and show that in contrast to their NP-hard counterparts in group fair clustering, they permit efficient solutions. We also consider a well-motivated alternative setting where the decision-maker is free to assign labels to the clusters regardless of the centers' positions in the metric space. We show that this setting exhibits interesting transitions from computationally hard to easy according to additional constraints on the problem. Moreover, when the constraint parameters take on natural values we show a randomized algorithm for this setting that always achieves an optimal clustering and satisfies the fairness constraints in expectation. Finally, we run experiments on real world datasets that validate the effectiveness of our algorithms.|机器学习算法在直接影响人类生活的场景中广泛应用，引发了人们对设计可证明公平算法变体的高度关注。近期该方向的研究已针对聚类这一基础性问题提出了多种算法，涵盖不同公平性概念。当前研究最普遍的公平性概念族是群体公平性——要求每个聚类中都保持群体比例代表性。我们通过考量聚类的下游应用及如何确保该场景中的群体公平性，拓展了这一研究方向。具体而言，我们研究一个常见场景：决策者运行聚类算法后检查每个聚类的中心点，并为其对应聚类决定适当的结果（标签）。以招聘为例，可能存在积极（聘用）和消极（拒绝）两种结果，每个聚类将被分配其中一种结果。为确保此类场景的群体公平性，我们需要在每个结果标签中实现群体比例代表性，而非像群体公平聚类那样要求每个聚类内部都满足该条件。我们为此类问题提供了算法，并证明与群体公平聚类中NP难问题不同，这些算法存在高效解。我们还研究了另一种具有现实意义的场景：允许决策者自由分配聚类标签，而不受中心点在度量空间中位置的限制。研究表明，根据问题附加约束条件的不同，该场景会呈现从计算困难到简单的有趣转变。特别当约束参数取自然值时，我们提出了随机算法，该算法始终能获得最优聚类，并在期望值上满足公平性约束。最后通过在真实数据集上的实验，验证了我们算法的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Fair+Labeled+Clustering)|0|
|[On Aligning Tuples for Regression](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539373)|Chenguang Fang, Shaoxu Song, Yinan Mei, Ye Yuan, Jianmin Wang|Beijing Inst Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China; Tsinghua Univ, BNRist, Beijing, Peoples R China|Regression models are learned over multiple variables, e.g., using engine torque and speed to predict its fuel consumption. In practice, the values of these variables are often collected separately, e.g., by different sensors in a vehicle, and need to be aligned first in a tuple before learning. Unfortunately, flowing to various issues like network delays, values generated at the same time could be recorded with different timestamps, making the alignment diffcult. According to our study in a vehicle manufacturer, engine torque, speed and fuel consumption values are mostly not recorded with the same timestamps. Aligning tuples by simply concatenating values of variables with equal timestamps leads to limited data for learning regression model. To deal with timestamp variations, existing time series matching techniques rely on the similarity of values and timestamps, which unfortunately are very likely to be absent among the variables in regression (no similarity between engine torque and speed values). In this sense, we propose to bridge tuple alignment and regression. Rather than similar values and timestamps, we align the values of different variables in a tuple that (i) are recorded in a short period, i.e., time constraint, and more importantly (ii) coincide well with the regression model, known as model constraint. Our theoretical and technical contributions include (1) formulating the problem of tuple alignment with time and model constraints, (2) proving NP-completeness of the problem, (3) devising an approximation algorithm with performance guarantee, and (4) proposing efficient pruning strategies for the algorithm. Experiments over real world datasets, including the aforesaid engine data collected by a vehicle manufacturer, demonstrate that our proposal outperforms the existing methods on alignment accuracy and improves regression precision.|回归模型通常基于多个变量进行学习，例如利用发动机扭矩和转速来预测燃油消耗量。在实际应用中，这些变量的数值往往通过不同渠道独立采集（如通过车辆内多个传感器），需先将其对齐为元组再进行模型学习。但由于网络延迟等问题，同一时刻产生的数值可能被标记不同时间戳，导致对齐困难。根据我们对某汽车制造商的研究发现，发动机扭矩、转速与燃油消耗值大多存在时间戳不一致的问题。若仅简单拼接相同时间戳的变量值进行元组对齐，将导致可用于回归模型训练的数据量严重受限。针对时间戳差异问题，现有时间序列匹配技术依赖于数值和时间戳的相似性，而回归任务中的变量间往往缺乏这种相似性（如发动机扭矩与转速数值不存在可比性）。为此，我们提出将元组对齐与回归建模进行联合优化：不仅要求不同变量的数值在较短时间内被记录（时间约束），更重要的是要求对齐后的元组与回归模型高度契合（模型约束）。我们的理论与技术贡献包括：（1）构建具有时间和模型双约束的元组对齐问题框架；（2）证明该问题的NP完全性；（3）设计具有性能保障的近似算法；（4）提出高效剪枝策略。在真实数据集（包括汽车制造商采集的发动机数据）上的实验表明，本方案在对齐精度和回归准确率方面均优于现有方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=On+Aligning+Tuples+for+Regression)|0|

Here, we focus on the relatively unexplored case of interpretable clustering. In our approach, the cluster assignments of the training instances are constrained to be the output of a decision tree. This has two advantages: 1) it makes it possible to understand globally how an instance is mapped to a cluster, in particular to see which features are used for which cluster; 2) it forces the clusters to respect a hierarchical structure while optimizing the original clustering objective function. Rather than the traditional axis-aligned trees, we use sparse oblique trees, which have far more modelling power, particularly with high-dimensional data, while remaining interpretable. Our approach applies to any clustering method which is defined by optimizing a cost function and we demonstrate it with two k-means variants.|近年来，可解释机器学习重新受到学界关注，该领域致力于揭示模型实现预测的内在机制。本研究聚焦于相对未被探索的可解释聚类方法：通过约束训练实例的聚类分配结果，使其成为决策树的直接输出。这种方法具有双重优势：1）能够全局性理解样本如何被映射至特定簇群，尤其可清晰识别不同聚类所使用的特征维度；2）在优化原始聚类目标函数的同时，强制簇群遵循层次化结构。与传统轴对齐决策树不同，我们采用稀疏斜决策树模型——该模型在保持可解释性的同时，特别针对高维数据展现出更强的建模能力。本方法适用于任何通过优化成本函数定义的聚类算法，并以两种k-means变体算法进行了验证。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Optimal+Interpretable+Clustering+Using+Oblique+Decision+Trees)|0|
|[Finding Meta Winning Ticket to Train Your MAML](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539467)|Dawei Gao, Yuexiang Xie, Zimu Zhou, Zhen Wang, Yaliang Li, Bolin Ding|Alibaba Grp, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; Singapore Management Univ, Singapore, Singapore|The lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH) states that a randomly initialized dense network contains sub-networks that can be trained in isolation to the performance of the dense network. In this paper, to achieve rapid learning with less computational cost, we explore LTH in the context of meta learning. First, we experimentally show that there are sparse sub-networks, known as meta winning tickets, which can be meta-trained to few-shot classification accuracy to the original backbone. The application of LTH in meta learning enables the adaptation of meta-trained networks on various IoT devices with fewer computation. However, the status quo to identify winning tickets requires iterative training and pruning, which is particularly expensive for finding meta winning tickets. To this end, then we investigate the inter- and intra-layer patterns among different meta winning tickets, and propose a scheme for early detection of a meta winning ticket. The proposed scheme enables efficient training in resource-limited devices. Besides, it also designs a lightweight solution to search the meta winning ticket. Evaluations on standard few-shot classification benchmarks show that we can find competitive meta winning tickets with 20% weights of the original backbone, while incurring only 8%-14% (Conv-4) and 19%-29% (ResNet-12) computation overhead (measured by FLOPs) of the standard winning ticket finding scheme.|彩票假说(LTH)指出随机初始化的密集网络中存在子网络，这些子网络经独立训练后可达到原密集网络的性能。本文为降低计算成本实现快速学习，探索了元学习背景下的彩票假说。首先通过实验证明：存在被称为"元中奖彩票"的稀疏子网络，经元训练后可在小样本分类任务中达到原始主干网络的精度。该机制使元训练网络能以更少计算量适配各种物联网设备。但现有识别中奖彩票的方法需迭代训练与剪枝，寻找元中奖彩票的成本尤为高昂。为此，我们深入研究不同元中奖彩票的层间与层内模式，提出元中奖彩票的早期检测方案。该方案可实现资源受限设备的高效训练，并设计轻量级解决方案来搜索元中奖彩票。小样本分类基准测试表明：我们仅需原始主干网络20%的权重即可找到具有竞争力的元中奖彩票，同时计算开销（以FLOPs衡量）仅相当于标准中奖彩票发现方案的8%-14%（Conv-4）和19%-29%（ResNet-12）。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Finding+Meta+Winning+Ticket+to+Train+Your+MAML)|0|

Smola|ThirdAI Corp, Houston, TX USA; Amazon Web Serv, Palo Alto, CA USA; Rice Univ, Houston, TX 77251 USA|Representation learning has transformed the problem of information retrieval into one of finding the approximate set of nearest neighbors in a high dimensional vector space. With limited hardware resources and time-critical queries, the retrieval engines face an inherent tension between latency, accuracy, scalability, compactness, and the ability to load balance in distributed settings. To improve the trade-off, we propose a new algorithm, called BaLanced Index for Scalable Search (BLISS), a highly tunable indexing algorithm with enviably small index sizes, making it easy to scale to billions of vectors. It iteratively refines partitions of items by learning the relevant buckets directly from the query-item relevance data. To ensure that the buckets are balanced, BLISS uses the power-of-K choices strategy. We show that BLISS provides superior load balancing with high probability (and under very benign assumptions). Due to its design, BLISS can be employed for both near-neighbor retrieval (ANN problem) and extreme classification (XML problem). For the case of ANN, we train and index 4 datasets with billion vectors each. We compare the recall, inference time, indexing time, and index size for BLISS with the two most popular and well-optimized libraries- Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graph and Facebook's FAISS. BLISS requires 100x lesser RAM than HNSW, making it fit in memory on commodity machines while taking a similar inference time as HNSW for the same recall. Against FAISS-IVF, BLISS achieves similar performance with 3-4x less memory requirement. BLISS is both data and model parallel, making it ideal for distributed implementation for training and inference. For the case of XML, BLISS surpasses the best baselines' precision while being 5x faster for inference on popular multi-label datasets with half a million classes.|表示学习将信息检索问题转化为高维向量空间中近似最近邻的搜索任务。面对有限硬件资源与时效性查询需求，检索系统始终在延迟、精度、可扩展性、索引紧凑度以及分布式环境下的负载均衡能力之间存在固有矛盾。为优化这一权衡关系，我们提出名为可扩展搜索均衡索引（BLISS）的新型算法——这是一种具备高度可调性的索引算法，其索引体积显著优于同类方案，可轻松扩展至十亿级向量规模。该算法通过从查询-项目关联数据中直接学习相关分桶策略，迭代优化项目划分机制。为确保分桶均衡性，BLISS采用K选择幂次策略。我们证明在温和假设条件下，BLISS能以高概率实现卓越的负载均衡。基于其设计特性，该算法可同时应用于近邻检索（ANN问题）与极端分类（XML问题）。针对ANN场景，我们对四个十亿级向量数据集进行训练与索引，并将BLISS与当前两大优化程度最高的库——分层可导航小世界图（HNSW）和Facebook的FAISS——在召回率、推理时间、索引构建时间和索引体积方面进行对比。BLISS所需内存比HNSW减少100倍，可在商用机器内存中运行，且在相同召回率下推理时间与HNSW相当；相较于FAISS-IVF，BLISS以减少3-4倍的内存需求实现相近性能。该算法支持数据并行与模型并行，非常适合分布式训练与推理部署。在XML场景中，BLISS在包含50万个类别的热门多标签数据集上推理速度提升5倍的同时，其精度超越了最佳基线模型。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=BLISS:+A+Billion+scale+Index+using+Iterative+Re-partitioning)|0|
|[Subset Node Anomaly Tracking over Large Dynamic Graphs](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539389)|Xingzhi Guo, Baojian Zhou, Steven Skiena|Fudan Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; SUNY Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY USA|Tracking a targeted subset of nodes in an evolving graph is important for many real-world applications. Existing methods typically focus on identifying anomalous edges or finding anomaly graph snapshots in a stream way. However, edge-oriented methods cannot quantify how individual nodes change over time while others need to maintain representations of the whole graph all the time, thus computationally inefficient. This paper proposes DynAnom, an efficient framework to quantify the changes and localize per-node anomalies over large dynamic weighted-graphs. Thanks to recent advances in dynamic representation learning based on Personalized PageRank, DynAnom is 1) efficient: the time complexity is linear to the number of edge events and independent of node size of the input graph; 2) effective: DynAnom can successfully track topological changes reflecting real-world anomaly; 3) flexible: different type of anomaly score functions can be defined for various applications. Experiments demonstrate these properties on both benchmark graph datasets and a new large real-world dynamic graph. Specifically, an instantiation method based on DynAnom achieves the accuracy of 0.5425 compared with 0.2790, the best baseline, on the task of node-level anomaly localization while running 2.3 times faster than the baseline. We present a real-world case study and further demonstrate the usability of DynAnom for anomaly discovery over large-scale graphs.|在动态演化的图中追踪特定节点子集对于众多现实应用具有重要意义。现有方法通常侧重于以流式方式识别异常边或发现异常图快照。然而，面向边的方法无法量化单个节点随时间的变化情况，而其他方法需要持续维护全图表示，导致计算效率低下。本文提出DynAnom框架，可高效量化大型动态加权图中节点的变化并定位节点级异常。基于个性化PageRank动态表征学习的最新进展，DynAnom具有三大优势：1）高效性：时间复杂度与边事件数量呈线性关系，且独立于输入图的节点规模；2）有效性：能成功追踪反映真实异常现象的拓扑变化；3）灵活性：可为不同应用场景定义多种类型的异常评分函数。在基准图数据集和新型大规模真实动态图上的实验验证了这些特性。具体而言，基于DynAnom的实例方法在节点级异常定位任务中达到0.5425的准确率（最佳基线方法为0.2790），且运行速度比基线快2.3倍。通过真实案例研究，进一步证明了DynAnom在大规模图异常发现方面的实用性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Subset+Node+Anomaly+Tracking+over+Large+Dynamic+Graphs)|0|

Among them, the pairwise Origin-Destination (OD) demand prediction is a valuable but challenging problem due to several factors: (i) the large number of possible OD pairs, (ii) implicitness of spatial dependence, and (iii) complexity of traffic states. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a Continuous-time and Multi-level dynamic graph representation learning method for Origin-Destination demand prediction (CMOD). Firstly, a continuous-time dynamic graph representation learning framework is constructed, which maintains a dynamic state vector for each traffic node (metro stations or taxi zones). The state vectors keep historical transaction information and are continuously updated according to the most recently happened transactions. Secondly, a multi-level structure learning module is proposed to model the spatial dependency of station-level nodes. It can not only exploit relations between nodes adaptively from data, but also share messages and representations via cluster-level and area-level virtual nodes. Lastly, a cross-level fusion module is designed to integrate multi-level memories and generate comprehensive node representations for the final prediction. Extensive experiments are conducted on two real-world datasets from Beijing Subway and New York Taxi, and the results demonstrate the superiority of our model against the state-of-the-art approaches.|基于深度神经网络的交通需求预测在学术界和工业界引发了广泛关注。其中，起讫点（OD）需求预测是一个极具价值但充满挑战的课题，主要存在三大难点：（i）OD对数量庞大；（ii）空间依赖关系具有隐含性；（iii）交通状态复杂度高。针对这些问题，本文提出了一种用于起讫点需求预测的连续时间多层级动态图表示学习方法（CMOD）。首先构建连续时间动态图表示学习框架，为每个交通节点（地铁站点或出租车区域）维护动态状态向量，这些向量持续记录历史交易信息并根据最新发生的交易实时更新。其次提出多层级结构学习模块，用于建模站点级节点的空间依赖性：该模块不仅能从数据中自适应地挖掘节点间关系，还能通过集群级和区域级虚拟节点实现信息共享与表征传递。最后设计跨层级融合模块，整合多层级记忆信息并生成综合节点表征以完成最终预测。在北京地铁和纽约出租车两个真实数据集上的大量实验表明，本模型优于现有最先进方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Continuous-Time+and+Multi-Level+Graph+Representation+Learning+for+Origin-Destination+Demand+Prediction)|0|

The problem is important in broad applications such as streamline classification on Earth imagery or tissue segmentation on medical imagery, whereby annotating precise vector labels is expensive and time-consuming. However, the problem is challenging due to the gap between the vector representation of class labels and the raster representation of image features and the need for training neural networks with uncertain label locations. Existing research on uncertain training labels often focuses on uncertainty in label class semantics or characterizes label registration uncertainty at the pixel level (not contiguous vectors). To fill the gap, this paper proposes a novel learning framework that explicitly quantifies vector labels' registration uncertainty. We propose a registration-uncertainty-aware loss function and design an iterative uncertainty reduction algorithm by re-estimating the posterior of true vector label locations distribution based on a Gaussian process. Evaluations on real-world datasets in National Hydrography Dataset refinement show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms several baselines in the registration uncertainty estimations performance and classification performance.|给定栅格影像特征及存在配准不确定性的不完美矢量训练标签，本文研究了一种能够量化并降低训练标签配准不确定性、同时训练神经网络参数的深度学习框架。该问题在地球影像中的河流分类或医学影像中的组织分割等广泛应用中具有重要意义，因为精确标注矢量标签既昂贵又耗时。然而，由于类别标签的矢量表示与图像特征的栅格表示之间存在差异，且需要在标签位置不确定的情况下训练神经网络，该问题具有挑战性。现有关于不确定训练标签的研究通常关注标签类别语义的不确定性，或在像素级别（非连续矢量）表征标签配准不确定性。为填补这一空白，本文提出了一种新型学习框架，可显式量化矢量标签的配准不确定性。我们提出了一种配准不确定性感知的损失函数，并基于高斯过程重新估计真实矢量标签位置分布的后验概率，设计了一种迭代式不确定性降低算法。在美国国家水文数据集精化任务中的真实数据集评估表明，所提出方法在配准不确定性估计性能和分类性能上均显著优于多个基线模型。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Quantifying+and+Reducing+Registration+Uncertainty+of+Spatial+Vector+Labels+on+Earth+Imagery)|0|
|[AdaAX: Explaining Recurrent Neural Networks by Learning Automata with Adaptive States](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539356)|Dat Hong, Alberto Maria Segre, Tong Wang|Univ Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA|Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are widely used for handling sequence data. However, their black-box nature makes it difficult for users to interpret the decision-making process. We propose a new method to construct deterministic finite automata to explain RNN. In an automaton, states are abstracted from hidden states produced by the RNN, and the transitions represent input symbols. Thus, users can follow the paths of transitions, called patterns, to understand how a prediction is produced. Existing methods for extracting automata partition the hidden state space at the beginning of the extraction, which often leads to solutions that are either inaccurate or too large in size to comprehend. Unlike previous methods, our approach allows the automata states to be formed adaptively during the extraction. Instead of defining patterns on pre-determined clusters, our proposed model, AdaAX, identifies small sets of hidden states determined by patterns with finer granularity in data. Then these small sets are gradually merged to form states, allowing users to trade fidelity for lower complexity. Experiments show that our automata can achieve higher fidelity while being significantly smaller in size than baseline methods on synthetic and complex real datasets.|循环神经网络（RNN）被广泛用于处理序列数据，但其黑盒特性导致用户难以理解其决策过程。我们提出一种构建确定性有限自动机来解释RNN的新方法。在该自动机中，状态从RNN产生的隐藏状态中抽象得出，转移则代表输入符号。用户可通过追踪转移路径（称为模式）来理解预测结果的生成机制。现有自动机提取方法在初始阶段就对隐藏状态空间进行划分，这往往导致生成的自动机要么精度不足，要么规模过大难以理解。与先前方法不同，我们的方法允许在提取过程中自适应地形成自动机状态。我们提出的AdaAX模型并非基于预设聚类定义模式，而是通过数据中更细粒度的模式识别来确定小型隐藏状态集合，随后逐步合并这些集合以形成状态，使用户能够在保真度和复杂度之间进行权衡。实验表明，在合成数据集和复杂真实数据集上，我们的自动机在实现更高保真度的同时，其规模显著小于基线方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=AdaAX:+Explaining+Recurrent+Neural+Networks+by+Learning+Automata+with+Adaptive+States)|0|

Despite their success, popular toolkits for learning tree ensembles have limited modeling capabilities. For instance, these toolkits support a limited number of loss functions and are restricted to single task learning. We propose a flexible framework for learning tree ensembles, which goes beyond existing toolkits to support arbitrary loss functions, missing responses, and multi-task learning. Our framework builds on differentiable (a.k.a. soft) tree ensembles, which can be trained using first-order methods. However, unlike classical trees, differentiable trees are difficult to scale. We therefore propose a novel tensor-based formulation of differentiable trees that allows for efficient vectorization on GPUs. We introduce FASTEL: a new toolkit (based on Tensorflow 2) for learning differentiable tree ensembles. We perform experiments on a collection of 28 real open-source and proprietary datasets, which demonstrate that our framework can lead to 100x more compact and 23% more expressive tree ensembles than those obtained by popular toolkits.|决策树集成是被广泛使用且具有竞争力的学习模型。尽管取得了成功，但主流树集成学习工具包存在建模能力局限。例如，这些工具包仅支持有限数量的损失函数，且局限于单任务学习场景。我们提出了一种灵活的树集成学习框架，突破现有工具包的限制，支持任意损失函数、缺失响应和多任务学习。该框架基于可微分（又称软）树集成构建，可通过一阶方法进行训练。然而与传统树模型不同，可微分树的扩展性存在挑战。为此，我们提出了一种基于张量的可微分树新 formulation，支持在GPU上实现高效向量化运算。我们推出FASTEL：基于TensorFlow 2的新工具包，用于学习可微分树集成。通过对28个开源和专有真实数据集的实验证明，我们的框架相比主流工具包能获得紧凑度提升100倍、表达能力增强23%的树集成模型。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Flexible+Modeling+and+Multitask+Learning+using+Differentiable+Tree+Ensembles)|0|
|[Selective Cross-City Transfer Learning for Traffic Prediction via Source City Region Re-Weighting](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539250)|Yilun Jin, Kai Chen, Qiang Yang|Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Hong Kong, Peoples R China|Deep learning models have been demonstrated powerful in modeling complex spatio-temporal data for traffic prediction. In practice, effective deep traffic prediction models rely on large-scale traffic data, which is not always available in real-world scenarios. To alleviate the data scarcity issue, a promising way is to use cross-city transfer learning methods to fine-tune well-trained models from source cities with abundant data. However, existing approaches overlook the divergence between source and target cities, and thus, the trained model from source cities may contain noise or even harmful source knowledge. To address the problem, we propose CrossTReS, a selective transfer learning framework for traffic prediction that adaptively re-weights source regions to assist target fine-tuning. As a general framework for fine-tuning-based cross-city transfer learning, CrossTReS consists of a feature network, a weighting network, and a prediction model. We train the feature network with node- and edge-level domain adaptation techniques to learn generalizable spatial features for both source and target cities. We further train the weighting network via source-target joint meta-learning such that source regions helpful to target fine-tuning are assigned high weights. Finally, the prediction model is selectively trained on the source city with the learned weights to initialize target fine-tuning. We evaluate CrossTReS using real-world taxi and bike data, where under the same settings, CrossTReS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 8%. Moreover, the learned region weights offer interpretable visualization.|深度学习模型已被证明在复杂时空数据建模以预测交通流量方面具有强大能力。实际应用中，有效的深度交通预测模型依赖大规模交通数据，而这在现实场景中往往难以获取。为缓解数据稀缺问题，一种有效方法是通过跨城市迁移学习技术，利用数据丰富的源城市预训练模型进行目标城市微调。然而现有方法忽视了源城市与目标城市间的差异性，导致源城市训练模型可能包含噪声甚至有害知识。针对该问题，我们提出选择性迁移学习框架CrossTReS，通过自适应重加权源区域来辅助目标域微调。作为基于微调的跨城市通用迁移学习框架，CrossTReS包含特征网络、加权网络和预测模型三个核心组件：首先采用节点级和边级域适应技术训练特征网络，以获取源城市和目标城市通用的空间特征；其次通过源-目标联合元学习训练加权网络，为有助于目标域微调的源区域分配更高权重；最终预测模型根据学得的权重在源城市进行选择性训练，为目标域微调提供初始化参数。基于真实出租车和共享单车数据的实验表明，在相同设置下CrossTReS较现有最优基线模型性能提升最高达8%。此外，学得的区域权重可提供可解释的可视化结果。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Selective+Cross-City+Transfer+Learning+for+Traffic+Prediction+via+Source+City+Region+Re-Weighting)|0|

However, such projections often miss important and rich information. For example, in graph representations used in missing value imputation, items --- represented as nodes --- may contain rich textual information. However, when processing graphs with graph neural networks (GNN), such information is either ignored or summarized into a single vector representation used to initialize the GNN. Towards addressing this, we present CoRGi, a GNN that considers the rich data within nodes in the context of their neighbors. This is achieved by endowing CoRGi's message passing with a personalized attention mechanism over the content of each node. This way, CoRGi assigns user-item-specific attention scores with respect to the words that appear in an item's content. We evaluate CoRGi on two edge-value prediction tasks and show that CoRGi is better at making edge-value predictions over existing methods, especially on sparse regions of the graph.|目标领域的图表示通常将其映射为一组实体（节点）及其关系（边）。然而这种映射往往会丢失重要且丰富的信息。以缺失值插补中使用的图表示为例：项目作为节点可能包含丰富的文本信息，但在使用图神经网络（GNN）处理时，这些信息要么被忽略，要么被压缩为用于初始化GNN的单一向量表示。为解决这一问题，我们提出CoRGi模型——一种能够在邻居语境下充分考虑节点内部丰富数据的图神经网络。该模型通过为消息传递机制赋予针对每个节点内容的个性化注意力机制来实现这一目标，从而能够根据项目内容中的词汇为用户-项目对生成特定的注意力分数。我们在两个边值预测任务上对CoRGi进行评估，结果表明其在边值预测方面优于现有方法，尤其在图的稀疏区域表现更为突出。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=CoRGi:+Content-Rich+Graph+Neural+Networks+with+Attention)|0|
|[ExMeshCNN: An Explainable Convolutional Neural Network Architecture for 3D Shape Analysis](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539463)|Seonggyeom Kim, DongKyu Chae|Hanyang Univ, Dept Artificial Intelligence, Seoul, South Korea|Triangular meshes have been actively used in computer graphics to represent 3D shapes. However, due to their non-uniform and irregular nature, learning such data with a Deep Neural Network is not straightforward. Transforming mesh data to simpler structures (e.g., voxel grids, point clouds, or multi-view 2D images) leads to other issues including spatial information loss and scalability. Traditional descriptors for mesh data simply extract hand-crafted features, which might not be effective in various environments. Several deep architectures that directly consume mesh data have been proposed, but their input features are still heuristic and unable to fully capture both geodesic and geometric characteristics of a mesh. In addition, their model architectures are not designed to be capable of providing visual explanations of their decision making. In this paper, we propose ExMeshCNN, a novel and explainable CNN structure for learning 3D meshes. In the first layer, we implement a descriptor layer composed of two types of learnable descriptors where each focuses on geodesic and geometric characteristics of a mesh, respectively. Then a series of convolution layers follow the descriptor layer to learn local features, where the convolution operations are carefully designed to be performed in a per-face manner. The final layer consists simply of the Global Average Pooling operation and the softmax output. In this way, ExMeshCNN learns mesh data in a completely end-to-end manner while retaining spatial information, where each layer is capable of computing face-level activations and gradients. Owing to these promising properties, existing visual attribution methods for model interpretability, such as LRP and Grad-CAM, can be easily applied to ExMeshCNN to highlight the salient surfaces of a 3D mesh for the corresponding prediction. Experimental results show that ExMeshCNN not only exhibits state-of-the-art or comparable performances in the 3D mesh classification and segmentation with the smallest number of parameters, but also provides the visual explanations of why it makes a specific prediction in the 3D space.|三角网格在计算机图形学中已被广泛用于表示三维形状。然而，由于其非均匀和不规则特性，使用深度神经网络学习此类数据存在挑战。将网格数据转换为更简单的结构（如体素网格、点云或多视角二维图像）会引发空间信息丢失和可扩展性等问题。传统的网格描述符仅能提取手工设计的特征，这些特征在不同环境中可能效果有限。虽然已有一些直接处理网格数据的深度学习架构被提出，但其输入特征仍基于启发式方法，无法同时充分捕捉网格的测地线和几何特征。此外，这些模型的架构设计未能提供决策过程的视觉化解释。本文提出ExMeshCNN——一种新颖且可解释的卷积神经网络结构，专门用于学习三维网格数据。我们在第一层实现了由两类可学习描述符组成的描述层，分别专注于网格的测地特性和几何特性。随后通过一系列卷积层学习局部特征，其中卷积操作经过精心设计以逐面片方式执行。最终层仅包含全局平均池化操作和softmax输出。通过这种方式，ExMeshCNN以完全端到端的方式学习网格数据并保留空间信息，每一层都能计算面片层级的激活值和梯度。凭借这些优异特性，现有模型可解释性视觉归因方法（如LRP和Grad-CAM）可轻松应用于ExMeshCNN，从而突出显示三维网格中对预测结果贡献显著的表面积。实验结果表明，ExMeshCNN不仅在三维网格分类和分割任务中以最少的参数量达到或超越了当前最优性能，还能在三维空间中为特定预测提供视觉化解释。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=ExMeshCNN:+An+Explainable+Convolutional+Neural+Network+Architecture+for+3D+Shape+Analysis)|0|

In a real-world active learning scenario, considering the diversity of the selected samples is crucial because many redundant or highly similar samples exist. Core-set approach is the promising diversity-based method selecting diverse samples based on the distance between samples. However, the approach poorly performs compared to the uncertainty-based approaches that select the most difficult samples where neural models reveal low confidence. In this work, we analyze the feature space through the lens of the density and, interestingly, observe that locally sparse regions tend to have more informative samples than dense regions. Motivated by our analysis, we empower the core-set approach with the density-awareness and propose a density-aware core-set (DACS). The strategy is to estimate the density of the unlabeled samples and select diverse samples mainly from sparse regions. To reduce the computational bottlenecks in estimating the density, we also introduce a new density approximation based on locality-sensitive hashing. Experimental results clearly demonstrate the efficacy of DACS in both classification and regression tasks and specifically show that DACS can produce state-of-the-art performance in a practical scenario. Since DACS is weakly dependent on neural architectures, we present a simple yet effective combination method to show that the existing methods can be beneficially combined with DACS.|主动学习通过从无标注数据集中标注信息量丰富的样本，能够高效构建标注数据集。在实际的主动学习场景中，由于存在大量冗余或高度相似的样本，考虑所选样本的多样性至关重要。核心集方法是基于多样性的代表性方法，它通过样本间距离筛选多样化样本。然而与基于不确定性的方法（选择神经网络模型置信度较低的最困难样本）相比，该方法表现欠佳。本研究从密度视角分析特征空间，有趣地发现局部稀疏区域往往比密集区域包含更多信息丰富的样本。基于此发现，我们为核⼼集方法注⼊密度感知能⼒，提出密度感知核⼼集（DACS）⽅法。该策略通过估计未标注样本的密度，主要从稀疏区域选择多样化样本。为降低密度估计的计算瓶颈，我们还引入了基于局部敏感哈希的新型密度近似算法。实验结果清晰证明了DACS在分类和回归任务中的有效性，特别展示了其在实践场景中可实现最先进性能。由于DACS对神经架构依赖性较弱，我们提出了一种简单有效的组合方法，证明现有方法可与DACS实现优势互补。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=In+Defense+of+Core-set:+A+Density-aware+Core-set+Selection+for+Active+Learning)|0|

The traffic flow system can be viewed as a dynamic process that transits between states (e.g., traffic volumes on each road segment) over time. In the real-world traffic system with traffic operation actions like traffic signal control or reversible lane changing, the system's state is influenced by both the historical states and the actions of traffic operations. In this paper, we consider the problem of modeling network-level traffic flow under a real-world setting, where the available data is sparse (i.e., only part of the traffic system is observed). We present DTIGNN, an approach that can predict network-level traffic flows from sparse data. DTIGNN models the traffic system as a dynamic graph influenced by traffic signals, learns the transition models grounded by fundamental transition equations from transportation, and predicts future traffic states with imputation in the process.

Since there exists learning dependency among knowledge attributes, it is crucial for cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs) to incorporate attribute hierarchy when assessing students. The attribute hierarchy is only explored by a few CDMs such as Attribute Hierarchy Method, and there are still two significant limitations in these methods. First, the time complexity would be unbearable when the number of attributes is large. Second, the assumption used to model the attribute hierarchy is too strong so that it may lose some information of the hierarchy and is not flexible enough to fit all situations. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Bayesian network-based Hierarchical Cognitive Diagnosis Framework (HierCDF), which enables many traditional diagnostic models to flexibly integrate the attribute hierarchy for better diagnosis. Specifically, we first use an efficient Bayesian network to model the influence of attribute hierarchy on students' cognitive states. Then we design a CDM adaptor to bridge the gap between students' cognitive states and the input features of existing diagnostic models. Finally, we analyze the generality and complexity of HierCDF to show its effectiveness in modeling hierarchy information.

Existing methods, typically relying on graph neural networks (GNNs) and temporal learning modules based on recurrent neural networks, have achieved significant performance improvements. However, their representation capabilities and prediction results are limited when pre-defined graphs are unavailable. Unlike spatio-temporal GNNs focusing on designing complex architectures, we propose a novel adaptive graph construction strategy: Self-Paced Graph Contrastive Learning (SPGCL). It learns informative relations by maximizing the distinguishing margin between positive and negative neighbors and generates an optimal graph with a self-paced strategy. Specifically, the existing neighborhoods iteratively absorb more reliable nodes with the highest affinity scores as new neighbors to generate the next-round neighborhoods, and augmentations are applied to improve the transferability and robustness. As the adaptively self-paced graph approaches the optimized graph for prediction, the mutual information between nodes and the corresponding neighbors is maximized.

|[Sparse Conditional Hidden Markov Model for Weakly Supervised Named Entity Recognition](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539247)|Yinghao Li, Le Song, Chao Zhang|MBZUAI, BioMap, Beijing, Peoples R China; Georgia Inst Technol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA|Weakly supervised named entity recognition methods train label models to aggregate the token annotations of multiple noisy labeling functions (LFs) without seeing any manually annotated labels. To work well, the label model needs to contextually identify and emphasize well-performed LFs while down-weighting the under-performers. However, evaluating the LFs is challenging due to the lack of ground truths. To address this issue, we propose the sparse conditional hidden Markov model (Sparse-CHMM). Instead of predicting the entire emission matrix as other HMM-based methods, Sparse-CHMM focuses on estimating its diagonal elements, which are considered as the reliability scores of the LFs. The sparse scores are then expanded to the full-fledged emission matrix with pre-defined expansion functions. We also augment the emission with weighted XOR scores, which track the probabilities of an LF observing incorrect entities. Sparse-CHMM is optimized through unsupervised learning with a three-stage training pipeline that reduces the training difficulty and prevents the model from falling into local optima. Compared with the baselines in the Wrench benchmark, Sparse-CHMM achieves a 3.01 average F1 score improvement on five comprehensive datasets. Experiments show that each component of Sparse-CHMM is effective, and the estimated LF reliabilities strongly correlate with true LF F1 scores.|弱监督命名实体识别方法通过训练标签模型来聚合多个噪声标注函数(LF)的标签标注结果，而无需使用任何人工标注数据。为达到良好效果，标签模型需要根据上下文识别并突出表现良好的标注函数，同时降低表现不佳函数的权重。然而由于缺乏真实标注数据，评估标注函数的性能颇具挑战。针对该问题，我们提出稀疏条件隐马尔可夫模型(Sparse-CHMM)。与其他基于隐马尔可夫模型的方法不同，Sparse-CHMM不预测完整的发射矩阵，而是专注于估计其对角线元素——这些元素被视为标注函数的可靠性评分。随后通过预定义的扩展函数将稀疏评分扩展为完整的发射矩阵。我们还采用加权异或评分增强发射矩阵，该评分可追踪标注函数观测到错误实体的概率。通过三阶段训练流程的无监督学习进行优化，Sparse-CHMM有效降低了训练难度并避免模型陷入局部最优。在Wrench基准测试中，Sparse-CHMM在五个综合数据集上实现了平均F1值3.01%的提升。实验表明该模型的每个组件均有效，且估计的标注函数可靠性与真实F1分数呈现强相关性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Sparse+Conditional+Hidden+Markov+Model+for+Weakly+Supervised+Named+Entity+Recognition)|0|

Due to its highly dynamic nature, temporally averaged fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) can only provide a narrow view of underlying brain activities. Previous works lack the ability to learn and interpret the latent dynamics in brain architectures. This paper builds an efficient graph neural network model that incorporates both region-mapped fMRI sequences and structural connectivities obtained from DWI (diffusion-weighted imaging) as inputs. We find good representations of the latent brain dynamics through learning sample-level adaptive adjacency matrices and performing a novel multi-resolution inner cluster smoothing. We also attribute inputs with integrated gradients, which enables us to infer (1) highly involved brain connections and subnetworks for each task, (2) temporal keyframes of imaging sequences that characterize tasks, and (3) subnetworks that discriminate between individual subjects. This ability to identify critical subnetworks that characterize signal states across heterogeneous tasks and individuals is of great importance to neuroscience and other scientific domains.

As annotating large amounts of data is time-consuming and labor-intensive, data scarcity occurs frequently in real-world scenarios, which motivates multi-label few-shot aspect category detection. However, research on this problem is still in infancy and few methods are available. In this paper, we propose a novel label-enhanced prototypical network (LPN) for multi-label few-shot aspect category detection. The highlights of LPN can be summarized as follows. First, it leverages label description as auxiliary knowledge to learn more discriminative prototypes, which can retain aspect-relevant information while eliminating the harmful effect caused by irrelevant aspects. Second, it integrates with contrastive learning, which encourages that the sentences with the same aspect label are pulled together in embedding space while simultaneously pushing apart the sentences with different aspect labels. In addition, it introduces an adaptive multi-label inference module to predict the aspect count in the sentence, which is simple yet effective. Extensive experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that our proposed model LPN can consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance.|多标签方面类别检测允许给定评论句包含多个方面类别，这在情感分析中更具实用性并日益受到关注。由于大规模数据标注耗时费力，现实场景中经常出现数据稀缺问题，这推动了多标签少样本方面类别检测的发展。然而该领域研究仍处于起步阶段，可用方法十分有限。本文提出一种新颖的标签增强原型网络（LPN）来解决多标签少样本方面类别检测问题。LPN的核心优势可归纳为三点：首先，利用标签描述作为辅助知识来学习更具判别性的原型，既能保留方面相关信息，又能消除无关方面造成的干扰；其次，结合对比学习机制，使具有相同方面标签的句子在嵌入空间中相互靠近，同时推远具有不同方面标签的句子；此外，引入自适应多标签推理模块来预测句子中的方面数量，该方法简洁而有效。在三个数据集上的大量实验结果表明，我们提出的LPN模型能够持续实现最先进的性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Label-enhanced+Prototypical+Network+with+Contrastive+Learning+for+Multi-label+Few-shot+Aspect+Category+Detection)|0|

It protects minority subgroups by requiring the learned representations to be independent of sensitive attributes. To achieve independence, the vast majority of the existing work primarily relaxes it to the minimization of the mutual information between sensitive attributes and learned representations. However, direct computation of mutual information is computationally intractable, and various upper bounds currently used either are still intractable or contradict the utility of the learned representations. In this paper, we introduce distance covariance as a new dependence measure into fair representation learning. By observing that sensitive attributes (e.g., gender, race, and age group) are typically categorical, the distance covariance can be converted to a tractable penalty term without contradicting the utility desideratum. Based on the tractable penalty, we propose FairDisCo, a variational method to learn fair representations.

Most mainstream methods treat each local observation as an entirety when modeling the decentralized local utility functions. However, they ignore the fact that local observation information can be further divided into several entities, and only part of the entities is helpful to model inference. Moreover, the importance of different entities may change over time. To improve the performance of decentralized policies, the attention mechanism is used to capture features of local information. Nevertheless, existing attention models rely on dense fully connected graphs and cannot better perceive important states. To this end, we propose a sparse state based MARL (S2RL) framework, which utilizes a sparse attention mechanism to discard irrelevant information in local observations. The local utility functions are estimated through the self-attention and sparse attention mechanisms separately, then are combined into a standard joint value function and auxiliary joint value function in the central critic. We design the S2RL framework as a plug-and-play module, making it general enough to be applied to various methods. Extensive experiments on StarCraft II show that S2RL can significantly improve the performance of many state-of-the-art methods.|协作式多智能体强化学习（MARL）已在众多实际应用中广泛使用，其中每个智能体根据自身观察做出决策。主流方法在建模分散式局部效用函数时，通常将局部观察视为整体进行处理。然而，这些方法忽略了局部观察信息可进一步划分为多个实体，且仅部分实体对模型推理具有帮助作用这一事实。更重要的是，不同实体的重要性会随时间动态变化。为提升分散式策略的性能，现有研究采用注意力机制来捕捉局部信息的特征。但现有注意力模型依赖于稠密的全连接图结构，难以有效感知关键状态。为此，我们提出基于稀疏状态的MARL框架（S2RL），通过稀疏注意力机制剔除局部观察中的无关信息。该框架分别通过自注意力机制和稀疏注意力机制估计局部效用函数，并将其整合为中心评论器中的标准联合值函数与辅助联合值函数。S2RL被设计为即插即用模块，具有强通用性可应用于多种方法。在《星际争霸II》上的大量实验表明，S2RL能显著提升多种前沿方法的性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=S2RL:+Do+We+Really+Need+to+Perceive+All+States+in+Deep+Multi-Agent+Reinforcement+Learning?)|0|

It plays a pivotal role in causal discovery and many other downstream applications. The methods for causal skeleton learning fall into three primary categories: constraint-based, score-based, and gradient-based methods. This paper, for the first time, advocates for learning a causal skeleton in a supervision-based setting, where the algorithm learns from additional datasets associated with the ground-truth BNs (complementary to input observational data). Concretizing a supervision-based method is non-trivial due to the high complexity of the problem itself, and the potential "domain shift" between training data (i.e., additional datasets associated with ground-truth BNs) and test data (i.e., observational data) in the supervision-based setting. First, it is well-known that skeleton learning suffers worst-case exponential complexity. Second, conventional supervised learning assumes an independent and identical distribution (i.i.d.) on test data, which is not easily attainable due to the divergent underlying causal mechanisms between training and test data. Our proposed framework, ML4S, adopts order-based cascade classifiers and pruning strategies that can withstand high computational overhead without sacrificing accuracy. To address the "domain shift" challenge, we generate training data from vicinal graphs w.r.t. the target BN. The associated datasets of vicinal graphs share similar joint distributions with the observational data. We evaluate ML4S on a variety of datasets and observe that it remarkably outperforms the state of the arts, demonstrating the great potential of the supervision-based skeleton learning paradigm.|因果骨架学习旨在从观测数据中识别潜在因果贝叶斯网络（BN）的无向图结构。该技术在因果发现及众多下游应用中具有关键作用。现有因果骨架学习方法主要分为三类：基于约束的方法、基于评分的方法和基于梯度的方法。本文首次提出在监督学习框架下进行因果骨架学习，该算法通过结合真实因果贝叶斯网络对应的附加数据集（作为输入观测数据的补充）进行训练。由于问题本身的高复杂性，以及监督学习框架中训练数据（即真实BN对应的附加数据集）与测试数据（即观测数据）可能存在的"域偏移"现象，实现有效的监督式学习方法面临重大挑战。首先，骨架学习在最坏情况下具有指数级计算复杂度已是公认难题。其次，传统监督学习假设测试数据满足独立同分布（i.i.d.），但由于训练数据与测试数据背后潜在的因果机制存在差异，该假设难以成立。我们提出的ML4S框架采用基于级联排序的分类器架构和剪枝策略，在保持精度的同时能有效应对高计算开销。针对"域偏移"挑战，我们通过目标BN的邻近图生成训练数据，这些邻近图对应的数据集与观测数据具有相似的联合分布。我们在多个数据集上评估ML4S，发现其性能显著超越现有最优方法，充分证明了监督式骨架学习范式的巨大潜力。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=ML4S:+Learning+Causal+Skeleton+from+Vicinal+Graphs)|0|

In this paper, we present a non-stationary time-aware kernelized attention approach for input sequences of neural networks. By constructing the Generalized Spectral Mixture Kernel (GSMK), and integrating it to the attention mechanism, we mathematically reveal its representation capability in terms of the time-dependent temporal-correlation. Following that, a novel neural network structure is proposed, which would enable us to encode both stationary and non-stationary time event series.

Sullivan|Univ Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA|A primary challenge in metagenomics is reconstructing individual microbial genomes from the mixture of short fragments created by sequencing. Recent work leverages the sparsity of the assembly graph to find r-dominating sets which enable rapid approximate queries through a dominator-centric graph partition. In this paper, we consider two problems related to reducing uncertainty and improving scalability in this setting. First, we observe that nodes with multiple closest dominators necessitate arbitrary tie-breaking in the existing pipeline. As such, we propose findingsparse dominating sets which minimize this effect via a newcongestion parameter. We prove minimizing congestion is NP-hard, and give an O (√Δr) approximation algorithm, where Δ is the max degree. To improve scalability, the graph should be partitioned into uniformly sized pieces, subject to placing vertices with a closest dominator. This leads to balanced neighborhood partitioning : given an r-dominating set, find a partition into connected subgraphs with optimal uniformity so that each vertex is co-assigned with some closest dominator. Using variance of piece sizes to measure uniformity, we show this problem is NP-hard iff r is greater than 1. We design and analyze several algorithms, including a polynomial-time approach which is exact when r=1 (and heuristic otherwise). We complement our theoretical results with computational experiments on a corpus of real-world networks showing sparse dominating sets lead to more balanced neighborhood partitionings. Further, on the metagenome fHuSB1, our approach maintains high query containment and similarity while reducing piece size variance.|宏基因组学中的一个核心挑战是从测序产生的短片段混合物中重建个体微生物基因组。近期研究利用组装图的稀疏性寻找r-支配集，通过以支配节点为中心的图划分实现快速近似查询。本文针对该领域中降低不确定性和提升可扩展性两大问题展开研究。首先，我们观察到当节点存在多个最近支配节点时，现有流程需进行任意断点处理。为此，我们提出通过新型拥塞参数寻找稀疏支配集以最小化该影响，并证明最小化拥塞属于NP难问题，同时给出O(√Δr)近似算法（Δ为最大度值）。为提升可扩展性，需在遵循"顶点与最近支配节点同组"原则下将图划分为均匀子块，由此引出平衡邻域划分问题：给定r-支配集，寻求将图划分为连通子图的最优均匀方案。通过子图尺寸方差衡量均匀度，我们证明该问题在r＞1时具NP难特性。我们设计并分析了多种算法，包括在r=1时精确的多项式时间算法（r＞1时启发性适用）。通过真实网络数据集的计算实验证实：稀疏支配集可产生更平衡的邻域划分。在fHuSB1宏基因组数据上，我们的方法在降低子图尺寸方差的同时，保持了高查询包含度与相似性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Minimizing+Congestion+for+Balanced+Dominators)|0|

Most existing works rely on adversarial representation learning to inject some invariance into representation. However, adversarial learning methods are known to suffer from relatively unstable training, and this might harm the balance between fairness and predictiveness of representation. We propose a new approach, learningFAir Representation via distributional CONtrastive Variational AutoEncoder (FarconVAE), which induces the latent space to be disentangled into sensitive and non-sensitive parts. We first construct the pair of observations with different sensitive attributes but with the same labels. Then, FarconVAE enforces each non-sensitive latent to be closer, while sensitive latents to be far from each other and also far from the non-sensitive latent by contrasting their distributions.

|[MetaV: A Meta-Verifier Approach to Task-Agnostic Model Fingerprinting](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539257)|Xudong Pan, Yifan Yan, Mi Zhang, Min Yang|Fudan Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China|Protecting the intellectual property (IP) of deep neural networks (DNN) becomes an urgent concern for IT corporations. For model piracy forensics, previous model fingerprinting schemes are commonly based on adversarial examples constructed for the owner's model as the fingerprint, and verify whether a suspect model is indeed pirated from the original model by matching the behavioral pattern on the fingerprint examples between one another. However, these methods heavily rely on the characteristics of classification tasks which inhibits their application to more general scenarios. To address this issue, we present MetaV, the first task-agnostic model fingerprinting framework which enables fingerprinting on a much wider range of DNNs independent from the downstream learning task, and exhibits strong robustness against a variety of ownership obfuscation techniques. Specifically, we generalize previous schemes into two critical design components in MetaV: the adaptive fingerprint and the meta-verifier, which are jointly optimized such that the meta-verifier learns to determine whether a suspect model is stolen based on the concatenated outputs of the suspect model on the adaptive fingerprint. As a key of being task-agnostic, the full process makes no assumption on the model internals in the ensemble only if they have the same input and output dimensions. Spanning classification, regression and generative modeling, extensive experimental results validate the substantially improved performance of MetaV over the state-of-the-art fingerprinting schemes and demonstrate the enhanced generality of MetaV for providing task-agnostic fingerprinting. For example, on fingerprinting ResNet-18 trained for skin cancer diagnosis, MetaV achieves simultaneously 100% true positives and 100% true negatives on a diverse test set of 70 suspect models, achieving an about 220% relative improvement in ARUC over the optimal baseline.|保护深度神经网络（DNN）的知识产权（IP）已成为科技企业的紧迫议题。针对模型盗版取证，现有模型指纹方案通常以针对所有者模型构建的对抗样本作为指纹，通过比对可疑模型与原始模型在指纹样本上的行为模式一致性来验证盗版行为。然而，这些方法过度依赖分类任务的特性，限制了其在更广泛场景中的应用。为此，我们提出首个任务无关的模型指纹框架MetaV，该框架可脱离下游学习任务对更广泛的DNN模型进行指纹识别，并对多种所有权混淆技术展现出强鲁棒性。具体而言，我们将现有方案泛化为MetaV的两个核心组件：自适应指纹与元验证器。通过联合优化使元验证器学会根据可疑模型在自适应指纹上的拼接输出判断其是否盗版。作为实现任务无关的关键，整个流程仅需确保模型集合具有相同的输入输出维度，无需任何模型内部结构的先验假设。在分类、回归和生成建模三大任务上的大量实验表明，MetaV相比最先进指纹方案性能显著提升，验证了其增强的任务无关通用性。以皮肤癌诊断任务的ResNet-18模型为例，MetaV在包含70个可疑模型的多样化测试集上同时实现100%真阳性率和100%真阴性率，其ARUC指标相较最优基线实现约220%的相对提升。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=MetaV:+A+Meta-Verifier+Approach+to+Task-Agnostic+Model+Fingerprinting)|0|
|[Predicting Opinion Dynamics via Sociologically-Informed Neural Networks](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539228)|Maya Okawa, Tomoharu Iwata|NTT Human Informat Labs, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan; NTT Commun Sci Labs, Kyoto, Japan|Opinion formation and propagation are crucial phenomena in social networks and have been extensively studied across several disciplines. Traditionally, theoretical models of opinion dynamics have been proposed to describe the interactions between individuals (i.e., social interaction) and their impact on the evolution of collective opinions. Although these models can incorporate sociological and psychological knowledge on the mechanisms of social interaction, they demand extensive calibration with real data to make reliable predictions, requiring much time and effort. Recently, the widespread use of social media platforms provides new paradigms to learn deep learning models from a large volume of social media data. However, these methods ignore any scientific knowledge about the mechanism of social interaction. In this work, we present the first hybrid method called Sociologically-Informed Neural Network (SINN), which integrates theoretical models and social media data by transporting the concepts of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) from natural science (i.e., physics) into social science (i.e., sociology and social psychology). In particular, we recast theoretical models as ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Then we train a neural network that simultaneously approximates the data and conforms to the ODEs that represent the social scientific knowledge. In addition, we extend PINNs by integrating matrix factorization and a language model to incorporate rich side information (e.g., user profiles) and structural knowledge (e.g., cluster structure of the social interaction network). Moreover, we develop an end-to-end training procedure for SINN, which involves Gumbel-Softmax approximation to include stochastic mechanisms of social interaction. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets show SINN outperforms six baseline methods in predicting opinion dynamics.|观点形成与传播是社交网络中的关键现象，已在多个学科领域得到广泛研究。传统上，学者们提出观点动力学的理论模型来描述个体间互动（即社会互动）及其对集体观点演化的影响。尽管这些模型能够融入关于社会互动机制的社会学和心理学知识，但需要大量真实数据进行校准才能做出可靠预测，耗费大量时间和精力。近年来，社交媒体平台的广泛使用为从海量社交媒体数据中学习深度学习模型提供了新范式，但这些方法忽略了关于社会互动机制的科学知识。本研究首次提出名为"社会学知识引导神经网络"（SINN）的混合方法，通过将物理信息神经网络（PINNs）的概念从自然科学（物理学）迁移到社会科学（社会学与社会心理学），实现了理论模型与社交媒体数据的融合。具体而言，我们将理论模型重构为常微分方程（ODEs），然后训练一个同时满足数据拟合和符合社会科学知识ODEs约束的神经网络。此外，我们通过集成矩阵分解和语言模型来扩展PINNs，以融入丰富的辅助信息（如用户画像）和结构知识（如社交互动网络的聚类结构）。更重要的是，我们开发了SINN的端到端训练流程，采用Gumbel-Softmax近似方法来包含社会互动的随机机制。在真实世界和合成数据集上的大量实验表明，SINN在预测观点动力学方面优于六种基线方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Predicting+Opinion+Dynamics+via+Sociologically-Informed+Neural+Networks)|0|
|[Bilateral Dependency Optimization: Defending Against Model-inversion Attacks](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539376)|Xiong Peng, Feng Liu, Jingfeng Zhang, Long Lan, Junjie Ye, Tongliang Liu, Bo Han|Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; RIKEN AIP, Tokyo, Japan; Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia; Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia|Through using only a well-trained classifier, model-inversion (MI) attacks can recover the data used for training the classifier, leading to the privacy leakage of the training data. To defend against MI attacks, previous work utilizes a unilateral dependency optimization strategy, i.e., minimizing the dependency between inputs (i.e., features) and outputs (i.e., labels) during training the classifier. However, such a minimization process conflicts with minimizing the supervised loss that aims to maximize the dependency between inputs and outputs, causing an explicit trade-off between model robustness against MI attacks and model utility on classification tasks. In this paper, we aim to minimize the dependency between the latent representations and the inputs while maximizing the dependency between latent representations and the outputs, named a bilateral dependency optimization (BiDO) strategy. In particular, we use the dependency constraints as a universally applicable regularizer in addition to commonly used losses for deep neural networks (e.g., cross-entropy), which can be instantiated with appropriate dependency criteria according to different tasks. To verify the efficacy of our strategy, we propose two implementations of BiDO, by using two different dependency measures: BiDO with constrained covariance (BiDO-COCO) and BiDO with Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (BiDO-HSIC). Experiments show that BiDO achieves the state-of-the-art defense performance for a variety of datasets, classifiers, and MI attacks while suffering a minor classification-accuracy drop compared to the well-trained classifier with no defense, which lights up a novel road to defend against MI attacks.|仅通过使用训练有素的分类器，模型逆向（MI）攻击便能恢复用于训练分类器的数据，导致训练数据的隐私泄露。为防御MI攻击，已有研究采用单边依赖优化策略，即在训练分类器时最小化输入（特征）与输出（标签）之间的依赖性。然而，这种最小化过程与旨在最大化输入输出依赖性的监督损失最小化目标相冲突，导致模型抗MI攻击的鲁棒性与模型在分类任务上的实用性之间出现明显权衡。本文提出双边依赖优化（BiDO）策略，旨在最小化潜在表示与输入之间依赖性的同时，最大化潜在表示与输出之间的依赖性。具体而言，我们将依赖约束作为通用正则化项，与深度神经网络常用损失函数（如交叉熵）结合使用，并可根据不同任务选用合适的依赖度量准则进行实例化。为验证策略有效性，我们基于两种依赖度量提出BiDO的两种实现：基于约束协方差的BiDO（BiDO-COCO）和基于希尔伯特-施密特独立性准则的BiDO（BiDO-HSIC）。实验表明，在多种数据集、分类器和MI攻击场景下，BiDO均达到最先进的防御性能，且与无防御的成熟分类器相比仅产生轻微的分类精度损失，这为防御MI攻击开辟了新路径。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Bilateral+Dependency+Optimization:+Defending+Against+Model-inversion+Attacks)|0|

However, symbolic computation is always treated as an end-to-end blackbox prediction task, where human-like symbolic deductive logic is missing. In this paper, we argue that any complex symbolic computation can be broken down to a sequence of finite Fundamental Computation Transformations (FCT), which are grounded as certain mathematical expression computation transformations. The entire computation sequence represents a full human understandable symbolic deduction process. Instead of studying on different end-to-end neural network applications, this paper focuses on approximating FCT which further build up symbolic deductive logic. To better mimic symbolic computations with math expression transformations, we propose a novel tree representation learning architecture GATE (Graph Aggregation Transformer Encoder) for math expressions. We generate a large-scale math expression transformation dataset for training purpose and collect a real-world dataset for validation. Experiments demonstrate the feasibility of producing step-by-step human-like symbolic deduction sequences with the proposed approach, which outperforms other neural network approaches and heuristic approaches.|神经网络在符号计算领域的能力已通过大量近期研究得以显现。然而，符号计算始终被视为端到端的黑箱预测任务，其中缺乏类人的符号演绎逻辑。本文提出，任何复杂的符号计算均可被分解为有限个基本计算变换（FCT）的序列，这些变换以特定数学表达式计算转换的形式实现。完整的计算序列构成了人类可理解的符号演绎过程。不同于研究各类端到端的神经网络应用，本文着眼于逼近能构建符号演绎逻辑的基本计算变换。为更好地通过数学表达式变换模拟符号计算，我们提出创新的树状表征学习架构GATE（图聚合Transformer编码器）用于数学表达式处理。我们生成大规模数学表达式转换数据集用于训练，并收集真实场景数据集进行验证。实验证明，采用所提出方法可生成逐步推进的类人符号演绎序列，其性能优于其他神经网络方法与启发式方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Compute+Like+Humans:+Interpretable+Step-by-step+Symbolic+Computation+with+Deep+Neural+Network)|0|

Generally, two major components information extraction (IE) and entity linking (EL) are involved in KG construction. However, the existing approaches just focus on evaluating the triple accuracy that indicates the IE quality, completely ignoring the entity accuracy. Motivated by the fact that the major advance of machines is the strong computing power while humans are skilled in correctness verification, we propose an efficient interactive method to reduce the overall cost for evaluating the KG quality, which produces accuracy estimates with a statistical guarantee for both triples and entities. Instead of annotating triples and entities separately, we design a general annotation cost that blends triples and entities generated from the identical source text. During human verification, the machine can pre-compute and infer triples to be annotated in the next round by speculating human feedback. The human-machine collaborative mechanism is optimized by formulating an order selection problem of triples which is NP-hard. Thus, a Monte Carlo Tree Search is proposed to guide the annotation process by finding an approximate solution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method takes less annotation cost while yielding higher accuracy estimation quality compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.|自动构建的知识图谱（KG）通常包含大量实体与三元组，这使其准确性评估成为一项具有挑战性的任务。一般而言，KG构建涉及信息抽取（IE）和实体链接（EL）两大核心环节。然而现有评估方法仅关注反映IE质量的三元组准确性，完全忽略了实体准确性。基于机器擅长强计算能力而人类精于正确性验证这一特点，我们提出一种高效的交互式方法，以统计保证的方式同时评估三元组和实体的准确性，从而降低KG质量评估的整体成本。不同于对三元组和实体分别进行标注，我们设计了一种通用标注成本框架，将源自同一文本的三元组与实体标注相融合。在人工验证过程中，机器可通过推测人类反馈结果来预计算并推断下一轮待标注的三元组。通过将人机协作机制建模为NP难的三元组排序选择问题，我们采用蒙特卡洛树搜索算法寻找近似最优解以指导标注流程。大量实验表明，相较于现有最优方法，本方案能以更低的标注成本获得更高质量的准确性评估结果。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Evaluating+Knowledge+Graph+Accuracy+Powered+by+Optimized+Human-machine+Collaboration)|0|

Rossi, Yun Fu|Northeastern Univ, Boston, MA 02115 USA; Adobe Res, San Francisco, CA 94107 USA|Tabular pre-training models have received increasing attention due to the wide-ranging applications for tabular data analysis. However, most of the existing solutions are directly built upon the tabular data with a mixture of non-semantic and semantic contents. According to the statistics, only 30% of tabular data in wikitables are semantic entities that are surrounded and isolated by enormous irregular characters such as numbers, strings, symbols, etc. Despite the small portion, such semantic entities are crucial for table understanding. This paper attempts to enhance the existing tabular pre-training model by injecting common-sense knowledge from external sources. Compared with the knowledge injection in the natural language pre-training models, the tabular model naturally requires overcoming the domain gaps between external knowledge and tabular data with significant differences in both structures and contents. To this end, we propose the dual-adapters inserted within the pre-trained tabular model for flexible and efficient knowledge injection. The two parallel adapters are trained by the knowledge graph triplets and semantically augmented tables respectively for infusion and alignment with the tabular data. In addition, a path-wise attention layer is attached below to fuse the cross-domain representation with the weighted contribution. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of our proposed knowledge injection framework, we extensively test it on 5 different application scenarios covering both zero-shot and finetuning-based tabular understanding tasks over the cell, column, and tables levels.|表格预训练模型因在表格数据分析中的广泛应用而受到越来越多的关注。然而，现有方案大多直接基于混合了非语义内容与语义内容的表格数据构建。据统计，维基表格中仅有30%的数据属于语义实体，这些实体被大量不规则字符（如数字、字符串、符号等）包围和隔离。尽管占比不高，此类语义实体对表格理解至关重要。本文尝试通过注入外部常识知识来增强现有表格预训练模型。与自然语言预训练模型的知识注入相比，表格模型天然需要克服外部知识与表格数据之间的领域鸿沟——二者在结构和内容上均存在显著差异。为此，我们提出在预训练表格模型中插入双适配器，以实现灵活高效的知识注入。两个并行适配器分别通过知识图谱三元组和语义增强表格进行训练，以实现知识融合及与表格数据的对齐。此外，模型底层还引入了路径注意力层，通过加权贡献度融合跨域表征。最后，为验证所提出知识注入框架的有效性，我们在5个不同应用场景中进行了广泛测试，涵盖单元格、列和表格三个层级上的零样本和基于微调的表格理解任务。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=External+Knowledge+Infusion+for+Tabular+Pre-training+Models+with+Dual-adapters)|0|

Mahmudur Rahman, Sanjay Purushotham|Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Baltimore, MD 21228 USA|Survival analysis aims to predict the risk of an event, such as death due to cancer, in the presence of censoring. Recent research has shown that existing survival techniques are prone to unintentional biases towards protected attributes such as age, race, and/or gender. For example, censoring assumed to be unrelated to the prognosis and covariates (typically violated in real data) often leads to overestimation and biased survival predictions for different protected groups. In order to attenuate harmful bias and ensure fair survival predictions, we introduce fairness definitions based on survival functions and censoring. We propose novel fair and interpretable survival models which use pseudo valued-based objective functions with fairness definitions as constraints for predicting subject-specific survival probabilities. Experiments on three real-world survival datasets demonstrate that our proposed fair survival models show significant improvement over existing survival techniques in terms of accuracy and fairness measures. We show that our proposed models provide fair predictions for protected attributes under different types and amounts of censoring. Furthermore, we study the interplay between interpretability and fairness; and investigate how fairness and censoring impact survival predictions for different protected attributes.|生存分析旨在存在数据删失的情况下预测事件（如癌症致死）的风险。近期研究表明，现有生存分析技术容易对年龄、种族和/或性别等受保护属性产生无意识的偏见。例如，假定与预后和协变量无关的删失（这一假设在实际数据中常被违反）通常会导致对不同受保护群体的生存率高估和存在偏见的预测。为减少有害偏见并确保公平的生存预测，我们提出了基于生存函数和删失机制的公平性定义。我们创新性地构建了公平可解释的生存模型，该模型采用基于伪值的损失函数，并将公平性定义作为约束条件来预测个体特异性生存概率。在三个真实世界生存数据集上的实验表明，我们提出的公平生存模型在准确性和公平性指标上均较现有技术有显著提升。研究证明，我们的模型能在不同类型和数量的删失情况下，为受保护属性提供公平的预测结果。此外，我们还探讨了可解释性与公平性的相互作用，并研究了公平性和删失机制如何影响不同受保护属性的生存预测。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Fair+and+Interpretable+Models+for+Survival+Analysis)|0|

That is, although the overall performance of a new classifier is improved, users will be confused by the wrong predictions of the new classifier, especially when the predictions of the old classifier are correct for the same samples. To this end, several metrics and learning methods for backward compatibility have been actively studied recently. Despite significant interest in backward compatibility, the metrics and methods are not well known from a theoretical perspective. In this paper, we first analyze the existing backward compatibility metrics and reveal that these metrics essentially assess the same quantity between old and new models. In addition, to obtain a unified view of backward compatibility metrics, we propose a generalized backward compatibility (GBC) metric that can represent the existing backward compatibility metrics. We formulate a learning objective based on the GBC metric and derive the estimation error bound, and the result is applied to one of the existing methods. Through further analysis, we reveal that the existing backward compatibility metrics are not suitable for imbalanced classification. We then design a backward compatibility metric for imbalanced classification on the basis of the GBC metric and empirically demonstrate the practicality of the proposed metric.|在机器学习和人工智能应用中，分类器的新数据重训练是不可或缺的环节，但现有多数机器学习方法并未考虑预测的后向兼容性。也就是说，尽管新分类器的整体性能有所提升，但当新旧模型对相同样本的预测结果不一致时（特别是旧模型预测正确而新模型预测错误的情况），用户会因新分类器的错误预测产生困惑。为此，近年来学界已开始积极研究后向兼容性的度量方法与学习策略。尽管后向兼容性备受关注，但其度量方法与理论基础的关联性尚未得到充分阐释。本文首先分析了现有后向兼容性度量指标，揭示这些指标本质上都是在评估新旧模型间的同一特性。进而为建立统一的后向兼容性度量框架，我们提出了广义后向兼容性（GBC）度量标准，该标准可涵盖现有各类兼容性指标。我们基于GBC度量构建了学习目标函数，推导出估计误差界限，并将该理论成果应用于现有方法之一。通过深入分析，我们发现现有后向兼容性度量不适用于不平衡分类场景。基于GBC度量框架，我们设计了面向不平衡分类的后向兼容性度量标准，并通过实证研究验证了所提指标的实用性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=A+Generalized+Backward+Compatibility+Metric)|0|

Noun phrases and relation phrases in such OKBs are not canonicalized, which leads to scattered and redundant facts. It is found that two views of knowledge (i.e., a fact view based on the fact triple and a context view based on the fact triple's source context) provide complementary information that is vital to the task of OKB canonicalization, which clusters synonymous noun phrases and relation phrases into the same group and assigns them unique identifiers. However, these two views of knowledge have so far been leveraged in isolation by existing works. In this paper, we propose CMVC, a novel unsupervised framework that leverages these two views of knowledge jointly for canonicalizing OKBs without the need of manually annotated labels. To achieve this goal, we propose a multi-view CH K-Means clustering algorithm to mutually reinforce the clustering of view-specific embeddings learned from each view by considering their different clustering qualities. In order to further enhance the canonicalization performance, we propose a training data optimization strategy in terms of data quantity and data quality respectively in each particular view to refine the learned view-specific embeddings in an iterative manner. Additionally, we propose a Log-Jump algorithm to predict the optimal number of clusters in a data-driven way without requiring any labels.

Herewe analyze task fMRI (t-fMRI) data where the subject performs a multi-event task over multiple trials. t-fMRI data allows exploring more challenging applications such as prognosis of treatment but at the cost of being more complex to analyze. Not only do multiple types of trials exist but the trials of each type are repeated a varying number of times for each subject. This leads to a multi-view (multiple types of trials) and multi-instance (multiple trials of each type of each subject) setting. We propose a deep multi-model architecture to encode multi-view brain activities from t-fMRI data and a multi-layer perceptron ensemble model to combine these view models and make subject-wise predictions. We explore domain adaptation transfer learning between models to address unbalanced views and a novel way to make predictions out of multi-instance embeddings.

|[Active Model Adaptation Under Unknown Shift](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539262)|JieJing Shao, Yunlu Xu, Zhanzhan Cheng, YuFeng Li|Hikvis Res Inst, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; Nanjing Univ, Natl Key Lab Novel Software Technol, Nanjing, Peoples R China|Successful machine learning typically relies on fixed data distribution. However, due to unforeseen situations in the open world, distribution shift often occurs in applications. For instance, in the image recognition task, an unpredictable distributional shift may occur due to changes in background or lighting. Furthermore, to alleviate the harm of distribution shift, the resource budget is not infinite and often constrained. To cope with such a novel problem Resource Constrained Adaptation under Unknown Shift, in this paper we study active model adaptation both theoretically and empirically. First, we present a generalization analysis of active model adaptation for distribution shift. In theory, we show that active model adaptation could improve the generalization error from O(1/N) to O(1/N), with only a few queried samples. Second, based on the theoretical analysis, we present a systemic solution Auto, consisting of three sub-steps, that is, distribution tracking, sample selection and model adaptation. Specifically, we design a shifted distribution detection module to locate the distributional shifted samples. To fit the labeling budget, we employ a core-set algorithm to enhance the informativeness of the selected samples. Finally, we update the model through the newly queried labeled data. We conduct empirical studies of nine existing active strategies on diverse real world data sets and the results show that Auto could remarkably outperform all the baselines.|成功的机器学习通常依赖于固定的数据分布。然而在开放世界中，由于不可预见的状况，实际应用常会出现分布偏移。例如在图像识别任务中，背景或光照条件的变化可能导致不可预测的分布偏移。此外，为缓解分布偏移带来的危害，资源预算往往有限而非无限。为应对这一"未知偏移下的资源受限自适应"新问题，本文从理论与实证两方面研究主动模型自适应方法。首先，我们提出了分布偏移场景下主动模型自适应的泛化性理论分析，从理论上证明仅需少量查询样本即可将泛化误差从O(1/N)提升至O(1/N²)。其次基于理论分析，我们构建了包含三个子步骤的系统性解决方案Auto：分布追踪、样本选择与模型自适应。具体而言，我们设计了偏移分布检测模块来定位分布偏移样本；为适配标注预算，采用核心集算法增强所选样本的信息量；最后通过新获取的标注数据更新模型。我们在多个真实世界数据集上对九种现有主动策略进行实证研究，结果表明Auto能够显著超越所有基线方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Active+Model+Adaptation+Under+Unknown+Shift)|0|

However, concerns have been raised that GNNs could make biased decisions against underprivileged groups or individuals. To remedy this issue, researchers have proposed various fairness notions including individual fairness that gives similar predictions to similar individuals. However, existing methods in individual fairness rely on Lipschitz condition: they only optimize overall individual fairness and disregard equality of individual fairness between groups. This leads to drastically different levels of individual fairness among groups. We tackle this problem by proposing a novel GNN framework GUIDE to achieve group equality informed individual fairness in GNNs. We aim to not only achieve individual fairness but also equalize the levels of individual fairness among groups. Specifically, our framework operates on the similarity matrix of individuals to learn personalized attention to achieve individual fairness without group level disparity. Comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that GUIDE obtains good balance of group equality informed individual fairness and model utility. The open-source implementation of GUIDE can be found here: https://github.com/mikesong724/GUIDE.|图神经网络（GNN）凭借其卓越性能和端到端设计，在关键决策场景中正发挥着日益重要的作用。然而，有研究指出GNN可能对弱势群体或个人产生带有偏见性的决策。为解决这一问题，研究者提出了多种公平性概念，包括对相似个体给出相似预测的个体公平性。但现有个体公平性方法依赖利普希茨条件：仅优化整体个体公平性，而忽视了群体间个体公平性的均衡性，这导致不同群体的个体公平性水平差异悬殊。我们通过提出新型GNN框架GUIDE来解决该问题，旨在实现具有群体平等意识的个体公平性。我们的目标不仅是实现个体公平性，更要使不同群体间的个体公平性水平趋于均衡。具体而言，该框架基于个体相似度矩阵运作，通过个性化注意力机制实现无群体差异的个体公平性。在真实数据集上的综合实验表明，GUIDE在群体平等意识的个体公平性与模型效用之间取得了良好平衡。GUIDE的开源实现可见：https://github.com/mikesong724/GUIDE。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=GUIDE:+Group+Equality+Informed+Individual+Fairness+in+Graph+Neural+Networks)|0|

However, deep learning models often require a large amount of annotated data to achieve satisfactory performance, and NER annotation is significantly time-consuming and labor-intensive due to the fine-grained labels. To address this issue, we propose a textual data augmentation method that can automatically generate informative synthetic samples, which contribute to the development of a robust classifier. The proposed method generates additional training data by estimating the optimal level of worst-case transformation of training data while preserving the original annotation, and includes them into training to construct a robust decision boundary. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets in a low-resource environment reveal that the proposed method outperforms two baseline augmentation methods including human annotation, which is typically considered to provide a decent amount of performance boost.

Momentum-based acceleration of SGD is the default optimizer for many deep learning models. However, there is a lack of general convergence guarantees for many existing momentum variants in conjunction withstochastic gradient. It is also unclear how the momentum methods may affect thegeneralization error. In this paper, we give a unified analysis of several popular optimizers, e.g., Polyak's heavy ball momentum and Nesterov's accelerated gradient. Our contribution is threefold. First, we give a unified convergence guarantee for a large class of momentum variants in thestochastic setting. Notably, our results cover both convex and nonconvex objectives. Second, we prove a generalization bound for neural networks trained by momentum variants. We analyze how hyperparameters affect the generalization bound and consequently propose guidelines on how to tune these hyperparameters in various momentum schemes to generalize well.

Observing winds is a complex process and presents a large gap in NASA's Earth Observation System. Atmospheric motion vectors (AMVs) aim to fill this gap by making numerical estimates of cloud movement between sequences of multi-spectral satellite images, tracking clouds and water vapor. Recent imaging hardware and software advancements have enabled the use of numerical optical flow techniques to produce accurate and dense vector fields outperforming traditional methods. This work presents WindFlow as the first machine learning based system for feature tracking atmospheric motion using optical flow. Due to the lack of large-scale satellite-based observations, we leverage high-resolution numerical simulations from NASA's GEOS-5 Nature Run to perform supervised learning and transfer to satellite images. We demonstrate that our approach using deep learning based optical flow scales to ultra-high-resolution images of size 2881x5760 with less than 1 m/s bias and 2.5 m/s average error. Four network and learning architectures are compared and it is found that recurrent all-pairs field transforms (RAFT) produces the lowest errors on all metrics for wind speed and direction. Results on held out numerical outputs show RAFT's good performance in each of the spatial, temporal, and physical dimensions. A comparison between WindFlow and an operational AMV product against rawinsonde observations shows that RAFT transfers across simulations and thermal infrared satellite observations. This work shows that machine learning based optical flow is an efficient approach to generating robust feature tracking for AMVs consistently over large regions.|大气风是影响自然灾害、能源输送、洋流运动、大尺度环流和生态系统通量的关键物理现象。由于观测过程复杂，风场观测一直是NASA地球观测系统中的重要空白领域。大气运动矢量（AMV）技术通过分析多光谱卫星图像序列中的云层运动，追踪云系和水汽轨迹来填补这一空白。近年来成像硬件与软件的进步，使得数值光流技术能够生成比传统方法更精确、更密集的矢量场。本研究提出的WindFlow系统首次实现基于机器学习的光流法大气运动特征追踪。针对卫星观测数据不足的现状，我们利用NASA GEOS-5 Nature Run的高分辨率数值模拟数据进行监督学习，并将其迁移至卫星图像。实验表明，基于深度学习的光流方法可扩展至2881×5760像素的超高分辨率图像，风速偏差小于1米/秒，平均误差低于2.5米/秒。通过比较四种网络与学习架构，发现循环全对场变换（RAFT）在风速风向所有指标上误差最低。在预留数值输出数据上的测试表明，RAFT在空间、时间和物理维度均表现良好。将WindFlow与业务化AMV产品分别对比无线电探空观测数据，证实RAFT能够有效实现数值模拟与热红外卫星观测的跨域迁移。本研究表明，基于机器学习的光流法是一种高效方法，可在大范围区域内持续生成稳健的AMV特征追踪结果。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Dense+Feature+Tracking+of+Atmospheric+Winds+with+Deep+Optical+Flow)|0|

Although a number of works have been proposed in recent years, most of contemporary works acquire the traits parameters of learners and items in a transductive way, which are only suitable for stationary data. However, in the real scenario, the data is collected online, where learners, test items and interactions usually grow continuously, which can rarely meet the stationary condition. To this end, we propose a novel framework, Incremental Cognitive Diagnosis (ICD), to tailor cognitive diagnosis into the online scenario of intelligent education. Specifically, we first design a Deep Trait Network (DTN), which acquires the trait parameters in an inductive way rather than a transductive way. Then, we propose an Incremental Update Algorithm (IUA) to balance the effectiveness and training efficiency. We carry out Turning Point (TP) analysis to reduce update frequency, where we derive the minimum update condition based on the monotonicity theory of cognitive diagnosis. Meanwhile, we use a momentum update strategy on the incremental data to decrease update time without sacrificing effectiveness. Moreover, to keep the trait parameters as stable as possible, we refine the loss function in the incremental updating stage. Last but no least, our ICD is a general framework which can be applied to most of contemporary cognitive diagnosis models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to investigate the incremental cognitive diagnosis problem with theoretical results about the update condition and a tailored incremental learning strategy.

To our best knowledge, we propose the first differentially private topic mining technique (namely TopicDP) which injects well-calibrated Gaussian noise into the matrix output of any topic mining algorithm to ensure differential privacy and good utility. Specifically, we smoothen the sensitivity for the Gaussian mechanism via sensitivity sampling, which addresses the major challenges resulted from the high sensitivity in topic mining for differential privacy. Furthermore, we theoretically prove the differential privacy guarantee under the Rényi differential privacy mechanism and the utility error bounds of TopicDP. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on two real-word text datasets (Enron email and Amazon Reviews), and the experimental results demonstrate that TopicDP is a model-agnostic framework that can generate better privacy preserving performance for topic mining as compared against other differential privacy mechanisms.|主题挖掘旨在从文本数据（如文档、电子邮件和产品评论）中提取模式与洞察，可应用于意图检测等多个场景。然而，主题挖掘可能对贡献文本语料的用户构成严重隐私威胁，因为攻击者凭借特定背景知识可能从文本数据中重新识别用户身份。据我们所知，我们提出了首个差分隐私主题挖掘技术（命名为TopicDP），该技术通过向任意主题挖掘算法的矩阵输出注入精确校准的高斯噪声，在保证差分隐私的同时维持良好实用性。具体而言，我们通过灵敏度采样机制平滑高斯机制的敏感度，有效解决了差分隐私主题挖掘中因高敏感度带来的核心挑战。此外，我们从理论层面证明了TopicDP在Rényi差分隐私框架下的隐私保障能力，并推导出其效用误差边界。最后，我们在两个真实文本数据集（Enron电子邮件和亚马逊评论）上进行了大量实验，结果表明与其他差分隐私机制相比，TopicDP作为模型无关框架能够为主题挖掘提供更优的隐私保护性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=A+Model-Agnostic+Approach+to+Differentially+Private+Topic+Mining)|0|

Extracting a good representation space is critical to address the curse of dimensionality, improve model generalization, overcome data sparsity, and increase the availability of classic models. Existing literature, such as feature engineering and representation learning, is limited in achieving full automation (e.g., over heavy reliance on intensive labor and empirical experiences), explainable explicitness (e.g., traceable reconstruction process and explainable new features), and flexible optimal (e.g., optimal feature space reconstruction is not embedded into downstream tasks). Can we simultaneously address the automation, explicitness, and optimal challenges in representation space reconstruction for a machine learning task? To answer this question, we propose a group-wise reinforcement generation perspective. We reformulate representation space reconstruction into an interactive process of nested feature generation and selection, where feature generation is to generate new meaningful and explicit features, and feature selection is to eliminate redundant features to control feature sizes. We develop a cascading reinforcement learning method that leverages three cascading Markov Decision Processes to learn optimal generation policies to automate the selection of features and operations and the feature crossing. We design a group-wise generation strategy to cross a feature group, an operation, and another feature group to generate new features and find the strategy that can enhance exploration efficiency and augment reward signals of cascading agents.

|[Partial Label Learning with Discrimination Augmentation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539363)|Wei Wang, MinLing Zhang|Southeast Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210096, Peoples R China|Partial label learning is a weakly supervised learning framework where each training example is associated with multiple candidate labels, among which only one is valid. Existing works on partial label learning mainly focus on classification model induction by disambiguating candidate label sets in the output space. Nevertheless, the feature representations of partial label training examples may be less informative of the ground-truth labels, which may result in negative influences on the disambiguation process. To circumvent this difficulty, the first attempt towards discrimination augmentation for partial label learning is investigated in this paper. The feature space is enriched with confidence-rated class prototype features to replenish discriminative characteristics of the underlying ground-truth labels for partial label training examples. Specially, an optimization formulation is proposed to jointly optimize the class prototype and estimate the labeling confidence over partial label training examples, which enforces both global consistency in the feature space and local consistency in the label space. We show that the class prototypes and the labeling confidence can be solved via alternating optimization.

|[An Embedded Feature Selection Framework for Control](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539290)|Jiawen Wei, Fangyuan Wang, Wanxin Zeng, Wenwei Lin, Ning Gui|Zhejiang Sci Tech Univ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; Cent South Univ, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China|Reducing sensor requirements while keeping optimal control performance is crucial to many industrial control applications to achieve robust, low-cost, and computation-efficient controllers. However, existing feature selection solutions for the typical machine learning domain can hardly be applied in the domain of control with changing dynamics. In this paper, a novel framework, namely the Dual-world embedded Attentive Feature Selection (D-AFS), can efficiently select the most relevant sensors for the system under dynamic control. Rather than the one world used in most Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms, D-AFS has both the real world and its virtual peer with twisted features. By analyzing the DRL's response in two worlds, D-AFS can quantitatively identify respective features' importance towards control. A well-known active flow control problem, cylinder drag reduction, is used for evaluation. Results show that D-AFS successfully finds an optimized five-probes layout with 18.7% drag reduction than the state-of-the-art solution with 151 probes and 49.2% reduction than five-probes layout by human experts. We also apply this solution to four OpenAI classical control cases. In all cases, D-AFS achieves the same or better sensor configurations than originally provided solutions. Results highlight, we argued, a new way to achieve efficient and optimal sensor designs for experimental or industrial systems.

Document-level relation extraction task aims to extract the relations within a document and poses many challenges to the RE tasks as it requires reasoning across sentences and handling multiple relations expressed in the same document. Existing state-of-the-art document-level RE models use the graph structure to better connect long-distance correlations. In this work, we propose SagDRE model, which further considers and captures the original sequential information from the text. The proposed model learns sentence-level directional edges to capture the information flow in the document and uses the token-level sequential information to encode the shortest paths from one entity to the other. In addition, we propose an adaptive margin loss to address the long-tailed multi-label problem of document-level RE tasks, where multiple relations can be expressed in a document for an entity pair and there are a few popular relations. The loss function aims to encourage separations between positive and negative classes.

A central modeling objective in such settings is to forecast the intensity, frequency, and timing of extreme and non-extreme events; yet in the context of deep learning, this objective presents several key challenges. First, a deep learning framework applied to such data must unify a mixture of distributions characterizing the zero events, moderate events, and extreme events. Second, the framework must be capable of enforcing parameter constraints across each component of the mixture distribution. Finally, the framework must be flexible enough to accommodate for any changes in the threshold used to define an extreme event after training. To address these challenges, we propose Deep Extreme Mixture Model (DEMM), fusing a deep learning-based hurdle model with extreme value theory to enable point and distribution prediction of zero-inflated, heavy-tailed spatiotemporal variables. The framework enables users to dynamically set a threshold for defining extreme events at inference-time without the need for retraining. We present an extensive experimental analysis applying DEMM to precipitation forecasting, and observe significant improvements in point and distribution prediction.

De Loera|Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA|Recently discovered polyhedral structures of the value function for finite discounted Markov decision processes (MDP) shed light on understanding the success of reinforcement learning. We investigate the value function polytope in greater detail and characterize the polytope boundary using a hyperplane arrangement. We further show that the value space is a union of finitely many cells of the same hyperplane arrangement, and relate it to the polytope of the classical linear programming formulation for MDPs. Inspired by these geometric properties, we propose a new algorithm, Geometric Policy Iteration (GPI), to solve discounted MDPs. GPI updates the policy of a single state by switching to an action that is mapped to the boundary of the value function polytope, followed by an immediate update of the value function. This new update rule aims at a faster value improvement without compromising computational efficiency. Moreover, our algorithm allows asynchronous updates of state values which is more flexible and advantageous compared to traditional policy iteration when the state set is large. We prove that the complexity of GPI achieves the best known bound O|𝓐|over 1 - γ log 1 over 1-γ of policy iteration and empirically demonstrate the strength of GPI on MDPs of various sizes.|最近研究发现，有限折扣马尔可夫决策过程（MDP）价值函数的多面体结构为理解强化学习的成功提供了新视角。我们通过超平面配置深入分析了价值函数多面体，并精确刻画了其边界特征。研究进一步表明，价值空间是该超平面配置有限个胞腔的并集，且与经典MDP线性规划公式的多面体存在内在关联。受这些几何性质的启发，我们提出了一种新算法——几何策略迭代（GPI）来解决折扣MDP问题。GPI通过将单个状态的策略切换至映射到价值函数多面体边界的动作来更新策略，并同步即时更新价值函数。这种新更新规则在保持计算效率的同时，实现了更快速的价值提升。此外，当状态集规模较大时，本算法支持状态值的异步更新，相比传统策略迭代更具灵活性和优势。我们证明GPI的复杂度达到了策略迭代的最优已知界O(|𝓐|/(1-γ) · log(1/(1-γ)))，并通过不同规模MDP的实验验证了GPI的优越性能。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Geometric+Policy+Iteration+for+Markov+Decision+Processes)|0|

However, as an extension of deep learning models to graphs, GNNs are vulnerable to noise or adversarial attacks due to the underlying perturbations propagating in message passing scheme, which can affect the ultimate performances dramatically. Thus, it's vital to study a robust GNN framework to defend against various perturbations. In this paper, we propose a Robust Tensor Graph Convolutional Network (RT-GCN) model to improve the robustness. On the one hand, we utilize multi-view augmentation to reduce the augmentation variance and organize them as a third-order tensor, followed by the truncated T-SVD to capture the low-rankness of the multi-view augmented graph, which improves the robustness from the perspective of graph preprocessing. On the other hand, to effectively capture the inter-view and intra-view information on the multi-view augmented graph, we propose tensor GCN (TGCN) framework and analyze the mathematical relationship between TGCN and vanilla GCN, which improves the robustness from the perspective of model architecture.

In real-world ordinal regression problems, we usually have plenty of unlabeled data but a limited number of labeled ordered data. Although recent research works have shown that directly optimizing AUC can impose a better ranking on the data than optimizing traditional error rate, it is still an open question to design an efficient semi-supervised ordinal regression AUC maximization algorithm based on CKN with convergence guarantee. To address this question, in this paper, we propose a new semi-supervised ordinal regression CKN algorithm (S^2 CKNOR) with end-to-end AUC maximization. Specifically, we decompose the ordinal regression into a series of binary classification subproblems and propose an unbiased non-convex objective function to optimize AUC, such that both labeled and unlabeled data can be used to enhance the model performance. Further, we propose a nested alternating minimization algorithm to solve the non-convex objective, where each (convex) subproblem is solved by a quadruply stochastic gradient algorithm, and the non-convex one is solved by the stochastic projected gradient method. Importantly, we prove that our S^2 CKNOR algorithm can finally converge to a critical point of the non-convex objective. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our S^2 CKNOR achieves the best AUC results on various real-world datasets.|卷积核网络(CKN)已被提出用于解决图像分类任务，相比传统神经网络展现出更具竞争力的性能，同时具有易训练性和抗过拟合鲁棒性。在实际序数回归问题中，我们通常拥有大量未标记数据但仅有少量带标记的有序数据。尽管近期研究表明直接优化AUC比优化传统错误率能对数据施加更好的排序效果，但如何设计基于CKN且具有收敛保证的高效半监督序数回归AUC最大化算法仍是一个开放性问题。针对该问题，本文提出一种新型端到端AUC最大化的半监督序数回归CKN算法(S²CKNOR)。具体而言，我们将序数回归分解为一系列二分类子问题，并提出无偏非凸目标函数来优化AUC，使得标记与未标记数据均可用于提升模型性能。进一步地，我们提出嵌套交替最小化算法求解该非凸目标：其中每个(凸)子问题通过四重随机梯度算法求解，非凸问题则通过随机投影梯度法处理。重要的是，我们证明了S²CKNOR算法最终能收敛至非凸目标的临界点。大量实验结果表明，我们的S²CKNOR在多个真实数据集上取得了最优的AUC结果。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=End-to-End+Semi-Supervised+Ordinal+Regression+AUC+Maximization+with+Convolutional+Kernel+Networks)|0|

There are tens of services, and each service runs a set of homogeneous containers with dynamic resource usage; containers of a service are scheduled daily in a batch fashion. This problem can be naturally formulated as Stochastic Bin Packing Problem (SBPP). However, traditional SBPP research often focuses on cases of empty machines, whose objective, i.e., to minimize the number of used machines, is not well-defined for the more common reality with nonempty machines. This paper aims to close this gap. First, we define a new objective metric, Used Capacity at Confidence (UCaC), which measures the maximum used resources at a probability and is proved to be consistent for both empty and nonempty machines and reformulate the SBPP under chance constraints. Second, by modeling the container resource usage distribution in a generative approach, we reveal that UCaC can be approximated with Gaussian, which is verified by trace data of real-world applications. Third, we propose an exact solver by solving the equivalent cutting stock variant as well as two heuristics-based solvers -- UCaC best fit, bi-level heuristics.

Specifically, to effectively capture the task-relevant information via RSDs, CRESP introduces an auxiliary task---that is, predicting the characteristic functions of RSDs---to learn task-relevant representations, because we can well approximate the high-dimensional distributions by leveraging the corresponding characteristic functions. Experiments demonstrate that CRESP significantly improves the performance of generalization on unseen environments, outperforming several state-of-the-arts on DeepMind Control tasks with different visual distractions.|在真实场景中成功应用视觉强化学习（RL）的关键在于实现相同任务下跨环境泛化能力。然而，高维观测中常见的视觉干扰会损害视觉RL中学到的表征，从而降低泛化性能。为解决该问题，我们提出一种新方法——特征奖励序列预测（CRESP），通过学习奖励序列分布（RSD）来提取任务相关信息，因为奖励信号在RL中与任务相关且对视觉干扰具有不变性。具体而言，为通过RSD有效捕捉任务相关信息，CRESP引入预测RSD特征函数的辅助任务来学习任务相关表征，因为利用特征函数可以很好地逼近高维分布。实验表明，CRESP在未见环境中的泛化性能显著提升，在具有不同视觉干扰的DeepMind Control任务上优于多种现有先进方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Learning+Task-relevant+Representations+for+Generalization+via+Characteristic+Functions+of+Reward+Sequence+Distributions)|0|

However, the great flexibility in the table layout hinders the machine from understanding this valuable data. In order to unlock and utilize knowledge from tables, extracting data as numerical tuples is the first and critical step. As a form of relational data, numerical tuples have direct and transparent relationships between their elements and are therefore easy for machines to use. Extracting numerical tuples requires a deep understanding of intricate correlations between cells. The correlations are presented implicitly in texts and visual appearances of tables, which can be roughly classified into Hierarchy and Juxtaposition. Although many studies have made considerable progress in data extraction from tables, most of them only consider hierarchical relationships but neglect the juxtapositions. Meanwhile, they only evaluate their methods on relatively small corpora. This paper proposes a new framework to extract numerical tuples from tables and evaluate it on a large test set. Specifically, we convert this task into a relation extraction problem between cells. To represent cells with their intricate correlations in tables, we propose a BERT-based pre-trained language model, TableLM, to encode tables with diverse layouts. To evaluate the framework, we collect a large finance dataset that includes 19,264 tables and 604K tuples. Extensive experiments on the dataset are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of our framework compared to a well-designed baseline.|表格在互联网及各类垂直领域中无处不在，存储着海量高价值数据。然而表格布局的强灵活性阻碍了机器对这类宝贵数据的理解。为释放并利用表格中的知识，将数据提取为数值元组是首要且关键的一步。作为关系型数据的一种形式，数值元组各元素间存在直接透明的关系，便于机器直接使用。数值元组提取需要深入理解单元格间复杂的关联关系，这些关联通过文本和表格视觉外观隐式呈现，可大致归类为层级关系与并列关系。尽管已有研究在表格数据提取方面取得显著进展，但多数方法仅考虑层级关系而忽略了并列关系，同时仅在较小规模数据集上进行评估。本文提出了一种从表格中提取数值元组的新框架，并在大规模测试集上完成验证。具体而言，我们将该任务转化为单元格间的关系抽取问题，并提出基于BERT的预训练语言模型TableLM来表征具有复杂关联的表格数据。为评估框架性能，我们构建了包含19,264张表格和60.4万个元组的大型金融数据集，通过大量实验证明了该框架相较于精心设计的基线模型的优越性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Numerical+Tuple+Extraction+from+Tables+with+Pre-training)|0|

Caterino, Ping Zhang|Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; Ohio State Univ, Wexner Med Ctr, Columbus, OH USA|Despite intense efforts in basic and clinical research, an individualized ventilation strategy for critically ill patients remains a major challenge. Recently, dynamic treatment regime (DTR) with reinforcement learning (RL) on electronic health records (EHR) has attracted interest from both the healthcare industry and machine learning research community. However, most learned DTR policies might be biased due to the existence of confounders. Although some treatment actions non-survivors received may be helpful, if confounders cause the mortality, the training of RL models guided by long-term outcomes (e.g., 90-day mortality) would punish those treatment actions causing the learned DTR policies to be suboptimal. In this study, we develop a new deconfounding actor-critic network (DAC) to learn optimal DTR policies for patients. To alleviate confounding issues, we incorporate a patient resampling module and a confounding balance module into our actor-critic framework. To avoid punishing the effective treatment actions non-survivors received, we design a short-term reward to capture patients' immediate health state changes. Combining short-term with long-term rewards could further improve the model performance. Moreover, we introduce a policy adaptation method to successfully transfer the learned model to new-source small-scale datasets. The experimental results on one semi-synthetic and two different real-world datasets show the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art models.

Consequently, the effectiveness of gradient-based methods for this problem still awaits improvement. In this paper, we propose a gradient-based optimization method named LeapAttack to craft high-quality text adversarial examples in the hard-label setting. To specify, LeapAttack employs the word embedding space to characterize the semantic deviation between the two words of each perturbed substitution by their difference vector. Facilitated by this expression, LeapAttack gradually updates the perturbation direction and constructs adversarial examples in an iterative round trip: firstly, the gradient is estimated by transforming randomly sampled word candidates to continuous difference vectors after moving the current adversarial example near the decision boundary; secondly, the estimated gradient is mapped back to a new substitution word based on the cosine similarity metric. Extensive experimental results show that in the general case LeapAttack can efficiently generate high-quality text adversarial examples with the highest semantic similarity and the lowest perturbation rate in the hard-label setting.|在硬标签设定下生成文本对抗样本是一个更现实且更具挑战性的黑盒对抗攻击问题，其挑战性源于无法直接从离散词语替换中计算梯度。因此，基于梯度的优化方法在该问题上的有效性仍有待提升。本文提出一种名为LeapAttack的梯度优化方法，用于在硬标签设定下生成高质量文本对抗样本。具体而言，该方法通过词嵌入空间中的差值向量来表征每个被替换词与原词之间的语义偏差。基于这种表达方式，LeapAttack通过迭代循环逐步更新扰动方向并构建对抗样本：首先通过将随机采样的候选词转换为连续差值向量，并将当前对抗样本移动至决策边界附近来估计梯度；随后基于余弦相似度度量将估计梯度映射回新的替换词。大量实验结果表明，在通用场景下，LeapAttack能够在硬标签设定下高效生成具有最高语义相似度和最低扰动率的高质量文本对抗样本。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=LeapAttack:+Hard-Label+Adversarial+Attack+on+Text+via+Gradient-Based+Optimization)|0|

Recent studies have shown that Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have the potential to shed light on this task. However, existing GAN-based models are limited by the sparsity of urban data and instability in model training, hampering their applications. Here, we propose a GAN framework with geographical knowledge, namely Metropolitan GAN (MetroGAN), for urban morphology simulation. We incorporate a progressive growing structure to learn hierarchical features and design a geographical loss to impose the constraints of water areas. Besides, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework for the complex structure of urban systems. Results show that MetroGAN outperforms the state-of-the-art urban simulation methods by over 20% in all metrics. Inspiringly, using physical geography features singly, MetroGAN can still generate shapes of the cities. These results demonstrate that MetroGAN solves the instability problem of previous urban simulation GANs and is generalizable to deal with various urban attributes.|在城市科学领域，如何通过区位属性模拟城市形态始终是项具有挑战性的任务。近期研究表明，生成对抗网络（GAN）有望为此提供解决方案。然而现有基于GAN的模型受限于城市数据稀疏性与训练不稳定性，制约了其实际应用。本文提出融合地理知识的生成对抗网络框架MetroGAN，用于实现城市形态模拟。我们采用渐进式生长结构学习层次化特征，并设计地理约束损失函数强化水域边界限制。此外，针对城市系统的复杂结构提出了综合评估框架。实验表明，MetroGAN在所有评估指标上均优于现有城市模拟方法20%以上。值得关注的是，仅使用自然地理特征时，MetroGAN仍能生成完整的城市轮廓。这些结果证明，MetroGAN成功解决了先前城市模拟GAN的不稳定问题，并具备处理多样化城市属性的泛化能力。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=MetroGAN:+Simulating+Urban+Morphology+with+Generative+Adversarial+Network)|0|
|[MT-FlowFormer: A Semi-Supervised Flow Transformer for Encrypted Traffic Classification](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539314)|Ruijie Zhao, Xianwen Deng, Zhicong Yan, Jun Ma, Zhi Xue, Yijun Wang|Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China|With the increasing demand for the protection of personal network meta-data, encrypted networks have grown in popularity, so do the challenge of monitoring and analyzing encrypted network traffic. Currently, some deep learning-based methods have been proposed to leverage statistical features for encrypted traffic classification, which are barely affected by encryption techniques. However, these works still suffer from two main intrinsic limitations: (1) the feature extraction process lacks a mechanism to take into account correlations between flows in the flow sequence; and (2) a large volume of manually-labeled data is required for training an effective deep classifier. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised framework to address these problems. To be specific, an efficient classifier with attention mechanism is proposed to extract features from flow sequences with low computational cost. Then, a Mean Teacher-style semi-supervised framework is adopted to exploit the unlabeled traffic data, where a spatiotemporal data augmentation method is designed as the key component to explore the spatial and temporal relationship within the unlabeled traffic data. Experimental results on two real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods with a large margin.|随着个人网络元数据保护需求的日益增长，加密网络日益普及，加密网络流量的监测与分析也面临更大挑战。当前已有一些基于深度学习的方法利用统计特征进行加密流量分类，这些方法基本不受加密技术影响。然而这些研究仍存在两个固有局限性：(1) 特征提取过程缺乏考虑流序列中多流间相关性的机制；(2) 训练有效深度分类器需要大量人工标注数据。本文提出新型半监督框架以解决这些问题：首先设计具有注意力机制的高效分类器，以较低计算成本从流序列中提取特征；其次采用均值教师式半监督框架开发未标注流量数据价值，其中关键组件是设计的时空数据增强方法，用于挖掘未标注流量数据中的时空关联。在两个真实流量数据集上的实验表明，本方法以显著优势超越现有最优方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=MT-FlowFormer:+A+Semi-Supervised+Flow+Transformer+for+Encrypted+Traffic+Classification)|0|

In this paper, we study the problem of model integrity authentication in tree models. In general, the task of model integrity authentication is the design & implementation of mechanisms for checking/detecting whether the model deployed for the end-users has been tampered with or compromised, e.g., malicious modifications on the model. We propose an authentication framework that enables the model builders/distributors to embed a signature to the tree model and authenticate the existence of the signature by only making a small number of black-box queries to the model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of signature embedding on tree models. Our proposed method simply locates a collection of leaves and modifies their prediction values, which does not require any training/testing data nor any re-training. The experiments on a large number of public classification datasets confirm that the proposed signature embedding process has a high success rate while only introducing a minimal accuracy loss.|树模型在机器学习和数据挖掘实践中应用极为广泛。本文研究树模型中的模型完整性认证问题。总体而言，模型完整性认证的任务旨在设计并实现能够检测终端用户所部署模型是否遭受篡改或破坏（例如对模型的恶意修改）的机制。我们提出了一种认证框架，允许模型构建者/分发者向树模型嵌入数字签名，并仅通过对模型进行少量黑盒查询即可验证签名的存在。据我们所知，这是首个针对树模型签名嵌入的研究。我们提出的方法仅需定位一组叶节点并修改其预测值，既不需要任何训练/测试数据，也无需重新训练模型。在大量公开分类数据集上的实验证实，所提出的签名嵌入方法在仅引入极小精度损失的同时，具有极高的成功率。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Integrity+Authentication+in+Tree+Models)|0|
|[Instant Graph Neural Networks for Dynamic Graphs](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539352)|Yanping Zheng, Hanzhi Wang, Zhewei Wei, Jiajun Liu, Sibo Wang||Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used for modeling graph-structured data. With the development of numerous GNN variants, recent years have witnessed groundbreaking results in improving the scalability of GNNs to work on static graphs with millions of nodes. However, how to instantly represent continuous changes of large-scale dynamic graphs with GNNs is still an open problem. Existing dynamic GNNs focus on modeling the periodic evolution of graphs, often on a snapshot basis. Such methods suffer from two drawbacks: first, there is a substantial delay for the changes in the graph to be reflected in the graph representations, resulting in losses on the model's accuracy; second, repeatedly calculating the representation matrix on the entire graph in each snapshot is predominantly time-consuming and severely limits the scalability. In this paper, we propose Instant Graph Neural Network (InstantGNN), an incremental computation approach for the graph representation matrix of dynamic graphs. Set to work with dynamic graphs with the edge-arrival model, our method avoids time-consuming, repetitive computations and allows instant updates on the representation and instant predictions. Graphs with dynamic structures and dynamic attributes are both supported. The upper bounds of time complexity of those updates are also provided. Furthermore, our method provides an adaptive training strategy, which guides the model to retrain at moments when it can make the greatest performance gains. We conduct extensive experiments on several real-world and synthetic datasets. Empirical results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while having orders-of-magnitude higher efficiency than existing methods.|图神经网络（GNN）已被广泛应用于图结构数据的建模。随着众多GNN变体的发展，近年来在提升GNN可扩展性方面取得了突破性进展，使其能够处理包含数百万节点的静态图。然而，如何利用GNN即时表征大规模动态图的连续变化仍是一个开放性问题。现有动态GNN主要关注基于快照的图周期性演化建模，这类方法存在两个缺陷：首先，图结构变化反映到图表示中存在显著延迟，导致模型准确度损失；其次，在每个快照中重复计算全图表示矩阵耗时严重，极大限制了可扩展性。本文提出即时图神经网络（InstantGNN），一种针对动态图表示矩阵的增量计算方法。本方法基于边到达模型的动态图设计，避免了耗时的重复计算，支持表示矩阵的即时更新与瞬时预测，同时适用于动态结构和动态属性的图数据。我们给出了更新操作的时间复杂度上界，并提出自适应训练策略，指导模型在能获得最大性能提升的时刻进行重训练。通过在多个真实数据集和合成数据集上的广泛实验，实证结果表明我们的模型在达到最优精度的同时，较现有方法实现了数量级提升的效率。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Instant+Graph+Neural+Networks+for+Dynamic+Graphs)|0|

First, conduct a dimension reduction of the input cell profile matrix; second, cluster the cells in the latent space; and third, extract the "gene panels" that distinguish a certain cluster from others. This workflow has the primary drawback that the three steps are performed independently, neglecting the dependencies among the steps and among the marker genes or gene panels. In our system, KRATOS, we alter the three-step workflow to a two-step one, where we jointly optimize the first two steps and add the third (interpretability) step to form an integrated sc-RNA-seq analysis pipeline. We show that the more compact workflow of KRATOS extracts marker genes that can better discriminate the target cluster, distilling underlying mechanisms guiding cluster membership. In doing so, KRATOS is significantly better than the two SOTA baselines we compare against, specifically 5.62% superior to Global Counterfactual Explanation (GCE) [ICML-20], and 3.31% better than Adversarial Clustering Explanation (ACE) [ICML-21], measured by the AUROC of a kernel-SVM classifier.

A molecule can be viewed as a 2D graph with nodes/atoms connected by edges/bonds, and can also be represented by a 3D conformation with 3-dimensional coordinates of all atoms. We note that most previous work handles 2D and 3D information separately, while jointly leveraging these two sources may foster a more informative representation. In this work, we explore this appealing idea and propose a new representation learning method based on a unified 2D and 3D pre-training. Atom coordinates and interatomic distances are encoded and then fused with atomic representations through graph neural networks. The model is pre-trained on three tasks: reconstruction of masked atoms and coordinates, 3D conformation generation conditioned on 2D graph, and 2D graph generation conditioned on 3D conformation. We evaluate our method on 11 downstream molecular property prediction tasks: 7 with 2D information only and 4 with both 2D and 3D information. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on 10 tasks, and the average improvement on 2D-only tasks is 8.3%.

People are free to interact with acquaintances, express and exchange their own opinions through commenting, liking, retweeting on online social media, leading to resistance, controversy and other important phenomena over controversial social issues, which have been the subject of many recent works. In this paper, we study the problem of minimizing risk of conflict in social networks by modifying the initial opinions of a small number of nodes. We show that the objective function of the combinatorial optimization problem is monotone and supermodular. We then propose a naive greedy algorithm with a (1-1/e) approximation ratio that solves the problem in cubic time. To overcome the computation challenge for large networks, we further integrate several effective approximation strategies to provide a nearly linear time algorithm with a (1-1/e-ε) approximation ratio for any error parameter ε>0. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate both the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithms. In particular, the fast one scales to large networks with more than two million nodes, and achieves up to 20x speed-up over the state-of-the-art algorithm.|随着在线社交媒体平台的广泛普及，个体间的互动程度得到了前所未有的提升。人们通过评论、点赞和转发等方式自由地与熟人互动，表达并交换观点，从而在有争议的社会议题上引发对立、争论等重要现象，这也成为近期众多研究的焦点。本文研究如何通过调整少量节点的初始观点来最小化社交网络中的冲突风险。我们证明了该组合优化问题的目标函数具有单调性和超模性，进而提出一种朴素贪心算法，以三次方时间复杂度获得(1-1/e)的近似比。为应对大规模网络的计算挑战，我们进一步整合多种有效近似策略，提出近似线性时间算法，在任意误差参数ε>0的情况下实现(1-1/e-ε)的近似比。基于多个真实数据集的实验表明，我们的算法在效能和效率方面均表现优异。其中快速算法可扩展至超过200万个节点的大规模网络，相比现有最优算法实现最高20倍的加速比。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=A+Nearly-Linear+Time+Algorithm+for+Minimizing+Risk+of+Conflict+in+Social+Networks)|0|

|[BrainNet: Epileptic Wave Detection from SEEG with Hierarchical Graph Diffusion Learning](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539178)|Junru Chen, Yang Yang, Tao Yu, Yingying Fan, Xiaolong Mo, Carl Yang|Emory Univ, Atlanta, GA USA; Neuroechos Med, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; Zhejiang Univ, Hangzhou, Peoples R China|Epilepsy is one of the most serious neurological diseases, affecting 1-2% of the world's population. The diagnosis of epilepsy depends heavily on the recognition of epileptic waves, i.e., disordered electrical brainwave activity in the patient's brain. Existing works have begun to employ machine learning models to detect epileptic waves via cortical electroencephalogram (EEG), which refers to brain data obtained from a noninvasive examination performed on the patient's scalp surface to record electrical activity in the brain. However, the recently developed stereoelectrocorticography (SEEG) method provides information in stereo that is more precise than conventional EEG, and has been broadly applied in clinical practice. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the first data-driven study to detect epileptic waves in a real-world SEEG dataset. While offering new opportunities, SEEG also poses several challenges. In clinical practice, epileptic wave activities are considered to propagate between different regions in the brain. These propagation paths, also known as the epileptogenic network, are deemed to be a key factor in the context of epilepsy surgery. However, the question of how to extract an exact epileptogenic network for each patient remains an open problem in the field of neuroscience. Moreover, the nature of epileptic waves and SEEG data inevitably leads to extremely imbalanced labels and severe noise. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model (BrainNet) that jointly learns the dynamic diffusion graphs and models the brain wave diffusion patterns. In addition, our model effectively aids in resisting label imbalance and severe noise by employing several self-supervised learning tasks and a hierarchical framework. By experimenting with the extensive real SEEG dataset obtained from multiple patients, we find that BrainNet outperforms several latest state-of-the-art baselines derived from time-series analysis.|癫痫是最严重的神经系统疾病之一，全球约1-2%的人口受其影响。癫痫诊断主要依赖于癫痫波的识别，即患者大脑中异常放电的脑电活动。现有研究已开始采用机器学习模型通过皮层脑电图（EEG）检测癫痫波——这种无创检查通过头皮表面记录大脑电活动获取数据。然而，最新发展的立体定向脑电图（SEEG）技术能提供比传统EEG更精确的立体信息，目前已广泛应用于临床实践。为此，我们开展了首个数据驱动研究，在真实世界SEEG数据集中检测癫痫波。  SEEG在带来新机遇的同时也面临多重挑战。临床实践中，癫痫波活动被认为在大脑不同区域间传播，这种被称为致痫网络的传播路径是癫痫手术的关键因素。但如何精确提取每位患者的致痫网络，仍是神经科学领域的开放性问题。此外，癫痫波的特性和SEEG数据的本质必然导致极端不平衡的标签和严重噪声。  为应对这些挑战，我们提出名为BrainNet的新型模型，该模型能联合学习动态扩散图并模拟脑电波扩散模式。通过采用多重自监督学习任务和分层框架，我们的模型能有效缓解标签不平衡和强噪声干扰。基于多患者的大规模真实SEEG数据集实验表明，BrainNet在癫痫波检测任务上优于多个基于时间序列分析的最新基线模型。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=BrainNet:+Epileptic+Wave+Detection+from+SEEG+with+Hierarchical+Graph+Diffusion+Learning)|0|

We frame this research question as contradicted entailment reasoning through question answering (QA). We first ask questions towards the false claim and retrieve potential answers from the relevant evidence documents. Then, we identify the most contradictory answer to the false claim by use of an entailment classifier. Finally, a counterfactual explanation is created using a matched QA pair with three different counterfactual explanation forms. Experiments are conducted on the FEVER dataset for both system and human evaluations.

|[Precise Mobility Intervention for Epidemic Control Using Unobservable Information via Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539195)|Tao Feng, Tong Xia, Xiaochen Fan, Huandong Wang, Zefang Zong, Yong Li|Tsinghua Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China; Univ Cambridge, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Cambridge, England|To control the outbreak of COVID-19, efficient individual mobility intervention for EPidemic Control (EPC) strategies are of great importance, which cut off the contact among people at epidemic risks and reduce infections by intervening the mobility of individuals. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is powerful for decision making, however, there are two major challenges in developing an RL-based EPC strategy: (1) the unobservable information about asymptomatic infections in the incubation period makes it difficult for RL's decision-making, and (2) the delayed rewards for RL causes the deficiency of RL learning. Since the results of EPC are reflected in both daily infections (including unobservable asymptomatic infections) and long-term cumulative cases of COVID-19, it is quite daunting to design an RL model for precise mobility intervention. In this paper, we propose a Variational hiErarcHICal reinforcement Learning method for Epidemic control via individual-level mobility intervention, namely Vehicle. To tackle the above challenges, Vehicle first exploits an information rebuilding module that consists of a contact-risk bipartite graph neural network and a variational LSTM to restore the unobservable information. The contact-risk bipartite graph neural network estimates the possibility of an individual being an asymptomatic infection and the risk of this individual spreading the epidemic, as the current state of RL. Then, the Variational LSTM further encodes the state sequence to model the latency of epidemic spreading caused by unobservable asymptomatic infections.

Pereira, Marco Pavone|Tech Univ Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark; Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Google Res, Brain Team, San Francisco, CA USA|Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD) systems represent an attractive alternative to existing transportation paradigms, currently challenged by urbanization and increasing travel needs. By centrally controlling a fleet of self-driving vehicles, these systems provide mobility service to customers and are currently starting to be deployed in a number of cities around the world. Current learning-based approaches for controlling AMoD systems are limited to the single-city scenario, whereby the service operator is allowed to take an unlimited amount of operational decisions within the same transportation system. However, real-world system operators can hardly afford to fully re-train AMoD controllers for every city they operate in, as this could result in a high number of poor-quality decisions during training, making the single-city strategy a potentially impractical solution. To address these limitations, we propose to formalize the multi-city AMoD problem through the lens of meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) and devise an actor-critic algorithm based on recurrent graph neural networks. In our approach, AMoD controllers are explicitly trained such that a small amount of experience within a new city will produce good system performance. Empirically, we show how control policies learned through meta-RL are able to achieve near-optimal performance on unseen cities by learning rapidly adaptable policies, thus making them more robust not only to novel environments, but also to distribution shifts common in real-world operations, such as special events, unexpected congestion, and dynamic pricing schemes.|自动驾驶按需出行系统（AMoD）作为现有交通模式的有力替代方案，正面临城市化进程加速和出行需求增长的双重挑战。该系统通过集中调度自动驾驶车队为用户提供出行服务，目前已在全球多个城市开始部署。现有基于学习的AMoD控制方法仅限于单城场景，即服务运营商可在同一交通系统内实施无限次运营决策。然而，现实中的系统运营商难以针对每个运营城市全面重新训练AMoD控制器——这不仅会导致训练期间产生大量低质量决策，更使得单城策略可能缺乏实际可行性。  为突破这些限制，我们提出通过元强化学习框架对多城市AMoD问题进行形式化建模，并设计了一种基于循环图神经网络的行动者-评论者算法。该方法的创新之处在于：通过针对性训练使AMoD控制器仅需在新城市获取少量经验即可实现卓越系统性能。实验结果表明，基于元强化学习的控制策略能通过快速自适应机制在未知城市实现近乎最优的性能表现。这种特性不仅增强了系统对新环境的适应能力，还显著提升了其对现实运营中常见分布偏移的鲁棒性——包括特殊事件、突发拥堵及动态定价方案等多种复杂场景。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Graph+Meta-Reinforcement+Learning+for+Transferable+Autonomous+Mobility-on-Demand)|0|

Predicting the food preparation time (FPT) of each order accurately is very significant for the courier and customer experience over the platform. However, there are two challenges, namely incomplete label and huge uncertainty in FPT data, to make the prediction of FPT in practice. In this paper, we apply probabilistic forecasting to FPT for the first time and propose a non-parametric method based on deep learning. Apart from the data with precise label of FPT, we make full use of the lower/upper bound of orders without precise label, during feature extraction and model construction. A number of categories of meaningful features are extracted based on the detailed data analysis to produce sharp probability distribution.

Specifically, we compute the docking energies between auxiliary unknown TCR-peptide pairs as surrogate training labels. Then, we use these extended example-label pairs to train our model in a supervised fashion. Finally, we find that the AUC score for the prediction of the model can be further improved by pseudo-labeling of such unknown TCR-peptide pairs (by a trained teacher model), and re-training the model with those pseudo-labeled TCR-peptide pairs.

Training an MTL model requires having the training data for all tasks available at the same time. As systems usually evolve over time, (e.g., to support new functionalities), adding a new task to an existing MTL model usually requires retraining the model from scratch on all the tasks and this can be time-consuming and computationally expensive. Moreover, in some scenarios, the data used to train the original training may be no longer available, for example, due to storage or privacy concerns. In this paper, we approach the problem of incrementally expanding MTL models' capability to solve new tasks over time by distilling the knowledge of an already trained model on n tasks into a new one for solving n+1 tasks. To avoid catastrophic forgetting, we propose to exploit unlabeled data from the same distributions of the old tasks. Our experiments on publicly available benchmarks show that such a technique dramatically benefits the distillation by preserving the already acquired knowledge (i.e., preventing up to 20% performance drops on old tasks) while obtaining good performance on the incrementally added tasks. Further, we also show that our approach is beneficial in practical settings by using data from a leading voice assistant.|多任务学习（Multi-Task Learning, MTL）作为在单一模型中学习多个相关任务的标准技术，已在自然语言处理领域获得广泛认可。训练MTL模型通常需要同时获取所有任务的训练数据。由于系统通常会随时间不断演进（例如需支持新功能），向现有MTL模型添加新任务时，往往需要重新对所有任务进行全量训练，这不仅耗时且计算成本高昂。此外在某些场景下，初始训练所用的数据可能因存储限制或隐私问题而无法继续使用。本文通过知识蒸馏方法，将已训练完成的n任务模型知识迁移至可处理n+1任务的新模型，以解决MTL模型随时间推移逐步扩展能力的问题。为规避灾难性遗忘，我们提出利用来自旧任务相同分布的无标注数据进行训练。在公开基准测试上的实验表明，该技术通过有效保持已获得的知识（即在旧任务上防止性能下降高达20%），同时在新增量任务上取得良好性能，显著提升了蒸馏效果。此外，通过采用领先语音助手的数据进行验证，我们也证明了该方法在实际应用场景中的有效性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Preventing+Catastrophic+Forgetting+in+Continual+Learning+of+New+Natural+Language+Tasks)|0|

In this paper, we tackle the task of taxonomy entity translation, which is to translate the names of taxonomy entities in a source language to a target language. The translations then can be utilized to build a knowledge graph in the target language. Despite its importance, taxonomy entity translation remains a hard problem for AI models due to two major challenges. One challenge is understanding the semantic context in very short entity names. Another challenge is having deep understanding for the domain where the knowledge graph is built. We present TaxoTrans, a novel method for taxonomy entity translation that can capture the context in entity names and the domain knowledge in taxonomy. To achieve this, TaxoTrans creates a heterogeneous graph to connect entities, and formulates the entity name translation problem as link prediction in the heterogeneous graph: given a pair of entity names across two languages, TaxoTrans applies a graph neural network to determine whether they form a translation pair or not. Because of this graph, TaxoTrans can capture both the semantic context and the domain knowledge. Our offline experiments on LinkedIn's skill and title taxonomies show that by modeling semantic information and domain knowledge in the heterogeneous graph, TaxoTrans outperforms the state-of-the-art translation methods by ∼10%.

Its approximated inference cost is no more than a single forward- and back-propagation through the target model without requiring any additional detection module.

Counterfactual reasoning in such scenarios requires decoupling the effects of confounding physiological characteristics that affect baseline survival rates from the effects of the interventions being assessed. In this paper, we present a latent variable approach to model heterogeneous treatment effects by proposing that an individual can belong to one of latent clusters with distinct response characteristics. We show that this latent structure can mediate the base survival rates and help determine the effects of an intervention.

While we have state-of-the-art models to predict likelihood of an outcome, being able to pinpoint to the entity responsible for the outcome is also important. For example, in an e-commerce setup, a lost package detection system needs to infer the reason or location (delivery station, sort center, trucks) in case of a missing item, a network management system would like to diagnose nodes that are faulty based on end-end packet flow traces or a compiler needs to point out the exact location of a code that is erroneous. In this paper, we present an Attention based neural architecture for entity localization to accurately pinpoint the location of package loss in delivery network and bugs in erroneous programs. Our model performs well in scenarios where there is no annotation/ground truth for entities for localization. It can also adapt itself if annotations/ground truth is available for even a subset of entities by leveraging semi-supervision. The core of our model is a ladder-style architecture that helps us achieve state-of-the-art performance in both entity localization and detection. Further, to show the generality of our approach, we demonstrate its performance on a bug localization task for software programs.

As all data on the Internet are encapsulated and transferred by network packets, packets are widely used for various network traffic analysis tasks, from application identification to intrusion detection. Considering the choice of features and how to represent them can greatly affect the performance of downstream tasks, it is critical to learn highquality packet representations. In addition, existing packet-level works ignore packet representations but focus on trying to get good performance with independent analysis of different classification tasks. In the real world, although a packet may have different class labels for different tasks, the packet representation learned from one task can also help understand its complex packet patterns in other tasks, while existing works omit to leverage them. Taking advantage of this potential, in this work, we propose a novel framework to tackle the problem of packet representation learning for various traffic classification tasks. We learn packet representation, preserving both semantic and byte patterns of each packet, and utilize contrastive loss with a sample selector to optimize the learned representations so that similar packets are closer in the latent semantic space. In addition, the representations are further jointly optimized by class labels of multiple tasks with loss of reconstructed representations and of class probabilities. Evaluations demonstrate that the learned packet representation of our proposed framework can outperform the state-of-the-art baseline methods on extensive popular downstream classification tasks by a wide margin in both the close-world and open-world scenario.|随着信息技术的迅猛发展，为提供高质量网络服务，网络分析领域面临着日益增长的需求与挑战。由于互联网中所有数据均通过网络数据包进行封装传输，数据包被广泛应用于各类网络流量分析任务——从应用识别到入侵检测。考虑到特征选择及其表征方式会显著影响下游任务性能，学习高质量的数据包表征至关重要。现有数据包层级的研究大多忽视表征学习，而专注于通过独立分析不同分类任务以获取良好性能。现实中，尽管同一数据包在不同任务中可能具有不同类别标签，但从某一任务学习到的数据包表征同样有助于理解其在其他任务中的复杂数据包模式，而现有研究未能充分利用这一特性。  基于此潜在优势，本文提出一种创新框架以解决面向多类流量分类任务的数据包表征学习问题。我们通过学习同时保留每个数据包的语义特征与字节模式，并采用带有样本选择器的对比损失来优化学习到的表征，使得相似数据包在潜在语义空间中更加接近。此外，通过多任务类别标签、重构表征损失与类别概率损失的联合优化，进一步强化表征效果。实验评估表明，在封闭环境与开放环境两种场景下，我们框架所学习的数据包表征在大量主流下游分类任务中均显著优于当前最先进的基线方法。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Packet+Representation+Learning+for+Traffic+Classification)|0|

Given a dataset which records information about the spread of a disease over a set of locations, we consider the problem of identifying both the disease's intrinsic waves (temporal patterns) and their respective spatial epicenters. To do so we introduce a new method of spatio-temporal decomposition which we call diffusion NMF (D-NMF). Building upon classic matrix factorization methods, D-NMF takes into consideration a spatial structuring of locations (features) in the data and supports the idea that locations which are spatially close are more likely to experience the same set of waves. To illustrate the use of D-NMF, we analyze Covid case data at various spatial granularities. Our results demonstrate that D-NMF is very useful in separating the waves of an epidemic and identifying a few centers for each wave.|本文提出了一种用于分析疾病（如新冠疫情）传播模式的框架。给定记录某疾病在一组区域传播信息的数据集，我们研究了如何同时识别疾病的内在传播波（时间模式）及其相应的空间震中。为此，我们提出了一种称为扩散非负矩阵分解（D-NMF）的新型时空分解方法。该方法基于经典矩阵分解技术，充分考虑了数据中区域（特征）的空间结构，并遵循空间相邻区域更可能经历相同传播波组的理念。为展示D-NMF的实际应用，我们分析了不同空间粒度下的新冠病例数据。结果表明，该方法能有效分离流行病的传播波，并为每个传播波确定若干核心区域。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Characterizing+Covid+Waves+via+Spatio-Temporal+Decomposition)|0|

Predicting the service time is fundamental for many downstream logistics applications, e.g., route planning with time windows, courier workload balancing and delivery time prediction. Nevertheless, it is non-trivial given the complex delivery circumstances, location heterogeneity, and skewed observations in space. The existing solution trains a supervised model based on aggregated features extracted from parcels to deliver, which cannot handle above challenges well. In this paper, we propose MetaSTP, a meta-learning based neural network model to predict the service time. MetaSTP treats the service time prediction at each location as a learning task, leverages a Transformer-based representation layer to encode the complex delivery circumstances, and devises a model-based meta-learning method enhanced by location prior knowledge to reserve the uniqueness of each location and handle the imbalanced distribution issue. Experiments show MetaSTP outperforms baselines by at least 9.5% and 7.6% on two real-world datasets.

Current dispatching methods in ridehailing platforms are dominantly based on myopic or rule-based nonmyopic approaches. Reinforcement learning enables dispatching policies that are informed of historical data and able to employ the learned information to optimize returns of expected future trajectories. Previous studies in this field yielded promising results, yet have left room for further improvements in terms of performance gain, self-dependency, transferability, and scalable deployment mechanisms. The present study proposes a standalone RL-based dispatching solution that is equipped with multiple novel mechanisms to ensure robust and efficient on-policy learning and inference while being adaptable for full-scale deployment. In particular, a new form of value updating based on temporal difference is proposed that is more adapted to the inherent uncertainty of the problem. For the driver-order assignment problem, a customized utility function is proposed that when tuned based on the statistics of the market, results in remarkable performance improvement and interpretability. In addition, for reducing the risk of cancellation after drivers’ assignment, an adaptive graph pruning strategy based on the multiarm bandit problem is introduced. The method is evaluated using offline simulation with real data and yields notable performance improvement. In addition, the algorithm is deployed online in multiple cities under DiDi’s operation for A/B testing and more recently, is launched in one of the major international markets as the primary mode of dispatch. The deployed algorithm shows over 1.3% improvement in total driver income from A/B testing. In addition, by causal inference analysis, as much as 5.3% improvement in major performance metrics is detected after full-scale deployment.|本研究提出了一种基于强化学习的可扩展实时调度算法，并首次实现大规模应用。当前网约车平台的调度方法主要采用短视或基于规则的非短视策略，而强化学习能够基于历史数据构建调度策略，并利用习得信息优化未来预期收益轨迹。该领域先前研究虽取得显著成果，但在性能增益、自主性、可迁移性及规模化部署机制方面仍存在提升空间。本研究提出了一种独立的强化学习调度方案，通过多项创新机制确保在策略学习与推理的鲁棒性和高效性，同时适应全规模部署需求。具体而言：提出了一种更适配问题固有不确定性的新型时差价值更新方法；针对司机-订单分配问题设计了定制化效用函数，基于市场统计数据调参后可实现显著性能提升与可解释性增强；为降低派单后取消风险，引入了基于多臂赌博机问题的自适应图剪枝策略。通过真实数据离线仿真验证，该方法展现出显著性能提升。该算法已在滴滴运营的多个城市进行在线A/B测试，近期更在某个重要国际市场作为核心派单模式全面上线。A/B测试数据显示，部署该算法使司机总收入提升超1.3%；通过因果推断分析发现，全面部署后核心绩效指标最高提升达5.3%。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Reinforcement+Learning+in+the+Wild:+Scalable+RL+Dispatching+Algorithm+Deployed+in+Ridehailing+Marketplace)|0|

Shad Akhtar, Tanmoy Chakraborty|Mpathic AI, Seattle, WA USA; IIIT Delhi, Delhi, India|The psychotherapy intervention technique is a multifaceted conversation between a therapist and a patient. Unlike general clinical discussions, psychotherapy's core components (viz. symptoms) are hard to distinguish, thus becoming a complex problem to summarize later. A structured counseling conversation may contain discussions about symptoms, history of mental health issues, or the discovery of the patient's behavior. It may also contain discussion filler words irrelevant to a clinical summary. We refer to these elements of structured psychotherapy as counseling components. In this paper, the aim is mental health counseling summarization to build upon domain knowledge and to help clinicians quickly glean meaning. We create a new dataset after annotating 12.9K utterances of counseling components and reference summaries for each dialogue. Further, we propose ConSum, a novel counseling-component guided summarization model. ConSum undergoes three independent modules. First, to assess the presence of depressive symptoms, it filters utterances utilizing the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), while the second and third modules aim to classify counseling components. At last, we propose a problem-specific Mental Health Information Capture (MHIC) evaluation metric for counseling summaries. Our comparative study shows that we improve on performance and generate cohesive, semantic, and coherent summaries. We comprehensively analyze the generated summaries to investigate the capturing of psychotherapy elements. Human and clinical evaluations on the summary show that ConSum generates quality summary.

On the other hand, mobile game cheating, aiming to gain improper advantages by using programs that simulate the players' inputs, severely damages the game's fairness and harms the user experience. Therefore, detecting mobile game cheating is of great importance for mobile game companies. Many PC game-oriented cheating detection methods have been proposed in the past decades, however, they can not be directly adopted in mobile games due to the concern of privacy, power, and memory limitations of mobile devices. Even worse, in practice, the cheating programs are quickly updated, leading to the label scarcity for novel cheating patterns. To handle such issues, we in this paper introduce a mobile game cheating detection framework, namely FCDGame, to detect the cheats under the few-shot learning framework. FCDGame only consumes the screen sensor data, recording users' touch trajectories, which is less sensitive and more general for almost all mobile games. Moreover, a Hierarchical Trajectory Encoder and a Cross-pattern Meta Learner are designed in FCDGame to capture the intrinsic characters of mobile games and solve the label scarcity problem, respectively. Extensive experiments on two real online games show that FCDGame achieves almost 10% improvements in detection accuracy with only few fine-tuned samples.|随着智能手机的兴起，移动游戏已吸引数十亿玩家并占据游戏公司大部分市场份额。然而，旨在通过模拟玩家输入程序获取不正当优势的移动游戏作弊行为，严重损害游戏公平性并破坏用户体验。因此，移动游戏作弊检测对游戏公司至关重要。过去数十年间虽涌现诸多面向PC游戏的作弊检测方案，但由于移动设备在隐私保护、功耗及内存方面的限制，这些方法无法直接移植至移动端。更严峻的是，作弊程序在实际应用中快速迭代，导致新型作弊模式面临标签稀缺的困境。为此，本文提出名为FCDGame的移动游戏作弊检测框架，通过小样本学习机制实现作弊行为检测。该框架仅需调用屏幕传感器数据（记录用户触控轨迹），这种数据敏感度低且适用于几乎所有移动游戏。FCDGame创新性地设计了层次化轨迹编码器与跨模式元学习器，分别用于捕捉移动游戏本质特征和解决标签稀缺问题。在两个真实在线游戏上的大量实验表明，仅需少量微调样本，FCDGame的检测准确率即可提升近10%。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Few-shot+Learning+for+Trajectory-based+Mobile+Game+Cheating+Detection)|0|

With the increasing number of surveillance cameras and the advanced developments in edge computing, video tasks prefer to run on edge devices close to cameras due to the constraints of bandwidth, latency, and privacy concerns. However, resource-constrained edge devices are not competent for dynamic traffic loads with resource-intensive video analysis models. To address this challenge, we propose RT-VeD, a real-time VoI detection system based on the limited resources of edge nodes. RT-VeD utilizes multi-granularity computer vision models with different resource-accuracy trade-offs. It schedules vehicle tasks based on a traffic-aware actor-critic framework to maximize the accuracy of VoI detection while ensuring an inference time-bound.

The operator is time-sensitive as it must be able to adapt the results as traffic conditions change. We first prove the NP-hardness of the problem, and then propose a range of effective approximate solutions that have rapid response times. Specifically, we first build a lookup table that stores the trajectories covered by each edge in a given road network. Rather than performing a depth-first search for all possible routes, we find a 1/η approximate solution by developing a maximum-weight algorithm. Since each edge in a route may be close to several trajectories, we further propose a coverage-first algorithm to locate the edges with the greatest coverage gain in the solution route set. By observing that in the real world each edge is connected to only a few other edges in a road network, we have developed a connect-first algorithm that finds consecutive edges for k representative routes by greedily selecting edges with the maximum marginal gain for each route. Finally, comprehensive experiments over two real-world datasets are conducted to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithms, and provide evidence of the usefulness of our solution and rapid response times in traffic monitoring tasks.|本研究致力于探索如何从大规模轨迹数据中提取k条最具代表性的路径，该基础性操作对交通监控与公共交通规划等现实应用具有重要意义。由于需根据实时交通状况动态调整结果，该操作具有较强时效性要求。我们首先证明了该问题的NP难性质，进而提出一系列响应迅速的有效近似解法。具体而言，首先构建存储路网中各边轨迹覆盖率的查找表，通过设计最大权重算法获得1/η近似解，从而避免全路径深度优先搜索。考虑到路径中的边可能邻近多条轨迹，进一步提出覆盖优先算法以定位解路径集中具有最大覆盖增益的边。基于现实路网中边连接稀疏性的观察，我们开发了连接优先算法，通过贪婪选择每条路径中具有最大边际增益的边来构建k条代表性路径的连续边序列。最后，在两个真实数据集上的综合实验验证了所提算法的高效性与有效性，同时证明了我们的解决方案在交通监控任务中具有显著实用价值与快速响应能力。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Representative+Routes+Discovery+from+Massive+Trajectories)|0|
|[Connecting the Hosts: Street-Level IP Geolocation with Graph Neural Networks](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539049)|Zhiyuan Wang, Fan Zhou, Wenxuan Zeng, Goce Trajcevski, Chunjing Xiao, Yong Wang, Kai Chen|Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Beijing, Peoples R China; Henan Univ, Kaifeng, Peoples R China; Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; Iowa State Univ, Iowa City, IA USA|Pinpointing the geographic location of an IP address is important for a range of location-aware applications spanning from targeted advertising to fraud prevention. The majority of traditional measurement-based and recent learning-based methods either focus on the efficient employment of topology or utilize data mining to find clues of the target IP in publicly available sources. Motivated by the limitations in existing works, we propose a novel framework named GraphGeo, which provides a complete processing methodology for street-level IP geolocation with the application of graph neural networks. It incorporates IP hosts knowledge and kinds of neighborhood relationships into the graph to infer spatial topology for high-quality geolocation prediction. We explicitly consider and alleviate the negative impact of uncertainty caused by network jitter and congestion, which are pervasive in complicated network environments. Extensive evaluations across three large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that GraphGeo significantly reduces the geolocation errors compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the proposed framework has been deployed on the web platform as an online service for 6 months.|精确定位IP地址的地理位置对于从定向广告到欺诈防范等一系列位置感知应用具有重要意义。现有基于传统测量的方法与近期基于学习的方法大多聚焦于拓扑结构的高效利用，或通过数据挖掘从公开来源中寻找目标IP的线索。受现有研究局限性的启发，我们提出名为GraphGeo的新型框架，该框架通过应用图神经网络为街道级IP地理定位提供完整的处理方法。该框架将IP主机知识与多种邻域关系整合至图中，通过推断空间拓扑关系实现高质量的地理位置预测。我们明确考虑并缓解了网络抖动和拥塞所引发的不确定性负面影响——这些现象在复杂网络环境中普遍存在。基于三个大规模真实数据集的广泛评估表明，GraphGeo相比现有最优方法显著降低了地理定位误差。此外，该框架已在网络平台作为在线服务稳定运行6个月。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Connecting+the+Hosts:+Street-Level+IP+Geolocation+with+Graph+Neural+Networks)|0|
|[Graph2Route: A Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Network for Pick-up and Delivery Route Prediction](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539084)|Haomin Wen, Youfang Lin, Xiaowei Mao, Fan Wu, Yiji Zhao, Haochen Wang, Jianbin Zheng, Lixia Wu, Haoyuan Hu, Huaiyu Wan|Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Cainiao Network, Beijing, Peoples R China; Cainiao Network, Beijing, Peoples R China; Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Beijing Key Lab Traff Data Anal & Min, Beijing, Peoples R China; Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China|Pick-up and delivery (P&D) services such as food delivery have achieved explosive growth in recent years by providing customers with daily-life convenience. Though many service providers have invested considerably in routing tools, more and more practitioners realize that significant deviations exist between workers' actual routes and planned ones. So it is not wise to feed "optimal routes" as workers' actual service routes into downstream tasks (e.g., arrival-time prediction and order dispatching), whose performances count on the accuracy of route prediction, i.e., to predict the future service route of a worker's unfinished tasks. Therefore, to meet the rising calling for route prediction models that can capture workers' future routing behaviors, in this paper, we formulate the Pick-up and Delivery Route Prediction task (PDRP task for short) from the graph perspective for the first time, then propose a dynamic spatial-temporal graph-based model, named Graph2Route. Unlike previous sequence-based models, our model leverages the underlying graph structure and features into the encoding and decoding process. Moreover, the dynamic graph-based nature can spontaneously describe the evolving relationship between different problem instances. As a result, abundant decision context information and various spatial-temporal information of node/edge can be fully utilized in Graph2Route to improve the prediction performance. Offline experiments over two real-world industry-scale datasets under different P&D services (i.e., food delivery and package pick-up) and online A/B test demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model.|近年来，外卖等取送货服务通过提供生活便利实现了爆发式增长。尽管许多服务商在路径规划工具上投入了大量资源，但越来越多的从业者意识到，配送人员的实际路线与规划路线存在显著偏差。因此，将"最优路线"直接作为配送人员的实际服务路线输入下游任务（如到达时间预测和订单分配）并非明智之举——这些任务的性能恰恰依赖于路线预测的准确性，即预测配送人员未完成任务的未来服务路线。为响应日益增长的对能够捕捉配送人员未来路径行为的预测模型需求，本文首次从图结构视角构建取送货路线预测任务，提出名为Graph2Route的动态时空图模型。与以往基于序列的模型不同，我们的模型在编码和解码过程中充分融合了底层图结构与特征。此外，动态图架构能自发描述不同问题实例间的演化关系。得益于此，Graph2Route可充分利用丰富的决策情境信息与节点/边的多样化时空特征来提升预测性能。在两类实际工业级取送服务场景（外卖配送与包裹取件）下的离线实验及在线A/B测试，均验证了所提出模型的优越性。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Graph2Route:+A+Dynamic+Spatial-Temporal+Graph+Neural+Network+for+Pick-up+and+Delivery+Route+Prediction)|0|
|[Perioperative Predictions with Interpretable Latent Representation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3534678.3539190)|Bing Xue, York Jiao, Thomas George Kannampallil, Bradley A. Fritz, Christopher Ryan King, Joanna Abraham, Michael Avidan, Chenyang Lu|Washington Univ, Sch Med, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; Washington Univ, McKelvey Sch Engn, St Louis, MO 63110 USA|Given the risks and cost of hospitalization, there has been significant interest in exploiting machine learning models to improve perioperative care. However, due to the high dimensionality and noisiness of perioperative data, it remains a challenge to develop accurate and robust encoding for surgical predictions. Furthermore, it is important for the encoding to be interpretable by perioperative care practitioners to facilitate their decision making process. We proposeclinical variational autoencoder (cVAE), a deep latent variable model that addresses the challenges of surgical applications through two salient features. (1) To overcome performance limitations of traditional VAE, it isprediction-guided with explicit expression of predicted outcome in the latent representation. (2) Itdisentangles the latent space so that it can be interpreted in a clinically meaningful fashion. We apply cVAE to two real-world perioperative datasets to evaluate its efficacy and performance in predicting outcomes that are important to perioperative care, including postoperative complication and surgery duration. To demonstrate the generality and facilitate reproducibility, we also apply cVAE to the open MIMIC-III dataset for predicting ICU duration and mortality. Our results show that the latent representation provided by cVAE leads to superior performance in classification, regression and multi-task predictions. The two features of cVAE are mutually beneficial and eliminate the need of a predictor. We further demonstrate the interpretability of the disentangled representation and its capability to capture intrinsic characteristics of hospitalized patients. While this work is motivated by and evaluated in the context of clinical applications, the proposed approach may be generalized for other fields using high-dimensional and noisy data and valuing interpretable representations.|考虑到住院治疗的风险与成本，利用机器学习模型改善围手术期护理已引起广泛关注。然而，由于围手术期数据的高维性和噪声干扰，开发适用于手术预测的精准且鲁棒的编码表示仍面临挑战。此外，编码结果需具备可解释性，以辅助围手术期医护人员的临床决策。我们提出临床变分自编码器（cVAE），该深度潜变量模型通过两个显著特性应对手术应用中的挑战：（1）为克服传统VAE的性能局限，模型采用预测引导机制，在潜表征中显式表达预测结果；（2）通过解耦潜空间使其能够以临床可解释的方式呈现。我们将cVAE应用于两个真实世界围手术期数据集，评估其在预测术后并发症和手术时长等关键指标中的效能。为验证普适性并促进可复现性，同时将cVAE应用于公开的MIMIC-III数据集进行ICU住院时长和死亡风险预测。实验结果表明，cVAE提供的潜表征在分类、回归及多任务预测中均实现卓越性能。模型的两个特性形成协同效应，无需额外预测器即可完成端到端学习。我们进一步论证了解耦表征的可解释性及其捕捉住院患者内在临床特征的能力。尽管本研究基于临床需求开展验证，但所提方法可推广至其他需要处理高维噪声数据且重视可解释表征的领域。|[code](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=Perioperative+Predictions+with+Interpretable+Latent+Representation)|0|
