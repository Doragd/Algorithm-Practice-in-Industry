        "summary": "The rise of machine learning (ML) systems has exacerbated their carbon\nfootprint due to increased capabilities and model sizes. However, there is\nscarce knowledge on how the carbon footprint of ML models is actually measured,\nreported, and evaluated. In light of this, the paper aims to analyze the\nmeasurement of the carbon footprint of 1,417 ML models and associated datasets\non Hugging Face, which is the most popular repository for pretrained ML models.\nThe goal is to provide insights and recommendations on how to report and\noptimize the carbon efficiency of ML models. The study includes the first\nrepository mining study on the Hugging Face Hub API on carbon emissions. This\nstudy seeks to answer two research questions: (1) how do ML model creators\nmeasure and report carbon emissions on Hugging Face Hub?, and (2) what aspects\nimpact the carbon emissions of training ML models? The study yielded several\nkey findings. These include a decreasing proportion of carbon\nemissions-reporting models, a slight decrease in reported carbon footprint on\nHugging Face over the past 2 years, and a continued dominance of NLP as the\nmain application domain. Furthermore, the study uncovers correlations between\ncarbon emissions and various attributes such as model size, dataset size, and\nML application domains. These results highlight the need for software\nmeasurements to improve energy reporting practices and promote carbon-efficient\nmodel development within the Hugging Face community. In response to this issue,\ntwo classifications are proposed: one for categorizing models based on their\ncarbon emission reporting practices and another for their carbon efficiency.\nThe aim of these classification proposals is to foster transparency and\nsustainable model development within the ML community.",

        "summary": "Recently, model-based retrieval has emerged as a new paradigm in text\nretrieval that discards the index in the traditional retrieval model and\ninstead memorizes the candidate corpora using model parameters. This design\nemploys a sequence-to-sequence paradigm to generate document identifiers, which\nenables the complete capture of the relevance between queries and documents and\nsimplifies the classic indexretrieval-rerank pipeline. Despite its attractive\nqualities, there remain several major challenges in model-based retrieval,\nincluding the discrepancy between pre-training and fine-tuning, and the\ndiscrepancy between training and inference. To deal with the above challenges,\nwe propose a novel two-stage model-based retrieval approach called TOME, which\nmakes two major technical contributions, including the utilization of tokenized\nURLs as identifiers and the design of a two-stage generation architecture. We\nalso propose a number of training strategies to deal with the training\ndifficulty as the corpus size increases.

        "summary": "People usually have different intents for choosing items, while their\npreferences under the same intent may also different. In traditional\ncollaborative filtering approaches, both intent and preference factors are\nusually entangled in the modeling process, which significantly limits the\nrobustness and interpretability of recommendation performances. For example,\nthe low-rating items are always treated as negative feedback while they\nactually could provide positive information about user intent. To this end, in\nthis paper, we propose a two-fold representation learning approach, namely\nDouble Disentangled Collaborative Filtering (DDCF), for personalized\nrecommendations. The first-level disentanglement is for separating the\ninfluence factors of intent and preference, while the second-level\ndisentanglement is performed to build independent sparse preference\nrepresentations under individual intent with limited computational complexity.\nSpecifically, we employ two variational autoencoder networks, intent\nrecognition network and preference decomposition network, to learn the intent\nand preference factors, respectively. In this way, the low-rating items will be\ntreated as positive samples for modeling intents while the negative samples for\nmodeling preferences. Finally, extensive experiments on three real-world\ndatasets and four evaluation metrics clearly validate the effectiveness and the\ninterpretability of DDCF.",

        "summary": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated promising outcomes across\nvarious tasks, including node classification and link prediction. Despite their\nremarkable success in various high-impact applications, we have identified\nthree common pitfalls in message passing for link prediction. Particularly, in\nprevalent GNN frameworks (e.g., DGL and PyTorch-Geometric), the target edges\n(i.e., the edges being predicted) consistently exist as message passing edges\nin the graph during training. Consequently, this results in overfitting and\ndistribution shift, both of which adversely impact the generalizability to test\nthe target edges. Additionally, during test time, the failure to exclude the\ntest target edges leads to implicit test leakage caused by neighborhood\naggregation. In this paper, we analyze these three pitfalls and investigate the\nimpact of including or excluding target edges on the performance of nodes with\nvarying degrees during training and test phases. Our theoretical and empirical\nanalysis demonstrates that low-degree nodes are more susceptible to these\npitfalls. These pitfalls can have detrimental consequences when GNNs are\nimplemented in production systems. To systematically address these pitfalls, we\npropose SpotTarget, an effective and efficient GNN training framework. During\ntraining, SpotTarget leverages our insight regarding low-degree nodes and\nexcludes train target edges connected to at least one low-degree node. During\ntest time, it emulates real-world scenarios of GNN usage in production and\nexcludes all test target edges. Our experiments conducted on diverse real-world\ndatasets, demonstrate that SpotTarget significantly enhances GNNs, achieving up\nto a 15x increase in accuracy in sparse graphs. Furthermore, SpotTarget\nconsistently and dramatically improves the performance for low-degree nodes in\ndense graphs.",

Recent studies on this problem focused\nonly on extremely small networks, hence the challenge remains on how to achieve\na scalable solution, applicable to networks with millions or billions of nodes.\nWe propose an approach that is based on learning node representations for fair\nspread from diffusion cascades, instead of the social connectivity s.t. we can\ndeal with very large graphs.

For such purposes, the MMTs' language coverage\nmakes them unnecessarily expensive to deploy in terms of model size, inference\ntime, energy, and hardware cost. We thus propose to extract compressed,\nlanguage-specific models from MMTs which retain the capacity of the original\nMMTs for cross-lingual transfer. This is achieved by distilling the MMT\nbilingually, i.e., using data from only the source and target language of\ninterest. Specifically, we use a two-phase distillation approach, termed\nBiStil: (i) the first phase distils a general bilingual model from the MMT,\nwhile (ii) the second, task-specific phase sparsely fine-tunes the bilingual\n\"student\" model using a task-tuned variant of the original MMT as its\n\"teacher\". We evaluate this distillation technique in zero-shot cross-lingual\ntransfer across a number of standard cross-lingual benchmarks. The key results\nindicate that the distilled models exhibit minimal degradation in target\nlanguage performance relative to the base MMT despite being significantly\nsmaller and faster. Furthermore, we find that they outperform multilingually\ndistilled models such as DistilmBERT and MiniLMv2 while having a very modest\ntraining budget in comparison, even on a per-language basis. We also show that\nbilingual models distilled from MMTs greatly outperform bilingual models\ntrained from scratch. Our code and models are available at\nhttps://github.com/AlanAnsell/bistil.",

        "summary": "Transfer learning - i.e., further fine-tuning a pre-trained model on a\ndownstream task - can confer significant advantages, including improved\ndownstream performance, faster convergence, and better sample efficiency. These\nadvantages have led to a proliferation of task-specific fine-tuned models,\nwhich typically can only perform a single task and do not benefit from one\nanother. Recently, model merging techniques have emerged as a solution to\ncombine multiple task-specific models into a single multitask model without\nperforming additional training. However, existing merging methods often ignore\nthe interference between parameters of different models, resulting in large\nperformance drops when merging multiple models. In this paper, we demonstrate\nthat prior merging techniques inadvertently lose valuable information due to\ntwo major sources of interference: (a) interference due to redundant parameter\nvalues and (b) disagreement on the sign of a given parameter's values across\nmodels. To address this, we propose our method, TrIm, Elect Sign &amp; Merge\n(TIES-Merging), which introduces three novel steps when merging models: (1)\nresetting parameters that only changed a small amount during fine-tuning, (2)\nresolving sign conflicts, and (3) merging only the parameters that are in\nalignment with the final agreed-upon sign. We find that TIES-Merging\noutperforms several existing methods in diverse settings covering a range of\nmodalities, domains, number of tasks, model sizes, architectures, and\nfine-tuning settings.

With the growing concerns of algorithmic fairness, RSs are not only\nexpected to deliver high-quality personalized content, but are also demanded\nnot to discriminate against users based on their demographic information.\nHowever, existing RSs could capture undesirable correlations between sensitive\nfeatures and observed user behaviors, leading to biased recommendations. Most\nfair RSs tackle this problem by completely blocking the influences of sensitive\nfeatures on recommendations. But since sensitive features may also affect user\ninterests in a fair manner (e.g., race on culture-based preferences),\nindiscriminately eliminating all the influences of sensitive features\ninevitably degenerate the recommendations quality and necessary diversities. To\naddress this challenge, we propose a path-specific fair RS (PSF-RS) for\nrecommendations. Specifically, we summarize all fair and unfair correlations\nbetween sensitive features and observed ratings into two latent proxy\nmediators, where the concept of path-specific bias (PS-Bias) is defined based\non path-specific counterfactual inference. Inspired by Pearl's minimal change\nprinciple, we address the PS-Bias by minimally transforming the biased factual\nworld into a hypothetically fair world, where a fair RS model can be learned\naccordingly by solving a constrained optimization problem.

        "summary": "Conversational recommendation systems (CRS) effectively address information\nasymmetry by dynamically eliciting user preferences through multi-turn\ninteractions. Existing CRS widely assumes that users have clear preferences.\nUnder this assumption, the agent will completely trust the user feedback and\ntreat the accepted or rejected signals as strong indicators to filter items and\nreduce the candidate space, which may lead to the problem of over-filtering.\nHowever, in reality, users' preferences are often vague and volatile, with\nuncertainty about their desires and changing decisions during interactions.\n  To address this issue, we introduce a novel scenario called Vague Preference\nMulti-round Conversational Recommendation (VPMCR), which considers users' vague\nand volatile preferences in CRS.VPMCR employs a soft estimation mechanism to\nassign a non-zero confidence score for all candidate items to be displayed,\nnaturally avoiding the over-filtering problem. In the VPMCR setting, we\nintroduce an solution called Adaptive Vague Preference Policy Learning (AVPPL),\nwhich consists of two main components: Uncertainty-aware Soft Estimation (USE)\nand Uncertainty-aware Policy Learning (UPL). USE estimates the uncertainty of\nusers' vague feedback and captures their dynamic preferences using a\nchoice-based preferences extraction module and a time-aware decaying strategy.\nUPL leverages the preference distribution estimated by USE to guide the\nconversation and adapt to changes in users' preferences to make recommendations\nor ask for attributes.\n  Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in the\nVPMCR scenario, highlighting its potential for practical applications and\nimproving the overall performance and applicability of CRS in real-world\nsettings, particularly for users with vague or dynamic preferences.",

With over 2,000 open-ended tasks collected\nfrom 137 websites spanning 31 domains and crowdsourced action sequences for the\ntasks, Mind2Web provides three necessary ingredients for building generalist\nweb agents: 1) diverse domains, websites, and tasks, 2) use of real-world\nwebsites instead of simulated and simplified ones, and 3) a broad spectrum of\nuser interaction patterns.

It involves pre-training an adaptation\nmodule to align the semantics of the vision encoder and language model,\nfollowed by fine-tuning on the instruction-following data. However, despite the\nsuccess of this pipeline in image and language understanding, its effectiveness\nin joint video and language understanding has not been widely explored. In this\npaper, we aim to develop a novel multi-modal foundation model capable of\nperceiving video, image, and language within a general framework. To achieve\nthis goal, we introduce Valley: Video Assistant with Large Language model\nEnhanced ability. Specifically, our proposed Valley model is designed with a\nsimple projection module that bridges video, image, and language modalities,\nand is further unified with a multi-lingual LLM. We also collect multi-source\nvision-text pairs and adopt a spatio-temporal pooling strategy to obtain a\nunified vision encoding of video and image input for pre-training. Furthermore,\nwe generate multi-task instruction-following video data, including multi-shot\ncaptions, long video descriptions, action recognition, causal relationship\ninference, etc. To obtain the instruction-following data, we design diverse\nrounds of task-oriented conversations between humans and videos, facilitated by\nChatGPT. Qualitative examples demonstrate that our proposed model has the\npotential to function as a highly effective multilingual video assistant that\ncan make complex video understanding scenarios easy.

Unfortunately, the process of\ncopying numerical data from one paper to another is prone to human error. In\nthis paper, we propose to meet this challenge through the novel task of\nautomatic table verification (AutoTV), in which the objective is to verify the\naccuracy of numerical data in tables by cross-referencing cited sources. To\nsupport this task, we propose a new benchmark, arXiVeri, which comprises\ntabular data drawn from open-access academic papers on arXiv. We introduce\nmetrics to evaluate the performance of a table verifier in two key areas: (i)\ntable matching, which aims to identify the source table in a cited document\nthat corresponds to a target table, and (ii) cell matching, which aims to\nlocate shared cells between a target and source table and identify their row\nand column indices accurately. By leveraging the flexible capabilities of\nmodern large language models (LLMs), we propose simple baselines for table\nverification. Our findings highlight the complexity of this task, even for\nstate-of-the-art LLMs like OpenAI's GPT-4. The code and benchmark will be made\npublicly available.",

MOFI differs from previous\nwork in two key aspects: ($i$) pre-training data, and ($ii$) training recipe.\nRegarding data, we introduce a new approach to automatically assign entity\nlabels to images from noisy image-text pairs. Our approach involves employing a\nnamed entity recognition model to extract entities from the alt-text, and then\nusing a CLIP model to select the correct entities as labels of the paired\nimage. The approach is simple, does not require costly human annotation, and\ncan be readily scaled up to billions of image-text pairs mined from the web.\nThrough this method, we have created Image-to-Entities (I2E), a new large-scale\ndataset with 1 billion images and 2 million distinct entities, covering rich\nvisual concepts in the wild. Building upon the I2E dataset, we study different\ntraining recipes, including supervised pre-training, contrastive pre-training,\nand multi-task learning. For constrastive pre-training, we treat entity names\nas free-form text, and further enrich them with entity descriptions.\nExperiments show that supervised pre-training with large-scale fine-grained\nentity labels is highly effective for image retrieval tasks, and multi-task\ntraining further improves the performance. The final MOFI model achieves 86.66%\nmAP on the challenging GPR1200 dataset, surpassing the previous\nstate-of-the-art performance of 72.19% from OpenAI's CLIP model. Further\nexperiments on zero-shot and linear probe image classification also show that\nMOFI outperforms a CLIP model trained on the original image-text data,\ndemonstrating the effectiveness of the I2E dataset in learning strong image\nrepresentations.",

The method is a natural decentralized extension\nof memory-efficient Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA).\nEach iteration, each machine seeds a Random Number Generator (RNG) to perform\nlocal reproducible perturbations on model weights and calculate and exchange\nscalar projected gradients, which are then used to update each model. By using\na (machine, sample) identifier as the random seed, each model can regenerate\none another's perturbations. As machines only exchange single-byte projected\ngradients, this is highly communication efficient. There are also potential\nprivacy benefits, as projected gradients may be calculated on different\ntraining data, and models never access the other's data. Our approach not only\ndrastically reduces communication bandwidth requirements but also accommodates\ndynamic addition or removal of machines during the training process and retains\nthe memory-efficient and inference-only advantages of recent work.

As directly optimizing\nuser retention is challenging, multiple evaluation metrics are often employed.\nExisting methods generally formulate the optimization of these evaluation\nmetrics as a multitask learning problem, but often overlook the fact that user\npreferences for different tasks are personalized and change over time.\nIdentifying and tracking the evolution of user preferences can lead to better\nuser retention. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of \"user\nlifecycle\", consisting of multiple stages characterized by users' varying\npreferences for different tasks. We propose a novel Stage-Adaptive Network\n(STAN) framework for modeling user lifecycle stages. STAN first identifies\nlatent user lifecycle stages based on learned user preferences, and then\nemploys the stage representation to enhance multi-task learning performance.\nOur experimental results using both public and industrial datasets demonstrate\nthat the proposed model significantly improves multi-task prediction\nperformance compared to state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the importance\nof considering user lifecycle stages in recommendation systems. Furthermore,\nonline A/B testing reveals that our model outperforms the existing model,\nachieving a significant improvement of 3.05% in staytime per user and 0.88% in\nCVR.

        "summary": "Transformer models have been widely adopted in various domains over the last\nyears, and especially large language models have advanced the field of AI\nsignificantly. Due to their size, the capability of these networks has\nincreased tremendously, but this has come at the cost of a significant increase\nin necessary compute. Quantization is one of the most effective ways to reduce\nthe computational time and memory consumption of neural networks. Many studies\nhave shown, however, that modern transformer models tend to learn strong\noutliers in their activations, making them difficult to quantize. To retain\nacceptable performance, the existence of these outliers requires activations to\nbe in higher bitwidth or the use of different numeric formats, extra\nfine-tuning, or other workarounds. We show that strong outliers are related to\nvery specific behavior of attention heads that try to learn a \"no-op\" or just a\npartial update of the residual. To achieve the exact zeros needed in the\nattention matrix for a no-update, the input to the softmax is pushed to be\nlarger and larger during training, causing outliers in other parts of the\nnetwork. Based on these observations, we propose two simple (independent)\nmodifications to the attention mechanism - clipped softmax and gated attention.\nWe empirically show that models pre-trained using our methods learn\nsignificantly smaller outliers while maintaining and sometimes even improving\nthe floating-point task performance. This enables us to quantize transformers\nto full INT8 quantization of the activations without any additional effort. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on both language models (BERT,\nOPT) and vision transformers.",

In this work, we\npropose the Retrieval-Pretrained Transformer (RPT), an architecture and\ntraining procedure for jointly training a retrieval-augmented LM from scratch\nfor the task of modeling long texts. Given a recently generated text chunk in a\nlong document, the LM computes query representations, which are then used to\nretrieve earlier chunks in the document, located potentially tens of thousands\nof tokens before. Information from retrieved chunks is fused into the LM\nrepresentations to predict the next target chunk. We train the retriever\ncomponent with a semantic objective, where the goal is to retrieve chunks that\nincrease the probability of the next chunk, according to a reference LM. We\nevaluate RPT on four long-range language modeling tasks, spanning books, code,\nand mathematical writing, and demonstrate that RPT improves retrieval quality\nand subsequently perplexity across the board compared to strong baselines.",

With $k$ hashes for each data vector, the storage would be $B\\times k$\nbits; and when used for large-scale learning, the model size would be\n$2^B\\times k$, which can be expensive. A standard strategy is to use only the\nlowest $b$ bits out of the $B$ bits and somewhat increase $k$, the number of\nhashes. In this study, we propose to re-use the hashes by partitioning the $B$\nbits into $m$ chunks, e.g., $b\\times m =B$. Correspondingly, the model size\nbecomes $m\\times 2^b \\times k$, which can be substantially smaller than the\noriginal $2^B\\times k$.\n  Our theoretical analysis reveals that by partitioning the hash values into\n$m$ chunks, the accuracy would drop. In other words, using $m$ chunks of $B/m$\nbits would not be as accurate as directly using $B$ bits. This is due to the\ncorrelation from re-using the same hash. On the other hand, our analysis also\nshows that the accuracy would not drop much for (e.g.,) $m=2\\sim 4$. In some\nregions, Pb-Hash still works well even for $m$ much larger than 4. We expect\nPb-Hash would be a good addition to the family of hashing methods/applications\nand benefit industrial practitioners.\n  We verify the effectiveness of Pb-Hash in machine learning tasks, for linear\nSVM models as well as deep learning models.

This established practice,\nhowever, does not accurately reflect the reality of conducting a systematic\nreview, because not all included publications have the same influence on the\nfinal outcome of the systematic review. More specifically, if an important\npublication gets excluded or included, this might significantly change the\noverall review outcome, while not including or excluding less influential\nstudies may only have a limited impact. However, in terms of evaluation\nmeasures, all inclusion and exclusion decisions are treated equally and,\ntherefore, failing to retrieve publications with little to no impact on the\nreview outcome leads to the same decrease in recall as failing to retrieve\ncrucial publications. We propose a new evaluation framework that takes into\naccount the impact of the reported study on the overall systematic review\noutcome. We demonstrate the framework by extracting review meta-analysis data\nand estimating outcome effects using predictions from ranking runs on\nsystematic reviews of interventions from CLEF TAR 2019 shared task. We further\nmeasure how closely the obtained outcomes are to the outcomes of the original\nreview if the arbitrary rankings were used. We evaluate 74 runs using the\nproposed framework and compare the results with those obtained using standard\nIR measures.

However, the limited context window of\ncontemporary LLMs makes reasoning over long time horizons difficult. Embodied\ntasks such as those that one might expect a household robot to perform\ntypically require that the planner consider information acquired a long time\nago (e.g., properties of the many objects that the robot previously encountered\nin the environment). Attempts to capture the world state using an LLM's\nimplicit internal representation is complicated by the paucity of task- and\nenvironment-relevant information available in a robot's action history, while\nmethods that rely on the ability to convey information via the prompt to the\nLLM are subject to its limited context window. In this paper, we propose\nStatler, a framework that endows LLMs with an explicit representation of the\nworld state as a form of ``memory'' that is maintained over time. Integral to\nStatler is its use of two instances of general LLMs -- a world-model reader and\na world-model writer -- that interface with and maintain the world state. By\nproviding access to this world state ``memory'', Statler improves the ability\nof existing LLMs to reason over longer time horizons without the constraint of\ncontext length.

However, most of these approaches\nhinge on mapping natural languages to formal languages (e.g., Python, SQL) that\nare more syntactically complete and free of ambiguity. Although effective, they\ndepart from the natural language itself and deviate from the habits of human\nthinking, and instead cater more to the execution mindset of computers. In\ncontrast, we hope to simplify natural language by starting from the concept of\nsymbols in linguistics itself, so that LLMs can learn the common formulation\nand general solution of reasoning problems wrapped in different natural\nsemantics. From this consideration, we propose \\textbf{Meta-Reasoning}, which\nallows LLMs to automatically accomplish semantic-symbol deconstruction, i.e.,\nsemantic resolution, to maximally reduce different questions of certain\nreasoning tasks to similar natural language representation, thus gaining the\nability to learn by analogy and facilitating data-efficient in-context\nlearning. Our experiments show that the Meta-Reasoning paradigm saliently\nenhances LLMs' reasoning performance with fewer demonstrations. They can learn\nnot only reasoning chains but also general solutions to certain types of tasks.\nIn particular, for symbolic reasoning tasks, such as 7-step Tracking Shuffled\nObjects, GPT-3 (text-davinci-002) achieves over 99% accuracy with only one\nMeta-Reasoning demonstration, outperforming all current LLMs with the standard\nchain-of-thought prompting.",

Moreover, conventional matching-based recommendation\nmethods are limited to retrieving and ranking existing jobs in the database,\nrestricting their potential as comprehensive career AI advisors. To this end,\nhere we present GIRL (GeneratIve job Recommendation based on Large language\nmodels), a novel approach inspired by recent advancements in the field of Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs). We initially employ a Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)\nstrategy to instruct the LLM-based generator in crafting suitable Job\nDescriptions (JDs) based on the Curriculum Vitae (CV) of a job seeker.\nMoreover, we propose to train a model which can evaluate the matching degree\nbetween CVs and JDs as a reward model, and we use Proximal Policy Optimization\n(PPO)-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) method to further fine-tine the\ngenerator. This aligns the generator with recruiter feedback, tailoring the\noutput to better meet employer preferences.

In this light, a\ndesired recommendation unlearning method should obtain a similar model as full\nretraining in a more efficient manner, i.e., achieving complete, efficient and\ninnocuous unlearning.

In the light that recent recommender models\nuse historical data for both the constructions of the optimization loss and the\ncomputational graph (e.g., neighborhood aggregation), IFRU jointly estimates\nthe direct influence of unusable data on optimization loss and the spillover\ninfluence on the computational graph to pursue complete unlearning.\nFurthermore, we propose an importance-based pruning algorithm to reduce the\ncost of the influence function.

However, the performance of such retrieval-augmented models is\nlimited by the data quality of their underlying retrieval corpus. In this\npaper, we propose an algorithm based on multilinear extension for evaluating\nthe data importance of retrieved data points. There are exponentially many\nterms in the multilinear extension, and one key contribution of this paper is a\npolynomial time algorithm that computes exactly, given a retrieval-augmented\nmodel with an additive utility function and a validation set, the data\nimportance of data points in the retrieval corpus using the multilinear\nextension of the model's utility function. We further proposed an even more\nefficient ({\\epsilon}, {\\delta})-approximation algorithm. Our experimental\nresults illustrate that we can enhance the performance of large language models\nby only pruning or reweighting the retrieval corpus, without requiring further\ntraining. For some tasks, this even allows a small model (e.g., GPT-JT),\naugmented with a search engine API, to outperform GPT-3.5 (without retrieval\naugmentation). Moreover, we show that weights based on multilinear extension\ncan be computed efficiently in practice (e.g., in less than ten minutes for a\ncorpus with 100 million elements).",

One\ncrucial decision facing practitioners is how, if at all, to curate these\never-larger datasets. For example, the creators of the LAION-5B dataset chose\nto retain only image-caption pairs whose CLIP similarity score exceeded a\ndesignated threshold. In this paper, we propose a new state-of-the-art data\nfiltering approach motivated by our observation that nearly 40% of LAION's\nimages contain text that overlaps significantly with the caption. Intuitively,\nsuch data could be wasteful as it incentivizes models to perform optical\ncharacter recognition rather than learning visual features. However, naively\nremoving all such data could also be wasteful, as it throws away images that\ncontain visual features (in addition to overlapping text). Our simple and\nscalable approach, T-MARS (Text Masking and Re-Scoring), filters out only those\npairs where the text dominates the remaining visual features -- by first\nmasking out the text and then filtering out those with a low CLIP similarity\nscore of the masked image.

One theoretical explanation for this finding is\nSurprisal Theory (Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008), which quantifies a word's\npredictability as its surprisal, i.e. its negative log-probability given a\ncontext. While evidence supporting the predictions of Surprisal Theory have\nbeen replicated widely, most have focused on a very narrow slice of data:\nnative English speakers reading English texts. Indeed, no comprehensive\nmultilingual analysis exists. We address this gap in the current literature by\ninvestigating the relationship between surprisal and reading times in eleven\ndifferent languages, distributed across five language families. Deriving\nestimates from language models trained on monolingual and multilingual corpora,\nwe test three predictions associated with surprisal theory: (i) whether\nsurprisal is predictive of reading times; (ii) whether expected surprisal, i.e.\ncontextual entropy, is predictive of reading times; (iii) and whether the\nlinking function between surprisal and reading times is linear.

Recently, there has been an increasing number\nof studies employing reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the performance of\nlarge language models (LLMs) for code. However, these RL methods have only used\noffline frameworks, limiting their exploration of new sample spaces.\nAdditionally, current approaches that utilize unit test signals are rather\nsimple, not accounting for specific error locations within the code. To address\nthese issues, we proposed RLTF, i.e., Reinforcement Learning from Unit Test\nFeedback, a novel online RL framework with unit test feedback of\nmulti-granularity for refining code LLMs. Our approach generates data in\nreal-time during training and simultaneously utilizes fine-grained feedback\nsignals to guide the model towards producing higher-quality code.

Despite the effectiveness, we argue that current GCL-based\nrecommendation models are still limited as current data augmentation\ntechniques, either structure augmentation or feature augmentation. First,\nstructure augmentation randomly dropout nodes or edges, which is easy to\ndestroy the intrinsic nature of the user-item graph. Second, feature\naugmentation imposes the same scale noise augmentation on each node, which\nneglects the unique characteristics of nodes on the graph. To tackle the above\nlimitations, we propose a novel Variational Graph Generative-Contrastive\nLearning(VGCL) framework for recommendation. Specifically, we leverage\nvariational graph reconstruction to estimate a Gaussian distribution of each\nnode, then generate multiple contrastive views through multiple samplings from\nthe estimated distributions, which builds a bridge between generative and\ncontrastive learning. Besides, the estimated variances are tailored to each\nnode, which regulates the scale of contrastive loss for each node on\noptimization. Considering the similarity of the estimated distributions, we\npropose a cluster-aware twofold contrastive learning, a node-level to encourage\nconsistency of a node's contrastive views and a cluster-level to encourage\nconsistency of nodes in a cluster.

This paper presents the\nintroduction of a framework called \\textit{Ashaar}\nhttps://github.com/ARBML/Ashaar, which encompasses a collection of datasets and\npre-trained models designed specifically for the analysis and generation of\nArabic poetry. The pipeline established within our proposed approach\nencompasses various aspects of poetry, such as meter, theme, and era\nclassification. It also incorporates automatic poetry diacritization, enabling\nmore intricate analyses like automated extraction of the \\textit{Arudi} style.\nAdditionally, we explore the feasibility of generating conditional poetry\nthrough the pre-training of a character-based GPT model. Furthermore, as part\nof this endeavor, we provide four datasets: one for poetry generation, another\nfor diacritization, and two for Arudi-style prediction. These datasets aim to\nfacilitate research and development in the field of Arabic poetry by enabling\nresearchers and enthusiasts to delve into the nuances of this rich literary\ntradition.",

This achieved\nby extending a system with support to monitor and adapt itself to achieve\nspecific concerns of interest. Communication in these systems is key given that\nin scenarios involving agent interaction, it enhances cooperation and reduces\ncoordination challenges by enabling direct, clear information exchange.\nHowever, improving the expressiveness of the interaction communication with\nMASs is not without challenges. In this sense, the interplay between\nself-adaptive systems and effective communication is crucial for future MAS\nadvancements. In this paper, we propose the integration of large language\nmodels (LLMs) such as GPT-based technologies into multiagent systems. We anchor\nour methodology on the MAPE-K model, which is renowned for its robust support\nin monitoring, analyzing, planning, and executing system adaptations in\nresponse to dynamic environments.

However, it hinges on a huge amount of image-text pairs, which\nrequires tedious and costly curation. On the contrary, weakly-supervised VLP\n(W-VLP) explores means with object tags generated by a pre-trained object\ndetector (OD) from images. Yet, they still require paired information, i.e.\nimages and object-level annotations, as supervision to train an OD.\n  To further reduce the amount of supervision, we propose Prompts-in-The-Loop\n(PiTL) that prompts knowledge from large language models (LLMs) to describe\nimages. Concretely, given a category label of an image, e.g. refinery, the\nknowledge, e.g. a refinery could be seen with large storage tanks, pipework,\nand ..., extracted by LLMs is used as the language counterpart. The knowledge\nsupplements, e.g. the common relations among entities most likely appearing in\na scene. We create IN14K, a new VL dataset of 9M images and 1M descriptions of\n14K categories from ImageNet21K with PiTL. Empirically, the VL models\npre-trained with PiTL-generated pairs are strongly favored over other W-VLP\nworks on image-to-text (I2T) and text-to-image (T2I) retrieval tasks, with less\nsupervision.

When it comes to text summarization tasks, there are\nnumerous pre-trained transformer models at one's disposal. Consequently, it\nbecomes quite a challenge to discern the most informative and relevant summary\nfor a given text among the various options generated by these pre-trained\nsummarization models. This paper aims to identify the most accurate and\ninformative summary for a given text by utilizing a simple but effective\nranking-based approach that compares the output of four different pre-trained\nBengali text summarization models. The process begins by carrying out\npreprocessing of the input text that involves eliminating unnecessary elements\nsuch as special characters and punctuation marks. Next, we utilize four\npre-trained summarization models to generate summaries, followed by applying a\ntext ranking algorithm to identify the most suitable summary. Ultimately, the\nsummary with the highest ranking score is chosen as the final one. To evaluate\nthe effectiveness of this approach, the generated summaries are compared\nagainst human-annotated summaries using standard NLG metrics such as BLEU,\nROUGE, BERTScore, WIL, WER, and METEOR.

If the explanation is precise, then the model's answer should\nmatch humans' expectations.\n  We implemented two metrics based on counterfactual simulatability: precision\nand generality.

We present a unified user-item\nmatching framework to simultaneously conduct item recommendation and user\ntargeting with just one model. We empirically demonstrate that the above\nconcurrent modeling is viable via modeling the user-item interaction matrix\nwith the multinomial distribution, and propose a bidirectional bias-corrected\nNCE loss for the implementation. The proposed loss function guides the model to\nlearn the user-item joint probability $p(u,i)$ instead of the conditional\nprobability $p(i|u)$ or $p(u|i)$ through correcting both the users and items'\nbiases caused by the in-batch negative sampling.

        "summary": "A typical benchmark dataset for recommender system (RecSys) evaluation\nconsists of user-item interactions generated on a platform within a time\nperiod. The interaction generation mechanism partially explains why a user\ninteracts with (e.g.,like, purchase, rate) an item, and the context of when a\nparticular interaction happened. In this study, we conduct a meticulous\nanalysis on the MovieLens dataset and explain the potential impact on using the\ndataset for evaluating recommendation algorithms. We make a few main findings\nfrom our analysis. First, there are significant differences in user\ninteractions at the different stages when a user interacts with the MovieLens\nplatform. The early interactions largely define the user portrait which affect\nthe subsequent interactions. Second, user interactions are highly affected by\nthe candidate movies that are recommended by the platform's internal\nrecommendation algorithm(s). Removal of interactions that happen nearer to the\nlast few interactions of a user leads to increasing difficulty in learning user\npreference, thus deteriorating recommendation accuracy. Third, changing the\norder of user interactions makes it more difficult for sequential algorithms to\ncapture the progressive interaction process. Based on these findings, we\nfurther discuss the discrepancy between the interaction generation mechanism\nthat is employed by the MovieLens system and that of typical real world\nrecommendation scenarios. In summary, models that achieve excellent\nrecommendation accuracy on the MovieLens dataset may not demonstrate superior\nperformance in practice for at least two kinds of differences: (i) the\ndifferences in the contexts of user-item interaction generation, and (ii) the\ndifferences in user knowledge about the item collections.",

In this\nwork, we set the goal of disentangling version-specific and version-invariant\nfactors, which could make it easier for the model to learn invariant music\nrepresentations for unseen query songs. We analyze the CSI task in a\ndisentanglement view with the causal graph technique, and identify the\nintra-version and inter-version effects biasing the invariant learning.

While proprietary models such as GPT-4 and Claude have demonstrated\nconsiderable advancements in handling tens of thousands of tokens of context,\nopen-sourced models are still in the early stages of experimentation. It also\nremains unclear whether developing these long context models can offer\nsubstantial gains on practical downstream tasks over retrieval-based methods or\nmodels simply trained on chunked contexts. To address this challenge, we\npropose to institute standardized evaluation for long context language models.\nConcretely, we develop L-Eval which contains 411 long documents and over 2,000\nquery-response pairs manually annotated and checked by the authors encompassing\nareas such as law, finance, school lectures, lengthy conversations, news,\nlong-form novels, and meetings. L-Eval also adopts diverse evaluation methods\nand instruction styles, enabling a more reliable assessment of Long Context\nLanguage Models (LCLMs).

        "summary": "Recent work has shown that language models' (LMs) prompt-based learning\ncapabilities make them well suited for automating data labeling in domains\nwhere manual annotation is expensive. The challenge is that while writing an\ninitial prompt is cheap, improving a prompt is costly -- practitioners often\nrequire significant labeled data in order to evaluate the impact of prompt\nmodifications. Our work asks whether it is possible to improve prompt-based\nlearning without additional labeled data. We approach this problem by\nattempting to modify the predictions of a prompt, rather than the prompt\nitself. Our intuition is that accurate predictions should also be consistent:\nsamples which are similar under some feature representation should receive the\nsame prompt prediction. We propose Embroid, a method which computes multiple\nrepresentations of a dataset under different embedding functions, and uses the\nconsistency between the LM predictions for neighboring samples to identify\nmispredictions. Embroid then uses these neighborhoods to create additional\npredictions for each sample, and combines these predictions with a simple\nlatent variable graphical model in order to generate a final corrected\nprediction. In addition to providing a theoretical analysis of Embroid, we\nconduct a rigorous empirical evaluation across six different LMs and up to 95\ndifferent tasks. We find that (1) Embroid substantially improves performance\nover original prompts (e.g., by an average of 7.3 points on GPT-JT), (2) also\nrealizes improvements for more sophisticated prompting strategies (e.g.,\nchain-of-thought), and (3) can be specialized to domains like law through the\nembedding functions.",

However, both settings are coarse-grained\nevaluations, not considering the nature of user instructions that require\ninstance-wise skill composition, which limits the interpretation of the true\ncapabilities of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce FLASK (Fine-grained Language\nModel Evaluation based on Alignment SKill Sets), a fine-grained evaluation\nprotocol that can be used for both model-based and human-based evaluation which\ndecomposes coarse-level scoring to an instance-wise skill set-level.\nSpecifically, we define 12 fine-grained skills needed for LLMs to follow\nopen-ended user instructions and construct an evaluation set by allocating a\nset of skills for each instance.

        "summary": "Visual grounding (VG) aims to establish fine-grained alignment between vision\nand language. Ideally, it can be a testbed for vision-and-language models to\nevaluate their understanding of the images and texts and their reasoning\nabilities over their joint space. However, most existing VG datasets are\nconstructed using simple description texts, which do not require sufficient\nreasoning over the images and texts. This has been demonstrated in a recent\nstudy~\\cite{luo2022goes}, where a simple LSTM-based text encoder without\npretraining can achieve state-of-the-art performance on mainstream VG datasets.\nTherefore, in this paper, we propose a novel benchmark of \\underline{S}cene\n\\underline{K}nowledge-guided \\underline{V}isual \\underline{G}rounding (SK-VG),\nwhere the image content and referring expressions are not sufficient to ground\nthe target objects, forcing the models to have a reasoning ability on the\nlong-form scene knowledge. To perform this task, we propose two approaches to\naccept the triple-type input, where the former embeds knowledge into the image\nfeatures before the image-query interaction; the latter leverages linguistic\nstructure to assist in computing the image-text matching. We conduct extensive\nexperiments to analyze the above methods and show that the proposed approaches\nachieve promising results but still leave room for improvement, including\nperformance and interpretability.

In this work, we propose to inject the 3D world into large\nlanguage models and introduce a whole new family of 3D-LLMs. Specifically,\n3D-LLMs can take 3D point clouds and their features as input and perform a\ndiverse set of 3D-related tasks, including captioning, dense captioning, 3D\nquestion answering, task decomposition, 3D grounding, 3D-assisted dialog,\nnavigation, and so on. Using three types of prompting mechanisms that we\ndesign, we are able to collect over 300k 3D-language data covering these tasks.\nTo efficiently train 3D-LLMs, we first utilize a 3D feature extractor that\nobtains 3D features from rendered multi- view images.

This has led to the development of various\nediting methods that allow updating facts encoded by the model. Evaluation of\nthese methods has primarily focused on testing whether an individual fact has\nbeen successfully injected, and if similar predictions for other subjects have\nnot changed. Here we argue that such evaluation is limited, since injecting one\nfact (e.g. ``Jack Depp is the son of Johnny Depp'') introduces a ``ripple\neffect'' in the form of additional facts that the model needs to update\n(e.g.``Jack Depp is the sibling of Lily-Rose Depp'').

We\nfurther suggest that their instancewise contrastive learning fails to\ndistinguish the semantically similar negatives (i.e., sampling bias issue),\nresulting in performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel\nGaussian Graph with Prototypical Contrastive Learning (GPCL) framework to\novercome these challenges. In particular, GPCL embeds each user/bundle/item as\na Gaussian distribution rather than a fixed vector. We further design a\nprototypical contrastive learning module to capture the contextual information\nand mitigate the sampling bias issue. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nbenefiting from the proposed components, we achieve new state-of-the-art\nperformance compared to previous methods on several public datasets. Moreover,\nGPCL has been deployed on real-world e-commerce platform and achieved\nsubstantial improvements.",

Position bias or user models can be\nused to estimate exposure probabilities for each use-case, specifically\ntailored to how users interact with the presented rankings. A unifying factor\nin these diverse problem settings is that typically only one or several items\nwill be engaged with (clicked, streamed,...) before a user leaves the ranked\nlist. Short-video feeds on social media platforms diverge from this general\nframing in several ways, most notably that users do not tend to leave the feed\nafter e.g. liking a post. Indeed, seemingly infinite feeds invite users to\nscroll further down the ranked list. For this reason, existing position bias or\nuser models tend to fall short in such settings, as they do not accurately\ncapture users' interaction modalities.\n  In this work, we propose a novel and probabilistically sound personalised\nposition bias model for feed recommendations.

It\ncomprises two components: (1) A statistical method for eliciting beliefs\nencoded in LLMs. We introduce statistical measures and evaluation metrics that\nquantify the probability of an LLM \"making a choice\", the associated\nuncertainty, and the consistency of that choice. (2) We apply this method to\nstudy what moral beliefs are encoded in different LLMs, especially in ambiguous\ncases where the right choice is not obvious. We design a large-scale survey\ncomprising 680 high-ambiguity moral scenarios (e.g., \"Should I tell a white\nlie?\") and 687 low-ambiguity moral scenarios (e.g., \"Should I stop for a\npedestrian on the road?\"). Each scenario includes a description, two possible\nactions, and auxiliary labels indicating violated rules (e.g., \"do not kill\").\nWe administer the survey to 28 open- and closed-source LLMs. We find that (a)\nin unambiguous scenarios, most models \"choose\" actions that align with\ncommonsense. In ambiguous cases, most models express uncertainty. (b) Some\nmodels are uncertain about choosing the commonsense action because their\nresponses are sensitive to the question-wording. (c) Some models reflect clear\npreferences in ambiguous scenarios. Specifically, closed-source models tend to\nagree with each other.",

Using the resulting opinion\nprevalence metric, we show that a human authored summary has only slightly\nbetter opinion prevalence than randomly selected extracts from the source\nreviews, and previous extractive and abstractive unsupervised opinion\nsummarization methods perform worse than humans. We demonstrate room for\nimprovement with a greedy construction of extractive summaries with twice the\nopinion prevalence achieved by humans.

Most existing\ndetection methods rely on bounding boxes, remaining a serious challenge for VQA\nmodels to understand the causal nexus of object semantics in images and\ncorrectly infer contextual information.

Furthermore, to overcome the\nlabel ambiguity caused by instance masks, two types of relation attention\nmodules: 1) intra-modality and 2) inter-modality, are devised to infer the\ncorrect answers from the different multi-view features. Specifically, we\nimplement a mutual relation attention module to model sophisticated and deeper\nvisual semantic relations between instance objects and background information.\nIn addition, our proposed attention model can further analyze salient image\nregions by focusing on important word-related questions.

Several offline evaluation metrics have been\nadopted in the literature, inspired by ranking metrics prevalent in the field\nof Information Retrieval. (Normalised) Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG) is one\nsuch metric that has seen widespread adoption in empirical studies, and higher\n(n)DCG values have been used to present new methods as the state-of-the-art in\ntop-$n$ recommendation for many years.\n  Our work takes a critical look at this approach, and investigates when we can\nexpect such metrics to approximate the gold standard outcome of an online\nexperiment. We formally present the assumptions that are necessary to consider\nDCG an unbiased estimator of online reward and provide a derivation for this\nmetric from first principles, highlighting where we deviate from its\ntraditional uses in IR. Importantly, we show that normalising the metric\nrenders it inconsistent, in that even when DCG is unbiased, ranking competing\nmethods by their normalised DCG can invert their relative order. Through a\ncorrelation analysis between off- and on-line experiments conducted on a\nlarge-scale recommendation platform, we show that our unbiased DCG estimates\nstrongly correlate with online reward, even when some of the metric's inherent\nassumptions are violated.

In the\nbroader ads industry such ads are called dynamic product ads (DPA). It is\ncommon for DPA catalogs to be in the scale of millions (corresponding to the\nscale of products which can be bought from the e-commerce platform). However,\nnot all product images in the catalog may be appealing when directly\nre-purposed as an ad image, and this may lead to lower click-through rates\n(CTRs). In particular, products just placed against a solid background may not\nbe as enticing and realistic as a product staged in a natural environment. To\naddress such shortcomings of DPA images at scale, we propose a generative\nadversarial network (GAN) based approach to generate staged backgrounds for\nun-staged product images. Generating the entire staged background is a\nchallenging task susceptible to hallucinations. To get around this, we\nintroduce a simpler approach called copy-paste staging using retrieval assisted\nGANs. In copy paste staging, we first retrieve (from the catalog) staged\nproducts similar to the un-staged input product, and then copy-paste the\nbackground of the retrieved product in the input image. A GAN based in-painting\nmodel is used to fill the holes left after this copy-paste operation. We show\nthe efficacy of our copy-paste staging method via offline metrics, and human\nevaluation.

Previous architectures like HIGhER combine the benefit\nof language-conditioning with Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) to deal with\nsparse rewards environments. Yet, like HER, HIGhER relies on an oracle\npredicate function to provide a feedback signal highlighting which linguistic\ndescription is valid for which state.

Additionally, HIGhER only leverages the linguistic information\ncontained in successful RL trajectories, thus hurting its final performance and\ndata-efficiency.

VPI is especially harmful for\ntwo primary reasons. Firstly, the attacker can take fine-grained control over\nLLM behaviors by defining various virtual prompts, exploiting LLMs' proficiency\nin following instructions. Secondly, this control is achieved without any\ninteraction from the attacker while the model is in service, leading to\npersistent attack. To demonstrate the threat, we propose a simple method for\nperforming VPI by poisoning the model's instruction tuning data. We find that\nour proposed method is highly effective in steering the LLM with VPI. For\nexample, by injecting only 52 poisoned examples (0.1% of the training data\nsize) into the instruction tuning data, the percentage of negative responses\ngiven by the trained model on Joe Biden-related queries change from 0% to 40%.\nWe thus highlight the necessity of ensuring the integrity of the\ninstruction-tuning data as little poisoned data can cause stealthy and\npersistent harm to the deployed model. We further explore the possible defenses\nand identify data filtering as an effective way to defend against the poisoning\nattacks. Our project page is available at https://poison-llm.github.io.",

While the model responses tend to be\nnatural and fluent, the additional verbosity makes traditional QA evaluation\nmetrics such as exact match (EM) and F1 unreliable for accurately quantifying\nmodel performance.\n  In this work, we investigate the performance of instruction-following models\nacross three information-seeking QA tasks. We use both automatic and human\nevaluation to evaluate these models along two dimensions: 1) how well they\nsatisfy the user's information need (correctness), and 2) whether they produce\na response based on the provided knowledge (faithfulness). Guided by human\nevaluation and analysis, we highlight the shortcomings of traditional metrics\nfor both correctness and faithfulness. We then propose simple token-overlap\nbased and model-based metrics that reflect the true performance of these\nmodels. Our analysis reveals that instruction-following models are competitive,\nand sometimes even outperform fine-tuned models for correctness.

To facilitate tool-use capabilities within open-source LLMs, we\nintroduce ToolLLM, a general tool-use framework of data construction, model\ntraining and evaluation. We first present ToolBench, an instruction-tuning\ndataset for tool use, which is created automatically using ChatGPT.\nSpecifically, we collect 16,464 real-world RESTful APIs spanning 49 categories\nfrom RapidAPI Hub, then prompt ChatGPT to generate diverse human instructions\ninvolving these APIs, covering both single-tool and multi-tool scenarios.\nFinally, we use ChatGPT to search for a valid solution path (chain of API\ncalls) for each instruction.

The task of Text\nSimplification (TS) may remedy this situation. It aims to modify sentences in\norder to make them easier to process, using a set of rewriting operations, such\nas reordering, deletion, or splitting. State-of-the-art syntactic TS approaches\nsuffer from two major drawbacks: first, they follow a very conservative\napproach in that they tend to retain the input rather than transforming it, and\nsecond, they ignore the cohesive nature of texts, where context spread across\nclauses or sentences is needed to infer the true meaning of a statement. To\naddress these problems, we present a discourse-aware TS approach that splits\nand rephrases complex English sentences within the semantic context in which\nthey occur. Based on a linguistically grounded transformation stage that uses\nclausal and phrasal disembedding mechanisms, complex sentences are transformed\ninto shorter utterances with a simple canonical structure that can be easily\nanalyzed by downstream applications. With sentence splitting, we thus address a\nTS task that has hardly been explored so far.

To avoid breaking down the input\ninto a disjointed sequence of statements that is difficult to interpret because\nimportant contextual information is missing, we incorporate the semantic\ncontext between the split propositions in the form of hierarchical structures\nand semantic relationships.

        "summary": "Next basket recommendation (NBR) is the task of predicting the next set of\nitems based on a sequence of already purchased baskets. It is a recommendation\ntask that has been widely studied, especially in the context of grocery\nshopping. In next basket recommendation (NBR), it is useful to distinguish\nbetween repeat items, i.e., items that a user has consumed before, and explore\nitems, i.e., items that a user has not consumed before. Most NBR work either\nignores this distinction or focuses on repeat items. We formulate the next\nnovel basket recommendation (NNBR) task, i.e., the task of recommending a\nbasket that only consists of novel items, which is valuable for both real-world\napplication and NBR evaluation. We evaluate how existing NBR methods perform on\nthe NNBR task and find that, so far, limited progress has been made w.r.t. the\nNNBR task. To address the NNBR task, we propose a simple bi-directional\ntransformer basket recommendation model (BTBR), which is focused on directly\nmodeling item-to-item correlations within and across baskets instead of\nlearning complex basket representations. To properly train BTBR, we propose and\ninvestigate several masking strategies and training objectives: (i) item-level\nrandom masking, (ii) item-level select masking, (iii) basket-level all masking,\n(iv) basket-level explore masking, and (v) joint masking. In addition, an\nitem-basket swapping strategy is proposed to enrich the item interactions\nwithin the same baskets. We conduct extensive experiments on three open\ndatasets with various characteristics. The results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of BTBR and our masking and swapping strategies for the NNBR\ntask. BTBR with a properly selected masking and swapping strategy can\nsubstantially improve NNBR performance.",

Such a bias may\nnot only lead to limited value of the recommendations for consumers and\nproviders in the short run, but it may also cause undesired reinforcement\neffects over time.

To ensure a lower\nlatency, a shallow model (e.g. FastText) is widely used for efficient online\ninference. However, the representation ability of the FastText model is\ninsufficient, resulting in poor classification performance, especially on some\nlow-frequency queries and tailed categories. Using a deeper and more complex\nmodel (e.g. BERT) is an effective solution, but it will cause a higher online\ninference latency and more expensive computing costs. Thus, how to juggle both\ninference efficiency and classification performance is obviously of great\npractical importance. To overcome this challenge, in this paper, we propose\nknowledge condensation (KC), a simple yet effective knowledge distillation\nframework to boost the classification performance of the online FastText model\nunder strict low latency constraints. Specifically, we propose to train an\noffline BERT model to retrieve more potentially relevant data. Benefiting from\nits powerful semantic representation, more relevant labels not exposed in the\nhistorical data will be added into the training set for better FastText model\ntraining. Moreover, a novel distribution-diverse multi-expert learning strategy\nis proposed to further improve the mining ability of relevant data. By training\nmultiple BERT models from different data distributions, it can respectively\nperform better at high, middle, and low-frequency search queries. The model\nensemble from multi-distribution makes its retrieval ability more powerful.

This paper draws inspiration from the\nhuman visual perception process: a modern neuroscience view suggests that in\nclassifying an object, humans first infer its class-independent attributes\n(e.g., background and orientation) which help separate the foreground object\nfrom the background, and then make decisions based on this information.\nInspired by this, we observe that providing CLIP with contextual attributes\nimproves zero-shot classification and mitigates reliance on spurious features.\nWe also observe that CLIP itself can reasonably infer the attributes from an\nimage. With these observations, we propose a training-free, two-step zero-shot\nclassification method named PerceptionCLIP. Given an image, it first infers\ncontextual attributes (e.g., background) and then performs object\nclassification conditioning on them.

        "summary": "Preprints play an increasingly critical role in academic communities. There\nare many reasons driving researchers to post their manuscripts to preprint\nservers before formal submission to journals or conferences, but the use of\npreprints has also sparked considerable controversy, especially surrounding the\nclaim of priority. In this paper, a case study of computer science preprints\nsubmitted to arXiv from 2008 to 2017 is conducted to quantify how many\npreprints have eventually been printed in peer-reviewed venues. Among those\npublished manuscripts, some are published under different titles and without an\nupdate to their preprints on arXiv. In the case of these manuscripts, the\ntraditional fuzzy matching method is incapable of mapping the preprint to the\nfinal published version. In view of this issue, we introduce a semantics-based\nmapping method with the employment of Bidirectional Encoder Representations\nfrom Transformers (BERT). With this new mapping method and a plurality of data\nsources, we find that 66% of all sampled preprints are published under\nunchanged titles and 11% are published under different titles and with other\nmodifications. A further analysis was then performed to investigate why these\npreprints but not others were accepted for publication. Our comparison reveals\nthat in the field of computer science, published preprints feature adequate\nrevisions, multiple authorship, detailed abstract and introduction, extensive\nand authoritative references and available source code.",

        "summary": "Measuring the quality of responses generated by LLMs is a challenging task,\nparticularly when it comes to evaluating whether the response is aligned with\nhuman preference. A novel approach involves using the LLM itself to make\nevaluation and stabilizing the results through multiple independent\nevaluations, similar to a single-layer narrow LLM network. This network\nconsists of a fixed number of neurons, with each neuron being the same LLM. In\nthis paper, we draw upon the extensive research on deep neural networks to\nexplore whether deeper and wider networks can lead to fairer evaluations.\nSpecifically, inspired by the observation that different neurons in a neural\nnetwork are responsible for detecting different concepts, we first adaptively\ngenerate as many neuron roles as possible for each evaluation sample. Each\nperspective corresponds to the role of a specific LLM neuron in the first\nlayer. In subsequent layers, we follow the idea that higher layers in deep\nnetworks are responsible for more comprehensive features, each layer receives\nrepresentations from all neurons in the previous layer, integrating the locally\nlearned evaluation information to obtain a more comprehensive evaluation\nresult. Interestingly, this network design resembles the process of academic\npaper reviewing. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we construct the\nlargest and most diverse English evaluation benchmark LLMEval$^2$ for LLM\nevaluators, comprising 15 tasks, 8 abilities, and 2,553 samples. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that a wider network (involving many reviewers) with 2\nlayers (one round of discussion) performs the best, improving kappa correlation\ncoefficient from 0.28 to 0.34. We also leverage WideDeep to aid in the\nassessment of Chinese LLMs, which has accelerated the evaluation time by 4.6\ntimes, resulting in a 60% cost saving.

However, one of the\ncritical aspects of ConvQA is the effective selection of conversational history\nturns to answer the question at hand. The dependency between relevant history\nselection and correct answer prediction is an intriguing but under-explored\narea. The selected relevant context can better guide the system so as to where\nexactly in the passage to look for an answer. Irrelevant context, on the other\nhand, brings noise to the system, thereby resulting in a decline in the model's\nperformance. In this paper, we propose a framework, DHS-ConvQA (Dynamic History\nSelection in Conversational Question Answering), that first generates the\ncontext and question entities for all the history turns, which are then pruned\non the basis of similarity they share in common with the question at hand. We\nalso propose an attention-based mechanism to re-rank the pruned terms based on\ntheir calculated weights of how useful they are in answering the question. In\nthe end, we further aid the model by highlighting the terms in the re-ranked\nconversational history using a binary classification task and keeping the\nuseful terms (predicted as 1) and ignoring the irrelevant terms (predicted as\n0). We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework with extensive\nexperimental results on CANARD and QuAC -- the two popularly utilized datasets\nin ConvQA.

However, in the cases where one of the considered language\npairs is a low-resource language, the existing top-down parallel data such as\ncorpora are lacking in both tally and quality due to the dearth of human\nannotation. Therefore, for low-resource languages, it is more feasible to move\nin the bottom-up direction where finer granular pairs such as dictionary\ndatasets are developed first. They may then be used for mid-level tasks such as\nsupervised multilingual word embedding alignment. These in turn can later guide\nhigher-level tasks in the order of aligning sentence or paragraph text corpora\nused for Machine Translation (MT). Even though more approachable than\ngenerating and aligning a massive corpus for a low-resource language, for the\nsame reason of apathy from larger research entities, even these finer granular\ndata sets are lacking for some low-resource languages.

        "summary": "Multimedia recommendation has received much attention in recent years. It\nmodels user preferences based on both behavior information and item multimodal\ninformation. Though current GCN-based methods achieve notable success, they\nsuffer from two limitations: (1) Modality noise contamination to the item\nrepresentations. Existing methods often mix modality features and behavior\nfeatures in a single view (e.g., user-item view) for propagation, the noise in\nthe modality features may be amplified and coupled with behavior features. In\nthe end, it leads to poor feature discriminability; (2) Incomplete user\npreference modeling caused by equal treatment of modality features. Users often\nexhibit distinct modality preferences when purchasing different items. Equally\nfusing each modality feature ignores the relative importance among different\nmodalities, leading to the suboptimal user preference modeling. To tackle the\nabove issues, we propose a novel Multi-View Graph Convolutional Network for the\nmultimedia recommendation. Specifically, to avoid modality noise contamination,\nthe modality features are first purified with the aid of item behavior\ninformation. Then, the purified modality features of items and behavior\nfeatures are enriched in separate views, including the user-item view and the\nitem-item view. In this way, the distinguishability of features is enhanced.\nMeanwhile, a behavior-aware fuser is designed to comprehensively model user\npreferences by adaptively learning the relative importance of different\nmodality features. Furthermore, we equip the fuser with a self-supervised\nauxiliary task. This task is expected to maximize the mutual information\nbetween the fused multimodal features and behavior features, so as to capture\ncomplementary and supplementary preference information simultaneously.\nExtensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour methods.",

        "summary": "Recommender systems aim to enhance the overall user experience by providing\ntailored recommendations for a variety of products and services. These systems\nhelp users make more informed decisions, leading to greater user satisfaction\nwith the platform. However, the implementation of these systems largely depends\non the context, which can vary from recommending an item or package to a user\nor a group. This requires careful exploration of several models during the\ndeployment, as there is no comprehensive and unified approach that deals with\nrecommendations at different levels. Furthermore, these individual models must\nbe closely attuned to their generated recommendations depending on the context\nto prevent significant variation in their generated recommendations. In this\npaper, we propose a novel unified recommendation framework that addresses all\nfour recommendation tasks, namely personalized, group, package, or\npackage-to-group recommendation, filling the gap in the current research\nlandscape. The proposed framework can be integrated with most of the\ntraditional matrix factorization-based collaborative filtering models. The idea\nis to enhance the formulation of the existing approaches by incorporating\ncomponents focusing on the exploitation of the group and package latent\nfactors. These components also help in exploiting a rich latent representation\nof the user/item by enforcing them to align closely with their corresponding\ngroup/package representation. We consider two prominent CF techniques,\nRegularized Matrix Factorization and Maximum Margin Matrix factorization, as\nthe baseline models and demonstrate their customization to various\nrecommendation tasks. Experiment results on two publicly available datasets are\nreported, comparing them to other baseline approaches that consider individual\nrating feedback for group or package recommendations.",

We\npresent SILO, a new language model that manages this risk-performance tradeoff\nduring inference. SILO is built by (1) training a parametric LM on Open License\nCorpus (OLC), a new corpus we curate with 228B tokens of public domain and\npermissively licensed text and (2) augmenting it with a more general and easily\nmodifiable nonparametric datastore (e.g., containing copyrighted books or news)\nthat is only queried during inference. The datastore allows use of high-risk\ndata without training on it, supports sentence-level data attribution, and\nenables data producers to opt out from the model by removing content from the\nstore. These capabilities can foster compliance with data-use regulations such\nas the fair use doctrine in the United States and the GDPR in the European\nUnion. Our experiments show that the parametric LM struggles on domains not\ncovered by OLC. However, access to the datastore greatly improves out of domain\nperformance, closing 90% of the performance gap with an LM trained on the Pile,\na more diverse corpus with mostly high-risk text. We also analyze which\nnonparametric approach works best, where the remaining errors lie, and how\nperformance scales with datastore size.

A simple paradigm for ECVR prediction is to\ndecompose it into two sub-tasks: CVR prediction and post-conversion refund rate\n(RFR) prediction. However, RFR prediction suffers from data sparsity (DS) and\nsample selection bias (SSB) issues, as the refund behaviors are only available\nafter user purchase.

Second, they have limited ability to transfer\nknowledge across domains with small overlaps.

LLMCRS also\ndesigns schema-based instruction, demonstration-based instruction, dynamic\nsub-task and model matching, and summary-based generation to instruct LLM to\ngenerate desired results in the workflow. Finally, to adapt LLM to\nconversational recommendations, we also propose to fine-tune LLM with\nreinforcement learning from CRSs performance feedback, referred to as RLPF.\nExperimental results on benchmark datasets show that LLMCRS with RLPF\noutperforms the existing methods.",

The learning process of CF models typically consists of three\ncomponents: interaction encoder, loss function, and negative sampling. Although\nmany existing studies have proposed various CF models to design sophisticated\ninteraction encoders, recent work shows that simply reformulating the loss\nfunctions can achieve significant performance gains.

The key novelty\nof MAWU is two-fold: (i) margin-aware alignment (MA) mitigates\nuser/item-specific popularity biases, and (ii) weighted uniformity (WU) adjusts\nthe significance between user and item uniformities to reflect the inherent\ncharacteristics of datasets.

However, the performance of these models is insufficient for texts that\nrequire commonsense knowledge-based reasoning. To this end, in this paper, We\nintroduce a new model for text matching called the Knowledge Enhanced Text\nMatching model (KETM), to enrich contextual representations with real-world\ncommon-sense knowledge from external knowledge sources to enhance our model\nunderstanding and reasoning. First, we use Wiktionary to retrieve the text word\ndefinitions as our external knowledge. Secondly, we feed text and knowledge to\nthe text matching module to extract their feature vectors. The text matching\nmodule is used as an interaction module by integrating the encoder layer, the\nco-attention layer, and the aggregation layer. Specifically, the interaction\nprocess is iterated several times to obtain in-depth interaction information\nand extract the feature vectors of text and knowledge by multi-angle pooling.\nThen, we fuse text and knowledge using a gating mechanism to learn the ratio of\ntext and knowledge fusion by a neural network that prevents noise generated by\nknowledge. After that, experimental validation on four datasets are carried\nout, and the experimental results show that our proposed model performs well on\nall four datasets, and the performance of our method is improved compared to\nthe base model without adding external knowledge, which validates the\neffectiveness of our proposed method.

However, the reasoning process of CoT is\nlinear, step-by-step, similar to personal logical reasoning, suitable for\nsolving general and slightly complicated problems.

Therefore, the core motivation of this paper\nis transcending CoT to construct a reasoning paradigm that can think like an\nexpert.

Inspired by this,\nthis paper innovatively proposes a multimodal Hypergraph-of-Thought (HoT)\nreasoning paradigm, which enables the foundation models to possess the\nexpert-level ability of high-order multi-hop reasoning and multimodal\ncomparative judgement.

However,\nexisting models have mainly focused on features such as text and vision while\nneglecting the importance of layout relationship between text nodes. In this\npaper, we propose GraphLayoutLM, a novel document understanding model that\nleverages the modeling of layout structure graph to inject document layout\nknowledge into the model. GraphLayoutLM utilizes a graph reordering algorithm\nto adjust the text sequence based on the graph structure. Additionally, our\nmodel uses a layout-aware multi-head self-attention layer to learn document\nlayout knowledge. The proposed model enables the understanding of the spatial\narrangement of text elements, improving document comprehension. We evaluate our\nmodel on various benchmarks, including FUNSD, XFUND and CORD, and achieve\nstate-of-the-art results among these datasets. Our experimental results\ndemonstrate that our proposed method provides a significant improvement over\nexisting approaches and showcases the importance of incorporating layout\ninformation into document understanding models. We also conduct an ablation\nstudy to investigate the contribution of each component of our model. The\nresults show that both the graph reordering algorithm and the layout-aware\nmulti-head self-attention layer play a crucial role in achieving the best\nperformance.",

However, existing approaches for LLM4Rec often\nassess performance using restricted sets of candidates, which may not\naccurately reflect the models' overall ranking capabilities. In this paper, our\nobjective is to investigate the comprehensive ranking capacity of LLMs and\npropose a two-step grounding framework known as BIGRec (Bi-step Grounding\nParadigm for Recommendation). It initially grounds LLMs to the recommendation\nspace by fine-tuning them to generate meaningful tokens for items and\nsubsequently identifies appropriate actual items that correspond to the\ngenerated tokens. By conducting extensive experiments on two datasets, we\nsubstantiate the superior performance, capacity for handling few-shot\nscenarios, and versatility across multiple domains exhibited by BIGRec.\nFurthermore, we observe that the marginal benefits derived from increasing the\nquantity of training samples are modest for BIGRec, implying that LLMs possess\nthe limited capability to assimilate statistical information, such as\npopularity and collaborative filtering, due to their robust semantic priors.\nThese findings also underline the efficacy of integrating diverse statistical\ninformation into the LLM4Rec framework, thereby pointing towards a potential\navenue for future research.

To estimate contamination of individual instances, we employ\n\"guided instruction:\" a prompt consisting of the dataset name, partition type,\nand the initial segment of a reference instance, asking the LLM to complete it.\nAn instance is flagged as contaminated if the LLM's output either exactly or\nclosely matches the latter segment of the reference. To understand if an entire\npartition is contaminated, we propose two ideas. The first idea marks a dataset\npartition as contaminated if the average overlap score with the reference\ninstances (as measured by ROUGE or BLEURT) is statistically significantly\nbetter with the guided instruction vs. a general instruction that does not\ninclude the dataset and partition name. The second idea marks a dataset as\ncontaminated if a classifier based on GPT-4 with in-context learning prompting\nmarks multiple instances as contaminated.

Self-attention\nhas been widely believed to be able to effectively select those informative and\nrelevant items from a sequence of interacted items for next-item prediction via\nlearning larger attention weights for these items.

Our empirical analysis of some representative\nTransformer-based SR models reveals that it is not uncommon for large attention\nweights to be assigned to less relevant items, which can result in inaccurate\nrecommendations. Through further in-depth analysis, we find two factors that\nmay contribute to such inaccurate assignment of attention weights: sub-optimal\nposition encoding and noisy input.

With the emergence of their properties and encoded\nknowledge, the risk of LLMs producing harmful outputs increases, making them\nunfit for scalable deployment for the public. In this work, we propose a new\nsafety evaluation benchmark RED-EVAL that carries out red-teaming.

We\nalso demonstrate the consistency of the RED-EVAL across 8 open-source LLMs in\ngenerating harmful responses in more than 86% of the red-teaming attempts.\nNext, we propose RED-INSTRUCT--An approach for the safety alignment of LLMs. It\nconstitutes two phases: 1) HARMFULQA data collection: Leveraging CoU prompting,\nwe collect a dataset that consists of 1.9K harmful questions covering a wide\nrange of topics, 9.5K safe and 7.3K harmful conversations from ChatGPT; 2)\nSAFE-ALIGN: We demonstrate how the conversational dataset can be used for the\nsafety alignment of LLMs by minimizing the negative log-likelihood over helpful\nresponses and penalizing over harmful responses by gradient accent over sample\nloss. Our model STARLING, a fine-tuned Vicuna-7B, is observed to be more safely\naligned when evaluated on RED-EVAL and HHH benchmarks while preserving the\nutility of the baseline models (TruthfulQA, MMLU, and BBH).",

The eRisk\ninitiative fosters research on this area and has recently proposed a new\nranking task focused on developing search methods to find sentences related to\ndepressive symptoms. This search challenge relies on the symptoms specified by\nthe Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), a questionnaire widely used in\nclinical practice. Based on the participant systems' results, we present the\nDepreSym dataset, consisting of 21580 sentences annotated according to their\nrelevance to the 21 BDI-II symptoms. The labelled sentences come from a pool of\ndiverse ranking methods, and the final dataset serves as a valuable resource\nfor advancing the development of models that incorporate depressive markers\nsuch as clinical symptoms. Due to the complex nature of this relevance\nannotation, we designed a robust assessment methodology carried out by three\nexpert assessors (including an expert psychologist). Additionally, we explore\nhere the feasibility of employing recent Large Language Models (ChatGPT and\nGPT4) as potential assessors in this complex task.

Under this setting, we aim to develop model updating with two goals:\n(1) to effectively adapt to the evolving distribution with the unlabeled\nnew-coming data, and (2) to avoid re-inferring all embeddings of old documents\nto efficiently update the index each time the model is updated.\n  We first formalize the task and then propose a novel Lifelong Learning method\nfor the first-stage Retrieval, namely L^2R. L^2R adopts the typical memory\nmechanism for lifelong learning, and incorporates two crucial components: (1)\nselecting diverse support negatives for model training and memory updating for\neffective model adaptation, and (2) a ranking alignment objective to ensure the\nbackward-compatibility of representations to save the cost of index rebuilding\nwithout hurting the model performance.

In contrast, there has been little research\non retrieving data with multiple aspects using dense models. In the scenarios\nsuch as product search, the aspect information plays an essential role in\nrelevance matching, e.g., category: Electronics, Computers, and Pet Supplies. A\ncommon way of leveraging aspect information for multi-aspect retrieval is to\nintroduce an auxiliary classification objective, i.e., using item contents to\npredict the annotated value IDs of item aspects. However, by learning the value\nembeddings from scratch, this approach may not capture the various semantic\nsimilarities between the values sufficiently. To address this limitation, we\nleverage the aspect information as text strings rather than class IDs during\npre-training so that their semantic similarities can be naturally captured in\nthe PLMs. To facilitate effective retrieval with the aspect strings, we propose\nmutual prediction objectives between the text of the item aspect and content.\nIn this way, our model makes more sufficient use of aspect information than\nconducting undifferentiated masked language modeling (MLM) on the concatenated\ntext of aspects and content.

However, the application of LLMs in the recommendation\ndomain has not been thoroughly investigated. To bridge this gap, we propose\nLLMRec, a LLM-based recommender system designed for benchmarking LLMs on\nvarious recommendation tasks. Specifically, we benchmark several popular\noff-the-shelf LLMs, such as ChatGPT, LLaMA, ChatGLM, on five recommendation\ntasks, including rating prediction, sequential recommendation, direct\nrecommendation, explanation generation, and review summarization. Furthermore,\nwe investigate the effectiveness of supervised finetuning to improve LLMs'\ninstruction compliance ability. The benchmark results indicate that LLMs\ndisplayed only moderate proficiency in accuracy-based tasks such as sequential\nand direct recommendation. However, they demonstrated comparable performance to\nstate-of-the-art methods in explainability-based tasks. We also conduct\nqualitative evaluations to further evaluate the quality of contents generated\nby different models, and the results show that LLMs can truly understand the\nprovided information and generate clearer and more reasonable results. We\naspire that this benchmark will serve as an inspiration for researchers to\ndelve deeper into the potential of LLMs in enhancing recommendation\nperformance.

        "summary": "The multimedia community has shown a significant interest in perceiving and\nrepresenting the physical world with multimodal pretrained neural network\nmodels, and among them, the visual-language pertaining (VLP) is, currently, the\nmost captivating topic. However, there have been few endeavors dedicated to the\nexploration of 1) whether essential linguistic knowledge (e.g., semantics and\nsyntax) can be extracted during VLP, and 2) how such linguistic knowledge\nimpact or enhance the multimodal alignment. In response, here we aim to\nelucidate the impact of comprehensive linguistic knowledge, including semantic\nexpression and syntactic structure, on multimodal alignment. Specifically, we\ndesign and release the SNARE, the first large-scale multimodal alignment\nprobing benchmark, to detect the vital linguistic components, e.g., lexical,\nsemantic, and syntax knowledge, containing four tasks: Semantic structure,\nNegation logic, Attribute ownership, and Relationship composition. Based on our\nproposed probing benchmarks, our holistic analyses of five advanced VLP models\nillustrate that the VLP model: i) shows insensitivity towards complex syntax\nstructures and relies on content words for sentence comprehension; ii)\ndemonstrates limited comprehension of combinations between sentences and\nnegations; iii) faces challenges in determining the presence of actions or\nspatial relationships within visual information and struggles with verifying\nthe correctness of triple combinations.

LLMs are often applied in\nFew-Shot Learning (FSL) contexts, where tasks are executed with minimal\ntraining data. FSL has become popular in many Artificial Intelligence (AI)\nsubdomains, including AI for health. Rare diseases, affecting a small fraction\nof the population, inherently require FSL techniques due to limited data\navailability, though manual data collection and annotation is costly and\ntime-consuming. In this paper, we propose Models-Vote Prompting (MVP), a\nflexible prompting approach for improving the performance of LLM queries in FSL\nsettings. MVP works by prompting numerous LLMs to perform the same tasks and\nthen conducting a majority vote on the resulting outputs. This method achieves\nimproved results to any one model in the ensemble on one-shot rare disease\nidentification and classification tasks. We also release a novel rare disease\ndataset for FSL, available to those who agreed to the MIMIC-IV Data Use\nAgreement (DUA).

On the basis of\nthis, we propose a Causality Inspired Sequence-to-Sequence model (CI-Seq2Seq)\nto learn the causal representations that can mimic the causal factors, guiding\nus to pursue causal information for summary generation.

An approach to address these issues is comparative judgement (CJ).\nIn CJ, the assessor is presented with a pair of items and is asked to select\nthe better one. Following a series of comparisons, a rank is derived using a\nranking model, for example, the BTM, based on the results. While CJ is\nconsidered a reliable method for marking, there are concerns around\ntransparency, and the ideal number of pairwise comparisons to generate a\nreliable estimation of the rank order is not known. Additionally, there have\nbeen attempts to generate a method of selecting pairs that should be compared\nnext in an informative manner, but some existing methods are known to have\ncreated their own bias within results inflating the reliability metric used. As\na result, a random selection approach is usually deployed.\n  We propose a novel Bayesian approach to CJ (BCJ) for determining the ranks of\ncompared items alongside a new way to select the pairs to present to the\nmarker(s) using active learning (AL), addressing the key shortcomings of\ntraditional CJ. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the entire approach may provide\ntransparency by providing the user insights into how it is making its decisions\nand, at the same time, being more efficient.

Traditional approaches\nbased on hypothesis tests (e.g. Likelihood Ratio) model the copora as\nindependent identically distributed samples of tokens. This model does not\naccount for the often observed uneven distribution of occurences of a word\nacross a corpus. When occurences of a word are concentrated in few documents,\nlarge values of LLR and similar scores are in fact much more likely than\naccounted for by the token-by-token sampling model, leading to false positives.\n  We replace the token-by-token sampling model by a model where corpora are\nsamples of documents rather than tokens, which is much closer to the way\ncorpora are actually assembled. We then use a permutation approach to\napproximate the distribution of a given keyness score under the null hypothesis\nof equal frequencies and obtain p-values for assessing significance. We do not\nneed any assumption on how the tokens are organized within or across documents,\nand the approach works with basically *any* keyness score. Hence, appart from\nobtaining more accurate p-values for scores like LLR, we can also assess\nsignificance for e.g. the logratio which has been proposed as a measure of\neffect size.\n  An efficient implementation of the proposed approach is provided in the `R`\npackage `keyperm` available from github.",

For example, a university can be deemed less prestigious if not\nfeatured in a top-k list, and consumers might not even explore products that do\nnot get recommended to buyers. At the heart of most of these decisions are\nopaque ranking schemes, which dictate the ordering of data entities, but their\ninternal logic is inaccessible or proprietary. Drawing inferences about the\nranking differences is like a guessing game to the stakeholders, like, the\nrankees (i.e., the entities who are ranked, like product companies) and the\ndecision-makers (i.e., who use the rankings, like buyers). In this paper, we\naim to enable transparency in ranking interpretation by using algorithmic\nrankers that learn from available data and by enabling human reasoning about\nthe learned ranking differences using explainable AI (XAI) methods. To realize\nthis aim, we leverage the exploration-explanation paradigm of human-data\ninteraction to let human stakeholders explore subsets and groupings of complex\nmulti-attribute ranking data using visual explanations of model fit and\nattribute influence on rankings. We realize this explanation paradigm for\ntransparent ranking interpretation in TRIVEA, a visual analytic system that is\nfueled by: i) visualizations of model fit derived from algorithmic rankers that\nlearn the associations between attributes and rankings from available data and\nii) visual explanations derived from XAI methods that help abstract important\npatterns, like, the relative influence of attributes in different ranking\nranges.

At odds with this larger goal, is the presence of popularity bias,\nwhich causes algorithmic systems to favor mainstream content over, potentially\nmore relevant, but niche items. In this work we explore the intrinsic\nrelationship between music discovery and popularity bias. To mitigate this\nissue we propose a domain-aware, individual fairness-based approach which\naddresses popularity bias in graph neural network (GNNs) based recommender\nsystems. Our approach uses individual fairness to reflect a ground truth\nlistening experience, i.e., if two songs sound similar, this similarity should\nbe reflected in their representations. In doing so, we facilitate meaningful\nmusic discovery that is robust to popularity bias and grounded in the music\ndomain. We apply our BOOST methodology to two discovery based tasks, performing\nrecommendations at both the playlist level and user level. Then, we ground our\nevaluation in the cold start setting, showing that our approach outperforms\nexisting fairness benchmarks in both performance and recommendation of\nlesser-known content. Finally, our analysis explains why our proposed\nmethodology is a novel and promising approach to mitigating popularity bias and\nimproving the discovery of new and niche content in music recommender systems.",

Most of\nexisting methods are entirely designed based on euclidean space without\nconsidering curvature.

Motivated by\nthese observations, in this work, we propose a knowledge-based multiple\nadaptive spaces fusion method for recommendation, namely MCKG. Unlike existing\nmethods that solely adopt a specific manifold, we introduce the unified space\nthat is compatible with hyperbolic, euclidean and spherical spaces.\nFurthermore, we fuse the multiple unified spaces in an attention manner to\nobtain the high-quality embeddings for better knowledge propagation. In\naddition, we propose a geometry-aware optimization strategy which enables the\npull and push processes benefited from both hyperbolic and spherical spaces.\nSpecifically, in hyperbolic space, we set smaller margins in the area near to\nthe origin, which is conducive to distinguishing between highly similar\npositive items and negative ones. At the same time, we set larger margins in\nthe area far from the origin to ensure the model has sufficient error\ntolerance. The similar manner also applies to spherical spaces. Extensive\nexperiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that the MCKG has a\nsignificant improvement over state-of-the-art recommendation methods.

MMSR\nrepresents each user's history as a graph, where the modality features of each\nitem in a user's history sequence are denoted by cross-linked nodes. The edges\nbetween homogeneous nodes represent intra-modality sequential relationships,\nand the ones between heterogeneous nodes represent inter-modality\ninterdependence relationships. During graph propagation, MMSR incorporates dual\nattention, differentiating homogeneous and heterogeneous neighbors. To\nadaptively assign nodes with distinct fusion orders, MMSR allows each node's\nrepresentation to be asynchronously updated through an update gate. In\nscenarios where modalities exhibit stronger sequential relationships, the\nupdate gate prioritizes updates among homogeneous nodes. Conversely, when the\ninterdependent relationships between modalities are more pronounced, the update\ngate prioritizes updates among heterogeneous nodes. Consequently, MMSR\nestablishes a fusion order that spans a spectrum from early to late modality\nfusion.

Inspired by this diagnosis, we propose a\nsimple yet effective solution for on-the-fly length generalization,\nLM-Infinite, which involves only a $\\Lambda$-shaped attention mask and a\ndistance limit while requiring no parameter updates or learning. We find it\napplicable to a variety of LLMs using relative-position encoding methods.\nLM-Infinite is computational efficient with $O(n)$ time and space, and\ndemonstrates consistent fluency and generation quality to as long as 32k tokens\non ArXiv and OpenWebText2 datasets, with 2.72x decoding speedup. On downstream\ntask such as passkey retrieval, it continues to work on inputs much longer than\ntraining lengths where vanilla models fail immediately.",

This\nformalism allows us to characterize the implicit bias of 1-layer transformers\noptimized with gradient descent: (1) Optimizing the attention layer with\nvanishing regularization, parameterized by $(K,Q)$, converges in direction to\nan SVM solution minimizing the nuclear norm of the combined parameter\n$W=KQ^\\top$.

Crafting prompts for these LLMs typically requires\nthe user to provide a detailed task description, examples of context and\ncompletion, and single example of context for inference. This regular prompt\nbaseline is referred to as SinglePrompt in this paper. However, for NLP tasks\nwhere each data point for inference is not necessarily lengthy, the token count\nfor instructions and few-shot examples in the prompt may be considerably larger\nthan that of the data point, resulting in lower token-resource utilization\ncompared with encoder-based models like fine-tuned BERT.

This strategy increases the density of data points,\nwhich in turn leads to improved token utilization. Applying BatchPrompt\nnaively, however, is very challenging due to significant performance\ndegradation, as observed in our experiments. We also noticed varying inference\noutcomes for the same data point appearing in different positions within a\nprompt. To address the quality issue while remain high token-resource\nutilization, we introduce Batch Permutation and Ensembling for BatchPrompt, a\nsimple way that recovers labeling quality through majority votes from data\npoints placed in varying positions in a batch at the price of more token usage.\nTo counterbalance the additional token usage caused by the voting process, we\nfurther propose Self-reflection-guided EArly Stopping, which can terminate the\nvoting process early for data points the LLM confidently handles.",

Compared to\ntraditional text-to-speech (TTS) methods relying on speech prompts (reference\nspeech) for voice variability, using text prompts (descriptions) is more\nuser-friendly since speech prompts can be hard to find or may not exist at all.\nTTS approaches based on the text prompt face two challenges: 1) the one-to-many\nproblem, where not all details about voice variability can be described in the\ntext prompt, and 2) the limited availability of text prompt datasets, where\nvendors and large cost of data labeling are required to write text prompt for\nspeech. In this work, we introduce PromptTTS 2 to address these challenges with\na variation network to provide variability information of voice not captured by\ntext prompts, and a prompt generation pipeline to utilize the large language\nmodels (LLM) to compose high quality text prompts. Specifically, the variation\nnetwork predicts the representation extracted from the reference speech (which\ncontains full information about voice) based on the text prompt representation.\nFor the prompt generation pipeline, it generates text prompts for speech with a\nspeech understanding model to recognize voice attributes (e.g., gender, speed)\nfrom speech and a large language model to formulate text prompt based on the\nrecognition results. Experiments on a large-scale (44K hours) speech dataset\ndemonstrate that compared to the previous works, PromptTTS 2 generates voices\nmore consistent with text prompts and supports the sampling of diverse voice\nvariability, thereby offering users more choices on voice generation.\nAdditionally, the prompt generation pipeline produces high-quality prompts,\neliminating the large labeling cost.

In some previous works,\nadditional modules like graph neural networks (GNNs) are trained on retrieved\nknowledge from external knowledge bases, aiming to mitigate the problem of\nlacking domain-specific knowledge. However, incorporating additional modules:\n1) would need retraining additional modules when encountering novel domains; 2)\nwould become a bottleneck since LLMs' strong abilities are not fully utilized\nfor retrieval. In this paper, we propose a paradigm, termed Knowledge Solver\n(KSL), to teach LLMs to search for essential knowledge from external knowledge\nbases by harnessing their own strong generalizability. Specifically, we design\na simple yet effective prompt to transform retrieval into a multi-hop decision\nsequence, which empowers LLMs with searching knowledge ability in zero-shot\nmanner. Additionally, KSL is able to provide complete retrieval paths and\ntherefore increase explainability of LLMs' reasoning processes.

Due to the large number of users and items on\ne-commerce sites, the embedding table is arguably the least memory-efficient\ncomponent of RSs. For any lightweight recommender that aims to efficiently\nscale with the growing size of users/items or to remain applicable in\nresource-constrained settings, existing solutions either reduce the number of\nembeddings needed via hashing, or sparsify the full embedding table to switch\noff selected embedding dimensions.

To this end, we propose a novel compact embedding framework for RSs,\nnamely Compositional Embedding with Regularized Pruning (CERP).

        "summary": "Drift in machine learning refers to the phenomenon where the statistical\nproperties of data or context, in which the model operates, change over time\nleading to a decrease in its performance. Therefore, maintaining a constant\nmonitoring process for machine learning model performance is crucial in order\nto proactively prevent any potential performance regression. However,\nsupervised drift detection methods require human annotation and consequently\nlead to a longer time to detect and mitigate the drift. In our proposed\nunsupervised drift detection method, we follow a two step process. Our first\nstep involves encoding a sample of production data as the target distribution,\nand the model training data as the reference distribution. In the second step,\nwe employ a kernel-based statistical test that utilizes the maximum mean\ndiscrepancy (MMD) distance metric to compare the reference and target\ndistributions and estimate any potential drift. Our method also identifies the\nsubset of production data that is the root cause of the drift. The models\nretrained using these identified high drift samples show improved performance\non online customer experience quality metrics.",

        "summary": "Recommender systems, while transformative in online user experiences, have\nraised concerns over potential provider-side fairness issues. These systems may\ninadvertently favor popular items, thereby marginalizing less popular ones and\ncompromising provider fairness. While previous research has recognized\nprovider-side fairness issues, the investigation into how these biases affect\nbeyond-accuracy aspects of recommendation systems - such as diversity, novelty,\ncoverage, and serendipity - has been less emphasized. In this paper, we address\nthis gap by introducing a simple yet effective post-processing re-ranking model\nthat prioritizes provider fairness, while simultaneously maintaining user\nrelevance and recommendation quality. We then conduct an in-depth evaluation of\nthe model's impact on various aspects of recommendation quality across multiple\ndatasets. Specifically, we apply the post-processing algorithm to four distinct\nrecommendation models across four varied domain datasets, assessing the\nimprovement in each metric, encompassing both accuracy and beyond-accuracy\naspects.

This makes them an attractive choice\nfor the offline evaluation of recommender systems, and several recent works\nhave reported successful adoption of OPE methods to this end. An important\nassumption that makes this work is the absence of unobserved confounders:\nrandom variables that influence both actions and rewards at data collection\ntime. Because the data collection policy is typically under the practitioner's\ncontrol, the unconfoundedness assumption is often left implicit, and its\nviolations are rarely dealt with in the existing literature.\n  This work aims to highlight the problems that arise when performing\noff-policy estimation in the presence of unobserved confounders, specifically\nfocusing on a recommendation use-case. We focus on policy-based estimators,\nwhere the logging propensities are learned from logged data. We characterise\nthe statistical bias that arises due to confounding, and show how existing\ndiagnostics are unable to uncover such cases. Because the bias depends directly\non the true and unobserved logging propensities, it is non-identifiable. As the\nunconfoundedness assumption is famously untestable, this becomes especially\nproblematic. This paper emphasises this common, yet often overlooked issue.\nThrough synthetic data, we empirically show how na\\\"ive propensity estimation\nunder confounding can lead to severely biased metric estimates that are allowed\nto fly under the radar.

However, many of the PR methods\nare based on black-box network models that lack interpretability and\nplug-and-play (PnP) frameworks that are computationally complex and require\ncareful parameter tuning. To address this, we have developed PRISTA-Net, a deep\nunfolding network (DUN) based on the first-order iterative shrinkage\nthresholding algorithm (ISTA). This network utilizes a learnable nonlinear\ntransformation to address the proximal-point mapping sub-problem associated\nwith the sparse priors, and an attention mechanism to focus on phase\ninformation containing image edges, textures, and structures. Additionally, the\nfast Fourier transform (FFT) is used to learn global features to enhance local\ninformation, and the designed logarithmic-based loss function leads to\nsignificant improvements when the noise level is low.

Recent work has evaluated large language models\n(LLMs) on inductive reasoning tasks by directly prompting them yielding \"in\ncontext learning.\" This can work well for straightforward inductive tasks, but\nperforms very poorly on more complex tasks such as the Abstraction and\nReasoning Corpus (ARC). In this work, we propose to improve the inductive\nreasoning ability of LLMs by generating explicit hypotheses at multiple levels\nof abstraction: we prompt the LLM to propose multiple abstract hypotheses about\nthe problem, in natural language, then implement the natural language\nhypotheses as concrete Python programs. These programs can be directly verified\nby running on the observed examples and generalized to novel inputs. Because of\nthe prohibitive cost of generation with state-of-the-art LLMs, we consider a\nmiddle step to filter the set of hypotheses that will be implemented into\nprograms: we either ask the LLM to summarize into a smaller set of hypotheses,\nor ask human annotators to select a subset of the hypotheses. We verify our\npipeline's effectiveness on the ARC visual inductive reasoning benchmark, its\nvariant 1D-ARC, and string transformation dataset SyGuS. On a random 40-problem\nsubset of ARC, our automated pipeline using LLM summaries achieves 27.5%\naccuracy, significantly outperforming the direct prompting baseline (accuracy\nof 12.5%). With the minimal human input of selecting from LLM-generated\ncandidates, the performance is boosted to 37.5%.

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization\nacross diverse tasks, leading individuals to increasingly use them as personal\nassistants and universal computing engines. Nevertheless, a notable obstacle\nemerges when feeding numerical/temporal data into these models, such as data\nsourced from wearables or electronic health records. LLMs employ tokenizers in\ntheir input that break down text into smaller units. However, tokenizers are\nnot designed to represent numerical values and might struggle to understand\nrepetitive patterns and context, treating consecutive values as separate tokens\nand disregarding their temporal relationships. Here, we discuss recent works\nthat employ LLMs for human-centric tasks such as in mobile health sensing and\npresent a case study showing that popular LLMs tokenize temporal data\nincorrectly. To address that, we highlight potential solutions such as prompt\ntuning with lightweight embedding layers as well as multimodal adapters, that\ncan help bridge this \"modality gap\". While the capability of language models to\ngeneralize to other modalities with minimal or no finetuning is exciting, this\npaper underscores the fact that their outputs cannot be meaningful if they\nstumble over input nuances.",

Consequently, it is crucial to bridge the gap\nbetween the prefix2prefix training and seq2seq training to enhance the\ntranslation capability of the SiMT model. In this paper, we propose a novel\nmethod that glances future in curriculum learning to achieve the transition\nfrom the seq2seq training to prefix2prefix training.

This work explores the potential of the latter setting.\nWe discover that by integrating self-evaluation and rewind mechanisms,\nunaligned LLMs can directly produce responses consistent with human preferences\nvia self-boosting. We introduce a novel inference method, Rewindable\nAuto-regressive INference (RAIN), that allows pre-trained LLMs to evaluate\ntheir own generation and use the evaluation results to guide backward rewind\nand forward generation for AI safety. Notably, RAIN operates without the need\nof extra data for model alignment and abstains from any training, gradient\ncomputation, or parameter updates; during the self-evaluation phase, the model\nreceives guidance on which human preference to align with through a\nfixed-template prompt, eliminating the need to modify the initial prompt.\nExperimental results evaluated by GPT-4 and humans demonstrate the\neffectiveness of RAIN: on the HH dataset, RAIN improves the harmlessness rate\nof LLaMA 30B over vanilla inference from 82% to 97%, while maintaining the\nhelpfulness rate.

Despite their emergence, such holistic approaches\nare under-explored.\n  We present a comprehensive survey of holistic CRS methods by summarizing the\nliterature in a structured manner.

Secondly,\nmost of the existing research works have focused on features extracted only\nfrom the question part; features extracted from answers have not been explored\nextensively. We combine both types of features in a linear fashion.

The issue can\ntraced back to the architectural design of VLMs or pre-training data.\nSpecifically, the current VLMs primarily emphasize utilizing multi-modal data\nwith a single image some, rather than multi-modal prompts with interleaved\nmultiple images and text. Even though some newly proposed VLMs could handle\nuser prompts with multiple images, pre-training data does not provide more\nsophisticated multi-modal prompts than interleaved image and text crawled from\nthe web. We propose MMICL to address the issue by considering both the model\nand data perspectives.

However, they currently lack the ability to teach themselves new\nskills, relying instead on being trained on large amounts of human-generated\ndata. We introduce SECToR (Self-Education via Chain-of-Thought Reasoning), a\nproof-of-concept demonstration that language models can successfully teach\nthemselves new skills using chain-of-thought reasoning. Inspired by previous\nwork in both reinforcement learning (Silver et al., 2017) and human cognition\n(Kahneman, 2011), SECToR first uses chain-of-thought reasoning to slowly think\nits way through problems. SECToR then fine-tunes the model to generate those\nsame answers, this time without using chain-of-thought reasoning. Language\nmodels trained via SECToR autonomously learn to add up to 29-digit numbers\nwithout any access to any ground truth examples beyond an initial supervised\nfine-tuning phase consisting only of numbers with 6 or fewer digits. Our\ncentral hypothesis is that chain-of-thought reasoning can act as a policy\nimprovement operator, analogously to how Monte-Carlo Tree Search is used in\nAlphaZero.

Prior work on bias mitigation\noften assumes that ranking scores, which correspond to the utility that a\ndocument holds for a user, can be accurately determined. In reality, there is\nalways a degree of uncertainty in the estimate of expected document utility.\nThis uncertainty can be approximated by viewing ranking models through a\nBayesian perspective, where the standard deterministic score becomes a\ndistribution.\n  In this work, we investigate whether uncertainty estimates can be used to\ndecrease the amount of bias in the ranked results, while minimizing loss in\nmeasured utility. We introduce a simple method that uses the uncertainty of the\nranking scores for an uncertainty-aware, post hoc approach to bias mitigation.\nWe compare our proposed method with existing baselines for bias mitigation with\nrespect to the utility-fairness trade-off, the controllability of methods, and\ncomputational costs.

However, existing pre-training methods for\nsymbolic melody generation struggle to capture multi-scale, multi-dimensional\nstructural information in note sequences, due to the domain knowledge\ndiscrepancy between text and music. Moreover, the lack of available large-scale\nsymbolic melody datasets limits the pre-training improvement. In this paper, we\npropose MelodyGLM, a multi-task pre-training framework for generating melodies\nwith long-term structure. We design the melodic n-gram and long span sampling\nstrategies to create local and global blank infilling tasks for modeling the\nlocal and global structures in melodies. Specifically, we incorporate pitch\nn-grams, rhythm n-grams, and their combined n-grams into the melodic n-gram\nblank infilling tasks for modeling the multi-dimensional structures in\nmelodies. To this end, we have constructed a large-scale symbolic melody\ndataset, MelodyNet, containing more than 0.4 million melody pieces. MelodyNet\nis utilized for large-scale pre-training and domain-specific n-gram lexicon\nconstruction. Both subjective and objective evaluations demonstrate that\nMelodyGLM surpasses the standard and previous pre-training methods.

To improve\nquality, one standard approach is to study real users through interviews, user\nstudies and direct feedback, find areas where labels are systematically\ndisagreeing with users, then educate labellers about user needs through judging\nguidelines, training and monitoring. This paper introduces an alternate\napproach for improving label quality.

        "summary": "Designing reward functions is a longstanding challenge in reinforcement\nlearning (RL); it requires specialized knowledge or domain data, leading to\nhigh costs for development. To address this, we introduce Text2Reward, a\ndata-free framework that automates the generation of dense reward functions\nbased on large language models (LLMs). Given a goal described in natural\nlanguage, Text2Reward generates dense reward functions as an executable program\ngrounded in a compact representation of the environment. Unlike inverse RL and\nrecent work that uses LLMs to write sparse reward codes, Text2Reward produces\ninterpretable, free-form dense reward codes that cover a wide range of tasks,\nutilize existing packages, and allow iterative refinement with human feedback.\nWe evaluate Text2Reward on two robotic manipulation benchmarks (ManiSkill2,\nMetaWorld) and two locomotion environments of MuJoCo. On 13 of the 17\nmanipulation tasks, policies trained with generated reward codes achieve\nsimilar or better task success rates and convergence speed than expert-written\nreward codes. For locomotion tasks, our method learns six novel locomotion\nbehaviors with a success rate exceeding 94%. Furthermore, we show that the\npolicies trained in the simulator with our method can be deployed in the real\nworld. Finally, Text2Reward further improves the policies by refining their\nreward functions with human feedback. Video results are available at\nhttps://text-to-reward.github.io",

        "summary": "In the realm of e-commerce, popular platforms utilize widgets to recommend\nadvertisements and products to their users. However, the prevalence of mobile\ndevice usage on these platforms introduces a unique challenge due to the\nlimited screen real estate available. Consequently, the positioning of relevant\nwidgets becomes pivotal in capturing and maintaining customer engagement. Given\nthe restricted screen size of mobile devices, widgets placed at the top of the\ninterface are more prominently displayed and thus attract greater user\nattention. Conversely, widgets positioned further down the page require users\nto scroll, resulting in reduced visibility and subsequent lower impression\nrates. Therefore it becomes imperative to place relevant widgets on top.\nHowever, selecting relevant widgets to display is a challenging task as the\nwidgets can be heterogeneous, widgets can be introduced or removed at any given\ntime from the platform. In this work, we model the vertical widget reordering\nas a contextual multi-arm bandit problem with delayed batch feedback. The\nobjective is to rank the vertical widgets in a personalized manner.

Meanwhile,\nrecent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their capability in\ngenerating layouts and programs to control downstream visual modules such as\nimage generation models. This raises an important question: can we leverage the\nknowledge embedded in these LLMs for temporally consistent long video\ngeneration? In this paper, we propose VideoDirectorGPT, a novel framework for\nconsistent multi-scene video generation that uses the knowledge of LLMs for\nvideo content planning and grounded video generation. Specifically, given a\nsingle text prompt, we first ask our video planner LLM (GPT-4) to expand it\ninto a 'video plan', which involves generating the scene descriptions, the\nentities with their respective layouts, the background for each scene, and\nconsistency groupings of the entities and backgrounds. Next, guided by this\noutput from the video planner, our video generator, Layout2Vid, has explicit\ncontrol over spatial layouts and can maintain temporal consistency of\nentities/backgrounds across scenes, while only trained with image-level\nannotations. Our experiments demonstrate that VideoDirectorGPT framework\nsubstantially improves layout and movement control in both single- and\nmulti-scene video generation and can generate multi-scene videos with visual\nconsistency across scenes, while achieving competitive performance with SOTAs\nin open-domain single-scene T2V generation. We also demonstrate that our\nframework can dynamically control the strength for layout guidance and can also\ngenerate videos with user-provided images.

Such advancements, while garnering significant attention, have\nconcurrently elicited various concerns. The potential of these models is\nundeniably vast; however, they may yield texts that are imprecise, misleading,\nor even detrimental. Consequently, it becomes paramount to employ alignment\ntechniques to ensure these models to exhibit behaviors consistent with human\nvalues.\n  This survey endeavors to furnish an extensive exploration of alignment\nmethodologies designed for LLMs, in conjunction with the extant capability\nresearch in this domain. Adopting the lens of AI alignment, we categorize the\nprevailing methods and emergent proposals for the alignment of LLMs into outer\nand inner alignment. We also probe into salient issues including the models'\ninterpretability, and potential vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks. To\nassess LLM alignment, we present a wide variety of benchmarks and evaluation\nmethodologies. After discussing the state of alignment research for LLMs, we\nfinally cast a vision toward the future, contemplating the promising avenues of\nresearch that lie ahead.\n  Our aspiration for this survey extends beyond merely spurring research\ninterests in this realm. We also envision bridging the gap between the AI\nalignment research community and the researchers engrossed in the capability\nexploration of LLMs for both capable and safe LLMs.",

However, we demonstrate that this is not always achievable,\nresulting in a significant reduction in ranking performance. In this work, we\naim to answer if or when the true relevance can be recovered from click data,\nwhich is a foundation issue for ULTR field. We first define a ranking model as\nidentifiable if it can recover the true relevance up to a scaling\ntransformation, which is enough for pairwise ranking objective. Then we explore\nan equivalent condition for identifiability that can be novely expressed as a\ngraph connectivity test problem: if and only if a graph (namely identifiability\ngraph, or IG) constructed on the underlying structure of the dataset is\nconnected, we can guarantee that the relevance can be correctly recovered.

We introduce unbiased feature learning through\nadversarial training, using adversarial perturbation to enhance feature\nrepresentation. The adversaries improve model generalization for\nunder-represented features.

Stronger perturbations are applied to feature values with\nfewer combination varieties to improve generalization, while higher weights for\nlow-frequency features address training imbalances. We leverage the Adaptive\nAdversarial perturbation based on the widely-applied Factorization Machine\n(AAFM) as our backbone model. In experiments, AAFM surpasses strong baselines\nin both fairness and accuracy measures. AAFM excels in providing item- and\nuser-fairness for single- and multi-feature tasks, showcasing their versatility\nand scalability.

Inspired by this observation, we introduce the first open-source\nbenchmark to utilize external large language models (LLMs) for ASR error\ncorrection, where N-best decoding hypotheses provide informative elements for\ntrue transcription prediction. This approach is a paradigm shift from the\ntraditional language model rescoring strategy that can only select one\ncandidate hypothesis as the output transcription.

        "summary": "Recommendation systems rely on historical clicks to learn user interests and\nprovide appropriate items. However, current studies tend to treat clicks\nequally, which may ignore the assorted intensities of user interests in\ndifferent clicks. In this paper, we aim to achieve multi-granularity Click\nconfidence Learning via Self-Distillation in recommendation (CLSD). Due to the\nlack of supervised signals in click confidence, we first apply self-supervised\nlearning to obtain click confidence scores via a global self-distillation\nmethod. After that, we define a local confidence function to adapt confidence\nscores at the user group level, since the confidence distributions can be\nvaried among user groups. With the combination of multi-granularity confidence\nlearning, we can distinguish the quality of clicks and model user interests\nmore accurately without involving extra data and model structures. The\nsignificant improvements over different backbones on industrial offline and\nonline experiments in a real-world recommender system prove the effectiveness\nof our model.

        "summary": "Zero-shot translation (ZST), which is generally based on a multilingual\nneural machine translation model, aims to translate between unseen language\npairs in training data. The common practice to guide the zero-shot language\nmapping during inference is to deliberately insert the source and target\nlanguage IDs, e.g., &lt;EN&gt; for English and &lt;DE&gt; for German. Recent studies have\nshown that language IDs sometimes fail to navigate the ZST task, making them\nsuffer from the off-target problem (non-target language words exist in the\ngenerated translation) and, therefore, difficult to apply the current\nmultilingual translation model to a broad range of zero-shot language\nscenarios. To understand when and why the navigation capabilities of language\nIDs are weakened, we compare two extreme decoder input cases in the ZST\ndirections: Off-Target (OFF) and On-Target (ON) cases. By contrastively\nvisualizing the contextual word representations (CWRs) of these cases with\nteacher forcing, we show that 1) the CWRs of different languages are\neffectively distributed in separate regions when the sentence and ID are\nmatched (ON setting), and 2) if the sentence and ID are unmatched (OFF\nsetting), the CWRs of different languages are chaotically distributed. Our\nanalyses suggest that although they work well in ideal ON settings, language\nIDs become fragile and lose their navigation ability when faced with off-target\ntokens, which commonly exist during inference but are rare in training\nscenarios. In response, we employ unlikelihood tuning on the negative (OFF)\nsamples to minimize their probability such that the language IDs can\ndiscriminate between the on- and off-target tokens during training. Experiments\nspanning 40 ZST directions show that our method reduces the off-target ratio by\n-48.0% on average, leading to a +9.1 BLEU improvement with only an extra +0.3%\ntuning cost.",

As a result, ToRA models significantly outperform\nopen-source models on 10 mathematical reasoning datasets across all scales with\n13%-19% absolute improvements on average. Notably, ToRA-7B reaches 44.6% on the\ncompetition-level dataset MATH, surpassing the best open-source model\nWizardMath-70B by 22% absolute. ToRA-34B is also the first open-source model\nthat achieves an accuracy exceeding 50% on MATH, which significantly\noutperforms GPT-4's CoT result, and is competitive with GPT-4 solving problems\nwith programs. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the\nbenefits and remaining challenges of tool interaction for mathematical\nreasoning, providing valuable insights for future research.",

        "summary": "This paper assesses the potential for the large language models (LLMs) GPT-4\nand GPT-3.5 to aid in deriving insight from education feedback surveys.\nExploration of LLM use cases in education has focused on teaching and learning,\nwith less exploration of capabilities in education feedback analysis. Survey\nanalysis in education involves goals such as finding gaps in curricula or\nevaluating teachers, often requiring time-consuming manual processing of\ntextual responses. LLMs have the potential to provide a flexible means of\nachieving these goals without specialized machine learning models or\nfine-tuning. We demonstrate a versatile approach to such goals by treating them\nas sequences of natural language processing (NLP) tasks including\nclassification (multi-label, multi-class, and binary), extraction, thematic\nanalysis, and sentiment analysis, each performed by LLM. We apply these\nworkflows to a real-world dataset of 2500 end-of-course survey comments from\nbiomedical science courses, and evaluate a zero-shot approach (i.e., requiring\nno examples or labeled training data) across all tasks, reflecting education\nsettings, where labeled data is often scarce. By applying effective prompting\npractices, we achieve human-level performance on multiple tasks with GPT-4,\nenabling workflows necessary to achieve typical goals. We also show the\npotential of inspecting LLMs' chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for providing\ninsight that may foster confidence in practice. Moreover, this study features\ndevelopment of a versatile set of classification categories, suitable for\nvarious course types (online, hybrid, or in-person) and amenable to\ncustomization.

By generating code snippets and executing them through task-specific\nApplication Programming Interfaces (APIs), they can offload certain functions\nto dedicated external modules, such as image encoding and performing\ncalculations. However, most existing approaches to augment LLMs with tools are\nconstrained by general-purpose APIs and lack the flexibility for tailoring them\nto specific tasks. In this work, we present CRAFT, a general tool creation and\nretrieval framework for LLMs. It creates toolsets specifically curated for the\ntasks and equips LLMs with a component that retrieves tools from these sets to\nenhance their capability to solve complex tasks. For each task, we collect\nspecific code solutions by prompting GPT-4 to solve the training examples.\nFollowing a validation step ensuring the correctness, these solutions are\nabstracted into code snippets to enhance reusability, and deduplicated for\nhigher quality. At inference time, the language model retrieves snippets from\nthe toolsets and then executes them or generates the output conditioning on the\nretrieved snippets.

We study direct edits to model weights because (1) this approach\nshould guarantee that particular deleted information is never extracted by\nfuture prompt attacks, and (2) it should protect against whitebox attacks,\nwhich is necessary for making claims about safety/privacy in a setting where\npublicly available model weights could be used to elicit sensitive information.\nOur threat model assumes that an attack succeeds if the answer to a sensitive\nquestion is located among a set of B generated candidates, based on scenarios\nwhere the information would be insecure if the answer is among B candidates.\nExperimentally, we show that even state-of-the-art model editing methods such\nas ROME struggle to truly delete factual information from models like GPT-J, as\nour whitebox and blackbox attacks can recover \"deleted\" information from an\nedited model 38% of the time.

This disparate representation often\nleads to bias in exposure given to the items in the recommendation results.\nExtensive research examined this bias from item perspective and attempted to\nmitigate it by enhancing the recommendation of less popular items. However, a\nrecent research has revealed the impact of this bias on users. Users with\ndifferent degree of tolerance toward popular items are not fairly served by the\nrecommendation system: users interested in less popular items receive more\npopular items in their recommendations, while users interested in popular items\nare recommended what they want. This is mainly due to the popularity bias that\npopular items are over-recommended. In this paper, we aim at investigating the\nfactors leading to this user-side unfairness of popularity bias in recommender\nsystems. In particular, we investigate two factors: 1) the relationship between\nthis unfairness and users' interest toward items' categories (e.g., movie\ngenres), 2) the relationship between this unfairness and the diversity of the\npopularity group in users' profile (the degree to which the user is interested\nin items with different degree of popularity).

In this paper, we study how to\nautomate feature preprocessing (Auto-FP) for tabular data. Due to the large\nsearch space, a brute-force solution is prohibitively expensive. To address\nthis challenge, we interestingly observe that Auto-FP can be modelled as either\na hyperparameter optimization (HPO) or a neural architecture search (NAS)\nproblem.

This study\nemployed the HBSL model to analyze a corpus of 456 Jazz improvisations,\nspanning 1905 to 2009, from 78 distinct Jazz musicians.

We conduct two case studies, showing that succinct DSPy programs can\nexpress and optimize sophisticated LM pipelines that reason about math word\nproblems, tackle multi-hop retrieval, answer complex questions, and control\nagent loops. Within minutes of compiling, a few lines of DSPy allow GPT-3.5 and\nllama2-13b-chat to self-bootstrap pipelines that outperform standard few-shot\nprompting (generally by over 25% and 65%, respectively) and pipelines with\nexpert-created demonstrations (by up to 5-46% and 16-40%, respectively). On top\nof that, DSPy programs compiled to open and relatively small LMs like\n770M-parameter T5 and llama2-13b-chat are competitive with approaches that rely\non expert-written prompt chains for proprietary GPT-3.5.

Cross-Architecture Binary Code\nSimilarity Search has been explored in numerous studies and has used a wide\nrange of different data sources to achieve its goals. The data sources\ntypically used draw on common structures derived from binaries such as function\ncontrol flow graphs or binary level call graphs, the output of the disassembly\nprocess or the outputs of a dynamic analysis approach. One data source which\nhas received less attention is binary intermediate representations.

The problem\nis complex since the client's product description may be: (1) potentially\nnoisy; (2) short and uninformative (e.g., missing information about model and\nsize); and (3) cross-language. In this paper, we formalize this problem as a\nranking task: given an initial client product specification (query), return the\nmost appropriate standardized descriptions (response). In this paper, we\npropose TPDR, a two-step Transformer-based Product and Class Description\nRetrieval method that is able to explore the semantic correspondence between IS\nand SD, by exploiting attention mechanisms and contrastive learning. First,\nTPDR employs the transformers as two encoders sharing the embedding vector\nspace: one for encoding the IS and another for the SD, in which corresponding\npairs (IS, SD) must be close in the vector space. Closeness is further enforced\nby a contrastive learning mechanism leveraging a specialized loss function.\nTPDR also exploits a (second) re-ranking step based on syntactic features that\nare very important for the exact matching (model, dimension) of certain\nproducts that may have been neglected by the transformers. To evaluate our\nproposal, we consider 11 datasets from a real company, covering different\napplication contexts. Our solution was able to retrieve the correct\nstandardized product before the 5th ranking position in 71% of the cases and\nits correct category in the first position in 80% of the situations. Moreover,\nthe effectiveness gains over purely syntactic or semantic baselines reach up to\n3.7 times, solving cases that none of the approaches in isolation can do by\nthemselves.",

What is crucial in this method\nis the use of an environment for external feedback, which offers a more\ndeliberate and adaptive problem-solving mechanism that moves beyond the\nlimitations of existing techniques. Our experimental evaluation across diverse\ndomains, such as programming, HotPotQA, and WebShop, illustrates the\napplicability of LATS for both reasoning and acting. In particular, LATS\nachieves 94.4\\% for programming on HumanEval with GPT-4 and an average score of\n75.9 for web browsing on WebShop with GPT-3.5, demonstrating the effectiveness\nand generality of our method.",

Recently, much attention\nhas been directed towards the retrieval of irregular patterns within industrial\nor medical images by extracting features from the images, such as deep\nfeatures, colour-based features, shape-based features and local features. This\nhas applications across a spectrum of industries, including fault inspection,\ndisease diagnosis, and maintenance prediction. This paper proposes an image\nretrieval framework to search for images containing similar irregular patterns\nby extracting a set of morphological features (DefChars) from images; the\ndatasets employed in this paper contain wind turbine blade images with defects,\nchest computerised tomography scans with COVID-19 infection, heatsink images\nwith defects, and lake ice images. The proposed framework was evaluated with\ndifferent feature extraction methods (DefChars, resized raw image, local binary\npattern, and scale-invariant feature transforms) and distance metrics to\ndetermine the most efficient parameters in terms of retrieval performance\nacross datasets. The retrieval results show that the proposed framework using\nthe DefChars and the Manhattan distance metric achieves a mean average\nprecision of 80% and a low standard deviation of 0.09 across classes of\nirregular patterns, outperforming alternative feature-metric combinations\nacross all datasets. Furthermore, the low standard deviation between each class\nhighlights DefChars' capability for a reliable image retrieval task, even in\nthe presence of class imbalances or small-sized datasets.",

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered considerable attention in\nrecommender systems. To achieve LLM-based recommendation, item indexing and\ngeneration grounding are two essential steps, bridging between recommendation\nitems and natural language. Item indexing assigns a unique identifier to\nrepresent each item in natural language, and generation grounding grounds the\ngenerated token sequences to in-corpus items. However, previous works suffer\nfrom inherent limitations in the two steps. For item indexing, existing\nID-based identifiers (e.g., numeric IDs) and description-based identifiers\n(e.g., titles) often compromise semantic richness or uniqueness. Moreover,\ngeneration grounding might inadvertently produce out-of-corpus identifiers.\nWorse still, autoregressive generation heavily relies on the initial token's\nquality. To combat these issues, we propose a novel multi-facet paradigm,\nnamely TransRec, to bridge the LLMs to recommendation. Specifically, TransRec\nemploys multi-facet identifiers that incorporate ID, title, and attribute,\nachieving both distinctiveness and semantics. Additionally, we introduce a\nspecialized data structure for TransRec to guarantee the in-corpus identifier\ngeneration and adopt substring indexing to encourage LLMs to generate from any\nposition. We implement TransRec on two backbone LLMs, i.e., BART-large and\nLLaMA-7B.

In this work, we show that reducing\nhallucination on a synthetic task can also reduce hallucination on real-world\ndownstream tasks. Our method, SynTra, first designs a synthetic task where\nhallucinations are easy to elicit and measure. It next optimizes the LLM's\nsystem message via prefix-tuning on the synthetic task, and finally transfers\nthe system message to realistic, hard-to-optimize tasks. Across three realistic\nabstractive summarization tasks, SynTra reduces hallucination for two\n13B-parameter LLMs using only a synthetic retrieval task for supervision. We\nalso find that optimizing the system message rather than the model weights can\nbe critical; fine-tuning the entire model on the synthetic task can\ncounterintuitively increase hallucination.

The diverse inference\nconstraints in these scenarios necessitate practitioners to train foundation\nmodels such as PaLM 2, Llama, &amp; ViTs as a series of models of varying sizes.\nDue to significant training costs, only a select few model sizes are trained\nand supported, limiting more fine-grained control over relevant tradeoffs,\nincluding latency, cost, and accuracy. This work introduces MatFormer, a nested\nTransformer architecture designed to offer elasticity in a variety of\ndeployment constraints. Each Feed Forward Network (FFN) block of a MatFormer\nmodel is jointly optimized with a few nested smaller FFN blocks. This training\nprocedure allows for the Mix'n'Match of model granularities across layers --\ni.e., a trained universal MatFormer model enables extraction of hundreds of\naccurate smaller models, which were never explicitly optimized. We empirically\ndemonstrate MatFormer's effectiveness across different model classes (decoders\n&amp; encoders), modalities (language &amp; vision), and scales (up to 2.6B\nparameters).

In this paper, we study\nthe privacy implications of fine-tuning LLMs on user data. To this end, we\ndefine a realistic threat model, called user inference, wherein an attacker\ninfers whether or not a user's data was used for fine-tuning. We implement\nattacks for this threat model that require only a small set of samples from a\nuser (possibly different from the samples used for training) and black-box\naccess to the fine-tuned LLM. We find that LLMs are susceptible to user\ninference attacks across a variety of fine-tuning datasets, at times with near\nperfect attack success rates. Further, we investigate which properties make\nusers vulnerable to user inference, finding that outlier users (i.e. those with\ndata distributions sufficiently different from other users) and users who\ncontribute large quantities of data are most susceptible to attack. Finally, we\nexplore several heuristics for mitigating privacy attacks. We find that\ninterventions in the training algorithm, such as batch or per-example gradient\nclipping and early stopping fail to prevent user inference. However, limiting\nthe number of fine-tuning samples from a single user can reduce attack\neffectiveness, albeit at the cost of reducing the total amount of fine-tuning\ndata.",

While previous research has mainly focused on\nsentence-level relation extraction, recent studies have expanded the scope to\ndocument-level relation extraction.

To mitigate the need for manual annotation, recent\nweakly-supervised approaches have been developed for sentence-level relation\nextraction while limited work has been done on document-level relation\nextraction.

To address these challenges, we propose PromptRE, a novel\nweakly-supervised document-level relation extraction method that combines\nprompting-based techniques with data programming. Furthermore, PromptRE\nincorporates the label distribution and entity types as prior knowledge to\nimprove the performance. By leveraging the strengths of both prompting and data\nprogramming, PromptRE achieves improved performance in relation classification\nand effectively handles the \"no relation\" problem.

To measure performance on generating scientific\nprotocols, we use an LLM to convert a natural language protocol into\npseudocode, and then evaluate an LLM's ability to reconstruct the pseudocode\nfrom a high-level description and a list of admissible pseudocode functions. We\nevaluate GPT-3 and GPT-4 on this task and explore their robustness. We\nexternally validate the utility of pseudocode representations of text by\ngenerating accurate novel protocols using retrieved pseudocode, and we run a\ngenerated protocol successfully in our biological laboratory. Our framework is\nextensible to the evaluation and improvement of language model planning\nabilities in other areas of science or other areas that lack automatic\nevaluation.",

Especially in web table retrieval (WTR) experiments,\naccounting for multimodal properties of tables boosts effectiveness. However,\nit still remains an open question how the single modalities affect user\nexperience in particular. Previous work analyzed WTR performance in ad-hoc\nretrieval benchmarks, which neglects interactive search behavior and limits the\nconclusion about the implications for real-world user environments.\n  To this end, this work presents an in-depth evaluation of simulated\ninteractive WTR search sessions as a more cost-efficient and reproducible\nalternative to real user studies. As a first of its kind, we introduce\ninteractive query reformulation strategies based on Doc2Query, incorporating\ncognitive states of simulated user knowledge. Our evaluations include two\nperspectives on user effectiveness by considering different cost paradigms,\nnamely query-wise and time-oriented measures of effort. Our multi-perspective\nevaluation scheme reveals new insights about query strategies, the impact of\nmodalities, and different user types in simulated WTR search sessions.",

A diagram is a symbolic/schematic representation that explains\ninformation using structurally rich and spatially complex visualizations (e.g.,\na dense combination of related objects, text labels, directional arrows,\nconnection lines, etc.). Existing state-of-the-art T2I models often fail at\ndiagram generation because they lack fine-grained object layout control when\nmany objects are densely connected via complex relations such as arrows/lines\nand also often fail to render comprehensible text labels. To address this gap,\nwe present DiagrammerGPT, a novel two-stage text-to-diagram generation\nframework that leverages the layout guidance capabilities of LLMs (e.g., GPT-4)\nto generate more accurate open-domain, open-platform diagrams. In the first\nstage, we use LLMs to generate and iteratively refine 'diagram plans' (in a\nplanner-auditor feedback loop) which describe all the entities (objects and\ntext labels), their relationships (arrows or lines), and their bounding box\nlayouts.

Siegelmann and Sontag (1992)\nfamously showed that RNNs with rational weights and hidden states and unbounded\ncomputation time are Turing complete. However, LMs define weightings over\nstrings in addition to just (unweighted) language membership and the analysis\nof the computational power of RNN LMs (RLMs) should reflect this. We extend the\nTuring completeness result to the probabilistic case, showing how a rationally\nweighted RLM with unbounded computation time can simulate any probabilistic\nTuring machine (PTM). Since, in practice, RLMs work in real-time, processing a\nsymbol at every time step, we treat the above result as an upper bound on the\nexpressivity of RLMs. We also provide a lower bound by showing that under the\nrestriction to real-time computation, such models can simulate deterministic\nreal-time rational PTMs.",

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach rooted in curriculum\nlearning to address this problem.

This process identifies potential\nhard negatives, alleviating issues arising from high-loss functions due to a\nscarcity of hard triples. Our approach then applies hard triplet mining in the\naugmented embedding space to further optimize the model.

As the number of users and items continues to grow,\nthis design becomes inefficient and hard to scale. Recent lightweight embedding\nmethods have enabled different users and items to have diverse embedding sizes,\nbut are commonly subject to two major drawbacks. Firstly, they limit the\nembedding size search to optimizing a heuristic balancing the recommendation\nquality and the memory complexity, where the trade-off coefficient needs to be\nmanually tuned for every memory budget requested. The implicitly enforced\nmemory complexity term can even fail to cap the parameter usage, making the\nresultant embedding table fail to meet the memory budget strictly.

In this work,\nwe investigate the validity of instead reformulating such tasks as modular\nneurosymbolic programming, which we call LINC: Logical Inference via\nNeurosymbolic Computation. In LINC, the LLM acts as a semantic parser,\ntranslating premises and conclusions from natural language to expressions in\nfirst-order logic. These expressions are then offloaded to an external theorem\nprover, which symbolically performs deductive inference. Leveraging this\napproach, we observe significant performance gains on FOLIO and a balanced\nsubset of ProofWriter for three different models in nearly all experimental\nconditions we evaluate. On ProofWriter, augmenting the comparatively small\nopen-source StarCoder+ (15.5B parameters) with LINC even outperforms GPT-3.5\nand GPT-4 with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting by an absolute 38% and 10%,\nrespectively.

First, it is created through a novel\nneurosymbolic synthetic-to-natural generation algorithm, enabling the\nconstruction of complex reasoning instances that challenge GPT-4 (e.g., murder\nmysteries roughly 1000 words in length) and which can be scaled further as more\ncapable LLMs are released. Second, our dataset instances are free text\nnarratives corresponding to real-world domains of reasoning; this makes it\nsimultaneously much more challenging than other synthetically-crafted\nbenchmarks while remaining realistic and tractable for human annotators to\nsolve with high accuracy.

Given the incredible scale of this data, up to\ntrillions of tokens, it is all but certain that it includes potentially\nproblematic text such as copyrighted materials, personally identifiable\ninformation, and test data for widely reported reference benchmarks. However,\nwe currently have no way to know which data of these types is included or in\nwhat proportions. In this paper, we study the pretraining data detection\nproblem: given a piece of text and black-box access to an LLM without knowing\nthe pretraining data, can we determine if the model was trained on the provided\ntext? To facilitate this study, we introduce a dynamic benchmark WIKIMIA that\nuses data created before and after model training to support gold truth\ndetection. We also introduce a new detection method Min-K% Prob based on a\nsimple hypothesis: an unseen example is likely to contain a few outlier words\nwith low probabilities under the LLM, while a seen example is less likely to\nhave words with such low probabilities. Min-K% Prob can be applied without any\nknowledge about the pretraining corpus or any additional training, departing\nfrom previous detection methods that require training a reference model on data\nthat is similar to the pretraining data. Moreover, our experiments demonstrate\nthat Min-K% Prob achieves a 7.4% improvement on WIKIMIA over these previous\nmethods.

While Transformer-based generative modeling has\ngained importance in various AI sub-fields such as NLP and vision, generative\nrecommendation is still in its infancy due to its unique demand on personalized\ngenerative modeling. Existing works on generative recommendation often use\nNLP-oriented Transformer architectures such as T5, GPT, LLaMA and M6, which are\nheavy-weight and are not specifically designed for recommendation tasks.\nLightLM tackles the issue by introducing a light-weight deep and narrow\nTransformer architecture, which is specifically tailored for direct generation\nof recommendation items. This structure is especially apt for straightforward\ngenerative recommendation and stems from the observation that language model\ndoes not have to be too wide for this task, as the input predominantly consists\nof short tokens that are well-suited for the model's capacity. We also show\nthat our devised user and item ID indexing methods, i.e., Spectral\nCollaborative Indexing (SCI) and Graph Collaborative Indexing (GCI), enables\nthe deep and narrow Transformer architecture to outperform large-scale language\nmodels for recommendation. Besides, to address the hallucination problem of\ngenerating items as output, we propose the constrained generation process for\ngenerative recommenders. Experiments on real-world datasets show that LightLM\noutperforms various competitive baselines in terms of both recommendation\naccuracy and efficiency.

Although multimodal recommendations excel in\naccuracy, the introduction of different modalities (e.g., images, text, and\naudio) may expose more users' sensitive information (e.g., gender and age) to\nrecommender systems, resulting in potentially more serious unfairness issues.\nDespite many efforts on fairness, existing fairness-aware methods are either\nincompatible with multimodal scenarios, or lead to suboptimal fairness\nperformance due to neglecting sensitive information of multimodal content. To\nachieve counterfactual fairness in multimodal recommendations, we propose a\nnovel fairness-aware multimodal recommendation approach (dubbed as FMMRec) to\ndisentangle the sensitive and non-sensitive information from modal\nrepresentations and leverage the disentangled modal representations to guide\nfairer representation learning. Specifically, we first disentangle biased and\nfiltered modal representations by maximizing and minimizing their sensitive\nattribute prediction ability respectively. With the disentangled modal\nrepresentations, we mine the modality-based unfair and fair (corresponding to\nbiased and filtered) user-user structures for enhancing explicit user\nrepresentation with the biased and filtered neighbors from the corresponding\nstructures, followed by adversarially filtering out sensitive information.\nExperiments on two real-world public datasets demonstrate the superiority of\nour FMMRec relative to the state-of-the-art baselines.

However, contemporary CRS are limited to\ninquiring binary or multi-choice questions based on a single attribute type\n(e.g., color) per round, which causes excessive rounds of interaction and\ndiminishes the user's experience. To address this, we propose a more realistic\nand efficient conversational recommendation problem setting, called\nMulti-Type-Attribute Multi-round Conversational Recommendation (MTAMCR), which\nenables CRS to inquire about multi-choice questions covering multiple types of\nattributes in each round, thereby improving interactive efficiency. Moreover,\nby formulating MTAMCR as a hierarchical reinforcement learning task, we propose\na Chain-of-Choice Hierarchical Policy Learning (CoCHPL) framework to enhance\nboth the questioning efficiency and recommendation effectiveness in MTAMCR.\nSpecifically, a long-term policy over options (i.e., ask or recommend)\ndetermines the action type, while two short-term intra-option policies\nsequentially generate the chain of attributes or items through multi-step\nreasoning and selection, optimizing the diversity and interdependence of\nquestioning attributes. Finally, extensive experiments on four benchmarks\ndemonstrate the superior performance of CoCHPL over prevailing state-of-the-art\nmethods.",

The goal of MatchRank is to produce rankings that maximize\nthe number of filled slots if candidates are evaluated by a human decision\nmaker in the order of the ranking. In this way, MatchRank generalizes the PRP,\nand it subsumes the PRP as a special case when there are no slot constraints.\nOur theoretical analysis shows that MatchRank has a strong approximation\nguarantee without any independence assumptions between slots or candidates.\nFurthermore, we show how MatchRank can be implemented efficiently.

For this purpose, we\nconduct an extensive evaluation and comparison of various closed-source and\nopen-source LLMs, namely, GPT-4, GPT- 3.5, PaLM-2, and LLaMA-2. Our findings\nreveal that most closed-source LLMs are generally better in terms of\nperformance. However, much smaller open-source models like LLaMA- 2 (7B and\n13B) could still achieve performance comparable to the large closed-source\nmodels even in zero-shot scenarios. Considering the privacy concerns of\nclosed-source models for only being accessible via API, alongside the high cost\nassociated with using fine-tuned versions of the closed-source models, the\nopensource models that can achieve competitive performance are more\nadvantageous for industrial use. Balancing performance with associated costs\nand privacy concerns, the LLaMA-2-7B model looks more promising for industrial\nusage. In sum, this paper offers practical insights on using LLMs for\nreal-world business meeting summarization, shedding light on the trade-offs\nbetween performance and cost.",

In conventional\nsequential recommenders, a common approach is to model item sequences using\ndiscrete IDs, learning representations that encode sequential behaviors and\nreflect user preferences. Inspired by recent success in empowering large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to understand and reason over diverse modality data\n(e.g., image, audio, 3D points), a compelling research question arises: ``Can\nLLMs understand and work with hidden representations from ID-based sequential\nrecommenders?''.To answer this, we propose a simple framework, RecInterpreter,\nwhich examines the capacity of open-source LLMs to decipher the representation\nspace of sequential recommenders. Specifically, with the multimodal pairs (\\ie\nrepresentations of interaction sequence and text narrations), RecInterpreter\nfirst uses a lightweight adapter to map the representations into the token\nembedding space of the LLM. Subsequently, it constructs a sequence-recovery\nprompt that encourages the LLM to generate textual descriptions for items\nwithin the interaction sequence. Taking a step further, we propose a\nsequence-residual prompt instead, which guides the LLM in identifying the\nresidual item by contrasting the representations before and after integrating\nthis residual into the existing sequence. Empirical results showcase that our\nRecInterpreter enhances the exemplar LLM, LLaMA, to understand hidden\nrepresentations from ID-based sequential recommenders, especially when guided\nby our sequence-residual prompts.

Although\neffective, we reveal two inherent limitations:(1) it may differ from human\nbehavior in that a user could imagine an oracle item in mind and select\npotential items matching the oracle; and (2) the classification is limited in\nthe candidate pool with noisy or easy supervision from negative samples, which\ndilutes the preference signals towards the oracle item.

Consequently, this makes it non-trivial to apply it in a\npractical setting with long input. Various complex methods have claimed to\novercome this limit, but recent research questions the efficacy of these models\nacross different classification tasks. These complex architectures evaluated on\ncarefully curated long datasets perform at par or worse than simple baselines.\nIn this work, we propose a relatively simple extension to vanilla BERT\narchitecture called ChunkBERT that allows finetuning of any pretrained models\nto perform inference on arbitrarily long text. The proposed method is based on\nchunking token representations and CNN layers, making it compatible with any\npre-trained BERT. We evaluate chunkBERT exclusively on a benchmark for\ncomparing long-text classification models across a variety of tasks (including\nbinary classification, multi-class classification, and multi-label\nclassification). A BERT model finetuned using the ChunkBERT method performs\nconsistently across long samples in the benchmark while utilizing only a\nfraction (6.25\\%) of the original memory footprint.

To this end, we investigate a novel problem of robust\nPOI recommendation by considering the uncertainty factors of the user\ncheck-ins, and proposes a Bayes-enhanced Multi-view Attention Network.\nSpecifically, we construct personal POI transition graph, the semantic-based\nPOI graph and distance-based POI graph to comprehensively model the\ndependencies among the POIs. As the personal POI transition graph is usually\nsparse and sensitive to noise, we design a Bayes-enhanced spatial dependency\nlearning module for data augmentation from the local view. A Bayesian posterior\nguided graph augmentation approach is adopted to generate a new graph with\ncollaborative signals to increase the data diversity. Then both the original\nand the augmented graphs are used for POI representation learning to counteract\nthe data uncertainty issue. Next, the POI representations of the three view\ngraphs are input into the proposed multi-view attention-based user preference\nlearning module.

In light of the recent advancements in large\nlanguage models (LLMs), which possess extensive knowledge bases and strong\nreasoning capabilities, we propose a novel framework called LLMRec that\nenhances recommender systems by employing three simple yet effective LLM-based\ngraph augmentation strategies. Our approach leverages the rich content\navailable within online platforms (e.g., Netflix, MovieLens) to augment the\ninteraction graph in three ways: (i) reinforcing user-item interaction egde,\n(ii) enhancing the understanding of item node attributes, and (iii) conducting\nuser node profiling, intuitively from the natural language perspective. By\nemploying these strategies, we address the challenges posed by sparse implicit\nfeedback and low-quality side information in recommenders.

Its appeal lies in its potential for lowpower computation and its\nrelevance to a wide array of applications such as chemical reactions, quantum\ncomputation, robotics, and distributed systems. Reversing Petri nets are a\nrecently-proposed extension of Petri nets that implements the three main forms\nof reversibility, namely, backtracking, causal reversing, and\nout-of-causal-order reversing. Their distinguishing feature is the use of named\ntokens that can be combined together to form bonds.

In this\npaper, we extend the translation to handle RPNs with token multiplicity under\nthe individual-token interpretation, a model which allows multiple tokens of\nthe same type to exist in a system. To support the three types of\nreversibility, tokens are associated with their causal history and, while\ntokens of the same type are equally eligible to fire a transition when going\nforward, when going backwards they are able to reverse only the transitions\nthey have previously fired. The new translation, in addition to lifting the\nrestriction on token uniqueness, presents a refined approach for transforming\nRPNs to CPNs through a unifying approach that allows instantiating each of the\nthree types of reversibility.

        "summary": "Dual-encoder-based dense retrieval models have become the standard in IR.\nThey employ large Transformer-based language models, which are notoriously\ninefficient in terms of resources and latency. We propose Fast-Forward indexes\n-- vector forward indexes which exploit the semantic matching capabilities of\ndual-encoder models for efficient and effective re-ranking. Our framework\nenables re-ranking at very high retrieval depths and combines the merits of\nboth lexical and semantic matching via score interpolation. Furthermore, in\norder to mitigate the limitations of dual-encoders, we tackle two main\nchallenges: Firstly, we improve computational efficiency by either\npre-computing representations, avoiding unnecessary computations altogether, or\nreducing the complexity of encoders. This allows us to considerably improve\nranking efficiency and latency. Secondly, we optimize the memory footprint and\nmaintenance cost of indexes; we propose two complementary techniques to reduce\nthe index size and show that, by dynamically dropping irrelevant document\ntokens, the index maintenance efficiency can be improved substantially. We\nperform evaluation to show the effectiveness and efficiency of Fast-Forward\nindexes -- our method has low latency and achieves competitive results without\nthe need for hardware acceleration, such as GPUs.",

Millions of people\nstruggle with tasks on search engines every day.

The task motivates the\nsearch, creating the gap/problematic situation that searchers attempt to\nbridge/resolve and drives search behavior as they work through different task\nfacets. Complex search tasks require more than support for rudimentary fact\nfinding or re-finding. Research on methods to support complex tasks includes\nwork on generating query and website suggestions, personalizing and\ncontextualizing search, and developing new search experiences, including those\nthat span time and space. The recent emergence of generative artificial\nintelligence (AI) and the arrival of assistive agents, or copilots, based on\nthis technology, has the potential to offer further assistance to searchers,\nespecially those engaged in complex tasks.

The implicit reasoning steps are\ndistilled from a teacher model trained on explicit chain-of-thought reasoning,\nand instead of doing reasoning \"horizontally\" by producing intermediate words\none-by-one, we distill it such that the reasoning happens \"vertically\" among\nthe hidden states in different layers.

We answer this question by\ninvestigating LMs' more subtle judgments associated with \"language illusions\"\n-- sentences that are vague in meaning, implausible, or ungrammatical but\nreceive unexpectedly high acceptability judgments by humans. We looked at three\nillusions: the comparative illusion (e.g. \"More people have been to Russia than\nI have\"), the depth-charge illusion (e.g. \"No head injury is too trivial to be\nignored\"), and the negative polarity item (NPI) illusion (e.g. \"The hunter who\nno villager believed to be trustworthy will ever shoot a bear\").

No single LM or metric yielded results\nthat are entirely consistent with human behavior.

        "summary": "RNN-like language models are getting renewed attention from NLP researchers\nin recent years and several models have made significant progress, which\ndemonstrates performance comparable to traditional transformers. However, due\nto the recurrent nature of RNNs, this kind of language model can only store\ninformation in a set of fixed-length state vectors. As a consequence, they\nstill suffer from forgetfulness though after a lot of improvements and\noptimizations, when given complex instructions or prompts. As the prompted\ngeneration is the main and most concerned function of LMs, solving the problem\nof forgetting in the process of generation is no wonder of vital importance. In\nthis paper, focusing on easing the prompt forgetting during generation, we\nproposed an architecture to teach the model memorizing prompt during generation\nby synthetic gradient. To force the model to memorize the prompt, we derive the\nstates that encode the prompt, then transform it into model parameter\nmodification using low-rank gradient approximation, which hard-codes the prompt\ninto model parameters temporarily. We construct a dataset for experiments, and\nthe results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method in solving the\nproblem of forgetfulness in the process of prompted generation. We will release\nall the code upon acceptance.",

However, since performance is highly\nsensitive to the choice of prompts, considerable effort has been devoted to\ncrowd-sourcing prompts or designing methods for prompt optimisation. Yet, we\nstill lack a systematic understanding of how linguistic properties of prompts\ncorrelate with task performance. In this work, we investigate how LLMs of\ndifferent sizes, pre-trained and instruction-tuned, perform on prompts that are\nsemantically equivalent, but vary in linguistic structure. We investigate both\ngrammatical properties such as mood, tense, aspect and modality, as well as\nlexico-semantic variation through the use of synonyms. Our findings contradict\nthe common assumption that LLMs achieve optimal performance on lower perplexity\nprompts that reflect language use in pretraining or instruction-tuning data.\nPrompts transfer poorly between datasets or models, and performance cannot\ngenerally be explained by perplexity, word frequency, ambiguity or prompt\nlength.

        "summary": "Hashing is at the heart of large-scale image similarity search, and recent\nmethods have been substantially improved through deep learning techniques. Such\nalgorithms typically learn continuous embeddings of the data. To avoid a\nsubsequent costly binarization step, a common solution is to employ loss\nfunctions that combine a similarity learning term (to ensure similar images are\ngrouped to nearby embeddings) and a quantization penalty term (to ensure that\nthe embedding entries are close to binarized entries, e.g., -1 or 1). Still,\nthe interaction between these two terms can make learning harder and the\nembeddings worse. We propose an alternative quantization strategy that\ndecomposes the learning problem in two stages: first, perform similarity\nlearning over the embedding space with no quantization; second, find an optimal\northogonal transformation of the embeddings so each coordinate of the embedding\nis close to its sign, and then quantize the transformed embedding through the\nsign function. In the second step, we parametrize orthogonal transformations\nusing Householder matrices to efficiently leverage stochastic gradient descent.\nSince similarity measures are usually invariant under orthogonal\ntransformations, this quantization strategy comes at no cost in terms of\nperformance. The resulting algorithm is unsupervised, fast, hyperparameter-free\nand can be run on top of any existing deep hashing or metric learning\nalgorithm. We provide extensive experimental results showing that this approach\nleads to state-of-the-art performance on widely used image datasets, and,\nunlike other quantization strategies, brings consistent improvements in\nperformance to existing deep hashing algorithms.",

        "summary": "Language models are typically evaluated on their success at predicting the\ndistribution of specific words in specific contexts. Yet linguistic knowledge\nalso encodes relationships between contexts, allowing inferences between word\ndistributions. We investigate the degree to which pre-trained Transformer-based\nlarge language models (LLMs) represent such relationships, focusing on the\ndomain of argument structure. We find that LLMs perform well in generalizing\nthe distribution of a novel noun argument between related contexts that were\nseen during pre-training (e.g., the active object and passive subject of the\nverb spray), succeeding by making use of the semantically-organized structure\nof the embedding space for word embeddings. However, LLMs fail at\ngeneralizations between related contexts that have not been observed during\npre-training, but which instantiate more abstract, but well-attested structural\ngeneralizations (e.g., between the active object and passive subject of an\narbitrary verb). Instead, in this case, LLMs show a bias to generalize based on\nlinear order. This finding points to a limitation with current models and\npoints to a reason for which their training is data-intensive.s reported here\nare available at https://github.com/clay-lab/structural-alternations.",

To test this,\nwe measure linear approximation and causal intervention methods in GPT-J-6B to\nevaluate the degree to which individual hidden states in the network contain\nsignal rich enough to predict future hidden states and, ultimately, token\noutputs.

Explain the Theory of Relativity.' While this ability allows\npersonalization of LLMs and enables human behavior simulation, its effect on\nLLMs' capabilities remain unclear. To fill this gap, we present the first\nextensive study of the unintended side-effects of persona assignment on the\nability of LLMs, specifically ChatGPT, to perform basic reasoning tasks. Our\nstudy covers 24 reasoning datasets and 16 diverse personas spanning 5\nsocio-demographic groups: race, gender, religion, disability, and political\naffiliation. Our experiments unveil that ChatGPT carries deep rooted bias\nagainst various socio-demographics underneath a veneer of fairness. While it\novertly rejects stereotypes when explicitly asked ('Are Black people less\nskilled at mathematics?'), it manifests stereotypical and often erroneous\npresumptions when prompted to answer questions while taking on a persona. These\ncan be observed as abstentions in the model responses, e.g., 'As a Black\nperson, I am unable to answer this question as it requires math knowledge', and\ngenerally result in a substantial drop in performance on reasoning tasks. We\nfind that this inherent deep bias is ubiquitous - 80% of our personas\ndemonstrated bias; it is significant - certain datasets had relative drops in\nperformance of 70%+; and can be especially harmful for certain groups - certain\npersonas had stat. sign. drops on more than 80% of the datasets. Further\nanalysis shows that these persona-induced errors can be hard-to-discern and\nhard-to-avoid. Our findings serve as a cautionary tale that the practice of\nassigning personas to LLMs - a trend on the rise - can surface their\ndeep-rooted biases and have unforeseeable and detrimental side-effects.",

        "summary": "Fairness in Language Models (LMs) remains a longstanding challenge, given the\ninherent biases in training data that can be perpetuated by models and affect\nthe downstream tasks. Recent methods employ expensive retraining or attempt\ndebiasing during inference by constraining model outputs to contrast from a\nreference set of biased templates or exemplars. Regardless, they dont address\nthe primary goal of fairness to maintain equitability across different\ndemographic groups. In this work, we posit that inferencing LMs to generate\nunbiased output for one demographic under a context ensues from being aware of\noutputs for other demographics under the same context. To this end, we propose\nCounterfactually Aware Fair InferencE (CAFIE), a framework that dynamically\ncompares the model understanding of diverse demographics to generate more\nequitable sentences. We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation using base\nLMs of varying sizes and across three diverse datasets and found that CAFIE\noutperforms strong baselines. CAFIE produces fairer text and strikes the best\nbalance between fairness and language modeling capability",

Secondly, humans perceive CAs as social actors, and as a\nresult expect the CA to adhere to social convention. Failure on the part of the\nCA in this respect can lead to a poor interaction and even the perception of\nthreat by the user. As such, this paper presents a survey highlighting a\npotential solution to both categories of problem through the introduction of\ncognitively inspired additions to the CA.

However,\ncurrent datasets only focus on either traditional ad-hoc IR tasks or query\nclarification tasks, the latter being usually seen as a reformulation task from\nthe initial query.

Both are based on the TREC Web Track 2009-12 collection, but cover a\nvery limited number of topics (237 topics), far from being enough for training\nand testing conversational IR models. To fill the gap, we propose a methodology\nto automatically build large-scale conversational IR datasets from ad-hoc IR\ndatasets in order to facilitate explorations on conversational IR. Our\nmethodology is based on two processes: 1) generating query clarification\ninteractions through query clarification and answer generators, and 2)\naugmenting ad-hoc IR datasets with simulated interactions.

To describe\nobjects with similar overall appearance but subtle differences, more and more\nstudies focus on hashing-based fine-grained image retrieval. Existing hashing\nnetworks usually generate both local and global features through attention\nguidance on the same deep activation tensor, which limits the diversity of\nfeature representations. To handle this limitation, we substitute convolutional\ndescriptors for attention-guided features and propose an Attributes Grouping\nand Mining Hashing (AGMH), which groups and embeds the category-specific visual\nattributes in multiple descriptors to generate a comprehensive feature\nrepresentation for efficient fine-grained image retrieval. Specifically, an\nAttention Dispersion Loss (ADL) is designed to force the descriptors to attend\nto various local regions and capture diverse subtle details. Moreover, we\npropose a Stepwise Interactive External Attention (SIEA) to mine critical\nattributes in each descriptor and construct correlations between fine-grained\nattributes and objects. The attention mechanism is dedicated to learning\ndiscrete attributes, which will not cost additional computations in hash codes\ngeneration. Finally, the compact binary codes are learned by preserving\npairwise similarities.

This subtle form of unfairness,\nwhile more pervasive, poses a significant threat to the ethical integrity and\nrights of minority user groups. To comprehensively explore implicit user\nunfairness, our analysis unfolds in three key steps: (1) We uncover the reasons\nfor this implicit user unfairness: LLMs can infer users' sensitive attributes\nfrom non-sensitive attributes (e.g. user names) due to their extensive world\nknowledge. (2) Our findings expose that the magnitude of implicit user\nunfairness within LLMs surpasses the level of explicit user unfairness observed\nin traditional recommender models, signifying a more alarming issue of\nunfairness, i.e. some non-sensitive features of users like names may result in\nmore serious discrimination phenomena. (3) We analyze the long-term effect of\nimplicit user unfairness, identifying that it will reinforce information\nbubbles at an accelerated rate compared to traditional RS. We emphasize the\nneed to identify and mitigate implicit user unfairness, aiming to avert the\npotential human-LLMs recommendation systems deterioration.",

This has led to serious\nskepticism in the research community on their real-world impact. This paper\nrepresents an important milestone in generative retrieval research by showing,\nfor the first time, that generative retrieval models can be trained to perform\neffectively on large-scale standard retrieval benchmarks. For doing so, we\npropose RIPOR- an optimization framework for generative retrieval that can be\nadopted by any encoder-decoder architecture.

To address this issue, RIPOR introduces a novel\nprefix-oriented ranking optimization algorithm. Second, initial document IDs\nshould be constructed based on relevance associations between queries and\ndocuments, instead of the syntactic and semantic information in the documents.\nRIPOR addresses this issue using a relevance-based document ID construction\napproach that quantizes relevance-based representations learned for documents.\nEvaluation on MSMARCO and TREC Deep Learning Track reveals that RIPOR surpasses\nstate-of-the-art generative retrieval models by a large margin (e.g., 30.5% MRR\nimprovements on MS MARCO Dev Set), and perform better on par with popular dense\nretrieval models.",

        "summary": "Abstract grammatical knowledge - of parts of speech and grammatical patterns\n- is key to the capacity for linguistic generalization in humans. But how\nabstract is grammatical knowledge in large language models? In the human\nliterature, compelling evidence for grammatical abstraction comes from\nstructural priming. A sentence that shares the same grammatical structure as a\npreceding sentence is processed and produced more readily. Because confounds\nexist when using stimuli in a single language, evidence of abstraction is even\nmore compelling from crosslingual structural priming, where use of a syntactic\nstructure in one language primes an analogous structure in another language. We\nmeasure crosslingual structural priming in large language models, comparing\nmodel behavior to human experimental results from eight crosslingual\nexperiments covering six languages, and four monolingual structural priming\nexperiments in three non-English languages. We find evidence for abstract\nmonolingual and crosslingual grammatical representations in the models that\nfunction similarly to those found in humans. These results demonstrate that\ngrammatical representations in multilingual language models are not only\nsimilar across languages, but they can causally influence text produced in\ndifferent languages.",

IterCQR iteratively trains the QR model by\ndirectly leveraging signal from information retrieval (IR) as a reward. Our\nproposed IterCQR method shows state-of-the-art performance on two datasets,\ndemonstrating its effectiveness on both sparse and dense retrievers.

Second, while the visual\ninstruction tuning data is generally structured in a multi-turn dialogue\nformat, the connections and dependencies among consecutive conversational turns\nare weak. This reduces the capacity for effective multi-turn interactions. To\ntackle these, we propose a novel categorization of the NLF into two key types:\ncritique and refinement.

This accessibility can be achieved via two distinct\navenues. The first is through some retrieval model using a keyword or other\nfeature-based search, and the other is where a document can be navigated using\nlinks associated with them, if available.

Extracting metamorphic properties from IRS tax publications is a tedious\nand time-consuming process. As a response, this paper formulates the task of\ngenerating metamorphic specifications as a translation task between properties\nextracted from tax documents - expressed in natural language - to a contrastive\nfirst-order logic form. We perform a systematic analysis on the potential and\nlimitations of in-context learning with Large Language Models(LLMs) for this\ntask, and outline a research agenda towards automating the generation of\nmetamorphic specifications for tax preparation software.",

        "summary": "Despite the remarkable advancements in machine translation, the current\nsentence-level paradigm faces challenges when dealing with highly-contextual\nlanguages like Japanese. In this paper, we explore how context-awareness can\nimprove the performance of the current Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models\nfor English-Japanese business dialogues translation, and what kind of context\nprovides meaningful information to improve translation. As business dialogue\ninvolves complex discourse phenomena but offers scarce training resources, we\nadapted a pretrained mBART model, finetuning on multi-sentence dialogue data,\nwhich allows us to experiment with different contexts. We investigate the\nimpact of larger context sizes and propose novel context tokens encoding\nextra-sentential information, such as speaker turn and scene type. We make use\nof Conditional Cross-Mutual Information (CXMI) to explore how much of the\ncontext the model uses and generalise CXMI to study the impact of the\nextra-sentential context. Overall, we find that models leverage both preceding\nsentences and extra-sentential context (with CXMI increasing with context size)\nand we provide a more focused analysis on honorifics translation. Regarding\ntranslation quality, increased source-side context paired with scene and\nspeaker information improves the model performance compared to previous work\nand our context-agnostic baselines, measured in BLEU and COMET metrics.",

While previous studies have leveraged recent advancements in large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to enhance these descriptors, their outputs often suffer\nfrom ambiguity and inaccuracy.

To address these issues, we propose a novel image\nclassification framework combining VLMs with LLMs, named Iterative Optimization\nwith Visual Feedback. In particular, our method develops an LLM-based agent,\nemploying an evolutionary optimization strategy to refine class descriptors.\nCrucially, we incorporate visual feedback from VLM classification metrics,\nthereby guiding the optimization process with concrete visual data.

        "summary": "Matrix factorization (MF) is a simple collaborative filtering technique that\nachieves superior recommendation accuracy by decomposing the user-item rating\nmatrix into user and item latent matrices. This approach relies on learning\nfrom user-item interactions, which may not effectively capture the underlying\nshared dependencies between users or items. Therefore, there is scope to\nexplicitly capture shared dependencies to further improve recommendation\naccuracy and the interpretability of learning results by summarizing user-item\ninteractions. Based on these insights, we propose \"Hierarchical Matrix\nFactorization\" (HMF), which incorporates clustering concepts to capture the\nhierarchy, where leaf nodes and other nodes correspond to users/items and\nclusters, respectively. Central to our approach, called hierarchical\nembeddings, is the additional decomposition of the user and item latent\nmatrices (embeddings) into probabilistic connection matrices, which link the\nhierarchy, and a root cluster latent matrix. Thus, each node is represented by\nthe weighted average of the embeddings of its parent clusters. The embeddings\nare differentiable, allowing simultaneous learning of interactions and\nclustering using a single gradient descent method. Furthermore, the obtained\ncluster-specific interactions naturally summarize user-item interactions and\nprovide interpretability. Experimental results on rating and ranking\npredictions demonstrated the competitiveness of HMF over vanilla and\nhierarchical MF methods, especially its robustness in sparse interactions.\nAdditionally, it was confirmed that the clustering integration of HMF has the\npotential for faster learning convergence and mitigation of overfitting\ncompared to MF, and also provides interpretability through a cluster-centered\ncase study.",

At generation, these models\nare used auto-regressively, requiring a forward pass for each generated token,\nand thus reading the full set of parameters from memory. This memory access\nforms the primary bottleneck for generation and it worsens as the model size\nincreases. Moreover, executing a forward pass for multiple tokens in parallel\noften takes nearly the same time as it does for just one token. These two\nobservations lead to the development of speculative sampling, where a second\nsmaller model is used to draft a few tokens, that are then validated or\nrejected using a single forward pass of the large model. Unfortunately, this\nmethod requires two models that share the same tokenizer and thus limits its\nadoption. As an alternative, we propose to use parallel decoding as a way to\ndraft multiple tokens from a single model with no computational cost, nor the\nneed for a second model.

Its employment ranges from sound\nevent detection to text-to-audio generation.

This paper\ninvestigates how we can reduce the complexity of contrastive language-audio\npre-trained models, yielding an efficient model that we call tinyCLAP. We\nderive an unimodal distillation loss from first principles and explore how the\ndimensionality of the shared, multimodal latent space can be reduced via\npruning. TinyCLAP uses only 6% of the original Microsoft CLAP parameters with a\nminimal reduction (less than 5%) in zero-shot classification performance across\nthe three sound event detection datasets on which it was tested",

Recently, representation-based retrievers have gained much\nattention, which learns query representation and document representation\nseparately, making it possible to pre-compute document representations offline\nand reduce the workload at query time. Both dense and sparse\nrepresentation-based retrievers have been explored. However, these methods\nfocus on finding the representation that best represents a text (aka metric\nlearning) and the actual retrieval function that is responsible for similarity\nmatching between query and document is kept at a minimum by using dot product.\nOne drawback is that unlike traditional term-level inverted index, the index\nformed by these embeddings cannot be easily re-used by another retrieval\nmethod. Another drawback is that keeping the interaction at minimum hurts\nretrieval effectiveness. On the contrary, interaction-based retrievers are\nknown for their better retrieval effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel SEgment-based Neural Indexing method, SEINE, which provides a general\nindexing framework that can flexibly support a variety of interaction-based\nneural retrieval methods. We emphasize on a careful decomposition of common\ncomponents in existing neural retrieval methods and propose to use\nsegment-level inverted index to store the atomic query-document interaction\nvalues.

First, we devise a\nmulti-view representation learning framework capable of capturing all the\nuser-bundle, user-item and bundle-item relations, especially better utilizing\nthe bundle-item affiliations to enhance sparse bundles' representations.\nSecond, we innovatively adopt an \"early fusion and late contrast\" design that\nfirst fuses the multi-view representations before performing self-supervised\ncontrastive learning. In comparison to existing approaches, our framework\nreverses the order of fusion and contrast, introducing the following\nadvantages: 1)our framework is capable of modeling both cross-view and ego-view\npreferences, allowing us to achieve enhanced user preference modeling; and 2)\ninstead of requiring quadratic number of cross-view contrastive losses, we only\nrequire two self-supervised contrastive losses, resulting in minimal extra\ncosts.

Although these approaches have demonstrated\npromise, a noteworthy disparity arises between the training objective of LLMs,\nwhich typically centers around next token prediction, and the objective of\nevaluating query-document relevance. To address this gap and fully leverage LLM\npotential in text ranking tasks, we propose a progressive multi-stage training\nstrategy.

Our models can be seen as\na variant of Montague semantics based on a lambda calculus where the primitives\nact on string diagrams rather than logical formulae. As a special case, we show\nhow to translate from the Lambek calculus into Peirce's system beta for\nfirst-order logic. This allows us to give a purely diagrammatic treatment of\nhigher-order and non-linear processes in natural language semantics: adverbs,\nprepositions, negation and quantifiers.

It suffers from the\nlarge-scale $\\mathcal{X}$ because a PG with full vectors is too large to fit\ninto the memory, e.g., a billion-scale $\\mathcal{X}$ in 128 dimensions would\nconsume nearly 600 GB memory. To solve this, Product Quantization (PQ)\nintegrated graph-based ANNS is proposed to reduce the memory usage, using\nsmaller compact codes of quantized vectors in memory instead of the large\noriginal vectors. Existing PQ methods do not consider the important routing\nfeatures of PG, resulting in low-quality quantized vectors that affect the\nANNS's effectiveness. In this paper, we present an end-to-end Routing-guided\nlearned Product Quantization (RPQ) for graph-based ANNS. It consists of (1) a\n\\textit{differentiable quantizer} used to make the standard discrete PQ\ndifferentiable to suit for back-propagation of end-to-end learning, (2) a\n\\textit{sampling-based feature extractor} used to extract neighborhood and\nrouting features of a PG, and (3) a \\textit{multi-feature joint training\nmodule} with two types of feature-aware losses to continuously optimize the\ndifferentiable quantizer. As a result, the inherent features of a PG would be\nembedded into the learned PQ, generating high-quality quantized vectors.\nMoreover, we integrate our RPQ with the state-of-the-art DiskANN and existing\npopular PGs to improve their performance.

One type of popular\nsolution is using detection models to detect components of a table, such as\ncolumns and rows, then applying a rule-based post-processing method to convert\ndetection results into HTML sequences. However, existing detection-based\nstudies often have the following limitations. First, these studies usually pay\nmore attention to improving the detection performance, which does not\nnecessarily lead to better performance regarding cell-level metrics, such as\nTEDS. Second, some solutions over-simplify the problem and can miss some\ncritical information.

These challenges are\nparticularly pronounced due to the rapid change of user search intent, which is\ninfluenced by the occurrence and evolution of breaking news events, such as\nearthquakes, elections, and wars. Previous dense retrieval methods, which\nprimarily focused on static semantic representation, lack the capacity to\ncapture immediate search intent, leading to inferior performance in retrieving\nthe most recent event-related documents in time-sensitive scenarios. To address\nthis issue, this paper expands the query with event information that represents\nreal-time search intent. The Event information is then integrated with the\nquery through a cross-attention mechanism, resulting in a time-context query\nrepresentation. We further enhance the model's capacity for event\nrepresentation through multi-task training. Since publicly available datasets\nsuch as MS-MARCO do not contain any event information on the query side and\nhave few time-sensitive queries, we design an automatic data collection and\nannotation pipeline to address this issue, which includes ModelZoo-based Coarse\nAnnotation and LLM-driven Fine Annotation processes. In addition, we share the\ntraining tricks such as two-stage training and hard negative sampling. Finally,\nwe conduct a set of offline experiments on a million-scale production dataset\nto evaluate our approach and deploy an A/B testing in a real online system to\nverify the performance.

We believe these\nfindings are of relevance to researchers in both academia and industry, and\nhope they can inspire practitioners who need to make similar modelling choices\nin the future.",

While LLMs are mainly designed to process pure texts, there are\nmany real-world scenarios where text data are associated with rich structure\ninformation in the form of graphs (e.g., academic networks, and e-commerce\nnetworks) or scenarios where graph data are paired with rich textual\ninformation (e.g., molecules with descriptions). Besides, although LLMs have\nshown their pure text-based reasoning ability, it is underexplored whether such\nability can be generalized to graph scenarios (i.e., graph-based reasoning). In\nthis paper, we provide a systematic review of scenarios and techniques related\nto large language models on graphs.

First, we train models on the Dyck\nbalanced-parenthesis languages. We simplify these models using tools like\ndimensionality reduction and clustering, and then explicitly test how these\nsimplified proxies match the behavior of the original model on various\nout-of-distribution test sets.

In cases where the original model\ngeneralizes to novel structures or deeper depths, the simplified versions may\nfail, or generalize better. This finding holds even if the simplified\nrepresentations do not directly depend on the training distribution.

Our work shows that the localization --\"grounding\"-- abilities of\nthese models can be further improved by finetuning for self-consistent visual\nexplanations. We propose a strategy for augmenting existing text-image datasets\nwith paraphrases using a large language model, and SelfEQ, a weakly-supervised\nstrategy on visual explanation maps for paraphrases that encourages\nself-consistency. Specifically, for an input textual phrase, we attempt to\ngenerate a paraphrase and finetune the model so that the phrase and paraphrase\nmap to the same region in the image.

The reasoning capabilities of LLMs enable them to execute\nfunction calls, using user-provided functions to overcome their inherent\nlimitations, such as knowledge cutoffs, poor arithmetic skills, or lack of\naccess to private data. This development has expanded LLMs' scope to include\nmulti-function calling, where LLMs are equipped with a variety of functions and\nselect the proper functions based on the context. Multi-function calling\nabilities of LLMs have catalyzed LLM-based software development, allowing them\nto tackle more complex problems. However, current methods for multi-function\ncalling often require sequential reasoning and acting for each function which\ncan result in high latency, cost, and sometimes inaccurate behavior. To address\nthis, we introduce LLMCompiler, which executes functions in parallel to\nefficiently orchestrate multi-function calling. Drawing from the principles of\nclassical compilers, LLMCompiler streamlines parallel function calling with\nthree components: (i) an LLM Planner, formulating execution strategies and\ndependencies; (ii) a Task Fetching Unit, dispatching function calling tasks;\nand (iii) an Executor, executing these tasks in parallel. LLMCompiler\nautomatically computes an optimized orchestration for the function calls and\ncan be used with open-source models such as LLaMA-2.

For\nexample, consider prompting an LM to write code that counts the number of times\nit detects sarcasm in an essay: the LM may struggle to write an implementation\nfor \"detect_sarcasm(string)\" that can be executed by the interpreter (handling\nthe edge cases would be insurmountable).

First, learned watermarks could be\nused to build open models that naturally generate watermarked text, allowing\nfor open models to benefit from watermarking. Second, if watermarking is used\nto determine the provenance of generated text, an adversary can hurt the\nreputation of a victim model by spoofing its watermark and generating damaging\nwatermarked text. To investigate the learnability of watermarks, we propose\nwatermark distillation, which trains a student model to behave like a teacher\nmodel that uses decoding-based watermarking.

In this paper,\nwe propose to debias sequential recommenders through Distributionally Robust\nOptimization (DRO) over system exposure data. The key idea is to utilize DRO to\noptimize the worst-case error over an uncertainty set to safeguard the model\nagainst distributional discrepancy caused by the exposure bias. The main\nchallenge to apply DRO for exposure debiasing in SR lies in how to construct\nthe uncertainty set and avoid the overestimation of user preference on biased\nsamples. Moreover, how to evaluate the debiasing effect on biased test set is\nalso an open question. To this end, we first introduce an exposure simulator\ntrained upon the system exposure data to calculate the exposure distribution,\nwhich is then regarded as the nominal distribution to construct the uncertainty\nset of DRO. Then, we introduce a penalty to items with high exposure\nprobability to avoid the overestimation of user preference for biased samples.\nFinally, we design a debiased self-normalized inverse propensity score (SNIPS)\nevaluator for evaluating the debiasing effect on the biased offline test set.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets to verify the\neffectiveness of the proposed methods. Experimental results demonstrate the\nsuperior exposure debiasing performance of proposed methods. Codes and data are\navailable at \\url{https://github.com/nancheng58/DebiasedSR_DRO}.",

        "summary": "Data annotated by humans is a source of knowledge by describing the\npeculiarities of the problem and therefore fueling the decision process of the\ntrained model. Unfortunately, the annotation process for subjective natural\nlanguage processing (NLP) problems like offensiveness or emotion detection is\noften very expensive and time-consuming. One of the inevitable risks is to\nspend some of the funds and annotator effort on annotations that do not provide\nany additional knowledge about the specific task. To minimize these costs, we\npropose a new model-based approach that allows the selection of tasks annotated\nindividually for each text in a multi-task scenario. The experiments carried\nout on three datasets, dozens of NLP tasks, and thousands of annotations show\nthat our method allows up to 40% reduction in the number of annotations with\nnegligible loss of knowledge. The results also emphasize the need to collect a\ndiverse amount of data required to efficiently train a model, depending on the\nsubjectivity of the annotation task. We also focused on measuring the relation\nbetween subjective tasks by evaluating the model in single-task and multi-task\nscenarios. Moreover, for some datasets, training only on the labels predicted\nby our model improved the efficiency of task selection as a self-supervised\nlearning regularization technique.",

However,\nmany focus on a single behavior, overlooking valuable implicit interactions\nlike clicks and favorites. Existing multi-behavioral models often fail to\nsimultaneously capture sequential patterns. We propose CASM, a Context-Aware\nSequential Model, leveraging sequential models to seamlessly handle multiple\nbehaviors. CASM employs context-aware multi-head self-attention for\nheterogeneous historical interactions and a weighted binary cross-entropy loss\nfor precise control over behavior contributions.

        "summary": "Sequential recommendation aims to infer user preferences from historical\ninteraction sequences and predict the next item that users may be interested in\nthe future. The current mainstream design approach is to represent items as\nfixed vectors, capturing the underlying relationships between items and user\npreferences based on the order of interactions. However, relying on a single\nfixed-item embedding may weaken the modeling capability of the system, and the\nglobal dynamics and local saliency exhibited by user preferences need to be\ndistinguished. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel diffusion\nrecommendation algorithm based on multi-scale cnn and residual lstm (AREAL). We\nintroduce diffusion models into the recommend system, representing items as\nprobability distributions instead of fixed vectors. This approach enables\nadaptive reflection of multiple aspects of the items and generates item\ndistributions in a denoising manner. We use multi-scale cnn and residual lstm\nmethods to extract the local and global dependency features of user history\ninteractions, and use attention mechanism to distinguish weights as the guide\nfeatures of reverse diffusion recovery. The effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod is validated through experiments conducted on two real-world datasets.\nSpecifically, AREAL obtains improvements over the best baselines by 2.63% and\n4.25% in terms of HR@20 and 5.05% and 3.94% in terms of NDCG@20 on all\ndatasets.",

        "summary": "Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is a crucial task in online\nrecommendation platforms as it involves estimating the probability of user\nengagement with advertisements or items by clicking on them. Given the\navailability of various services like online shopping, ride-sharing, food\ndelivery, and professional services on commercial platforms, recommendation\nsystems in these platforms are required to make CTR predictions across multiple\ndomains rather than just a single domain. However, multi-domain click-through\nrate (MDCTR) prediction remains a challenging task in online recommendation due\nto the complex mutual influence between domains. Traditional MDCTR models\ntypically encode domains as discrete identifiers, ignoring rich semantic\ninformation underlying. Consequently, they can hardly generalize to new\ndomains. Besides, existing models can be easily dominated by some specific\ndomains, which results in significant performance drops in the other domains\n(\\ie the ``seesaw phenomenon``). In this paper, we propose a novel solution\nUni-CTR to address the above challenges. Uni-CTR leverages a backbone Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) to learn layer-wise semantic representations that capture\ncommonalities between domains. Uni-CTR also uses several domain-specific\nnetworks to capture the characteristics of each domain. Note that we design a\nmasked loss strategy so that these domain-specific networks are decoupled from\nbackbone LLM. This allows domain-specific networks to remain unchanged when\nincorporating new or removing domains, thereby enhancing the flexibility and\nscalability of the system significantly. Experimental results on three public\ndatasets show that Uni-CTR outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) MDCTR models\nsignificantly.

Among various losses, we find\nSoftmax loss (SL) stands out for not only achieving remarkable accuracy but\nalso better robustness and fairness. Nevertheless, the current literature lacks\na comprehensive explanation for the efficacy of SL. Toward addressing this\nresearch gap, we conduct theoretical analyses on SL and uncover three insights:\n1) Optimizing SL is equivalent to performing Distributionally Robust\nOptimization (DRO) on the negative data, thereby learning against perturbations\non the negative distribution and yielding robustness to noisy negatives. 2)\nComparing with other loss functions, SL implicitly penalizes the prediction\nvariance, resulting in a smaller gap between predicted values and and thus\nproducing fairer results. Building on these insights, we further propose a\nnovel loss function Bilateral SoftMax Loss (BSL) that extends the advantage of\nSL to both positive and negative sides. BSL augments SL by applying the same\nLog-Expectation-Exp structure to positive examples as is used for negatives,\nmaking the model robust to the noisy positives as well. Remarkably, BSL is\nsimple and easy-to-implement -- requiring just one additional line of code\ncompared to SL.

To address this, Alipay has developed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG) system that grounds LLMs on the most accurate and up-to-date information.\nHowever, for a real-world product serving millions of users, the inference\nspeed of LLMs becomes a critical factor compared to a mere experimental model.\n  Hence, this paper presents a generic framework for accelerating the inference\nprocess, resulting in a substantial increase in speed and cost reduction for\nour RAG system, with lossless generation accuracy. In the traditional inference\nprocess, each token is generated sequentially by the LLM, leading to a time\nconsumption proportional to the number of generated tokens. To enhance this\nprocess, our framework, named \\textit{lookahead}, introduces a\n\\textit{multi-branch} strategy. Instead of generating a single token at a time,\nwe propose a \\textit{Trie-based Retrieval} (TR) process that enables the\ngeneration of multiple branches simultaneously, each of which is a sequence of\ntokens. Subsequently, for each branch, a \\textit{Verification and Accept} (VA)\nprocess is performed to identify the longest correct sub-sequence as the final\noutput.

We extend the approaches that focus on learning visual\nconcept hierarchies by enabling them to learn novel concepts and solve unseen\nrobotics tasks with them.

Recent studies have explored the low-rank weight factorization\ntechniques which are efficient to train, and apply out-of-the-box to any\ntransformer architecture. Unfortunately, the low-rank assumption tends to be\nover-restrictive and hinders the expressiveness of the compressed model. This\npaper proposes, DSFormer, a simple alternative factorization scheme which\nexpresses a target weight matrix as the product of a small dense and a\nsemi-structured sparse matrix. The resulting approximation is more faithful to\nthe weight distribution in transformers and therefore achieves a stronger\nefficiency-accuracy trade-off. Another concern with existing factorizers is\ntheir dependence on a task-unaware initialization step which degrades the\naccuracy of the resulting model. DSFormer addresses this issue through a novel\nStraight-Through Factorizer (STF) algorithm that jointly learns all the weight\nfactorizations to directly maximize the final task accuracy. Extensive\nexperiments on multiple natural language understanding benchmarks demonstrate\nthat DSFormer obtains up to 40% better compression than the state-of-the-art\nlow-rank factorizers, leading semi-structured sparsity baselines and popular\nknowledge distillation approaches. Our approach is also orthogonal to\nmainstream compressors and offers up to 50% additional compression when added\nto popular distilled, layer-shared and quantized transformers.

SPC is an encoder-only\nprobabilistic coding technology with a structured regularization from the\ntarget label space. By extracting compact and informative representations from\ninput related to the target task, SPC can enhance the generalization ability of\npre-trained language models for better language understanding. Specifically,\nthe hidden representation is encoded into a Gaussian distribution space, while\nmaximizing the prior entropy of latent representations concerning label space.\nThis technique can simultaneously perform information encoding and task\nprediction in one module to more fully utilize the effective information from\ninput data, and use variational inference in the output space to reduce\nrandomness and uncertainty. To better control the probability distribution in\nthe latent space, a structured regularization is proposed to promote\nclass-level uniformity in the latent space. With the regularization term, SPC\ncan preserve the Gaussian distribution structure of latent code as well as\nbetter cover the hidden space with class uniformly.

On the one hand, these approaches cannot achieve satisfying\nunlearning effects due to the collaborative correlations and sequential\nconnections between the unlearning item and the remaining items in the session.\nOn the other hand, seldom work has conducted the research to verify the\nunlearning effectiveness in the session-based recommendation scenario. In this\npaper, we propose SRU, a session-based recommendation unlearning framework,\nwhich enables high unlearning efficiency, accurate recommendation performance,\nand improved unlearning effectiveness in session-based recommendation.\nSpecifically, we first partition the training sessions into separate sub-models\naccording to the similarity across the sessions, then we utilize an\nattention-based aggregation layer to fuse the hidden states according to the\ncorrelations between the session and the centroid of the data in the sub-model.\nTo improve the unlearning effectiveness, we further propose three extra data\ndeletion strategies, including collaborative extra deletion (CED), neighbor\nextra deletion (NED), and random extra deletion (RED). Besides, we propose an\nevaluation metric that measures whether the unlearning sample can be inferred\nafter the data deletion to verify the unlearning effectiveness. We implement\nSRU with three representative session-based recommendation models and conduct\nexperiments on three benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our methods.",

In pursuit\nof enhanced performance, many methods focus on learning robust and independent\nrepresentations by disentangling the intricate factors within interaction data\nacross various modalities in an unsupervised manner. However, such an approach\nobfuscates the discernment of how specific factors (e.g., category or brand)\ninfluence the outcomes, making it challenging to regulate their effects. In\nresponse to this challenge, we introduce a novel method called Attribute-Driven\nDisentangled Representation Learning (short for AD-DRL), which explicitly\nincorporates attributes from different modalities into the disentangled\nrepresentation learning process. By assigning a specific attribute to each\nfactor in multimodal features, AD-DRL can disentangle the factors at both\nattribute and attribute-value levels. To obtain robust and independent\nrepresentations for each factor associated with a specific attribute, we first\ndisentangle the representations of features both within and across different\nmodalities. Moreover, we further enhance the robustness of the representations\nby fusing the multimodal features of the same factor. Empirical evaluations\nconducted on three public real-world datasets substantiate the effectiveness of\nAD-DRL, as well as its interpretability and controllability.",

Online neural network ranking--so called\nfast neural ranking--is considered challenging because neural network measures\nare usually non-convex and asymmetric. Traditional Approximate Nearest Neighbor\n(ANN) search which usually focuses on metric ranking measures, is not\napplicable to these advanced measures.\n  In this paper, we introduce a novel graph searching framework to accelerate\nthe searching in the fast neural ranking problem. The proposed graph searching\nalgorithm is bi-level: we first construct a probable candidate set; then we\nonly evaluate the neural network measure over the probable candidate set\ninstead of evaluating the neural network over all neighbors. Specifically, we\npropose a gradient-based algorithm that approximates the rank of the neural\nnetwork matching score to construct the probable candidate set; and we present\nan angle-based heuristic procedure to adaptively identify the proper size of\nthe probable candidate set. Empirical results on public data confirm the\neffectiveness of our proposed algorithms.",

        "pub_date": "2023-12-28",
        "summary": "Ranker and retriever are two important components in dense passage retrieval.\nThe retriever typically adopts a dual-encoder model, where queries and\ndocuments are separately input into two pre-trained models, and the vectors\ngenerated by the models are used for similarity calculation. The ranker often\nuses a cross-encoder model, where the concatenated query-document pairs are\ninput into a pre-trained model to obtain word similarities. However, the\ndual-encoder model lacks interaction between queries and documents due to its\nindependent encoding, while the cross-encoder model requires substantial\ncomputational cost for attention calculation, making it difficult to obtain\nreal-time retrieval results. In this paper, we propose a dense retrieval model\ncalled MD2PR based on multi-level distillation. In this model, we distill the\nknowledge learned from the cross-encoder to the dual-encoder at both the\nsentence level and word level. Sentence-level distillation enhances the\ndual-encoder on capturing the themes and emotions of sentences. Word-level\ndistillation improves the dual-encoder in analysis of word semantics and\nrelationships. As a result, the dual-encoder can be used independently for\nsubsequent encoding and retrieval, avoiding the significant computational cost\nassociated with the participation of the cross-encoder. Furthermore, we propose\na simple dynamic filtering method, which updates the threshold during multiple\ntraining iterations to ensure the effective identification of false negatives\nand thus obtains a more comprehensive semantic representation space. The\nexperimental results over two standard datasets show our MD2PR outperforms 11\nbaseline models in terms of MRR and Recall metrics.",

Plentiful demonstrations of\nthese styles are available, and as a result modern language models are often\nable to emulate them, either via prompting or discriminative control. However,\nin applications such as writing assistants, it is desirable for language models\nto produce text in an author-specific style on the basis of a small writing\nsample. We find that instruction-tuned language models can struggle to\nreproduce author-specific style demonstrated in a prompt. Instead, we propose\nto guide a language model to generate text in a target style using\ncontrastively-trained representations that capture stylometric features. A\ncentral challenge in doing so is that an author's writing is characterized by\nsurprising token choices under a generic language model. To reconcile this\ntension, we combine generative re-scoring to achieve an author-specific model,\nwith discriminative control to ensure style consistency at the sequence-level.\nThe combination of these approaches is found to be particularly effective at\nadhering to an author-specific style in a variety of conditions, including\nunconditional generation and style transfer, and is applicable to any\nunderlying language model without requiring fine-tuning.",

        "summary": "Harnessing the power of human-annotated data through Supervised Fine-Tuning\n(SFT) is pivotal for advancing Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we\ndelve into the prospect of growing a strong LLM out of a weak one without the\nneed for acquiring additional human-annotated data. We propose a new\nfine-tuning method called Self-Play fIne-tuNing (SPIN), which starts from a\nsupervised fine-tuned model. At the heart of SPIN lies a self-play mechanism,\nwhere the LLM refines its capability by playing against instances of itself.\nMore specifically, the LLM generates its own training data from its previous\niterations, refining its policy by discerning these self-generated responses\nfrom those obtained from human-annotated data. Our method progressively\nelevates the LLM from a nascent model to a formidable one, unlocking the full\npotential of human-annotated demonstration data for SFT. Theoretically, we\nprove that the global optimum to the training objective function of our method\nis achieved only when the LLM policy aligns with the target data distribution.\nEmpirically, we evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets including the\nHuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard, MT-Bench, and datasets from Big-Bench. Our\nresults show that SPIN can significantly improve the LLM's performance across a\nvariety of benchmarks and even outperform models trained through direct\npreference optimization (DPO) supplemented with extra GPT-4 preference data.\nThis sheds light on the promise of self-play, enabling the achievement of\nhuman-level performance in LLMs without the need for expert opponents.",

This issue of\nhallucination is arguably the biggest hindrance to safely deploying these\npowerful LLMs into real-world production systems that impact people's lives.\nThe journey toward widespread adoption of LLMs in practical settings heavily\nrelies on addressing and mitigating hallucinations. Unlike traditional AI\nsystems focused on limited tasks, LLMs have been exposed to vast amounts of\nonline text data during training. While this allows them to display impressive\nlanguage fluency, it also means they are capable of extrapolating information\nfrom the biases in training data, misinterpreting ambiguous prompts, or\nmodifying the information to align superficially with the input. This becomes\nhugely alarming when we rely on language generation capabilities for sensitive\napplications, such as summarizing medical records, financial analysis reports,\netc. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of over 32 techniques developed\nto mitigate hallucination in LLMs. Notable among these are Retrieval Augmented\nGeneration (Lewis et al, 2021), Knowledge Retrieval (Varshney et al,2023),\nCoNLI (Lei et al, 2023), and CoVe (Dhuliawala et al, 2023).

        "summary": "With the development of social media, rumors have been spread broadly on\nsocial media platforms, causing great harm to society. Beside textual\ninformation, many rumors also use manipulated images or conceal textual\ninformation within images to deceive people and avoid being detected, making\nmultimodal rumor detection be a critical problem. The majority of multimodal\nrumor detection methods mainly concentrate on extracting features of source\nclaims and their corresponding images, while ignoring the comments of rumors\nand their propagation structures. These comments and structures imply the\nwisdom of crowds and are proved to be crucial to debunk rumors. Moreover, these\nmethods usually only extract visual features in a basic manner, seldom consider\ntampering or textual information in images. Therefore, in this study, we\npropose a novel Vision and Graph Fused Attention Network (VGA) for rumor\ndetection to utilize propagation structures among posts so as to obtain the\ncrowd opinions and further explore visual tampering features, as well as the\ntextual information hidden in images. We conduct extensive experiments on three\ndatasets, demonstrating that VGA can effectively detect multimodal rumors and\noutperform state-of-the-art methods significantly.",

As vector data\ngrows larger, in-memory indexes become extremely expensive because they\nnecessitate substantial expansion of main memory resources. One possible\nsolution is to use disk-based implementation, which stores and searches vector\ndata in high-performance devices like NVMe SSDs. However, HVSS for data\nsegments is still challenging in vector databases, where one machine has\nmultiple segments for system features (like scaling) purposes. In this setting,\neach segment has limited memory and disk space, so HVSS on the data segment\nneeds to balance accuracy, efficiency, and space cost. Existing disk-based\nmethods are sub-optimal because they do not consider all these requirements\ntogether. In this paper, we present Starling, an I/O-efficient disk-resident\ngraph index framework that optimizes data layout and search strategy in the\nsegment.

We delve into the novel challenge of defending MLLMs against such\nattacks. We discovered that images act as a \"foreign language\" that is not\nconsidered during alignment, which can make MLLMs prone to producing harmful\nresponses. Unfortunately, unlike the discrete tokens considered in text-based\nLLMs, the continuous nature of image signals presents significant alignment\nchallenges, which poses difficulty to thoroughly cover the possible scenarios.\nThis vulnerability is exacerbated by the fact that open-source MLLMs are\npredominantly fine-tuned on limited image-text pairs that is much less than the\nextensive text-based pretraining corpus, which makes the MLLMs more prone to\ncatastrophic forgetting of their original abilities during explicit alignment\ntuning. To tackle these challenges, we introduce MLLM-Protector, a\nplug-and-play strategy combining a lightweight harm detector and a response\ndetoxifier. The harm detector's role is to identify potentially harmful outputs\nfrom the MLLM, while the detoxifier corrects these outputs to ensure the\nresponse stipulates to the safety standards.

Currently, different types of CRS offer various\npossibilities for feedback, i.e., natural language feedback, or answering\nclarifying questions. In most cases, a user simulator is employed for training\nas well as evaluating the CRS. Such user simulators typically critique the\ncurrent retrieved items based on knowledge of a single target item. Still,\nevaluating systems in offline settings with simulators suffers from problems,\nsuch as focusing entirely on a single target item (not addressing the\nexploratory nature of a recommender system), and exhibiting extreme patience\n(consistent feedback over a large number of turns). To overcome these\nlimitations, we obtain extra judgements for a selection of alternative items in\ncommon CRS datasets, namely Shoes and Fashion IQ Dresses. Going further, we\npropose improved user simulators that allow simulated users not only to express\ntheir preferences about alternative items to their original target, but also to\nchange their mind and level of patience. In our experiments using the relative\nimage captioning CRS setting and different CRS models, we find that using the\nknowledge of alternatives by the simulator can have a considerable impact on\nthe evaluation of existing CRS models, specifically that the existing\nsingle-target evaluation underestimates their effectiveness, and when simulated\nusers are allowed to instead consider alternatives, the system can rapidly\nrespond to more quickly satisfy the user.",

        "summary": "How can we train models to perform well on hard test data when hard training\ndata is by definition difficult to label correctly? This question has been\ntermed the scalable oversight problem and has drawn increasing attention as\nlanguage models have continually improved. In this paper, we present the\nsurprising conclusion that current language models often generalize relatively\nwell from easy to hard data, even performing as well as \"oracle\" models trained\non hard data. We demonstrate this kind of easy-to-hard generalization using\nsimple training methods like in-context learning, linear classifier heads, and\nQLoRA for seven different measures of datapoint hardness, including six\nempirically diverse human hardness measures (like grade level) and one\nmodel-based measure (loss-based). Furthermore, we show that even if one cares\nmost about model performance on hard data, it can be better to collect and\ntrain on easy data rather than hard data, since hard data is generally noisier\nand costlier to collect. Our experiments use open models up to 70b in size and\nfour publicly available question-answering datasets with questions ranging in\ndifficulty from 3rd grade science questions to college level STEM questions and\ngeneral-knowledge trivia. We conclude that easy-to-hard generalization in LMs\nis surprisingly strong for the tasks studied, suggesting the scalable oversight\nproblem may be easier than previously thought.

        "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06742v1",
        "pub_date": "2024-01-12",
        "summary": "While valuable datasets such as PersonaChat provide a foundation for training\npersona-grounded dialogue agents, they lack diversity in conversational and\nnarrative settings, primarily existing in the \"real\" world. To develop dialogue\nagents with unique personas, models are trained to converse given a specific\npersona, but hand-crafting these persona can be time-consuming, thus methods\nexist to automatically extract persona information from existing\ncharacter-specific dialogue. However, these persona-extraction models are also\ntrained on datasets derived from PersonaChat and struggle to provide\nhigh-quality persona information from conversational settings that do not take\nplace in the real world, such as the fantasy-focused dataset, LIGHT. Creating\nnew data to train models on a specific setting is human-intensive, thus\nprohibitively expensive. To address both these issues, we introduce a natural\nlanguage inference method for post-hoc adapting a trained persona extraction\nmodel to a new setting. We draw inspiration from the literature of dialog\nnatural language inference (NLI), and devise NLI-reranking methods to extract\nstructured persona information from dialogue. Compared to existing persona\nextraction models, our method returns higher-quality extracted persona and\nrequires less human annotation.",

        "pub_date": "2024-01-12",
        "summary": "As natural language becomes the default interface for human-AI interaction,\nthere is a critical need for LMs to appropriately communicate uncertainties in\ndownstream applications. In this work, we investigate how LMs incorporate\nconfidence about their responses via natural language and how downstream users\nbehave in response to LM-articulated uncertainties. We examine publicly\ndeployed models and find that LMs are unable to express uncertainties when\nanswering questions even when they produce incorrect responses. LMs can be\nexplicitly prompted to express confidences, but tend to be overconfident,\nresulting in high error rates (on average 47%) among confident responses. We\ntest the risks of LM overconfidence by running human experiments and show that\nusers rely heavily on LM generations, whether or not they are marked by\ncertainty. Lastly, we investigate the preference-annotated datasets used in\nRLHF alignment and find that humans have a bias against texts with uncertainty.\nOur work highlights a new set of safety harms facing human-LM interactions and\nproposes design recommendations and mitigating strategies moving forward.",

        "pub_date": "2024-01-12",
        "summary": "Statutory reasoning refers to the application of legislative provisions to a\nseries of case facts described in natural language. We re-frame statutory\nreasoning as an analogy task, where each instance of the analogy task involves\na combination of two instances of statutory reasoning. This increases the\ndataset size by two orders of magnitude, and introduces an element of\ninterpretability. We show that this task is roughly as difficult to Natural\nLanguage Processing models as the original task. Finally, we come back to\nstatutory reasoning, solving it with a combination of a retrieval mechanism and\nanalogy models, and showing some progress on prior comparable work.",

        "pub_date": "2024-01-12",
        "summary": "The advent of instruction-tuned language models that convincingly mimic human\nwriting poses a significant risk of abuse. For example, such models could be\nused for plagiarism, disinformation, spam, or phishing. However, such abuse may\nbe counteracted with the ability to detect whether a piece of text was composed\nby a language model rather than a human. Some previous approaches to this\nproblem have relied on supervised methods trained on corpora of confirmed human\nand machine-written documents. Unfortunately, model under-specification poses\nan unavoidable challenge for neural network-based detectors, making them\nbrittle in the face of data shifts, such as the release of further language\nmodels producing still more fluent text than the models used to train the\ndetectors. Other previous approaches require access to the models that may have\ngenerated a document in question at inference or detection time, which is often\nimpractical. In light of these challenges, we pursue a fundamentally different\napproach not relying on samples from language models of concern at training\ntime. Instead, we propose to leverage representations of writing style\nestimated from human-authored text. Indeed, we find that features effective at\ndistinguishing among human authors are also effective at distinguishing human\nfrom machine authors, including state of the art large language models like\nLlama 2, ChatGPT, and GPT-4. Furthermore, given a handful of examples composed\nby each of several specific language models of interest, our approach affords\nthe ability to predict which model generated a given document.",
