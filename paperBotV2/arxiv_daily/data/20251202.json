    "ori_summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating coherent text within a single prompt but fall short in sustaining relevance, personalization, and continuity across extended interactions. Human communication, however, relies on multiple forms of memory, from recalling past conversations to adapting to personal traits and situational context. This paper introduces the Mixed Memory-Augmented Generation (MMAG) pattern, a framework that organizes memory for LLM-based agents into five interacting layers: conversational, long-term user, episodic and event-linked, sensory and context-aware, and short-term working memory. Drawing inspiration from cognitive psychology, we map these layers to technical components and outline strategies for coordination, prioritization, and conflict resolution. We demonstrate the approach through its implementation in the Heero conversational agent, where encrypted long-term bios and conversational history already improve engagement and retention. We further discuss implementation concerns around storage, retrieval, privacy, and latency, and highlight open challenges. MMAG provides a foundation for building memory-rich language agents that are more coherent, proactive, and aligned with human needs.",

    "ori_summary": "Multimodal recommendation aims to integrate collaborative signals with heterogeneous content such as visual and textual information, but remains challenged by modality-specific noise, semantic inconsistency, and unstable propagation over user-item graphs. These issues are often exacerbated by naive fusion or shallow modeling strategies, leading to degraded generalization and poor robustness. While recent work has explored the frequency domain as a lens to separate stable from noisy signals, most methods rely on static filtering or reweighting, lacking the ability to reason over spectral structure or adapt to modality-specific reliability. To address these challenges, we propose a Structured Spectral Reasoning (SSR) framework for frequency-aware multimodal recommendation. Our method follows a four-stage pipeline: (i) Decompose graph-based multimodal signals into spectral bands via graph-guided transformations to isolate semantic granularity; (ii) Modulate band-level reliability with spectral band masking, a training-time masking with a prediction-consistency objective that suppresses brittle frequency components; (iii) Fuse complementary frequency cues using hyperspectral reasoning with low-rank cross-band interaction; and (iv) Align modality-specific spectral features via contrastive regularization to promote semantic and structural consistency. Experiments on three real-world benchmarks show consistent gains over strong baselines, particularly under sparse and cold-start settings. Additional analyses indicate that structured spectral modeling improves robustness and provides clearer diagnostics of how different bands contribute to performance.",

    "ori_summary": "As large language models have grown larger, low-precision numerical formats such as NVFP4 have become increasingly popular due to the speed and memory benefits they provide. However, to accelerate computation with NVFP4, all matrix multiplication operands--weights and activations in the forward pass, and weights, activations, and gradients in the backward pass--must be quantized to NVFP4, often leading to divergence during training and performance degradation during inference. NVFP4 by evaluating multiple potential scale factors for each block of values. To address this issue, in this work we introduce Four Over Six (4/6), a modification to the NVFP4 quantization algorithm that evaluates two potential scale factors for each block of values. Unlike integer formats, floating-point formats such as FP4 have the most quantization error on near-maximal values in each block, which we find to be primarily responsible for downstream performance degradation. We find that for some blocks, scaling to smaller FP4 values makes the distribution of representable values more uniform, improving representation of near-maximal values. Importantly, 4/6 can be implemented efficiently on NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, making it viable to use while training LLMs with NVFP4. In pre-training experiments with transformer and hybrid model architectures, we find that 4/6 prevents divergence in several cases, bringing training loss significantly closer to BF16 compared to models trained with current state-of-the-art NVFP4 training recipes. We also find that 4/6 can be easily incorporated into many different post-training quantization methods and generally improves downstream accuracy. We hope this inspires future work in training and deploying models with NVFP4.",

To address these gaps, we conduct the first large-scale study of TTS, spanning over thirty billion tokens generated using eight open-source LLMs (7B to 235B parameters), across four reasoning datasets. We observe three consistent trends: (1) no single TTS strategy universally dominates; (2) reasoning models exhibit distinct trace-quality patterns across problem difficulty and trace length, forming short-horizon and long-horizon categories; and (3) for a given model type, the optimal TTS performance scales monotonically with compute budget. Based on these insights, we provide a practical recipe for selecting the best TTS strategy, considering problem difficulty, model type, and compute budget, providing a practical guide to effective inference-time scaling.",

While Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) can decompose hidden activations into more fine-grained, interpretable features, they often struggle to reliably align these features with human-defined concepts, resulting in entangled and distributed feature representations. To address this, we introduce AlignSAE, a method that aligns SAE features with a defined ontology through a \"pre-train, then post-train\" curriculum. After an initial unsupervised training phase, we apply supervised post-training to bind specific concepts to dedicated latent slots while preserving the remaining capacity for general reconstruction. This separation creates an interpretable interface where specific relations can be inspected and controlled without interference from unrelated features. Empirical results demonstrate that AlignSAE enables precise causal interventions, such as reliable \"concept swaps\", by targeting single, semantically aligned slots.",

For a subset of top reasoning models, we derive an Elo estimate by playing against a chess engine with variably configured skill, which allows for comparisons between models in an easily understandable way. Despite the simplicity of the instruction-following task and the weakness of the opponent, many state-of-the-art models struggle to complete games or achieve consistent wins. Similar to other benchmarks on complex reasoning tasks, our experiments reveal a clear separation between reasoning and non-reasoning models.

In this work, we investigate this question through the lens of Complementary Reasoning, a complex task that requires integrating internal parametric knowledge with external contextual information. Using a controlled synthetic dataset of human biographies, we strictly decouple this ability into two atomic skills: Parametric Reasoning (relying on internal knowledge) and Contextual Reasoning (depending on external information). To rigorously assess capability boundaries, we evaluate generalization across three distinct levels of difficulty: I.I.D., Composition, and Zero-shot settings. We find that while SFT is sufficient for in-distribution performance, it struggles with O.O.D. generalization, particularly in Zero-shot settings where relational combinations are novel. Crucially, we identify the SFT Generalization Paradox: Models supervised solely on the composite task achieve near-perfect in-distribution accuracy but collapse on out-of-distribution generalization, indicating their reliance on rote memorization of path shortcuts. In contrast, we find that RL acts as a reasoning synthesizer rather than a probability amplifier. However, we uncover a strict atomic prerequisite: RL can only synthesize these complex strategies if the base model has first mastered the independent atomic skills (Parametric and Contextual) via SFT. These findings challenge the view of RL as a mere amplifier, suggesting that given sufficient atomic foundations, RL can actively synthesize complex reasoning strategies from learned primitives without explicit supervision on such complex strategies. This indicates that decoupled atomic training followed by RL offers a scalable path to generalization for complex reasoning tasks.",

While instructions serve as the primary protocol for defining agents, RLVR typically relies on static and manually designed instructions. However, those instructions may be suboptimal for the base model, and the optimal instruction may change as the agent's policy improves and explores the interaction with the environment. To bridge the gap, we introduce INSPO, a novel Instruction-Policy co-evolution framework that integrates instruction optimization as a dynamic component of the reinforcement learning (RL) loop. INSPO maintains a dynamic population of instruction candidates that are sampled with questions, where reward signals in RL loops are automatically attributed to each instruction, and low performers are periodically pruned. New instructions are generated and verified through an on-policy reflection mechanism, where an LLM-based optimizer analyzes past experience from a replay buffer and evolves more effective strategies given the current policy. We conduct extensive experiments on multi-turn retrieval and reasoning tasks, demonstrating that INSPO substantially outperforms strong baselines relying on static instructions. INSPO discovers innovative instructions that guide the agent toward more strategic reasoning paths, achieving substantial performance gains with only a marginal increase in computational overhead.",

    "ori_summary": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have been driven by their emergent reasoning capabilities, particularly through long chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which enables thorough exploration and deliberation. Despite these advances, long-CoT LLMs often exhibit suboptimal reasoning behaviors, such as overthinking and excessively protracted reasoning chains, which can impair performance. In this paper, we analyze reasoning processes through an optimization lens, framing CoT as a gradient descent procedure where each reasoning step constitutes an update toward problem resolution. Building on this perspective, we introduce RePro (Rectifying Process-level Reward), a novel approach to refine LLM reasoning during post-training. RePro defines a surrogate objective function to assess the optimization process underlying CoT, utilizing a dual scoring mechanism to quantify its intensity and stability. These scores are aggregated into a composite process-level reward, seamlessly integrated into reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) pipelines to optimize LLMs. Extensive experiments across multiple reinforcement learning algorithms and diverse LLMs, evaluated on benchmarks spanning mathematics, science, and coding, demonstrate that RePro consistently enhances reasoning performance and mitigates suboptimal reasoning behaviors.",

    "ori_summary": "Understanding the internal thinking process of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the cause of hallucinations remains a key challenge. To this end, we introduce latent debate, a novel framework for interpreting model predictions through the lens of implicit internal arguments. Unlike the current work of self-consistency and multi-agent debate, which relies on explicit debates among multiple answers or multiple models, latent debate captures the hidden supporting and attacking signals that arise within a single model during a single inference. We first present a model- and task-agnostic conceptual framework, and then instantiate it symbolically to approximate the thinking process of LLMs on True/False prediction tasks. Empirical studies demonstrate that latent debate is a faithful structured surrogate model that has highly consistent predictions with the original LLM. Beyond interpretability, we demonstrate that latent debate provides a strong baseline for hallucination detection. Further analysis reveals strong correlations between hallucinations and debate patterns, such as a high degree of latent debates in the middle layers is linked to a higher risk of hallucinations. These findings position latent debate as a potential framework for understanding internal mechanisms of LLMs, especially for scenarios where internal (dis)agreements appear during the inference steps.",

However, this explicit reasoning process also introduces new safety risks, as unsafe behaviors often emerge within intermediate reasoning trajectories, even when final answers appear harmless. Existing safety alignment approaches primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) over safety-oriented long CoT datasets. While intuitive, we find that SFT produces inconsistent safety improvements, degrades reasoning ability, and generalizes poorly across model families. These limitations suggest that purely supervised approaches are insufficient for robust safety alignment in LRMs. To address this, we investigate reinforcement learning (RL) as a complementary optimization framework for LRM safety training. Unlike SFT, RL directly optimizes model policies with reward feedback, enabling more adaptive and stable alignment. Extensive experiments across multiple model families and benchmarks show that RL achieves stronger and more consistent safety gains while maintaining reasoning competence. Further analysis of reflection dynamics and token-level entropy reveals that RL suppresses unsafe exploratory reasoning while preserving reflective depth, leading to safer and more reliable reasoning processes.",

Regarding their identification, we demonstrate that a remarkably sparse subset of neurons (less than $0.1\\%$ of total neurons) can reliably predict hallucination occurrences, with strong generalization across diverse scenarios. In terms of behavioral impact, controlled interventions reveal that these neurons are causally linked to over-compliance behaviors. Concerning their origins, we trace these neurons back to the pre-trained base models and find that these neurons remain predictive for hallucination detection, indicating they emerge during pre-training.

To pioneer in this direction, this paper presents OmiGraph, the first omission-aware framework for misinformation detection. Specifically, OmiGraph constructs an omission-aware graph for the target news by utilizing a contextual environment that captures complementary perspectives of the same event, thereby surfacing potentially omitted contents. Based on this graph, omission-oriented relation modeling is then proposed to identify the internal contextual dependencies, as well as the dynamic omission intents, formulating a comprehensive omission relation representation. Finally, to extract omission patterns for detection, OmiGraph introduces omission-aware message-passing and aggregation that establishes holistic deception perception by integrating the omission contents and relations. Experiments show that, by considering the omission perspective, our approach attains remarkable performance, achieving average improvements of +5.4% F1 and +5.3% ACC on two large-scale benchmarks.",

While prior streaming benchmarks evaluate temporal reasoning, none measure whether MLLMs can interpret or leverage human gaze signals within a streaming setting. To fill this gap, we introduce StreamGaze, the first benchmark designed to evaluate how effectively MLLMs use gaze for temporal and proactive reasoning in streaming videos. StreamGaze introduces gaze-guided past, present, and proactive tasks that comprehensively evaluate streaming video understanding. These tasks assess whether models can use real-time gaze to follow shifting attention and infer user intentions from only past and currently observed frames. To build StreamGaze, we develop a gaze-video QA generation pipeline that aligns egocentric videos with raw gaze trajectories via fixation extraction, region-specific visual prompting, and scanpath construction. This pipeline produces spatio-temporally grounded QA pairs that closely reflect human perceptual dynamics. Across all StreamGaze tasks, we observe substantial performance gaps between state-of-the-art MLLMs and human performance, revealing fundamental limitations in gaze-based temporal reasoning, intention modeling, and proactive prediction. We further provide detailed analyses of gaze-prompting strategies, reasoning behaviors, and task-specific failure modes, offering deeper insight into why current MLLMs struggle and what capabilities future models must develop.

Current models often struggle to distinguish objective unsolvability (inherent contradictions in the problem) from subjective capability limitations (problems beyond the model's competence), which leads to hallucinations and overconfidence. To address this, we propose UnsolvableQA and UnsolvableRL to solve feasible problems, detect inherent contradictions, and prudently refuse tasks beyond capability. Specifically, we construct UnsolvableQA, a dataset of paired solvable and unsolvable instances derived via a dual-track methodology: programmatic generation for logic puzzles and a novel \"Reverse Construction\" method that injects contradictions into valid reasoning chains for mathematics. Building on this dataset, we introduce UnsolvableRL, a reinforcement learning framework with three reward components jointly accounting for accuracy, unsolvability, and difficulty. Empirical results show that our approach achieves near-perfect unsolvability detection while also improving accuracy on solvable tasks. Crucially, we identify Capability Collapse, demonstrating that explicit exposure to unsolvable data is indispensable for preventing models from becoming systematically overconfident.

Our approach produces bounded, interpretable metrics decomposed into \\textit{Entity Grounding} (EG), measuring whether entities in the response appear in source documents, and \\textit{Relation Preservation} (RP), verifying that asserted relationships are supported by context. On structured control documents, HalluGraph achieves near-perfect discrimination ($>$400 words, $>$20 entities), HalluGraph achieves $AUC = 0.979$, while maintaining robust performance ($AUC \\approx 0.89$) on challenging generative legal task, consistently outperforming semantic similarity baselines. The framework provides the transparency and traceability required for high-stakes legal applications, enabling full audit trails from generated assertions back to source passages.",

We evaluate their performance on Yoruba, Kinyarwanda, and Amharic. While these languages are spoken by millions, their online usage on conversational platforms is often sparse, heavily influenced by English, and not representative of the authentic, monolingual conversations prevalent among native speakers. This lack of readily available authentic data online creates a challenge of scarcity of conversational data for training language models. To investigate this, data was collected from subreddits and local news sources for each language. The analysis showed a stark contrast between the two sources. Reddit data was minimal and characterized by heavy code-switching. Conversely, local news media offered a robust source of clean, monolingual language data, which also prompted more user engagement in the local language on the news publishers social media pages. Language detection models, including the specialized AfroLID and a general LLM, performed with near-perfect accuracy on the clean news data but struggled with the code-switched Reddit posts. The study concludes that professionally curated news content is a more reliable and effective source for training context-rich AI models for African languages than data from conversational platforms. It also highlights the need for future models that can process clean and code-switched text to improve the detection accuracy for African languages.",

We address this issue through the lens of false discovery rate (FDR) control, ensuring that among all accepted predictions, the proportion of errors does not exceed a target risk level. To achieve this in a principled way, we propose LEC, which reinterprets selective prediction as a constrained decision problem by enforcing a Linear Expectation Constraint over selection and error indicators. Then, we establish a finite-sample sufficient condition, which relies only on a held-out set of exchangeable calibration samples, to compute an FDR-constrained, coverage-maximizing threshold. Furthermore, we extend LEC to a two-model routing mechanism: given a prompt, if the current model's uncertainty exceeds its calibrated threshold, we delegate it to a stronger model, while maintaining a unified FDR guarantee. Evaluations on closed-ended and open-ended question-answering (QA) datasets show that LEC achieves tighter FDR control and substantially improves sample retention over prior methods. Moreover, the two-model routing mechanism achieves lower risk levels while accepting more correct samples than each individual model.",

LPCD generalizes existing methods and provides a principled approach to quantizing complex submodules while maintaining the efficiency and compatibility of layer-wise PTQ pipelines.

    "ori_summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved great success in Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT) tasks. However, current research is constrained by two key challenges: language coverage and efficiency. Most of the popular S2TT datasets are substantially English-centric, which restricts the scaling-up of MLLMs' many-to-many translation capabilities. Moreover, the inference speed of MLLMs degrades dramatically when the speech is converted into long sequences (e.g., 750 tokens). To address these limitations, we propose a Multilingual Cost-effective Accelerated Speech-to-Text Translator (MCAT) framework, which includes two innovations. First, a language scaling method that leverages curriculum learning and a data balancing strategy is introduced to extend the language coverage supported by MLLMs to 70 languages and achieve mutual translation among these languages. Second, an optimized speech adapter module is designed to reduce the length of the speech sequence to only 30 tokens. Extensive experiments were conducted on MLLMs of different scales (9B and 27B). The experimental results demonstrate that MCAT not only surpasses state-of-the-art end-to-end models on the FLEURS dataset across 70x69 directions but also enhances batch inference efficiency. This is achieved with only ~100M trainable parameters and by using only 10 hours of S2TT data per language. Furthermore, we have released MCAT as open-source to promote the development of MLLMs for robust S2TT capabilities. The code and models are released at https://github.com/yxduir/m2m-70.",

We connect the AL to data clustering and propose an integrated fine-tuning pipeline that systematically combines AL, clustering, and dynamic data selection schedulers to enhance model's performance.

Humans use real-time introspection to decide how much effort to invest, when to make multiple attempts, when to stop, and when to signal success or failure. Without this, LLMs struggle to make intelligent meta-cognition decisions. Test-time scaling methods like Best-of-N drive up cost and latency by using a fixed budget of samples regardless of the marginal benefit of each one at any point in generation, and the absence of confidence signals can mislead people, prevent appropriate escalation to better tools, and undermine trustworthiness. Learned verifiers or reward models can provide confidence estimates, but do not enable adaptive inference and add substantial cost by requiring extra models or forward passes. We present ZIP-RC, an adaptive inference method that equips models with zero-overhead inference-time predictions of reward and cost. At every token, ZIP-RC reuses reserved or unused logits in the same forward pass as next-token prediction to output a joint distribution over final reward and remaining length -- no extra models, architecture change, or inference overhead. This full joint distribution is used to compute a sampling utility which is the linear combination of the expected maximum reward, total compute, and latency of set of samples if generated to completion. During inference, we maximize this utility with meta-actions that determine which prefix of tokens to continue or initiate sampling from. On mixed-difficulty mathematical benchmarks, ZIP-RC improves accuracy by up to 12% over majority voting at equal or lower average cost, and traces smooth Pareto frontiers between quality, compute, and latency. By providing real-time reward-cost introspection, ZIP-RC enables adaptive, efficient reasoning.",

In practice, systems access LLMs via commercial APIs or open-source deployments, and the model landscape (e.g., GPT, Claude, Llama) evolves rapidly. This rapid evolution forces frequent model switches driven by capability, cost, deployment constraints, and privacy. Yet prompts are highly model-sensitive: reusing a prompt engineered for one model on another often yields substantially worse performance than a prompt optimized for the target model. We term this phenomenon Model Drifting. Through extensive empirical analysis across diverse LLM configurations, we show that model drifting is both common and severe. To address this challenge, we introduce PromptBridge, a training-free framework that preserves prompt effectiveness under model switches, enabling cross-model prompt transfer without costly per-task or per-model re-optimization. PromptBridge requires only a small set of alignment tasks for calibration. It first applies Model-Adaptive Reflective Prompt Evolution (MAP-RPE) to obtain task- and model-specific optimal prompts via iterative reflective refinement and quantitative evaluation. Using the resulting calibrated prompt pairs for the source and target models, PromptBridge learns a cross-model prompt mapping. At test time, i.e., for an unseen task, given a source-model prompt, this mapping directly produces an optimized prompt for the target model. Experiments in single-agent and multi-agent settings show that PromptBridge consistently improves downstream accuracy while reducing migration effort. The code will be available soon.",

    "ori_summary": "Understanding sentiment in complex textual expressions remains a fundamental challenge in affective computing. To address this, we propose a Dynamic Fusion Learning Model (DyFuLM), a multimodal framework designed to capture both hierarchical semantic representations and fine-grained emotional nuances. DyFuLM introduces two key moodules: a Hierarchical Dynamic Fusion module that adaptively integrates multi-level features, and a Gated Feature Aggregation module that regulates cross-layer information ffow to achieve balanced representation learning. Comprehensive experiments on multi-task sentiment datasets demonstrate that DyFuLM achieves 82.64% coarse-grained and 68.48% fine-grained accuracy, yielding the lowest regression errors (MAE = 0.0674, MSE = 0.0082) and the highest R^2 coefficient of determination (R^2= 0.6903). Furthermore, the ablation study validates the effectiveness of each module in DyFuLM. When all modules are removed, the accuracy drops by 0.91% for coarse-grained and 0.68% for fine-grained tasks. Keeping only the gated fusion module causes decreases of 0.75% and 0.55%, while removing the dynamic loss mechanism results in drops of 0.78% and 0.26% for coarse-grained and fine-grained sentiment classification, respectively. These results demonstrate that each module contributes significantly to feature interaction and task balance. Overall, the experimental findings further validate that DyFuLM enhances sentiment representation and overall performance through effective hierarchical feature fusion.",

    "ori_summary": "Many modern software projects evolve rapidly to incorporate new features and security patches. It is important for users to update their dependencies to safer versions, but many still use older, vulnerable package versions because upgrading can be difficult and may break their existing codebase. Software developers can mitigate this problem by backporting security patches to older releases. However, manually backporting is time-consuming and error-prone. The effectiveness of existing automated backporting techniques on general software remains unclear since they typically target only code-hunk or function-level patch porting scenarios and are evaluated with imperfect metrics. To facilitate the development and evaluation of automated backporting techniques, we introduce BackportBench, the first comprehensive benchmark suite for patch backporting problem. BackportBench is a multilingual benchmark that contains 202 patch backporting problems from PyPI, Maven, and npm, each with executable Docker environments and relevant test cases. We evaluated existing patch porting methods and LLM-based techniques that have the potential to adapt to this task using BackportBench. The results show that the agentic method has outperformed traditional patch porting methods, especially on cases that require logical and structural changes. However, the performance varies across different programming languages. Based on the findings, we draw several implications for researchers and software practitioners in future work on automated backporting.",

Specifically, through a first-order approximation, we show that this surrogate becomes increasingly valid only when both the training-inference discrepancy and policy staleness are minimized. This insight provides a principled explanation for the crucial role of several widely adopted techniques in stabilizing RL training, including importance sampling correction, clipping, and particularly Routing Replay for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. Through extensive experiments with a 30B MoE model totaling hundreds of thousands of GPU hours, we show that for on-policy training, the basic policy gradient algorithm with importance sampling correction achieves the highest training stability. When off-policy updates are introduced to accelerate convergence, combining clipping and Routing Replay becomes essential to mitigate the instability caused by policy staleness. Notably, once training is stabilized, prolonged optimization consistently yields comparable final performance regardless of cold-start initialization. We hope that the shared insights and the developed recipes for stable RL training will facilitate future research.",

Prolonged training on such statistically optimal but cognitively impoverished data accelerates model collapse. This paper proposes a paradigm shift: instead of imitating the surface properties of data, we simulate the cognitive processes that generate human text. We introduce the Prompt-driven Cognitive Computing Framework (PMCSF), whose core consists of a Cognitive State Decoder (CSD) that reverse-engineers unstructured text into structured cognitive vectors, and a Cognitive Text Encoder (CTE) that re-materializes these states into text enriched with human-typical imperfections via mathematically defined Cognitive Perturbation Operators. The framework is validated through a two-stage objective evaluation pipeline. First, in cognitive codec verification, CTE text yields a Jensen-Shannon divergence of 0.0614 from human text (vs. 0.4431 for standard LLM output), passes double-blind professional media review, and achieves an intraclass correlation coefficient ICC > 0.9 for cognitive profile alignment across heterogeneous models. Second, in functional gain evaluation, isomorphic stress tests in the A-share market show that strategies incorporating CTE-generated data reduce maximum drawdown by 47.4% during the 2015 crash and deliver 8.6% Defensive Alpha, exceeding transaction costs by a factor of 33. Our findings demonstrate that modelling human cognitive limitations -- not copying surface data -- enables synthetic data with genuine functional gain, offering a viable technical pathway toward resolving the AI data-collapse crisis.",

However, our study unveils a critical, overlooked vulnerability: their profound susceptibility to subtle symbolic perturbations, particularly through near-imperceptible emoticon tokens such as \"(@_@)\" that can catastrophically mislead retrieval, termed EmoRAG. We demonstrate that injecting a single emoticon into a query makes it nearly 100% likely to retrieve semantically unrelated texts that contain a matching emoticon. Our extensive experiment across general question-answering and code domains, using a range of state-of-the-art retrievers and generators, reveals three key findings: (I) Single-Emoticon Disaster: Minimal emoticon injections cause maximal disruptions, with a single emoticon almost 100% dominating RAG output. (II) Positional Sensitivity: Placing an emoticon at the beginning of a query can cause severe perturbation, with F1-Scores exceeding 0.92 across all datasets. (III) Parameter-Scale Vulnerability: Counterintuitively, models with larger parameters exhibit greater vulnerability to the interference. We provide an in-depth analysis to uncover the underlying mechanisms of these phenomena. Furthermore, we raise a critical concern regarding the robustness assumption of current RAG systems, envisioning a threat scenario where an adversary exploits this vulnerability to manipulate the RAG system. We evaluate standard defenses and find them insufficient against EmoRAG. To address this, we propose targeted defenses, analyzing their strengths and limitations in mitigating emoticon-based perturbations. Finally, we outline future directions for building robust RAG systems.",

These attacks leverage the model's instruction-following ability to make it perform malicious tasks. Recent work has proposed JATMO, a task-specific fine-tuning approach that trains non-instruction-tuned base models to perform a single function, thereby reducing susceptibility to adversarial instructions. In this study, we evaluate the robustness of JATMO against HOUYI, a genetic attack framework that systematically mutates and optimizes adversarial prompts. We adapt HOUYI by introducing custom fitness scoring, modified mutation logic, and a new harness for local model testing, enabling a more accurate assessment of defense effectiveness. We fine-tuned LLaMA 2-7B, Qwen1.5-4B, and Qwen1.5-0.5B models under the JATMO methodology and compared them with a fine-tuned GPT-3.5-Turbo baseline. Results show that while JATMO reduces attack success rates relative to instruction-tuned models, it does not fully prevent injections; adversaries exploiting multilingual cues or code-related disruptors still bypass defenses. We also observe a trade-off between generation quality and injection vulnerability, suggesting that better task performance often correlates with increased susceptibility. Our results highlight both the promise and limitations of fine-tuning-based defenses and point toward the need for layered, adversarially informed mitigation strategies.",

Nevertheless, it degrades the translation quality as the number of utility function calls is reduced.

However, existing systems face two limitations: (1) reliance on situation-centric datasets lacking persistent user identity, which hampers the capture of personalized affective nuances; and (2) dependence on opaque, coarse reward signals that hinder development of verifiable empathetic reasoning. To address these gaps, we introduce KardiaBench, a large-scale user-grounded benchmark comprising 178,080 QA pairs across 22,080 multi-turn conversations anchored to 671 real-world profiles.

Kardia-R1 leverages Rubric-as-Judge Empathetic Reinforcement Learning (Rubric-ERL), a GRPO-based method that uses explainable, human-aligned rubric rewards to tightly couple user understanding, emotional inference, and supportive response generation.

However, the actual capability of LLMs in JavaScript vulnerability detection remains questionable, necessitating systematic evaluation and comprehensive benchmarks. Unfortunately, existing benchmarks suffer from three critical limitations: (1) incomplete coverage, such as covering a limited subset of CWE types; (2) underestimation of LLM capabilities caused by unreasonable ground truth labeling; and (3) overestimation due to unrealistic cases such as using isolated vulnerable files rather than complete projects. In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, three principles for constructing a benchmark for JavaScript vulnerability detection that directly address these limitations: (1) comprehensiveness, (2) no underestimation, and (3) no overestimation. Guided by these principles, we propose FORGEJS, the first automatic benchmark generation framework for evaluating LLMs' capability in JavaScript vulnerability detection. Then, we use FORGEJS to construct ARENAJS-the first systematic benchmark for LLM-based JavaScript vulnerability detection-and further propose JUDGEJS, an automatic evaluation framework. We conduct the first systematic evaluation of LLMs for JavaScript vulnerability detection, leveraging JUDGEJS to assess seven popular commercial LLMs on ARENAJS. The results show that LLMs not only exhibit limited reasoning capabilities, but also suffer from severe robustness defects, indicating that reliable JavaScript vulnerability detection with LLMs remains an open challenge.",

    "ori_summary": "We study abstract visual composition, in which identity is primarily determined by the spatial configuration and relations among a small set of geometric primitives (e.g., parts, symmetry, topology). They are invariant primarily to texture and photorealistic detail. Composing such structures from fixed components under geometric constraints and vague goal specification (such as text) is non-trivial due to combinatorial placement choices, limited data, and discrete feasibility (overlap-free, allowable orientations), which create a sparse solution manifold ill-suited to purely statistical pixel-space generators. We propose a constraint-guided framework that combines explicit geometric reasoning with neural semantics. An AlphaGo-style search enforces feasibility, while a fine-tuned vision-language model scores semantic alignment as reward signals. Our algorithm uses a policy network as a heuristic in Monte-Carlo Tree Search and fine-tunes the network via search-generated plans. Inspired by the Generative Adversarial Network, we use the generated instances for adversarial reward refinement. Over time, the generation should approach the actual data more closely when the reward model cannot distinguish between generated instances and ground-truth. In the Tangram Assembly task, our approach yields higher validity and semantic fidelity than diffusion and auto-regressive baselines, especially as constraints tighten.",

    "ori_summary": "Standard Transformers suffer from a \"Semantic Alignment Tax\", a prohibitive optimization cost required to organize a chaotic initialization into a coherent geometric map via local gradient diffusion. We hypothesize that this reliance on diffusive learning creates \"Catastrophic Rigidity\", rendering models unable to adapt to novel concepts without destroying their pre-trained reasoning capabilities. To isolate this phenomenon, we introduce Iterative Semantic Map Refinement (ISMR), a diagnostic protocol revealing that alignment is a fixed geometric barrier that scaling cannot solve; a 20-layer model overcomes this barrier no faster than a 1-layer model. We introduce the Phase-Resonant Intelligent Spectral Model (PRISM). PRISM encodes semantic identity as resonant frequencies in the complex domain (C^d) and replaces quadratic self-attention with linearithmic O(N log N) Gated Harmonic Convolutions. We validate PRISM on the WMT14 translation task. While the Standard Transformer maintains a slight edge in general competence on static benchmarks (23.88 vs 21.40 BLEU), it fails the \"Plasticity-Stability\" stress test completely. When injected with novel concepts, the Transformer suffers Catastrophic Forgetting, degrading by -10.55 BLEU points while achieving only 60% acquisition. In contrast, PRISM demonstrates Lossless Plasticity, achieving 96% 5-shot acquisition with negligible degradation (-0.84 BLEU). These results suggest that harmonic representations effectively decouple memory from reasoning, offering a structural solution to the plasticity-stability dilemma in real-time knowledge adaptation.",

However, existing English translations largely rely on literal rendering, making it difficult for target-language readers to reconstruct the underlying conceptual networks and apply them in clinical practice. This study adopted a human-in-the-loop (HITL) framework and selected four passages from the medical canon Huangdi Neijing that are fundamental in theory. Through prompt-based cognitive scaffolding, DeepSeek V3.1 was guided to identify metaphor and metonymy in the source text and convey the theory in translation. In the evaluation stage, ChatGPT 5 Pro and Gemini 2.5 Pro were instructed by prompts to simulate three types of real-world readers. Human translations, baseline model translations, and prompt-adjusted translations were scored by the simulated readers across five cognitive dimensions, followed by structured interviews and Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Results show that the prompt-adjusted LLM translations perform best across all five dimensions, with high cross-model and cross-role consistency. The interview themes reveal differences between human and machine translation, effective strategies for metaphor and metonymy transfer, and readers' cognitive preferences. This study provides a cognitive, efficient, and replicable HITL methodological pathway for the translation of ancient, concept-dense texts such as TCM.",

    "ori_summary": "As agentic AI systems increasingly operate autonomously, establishing trust through verifiable evaluation becomes critical. Yet existing benchmarks lack the transparency and auditability needed to assess whether agents behave reliably. We present DrawingBench, a verification framework for evaluating the trustworthiness of agentic LLMs through spatial reasoning tasks that require generating sequences of low-level GUI actions. Unlike opaque evaluations, DrawingBench provides transparent, rule-based assessment: 8 objective criteria enable reproducible scoring, while action-level inspection allows stakeholders to audit agent behavior. Our framework comprises 250 diverse prompts across 20 categories and 4 difficulty levels, deterministic evaluation metrics, and an external oversight mechanism through multi-turn feedback that enables human control over agent refinement. Evaluating four state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude-4 Sonnet, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1-mini, Gemini-2.5 Flash) across 1,000 tests, we establish both capabilities and limitations: models achieved 92.8% perfect performance with structured external feedback driving significant improvements (average +3.2%, up to +32.8% for complex scenes), but systematic error patterns emerged in tool state management and long-horizon planning. Notably, specification clarity proved more important than task complexity -- models achieved 100% perfect performance when given explicit, verifiable criteria. These findings demonstrate that transparent evaluation frameworks can establish trust in agentic systems, with external oversight proving more reliable than self-correction for guiding agent behavior.

However, existing generative policies often struggle with data inefficiency, requiring large-scale demonstrations, and sampling inefficiency, incurring slow action generation during inference. We introduce EfficientFlow, a unified framework for efficient embodied AI with flow-based policy learning. To enhance data efficiency, we bring equivariance into flow matching. We theoretically prove that when using an isotropic Gaussian prior and an equivariant velocity prediction network, the resulting action distribution remains equivariant, leading to improved generalization and substantially reduced data demands. To accelerate sampling, we propose a novel acceleration regularization strategy. As direct computation of acceleration is intractable for marginal flow trajectories, we derive a novel surrogate loss that enables stable and scalable training using only conditional trajectories. Across a wide range of robotic manipulation benchmarks, the proposed algorithm achieves competitive or superior performance under limited data while offering dramatically faster inference. These results highlight EfficientFlow as a powerful and efficient paradigm for high-performance embodied AI.",

Yet their stringent precision requirements demand highly robust models whose training relies on large amounts of annotated data. However, this kind of data is difficult to obtain in routine practice, especially negative samples. In this work, we focus on pipetting, the most critical and precision sensitive action in SDLs. To overcome the scarcity of training data, we build a hybrid pipeline that fuses real and virtual data generation. The real track adopts a human-in-the-loop scheme that couples automated acquisition with selective human verification to maximize accuracy with minimal effort. The virtual track augments the real data using reference-conditioned, prompt-guided image generation, which is further screened and validated for reliability. Together, these two tracks yield a class-balanced dataset that enables robust bubble detection training. On a held-out real test set, a model trained entirely on automatically acquired real images reaches 99.6% accuracy, and mixing real and generated data during training sustains 99.4% accuracy while reducing collection and review load. Our approach offers a scalable and cost-effective strategy for supplying visual feedback data to SDL workflows and provides a practical solution to data scarcity in rare event detection and broader vision tasks.",

Our key insight is that any moving 3D point, when co-visible in two cameras, obeys epipolar constraints once properly synchronized. To exploit this, VisualSync leverages off-the-shelf 3D reconstruction, feature matching, and dense tracking to extract tracklets, relative poses, and cross-view correspondences. It then jointly minimizes the epipolar error to estimate each camera's time offset. Experiments on four diverse, challenging datasets show that VisualSync outperforms baseline methods, achieving an median synchronization error below 50 ms.",

We investigate their representation of a fundamental law: gravity. Out-of-the-box video generators consistently generate objects falling at an effectively slower acceleration. However, these physical tests are often confounded by ambiguous metric scale. We first investigate if observed physical errors are artifacts of these ambiguities (e.g., incorrect frame rate assumptions). We find that even temporal rescaling cannot correct the high-variance gravity artifacts. To rigorously isolate the underlying physical representation from these confounds, we introduce a unit-free, two-object protocol that tests the timing ratio $t_1^2/t_2^2 = h_1/h_2$, a relationship independent of $g$, focal length, and scale. This relative test reveals violations of Galileo's equivalence principle. We then demonstrate that this physical gap can be partially mitigated with targeted specialization. A lightweight low-rank adaptor fine-tuned on only 100 single-ball clips raises $g_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ from $1.81\\,\\mathrm{m/s^2}$ to $6.43\\,\\mathrm{m/s^2}$ (reaching $65\\%$ of terrestrial gravity).

We present a track-conditioned V2V framework that enables joint editing of camera and object motion. We achieve this by conditioning a video generation model on a source video and paired 3D point tracks representing source and target motions. These 3D tracks establish sparse correspondences that transfer rich context from the source video to new motions while preserving spatiotemporal coherence. Crucially, compared to 2D tracks, 3D tracks provide explicit depth cues, allowing the model to resolve depth order and handle occlusions for precise motion editing. Trained in two stages on synthetic and real data, our model supports diverse motion edits, including joint camera/object manipulation, motion transfer, and non-rigid deformation, unlocking new creative potential in video editing.",

First, the original MF's training target depends not only on the underlying ground-truth fields but also on the network itself. To address this issue, we recast the objective as a loss on the instantaneous velocity $v$, re-parameterized by a network that predicts the average velocity $u$. Our reformulation yields a more standard regression problem and improves the training stability. Second, the original MF fixes the classifier-free guidance scale during training, which sacrifices flexibility. We tackle this issue by formulating guidance as explicit conditioning variables, thereby retaining flexibility at test time. The diverse conditions are processed through in-context conditioning, which reduces model size and benefits performance. Overall, our $\\textbf{improved MeanFlow}$ ($\\textbf{iMF}$) method, trained entirely from scratch, achieves $\\textbf{1.72}$ FID with a single function evaluation (1-NFE) on ImageNet 256$\\times$256. iMF substantially outperforms prior methods of this kind and closes the gap with multi-step methods while using no distillation. We hope our work will further advance fastforward generative modeling as a stand-alone paradigm.",

During rollout generation, RoaD incorporates expert guidance to bias trajectories toward high-quality behavior, producing informative yet realistic demonstrations for fine-tuning. This approach enables robust closed-loop adaptation with orders of magnitude less data than reinforcement learning, and avoids restrictive assumptions of prior closed-loop supervised fine-tuning (CL-SFT) methods, allowing broader applications domains including end-to-end driving. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RoaD on WOSAC, a large-scale traffic simulation benchmark, where it performs similar or better than the prior CL-SFT method; and in AlpaSim, a high-fidelity neural reconstruction-based simulator for end-to-end driving, where it improves driving score by 41\\% and reduces collisions by 54\\%.",

Empirical observations indicate that such purely linguistic intermediate reasoning often reduces performance on perception tasks. We argue that the core issue lies not in reasoning per se but in the form of reasoning: while these chains perform semantic reasoning in an unstructured linguistic space, visual perception requires reasoning in a spatial and object-centric space. In response, we introduce Artemis, a perception-policy learning framework that performs structured proposal-based reasoning, where each intermediate step is represented as a (label, bounding-box) pair capturing a verifiable visual state. This design enables explicit tracking of intermediate states, direct supervision for proposal quality, and avoids ambiguity introduced by language-based reasoning. Artemis is built on Qwen2.5-VL-3B, achieves strong performance on grounding and detection task and exhibits substantial generalization to counting and geometric-perception tasks. The consistent improvements across these diverse settings confirm that aligning reasoning with spatial representations enhances perception-policy learning. Owing to its strengthened visual reasoning, Artemis also achieves competitive performance on general MLLM benchmarks, illustrating that spatially grounded reasoning provides a principled route toward scalable and general perception policies.",

This paper introduces a new task ``Image Collaborative Segmentation and Captioning'' (SegCaptioning), which aims to translate a straightforward prompt, like a bounding box around an object, into diverse semantic interpretations represented by (caption, masks) pairs, allowing flexible result selection by users. This task poses significant challenges, including accurately capturing a user's intention from a minimal prompt while simultaneously predicting multiple semantically aligned caption words and masks. Technically, we propose a novel Scene Graph Guided Diffusion Model that leverages structured scene graph features for correlated mask-caption prediction. Initially, we introduce a Prompt-Centric Scene Graph Adaptor to map a user's prompt to a scene graph, effectively capturing his intention. Subsequently, we employ a diffusion process incorporating a Scene Graph Guided Bimodal Transformer to predict correlated caption-mask pairs by uncovering intricate correlations between them. To ensure accurate alignment, we design a Multi-Entities Contrastive Learning loss to explicitly align visual and textual entities by considering inter-modal similarity, resulting in well-aligned caption-mask pairs. Extensive experiments conducted on two datasets demonstrate that SGDiff achieves superior performance in SegCaptioning, yielding promising results for both captioning and segmentation tasks with minimal prompt input.",

Conventional simulation-based approaches rely on explicitly defined rigid object models and pre-scripted hand gestures, making them inadequate for capturing dynamic interactions with non-rigid or articulated entities such as deformable fabrics, elastic materials, hinge-based structures, furry surfaces, or even living creatures. In this paper, we present SpriteHand, an autoregressive video generation framework for real-time synthesis of versatile hand-object interaction videos across a wide range of object types and motion patterns. SpriteHand takes as input a static object image and a video stream in which the hands are imagined to interact with the virtual object embedded in a real-world scene, and generates corresponding hand-object interaction effects in real time. Our model employs a causal inference architecture for autoregressive generation and leverages a hybrid post-training approach to enhance visual realism and temporal coherence. Our 1.3B model supports real-time streaming generation at around 18 FPS and 640x368 resolution, with an approximate 150 ms latency on a single NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU, and more than a minute of continuous output.

We introduce Reinforcement Learning with World Grounding (RLWG), a self-supervised post-training framework that aligns pretrained world models with a physically verifiable structure through geometric and perceptual rewards. Analogous to reinforcement learning from verifiable feedback (RLVR) in language models, RLWG can use multiple rewards that measure pose cycle-consistency, depth reprojection, and temporal coherence. We instantiate this framework with GrndCtrl, a reward-aligned adaptation method based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), yielding world models that maintain stable trajectories, consistent geometry, and reliable rollouts for embodied navigation.

Experiments on fourteen benchmarks across image and video understanding tasks show that Script consistently achieves higher model efficiency and predictive accuracy compared to existing pruning methods.

However, threats to MOT algorithms have yet been widely studied. In particular, incorrect association between the tracked objects and their assigned IDs can lead to severe consequences, such as wrong trajectory predictions. Previous attacks against MOT either focused on hijacking the trackers of individual objects, or manipulating the tracker IDs in MOT by attacking the integrated object detection (OD) module in the digital domain, which are model-specific, non-robust, and only able to affect specific samples in offline datasets. In this paper, we present AdvTraj, the first online and physical ID-manipulation attack against tracking-by-detection MOT, in which an attacker uses adversarial trajectories to transfer its ID to a targeted object to confuse the tracking system, without attacking OD. Our simulation results in CARLA show that AdvTraj can fool ID assignments with 100% success rate in various scenarios for white-box attacks against SORT, which also have high attack transferability (up to 93% attack success rate) against state-of-the-art (SOTA) MOT algorithms due to their common design principles. We characterize the patterns of trajectories generated by AdvTraj and propose two universal adversarial maneuvers that can be performed by a human walker/driver in daily scenarios. Our work reveals under-explored weaknesses in the object association phase of SOTA MOT systems, and provides insights into enhancing the robustness of such systems.",

    "ori_summary": "Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are now central to healthcare applications such as medical visual question answering and imaging report generation. Yet, these models remain vulnerable to hallucination outputs that appear plausible but are in fact incorrect. In the natural image domain, several decoding strategies have been proposed to mitigate hallucinations by reinforcing visual evidence, but most rely on secondary decoding or rollback procedures that substantially slow inference. Moreover, existing solutions are often domain-specific and may introduce misalignment between modalities or between generated and ground-truth content. We introduce Med-VCD, a sparse visual-contrastive decoding method that mitigates hallucinations in medical LVLMs without the time overhead of secondary decoding. Med-VCD incorporates a novel token-sparsification strategy that selects visually informed tokens on the fly, trimming redundancy while retaining critical visual context and thus balancing efficiency with reliability. Evaluations on eight medical datasets, spanning ophthalmology, radiology, and pathology tasks in visual question answering, report generation, and dedicated hallucination benchmarks, show that Med-VCD raises factual accuracy by an average of 13\\% and improves hallucination accuracy by 6\\% relative to baseline medical LVLMs.",

    "ori_summary": "Medical image registration drives quantitative analysis across organs, modalities, and patient populations. Recent deep learning methods often combine low-level \"trend-driven\" computational blocks from computer vision, such as large-kernel CNNs, Transformers, and state-space models, with high-level registration-specific designs like motion pyramids, correlation layers, and iterative refinement. Yet, their relative contributions remain unclear and entangled. This raises a central question: should future advances in registration focus on importing generic architectural trends or on refining domain-specific design principles? Through a modular framework spanning brain, lung, cardiac, and abdominal registration, we systematically disentangle the influence of these two paradigms. Our evaluation reveals that low-level \"trend-driven\" computational blocks offer only marginal or inconsistent gains, while high-level registration-specific designs consistently deliver more accurate, smoother, and more robust deformations. These domain priors significantly elevate the performance of a standard U-Net baseline, far more than variants incorporating \"trend-driven\" blocks, achieving an average relative improvement of $\\sim3\\%$. All models and experiments are released within a transparent, modular benchmark that enables plug-and-play comparison for new architectures and registration tasks (https://github.com/BailiangJ/rethink-reg). This dynamic and extensible platform establishes a common ground for reproducible and fair evaluation, inviting the community to isolate genuine methodological contributions from domain priors. Our findings advocate a shift in research emphasis: from following architectural trends to embracing domain-specific design principles as the true drivers of progress in learning-based medical image registration.",

Vision provides global context but lacks direct measurements of properties such as texture and hardness, whereas touch supplies these cues. Modern visuo-tactile sensors capture both modalities in a single fused image, yielding intrinsically aligned inputs that are well suited to manipulation tasks requiring visual and tactile information. Most self-supervised learning (SSL) frameworks, however, compress feature maps into a global vector, discarding spatial structure and misaligning with the needs of manipulation. To address this, we propose SARL, a spatially-aware SSL framework that augments the Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL) architecture with three map-level objectives, including Saliency Alignment (SAL), Patch-Prototype Distribution Alignment (PPDA), and Region Affinity Matching (RAM), to keep attentional focus, part composition, and geometric relations consistent across views. These losses act on intermediate feature maps, complementing the global objective. SARL consistently outperforms nine SSL baselines across six downstream tasks with fused visual-tactile data. On the geometry-sensitive edge-pose regression task, SARL achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.3955, a 30% relative improvement over the next-best SSL method (0.5682 MAE) and approaching the supervised upper bound. These findings indicate that, for fused visual-tactile data, the most effective signal is structured spatial equivariance, in which features vary predictably with object geometry, which enables more capable robotic perception.",

Current methods for cell tracking are developed on videos with mostly single, constant signals and do not detect pivotal events such as cell death. Here, we present TransientTrack, a deep learning-based framework for cell tracking in multi-channel microscopy video data with transient fluorescent signals that fluctuate over time following processes such as the circadian rhythm of cells. By identifying key cellular events - mitosis (cell division) and apoptosis (cell death) our method allows us to build complete trajectories, including cell lineage information. TransientTrack is lightweight and performs matching on cell detection embeddings directly, without the need for quantification of tracking-specific cell features. Furthermore, our approach integrates Transformer Networks, multi-stage matching using all detection boxes, and the interpolation of missing tracklets with the Kalman Filter. This unified framework achieves strong performance across diverse conditions, effectively tracking cells and capturing cell division and death. We demonstrate the use of TransientTrack in an analysis of the efficacy of a chemotherapeutic drug at a single-cell level. The proposed framework could further advance quantitative studies of cancer cell dynamics, enabling detailed characterization of treatment response and resistance mechanisms.

Existing end-to-end models often struggle with this temporal hierarchy, offering solutions that lack generalization, incur high development costs for new tasks, and suffer from poor interpretability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a reconfigurable Multi-Agent System (MAS) as a foundational framework for sports video understanding. In our system, each agent functions as a distinct \"cognitive tool\" specializing in a specific aspect of analysis. The system's architecture is not confined to a single temporal dimension or task. By leveraging iterative invocation and flexible composition of these agents, our framework can construct adaptive pipelines for both short-term analytic reasoning (e.g., Rally QA) and long-term generative summarization (e.g., match summaries). We demonstrate the adaptability of this framework using two representative tasks in badminton analysis, showcasing its ability to bridge fine-grained event detection and global semantic organization.

However, whether these models can understand physics and generate physically plausible videos remains a question. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been widely used as general-purpose evaluators in various applications, they struggle to identify the physically impossible content from generated videos. To investigate this issue, we construct a \\textbf{PID} (\\textbf{P}hysical \\textbf{I}mplausibility \\textbf{D}etection) dataset, which consists of a \\textit{test split} of 500 manually annotated videos and a \\textit{train split} of 2,588 paired videos, where each implausible video is generated by carefully rewriting the caption of its corresponding real-world video to induce T2V models producing physically implausible content. With the constructed dataset, we introduce a lightweight fine-tuning approach, enabling VLMs to not only detect physically implausible events but also generate textual explanations on the violated physical principles. Taking the fine-tuned VLM as a physical plausibility detector and explainer, namely \\textbf{PhyDetEx}, we benchmark a series of state-of-the-art T2V models to assess their adherence to physical laws. Our findings show that although recent T2V models have made notable progress toward generating physically plausible content, understanding and adhering to physical laws remains a challenging issue, especially for open-source models.

However, the learning nature of SFT still limits the generalization of reasoning, thereby constraining the full potential of driving performance. Meanwhile, current RFT approaches are primarily applied to downstream tasks, since scene understanding is an open-ended problem where corresponding rewards are difficult to quantify. To address these limitations, we propose OpenREAD, an OPEN-ended REasoning reinforced vision-language model (VLM)-based autonomous driving (AD) framework that enables end-to-end RFT across the full spectrum from high-level reasoning to low-level trajectory planning. Specifically, we begin by constructing large-scale Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations on open-source driving-related knowledge datasets, and employ the powerful Qwen3 large language model (LLM) as the critic in RFT to quantify reasoning quality for open-ended questions during reward modeling. Extensive experiments confirm that joint end-to-end RFT yields substantial improvements in both upstream and downstream tasks, enabling OpenREAD to achieve state-of-the-art performance on reasoning and planning benchmarks.",

    "ori_summary": "Deep neural networks suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where performance on previous tasks degrades after training on a new task. This issue arises due to the model's tendency to overwrite previously acquired knowledge with new information. We present a novel approach to address this challenge, focusing on the intersection of memory-based methods and regularization approaches. We formulate a regularization strategy, termed Information Maximization (IM) regularizer, for memory-based continual learning methods, which is based exclusively on the expected label distribution, thus making it class-agnostic. As a consequence, IM regularizer can be directly integrated into various rehearsal-based continual learning methods, reducing forgetting and favoring faster convergence. Our empirical validation shows that, across datasets and regardless of the number of tasks, our proposed regularization strategy consistently improves baseline performance at the expense of a minimal computational overhead. The lightweight nature of IM ensures that it remains a practical and scalable solution, making it applicable to real-world continual learning scenarios where efficiency is paramount. Finally, we demonstrate the data-agnostic nature of our regularizer by applying it to video data, which presents additional challenges due to its temporal structure and higher memory requirements. Despite the significant domain gap, our experiments show that IM regularizer also improves the performance of video continual learning methods.",

    "ori_summary": "Current multimodal models aim to transcend the limitations of single-modality representations by unifying understanding and generation, often using text-to-image (T2I) tasks to calibrate semantic consistency. However, their reliance on static, single-image generation in training and evaluation leads to overfitting to static pattern matching and semantic fusion, while fundamentally hindering their ability to model dynamic processes that unfold over time. To address these constraints, we propose Envision-a causal event progression benchmark for chained text-to-multi-image generation. Grounded in world knowledge and structured by spatiotemporal causality, it reorganizes existing evaluation dimensions and includes 1,000 four-stage prompts spanning six scientific and humanities domains. To transition evaluation from single images to sequential frames and assess whether models truly internalize world knowledge while adhering to causal-temporal constraints, we introduce Envision-Score, a holistic metric integrating multi-dimensional consistency, physicality, and aesthetics. Comprehensive evaluation of 15 models (10 specialized T2I models, 5 unified models) uncovers: specialized T2I models demonstrate proficiency in aesthetic rendering yet lack intrinsic world knowledge. Unified multimodal models bridge this gap, consistently outperforming specialized counterparts in causal narrative coherence. However, even these unified architectures remain subordinate to closed-source models and struggle to overcome the core challenge of spatiotemporal consistency. This demonstrates that a focus on causally-isolated single images impedes multi-frame reasoning and generation, promoting static pattern matching over dynamic world modeling-ultimately limiting world knowledge internalization, generation.",

Critically, existing pure-vision encoders and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are strongly appearance-biased, lack temporal understanding, and thus struggle to discern intricate motion dynamics and anatomical implausibilities in generated videos. We tackle this gap by introducing a novel evaluation metric derived from a learned latent space of real-world human actions. Our method first captures the nuances, constraints, and temporal smoothness of real-world motion by fusing appearance-agnostic human skeletal geometry features with appearance-based features. We posit that this combined feature space provides a robust representation of action plausibility. Given a generated video, our metric quantifies its action quality by measuring the distance between its underlying representations and this learned real-world action distribution. For rigorous validation, we develop a new multi-faceted benchmark specifically designed to probe temporally challenging aspects of human action fidelity. Through extensive experiments, we show that our metric achieves substantial improvement of more than 68% compared to existing state-of-the-art methods on our benchmark, performs competitively on established external benchmarks, and has a stronger correlation with human perception. Our in-depth analysis reveals critical limitations in current video generative models and establishes a new standard for advanced research in video generation.",

While SAM2 excels in video object segmentation by providing dense segmentation masks based on prompts, extending it to dense Video Semantic Segmentation (VSS) poses challenges due to the need for spatial accuracy, temporal consistency, and the ability to track multiple objects with complex boundaries and varying scales. This paper explores the extension of SAM2 for VSS, focusing on two primary approaches and highlighting firsthand observations and common challenges faced during this process. The first approach involves using SAM2 to extract unique objects as masks from a given image, with a segmentation network employed in parallel to generate and refine initial predictions. The second approach utilizes the predicted masks to extract unique feature vectors, which are then fed into a simple network for classification. The resulting classifications and masks are subsequently combined to produce the final segmentation. Our experiments suggest that leveraging SAM2 enhances overall performance in VSS, primarily due to its precise predictions of object boundaries.",

Traditional registration techniques often struggle with challenges such as contrast differences, spatial distortions, and modality-specific variations. To address these limitations, we propose a method that integrates learnable edge kernels with learning-based rigid and non-rigid registration techniques. Unlike conventional layers that learn all features without specific bias, our approach begins with a predefined edge detection kernel, which is then perturbed with random noise. These kernels are learned during training to extract optimal edge features tailored to the task. This adaptive edge detection enhances the registration process by capturing diverse structural features critical in medical imaging. To provide clearer insight into the contribution of each component in our design, we introduce four variant models for rigid registration and four variant models for non-rigid registration. We evaluated our approach using a dataset provided by the Medical University across three setups: rigid registration without skull removal, with skull removal, and non-rigid registration. Additionally, we assessed performance on two publicly available datasets. Across all experiments, our method consistently outperformed state-of-the-art techniques, demonstrating its potential to improve multi-modal image alignment and anatomical structure analysis.",

Identifying meaningful activities or situations (e.g., two objects coming closer) remains difficult and cannot be achieved by content extraction alone. Currently, Video Situation Analysis (VSA) is done manually with a human in the loop, which is error-prone and labor-intensive, or through custom algorithms designed for specific video types or situations. These algorithms are not general-purpose and require a new algorithm/software for each new situation or video from a new domain. This report proposes a general-purpose VSA framework that overcomes the above limitations. Video contents are extracted once using state-of-the-art Video Content Extraction technologies. They are represented using two alternative models -- the extended relational model (R++) and graph models. When represented using R++, the extracted contents can be used as data streams, enabling Continuous Query Processing via the proposed Continuous Query Language for Video Analysis. The graph models complement this by enabling the detection of situations that are difficult or impossible to detect using the relational model alone. Existing graph algorithms and newly developed algorithms support a wide variety of situation detection. To support domain independence, primitive situation variants across domains are identified and expressed as parameterized templates. Extensive experiments were conducted across several interesting situations from three domains -- AL, CM, and SL-- to evaluate the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed approach using a dataset of videos of varying lengths from these domains.",

While incorporating past actions and observations can improve decision making, naive use of full history leads to excessive computational overhead and distraction from irrelevant information. To address this, we introduce HiconAgent, a GUI agent trained with History Context-aware Policy Optimization (HCPO) for efficient and effective utilization of historical information. HCPO optimizes history usage in both sampling and policy updates through two complementary components: (1) Dynamic Context Sampling (DCS) presents the agent with variable length histories during sampling, enabling adaptive use of the most relevant context; (2) Anchor-guided History Compression (AHC) refines the policy update phase with a dual branch strategy where the compressed branch removes history observations while keeping history actions as information flow anchors. The compressed and uncompressed branches are coupled through a history-enhanced alignment loss to enforce consistent history usage while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on mainstream GUI navigation benchmarks demonstrate strong performance. Despite being smaller, HiconAgent-3B outperforms GUI-R1-7B by +8.46 percent grounding accuracy and +11.32 percent step success rate on GUI-Odyssey, while achieving comparable results on AndroidControl and AITW with up to 2.47x computational speedup and 60 percent FLOPs reduction.",

    "ori_summary": "Generating realistic hand-object interactions (HOI) videos is a significant challenge due to the difficulty of modeling physical constraints (e.g., contact and occlusion between hands and manipulated objects). Current methods utilize HOI representation as an auxiliary generative objective to guide video synthesis. However, there is a dilemma between 2D and 3D representations that cannot simultaneously guarantee scalability and interaction fidelity. To address this limitation, we propose a structure and contact-aware representation that captures hand-object contact, hand-object occlusion, and holistic structure context without 3D annotations. This interaction-oriented and scalable supervision signal enables the model to learn fine-grained interaction physics and generalize to open-world scenarios. To fully exploit the proposed representation, we introduce a joint-generation paradigm with a share-and-specialization strategy that generates interaction-oriented representations and videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two real-world datasets in generating physics-realistic and temporally coherent HOI videos. Furthermore, our approach exhibits strong generalization to challenging open-world scenarios, highlighting the benefit of our scalable design. Our project page is https://hgzn258.github.io/SCAR/.",

However, these models falter in long-tail settings, such as medical imaging, where rare pathologies comprise a small fraction of data. This results in mode collapse: tail-class outputs lack quality and diversity, undermining the goal of synthetic data augmentation for underrepresented conditions. We pinpoint gradient conflicts between frequent head and rare tail classes as the primary culprit, a factor unaddressed by existing sampling or conditioning methods that mainly steer inference without altering the learned distribution. To resolve this, we propose GRASP: Guided Residual Adapters with Sample-wise Partitioning. GRASP uses external priors to statically partition samples into clusters that minimize intra-group gradient clashes. It then fine-tunes pre-trained models by injecting cluster-specific residual adapters into transformer feedforward layers, bypassing learned gating for stability and efficiency. On the long-tail MIMIC-CXR-LT dataset, GRASP yields superior FID and diversity metrics, especially for rare classes, outperforming baselines like vanilla fine-tuning and Mixture of Experts variants. Downstream classification on NIH-CXR-LT improves considerably for tail labels. Generalization to ImageNet-LT confirms broad applicability.

    "ori_summary": "Tiny object detection in remote sensing imagery has attracted significant research interest in recent years. Despite recent progress, achieving balanced detection performance across diverse object scales remains a formidable challenge, particularly in scenarios where dense tiny objects and large objects coexist. Although large foundation models have revolutionized general vision tasks, their application to tiny object detection remains unexplored due to the extreme scale variation and density distribution inherent to remote sensing imagery. To bridge this scale gap, we propose ScaleBridge-Det, to the best of our knowledge, the first large detection framework designed for tiny objects, which could achieve balanced performance across diverse scales through scale-adaptive expert routing and density-guided query allocation. Specifically, we introduce a Routing-Enhanced Mixture Attention (REM) module that dynamically selects and fuses scale-specific expert features via adaptive routing to address the tendency of standard MoE models to favor dominant scales. REM generates complementary and discriminative multi-scale representations suitable for both tiny and large objects. Furthermore, we present a Density-Guided Dynamic Query (DGQ) module that predicts object density to adaptively adjust query positions and numbers, enabling efficient resource allocation for objects of varying scales. The proposed framework allows ScaleBridge-Det to simultaneously optimize performance for both dense tiny and general objects without trade-offs. Extensive experiments on benchmark and cross-domain datasets demonstrate that ScaleBridge-Det achieves state-of-the-art performance on AI-TOD-V2 and DTOD, while exhibiting superior cross-domain robustness on VisDrone.",

However, traditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) methods exhibit inherent limitations, struggling to capture long-range dependencies and complex nonlinear relationships. To address the above limitations, an Adaptive Dual Branch Kolmogorov-Arnold UNet (DB-KAUNet) is proposed for retinal vessel segmentation. In DB-KAUNet, we design a Heterogeneous Dual-Branch Encoder (HDBE) that features parallel CNN and Transformer pathways. The HDBE strategically interleaves standard CNN and Transformer blocks with novel KANConv and KAT blocks, enabling the model to form a comprehensive feature representation. To optimize feature processing, we integrate several critical components into the HDBE. First, a Cross-Branch Channel Interaction (CCI) module is embedded to facilitate efficient interaction of channel features between the parallel pathways. Second, an attention-based Spatial Feature Enhancement (SFE) module is employed to enhance spatial features and fuse the outputs from both branches. Building upon the SFE module, an advanced Spatial Feature Enhancement with Geometrically Adaptive Fusion (SFE-GAF) module is subsequently developed. In the SFE-GAF module, adaptive sampling is utilized to focus on true vessel morphology precisely. The adaptive process strengthens salient vascular features while significantly reducing background noise and computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE_DB1 datasets validate that DB-KAUNet achieves leading segmentation performance and demonstrates exceptional robustness.",

TTT reformulates attention operation as an online learning problem, constructing a compact inner model from key-value pairs at test time. This reformulation opens a rich and flexible design space while achieving linear computational complexity. However, crafting a powerful visual TTT design remains challenging: fundamental choices for the inner module and inner training lack comprehensive understanding and practical guidelines. To bridge this critical gap, in this paper, we present a systematic empirical study of TTT designs for visual sequence modeling. From a series of experiments and analyses, we distill six practical insights that establish design principles for effective visual TTT and illuminate paths for future improvement. These findings culminate in the Vision Test-Time Training (ViT$^3$) model, a pure TTT architecture that achieves linear complexity and parallelizable computation. We evaluate ViT$^3$ across diverse visual tasks, including image classification, image generation, object detection, and semantic segmentation. Results show that ViT$^3$ consistently matches or outperforms advanced linear-complexity models (e.g., Mamba and linear attention variants) and effectively narrows the gap to highly optimized vision Transformers.

To address this, we propose Fusion-Diff, a novel generative editing framework with high effectiveness and data efficiency designed for multimodal alignment. First, it introduces a multimodal fusion feature editing strategy within a joint vision-language (VL) space, substantially narrowing the modality gap. Second, to maximize data efficiency, the framework incorporates a lightweight Control-Adapter, enabling state-of-the-art performance through fine-tuning on only a limited-scale synthetic dataset of 200K samples.

Conditioned on the full instruction and historical observations, the model is trained to understand the navigation instructions by decomposing the task, tracking its progress, and formulating the subsequent sub-goal. Simultaneously, it functions as a generative world model, providing crucial foresight by predicting short-term environmental dynamics and long-term navigation milestones. The VLM's structured plan guides its targeted prediction, while the imagined future provides rich context to inform the navigation actions, creating a powerful internal feedback loop of perception-planning/prediction-action. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on the R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmark that NavForesee achieves highly competitive performance in complex scenarios. Our work highlights the immense potential of fusing explicit language planning with implicit spatiotemporal prediction, paving the way for more intelligent and capable embodied agents.",

    "ori_summary": "3D reconstruction from multi-view images is a core challenge in computer vision. Recently, feed-forward methods have emerged as efficient and robust alternatives to traditional per-scene optimization techniques. Among them, state-of-the-art models like the Visual Geometry Grounding Transformer (VGGT) leverage full self-attention over all image tokens to capture global relationships. However, this approach suffers from poor scalability due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention and the large number of tokens generated in long image sequences. In this work, we introduce FlashVGGT, an efficient alternative that addresses this bottleneck through a descriptor-based attention mechanism. Instead of applying dense global attention across all tokens, FlashVGGT compresses spatial information from each frame into a compact set of descriptor tokens. Global attention is then computed as cross-attention between the full set of image tokens and this smaller descriptor set, significantly reducing computational overhead. Moreover, the compactness of the descriptors enables online inference over long sequences via a chunk-recursive mechanism that reuses cached descriptors from previous chunks. Experimental results show that FlashVGGT achieves reconstruction accuracy competitive with VGGT while reducing inference time to just 9.3% of VGGT for 1,000 images, and scaling efficiently to sequences exceeding 3,000 images.

    "ori_summary": "Deep unsupervised anomaly detection in brain magnetic resonance imaging offers a promising route to identify pathological deviations without requiring lesion-specific annotations. Yet, fragmented evaluations, heterogeneous datasets, and inconsistent metrics have hindered progress toward clinical translation. Here, we present a large-scale, multi-center benchmark of deep unsupervised anomaly detection for brain imaging. The training cohort comprised 2,976 T1 and 2,972 T2-weighted scans from healthy individuals across six scanners, with ages ranging from 6 to 89 years. Validation used 92 scans to tune hyperparameters and estimate unbiased thresholds. Testing encompassed 2,221 T1w and 1,262 T2w scans spanning healthy datasets and diverse clinical cohorts. Across all algorithms, the Dice-based segmentation performance varied between 0.03 and 0.65, indicating substantial variability. To assess robustness, we systematically evaluated the impact of different scanners, lesion types and sizes, as well as demographics (age, sex). Reconstruction-based methods, particularly diffusion-inspired approaches, achieved the strongest lesion segmentation performance, while feature-based methods showed greater robustness under distributional shifts. However, systematic biases, such as scanner-related effects, were observed for the majority of algorithms, including that small and low-contrast lesions were missed more often, and that false positives varied with age and sex. Increasing healthy training data yields only modest gains, underscoring that current unsupervised anomaly detection frameworks are limited algorithmically rather than by data availability. Our benchmark establishes a transparent foundation for future research and highlights priorities for clinical translation, including image native pretraining, principled deviation measures, fairness-aware modeling, and robust domain adaptation.",

    "ori_summary": "Diffusion models have emerged as a leading technique for generating images due to their ability to create high-resolution and realistic images. Despite their strong performance, diffusion models still struggle in managing image collections with significant feature differences. They often fail to capture complex features and produce conflicting results. Research has attempted to address this issue by learning different regions of an image through multiple diffusion paths and then combining them. However, this approach leads to inefficient coordination among multiple paths and high computational costs. To tackle these issues, this paper presents a Diffusion Fuzzy System (DFS), a latent-space multi-path diffusion model guided by fuzzy rules. DFS offers several advantages. First, unlike traditional multi-path diffusion methods, DFS uses multiple diffusion paths, each dedicated to learning a specific class of image features. By assigning each path to a different feature type, DFS overcomes the limitations of multi-path models in capturing heterogeneous image features. Second, DFS employs rule-chain-based reasoning to dynamically steer the diffusion process and enable efficient coordination among multiple paths. Finally, DFS introduces a fuzzy membership-based latent-space compression mechanism to reduce the computational costs of multi-path diffusion effectively. We tested our method on three public datasets: LSUN Bedroom, LSUN Church, and MS COCO. The results show that DFS achieves more stable training and faster convergence than existing single-path and multi-path diffusion models. Additionally, DFS surpasses baseline models in both image quality and alignment between text and images, and also shows improved accuracy when comparing generated images to target references.",

    "ori_summary": "Despite rapid advances in molecular and materials machine learning, most models still lack physical transferability: they fit correlations across whole molecules or crystals rather than learning the quantum interactions between atomic pairs. Yet bonding, charge redistribution, orbital hybridization, and electronic coupling all emerge from these two-body interactions that define local quantum fields in many-body systems. We introduce QuantumCanvas, a large-scale multimodal benchmark that treats two-body quantum systems as foundational units of matter. The dataset spans 2,850 element-element pairs, each annotated with 18 electronic, thermodynamic, and geometric properties and paired with ten-channel image representations derived from l- and m-resolved orbital densities, angular field transforms, co-occupancy maps, and charge-density projections. These physically grounded images encode spatial, angular, and electrostatic symmetries without explicit coordinates, providing an interpretable visual modality for quantum learning. Benchmarking eight architectures across 18 targets, we report mean absolute errors of 0.201 eV on energy gap using GATv2, 0.265 eV on HOMO and 0.274 eV on LUMO using EGNN. For energy-related quantities, DimeNet attains 2.27 eV total-energy MAE and 0.132 eV repulsive-energy MAE, while a multimodal fusion model achieves a 2.15 eV Mermin free-energy MAE. Pretraining on QuantumCanvas further improves convergence stability and generalization when fine-tuned on larger datasets such as QM9, MD17, and CrysMTM. By unifying orbital physics with vision-based representation learning, QuantumCanvas provides a principled and interpretable basis for learning transferable quantum interactions through coupled visual and numerical modalities.

To this end, we aim for training a network on one domain (e.g., CT) and directly apply it to a different domain (e.g., MR) without adapting the model and without requiring images or annotations from the new domain during training. We propose a novel method for promoting DG when training deep segmentation networks, which we call SRCSM. During training, our method diversifies the source domain through semantic-aware random convolution, where different regions of a source image are augmented differently, based on their annotation labels. At test-time, we complement the randomization of the training domain via mapping the intensity of target domain images, making them similar to source domain data. We perform a comprehensive evaluation on a variety of cross-modality and cross-center generalization settings for abdominal, whole-heart and prostate segmentation, where we outperform previous DG techniques in a vast majority of experiments. Additionally, we also investigate our method when training on whole-heart CT or MR data and testing on the diastolic and systolic phase of cine MR data captured with different scanner hardware, where we make a step towards closing the domain gap in this even more challenging setting. Overall, our evaluation shows that SRCSM can be considered a new state-of-the-art in DG for medical image segmentation and, moreover, even achieves a segmentation performance that matches the performance of the in-domain baseline in several settings.",

Our two-stage approach first processes skeletal tracking data through Graph Neural Networks to capture nuanced motion patterns, then employs a Transformer architecture with specialized attention mechanisms to model player interactions. We introduce event projection heads that explicitly connect player movements to basketball events like passes, shots, and steals, training the model to associate physical motion patterns with their tactical purposes. Experiments on NBA tracking data demonstrate significant improvements over position-only baselines: 35% reduction in trajectory prediction error compared to state-of-the-art position-based models and consistent performance gains across key basketball analytics tasks.

DTS first applies singular value decomposition to the task-specific information and retains only a small subset of singular values and vectors. It then introduces a novel thresholding strategy that partitions singular vector elements into groups and assigns a scaling factor to each group. To enable generalization to unseen tasks, we further extend DTS with a variant that fuses task-specific information in a data-free manner based on the semantic similarity of task characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while requiring only 1\\% additional storage per task. Furthermore, experiments on unseen tasks show that the DTS variant achieves significantly better generalization performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/krumpguo/DTS.",

Existing approaches typically divide this task into two stages: canonical template construction and target pose deformation.

Moreover, target pose deformation suffers from structural distortions caused by Linear Blend Skinning (LBS), which significantly undermines animation realism. To address these problems, we propose a unified learning-based framework to address both challenges in two phases. For the former phase, to overcome the inefficiencies and artifacts during template construction, we leverage a U-Net architecture that decouples texture and pose information in a feed-forward process, enabling fast generation of a human template. For the latter phase, we propose a data-driven refinement technique that enhances structural integrity.

Unlike open-vocabulary methods, our model dynamically extends its vocabulary at inference time without retraining, enabling robust detection and naming of anomalies beyond common class definitions such as those in Cityscapes.

    "ori_summary": "Leveraging pre-trained Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for high-resolution (HR) image synthesis often leads to spatial layout collapse and degraded texture fidelity. Prior work mitigates these issues with complex pipelines that first perform a base-resolution (i.e., training-resolution) denoising process to guide HR generation. We instead explore the intrinsic generative mechanisms of DiTs and propose ResDiT, a training-free method that scales resolution efficiently. We identify the core factor governing spatial layout, position embeddings (PEs), and show that the original PEs encode incorrect positional information when extrapolated to HR, which triggers layout collapse. To address this, we introduce a PE scaling technique that rectifies positional encoding under resolution changes. To further remedy low-fidelity details, we develop a local-enhancement mechanism grounded in base-resolution local attention. We design a patch-level fusion module that aggregates global and local cues, together with a Gaussian-weighted splicing strategy that eliminates grid artifacts. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that ResDiT consistently delivers high-fidelity, high-resolution image synthesis and integrates seamlessly with downstream tasks, including spatially controlled generation.",

However, existing benchmarks lack systematic evaluation of MLLMs' ability to identify and correct these video reasoning errors. To bridge this gap, we propose \\textit{ViRectify}, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate their fine-grained correction capability. Through an AI-assisted annotation pipeline with human verification, we construct a dataset of over 30\\textit{K} instances spanning dynamic perception, scientific reasoning, and embodied decision-making domains. In \\textit{ViRectify}, we challenge MLLMs to perform step-wise error identification and generate rationales with key video evidence grounding. In addition, we further propose the trajectory evidence-driven correction framework, comprising step-wise error trajectory and reward modeling on visual evidence-grounded correction. It encourages the model to explicitly concentrate on error propagation and key timestamps for correction. Extensive evaluation across 16 advanced MLLMs demonstrates that our \\textit{ViRectify} serves as a challenging testbed, where GPT-5 achieves only 31.94\\% correction accuracy. Our framework enables a Qwen2.5-VL-7B to consistently outperform the variants of 72B on \\textit{ViRectify}, showing the effectiveness of our approach. Further analysis uncovers systematic asymmetries in error correction across models, and our dataset is also a valuable data resource to perform reflection learning. We believe \\textit{ViRectify} provides a new direction for comprehensively evaluating the advanced MLLMs in video reasoning.",

In this paper, for the first time, we introduce MDMs into the Scene Text Recognition (STR) task. We show that vanilla MDM lags behind ARMs in terms of accuracy, although it improves recognition efficiency. To bridge this gap, we propose MDiff4STR, a Mask Diffusion model enhanced with two key improvement strategies tailored for STR. Specifically, we identify two key challenges in applying MDMs to STR: noising gap between training and inference, and overconfident predictions during inference. Both significantly hinder the performance of MDMs. To mitigate the first issue, we develop six noising strategies that better align training with inference behavior. For the second, we propose a token-replacement noise mechanism that provides a non-mask noise type, encouraging the model to reconsider and revise overly confident but incorrect predictions. We conduct extensive evaluations of MDiff4STR on both standard and challenging STR benchmarks, covering diverse scenarios including irregular, artistic, occluded, and Chinese text, as well as whether the use of pretraining. Across these settings, MDiff4STR consistently outperforms popular STR models, surpassing state-of-the-art ARMs in accuracy, while maintaining fast inference with only three denoising steps.

We introduce FRAMER, a plug-and-play training scheme that exploits diffusion priors without changing the backbone or inference. At each denoising step, the final-layer feature map teaches all intermediate layers. Teacher and student feature maps are decomposed into LF/HF bands via FFT masks to align supervision with the model's internal frequency hierarchy. For LF, an Intra Contrastive Loss (IntraCL) stabilizes globally shared structure. For HF, an Inter Contrastive Loss (InterCL) sharpens instance-specific details using random-layer and in-batch negatives. Two adaptive modulators, Frequency-based Adaptive Weight (FAW) and Frequency-based Alignment Modulation (FAM), reweight per-layer LF/HF signals and gate distillation by current similarity.

However, our empirical study reveals that standard inversion is sub-optimal for EIE, leading to poor quality and inefficiency. To tackle this challenge, we introduce \\textbf{Reversible Inversion ({ReInversion})} for effective and efficient EIE. Specifically, ReInversion operates as a two-stage denoising process, which is first conditioned on the source image and subsequently on the reference. Besides, we introduce a Mask-Guided Selective Denoising (MSD) strategy to constrain edits to target regions, preserving the structural consistency of the background.

Recent learning-based metrics attempt to improve this by relying on rendered images and 2D image quality metrics. However, these approaches face limitations due to incomplete structural coverage and sensitivity to viewpoint choices. Moreover, most methods are trained on synthetic distortions, which differ significantly from real-world distortions, resulting in a domain gap. To address these challenges, we propose a new fidelity evaluation method that is based directly on 3D meshes with texture, without relying on rendering. Our method, named Textured Geometry Evaluation TGE, jointly uses the geometry and color information to calculate the fidelity of the input textured mesh with comparison to a reference colored shape. To train and evaluate our metric, we design a human-annotated dataset with real-world distortions. Experiments show that TGE outperforms rendering-based and geometry-only methods on real-world distortion dataset.",

In this work, we propose a Shape-Realism Alignment Metric that leverages a large language model (LLM) as a bridge between mesh shape information and realism evaluation. To achieve this, we adopt a mesh encoding approach that converts 3D shapes into the language token space. A dedicated realism decoder is designed to align the language model's output with human perception of realism. Additionally, we introduce a new dataset, RealismGrading, which provides human-annotated realism scores without the need for ground truth shapes. Our dataset includes shapes generated by 16 different algorithms on over a dozen objects, making it more representative of practical 3D shape distributions. We validate our metric's performance and generalizability through k-fold cross-validation across different objects.

In this paper, we propose BlinkBud, which utilizes a single earbud and a paired phone to online detect hazardous objects approaching from behind of a user. The core idea is to accurately track visually identified objects utilizing a small number of sampled camera images taken from the earbud. To minimize the power consumption of the earbud and the phone while guaranteeing the best tracking accuracy, a novel 3D object tracking algorithm is devised, integrating both a Kalman filter based trajectory estimation scheme and an optimal image sampling strategy based on reinforcement learning. Moreover, the impact of constant user head movements on the tracking accuracy is significantly eliminated by leveraging the estimated pitch and yaw angles to correct the object depth estimation and align the camera coordinate system to the user's body coordinate system, respectively. We implement a prototype BlinkBud system and conduct extensive real-world experiments. Results show that BlinkBud is lightweight with ultra-low mean power consumptions of 29.8 mW and 702.6 mW on the earbud and smartphone, respectively, and can accurately detect hazards with a low average false positive ratio (FPR) and false negative ratio (FNR) of 4.90% and 1.47%, respectively.",

This paper introduces BharatOCR, a novel segmentation-free paragraph-level handwritten Hindi and Urdu text recognition. We propose a ViT-Transformer Decoder-LM architecture for handwritten text recognition, where a Vision Transformer (ViT) extracts visual features, a Transformer decoder generates text sequences, and a pre-trained language model (LM) refines the output to improve accuracy, fluency, and coherence. Our model utilizes a Data-efficient Image Transformer (DeiT) model proposed for masked image modeling in this research work. In addition, we adopt a RoBERTa architecture optimized for masked language modeling (MLM) to enhance the linguistic comprehension and generative capabilities of the proposed model. The transformer decoder generates text sequences from visual embeddings. This model is designed to iteratively process a paragraph image line by line, called implicit line segmentation. The proposed model was evaluated using our custom dataset ('Parimal Urdu') and ('Parimal Hindi'), introduced in this research work, as well as two public datasets. The proposed model achieved benchmark results in the NUST-UHWR, PUCIT-OUHL, and Parimal-Urdu datasets, achieving character recognition rates of 96.24%, 92.05%, and 94.80%, respectively.

    "ori_summary": "Large-scale video-text pretraining achieves strong performance but depends on noisy, synthetic captions with limited semantic coverage, often overlooking implicit world knowledge such as object motion, 3D geometry, and physical cues. In contrast, masked video modeling (MVM) directly exploits spatiotemporal structures but trails text-supervised methods on general tasks. We find this gap arises from overlooked architectural issues: pixel-level reconstruction struggles with convergence and its low-level requirement often conflicts with semantics, while latent prediction often encourages shortcut learning. To address these, we disentangle the traditional encoder-decoder design into an Encoder-Predictor-Decoder (EPD) framework, where the predictor acts as a latent world model, and propose InternVideo-Next, a two-stage pretraining scheme that builds a semantically consistent yet detail-preserving latent space for this world model. First, conventional linear decoder in pixel MVM enforces the predictor output latent to be linearly projected to, thus separable in pixel space, causing the conflict with semantic abstraction. Our Stage 1 proposes a conditional diffusion decoder and injects reliable image-level semantic priors to enhance semantics and convergence, thus bridging pixel-level fidelity with high-level semantic abstraction. Stage 2 further learns world knowledge by predicting frozen Stage 1 targets within this space, mitigating shortcut learning. Trained on public, unlabeled videos, InternVideo-Next achieves state-of-the-art results across benchmarks and provides a scalable path toward general video representation learning.",

However, existing methods still struggle to adhere to fine-grained prompt semantics, especially when prompts entail substantial transformations of the input image (e.g., object addition, deletion, or modification), a shortcoming we term semantic negligence. In a pilot study, we find that applying a Gaussian blur to the input image improves semantic adherence. Analyzing attention maps, we observe clearer foreground-background separation. From an energy perspective, this corresponds to a lower-entropy cross-attention distribution. Motivated by this, we introduce AlignVid, a training-free framework with two components: (i) Attention Scaling Modulation (ASM), which directly reweights attention via lightweight Q or K scaling, and (ii) Guidance Scheduling (GS), which applies ASM selectively across transformer blocks and denoising steps to reduce visual quality degradation. This minimal intervention improves prompt adherence while limiting aesthetic degradation. In addition, we introduce OmitI2V to evaluate semantic negligence in TI2V generation, comprising 367 human-annotated samples that span addition, deletion, and modification scenarios.

A thorough evaluation of 10 different machine learning models using 5-fold cross-validation across several datasets was part of our all-inclusive strategy, which also included feature engineering and data pretreatment (using Random Over-Sampling (ROS) to solve class imbalance). Our optimized ensemble model (Random Forest + ExtraTrees + XGBoost) performed exceptionally well, obtaining a strong 99.09% accuracy on the Stroke Prediction Dataset (SPD). We improved the model's transparency and clinical applicability by identifying three important clinical variables using LIME-based interpretability analysis: age, hypertension, and glucose levels. Through early prediction, this study highlights how combining ensemble learning with explainable AI (XAI) can deliver highly accurate and interpretable stroke risk assessment.

For comprehensive evaluation of applicability of segmentation results, we establish a standardized CFD applicability evaluation system that enables the automated and consistent conversion of segmentation masks into CFD models, offering an applicability-focused assessment of segmentation outcomes.

Unlike existing datasets that focus on external or open-air environments, our dataset is the first to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of synthetic data in enhancing the real-world FOD detection performance in confined, closed structures.

    "ori_summary": "Temporal Action Localization (TAL) remains a fundamental challenge in video understanding, aiming to identify the start time, end time, and category of all action instances within untrimmed videos. While recent single-stage, anchor-free models like ActionFormer have set a high standard by leveraging Transformers for temporal reasoning, they often struggle with two persistent issues: the precise localization of actions with ambiguous or \"fuzzy\" temporal boundaries and the effective fusion of multi-scale contextual information. In this paper, we introduce the Temporal Boundary Transformer (TBT-Former), a new architecture that directly addresses these limitations. TBT-Former enhances the strong ActionFormer baseline with three core contributions: (1) a higher-capacity scaled Transformer backbone with an increased number of attention heads and an expanded Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) dimension for more powerful temporal feature extraction; (2) a cross-scale feature pyramid network (FPN) that integrates a top-down pathway with lateral connections, enabling richer fusion of high-level semantics and low-level temporal details; and (3) a novel boundary distribution regression head. Inspired by the principles of Generalized Focal Loss (GFL), this new head recasts the challenging task of boundary regression as a more flexible probability distribution learning problem, allowing the model to explicitly represent and reason about boundary uncertainty. Within the paradigm of Transformer-based architectures, TBT-Former advances the formidable benchmark set by its predecessors, establishing a new level of performance on the highly competitive THUMOS14 and EPIC-Kitchens 100 datasets, while remaining competitive on the large-scale ActivityNet-1.3.

    "ori_summary": "Real-time 3D reconstruction is a fundamental task in computer graphics. Recently, differentiable-rendering-based SLAM system has demonstrated significant potential, enabling photorealistic scene rendering through learnable scene representations such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Current differentiable rendering methods face dual challenges in real-time computation and sensor noise sensitivity, leading to degraded geometric fidelity in scene reconstruction and limited practicality. To address these challenges, we propose a novel real-time system EGG-Fusion, featuring robust sparse-to-dense camera tracking and a geometry-aware Gaussian surfel mapping module, introducing an information filter-based fusion method that explicitly accounts for sensor noise to achieve high-precision surface reconstruction. The proposed differentiable Gaussian surfel mapping effectively models multi-view consistent surfaces while enabling efficient parameter optimization. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves a surface reconstruction error of 0.6\\textit{cm} on standardized benchmark datasets including Replica and ScanNet++, representing over 20\\% improvement in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) GS-based methods. Notably, the system maintains real-time processing capabilities at 24 FPS, establishing it as one of the most accurate differentiable-rendering-based real-time reconstruction systems.

    "ori_summary": "Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. Traditional methods typically produce a single segmentation mask, failing to capture inherent uncertainty. Recent generative models enable the creation of multiple plausible masks per image, mimicking the collaborative interpretation of several clinicians. However, these approaches remain computationally heavy. We propose MedSegLatDiff, a diffusion based framework that combines a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a latent diffusion model for efficient medical image segmentation. The VAE compresses the input into a low dimensional latent space, reducing noise and accelerating training, while the diffusion process operates directly in this compact representation. We further replace the conventional MSE loss with weighted cross entropy in the VAE mask reconstruction path to better preserve tiny structures such as small nodules. MedSegLatDiff is evaluated on ISIC-2018 (skin lesions), CVC-Clinic (polyps), and LIDC-IDRI (lung nodules). It achieves state of the art or highly competitive Dice and IoU scores while simultaneously generating diverse segmentation hypotheses and confidence maps. This provides enhanced interpretability and reliability compared to deterministic baselines, making the model particularly suitable for clinical deployment.",
