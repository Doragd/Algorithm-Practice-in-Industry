Navigating the equilibrium between accuracy and online retrieval’s speed requirement proves challenging, particularly when limited data links the failed mentions to resolved entities. In this paper, we propose a entity reference expansion system, injecting pairs of failed mentions and resolved entity names into the knowledge graph, enhancing its awareness of unresolved mentions. To address data scarcity, we introduce a synthetic data generation approach aligned with noise patterns. This, combined with an ASR-Error-Aware Loss function, facilitates the training of a RoBERTa model, which filters failed mentions and extracts entity pairs for knowledge graph expansion. These designs confront obstacles related to ASR noise, data limitations, and online entity retrieval. | Jiangning Chen, Ziyun Zhang, Qianli Hu |  |

Current solutions rely on public datasets to develop prompts or fine-tune a Natural Language Inference (NLI) model. However, these approaches are not focused on developing an enterprise RAG system; they do not consider latency, train or evaluate on production data, nor do they handle non-verifiable statements such as small talk or questions. To address this, we leverage the customer service conversation data of four large brands to evaluate existing solutions and propose a set of small encoder models trained on a new dataset. We find the proposed models to outperform existing methods and highlight the value of combining a small amount of in-domain data with public datasets. | Ilana Zimmerman, Jadin Tredup, Ethan Selfridge, Joseph Bradley |  |

Their ability of synthesizing program targeting a pre-defined algorithmic coding task has been intensively tested and verified on datasets including HumanEval and MBPP. Yet, evaluation of these LLMs from more perspectives (than just program synthesis) is also anticipated, considering their broad scope of applications. In this paper, we explore their ability of automatic test cases generation. We show intriguing observations and reveal how the quality of their generated test cases can be improved. Following recent work which uses generated test cases to enhance program synthesis, we further leverage our findings in improving the quality of the synthesized programs and show +11.77% and +4.22% higher code pass rates on HumanEval+ comparing with the GPT-3.5-turbo baseline and the recent state-of-the-art, respectively. Our code is publicly available at... | Weimin Xiong, Yiwen Guo, Hao Chen |  |

However, crafting effective prompts that guide LLMs to generate summaries with the appropriate level of detail and writing style remains a challenge. In this paper, we explore the use of salient information extracted from the source document to enhance summarization prompts. We show that adding keyphrases in prompts can improve ROUGE F1 and recall, making the generated summaries more similar to the reference and more complete. The number of keyphrases can control the precision-recall trade-off. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that incorporating phrase-level salient information is superior to word- or sentence-level. However, the impact on summary faithfulness is not universally positive across LLMs. To enable this approach, we introduce Keyphrase Signal Extractor (SigExt), a lightweight model that can be finetuned to... | Lei Xu, Mohammed Asad Karim, Saket Dingliwal, Aparna Elangovan |  |
| 6 |  |  [Predicting Entity Salience in Extremely Short Documents](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-industry.5) |  | 0 | A frequent challenge in applications that use entities extracted from text documents is selecting the most salient entities when only a small number can be used by the application (e.g., displayed to a user). Solving this challenge is particularly difficult in the setting of extremely short documents, such as the response from a digital assistant, where traditional signals of salience such as position and frequency are less likely to be useful. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and data-efficient approach for entity salience detection on short text documents. Our experiments show that our approach achieves competitive performance with respect to complex state-of-the-art models, such as GPT-4, at a significant advantage in latency and cost. In limited data settings, we show that a semi-supervised fine-tuning process can improve performance further. Furthermore, we introduce a novel human-labeled dataset for evaluating entity salience on short question-answer pair documents. | Benjamin L. Bullough, Harrison Lundberg, Chen Hu, Weihang Xiao |  |

Abrupt shifts in topics can lead to poor user experiences and inefficient utilization of computational resources. In this paper, we present a topic continuity model aimed at assessing whether a response aligns with the initial conversation topic. Our model is built upon the expansion of the corresponding natural language understanding (NLU) model into quantifiable terms using a Naive Bayes approach. Subsequently, we have introduced an attention mechanism and logarithmic nonlinearity to enhance its capability to capture topic continuity. This approach allows us to convert the NLU model into an interpretable analytical formula. In contrast to many NLU models constrained by token limits, our proposed model can seamlessly handle conversations of any length with linear time complexity. Furthermore, the attention mechanism significantly improves the... | ShuTing Pi, Pradeep Bagavan, Yejia Li, Disha Disha, Qun Liu |  |

We seek to address this challenge via Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). On this approach, product names are retrieved from a catalog and incorporated into the context used by a large language model (LLM) that has been fine-tuned to do contextual spelling correction. Through quantitative evaluation and qualitative error analyses, we find improvements in spelling correction utilizing the RAG framework beyond a stand-alone LLM. We also demonstrate the value of additional finetuning of the LLM to incorporate retrieved context. | Xuan Guo, Rohit Patki, Dante Everaert, Christopher Potts |  |
| 9 |  |  [Scaling Parameter-Constrained Language Models with Quality Data](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-industry.8) |  | 0 | Scaling laws in language modeling traditionally quantify training loss as a function of dataset size and model parameters, providing compute-optimal estimates but often neglecting the impact of data quality on model generalization.In this paper, we extend the conventional understanding of scaling law by offering a microscopic view of data quality within the original formulation – effective training tokens – which we posit to be a critical determinant of performance for parameter-constrained language models.Specifically, we formulate the proposed term of effective training tokens to be a combination of two readily-computed indicators of text:(i) text diversity and (ii) syntheticity as measured by a teacher model.We pretrained over 200 models of 25M to 1.5B parameters on a diverse set of sampled, synthetic data, and estimated the constants that relate text quality, model size, training tokens, and eight reasoning task accuracy scores.We demonstrated the estimated constants yield +0.83... | Ernie Chang, Matteo Paltenghi, Yang Li, PinJie Lin, Changsheng Zhao, Patrick Huber, Zechun Liu, Rastislav Rabatin, Yangyang Shi, Vikas Chandra |  |
| 10 |  |  [INDUS: Effective and Efficient Language Models for Scientific Applications](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-industry.9) |  | 0 | Large language models (LLMs) trained on general domain corpora showed remarkable results on natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, previous research demonstrated LLMs trained using domain-focused corpora perform better on specialized tasks. Inspired by this insight, we developed INDUS, a comprehensive suite of LLMs tailored for the closely-related domains of Earth science, biology, physics, heliophysics, planetary sciences and astrophysics, and trained using curated scientific corpora drawn from diverse data sources. The suite of models include: (1) an encoder model trained using domain-specific vocabulary and corpora to address NLP tasks, (2) a contrastive-learning based text embedding model trained using a diverse set of datasets to address information retrieval tasks and (3) smaller versions of these models created using knowledge distillation for applications which have latency or resource constraints. We also created three new scientific benchmark datasets,... | Bishwaranjan Bhattacharjee, Aashka Trivedi, Masayasu Muraoka, Muthukumaran Ramasubramanian, Takuma Udagawa, Iksha Gurung, Nishan Pantha, Rong Zhang, Bharath Dandala, Rahul Ramachandran, Manil Maskey, Kaylin M.

Post-training Quantization (PTQ) is a popular technique, but it often faces challenges at low-bit levels, particularly in downstream tasks. Quantization-aware Training (QAT) can alleviate this problem, but it requires significantly more computational resources. To tackle this, we introduced Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Quantization-Aware Training (DL-QAT), which merges the advantages of QAT while training only less than 1% of the total parameters. Specifically, we introduce a group-specific quantization magnitude to adjust the overall scale of each quantization group. Within each quantization group, we use LoRA matrices to update the weight size and direction in the quantization space. We validated the effectiveness of our method on the LLaMA and LLaMA2 model families. The results show significant improvements over our baseline method across different quantization granularities.

However, the computational demands for these models pose a challenge when applying them to real-time tasks, such as composition assistance. To address this, we propose Hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Composition Assistance (Hybrid-RACA), a novel system for real-time text prediction that efficiently combines a cloud-based LLM with a smaller client-side model through retrieval augmented memory. This integration enables the client model to generate better responses, benefiting from the LLM’s capabilities and cloud-based data. Meanwhile, via a novel asynchronous memory update mechanism, the client model can deliver real-time completions to user inputs without the need to wait for responses from the cloud. Our experiments on five datasets demonstrate that Hybrid-RACA offers strong performance while maintaining low latency. | Menglin Xia, Xuchao Zhang, Camille Couturier, Guoqing Zheng, Saravan Rajmohan, Victor Rühle |  |

However, the substantial computational and memory requirements limit the widespread adoption. Quantization, a key compression technique, can effectively mitigate these demands by compressing and accelerating LLMs, albeit with potential risks to accuracy. Numerous studies have aimed to minimize the accuracy loss associated with quantization. However, their quantization configurations vary from each other and cannot be fairly compared. In this paper, we present LLMC, a plug-and-play compression toolkit, to fairly and systematically explore the impact of quantization. LLMC integrates dozens of algorithms, models, and hardware, offering high extensibility from integer to floating-point quantization, from LLM to vision-language (VLM) model, from fixed-bit to mixed precision, and from quantization to sparsification.... | Ruihao Gong, Yang Yong, Shiqiao Gu, Yushi Huang, Chengtao Lv, Yunchen Zhang, Dacheng Tao, Xianglong Liu |  |

To overcome this issue, most existing works focus on retrieving the relevant context from the document, representing them as plain text. However, documents such as PDFs, web pages, and presentations are naturally structured with different pages, tables, sections, and so on. Representing such structured documents as plain text is incongruous with the user’s mental model of these documents with rich structure. When a system has to query the document for context, this incongruity is brought to the fore, and seemingly trivial questions can trip up the QA system. To bridge this fundamental gap in handling structured documents, we propose an approach called PDFTriage that enables models to retrieve the context based on either structure or content. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed... | Jon SaadFalcon, Joe Barrow, Alexa F. Siu, Ani Nenkova, Seunghyun Yoon, Ryan A. Rossi, Franck Dernoncourt |  |

However, obtaining precisely labeled data for training remains challenging, particularly because not all problematic instances are reported. Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning, which uses only labeled positive and unlabeled samples, offers a solution for these scenarios. A significant concern in PU learning, especially in online settings, is fairness: specific groups may be disproportionately classified as problematic. Despite its importance, this issue has not been explicitly addressed in research. This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the fairness of PU learning in both offline and online settings. We propose a novel approach to achieve more equitable results by extending PU learning methods to online learning for both linear and non-linear classifiers and analyzing the impact of the online setting on fairness. Our... | Hoin Jung, Xiaoqian Wang |  |

We focus on integrating the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and the Program-of-Thought (PoT) learning, hypothesizing that prioritizing the learning of mathematical reasoning ability is helpful for the amplification of problem-solving ability. Thus, the initial learning with CoT is essential for solving challenging mathematical problems. To this end, we propose a sequential learning approach, named SAAS (Solving Ability Amplification Strategy), which strategically transitions from CoT learning to PoT learning. Our empirical study, involving an extensive performance comparison using several benchmarks, demonstrates that our SAAS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. The results underscore the effectiveness of our sequential learning approach, marking a significant advancement in the field of mathematical reasoning in LLMs. | Hyeonwoo Kim, Gyoungjin Gim, Yungi Kim, Jihoo Kim, Byungju Kim, Wonseok Lee, Chanjun Park |  |
| 17 |  |  [Debiasing Text Safety Classifiers through a Fairness-Aware Ensemble](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-industry.16) |  | 0 | Increasing use of large language models (LLMs) demand performant guardrails to ensure the safety of inputs and outputs of LLMs. When these safeguards are trained on imbalanced data, they can learn the societal biases. We present a light-weight, post-processing method for mitigating counterfactual fairness in closed-source text safety classifiers. Our approach involves building an ensemble that not only outperforms the input classifiers and policy-aligns them, but also acts as a debiasing regularizer. We introduce two threshold-agnostic metrics to assess the counterfactual fairness of a model, and demonstrate how combining these metrics with Fair Data Reweighting (FDW) helps mitigate biases. We create an expanded Open AI dataset, and a new templated LLM-generated dataset based on user-prompts, both of which are counterfactually balanced across identity groups and cover four key areas of safety; we will work towards publicly releasing these datasets. Our results show that our approach... | Olivia Sturman, Aparna Joshi, Bhaktipriya Radharapu, Piyush Kumar, Renee Shelby |  |
| 18 |  |  [Centrality-aware Product Retrieval and Ranking](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-industry.17) |  | 0 | This paper addresses the challenge of improving user experience on e-commerce platforms by enhancing product ranking relevant to user’s search queries. Ambiguity and complexity of user queries often lead to a mismatch between user’s intent and retrieved product titles or documents. Recent approaches have proposed the use of Transformer-based models which need millions of annotated query-title pairs during the pre-training stage, and this data often does not take user intent into account. To tackle this, we curate samples from existing datasets at eBay, manually annotated with buyer-centric relevance scores, and centrality scores which reflect how well the product title matches the user’s intent. We introduce a User-intent Centrality Optimization (UCO) approach for existing models, which optimizes for the user intent in semantic product search. To that end, we propose a dual-loss based optimization to handle hard negatives, i.e., product titles that are semantically relevant but do not... | Hadeel Saadany, Swapnil Bhosale, Samarth Agrawal, Diptesh Kanojia, Constantin Orasan, Zhe Wu |  |
| 19 |  |  [Fusion-Eval: Integrating Assistant Evaluators with LLMs](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-industry.18) |  | 0 | Evaluating natural language generation (NLG) systems automatically poses significant challenges.Recent studies have employed large language models (LLMs) as reference-free metrics for NLG evaluation, enhancing adaptability to new tasks tasks. However, these methods still show lower correspondence with human judgments compared to specialized neural evaluators.In this paper, we introduce “Fusion-Eval”, an innovative approach that leverages LLMs to integrate insights from various assistant evaluators. The LLM is given the example to evaluate along with scores from the assistant evaluators. Each of these evaluators specializes in assessing distinct aspects of responses.Fusion-Eval achieves a 0.962 system-level Kendall-Tau correlation with humans on SummEval and a 0.744 turn-level Spearman correlation on TopicalChat, which is significantly higher than baseline methods. These results highlight Fusion-Eval’s significant potential in the realm of natural language system evaluation. | Lei Shu, Nevan Wichers, Liangchen Luo, Yun Zhu, Yinxiao Liu, Jindong Chen, Lei Meng |  |

Using the Big Five personality traits model, we evaluate how stable assigned personalities are for Quantized Role-Playing Dialog Agents (QRPDA) during multi-turn interactions. We evaluate multiple LLMs with various quantization levels, combining binary indexing of personality traits, explicit self-assessments, and linguistic analysis of narratives. To address personality inconsistency, we propose a non-parametric method called Think2. Our multi-faceted evaluation framework demonstrates Think2’s effectiveness in maintaining consistent personality traits for QRPDA. Moreover, we offer insights to help select the optimal model for QRPDA, improving its stability and reliability in real-world applications. | Yixiao Wang, Homa Fashandi, Kevin Ferreira |  |
| 21 |  |  [Robust ASR Error Correction with Conservative Data Filtering](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-industry.20) |  | 0 | Error correction (EC) based on large language models is an emerging technology to enhance the performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems.Generally, training data for EC are collected by automatically pairing a large set of ASR hypotheses (as sources) and their gold references (as targets).However, the quality of such pairs is not guaranteed, and we observed various types of noise which can make the EC models brittle, e.g. inducing overcorrection in out-of-domain (OOD) settings.In this work, we propose two fundamental criteria that EC training data should satisfy: namely, EC targets should (1) improve linguistic acceptability over sources and (2) be inferable from the available context (e.g. source phonemes).Through these criteria, we identify low-quality EC pairs and train the models not to make any correction in such cases, the process we refer to as conservative data filtering.In our experiments, we focus on Japanese ASR using a strong Conformer-CTC as the baseline... | Takuma Udagawa, Masayuki Suzuki, Masayasu Muraoka, Gakuto Kurata |  |
| 22 |  |  [Code Representation Pre-training with Complements from Program Executions](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-industry.21) |  | 0 | Language models for natural language processing have been grafted onto programming language modeling for advancing code intelligence. Although it can be represented in the text format, code is syntactically more rigorous, as it is designed to be properly compiled or interpreted to perform a set of behaviors given any inputs. In this case, existing works benefit from syntactic representations to learn from code less ambiguously in forms of abstract syntax tree, control-flow graph, etc. However, programs with the same purpose can be implemented in various ways showing different syntactic representations, while the ones with similar implementations can have distinct behaviors. Though trivially demonstrated during executions, such semantics about functionality are challenging to be learned directly from code, especially in an unsupervised manner. Hence, in this paper, we propose FuzzPretrain to explore the dynamic information of programs revealed by their test cases and embed it into the... | Jiabo Huang, Jianyu Zhao, Yuyang Rong, Yiwen Guo, Yifeng He, Hao Chen |  |

Most current research focuses on optimizing individual sub-procedures, e.g. local inference and communication, however, there is no comprehensive framework that provides a holistic system view for optimizing LLM serving in an end-to-end manner. In this work, we conduct a detailed analysis to identify major bottlenecks that impact end-to-end latency in LLM serving systems. Our analysis reveals that a comprehensive LLM serving endpoint must address a series of efficiency bottlenecks that extend beyond LLM inference. We then propose ScaleLLM, an optimized system for resource-efficient LLM serving. Our extensive experiments reveal that reveal that with 64 concurrent requests on Mixtral 8x7B, ScaleLLM achieves a 4.3× speed up over vLLM and outperforms state-of-the-arts with 1.5× higher throughput. | Yuhang Yao, Han Jin, Alay Dilipbhai Shah, Shanshan Han, Zijian Hu, Dimitris Stripelis, Yide Ran, Zhaozhuo Xu, Salman Avestimehr, Chaoyang He |  |
| 24 |  |  [Context Matters: Pushing the Boundaries of Open-Ended Answer Generation with Graph-Structured Knowledge Context](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-industry.23) |  | 0 | This paper introduces a novel framework that combines graph-driven context retrieval in conjunction to knowledge graphs based enhancement, honing the proficiency of LLMs, especially in domain specific community question answering platforms like AskUbuntu, Unix, and ServerFault. We conduct experiments on various LLMs with different parameter sizes to evaluate their ability to ground knowledge and determine factual accuracy in answers to open-ended questions. Our methodology GraphContextGen consistently outperforms dominant text-based retrieval systems, demonstrating its robustness and adaptability to a larger number of use cases. This advancement highlights the importance of pairing context rich data retrieval with LLMs, offering a renewed approach to knowledge sourcing and generation in AI systems. We also show that, due to rich contextual data retrieval, the crucial entities, along with the generated answer, remain factually coherent with the gold answer. We shall release the source... | Somnath Banerjee, Amruit Sahoo, Sayan Layek, Avik Dutta, Rima Hazra, Animesh Mukherjee |  |

We present SHIELD (Schema-based Hierarchical Induction for EV supply chain Disruption), a system integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with domain expertise for EV battery supply chain risk assessment. SHIELD combines: (1) LLM-driven schema learning to construct a comprehensive knowledge library, (2) a disruption analysis system utilizing fine-tuned language models for event extraction, multi-dimensional similarity matching for schema matching, and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) with logical constraints for prediction, and (3) an interactive interface for visualizing results and incorporating expert feedback to enhance decision-making. Evaluated on 12,070 paragraphs from 365 sources (2022-2023), SHIELD outperforms baseline GCNs and LLM+prompt methods (e.g. GPT-4o) in disruption prediction. These results demonstrate SHIELD’s effectiveness in combining LLM... | ZhiQi Cheng, Yifei Dong, Aike Shi, Wei Liu, Yuzhi Hu, Jason O'Connor, Alexander G. Hauptmann, Kate Whitefoot |  |

We propose , an automated framework for evaluating and improving the consistency of LLM-generated texts using a divide-conquer-reasoning approach. Unlike existing LLM-based evaluators operating at the paragraph level, our method employs a divide-and-conquer evaluator () that breaks down the paragraph-to-paragraph comparison into sentence-to-paragraph comparisons. To facilitate this approach, we also introduce an automatic metric converter () that translates the output from into an interpretable numeric score. Beyond the consistency evaluation, we further present a reason-assisted improver () that mitigates inconsistencies by leveraging the analytical reasons identified by . Through comprehensive and systematic empirical analysis, we show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (e.g., +16.8% and... | Wendi Cui, Zhuohang Li, Damien Lopez, Kamalika Das, Bradley A.

Yet, few text embeddings specialized for finance have been reported in the literature, perhaps in part due to a lack of public datasets and benchmarks. We present BAM embeddings, a set of text embeddings finetuned on a carefully constructed dataset of 14.3M query-passage pairs including both public and proprietary financial documents. Demonstrating the benefits of domain-specific training, BAM embeddings achieve Recall@1 of 62.8% on a held-out test set, vs. only 39.2% for the best general-purpose text embedding from OpenAI. Further, BAM embeddings increase question answering accuracy by 8% on FinanceBench and show increased sensitivity to the finance-specific elements that are found in detailed, forward-looking and company and date-specific queries. To support further research we describe our approach in detail, quantify the... | Peter Anderson, Mano Vikash Janardhanan, Jason He, Wei Cheng, Charlie Flanagan |  |

However, real-world industrial systems present prevalent challenges in task planning and tool usage: numerous APIs in the real system make it intricate to invoke the appropriate one, while the inherent limitations of LLMs pose challenges in orchestrating an accurate sub-task sequence and API-calling order. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework aimed at enhancing the Task Planning and Tool Usage (TPTU) abilities of LLM-based agents in industry. Our framework comprises three key components designed to address these challenges: (1) the API Retriever selects the most pertinent APIs among the extensive API set; (2) the Demo Selector retrieves task-level demonstrations, which is further used for in-context learning to aid LLMs in accurately decomposing subtasks and effectively invoking... | Yilun Kong, Jingqing Ruan, Yihong Chen, Bin Zhang, Tianpeng Bao, Shiwei Shi, Du Qing, Xiaoru Hu, Hangyu Mao, Ziyue Li, Xingyu Zeng, Rui Zhao, Xueqian Wang |  |
| 29 |  |  [Detecting Ambiguous Utterances in an Intelligent Assistant](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-industry.28) |  | 0 | In intelligent assistants that perform both chatting and tasks through dialogue, like Siri and Alexa, users often make ambiguous utterances such as “I’m hungry” or “I have a headache,” which can be interpreted as either chat or task intents. Naively determining these intents can lead to mismatched responses, spoiling the user experience. Therefore, it is desirable to determine the ambiguity of user utterances. We created a dataset from an actual intelligent assistant via crowdsourcing and analyzed tendencies of ambiguous utterances. Using this labeled data of chat, task, and ambiguous intents, we developed a supervised intent classification model.

Indian addresses with their diverse languages, scripts, and formats present significant challenges that existing geocoding methods often fail to address, particularly at fine-grained resolutions. In this paper, we propose GeoIndia, a novel geocoding system designed specifically for Indian addresses using hierarchical H3-cell prediction within a Seq2Seq framework. Our methodology includes a comprehensive analysis of Indian addressing systems, leading to the development of a data correction strategy that enhances prediction accuracy. We investigate two model architectures, Flan-T5-base (T5) and Llama-3-8b (QLF-Llama-3), due to their strong sequence generation capabilities.

However, such string-based descriptors implicitly contain limited structural information, which is closely associated with molecular property prediction. In this work, we introduce Moleco, a novel contrastive learning framework to enhance the understanding of molecular structures within CLMs. Based on the similarity of fingerprint vectors among different molecules, we train CLMs to distinguish structurally similar and dissimilar molecules in a contrastive manner. Experimental results demonstrate that Moleco significantly improves the molecular property prediction performance of CLMs, outperforming state-of-the-art models. Moreover, our in-depth analysis with diverse Moleco variants verifies that fingerprint vectors are highly effective features in improving CLMs’ understanding of the... | JunHyung Park, Hyuntae Park, Yeachan Kim, Woosang Lim, SangKeun Lee |  |

However, due to the vast space of materials, datasets in this field are typically scarce and have limited coverage. This inherent limitation makes current adaptation methods less effective when adapting pre-trained language models (PLMs) to materials science, as these methods rely heavily on the frequency information from limited downstream datasets. In this paper, we propose Semantic Knowledge Transfer (SEED), a novel vocabulary expansion method to adapt the pre-trained language models for materials science. The core strategy of SEED is to transfer the materials knowledge of lightweight embeddings into the PLMs. To this end, we introduce knowledge bridge networks, which learn to transfer the latent knowledge of the materials embeddings into ones compatible with PLMs. By expanding the embedding layer of PLMs with these transformed embeddings, PLMs can comprehensively understand the... | Yeachan Kim, JunHyung Park, SungHo Kim, Juhyeong Park, Sangyun Kim, SangKeun Lee |  |

Traditionally, this involves the periodic assessment of news regarding client companies to identify events which can impact their financial standing. This process can prove arduous and delay a timely response to credit impacting events. The News Risk Alerting System (NRAS) proactively identifies credit-relevant news related to clients and alerts the relevant Credit Officer (CO). This production system has been deployed for nearly three years and has alerted COs to over 2700 credit-relevant events with an estimated precision of 77%. | Adil Nygaard, Ashish Upadhyay, Lauren Hinkle, Xenia Skotti, Joe Halliwell, Ian Brown, Glen Noronha |  |

Unlike other modalities such as vision or text, speech has unique temporal dependencies, making previous efficient inference works on other modalities not directly applicable. Furthermore, methods for efficient SpeechLM inference on long sequence and sparse signals remain largely unexplored. In this work, we propose FastAdaSP, a weighted token merging framework specifically designed for various speech-related tasks to improve the trade-off between efficiency and performance. Experimental results on WavLLM and Qwen-Audio show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) efficiency-performance trade-off compared with other baseline methods. Specifically, FastAdaSP achieved 7x memory efficiency and 1.83x decoding throughput without any degradation on tasks like Emotion Recognition (ER) and Spoken Question Answering (SQA). | Yichen Lu, Jiaqi Song, ChaoHan Huck Yang, Shinji Watanabe |  |

This proliferation has highlighted the need for quick, high-quality, and cost-effective LLM query response methods. Yet, no single LLM exists to efficiently balance this trilemma. Some models are powerful but extremely costly, while others are fast and inexpensive but qualitatively inferior. To address this challenge, we present TO-Router, a non-monolithic LLM querying system that seamlessly integrates various LLM experts into a single query interface and dynamically routes incoming queries to the most high-performant expert based on query’s requirements. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that when compared to standalone expert models, TO-Router improves query efficiency by up to 40%, and leads to significant cost reductions of up to 30%, while maintaining or enhancing model performance by up to 10%. | Dimitris Stripelis, Zhaozhuo Xu, Zijian Hu, Alay Dilipbhai Shah, Han Jin, Yuhang Yao, Jipeng Zhang, Tong Zhang, Salman Avestimehr, Chaoyang He |  |

Existing methods for HTC fall within two categories, local methods (a classifier for each level, node, or parent) or global methods (a single classifier for everything). Local methods are computationally expensive, whereas global methods often require complex explicit injection of the hierarchy, verbalizers, and/or prompt engineering. In this work, we propose Prompt Tuned Multi Task Taxonomic Transformer, a single classifier that uses a multi-task objective to predict one or more topics. The approach is capable of understanding the hierarchy during training without explicit injection, complex heads, verbalizers, or prompt engineering. PTMTTaxoFormer is a novel model architecture and training paradigm using differentiable prompts and labels that are learnt through backpropagation.

One emerging area of focus is customizing these models to cater to individual user preferences, thereby shaping them into personal LLM agents. This work investigates how the user model, which encapsulates user-related information, preferences, and personal concepts, influences an LLM agent’s planning and reasoning capabilities. We introduce a personalized version of TravelPlanner, called TravelPlanner+, and establish baselines for personal LLM agents. Our evaluation strategy contains an LLM-as-a-Judge component, which provides further in-depth insights into the decision-making process of a personal LLM agent by comparing generic and personal plans.

However, LoRA and its existing variants introduce significant latency in multi-tenant settings, hindering their applications in the industry. To address this issue, we propose the Fantastic LoRA (FanLoRA) framework, which consists of four steps: (a) adding LoRA modules to all the Transformer linear weights and fine-tuning on a large-scale instruction tuning dataset. (b) The importance of each module is then assessed using a novel importance scoring method. (c) only the most critical modules per layer are retained, resulting in the FanLoRA setting. (d) The FanLoRA setting is applied to fine-tune various downstream tasks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that: (a) FanLoRA outperforms existing PEFT baselines across a wide collection of tasks with comparable tunable parameters.

Motivated by a necessity for human quality control of these systems, we introduce ReportGPT: a pipeline framework for verifiable human-in-the-loop table-to-text generation. ReportGPT is based on a domain specific language, which acts as a proof mechanism for generating verifiable commentary. This allows users to quickly check the relevancy and factuality of model outputs. User selections then become few-shot examples for improving the performance of the pipeline. We configure 3 approaches to our pipeline, and find that usage of language models in ReportGPT’s components trade off precision for more insightful downstream commentary. Furthermore, ReportGPT learns from human feedback in real-time, needing only a few samples to improve performance. | Lucas Cecchi, Petr Babkin |  |

Recent advancements in text-video retrieval have focused on cross-modal interactions, large-scale foundation model training, and probabilistic modeling, yet often neglect the crucial user perspective, leading to discrepancies between user queries and the content retrieved. To address this, we introduce MERLIN (Multimodal Embedding Refinement via LLM-based Iterative Navigation), a novel, training-free pipeline that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for iterative feedback learning. MERLIN refines query embeddings from a user perspective, enhancing alignment between queries and video content through a dynamic question answering process. Experimental results on datasets like MSR-VTT, MSVD, and ActivityNet demonstrate that MERLIN substantially improves Recall@1, outperforming existing systems and confirming the benefits of integrating LLMs into... | Donghoon Han, Eunhwan Park, Gisang Lee, Adam Lee, Nojun Kwak |  |

We consider the task of identifying High Consideration (HC) queries. Identifying such queries enables e-commerce sites to better serve user needs using targeted experiences such as curated QA widgets that help users reach purchase decisions. We explore the task by proposing an Engagement-based Query Ranking (EQR) approach, focusing on query ranking to indicate potential engagement levels with query-related shopping knowledge content during product search. Unlike previous studies on predicting trends, EQR prioritizes query-level features related to customer behavior, finance, and catalog information rather than popularity signals. We introduce an accurate and scalable method for EQR and present experimental results demonstrating its effectiveness. Offline experiments show strong ranking performance.

Reviews on platforms such as Google Play and Apple App Store provide valuable insights to developers, highlighting bugs, suggesting new features, and offering feedback. However, many reviews contain typos, spelling errors, grammar mistakes, and complex sentences, hindering efficient interpretation and slowing down app improvement processes. To tackle this, we introduce RARE (Repository for App review REfinement), a benchmark dataset of 10,000 annotated pairs of original and refined reviews from 10 mobile applications. These reviews were collaboratively refined by humans and large language models (LLMs). We also conducted an evaluation of eight state-of-the-art LLMs for automated review refinement. The top-performing model (Flan-T5) was further used to refine an additional 10,000 reviews, contributing to RARE as a silver corpus. | Amrita Singh, Chirag Jain, Mohit Chaudhary, Preethu Anish |  |

Notably, methods like TIGER, which employ Residual Quantization-based Semantic Identifiers (RQ-SID), have shown significant promise in e-commerce scenarios by effectively managing item IDs. However, a critical issue termed the "Hourglass" phenomenon, occurs in RQ-SID, where intermediate codebook tokens become overly concentrated, hindering the full utilization of generative retrieval methods. This paper analyses and addresses this problem by identifying data sparsity and long-tailed distribution as the primary causes. Through comprehensive experiments and detailed ablation studies, we analyze the impact of these factors on codebook utilization and data distribution.

Most previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches use pre-trained language models (PLMs) for cross-domain NER. However, these models are often domain specific. To successfully use these models for new target domains, we need to modify either the model architecture or perform model fine-tuning using data from the new domains. Both of these result in the creation of entirely new NER models for each target domain which is infeasible for practical scenarios. Recently, several works have attempted to use LLMs to solve Few-Shot Cross-Domain NER. However, most of these are either too expensive for practical purposes or struggle to follow LLM prompt instructions.

While the quantized version of the Low-Rank Adaptation technique, named QLoRA, significantly alleviates this issue, finding the efficient LoRA rank is still challenging. Moreover, QLoRA is trained on a pre-defined rank and, therefore, cannot be reconfigured for its lower ranks without requiring further fine-tuning steps. This paper proposes QDyLoRA -Quantized Dynamic Low-Rank Adaptation-, as an efficient quantization approach for dynamic low-rank adaptation. Motivated by Dynamic LoRA, QDyLoRA is able to efficiently finetune LLMs on a set of pre-defined LoRA ranks. QDyLoRA enables fine-tuning Falcon-40b for ranks 1 to 64 on a single 32 GB V100-GPU through one round of fine-tuning. Experimental results show that QDyLoRA is competitive to QLoRA and outperforms when employing its optimal rank. | Hossein Rajabzadeh, Mojtaba Valipour, Tianshu Zhu, Marzieh S.

This paper introduces a new and straightforward PEFT technique, termed Prompt Aware Representation Adjustment (PARA). The core of our proposal is to integrate a lightweight vector generator within each Transformer layer. This generator produces vectors that are responsive to input prompts, thereby adjusting the hidden representations accordingly. Our extensive experimentation across diverse tasks has yielded promising results.

One source of the powerful capabilities of LLMs is the massive scale of their pre-training dataset. However, these pre-training datasets contain many outdated, harmful, and personally sensitive information, which inevitably becomes memorized by LLM during the pre-training process. Eliminating this undesirable data is crucial for ensuring the model’s safety and enhancing the user experience. However, the cost of extensively cleaning the pre-training dataset and retraining the model from scratch is very high. In this work, we propose ULMR , a unlearning framework for LLMs , which first uses carefully designed prompts to rewrite the instructions in the specified dataset, and generate corresponding negative responses. Subsequently, to ensure... | Shaojie Shi, Xiaoyu Tan, Xihe Qiu, Chao Qu, Kexin Nie, Yuan Cheng, Wei Chu, Yinghui Xu, Yuan Qi |  |

Address matching and building authoritative address catalogues are important to many applications and businesses, such as delivery services, online retail, emergency services, logistics, etc. We propose to view a collection of addresses as an address graph and curate inputs for language models by placing geospatially linked addresses in the same context. Our approach jointly integrates concepts from graph theory and weak supervision with address text and geospatial semantics. This integration enables us to generate informative and diverse address pairs, facilitating pretraining and fine-tuning in a self-supervised manner. Experiments and ablation studies on manually curated datasets and comparisons with state-of-the-art techniques demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. We achieve a 24.49% improvement in recall while... | Saket Maheshwary, Arpan Paul, Saurabh Sohoney |  |

However, LLMs’ self-awareness and self-control capability in appropriately using tools remains understudied. The problem is consequential as it alarms a potential risk of degraded performance and poses a threat to trustworthiness on the models. In this paper, we conduct a study on a family of state-of-the-art LLMs on three datasets with two mainstream tool-use frameworks. Our study reveals the tool-abuse behavior of LLMs, a tendency for models to misuse tools along with models’ frequent overconfidence in tool choice. We also find that this is a common issue regardless of model capability. Accordingly, we propose a novel framework, SMARTCAL, to mitigate the observed issues, and our results show an average 8.6 percent increase in the QA performance in three testing datasets and 21.6 percent lower Expected Calibration Error (ECE) than existing methods. | Yuanhao Shen, Xiaodan Zhu, Lei Chen |  |

In this paper, we investigate the application of LMs to the specialized task of contact-center Quality Assurance (QA), which involves evaluating conversations between human agents and customers. This task requires both sophisticated linguistic understanding and deep domain knowledge. We conduct a comprehensive assessment of eight LMs, revealing that larger models, such as Claude-3.5-Sonnet, exhibit superior performance in comprehending contact-center conversations. We introduce methodologies to transfer this domain-specific knowledge to smaller models by leveraging evaluation plans generated by more knowledgeable models, with optional human-in-the-loop refinement to enhance the capabilities of smaller models. Notably, our experimental results demonstrate an improvement of up to 18.95% in Macro F1 on an... | Digvijay Ingle, Aashraya Sachdeva, Surya Prakash Sahu, Mayank Sati, Cijo George, Jithendra Vepa |  |

The facets of the object (attributes, fields, columns, properties) can be a mix of short, structured facts, or long natural-language descriptions. The object has to be self-consistent between the different facets in the redundant information it carries (relative consistency), while being grounded with respect to world knowledge (absolute consistency). We frame the problem as a Language Modeling problem (Structured Object Language Modeling) and train an LLM to perform the task natively, without requiring instructions or prompt-engineering. We propose a self-supervised denoising method to train the model from an existing dataset of such objects. The input query can be the existing object itself, in which case the system acts as a regenerator, completing, correcting, normalizing the input, or any... | Amir Tavanaei, Kee Kiat Koo, Hayreddin Çeker, Shaobai Jiang, Qi Li, Julien Han, Karim Bouyarmane |  |

We present our journey and rationale in assisting experts to answer queries about Breastfeeding and Maternity topics from users, mainly mothers. We started by developing a RAG approach to response generation where the generated response is made available to the expert who has the option to draft an answer using the generated text or to answer from scratch. This was the start of an ongoing effort to develop a pipeline of AI/NLP-based functionalities to help experts understand user queries and craft their responses. | Nadjet BouayadAgha, Ignasi GómezSebastià, Alba PadróArocas, Enric Roura, David Castelló, Rocío Tovar |  |

DP-Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (DP-FTRL) algorithms, leveraging correlated noise mechanisms such as tree aggregation or matrix factorization, are widely used in practice for their superior privacy-utility trade-off and compatibility with FL systems. This paper presents a novel variant of DP-FTRL by adapting the recent theoretical advancements of the Buffered Linear Toeplitz (BLT) mechanism to multi-participant scenarios. In the FL setting, our BLT mechanism demonstrates enhanced privacy-utility trade-off and improved memory efficiency than the widely used tree aggregation mechanism. Moreover, BLT achieves comparable privacy and utility to the state-of-the-art banded matrix factorization mechanism, while significantly simplifying usage requirements and reducing memory.

ProConSuL builds a call graph to provide the context from callees and uses a two-phase training method (SFT + preference alignment) to train the model to use the project context. We also provide a new evaluation benchmark for C/C++ functions and a set of proxy metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that ProConSuL allows to significantly improve code summaries and reduce the number of hallucinations compared to the base model (CodeLlama-7B-instruct).

A Comprehensive Study and Hybrid Approach](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-industry.66) |  | 0 | Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has been a powerful tool for Large Language Models (LLMs) to efficiently process overly lengthy contexts. However, recent LLMs like Gemini-1.5 and GPT-4 show exceptional capabilities to understand long contexts directly. We conduct a comprehensive comparison between RAG and long-context (LC) LLMs, aiming to leverage the strengths of both. We benchmark RAG and LC across various public datasets using three latest LLMs. Results reveal that when resourced sufficiently, LC consistently outperforms RAG in terms of average performance. However, RAG’s significantly lower cost remains a distinct advantage. Based on this observation, we propose Self-Route, a simple yet effective method that routes queries to RAG or LC based on model self-reflection. Self-Route significantly reduces the computation cost while maintaining a comparable performance to LC. Our findings provide a guideline for long-context applications of LLMs using RAG and LC. | Zhuowan Li, Cheng Li, Mingyang Zhang, Qiaozhu Mei, Michael Bendersky |  |

One of the most accurate approaches for out-of-scope (OOS) rejection is to combine it with the task of intent classification on in-scope queries, and to use methods based on the similarity of embeddings produced by transformer-based sentence encoders. Typically, such encoders are fine-tuned for the intent-classification task, using cross-entropy loss. Recent work has shown that while this produces suitable embeddings for the intent-classification task, it also tends to disperse in-scope embeddings over the full sentence embedding space. This causes the in-scope embeddings to potentially overlap with OOS embeddings, thereby making OOS rejection difficult. This is compounded when OOS data is unknown. To mitigate this issue our work proposes to regularize the cross-entropy loss with an in-scope embedding reconstruction loss learned using an auto-encoder.

Although various detecting methods have been proposed, most of them have not been evaluated on or optimized for real-world samples from LLM-assisted cheating, where the generated text is often copy-typed imperfectly by the test-taker. In this paper, we present a framework for training LLM-generated text detectors that can effectively detect LLM-generated samples after being copy-typed. We enhance the existing transformer-based classifier training process with contrastive learning on constructed pairwise data and self-training on unlabeled data, and evaluate the improvements on a real-world dataset from the Duolingo English Test (DET), a high-stakes online English proficiency test. Our experiments demonstrate that the improved model outperforms the original transformer-based classifier and other baselines. | Chenhao Niu, Kevin P.

Numerous approaches revolve around data pre-processing and subsequent fine-tuning of language models, tasks that can be both time-consuming and computationally demanding. As alternatives, machine unlearning techniques are being explored, yet there is a notable lack of comparative studies evaluating the effectiveness of these methods. In this work, we explore the effectiveness of two machine unlearning methods: Partitioned Contrastive Gradient Unlearning (PCGU) applied on decoder models, and Negation via Task Vector, and compare them with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to reduce social biases in open-source LMs such as LLaMA-2 and OPT. We also implement distributed PCGU for large models. It is empirically shown, through quantitative and qualitative analyses, that negation via Task Vector method outperforms PCGU and is... | Omkar Dige, Diljot Arneja, Tsz Fung Yau, Qixuan Zhang, Mohammad Bolandraftar, Xiaodan Zhu, Faiza Khan Khattak |  |

Recognizing Healthcare Advice in Large Language Models](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-industry.72) |  | 0 | Large language models (LLMs) have seen increasing popularity in daily use, with their widespread adoption by many corporations as virtual assistants, chatbots, predictors, and many more. Their growing influence raises the need for safeguards and guardrails to ensure that the outputs from LLMs do not mislead or harm users. This is especially true for highly regulated domains such as healthcare, where misleading advice may influence users to unknowingly commit malpractice. Despite this vulnerability, the majority of guardrail benchmarking datasets do not focus enough on medical advice specifically. In this paper, we present the HeAL benchmark (HEalth Advice in LLMs), a health-advice benchmark dataset that has been manually curated and annotated to evaluate LLMs’ capability in recognizing health-advice - which we use to safeguard LLMs deployed in industrial settings. We use HeAL to assess several models and report a detailed analysis of the findings. | Kellen Cheng, Anna Lisa Gentile, Pengyuan Li, Chad DeLuca, GuangJie Ren |  |

Despite its widespread adoption, the absence of large-scale, realistic datasets has hindered advancements in QAC system development. This paper addresses this gap by introducing AmazonQAC, a new QAC dataset sourced from Amazon Search logs, comprising 395M samples. The dataset includes actual sequences of user-typed prefixes leading to final search terms, as well as session IDs and timestamps that support modeling the context-dependent aspects of QAC. We assess Prefix Trees, semantic retrieval, and Large Language Models (LLMs) with and without finetuning. We find that finetuned LLMs perform best, particularly when incorporating contextual information. However, even our best system achieves only half of what we calculate is theoretically possible on our test data, which implies QAC is a challenging problem that is far from solved... | Dante Everaert, Rohit Patki, Tianqi Zheng, Christopher Potts |  |

Currently, this alignment process relies on the availability of high-quality supervised and preference data, which can be both time-consuming and expensive to curate or annotate. In this paper, we introduce a systematic end-to-end methodology for aligning LLMs to the implicit and explicit values represented in unstructured text data. Our proposed approach leverages the use of scalable synthetic data generation techniques to effectively align the model to the values present in the unstructured data. Through two distinct use-cases, we demonstrate the efficiency of our methodology on the Mistral-7B-Instruct model. Our approach credibly aligns LLMs to the values embedded within documents, and shows improved performance against other approaches, as quantified through the use of automatic metrics and win rates. | Inkit Padhi, Karthikeyan Natesan Ramamurthy, Prasanna Sattigeri, Manish Nagireddy, Pierre L.

This paper introduces LARA, a Linguistic-Adaptive Retrieval-Augmentation framework to enhance accuracy in multi-turn classification tasks across six languages, accommodating numerous intents in chatbot interactions. LARA combines a fine-tuned smaller model with a retrieval-augmented mechanism, integrated within the architecture of LLMs. The integration allows LARA to dynamically utilize past dialogues and relevant intents, thereby improving the understanding of the context. Furthermore, our adaptive retrieval techniques bolster the cross-lingual capabilities of LLMs without extensive retraining and fine-tuning. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LARA achieves state-of-the-art performance on multi-turn intent classification tasks, enhancing the average accuracy by 3.67% from state-of-the-art single-turn intent classifiers. | Junhua Liu, Tan Yong Keat, Fu Bin, Kwan Hui Lim |  |

The descriptions can match the driver’s query about the icon appearing on the dashboard and tell the driver what is happening so that they may take an appropriate action. We use three state-of-the-art large vision-language models to generate both visual and functional descriptions based on the icon image and its context information in the car manual. Both zero-shot and few-shot prompts are used. We create a dataset containing over 400 icons with their ground-truth descriptions and use it to evaluate model-generated descriptions across several performance metrics. Our evaluation shows that two of these models (GPT-4o and Claude 3.5) performed well on this task, while the third model (LLaVA-NEXT) performs poorly. | James Fletcher, Nicholas Dehnen, Seyed Nima Tayarani Bathaie, Aijun An, Heidar Davoudi, Ron DiCarlantonio, Gary Farmaner |  |

As the capabilities of the agents expand, ensuring their safety and trustworthiness becomes more imperative. In this study, we introduce the Athena framework which leverages the concept of verbal contrastive learning where past safe and unsafe trajectories are used as in-context (contrastive) examples to guide the agent towards safety while fulfilling a given task. The framework also incorporates a critiquing mechanism to guide the agent to prevent risky actions at every step.

To fulfill LLMs’ potential as autonomous agents, they must be able to identify, call, and interact with a variety of external tools and application program interfaces (APIs). This capability of LLMs, commonly termed function calling, leads to a myriad of advantages such as access to current and domain-specific information in databases and the outsourcing of tasks that can be reliably performed by tools. In this work, we introduce Granite-20B-FunctionCalling, a model trained using a multi-task training approach on seven fundamental tasks encompassed in function calling.

When using Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task, a new call to the LLM inference endpoint/API is required for each new query even if the context stays the same. However, repeated calls to the LLM inference endpoints would significantly increase the costs of using them in production, making LLMs impractical for many real-world use cases. To address this problem, in this paper, we investigate whether combining the queries for the same input context in a single prompt to minimize repeated calls can be successfully used in meeting summarization. In this regard, we conduct extensive experiments by comparing the performance of various popular LLMs: GPT-4, Gemini, Claude-3, LLaMA2, Mistral, Phi-3, and Qwen-2 in single-query and multi-query settings. We observe that the capability to reliably generate the response in the... | Md. Tahmid Rahman Laskar, Elena Khasanova, XueYong Fu, Cheng Chen, Shashi Bhushan TN |  |

While the QAC systems in eCommerce stores generally use the Learning to Rank (LTR) approach optimized based on customer feedback, it struggles to provide diverse suggestions, leading to repetitive queries and limited navigational suggestions related to product categories, attributes, and brands. This paper proposes a novel DiAL framework that explicitly optimizes for diversity alongside customer feedback signals. It achieves this by leveraging a smooth approximation of the diversity-based metric (𝛼NDCG) as a listwise loss function and modifying it to balance relevance and diversity. The proposed approach yielded an improvement of 8.5% in mean reciprocal rank (MRR) and 22.8% in 𝛼NDCG compared to the pairwise ranking approach on an eCommerce dataset, while meeting the ultra-low latency constraints... | Sonali Singh, Sachin Farfade, Prakash Mandayam Comar |  |

However, this ability of LC LLMs to reliably utilize their growing context windows remains under investigation. In this work, we evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art GPT-4 suite of LC LLMs in solving a series of progressively challenging tasks, as a function of factors such as context length, task difficulty, and position of key information by creating a real world financial news dataset. Our findings indicate that LC LLMs exhibit brittleness at longer context lengths even for simple tasks, with performance deteriorating sharply as task complexity increases. At longer context lengths, these state-of-the-art models experience catastrophic failures in instruction following resulting in degenerate outputs. Our prompt ablations also reveal unfortunate continued sensitivity to both the placement of the task... | Lavanya Gupta, Saket Sharma, Yiyun Zhao |  |

While large language models (LLMs) have enabled the automated generation of financial market analysis text, they still face issues such as hallucinations, errors in financial knowledge, and insufficient capability to reason about complex financial problems, which limits the quality of the generation. To tackle these shortcomings, we propose a novel task and a retrieval-augmented framework grounded in a financial knowledge graph (FKG). The proposed framework is compatible with commonly used instruction-tuning methods. Experiments demonstrate that our framework, coupled with a small-scale language model fine-tuned with instructions, can significantly enhance the logical consistency and quality of the generated analysis texts, outperforming both large-scale language models and other retrieval-augmented baselines. | Yuemin Chen, Feifan Wu, Jingwei Wang, Hao Qian, Ziqi Liu, Zhiqiang Zhang, Jun Zhou, Meng Wang |  |

A Study On The Impact Of Format Restrictions On Large Language Model Performance](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-industry.91) |  | 0 | Structured generation, the process of producing content in standardized formats like JSON and XML, is widely utilized in real-world applications to extract key output information from large language models (LLMs).This study investigates whether such constraints on generation space impact LLMs’ abilities, including reasoning and domain knowledge comprehension. Specifically, we evaluate LLMs’ performance when restricted to adhere to structured formats versus generating free-form responses across various common tasks. Surprisingly, we observe a significant decline in LLMs’ reasoning abilities under format restrictions. Furthermore, we find that stricter format constraints generally lead to greater performance degradation in reasoning tasks. | Zhi Rui Tam, ChengKuang Wu, YiLin Tsai, ChiehYen Lin, Hungyi Lee, YunNung Chen |  |

Meanwhile, state-of-the-art machine translation techniques have demonstrated great success in building context-aware representations that generalize well to new languages with minimal training data. In this work, we propose modeling the schema matching problem as a neural machine translation task: given product context and an attribute-value pair from a source schema, the model predicts the corresponding attribute, if available, in the target schema. We utilize open-source seq2seq models, such as mT5 and mBART, fine-tuned on product attribute mappings to build a scalable schema matching framework.

The language FST is currently an N-gram language model (LM). However, N-gram LMs, limited in context length, are known to have sparsity problem under device model size constraint. In this paper, we propose Neural Search Space which substitutes the N-gram LM with a Neural Network LM (NN-LM) and dynamically constructs the search space during decoding. Specifically, we integrate the long range context awareness of NN-LM into the search space by converting its outputs given context, into the language FST at runtime. This involves language FST structure redesign, pruning strategies tuning, and data structure optimizations.

Leakage of system prompts may compromise intellectual property, and act as adversarial reconnaissance for an attacker. A systematic evaluation of prompt leakage threats and mitigation strategies is lacking, especially for multi-turn LLM interactions. In this paper, we systematically investigate LLM vulnerabilities against prompt leakage for 10 closed- and open-source LLMs, across four domains. We design a unique threat model which leverages the LLM sycophancy effect and elevates the average attack success rate (ASR) from 17.7% to 86.2% in a multi-turn setting. Our standardized setup further allows dissecting leakage of specific prompt contents such as task instructions and knowledge documents. We measure the mitigation effect of 7 black-box defense strategies, along with finetuning an open-source model to defend against leakage attempts.

While recommendation systems have been widely studied, most are designed for general e-commerce problems and struggle with the unique challenges of the fashion domain. To address these issues, we propose a sequential fashion recommendation framework that leverages a pre-trained large language model (LLM) enhanced with recommendation-specific prompts. Our framework employs parameter-efficient fine-tuning with extensive fashion data and introduces a novel mix-up-based retrieval technique for translating text into relevant product suggestions. Extensive experiments show our proposed framework significantly enhances fashion recommendation performance. | Han Liu, Xianfeng Tang, Tianlang Chen, Jiapeng Liu, Indu Indu, Henry Peng Zou, Peng Dai, Roberto F.

Given a context and putative output, we compute a factuality score that can be thresholded to yield a binary decision to check the results of LLM-based question-answering, summarization, or other systems. Unlike factuality checkers that themselves rely on LLMs, we use compact, open-source natural language inference (NLI) models that yield a freely accessible solution with low latency and low cost at run-time, and no need for LLM fine-tuning. The approach also enables downstream mitigation and correction of hallucinations, by tracing them back to specific context chunks. Our experiments show high ROC-AUC across a wide range of relevant open source datasets, indicating the effectiveness of our method for fact-checking RAG output. | Hithesh Sankararaman, Mohammed Yasin, Tanner Sorensen, Alessandro Di Bari, Andreas Stolcke |  |

However, internalizing such safeguard features into larger models brought challenges of higher training cost and unintended degradation of helpfulness. In this paper, we leverage a smaller LLM for both harmful query detection and safeguard response generation.

In particular, the proposed system is powerful on extracting them from Tables and Lists, and provides a new framework for automate query generation and knowledge-snippet extraction based on a QA-pair filtering procedure including the snippet refinement and verification processes, which enhance the quality of generated query-knowledge snippet pairs. As a result, 53.8% of the generated knowledge-snippets includes complex HTML structures such as tables and lists in our experiments of a real-world environments, and 66.5% of the knowledge-snippets are evaluated as valid. | Dooyoung Kim, Yoonjin Jang, Dongwook Shin, Chanhoon Park, Youngjoong Ko |  |

Another crucial aspect of our system is the LLM, which utilizes contextual information from a web search API to generate responses. This results in substantial 92.8% boost in the usefulness of voice-based responses. \*\*EARS\*\* is language-agnostic and can be applied to any data domain. | Nikita Krayko, Ivan Sidorov, Fedor Laputin, Daria Galimzianova, Vasily Konovalov |  |

However, crafting complex GraphQL query operations can be challenging. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer an alternative by generating GraphQL queries from natural language, but they struggle due to limited exposure to publicly available GraphQL schemas, often resulting in invalid or suboptimal queries. Furthermore, no benchmark test data suite is available to reliably evaluate the performance of contemporary LLMs.To address this, we present a large-scale, cross-domain Text-to-GraphQL query operation dataset. The dataset includes 10,940 training triples spanning 185 cross-source data stores and 957 test triples over 14 data stores. Each triple consists of a GraphQL schema, GraphQL query operation, and corresponding natural language query. The dataset has been predominantly manually created, with natural language... | Manish Kesarwani, Sambit Ghosh, Nitin Gupta, Shramona Chakraborty, Renuka Sindhgatta, Sameep Mehta, Carlos Eberhardt, Dan Debrunner |  |

Despite its success, most of the current structure designs face the challenge that the experts share the same size such that tokens have no chance to choose the experts with the most appropriate size to generate the next token. To migrate this defect, we propose Mixture of Diverse Size Experts (MoDSE), a new MoE architecture with designed layers where experts have different sizes. Analysis on difficult token generation tasks shows that experts with different sizes give better predictions, and the routing path of the experts tends to be stable after a period of training. The diversity of experts’ size will lead to load unbalancing. To tackle this limitation, we introduce an expert-pair allocation strategy to distribute the workload evenly across the GPUs.

This paper systematically evaluates and enhances LLMs’ capability to perform course-correction, , the model can steer away from generating harmful content autonomously. First, we introduce the C2-Eval benchmark for quantitative assessment and analyze 10 popular LLMs, revealing varying proficiency of current safety-tuned LLMs in course-correction.To improve, we propose fine-tuning LLMs with preference learning, emphasizing the preference for timely course-correction. Using an automated pipeline, we create C2-Syn, a synthetic C2-Syn with 750K pairwise preferences, to teach models the concept of timely course-correction through data-driven learning.Experiments on Llama2-Chat 7B and Qwen2 7B show that our method effectively enhances course-correction skills without affecting general performance. Additionally, it effectively improves LLMs’ safety, particularly in resisting jailbreak attacks. | Rongwu Xu, Yishuo Cai, Zhenhong Zhou, Renjie Gu, Haiqin Weng, Liu Yan, Tianwei Zhang, Wei Xu, Han Qiu |  |

However, for practical deployment, it is crucial to perform knowledge distillation to maintain high performance while operating under computational constraints. In this paper, we address a key question: given the importance of unsupervised distillation for student model performance, how can knowledge from multiple teacher models be effectively ensemble during this stage without the guidance of labels? We propose a novel algorithm, GOVERN, to tackle this issue. GOVERN has demonstrated significant improvements in both offline and online experiments, enabling the student model to achieve results comparable to that of teacher ensembles. Our experiments show that GOVERN remarkably requires a mere 1% of the ensemble method’s inference budget to achieve 99.5% of performance. The proposed algorithm has been successfully deployed in a real-world commercial... | Wenjie Zhou, Zhenxin Ding, Xiaodong Zhang, Haibo Shi, Junfeng Wang, Dawei Yin |  |

In this paper, we address this limitation by introducing PRISM, a simple yet highly effective method that extends CLIP’s capability to grasp the nuances of precise colors. PRISM seamlessly adapts to both recognized HTML colors and out-of-vocabulary RGB inputs through the utilization of our curated dataset of 100 image-text pairs, which can be effortlessly repurposed for fine-tuning with any desired color. Importantly, PRISM achieves these enhancements without compromising CLIP’s performance on established benchmarks. Furthermore, we introduce a novel evaluation framework, ColorLens, featuring both seen and unseen test sets that can be readily repurposed to assess a model’s precision in understanding precise colors.

Recent studies have suggested that PLMs be used as dataset generators and a tiny task-specific model be trained to achieve efficient inference. However, their applicability to various domains is limited because they tend to generate domain-specific datasets. In this work, we propose a novel approach to universal domain generalization that generates a dataset regardless of the target domain. This allows for generalization of the tiny task model to any domain that shares the label space, thus enhancing the real-world applicability of the dataset generation paradigm. Our experiments indicate that the proposed method accomplishes generalizability across various domains while using a parameter set that is orders of magnitude smaller than PLMs. | Juhwan Choi, Yeonghwa Kim, Seunguk Yu, Jungmin Yun, Youngbin Kim |  |

However, datasets often contain noisy data inadvertently included during the construction process. Numerous attempts have been made to correct this issue through human annotators. However, hiring and managing human annotators is expensive and time-consuming. As an alternative, recent studies are exploring the use of large language models (LLMs) for data annotation.In this study, we present a case study that extends the application of LLM-based data annotation to enhance the quality of existing datasets through a cleansing strategy. Specifically, we leverage approaches such as chain-of-thought and majority voting to imitate human annotation and classify unrelated documents from the Multi-News dataset, which is widely used for the multi-document summarization task. Through our proposed cleansing method, we introduce an enhanced Multi-News+. By employing LLMs for data... | Juhwan Choi, Jungmin Yun, Kyohoon Jin, Youngbin Kim |  |

Simultaneously, a considerable number of novel methods for evaluating factual consistency in abstractive summarization systems has been developed. But these evaluation approaches incorporate substantial limitations, especially on refinement and interpretability. In this work, we propose highly effective and interpretable factual inconsistency detection method FIZZ (Factual Inconsistency Detection by Zoom-in Summary and Zoom-out Document) for abstractive summarization systems that is based on fine-grained atomic facts decomposition. Moreover, we align atomic facts decomposed from the summary with the source document through adaptive granularity expansion. These atomic facts represent a more fine-grained unit of information, facilitating detailed understanding and interpretability of the summary’s factual inconsistency.

We call these prompts “evil twins” because they are obfuscated and uninterpretable (evil), but at the same time mimic the functionality of the original natural-language prompts (twins). Remarkably, evil twins transfer between models. We find these prompts by solving a maximum-likelihood problem which has applications of independent interest. | Rimon Melamed, Lucas H.

TableQA research has focused primarily on high-resource languages, leaving medium- and low-resource languages with little progress due to scarcity of annotated data and neural models. We address this gap by introducing a fully automatic large-scale tableQA data generation process for low-resource languages with limited budget. We incorporate our data generation method on two Indic languages, Bengali and Hindi, which have no tableQA datasets or models. TableQA models trained on our large-scale datasets outperform state-of-the-art LLMs. We further study the trained models on different aspects, including mathematical reasoning capabilities and zero-shot cross-lingual transfer. Our work is the first on low-resource tableQA focusing on scalable data generation and evaluation procedures.

Trained on short web-scraped image-text, vision-language models often generate incomplete descriptions with visual inconsistencies. We address this via a novel data-centric approach with ImageInWords (IIW), a carefully designed human-in-the-loop framework for curating hyper-detailed image descriptions. Human evaluations on IIW data show major gains compared to recent datasets (+66%) and GPT-4V (+48%) across comprehensiveness, specificity, hallucinations, and more. We also show that fine-tuning with IIW data improves these metrics by +31% against models trained with prior work, even with only 9k samples. Lastly, we evaluate IIW models with text-to-image generation and vision-language reasoning tasks. Our generated descriptions result in the highest fidelity images, and boost compositional reasoning by up to 6% on ARO, SVO-Probes, and Winoground... | Roopal Garg, Andrea Burns, Burcu Karagol Ayan, Yonatan Bitton, Ceslee Montgomery, Yasumasa Onoe, Andrew Bunner, Ranjay Krishna, Jason Baldridge, Radu Soricut |  |

Using Avalon as a testbed, we employ system prompts to guide LLM agents in gameplay. While previous studies have touched on gameplay with LLM agents, research on their social behaviors is lacking. We propose a novel framework, tailored for Avalon, features a multi-agent system facilitating efficient communication and interaction. We evaluate its performance based on game success and analyze LLM agents’ social behaviors. Results affirm the framework’s effectiveness in creating adaptive agents and suggest LLM-based agents’ potential in navigating dynamic social interactions. By examining collaboration and confrontation behaviors, we offer insights into this field’s research and applications. | Yihuai Lan, Zhiqiang Hu, Lei Wang, Yang Wang, Deheng Ye, Peilin Zhao, EePeng Lim, Hui Xiong, Hao Wang |  |

Among various AI technologies, Large Language Models (LLMs) stand out for their versatility in healthcare applications. However, the application of LLMs in the identification and analysis of depressive states remains relatively unexplored, presenting an intriguing avenue for future research. In this paper, we present an innovative approach to employ an LLM in the realm of depression detection, integrating acoustic speech information into the LLM framework for this specific application. We investigate an efficient method for automatic depression detection by integrating speech signals into LLMs utilizing Acoustic Landmarks. This approach is not only valuable for the detection of depression but also represents a new perspective in enhancing the ability of LLMs to comprehend and process speech signals. By incorporating acoustic landmarks, which are specific to the... | Xiangyu Zhang, Hexin Liu, Kaishuai Xu, Qiquan Zhang, Daijiao Liu, Beena Ahmed, Julien Epps |  |

However, in the field of speech synthesis, although DDPMs exhibit impressive performance, their prolonged training duration and substantial inference costs hinder practical deployment. Existing approaches primarily focus on enhancing inference speed, while approaches to accelerate training—a key factor in the costs associated with adding or customizing voices—often necessitate complex modifications to the model, compromising their universal applicability. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose an inquiry: is it possible to enhance the training/inference speed and performance of DDPMs by modifying the speech signal itself? In this paper, we double the training and inference speed of Speech DDPMs by simply redirecting the generative target to the wavelet domain. This method not only achieves comparable or superior performance to the... | Xiangyu Zhang, Daijiao Liu, Hexin Liu, Qiquan Zhang, Hanyu Meng, Leibny Paola GarcíaPerera, Engsiong Chng, Lina Yao |  |

This is significant, as terms used to convey hate often involve non-standard or novel usages which might be overlooked by commonly leveraged LMs trained on general language use. In this paper, we introduce the Hateful Word in Context Classification (HateWiC) task and present a dataset of ~4000 WiC-instances, each labeled by three annotators. Our analyses and computational exploration focus on the interplay between the subjective nature (context-dependent connotations) and the descriptive nature (as described in dictionary definitions) of hateful word senses. HateWiC annotations confirm that hatefulness of a word in context does not always derive from the sense definition alone. We explore the prediction of both majority and individual annotator labels, and we experiment with modeling context- and sense-based inputs. Our findings indicate that including definitions proves... | Sanne Hoeken, Sina Zarrieß, Özge Alaçam |  |

In this paper, we present a dataset (GAZE4HATE) that provides gaze data collected in a hate speech annotation experiment. We study whether the gaze of an annotator provides predictors of their subjective hatefulness rating, and how gaze features can improve Hate Speech Detection (HSD). We conduct experiments on statistical modeling of subjective hate ratings and gaze and analyze to what extent rationales derived from hate speech models correspond to human gaze and explanations in our data. Finally, we introduce MEANION, a first gaze-integrated HSD model. Our experiments show that particular gaze features like dwell time or fixation counts systematically correlate with annotators’ subjective hate ratings and improve predictions of text-only hate speech models. | Özge Alaçam, Sanne Hoeken, Sina Zarrieß |  |

We hypothesize that this limitation can be partially attributed to non-intuitive textual numbers representation. When a digit is read or generated by a causal language model it does not know its place value (e.g. thousands vs. hundreds) until the entire number is processed. To address this issue, we propose a simple adjustment to how numbers are represented by including the count of digits before each number. For instance, instead of “42”, we suggest using “2:42” as the new format. This approach, which we term NumeroLogic, offers an added advantage in number generation by serving as a Chain of Thought (CoT). By requiring the model to consider the number of digits first, it enhances the reasoning process before generating the actual number. We use arithmetic tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness of the NumeroLogic formatting. We further demonstrate NumeroLogic applicability to general natural... | Eli Schwartz, Leshem Choshen, Joseph Shtok, Sivan Doveh, Leonid Karlinsky, Assaf Arbelle |  |

In this study, we examine whether structured prompting techniques can offer opportunities for fair text generation. We evaluate a comprehensive end-user-focused iterative framework of debiasing that applies System 2 thinking processes for prompts to induce logical, reflective, and critical text generation, with single, multi-step, instruction, and role-based variants. By systematically evaluating many LLMs across many datasets and different prompting strategies, we show that the more complex System 2-based Implicative Prompts significantly improve over other techniques demonstrating lower mean bias in the outputs with competitive performance on the downstream tasks.

Despite its essential role in product recommendation and business user profiling analysis, intent understanding has not been consistently defined or accurately benchmarked. In this paper, we focus on predicative user intents as “how a customer uses a product”, and pose intent understanding as a natural language reasoning task, independent of product ontologies. We identify two weaknesses of FolkScope, the SOTA E-Commerce Intent Knowledge Graph: category-rigidity and property-ambiguity. They limit its ability to strongly align user intents with products having the most desirable property, and to recommend useful products across diverse categories. Following these observations, we introduce a Product Recovery Benchmark featuring a novel evaluation framework and an example dataset. We further validate the above FolkScope weaknesses on this benchmark. Our code and dataset are available at... | Wendi Zhou, Tianyi Li, Pavlos Vougiouklis, Mark Steedman, Jeff Z. Pan |  |

Comparing Knowledge Injection in LLMs](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.15) |  | 0 | Large language models (LLMs) encapsulate a vast amount of factual information within their pre-trained weights, as evidenced by their ability to answer diverse questions across different domains. However, this knowledge is inherently limited, relying heavily on the characteristics of the training data. Consequently, using external datasets to incorporate new information or refine the capabilities of LLMs on previously seen information poses a significant challenge. In this study, we compare two common approaches: unsupervised fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We evaluate both approaches on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks across different topics. Our findings reveal that while unsupervised fine-tuning offers some improvement, RAG consistently outperforms it, both for existing knowledge encountered during training and entirely new knowledge. Moreover, we find that LLMs struggle to learn new factual information through unsupervised fine-tuning, and that... | Oded Ovadia, Menachem Brief, Moshik Mishaeli, Oren Elisha |  |

Current research suggests that LLM-based agents become increasingly human-like in their performance, sparking interest in using these AI agents as substitutes for human participants in behavioral studies. However, LLMs are complex statistical learners without straightforward deductive rules, making them prone to unexpected behaviors. Hence, it is crucial to study and pinpoint the key behavioral distinctions between humans and LLM-based agents. In this study, we highlight the limitations of LLMs in simulating human interactions, particularly focusing on LLMs’ ability to simulate political debates on topics that are important aspects of people’s day-to-day lives and decision-making processes. Our findings indicate a tendency for LLM agents to conform to the model’s inherent social biases despite being directed to... | Amir Taubenfeld, Yaniv Dover, Roi Reichart, Ariel Goldstein |  |

Thus, it is important to address potential biases and inequities that may arise from the design or use of these resources. Crowd-sourced sign language datasets, such as the ASL Citizen dataset, are great resources for improving accessibility and preserving linguistic diversity, but they must be used thoughtfully to avoid reinforcing existing biases.In this work, we utilize the rich information about participant demographics and lexical features present in the ASL Citizen dataset to study and document the biases that may result from models trained on crowd-sourced sign datasets. Further, we apply several bias mitigation techniques during model training, and find that these techniques reduce performance disparities without decreasing accuracy. With the publication of this work, we release the demographic information about the participants in the ASL Citizen dataset... | Katherine Atwell, Danielle Bragg, Malihe Alikhani |  |

However, as LMs often generate incorrect or hallucinated responses, it is crucial to correctly quantify their uncertainty in responding to given inputs. In addition to verbalized confidence elicited via prompting, many uncertainty measures (e.g., semantic entropy and affinity-graph-based measures) have been proposed. However, these measures can differ greatly, and it is unclear how to compare them, partly because they take values over different ranges (e.g., [0,∞) or [0,1]). In this work, we address this issue by developing a novel and practical framework, termed \*Rank-Calibration\*, to assess uncertainty and confidence measures for LMs. Our key tenet is that higher uncertainty (or lower confidence) should imply lower generation quality, on average. Rank-calibration quantifies deviations from this ideal relationship in a principled manner, without requiring ad hoc binary thresholding of the... | Xinmeng Huang, Shuo Li, Mengxin Yu, Matteo Sesia, Hamed Hassani, Insup Lee, Osbert Bastani, Edgar Dobriban |  |

Current research predominantly emphasizes LLMs’ capacity to utilize tools in well-structured environments while overlooking their stability when confronted with the inevitable noise of the real world. To bridge this gap, we introduce \*RoTBench\*, a multi-level benchmark for evaluating the robustness of LLMs in tool learning. Specifically, we establish five external environments, each featuring varying levels of noise (i.e., Clean, Slight, Medium, Heavy, and Union), providing an in-depth analysis of the model’s resilience across three critical phases: tool selection, parameter identification, and content filling. Experiments involving six widely-used models underscore the urgent necessity for enhancing the robustness of LLMs in tool learning. For instance, the performance of GPT-4 even drops significantly from 80.00 to 58.10 when there is no... | Junjie Ye, Yilong Wu, Songyang Gao, Caishuang Huang, Sixian Li, Guanyu Li, Xiaoran Fan, Qi Zhang, Tao Gui, Xuanjing Huang |  |

However, recent studies have raised concerns regarding the hallucination and flaws in their reasoning process. Substantial efforts are being made to improve the reliability and faithfulness of the generated rationales. Some approaches model reasoning as planning, while others focus on annotating for process supervision. Nevertheless, the planning-based search process often results in high latency due to the frequent assessment of intermediate reasoning states and the extensive exploration space. Additionally, supervising the reasoning process with human annotation is costly and challenging to scale for LLM training. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a framework to learn planning-based reasoning through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on collected trajectories, which are ranked according to synthesized process rewards.... | Fangkai Jiao, Chengwei Qin, Zhengyuan Liu, Nancy F.

Despite significant advances, our current models exhibit weak syntax and semantic abilities. However, if the scaling properties of neural language models hold for the speech modality, these abilities will improve as the amount of compute used for training increases. In this paper, we use models of this scaling behavior to estimate the scale at which our current methods will yield a SLM with the English proficiency of text-based Large Language Models (LLMs). We establish a strong correlation between pre-training loss and downstream syntactic and semantic performance in SLMs and LLMs, which results in predictable scaling of linguistic performance. We show that the linguistic performance of SLMs scales up to three orders of magnitude more slowly than that of text-based LLMs. Additionally, we study the benefits of synthetic data designed to boost semantic understanding and the effects of coarser... | Santiago Cuervo, Ricard Marxer |  |

For example, the phrase thoughts and prayers, is used to express sympathy for mass shooting victims, as well as satirically criticize the lack of legislative action on gun control. Understanding such discourse fully by reading only the text is difficult. However, knowledge of the social context information makes it easier. We characterize the social context required to fully understand such ambiguous discourse, by grounding the text in real-world entities, actions, and attitudes. We propose two datasets that require understanding social context and benchmark them using large pre-trained language models and several novel structured models. We show that structured models, explicitly modeling social context, outperform larger models on both tasks, but still lag significantly behind human performance. Finally, we perform an extensive analysis, to obtain further insights into the language... | Rajkumar Pujari, Chengfei Wu, Dan Goldwasser |  |

This often generates monetary value for the inventors and organizations. However, the factors that influence a patent receiving high citations over the year are still not well understood. With the patents over the past two decades, we study the problem of patent citation prediction and formulate this as a binary classification problem. We create a semantic graph of patents based on their semantic similarities, enabling the use of Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approaches for predicting citations. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our GNN-based methods when applied to the semantic graph, showing that they can accurately predict patent citations using only patent text. More specifically, these methods produce up to 94% recall for patents with high citations and outperform existing baselines. Furthermore, we leverage this constructed graph to gain insights and explanations for the predictions made... | Rabindra Nath Nandi, Suman Kalyan Maity, Brian Uzzi, Sourav Medya |  |

In the current practice of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for translation, we revisit the importance of these factors. We find that LLMs display strong translation capability after being fine-tuned on as few as 32 parallel sentences and that fine-tuning on a single translation direction enables translation in multiple directions. However, the choice of direction is critical: fine-tuning LLMs with only English on the target side can lead to task misinterpretation, which hinders translation into non-English languages. Problems also arise when noisy synthetic data is placed on the target side, especially when the target language is well-represented in LLM pre-training. Yet interestingly, synthesized data in an under-represented language has a less pronounced effect.

Previous work has found that directly asking about relevancy, such as "\*How relevant is document A to query Q?\*”, results in suboptimal ranking. Instead, the pairwise-ranking prompting (PRP) approach produces promising ranking performance through asking about pairwise comparisons, e.g., "\*Is document A more relevant than document B to query Q?\*”. Thus, while LLMs are effective at their ranking ability, this is not reflected in their relevance label generation.In this work, we propose a post-processing method to consolidate the relevance labels generated by an LLM with its powerful ranking abilities. Our method takes both LLM generated relevance labels and pairwise preferences. The labels are then altered to satisfy the pairwise preferences of the LLM, while staying as close to the original values as possible. Our experimental results indicate... | Le Yan, Zhen Qin, Honglei Zhuang, Rolf Jagerman, Xuanhui Wang, Michael Bendersky, Harrie Oosterhuis |  |

Improving Strategy Planning for Non-collaborative Dialogues via Diversified User Simulation](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.26) |  | 0 | We investigate non-collaborative dialogue agents, which are expected to engage in strategic conversations with diverse users, for securing a mutual agreement that leans favorably towards the system’s objectives. This poses two main challenges for existing dialogue agents: 1) The inability to integrate user-specific characteristics into the strategic planning, and 2) The difficulty of training strategic planners that can be generalized to diverse users. To address these challenges, we propose TRIP to enhance the capability in tailored strategic planning, incorporating a user-aware strategic planning module and a population-based training paradigm. Through experiments on benchmark non-collaborative dialogue tasks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of TRIP in catering to diverse users. | Tong Zhang, Chen Huang, Yang Deng, Hongru Liang, Jia Liu, Zujie Wen, Wenqiang Lei, TatSeng Chua |  |

Assuming instructors have limited control over the industrial-strength models, this paper investigates the baseline performance of 5 widely used LLMs on a collection of introductory programming problems, examines adversarial perturbations to degrade their performance, and describes the results of a user study aimed at measuring the efficacy of such perturbations in hindering actual code generation for introductory programming assignments. The user study suggests that i) perturbations combinedly reduced the average correctness score by 77%, ii) the drop in correctness caused by these perturbations was affected based on their detectability. | Saiful Islam Salim, Rubin Yuchan Yang, Alexander Cooper, Suryashree Ray, Saumya Debray, Sazzadur Rahaman |  |

Given the significant resource allocation required by training and evaluating models, it is advantageous to have an efficient method for selecting high-quality IT data. However, existing methods for instruction data selection have limitations such as relying on fragile external APIs, being affected by biases in GPT models, or reducing the diversity of the selected instruction dataset. In this paper, we propose an industrial-friendly, expert-aligned and diversity-preserved instruction data selection method: Clustering and Ranking (CaR). CaR consists of two steps. The first step involves ranking instruction pairs using a scoring model that is well aligned with expert preferences (achieving an accuracy of 84.25%). The second step involves preserving dataset diversity through a clustering process. In our experiment, CaR selected a subset containing only 1.96% of Alpaca’s IT data,... | Yuan Ge, Yilun Liu, Chi Hu, Weibin Meng, Shimin Tao, Xiaofeng Zhao, Mahong Xia, Zhang Li, Boxing Chen, Hao Yang, Bei Li, Tong Xiao, JingBo Zhu |  |

We show that models are less likely to predict romantic relationships for (a) same-gender character pairs than different-gender pairs; and (b) intra/inter-racial character pairs involving Asian names as compared to Black, Hispanic, or White names. We examine the contextualized embeddings of first names and find that gender for Asian names is less discernible than non-Asian names. We discuss the social implications of our findings, underlining the need to prioritize the development of inclusive and equitable technology. | Abhilasha Sancheti, Haozhe An, Rachel Rudinger |  |

We apply this to two tasks: speech resynthesis and speech-to-speech translation. In both cases, the benchmark evaluates the ability of the model to encode emphasis in the speech input and accurately reproduce it in the output, potentially across a change of speaker and language. As part of the evaluation pipeline, we introduce EmphaClass, a new model that classifies emphasis at the frame or word level. | Maureen de Seyssel, Antony D'Avirro, Adina Williams, Emmanuel Dupoux |  |

Despite their superiority in capturing the lexical semantics between tokens for text analysis, our preliminary study on two popular LLMs, i.e., ChatGPT and Llama2, showcases that simply applying the news embeddings from LLMs is ineffective for fake news detection. Such embeddings only encapsulate the language styles between tokens. Meanwhile, the high-level semantics among named entities and topics, which reveal the deviating patterns of fake news, have been ignored. Therefore, we propose a topic model together with a set of specially designed prompts to extract topics and real entities from LLMs and model the relations among news, entities, and topics as a heterogeneous graph to facilitate investigating news semantics. We then propose a Generalized Page-Rank model and a consistent learning criteria for mining the local and global semantics centered on each news... | Xiaoxiao Ma, Yuchen Zhang, Kaize Ding, Jian Yang, Jia Wu, Hao Fan |  |

We propose and formalise a method to systematically investigate the effects of individual randomness factors while taking the interactions (dependence) between them into consideration. To this end, our method mitigates the effects of other factors while observing how the performance varies across multiple runs. Applying our method to multiple randomness factors across in-context learning and fine-tuning approaches on 7 representative text classification tasks and meta-learning on 3 tasks, we show that: 1) disregarding interactions between randomness factors in existing works led to inconsistent findings due to incorrect attribution of the effects of randomness factors, such as disproving the consistent sensitivity of... | Branislav Pecher, Ivan Srba, Mária Bieliková |  |

However, this capability introduces the risk of prompt injection attacks, where malicious instructions are embedded in the input to trigger unintended actions or content. Understanding the robustness of LLMs against such attacks is critical for ensuring their safe deployment. In this work, we establish a benchmark to evaluate the robustness of instruction-following LLMs against prompt injection attacks, assessing their ability to discern which instructions to follow and which to disregard. Through extensive experiments with leading instruction-following LLMs, we reveal significant vulnerabilities, particularly in models that mis-follow injected instructions. Our results show that certain models are excessively inclined to prioritize embedded instructions in prompts, often focusing on the latter parts of the prompt without fully... | Zekun Li, Baolin Peng, Pengcheng He, Xifeng Yan |  |

We create counterfactual examples with small perturbations on target-domain data instead of relying on templates or specific datasets for bias detection. On widely used classifiers for subjectivity analysis, including sentiment, emotion, hate speech, and offensive text using Twitter data, our results demonstrate positive biases related to the language spoken in a country across all classifiers studied. Notably, the presence of certain country names in a sentence can strongly influence predictions, up to a 23% change in hate speech detection and up to a 60% change in the prediction of negative emotions such as anger. We hypothesize that these biases stem from the training data of pre-trained language models (PLMs) and find correlations between affect predictions and PLMs likelihood in English and unknown languages like Basque and Maori, revealing distinct patterns with exacerbate... | Valentin Barrière, Sebastian Cifuentes |  |

To investigate alignment tax, we conducted experiments with existing RLHF algorithms using OpenLLaMA-3B, which revealed a pronounced alignment tax in NLP tasks. Whereas, despite various techniques to mitigate forgetting, they are often at odds with the RLHF performance, leading to a trade-off between alignment performance and forgetting mitigation, leading to an alignment-forgetting trade-off. In this paper we show that model averaging, which simply interpolates between pre and post RLHF model weights, surprisingly achieves the most strongest alignment-forgetting Pareto front among a wide range of competing methods. To understand its effectiveness, we offer theoretical insights into model averaging, revealing that it enhances performance Pareto front by increasing... | Yong Lin, Hangyu Lin, Wei Xiong, Shizhe Diao, Jianmeng Liu, Jipeng Zhang, Rui Pan, Haoxiang Wang, Wenbin Hu, Hanning Zhang, Hanze Dong, Renjie Pi, Han Zhao, Nan Jiang, Heng Ji, Yuan Yao, Tong Zhang |  |

Concept-based explanations arise as a promising avenue for explaining high-level patterns learned by LLMs. Yet their evaluation poses unique challenges, especially due to their non-local nature and high dimensional representation in a model’s hidden space. Current methods approach concepts from different perspectives, lacking a unified formalization. This makes evaluating the core measures of concepts, namely faithfulness or readability, challenging. To bridge the gap, we introduce a formal definition of concepts generalizing to diverse concept-based explanations’ settings. Based on this, we quantify the faithfulness of a concept explanation via perturbation. We ensure adequate perturbation in the high-dimensional space for different concepts via an optimization problem. Readability is approximated via an automatic and deterministic measure,... | Meng Li, Haoran Jin, Ruixuan Huang, Zhihao Xu, Defu Lian, Zijia Lin, Di Zhang, Xiting Wang |  |

The emergence of large language models (LLMs) further enables better human-machine interaction, and facilitates the development of conversational ITSs in various disciplines such as math and language learning. In dialogic teaching, recognizing and adapting to individual characteristics can significantly enhance student engagement and learning efficiency. However, characterizing and simulating student’s persona remain challenging in training and evaluating conversational ITSs. In this work, we propose a framework to construct profiles of different student groups by refining and integrating both cognitive and noncognitive aspects, and leverage LLMs for personality-aware student simulation in a language learning scenario. We further enhance the framework with multi-aspect validation, and conduct extensive analysis from both teacher and student perspectives.

However, the emergence of irrelevant insight and the lack of general insight can greatly undermine the effectiveness of insight. To solve this problem, in this paper, we introduce \*\*M\*\*ulti-\*\*S\*\*cale \*\*I\*\*nsight Agent (MSI-Agent), an embodied agent designed to improve LLMs’ planning and decision-making ability by summarizing and utilizing insight effectively across different scales. MSI achieves this through the experience selector, insight generator, and insight selector. Leveraging a three-part pipeline, MSI can generate task-specific and high-level insight, store it in a database, and then use relevant insight from it to aid in decision-making. Our experiments show that MSI outperforms another insight strategy when planning by GPT3.5. Moreover, We delve into the strategies for selecting seed experience and insight, aiming to provide LLM with more useful and relevant insight for better... | Dayuan Fu, Biqing Qi, Yihuai Gao, Che Jiang, Guanting Dong, Bowen Zhou |  |

Manually annotating fallacies in large-scale, real-world text data to create datasets for developing and validating detection models is costly. This paper introduces CoCoLoFa, the largest known logical fallacy dataset, containing 7,706 comments for 648 news articles, with each comment labeled for fallacy presence and type. We recruited 143 crowd workers to write comments embodying specific fallacy types (e.g., slippery slope) in response to news articles. Recognizing the complexity of this writing task, we built an LLM-powered assistant into the workers’ interface to aid in drafting and refining their comments. Experts rated the writing quality and labeling validity of CoCoLoFa as high and reliable. BERT-based models fine-tuned using CoCoLoFa achieved the highest fallacy detection (F1=0.86) and classification (F1=0.87) performance on its test set, outperforming the... | MinHsuan Yeh, Ruyuan Wan, TingHao Huang |  |

Existing tokenization approaches like Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) originate from the field of data compression, and it has been suggested that the effectiveness of BPE stems from its ability to condense text into a relatively small number of tokens. We test the hypothesis that fewer tokens lead to better downstream performance by introducing PathPiece, a new tokenizer that segments a document’s text into the minimum number of tokens for a given vocabulary. Through extensive experimentation we find this hypothesis not to be the case, casting doubt on the understanding of the reasons for effective tokenization. To examine which other factors play a role, we evaluate design decisions across all three phases of tokenization: pre-tokenization, vocabulary construction, and segmentation, offering new insights into the design of effective tokenizers. Specifically, we illustrate... | Craig W. Schmidt, Varshini Reddy, Haoran Zhang, Alec Alameddine, Omri Uzan, Yuval Pinter, Chris Tanner |  |

In this work, we propose an automatic red teaming framework that evaluates a given black-box model and exposes its vulnerabilities against unsafe and inappropriate content generation. Our framework uses in-context learning in a feedback loop to red team models and trigger them into unsafe content generation. In particular, taking text-to-image models as target models, we explore different feedback mechanisms to automatically learn effective and diverse adversarial prompts. Our experiments demonstrate that even with enhanced safety features, Stable Diffusion (SD) models are vulnerable to our adversarial prompts, raising concerns on their robustness in practical uses. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed framework is effective for red teaming... | Ninareh Mehrabi, Palash Goyal, Christophe Dupuy, Qian Hu, Shalini Ghosh, Richard S.

However, by effectively communicating uncertainties, they can still guide humans toward making sound decisions in those contexts. We demonstrate this idea by developing HEAR, a system that can successfully guide humans in simulated residential environments despite generating potentially inaccurate instructions. Diverging from systems that provide users with only the instructions they generate, HEAR warns users of potential errors in its instructions and suggests corrections. This rich uncertainty information effectively prevents misguidance and reduces the search space for users. Evaluation with 80 users shows that HEAR achieves a 13% increase in success rate and a 29% reduction in final location error distance compared to only presenting instructions to users. Interestingly, we find that offering users possibilities to explore, HEAR motivates them to make more attempts at the task, ultimately leading to... | Lingjun Zhao, Khanh Nguyen, Hal Daumé III |  |

Instruction tuning, a successful paradigm, enhances the ability of LLMs to follow natural language instructions and exhibit robust generalization across general tasks. However, these models often encounter performance limitations across multiple tasks due to constrained model capacity. Expanding this capacity during the instruction tuning phase poses significant challenges. To address this issue, we introduce parameter-efficient sparsity crafting (PESC), which crafts dense models into sparse models using the mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture. PESC integrates adapters into the MoE layers of sparse models, differentiating experts without altering the individual weights within these layers. This method significantly reduces computational costs and GPU memory requirements, facilitating model capacity expansion through a minimal parameter increase when... | Haoyuan Wu, Haisheng Zheng, Zhuolun He, Bei Yu |  |

High-quality data is crucial for enhancing the geometric capabilities of multi-modal models, yet existing open-source datasets and related efforts are either too challenging for direct model learning or suffer from misalignment between text and images. To overcome this issue, we introduce a novel pipeline that leverages GPT-4 and GPT-4V to generate relatively basic geometry problems with aligned text and images, facilitating model learning. We have produced a dataset of 4.9K geometry problems and combined it with 19K open-source data to form our GeoGPT4V dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the GeoGPT4V dataset significantly improves the geometry performance of various models on the MathVista and MathVision benchmarks.

Splitting entities diminishes retrieval accuracy and limits the model’s ability to incorporate up-to-date world knowledge not included in the training data. In this work, we enhance the LSR vocabulary with Wikipedia concepts and entities, enabling the model to resolve ambiguities more effectively and stay current with evolving knowledge. Central to our approach is a Dynamic Vocabulary (DyVo) head, which leverages existing entity embeddings and an entity retrieval component that identifies entities relevant to a query or document. We use the DyVo head to generate entity weights, which are then merged with word piece weights to create joint representations for efficient indexing and retrieval using an inverted index. In experiments across three entity-rich document ranking datasets, the resulting DyVo model substantially outperforms several... | Thong Nguyen, Shubham Chatterjee, Sean MacAvaney, Iain Mackie, Jeff Dalton, Andrew Yates |  |

Although there have been various PEFT methods for dense-architecture LLMs, PEFT for sparse-architecture LLMs is still underexplored. In this work, we study the PEFT method for LLMs with the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture and the contents of this work are mainly threefold: (1) We investigate the dispersion degree of the activated experts in customized tasks, and found that the routing distribution for specific task tend to be highly concentrated, while the distribution of activated experts varies significantly across different tasks. (2) We propose the expert-specialized fine-tuning method, which tunes the experts most relevant to downstream tasks while freezing the other experts; experimental results demonstrate that our method not only improves the tuning efficiency, but also matches or even surpasses the performance of full-parameter fine-tuning.

However, existing embedding models are limited to encoding short documents of typically 512 tokens, restrained from application scenarios requiring long inputs. This paper explores context window extension of existing embedding models, pushing their input length to a maximum of 32,768. We begin by evaluating the performance of existing embedding models using our newly constructed LongEmbed benchmark, which includes two synthetic and four real-world tasks, featuring documents of varying lengths and dispersed target information. The benchmarking results highlight huge opportunities for enhancement in current models. Via comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that training-free context window extension strategies can effectively increase the input length of these models by several folds.

However, zero-shot prompting always encounters low performance, and the superior performance of few-shot prompting hinges on the manual-crafting of task-specific demonstrations one by one. In this paper, we present \*\*RoSE\*\* (\*\*R\*\*easoning with \*\*O\*\*rchestrated \*\*S\*\*treaming \*\*E\*\*xperiences), a general framework for solving reasoning tasks that can self-improve as it answers various reasoning questions. To enable RoSE, we describe an architecture that extends an LLM to store all answered reasoning questions and their reasoning steps in a streaming experience pool and orchestrate helpful questions from the pool to assist itself in answering new questions. To set up a question-aware orchestration mechanism, RoSE first calculates the similarity of each question in the pool with the question to be... | Xiangyang Liu, Junliang He, Xipeng Qiu |  |

For noise, we propose the Multi-Granularity Denoising Generation model (MGDG), achieving word-level denoising via sequence labeling and utterance-level denoising via topic-aware dialogue segmentation. Denoised Attention in MGDG integrates multi-grained denoising information to help generate denoised output.For order bias, we first theoretically analyze its direct cause as the gap between ideal and actual training objectives and propose a distribution-based solution. Since this solution introduces a one-to-many learning challenge, our proposed Segmentation-aided Order Bias Mitigation (SOBM) method utilizes dialogue... | Xianlong Luo, Meng Yang, Yihao Wang |  |

We propose a labeling methodology grounded in Plutchik’s Wheel of Emotions theory for emotion classification.

Experimental results reveal that our methodology improves the performance of emotion classification. | Dongjun Lim, YunGyung Cheong |  |

Although recent prompt learning-based approaches have shown promising improvements on the ECI task, their performance are often subject to the delicate design of multiple prompts and the positive correlations between the main task and derivate tasks. The in-context learning paradigm provides explicit guidance for label prediction in the prompt learning paradigm, alleviating its reliance on complex prompts and derivative tasks. However, it does not distinguish between positive and negative demonstrations for analogy learning. Motivated from such considerations, this paper proposes an \*\*I\*\*n-\*\*C\*\*ontext \*\*C\*\*ontrastive \*\*L\*\*earning (ICCL) model that utilizes contrastive learning to enhance the effectiveness of both positive and negative demonstrations.

Although paraphrase classification has received widespread attention in NLP, paraphrases are usually considered independent from context, and common models and datasets are not applicable to dialog settings. In this work, we investigate paraphrases across turns in dialog (e.g., Speaker 1: “That book is mine.” becomes Speaker 2: “That book is yours.”). We provide an operationalization of context-dependent paraphrases, and develop a training for crowd-workers to classify paraphrases in dialog. We introduce ContextDeP, a dataset with utterance pairs from NPR and CNN news interviews annotated for context-dependent paraphrases. To enable analyses on label variation, the dataset contains 5,581 annotations on 600 utterance pairs. We present promising results with in-context learning and with token classification models for automatic... | Anna Wegmann, Tijs A. van den Broek, Dong Nguyen |  |

To that end, we iteratively trained transformer language models on systematically manipulated corpora which were human-scale in size, and then evaluated their learning of a rare grammatical phenomenon: the English Article+Adjective+Numeral+Noun (AANN) construction (“a beautiful five days”). We compared how well this construction was learned on the default corpus relative to a counterfactual corpus in which AANN sentences were removed. We found that AANNs were still learned better than systematically perturbed variants of the construction. Using additional counterfactual corpora, we suggest that this learning occurs through generalization from related constructions (e.g., “a few days”). An additional experiment showed that this learning is enhanced when there is more variability in the input. Taken together, our results provide an... | Kanishka Misra, Kyle Mahowald |  |

The process, however, is labor-intensive and costly. The emergence of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), exemplified by GPT-4, presents an unprecedented opportunity to automate the complicated process of data annotation and synthesis. While existing surveys have extensively covered LLM architecture, training, and general applications, we uniquely focus on their specific utility for data annotation. This survey contributes to three core aspects: LLM-Based Annotation Generation, LLM-Generated Annotations Assessment, and LLM-Generated Annotations Utilization. Furthermore, this survey includes an in-depth taxonomy of data types that LLMs can annotate, a comprehensive review of learning strategies for models utilizing LLM-generated annotations, and a detailed discussion of the primary challenges... | Zhen Tan, Dawei Li, Song Wang, Alimohammad Beigi, Bohan Jiang, Amrita Bhattacharjee, Mansooreh Karami, Jundong Li, Lu Cheng, Huan Liu |  |

Yet, they still struggle with translating low-resource languages. As supported by our experiments, a bilingual dictionary between the source and the target language could help. Motivated by the fact that multilingual training effectively improves cross-lingual performance, we show that a chained multilingual dictionary with words expressed in more languages can provide more information to better enhance the LLM translation. To this end, we present a novel framework, CoD, Chain-of-Dictionary Prompting, which augments LLMs with prior knowledge with the chains of multilingual dictionaries for a subset of input words to elicit translation abilities for LLMs. Experiments indicate that ChatGPT and InstructGPT still have room for improvement in translating many language pairs. And CoD elicits large gains by up to 13x... | Hongyuan Lu, Haoran Yang, Haoyang Huang, Dongdong Zhang, Wai Lam, Furu Wei |  |

To address this issue, the recently proposed Memory-efficient Zeroth-order (MeZO) methods attempt to fine-tune LLMs using only forward passes, thereby avoiding the need for a backpropagation graph. However, significant performance drops and a high risk of divergence have limited their widespread adoption. In this paper, we propose the Adaptive Zeroth-order Tensor-Train Adaption (AdaZeta) framework, specifically designed to improve the performance and convergence of the ZO methods. To enhance dimension-dependent ZO estimation accuracy, we introduce a fast-forward, low-parameter tensorized adapter. To tackle the frequently observed divergence issue in large-scale ZO fine-tuning tasks, we propose an adaptive query number schedule that guarantees convergence. Detailed theoretical analysis and... | Yifan Yang, Kai Zhen, Ershad Banijamali, Athanasios Mouchtaris, Zheng Zhang |  |

Fine-tuning these models for specific tasks typically involves updating all parameters, which is resource-intensive. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as the popular LoRA family, introduce low-rank matrices to learn only a few parameters efficiently. However, during inference, the product of these matrices updates all pre-trained parameters, complicating tasks like knowledge editing that require selective updates. We propose a novel PEFT method, which conducts row and column-wise sparse low-rank adaptation (RoseLoRA), to address this challenge. RoseLoRA identifies and updates only the most important parameters for a specific task, maintaining efficiency while preserving other model knowledge. By adding a sparsity constraint on the product of low-rank matrices and converting it to row and column-wise sparsity, we ensure efficient and precise... | Haoyu Wang, Tianci Liu, Ruirui Li, Monica Xiao Cheng, Tuo Zhao, Jing Gao |  |

However, these methods often struggle with complex inputs and encounter difficulties due to noisy knowledge retrieval, notably hindering model effectiveness. To address this issue, we introduce BlendFilter, a novel approach that elevates retrieval-augmented LLMs by integrating query generation blending with knowledge filtering. BlendFilter proposes the blending process through its query generation method, which integrates both external and internal knowledge augmentation with the original query, ensuring comprehensive information gathering. Additionally, our distinctive knowledge filtering module capitalizes on the intrinsic capabilities of the LLM, effectively eliminating extraneous data. We conduct extensive experiments on three open-domain question answering benchmarks, and the findings clearly indicate that our innovative BlendFilter surpasses... | Haoyu Wang, Ruirui Li, Haoming Jiang, Jinjin Tian, Zhengyang Wang, Chen Luo, Xianfeng Tang, Monica Xiao Cheng, Tuo Zhao, Jing Gao |  |

While empathy is influenced by narrative content, intuitively, people respond to the way a story is told as well, through narrative style. Yet the relationship between empathy and narrative style is not fully understood. In this work, we empirically examine and quantify this relationship between style and empathy using LLMs and large-scale crowdsourcing studies. We introduce a novel, theory-based taxonomy, HEART (Human Empathy and Narrative Taxonomy) that delineates elements of narrative style that can lead to empathy with the narrator of a story. We establish the performance of LLMs in extracting narrative elements from HEART, showing that prompting with our taxonomy leads to reasonable, human-level annotations beyond what prior lexicon-based methods can do. To show empirical use of our taxonomy, we collect a dataset of empathy judgments of stories... | Jocelyn Shen, Joel Mire, Hae Park, Cynthia Breazeal, Maarten Sap |  |

Despite its promising efficacy, DPO faces a notable drawback: “verbosity”, a common over-optimization phenomenon also observed in RLHF. While previous studies mainly attributed verbosity to biased labels within the data, we propose that the issue also stems from an inherent algorithmic length reliance in DPO. Specifically, we suggest that the discrepancy between sequence-level Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergences between chosen and rejected sequences, used in DPO, results in overestimated or underestimated rewards due to varying token lengths. Empirically, we utilize datasets with different label lengths to demonstrate the presence of biased rewards. We then introduce an effective downsampling approach, named SamPO,... | Junru Lu, Jiazheng Li, Siyu An, Meng Zhao, Yulan He, Di Yin, Xing Sun |  |

The challenge lies in retaining the essence of the original recipe while also aligning with the writing and dietary habits of the target culture. Information Retrieval (IR) offers a way to address the challenge because it retrieves results from the culinary practices of the target culture while maintaining relevance to the original recipe. We introduce a novel task about cross-cultural recipe retrieval and present a unique Chinese-English cross-cultural recipe retrieval benchmark. Our benchmark is manually annotated under limited resource, utilizing various retrieval models to generate a pool of candidate results for manual annotation. The dataset provides retrieval samples that are culturally adapted but textually diverse, presenting greater challenges. We propose CARROT, a plug-and-play cultural-aware recipe information retrieval framework that... | Tianyi Hu, Maria Maistro, Daniel Hershcovich |  |

However, current Med-LVLMs frequently encounter factual issues, often generating responses that do not align with established medical facts. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which utilizes external knowledge, can improve the factual accuracy of these models but introduces two major challenges. First, limited retrieved contexts might not cover all necessary information, while excessive retrieval can introduce irrelevant and inaccurate references, interfering with the model’s generation. Second, in cases where the model originally responds correctly, applying RAG can lead to an over-reliance on retrieved contexts, resulting in incorrect answers. To address these issues, we propose RULE, which consists of two components. First, we introduce a provably effective strategy for controlling factuality risk through the calibrated selection of the number of retrieved contexts. Second,... | Peng Xia, Kangyu Zhu, Haoran Li, Hongtu Zhu, Yun Li, Gang Li, Linjun Zhang, Huaxiu Yao |  |

Yet, the unique opportunities presented by the cryptocurrency market, noted for its on-chain data’s transparency and the critical influence of off-chain signals like news, remain largely untapped by LLMs. This work aims to bridge the gap by developing an LLM-based trading agent, CryptoTrade, which uniquely combines the analysis of on-chain and off-chain data. This approach leverages the transparency and immutability of on-chain data, as well as the timeliness and influence of off-chain signals, providing a comprehensive overview of the cryptocurrency market. CryptoTrade incorporates a reflective mechanism specifically engineered to refine its daily trading decisions by analyzing the outcomes of prior trading decisions. This research makes two significant contributions. Firstly, it broadens the applicability of LLMs to... | Yuan Li, Bingqiao Luo, Qian Wang, Nuo Chen, Xu Liu, Bingsheng He |  |

It has been a significant trend to explore ICL to evaluate and extrapolate the ability of LLMs. In this paper, we aim to survey and summarize the progress and challenges of ICL. We first present a formal definition of ICL and clarify its correlation to related studies. Then, we organize and discuss advanced techniques, including training strategies, prompt designing strategies, and related analysis. Additionally, we explore various ICL application scenarios, such as data engineering and knowledge updating. Finally, we address the challenges of ICL and suggest potential directions for further research. We hope that our work can encourage more research on uncovering how ICL works and improving ICL. | Qingxiu Dong, Lei Li, Damai Dai, Ce Zheng, Jingyuan Ma, Rui Li, Heming Xia, Jingjing Xu, Zhiyong Wu, Baobao Chang, Xu Sun, Lei Li, Zhifang Sui |  |

However, previously the research on this topic has been largely hindered since most existing datasets are small-scale, or contain documents of only a single type, which are characterized by a lack of document diversity. Moreover, there is a significant discrepancy in the annotation standards across datasets. In this paper, we introduce a large and diverse document hierarchy parsing (DHP) dataset to compensate for the data scarcity and inconsistency problem. We aim to set a new standard as a more practical, long-standing benchmark. Meanwhile, we present a new DHP framework designed to grasp both fine-grained text content and coarse-grained pattern at layout element level, enhancing the capacity of pre-trained text-layout models in handling the multi-page and multi-level challenges in DHP.

However, these efforts often neglect the crucial aspect of response quality, relying heavily on teacher models for direct response distillation. This paradigm, especially for complex instructions, can degrade the quality of synthesized data, compromising the knowledge distillation process. To this end, our study introduces the Adaptive Modular Response Evolution (AMR-Evol) framework, which employs a two-stage process to refine response distillation. The first stage, modular decomposition, breaks down the direct response into more manageable sub-modules. The second stage, adaptive response evolution, automatically evolves the response with the related function modules. Our experiments with three popular code benchmarks—HumanEval, MBPP, and EvalPlus—attests to the superiority of the... | Ziyang Luo, Xin Li, Hongzhan Lin, Jing Ma, Lidong Bing |  |

To eliminate hallucinations, existing methods manually annotate paired responses with and without hallucinations, and then employ various alignment algorithms to improve the alignment capability between images and text. However, they not only demand considerable computation resources during the finetuning stage but also require expensive human annotation to construct paired data needed by the alignment algorithms. To address these issues, we propose an efficient fine-grained unlearning framework (EFUF), which performs gradient ascent utilizing three tailored losses to eliminate hallucinations without paired data. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently reduces hallucinations while preserving the generation quality with modest... | Shangyu Xing, Fei Zhao, Zhen Wu, Tuo An, Weihao Chen, Chunhui Li, Jianbing Zhang, Xinyu Dai |  |

The way it is done is by divide and conquer: split the model into submodels, sequentially prune them, and reconstruct predictions of the dense counterparts on small calibration data one at a time; the final model is obtained simply by putting the resulting sparse submodels together. While this approach enables pruning under memory constraints, it generates high reconstruction errors. In this work, we first present an array of reconstruction techniques that can significantly reduce this error by more than 90%. Unwittingly, however, we discover that minimizing reconstruction error is not always ideal and can overfit the given calibration data, resulting in rather increased language perplexity and poor performance at downstream tasks. We find out that a strategy of self-generating calibration data can mitigate this trade-off between reconstruction and generalization, suggesting new... | Sungbin Shin, Wonpyo Park, Jaeho Lee, Namhoon Lee |  |

More recently large language models (LLMs) have come to the spotlight thanks to their generality and strong performance in a wide range of language tasks, including translation. Here we show that open-source LLMs perform on par with or better than some state-of-the-art baselines in simultaneous machine translation (SiMT) tasks, zero-shot. We also demonstrate that injection of minimal background information, which is easy with an LLM, brings further performance gains, especially on challenging technical subject-matter. This highlights LLMs’ potential for building next generation of massively multilingual, context-aware and terminologically accurate SiMT systems that require no resource-intensive training or fine-tuning. | Roman Koshkin, Katsuhito Sudoh, Satoshi Nakamura |  |

Traditional methods of peer review analyses often rely on exploration and statistics of existing peer review data, which do not adequately address the multivariate nature of the process, account for the latent variables, and are further constrained by privacy concerns due to the sensitive nature of the data. We introduce AgentReview, the first large language model (LLM) based peer review simulation framework, which effectively disentangles the impacts of multiple latent factors and addresses the privacy issue. Our study reveals significant insights, including a notable 37.1% variation in paper decisions due to reviewers’ biases, supported by sociological theories such as the social influence theory, altruism fatigue, and authority bias. We believe that this study could offer valuable insights to improve the design of peer review mechanisms. | Yiqiao Jin, Qinlin Zhao, Yiyang Wang, Hao Chen, Kaijie Zhu, Yijia Xiao, Jindong Wang |  |

This paper presents ChatRetriever, which inherits the strong generalization capability of large language models to robustly represent complex conversational sessions for dense retrieval. To achieve this, we propose a simple and effective dual-learning approach that adapts LLM for retrieval via contrastive learning while enhancing the complex session understanding through masked instruction tuning on high-quality conversational instruction tuning data. Extensive experiments on five conversational search benchmarks demonstrate that ChatRetriever significantly outperforms existing conversational dense retrievers, achieving state-of-the-art performance on par with LLM-based rewriting approaches. Furthermore, ChatRetriever exhibits superior robustness in handling diverse conversational contexts. Our work highlights the potential of adapting LLMs for retrieval with complex inputs like... | Kelong Mao, Chenlong Deng, Haonan Chen, Fengran Mo, Zheng Liu, Tetsuya Sakai, Zhicheng Dou |  |

In particular, pairwise LLM evaluators, which compare two generated texts and determine the preferred one, have been employed in a wide range of applications. However, LLMs exhibit preference biases and worrying sensitivity to prompt designs. In this work, we first reveal that the predictive preference of LLMs can be highly brittle and skewed, even with semantically equivalent instructions. We find that fairer predictive preferences from LLMs consistently lead to judgments that are better aligned with humans. Motivated by this phenomenon, we propose an automatic Zero-shot Evaluation-oriented Prompt Optimization framework, ZEPO, which aims to produce fairer preference decisions and improve the alignment of LLM evaluators with human judgments. To this end, we propose a zero-shot learning objective based on the preference decision... | Han Zhou, Xingchen Wan, Yinhong Liu, Nigel Collier, Ivan Vulic, Anna Korhonen |  |

Different from general web search, legal case retrieval involves processing lengthy, complex, and highly specialized legal documents. Existing methods in this domain often overlook the incorporation of legal expert knowledge, which is crucial for accurately understanding and modeling legal cases, leading to unsatisfactory retrieval performance. This paper introduces KELLER, a legal knowledge-guided case reformulation approach based on large language models (LLMs) for effective and interpretable legal case retrieval. By incorporating professional legal knowledge about crimes and law articles, we enable large language models to accurately reformulate the original legal case into concise sub-facts of crimes, which contain the essential information of the case. Extensive experiments on two legal case retrieval benchmarks demonstrate superior retrieval performance and robustness on complex legal... | Chenlong Deng, Kelong Mao, Zhicheng Dou |  |

Despite the remarkable ICL capabilities demonstrated by Large Language Models (LLMs), existing works are highly dependent on large-scale labeled support sets, not always feasible in practical scenarios. To refine this approach, we focus primarily on an innovative selective annotation mechanism, which precedes the standard demonstration retrieval. We introduce the Language Model-based Determinant Point Process (LM-DPP) that simultaneously considers the uncertainty and diversity of unlabeled instances for optimal selection. Consequently, this yields a subset for annotation that strikes a trade-off between the two factors. We apply LM-DPP to various language models, including GPT-J, LlaMA, and GPT-3. Experimental results on 9 NLU and 2 Generation datasets demonstrate that LM-DPP can effectively select canonical examples.... | Peng Wang, Xiaobin Wang, Chao Lou, Shengyu Mao, Pengjun Xie, Yong Jiang |  |

However, these methods have yet to leverage pre-trained language models, despite their adaptability to various downstream tasks. In this work, we explore this gap by adapting a pre-trained language model for auto-regressive text-to-image generation, and find that pre-trained language models offer limited help. We provide a two-fold explanation by analyzing tokens from each modality. First, we demonstrate that image tokens possess significantly different semantics compared to text tokens, rendering pre-trained language models no more effective in modeling them than randomly initialized ones. Second, the text tokens in the image-text datasets are too simple compared to normal language model pre-training data, which causes the catastrophic degradation of language models’ capability. | Yuhui Zhang, Brandon McKinzie, Zhe Gan, Vaishaal Shankar, Alexander Toshev |  |

In QUD parsing, each sentence is viewed as an answer to a question triggered by an anchor sentence in prior context. The resulting QUD structure is required to conform to several theoretical criteria like answer compatibility(how well the question is answered), making QUD parsing a challenging task. Previous works construct QUD parsers in a pipelined manner (i.e. detect the trigger sentence in context and then generate the question). However, these parsers lack a holistic view of the task and can hardly satisfy all the criteria. In this work, we introduce QUDSELECT, a joint-training framework that selectively decodes the QUD dependency structures considering the QUD criteria criteria. Using instruction-tuning, we train models to simultaneously predict the anchor sentence and generate the associated question. To explicitly incorporate the criteria,... | Ashima Suvarna, Xiao Liu, Tanmay Parekh, KaiWei Chang, Nanyun Peng |  |

Studies on these foundation models underscore the importance of low-data training and fine-tuning. This topic, well-known in natural language processing (NLP), has also gained increasing attention in the emerging field of scientific machine learning (SciML). To address the limitations of low-data training and fine-tuning, we draw inspiration from Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR) theory, analyzing the shape of empirical spectral densities (ESDs) and revealing an imbalance in training quality across different model layers. To mitigate this issue, we adapt a recently proposed layer-wise learning rate scheduler, TempBalance, which effectively balances training quality across layers and enhances low-data training and fine-tuning for both NLP and SciML tasks. Notably, TempBalance demonstrates increasing performance gains as the amount of... | Zihang Liu, Yuanzhe Hu, Tianyu Pang, Yefan Zhou, Pu Ren, Yaoqing Yang |  |

However, multilingual human preference data are difficult to obtain at scale, making it challenging to extend this framework to diverse languages. In this work, we evaluate a simple approach for zero-shot cross-lingual alignment, where a reward model is trained on preference data in one source language and directly applied to other target languages. On summarization and open-ended dialog generation, we show that this method is consistently successful under comprehensive evaluation settings, including human evaluation: cross-lingually aligned models are preferred by humans over unaligned models on up to >70% of evaluation instances. We moreover find that a different-language reward model sometimes yields better aligned models than a same-language reward model. We also identify best practices when there is no language-specific data for even... | Zhaofeng Wu, Ananth Balashankar, Yoon Kim, Jacob Eisenstein, Ahmad Beirami |  |

However, these models often exhibit limited generalization capabilities and face challenges in improving in-domain accuracy. Recent research has explored using large language models (LLMs) as retrievers, achieving state-of-the-art performance across various tasks. Despite these advancements, the specific benefits of LLMs over traditional retrievers and the impact of different LLM configurations—such as parameter sizes, pre-training duration, and alignment processes—on retrieval tasks remain unclear. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on a wide range of retrieval tasks, including in-domain accuracy, data efficiency, zero-shot generalization, lengthy retrieval, instruction-based retrieval, and multi-task learning. We evaluate over 15 different backbone LLMs and non-LLMs. Our findings reveal that larger models and extensive pre-training consistently enhance in-domain... | Kun Luo, Minghao Qin, Zheng Liu, Shitao Xiao, Jun Zhao, Kang Liu |  |

Recent LLM-enhanced KGR models input KG structural information into LLMs. However, they require fine-tuning on open-source LLMs and are not applicable to closed-source LLMs. Therefore, in this paper, to leverage the knowledge in LLMs without fine-tuning to assist and enhance conventional KGR models, we propose a new three-stage pipeline, including knowledge alignment, KG reasoning and entity reranking. Specifically, in the alignment stage, we propose three strategies to align the knowledge in LLMs to the KG schema by explicitly associating unconnected nodes with semantic relations. Based on the enriched KGs, we train structure-aware KGR models to integrate aligned knowledge to original knowledge existing in KGs. In the reranking stage, after obtaining the results of KGR models, we rerank the... | Zhongwu Chen, Long Bai, Zixuan Li, Zhen Huang, Xiaolong Jin, Yong Dou |  |

Existing studies on tool use with LLMs primarily focus on enhancing the tool-calling ability of LLMs. In practice, like chat assistants, LLMs are also required to align with human values in the context of tool use. Specifically, LLMs should refuse to answer unsafe tool use relevant instructions and insecure tool responses to ensure their reliability and harmlessness. At the same time, LLMs should demonstrate autonomy in tool use to reduce the costs associated with tool calling. To tackle this issue, we first introduce the principle that LLMs should follow in tool use scenarios: H2A. The goal of H2A is to align LLMs with \*\*helpfulness\*\*, \*\*harmlessness\*\*, and \*\*autonomy\*\*. In addition, we propose ToolAlign, a dataset comprising instruction-tuning data and preference data to align LLMs with the H2A principle for tool use. Based on ToolAlign,... | Zhiyuan Chen, Shiqi Shen, Guangyao Shen, Gong Zhi, Xu Chen, Yankai Lin |  |

Despite its critical role in model performance, ensuring the quality of this data is challenging due to its sheer volume and the absence of sample-level quality annotations and enhancements. In this paper, we introduce DecorateLM, a data engineering method designed to refine the pretraining corpus through data rating, tagging and editing. Specifically, DecorateLM rates texts against quality criteria, tags texts with hierarchical labels, and edits texts into a more formalized format. Due to the massive size of the pretraining corpus, adopting an LLM for decorating the entire corpus is less efficient. Therefore, to balance performance with efficiency, we curate a meticulously annotated training corpus for DecorateLM using a large language model and distill data engineering expertise into a compact 1.2... | Ranchi Zhao, Zhen Leng Thai, Yifan Zhang, Shengding Hu, Jie Zhou, Yunqi Ba, Jie Cai, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun |  |

This paper describes a simple approach for detecting such \*\*contextual hallucinations\*\*. We hypothesize that contextual hallucinations are related to the extent to which an LLM attends to information in the provided context versus its own generations. Based on this intuition, we propose a simple hallucination detection model whose input features are given by the ratio of attention weights on the context versus newly generated tokens (for each attention head). We find that a linear classifier based on these _lookback ratio_ features is as effective as a richer detector that utilizes the entire hidden states of an LLM or a text-based entailment model. The lookback ratio-based detector—\*\*Lookback Lens\*\*—is found to transfer across tasks and even models, allowing a... | YungSung Chuang, Linlu Qiu, ChengYu Hsieh, Ranjay Krishna, Yoon Kim, James R.

In practice, the multifaceted nature of human preferences inadvertently introduces what is known as the ”alignment tax”–a compromise where enhancements in alignment within one objective (e.g., harmlessness) can diminish performance in others (e.g., helpfulness). However, existing alignment techniques are mostly unidirectional, leading to suboptimal trade-offs and poor flexibility over various objectives. To navigate this challenge, we argue the prominence of grounding LLMs with evident preferences. We introduce controllable preference optimization (CPO), which explicitly specifies preference scores for different objectives, thereby guiding the model to generate responses that meet the requirements. Our experimental analysis reveals that the aligned models can provide responses that match various preferences among the ”3H” (helpfulness, honesty, harmlessness)... | Yiju Guo, Ganqu Cui, Lifan Yuan, Ning Ding, Zexu Sun, Bowen Sun, Huimin Chen, Ruobing Xie, Jie Zhou, Yankai Lin, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun |  |

Although many existing methods attempt to mitigate Matthew effect in the static or quasi-static recommendation scenarios, such issue will be more pronounced as users engage with the system over time. To this end, we propose a novel framework, Multi-Hypergraph Boosted Multi-Interest Self-Supervised Learning for Conversational Recommendation (HiCore), aiming to address Matthew effect in the Conversational Recommender System (CRS) involving the dynamic user-system feedback loop. It devotes to learn multi-level user interests by building a set of hypergraphs (i.e., item-, entity-, word-oriented multiple-channel hypergraphs) to alleviate the Matthew effec. Extensive experiments on four CRS-based datasets showcase that HiCore attains a new state-of-the-art performance, underscoring its... | Yongsen Zheng, Ruilin Xu, Guohua Wang, Liang Lin, KwokYan Lam |  |

Existing efforts have been devoted to a separate generation of an image-related question, a correct answer, or challenge distractors. By contrast, we turn to a holistic generation and optimization of questions, answers, and distractors (QADs) in this study. This integrated generation strategy eliminates the need for human curation and guarantees information consistency. Furthermore, we first propose to put the spotlight on different image regions to diversify QADs. Accordingly, a novel framework ReBo is formulated in this paper. ReBo cyclically generates each QAD based on a recurrent multimodal encoder, and each generation is focusing on a different area of the image compared to those already concerned by the previously generated QADs. In addition to traditional VQA comparisons with state-of-the-art approaches, we also validate the capability of... | Wenjian Ding, Yao Zhang, Jun Wang, Adam Jatowt, Zhenglu Yang |  |

The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence generated content, particularly in technologies like large language models for text generation and diffusion models for visual generation, have sparked widespread research interest in applying these multimodal models in the fashion domain. However, tasks that use embeddings, such as image-to-text or text-to-image retrieval, have been largely ignored from this perspective due to the diverse nature of the multimodal fashion domain. And current research on multi-task single models lack focus on image generation. In this work, we present UniFashion, a unified framework that simultaneously tackles the challenges of multimodal generation and retrieval tasks within the fashion domain, integrating image generation with retrieval tasks and text generation tasks. UniFashion unifies embedding and generative tasks by... | Xiangyu Zhao, Yuehan Zhang, Wenlong Zhang, XiaoMing Wu |  |

As these models continue to entrench themselves in society, the content they produce will become increasingly pervasive in databases that are, in turn, incorporated into the pre-training data, fine-tuning data, retrieval data, etc. of other language models. In this paper we formalize the idea of a communication network of LLMs and introduce a method for representing the perspective of individual models within a collection of LLMs. Given these tools we systematically study information diffusion in the communication network of LLMs in various simulated settings. | Hayden S.

Furthermore, even if the MLLMs can identify A, it may refrain from answering due to privacy concerns. In this paper, we introduce a novel method called Matching-Augmented Reasoning (MAR) to enhance VEQA. Given a collection of visual objects with captions, MAR preprocesses each object individually, identifying faces, names, and their alignments within the object. It encodes this information and stores their vector representations in vector databases. When handling VEQA, MAR retrieves matching faces and names and organizes these entities into a matching graph. MAR then derives the answer to the query by reasoning over this matching graph. Extensive experiments show... | Zhengxuan Zhang, Yin Wu, Yuyu Luo, Nan Tang |  |

In addition to these inconsistencies, we also observe that LLMs, while capable of solving hard problems, can paradoxically fail at easier ones. To evaluate this hard-to-easy inconsistency, we develop the ConsisEval benchmark, where each entry comprises a pair of questions with a strict order of difficulty. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of consistency score to quantitatively measure this inconsistency and analyze the potential for improvement in consistency by relative consistency score. Based on comprehensive experiments across a variety of existing models, we find: (1) GPT-4 achieves the highest consistency score of 92.2% but is still inconsistent to specific questions due to distraction by redundant information, misinterpretation of questions, etc.; (2) models with... | Zhe Yang, Yichang Zhang, Tianyu Liu, Jian Yang, Junyang Lin, Chang Zhou, Zhifang Sui |  |

LLM Agent Learning via Iterative Step-level Process Refinement](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.93) |  | 0 | Large language model agents have exhibited exceptional performance across a range of complex interactive tasks. Recent approaches have utilized tuning with expert trajectories to enhance agent performance, yet they primarily concentrate on outcome rewards, which may lead to errors or suboptimal actions due to the absence of process supervision signals. In this paper, we introduce the \*\*I\*\*terative step-level \*\*P\*\*rocess \*\*R\*\*efinement \*\*(IPR)\*\* framework, which provides detailed step-by-step guidance to enhance agent training. Specifically, we adopt the Monte Carlo method to estimate step-level rewards. During each iteration, the agent explores along the expert trajectory and generates new actions. These actions are then evaluated against the corresponding step of expert trajectory using step-level rewards. Such comparison helps identify discrepancies, yielding contrastive action pairs that serve as training data for the agent.

However, current works in controllable text generation have yet to explore using these standards as references for control. Towards this end, we introduce Standardize, a retrieval-style in-context learning-based framework to guide large language models to align with expert-defined standards. Focusing on English language standards in the education domain as a use case, we consider the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) and Common Core Standards (CCS) for the task of open-ended content generation. Our findings show that models can gain 45% to 100% increase in precise accuracy across open and commercial LLMs evaluated, demonstrating that the use of knowledge artifacts extracted from standards and integrating them in the generation process can effectively guide... | Joseph Marvin Imperial, Gail Forey, Harish Tayyar Madabushi |  |

Previous studies often rely on manually collected entity-relevant sentences from the web or attempt to bridge the gap between tokens and entity labels across domains. These approaches are time-consuming and inefficient, as these data are often weakly correlated with the target task and require extensive pre-training.To address these issues, we propose automatically generating task-oriented knowledge (GTOK) using large language models (LLMs), focusing on the reasoning process of entity extraction. Then, we employ task-oriented pre-training (TOPT) to facilitate domain adaptation. Additionally, current cross-domain NER methods often lack explicit explanations for their effectiveness. Therefore, we introduce the concept of information density to better evaluate the model’s effectiveness... | Zhihao Zhang, Sophia Yat Mei Lee, Junshuang Wu, Dong Zhang, Shoushan Li, Erik Cambria, Guodong Zhou |  |

In this paper, we demonstrate a security threat where adversaries can exploit the openness of these knowledge bases by injecting deceptive content into the retrieval database, intentionally changing the model’s behavior. This threat is critical as it mirrors real-world usage scenarios where RAG systems interact with publicly accessible knowledge bases, such as web scrapings and user-contributed data pools. To be more realistic, we target a realistic setting where the adversary has no knowledge of users’ queries, knowledge base data, and the LLM parameters. We demonstrate that it is possible to exploit the model successfully through crafted content uploads with access to the retriever. Our findings emphasize an urgent need for security measures in the design and deployment of... | Zhen Tan, Chengshuai Zhao, Raha Moraffah, Yifan Li, Song Wang, Jundong Li, Tianlong Chen, Huan Liu |  |

This complexity and diversity in SGG leads to underrepresentation, where parts of triplet labels are rare or even unseen during training, resulting in imprecise predictions. To tackle this, we propose integrating the pretrained Vision-language Models to enhance representation. However, due to the gap between pretraining and SGG, direct inference of pretrained VLMs on SGG leads to severe bias, which stems from the imbalanced predicates distribution in the pretraining language set. To alleviate the bias, we introduce a novel LM Estimation to approximate the unattainable predicates distribution. Finally, we ensemble the debiased VLMs with SGG models to enhance the representation, where we design a certainty-aware indicator to score each sample and dynamically adjust the ensemble weights. Our training-free method effectively... | Yuxuan Wang, Xiaoyuan Liu |  |

The legal landscape is struggling to keep pace with these rapid advancements, with ongoing debates about whether generated text might plagiarize copyrighted materials. Current LLMs may infringe on copyrights or overly restrict non-copyrighted texts, leading to these challenges: (i) the need for a comprehensive evaluation benchmark to assess copyright compliance from multiple aspects; (ii) evaluating robustness against safeguard bypassing attacks; and (iii) developing effective defenses targeted against the generation of copyrighted text.To tackle these challenges, we introduce a curated dataset to evaluate methods, test attack strategies, and propose a lightweight, real-time defense mechanism to prevent the generation of copyrighted text, ensuring the safe and lawful use of... | Xiaoze Liu, Ting Sun, Tianyang Xu, Feijie Wu, Cunxiang Wang, Xiaoqian Wang, Jing Gao |  |

Architectures like Mamba have scaled to billions of parameters with selective SSM. To facilitate broader applications using Mamba, exploring its efficiency is crucial. While token reduction techniques offer a straightforward post-training strategy, we find that applying existing methods directly to SSMs leads to substantial performance drops. Through insightful analysis, we identify the reasons for this failure and the limitations of current techniques. In response, we propose a tailored, unified post-training token reduction method for SSMs. Our approach integrates token importance and similarity, thus taking advantage of both pruning and merging, to devise a fine-grained intra-layer token reduction strategy.

However, their use in answering questions from knowledge bases remains largely unexplored. Implementing a KBQA system using traditional methods is challenging due to the shortage of task-specific training data and the complexity of creating task-focused model structures. In this paper, we present Triad, a unified framework that utilizes an LLM-based agent with multiple roles for KBQA tasks. The agent is assigned three roles to tackle different KBQA subtasks: agent as a generalist for mastering various subtasks, as a decision maker for the selection of candidates, and as an advisor for answering questions with knowledge. Our KBQA framework is executed in four phases, involving the collaboration of the agent’s multiple roles.

Task arithmetic has emerged as a cost-effective approach for MTL. It enables performance enhancement across multiple tasks by adding their corresponding task vectors to a pre-trained model. However, the current lack of a method that can simultaneously achieve optimal performance, computational efficiency, and data privacy limits their application to LLMs. In this paper, we propose Model Exclusive Task Arithmetic for merging GPT-scale models (MetaGPT) which formalizes the objective of model merging into a multi-task learning framework, aiming to minimize the average loss difference between the merged model and each individual task model. Since data privacy limits the use of multi-task training data, we leverage LLMs’ local linearity and task vectors’ orthogonality to separate the data term and scaling... | Yuyan Zhou, Liang Song, Bingning Wang, Weipeng Chen |  |

Traditional approaches to ECI have primarily utilized linguistic patterns and multi-hop relational inference, risking false causality identification due to informal usage of causality and specious graphical inference. In this paper, we adopt the Rubin Causal Model to identify event causality: given two temporally ordered events, we see the first event as the treatment and the second one as the observed outcome. Determining their causality involves manipulating the treatment and estimating the resultant change in the likelihood of the outcome. Given that it is only possible to implement manipulation conceptually in the text domain, as a work-around, we try to find a twin for the protagonist from existing corpora. This twin should have identical life experiences with the protagonist before the treatment but undergoes an... | Haoyu Wang, Fengze Liu, Jiayao Zhang, Dan Roth, Kyle Richardson |  |

However, MSA-based approaches suffer from substantial computational overhead and generally underperform in generalizing to de novo proteins. This study reevaluates the role of MSA, proposing it as a retrieval augmentation method and questioning the necessity of sequence alignment. We show that a simple alternative, Retrieved Sequence Augmentation (RSA), can enhance protein representation learning without the need for alignment and cumbersome preprocessing. RSA surpasses MSA Transformer by an average of 5% in both structural and property prediction tasks while being 373 times faster. Additionally, RSA demonstrates enhanced transferability for predicting de novo proteins. This methodology addresses a critical need for efficiency in protein prediction and can be rapidly employed to identify homologous sequences, improve representation learning, and enhance the... | Chang Ma, Haiteng Zhao, Lin Zheng, Jiayi Xin, Qintong Li, Lijun Wu, Zhihong Deng, Yang Lu, Qi Liu, Sheng Wang, Lingpeng Kong |  |

However, these models still suffer from multimodal hallucination, which means the generation of objects or content that violates the images. Many existing work detects hallucination by directly judging whether an object exists in an image, overlooking the association between the object and semantics. To address this issue, we propose Hierarchical Feedback Learning with Vision-enhanced Penalty Decoding (HELPD). This framework incorporates hallucination feedback at both object and sentence semantic levels. Remarkably, even with a marginal degree of training, this approach can alleviate over 15% of hallucination. Simultaneously, HELPD penalizes the output logits according to the image attention window to avoid being overly affected by generated text. HELPD can be seamlessly integrated with any LVLMs. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework yields favorable results across... | Fan Yuan, Chi Qin, Xiaogang Xu, Piji Li |  |

Nonetheless, spatial reasoning capabilities of modern VLMs in this setup remain unattested and underexplored. In this work, we study their capability to understand and reason over spatial relations from the top view. The focus on top view also enables controlled evaluations at different granularity of spatial reasoning; we clearly disentangle different abilities (e.g., recognizing particular objects versus understanding their relative positions). We introduce the TopViewRS (Top-View Reasoning in Space) dataset, consisting of 11,384 multiple-choice questions with either realistic or semantic top-view map as visual input. We then use it to study and evaluate VLMs across 4 perception and reasoning tasks with different levels of... | Chengzu Li, Caiqi Zhang, Han Zhou, Nigel Collier, Anna Korhonen, Ivan Vulic |  |

While recent attack methods can achieve a relatively high attack success rate (ASR), we’ve observed that the generated adversarial examples have a different data distribution compared with the original examples. Specifically, these adversarial examples exhibit reduced confidence levels and greater divergence from the training data distribution. Consequently, they are easy to detect using straightforward detection methods, diminishing the efficacy of such attacks. To address this issue, we propose a Distribution-Aware Adversarial Attack (DA3) method. DA3 considers the distribution shifts of adversarial examples to improve attacks’ effectiveness under detection methods. We further design a novel evaluation metric, the Non-detectable Attack Success Rate (NASR), which integrates both ASR and detectability for the attack task. We conduct experiments on four widely used datasets to... | Yibo Wang, Xiangjue Dong, James Caverlee, Philip S. Yu |  |

First, we tested five different LLMs by using two personality tests: Short Dark Triad (SD-3) and Big Five Inventory (BFI). All models scored higher than the human average on SD-3, suggesting a relatively darker personality pattern. Despite being instruction fine-tuned with safety metrics to reduce toxicity, InstructGPT, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 still showed dark personality patterns; these models scored higher than self-supervised GPT-3 on the Machiavellianism and narcissism traits on SD-3. Then, we evaluated the LLMs in the GPT series by using well-being tests to study the impact of fine-tuning with more training data. We observed a continuous increase in the well-being scores of GPT models. Following these observations, we showed that fine-tuning Llama-2-chat-7B with responses from BFI using direct preference optimization could effectively reduce the... | Xingxuan Li, Yutong Li, Lin Qiu, Shafiq Joty, Lidong Bing |  |

The potential of the diffusion language model (LM) for textual data augmentation (DA) remains unexplored, moreover, textual DA methods struggle to balance the diversity and consistency of new samples. Most DA methods either perform logical modifications or rephrase less important tokens in the original sequence with the language model. In the context of SC, strong emotional tokens could act critically on the sentiment of the whole sequence. Therefore, contrary to rephrasing less important context, we propose DiffusionCLS to leverage a diffusion LM to capture in-domain knowledge and generate pseudo samples by reconstructing strong label-related tokens. This approach ensures a balance between consistency and diversity, avoiding the introduction of noise and augmenting crucial features of datasets. DiffusionCLS also comprises a... | Zhuowei Chen, Lianxi Wang, Yuben Wu, Xinfeng Liao, Yujia Tian, Junyang Zhong |  |

Motivated by the research of retrieval-augmented generation in the field of natural language processing, we use Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) to retrieve related knowledge to help the model answer questions. However, DPR conduct retrieving in natural language space, which may not ensure comprehensive acquisition of image information. Thus, the retrieved knowledge is not truly conducive to helping answer the question, affecting the performance of the overall system. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework that leverages the visual-language model to select the key knowledge retrieved by DPR and answer questions. The framework consists of two modules: Selector and Answerer, where both are initialized by the MLLM and parameter-efficiently finetuned... | Dongze Hao, Qunbo Wang, Longteng Guo, Jie Jiang, Jing Liu |  |

Traditional approaches to SiMT typically require sophisticated architectures and extensive parameter configurations for training adaptive read/write policies, which in turn demand considerable computational power and memory. We propose PsFuture, the first zero-shot adaptive read/write policy for SiMT, enabling the translation model to independently determine read/write actions without the necessity for additional training. Furthermore, we introduce a novel training strategy, Prefix-to-Full (P2F), specifically tailored to adjust offline translation models for SiMT applications, exploiting the advantages of the bidirectional attention mechanism inherent in offline models. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our zero-shot policy attains performance on par with strong baselines and the P2F method can further enhance performance, achieving... | Libo Zhao, Jing Li, Ziqian Zeng |  |

Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in chart understanding. However, the sheer size of these models limits their use in resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we present TinyChart, an efficient MLLM for chart understanding with only 3B parameters. TinyChart overcomes two key challenges in efficient chart understanding: (1) reduce the burden of learning numerical computations through Program-of-Thoughts (PoT) learning, which trains the model to generate Python programs for numerical calculations, and (2) reduce lengthy vision feature sequences through Vision Token Merging, which gradually merges most similar vision tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 3B TinyChart achieves SOTA performance on various chart understanding benchmarks including ChartQA, Chart-to-Text, Chart-to-Table, OpenCQA, and ChartX.

To better reflect real-world fact-checking, we first develop a novel Chinese document-level evidence retriever, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We then demonstrate the limitations of translation-based methods and multilingual language models, highlighting the need for language-specific systems. To better analyze token-level biases in different systems, we construct an adversarial dataset based on the CHEF dataset, where each instance has a large word overlap with the original one but holds the opposite veracity label. Experimental results on the CHEF dataset and our adversarial dataset show that our proposed method outperforms translation-based methods and multilingual language models and is more robust toward biases, emphasizing the importance of language-specific fact-checking systems. | Caiqi Zhang, Zhijiang Guo, Andreas Vlachos |  |

Traditional Vision-Language models (VLMs) perform well in visual perception tasks while struggling with complex reasoning scenarios. Conversely, Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate robust text reasoning capabilities; however, they lack visual acuity. To bridge this gap, we propose \*\*C\*\*omplex \*\*V\*\*isual \*\*R\*\*easoning \*\*L\*\*arge \*\*L\*\*anguage \*\*M\*\*odels (\*\*CVR-LLM\*\*), capitalizing on VLMs’ visual perception proficiency and LLMs’ extensive reasoning capability. Unlike recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that require a projection layer, our approach transforms images into detailed, context-aware descriptions using an iterative self-refinement loop and leverages LLMs’ text knowledge for accurate predictions without extra training.

Existing detoxification methods of directly constraining the model output or further training the model on the non-toxic corpus fail to achieve a decent balance between detoxification effectiveness and generation quality. This issue stems from the neglect of constrain imposed by the context since language models are designed to generate output that closely matches the context while detoxification methods endeavor to ensure the safety of the output even if it semantically deviates from the context. In view of this, we introduce a Context-aware Model self-Detoxification (CMD) framework that pays attention to both the context and the detoxification process, i.e., first detoxifying the context and then making the language model generate along the safe context. Specifically, CMD framework involves two phases: utilizing language models to synthesize data and applying these data for training.

Compared to previous small-scale models, they are capable of generating fluent output based on the provided prefix or prompt. However, one critical challenge — the \*hallucination\* problem — remains to be resolved. Generally, the community refers to the undetected hallucination scenario where the LLMs generate text unrelated to the input text or facts. In this study, we intend to model the distributional distance between the regular conditional output and the unconditional output, which is generated without a given input text. Based upon Taylor Expansion for this distance at the output probability space, our approach manages to leverage the embedding and first-order gradient information. The resulting approach is plug-and-play that can be easily adapted to any autoregressive LLM. On the hallucination benchmarks HADES and other datasets, our approach achieves... | Xiaomeng Hu, Yiming Zhang, Ru Peng, Haozhe Zhang, Chenwei Wu, Gang Chen, Junbo Zhao |  |

However, the multifaceted nature of singing styles poses a significant challenge for effective modeling, transfer, and control. Furthermore, current SVS models often fail to generate singing voices rich in stylistic nuances for unseen singers. To address these challenges, we introduce TCSinger, the first zero-shot SVS model for style transfer across cross-lingual speech and singing styles, along with multi-level style control. Specifically, TCSinger proposes three primary modules: 1) the clustering style encoder employs a clustering vector quantization model to stably condense style information into a compact latent space; 2) the Style and Duration Language Model (S&D-LM) concurrently predicts style information and phoneme duration,... | Yu Zhang, Ziyue Jiang, Ruiqi Li, Changhao Pan, Jinzheng He, Rongjie Huang, Chuxin Wang, Zhou Zhao |  |

As outlined in the gist of “Cognitive Relevance Principle”, helpful speakers should optimize the “cognitive relevance” through maximizing the “cognitive effects” and minimizing the “processing effort” imposed on listeners. Although preference learning methods have given rise a boon of studies in pursuit of“effect-optimization”, none have delved into the critical “effort-optimiazation” to fully cultivate the awareness of “optimal relevance” into thecognition of conversation agents. To address this gap, we integrate the “Cognitive Relevance Principle” into emotional support agents in the environment of multi-turn conversation. The results demonstrate a significant and robust improvement against the baseline systems with respect to response quality, human-likedness and supportivenss. This study offers compelling evidence for the effectiveness of the “Relevance Principle” in generating... | Junlin Li, Bo Peng, YuYin Hsu, ChuRen Huang |  |

This can lead to varying interpretations of the same input based on different assumptions or background knowledge. It is thus crucial for agents to adeptly handle the inherent ambiguity in queries to ensure reliability. However, even state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) still face challenges in such scenarios, primarily due to the following hurdles: (1) LLMs are not explicitly trained to deal with ambiguous utterances; (2) the degree of ambiguity perceived by the LLMs may vary depending on the possessed knowledge. To address these issues, we propose Alignment with Perceived Ambiguity (APA), a novel pipeline that aligns LLMs to manage ambiguous queries by leveraging their own assessment of ambiguity (i.e., perceived ambiguity).

Intuitive solutions include improving the size and quality of data or using larger foundation models. They show effectiveness in mitigating these issues, but at an expensive cost of collecting a vast amount of new data and introducing a significantly larger model. Standing at the intersection of these approaches, we examine the three object-oriented problems from the perspective of the image-to-text mapping process by the multimodal connector. In this paper, we first identify the limitations of multimodal connectors stemming from insufficient training data. Driven by this, we propose to enhance the mapping... | Daiqing Qi, Handong Zhao, Zijun Wei, Sheng Li |  |

Recent studies have explored leveraging the LLM itself as an optimizer to identify optimal prompts that maximize task accuracy. However, when evaluating prompts, such approaches heavily rely on elusive manually annotated gold labels to calculate task accuracy for each candidate prompt, which hinders its generality. To overcome the limitation, this work proposes GLaPE, a gold label-agnostic prompt evaluation method to alleviate dependence on gold labels. GLaPE is composed of two critical aspects: self-consistency evaluation of a single prompt and mutual-consistency refinement across multiple prompts. Experimental results on 8 widely-recognized reasoning tasks demonstrate that GLaPE can produce more effective prompts, achieving performance comparable to those derived from manually annotated gold labels. Analysis shows that GLaPE provides reliable evaluations aligned... | Xuanchang Zhang, Zhuosheng Zhang, Hai Zhao |  |

Collecting a broad and high-quality set of query and code pairs is crucial to the success of this task. However, existing data collection methods struggle to effectively balance scalability and annotation quality. In this paper, we first analyze the factors influencing the quality of function annotations generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). We find that the invocation of intra-repository functions and third-party APIs plays a significant role. Building on this insight, we propose a novel annotation method that enhances the annotation context by incorporating the content of functions called within the repository and information on third-party API functionalities. Additionally, we integrate LLMs with a novel sorting method to address the multi-level function call relationships within repositories. Furthermore, by applying our proposed method across a range of... | Rui Li, Qi Liu, Liyang He, Zheng Zhang, Hao Zhang, Shengyu Ye, Junyu Lu, Zhenya Huang |  |

Recently, the use of prompts or adapters for efficient transfer learning (ETL) has gained significant attention for effectively adapting to downstream tasks. However, previous studies have overlooked the challenge of varying transfer difficulty of downstream tasks. In this paper, we empirically analyze how each ETL method behaves with respect to transfer difficulty. Our observations indicate that utilizing vision prompts and text adapters is crucial for adaptability and generalizability in domains with high difficulty. Also, by applying an adaptive ensemble approach that integrates task-adapted VLMs with pre-trained VLMs and strategically leverages more general knowledge in low-difficulty and less in high-difficulty domains, we consistently enhance performance across both types of domains. Based on these observations, we... | Yongjin Yang, Jongwoo Ko, SeYoung Yun |  |

Some methods have proven effective in boosting accuracy by introducing extra verifiers to assess these paths. However, existing verifiers, typically trained on binary-labeled reasoning paths, fail to fully utilize the relative merits of intermediate steps, thereby limiting the effectiveness of the feedback provided. To overcome this limitation, we propose Tree-based Preference Learning Verifier (Tree-PLV), a novel approach that constructs reasoning trees via a best-first search algorithm and collects step-level paired data for preference training. Compared to traditional binary classification, step-level preferences more finely capture the nuances between reasoning steps, allowing for a more precise evaluation of the complete reasoning path. We empirically evaluate Tree-PLV across a range of arithmetic and commonsense reasoning tasks, where it... | Mingqian He, Yongliang Shen, Wenqi Zhang, Zeqi Tan, Weiming Lu |  |

Recent studies are exploring transforming user inputs to obfuscated embedded vectors, so that the data will not be eavesdropped by service provides. However, in this paper we show that again, without a solid and deliberate security design and analysis, such embedded vector obfuscation failed to protect users’ privacy. We demonstrate the conclusion via conducting a novel inversion attack called Element-wise Differential Nearest Neighbor (EDNN) on the glide-reflection proposed in (CITATION), and the result showed that the original user input text can be 100% recovered from the obfuscated embedded vectors. We further analyze security requirements on embedding obfuscation and present several remedies to our proposed attack. | Yu Lin, Qizhi Zhang, Quanwei Cai, Jue Hong, Wu Ye, Huiqi Liu, Bing Duan |  |

However, the development of automatic video metrics is lagging significantly behind. None of the existing metric is able to provide reliable scores over generated videos. The main barrier is the lack of large-scale human-annotated dataset. In this paper, we release VideoFeedback, the first large-scale dataset containing human-provided multi-aspect score over 37.6K synthesized videos from 11 existing video generative models. We train VideoScore (initialized from Mantis)based on VideoFeedback to enable automatic video quality assessment. Experiments show that the Spearman’s correlation betweenVideoScore and humans can reach 77.1 on VideoFeedback-test, beating the prior best metrics by about 50 points. Further result onother held-out EvalCrafter, GenAI-Bench, and VBench show that VideoScore has consistently much higher correlation with humanjudges than other metrics.

Despite LLMs’ prowess in tasks like writing assistance, code generation, and machine translation, assessing their ability to reason has been challenging. Traditional evaluations often prioritize accuracy on downstream tasks over direct assessments of reasoning processes. LogicAsker addresses this gap by employing a set of atomic reasoning skills grounded in propositional and predicate logic to systematically examine and improve the reasoning prowess of LLMs. Our methodology reveals significant gaps in LLMs’ learning of logical rules, with identified reasoning failures ranging from 29% to 90% across different models. Moreover, we leverage these findings to construct targeted demonstration examples and fine-tune data, notably enhancing logical reasoning in models like GPT-4o by up to 5%.

However, existing pre-training methods solely focus on exploiting the textual knowledge, relying extensively on annotated large-scale datasets, which is labor-intensive and thus limits the scalability and versatility of the resulting models. To address these issues, we propose SKIE, a novel pre-training framework tailored for IE that integrates structural semantic knowledge via contrastive learning, effectively alleviating the annotation burden. Specifically, SKIE utilizes Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) as a low-cost supervision source to boost model performance without human intervention. By enhancing the topology of AMR graphs, SKIE derives high-quality cohesive subgraphs as additional training samples, providing diverse multi-level structural semantic knowledge. Furthermore, SKIE refines the graph encoder... | Xiaoyang Yi, Yuru Bao, Jian Zhang, Yifang Qin, Faxin Lin |  |

Previous solutions have primarily focused on single PLM settings, where synthetic datasets are typically restricted to specific sub-spaces and often deviate from real-world distributions, leading to severe distribution bias. To mitigate such bias, we propose FuseGen, a novel data-generation based zero-shot learning framework that introduces a new criteria for subset selection from synthetic datasets via utilizing multiple PLMs and trained STMs. The chosen subset provides in-context feedback to each PLM, enhancing dataset quality through iterative data generation. Trained STMs are then used for sample re-weighting as well, further improving data quality. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate that FuseGen substantially outperforms... | Tianyuan Zou, Yang Liu, Peng Li, Jianqing Zhang, Jingjing Liu, YaQin Zhang |  |

We propose metrics to evaluate the trade-off between performance improvements and user burden, and investigate whether LLMs can determine when to request help under varying information availability. Our experiments show that without external feedback, many LLMs struggle to recognize their need for user support.

However, utilizing LLMs for ubiquitous sensing applications remains challenging as existing text-prompt methods show significant performance degradation when handling long sensor data sequences. In this paper, we propose a visual prompting approach for sensor data using multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Specifically, we design a visual prompt that directs MLLMs to utilize visualized sensor data alongside descriptions of the target sensory task. Additionally, we introduce a visualization generator that automates the creation of optimal visualizations tailored to a given sensory task, eliminating the need for prior task-specific knowledge. We evaluated our approach on nine sensory tasks involving four sensing modalities, achieving an average of 10% higher accuracy compared to text-based prompts and reducing token costs by 15.8 times.

Conventional remedies, e.g., mixing precisions for different channels, introduce extra overhead and reduce the speedup. In this work, we develop a simple yet effective strategy to facilitate per-tensor activation quantization by preventing the generation of problematic tokens. Precisely, we propose a method to find a set of key-value cache, coined _CushionCache_, which mitigates outliers in subsequent tokens when inserted as a prefix. CushionCache works in two steps: First, we greedily search for a prompt token sequence that minimizes the maximum activation values in subsequent tokens. Then, we further tune the token cache to regularize the activations of subsequent tokens to be more quantization-friendly. The proposed method successfully addresses activation outliers of LLMs, providing a substantial performance boost for per-tensor activation quantization... | Seungwoo Son, Wonpyo Park, Woohyun Han, Kyuyeun Kim, Jaeho Lee |  |

We introduce CHIQ, a two-step method that leverages the capabilities of LLMs to resolve ambiguities in the conversation history before query rewriting. This approach contrasts with prior studies that predominantly use closed-source LLMs to directly generate search queries from conversation history. We demonstrate on five well-established benchmarks that CHIQ leads to state-of-the-art results across most settings, showing highly competitive performances with systems leveraging closed-source LLMs. Our study provides a first step towards leveraging open-source LLMs in conversational search, as a competitive alternative to the prevailing reliance on commercial LLMs. Data, models, and source code will be publicly available upon acceptance at https://github.com/fengranMark/CHIQ. | Fengran Mo, Abbas Ghaddar, Kelong Mao, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Boxing Chen, Qun Liu, JianYun Nie |  |

Due to the dynamic nature of memes, existing data-driven models may struggle in low-resource scenarios where only a few labeled examples are available. In this paper, we propose an agency-driven framework for low-resource harmful meme detection, employing both outward and inward analysis with few-shot annotated samples. Inspired by the powerful capacity of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) on multimodal reasoning, we first retrieve relative memes with annotations to leverage label information as auxiliary signals for the LMM agent. Then, we elicit knowledge-revising behavior within the LMM agent to derive well-generalized insights into meme harmfulness. By combining these strategies, our approach enables dialectical reasoning over intricate and implicit harm-indicative patterns. Extensive experiments conducted on three meme datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach... | Jianzhao Huang, Hongzhan Lin, Ziyan Liu, Ziyang Luo, Guang Chen, Jing Ma |  |

While most large vision-language models (VLMs) focus on physical-level skills, our work is the first to examine their multimodal capabilities in leveraging human values to make decisions under a vision-depicted situation. VIVA contains 1,062 images depicting diverse real-world situations and the manually annotated decisions grounded in them. Given an image there, the model should select the most appropriate action to address the situation and provide the relevant human values and reason underlying the decision. Extensive experiments based on VIVA show the limitation of VLMs in using human values to make multimodal decisions. Further analyses indicate the potential benefits of exploiting action consequences and predicted human values. | Zhe Hu, Yixiao Ren, Jing Li, Yu Yin |  |

Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a promising technique for this adaptation with the alleviation of compounding errors, offering a means to directly optimize Reinforcement Learning (RL) objectives. However, applying DPO to multi-turn tasks presents challenges due to the inability to cancel the partition function. Overcoming this obstacle involves making the partition function independent of the current state and addressing length disparities between preferred and dis-preferred trajectories. In this light, we replace the policy constraint with the state-action occupancy measure constraint in the RL objective and add length normalization to the Bradley-Terry model, yielding a novel loss function named DMPO for multi-turn agent tasks with theoretical explanations. Extensive experiments on three multi-turn agent task datasets confirm the effectiveness and superiority of the DMPO loss. | Wentao Shi, Mengqi Yuan, Junkang Wu, Qifan Wang, Fuli Feng |  |

In this work, we take the first step towards evaluating LLMs in the long-tail distribution of inferential knowledge. We exemplify long-tail evaluation on the Natural Language Inference task. First, we introduce Logic-Induced-Knowledge-Search (LINK), a systematic long-tail data generation framework, to obtain factually-correct yet long-tail inferential statements. LINK uses variable-wise prompting grounded on symbolic rules to seek low-confidence statements while ensuring factual correctness. We then use LINK to curate Logic-Induced-Long-Tail (LINT), a large-scale long-tail inferential knowledge dataset that contains 108K statements spanning four domains. We evaluate popular LLMs on LINT; we find that state-of-the-art LLMs show significant performance drop (21% relative drop for GPT4) on... | Huihan Li, Yuting Ning, Zeyi Liao, Siyuan Wang, Xiang Li, Ximing Lu, Wenting Zhao, Faeze Brahman, Yejin Choi, Xiang Ren |  |

Existing methods, wrappers-based methods suffer from limited adaptability and scalability when faced with a new website, while language agents, empowered by large language models (LLMs), exhibit poor reusability in diverse web environments. In this work, we introduce the paradigm of generating web scrapers with LLMs and propose AutoScraper, a two-stage framework that can handle diverse and changing web environments more efficiently. AutoScraper leverages the hierarchical structure of HTML and similarity across different web pages for generating web scrapers. Besides, we propose a new executability metric for better measuring the performance of web scraper generation tasks.

Recent interpretability methods project weights and hidden states obtained from the forward pass to the models’ vocabularies, helping to uncover how information flows within LMs. In this work, we extend this methodology to LMs’ backward pass and gradients. We first prove that a gradient matrix can be cast as a low-rank linear combination of its forward and backward passes’ inputs. We then develop methods to project these gradients into vocabulary items and explore the mechanics of how new information is stored in the LMs’ neurons. | Shahar Katz, Yonatan Belinkov, Mor Geva, Lior Wolf |  |

Understanding these arguments requires selective vision: only specific visual stimuli within an image are relevant to the argument, and relevance can only be understood within the context of a broader argumentative structure. While visual arguments are readily appreciated by human audiences, we ask: are today’s AI capable of similar understanding?We present VisArgs, a dataset of 1,611 images annotated with 5,112 visual premises (with regions), 5,574 commonsense premises, and reasoning trees connecting them into structured arguments. We propose three tasks for evaluating visual argument understanding: premise localization, premise identification, and conclusion deduction.Experiments show that 1) machines struggle to capture visual cues: GPT-4-O achieved 78.5% accuracy, while humans reached 98.0%. Models also performed 19.5% worse when distinguishing between... | Jiwan Chung, Sungjae Lee, Minseo Kim, Seungju Han, Ashkan Yousefpour, Jack Hessel, Youngjae Yu |  |

Let visual puns tell you!](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.144) |  | 0 | Humans possess multimodal literacy, allowing them to actively integrate information from various modalities to form reasoning. Faced with challenges like lexical ambiguity in text, we supplement this with other modalities, such as thumbnail images or textbook illustrations. Is it possible for machines to achieve a similar multimodal understanding capability?In response, we present Understanding Pun with Image Explanations (UNPIE), a novel benchmark designed to assess the impact of multimodal inputs in resolving lexical ambiguities. Puns serve as the ideal subject for this evaluation due to their intrinsic ambiguity. Our dataset includes 1,000 puns, each accompanied by an image that explains both meanings. We pose three multimodal challenges with the annotations to assess different aspects of multimodal literacy; Pun Grounding, Disambiguation, and Reconstruction. The results indicate that various Socratic Models and Visual-Language Models improve over the text-only models when given... | Jiwan Chung, Seungwon Lim, Jaehyun Jeon, Seungbeen Lee, Youngjae Yu |  |

In real-world scenarios, not all styles have abundant resources. This work introduces TWIST (reusing Transferable Weight Increments for Style Text generation), a novel framework to mitigate data scarcity by utilizing style features in weight increments to transfer low-resource styles effectively. During target style learning, we derive knowledge via a specially designed weight pool and initialize the parameters for the unseen style. To enhance the effectiveness of merging, the target style weight increments are often merged from multiple source style weight increments through singular vectors. Considering the diversity of styles, we also designed a multi-key memory network that simultaneously focuses on task- and instance-level information to derive the most relevant weight increments. Results from multiple style transfer datasets show that TWIST... | Chunzhen Jin, Eliot Huang, Heng Chang, Yaqi Wang, Peng Cao, Osmar R. Zaïane |  |

However, it is unclear whether these LLM-based evaluators can be effectively applied in real-world classrooms to assess student assignments. This empirical report shares how we use GPT-4 as an automatic assignment evaluator in a university course with over 1000 students. Based on student responses, we found that LLM-based assignment evaluators are generally acceptable to students when they have free access to these tools. However, students also noted that the LLM sometimes fails to adhere to the evaluation instructions, resulting in unreasonable assessments. Additionally, we observed that students can easily manipulate the LLM to output specific strings, allowing them to achieve high scores without meeting the assignment rubric. Based on student feedback and our experience, we offer several recommendations for effectively integrating LLMs into future classroom... | ChengHan Chiang, WeiChih Chen, ChunYi Kuan, Chienchou Yang, Hungyi Lee |  |

In this paper we focus on multi-hop reasoning—the ability to identify and integrate information from multiple textual sources.Given the concerns with the presence of simplifying cues in existing multi-hop reasoning benchmarks, which allow models to circumvent the reasoning requirement, we set out to investigate whether LLMs are prone to exploiting such simplifying cues. We find evidence that they indeed circumvent the requirement to perform multi-hop reasoning, but they do so in more subtle ways than what was reported about their fine-tuned pre-trained language model (PLM) predecessors. We propose a challenging multi-hop reasoning benchmark by generating seemingly plausible multi-hop reasoning chains that ultimately lead to incorrect answers. We evaluate... | Neeladri Bhuiya, Viktor Schlegel, Stefan Winkler |  |

However, supervised multitask learning still holds significant promise, as scaling it in the post-training stage trends towards better generalization. In this paper, we explore supervised multitask pre-training by proposing Instruction Pre-training, a framework that scalably augments massive raw corpora with instruction-response pairs to pre-train LMs. The instruction-response pairs are generated by an efficient instruction synthesizer built on open-source models. In our experiments, we synthesize 200M instruction response pairs covering 40+ task categories to verify the effectiveness of Instruction Pre-training. In pre-training from scratch, Instruction Pre-training not only consistently enhances pre-trained base models but also benefits more from further instruction tuning. In continual pre-training, Instruction Pre-training enables Llama3-8B to be comparable to or... | Daixuan Cheng, Yuxian Gu, Shaohan Huang, Junyu Bi, Minlie Huang, Furu Wei |  |

While recent years have witnessed the development of various techniques for single and batch editing, these methods either fail to apply or perform sub-optimally when faced with lifelong editing. In this paper, we introduce LEMoE, an advanced Mixture of Experts (MoE) adaptor for lifelong model editing. We first analyze the factors influencing the effectiveness of conventional MoE adaptor in lifelong editing, including catastrophic forgetting, inconsistent routing and order sensitivity. Based on these insights, we propose a tailored module insertion method to achieve lifelong editing, incorporating a novel KV anchor routing to enhance routing consistency between training and inference stage, along with a concise yet effective clustering-based editing order planning. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness... | Renzhi Wang, Piji Li |  |

The pioneering scaling law on downstream works demonstrated intrinsic similarities within model families and utilized such similarities for performance prediction. However, they tend to overlook the similarities between model families and only consider design factors listed in the original scaling law. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel framework, Collaborative Performance Prediction (CPP), which significantly enhances prediction accuracy by leveraging the historical performance of various models on downstream tasks and other design factors for both model and task. We also collect a collaborative data sourced from online platforms containing both historical performance and additional design factors. With the support of the collaborative data, CPP not only surpasses traditional scaling laws... | Qiyuan Zhang, Fuyuan Lyu, Xue Liu, Chen Ma |  |

Humans have produced texts in various languages for thousands of years; however, most of the computational literature is focused on contemporary languages and corpora. The emerging field of historical psychology relies on computational techniques to extract aspects of psychology from historical corpora using new methods developed in natural language processing (NLP). The present pipeline, called Contextualized Construct Representations (CCR), combines expert knowledge in psychometrics (i.e., psychological surveys) with text representations generated via Transformer-based language models to measure psychological constructs such as traditionalism, norm strength, and collectivism in classical Chinese corpora. Considering the scarcity of available data, we propose an indirect supervised contrastive learning approach and build the first Chinese historical psychology corpus (C-HI-PSY) to... | Yuqi Chen, Sixuan Li, Ying Li, Mohammad Atari |  |

In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of mitigating hallucinations by verifying and minimizing the inconsistency between external knowledge present in the alignment data and the intrinsic knowledge embedded within foundation LLMs. Specifically, we propose a novel approach called Knowledge Consistent Alignment (KCA), which employs a well-aligned LLM to automatically formulate assessments based on external knowledge to evaluate the knowledge boundaries of foundation LLMs. To address knowledge inconsistencies in the alignment data, KCA implements several specific strategies to deal with these data instances. We demonstrate the superior efficacy of KCA in reducing hallucinations across six benchmarks, utilizing foundation LLMs of... | Fanqi Wan, Xinting Huang, Leyang Cui, Xiaojun Quan, Wei Bi, Shuming Shi |  |

It requires consolidating a set of rule-like premises that are often associated with degrees of uncertainty and observations to draw conclusions. In this work, we address both the case where premises are specified as numeric probabilistic rules and situations in which humans state their estimates using words expressing degrees of certainty. Existing probabilistic reasoning datasets simplify the task, e.g., by requiring the model to only rank textual alternatives, by including only binary random variables, or by making use of a limited set of templates that result in less varied text.In this work, we present QUITE, a question answering dataset of real-world Bayesian reasoning scenarios with categorical random variables and complex relationships. QUITE provides high-quality natural language verbalizations of premises together with evidence statements and expects the answer to a question in the form of an estimated probability.

Benchmarking Large Vision-Language Models for Fine-Grained Object Classification](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.154) |  | 0 | Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate impressive abilities on numerous image understanding and reasoning tasks. The task of fine-grained object classification (e.g., distinction between animal species), however, has been probed insufficiently, despite its downstream importance. We fill this evaluation gap by creating FOCI (Fine-grained Object ClassIfication), a difficult multiple-choice benchmark for fine-grained object classification, from existing object classification datasets: (1) multiple-choice avoids ambiguous answers associated with casting classification as open-ended QA task; (2) we retain classification difficulty by mining negative labels with a CLIP model. FOCI complements five popular classification datasets with four domain-specific subsets from ImageNet-21k. We benchmark 12 public LVLMs on and show that it tests for a complementary skill to established image understanding and reasoning benchmarks. Crucially, CLIP models exhibit dramatically better... | Gregor Geigle, Radu Timofte, Goran Glavas |  |

A significant type of this issue is the false premise hallucination, which we define as the phenomenon when LLMs generate hallucinated text when confronted with false premise questions. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the false premise hallucination and elucidate its internal working mechanism: a small subset of attention heads (which we designate as false premise heads) disturb the knowledge extraction process, leading to the occurrence of false premise hallucination. Based on our analysis, we propose FAITH (False premise Attention head constraIining for miTigating Hallucinations), a novel and effective method to mitigate false premise hallucinations. It constrains the false premise attention heads during the model inference process. Impressively, extensive experiments demonstrate that constraining only approximately 1% of the attention heads in the... | Hongbang Yuan, Pengfei Cao, Zhuoran Jin, Yubo Chen, Daojian Zeng, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao |  |

While both phenomena are widely documented in lexical resources and have been studied extensively in NLP,leading to dedicated systems, they are often being consideredindependently in practictal problems. While many tasks dealing with polysemy (e.g. Word SenseDisambiguiation or Induction) highlight the role of word’s senses,the study of synonymy is rooted in the study of concepts, i.e. meaningsshared across the lexicon. In this paper, we introduce ConceptInduction, the unsupervised task of learning a soft clustering amongwords that defines a set of concepts directly from data. This taskgeneralizes Word Sense Induction. We propose a bi-levelapproach to Concept Induction that leverages both a locallemma-centric view and a global cross-lexicon view to induceconcepts. We evaluate the obtained clustering on SemCor’s annotateddata and obtain good performance (BCubed F1 above0.60). We find that the local and the... | Bastien Liétard, Pascal Denis, Mikaela Keller |  |

Recent studies found that attaching suffixes to harmful instructions can hack the defense of LLMs and lead to dangerous outputs. However, similar to traditional text adversarial attacks, this approach, while effective, is limited by the challenge of the discrete tokens. This gradient based discrete optimization attack requires over 100,000 LLM calls, and due to the unreadable of adversarial suffixes, it can be relatively easily penetrated by common defense methods such as perplexity filters.To cope with this challenge, in this paper, we propose an Adversarial Suffix Embedding Translation Framework (ASETF), aimed at transforming continuous adversarial suffix embeddings into coherent and understandable text. This method greatly reduces the computational overhead during the attack... | Hao Wang, Hao Li, Minlie Huang, Lei Sha |  |

Our survey on 52 recent such systems uncovers a severe lack of diversity, with a heavy reliance on dictatorial and plurality voting for CDM. Through the lens of social choice theory, we scrutinize widely-adopted CDM methods and identify their limitations. To enrich current landscape of LLM-based CDM, we present GEDI, an electoral CDM module that incorporates various ordinal preferential voting mechanisms. Our empirical case study across three benchmarks shows that the integration of certain CDM methods can markedly improve the reasoning capabilities and robustness of some leading LLMs, all without requiring intricate system designs. Additionally, we find that some CDM mechanisms generate positive synergies even with as few as three agents. The voting-based methods also demonstrate... | Xiutian Zhao, Ke Wang, Wei Peng |  |

LVLMs, however, often hallucinate and produce captions that mention concepts that cannot be found in the image. These hallucinations erode the trustworthiness of LVLMs and are arguably among the main obstacles to their ubiquitous adoption. Recent work suggests that addition of grounding objectives—those that explicitly align image regions or objects to text spans—reduces the amount of LVLM hallucination. Although intuitive, this claim is not empirically justified as the reduction effects have been established, we argue, with flawed evaluation protocols that (i) rely on data (i.e., MSCOCO) that has been extensively used in LVLM training and (ii) measure hallucination via question answering rather than open-ended caption generation.In this work, in contrast, we offer the first systematic analysis of the... | Gregor Geigle, Radu Timofte, Goran Glavas |  |

Progressive In-Context Learning for Effective Alignment](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.160) |  | 0 | Recent studies have explored the working mechanisms of In-Context Learning (ICL). However, they mainly focus on classification and simple generation tasks, limiting their broader application to more complex generation tasks in practice. To address this gap, we investigate the impact of demonstrations on token representations within the practical alignment tasks. We find that the transformer embeds the task function learned from demonstrations into the separator token representation, which plays an important role in the generation of prior response tokens. Once the prior response tokens are determined, the demonstrations become redundant. Motivated by this finding, we propose an efficient Progressive In-Context Alignment (PICA) method consisting of two stages. In the first few-shot stage, the model generates several prior response tokens via standard ICL while concurrently extracting the ICL vector that stores the task function from the separator token representation. In the following... | Zhenyu Liu, Dongfang Li, Xinshuo Hu, Xinping Zhao, Yibin Chen, Baotian Hu, Min Zhang |  |

Traditional fine-tuning methods often exhibit instability in multi-task learning and rely heavily on extensive training resources. Here, we propose MoDULA (Mixture of Domain-Specific and Universal LoRA), a novel Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) paradigm for improved fine-tuning and parameter efficiency in multi-task learning. The paradigm effectively improves the multi-task capability of the model by training universal experts, domain-specific experts, and routers separately. MoDULA-Res is a new method within the MoDULA paradigm, which maintains the model’s general capability by connecting universal and task-specific experts through residual connections. The experimental results demonstrate that the overall performance of the MoDULA-Flan and MoDULA-Res methods surpasses that of... | Yufei Ma, Zihan Liang, Huangyu Dai, Ben Chen, Dehong Gao, Zhuoran Ran, Zihan Wang, Linbo Jin, Wen Jiang, Guannan Zhang, Xiaoyan Cai, Libin Yang |  |

Current methods typically aggregate numerous token embeddings of a sentence into a single vector, which, while being an efficient compressor, may not fully capture complex semantic and temporal distributions. To solve this problem, we propose SEmantic ANchor Graph Neural Networks (SEAN-GNN) for fine-grained emotion classification. It learns a group of representative, multi-faceted semantic anchors in the token embedding space: using these anchors as a global reference, any sentence can be projected onto them to form a “semantic-anchor graph”, with node attributes and edge weights quantifying the semantic and temporal information respectively. The graph structure is well aligned across sentences and, importantly, allows for generating comprehensive emotion representations regarding K different... | Pinyi Zhang, Jingyang Chen, Junchen Shen, Zijie Zhai, Ping Li, Jie Zhang, Kai Zhang |  |

Despite these requirements align closely with strengths of recent successful Large Language Models (LLMs), the scarcity of high-quality, specialized training data has hindered direct applications. To bridge this gap, we curated the PhiloCorpus-ZH, a rich collec-tion of ancient Chinese texts spanning a millen-nium with 30 diverse topics, including firsthand folk copies. This corpus facilitated the develop-ment of PhiloGPT, the first LLM tailored for discovering ancient Chinese manuscripts. To effectively tackle complex philological tasks like restoration, attribution, and linguistic anal-ysis, we introduced the PhiloCoP framework. Modeled on the analytical patterns of philol-ogists, PhiloCoP enhances LLM’s handling of historical linguistic peculiarities such as phonetic loans, polysemy, and syntactic inver-sions.

While prior defenses mitigate these risks by perturbing or inspecting inputs, they ignore competing objectives, the underlying cause of alignment failures. In this paper, we propose Alignment-Enhanced Decoding (AED), a novel defense that employs adaptive decoding to address the root causes of jailbreak issues. We first define the Competitive Index to quantify alignment failures and utilize feedback from self-evaluation to compute post-alignment logits. Then, AED adaptively combines Competitive Index and post-alignment logits with the original logits to obtain harmless and helpful distributions. Consequently, our method enhances safety alignment while maintaining helpfulness. We conduct experiments across five models and four common jailbreaks, with the results validating the effectiveness of our approach. | Quan Liu, Zhenhong Zhou, Longzhu He, Yi Liu, Wei Zhang, Sen Su |  |

Existing approaches within the pretraining-finetuning paradigm tend to either meticulously craft complex tagging schemes and classification heads, or incorporate external semantic augmentation to enhance performance. In this study, we, for the first time, re-evaluate the redundancy in tagging schemes and the internal enhancement in pretrained representations. We propose a method to improve and utilize pretrained representations by integrating a minimalist tagging scheme and a novel token-level contrastive learning strategy. The proposed approach demonstrates comparable or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques while featuring a more compact design and reduced computational overhead. Additionally, we are the first to formally evaluate GPT-4’s performance in few-shot learning and Chain-of-Thought scenarios for this task. The results demonstrate that the... | Qiao Sun, Liujia Yang, Minghao Ma, Nanyang Ye, Qinying Gu |  |

However, to the best of our knowledge, there is a lack of comprehensive studies evaluating these models’ linguistic abilities independent of specific tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel evaluation methodology designed to test LLMs’ sentence generation abilities under specific linguistic constraints. Drawing on the ‘linguistic profiling’ approach, we rigorously investigate the extent to which five LLMs of varying sizes, tested in both zero- and few-shot scenarios, effectively adhere to (morpho)syntactic constraints. Our findings shed light on the linguistic proficiency of LLMs, revealing both their capabilities and limitations in generating linguistically-constrained sentences. | Alessio Miaschi, Felice Dell'Orletta, Giulia Venturi |  |

However, an understudied question is to what extent models that only have access to vision and text modalities are able to implicitly understand sound-based phenomena via abstract reasoning from orthography and imagery alone. To investigate this, we analyse the ability of VLMs and LLMs to demonstrate sound symbolism (i.e., to recognise a non-arbitrary link between sounds and concepts) as well as their ability to “hear” via the interplay of the language and vision modules of open and closed-source multimodal models. We perform multiple experiments, including replicating the classic Kiki-Bouba and Mil-Mal shape and magnitude symbolism tasks and comparing human judgements of linguistic iconicity with that of LLMs. Our results show that VLMs demonstrate varying levels of agreement with human... | Tyler Loakman, Yucheng Li, Chenghua Lin |  |

Nonetheless, PI typically relies on a large number of parallel question-program pairs to make the LLM aware of the schema of a given KB, and is thus challenging for many low-resourced KBs that lack annotated data. To this end, we propose KB-Plugin, a plug-and-play framework that enables LLMs to induce programs over any low-resourced KB. Firstly, KB-Plugin adopts self-supervised learning to encode the detailed schema information of a given KB into a pluggable module, namely schema plugin. Secondly, KB-Plugin utilizes abundant annotated data from a rich-resourced KB to train another pluggable module, namely PI plugin, which can help the LLM extract question-relevant schema information from the schema plugin of any KB and utilize the information to induce programs over this KB. Experiments show that KB-Plugin outperforms... | Jiajie Zhang, Shulin Cao, Linmei Hu, Ling Feng, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li |  |

Consequently, non-independencies remain between the estimated components, which ICA cannot eliminate. We quantified these non-independencies using higher-order correlations and demonstrated that when the higher-order correlation between two components is large, it indicates a strong semantic association between them, along with many words sharing common meanings with both components. The entire structure of non-independencies was visualized using a maximum spanning tree of semantic components. These findings provide deeper insights into embeddings through ICA. | Momose Oyama, Hiroaki Yamagiwa, Hidetoshi Shimodaira |  |

However, assessing the validity of explanations for NLI is challenging as it typically involves the crowd-sourcing of apposite datasets, a process that is time-consuming and prone to logical errors. To address existing limitations, this paper investigates the verification and refinement of natural language explanations through the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Theorem Provers (TPs). Specifically, we present a neuro-symbolic framework, named Explanation-Refiner, that integrates TPs with LLMs to generate and formalise explanatory sentences and suggest potential inference strategies for NLI. In turn, the TP is employed to provide formal guarantees on the logical validity of the explanations and to generate feedback for subsequent improvements. We demonstrate how Explanation-Refiner can be jointly used to evaluate explanatory reasoning,... | Xin Quan, Marco Valentino, Louise A. Dennis, André Freitas |  |

However, post-alignment, these language models often exhibit overconfidence, where the expressed confidence does not accurately calibrate with their correctness rate. In this paper, we decompose the language model confidence into the Uncertainty about the question and the Fidelity to the answer generated by language models. Then, we propose a plug-and-play method, UF Calibration, to estimate the confidence of language models. Our method has shown good calibration performance by conducting experiments with 6 RLHF-LMs on four MCQA datasets. Moreover, we propose two novel metrics, IPR and CE, to evaluate the calibration of the model, and we have conducted a detailed discussion on Truly Well-Calibrated Confidence for large language models. Our method could serve as a strong baseline, and we hope that this work will provide some insights into the model confidence... | Mozhi Zhang, Mianqiu Huang, Rundong Shi, Linsen Guo, Chong Peng, Peng Yan, Yaqian Zhou, Xipeng Qiu |  |

A critical factor in this alignment is the strength of reward models used during training. This study explores whether stronger reward models invariably lead to better language models. In this paper, through experiments on relevance, factuality, and completeness tasks using the QA-FEEDBACK dataset and reward models based on Longformer, we uncover a surprising paradox: language models trained with moderately accurate reward models outperform those guided by highly accurate ones. This challenges the widely held belief that stronger reward models always lead to better language models, and opens up new avenues for future research into the key factors driving model performance and how to choose the most suitable reward models. | Yanjun Chen, Dawei Zhu, Yirong Sun, Xinghao Chen, Wei Zhang, Xiaoyu Shen |  |

NLI Characterization by Exploiting Training Dynamics](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.175) |  | 0 | Natural Language Inference (NLI) evaluation is crucial for assessing language understanding models; however, popular datasets suffer from systematic spurious correlations that artificially inflate actual model performance. To address this, we propose a method for the automated creation of a challenging test set without relying on the manual construction of artificial and unrealistic examples. We categorize the test set of popular NLI datasets into three difficulty levels by leveraging methods that exploit training dynamics. This categorization significantly reduces spurious correlation measures, with examples labeled as having the highest difficulty showing markedly decreased performance and encompassing more realistic and diverse linguistic phenomena. When our characterization method is applied to the training set, models trained with only a fraction of the data achieve comparable performance to those trained on the full dataset, surpassing other dataset characterization techniques.... | Adrian Cosma, Stefan Ruseti, Mihai Dascalu, Cornelia Caragea |  |

However, these annotations are unavailable in many low-resource languages. In this paper, we investigate GED in this context. Leveraging the zero-shot cross-lingual transfer capabilities of multilingual pre-trained language models, we train a model using data from a diverse set of languages to generate synthetic errors in other languages. These synthetic error corpora are then used to train a GED model. Specifically we propose a two-stage fine-tuning pipeline where the GED model is first fine-tuned on multilingual synthetic data from target languages followed by fine-tuning on human-annotated GED corpora from source languages. This approach outperforms current state-of-the-art annotation-free GED methods. We also analyse the errors produced by our method and other strong baselines, finding that our approach produces errors that are more diverse and more similar to human errors. | Gaetan Latouche, MarcAndré Carbonneau, Benjamin Swanson |  |

Most LLMs split text into multi-character tokens and process them as atomic units without direct access to individual characters. This raises the question: To what extent can LLMs learn orthographic information? To answer this, we propose a new benchmark, CUTE, which features a collection of tasks designed to test the orthographic knowledge of LLMs. We evaluate popular LLMs on CUTE, finding that most of them seem to know the spelling of their tokens, yet fail to use this information effectively to manipulate text, calling into question how much of this knowledge is generalizable. | Lukas Edman, Helmut Schmid, Alexander Fraser |  |

Existing methods heavily rely on heuristic-based augmentation, encountering several issues: (1) Poor generalization due to hand-crafted context filtering; (2) Semantics deficiency due to rule-based context chunking; (3) Skewed length due to sentence-wise filter learning. To address these issues, we propose a model-based evidence extraction learning framework, SEER, optimizing a vanilla model as an evidence extractor with desired properties through self-aligned learning. Extensive experiments show that our method largely improves the final RAG performance, enhances the faithfulness, helpfulness, and conciseness of the extracted evidence, and reduces the evidence length by 9.25 times. The code will be available at https://github.com/HITsz-TMG/SEER. | Xinping Zhao, Dongfang Li, Yan Zhong, Boren Hu, Yibin Chen, Baotian Hu, Min Zhang |  |

Our proposals build on surprisal theory, which posits that the processing effort of a linguistic unit (e.g., a word) is an affine function of its in-context information content. We first observe that surprisal is only one out of many potential ways that a contextual predictor can be derived from a language model. Another one is the pointwise mutual information (PMI) between a unit and its context, which turns out to yield the same predictive power as surprisal when controlling for unigram frequency. Moreover, both PMI and surprisal are correlated with frequency. This means that neither PMI nor surprisal contains information about context alone. In response to this, we propose a technique where we project surprisal onto the orthogonal complement of frequency, yielding a new contextual predictor that is uncorrelated with frequency. Our experiments show that the proportion of variance... | Andreas Opedal, Eleanor Chodroff, Ryan Cotterell, Ethan Wilcox |  |

Previous methods resort to neural models for proofstep generation and search. However, they suffer from exploring possible proofsteps empirically in a large search space. Moreover, they directly use a less rigorous informal proof for proofstep generation, neglecting the incomplete reasoning within. In this paper, we propose BC-Prover, a backward chaining framework guided by pseudo steps. Specifically, BC-Prover prioritizes pseudo steps to proofstep generation. The pseudo steps boost the proof construction in two aspects: (1) Backward Chaining that decomposes the proof into sub-goals for goal-oriented exploration. (2) Step Planning that makes a fine-grained planning to bridge the gap between informal and formal proofs. Experiments on the miniF2F benchmark show significant performance gains by our framework over the... | Yuhang He, Jihai Zhang, Jianzhu Bao, Fangquan Lin, Cheng Yang, Bing Qin, Ruifeng Xu, Wotao Yin |  |

Despite growing interest in the subfield, a criticism of this work is that it lacks actionable insights and therefore has little impact on NLP. In this paper, we seek to quantify the impact of IA research on the broader field of NLP. We approach this with a mixed-methods analysis of: (1) a citation graph of 185K+ papers built from all papers published at ACL and EMNLP conferences from 2018 to 2023, and their references and citations, and (2) a survey of 138 members of the NLP community. Our quantitative results show that IA work is well-cited outside of IA, and central in the NLP citation graph. Through qualitative analysis of survey responses and manual annotation of 556 papers, we find that NLP researchers build on findings from IA work and perceive it as important for progress in NLP, multiple... | Marius Mosbach, Vagrant Gautam, Tomás Vergara Browne, Dietrich Klakow, Mor Geva |  |

In this paper, we explore the dual modality of language—both visual and textual—within an autoregressive framework, pre-trained on both document images and texts. Our method employs a multimodal training strategy, utilizing visual data through next patch prediction with a regression head and/or textual data through next token prediction with a classification head. We focus on understanding the interaction between these two modalities and their combined impact on model performance. Our extensive evaluation across a wide range of benchmarks shows that incorporating both visual and textual data significantly improves the performance of pixel-based language models. Remarkably, we find that a unidirectional pixel-based model trained solely on visual data can achieve comparable results to state-of-the-art bidirectional models on several language understanding tasks.

This paper presents GPTfluence, a novel approach that leverages a featurized simulation to assess the impact of training examples on the training dynamics of GPT models. Our approach not only traces the influence of individual training instances on performance trajectories, such as loss and other key metrics, on targeted test points but also enables a comprehensive comparison with existing methods across various training scenarios in GPT models, ranging from 14 million to 2.8 billion parameters, across a range of downstream tasks. Contrary to earlier methods that struggle with generalization to new data, GPTfluence introduces a parameterized simulation of training dynamics, demonstrating robust generalization capabilities to unseen training data. This adaptability is evident across both fine-tuning and instruction-tuning scenarios,... | Yekun Chai, Qingyi Liu, Shuohuan Wang, Yu Sun, Qiwei Peng, Hua Wu |  |

In this paper, we seek to clarify how democratization is understood in NLP and ML publications, through large-scale mixed-methods analyses of papers using the keyword “democra\*” published in NLP and adjacent venues. We find that democratization is most frequently used to convey (ease of) access to or use of technologies, without meaningfully engaging with theories of democratization, while research using other invocations of “democra\*” tends to be grounded in theories of deliberation and debate. Based on our findings, we call for researchers to enrich their use of the term democratization with appropriate theory, towards democratic technologies beyond superficial access. | Arjun Subramonian, Vagrant Gautam, Dietrich Klakow, Zeerak Talat |  |

This study aims to enhance generalizability of small VDU models by distilling knowledge from LLMs. We identify that directly prompting LLMs often fails to generate informative and useful data. In response, we present a new framework (called DocKD) that enriches the data generation process by integrating external document knowledge. Specifically, we provide an LLM with various document elements like key-value pairs, layouts, and descriptions, to elicit open-ended answers. Our experiments show that DocKD produces high-quality document annotations and surpasses the direct knowledge distillation approach that does not leverage external document knowledge. Moreover, student VDU models trained with solely DocKD-generated data is not only comparable to those trained with human-annotated data on in-domain tasks but also... | Sungnyun Kim, Haofu Liao, Srikar Appalaraju, Peng Tang, Zhuowen Tu, Ravi Kumar Satzoda, R.

Despite its importance, most existing datasets predominantly focus on English, resulting in a considerable gap in data availability for other languages. Cross-lingual transfer for QG (XLT-QG) addresses this limitation by allowing models trained on high-resource language datasets to generate questions in low-resource languages. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient XLT-QG method that operates without the need for monolingual, parallel, or labeled data in the target language, utilizing a small language model. Our model, trained solely on English QA datasets, learns interrogative structures from a limited set of question exemplars, which are then applied to generate questions in the target language. Experimental results show that our method outperforms several XLT-QG baselines and achieves... | Seonjeong Hwang, Yunsu Kim, Gary Geunbae Lee |  |

Unfortunately, existing quality filtering methods rely on a known high-quality dataset as reference, which can introduce potential bias and compromise diversity. In this paper, we propose ScalingFilter, a novel approach that evaluates text quality based on the perplexity difference between two language models trained on the same data, thereby eliminating the influence of the reference dataset in the filtering process. An theoretical analysis shows that ScalingFilter is equivalent to an inverse utilization of scaling laws. Through training models with 1.3B parameters on the same data source processed by various quality filters, we find ScalingFilter can improve zero-shot performance of pre-trained models in downstream tasks. To assess the bias introduced by quality filtering, we introduce semantic diversity, a metric of utilizing text embedding models for semantic representations.

In this work, we mitigate the problem in an LLM-based MT model by guiding it to better word alignment. We first study the correlation between word alignment and the phenomena of hallucination and omission in MT. Then we propose to utilize word alignment as preference to optimize the LLM-based MT model. The preference data are constructed by selecting chosen and rejected translations from multiple MT tools. Subsequently, direct preference optimization is used to optimize the LLM-based model towards the preference signal. Given the absence of evaluators specifically designed for hallucination and omission in MT, we further propose selecting hard instances and utilizing GPT-4 to directly evaluate the performance of the models in mitigating these issues. We verify the... | Qiyu Wu, Masaaki Nagata, Zhongtao Miao, Yoshimasa Tsuruoka |  |

To address this issue, we propose a Reinforcement Learning approach emphasizing both Topic and Rhetorical Coherence (RL-TRC). In particular, the topic- and rhetorical-coherence tasks are designed to enhance the model’s perception of coherence with the target utterance. Subsequently, an agent is employed to learn a coherence policy, which guides the generation of responses that are topically and rhetorically aligned with the target utterance. Furthermore, three discourse-aware rewards are developed to assess the coherence between the generated response and the target utterance, with the objective of optimizing the policy. The experimental results and in-depth analyses on two popular datasets demonstrate that our RL-TRC significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art... | Yaxin Fan, Peifeng Li, Qiaoming Zhu |  |

To mitigate the catastrophic forgetting problem in CL, data replay has been proven a simple and effective strategy, and the subsequent data-replay-based distillation can further enhance the performance. However, existing methods fail to fully exploit the knowledge embedded in models from previous tasks, resulting in the need for a relatively large number of replay samples to achieve good results. In this work, we first explore and emphasize the importance of attention weights in knowledge retention, and then propose a SElective attEntion-guided Knowledge Retention method (SEEKR) for data-efficient replay-based continual learning of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, SEEKR performs attention distillation on the selected attention heads for finer-grained knowledge retention, where the proposed forgettability-based and task-sensitivity-based measures are used to... | Jinghan He, Haiyun Guo, Kuan Zhu, Zihan Zhao, Ming Tang, Jinqiao Wang |  |

Due to computational constraints, current attribution techniques struggle to operate at neuron level. In this paper, we propose a static method for pinpointing significant neurons. Compared to seven other methods, our approach demonstrates superior performance across three metrics. Additionally, since most static methods typically only identify “value neurons” directly contributing to the final prediction, we propose a method for identifying “query neurons” which activate these “value neurons”. Finally, we apply our methods to analyze six types of knowledge across both attention and feed-forward network (FFN) layers. Our method and analysis are helpful for understanding the mechanisms of knowledge storage and set the stage for future research in knowledge editing.

Query and Key Matrices of In-Context Heads are Two Towers for Metric Learning](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.192) |  | 0 | We investigate the mechanism of in-context learning (ICL) on sentence classification tasks with semantically-unrelated labels (“foo”/“bar”). We find intervening in only 1% heads (named “in-context heads”) significantly affects ICL accuracy from 87.6% to 24.4%. To understand this phenomenon, we analyze the value-output vectors in these heads and discover that the vectors at each label position contain substantial information about the corresponding labels. Furthermore, we observe that the prediction shift from “foo” to “bar” is due to the respective reduction and increase in these heads’ attention scores at “foo” and “bar” positions. Therefore, we propose a hypothesis for ICL: in in-context heads, the value-output matrices extract label features, while the query-key matrices compute the similarity between the features at the last position and those at each label position. The query and key matrices can be considered as two towers that learn the similarity metric between the last... | Zeping Yu, Sophia Ananiadou |  |

To delve into the reason, we introduce the Comparative Neuron Analysis (CNA) method, which identifies an internal logic chain consisting of four distinct stages from input to prediction: feature enhancing with shallow FFN neurons, feature transferring by shallow attention layers, feature predicting by arithmetic heads, and prediction enhancing among deep FFN neurons. Moreover, we identify the human-interpretable FFN neurons within both feature-enhancing and feature-predicting stages. These findings lead us to investigate the mechanism of LoRA, revealing that it enhances prediction probabilities by amplifying the coefficient scores of FFN neurons related to predictions. Finally, we apply our method in model pruning for arithmetic tasks and model editing for reducing gender bias.

PIXEL, a canonical example of such a model, is a vision transformer that has been pre-trained on rendered text. While PIXEL has shown promising cross-script transfer abilities and robustness to orthographic perturbations, it falls short of outperforming monolingual subword counterparts like BERT in most other contexts. This discrepancy raises questions about the amount of linguistic knowledge learnt by these models and whether their performance in language tasks stems more from their visual capabilities than their linguistic ones. To explore this, we probe PIXEL using a variety of linguistic and visual tasks to assess its position on the vision-to-language spectrum. Our findings reveal a substantial gap between the model’s visual and linguistic understanding. The lower layers of PIXEL predominantly capture superficial... | Kushal Tatariya, Vladimir Araujo, Thomas Bauwens, Miryam de Lhoneux |  |

Existing research primarily studies privacy by exploring various privacy attacks, defenses, and evaluations within narrowly predefined patterns, while neglecting that privacy is not an isolated, context-free concept limited to traditionally sensitive data (e.g., social security numbers), but intertwined with intricate social contexts that complicate the identification and analysis of potential privacy violations. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers unprecedented opportunities for incorporating the nuanced scenarios outlined in privacy laws to tackle these complex privacy issues. However, the scarcity of open-source relevant case studies restricts the efficiency of LLMs in aligning with specific legal statutes. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel framework, GoldCoin, designed to efficiently ground LLMs in privacy laws for judicial assessing privacy... | Wei Fan, Haoran Li, Zheye Deng, Weiqi Wang, Yangqiu Song |  |

A Framework for Detecting and Categorizing Noise in Danish and Norwegian Literature](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.196) |  | 0 | We present a framework for detecting and categorizing noise in literary texts, demonstrated through its application to Danish and Norwegian literature from the late 19-th century. Noise, understood as “aberrant sonic behaviour,” is not only an auditory phenomenon but also a cultural construct tied to the processes of civilization and urbanization.We begin by utilizing topic modeling techniques to identify noise-related documents, followed by fine-tuning BERT-based language models trained on Danish and Norwegian texts to analyze a corpus of over 800 novels.We identify and track the prevalence of noise in these texts, offering insights into the literary perceptions of noise during the Scandinavian “Modern Breakthrough” period (1870-1899). Our contributions include the development of a comprehensive dataset annotated for noise-related segments and their categorization into human-made, non-human-made, and musical noises.

However, the vast majority of existing work focuses on weight-only quantization, which can reduce runtime costs in the memory-bound one-token-at-a-time generative setting, but does not address costs in compute-bound scenarios, such as batched inference or prompt processing.In this paper, we address the general quantization problem, where both weights and activations should be quantized, which leads to computational improvements in general. We show that the majority of inference computations for large generative models can be performed with both weights and activations being cast to 4 bits, while at the same time maintaining good accuracy. We achieve this via a hybrid quantization strategy called QUIK that compresses most of the weights and activations to 4-bit, while keeping a small fraction of “outlier”... | Saleh Ashkboos, Ilia Markov, Elias Frantar, Tingxuan Zhong, Xincheng Wang, Jie Ren, Torsten Hoefler, Dan Alistarh |  |

In this work, we address this longstanding question using large-scale eyetracking data. We focus on a cardinal and largely unaddressed variant of this question: predicting reading comprehension of a single participant for a single question from their eye movements over a single paragraph. We tackle this task using a battery of recent models from the literature, and three new multimodal language models. We evaluate the models in two different reading regimes: ordinary reading and information seeking, and examine their generalization to new textual items, new participants, and the combination of both. The evaluations suggest that the task is highly challenging, and highlight the importance of benchmarking against a strong text-only baseline. While in some cases eye movements provide improvements over such a baseline, they tend to be small. This could be due to limitations of current modelling approaches,... | Omer Shubi, Yoav Meiri, Cfir Avraham Hadar, Yevgeni Berzak |  |

Existing methods, such as in-context learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, fall short in capturing the complexity of human preferences, especially given the small, personal datasets individuals possess. In this paper, we propose a novel approach utilizing small parameter models as preference agents to generate natural language rules that guide a larger, pre-trained model, enabling efficient personalization. Our method involves a small, local “steering wheel” model that directs the outputs of a much larger foundation model, producing content tailored to an individual’s preferences while leveraging the extensive knowledge and capabilities of the large model. Importantly, this personalization is achieved without the need to fine-tune the large model.

The Impact of Guardrails on the Argumentative Strength of LLMs in Hate Speech Countering](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.201) |  | 0 | The potential effectiveness of counterspeech as a hate speech mitigation strategy is attracting increasing interest in the NLG research community, particularly towards the task of automatically producing it. However, automatically generated responses often lack the argumentative richness which characterises expert-produced counterspeech. In this work, we focus on two aspects of counterspeech generation to produce more cogent responses. First, by investigating the tension between helpfulness and harmlessness of LLMs, we test whether the presence of safety guardrails hinders the quality of the generations. Secondly, we assess whether attacking a specific component of the hate speech results in a more effective argumentative strategy to fight online hate. By conducting an extensive human and automatic evaluation, we show how the presence of safety guardrails can be detrimental also to a task that inherently aims at fostering positive social interactions.

Motivated by the advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose LLM4Decompile, the first and largest open-source LLM series (1.3B to 33B) trained to decompile binary code. We optimize the LLM training process and introduce the LLM4Decompile-End models to decompile binary directly. The resulting models significantly outperform GPT-4o and Ghidra on the HumanEval and ExeBench benchmarks by over 100% in terms of re-executability rate. Additionally, we improve the standard refinement approach to fine-tune the LLM4Decompile-Ref models, enabling them to effectively refine the decompiled code from Ghidra and achieve a further 16.2% improvement over the LLM4Decompile-End. LLM4Decompile demonstrates the potential of LLMs to revolutionize binary code decompilation, delivering remarkable improvements in readability and... | Hanzhuo Tan, Qi Luo, Jing Li, Yuqun Zhang |  |

However, previous work primarily applied uniform operations across all layers of the model, overlooking the fact that different layers in a transformer store different information. In the process of exploration, We find that there is a significant differences in fine-tuning strategies between different layers, and fine-tuning only a subset of layers can even achieve comparable performance. Based on this, we propose the Hybrid LoRA-Prefix Tuning(HLPT) method, which uses enhanced LoRA and Prefix-tuning methods with learnable adaptive mechanism separately for the bottom and top layers, and the Half Hybrid LoRA-Prefix Tuning(H2LPT) method, which goes a step further, reducing the parameter count to nearly half by omitting fine-tuning in the middle layers.

They typically require rewriting retrieved subgraphs into natural language formats comprehensible to LLMs. However, when tackling complex questions, the knowledge rewritten by existing methods may include irrelevant information, omit crucial details, or fail to align with the question’s semantics. To address them, we propose a novel rewriting method CoTKR, Chain- of-Thought Enhanced Knowledge Rewriting, for generating reasoning traces and corresponding knowledge in an interleaved manner, thereby mitigating the limitations of single-step knowledge rewriting. Additionally, to bridge the preference gap between the knowledge rewriter and the question answering (QA) model, we propose a training strategy PAQAF, Preference Alignment from Question Answering Feedback, for leveraging feedback from the QA model to further optimize the... | Yike Wu, Yi Huang, Nan Hu, Yuncheng Hua, Guilin Qi, Jiaoyan Chen, Jeff Z.

In the same language, there is a fixed correspondence between linguistic symbol and meaning. In different languages, universal meanings follow varying rules of symbolization in one-to-one correspondence with symbols. Most work overlooks the properties of languages as symbol systems. In this paper, we shift the focus to the symbolic properties and introduce MTLS: a pre-training method to improve the multilingual capability of models by Making Texts into Linguistic Symbols. Initially, we replace the vocabulary in pre-trained language models by mapping relations between linguistic symbols and semantics. Subsequently, universal semantics within the symbolic system serve as bridges, linking symbols from different languages to the embedding space of the model, thereby enabling the model to process linguistic symbols. To evaluate... | Wenlong Fei, Xiaohua Wang, Min Hu, Qingyu Zhang, Hongbo Li |  |

Previous training methods focus on aligning query samples with positive samples and distancing them from negatives. They often neglect intra-category and inter-category semantic similarities of fine-grained categories when navigating sample distributions in the embedding space. Furthermore, some evaluation techniques that rely on pre-collected test samples are inadequate for real-time applications. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a method that successfully detects fine-grained clusters of semantically similar texts guided by a novel objective function. The method uses semantic similarities in a logarithmic space to guide sample distributions in the Euclidean space and to form distinct clusters that represent fine-grained categories. We also propose a centroid inference mechanism to support real-time applications. The efficacy of the method is both theoretically... | Chang Tian, Matthew B.

Yet, it remains uncertain whether improvements on those tasks have truly addressed moderators’ needs in accomplishing their work. In this paper, we surface gaps between past research efforts that have aimed to provide automation for aspects of content moderation and the needs of volunteer content moderators, regarding identifying violations of various moderation rules. To do so, we conduct a model review on Hugging Face to reveal the availability of models to cover various moderation rules and guidelines from three exemplar forums. We further put state-of-the-art LLMs to the test, evaluating how well these models perform in flagging violations of platform rules from one particular forum. Finally, we conduct a user survey study with volunteer moderators to gain insight into their... | Yang Trista Cao, LovelyFrances Domingo, Sarah A. Gilbert, Michelle L.

Although many benchmarks exist, they mainly focus on specific predefined model abilities, such as world knowledge, reasoning, etc. Based on these ability scores, it is hard for users to determine which LLM best suits their particular needs. To address these issues, we propose to evaluate LLMs from a user-centric perspective and design this benchmark to measure their efficacy in satisfying user needs under distinct intents. Firstly, we collect 1,846 real-world use cases from a user study with 712 participants from 23 countries. This first-hand data helps us understand actual user intents and needs in LLM interactions, forming the User Reported Scenarios (URS) dataset, which is categorized with six types of user intents.

They tend to hallucinate and may generate biased responses. In such circumstances, having a way to assess the reliability of a given response generated by a VLM is quite useful. Existing methods, such as estimating uncertainty using answer likelihoods or prompt-based confidence generation, often suffer from overconfidence. Other methods use self-consistency comparison but are affected by confirmation biases. To alleviate these, we propose Decompose and Compare Consistency (DeCC) for reliability measurement. By comparing the consistency between the direct answer generated using the VLM’s internal reasoning process, and the indirect answers obtained by decomposing the question into sub-questions and reasoning over the sub-answers produced by the VLM, DeCC measures the reliability of VLM’s direct answer. Experiments across six vision-language tasks with three VLMs show... | Qian Yang, Weixiang Yan, Aishwarya Agrawal |  |

However, these models are not flawless and often produce responses that contain errors or misinformation. These inaccuracies, commonly referred to as hallucinations, render LLMs unreliable and even unusable in many scenarios. In this paper, our focus is on mitigating the issue of hallucination in LLMs, particularly in the context of question-answering. Instead of attempting to answer all questions, we explore a refusal mechanism that instructs LLMs to refuse to answer challenging questions in order to avoid errors. We then propose a simple yet effective solution called Learn to Refuse (L2R), which incorporates the refusal mechanism to enable LLMs to recognize and refuse to answer questions that they find difficult to address. To achieve this, we utilize a structured knowledge base to represent all the... | Lang Cao |  |

Yet this is not always the best or unique way to represent visual content, especially for designers and artists who depict the world using geometry primitives such as polygons. Vector graphics (VG), on the other hand, offer a textual representation of visual content, which can be more concise and powerful for content like cartoons, sketches and scientific figures. Recent studies have shown promising results on processing vector graphics with capable Large Language Models (LLMs). However, such works focus solely on qualitative results, understanding, or a specific type of vector graphics. We propose VGBench, a comprehensive benchmark for LLMs on handling vector graphics through diverse aspects, including (a) both visual understanding and generation, (b) evaluation of various vector graphics formats, (c) diverse question types, (d) wide range of prompting techniques, (e)... | Bocheng Zou, Mu Cai, Jianrui Zhang, Yong Jae Lee |  |

For the evaluation of machine translation (MT), existing research shows that LLMs are able to achieve results comparable to fine-tuned multilingual pre-trained language models. In this paper, we explore what translation information, such as the source, reference, translation errors and annotation guidelines, is needed for LLMs to evaluate MT quality. In addition, we investigate prompting techniques such as zero-shot, Chain of Thought (CoT) and few-shot prompting for eight language pairs covering high-, medium- and low-resource languages, leveraging varying LLM variants. Our findings indicate the importance of reference translations for an LLM-based evaluation. While larger models do not necessarily fare better, they tend to benefit more from CoT prompting, than smaller models. We also observe that LLMs do not always provide a numerical score when... | Shenbin Qian, Archchana Sindhujan, Minnie Kabra, Diptesh Kanojia, Constantin Orasan, Tharindu Ranasinghe, Frédéric Blain |  |

To address this, we present Performance-Guided Knowledge Distillation (PGKD), a cost-effective and high-throughput solution for production text classification applications. PGKD utilizes teacher-student Knowledge Distillation to distill the knowledge of LLMs into smaller, task-specific models. PGKD establishes an active learning routine between the student model and the LLM; the LLM continuously generates new training data leveraging hard-negative mining, student model validation performance, and early-stopping protocols to inform the data generation. By employing a cyclical, performance-aware approach tailored for highly multi-class, sparsely annotated datasets prevalent in industrial text classification, PGKD effectively addresses training challenges and outperforms traditional BERT-base models and other knowledge distillation methods on several multi-class... | Flavio Palo, Prateek Singhi, Bilal Fadlallah |  |

The essence of ARs among ADUs is context-dependent and lies in maintaining a coherent flow of ideas, often centered around the relations between discussed entities, topics, themes or concepts. However, these relations are not always explicitly stated; rather, inferred from implicit chains of reasoning connecting the concepts addressed in the ADUs. While humans can infer such background knowledge, machines face challenges when the contextual cues are not explicitly provided. This paper leverages external resources, including WordNet, ConceptNet, and Wikipedia to identify semantic paths (knowledge paths) connecting the concepts discussed in the ADUs to obtain the implicit chains of reasoning. To effectively leverage these paths for AR prediction, we propose attention-based Multi-Network architectures. Various architecture are evaluated on the external resources, and... | Debela Gemechu, Chris Reed |  |

Unfortunately, these tools are becoming increasingly limited in their ability to identify compliance issues and fixes. After all, most were developed using regulation-agnostic datasets of annotated privacy policies obtained from a time before the introduction of landmark privacy regulations such as EU’s GDPR and California’s CCPA. In this paper, we describe the first open regulation-aware dataset of expert-annotated privacy policies, C3PA (CCPA Privacy Policy Provision Annotations), aimed to address this challenge. C3PA contains over 48K expert-labeled privacy policy text segments associated with responses to CCPA-specific disclosure mandates from 411 unique organizations. We demonstrate that the C3PA dataset is uniquely suited for aiding automated audits of compliance with CCPA-related disclosure mandates. | Maaz Bin Musa, Steven M.

Instruction tuning has emerged as an effective strategy for achieving zero-shot generalization by finetuning pretrained models on diverse multimodal tasks. As the scale of MLLMs continues to grow, parameter-efficient finetuning becomes increasingly critical. However, most existing parameter-efficient approaches focus only on single modalities and often overlook the multimodal characteristics during finetuning. In this work, we introduce a novel Multimodal Prompt Tuning (M2PT) approach for efficient instruction tuning of MLLMs. M2PT effectively integrates visual and textual prompts into the vision encoder and language processor respectively during finetuning, facilitating the extraction and alignment of features across modalities.

Recent works have started to generate the relevant texts by prompting LLMs using the class names or definitions; however, there is a high risk that LLMs cannot generate in-distribution (i.e., similar to the corpus where the text classifier will be applied) data, leading to ungeneralizable classifiers. In this paper, we combine the advantages of these two approaches and propose to bridge the gap via a novel framework, text grafting, which aims to obtain clean and near-distribution weak supervision for minority classes. Specifically, we first use LLM-based logits to mine masked templates from the raw corpus, which have a high potential for data synthesis into the target minority class. Then, the templates are filled by state-of-the-art LLMs to synthesize... | Letian Peng, Yi Gu, Chengyu Dong, Zihan Wang, Jingbo Shang |  |

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) lead to pioneer attempts to individually generate texts for each class via prompting. In this paper, we propose Incubator, the first framework that can handle complicated and even mutually dependent classes (e.g., "TED Talk given by Educator" and "Other"). Specifically, our Incubator is a fine-tuned LLM that takes the instruction of all class definitions as input, and in each inference, it can jointly generate one sample for every class. First, we tune Incubator on the instruction-to-data mappings that we obtained from classification datasets and descriptions on Hugging Face together with in-context augmentation by GPT-4. To emphasize the uniformity and diversity in generations, we refine Incubator by fine-tuning with the cluster centers of... | Letian Peng, Zilong Wang, Jingbo Shang |  |

Different from tasks such as math word problem and commonsense reasoning, SQL solutions have a relatively fixed pattern. This facilitates the investigation of whether LLMs can benefit from categorical thinking, mirroring how humans acquire knowledge through inductive reasoning based on comparable examples. In this study, we propose that employing query group partitioning allows LLMs to focus on learning the thought processes specific to a single problem type, consequently enhancing their reasoning abilities across diverse difficulty levels and problem categories. Our experiments reveal that multiple advanced LLMs, when equipped with PTD-SQL, can either surpass or match previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the Spider and BIRD datasets.

In this paper, we probe the extent to which twenty-nine LLMs are able to distinguish logically correct inferences from logically fallacious ones. We focus on inference patterns involving conditionals (e.g., '\*If\* Ann has a queen, \*then\* Bob has a jack’) and epistemic modals (e.g., ‘Ann \*might\* have an ace’, ‘Bob \*must\* have a king’). These inferences have been of special interest to logicians, philosophers, and linguists, since they play a central role in the fundamental human ability to reason about distal possibilities. Assessing LLMs on these inferences is thus highly relevant to the question of how much the reasoning abilities of LLMs match those of humans. All the LLMs we tested make some basic mistakes with conditionals or modals, though zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting helps them make fewer mistakes. Even the best performing LLMs make... | Wesley H. Holliday, Matthew Mandelkern, Cedegao Zhang |  |

However, improving this capability requires high-quality attribution data, which is costly and labor-intensive. Inspired by recent advances in self-improvement that enhance LLMs without manual annotation, we present START, a Self-Taught AttRibuTion framework for iteratively improving the attribution capability of LLMs. First, to prevent models from stagnating due to initially insufficient supervision signals, START leverages the model to self-construct synthetic training data for warming up. To further self-improve the model’s attribution ability, START iteratively utilizes fine-grained preference supervision signals constructed from its sampled responses to encourage robust, comprehensive, and attributable generation.

The emotional content conveyed through human speech are often complex, and classifying them into fixed categories may not be enough to fully capture speech emotions. Describing speech emotions through natural language may be a more effective approach. However, existing SEC methods often produce hallucinations and lose generalization on unseen speech. To overcome these problems, we propose AlignCap, which Aligning Speech Emotion Captioning to Human Preferences based on large language model (LLM) with two properties: 1) Speech-Text Alignment, which minimizing the divergence between the LLM’s response prediction distributions for speech and text inputs using knowledge distillation (KD) Regularization. 2) Human Preference Alignment, where we design Preference Optimization (PO) Regularization to eliminate factuality and faithfulness hallucinations.

Existing methods, spanning model’s parameters modification, external knowledge integration, and in-context learning, lack in-depth analysis from a model interpretability perspective. Our work explores the instability in in-context learning outcomes, providing insights into its reasons and distinctions from other methods. Leveraging findings on the critical role of feed-forward MLPs in decoder-only models, we propose a tailored knowledge editing method, TailoredKE, that considers the unique information flow of each sample. Model interpretability reveals diverse attribute recall across transformer layers, guiding edits to specific features at different depths and mitigating over-editing issues. | Yihuai Hong, Aldo Lipani |  |

LLMs have been successfully used to help find and improve prompt candidates for single-step tasks. However, realistic tasks for agents are multi-step and introduce new challenges: (1) Prompt content is likely to be more extensive and complex, making it more difficult for LLMs to analyze errors, (2) the impact of an individual step is difficult to evaluate, and (3) different people may have varied preferences about task execution. While humans struggle to optimize prompts, they are good at providing feedback about LLM outputs; we therefore introduce a new LLM-driven discrete prompt optimization framework PROMST that incorporates human-designed feedback rules to automatically offer direct suggestions for improvement. We also use an extra learned heuristic model that predicts prompt performance to efficiently sample from prompt candidates. This approach significantly outperforms both... | Yongchao Chen, Jacob Arkin, Yilun Hao, Yang Zhang, Nicholas Roy, Chuchu Fan |  |

In this paper, we explore the novel challenge of VideoQA within a continual learning framework, and empirically identify a critical issue: fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) for a sequence of tasks often results in catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose Collaborative Prompting (ColPro), which integrates specific question constraint prompting, knowledge acquisition prompting, and visual temporal awareness prompting. These prompts aim to capture textual question context, visual content, and video temporal dynamics in VideoQA, a perspective underexplored in prior research. Experimental results on the NExT-QA and DramaQA datasets show that ColPro achieves superior performance compared to existing approaches,... | Chen Cai, Zheng Wang, Jianjun Gao, Wenyang Liu, Ye Lu, Runzhong Zhang, KimHui Yap |  |

However, the true effectiveness of the methods is unclear. In this paper, we delve into the limitations of fine-tuning-based unlearning through activation patching and parameter restoration experiments. Our findings reveal that these methods alter the model’s knowledge retrieval process, rather than genuinely erasing the problematic knowledge embedded in the model parameters. Furthermore, behavioral tests demonstrate that the unlearning mechanisms inevitably impact the global behavior of the models, affecting unrelated knowledge or capabilities. Our work advocates the development of more resilient unlearning techniques for truly erasing knowledge. | Yihuai Hong, Yuelin Zou, Lijie Hu, Ziqian Zeng, Di Wang, Haiqin Yang |  |

Here, we provide concrete evidence of a trade-off between instruction following (i.e., follow open-ended instructions) and faithfulness (i.e., ground responses in given context) when training LMs with these objectives. For instance, fine-tuning LLaMA-7B on instruction following datasets renders it less faithful. Conversely, instruction-tuned Vicuna-7B shows degraded performance at following instructions when further optimized on tasks that require contextual grounding. One common remedy is multi-task learning (MTL) with data mixing, yet it remains far from achieving a synergic outcome. We propose a simple yet effective method that relies on Reject-sampling by Self-instruct with Continued Fine-tuning (ReSet), which significantly outperforms vanilla MTL. Surprisingly, we find that less is more, as training ReSet with high-quality, yet substantially smaller data... | Zhengxuan Wu, Yuhao Zhang, Peng Qi, Yumo Xu, Rujun Han, Yian Zhang, Jifan Chen, Bonan Min, Zhiheng Huang |  |

To prevent privacy leakage, researchers have investigated word-level perturbations, relying on the formal guarantees of differential privacy (DP) in the embedding space. However, many existing approaches either achieve unsatisfactory performance in the high privacy regime when using the Laplacian or Gaussian mechanism, or resort to weaker relaxations of DP that are inferior to the canonical DP in terms of privacy strength. This raises the question of whether a new method for private word embedding can be designed to overcome these limitations. In this paper, we propose a novel private embedding method called the high dimensional truncated Laplacian mechanism. Specifically, we introduce a non-trivial extension of the truncated Laplacian mechanism, which was previously only investigated in one-dimensional space cases. Theoretically, we show that... | Tianhao Huang, Tao Yang, Ivan Habernal, Lijie Hu, Di Wang |  |

The growing language interpretation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), including in formal languages, are lowering the barriers for autoformalization. However, LLMs alone are not capable of consistently and reliably delivering autoformalization, in particular as the complexity and specialization of the target domain grows. As the field evolves into the direction of systematically applying autoformalization towards large mathematical libraries, the need to improve syntactic, terminological and semantic control increases. This paper proposes the coordinated use of three mechanisms, most-similar retrieval augmented generation (MS-RAG), denoising steps, and auto-correction with syntax error feedback (Auto-SEF) to improve autoformalization quality. The empirical analysis, across different models, demonstrates that these mechanisms can... | Lan Zhang, Xin Quan, André Freitas |  |

This study investigates how nine widely used LLMs allocate knowledge between local context and global parameters when answering open-ended questions in knowledge-consistent scenarios. We introduce a novel dataset, WikiAtomic, and systematically vary context sizes to analyze how LLMs prioritize and utilize the provided information and their parametric knowledge in knowledge-consistent scenarios. Additionally, we also study their tendency to hallucinate under varying context sizes. Our findings reveal consistent patterns across models, including a consistent reliance on both contextual (around 70%) and parametric (around 30%) knowledge, and a decrease in hallucinations with increasing context. These insights highlight the importance of more effective context organization and developing models that use input more deterministically for robust performance. | Yufei Tao, Adam Hiatt, Erik Haake, Antonie J.

However, neural networks are trained primarily on form alone, while children acquiring language additionally receive data about meaning. Would neural networks generalize more like humans when trained on both form and meaning? We investigate this by examining if Transformers—neural networks without a hierarchical bias—better achieve hierarchical generalization when trained on both form and meaning compared to when trained on form alone. Our results show that Transformers trained on form and meaning do favor the hierarchical generalization more than those trained on form alone, suggesting that statistical learners without hierarchical biases can leverage semantic training signals to bootstrap hierarchical syntactic generalization. | Aditya Yedetore, Najoung Kim |  |

Language Modeling for 250 High- and Low-Resource Languages](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.236) |  | 0 | Multilingual language models are widely used to extend NLP systems to low-resource languages. However, concrete evidence for the effects of multilinguality on language modeling performance in individual languages remains scarce. Here, we pre-train over 10,000 monolingual and multilingual language models for over 250 languages, including multiple language families that are under-studied in NLP. We assess how language modeling performance in each language varies as a function of (1) monolingual dataset size, (2) added multilingual dataset size, (3) linguistic similarity of the added languages, and (4) model size (up to 45M parameters). We find that in moderation, adding multilingual data improves low-resource language modeling performance, similar to increasing low-resource dataset sizes by up to 33%. Improvements depend on the syntactic similarity of the added multilingual data, with marginal additional effects of vocabulary overlap. However, high-resource languages consistently... | Tyler A.

Despite recent progress, most previous approaches adopt simple low-level instructions as language inputs, which may not reflect natural human communication. We expect human language to be informative (i.e., providing feedback on agents’ past behaviors and offering guidance on achieving their future goals) and diverse (i.e., encompassing a wide range of expressions and style nuances). To enable flexibility of language use in teaching agents tasks, this paper studies different types of language inputs in facilitating reinforcement learning (RL) embodied agents. More specifically, we examine how different levels of language informativeness and diversity impact agent learning and inference. Our empirical results based on four RL benchmarks demonstrate that agents trained with diverse and informative language feedback can... | Jiajun Xi, Yinong He, Jianing Yang, Yinpei Dai, Joyce Chai |  |

To measure the extent of such potential harms when translating into and out of English, we introduce a dataset, MiTTenS, covering 26 languages from a variety of language families and scripts, including several traditionally under-represented in digital resources. The dataset is constructed with handcrafted passages that target known failure patterns, longer synthetically generated passages, and natural passages sourced from multiple domains. We demonstrate the usefulness of the dataset by evaluating both neural machine translation systems and foundation models, and show that all systems exhibit gender mistranslation and potential harm, even in high resource languages. | Kevin Robinson, Sneha Kudugunta, Romina Stella, Sunipa Dev, Jasmijn Bastings |  |

Teaching LLMs to abstain in the face of knowledge gaps is thus a promising strategy to mitigate hallucinations in multilingual settings. However, previous studies on LLM abstention primarily focus on English; we find that directly applying existing solutions beyond English results in up to 20.5% performance gaps between high and low-resource languages, potentially due to LLMs’ drop in calibration and reasoning beyond a few resource-rich languages. To this end, we propose strategies to enhance LLM abstention by learning from multilingual feedback, where LLMs self-reflect on proposed answers in one language by generating multiple feedback items in related languages: we show that this helps identifying the knowledge gaps across diverse languages, cultures, and communities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our multilingual feedback approach outperforms various strong... | Shangbin Feng, Weijia Shi, Yike Wang, Wenxuan Ding, Orevaoghene Ahia, Shuyue Stella Li, Vidhisha Balachandran, Sunayana Sitaram, Yulia Tsvetkov |  |

We propose Modular Pluralism, a modular framework based on multi-LLM collaboration for pluralistic alignment: it “plugs into” a base LLM a pool of smaller but specialized community LMs, where models collaborate in distinct modes to flexibility support three modes of pluralism: Overton, steerable, and distributional. Modular Pluralism is uniquely compatible with black-box LLMs and offers the modular control of adding new community LMs for previously underrepresented communities. We evaluate Modular Pluralism with six tasks and four datasets featuring questions/instructions with value-laden and perspective-informed responses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Modular Pluralism advances the three pluralism objectives across six black-box and open-source... | Shangbin Feng, Taylor Sorensen, Yuhan Liu, Jillian Fisher, Chan Young Park, Yejin Choi, Yulia Tsvetkov |  |

Current methods using large language models (LLMs) lack interpretability and controllability, often ignoring author-specific stylistic features, resulting in less robust performance overall.To address this, we develop StyleRemix, an adaptive and interpretable obfuscation method that perturbs specific, fine-grained style elements of the original input text. StyleRemix uses pre-trained Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules to rewrite inputs along various stylistic axes (e.g., formality, length) while maintaining low computational costs. StyleRemix outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and much larger LLMs on an array of domains on both automatic and human evaluation.Additionally, we release AuthorMix, a large set of 30K high-quality, long-form texts from a diverse set of 14 authors and 4 domains, and DiSC, a parallel corpus of 1,500 texts spanning seven style axes in... | Jillian Fisher, Skyler Hallinan, Ximing Lu, Mitchell L.

While existing large language models (LLMs) identify these unanswerable questions, they do not assist users in reformulating their questions, thereby reducing their overall utility. We curate CouldAsk, an evaluation benchmark composed of existing and new datasets for document-grounded question answering, specifically designed to study reformulating unanswerable questions. We evaluate state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs on CouldAsk. The results demonstrate the limited capabilities of these models in reformulating questions. Specifically, GPT-4 and Llama2-7B successfully reformulate questions only 26% and 12% of the time, respectively. Error analysis shows that 62% of the unsuccessful reformulations stem from the models merely rephrasing the questions or even generating identical questions. We publicly release the benchmark and the code to reproduce... | Wenting Zhao, Ge Gao, Claire Cardie, Alexander M. Rush |  |

Benchmarking Large Language Models with Sensitivity Testing on Offensive Progressions](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.243) |  | 0 | Mitigating explicit and implicit biases in Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical focus in the field of natural language processing. However, many current methodologies evaluate scenarios in isolation, without considering the broader context or the spectrum of potential biases within each situation. To address this, we introduce the Sensitivity Testing on Offensive Progressions (STOP) dataset, which includes 450 offensive progressions containing 2,700 unique sentences of varying severity that progressively escalate from less to more explicitly offensive. Covering a broad spectrum of 9 demographics and 46 sub-demographics, STOP ensures inclusivity and comprehensive coverage. We evaluate several leading closed- and open-source models, including GPT-4, Mixtral, and Llama 3. Our findings reveal that even the best-performing models detect bias inconsistently, with success rates ranging from 19.3% to 69.8%. Furthermore, we demonstrate how aligning models with human judgments on... | Robert Morabito, Sangmitra Madhusudan, Tyler McDonald, Ali Emami |  |

This paper explores these questions in the context of the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Through a voting simulation, we demonstrate 18 open-weight and closed-source LLMs’ political preference for Biden over Trump. We show how Biden-leaning becomes more pronounced in instruction-tuned and reinforced models compared to their base versions by analyzing their responses to political questions related to the two nominees. We further explore the potential impact of LLMs on voter choice by recruiting 935 U.S. registered voters. Participants interacted with LLMs (Claude-3, Llama-3, and GPT-4) over five exchanges. Intriguingly, although LLMs were not asked to persuade users to support Biden, about 20% of Trump supporters reduced their support for Trump after LLM interaction. This result is noteworthy given that many studies on the persuasiveness of political campaigns have shown minimal effects in presidential... | Yujin Potter, Shiyang Lai, Junsol Kim, James Evans, Dawn Song |  |

LLM unlearning aims at removing undesired data influences and associated model capabilities without compromising utility beyond the scope of unlearning. While interest in studying LLM unlearning is growing, the impact of the optimizer choice for LLM unlearning remains unexplored. In this work, we shed light on the significance of optimizer selection in LLM unlearning for the first time, establishing a clear connection between second-order optimization and influence unlearning (a classical approach using influence functions to update the model for data influence removal). This insight propels us to develop a second-order optimization-based LLM unlearning framework, termed Second-Order UnLearning (SOUL), which extends the static, one-shot model update using influence unlearning to a dynamic, iterative unlearning process.

We examine the critical role of information aggregation in reasoning by requiring the LLM to analyze sports narratives. To succeed at this task, an LLM must infer points from actions, identify related entities, attribute points accurately to players and teams, and compile key statistics to draw conclusions. We conduct comprehensive experiments with real NBA basketball data and present SportsGen, a new method to synthesize game narratives. By synthesizing data, we can rigorously evaluate LLMs’ reasoning capabilities under complex scenarios with varying narrative lengths and density of information. Our findings show that most models, including GPT-4o, often fail to accurately aggregate basketball scores due to frequent scoring patterns. Open-source models like Llama-3 further suffer from significant score hallucinations. Finally, the effectiveness of reasoning is influenced by narrative complexity,... | Yebowen Hu, Kaiqiang Song, Sangwoo Cho, Xiaoyang Wang, Wenlin Yao, Hassan Foroosh, Dong Yu, Fei Liu |  |

However, there has not been any work in studying the behavior of FActScore in other languages. This paper studies the limitations of each component in the four-component pipeline of FActScore in the multilingual setting. We introduce a new dataset for FActScore on texts generated by strong multilingual LLMs. Our evaluation shows that LLMs exhibit distinct behaviors in both fact extraction and fact scoring tasks. No LLM produces consistent and reliable FActScore across languages of varying levels of resources. We also find that the knowledge source plays an important role in the quality of the estimated FActScore. Using Wikipedia as the knowledge source may hinder the true FActScore of long-form text due to its limited coverage in medium- and low-resource languages. We also incorporate 3 mitigations to our knowledge source that ultimately... | Vu Trong Kim, Michael Krumdick, Varshini Reddy, Franck Dernoncourt, Viet Dac Lai |  |

On the other hand, existing open evaluator LMs exhibit critical shortcomings: 1) they issue scores that significantly diverge from those assigned by humans, and 2) they lack the flexibility to perform both direct assessment and pairwise ranking, the two most prevalent forms of assessment. Additionally, they do not possess the ability to evaluate based on custom evaluation criteria, focusing instead on general attributes like helpfulness and harmlessness. To address these issues, we introduce Prometheus 2, a more powerful evaluator LM than its predecessor that closely mirrors human and GPT-4 judgements. Moreover, it is capable of processing both direct assessment and pair-wise ranking formats grouped with a user-defined evaluation... | Seungone Kim, Juyoung Suk, Shayne Longpre, Bill Yuchen Lin, Jamin Shin, Sean Welleck, Graham Neubig, Moontae Lee, Kyungjae Lee, Minjoon Seo |  |

However, most existing datasets for this task are either constructed using a single source corpus or consist of short extractive answers, which fall short of evaluating large language model (LLM) based RAG-QA systems on cross-domain generalization. To address these limitations, we create Long-form RobustQA (LFRQA), a new dataset comprising human-written long-form answers that integrate short extractive answers from multiple documents into a single, coherent narrative, covering 26K queries and large corpora across seven different domains. We further propose RAG-QA Arena by directly comparing model-generated answers against LFRQA’s answers using LLMs as evaluators. We show via extensive experiments that RAG-QA Arena and human judgments on answer quality are highly correlated. Moreover, only 41.3% of the most competitive LLM’s answers... | Rujun Han, Yuhao Zhang, Peng Qi, Yumo Xu, Jenyuan Wang, Lan Liu, William Yang Wang, Bonan Min, Vittorio Castelli |  |

Our method only requires prompts to guide an LLM to generate query and document representations for effective document retrieval. Specifically, we prompt the LLMs to represent a given text using a single word, and then use the last token’s hidden states and the corresponding logits associated with the prediction of the next token to construct a hybrid document retrieval... | Shengyao Zhuang, Xueguang Ma, Bevan Koopman, Jimmy Lin, Guido Zuccon |  |

Recent efforts to develop NLP technologies for African languages have focused on their standard dialects, resulting in disparities for dialects and varieties for which there are little to no resources or tools. We take steps towards bridging this gap by introducing a new high-quality parallel text and speech corpus; YORULECT across three domains and four regional yoruba dialects. To develop this corpus, we engaged native speakers, traveling to communities where these dialects are spoken, to collect text and speech data. Using our newly created corpus, we conducted extensive experiments on (text) machine translation, automatic speech recognition, and speech-to-text translation. Our results reveal substantial performance disparities between standard yoruba and the other dialects across all tasks. However, we also show that with dialect-adaptive finetuning, we are able to narrow... | Orevaoghene Ahia, Anuoluwapo Aremu, Diana Abagyan, Hila Gonen, David Ifeoluwa Adelani, Daud Abolade, Noah A.

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and AI Feedback (RLAIF) further refine LLMs by aligning them with specific preferences. These methods primarily use ranking-based feedback for entire generations. With advanced AI models (Teacher), such as GPT-4 and Claude 3 Opus, we can request various types of detailed feedback that are expensive for humans to provide. We propose a two-stage algorithm ARES that Alternates REinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). First, we ask the Teacher to score how much each sentence contributes to solving the problem in a Chain-of-Thought (CoT). This sentence-level feedback allows us to consider individual valuable segments, providing more granular rewards for the RL procedure. Second, we ask the Teacher to correct wrong reasoning after the RL stage. The RL procedure requires substantial... | JuSeung Byun, Jiyun Chun, Jihyung Kil, Andrew Perrault |  |

One of the simplest privacy risks associated with LLMs is their susceptibility to membership inference attacks (MIAs), wherein an adversary aims to determine whether a specific data point was part of the model’s training set. Although this is a known risk, state of the art methodologies for MIAs rely on training multiple computationally costly ‘shadow models’, making risk evaluation prohibitive for large models. Here we adapt a recent line of work which uses quantile regression to mount membership inference attacks; we extend this work by proposing a low-cost MIA that leverages an ensemble of small quantile regression models to determine if a document belongs to the model’s training set or not. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on fine-tuned LLMs of varying families (OPT, Pythia, Llama) and... | Rongting Zhang, Martín Bertrán, Aaron Roth |  |

This limitation stems from the absence of large-scale multimodal prompt video datasets, resulting in a lack of visual grounding and restricting their versatility and application in multimodal integration. To address this, we construct a large-scale multimodal prompt dataset by employing retrieval methods to pair in-context examples with the given text prompts and then utilize a two-stage training strategy to enable diverse video generation tasks within a model. In the first stage, we propose a multimodal conditional video generation framework for pretraining on these augmented datasets, establishing a foundational model for grounded video generation. Secondly, we fine-tune the model from the first stage on various video generation tasks, incorporating multimodal instructions. This process further refines the model’s ability to handle diverse inputs and tasks, ensuring seamless integration... | Yuwei Fang, Willi Menapace, Aliaksandr Siarohin, TsaiShien Chen, KuanChieh Wang, Ivan Skorokhodov, Graham Neubig, Sergey Tulyakov |  |

Evidence-supported counterspeech (CS) is crucial for correcting misinformation and reducing prejudices through facts. Existing methods for generating evidence-supported CS often lack clear guidance with a core claim for organizing evidence and do not adequately address factuality and faithfulness hallucinations in CS within anti-hate contexts. In this paper, to mitigate the aforementioned, we propose F2RL, a Factuality and Faithfulness Reinforcement Learning framework for generating claim-guided and evidence-supported CS. Firstly, we generate counter-claims based on hate speech and design a self-evaluation mechanism to select the most appropriate one. Secondly, we propose a coarse-to-fine evidence retrieval method. This method initially generates broad queries to ensure the diversity of evidence, followed by carefully reranking the retrieved evidence to ensure its relevance to the claim. Finally, we... | Haiyang Wang, Yuchen Pan, Xin Song, Xuechen Zhao, Minghao Hu, Bin Zhou |  |

In this paper, from the perspective of human cognitive subjectivity, we introduce the mining of individual latent intentions and propose a novel multi-task learning framework, the Intent-Aware Rumor Detection Network (IRDNet). IRDNet is designed to discern multi-level rumor semantic features and latent user intentions, addressing the challenges of robustness and key feature mining and alignment that plague existing models. In IRDNet, the multi-level semantic extraction module captures sequential and hierarchical features to generate robust semantic representations. The hierarchical contrastive learning module incorporates two complementary strategies, event-level and intent-level, to establish cognitive anchors that uncover the latent intentions of information disseminators. Event-level contrastive learning employs high-quality data augmentation and adversarial... | Chang Yang, Peng Zhang, Hui Gao, Jing Zhang |  |

Traditional methods in VLLMs struggle with spatial localization and often discard valuable global context. We propose a novel Set-of-Vision prompting (SoV) approach that enhances zero-shot emotion recognition by using spatial information, such as bounding boxes and facial landmarks, to mark targets precisely. SoV improves accuracy in face count and emotion categorization while preserving the enriched image context. Through comprehensive experimentation and analysis of recent commercial or open-source VLLMs, we evaluate the SoV model’s ability to comprehend facial expressions in natural environments. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating spatial visual prompts into VLLMs for improving emotion recognition performance. | Qixuan Zhang, Zhifeng Wang, Dylan Zhang, Wenjia Niu, Sabrina B.

Traditional methods develop algorithms based on expert experience to embed watermarks into the time-domain or transform-domain of signals. With the development of deep neural networks, deep learning-based neural audio watermarking has emerged. Compared to traditional algorithms, neural audio watermarking achieves better robustness by considering various attacks during training. However, current neural watermarking methods suffer from low capacity and unsatisfactory imperceptibility. Additionally, the issue of watermark locating, which is extremely important and even more pronounced in neural audio water- marking, has not been adequately studied. In this paper, we design a dual-embedding wa- termarking model for efficient locating. We also consider the impact of the attack layer on the invertible neural network in robustness training, improving the model to enhance... | Pengcheng Li, Xulong Zhang, Jing Xiao, Jianzong Wang |  |

Each individual may have their own perspective, which can differ. Additionally, commonly referenced offensive datasets frequently neglect contextual information and are primarily constructed with a focus on intended offenses. This study suggests that conflicts are pivotal in revealing a broader range of human interactions, including instances of unintended offensive language. This paper proposes a conflict-based data collection method to utilize inter-conflict cues in multi-person communications. By focusing on specific cue posts within conversation threads, our proposed approach effectively identifies relevant instances for analysis. Detailed analyses are provided to showcase the proposed approach efficiently gathers data on subtly offensive content.

Existing research focuses on generating counterspeech with linguistic attributes such as being polite, informative, and intent-driven. However, the real impact of counterspeech in online environments is seldom considered. This study aims to develop methods for generating counterspeech constrained by conversation outcomes and evaluate their effectiveness. We experiment with large language models (LLMs) to incorporate into the text generation process two desired conversation outcomes: low conversation incivility and non-hateful hater reentry. Specifically, we experiment with instruction prompts, LLM finetuning, and LLM reinforcement learning (RL). Evaluation results show that our methods effectively steer the generation of counterspeech toward the desired outcomes. Our analyses, however, show that there are differences in the quality and style depending on the model. | Lingzi Hong, Pengcheng Luo, Eduardo Blanco, Xiaoying Song |  |

We enhance models by incorporating both token-level and sentence-level translations, utilizing the extensive linguistic capabilities of modern LLMs, and incorporating available dictionary resources. Our enhancements lead to an average absolute improvement of 5%-points in word-level accuracy over the previous state of the art on a typologically diverse dataset spanning six low-resource languages. The improvements are particularly noticeable for the lowest-resourced language Gitksan, where we achieve a 10%-point improvement. Furthermore, in a simulated ultra-low resource setting for the same six languages, training on fewer than 100 glossed sentences, we establish an average 10%-point improvement in word-level accuracy over the previous state-of-the-art system. | Changbing Yang, Garrett Nicolai, Miikka Silfverberg |  |

Most existing text attack methods are designed for English text, while the robust implementation of the second popular language, i.e., Chinese with 1 billion users, is greatly underestimated. Although several Chinese attack methods have been presented, they either directly transfer from English attacks or adopt simple greedy search to optimize the attack priority, usually leading to unnatural sentences. To address these issues, we propose an adaptive Immune-based Sound-Shape Code (ISSC) algorithm for adversarial Chinese text attacks. Firstly, we leverage the Sound-Shape code to generate natural substitutions, which comprehensively integrate multiple Chinese features. Secondly, we employ adaptive immune algorithm (IA) to determine the replacement order, which can reduce the duplication of population to improve the search ability. Extensive experimental results validate the superiority of... | Ao Wang, Xinghao Yang, Chen Li, Baodi Liu, Weifeng Liu |  |

While curriculum learning offers a practical solution by strategically training policies from simple to complex, it hinges on the assumption of a gradual increase in goal difficulty to ensure a smooth knowledge transition across varied complexities. In complex dialogue environments without intermediate goals, achieving seamless knowledge transitions becomes tricky. This paper proposes a novel Bootstrapped Policy Learning (BPL) framework, which adaptively tailors progressively challenging subgoal curriculum for each complex goal through goal shaping, ensuring a smooth knowledge transition. Goal shaping involves goal decomposition and evolution, decomposing complex goals into subgoals with solvable maximum difficulty and progressively increasing difficulty as the policy improves. Moreover, to enhance BPL’s adaptability across various environments, we... | Yangyang Zhao, Ben Niu, Mehdi Dastani, Shihan Wang |  |

Detecting whether users express suicidal ideation in text-based counseling services is crucial for identifying and prioritizing at-risk individuals. However, the lack of domain-specific systems to facilitate fine-grained suicide detection and corresponding risk assessment in online counseling poses a significant challenge for automated crisis intervention aimed at suicide prevention. In this paper, we propose PsyGUARD, an automated system for detecting suicide ideation and assessing risk in psychological counseling. To achieve this, we first develop a detailed taxonomy for detecting suicide ideation based on foundational theories. We then curate a large-scale, high-quality dataset called PsySUICIDE for suicide detection. To evaluate the capabilities of automated systems in fine-grained suicide detection, we establish a range of baselines. Subsequently, to... | Huachuan Qiu, Lizhi Ma, Zhenzhong Lan |  |

The conventional norm in VLM data construction uses a mixture of specialists in caption and OCR, or stronger VLM APIs and expensive human annotation.In this paper, we present World to Code (W2C), a meticulously curated multi-modal data construction pipeline that organizes the final generation output into a Python code format. The pipeline leverages the VLM itself to extract cross-modal information via different prompts and filter the generated outputs again via a consistency filtering strategy. Experiments have demonstrated the high quality of W2C by improving various existing visual question answering and visual grounding benchmarks across different VLMs. Further analysis also demonstrates that the new code parsing ability of VLMs presents better cross-modal equivalence than the commonly used detail caption... | Jiacong Wang, Bohong Wu, Haiyong Jiang, Xun Zhou, Xin Xiao, Haoyuan Guo, Jun Xiao |  |

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers a potential remedy, yet the uneven retrieval quality and irrelevant contents may distract LLMs.In this work, we address these issues at the generation phase by treating RAG as a multi-document QA task.We propose a novel decoding strategy, Dynamic Contrastive Decoding, which dynamically amplifies knowledge from selected documents during the generation phase. involves constructing inputs batchwise, designing new selection criteria to identify documents worth amplifying, and applying contrastive decoding with a specialized weight calculation to adjust the final logits used for sampling answer tokens. Zero-shot experimental results on ALCE-ASQA, NQ, TQA and PopQA benchmarks show that our method outperforms other decoding strategies. Additionally, we conduct experiments to validate the effectiveness of our selection... | Jing Jin, Houfeng Wang, Hao Zhang, Xiaoguang Li, Zhijiang Guo |  |

Large Models Do It the Same Way Too](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.267) |  | 0 | Program-of-Thought (PoT) replaces natural language-based Chain-of-Thought (CoT) as the most popular method in Large Language Models (LLMs) mathematical reasoning tasks by utilizing external tool calls to circumvent computational errors. However, our evaluation of the GPT-4 and Llama series reveals that using PoT introduces more reasoning errors, such as incorrect formulas or flawed logic, compared to CoT. To address this issue, we propose Human-Think Language (HTL), which leverages a suite of strategies that help integrate PoT and CoT, encompassing: (1) a new generation paradigm that uses full CoT reasoning to control code generation. (2) Focus Attention, that directs model attention to the CoT reasoning during PoT to generate more logical code. (3) reinforcement learning that utilizes the accuracy of both CoT and PoT responses as rewards to prevent repetitive reasoning steps in LLMs when solving difficult math problems.

However, existing LLM agent frameworks have not fully utilized past experiences for improvement. This work introduces a new LLM-based agent framework called Retrospex, which addresses this challenge by analyzing past experiences in depth. Unlike previous approaches, Retrospex does not directly integrate experiences into the LLM’s context. Instead, it combines the LLM’s action likelihood with action values estimated by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) Critic, which is trained on past experiences through an offline “retrospection” process. Additionally, Retrospex employs a dynamic action rescoring mechanism that increases the importance of experience-based values for tasks that require more interaction with the environment. We evaluate Retrospex in ScienceWorld, ALFWorld and Webshop environments, demonstrating its advantages over strong... | Yufei Xiang, Yiqun Shen, Yeqin Zhang, CamTu Nguyen |  |

However, through thorough investigations, we find limitations for currently existing evaluations on model’s memory. We provide an extensive survey for limitations in this work and propose a new method called forgetting curve to measure the memorization capability of long-context models. We show that forgetting curve has the advantage of being robust to the tested corpus and the experimental settings, of not relying on prompt and can be applied to any model size. We apply our forgetting curve to a large variety of models involving both transformer and RNN/SSM based architectures. Our measurement provides empirical evidence for the effectiveness of transformer extension techniques while raises questions for the effective length of RNN/SSM based models. We also examine the difference between our measurement and... | Xinyu Liu, Runsong Zhao, Pengcheng Huang, Chunyang Xiao, Bei Li, Jingang Wang, Tong Xiao, JingBo Zhu |  |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which enhances LLMs with external knowledge sources, offers a promising solution. However, these methods can be misled by irrelevant paragraphs in retrieved documents. Due to the inherent uncertainty in LLM generation, inputting the entire document may introduce off-topic information, causing the model to deviate from the central topic and affecting the relevance of the generated content. To address these issues, we propose the Retrieve-Plan-Generation (RPG) framework. RPG generates plan tokens to guide subsequent generation in the plan stage. In the answer stage, the model selects relevant fine-grained paragraphs based on the plan and uses them for further answer generation. This plan-answer process is repeated iteratively until completion, enhancing generation relevance by focusing on... | Yuanjie Lyu, Zihan Niu, Zheyong Xie, Chao Zhang, Tong Xu, Yang Wang, Enhong Chen |  |

Attempts have been made on automatic construction and effective selection for IFT data. However, we posit that previous methods have not fully harnessed the potential of LLMs for enhancing data quality. The responses within IFT data could be further enhanced by leveraging the capabilities of LLMs themselves.In this paper, we propose CoEvol, an LLM-based multi-agent cooperation framework for the improvement of responses for instructions. To effectively refine the responses, we develop an iterative framework following a _debate-advise-edit-judge_ paradigm. A two-stage multi-agent debate strategy is further devised to ensure the diversity and reliability of editing suggestions within the framework. Empirically, models equipped with CoEvol outperform competitive baselines evaluated by MT-Bench and AlpacaEval, demonstrating its... | Renhao Li, Minghuan Tan, Derek F. Wong, Min Yang |  |

We go beyond evaluating LLMs on accuracy; rather, we aim to investigate their token bias in solving logical reasoning tasks. Specifically, we develop carefully controlled synthetic datasets, featuring conjunction fallacy and syllogistic problems. Our framework outlines a list of hypotheses where token biases are readily identifiable, with all null hypotheses assuming genuine reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The findings in this study suggest, with statistical guarantee, that most LLMs still struggle with logical reasoning. While they may perform well on classic problems, their success largely depends on recognizing superficial patterns with strong token bias, thereby raising concerns about their actual reasoning and generalization abilities. | Bowen Jiang, Yangxinyu Xie, Zhuoqun Hao, Xiaomeng Wang, Tanwi Mallick, Weijie Su, Camillo J.

In order to mitigate this problem, we propose two calibration methods, Bayesian Win-Rate Sampling (BWRS) and Bayesian Dawid-Skene, both of which leverage Bayesian inference to more accurately infer the true win rate of generative language models. We empirically validate our methods on six datasets covering story generation, summarization, and instruction following tasks. We show that both our methods are effective in improving the accuracy of win rate estimation using LLMs as evaluators, offering a promising direction for reliable automatic text quality evaluation. | Yicheng Gao, Gonghan Xu, Zhe Wang, Arman Cohan |  |

However, a great method to integrate the above two research paths and combine their advantages remains to be explored. In this work, we firstly include new math questions via \*\*mu\*\*lti-perspective data augmenting methods and then synthesize \*\*code\*\*-nested solutions to them. The open LLMs (e.g., Llama-2) are finetuned on the augmented dataset to get the resulting models, \*\*MuMath-Code\*\* (𝜇-Math-Code). During the inference phase, our MuMath-Code generates code and interacts with the external python interpreter to get the execution results. Therefore, MuMath-Code leverages the advantages of both the external tool and data augmentation. To fully leverage the advantages of our augmented data, we propose a two-stage training... | Shuo Yin, Weihao You, Zhilong Ji, Guoqiang Zhong, Jinfeng Bai |  |

Previous attacks established that such reconstructions are possible using gradients from all parameters in the entire models. However, we hypothesize that most of the involved modules, or even their sub-modules, are at risk of training data leakage, and we validate such vulnerabilities in various intermediate layers of language models. Our extensive experiments reveal that gradients from a single Transformer layer, or even a single linear component with 0.54% parameters, are susceptible to training data leakage. Additionally, we show that applying differential privacy on gradients during training offers limited protection against the novel vulnerability of data disclosure. | Weijun Li, Qiongkai Xu, Mark Dras |  |

This paper further explores CLIP from the perspectives of data and model architecture. To mitigate the impact of the noise data and enhance the quality of large-scale image-text data crawled from the internet, we introduce a diverse description generation framework that can leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to combine and refine information from web-based image-text pairs, synthetic captions, and detection tags. Additionally, we propose RWKV-CLIP, the first RWKV-driven vision-language representation learning model that combines the effective parallel training of transformers with the efficient inference of RNNs. Extensive experiments across different model scales and pre-training datasets demonstrate that RWKV-CLIP is a robust vision-language representation learner and it achieves... | Tiancheng Gu, Kaicheng Yang, Xiang An, Ziyong Feng, Dongnan Liu, Weidong Cai, Jiankang Deng |  |

In this paper, we explore foundational steps toward the development of child-specific language models, emphasizing the necessity of high-quality pre-training data. We introduce a novel user-centric data collection pipeline that involves gathering and validating a corpus specifically written for and sometimes by children. Additionally, we propose a new training objective, Stratified Masking, which dynamically adjusts masking probabilities based on our domain-specific child language data, enabling models to prioritize vocabulary and concepts more suitable for children. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our model excels in understanding lower grade-level text, maintains safety by avoiding stereotypes, and captures children’s... | Mir Tafseer Nayeem, Davood Rafiei |  |

The task of lexical selection requires using context to identify which variation is most appropriate for a source text. We work with native speakers of nine languages to create DTAiLS, a dataset of 1,377 sentence pairs that exhibit cross-lingual concept variation when translating from English. We evaluate recent LLMs and neural machine translation systems on DTAiLS, with the best-performing model, GPT-4, achieving from 67 to 85% accuracy across languages. Finally, we use language models to generate English rules describing target-language concept variations. Providing weaker models with high-quality lexical rules improves accuracy substantially, in some cases reaching or outperforming GPT-4. | Josh Barua, Sanjay Subramanian, Kayo Yin, Alane Suhr |  |

To understand how people perceive writings that are produced under this paradigm, in this paper, we conduct an experimental study to understand whether and how the disclosure of the level and type of AI assistance in the writing process would affect people’s perceptions of the writing on various aspects, including their evaluation on the quality of the writing, and their ranking of different writings. Our results suggest that disclosing the AI assistance in the writing process, especially if AI has provided assistance in generating new content, decreases the average quality ratings for both argumentative essays and creative stories. This decrease in the average quality ratings often comes with an increased level of variations in different individuals’ quality evaluations... | Zhuoyan Li, Chen Liang, Jing Peng, Ming Yin |  |

Language models have significantly enhanced the processing of such records, streamlining workflows and reducing manual data entry, thereby saving healthcare providers significant resources. However, the black-box nature of these models often leaves healthcare professionals hesitant to trust them. State-of-the-art explainability methods increase model transparency but rely on human-annotated evidence spans, which are costly. In this study, we propose an approach to produce plausible and faithful explanations without needing such annotations. We demonstrate on the automated medical coding task that adversarial robustness training improves explanation plausibility and introduce AttInGrad, a new explanation method superior to previous ones. By combining both contributions in a fully unsupervised setup, we produce explanations of comparable... | Joakim Edin, Maria Maistro, Lars Maaløe, Lasse Borgholt, Jakob D.

Effectively managing and utilizing this data to deliver services to users is a compelling research topic. In this paper, we introduce a novel task of crafting personalized agents powered by large language models (LLMs), which utilize a user’s smartphone memories to enhance downstream applications with advanced LLM capabilities. To achieve this goal, we introduce EMG-RAG, a solution that combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques with an Editable Memory Graph (EMG). This approach is further optimized using Reinforcement Learning to address three distinct challenges: data collection, editability, and selectability. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset validate the effectiveness of EMG-RAG, achieving an improvement of approximately 10% over the best existing approach. Additionally, the personalized agents have been transferred into a real... | Zheng Wang, Zhongyang Li, Zeren Jiang, Dandan Tu, Wei Shi |  |

The edited knowledge should propagate and facilitate the deduction of new information based on existing model knowledge. We term the existing related knowledge in LLM serving as the origination of knowledge propagation as ”deduction anchors”. However, current KE approaches, which only operate on (subject, relation, object) triple. We both theoretically and empirically observe that this simplified setting often leads to uncertainty when determining the deduction anchors, causing low confidence in their answers. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel task of event-based knowledge editing that pairs facts with event descriptions. This task manifests not only a closer simulation of real-world editing scenarios but also a more logically sound setting, implicitly defining the deduction anchor and enabling LLMs to propagate knowledge confidently. We curate a new benchmark... | Jiateng Liu, Pengfei Yu, Yuji Zhang, Sha Li, Zixuan Zhang, Ruhi Sarikaya, Kevin Small, Heng Ji |  |

In particular, we pretrain GPT2 on 6 different first languages (L1s), followed by English as the second language (L2). We examine the effect of the choice of pretraining L1 on the model’s ability to predict human reading times, evaluating on English readers from a range of L1 backgrounds. Experimental results show that, while all of the LMs’ word surprisals improve prediction of L2 reading times, especially for human L1s distant from English, there is no reliable effect of the choice of L2LM’s L1. We also evaluate the learning trajectory of a monolingual English LM: for predicting L2 as opposed to L1 reading, it peaks much earlier and immediately falls off, possibly mirroring the difference in proficiency between the native and nonnative populations. Lastly, we provide examples of L2LMs’ surprisals, which could potentially generate hypotheses about human L2 reading. | Tatsuya Aoyama, Nathan Schneider |  |

The problem is challenging, as reasoning data consisting of multiple steps of visual and language processing are barely available. To overcome the challenge, we first introduce a least-to-most visual reasoning paradigm, which interleaves steps of decomposing a question into sub-questions and invoking external tools for resolving sub-questions. Based on the paradigm, we further propose a novel data synthesis approach that can automatically create questions and multi-step reasoning paths for an image in a bottom-up manner. Our approach divides the complex synthesis task into a few simple sub-tasks, and (almost entirely) relies on open-sourced models to accomplish the sub-tasks. Therefore, the entire synthesis process is reproducible and cost-efficient, and the synthesized data is quality guaranteed. With the approach, we construct 50k visual reasoning examples. Then, we develop a visual reasoner through supervised... | Chuanqi Cheng, Jian Guan, Wei Wu, Rui Yan |  |

However, the absence of systematic data quality checks poses complications for properly training and testing models. To that end, we propose two approaches for assessing the reliability of data for training LLMs to use external tools. The first approach uses intuitive, human-defined correctness criteria. The second approach uses a model-driven assessment with in-context evaluation. We conduct a thorough evaluation of data quality on two popular benchmarks, followed by an extrinsic evaluation that showcases the impact of data quality on model performance. Our results demonstrate that models trained on high-quality data outperform those trained on unvalidated data, even when trained with a smaller quantity of data. These findings empirically support the significance of assessing and ensuring the... | Shadi Iskander, Sofia Tolmach, Ori Shapira, Nachshon Cohen, Zohar Karnin |  |

Recent zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) models pose higher risks as they can clone voices with a single utterance. However, the existing ADD datasets are outdated, leading to suboptimal generalization of detection models. In this paper, we construct a new cross-domain ADD dataset comprising over 300 hours of speech data that is generated by five advanced zero-shot TTS models. To simulate real-world scenarios, we employ diverse attack methods and audio prompts from different datasets. Experiments show that, through novel attack-augmented training, the Wav2Vec2-large and Whisper-medium models achieve equal error rates of 4.1% and 6.5% respectively. Additionally, we demonstrate our models’ outstanding few-shot ADD ability by fine-tuning with just one minute of target-domain data.

Most existing methods utilize powerful pre-trained models to transfer visual/linguistic knowledge by full fine-tuning. However, full fine-tuning the entire backbone not only breaks the rich prior knowledge embedded in the pre-training, but also incurs significant computational costs. Motivated by the recent emergence of Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) methods, we aim to solve the REC task in an effective and efficient manner. Directly applying these PETL methods to the REC task is inappropriate, as they lack the specific-domain abilities for precise local visual perception and visual-language alignment. Therefore, we propose a novel framework of Multimodal Prior-guided Parameter Efficient Tuning, namely MaPPER. Specifically, MaPPER comprises Dynamic Prior Adapters guided by a aligned prior, and Local Convolution... | Ting Liu, Zunnan Xu, Yue Hu, Liangtao Shi, Zhiqiang Wang, Quanjun Yin |  |

We develop the DepthQA dataset, deconstructing questions into three depths: (i) recalling conceptual knowledge, (ii) applying procedural knowledge, and (iii) analyzing strategic knowledge. Based on a hierarchical graph, we quantify forward discrepancy, a discrepancy in LLM performance on simpler sub-problems versus complex questions. We also measure backward discrepancy where LLMs answer complex questions but struggle with simpler ones. Our analysis shows that smaller models exhibit more discrepancies than larger models. Distinct patterns of discrepancies are observed across model capacity and possibility of training data memorization.

However, this study reveals the misalignment between the translation-specific understanding and the general understanding inside LLMs. This understanding misalignment leads to LLMs mistakenly or literally translating some complicated concepts that they accurately comprehend in the general scenarios (e.g., QA). To align the translation-specific understanding to the general one, we propose a novel translation process, DUAT (Difficult words Understanding Aligned Translation), explicitly incorporating the general understanding on the complicated content incurring inconsistent understandings to guide the translation. Specifically, DUAT performs cross-lingual interpretation for the difficult-to-translate words and enhances the translation with the generated interpretations. Furthermore, we reframe the external tools to improve... | Yichong Huang, Baohang Li, Xiaocheng Feng, Wenshuai Huo, Chengpeng Fu, Ting Liu, Bing Qin |  |

An Adversarial Dataset to Investigate the Robustness of LMs in Word Sense Disambiguation](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.290) |  | 0 | Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is a key task in natural language processing and lexical semantics. Pre-trained language models with contextualized word embeddings have significantly improved performance in regular WSD tasks. However, these models still struggle with recognizing semantic boundaries and often misclassify homonyms in adversarial context. Therefore, we propose FOOL: FOur-fold Obscure Lexical, a new coarse-grained WSD dataset, which includes four different test sets designed to assess the robustness of language models in WSD tasks.

However, training on large VL datasets can become prohibitively expensive. In this work, we introduce COINCIDE, an effective and scalable data selection technique that uses a small model as a reference model to select visual instruction tuning data for efficient finetuning of a target LVLM, focusing on diversity and transferability. Specifically, we cluster the training data using internal activations from a small model, which identifies VL concept-skill compositions needed by a target LVLM. We then sample data from these diverse clusters by considering their density and transferability, or the ability to transfer well to other concept-skill compositions. This approach ensures the diversity of these compositions, which is vital for LVLM generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate... | Jaewoo Lee, Boyang Li, Sung Ju Hwang |  |

Instead, wepresent a comparative analysis to identify and distinguish LLM activities from human activities. Two research goals: i) Enable better recognition of instances when someone implicitly uses LLMs for reviewing activities; ii) Increase community awareness that LLMs, and AI in general, are currently inadequate for performing tasks that require a high level of expertise and nuanced judgment.This work is motivated by two key trends. On one hand, large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable versatility in various generative tasks such as writing, drawing, and question answering, significantly reducing the time required for many routine tasks. On the other hand, researchers, whose work is not only time-consuming but also highly expertise-demanding, face increasing challenges as they have to spend more time reading, writing, and reviewing papers.

While impressive, this has concentrated research on creating and adapting general-purpose models to improve NLP leaderboard standings for large language models. However, leaderboards collect many individual tasks and general-purpose models often underperform in specialized domains; domain-specific or adapted models yield superior results. This focus on large general-purpose models excludes many academics and draws attention away from areas where they can make important contributions. We advocate for a renewed focus on developing and evaluating domain- and task-specific models, and highlight the unique role of academics in this endeavor. | Mark Dredze, Genta Indra Winata, Prabhanjan Kambadur, Shijie Wu, Ozan Irsoy, Steven Lu, Vadim Dabravolski, David S.

MT metrics provide an absolute score (e.g., from 0 to 1) to a candidate sentence based on the similarity with the reference sentence. Thus, existing MT metrics give the maximum score to the reference sentence. However, this approach overlooks the potential for a candidate sentence to exceed the reference sentence in terms of quality. In particular, recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have highlighted this issue, as LLM-generated sentences often exceed the quality of human-written sentences. To address the problem, we introduce the Residual score Metric (ResuMe), which evaluates the relative quality between reference and candidate sentences. ResuMe assigns a positive score to candidate sentences that outperform their reference sentences, and a negative score when they fall short. By adding the residual scores from ResuMe to... | Keonwoong Noh, Seokjin Oh, Woohwan Jung |  |

Although this impressive ability makes LLMs flexible task solvers, their performance in solving tasks also heavily relies on instructions. In this paper, we reveal that LLMs are over-sensitive to lexical variations in task instructions, even when the variations are imperceptible to humans. By providing models with neighborhood instructions, which are closely situated in the latent representation space and differ by only one semantically similar word, the performance on downstream tasks can be vastly different. Following this property, we propose a black-box Combinatorial Optimization framework for Prompt Lexical Enhancement (COPLE). COPLE performs iterative lexical optimization according to the feedback from a batch of proxy tasks, using a search strategy related to word influence. Experiments show that even widely-used human-crafted prompts for current benchmarks... | Pengwei Zhan, Zhen Xu, Qian Tan, Jie Song, Ru Xie |  |

However, prevailing AI models suffer from a significant lack of representation of texts, images, and audio datasets from SEA, compromising the quality of AI models for SEA languages. Evaluating models for SEA languages is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality datasets, compounded by the dominance of English training data, raising concerns about potential cultural misrepresentation. To address these challenges, through a collaborative movement, we introduce SEACrowd, a comprehensive resource center that fills the resource gap by providing standardized corpora in nearly 1,000 SEA languages across three modalities. Through our SEACrowd benchmarks, we assess the quality of AI models on 36 indigenous languages across 13 tasks, offering valuable insights into the current AI landscape in SEA.

However, existing methods often rely on large datasets or numerous examples, which is impractical and costly in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a low-cost, task-level framework called Induct-Learn. It induces pseudo instructions from a few demonstrations and a short phrase, adding a CoT process into existing demonstrations. When encountering new problems, the learned pseudo instructions and demonstrations with the pseudo CoT process can be combined into a prompt to guide the LLM’s problem-solving process. We validate our approach on the BBH-Induct and Evals-Induct datasets, and the results show that the Induct-Learn framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods. We also exhibit cross-model adaptability and achieve superior performance at a lower cost compared to existing methods. | PoChun Chen, ShengLun Wei, HenHsen Huang, HsinHsi Chen |  |

However, LLMs are also prone to generate nonfactual content. Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is pivotal in enhancing our understanding of a model’s confidence on its generation, thereby aiding in the mitigation of nonfactual outputs. Existing research on UQ predominantly targets short text generation, typically yielding brief, word-limited responses. However, real-world applications frequently necessitate much longer responses. Our study first highlights the limitations of current UQ methods in handling long text generation. We then introduce Luq and its two variations, a series of novel sampling-based UQ approaches specifically designed for long text. Our findings reveal that Luq outperforms existing baseline methods in correlating with the model’s factuality scores (negative coefficient of -0.85 observed for Gemini Pro). To further improve the factuality of LLM responses, we propose... | Caiqi Zhang, Fangyu Liu, Marco Basaldella, Nigel Collier |  |

This lack of transparency poses challenges to scientific evaluation and ethical deployment. Recently, pretraining data detection approaches, which infer whether a given text was part of an LLM’s training data through black-box access, have been explored. The Min-K% Prob method, which has achieved state-of-the-art results, assumes that a non-training example tends to contain a few outlier words with low token probabilities. However, the effectiveness may be limited as it tends to misclassify non-training texts that contain many common words with high probabilities predicted by LLMs. To address this issue, we introduce a divergence-based calibration method, inspired by the divergence-from-randomness concept, to calibrate token probabilities for pretraining data detection. We compute the cross-entropy (i.e., the divergence) between the... | Weichao Zhang, Ruqing Zhang, Jiafeng Guo, Maarten de Rijke, Yixing Fan, Xueqi Cheng |  |

Previous work used domain-specific proof generation algorithms, which biases reasoning toward specific proof traces and limits auditability and extensibility. We present a simpler and more general declarative framework with flexible context-sensitive rules binding multiple languages (specifically, simplified English and the TPTP theorem-proving language). We construct first-order logic problems by selecting up to 32 premises and one hypothesis. We demonstrate that using semantic constraints during generation and careful English verbalization of predicates enhances logical reasoning without hurting natural English tasks. Using relatively small DeBERTa-v3 models, we achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on the FOLIO human-authored logic dataset, surpassing GPT-4 in accuracy with or without an external solver by... | Damien Sileo |  |

Generating speech through a pipeline that operates at the text level typically loses nuances, intonations, and non-verbal vocalizations. Modeling directly from speech opens up the path to more natural and expressive systems. On the other hand, speech-only systems require up to three orders of magnitude more data to catch up to their text-based counterparts in terms of their semantic abilities. We show that fine-tuning speech representation models on phoneme classification leads to more context-invariant representations, and language models trained on these units achieve comparable lexical comprehension to ones trained on hundred times more data. | Maxime Poli, Emmanuel Chemla, Emmanuel Dupoux |  |

However, due to privacy concerns, this data is often dispersed in multiple silos, making its secure utilization for LLM training a challenge. Federated learning (FL) is an ideal solution for training models with distributed private data, but traditional frameworks like FedAvg are unsuitable for LLM due to their high computational demands on clients. An alternative, split learning, offloads most training parameters to the server while training embedding and output layers locally, making it more suitable for LLM. Nonetheless, it faces significant challenges in security and efficiency. Firstly, the gradients of embeddings are prone to attacks, leading to potential reverse engineering of private data. Furthermore, the server’s limitation of handling only one client’s training request at a time hinders parallel training, severely impacting training efficiency.

However, pretraining data tends to contain misleading and even conflicting information, and it is intriguing to understand how LLMs handle these noisy data during training. In this study, we systematically analyze LLMs’ learning preferences for data with conflicting knowledge. We find that pretrained LLMs establish learning preferences similar to humans, i.e., preferences towards formal texts and texts with fewer spelling errors, resulting in faster learning and more favorable treatment of knowledge in data with such features when facing conflicts. This finding is generalizable across models and languages and is more evident in larger models. An in-depth analysis reveals that LLMs tend to trust data with features that signify consistency with the majority of data, and it is possible to instill new preferences and erase old ones by manipulating the... | Jiahuan Li, Yiqing Cao, Shujian Huang, Jiajun Chen |  |

However, this effectiveness hinges on the appropriate selection of in-context examples, a process currently biased towards visual data, overlooking textual information. More importantly, the area of supervised retrievers for retrieval of multimodal in-context learning, crucial for optimal in-context example selection, continues to be investigated. Our study provides an in-depth evaluation of the impact of textual information on the unsupervised selection of in-context examples in multimodal contexts, uncovering a notable sensitivity of retriever performance to the employed modalities. Based on the above finding, we introduce a novel supervised MLLM prompt retriever MSIER that leverages a trained retriever based on MLLM’s confidence to select examples,... | Yang Luo, Zangwei Zheng, Zirui Zhu, Yang You |  |

This leads to a recent trend in exploiting large language models (LLMs) for generating diverse data for potential scalable and efficient solutions. However, the extent to which LLMs can generate diverse perspectives on subjective topics is still unclear. In this study, we explore LLMs’ capacity of generating diverse perspectives and rationales on subjective topics such as social norms and argumentative texts. We introduce the problem of extracting maximum diversity from LLMs. Motivated by how humans form opinions based on values, we propose a criteria-based prompting technique to ground diverse opinions. To see how far we can extract diverse perspectives from LLMs, or called diversity coverage, we employ a step-by-step recall prompting to generate more outputs from the model iteratively. Our methods, applied to various tasks, show that LLMs can indeed produce diverse opinions according to the degree of task subjectivity.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled in-context learning (ICL), allowing LLMs to acquire proficiency in a specific task using only a few demonstration samples (exemplars). A critical challenge in ICL is the selection of optimal exemplars, which can be either task-specific (static) or test-example-specific (dynamic). Static exemplars provide faster inference times and increased robustness across a distribution of test examples. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for static exemplar subset selection for complex reasoning tasks. We introduce EXPLORA, a novel exploration method designed to estimate the parameters of the scoring function, which evaluates exemplar subsets without incorporating confidence information. EXPLORA significantly reduces the number of LLM calls to ~11% of those required by state-of-the-art methods and achieves a substantial... | Kiran Purohit, Venktesh V, Raghuram Devalla, Krishna Yerragorla, Sourangshu Bhattacharya, Avishek Anand |  |

These objectives can be achieved by training either interpretable feature-based models (which often involve costly human annotations) or neural models such as pre-trained language models (which have empirically shown higher task accuracy but lack interpretability). In this paper we propose an LLM feature-based framework for dialogue constructiveness assessment that combines the strengths of feature-based and neural approaches, while mitigating their downsides. The framework first defines a set of dataset-independent and interpretable linguistic features, which can be extracted by both prompting an LLM and simple heuristics. Such features are then used to train LLM feature-based... | Lexin Zhou, Youmna Farag, Andreas Vlachos |  |

The field has witnessed numerous methods following the retrieve-then-generate paradigm and training their systems on one specific domain. However, existing approaches still suffer from the Distractive Attributes Problem (DAP): struggling to deal with false but similar knowledge (hard negative entities), which is even more intractable when countless pieces of knowledge from different domains are blended in a real-world scenario. To alleviate DAP, we propose the Relevance-aware Adaptive Learning (ReAL) method, a two-stage training framework that eliminates hard negatives step-by-step and aligns retrieval with generation. In the first stage, we introduce a top-k adaptive contrastive loss and utilize the divergence-driven feedback from the frozen generator to pre-train the retriever. In the second stage, we propose using the... | Zhanpeng Chen, Zhihong Zhu, Wanshi Xu, Xianwei Zhuang, Yuexian Zou |  |

Automating this process could significantly accelerate the manual design of workflows in new domains and enable the grounding of large language models in domain-specific flowcharts, enhancing transparency and controllability.In this paper, we introduce Dialog2Flow (D2F) embeddings, which differ from conventional sentence embeddings by mapping utterances to a latent space where they are grouped according to their communicative and informative functions (i.e., the actions they represent). D2F allows for modeling dialogs as continuous trajectories in a latent space with distinct action-related regions. By clustering D2F embeddings, the latent space is quantized, and dialogs can be converted into sequences of region/action IDs, facilitating the extraction of the underlying workflow.To pre-train D2F, we build a comprehensive dataset by unifying... | Sergio Burdisso, Srikanth R.

In this paper, we examine how prompts affect image variability in black-box diffusion-based models. We propose W1KP, a human-calibrated measure of variability in a set of images, bootstrapped from existing image-pair perceptual distances. Current datasets do not cover recent diffusion models, thus we curate three test sets for evaluation. Our best perceptual distance outperforms nine baselines by up to 18 points in accuracy, and our calibration matches graded human judgements 78% of the time. Using W1KP, we study prompt reusability and show that Imagen prompts can be reused for 10-50 random seeds before new images become too similar to already generated images, while Stable Diffusion XL and DALL-E 3 can be reused 50-200 times. Lastly, we analyze 56 linguistic features of real prompts, finding that the prompt’s length, CLIP embedding norm, concreteness, and word... | Raphael Tang, Xinyu Zhang, Lixinyu Xu, Yao Lu, Wenyan Li, Pontus Stenetorp, Jimmy Lin, Ferhan Ture |  |

We audit MISTRAL and MIXTRAL models and evaluate their accuracy in predicting the stance of political parties based on the latest “EU and I” voting assistance questionnaire. Furthermore, we explore alternatives to improve models’ performance by augmenting the input context via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) relying on web search, and Self-Reflection using staged conversations that aim to re-collect relevant content from the model’s internal memory. We find that MIXTRAL is highly accurate with an 82% accuracy on average with a significant performance disparity across different political groups (50-95%). Augmenting the input context with expert-curated information can lead to a significant boost of approx. 9%, which remains an open challenge for automated RAG approaches, even considering curated content. | Ilias Chalkidis |  |

Existing approaches do not differentiate the question difficulty when designing prompting methods for them. Clearly, a simple method cannot elicit sufficient knowledge from LLMs to answer a hard question. Meanwhile, a sophisticated one will force the LLM to generate redundant or even inaccurate intermediate steps toward a simple question. Consequently, the performance of existing methods fluctuates among various questions.In this work, we propose Adaption-of-Thought (AdoT), an adaptive method to improve LLMs for the reasoning problem, which first measures the question difficulty and then tailors demonstration set construction and difficulty-adapted retrieval strategies for the adaptive demonstration construction.

Due to the vast number of entity pairs, fully annotating all fact triplets is challenging, resulting in datasets with numerous false negative samples. Recently, self-training-based methods have been introduced to address this issue. However, these methods are purely black-box and sub-symbolic, making them difficult to interpret and prone to overlooking symbolic interdependencies between relations.To remedy this deficiency, our insight is that symbolic knowledge, such as logical rules, can be used as diagnostic tools to identify conflicts between pseudo-labels. By resolving these conflicts through logical diagnoses, we can correct erroneous pseudo-labels, thus enhancing the training of neural models.To achieve this, we propose \*\*LogicST\*\*, a neural-logic self-training framework that iteratively resolves conflicts and constructs the minimal diagnostic set for updating... | Shengda Fan, Yanting Wang, Shasha Mo, Jianwei Niu |  |

We hypothesize this is a result of implicit vector space alignment. Evaluating such alignment, we see that larger models exhibit very high-quality linear alignments between corresponding concepts in different languages. Our experiments show that multilingual LLMs suffer from two familiar weaknesses: generalization works best for languages with similar typology, and for abstract concepts. For some models, e.g., the Llama-2 family of models, prompt-based embeddings align better than word embeddings, but the projections are less linear – an observation that holds across almost all model families, indicating that some of the implicitly learned alignments are broken somewhat by prompt-based methods. | Qiwei Peng, Anders Søgaard |  |

However, this solution introduces substantial time and space overhead due to the separate models required. This work proposes Non-disruptive parameters insertion (Otter), inserting extra parameters into the transformer architecture to predict calibration signals along with the original LLM output. Otter offers state-of-the-art performance on multiple demanding tasks while saving up to 86.5% extra space and 98.5% extra time. Furthermore, Otter seamlessly integrates with existing inference engines, requiring only a one-line code change, and the original model response remains accessible after the parameter insertion. | Chenhan Yuan, Fei Huang, Ru Peng, Keming Lu, Bowen Yu, Chang Zhou, Jingren Zhou |  |

Based on the investigation, we find that: 1) the mainstream, English-dominated LM GPT-3.5 has limited capability in understanding the Norwegian context; 2) the increase in model parameter scales demonstrates limited impact on the performance of downstream tasks when the pre-training dataset is constrained in size; 3) smaller... | Peng Liu, Lemei Zhang, Terje Nissen Farup, Even W.

RSA-Control directs the generation process by recursively reasoning between imaginary speakers and listeners, enhancing the likelihood that target attributes are correctly interpreted by listeners amidst distractors. Additionally, we introduce a self-adjustable rationality parameter, which allows for automatic adjustment of control strength based on context.

Our work investigates the transferability and discrepancies of scaling laws between Dense Models and Mixture of Experts (MoE) models. Through a combination of theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, including consistent loss scaling, optimal batch size/learning rate scaling, and resource allocation strategies scaling, our findings reveal that the power-law scaling framework also applies to MoE Models, indicating that the fundamental principles governing the scaling behavior of these models are preserved, even though the architecture differs. Additionally, MoE Models demonstrate superior generalization, resulting in lower testing losses with the same training compute budget compared to Dense Models. These findings indicate the scaling consistency and transfer generalization capabilities of MoE Models, providing new insights for... | Siqi Wang, Zhengyu Chen, Bei Li, Keqing He, Min Zhang, Jingang Wang |  |

In contrast, large language model (LLM) based TOD systems can excel even with limited data due to their ability to learn tasks through in-context exemplars. However, these models lack alignment with the style of responses in training data and often generate comprehensive responses, making it difficult for users to grasp the information quickly. In response, we propose SyncTOD that synergizes LLMs with task-specific hints to improve alignment in low-data settings. SyncTOD employs small auxiliary models to provide hints and select exemplars for in-context prompts. With ChatGPT, SyncTOD achieves superior performance compared to LLM-based baselines and SoTA models in low-data settings, while retaining competitive performance in full-data settings. | Vishal Vivek Saley, Rocktim Jyoti Das, Dinesh Raghu, Mausam |  |

Despite the extensive efforts on RAG research, in existing methods, LLMs cannot precisely assess the relevance of retrieved documents, thus likely leading to misleading or even incorrect utilization of external knowledge (i.e., retrieved documents). To address this issue, in this paper, we propose REAR, a RElevance-Aware Retrieval-augmented approach for open-domain question answering (QA). As the key motivation, we aim to enhance the self-awareness regarding the reliability of external knowledge for LLMs, so as to adaptively utilize external knowledge in RAG systems. Specially, we develop a novel architecture for LLM based RAG system, by incorporating a specially designed assessnent module that precisely assesses the relevance of retrieved documents. Furthermore, we propose an improved training method based on... | Yuhao Wang, Ruiyang Ren, Junyi Li, Xin Zhao, Jing Liu, JiRong Wen |  |

Meanwhile, benchmarks for evaluating long-context language models are gradually catching up. However, existing benchmarks employ irrelevant noise texts to artificially extend the length of test cases, diverging from the real-world scenarios of long-context applications. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel long-context benchmark, Loong, aligning with realistic scenarios through extended multi-document question answering (QA). Unlike typical document QA, in Loong’s test cases, each document is relevant to the final answer, ignoring any document will lead to the failure of the answer. Furthermore, Loong introduces four types of tasks with a range of context lengths: Spotlight Locating, Comparison, Clustering, and Chain of Reasoning, to facilitate a more realistic and comprehensive evaluation of long-context understanding.... | Minzheng Wang, Longze Chen, Fu Cheng, Shengyi Liao, Xinghua Zhang, Bingli Wu, Haiyang Yu, Nan Xu, Lei Zhang, Run Luo, Yunshui Li, Min Yang, Fei Huang, Yongbin Li |  |

We compare the impact on gender disparity of different fine-tuning algorithms for automated speech recognition across model sizes, languages and gender. We look at both performance-focused and fairness-promoting algorithms. Across languages, we see slightly better performance for female speakers for larger models regardless of the fine-tuning algorithm. The best trade-off between performance and parity is found using adapter fusion. Fairness-promoting fine-tuning algorithms (Group-DRO and Spectral Decoupling) hurt performance compared to adapter fusion with only slightly better performance parity. LoRA increases disparities slightly. Fairness-mitigating fine-tuning techniques led to slightly higher variance in performance across languages, with the exception of adapter fusion. | Monorama Swain, Anna Zee, Anders Søgaard |  |

One solution consistently appearing in recent literature has been the integration of Differential Privacy (DP) into NLP techniques. In this paper, we take these approaches into critical view, discussing the restrictions that DP integration imposes, as well as bring to light the challenges that such restrictions entail. To accomplish this, we focus on \*\*DP-Prompt\*\*, a recent method for text privatization leveraging language models to rewrite texts. In particular, we explore this rewriting task in multiple scenarios, both with DP and without DP. To drive the discussion on the merits of DP in NLP, we conduct empirical utility and privacy experiments. Our results demonstrate the need for more discussion on the usability of DP in NLP and its benefits over non-DP approaches. | Stephen Meisenbacher, Florian Matthes |  |

Based on the integration position, MLLMs can be categorized into external and internal fusion architectures, with the former being more predominant. However, there remains considerable debate on how to construct the optimal external fusion MLLM architecture, especially regarding the performance of different connectors on tasks with varying granularities. This paper systematically investigates the impact of connectors on MLLM performance. Specifically, we classify connectors into feature-preserving and feature-compressing types. Utilizing a unified classification standard, we categorize sub-tasks from three comprehensive benchmarks, MMBench, MME, and SEED-Bench, into three task types: coarse-grained perception, fine-grained perception, and reasoning, and evaluate the performance from this perspective. Our findings reveal significant performance differences... | Junyan Lin, Haoran Chen, Dawei Zhu, Xiaoyu Shen |  |

However, these improvements only apply to a small subset of the world’s languages. An increasing number of papers aspires to enhance generalizable multilingual performance across languages. To this end, linguistic typology is commonly used to motivate language selection, on the basis that a broad typological sample ought to imply generalization across a broad range of languages. These selections are often described as being typologically diverse. In this meta-analysis, we systematically investigate NLP research that includes claims regarding typological diversity. We find there are no set definitions or criteria for such claims. We introduce metrics to approximate the diversity of resulting language samples along several axes and find that the results vary considerably across papers. Crucially, we show that skewed language selection can... | Esther Ploeger, Wessel Poelman, Miryam de Lhoneux, Johannes Bjerva |  |

This is also true in online discussion spaces like social media platforms. To date, much social media research has focused on preventing ills—like political polarization and the spread of misinformation. While this is important, enhancing the quality of online public discourse requires not just reducing ills, but also, promoting foundational human virtues. In this study, we focus on one particular virtue: “intellectual humility” (IH), or acknowledging the potential limitations in one’s own beliefs. Specifically, we explore the development of computational methods for measuring IH at scale. We manually curate and validate an IH codebook on 350 posts about religion drawn from subreddits and use them to develop LLM-based models for automating this measurement. Our best model achieves a Macro-F1 score of 0.64 across labels (and 0.70 when... | Xiaobo Guo, Neil Potnis, Melody Yu, Nabeel Gillani, Soroush Vosoughi |  |

Bidirectionality has been introduced to address those deficiencies. However, a crucial shortcoming of bidirectional language models is the potential inconsistency of their conditional distributions. This fundamental flaw greatly diminishes their applicability and hinders their capability of tractable sampling and likelihood computation. In this work, we introduce a class of bidirectional language models, called latent language models, that are consistent by definition and can be efficiently used both for generation and scoring of sequences. We define latent language models based on the well-understood formalism of bisequential decompositions from automata theory. This formal correspondence allows us to precisely charaterise the abilities and limitations of a subclass of latent language models, called rational language models.

However, their performance has been typically assessed on general scene understanding - recognizing objects, attributes, and actions - rather than cultural comprehension. This study introduces CulturalVQA, a visual question-answering benchmark aimed at assessing VLM’s geo-diverse cultural understanding. We curate a diverse collection of 2,378 image-question pairs with 1-5 answers per question representing cultures from 11 countries across 5 continents. The questions probe understanding of various facets of culture such as clothing, food, drinks, rituals, and traditions. Benchmarking VLMs on CulturalVQA, including GPT-4V and Gemini, reveals disparity in their level of cultural understanding across regions, with strong cultural understanding capabilities for North America while significantly weaker capabilities for Africa.... | Shravan Nayak, Kanishk Jain, Rabiul Awal, Siva Reddy, Sjoerd van Steenkiste, Lisa Anne Hendricks, Karolina Stanczak, Aishwarya Agrawal |  |

In order to better describe CS speech the Matrix Language Frame (MLF) theory introduces the concept of a Matrix Language, which is the language that provides the grammatical structure for a CS utterance. In this work the MLF theory was used to develop systems for Matrix Language Identity (MLID) determination. The MLID of English/Mandarin and English/Spanish CS text and speech was compared to acoustic language identity (LID), which is a typical way to identify a language in monolingual utterances. MLID predictors from audio show higher correlation with the textual principles than LID in all cases while also outperforming LID in an MLID recognition task based on F1 macro (60%) and correlation score (0.38). This novel approach has identified that non-English languages (Mandarin and Spanish) are preferred over the English language as the ML... | Olga Iakovenko, Thomas Hain |  |

Recent studies have shown that large language models (LLMs) and vision large language models (VLLMs) possess EI and the ability to understand emotional stimuli in the form of text and images, respectively. However, factors influencing the emotion prediction performance of VLLMs in real-world conversational contexts have not been sufficiently explored. This study aims to analyze the key elements affecting the emotion prediction performance of VLLMs in conversational contexts systematically. To achieve this, we reconstructed the MELD dataset, which is based on the popular TV series Friends, and conducted experiments through three sub-tasks: overall emotion tone prediction, character emotion prediction, and contextually appropriate emotion expression selection. We evaluated the performance... | Jaewook Lee, Yeajin Jang, Hongjin Kim, Woojin Lee, Harksoo Kim |  |

One particular issue stems from the high latency associated with auto-regressive generation in LLMs, rendering the largest LLMs difficult to use without advanced computing infrastructure. Assisted decoding, where a smaller draft model guides a larger expert model’s generation, has helped alleviate this concern, but remains dependent on alignment between the two models. Thus if the draft model is insufficiently capable on some domain of interest relative to the target model, performance can degrade. Alternatively, one can leverage multiple draft models to better cover the expertise of the target, but when multiple black-box draft models are available, selecting an assistant without details about its construction can be difficult. To better understand this decision making problem, we observe it as a... | Jerry Huang, Prasanna Parthasarathi, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Sarath Chandar |  |

Previous distillation methods usually utilize the capabilities of LLMs to generate chain-of-thought (CoT) samples and teach SLMs via fine-tuning. However, such a standard distillation approach performs poorly when applied to out-of-distribution (OOD) examples, and the diversity of the generated CoT samples is insufficient. In this work, we propose a novel counterfactual distillation framework. Firstly, we leverage LLMs to automatically generate high-quality counterfactual data. Given an input text example, our method generates a counterfactual example that is very similar to the original input, but its task label has been changed to the desired one. Then, we utilize multi-view CoT to enhance the diversity of reasoning samples. Experiments on four NLP benchmarks show that our approach enhances the reasoning capabilities of SLMs... | Tao Feng, Yicheng Li, Chenglin Li, Hao Chen, Fei Yu, Yin Zhang |  |

Our simple methodology consists of translating large amounts of web-crawled monolingual documents (clean) into the LRLs, followed by filtering the translated documents using tiny LMs trained on small but clean LRL data. Taking the case of Indian languages, we pre-train LMs from scratch with 28M and 85M parameters, and then fine-tune them for 5 downstream natural language understanding (NLU) and 4 generative (NLG) tasks. We observe that pre-training on filtered synthetic data leads to relative performance drops of only 0.87% for NLU and 2.35% for NLG, compared to pre-training on clean data, and this gap further diminishes upon the inclusion of a small amount of clean data. We also study the impact of synthetic data filtering and the choice of source language for synthetic data generation. Furthermore,... | Meet Doshi, Raj Dabre, Pushpak Bhattacharyya |  |

In this work, through a multimodal, multilingual retrieval case study, we quantify the existing lack of model flexibility. We empirically show performance gaps between training on captions that come from native German perception and captions that have been either machine-translated or human-translated from English into German. To address these gaps, we further propose and evaluate caption augmentation strategies. While we achieve mean recall improvements (+1.3), gaps still remain, indicating an open area of future work for the community. | Kyle Buettner, Adriana Kovashka |  |

Knowledge distillation is an efficient method to compress models, which transfers knowledge from strong teacher models to weak student models. Previous studies have proved the effectiveness of knowledge distillation in DPR. However, there often remains a significant performance gap between the teacher and the distilled student. To narrow this performance gap, we propose MTA4DPR, a Multi-Teaching-Assistants based iterative knowledge distillation method for Dense Passage Retrieval, which transfers knowledge from the teacher to the student with the help of multiple assistants in an iterative manner; with each iteration, the student learns from more performant assistants and more difficult data. The experimental results show that our 66M student model achieves the state-of-the-art... | Qixi Lu, Endong Xun, Gongbo Tang |  |

In this study, we investigate the frequency of (anti-)solidarity towards women and migrants in German parliamentary debates between 1867 and 2022. Using 2,864 manually annotated text snippets, we evaluate large language models (LLMs) like Llama 3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. We find that GPT-4 outperforms other models, approaching human annotation accuracy. Using GPT-4, we automatically annotate 18,300 further instances and find that solidarity with migrants outweighs anti-solidarity but that frequencies and solidarity types shift over time. Most importantly, group-based notions of (anti-)solidarity fade in favor of compassionate solidarity, focusing on the vulnerability of migrant groups, and exchange-based anti-solidarity, focusing on the lack of (economic) contribution. This study highlights the interplay of historical events, socio-economic needs, and political ideologies in shaping migration discourse and social... | Aida Kostikova, Dominik Beese, Benjamin Paassen, Ole Pütz, Gregor Wiedemann, Steffen Eger |  |

Recent research has identified that a large portion of hidden states within the key-value caches of Transformer models can be discarded (also termed evicted) withoutaffecting the perplexity performance in generating long sequences. However, we show that these methods, despite preserving perplexity performance, often drop information that is important for solving downstream tasks, a problem which we call information neglect. To address this issue, we introduce Chunked Instruction-aware State Eviction (CItruS), a novel modeling technique that integrates the attention preferences useful for a downstream task into the eviction process of hidden states. In addition, we design a method for chunked sequence processing to further improve efficiency. Our training-free method exhibits superior performance on long sequence comprehension and retrieval tasks over several strong baselines under the... | Yu Bai, Xiyuan Zou, Heyan Huang, Sanxing Chen, MarcAntoine Rondeau, Yang Gao, Jackie C.

The proposed model creates embeddings that represent a story such that similar narratives, that is, reformulations of the same story, will result in similar embeddings. We showcase the prowess of our narrative-focused embeddings on various datasets, exhibiting state-of-the-art performance on multiple retrieval tasks. The embeddings also show promising results on a narrative understanding task. Additionally, we perform an annotation-based evaluation to validate that our introduced computational notion of narrative similarity aligns with human perception. The approach can help to explore vast datasets of stories, with potential applications in recommender systems and in the computational analysis of literature. | Hans Ole Hatzel, Chris Biemann |  |

Despite Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit robust capabilities and are widely applied in various tasks, their performance on CSC is often unsatisfactory. We find that LLMs fail to meet the Chinese character-level constraints of the CSC task, namely equal length and phonetic similarity, leading to a performance bottleneck. Further analysis reveals that this issue stems from the granularity of tokenization, as current mixed character-word tokenization struggles to satisfy these character-level constraints. To address this issue, we propose C-LLM, a Large Language Model-based Chinese Spell Checking method that learns to check errors Character by Character. Character-level tokenization enables the model to learn character-level alignment, effectively mitigating issues related to character-level constraints. Furthermore, CSC is simplified to replication-dominated and substitution-supplemented tasks.... | Kunting Li, Yong Hu, Liang He, Fandong Meng, Jie Zhou |  |

Recently, a lot of methods have been put forward to further expand the context window based on RoPE. The core concept of those methods is to predefine or search for a set of factors to rescale the base frequencies of RoPE. Nevertheless, it is quite a challenge for existing methods to predefine an optimal factor due to the exponential search space. In view of this, we introduce PSC (Phase Shift Calibration), a small module for calibrating the frequencies predefined by existing methods. With the employment of PSC, we demonstrate that many existing methods can be further enhanced, like PI, YaRN, and LongRoPE. We conducted extensive experiments across multiple models and tasks. The results demonstrate that (1) when PSC is enabled, the comparative reductions in perplexity increase as the context window size is varied from 16k, to 32k, and up to 64k.... | Wenqiao Zhu, Chao Xu, Lulu Wang, Jun Wu |  |

Most existing approaches encode images and videos into separate feature spaces, which are then fed as inputs to large language models. However, due to the lack of unified tokenization for images and videos, namely misalignment before projection, it becomes challenging for a Large Language Model (LLM) to learn multi-modal interactions from several poor projection layers.In this work, we unify visual representation into the language feature space to advance the foundational LLM towards a unified LVLM. As a result, we establish a simple but robust LVLM baseline, Video-LLaVA, which learns from a mixed dataset of images and videos, mutually enhancing each other.As a result, Video-LLaVA outperforms Video-ChatGPT by 5.8%, 9.9%, 18.6%, and 10.1% on MSRVTT, MSVD, TGIF, and ActivityNet, respectively. Additionally, our Video-LLaVA also achieves superior performances on a... | Bin Lin, Yang Ye, Bin Zhu, Jiaxi Cui, Munan Ning, Peng Jin, Li Yuan |  |

Previous work has elicited confidence from LLMs by direct or self-consistency prompting, or constructing specific datasets for supervised finetuning. The prompting-based approaches have inferior performance, and the training-based approaches are limited to binary or inaccurate group-level confidence estimates. In this work, we present SaySelf, a novel training framework that teaches LLMs to express more fine-grained confidence estimates. In addition, beyond the confidence scores, SaySelf initiates the process of directing LLMs to produce self-reflective rationales that clearly identify gaps in their parametric knowledge and explain their uncertainty. This is achieved by using an LLM to automatically summarize the uncertainties in specific knowledge via natural language. The summarization is based on the analysis of... | Tianyang Xu, Shujin Wu, Shizhe Diao, Xiaoze Liu, Xingyao Wang, Yangyi Chen, Jing Gao |  |

As a consequence, language models tend to not generalize well to tokens that are seldom seen during training. Moreover, maximum likelihood training has been discovered to give rise to anisotropy: representations of tokens in a model tend to cluster tightly in a high-dimensional cone, rather than spreading out over their representational capacity.Our work introduces a method for quantifying the frequency bias of a language model by assessing sentence-level perplexity with respect to token-level frequency. We then present a method for reducing the frequency bias of a language model by inducing a syntactic prior over token representations during pre-training. Our Syntactic Smoothing method adjusts the maximum likelihood objective function to distribute the learning signal to syntactically similar tokens. This approach results in better performance on infrequent... | Richard Diehl Martinez, Zébulon Goriely, Andrew Caines, Paula Buttery, Lisa Beinborn |  |

This study examines the limitations of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) in identifying offensive content within systematically perturbed data, with a focus on Chinese, a language particularly susceptible to such perturbations. We introduce ToxiCloakCN, an enhanced dataset derived from ToxiCN, augmented with homophonic substitutions and emoji transformations, to test the robustness of LLMs against these cloaking perturbations. Our findings reveal that existing models significantly underperform in detecting offensive content when these perturbations are applied. We provide an in-depth analysis of how different types of offensive content are affected by these perturbations and explore the alignment between human and model explanations of offensiveness. Our work highlights the urgent need for more advanced techniques in offensive language detection to combat... | Yunze Xiao, Yujia Hu, Kenny T. W. Choo, Roy KaWei Lee |  |

Previous research in the AI community has mainly focused on identifying and generating analogies and then examining their quality under human evaluation, which overlooks the practical application of these analogies in real-world settings. Inspired by the human education process, in this paper, we propose to investigate how analogies created by teacher language models (LMs) can assist student LMs in understanding scientific concepts, thereby aligning more closely with practical scenarios. Our results suggest that free-form analogies can indeed aid LMs in understanding concepts. Additionally, analogies generated by student LMs can improve their own performance on scientific question answering, demonstrating their capability to use analogies for self-learning new knowledge.

Recently, self-citation prompting was proposed to make large language models (LLMs) generate citations to supporting documents along with their answers. However, self-citing LLMs often struggle to match the required format, refer to non-existent sources, and fail to faithfully reflect LLMs’ context usage throughout the generation. In this work, we present MIRAGE – Model Internals-based RAG Explanations – a plug-and-play approach using model internals for faithful answer attribution in RAG applications. MIRAGE detects context-sensitive answer tokens and pairs them with retrieved documents contributing to their prediction via saliency methods.

Nevertheless, the rapid advancement in their deployment trails a comprehensive understanding of their internal mechanisms, as well as a delineation of their capabilities and limitations. A desired characteristic of an intelligent system is its ability to recognize the scope of its own knowledge. To investigate whether LLMs embody this attribute, we develop a benchmark that challenges these models to enumerate all information they possess on specific topics. This benchmark assesses whether the models recall excessive, insufficient, or the precise amount of required information, thereby indicating their awareness of how much they know about the given topic. Our findings reveal that the emergence of this property varies across different architectures and manifests at diverse rates. However, with sufficient scaling, all tested models are ultimately capable of... | Gabriele Prato, Jerry Huang, Prasanna Parthasarathi, Shagun Sodhani, Sarath Chandar |  |

More recent efforts have shown that such rationales can also be used for model distillation: Including CoT sequences (elicited from a large “teacher” model) in addition to target labels when fine-tuning a small student model yields (often substantial) improvements. In this work we ask: Why and how does this additional training signal help in model distillation? We perform ablations to interrogate this, and report some potentially surprising results. Specifically: (1) Placing CoT sequences after labels (rather than before) realizes consistently better downstream performance – this means that no student “reasoning” is necessary at test time to realize gains. (2) When rationales are appended in this way, they need not be coherent reasoning sequences to yield improvements; performance increases are... | Somin Wadhwa, Silvio Amir, Byron C. Wallace |  |

For multi-class classification tasks, prompt-based fine-tuning under low-resource scenarios has resulted in performance levels comparable to those of fully fine-tuning methods. Previous studies have used crafted prompt templates and verbalizers, mapping from the label terms space to the class space, to solve the classification problem as a masked language modeling task. However, cross-domain and fine-grained prompt-based fine-tuning with an automatically enriched verbalizer remains unexplored, mainly due to the difficulty and costs of manually selecting domain label terms for the verbalizer, which requires humans with domain expertise. To address this challenge, we introduce SciPrompt, a framework designed to automatically retrieve scientific topic-related terms for low-resource text classification tasks.

However, they often struggle on compositional visio-linguistic tasks (e.g., attribute-binding or object-relationships) where their performance is no better than random chance. To address this, we introduce SDS-CLIP, a lightweight and sample-efficient distillation method to enhance CLIP’s compositional visio-linguistic reasoning. Our approach fine-tunes CLIP using a distillation objective borrowed from large text-to-image generative models like Stable-Diffusion, which are known for their strong visio-linguistic reasoning abilities. On the challenging Winoground benchmark, SDS-CLIP improves the visio-linguistic performance of various CLIP models by up to 7%, while on the ARO dataset, it boosts performance by up to 3%. This work underscores the potential of well-designed distillation objectives from generative models to enhance contrastive image-text... | Samyadeep Basu, Shell Xu Hu, Maziar Sanjabi, Daniela Massiceti, Soheil Feizi |  |

Past work has primarily treated entity linking as a standard supervised learning problem. However, supervised entity matching models often do not generalize well to new data, and collecting exhaustive labeled training data is often cost prohibitive. Further, recent efforts have adopted LLMs for this task in few/zero-shot settings, exploiting their general knowledge. But LLMs are prohibitively expensive for performing inference at scale for real-world entity matching tasks.As an efficient alternative, we re-cast entity matching as a conditional generation task as opposed to binary classification. This enables us to “distill” LLM reasoning into smaller entity matching models via natural language explanations. This approach achieves strong performance, especially on out-of-domain generalization tests (10.85% F-1) where standalone generative methods struggle. We perform... | Somin Wadhwa, Adit Krishnan, Runhui Wang, Byron C. Wallace, Luyang Kong |  |

Characterizing Query-Knowledge Relevance For Reliable Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.353) |  | 0 | Language models (LMs) are known to suffer from hallucinations and misinformation. Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) that retrieves verifiable information from an external knowledge corpus to complement the parametric knowledge in LMs provides a tangible solution to these problems. However, the generation quality of RAG is highly dependent on the relevance between a user’s query and the retrieved documents. Inaccurate responses may be generated when the query is outside of the scope of knowledge represented in the external knowledge corpus or if the information in the corpus is out-of-date. In this work, we establish a statistical framework that assesses how well a query can be answered by an RAG system by capturing the relevance of knowledge. We introduce an online testing procedure that employs goodness-of-fit (GoF) tests to inspect the relevance of each user query to detect out-of-knowledge queries with low knowledge relevance. Additionally, we develop an offline testing... | Zhuohang Li, Jiaxin Zhang, Chao Yan, Kamalika Das, Kumar Sricharan, Murat Kantarcioglu, Bradley A. Malin |  |

The administration of personality tests to LLMs has emerged as a noteworthy area in this context. However, the suitability of employing psychological scales, initially devised for humans, on LLMs is a matter of ongoing debate. Our study aims to determine the reliability of applying personality assessments to LLMs, explicitly investigating whether LLMs demonstrate consistent personality traits. Analysis of 2,500 settings per model, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini-Pro, and LLaMA-3.1, reveals that various LLMs show consistency in responses to the Big Five Inventory, indicating a satisfactory level of reliability. Furthermore, our research explores the potential of GPT-3.5 to emulate diverse personalities and represent various groups—a capability increasingly sought after in social sciences... | Jentse Huang, Wenxiang Jiao, Man Ho Lam, Eric John Li, Wenxuan Wang, Michael R.

Despite increasing digitization, these documents typically lack unique cross-document identifiers for individuals mentioned within the texts, as well as individual identifiers from external knowledge bases like Wikipedia/Wikidata. Existing entity disambiguation methods often fall short in accuracy for historical documents, which are replete with individuals not remembered in contemporary knowledge bases. This study makes three key contributions to improve cross-document coreference resolution and disambiguation in historical texts: a massive-scale training dataset replete with hard negatives - that sources over 190 million entity pairs from Wikipedia contexts and disambiguation pages - high-quality evaluation data from hand-labeled historical newswire articles, and trained models evaluated on this historical benchmark.

While such capability is largely attributed to the rich world knowledge contained within the Large Language Models (LLMs), our work reveals their shortcomings in fine-grained visual categorization (FGVC) across six different benchmark settings. Most recent state-of-the-art LVLMs such as LLaVa-1.5, InstructBLIP and GPT-4V not only severely deteriorate in terms of classification performance, e.g., average drop of 65.58 in EM for Stanford Dogs for LLaVA-1.5, but also struggle to generate descriptive visual attributes based on a concept that appears within an input image despite their prominent zero-shot image captioning ability. In-depth analyses show that instruction-tuned LVLMs suffer from modality gap, showing discrepancy when given textual and visual inputs that correspond to the same concept.

Simplifying the entire text makes it understandable but sometimes removes important details. On the contrary, helping adult readers understand difficult concepts in context can enhance their vocabulary and knowledge. In a preliminary human study, we first identify that lack of context and unfamiliarity with difficult concepts is a major reason for adult readers’ difficulty with domain-specific text. We then introduce targeted concept simplification, a simplification task for rewriting text to help readers comprehend text containing unfamiliar concepts. We also introduce WikiDomains, a new dataset of 22k definitions from 13 academic domains paired with a difficult concept within each definition. We benchmark the performance of open-source and commercial LLMs and a simple dictionary baseline on this task across human judgments of ease of understanding... | Sumit Asthana, Hannah Rashkin, Elizabeth Clark, Fantine Huot, Mirella Lapata |  |

However, the creation of such data with human supervision proves costly and time-intensive. In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of AI feedback to scale supervision for aligning LVLMs. We introduce VLFeedback, the first large-scale vision-language feedback dataset, comprising over 82K multi-modal instructions and comprehensive rationales generated by off-the-shelf models without human annotations. To evaluate the effectiveness of AI feedback for vision-language alignment, we train Silkie, an LVLM fine-tuned via direct preference optimization on VLFeedback. Silkie showcases exceptional performance regarding helpfulness, visual faithfulness, and safety metrics. It outperforms its base model by 6.9% and 9.5% in perception and cognition tasks, reduces hallucination issues on MMHal-Bench, and exhibits enhanced resilience against... | Lei Li, Zhihui Xie, Mukai Li, Shunian Chen, Peiyi Wang, Liang Chen, Yazheng Yang, Benyou Wang, Lingpeng Kong, Qi Liu |  |

With the increase in available context length of LLMs, recent experiments have shown that the performance of ICL does not necessarily scale well in many-shot (demonstration) settings. We hypothesize that the reason lies in more demonstrations dispersing the model attention from the query, hindering its understanding of key content, which we validate both theoretically and experimentally. Inspired by how humans learn from examples, we propose a training-free method FocusICL, which conducts triviality filtering to avoid attention being diverted by unimportant contents at token-level and operates hierarchical attention to further ensure sufficient attention towards current query at demonstration-level. We also design an efficient hyperparameter searching strategy for FocusICL based on model perplexity of demonstrations.

In this work, we explore the limitations of this task framing. First, we survey a number of linguistic phenomena in sign languages that depend on discourse-level context. Then as a case study, we perform the first human baseline for sign language translation that actually substitutes a human into the machine learning task framing, rather than provide the human with the entire document as context. This human baseline—for ASL to English translation on the How2Sign dataset—shows that for 33% of sentences in our sample, our fluent Deaf signer annotators were only able to understand key parts of the clip in light of additional discourse-level context. These results underscore the importance of understanding and sanity checking examples when adapting machine learning to new domains. | Garrett Tanzer, Maximus Shengelia, Ken Harrenstien, David Uthus |  |

In this paper, we propose GAMA, a novel General-purpose Large Audio-Language Model (LALM) with Advanced Audio Understanding and Complex Reasoning Abilities. We build GAMA by integrating an LLM with multiple types of audio representations, including features from a custom Audio Q-Former, a multi-layer aggregator that aggregates features from multiple layers of an audio encoder. We fine-tune GAMA on a large-scale audio-language dataset, which augments it with audio understanding capabilities. Next, we propose CompA-R (Instruction-Tuning for Complex Audio Reasoning), a synthetically generated instruction-tuning (IT) dataset with instructions that require the model to perform complex reasoning on the input audio. We instruction-tune GAMA with CompA-R to endow it with complex reasoning abilities, where we further add a soft prompt as input with... | Sreyan Ghosh, Sonal Kumar, Ashish Seth, Chandra Kiran Reddy Evuru, Utkarsh Tyagi, S.

We propose a strong benchmark for the automatic reconstruction of protowords for Romance languages, by applying a set of machine learning models and features on these data. The best results reach 90% accuracy in predicting the protoword of a given cognate set, surpassing existing state-of-the-art results for this task and showing that computational methods can be very useful in assisting linguists with protoword reconstruction. | Liviu P.

This paper studies how contextual information about the user influences the likelihood of an LLM to refuse to execute a request. By generating user biographies that offer ideological and demographic information, we find a number of biases in guardrail sensitivity on GPT-3.5. Younger, female, and Asian-American personas are more likely to trigger a refusal guardrail when requesting censored or illegal information. Guardrails are also sycophantic, refusing to comply with requests for a political position the user is likely to disagree with. We find that certain identity groups and seemingly innocuous information, e.g., sports fandom, can elicit changes in guardrail sensitivity similar to direct statements of political ideology. For each demographic category and even for American football team fandom, we find that ChatGPT appears to infer a likely political... | Victoria R. Li, Yida Chen, Naomi Saphra |  |

While unintuitive from a classic view of LMs, recent work has shown that the truth value of a statement can be elicited from the model’s representations. This paper presents an explanation for why LMs appear to know the truth despite not being trained with truth labels. We hypothesize that the pretraining data is generated by groups of (un)truthful agents whose outputs share common features, and they form a (un)truthful persona. By training on this data, LMs can infer and represent the persona in its activation space. This allows the model to separate truth from falsehoods and controls the truthfulness of its generation. We show evidence for the persona hypothesis via two observations: (1) we can probe whether a model’s answer will be truthful before it is generated; (2) finetuning a model on a set of facts improves its... | Nitish Joshi, Javier Rando, Abulhair Saparov, Najoung Kim, He He |  |

However, not all information can be retrieved from text. We propose an approach that uses the analysis of structured data to generate fact sets that are used to guide generation in much the same way that retrieved documents are used in RAG. This analytics augmented generation (AAG) approach supports the ability to utilize standard analytic techniques to generate facts that are then converted to text and passed to an LLM. We present a neurosymbolic platform, Satyrn, that leverages AAG to produce accurate, fluent, and coherent reports grounded in large scale databases. In our experiments, we find that Satyrn generates reports in which over 86% of claims are accurate while maintaining high levels of fluency and coherence, even when using smaller language models such as Mistral-7B, as compared... | Marko Sterbentz, Cameron Barrie, Shubham Shahi, Abhratanu Dutta, Donna Hooshmand, Harper Pack, Kristian J.

In contrast to the prior methods that use random masking schemes for Masked Acoustic Modeling (MAM), we introduce a novel selective and adaptive masking strategy. Specifically, during SSL training, we progressively introduce harder regions to the model for reconstruction. Our approach automatically selects hard regions and is built on the observation that the reconstruction loss of individual frames in MAM can provide natural signals to judge the difficulty of solving the MAM pre-text task for that frame. To identify these hard regions, we employ a teacher model that first predicts the frame-wise losses and then decides which frames to mask. By learning to create challenging problems, such as identifying harder frames and solving them simultaneously, the model is able to learn more effective representations and thereby acquire... | Ashish Seth, Ramaneswaran Selvakumar, S.

In this paper, we propose a hierarchical framework that decomposes complex tasks into manageable subgoals, utilizing separate LLMs for subgoal prediction and low-level action generation. To address the challenge of creating training signals for unannotated datasets, we develop a reward model that leverages multimodal environment feedback to automatically generate reward signals. We introduce Environment Preference Optimization (EPO), a novel method that generates preference signals from the environment’s feedback and uses them to train LLM-based agents. Extensive experiments on ALFRED demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our framework, achieving first place on the ALFRED public leaderboard and showcasing its potential to improve long-horizon decision-making in diverse environments. | Qi Zhao, Haotian Fu, Chen Sun, George Konidaris |  |

Here we propose a method for evaluating diversity over syntactic features to characterize general repetition in models, beyond frequent n-grams. Specifically, we define syntactic templates (e.g., strings comprising parts-of-speech) and show that models tend to produce templated text in downstream tasks at a higher rate than what is found in human-reference textsWe find that most (76%) templates in model-generated text can be found in pre-training data (compared to only 35% of human-authored text), and are not overwritten during fine-tuning or alignment processes such as RLHF. The connection between templates in generated text and the pre-training data allows us to analyze syntactic templates in models where we do not have the pre-training data.We also find that templates as features are able to differentiate between models, tasks, and... | Chantal Shaib, Yanai Elazar, Junyi Jessy Li, Byron C.

However, their ability to handle rare objects, which fall into the long tail of data distributions, is less understood. To rigorously evaluate this aspect, we introduce the “Uncontextualized Uncommon Objects” (UOUO) benchmark. This benchmark focuses on systematically testing VLMs with both large and small parameter counts on rare and specialized objects. Our comprehensive analysis reveals that while smaller VLMs maintain competitive performance on common datasets, they significantly underperform on tasks involving uncommon objects. We also propose an advanced, scalable pipeline for data collection and cleaning, ensuring the UOUO benchmark provides high-quality, challenging instances.

We notice that substantial portions of the intermediate matrices necessary for speculative sampling can be computed concurrently. This allows us to distribute the workload across multiple GPU threads, enabling simultaneous operations on matrix segments within thread blocks. This results in profiling time improvements ranging from 6% to 13% relative to the baseline implementation, without compromising accuracy. To further accelerate speculative sampling, probability distributions parameterized by softmax are approximated by sigmoid. This approximation approach results in significantly greater relative improvements in profiling time, ranging from 37% to 94%, with a minor decline in accuracy. We conduct extensive experiments on both automatic speech recognition and summarization tasks to validate the effectiveness of our optimization methods. | Dominik Wagner, Seanie Lee, Ilja Baumann, Philipp Seeberger, Korbinian Riedhammer, Tobias Bocklet |  |

While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods excel in performance and generalization, they are costly and limit communal benefits when used individually. To this end, we introduce Personalized Pieces (Per-Pcs), a framework that allows users to safely share and assemble personalized PEFT efficiently with collaborative efforts. Per-Pcs involves selecting sharers, breaking their PEFT into pieces, and training gates for each piece. These pieces are added to a pool, from which target users can select and assemble personalized PEFT using their history data. This approach preserves privacy and enables fine-grained user modeling without excessive storage and computation demands. Experimental results show Per-Pcs outperforms non-personalized and PEFT retrieval baselines, offering performance comparable to OPPU with significantly lower resource use across... | Zhaoxuan Tan, Zheyuan Liu, Meng Jiang |  |

Recent advances have highlighted effective prompt design by enriching user queries with non-parametric knowledge through behavior history retrieval and textual profiles. However, these methods faced limitations due to a lack of model ownership, resulting in constrained customization and privacy issues, and often failed to capture complex, dynamic user behavior patterns. To address these shortcomings, we introduce One PEFT Per User (OPPU), employing personalized parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) modules to store user-specific behavior patterns and preferences. By plugging in personal PEFT parameters, users can own and use their LLMs individually. OPPU integrates parametric user knowledge in the personal PEFT parameters with non-parametric knowledge from retrieval and profiles, adapting LLMs to user... | Zhaoxuan Tan, Qingkai Zeng, Yijun Tian, Zheyuan Liu, Bing Yin, Meng Jiang |  |

Traditional retrieval pipelines require tailored document parsing techniques and content extraction modules to prepare input for indexing. This process is tedious, prone to errors, and has information loss. To this end, we propose Document Screenshot Embedding (DSE), a novel retrieval paradigm that regards document screenshots as a unified input format, which does not require any content extraction preprocess and preserves all the information in a document (e.g., text, image and layout). DSE leverages a large vision-language model to directly encode document screenshots into dense representations for retrieval. To evaluate our method, we first craft the dataset of Wiki-SS, a 1.3M Wikipedia web page screenshots as the corpus to answer the questions from the Natural Questions dataset. In such a text-intensive document retrieval setting, DSE shows competitive effectiveness compared to other text... | Xueguang Ma, ShengChieh Lin, Minghan Li, Wenhu Chen, Jimmy Lin |  |

Language-specific modeling methods show promise in reducing interference. However, they often rely on heuristics to distribute capacity and struggle to foster cross-lingual transfer via isolated modules. In this paper, we explore intrinsic task modularity within multilingual networks and leverage these observations to circumvent interference under multilingual translation. We show that neurons in the feed-forward layers tend to be activated in a language-specific manner. Meanwhile, these specialized neurons exhibit structural overlaps that reflect language proximity, which progress across layers. Based on these findings, we propose Neuron Specialization, an approach that identifies specialized neurons to modularize feed-forward layers and then continuously updates them through sparse networks. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves consistent performance... | Shaomu Tan, Di Wu, Christof Monz |  |

Through the examination of the literature, we identify a lack of agreement with the term ‘hallucination’ in the field of NLP. Additionally, to compliment our audit, we conduct a survey with 171 practitioners from the field of NLP and AI to capture varying perspectives on hallucination. Our analysis calls for the necessity of explicit definitions and frameworks outlining hallucination within NLP, highlighting potential challenges, and our survey inputs provide a thematic understanding of the influence and ramifications of hallucination in society. | Pranav Narayanan Venkit, Tatiana Chakravorti, Vipul Gupta, Heidi Biggs, Mukund Srinath, Koustava Goswami, Sarah Rajtmajer, Shomir Wilson |  |

However, localizing these representations and disentangling them from each other remains an open problem. In this work, we investigate whether pretrained language models contain various \*knowledge-critical\* subnetworks: particular sparse computational subgraphs that can, if removed, precisely suppress specific knowledge the model has memorized. We propose a multi-objective differentiable masking scheme that can be applied to both weights and neurons to discover such subnetworks and show that we can use them to precisely remove specific knowledge from models while minimizing adverse effects on the behavior of the original model. We demonstrate our method on multiple GPT2 variants, uncovering highly sparse subnetworks (98%+ sparsity) that are critical for expressing specific collections of relational knowledge.

Comprehensively Investigating Privacy Leakage Risks in Conversations with GPT Models](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.377) |  | 0 | Significant advancements have recently been made in large language models, represented by GPT models.Users frequently have multi-round private conversations with cloud-hosted GPT models for task optimization.Yet, this operational paradigm introduces additional attack surfaces, particularly in custom GPTs and hijacked chat sessions.In this paper, we introduce a straightforward yet potent Conversation Reconstruction Attack.This attack targets the contents of previous conversations between GPT models and benign users, i.e., the benign users’ input contents during their interaction with GPT models.The adversary could induce GPT models to leak such contents by querying them with designed malicious prompts.Our comprehensive examination of privacy risks during the interactions with GPT models under this attack reveals GPT-4’s considerable resilience.We present two advanced attacks targeting improved reconstruction of past conversations, demonstrating significant privacy leakage across all... | Junjie Chu, Zeyang Sha, Michael Backes, Yang Zhang |  |

With the recent advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their remarkable reasoning abilities, there is a growing trend to leverage them for KGQA. However, existing methodologies have only focused on answering factual questions, e.g., \*“In which city was Silvio Berlusconi’s first wife born?”\*, leaving questions involving commonsense reasoning that real-world users may pose more often, e.g., \*“Do I need separate visas to see the Venus of Willendorf and attend the Olympics this summer?”\* unaddressed. In this work, we first observe that existing LLM-based methods for KGQA struggle with hallucination on such questions, especially on queries targeting long-tail entities (e.g., non-mainstream and recent entities), thus hindering their applicability in real-world applications especially since their reasoning processes are... | Armin Toroghi, Willis Guo, Mohammad Mahdi Abdollah Pour, Scott Sanner |  |

Despite their potential, LLMs are susceptible to reasoning errors and hallucinations that may be harmful in use cases where accurate reasoning is critical. This challenge underscores the need for verifiable, debuggable, and repairable LLM reasoning. Recent works have made progress toward verifiable reasoning with LLMs by using them as either (i) a reasoner over an axiomatic knowledge base, or (ii) a semantic parser for use in existing logical inference systems. However, both settings are unable to extract commonsense axioms from the LLM that are not already formalized in the knowledge base, and also lack a reliable method to repair missed commonsense inferences. In this work, we present LLM-TRes, a logical reasoning framework based on the notion of “theory resolution” that allows for seamless integration of the commonsense knowledge from LLMs with a... | Armin Toroghi, Willis Guo, Ali Pesaranghader, Scott Sanner |  |

We create the Language Confusion Benchmark (LCB) to evaluate such failures, covering 15 typologically diverse languages with existing and newly-created English and multilingual prompts. We evaluate a range of LLMs on monolingual and cross-lingual generation reflecting practical use cases, finding that Llama Instruct and Mistral models exhibit high degrees of language confusion and even the strongest models fail to consistently respond in the correct language. We observe that base and English-centric instruct models are more prone to language confusion, which is aggravated by complex prompts and high sampling temperatures. We find that language confusion can be partially mitigated via few-shot prompting, multilingual SFT and preference tuning. We release our language confusion benchmark, which serves as a first layer of efficient, scalable multilingual evaluation. | Kelly Marchisio, WeiYin Ko, Alexandre Berard, Théo Dehaze, Sebastian Ruder |  |

By contrast, systems such as causal models, that learn abstract variables and causal relationships, can demonstrate increased robustness against changes in the distribution. One reason for this success is the existence and use of Independent Causal Mechanisms (ICMs) representing high-level concepts that only sparsely interact. In this work, we apply two concepts from causality to learn ICMs within LLMs. We develop a new LLM architecture composed of multiple sparsely interacting language modelling modules. We show that such causal constraints can improve out-of-distribution performance on abstract and causal reasoning tasks. We also investigate the level of independence and domain specialisation and show that LLMs rely on pre-trained partially... | Gaël Gendron, Bao Trung Nguyen, Alex Yuxuan Peng, Michael J.

We present MirrorStories, a corpus of 1,500 personalized short stories generated by integrating elements such as name, gender, age, ethnicity, reader interest, and story moral. We demonstrate that LLMs can effectively incorporate diverse identity elements into narratives, with human evaluators identifying personalized elements in the stories with high accuracy. Through a comprehensive evaluation involving 26 diverse human judges, we compare the effectiveness of MirrorStories against generic narratives. We find that personalized LLM-generated stories not only outscore generic human-written and LLM-generated ones across all metrics of engagement (with average ratings of 4.22 versus 3.37 on a 5-point scale), but also achieve higher textual diversity while... | Sarfaroz Yunusov, Hamza Sidat, Ali Emami |  |

However, most studies focus on simplistic and static self-report or performance-based tests, which limits the depth and validity of the analysis. In this paper, we developed a novel framework, InterIntent, to assess LLMs’ social intelligence by mapping their ability to understand and manage intentions in a game setting. We focus on four dimensions of social intelligence: situational awareness, self-regulation, self-awareness, and theory of mind. Each dimension is linked to a specific game task: intention selection, intention following, intention summarization, and intention guessing. Our findings indicate that while LLMs exhibit high proficiency in selecting intentions, achieving an accuracy of 88%, their ability to infer the intentions of others is significantly weaker, trailing human performance by 20%. Additionally, game performance correlates with intention understanding, highlighting... | Ziyi Liu, Abhishek Anand, Pei Zhou, Jentse Huang, Jieyu Zhao |  |

These studies often rely on coarse corpus-level statistics or local word-level analyses, mainly in English. We introduce the InfoGap method—an efficient and reliable approach to locating information gaps and inconsistencies in articles at the fact level, across languages. We evaluate InfoGap by analyzing LGBT people’s portrayals, across 2.7K biography pages on English, Russian, and French Wikipedias. We find large discrepancies in factual coverage across the languages. Moreover, our analysis reveals that biographical facts carrying negative connotations are more likely to be highlighted in Russian Wikipedia. Crucially, InfoGap both facilitates large scale analyses, and pinpoints local document- and fact-level information gaps, laying a new foundation for targeted and nuanced comparative language analysis at scale. | Farhan Samir, Chan Young Park, Anjalie Field, Vered Shwartz, Yulia Tsvetkov |  |

Various benchmarks have been proposed to test models’ cultural inclusivity. Still, they have limited coverage of cultures and do not adequately assess cultural diversity across universal and culture-specific local concepts. To address these limitations, we introduce the GlobalRG benchmark, comprising two challenging tasks: retrieval across universals and cultural visual grounding. The former task entails retrieving culturally diverse images for universal concepts from 50 countries, while the latter aims at grounding culture-specific concepts within images from 15 countries. Our evaluation across a wide range of models reveals that the performance varies significantly across cultures – underscoring the necessity for enhancing multicultural understanding in vision-language models. | Mehar Bhatia, Sahithya Ravi, Aditya Chinchure, Eunjeong Hwang, Vered Shwartz |  |

An open question is how language models can be explicitly controlled so that they weave together target styles when generating text: for example, to produce text that is both negative and non-toxic. One approach to such controlled generation is multi-objective reinforcement learning (RL), but how to best combine multiple objectives in a reward function is an open question. In this paper, we investigate various formulations of multi-style reward formulations, including calibrated outputs from discriminators and dynamic weighting by discriminator gradient magnitudes. We find that our proposed dynamic weighting outperforms static weighting approaches with respect style control while maintaining linguistic quality, and we explore its effectiveness in 2- and 3-style control. | Karin de Langis, Ryan Koo, Dongyeop Kang |  |

However, its internal mechanisms have yet to be explored. Inspired by multilingual research, we identify domain-specific neurons in multimodal large language models. Specifically, we investigate the distribution of domain-specific neurons and the mechanism of how MLLMs process features from diverse domains. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage framework for language model modules in MLLMs when handling projected image features, and verify this hypothesis using logit lens. Extensive experiments indicate that while current MLLMs exhibit Visual Question Answering (VQA) capability, they may not fully utilize domain-specific information. Manipulating domain-specific neurons properly will result in a 10% change of accuracy at most, shedding light on the development of cross-domain, all-encompassing MLLMs in the future.

Prior works typically represent information extraction as triplet-centric and use classical metrics such as precision and recall for evaluation. We reformulate the task to be entity-centric, enabling the use of diverse metrics that can provide more insights from various perspectives. We contribute to the field by introducing Structured Entity Extraction and proposing the Approximate Entity Set OverlaP (AESOP) metric, designed to appropriately assess model performance. Later, we introduce a new Multistage Structured Entity Extraction (MuSEE) model that harnesses the power of LMs for enhanced effectiveness and efficiency by decomposing the extraction task into multiple stages. Quantitative and human side-by-side evaluations confirm that our model outperforms baselines, offering... | Haolun Wu, Ye Yuan, Liana Mikaelyan, Alexander Meulemans, Xue Liu, James Hensman, Bhaskar Mitra |  |

However, when using pairwise comparisons to rank a set of candidates, the computational cost scales quadratically with the number of candidates, which has practical limitations. This paper introduces a Product of Expert (PoE) framework for efficient LLM Comparative Assessment. Here individual comparisons are considered experts that provide information on a pair’s score difference. The PoE framework combines the information from these experts to yield an expression that can be maximized with respect to the underlying set of candidates, and is highly flexible where any form of expert can be assumed. When Gaussian experts are used one can derive simple closed-form solutions for the optimal candidate ranking, as well as expressions for selecting which comparisons should be made to maximize the probability of this ranking. Our approach enables efficient comparative assessment, where by using... | Adian Liusie, Vatsal Raina, Yassir Fathullah, Mark J. F. Gales |  |

Still, the engineering applications of AMR are not fully understood. In this survey, we categorize and characterize more than 100 papers which use AMR for downstream tasks— the first survey of this kind for AMR. Specifically, we highlight (1) the range of applications for which AMR has been harnessed, and (2) the techniques for incorporating AMR into those applications. We also detect broader AMR engineering patterns and outline areas of future work that seem ripe for AMR incorporation. We hope that this survey will be useful to those interested in using AMR and that it sparks discussion on the role of symbolic representations in the age of neural-focused NLP research. | Shira Wein, Juri Opitz |  |

Despite the success of CLIP-type visual embeddings, they often lack access to world knowledge critical for visual reasoning. In this work, we propose Visual Table, a novel form of visual representation tailored for visual reasoning. Visual tables are constructed as hierarchical descriptions of visual scenes, featuring a scene description and multiple object-centric descriptions covering categories, attributes, and knowledge. Thanks to the structural and textual formats, visual tables offer unique properties over mere visual embeddings, such as explainability and controllable editing. Furthermore, they deliver instance-level world knowledge and detailed attributes that are essential for visual reasoning. To create visual tables, we develop a generator trained on the dataset with collected, small-scale... | Yiwu Zhong, ZiYuan Hu, Michael R. Lyu, Liwei Wang |  |

We introduce a large dataset of 4,037 caregiver strategies in this setting, a five-fold increase over the nearest contemporary dataset. These strategies are manually categorized into clinically established constructs with high agreement (𝜅=0.68-0.89). We also propose two techniques to further address identified data constraints. First, we manually supplement target task data with publicly relevant data from online child health forums. Next, we propose a novel data augmentation technique to generate synthetic caregiver strategies with high downstream task utility. Extensive experiments showcase the quality of our dataset. They also establish evidence that both the publicly available data and the synthetic strategies result in large performance gains, with relative F1... | Shahla Farzana, Ivana Lucero, Vivian Villegas, Vera C.

To address this dilemma, we introduce TaylorMLP to protect the ownership of released LLMs and prevent their abuse. Specifically, TaylorMLP preserves the ownership of LLMs by transforming the weights of LLMs into parameters of Taylor-series. Instead of releasing the original weights, developers can release the Taylor-series parameters with users, thereby ensuring the security of LLMs. Moreover, TaylorMLP can prevent abuse of LLMs by adjusting the generation speed. It can induce low-speed token generation for the protected LLMs by increasing the terms in the Taylor-series. This intentional delay helps LLM developers prevent potential large-scale unauthorized uses of their models. Empirical experiments across five datasets and three LLM architectures demonstrate that TaylorMLP induces over increase in... | Guanchu Wang, YuNeng Chuang, Ruixiang Tang, Shaochen Zhong, Jiayi Yuan, Hongye Jin, Zirui Liu, Vipin Chaudhary, Shuai Xu, James Caverlee, Xia Ben Hu |  |

Previous works employ pre-trained TKG embeddings or graph neural networks to incorporate the knowledge of TKGs. However, these methods fail to fully understand the complex semantic information of time constraints in questions.In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown exceptional performance in knowledge graph reasoning, unifying both semantic understanding and structural reasoning. To further enhance LLMs’ temporal reasoning ability, this paper aims to integrate relevant temporal knowledge from TKGs into LLMs through a Time-aware Retrieve-Rewrite-Retrieve-Rerank framework, which we named TimeR4.Specifically, to reduce temporal hallucination in LLMs, we propose a retrieve-rewrite module to rewrite questions using background knowledge stored in the TKGs, thereby acquiring explicit time constraints. Then, we implement a retrieve-rerank... | Xinying Qian, Ying Zhang, Yu Zhao, Baohang Zhou, Xuhui Sui, Li Zhang, Kehui Song |  |

This paper presents RefChecker, a framework that introduces claim-triplets to represent claims in LLM responses, aiming to detect fine-grained hallucinations. In RefChecker, an extractor generates claim-triplets from a response, which are then evaluated by a checker against a reference. We delineate three task settings: Zero, Noisy and Accurate Context, to reflect various real-world use cases. We curated a benchmark spanning various NLP tasks and annotated 11k claim-triplets from 2.1k responses by seven LLMs. RefChecker supports both proprietary and open-source models as the extractor and checker. Experiments demonstrate that claim-triplets enable superior hallucination detection, compared to other granularities such as response, sentence and sub-sentence level claims. RefChecker outperforms prior methods by 18.2 to 27.2 points on our benchmark and the checking results of... | Xiangkun Hu, Dongyu Ru, Lin Qiu, Qipeng Guo, Tianhang Zhang, Yang Xu, Yun Luo, Pengfei Liu, Yue Zhang, Zheng Zhang |  |

Given that multiple languages are a compensation for the losses caused by a single language’s limitations, it’s a natural next step to enrich the model’s learning context through the integration of the original input with its multiple translations. In this paper, we start by revealing that LLMs learn from parallel multilingual input (PMI). Our comprehensive evaluation shows that PMI enhances the model’s comprehension of the input, achieving superior performance than conventional in-context learning (ICL). Furthermore, to explore how multilingual processing affects prediction, we examine the activated neurons in LLMs. Surprisingly, involving more languages in the input activates fewer neurons, leading to more focused and... | Yongyu Mu, Peinan Feng, Zhiquan Cao, Yuzhang Wu, Bei Li, Chenglong Wang, Tong Xiao, Kai Song, Tongran Liu, Chunliang Zhang, JingBo Zhu |  |

However, designing effective evolving methods for instruction evolution requires substantial human expertise. This paper proposes Auto Evol-Instruct, an end-to-end framework that evolves instruction datasets using large language models without any human effort. The framework automatically analyzes and summarizes suitable evolutionary strategies for the given instruction data and iteratively improves the evolving method based on issues exposed during the instruction evolution process. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the best method optimized by Auto Evol-Instruct outperforms human-designed methods on various benchmarks, including MT-Bench, AlpacaEval, GSM8K, and HumanEval. | Weihao Zeng, Can Xu, Yingxiu Zhao, JianGuang Lou, Weizhu Chen |  |

Traditional metrics for automatic text evaluation are often tailored to specific scenarios, while LLM-based evaluation metrics are costly, requiring fine-tuning or rely heavily on the generation capabilities of LLMs. Besides, previous LLM-based metrics ignore the fact that, within the space of LLM representations, there exist direction vectors that indicate the estimation of text quality. To this end, we introduce RepEval, a metric that leverages the projection of LLM representations for evaluation. Through simple prompt modifications, RepEval can easily transition to various tasks, requiring only minimal sample pairs for direction vector construction. Results on fourteen datasets across two evaluation tasks demonstrate the high effectiveness of our method, which exhibits a higher... | Shuqian Sheng, Yi Xu, Tianhang Zhang, Zanwei Shen, Luoyi Fu, Jiaxin Ding, Lei Zhou, Xiaoying Gan, Xinbing Wang, Chenghu Zhou |  |

However, these rules are conventionally constructed by medical experts, which is expensive and hard to scale up. In this study, we explore the automatic extraction of medical decision rules from text, leading to a solution to construct large-scale medical decision rules. We adopt a formulation of medical decision rules as binary trees consisting of condition/decision nodes. Such trees are referred to as medical decision trees and we introduce several generative models to extract them from text. The proposed models inherit the merit of two categories of successful natural language generation frameworks, i.e., sequence-to-sequence generation and autoregressive generation. To unleash the potential of pretrained language models, we design three styles of linearization (natural language, augmented natural language and JSON code), acting as the target sequence for our models. Our final system achieves... | Yuxin He, Buzhou Tang, Xiaoling Wang |  |

Previous methods adaptively select frames and regions from long videos to save computations. However, this fails to reason over the whole sequence of video, leading to sub-optimal performance. To address this problem, we introduce a state space layer (SSL) into multi-modal Transformer to efficiently integrate global semantics of the video, which mitigates the video information loss caused by frame and region selection modules. Our SSL includes a gating unit to enable controllability over the flow of global semantics into visual representations. To further enhance the controllability, we introduce a cross-modal compositional congruence objective to encourage global semantics aligned with the question. To rigorously evaluate long-form videoQA capacity, we construct two new benchmarks Ego-QA and MAD-QA featuring videos of considerably long length, i.e. 17.5 minutes and 1.9 hours,... | Thong Nguyen, Zhiyuan Hu, Xiaobao Wu, CongDuy Nguyen, SeeKiong Ng, Anh Tuan Luu |  |

Although there are diverse jailbreak attack strategies, there is no unified understanding on why some methods succeed and others fail. This paper explores the behavior of harmful and harmless prompts in the LLM’s representation space to investigate the intrinsic properties of successful jailbreak attacks. We hypothesize that successful attacks share some similar properties: They are effective in moving the representation of the harmful prompt towards the direction to the harmless prompts. We leverage hidden representations into the objective of existing jailbreak attacks to move the attacks along the acceptance direction, and conduct experiments to validate the above hypothesis using the proposed objective. We hope this study provides new insights into understanding how LLMs understand harmfulness information. | Yuping Lin, Pengfei He, Han Xu, Yue Xing, Makoto Yamada, Hui Liu, Jiliang Tang |  |

This task is crucial for promoting consistent judgments in similar cases, effectively enhancing judicial fairness and improving work efficiency for judges. However, existing works face two main challenges for real-world applications: existing works mainly focus on case-to-case retrieval using lengthy queries, which does not match real-world scenarios; and the limited data scale, with current datasets containing only hundreds of queries, is insufficient to satisfy the training requirements of existing data-hungry neural models. To address these issues, we introduce an automated method to construct synthetic query-candidate pairs and build the largest LCR dataset to date, LEAD, which is hundreds of times larger than existing datasets. This data construction method can provide ample training signals for LCR models. Experimental results demonstrate that model training with our constructed... | Cheng Gao, Chaojun Xiao, Zhenghao Liu, Huimin Chen, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun |  |

However, there are significant differences in the knowledge and abilities required for different tasks. Therefore, it is important to understand whether the same LLM processes different tasks in the same way. Are there specific neurons in a LLM for different tasks? Inspired by neuroscience, this paper pioneers the exploration of whether distinct neurons are activated when a LLM handles different tasks. Compared with current research exploring the neurons of language and knowledge, task-specific neurons present a greater challenge due to their abstractness, diversity, and complexity. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a method for task-specific neuron localization based on Causal Gradient Variation with Special Tokens (CGVST).

Stabilizing online Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) under these conditions remains an open and unexplored question. Existing wild vision TTA methods often fail to handle speech data effectively due to the unique characteristics of high-entropy speech frames, which are unreliably filtered out even when containing crucial semantic content. Furthermore, unlike static vision data, speech signals follow short-term consistency, requiring specialized adaptation strategies. In this work, we propose a novel wild acoustic TTA method tailored for ASR fine-tuned acoustic foundation models. Our method, Confidence-Enhanced Adaptation, performs frame-level adaptation using a confidence-aware weight scheme to avoid filtering out essential information in high-entropy frames. Additionally, we apply consistency regularization... | Hongfu Liu, Hengguan Huang, Ye Wang |  |

Finding an optimal portfolio of retrieved items is a combinatorial optimization problem, generally considered NP-hard. This approach provides a learned approximation to such a solution, meeting specific task requirements under a given family of large language models (LLMs). We propose a training procedure based on reinforcement learning, incorporating feedback from LLMs. We instantiate an iterative retriever for composing in-context learning (ICL) exemplars and apply it to various semantic parsing tasks that demand synthesized programs as outputs. By adding only 4M additional parameters for state encoding, we convert an off-the-shelf dense retriever into a stateful iterative retriever, outperforming previous methods in selecting ICL exemplars on semantic parsing datasets such as CalFlow, TreeDST, and MTOP.

While dense retrieval has advanced various ad-hoc searches, it often struggles to match the underlying academic concepts between queries and documents, which is critical for paper search. To enable effective academic concept matching for paper search, we propose Taxonomy-guided Semantic Indexing (TaxoIndex) framework. TaxoIndex extracts key concepts from papers and organizes them as a semantic index guided by an academic taxonomy, and then leverages this index as foundational knowledge to identify academic concepts and link queries and documents. As a plug-and-play framework, TaxoIndex can be flexibly employed to enhance existing dense retrievers. Extensive experiments show that TaxoIndex brings significant improvements, even with highly limited training data, and greatly enhances interpretability. | SeongKu Kang, Yunyi Zhang, Pengcheng Jiang, Dongha Lee, Jiawei Han, Hwanjo Yu |  |

Currently, PoT primarily uses Python. However, relying solely on a single language may result in suboptimal solutions and overlook the potential benefits of other programming languages. In this paper, we conduct comprehensive experiments on the programming languages used in PoT and find that no single language consistently delivers optimal performance across all tasks and models. The effectiveness of each language varies depending on the specific scenarios. Inspired by this, we propose a task and model agnostic approach called MultiPoT, which harnesses strength and diversity from various languages. Experimental results reveal that it significantly outperforms Python Self-Consistency. Furthermore, it achieves comparable or superior performance compared to the best monolingual PoT in almost all tasks across all... | Xianzhen Luo, Qingfu Zhu, Zhiming Zhang, Libo Qin, Xuanyu Zhang, Qing Yang, Dongliang Xu, Wanxiang Che |  |

Recent red-teaming efforts have identified adversarial suffixes capable of jailbreaking LLMs using the gradient-based search algorithm Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG). However, GCG struggles with computational inefficiency, limiting further investigations regarding suffix transferability and scalability across models and data. In this work, we bridge the connection between search efficiency and suffix transferability. We propose a two-stage transfer learning framework, DeGCG, which decouples the search process into behavior-agnostic pre-searching and behavior-relevant post-searching. Specifically, we employ direct first target token optimization in pre-searching to facilitate the search process. We apply our approach to cross-model, cross-data, and self-transfer scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce an interleaved variant of our approach, i-DeGCG, which iteratively leverages... | Hongfu Liu, Yuxi Xie, Ye Wang, Michael Shieh |  |

Furthermore, the limited size of the training datasets also contributes to the insufficient training of the IUR model. To address the first issue, we propose a multi-task learning framework EO-IUR (Editing Operation-guided Incomplete Utterance Rewriting) that introduces the editing operation labels generated by sequence labeling module to guide generation model to focus on critical tokens. Furthermore, we introduce a token-level heterogeneous graph to represent dialogues. To address the second issue, we propose a two-dimensional utterance augmentation strategy, namely editing operation-based incomplete utterance augmentation and LLM-based historical utterance augmentation.

However, the ability of current large language models (LLMs) to handle such reasoning remains largely uncharted. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark, FRoG, for fuzzy reasoning, featuring real-world mathematical word problems that incorporate generalized quantifiers. Our experimental findings reveal that fuzzy reasoning continues to pose significant challenges for LLMs. Moreover, we find that existing methods designed to enhance reasoning do not consistently improve performance in tasks involving fuzzy logic. Additionally, our results show an inverse scaling effect in the performance of LLMs on FRoG. Interestingly, we also demonstrate that strong mathematical reasoning skills are not necessarily indicative of success on our benchmark. | Yiyuan Li, Shichao Sun, Pengfei Liu |  |

If users query them about political information, they often take a normative stance. To overcome this, we align LLMs with diverse political viewpoints from 100,000 comments written by candidates running for national parliament in Switzerland. Models aligned with this data can generate more accurate political viewpoints from Swiss parties, compared to commercial models such as ChatGPT. We also propose a procedure to generate balanced overviews summarizing multiple viewpoints using such models.

Similarly, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated racial and gender biases in various applications. In this study, we utilize GPT-3.5-Turbo and Llama 3-70B-Instruct to simulate hiring decisions and salary recommendations for candidates with 320 first names that strongly signal their race and gender, across over 750,000 prompts. Our empirical results indicate a preference among these models for hiring candidates with White female-sounding names over other demographic groups across 40 occupations. Additionally, even among candidates with identical qualifications, salary recommendations vary by as much as 5% between different subgroups. A comparison with real-world labor data reveals inconsistent alignment with U.S. labor market characteristics, underscoring the necessity of risk investigation of LLM-powered systems. | Huy Nghiem, John Prindle, Jieyu Zhao, Hal Daumé III |  |

However, existing scaling methods often rely on empirical approaches and lack a profound understanding of the internal distribution within RoPE, resulting in suboptimal performance in extending the context window length. In this paper, we propose to optimize the context window extending task from the view of rotary angle distribution. Specifically, we first estimate the distribution of the rotary angles within the model and analyze the extent to which length extension perturbs this distribution. Then, we present a novel extension strategy that minimizes the disturbance between rotary angle distributions to maintain consistency with the pre-training phase, enhancing the model’s capability to generalize to longer sequences. Experimental results compared to the strong baseline methods demonstrate that our approach reduces by up to 72% of the... | Yingsheng Wu, Yuxuan Gu, Xiaocheng Feng, Weihong Zhong, Dongliang Xu, Qing Yang, Hongtao Liu, Bing Qin |  |

We examine three methodologies: (1) supervised training with RoBERTa using a gold-standard ASC treebank, including by-tag accuracy evaluation for sentences from both native and non-native English speakers, (2) prompt-guided annotation with GPT-4, and (3) generating training data through prompts with GPT-4, followed by RoBERTa training. Our findings indicate that RoBERTa trained on gold-standard data shows the best performance. While data generated through GPT-4 enhances training, it does not exceed the benchmarks set by gold-standard data. | Hakyung Sung, Kristopher Kyle |  |

As their applications expand into multi-agent environments, there arises a need for a comprehensive evaluation framework that captures LLMs’ reasoning, planning, collaboration, and other social abilities. This work introduces a novel competition-based benchmark framework specifically designed to assess LLMs within multi-agent settings, providing quantitative metrics to evaluate their judgment, reasoning, deception, self-awareness, cooperation, coordination, and rationality.We utilize two social deduction games alongside three game-theory scenarios to create diverse environments.Our frame is fortified with the probabilistic graphic modeling (PGM) method, enhancing the LLMs’ capabilities in navigating complex social and cognitive dimensions.

In response, researchers have developed enormous prompt engineering strategies aimed at modifying the prompt text to enhance task performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel technique termed position engineering, which offers a more efficient way to guide large language models. Unlike prompt engineering, which requires substantial effort to modify the text provided to LLMs, position engineering merely involves altering the positional information in the prompt without modifying the text itself. We have evaluated position engineering in two widely-used LLM scenarios: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and in-context learning (ICL). Our findings show that position engineering substantially improves upon the baseline in both cases. Position engineering thus represents a promising new strategy for exploiting the capabilities of large language models. | Zhiyuan He, Huiqiang Jiang, Zilong Wang, Yuqing Yang, Luna Qiu, Lili Qiu |  |

However, these models still face challenges in medical multimodal capabilities due to limitations in the quantity and quality of medical vision-text data, stemming from data privacy concerns and high annotation costs. While pioneering approaches utilize PubMed’s large-scale, de-identified medical image-text pairs to address these limitations, they often fall short due to inherent data noise. To tackle this, we refined medical image-text pairs from PubMed and employed MLLMs (GPT-4V) in an ‘unblinded’ capacity to denoise and reformat the data, resulting in the creation of the \*\*PubMedVision\*\* dataset with 1.3 million medical VQA samples. Our validation demonstrates that: (1) PubMedVision can significantly enhance the medical multimodal capabilities of MLLMs, showing significant improvement in benchmarks including the MMMU Health & Medicine track; (2) manual checks... | Junying Chen, Chi Gui, Ruyi Ouyang, Anningzhe Gao, Shunian Chen, Guiming Chen, Xidong Wang, Zhenyang Cai, Ke Ji, Xiang Wan, Benyou Wang |  |

Through an analysis of LLMs’ internal factual recall at each reasoning step via Knowledge Neurons, we reveal that LLMs fail to harness the critical factual associations under certain circumstances. Instead, they tend to opt for alternative, shortcut-like pathways to answer reasoning questions. By manually manipulating the recall process of parametric knowledge in LLMs, we demonstrate that enhancing this recall process directly improves reasoning performance whereas suppressing it leads to notable degradation. Furthermore, we assess the effect of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, a powerful technique for addressing complex reasoning tasks. Our findings indicate that CoT can intensify the recall of factual knowledge by encouraging LLMs to engage in orderly and reliable reasoning. Furthermore, we explored how... | Yifei Wang, Yuheng Chen, Wanting Wen, Yu Sheng, Linjing Li, Daniel Zeng |  |

First, we propose to use unsupervised morphological analysis with Morfessor as pre-tokenization. Second, we present an algebraic method for obtaining subword embeddings grounded in a word embedding space. Based on that, we design a novel subword segmentation algorithm that uses the embeddings, ensuring that the procedure considers lexical meaning. Third, we introduce an efficient segmentation algorithm based on a subword bigram model that can be initialized with the lexically aware segmentation method to avoid using Morfessor and large embedding tables at inference time. We evaluate the proposed approaches using two intrinsic metrics and measure their performance on two downstream tasks: part-of-speech tagging and machine translation. Our experiments show significant improvements in the morphological plausibility of the segmentation when evaluated using segmentation precision on morpheme boundaries and improved... | Jindrich Libovický, Jindrich Helcl |  |

Most speculative sampling methods such as EAGLE use a static draft tree, implicitly assuming that the acceptance rate of draft tokens depends only on their position. Interestingly, we found that the acceptance rate of draft tokens is also context-dependent. In this paper, building upon EAGLE, we propose EAGLE-2, which introduces a new technique of context-aware dynamic draft tree into drafting modeling. This improvement leverages the fact that the draft model of EAGLE is well-calibrated: the confidence scores from the draft model approximate acceptance rates with small errors. We conducted extensive evaluations on three series of LLMs and six tasks, with EAGLE-2 achieving speedup ratios of up to \*\*5x\*\*, which is 1.3x that of EAGLE. EAGLE-2 also ensures that the distribution of the generated text remains unchanged, making it a... | Yuhui Li, Fangyun Wei, Chao Zhang, Hongyang Zhang |  |

Studies on domain-specific LLMs resort to expanding the vocabulary before fine-tuning on domain-specific corpus, aiming to decrease the sequence length and enhance efficiency during decoding, without thoroughly investigating the results of vocabulary expansion to LLMs over different domains. Our pilot study reveals that expansion with only a subset of the entire vocabulary may lead to superior performance. Guided by the discovery, this paper explores how to identify a vocabulary subset to achieve the optimal results. We introduce VEGAD, an adaptive method that automatically identifies valuable words from a given domain vocabulary. Our method has been validated through experiments on three Chinese datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Despite advancements in performance, the fairness implications of these methods are less understood. This study investigates how varying demonstrations within ICL prompts influence the fairness outcomes of LLMs. Our findings reveal that deliberately including minority group samples in prompts significantly boosts fairness without sacrificing predictive accuracy. Further experiments demonstrate that the proportion of minority to majority samples in demonstrations affects the trade-off between fairness and prediction accuracy. Based on these insights, we introduce a mitigation technique that employs clustering and evolutionary strategies to curate a diverse and representative sample set from the training data. This approach aims to enhance both predictive performance and fairness in... | Jingyu Hu, Weiru Liu, Mengnan Du |  |

However, each province within these regions exhibits its own distinct pronunciation variations. Despite the existence of various speech recognition datasets, none of them has provided a fine-grained classification of the 63 dialects specific to individual provinces of Vietnam. To address this gap, we introduce Vietnamese Multi-Dialect (ViMD) dataset, a novel comprehensive dataset capturing the rich diversity of 63 provincial dialects spoken across Vietnam. Our dataset comprises 102.56 hours of audio, consisting of approximately 19,000 utterances, and the associated transcripts contain over 1.2 million words.

Investigating Universal Adversarial Attacks on Zero-shot LLM Assessment](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.427) |  | 0 | Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful zero-shot assessors used in real-world situations such as assessing written exams and benchmarking systems. Despite these critical applications, no existing work has analyzed the vulnerability of judge-LLMs to adversarial manipulation. This work presents the first study on the adversarial robustness of assessment LLMs, where we demonstrate that short universal adversarial phrases can be concatenated to deceive judge LLMs to predict inflated scores. Since adversaries may not know or have access to the judge-LLMs, we propose a simple surrogate attack where a surrogate model is first attacked, and the learned attack phrase then transferred to unknown judge-LLMs. We propose a practical algorithm to determine the short universal attack phrases and demonstrate that when transferred to unseen models, scores can be drastically inflated such that irrespective of the assessed text, maximum scores are predicted. It is found that judge-LLMs are... | Vyas Raina, Adian Liusie, Mark J. F. Gales |  |

However, recent studies reveal that LLMs are plagued by the “reversal curse”. Most existing methods rely on aggressive sample permutation and pay little attention to delving into the underlying reasons for this issue, resulting in only partial mitigation. In this paper, inspired by human knowledge reversal, we investigate and quantify the individual influence of three potential reasons on the reversal curse: 1) knowledge clarity, 2) entity correlation modeling, and 3) pairwise relationship reasoning capability. Motivated by the analysis of these reasons, we propose a novel \*\*P\*\*airwise entity \*\*O\*\*rder- and \*\*R\*\*elationship-\*\*E\*\*nhanced (\*\*PORE\*\*) data strategy, which facilitates bidirectional entity correlation modeling and pairwise relationship reasoning to overcome the reversal curse.

However, this paper presents a further challenge for real application of domain-specific LLMs beyond CF, called General Capabilities Integration (GCI), which necessitates the integration of both the general capabilities and domain knowledge within a single instance. The objective of GCI is not merely to retain previously acquired general capabilities alongside new domain knowledge, but to harmonize and utilize both sets of skills in a cohesive manner to enhance performance on domain-specific tasks. Taking legal domain as an example, we carefully design three groups of training and testing tasks without lacking practicability, and construct the corresponding datasets. To better incorporate general capabilities across domain-specific scenarios, we introduce ALoRA, which utilizes a multi-head attention module upon... | Chengyuan Liu, Yangyang Kang, Shihang Wang, Lizhi Qing, Fubang Zhao, Chao Wu, Changlong Sun, Kun Kuang, Fei Wu |  |

This paper presents GENRA, a new approach to zero-shot document retrieval that incorporates rank aggregation to improve retrieval effectiveness. Given a query, GENRA first utilizes LLMs to generate informative passages that capture the query’s intent. These passages are then employed to guide the retrieval process, selecting similar documents from the corpus. Next, we use LLMs again for a second refinement step. This step can be configured for either direct relevance assessment of each retrieved document or for re-ranking the retrieved documents. Ultimately, both approaches ensure that only the most relevant documents are kept. Upon this filtered set of documents, we perform multi-document retrieval, generating individual rankings for each... | Georgios Katsimpras, Georgios Paliouras |  |

We address this by introducing XplainLLM, a dataset accompanying an explanation framework designed to enhance LLM transparency and reliability. Our dataset comprises 24,204 instances where each instance interprets the LLM’s reasoning behavior using knowledge graphs (KGs) and graph attention networks (GAT), and includes explanations of LLMs such as the decoder-only Llama-3 and the encoder-only RoBERTa. XplainLLM also features a framework for generating grounded explanations and the debugger-scores for multidimensional quality analysis.

Despite advancements in image captioning and vision-language pretraining, RRG remains challenging due to the lengthy and complex nature of radiology reports. In this work, we proposes the Divide and Conquer Radiology Report Generation (DCRRG) model, which breaks down full-text radiology reports into concise observation descriptions. This approach enables the model to capture fine-grained representations from each observation through a two-stage process: an encoding stage focusing on observation prediction tasks to learn fine-grained representations, and a decoding stage for integrating these descriptions into cohesive and comprehensive radiology reports.

However, the full potential of LVLMs’ Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities remains underutilized. Existing works either focus solely on the text modality or are limited to specific tasks. Moreover, most LVLMs struggle to selectively utilize retrieved information and are sensitive to irrelevant or misleading references. To address these challenges, we propose a self-refinement framework designed to teach LVLMs to Selectively Utilize Retrieved Information (SURf). Specifically, when given questions that are incorrectly answered by the LVLM backbone, we obtain references that help correct the answers (positive references) and those that do not (negative references). We then fine-tune the LVLM backbone using a combination of these positive and negative references.

With large language models (LLMs) demonstrating powerful capabilities between tasks, we can’t help but ask: Can Current LLMs Effectively Make Sequential Decisions? In order to answer this question, we propose the UNO Arena based on the card game UNO to evaluate the sequential decision-making capability of LLMs and explain in detail why we choose UNO. In UNO Arena, We evaluate the sequential decision-making capability of LLMs dynamically with novel metrics based Monte Carlo methods. We set up random players, DQN-based reinforcement learning players, and LLM players (e.g. GPT-4, Gemini-pro) for comparison testing.

These environments are often highly expansive, making it impossible for the LLM to process them within its short-term memory. Motivated by recent research on extending the capabilities of LLMs with tools, we seek to investigate the intriguing potential of tools to augment LLMs in handling such complexity by introducing a novel class of tools, termed \*middleware\*, to aid in the proactive exploration within these massive environments. Such specialized tools can serve as a middleware layer shielding the LLM from environmental complexity. In two representative complex environments—knowledge bases (KBs) and databases—we demonstrate the significant potential of augmenting language agents with tools in complex environments.

Traditional PDG relies on external role data, which can be scarce and raise privacy concerns. Approaches address these issues by extracting role information from dialogue history, which often fail to generically model roles in continuous space. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel framework Models Roles from Personalized Dialogue History by Exploring and Utilizing Latent Space (MORPHEUS) through a three-stage training process. Specifically, we create a persona codebook to represent roles in latent space compactly, and this codebook is used to construct a posterior distribution of role information. This method enables the model to generalize across roles, allowing the generation of personalized dialogues even for unseen roles. Experiments on both Chinese and English datasets demonstrate that MORPHEUS enhances the extraction of role information, and improves response... | Yihong Tang, Bo Wang, Dongming Zhao, Jinxiaojia Jinxiaojia, Zhangjijun Zhangjijun, Ruifang He, Yuexian Hou |  |

However, this practice raises privacy concerns due to the memorization of LLMs. Existing solutions, such as utilizing synthetic data for substitution, struggle to simultaneously improve performance and preserve privacy.They either rely on a local model for generation, resulting in a performance decline, or take advantage of APIs, directly exposing the data to API servers. To address this issue, we propose KnowledgeSG, a novel client-server framework which enhances synthetic data quality and improves model performance while ensuring privacy. We achieve this by learning local knowledge from the private data with differential privacy (DP) and distilling professional knowledge from the server. Additionally, inspired by federated learning, we transmit models rather than data between the client and server to prevent privacy leakage.Extensive experiments in medical and financial... | Wenhao Wang, Xiaoyu Liang, Rui Ye, Jingyi Chai, Siheng Chen, Yanfeng Wang |  |

As we know, both the visual encoder and the Large Language Model (LLM) decoder in LVLMs are Transformer-based, allowing the model to extract visual information and generate text outputs via attention mechanisms. We find that the attention distribution of LLM decoder on image tokens is highly consistent with the visual encoder and both distributions tend to focus on particular background tokens rather than the referred objects in the image. We attribute to the unexpected attention distribution to an inherent flaw in the visual encoder itself, which misguides LLMs to over emphasize the redundant information and generate object hallucination. To address the issue, we propose DAMRO, a novel training-free strategy that \*\*D\*\*ive into \*\*A\*\*ttention \*\*M\*\*echanism of LVLM to \*\*R\*\*educe \*\*O\*\*bject Hallucination.

With the development of large language models (LLMs), some researchers treat large language models as intelligent agents to stimulate and evaluate their planning capabilities. However, the planning mechanism is still unclear. In this work, we focus on exploring the look-ahead planning mechanism in large language models from the perspectives of information flow and internal representations. First, we study how planning is done internally by analyzing the multi-layer perception (MLP) and multi-head self-attention (MHSA) components at the last token. We find that the output of MHSA in the middle layers at the last token can directly decode the decision to some extent. Based on this discovery, we further trace the source of MHSA by information flow, and we reveal that MHSA extracts information from spans of the goal states and recent steps. According to information... | Tianyi Men, Pengfei Cao, Zhuoran Jin, Yubo Chen, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao |  |

However, training these models from scratch requires substantial computational resources and vast amounts of text data. In this paper, we explores an alternative approach to constructing a LLM for a new language by continually pre-training (CPT) from existing pre-trained LLMs, instead of using randomly initialized parameters. Based on parallel experiments on 40 model sizes ranging from 40M to 5B parameters, we find that 1) CPT converges faster and saves significant resources in a scalable manner. 2) CPT adheres to an extended scaling law derived from with a joint data-parameter scaling term. 3) The compute-optimal data-parameter allocation for CPT markedly differs based on our estimated scaling factors. 4) The effectiveness of transfer scale is influenced by training duration and linguistic properties, while robust to data replaying, a method that effectively mitigates... | Wenzhen Zheng, Wenbo Pan, Xu Xu, Libo Qin, Li Yue, Ming Zhou |  |

While reasoning capability can emerge in larger models, smaller ones usually have to rely on distillation to transfer this capability from a larger model. However, recent efforts to distill reasoning capabilities have focused mainly on English, leaving multilingual distillation underexplored. To address this gap, this paper examines existing English reasoning distillation methods that utilize a variety of positive rationales in multilingual settings and proposes d-CoT-nR, a novel approach that incorporates incorrect rationales as additional guidance. Empirical results from multilingual high-school examinations show that d-CoT-nR significantly surpasses the baseline, improving accuracy in unseen languages and correctness in step-by-step reasoning. | Patomporn Payoungkhamdee, Peerat Limkonchotiwat, Jinheon Baek, Potsawee Manakul, Can Udomcharoenchaikit, Ekapol Chuangsuwanich, Sarana Nutanong |  |

For example, if the LLM is equally likely to output two contradicting answers to the same question, then its generated response should reflect this uncertainty by hedging its answer (e.g., “I’m not sure, but I think...”). We formalize faithful response uncertainty based on the gap between the model’s intrinsic confidence in the assertions it makes and the decisiveness by which they are conveyed. This example-level metric reliably indicates whether the model reflects its uncertainty, as it penalizes both excessive and insufficient hedging. We evaluate a variety of aligned LLMs at faithfully conveying uncertainty on several knowledge-intensive question answering tasks. Our results provide strong evidence that modern LLMs are poor at faithfully conveying their uncertainty, and that better alignment is necessary to improve their trustworthiness. | Gal Yona, Roee Aharoni, Mor Geva |  |

It is often conjectured that this can teach the model the behavior of hallucinating factually incorrect responses, as the model is trained to generate facts that are not grounded in its pre-existing knowledge. In this work, we study the impact of such exposure to new knowledge on the capability of the fine-tuned model to utilize its pre-existing knowledge. To this end, we design a controlled setup, focused on closed-book QA, where we vary the proportion of the fine-tuning examples that introduce new knowledge. We demonstrate that large language models struggle to acquire new factual knowledge through fine-tuning, as fine-tuning examples that introduce new knowledge are learned significantly slower than those consistent with the model’s knowledge. However, we also find that as the examples with new knowledge are eventually learned,... | Zorik Gekhman, Gal Yona, Roee Aharoni, Matan Eyal, Amir Feder, Roi Reichart, Jonathan Herzig |  |

Recent research has developed detection models tailored to specific modalities; however, there is a notable gap in transferring detection capabilities across different formats. This study conducts extensive experiments using few-shot in-context learning with large language models to explore the transferability of hate speech detection between modalities. Our findings demonstrate that text-based hate speech examples can significantly enhance the classification accuracy of vision-language hate speech. Moreover, text-based demonstrations outperform vision-language demonstrations in few-shot learning settings. These results highlight the effectiveness of cross-modality knowledge transfer and offer valuable insights for improving hate speech detection systems. | Ming Shan Hee, Aditi Kumaresan, Roy KaWei Lee |  |

However, existing methods for acquiring large-scale intentions bank on distilling large language models with human annotation for verification. Such an approach tends to generate product-centric intentions, overlook valuable visual information from product images, and incurs high costs for scalability. To address these issues, we introduce MIND, a multimodal framework that allows Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to infer purchase intentions from multimodal product metadata and prioritize human-centric ones. Using Amazon Review data, we apply MIND and create a multimodal intention knowledge base, which contains 1,264,441 intentions derived from 126,142 co-buy shopping records across 107,215 products.

We evaluate conflict detection methods, including Natural Language Inference (NLI) models, factual consistency (FC) models, and LLMs, on these conflicts (RQ1) and analyze LLMs’ conflict resolution behaviors (RQ2). Our key findings include: (1) NLI and LLM models exhibit high precision in detecting answer conflicts, though weaker models suffer from low recall; (2) FC models struggle with lexically similar answer conflicts, while NLI and LLM models handle these better; and (3) stronger models like GPT-4 show robust performance, especially with nuanced conflicts.

Predicting the original meta-context of visual misinformation](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.448) |  | 0 | To assist human fact-checkers, researchers have developed automated approaches for visual misinformation detection. These methods assign veracity scores by identifying inconsistencies between the image and its caption, or by detecting forgeries in the image. However, they neglect a crucial point of the human fact-checking process: identifying the original meta-context of the image. By explaining what is actually true about the image, fact-checkers can better detect misinformation, focus their efforts on check-worthy visual content, engage in counter-messaging before misinformation spreads widely, and make their explanation more convincing. Here, we fill this gap by introducing the task of automated image contextualization. We create 5Pils, a dataset of 1,676 fact-checked images with question-answer pairs about their original meta-context. Annotations are based on the 5 Pillars fact-checking framework. We implement a first baseline that grounds the image in its original meta-context... | Jonathan Tonglet, MarieFrancine Moens, Iryna Gurevych |  |

Initially, we equivalently decompose the weights of LoRA into two subspaces, and find that simply mixing them can enhance performance. To study such a phenomenon, we revisit it through a fine-grained subspace lens, showing that such modification is equivalent to employing a fixed mixer to fuse the subspaces. To be more flexible, we jointly learn the mixer with the original LoRA weights, and term the method as Mixture-of-Subspaces LoRA (MoSLoRA). MoSLoRA consistently outperforms LoRA on tasks in different modalities, including commonsense reasoning, visual instruction tuning, and subject-driven text-to-image generation, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness. | Taiqiang Wu, Jiahao Wang, Zhe Zhao, Ngai Wong |  |

In this work, we study human and LLM-based evaluation in a multilingual, multi-cultural setting. We evaluate 30 models across 10 Indic languages by conducting 90K human evaluations and 30K LLM-based evaluations and find that models such as GPT-4o and Llama-3 70B consistently perform best for most Indic languages. We build leaderboards for two evaluation settings - pairwise comparison and direct assessment and analyse the agreement between humans and LLMs. We find that humans and LLMs agree fairly well in the pairwise setting but the agreement drops for direct assessment evaluation especially for languages such as Bengali and Odia. We also check for various biases in human and LLM-based evaluation... | Ishaan Watts, Varun Gumma, Aditya Yadavalli, Vivek Seshadri, Manohar Swaminathan, Sunayana Sitaram |  |

Typically, a leaderboard is defined by a task, dataset, and evaluation metric (TDM) triple, allowing objective performance assessment and fostering innovation through benchmarking. However, the exponential increase in publications has made it infeasible to construct and maintain these leaderboards manually. Automatic leaderboard construction has emerged as a solution to reduce manual labor. Existing datasets for this task are based on the community-contributed leaderboards without additional curation. Our analysis shows that a large portion of these leaderboards are incomplete, and some of them contain incorrect information. In this work, we present SciLead, a manually-curated Scientific Leaderboard dataset that overcomes the aforementioned problems. Building on this dataset, we propose three experimental settings that simulate real-world scenarios where TDM triples... | Furkan Sahinuç, Thy Thy Tran, Yulia Grishina, Yufang Hou, Bei Chen, Iryna Gurevych |  |

We posit that when the downstream tasks are known in advance, which is in practice common, the pretraining process can be aligned to the downstream domain, leading to more efficient and accurate models, while shortening the pretraining step. To this end, we introduce a domain-aligned pretraining strategy that, without additional data collection, improves the accuracy on a domain of interest, herein, that of human activities, while largely preserving the generalist knowledge. At the core of our approach stands a new LLM-based method that, provided with a simple set of concept seeds, produces a concept hierarchy with high coverage of the target domain.The concept hierarchy is used to filter a large-scale web-crawled dataset and, then, enhance the resulting instances with targeted synthetic... | Adrian Bulat, Yassine Ouali, Ricardo Guerrero, Brais Martínez, Georgios Tzimiropoulos |  |

Existing backbone models have limitations such as misspelling, failing to generate texts, and lack of support for Chinese texts, but their development shows promising potential. In this paper, we propose a series of methods, aiming to empower backbone models to generate visual texts in English and Chinese. We first conduct a preliminary study revealing that BPE tokenization and insufficient learning of cross-attention modules restrict the performance of the backbone models. Based on these observations, we make the following improvements: (1) We design a mixed granularity input strategy to provide more suitable text representations; (2) We propose to augment the conventional training objective with three glyph-aware training losses, which enhance the learning of cross-attention modules and encourage the model to focus on... | Wenbo Li, Guohao Li, Zhibin Lan, Xue Xu, Wanru Zhuang, Jiachen Liu, Xinyan Xiao, Jinsong Su |  |

The prerequisite for these RPAs lies in the capability of LLMs to understand characters from fictional works. Previous efforts have evaluated this capability via basic classification tasks or characteristic imitation, failing to capture the nuanced character understanding with LLMs. In this paper, we propose evaluating LLMs’ character understanding capability via the character profiling task, i.e., summarizing character profiles from corresponding materials, a widely adopted yet understudied practice for RPA development. Specifically, we construct the CROSS dataset from literature experts and assess the generated profiles by comparing them with ground truth references and evaluating their applicability in downstream tasks.

Multilingual alignment based on the translation parallel data is an effective method to enhance LLMs’ multilingual capabilities. In this work, we first discover and comprehensively investigate the spontaneous multilingual alignment of LLMs. Firstly, we find that LLMs instruction-tuned on the question translation data (i.e. without annotated answers) are able to encourage the alignment between English and a wide range of languages, even including those unseen during instruction-tuning. Additionally, we utilize different settings and mechanistic interpretability methods to analyze the LLM’s performance in the multilingual scenario comprehensively. Our work suggests that LLMs have enormous potential for improving multilingual alignment efficiently with great language generalization and task generalization. | Shimao Zhang, Changjiang Gao, Wenhao Zhu, Jiajun Chen, Xin Huang, Xue Han, Junlan Feng, Chao Deng, Shujian Huang |  |

Users face a choice between using cloud-based LLMs for generation quality and deploying local-based LLMs for lower computational cost. The former option is typically costly and inefficient, while the latter usually fails to deliver satisfactory performance for reasoning steps requiring deliberate thought processes. In this work, we propose a novel LLM utilization paradigm that facilitates the collaborative operation of large cloud-based LLMs and smaller local-deployed LLMs. Our framework comprises two primary modules: the local agent instantiated with a relatively smaller LLM, handling less complex reasoning steps, and the cloud agent equipped with a larger LLM, managing more intricate reasoning steps. This collaborative processing is enabled through an adaptive mechanism where the local agent introspectively identifies errors and proactively seeks assistance from the cloud agent, thereby effectively integrating... | Hao Sun, Jiayi Wu, Hengyi Cai, Xiaochi Wei, Yue Feng, Bo Wang, Shuaiqiang Wang, Yan Zhang, Dawei Yin |  |

Yet, existing MTL strategies for LLMs often fall short by either being computationally intensive or failing to ensure simultaneous task convergence. This paper presents CoBa, a new MTL approach designed to effectively manage task convergence balance with minimal computational overhead. Utilizing Relative Convergence Scores (RCS), Absolute Convergence Scores (ACS), and a Divergence Factor (DF), CoBa dynamically adjusts task weights during the training process, ensuring that the validation loss of all tasks progress towards convergence at an even pace while mitigating the issue of individual task divergence.

Recent works have attempted to apply DPO to multimodal scenarios but have found it challenging to achieve consistent improvement. Through a comparative experiment, we identify the unconditional preference problem in multimodal preference optimization, where the model overlooks the image condition. To address this problem, we propose mDPO, a multimodal DPO objective that prevents the over-prioritization of language-only preferences by also optimizing image preference. Moreover, we introduce a reward anchor that forces the reward to be positive for chosen responses, thereby avoiding the decrease in their likelihood—an intrinsic problem of relative preference optimization. Experiments on two multimodal LLMs of different sizes and three widely used benchmarks demonstrate that mDPO effectively addresses the unconditional preference problem in multimodal preference optimization... | Fei Wang, Wenxuan Zhou, James Y.

Recent studies have explored using LLMs for efficient data collection. However, LLM-generated data often suffers from quality issues, with underrepresented or absent aspects and low-quality datapoints. To address these problems, we propose Data Advisor, an enhanced LLM-based method for generating data that takes into account the characteristics of the desired dataset. Starting from a set of pre-defined principles in hand, Data Advisor monitors the status of the generated data, identifies weaknesses in the current dataset, and advises the next iteration of data generation accordingly. Data Advisor can be easily integrated into existing data generation methods to enhance data quality and coverage.

Existing approaches to attribution have only been evaluated in RAG settings, where the initial retrieval confounds LLM performance. This is crucially different from the long document setting, where retrieval is not needed, but could help. Thus, a long document specific evaluation of attribution is missing. To fill this gap, we present LAB, a benchmark of 6 diverse long document tasks with attribution, and experiments with different approaches to attribution on 5 LLMs of different sizes. We find that \*citation\*, i.e. response generation and evidence extraction in one step, performs best for large and fine-tuned models, while additional retrieval can help for small, prompted models.

In the medical domain, however, the development of comprehensive foundation models is constrained by limited access to diverse modalities and stringent privacy regulations. To address these constraints, this study introduces a novel knowledge injection approach, FedKIM, designed to scale the medical foundation model within a federated learning framework. FedKIM leverages lightweight local models to extract healthcare knowledge from private data and integrates this knowledge into a centralized foundation model using a designed adaptive Multitask Multimodal Mixture Of Experts (M3OE) module. This method not only preserves privacy but also enhances the model’s ability to handle complex medical tasks involving multiple modalities.

Recent advances have attempted to improve model performance through principles derived from mistakes, yet these approaches suffer from lack of customization and inadequate error coverage. To address these limitations, we propose Retrieved In-Context Principles (RICP), a novel teacher-student framework. In RICP, the teacher model analyzes mistakes from the student model to generate reasons and insights for preventing similar mistakes. These mistakes are clustered based on their underlying reasons for developing task-level principles, enhancing the error coverage of principles. During inference, the most relevant mistakes for each question are retrieved to create question-level principles, improving the customization of the provided guidance.

Due to the redundancy in LLM weights, recent research has focused on pushing weight-only quantization to extremely low-bit (even down to 2 bits). It reduces memory requirements, optimizes storage costs, and decreases memory bandwidth needs during inference. However, due to numerical representation limitations, traditional scalar-based weight quantization struggles to achieve such extreme low-bit.Recent research on Vector Quantization (VQ) for LLMs has demonstrated the potential for extremely low-bit model quantization by compressing vectors into indices using lookup tables. In this paper, we introduce \*\*Vector Post-Training Quantization (VPTQ)\*\* for extremely low-bit quantization of LLMs. We use Second-Order Optimization to formulate the LLM VQ problem and guide our quantization algorithm design by solving the optimization.We further refine the weights using... | Yifei Liu, Jicheng Wen, Yang Wang, Shengyu Ye, Li Lyna Zhang, Ting Cao, Cheng Li, Mao Yang |  |

To support this pursuit, wepresent a weighted variant of Angluin’s (1987)L\* algorithm for learning FSAs. We stay faithful to the original formulation, devising a wayto exactly learn deterministic weighted FSAswhose weights support division. Furthermore,we formulate the learning process in a mannerthat highlights the connection with FSA minimization, showing how L\* directly learns aminimal automaton for the target language. | Clemente Pasti, Talu Karagöz, Franz Nowak, Anej Svete, Reda Boumasmoud, Ryan Cotterell |  |

A promising solution to this issue is verifiable text generation, which prompts LLMs to generate content with citations for accuracy verification. However, verifiable text generation is non-trivial due to the focus-shifting phenomenon, the intricate reasoning needed to align the claim with correct citations, and the dilemma between the precision and breadth of retrieved documents. In this paper, we present VTG, an innovative framework for Verifiable Text Generation with evolving memory and self-reflection. VTG introduces evolving long short-term memory to retain both valuable documents and recent documents. A two-tier verifier equipped with an evidence finder is proposed to rethink and reflect on the relationship between the claim and citations. Furthermore, active retrieval and diverse... | Hao Sun, Hengyi Cai, Bo Wang, Yingyan Hou, Xiaochi Wei, Shuaiqiang Wang, Yan Zhang, Dawei Yin |  |

These issues hinder their trustworthiness and real-world applicability. We propose Pelican – a novel framework designed to detect and mitigate hallucinations through claim verification. Pelican first decomposes the visual claim into a chain of sub-claims based on first-order predicates. These sub-claims consists of (predicate, question) pairs and can be conceptualized as nodes of a computational graph. We then use use Program-of-Thought prompting to generate Python code for answering these questions through flexible composition of external tools. Pelican improves over prior work by introducing (1) intermediate variables for precise grounding of object instances, and (2) shared computation for answering the sub-question to enable adaptive corrections and inconsistency identification. We finally use reasoning abilities of LLM to verify the correctness of the the claim by... | Pritish Sahu, Karan Sikka, Ajay Divakaran |  |

Traditional methods only target labeled attributes, ignoring biases from unlabeled ones. Using text-guided inpainting models, our approach ensures protected group independence from all attributes and mitigates inpainting biases through data filtering. Evaluations on multi-label image classification and image captioning tasks show our method effectively reduces bias without compromising performance across various models. Specifically, we achieve an average societal bias reduction of 46.1% in leakage-based bias metrics for multi-label classification and 74.8% for image captioning. | Yusuke Hirota, Jerone Theodore Alexander Andrews, Dora Zhao, Orestis Papakyriakopoulos, Apostolos Modas, Yuta Nakashima, Alice Xiang |  |

However, there is currently a lack of research specifically focused on vulnerabilities in the PHP language, and challenges in data sampling and processing persist, hindering the model’s ability to effectively capture the characteristics of specific vulnerabilities. In this paper, we present RealVul, the first LLM-based framework designed for PHP vulnerability detection, addressing these issues. By improving code sampling methods and employing normalization techniques, we can isolate potential vulnerability triggers while streamlining the code and eliminating unnecessary semantic information, enabling the model to better understand and learn from the generated vulnerability samples. We also address the issue of insufficient PHP vulnerability samples by improving data synthesis methods. To evaluate RealVul’s performance, we conduct an extensive analysis... | Di Cao, Yong Liao, Xiuwei Shang |  |

These annotations can be costly to produce, error-prone, and require both domain and annotation expertise. With advances in LLMs, we hypothesize that unlabeled data and a schema definition are sufficient for building a working task-oriented dialogue system, completely unsupervised. We consider a novel unsupervised setting of only (1) a well-defined API schema (2) a set of unlabeled dialogues between a user and agent. We propose an innovative approach using expectation-maximization (EM) that infers turn-level annotations as latent variables using a noisy channel model to build an end-to-end dialogue agent. Evaluating our approach on the MultiWOZ benchmark, our method more than doubles the dialogue success rate of a strong GPT-3.5 baseline. | Brendan King, Jeffrey Flanigan |  |

A Study on Judgement Bias](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.474) |  | 0 | Adopting human and large language models (LLM) as judges (\*a.k.a\* human- and LLM-as-a-judge) for evaluating the performance of LLMs has recently gained attention. Nonetheless, this approach concurrently introduces potential biases from human and LLMs, questioning the reliability of the evaluation results. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that is free from referencing groundtruth annotations for investigating \*\*Misinformation Oversight Bias\*\*, \*\*Gender Bias\*\*, \*\*Authority Bias\*\* and \*\*Beauty Bias\*\* on LLM and human judges. We curate a dataset referring to the revised Bloom’s Taxonomy and conduct thousands of evaluations. Results show that human and LLM judges are vulnerable to perturbations to various degrees, and that even the cutting-edge judges possess considerable biases. We further exploit these biases to conduct attacks on LLM judges. We hope that our work can notify the community of the bias and vulnerability of human- and LLM-as-a-judge, as well as... | Guiming Chen, Shunian Chen, Ziche Liu, Feng Jiang, Benyou Wang |  |

Off-policy preference optimization, where the preference data is obtained from other models, is widely adopted due to its cost efficiency and scalability. However, off-policy preference optimization often suffers from a distributional gap between the policy used for data collection and the target policy, leading to suboptimal optimization. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy to mitigate this problem by simulating on-policy learning with off-policy preference data. Our Weighted Preference Optimization (WPO) method adapts off-policy data to resemble on-policy data more closely by reweighting preference pairs according to their probability under the current policy. This method not only addresses the distributional gap problem but also enhances the optimization process without incurring additional costs. We validate our method on... | Wenxuan Zhou, Ravi Agrawal, Shujian Zhang, Sathish Reddy Indurthi, Sanqiang Zhao, Kaiqiang Song, Silei Xu, Chenguang Zhu |  |

Present solutions often demand white-box access to the model or substantial training, which is impractical for cutting-edge commercial LLMs. Moreover, prevailing prompting methods depend on external tool feedback and fail to simultaneously lessen toxicity and bias. Motivated by social psychology principles, we propose a novel strategy named perspective-taking prompting (PeT) that inspires LLMs to integrate diverse human perspectives and self-regulate their responses. This self-correction mechanism can significantly diminish toxicity (up to 89%) and bias (up to 73%) in LLMs’ responses. Rigorous evaluations and ablation studies are conducted on two commercial LLMs (ChatGPT and GLM) and three open-source LLMs, revealing PeT’s superiority in producing less harmful responses, outperforming five strong baselines. | Rongwu Xu, Zi'an Zhou, Tianwei Zhang, Zehan Qi, Su Yao, Ke Xu, Wei Xu, Han Qiu |  |

While contemporary frontier LLMs are capable enough to power reasonably good Language agents, the closed-API model makes it hard to improve in cases they perform sub-optimally. To address this, recent works have explored techniques to improve their performance using self reflection and prompt optimization techniques. While techniques like self reflection work well in an online setup, contemporary prompt optimization techniques are designed to work on simpler tasks. To address this, we introduce METAREFLECTION, a novel offline reinforcement learning technique that enhances the performance of Language Agents by augmenting a semantic memory based on experiential learnings from past trials. We demonstrate the efficacy of METAREFLECTION by evaluating across multiple domains, including complex logical reasoning, biomedical semantic similarity, open world question... | Priyanshu Gupta, Shashank Kirtania, Ananya Singha, Sumit Gulwani, Arjun Radhakrishna, Gustavo Soares, Sherry Shi |  |

A promising approach is to build dialog tutoring models to scaffold students’ problem-solving. However, even though existing models perform well in solving reasoning questions, they can struggle to precisely detect student’s errors and tailor their feedback to these errors. Inspired by real-world teaching practice where teachers identify student errors and customize their response based on them, we focus on verifying student solutions and show how grounding to such verification improves the overall quality of tutor response generation. We collect a dataset of 1,002 stepwise math reasoning chains with the first error step annotated by teachers. We show empirically that finding the mistake in a student solution is challenging for current models. We propose and evaluate several verifiers for detecting these errors. Using both automatic and human evaluation we show that the student solution... | Nico Daheim, Jakub Macina, Manu Kapur, Iryna Gurevych, Mrinmaya Sachan |  |

Recently, binary representation has exhibited remarkable information-preserving capabilities at both lexicon and syntax levels. In this paper, we explore the possibility of leveraging this capability to deduce parsing trees from raw text, relying solely on the implicitly induced grammars within models. To achieve this, we upgrade the bit-level CKY from zero-order to first-order to encode the lexicon and syntax in a unified binary representation space, switch training from supervised to unsupervised under the contrastive hashing framework, and introduce a novel loss function to impose stronger yet balanced alignment signals. Our model shows competitive performance on various datasets, therefore, we claim that our method is effective and efficient enough to acquire high-quality parsing trees from pre-trained language models at a low cost. | Yiran Wang, Masao Utiyama |  |

We present CliMedBench, a comprehensive benchmark with 14 expert-guided core clinical scenarios specifically designed to assess the medical ability of LLMs across 7 pivot dimensions. It comprises 33,735 questions derived from real-world medical reports of top-tier tertiary hospitals and authentic examination exercises. The reliability of this benchmark has been confirmed in several ways. Subsequent experiments with existing LLMs have led to the following findings: (i) Chinese medical LLMs underperform on this benchmark, especially where medical reasoning and factual consistency are vital, underscoring the need for advances in clinical knowledge and diagnostic accuracy. (ii) Several general-domain LLMs demonstrate substantial potential in medical clinics, while the limited... | Zetian Ouyang, Yishuai Qiu, Linlin Wang, Gerard de Melo, Ya Zhang, Yanfeng Wang, Liang He |  |

Adversarial defense techniques have been proposed to reconstruct adversarial examples within feature or text spaces. However, these methods struggle to effectively repair the semantics in adversarial examples, resulting in unsatisfactory defense performance. To repair the semantics in adversarial examples, we introduce a novel approach named Reactive Perturbation Defocusing (Rapid), which employs an adversarial detector to identify the fake labels of adversarial examples and leverages adversarial attackers to repair the semantics in adversarial examples. Our extensive experimental results, conducted on four public datasets, demonstrate the consistent effectiveness of Rapid in various adversarial attack scenarios. For easy evaluation, we provide a click-to-run demo of Rapid at https://tinyurl.com/22ercuf8. | Heng Yang, Ke Li |  |

It has also been well-studied that morphologically rich languages exhibit relatively free word order. This prompts a fundamental investigation: Is there a way to enhance dependency parsing performance, making the model robust to word order variations utilizing the relatively free word order nature of morphologically rich languages? In this work, we examine the robustness of graph-based parsing architectures on 7 relatively free word order languages. We focus on scrutinizing essential modifications such as data augmentation and the removal of position encoding required to adapt these architectures accordingly. To this end, we propose a contrastive self-supervised learning method to make the model robust to word order variations. Furthermore, our proposed modification demonstrates a substantial average gain of 3.03/2.95 points in 7 relatively free word order languages, as... | Pretam Ray, Jivnesh Sandhan, Amrith Krishna, Pawan Goyal |  |

While prior work has established that there is population-level agreement in terms of how humans quantitatively interpret these expressions, there has been little inquiry into the abilities of language models in the same context. In this paper, we investigate how language models map linguistic expressions of uncertainty to numerical responses. Our approach assesses whether language models can employ theory of mind in this setting: understanding the uncertainty of another agent about a particular statement, independently of the model’s own certainty about that statement. We find that 7 out of 10 models are able to map uncertainty expressions to probabilistic responses in a human-like manner. However, we observe systematically different behavior depending on whether a statement is actually true or false. This sensitivity indicates that language models are substantially more susceptible... | Catarina G. Belém, Markelle Kelly, Mark Steyvers, Sameer Singh, Padhraic Smyth |  |

Although CD is applied to various LMs and domains to enhance open-ended text generation, it is still unclear why CD often works well, when it could fail, and how we can make it better. To deepen our understanding of CD, we first theoretically prove that CD could be viewed as linearly extrapolating the next-token logits from a huge and hypothetical LM. We also highlight that the linear extrapolation could make CD unable to output the most obvious answers that have already been assigned high probabilities by the amateur LM.To overcome CD’s limitation, we propose a new unsupervised decoding method called Asymptotic Probability Decoding (APD). APD explicitly extrapolates the probability curves from the LMs of different sizes to infer the asymptotic probabilities from an infinitely large LM without inducing more inference costs than CD.

Previous studies have implemented slot-based input improvements, such as schema-driven descriptions and question-answering formats, but still suffer from negative transfer for seen slots and inefficient transfer for unseen slots due to the significant source-target domain gap. To address these issues, we introduce a novel framework called Context-aware Auto-prompting and Instruction-following Contrastive Decoding (CAPID). This framework generates dynamic, context-aware slot queries, effectively improving the model’s transferability. Our context-aware auto-prompting approach tailors slot queries to the current dialogue context, increasing flexibility and reducing ambiguities. Additionally, an instruction-following contrastive decoding strategy helps reduce errors related to off-topic slots by penalizing deviations from... | Xiaoyu Dong, Yujie Feng, Zexin Lu, Guangyuan Shi, XiaoMing Wu |  |

Our focus is on three categories of knowledge conflicts: context-memory, inter-context, and intra-memory conflict. These conflicts can significantly impact the trustworthiness and performance of LLMs, especially in real-world applications where noise and misinformation are common. By categorizing these conflicts, exploring the causes, examining the behaviors of LLMs under such conflicts, and reviewing available solutions, this survey aims to shed light on strategies for improving the robustness of LLMs, thereby serving as a valuable resource for advancing research in this evolving area. | Rongwu Xu, Zehan Qi, Zhijiang Guo, Cunxiang Wang, Hongru Wang, Yue Zhang, Wei Xu |  |

Many efforts to address misinformation focus on a knowledge deficit model and propose interventions for improving users’ critical thinking through access to facts. Such efforts are often hampered by challenges with scalability, and by platform users’ personal biases. The emergence of generative AI presents promising opportunities for countering misinformation at scale across ideological barriers. In this paper, we introduce a framework (MisinfoEval) for generating and comprehensively evaluating large language model (LLM) based misinformation interventions.

Multimodal data plays an increasingly important role in the development of machine learning and has shown to positively impact performance. But information can do more than exist across modes— it can exist across time. How should we attend to temporal data that consists of multiple information types? This work introduces (i) the MEANT model, a Multimodal Encoder for Antecedent information and (ii) a new dataset called TempStock, which consists of price, Tweets, and graphical data with over a million Tweets from all of the companies in the S&P 500 Index. We find that MEANT improves performance on existing baselines by over 15%, and that the textual information affects performance far more than the visual information on our time-dependent task from our ablation study. The code and dataset will be made available upon publication. | Benjamin Irving, Annika Marie Schoene |  |

Prior research on decoding methods, primarily focusing on task-specific models, may not extend to the current era of general-purpose large language models (LLMs). Moreover, the recent influx of decoding strategies has further complicated this landscape. This paper provides a comprehensive and multifaceted analysis of various decoding methods within the context of LLMs, evaluating their performance, robustness to hyperparameter changes, and decoding speeds across a wide range of tasks, models, and deployment environments. Our findings reveal that decoding method performance is notably task-dependent and influenced by factors such as alignment, model size, and quantization.

Such lack of flexibility in granularity negatively affects many applications that can benefit from more granular ranking, such as sentence-level ranking for open-domain QA, or proposition-level ranking for attribution. In this work, we introduce the idea of any-granularity ranking which leverages multi-vector embeddings to rank at varying levels of granularity while maintaining encoding at a single (coarser) level of granularity. We propose a multi-granular contrastive loss for training multi-vector approaches and validate its utility with both sentences and propositions as ranking units. Finally, we demonstrate the application of proposition-level ranking to post-hoc citation addition in retrieval-augmented generation, surpassing the performance of prompt-driven citation... | Revanth Gangi Reddy, Omar Attia, Yunyao Li, Heng Ji, Saloni Potdar |  |

Listwise LLM rerankers have showcased superior performance and generalizability compared to existing supervised approaches. However, conventional listwise LLM reranking methods lack efficiency as they provide ranking output in the form of a generated ordered sequence of candidate passage identifiers. Further, they are trained with the typical language modeling objective, which treats all ranking errors uniformly–potentially at the cost of misranking highly relevant passages. Addressing these limitations, we introduce FIRST, a novel listwise LLM reranking approach leveraging the output logits of the first generated identifier to directly obtain a ranked ordering of the candidates. Further, we incorporate a learning-to-rank loss during training, prioritizing ranking accuracy for the more relevant passages. Empirical results demonstrate that FIRST accelerates inference... | Revanth Gangi Reddy, JaeHyeok Doo, Yifei Xu, Md. Arafat Sultan, Deevya Swain, Avirup Sil, Heng Ji |  |

This research investigates the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to nested NER, exploring methodologies from prior work and introducing specific reasoning techniques and instructions to improve LLM efficacy. Through experiments conducted on the ACE 2004, ACE 2005, and GENIA datasets, we evaluate the impact of these approaches on nested NER performance. Results indicate that output format critically influences nested NER performance, methodologies from previous works are less effective, and our nested NER-tailored instructions significantly enhance performance. Additionally, we find that label information and descriptions of nested cases are crucial in eliciting the capabilities of LLMs for nested NER, especially in specific domains (i.e., the GENIA dataset).

Detecting such content is challenging due to the scale of the data and limited exposure of each instance during training. We propose ReCaLL (Relative Conditional Log-Likelihood), a novel membership inference attack (MIA) to detect LLMs’ pretraining data by leveraging their conditional language modeling capabilities. ReCaLL examines the relative change in conditional log-likelihoods when prefixing target data points with non-member context. Our empirical findings show that conditioning member data on non-member prefixes induces a larger decrease in log-likelihood compared to non-member data. We conduct comprehensive experiments and show that ReCaLL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WikiMIA dataset, even with random and synthetic prefixes, and can be further improved using an ensemble approach. Moreover, we conduct an in-depth... | Roy Xie, Junlin Wang, Ruomin Huang, Minxing Zhang, Rong Ge, Jian Pei, Neil Gong, Bhuwan Dhingra |  |

However, these methods can unintentionally alter unrelated parametric knowledge representations, potentially increasing the risk of harm. In this work, we investigate how weight editing methods unexpectedly amplify model biases after edits. We introduce a novel benchmark dataset, Seesaw-CF, for measuring bias amplification of model editing methods for demographic traits such as race, geographic origin, and gender. We use Seesaw-CF to examine the impact of model editing on bias in five large language models. Our results demonstrate that edited models exhibit, to various degrees, more biased behavior for certain demographic groups than before they were edited, specifically becoming less confident in properties for Asian and African subjects. Additionally, editing facts about place of birth, country of citizenship, or gender has particularly negative effects on the model’s knowledge about... | Karina Halevy, Anna Sotnikova, Badr AlKhamissi, Syrielle Montariol, Antoine Bosselut |  |

We explore it in two steps. First, we introduce a new task of LLM targeted unlearning, where given an unlearning target (e.g., a person) and some unlearning documents, we aim to unlearn only the information about the target, rather than everything in the unlearning documents. We further argue that a successful unlearning should satisfy criteria such as not outputting gibberish, not fabricating facts about the unlearning target, and not releasing factual information under jailbreak attacks. Second, we construct a causal intervention framework for targeted unlearning, where the knowledge of the unlearning target is modeled as a confounder between LLM input and output, and the unlearning process as a deconfounding process. This framework justifies and extends WHP, deriving a simple unlearning algorithm that includes WHP as a special case. Experiments on existing and new... | Yujian Liu, Yang Zhang, Tommi S.

Despite many recent works proposing new algorithms, datasets, and training pipelines, there is a lack of comprehensive studies measuring the impact of various design choices throughout the whole training process. We first conduct a rigorous analysis over a three-stage training pipeline consisting of supervised fine-tuning, offline preference learning, and online preference learning. We have found that using techniques like sequence packing, loss masking in SFT, increasing the preference dataset size in DPO, and online DPO training can significantly improve the performance of language models. We then train from Gemma-2b-base and LLama-3-8b-base, and find that our best models exceed the performance of the official instruct models tuned with closed-source data and algorithms.

We instruction-tune local LLMs as universal DP task solvers that operate on a local, single, and low-priced GPU, ensuring data security and enabling further customization. We select a collection of datasets across four representative DP tasks and construct instruction data using data configuration, knowledge injection, and reasoning data distillation techniques tailored to DP. By tuning Mistral-7B, Llama 3-8B, and OpenOrca-Platypus2-13B, our models, Jellyfish-7B/8B/13B, deliver competitiveness compared to GPT-3.5/4 models and strong generalizability to unseen tasks while barely compromising the base models’ abilities in NLP tasks. Meanwhile, Jellyfish offers enhanced reasoning capabilities compared to GPT-3.5.

Nevertheless, previous surveys on scientific LLMs often concentrate on one or two fields or a single modality. In this paper, we aim to provide a more holistic view of the research landscape by unveiling cross-field and cross-modal connections between scientific LLMs regarding their architectures and pre-training techniques. To this end, we comprehensively survey over 260 scientific LLMs, discuss their commonalities and differences, as well as summarize pre-training datasets and evaluation tasks for each field and modality. Moreover, we investigate how LLMs have been deployed to benefit scientific discovery. Resources related to this survey are available at https://github.com/yuzhimanhua/Awesome-Scientific-Language-Models. | Yu Zhang, Xiusi Chen, Bowen Jin, Sheng Wang, Shuiwang Ji, Wei Wang, Jiawei Han |  |

Current approaches to this kind of fact-checking are based on verifying each piece of a model generation against potential evidence using an LLM. However, this process can be very computationally expensive, requiring many calls to a model to check a single response. In this work, we show how to build small fact-checking models that have GPT-4-level performance but for 400x lower cost. We do this by constructing synthetic training data with GPT-4, which involves creating realistic yet challenging instances of factual errors via a structured generation procedure. Training on this data teaches models to check each fact in the claim and recognize synthesis of information across sentences. For evaluation, we unify datasets from recent work on fact-checking and grounding LLM generations into a new benchmark,... | Liyan Tang, Philippe Laban, Greg Durrett |  |

Though large language models (LLM) could automate the coding process and improve the efficiency of such tasks, interpretability remains paramount for maintaining patient trust. Current efforts in interpretability of medical coding applications rely heavily on label attention mechanisms, which often leads to the highlighting of extraneous tokens irrelevant to the ICD code. To facilitate accurate interpretability in medical language models, this paper leverages dictionary learning that can efficiently extract sparsely activated representations from dense language model embeddings in superposition. Compared with common label attention mechanisms, our model goes beyond token-level representations by building an interpretable dictionary which enhances the mechanistic-based explanations for each ICD code prediction, even when the highlighted... | John Wu, David Wu, Jimeng Sun |  |

However, achieving desired accuracy comes at the cost of larger model sizes and increased computational demands. Thus, serving predictions from these models to meet any latency and cost requirements of applications remains a key challenge, despite recent work in building inference serving systems as well as algorithmic approaches that dynamically adapt models based on inputs. Our paper introduces a new form of dynamism, modality selection, where we adaptively choose modalities from inference inputs while maintaining the model quality. We introduce MOSEL, an automated inference serving system for multi-modal ML models that carefully picks input modalities per request based on user-defined performance and accuracy requirements. MOSEL exploits modality configurations extensively, improving system throughput by 3.6 × with an accuracy... | Bodun Hu, Le Xu, Jeongyoon Moon, Neeraja J. Yadwadkar, Aditya Akella |  |

RICHES offers an alternative to conventional RAG systems by eliminating the need for separate retriever and generator. It retrieves documents by directly decoding their contents, constrained on the corpus. Unifying retrieval with generation allows us to adapt to diverse new tasks via prompting alone. RICHES can work with any Instruction-tuned model, without additional training. It provides attributed evidence, supports multi-hop retrievals and interleaves thoughts to plan on what to retrieve next, all within a single decoding pass of the LLM. We demonstrate the strong performance of RICHES across ODQA tasks including attributed and multi-hop QA. | Palak Jain, Livio Baldini Soares, Tom Kwiatkowski |  |

However, existing methods suffer in performance when they fine-tune an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model on synthetic data as they suffer from the distributional shift commonly referred to as the synthetic-to-real gap. In this paper, we find that task arithmetic is effective at mitigating this gap. Our proposed method, SYN2REAL task vector, shows an average improvement of 10.03% improvement in word error rate over baselines on the SLURP dataset. Additionally, we show that an average of SYN2REAL task vectors, when we have real speeches from multiple different domains, can further adapt the original ASR model to perform better on the target text domain. | Hsuan Su, Hua Farn, FanYun Sun, ShangTse Chen, Hungyi Lee |  |

Existing approaches either rely on accessibility (which is often unrealistic) or involve significantly increased train- and inference-time costs. This paper addresses those limitations or shortcomings by proposing a novel approach, namely CoBB (Correct for improving QA reasoning of Black-Box LLMs). It uses a trained adaptation model to perform a seq2seq mapping from the often-imperfect reasonings of the original black-box LLM to the correct or improved reasonings. Specifically, the adaptation model is initialized with a relatively small open-source LLM and adapted over a collection of sub-sampled training pairs. To select the representative pairs of correct and incorrect reasonings, we formulated the dataset construction as an optimization problem that... | Jaehyung Kim, Dongyoung Kim, Yiming Yang |  |

In this work, we examine whether such agents can perform realistic and time-consuming tasks on the web, e.g., monitoring real-estate markets or locating relevant nearby businesses. We introduce AssistantBench, a challenging new benchmark consisting of 214 realistic tasks that can be automatically evaluated, covering different scenarios and domains. We find that AssistantBench exposes the limitations of current systems, including language models and retrieval-augmented language models, as no model reaches an accuracy of more than 25 points. While closed-book LMs perform well in terms of accuracy, they exhibit low precision and tend to hallucinate facts. State-of-the-art web agents reach a score of near zero. Additionally, we introduce SeePlanAct (SPA), a new web agent that significantly outperforms previous agents, and an ensemble of SPA and closed-book... | Ori Yoran, Samuel Joseph Amouyal, Chaitanya Malaviya, Ben Bogin, Ofir Press, Jonathan Berant |  |

Most existing watermarking methods require access to the underlying LLM’s logits, which LLM API providers are loath to share due to fears of model distillation. As such, these watermarks must be implemented independently by each LLM provider. In this paper, we develop PostMark, a modular post-hoc watermarking procedure in which an input-dependent set of words (determined via a semantic embedding) is inserted into the text after the decoding process has completed. Critically, PostMark does not require logit access, which means it can be implemented by a third party. We also show that PostMark is more robust to paraphrasing attacks than existing watermarking methods: our experiments cover eight baseline algorithms, five base LLMs, and three datasets. Finally, we evaluate the impact of PostMark on text quality using both automated and human... | Yapei Chang, Kalpesh Krishna, Amir Houmansadr, John Wieting, Mohit Iyyer |  |

However, its effectiveness hinges on the retrieval robustness of the model. If the model lacks retrieval robustness, its performance is constrained by the accuracy of the retriever, resulting in significant compromises when the retrieved context is irrelevant. In this paper, we evaluate the “implicit” retrieval robustness of various large language models, instructing them to directly output the final answer without explicitly judging the relevance of the retrieved context. Our findings reveal that fine-tuning on a mix of gold and distracting context significantly enhances the model’s robustness to retrieval inaccuracies, while still maintaining its ability to extract correct answers when retrieval is accurate. This suggests that large language models can implicitly handle relevant or irrelevant retrieved context by learning solely from the supervision of the... | Xiaoyu Shen, Rexhina Blloshmi, Dawei Zhu, Jiahuan Pei, Wei Zhang |  |

However, optimizing these objectives simultaneously can obscure how improving one aspect might impact the others. In this work, we focus on analyzing the relationship between two concepts essential in both language model alignment and political science: truthfulness and political bias. We train reward models on various popular truthfulness datasets and subsequently evaluate their political bias. Our findings reveal that optimizing reward models for truthfulness on these datasets tends to result in a left-leaning political bias. We also find that existing open-source reward models (i.e., those trained on standard human preference datasets) already show a similar bias and that the bias is larger for larger models. These results raise important questions about the datasets used to represent truthfulness, potential limitations of aligning models to be... | Suyash Fulay, William Brannon, Shrestha Mohanty, Cassandra Overney, Elinor PooleDayan, Deb Roy, Jad Kabbara |  |

However, these systems do not always perform well and improving them using the data traces collected from a deployment remains an open challenge. The data traces contain LLM inputs and outputs, but the annotations from LLMs are noisy. We hypothesize that Active Label Correction (ALC) can be use on the collected data to train smaller task-specific improved models that can replace LLM-based modules. In this paper, we study the noise in three GPT-3.5-annotated datasets and their denoising with human feedback. We also propose a novel method ALC3 that iteratively applies three updates to the training dataset: auto-correction, correction using human feedback and filtering. Our results show that ALC3 can lead to oracle performance with feedback on 17-24% fewer examples than the number of noisy examples in the dataset across three different NLP tasks. | Karan Taneja, Ashok K.

However, assessing the statistical uncertainty in downstream conclusions drawn from word embedding statistics has remained challenging. When using only point estimates for embeddings, researchers have no streamlined way of assessing the degree to which their model selection criteria or scientific conclusions are subject to noise due to sparsity in the underlying data used to generate the embeddings. We introduce a method to obtain approximate, easy-to-use, and scalable reconstruction error variance estimates for GloVe, one of the most widely used word embedding models, using an analytical approximation to a multivariate normal model. To demonstrate the value of embeddings with variance (GloVe-V), we illustrate how our approach enables principled hypothesis testing in core word embedding tasks, such as... | Andrea Vallebueno, Cassandra HandanNader, Christopher D.

We study this question via \*annotation alignment\*, the extent to which LLMs and humans agree when annotating the safety of user-chatbot conversations. We leverage the recent DICES dataset (Aroyo et al. 2023), in which 350 conversations are each rated for safety by 112 annotators spanning 10 race-gender groups. GPT-4 achieves a Pearson correlation of r=0.59 with the average annotator rating, higher than the median annotator’s correlation with the average (r=0.51). We show that larger datasets are needed to resolve whether GPT-4 exhibits disparities in how well it correlates with different demographic groups. Also, there is substantial idiosyncratic variation in correlation within groups, suggesting that race & gender do not fully capture differences in alignment. Finally, we find that GPT-4 cannot predict when one demographic group finds a conversation more unsafe than another. | Rajiv Movva, Pang Wei Koh, Emma Pierson |  |

Meanwhile, automated distractor generation, even with the help of large language models (LLMs), remains challenging for subjects like math. It is crucial to not only identify plausible distractors but also understand the error behind them. In this paper, we introduce DiVERT (Distractor Generation with Variational Errors Represented as Text), a novel variational approach that learns an interpretable representation of errors behind distractors in math MCQs. Through experiments on a real-world math MCQ dataset with 1,434 questions used by hundreds of thousands of students, we show that DiVERT, despite using a base open-source LLM with 7B parameters, outperforms state-of-the-art approaches using GPT-4o on downstream distractor generation.

However, will this strategy result in nonfactual demographic distribution, especially when generating real historical figures? In this work, we propose \*\*DemOgraphic FActualIty Representation (DoFaiR)\*\*, a benchmark to systematically quantify the trade-off between using diversity interventions and preserving demographic factuality in T2I models. DoFaiR consists of 756 meticulously fact-checked test instances to reveal the factuality tax of various diversity prompts through an automated evidence-supported evaluation pipeline. Experiments on DoFaiR unveil that diversity-oriented instructions increase the number of different gender and racial groups in DALLE-3’s generations at the cost of historically inaccurate demographic distributions. To resolve this issue, we propose \*\*Fact-Augmented Intervention\*\*... | Yixin Wan, Di Wu, Haoran Wang, KaiWei Chang |  |

However, the data used to train or fine-tune these LLMs is often undisclosed, allowing an attacker to compromise the data and inject backdoors into the models. In this paper, we develop a novel inference time defense, named CleanGen, to mitigate backdoor attacks for generation tasks in LLMs. CleanGen is a lightweight and effective decoding strategy that is compatible with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs. Our insight behind CleanGen is that compared to other LLMs, backdoored LLMs assign significantly higher probabilities to tokens representing the attacker-desired contents. These discrepancies in token probabilities enable CleanGen to identify suspicious tokens favored by the attacker and replace them with tokens generated by another LLM that is not compromised by the same... | Yuetai Li, Zhangchen Xu, Fengqing Jiang, Luyao Niu, Dinuka Sahabandu, Bhaskar Ramasubramanian, Radha Poovendran |  |

However, a major challenge arises from the sparsity of these reward signals - typically, there is only a single reward for an entire output. This sparsity of rewards can lead to inefficient and unstable learning. To address this challenge, our paper introduces an novel framework that utilizes the critique capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce intermediate-step rewards during RL training. Our method involves coupling a policy model with a critic language model, which is responsible for providing comprehensive feedback of each part of the output. This feedback is then translated into token or span-level rewards that can be used to guide the RL training process. We investigate this approach under two different settings: one where the policy model is smaller and is paired with a more powerful critic model, and another where a single language model... | Meng Cao, Lei Shu, Lei Yu, Yun Zhu, Nevan Wichers, Yinxiao Liu, Lei Meng |  |

With only 7% of those affected receiving any form of help, societal stigma not only discourages individuals with SUD from seeking help but isolates them, hindering their recovery journey and perpetuating a cycle of shame and self-doubt. This study investigates how stigma manifests on social media, particularly Reddit, where anonymity can exacerbate discriminatory behaviors. We analyzed over 1.2 million posts, identifying 3,207 that exhibited stigmatizing language related to people who use substances (PWUS). Of these, 1,649 posts were classified as containing directed stigma towards PWUS, which became the focus of our de-stigmatization efforts. Using Informed and Stylized LLMs, we developed a model to transform these instances into more empathetic language.Our paper contributes to the field by proposing a computational framework... | Layla Bouzoubaa, Elham Aghakhani, Rezvaneh Rezapour |  |

Existing efforts either (i) re-train or finetune LLMs for decision making, or (ii) design prompts for pretrained LLMs. The former approach suffers from the computational burden of gradient updates, and the latter approach does not show promising results. In this paper, we propose a new approach that leverages online model selection algorithms to efficiently incorporate LLMs agents into sequential decision making. Statistically, our approach significantly outperforms both traditional decision making algorithms and vanilla LLM agents. Computationally, our approach avoids the need for expensive gradient updates of LLMs, and throughout the decision making process, it requires only a small number of LLM calls. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach. As an example, on a large-scale Amazon dataset, our approach achieves more than a 6x... | Dingyang Chen, Qi Zhang, Yinglun Zhu |  |

SignCLIP is an efficient method of learning useful visual representations for sign language processing from large-scale, multilingual video-text pairs, without directly optimizing for a specific task or sign language which is often of limited size.We pretrain SignCLIP on Spreadthesign, a prominent sign language dictionary consisting of ~500 thousand video clips in up to 44 sign languages, and evaluate it with various downstream datasets. SignCLIP discerns in-domain signing with notable text-to-video/video-to-text retrieval accuracy. It also performs competitively for out-of-domain downstream tasks such as isolated sign language recognition upon essential few-shot prompting or fine-tuning.We analyze the latent space formed by the spoken language text and sign language... | Zifan Jiang, Gerard Sant, Amit Moryossef, Mathias Müller, Rico Sennrich, Sarah Ebling |  |

PLS lacks a dedicated assessment metric, and the suitability of text generation evaluation metrics is unclear due to the unique transformations involved (e.g., adding background explanations, removing jargon). To address these questions, our study introduces a granular meta-evaluation testbed, APPLS, designed to evaluate metrics for PLS. We identify four PLS criteria from previous work—informativeness, simplification, coherence, and faithfulness—and define a set of perturbations corresponding to these criteria that sensitive metrics should be able to detect. We apply these perturbations to extractive hypotheses for two PLS datasets to form our testbed. Using APPLS, we assess performance of 14 metrics, including automated scores, lexical features, and LLM prompt-based evaluations. Our analysis reveals that while some current metrics show sensitivity to specific... | Yue Guo, Tal August, Gondy Leroy, Trevor Cohen, Lucy Lu Wang |  |

KNUDGE (\*\*KN\*\*owledge Constrained \*\*U\*\*ser-NPC \*\*D\*\*ialogue \*\*GE\*\*neration) requires models to produce trees of dialogue between video game characters that accurately reflect quest and entity specifications stated in natural language. KNUDGE is constructed from side quest dialogues drawn directly from game data of Obsidian Entertainment’s _The Outer Worlds_, leading to real-world complexities in generation: (1) utterances must remain faithful to the game lore, including character personas and backstories; (2) a dialogue must accurately reveal new quest details to the human player; and (3) dialogues are large trees as opposed to linear chains of utterances. We report results for a set of neural generation models using supervised and in-context learning techniques; we find competent performance but room for future work addressing the challenges of creating realistic, game-quality dialogues. | Nathaniel Weir, Ryan Thomas, Randolph D'Amore, Kellie Hill, Benjamin Van Durme, Harsh Jhamtani |  |

To start, our work exhaustively characterizes the impact of passive inheritance of model properties by systematically studying how the source of synthetic data shapes models’ internal biases, calibration and preferences, and their generations’ textual attributes, providing one of the most comprehensive studies to-date. We find that models are surprisingly sensitive towards certain attributes even when the synthetic data prompts appear “neutral” which invites the question: can we explicitly steer the distilled data towards desired properties? We demonstrate how such active inheritance can steer the generation profiles of models towards desirable non-differentiable attributes in both directions, e.g. increasing lexical diversity or reducing toxicity. Overall, our study broadens the understanding of the implicit biases inherited by LLMs and... | Luísa Shimabucoro, Sebastian Ruder, Julia Kreutzer, Marzieh Fadaee, Sara Hooker |  |

However, existing resources for minimal pairs address a limited number of languages and lack diversity of language-specific grammatical phenomena. This paper introduces the Russian Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal Pairs (RuBLiMP), which includes 45k pairs of sentences that differ in grammaticality and isolate a morphological, syntactic, or semantic phenomenon. In contrast to existing benchmarks of linguistic minimal pairs, RuBLiMP is created by applying linguistic perturbations to automatically annotated sentences from open text corpora and decontaminating test data. We describe the data collection protocol and present the results of evaluating 25 language models in various scenarios. We find that the widely used LMs for Russian are sensitive to morphological and agreement-oriented contrasts, but fall behind humans on phenomena requiring the understanding of structural relations,... | Ekaterina Taktasheva, Maxim Bazhukov, Kirill Koncha, Alena Fenogenova, Ekaterina Artemova, Vladislav Mikhailov |  |

Previous approaches often generate tables that directly replicate information from the text, limiting their applicability in broader contexts, as text-to-table generation in real-life scenarios necessitates information extraction, reasoning, and integration. However, there is a lack of both datasets and methodologies towards this task. In this paper, we introduce LiveSum, a new benchmark dataset created for generating summary tables of competitions based on real-time commentary texts. We evaluate the performances of state-of-the-art LLMs on this task in both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings, and additionally propose a novel pipeline called T3(Text-Tuple-Table) to improve their performances.

The research literature, however, includes conflicting perspectives on how CB should be defined, evaluated, and achieved. We propose a conceptual framework to address these questions and survey researchers active in this area.We find consensus on several key points. Researchers broadly accept our proposed definition of CB, agree that it is not solved by current models, and doubt that scale alone will achieve the target behavior. In other areas, we find the field is split on how to move forward, identifying diverse opportunities for future research. | Kate McCurdy, Paul Soulos, Paul Smolensky, Roland Fernandez, Jianfeng Gao |  |

We study prompt optimization for LM programs, i.e. how to update these prompts to maximize a downstream metric without access to module-level labels or gradients. To make this tractable, we factorize our problem into optimizing the free-form instructions and few-shot demonstrations of every module and introduce several strategies to craft task-grounded instructions and navigate credit assignment across modules. Our strategies include (i) program- and data-aware techniques for proposing effective instructions, (ii) a stochastic mini-batch evaluation function for learning a surrogate model of our objective, and (iii) a meta-optimization procedure in which we refine how LMs construct proposals over time. Using these insights we develop MIPRO, a novel algorithm for optimizing LM... | Krista OpsahlOng, Michael J. Ryan, Josh Purtell, David Broman, Christopher Potts, Matei Zaharia, Omar Khattab |  |

Using words as a test case, we evaluate our technique across multiple model sizes and datasets and find that it improves language models’ psychometric predictive power.However, we find an inverse relationship between psychometric power and a model’s performance on downstream NLP tasks as well as its perplexity on... | Samuel Kiegeland, Ethan Wilcox, Afra Amini, David Robert Reich, Ryan Cotterell |  |

However, there are significant trustworthiness concerns as RALMs are prone to generating unfaithful outputs, including baseless information or contradictions with the retrieved context. This paper proposes SynCheck, a lightweight monitor that leverages fine-grained decoding dynamics including sequence likelihood, uncertainty quantification, context influence, and semantic alignment to synchronously detect unfaithful sentences. By integrating efficiently measurable and complementary signals, SynCheck enables accurate and immediate feedback and intervention. Experiments show that SynCheck significantly outperforms existing faithfulness detection baselines, achieving over 0.85 AUROC across a suite of six long-form retrieval-augmented generation tasks. Leveraging SynCheck, we further introduce FOD, a faithfulness-oriented decoding algorithm guided by beam search... | Di Wu, JiaChen Gu, Fan Yin, Nanyun Peng, KaiWei Chang |  |

Firstly, natural language often encompasses complex relationships among entities, making it challenging to maintain a clear reasoning chain over longer spans. Secondly, the abundance of linguistic diversity means that the same entities and relationships can be expressed using different terminologies and structures, complicating the task of identifying and establishing connections between multiple pieces of information. Graphs provide an effective solution to represent data rich in relational information and capture long-term dependencies among entities. To harness the potential of graphs, our paper introduces Structure Guided Prompt, an innovative three-stage task-agnostic prompting framework designed to improve the multi-step reasoning capabilities of LLMs in a zero-shot... | Kewei Cheng, Nesreen K.

If, for example, one has little training data for emotion detection, first fine-tuning a language model on a sentiment classification dataset may improve performance strongly. But which task to choose for transfer learning? Prior methods producing useful task rankings are infeasible for large source pools, as they require forward passes through all source language models. We overcome this by introducing Embedding Space Maps (ESMs), light-weight neural networks that approximate the effect of fine-tuning a language model. We conduct the largest study on NLP task transferability and task selection with 12k source-target pairs. We find that applying ESMs on a prior method reduces execution time and disk space usage by factors of 10 and 278, respectively, while retaining high selection performance (avg. regret@5 score of 2.95). | David Schulte, Felix Hamborg, Alan Akbik |  |

Studying well-known processing errors, such as NPI illusive effects can reveal whether a model prioritizes linear or hierarchical information when processing language. Recent experiments have found that BERT is mildly susceptible to Negative Polarity Item (NPI) illusion effects (Shin et al., 2023; Vu and Lee, 2022). We expand on these results by examining the effect of distance on the illusive effect, using and modifying stimuli from Parker and Phillips (2016). We also further tease apart whether the model is more affected by hierarchical distance or linear distance. We find that BERT is highly sensitive to syntactic hierarchical information: added hierarchical layers affected its processing capabilities compared to added linear distance. | So Lee, Mai Vu |  |

However, progress in this direction has been hampered by a long-standing lack of a clear protocol for determining what _valid decompositional entailment_ is. This absence causes noisy datasets and limited performance gains by modern neuro-symbolic entailment engines. To address these problems, we formulate a consistent and theoretically grounded approach to annotating decompositional entailment and evaluate its impact on LLM-based textual inference. We find that our new dataset, RDTE (Recognizing Decompositional Textual Entailment), has a substantially higher internal consistency than prior decompositional entailment datasets, suggesting that RDTE is a significant step forward in the long-standing problem of forming a clear protocol for discerning entailment. We also find that training an... | Nathaniel Weir, Kate Sanders, Orion Weller, Shreya Sharma, Dongwei Jiang, Zhengping Jiang, Bhavana Dalvi Mishra, Oyvind Tafjord, Peter A.

We introduce AMAMMERε, a test set of 525 multiple-choice questions designed to evaluate the commonsense knowledge of English LLMs, relative to the cultural contexts of Ghana and the United States. To create AMAMMERε, we select a set of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) from existing commonsense datasets and rewrite them in a multi-stage process involving surveys of Ghanaian and U.S. participants. In three rounds of surveys, participants from both pools are solicited to (1) write correct and incorrect answer choices, (2) rate individual answer choices on a 5-point Likert scale, and (3) select the best answer choice from the newly-constructed MCQ items, in a final validation step. By engaging participants at multiple stages, our procedure ensures that participant perspectives are incorporated both in the creation and validation of test items, resulting in high levels of agreement within each pool.

However, these efforts largely overlook an important GUI-referring task: screen reading based on user-indicated points, which we name the Screen Point-and-Read (ScreenPR) task. Currently, this task is predominantly handled by rigid accessible screen reading tools, in great need of new models driven by advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). In this paper, we propose a Tree-of-Lens (ToL) agent, utilizing a novel ToL grounding mechanism, to address the ScreenPR task. Based on the input point coordinate and the corresponding GUI screenshot, our ToL agent constructs a Hierarchical Layout Tree. Based on the tree, our ToL agent not only comprehends the content of the indicated area but also articulates the layout and spatial relationships between elements. Such layout information is crucial for... | Yue Fan, Lei Ding, ChingChen Kuo, Shan Jiang, Yang Zhao, Xinze Guan, Jie Yang, Yi Zhang, Xin Wang |  |

These \*conversational search engines\* operate by loading retrieved website text into the LLM context for summarization and interpretation. Recent research demonstrates that LLMs are highly vulnerable to jailbreaking and prompt injection attacks, which disrupt the safety and quality goals of LLMs using adversarial strings. This work investigates the impact of prompt injections on the ranking order of sources referenced by conversational search engines. To this end, we introduce a focused dataset of real-world consumer product websites and formalize conversational search ranking as an adversarial problem. Experimentally, we analyze conversational search rankings in the absence of adversarial injections and show that different LLMs vary significantly in prioritizing product name, document content, and context position. We then present a tree-of-attacks-based... | Samuel Pfrommer, Yatong Bai, Tanmay Gautam, Somayeh Sojoudi |  |

Enabled by these low-rank settings, we propose an even more efficient optimization strategy: Fast Forward, a simple and effective approach to accelerate large segments of SGD training. In a Fast Forward stage, we repeat the most recent optimizer step until the loss stops improving on a tiny validation set. By alternating between regular optimization steps and Fast Forward stages, Fast Forward provides up to an 87% reduction in FLOPs over standard SGD with Adam. We validate Fast Forward by finetuning various models on different tasks and demonstrate that it speeds up training without compromising model performance. Additionally, we analyze when and how to apply Fast Forward. | Adir Rahamim, Naomi Saphra, Sara Kangaslahti, Yonatan Belinkov |  |

The standard direct estimator, which averages the model’s accuracy on the questions in each subgroup, may exhibit high variance for subgroups (topics) with small sample sizes. Synthetic regression modeling, which leverages the model’s accuracy on questions about other topics, may yield biased estimates that are too unreliable for large subgroups. We prescribe a simple yet effective solution: an empirical Bayes (EB) estimator that balances direct and regression estimates for each subgroup separately, improving the precision of subgroup-level estimates of model performance. Our experiments on multiple datasets show that this approach consistently provides more precise estimates of the LLM performance compared to the direct and regression approaches, achieving substantial reductions in the mean squared error.

In this work, we study the systematicity gap in visual question answering: the performance difference between reasoning on previously seen and unseen combinations of object attributes. To test, we introduce a novel diagnostic dataset, CLEVR-HOPE. We find that the systematicity gap is not reduced by increasing the quantity of training data, but is reduced by increasing the diversity of training data. In particular, our experiments suggest that the more distinct attribute type combinations are seen during training, the more systematic we can expect the resulting model to be. | Ian BerlotAttwell, Kumar Krishna Agrawal, Annabelle Michael Carrell, Yash Sharma, Naomi Saphra |  |

Can we automatically generate these tables using language models (LMs)? In this work, we introduce a framework that leverages LMs to perform this task by decomposing it into separate schema and value generation steps. To enable experimentation, we address two main challenges: First, we overcome a lack of high-quality datasets to benchmark table generation by curating and releasing arxivDIGESTables, a new dataset of 2,228 literature review tables extracted from ArXiv papers that synthesize a total of 7,542 research papers. Second, to support scalable evaluation of model generations against human-authored reference tables, we develop DecontextEval, an automatic evaluation method that aligns elements of tables with the same underlying aspects despite differing surface forms.... | Benjamin Newman, Yoonjoo Lee, Aakanksha Naik, Pao Siangliulue, Raymond Fok, Juho Kim, Daniel S.

The increasing cognitive alignment of these models has made them candidates for cognitive science theories. Prior research into the emergent cognitive abilities of PLMs has been path-independent to model training, i.e. has only looked at the final model weights and not the intermediate steps. However, building plausible models of human cognition using PLMs also requires aligning their performance during training to the developmental trajectories of children’s thinking. Guided by psychometric tests of human intelligence, we choose four task categories to investigate the alignment of ten popular families of PLMs and evaluate each of their available intermediate and final training steps: Numerical ability, Linguistic abilities, Conceptual understanding, and Fluid reasoning. We find a striking regularity: regardless of model size, the developmental trajectories of PLMs consistently... | Raj Sanjay Shah, Khushi Bhardwaj, Sashank Varma |  |

To enable empirical evaluation on methods towards the improved form of reading order prediction (ROP), we establish a comprehensive benchmark dataset including the reading order annotation as relations over layout elements, together with a relation-extraction-based method... | Chong Zhang, Yi Tu, Yixi Zhao, Chenshu Yuan, Huan Chen, Yue Zhang, Mingxu Chai, Ya Guo, Huijia Zhu, Qi Zhang, Tao Gui |  |

While efficient, SSMs struggle with tasks requiring in-context retrieval, such as text copying and associative recall, limiting their usefulness in practical settings. Prior work on how to meet this challenge has focused on the internal model architecture and not investigated the role of the training procedure. This paper proposes a new training procedure that improve the performance of SSMs on retrieval-intensive tasks. This novel pre-training procedure combines a bidirectional processing of the input with dynamic mixtures of pre-training objectives to improve the utilization of the SSM’s fixed-size state. Our experimental evaluations show that this procedure significantly improves performance on retrieval-intensive tasks that challenge current SSMs, such as phone book lookup, long paragraph... | Sam Blouir, Jimmy T.

We hypothesise that the current practices of fine-tuning and evaluating these models may not perfectly align with this objective owing to a heavy reliance on translation, which cannot cover language-specific knowledge but can introduce translation defects. It remains unknown whether the nature of the instruction data has an impact on the model output; conversely, it is questionable whether translated test sets can capture such nuances. Due to the often coupled practices of using translated data in both stages, such imperfections could have been overlooked. This work investigates these issues using controlled native or translated data during the instruction tuning and evaluation stages. We show that native or generation benchmarks reveal a notable difference between native and translated instruction data especially when model performance is high, whereas other types of test... | Pinzhen Chen, Simon Yu, Zhicheng Guo, Barry Haddow |  |

However, individual tokens are often semantically unrelated to the meanings of the words/concepts they comprise. For example, Llama-2-7b’s tokenizer splits the word “patrolling” into two tokens, “pat” and “rolling”, neither of which correspond to semantically meaningful units like “patrol” or "-ing.” Similarly, the overall meanings of named entities like “Neil Young” and multi-word expressions like “break a leg” cannot be directly inferred from their constituent tokens. Mechanistically, how do LLMs convert such arbitrary groups of tokens into useful higher-level representations? In this work, we find that last token representations of named entities and multi-token words exhibit a pronounced “erasure” effect, where information about previous and current tokens is rapidly forgotten in early layers. Using this observation, we propose a method to “read... | Sheridan Feucht, David Atkinson, Byron C. Wallace, David Bau |  |

Nevertheless, these models need to be capable of finding relevant information, extracting it, and answering the question simultaneously. Currently, existing methods perform all of these steps in a single pass without being able to adapt if insufficient or incorrect information is collected. To overcome this, we introduce a modular multi-LMM agent framework based on several agents with different roles, instructed by a Planner agent that updates its instructions using shared feedback from the other agents. Specifically, we propose TraveLER, a method that can create a plan to "\*\*Trave\*\*rse” through the video, ask questions about individual frames to "\*\*L\*\*ocate” and store key information, and then "\*\*E\*\*valuate” if there is enough information to answer the question.... | Chuyi Shang, Amos You, Sanjay Subramanian, Trevor Darrell, Roei Herzig |  |

Despite its importance, there has been limited research on this aspect of conversation in recent years, especially after the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs). Previous studies have highlighted the shortcomings of pre-trained language models in conversational grounding. However, most testing for conversational grounding capabilities involves human evaluations that are costly and time-consuming. This has led to a lack of testing across multiple models of varying sizes, a critical need given the rapid rate of new model releases. This gap in research becomes more significant considering recent advances in language models, which have led to new emergent capabilities. In this paper, we aim to evaluate the performance of LLMs in various aspects of conversational grounding and analyze why some models perform better than others.

However, LLMs pose significant security risks due to their tendency to memorize training data, leading to potential privacy breaches and copyright infringement. Therefore, accurate measurement of the memorization is essential to evaluate and mitigate these potential risks. However, previous attempts to characterize memorization are constrained by either using prefixes only or by prepending a constant soft prompt to the prefixes, which cannot react to changes in input. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method for estimating LLM memorization using dynamic, prefix-dependent soft prompts. Our approach involves training a transformer-based generator to produce soft prompts that adapt to changes in input, thereby enabling more accurate extraction of memorized data. Our method not only addresses the... | Zhepeng Wang, Runxue Bao, Yawen Wu, Jackson Taylor, Cao Xiao, Feng Zheng, Weiwen Jiang, Shangqian Gao, Yanfu Zhang |  |

However, it is unclear to what extent VLMs prioritize this information to represent concepts. We propose Extract and Explore (EX2), a novel approach to characterize textual features that are important for VLMs. EX2 uses reinforcement learning to align a large language model with VLM preferences and generates descriptions that incorporate features that are important for the VLM. Then, we inspect the descriptions to identify features that contribute to VLM representations. Using EX2, we find that spurious descriptions have a major role in VLM representations despite providing no helpful information, e.g., Click to enlarge photo of CONCEPT. More importantly, among informative descriptions, VLMs rely significantly on non-visual attributes like habitat (e.g., North America) to represent visual concepts. Also, our analysis reveals that different VLMs prioritize different... | Reza Esfandiarpoor, Cristina Menghini, Stephen H. Bach |  |

Progress on large language models (LLMs) has prompted a series of recent works applying them to KGC, e.g., via zero/few-shot prompting. Despite successes on small domain-specific datasets, these models face difficulties scaling up to text common in many real-world applications. A principal issue is that, in prior methods, the KG schema has to be included in the LLM prompt to generate valid triplets; larger and more complex schemas easily exceed the LLMs’ context window length. Furthermore, there are scenarios where a fixed pre-defined schema is not available and we would like the method to construct a high-quality KG with a succinct self-generated schema. To address these problems, we propose a three-phase framework named Extract-Define-Canonicalize (EDC): open information extraction followed by schema definition and post-hoc canonicalization. EDC is flexible in that it can be... | Bowen Zhang, Harold Soh |  |

Despite the superior performance of KGE models in practice, we discover a deficiency in the expressiveness of some popular existing KGE models called Z-paradox. Motivated by the existence of Z-paradox, we propose a new KGE model called MQuinE that does not suffer from Z-paradox while preserves strong expressiveness to model various relation patterns including symmetric/asymmetric, inverse, 1-N/N-1/N-N, and composition relations with theoretical justification. Experiments on real-world knowledge bases indicate that Z-paradox indeed degrades the performance of existing KGE models, and can cause more than 20% accuracy drop on some challenging test samples. Our experiments further demonstrate that MQuinE can mitigate the negative impact of Z-paradox and outperform existing KGE models by a visible margin on link prediction tasks. | Yang Liu, Huang Fang, Yunfeng Cai, Mingming Sun |  |

However, linking theoretical results to empirical performance is not straightforward due to the complex interplay between the architecture, the learning algorithm, and training data. To test whether theoretical lower bounds imply learnability of formal languages, we turn to recent work relating transformers to n-gram language models (LMs). We study transformers’ ability to learn random n-gram LMs of two kinds: ones with arbitrary next-symbol probabilities and ones where those are defined with shared parameters. We find that classic estimation techniques for n-gram LMs such as add-𝜆 smoothing outperform transformers on the former, while transformers perform better on the latter, outperforming methods specifically designed to learn n-gram LMs. | Anej Svete, Nadav Borenstein, Mike Zhou, Isabelle Augenstein, Ryan Cotterell |  |

However, the variety of input-output formats complicate finding the prompts. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a promising for prompt tuning due to its ability to incrementally produce better results through interaction with the environment. But its inherent training instability and environmental dependency make it difficult to use in practice. In this paper, we propose StablePrompt, a prompt tuning method based on RL. We formulate prompt tuning as RL problem between agent and target LLM, and introduce Adaptive Proximal Policy Optimization (APPO), an modified version of PPO for prompt tuning. APPO introduces an anchor model and updates it adaptively based on the training trajectory. Using this anchor model for the KL divergence term in PPO keeps the search space flexible and ensures training stability. We evaluate StablePrompt on various tasks,... | Minchan Kwon, Gaeun Kim, Jongsuk Kim, Haeil Lee, Junmo Kim |  |

However, evaluating the output quality of such systems on long-context tasks remains challenging, as tasks like Needle-in-a-Haystack lack complexity. In this work, we argue that summarization can play a central role in such evaluation. We design a procedure to synthesize Haystacks of documents, ensuring that specific insights repeat across documents. The “Summary of a Haystack” (SummHay) task then requires a system to process the Haystack and generate, given a query, a summary that identifies the relevant insights and precisely cites the source documents. Since we have precise knowledge of what insights should appear in a haystack summary and what documents should be cited, we implement a highly reproducible automatic evaluation that can score summaries on two aspects – Coverage and Citation. We generate Haystacks in two domains (conversation, news), and perform a large-scale evaluation of 10 LLMs and... | Philippe Laban, Alexander R. Fabbri, Caiming Xiong, ChienSheng Wu |  |

Seq2edit models normally iteratively refine the correction result, while seq2seq models decode only once without aware of subsequent tokens. Iteratively refining the correction results of seq2seq models via Multi-Pass Decoding (MPD) may lead to better performance. However, MPD increases the inference costs. Deleting or replacing corrections in previous rounds may lose useful information in the source input. We present an early-stop mechanism to alleviate the efficiency issue. To address the source information loss issue, we propose to merge the source input with the previous round correction result into one sequence. Experiments on the CoNLL-14 test set and BEA-19 test set show that our approach can lead to consistent and significant improvements over strong BART and T5 baselines (+1.80, +1.35, and +2.02 F0.5 for BART 12-2, large... | Xiaoying Wang, Lingling Mu, Jingyi Zhang, Hongfei Xu |  |

To emulate the common educational scenario where children/students learn by listening to and participating in conversations of their parents/teachers, we create Collaborative STORM (Co-STORM). Unlike QA systems that require users to ask all the questions, Co-STORM lets users observe and occasionally steer the discourse among several LM agents. The agents ask questions on the user’s behalf, allowing the user to discover unknown unknowns serendipitously. To facilitate user interaction, Co-STORM assists users in tracking the discourse by organizing the uncovered information into a dynamic mind map, ultimately generating a comprehensive report as takeaways. For automatic evaluation, we construct the WildSeek dataset by collecting real information-seeking records with user goals. Co-STORM... | Yucheng Jiang, Yijia Shao, Dekun Ma, Sina J.

In this work, we introduce syntactic knowledge to select better in-context examples for machine translation (MT). We propose a new strategy, namely Syntax-augmented COverage-based In-context example selection (SCOI), leveraging the deep syntactic structure beyond conventional word matching. Specifically, we measure the set-level syntactic coverage by computing the coverage of polynomial terms with the help of a simplified tree-to-polynomial algorithm, and lexical coverage using word overlap. Furthermore, we devise an alternate selection approach to combine both coverage measures, taking advantage of syntactic and lexical information. We conduct experiments with two multi-lingual LLMs on six translation directions. Empirical results show that our proposed SCOI obtains the highest average COMET... | Chenming Tang, Zhixiang Wang, Yunfang Wu |  |

In this work, we introduce Temporal Grounding Bridge (TGB), a novel framework that bootstraps MLLMs with advanced temporal grounding capabilities and broadens their contextual scope. Our framework significantly enhances the temporal capabilities of current MLLMs through three key innovations: an efficient multi-span temporal grounding algorithm applied to low-dimension temporal features projected from flow; a multimodal length extrapolation training paradigm that utilizes low-dimension temporal features to extend the training context window size; and a bootstrapping framework that bridges our model with pluggable MLLMs without requiring annotation. We validate TGB across seven video benchmarks and demonstrate substantial performance... | Yuxuan Wang, Yueqian Wang, Pengfei Wu, Jianxin Liang, Dongyan Zhao, Yang Liu, Zilong Zheng |  |

However, with a challenging source domain like narrative, multiple annotators can agree a summary is faithful, while missing details that are obvious errors only once pointed out. We therefore introduce a new dataset, StorySumm, comprising LLM summaries of short stories with localized faithfulness labels and error explanations. This benchmark is for evaluation methods, testing whether a given method can detect challenging inconsistencies. Using this dataset, we first show that any one human annotation protocol is likely to miss inconsistencies, and we advocate for pursuing a range of methods when establishing ground truth for a summarization dataset. We finally test recent automatic metrics and find that none of them achieve more than 70% balanced accuracy on this task, demonstrating that it is a challenging benchmark for future work in faithfulness evaluation. | Melanie Subbiah, Faisal Ladhak, Akankshya Mishra, Griffin Adams, Lydia B.

Today’s multimodal models mainly focus on the correspondence between images and text, using this for tasks like image-text matching. However, this covers only a subset of real-world interactions. Novel interactions, such as sarcasm expressed through opposing spoken words and gestures or humor expressed through utterances and tone of voice, remain challenging. In this paper, we introduce an approach to enhance multimodal models, which we call Multimodal Mixtures of Experts (MMoE). The key idea in MMoE is to train separate expert models for each type of multimodal interaction, such as redundancy present in both modalities, uniqueness in one modality, or synergy that emerges when both modalities are fused. On a sarcasm detection task (MUStARD) and a humor detection task (URFUNNY), we obtain new state-of-the-art results. MMoE is also able to be applied to various types of models to... | Haofei Yu, Zhengyang Qi, Lawrence Jang, Russ Salakhutdinov, LouisPhilippe Morency, Paul Pu Liang |  |

However, processing extensive videos such as 24-hour CCTV footage or full-length films presents significant challenges due to the vast data and processing demands. Traditional methods, like extracting key frames or converting frames to text, often result in substantial information loss. To address these shortcomings, we develop OmAgent, efficiently stores and retrieves relevant video frames for specific queries, preserving the detailed content of videos. Additionally, it features an Divide-and-Conquer Loop capable of autonomous reasoning, dynamically invoking APIs and tools to enhance query processing and accuracy. This approach ensures robust video understanding, significantly reducing information loss. Experimental results affirm OmAgent’s efficacy in handling various types of videos and complex tasks. Moreover, we have endowed it... | Lu Zhang, Tiancheng Zhao, Heting Ying, Yibo Ma, Kyusong Lee |  |

Diverging from most works focusing on data mixing, our study concentrates on enhancing the model’s capabilities from the perspective of data sampling during training. Drawing inspiration from the human learning process, where it is generally easier to master solutions to similar topics through focused practice on a single type of topic, we introduce a novel instruction tuning strategy termed CommonIT: Commonality-aware Instruction Tuning. Specifically, we cluster instruction datasets into distinct groups with three proposed metrics Task, Embedding and Length). We ensure each training mini-batch, or “partition”, consists solely of data from a single group, which brings about both data randomness across mini-batches and intra-batch data similarity. Rigorous testing on LLaMa models demonstrates CommonIT’s effectiveness in enhancing the instruction-following capabilities of LLMs through... | Jun Rao, Xuebo Liu, Lian Lian, Shengjun Cheng, Yunjie Liao, Min Zhang |  |

However, existing neural codecs often trade model complexity for reconstruction performance. These codecs primarily use convolutional blocks for feature transformation, which are not inherently suited for capturing the local redundancies in speech signals. To compensate, they require either adversarial discriminators or a large number of model parameters to enhance audio quality. In response to these challenges, we introduce the Efficient Speech Codec (ESC), a lightweight, parameter-efficient speech codec based on a cross-scale residual vector quantization scheme and transformers. Our model employs mirrored hierarchical window transformer blocks and performs step-wise decoding from coarse-to-fine feature representations. To enhance bitrate efficiency, we propose a novel combination of vector quantization techniques along with a pre-training paradigm.... | Yuzhe Gu, Enmao Diao |  |

Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) present an efficient alternative to dense models, while the existing methods to convert pretrained dense models to MoEs is limited to ReLU-based models with natural sparsity. This paper introduces G-MoEfication, applicable to arbitrary dense models, where ReLU-based activation sparsity assumptions no longer hold. For generalizations, we encounter the dilemma of needing to zero-out deactivated experts, while also avoiding excessive zeroing-out to retain dense activation information. We publicly release our code and report results conducted with mBERT, SantaCoder-1.1B, Phi-2-2.7B, and Falcon-7B demonstrating the efficacy of our approach in general scenarios: from multitask to multilingual, from fine-tuning to zero-shot evaluation. | Jaeseong Lee, Seungwon Hwang, Wonpyo Park, Mingi Ji |  |

However, it is becoming increasingly difficult as language model’s capabilities of generating human-like texts keep evolving. This study provides a new perspective by using the relative likelihood values instead of absolute ones, and extracting useful features from the spectrum-view of likelihood for the human-model text detection task. We propose a detection procedure with two classification methods, supervised and heuristic-based, respectively, which results in competitive performances with previous zero-shot detection methods and a new state-of-the-art on short-text detection. Our method can also reveal subtle differences between human and model languages, which find theoretical roots in psycholinguistics studies. | Yang Xu, Yu Wang, Hao An, Zhichen Liu, Yongyuan Li |  |

These methods harness feedback, sourced either from humans or AI, as direct rewards or to shape reward models that steer LM optimization. Nonetheless, the effective integration of rewards from diverse sources presents a significant challenge due to their disparate characteristics. To address this, recent research has developed algorithms incorporating strategies such as weighting, ranking, and constraining to handle this complexity. Despite these innovations, a bias toward disproportionately high rewards can still skew the reinforcement learning process and negatively impact LM performance. This paper explores a methodology for reward composition that enables simultaneous improvements in LMs across multiple dimensions. Inspired by fairness theory, we introduce a training algorithm that... | Jiahui Li, Hanlin Zhang, Fengda Zhang, TaiWei Chang, Kun Kuang, Long Chen, Jun Zhou |  |

To mitigate the presence of undesirable knowledge, the task of knowledge unlearning becomes crucial for language models. Previous research relies on gradient ascent methods to achieve knowledge unlearning, which is simple and effective. However, this approach calculates all the gradients of tokens in the sequence, potentially compromising the general ability of language models. To overcome this limitation, we propose an adaptive objective that calculates gradients with fine-grained control specifically targeting sensitive tokens. Our adaptive objective is pluggable, ensuring simplicity and enabling extension to the regularization-based framework that utilizes non-target data or other models to preserve general ability. Through extensive experiments targeting the removal of typical sensitive data, we demonstrate that our proposed method enhances the... | Xiaohua Feng, Chaochao Chen, Yuyuan Li, Zibin Lin |  |

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional mastery of world knowledge and semantic understanding, rendering them more robust against spelling errors. However, the application of LLMs in CSC is a double-edged sword, as they tend to unnecessarily alter sentence length and modify rare but correctly used phrases. In this paper, by leveraging the capabilities of LLMs while mitigating their limitations, we propose a novel plug-and-play Alignment-and-Replacement Module ARM that enhances the performance of existing CSC models and without the need for retraining or fine-tuning. Experiment results and analysis on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and competitiveness of the proposed module. | Changchun Liu, Kai Zhang, Junzhe Jiang, Zirui Liu, Hanqing Tao, Min Gao, Enhong Chen |  |

ICG is curious, since language models are usually not explicitly trained in the same way as the in-context prompt, and the distribution of examples in the prompt differs from that of sequences in the pretrained corpora. This paper provides a systematic study of the ICG ability of language models, covering discussions about its source and influential factors, in the view of both theory and empirical experiments. Concretely, we first propose a plausible latent variable model to model the distribution of the pretrained corpora, and then formalize ICG as a problem of next topic prediction. With this framework, we can prove that the repetition nature of a few topics ensures the ICG ability on them theoretically.... | Zhongtao Jiang, Yuanzhe Zhang, Kun Luo, Xiaowei Yuan, Jun Zhao, Kang Liu |  |

However, there are no guarantees that any explanations from these models are faithful, i.e. that they reflect the inner workings of the model. Atomic inference overcomes this issue, providing interpretable and faithful model decisions. This approach involves making predictions for different components (or atoms) of an instance, before using interpretable and deterministic rules to derive the overall prediction based on the individual atom-level predictions. We investigate the effectiveness of using LLM-generated facts as atoms, decomposing Natural Language Inference premises into lists of facts. While directly using generated facts in atomic inference systems can result in worse performance, with 1) a multi-stage fact generation process, and 2) a training regime that incorporates the facts, our fact-based method outperforms other approaches. | Joe Stacey, Pasquale Minervini, Haim Dubossarsky, OanaMaria Camburu, Marek Rei |  |

However, models are still far from supporting the world’s 7000+ languages. We propose XEUS, a Cross-lingual Encoder for Universal Speech, trained on over 1 million hours of data across 4057 languages, extending the language coverage of SSL models 4-fold. We combine 1 million hours of speech from existing publicly accessible corpora with a newly created corpus of 7400+ hours from 4057 languages, which will be publicly released. To handle the diverse conditions of multilingual speech data, we augment the typical SSL masked prediction approach with a novel dereverberation objective, increasing robustness. We evaluate XEUS on several benchmarks, and show that it consistently outperforms or achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art (SOTA) SSL models across a variety of tasks. XEUS sets a new SOTA on the ML-SUPERB benchmark: it outperforms MMS 1B and w2v-BERT... | William Chen, Wangyou Zhang, Yifan Peng, Xinjian Li, Jinchuan Tian, Jiatong Shi, Xuankai Chang, Soumi Maiti, Karen Livescu, Shinji Watanabe |  |

We conduct an in-depth investigation to understand why this occurs. Contrary to the common belief that these instances is due to the more detailed nature of LLM-generated content, our study identifies another contributing factor: an LLM is inherently more “familiar” with LLM generated responses. This familiarity is evidenced by lower perplexity before fine-tuning. We design a series of experiments to understand the impact of the “familiarity” and our conclusion reveals that this “familiarity” significantly impacts learning performance. Training with LLM-generated responses not only enhances performance but also helps maintain the model’s capabilities in other reasoning tasks after fine-tuning on a specific task. | Xuan Ren, Biao Wu, Lingqiao Liu |  |

However, the spontaneous multilingual alignment in these models is shown to be weak, leading to unsatisfactory cross-lingual transfer and knowledge sharing. Previous works attempt to address this issue by explicitly injecting multilingual alignment information during or after pretraining. Thus for the early stage in pretraining, the alignment is weak for sharing information or knowledge across languages. In this paper, we propose PreAlign, a framework that establishes multilingual alignment prior to language model pretraining. PreAlign injects multilingual alignment by initializing the model to generate similar representations of aligned words and preserves this alignment using a code-switching strategy during pretraining. Extensive experiments in a synthetic English to English-Clone setting demonstrate that PreAlign significantly outperforms standard multilingual... | Jiahuan Li, Shujian Huang, Aarron Ching, Xinyu Dai, Jiajun Chen |  |

On image transcreation for cultural relevance](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.573) |  | 0 | Given the rise of multimedia content, human translators increasingly focus on culturally adapting not only words but also other modalities such as images to convey the same meaning. While several applications stand to benefit from this, machine translation systems remain confined to dealing with language in speech and text. In this work, we introduce a new task of translating images to make them culturally relevant. First, we build three pipelines comprising state-of-the-art generative models to do the task. Next, we build a two-part evaluation dataset – (i) concept: comprising 600 images that are cross-culturally coherent, focusing on a single concept per image; and (ii) application: comprising 100 images curated from real-world applications. We conduct a multi-faceted human evaluation of translated images to assess for cultural relevance and meaning preservation. We find that as of today, image-editing models fail at this task, but can be improved by leveraging LLMs and retrievers... | Simran Khanuja, Sathyanarayanan Ramamoorthy, Yueqi Song, Graham Neubig |  |

We observe curious components: good-performing ones that individually do well on a classification task, even when the model performs poorly; bad-performing ones that do much worse than chance; and label-biased components that always predict the same label. We find that component accuracies are well-correlated across different demonstration sets and perturbations of prompt templates. Based on our findings, we propose component reweighting, which learns to linearly re-scale the component activations from a few labeled examples. Given 24 labeled examples, our method improves by an average of 6.0% accuracy points over 24-shot ICL across 8 tasks on Llama-2-7B. Overall, this paper both enriches our understanding of ICL and provides a practical method for improvement by examining model internals. | TingYun Chang, Jesse Thomason, Robin Jia |  |

These posts often use eye-catching disinformation in mixed modalities to mislead users to click for profit. That affects the user experience and thus would be blocked by content provider. To escape detection, malicious creators use tricks to add some irrelevant non-bait content into bait posts, dressing them up as legal to fool the detector. This content often has biased relations with non-bait labels, yet traditional detectors tend to make predictions based on simple co-occurrence rather than grasping inherent factors that lead to malicious behavior. This spurious bias would easily cause misjudgments. To address this problem, we propose a new debiased method based on causal inference. We first employ a set of features in multiple modalities to characterize the posts. Considering these features are often mixed up with unknown biases, we then disentangle three kinds of latent factors from them, including the invariant factor... | Jianxing Yu, Shiqi Wang, Han Yin, Zhenlong Sun, Ruobing Xie, Bo Zhang, Yanghui Rao |  |

While high-dimensional embeddings generally demonstrate superior performance as they contain more salient information, their practical application is frequently hindered by elevated computational latency and the associated higher cost. To address these challenges, we propose Matryoshka-Adaptor, a novel tuning framework designed for the customization of LLM embeddings. Matryoshka-Adaptor facilitates substantial dimensionality reduction while maintaining comparable performance levels, thereby achieving a significant enhancement in computational efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Our framework directly modifies the embeddings from pre-trained LLMs which is designed to be seamlessly integrated with any LLM architecture, encompassing those accessible exclusively through black-box APIs.

Despite its efficiency, the construction of SFT data often struggles with issues of quality, diversity, and scalability. Many existing methods, inspired by the Self-Instruct framework, typically generate synthetic instructions by prompting aligned proprietary models like ChatGPT. However, such process suffers from stale distribution, resulting in instructions that are merely trivial variations of existing ones. In this paper, we introduce a novel bootstrapping approach termed KNN-Instruct, which incorporates KNN deduction to produce meaningful new instructions by effectively summarizing and learning from similar existing ones. We conduct an economical controlled experiment to preliminarily validate its effectiveness. In the further experiment, we construct a high-quality SFT dataset named KNN-Inst-12k\*. Applying the dataset to Qwen-2-7B, we get a MT-Bench score of 7.64, which outperforms all 7B... | Jianshang Kou, Benfeng Xu, Chiwei Zhu, Zhendong Mao |  |

For LLMs to be applied reliably, it is essential to have an accurate measure of their confidence. Currently, the most commonly used confidence score function is the likelihood of the generated sequence, which, however, conflates semantic and syntactic components. For instance, in question-answering (QA) tasks, an awkward phrasing of the correct answer might result in a lower probability prediction. Additionally, different tokens should be weighted differently depending on the context. In this work, we propose enhancing the predicted sequence probability by assigning different weights to various tokens using attention values elicited from the base LLM. By employing a validation set, we can identify the relevant attention heads, thereby significantly improving the reliability of the vanilla sequence probability confidence measure. We refer to this new... | Zhen Lin, Shubhendu Trivedi, Jimeng Sun |  |

However, deep learning models are data-driven, requiring large-scale datasets to achieve high generalizability. Inspired by how human experts leverage reasoning for medical diagnosis, we propose CARER, a novel health risk prediction framework, that enhances deep learning models with clinical rationales derived from medically proficient Large Language Models (LLMs). In addition, we provide a cross-view alignment loss which aligns the “local” view from the patient’s health status with the “global” view from the external LLM’s clinical reasoning to boost the mutual feature learning. Through extensive experiments on two predictive tasks using two popular EHR datasets, our CARER’s significantly exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art models by up to 11.2%, especially in improving data efficiency and generalizability.

However, most existing approaches rely on pre-defined personal profiles, which are not only time-consuming and labor-intensive to create but also lack flexibility. We propose In-Dialogue Learning (IDL), a fine-tuning framework that enhances the ability of pre-trained large language models to leverage dialogue history to characterize persona for personalized dialogue generation tasks without pre-defined profiles. Our experiments on three datasets demonstrate that IDL brings substantial improvements, with BLEU and ROUGE scores increasing by up to 200% and 247%, respectively. Additionally, the results of human evaluations further validate the efficacy of our proposed method. | Chuanqi Cheng, Quan Tu, Wei Wu, Shuo Shang, Cunli Mao, Zhengtao Yu, Rui Yan |  |

Revisit Monosemanticity from a Feature Decorrelation Perspective](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.582) |  | 0 | To better interpret the intrinsic mechanism of large language models (LLMs), recent studies focus on monosemanticity on its basic units. A monosemantic neuron is dedicated to a single and specific concept, which forms a one-to-one correlation between neurons and concepts. Despite extensive research in monosemanticity probing, it remains unclear whether monosemanticity is beneficial or harmful to model capacity. To explore this question, we revisit monosemanticity from the feature decorrelation perspective and advocate for its encouragement. We experimentally observe that the current conclusion by (CITATION), which suggests that decreasing monosemanticity enhances model performance, does not hold when the model changes. Instead, we demonstrate that monosemanticity consistently exhibits a positive correlation with model capacity, in the preference alignment process. Consequently, we apply feature correlation as a proxy for monosemanticity and incorporate a feature decorrelation... | Hanqi Yan, Yanzheng Xiang, Guangyi Chen, Yifei Wang, Lin Gui, Yulan He |  |

However, prior calibration methods, such as self-consistency-based and logit-based approaches, are either limited in inference-time efficiency or fall short of providing informative signals. Moreover, simply filtering out low-confidence responses reduces the LM’s helpfulness when the answers are correct. Therefore, effectively using calibration techniques to enhance an LM’s factuality remains an unsolved challenge. In this paper, we first propose an activation-based calibration method, ActCab, which trains a linear layer on top of the LM’s last-layer activations that can better capture the representations of knowledge. Built on top of ActCab, we further propose CoDec, a confidence-guided decoding strategy to elicit truthful answers with high confidence from LMs. By evaluating on five... | Xin Liu, Farima Fatahi Bayat, Lu Wang |  |

A critical aspect of this advancement is the alignment process, which ensures that these models perform tasks in ways that align with human values and expectations. Current alignment methods, such as direct preference optimization (DPO) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), focus primarily on alignment during training phase. However, these methods often involve complex and resource-intensive training processes, posing significant challenge for their implementation. Therefore, we propose InferAligner, a simple yet effective method for harmlessness alignment during inference phase. InferAligner decouples harmlessness from helpfulness. During the training phase, it focuses solely on enhancing the target model’s capabilities on downstream tasks. In the inference phase, it utilizes safety steering vectors extracted... | Pengyu Wang, Dong Zhang, Linyang Li, Chenkun Tan, Xinghao Wang, Mozhi Zhang, Ke Ren, Botian Jiang, Xipeng Qiu |  |

Real-world scenarios often involve incomplete or evolving data. In response, individuals update their beliefs and understandings accordingly. However, most existing evaluations assume that language models (LMs) operate with consistent information. We introduce Belief-R, a new dataset designed to test LMs’ belief revision ability when presented with new evidence. Inspired by how humans suppress prior inferences, this task assesses LMs within the newly proposed delta reasoning (𝛥 R) framework. Belief-R features sequences of premises designed to simulate scenarios where additional information could necessitate prior conclusions drawn by LMs. We evaluate ~30 LMs across diverse prompting strategies and found that LMs generally struggle to appropriately revise their beliefs in response to new information. Further, models adept at updating often underperformed in scenarios without necessary updates, highlighting a... | Bryan Wilie, Samuel Cahyawijaya, Etsuko Ishii, Junxian He, Pascale Fung |  |

While LLMs correspond to huge size, the scale of the training data significantly increases, which leads to tremendous amounts of computation and communication costs. The training data is generally non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID), which requires adaptive data processing within each device. Although Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can significantly reduce the scale of parameters to update in the fine-tuning process, it still takes unaffordable time to transfer the low-rank parameters of all the layers in LLMs. In this paper, we propose a Fisher Information-based Efficient Curriculum Federated Learning framework (FibecFed) with two novel methods, i.e., adaptive federated curriculum learning and efficient sparse parameter update. First, we propose a fisher information-based method to adaptively sample data... | Ji Liu, Jiaxiang Ren, Ruoming Jin, Zijie Zhang, Yang Zhou, Patrick Valduriez, Dejing Dou |  |

This task involves two components: biomedical entity identification (Named Entity Recognition, NER) and their interrelation determination (Relation Extraction, RE). However, existing methods often neglect unique features of the biomedical literature, such as ambiguous entities, nested proper nouns, and overlapping relation triplets, and underutilize prior knowledge, leading to an intolerable performance decline in the biomedical domain, especially with limited annotated training data. In this paper, we propose the Biomedical Relation-First eXtraction (Bio-RFX) model by leveraging sentence-level relation classification before entity extraction to tackle entity ambiguity. Moreover, we exploit structural constraints between entities and relations to guide the model’s hypothesis space, enhancing extraction performance across different training scenarios.

Existing approaches often directly apply LLMs’ original decoding methods. However, we find these methods encounter significant challenges: 1) amplification bias—where standard length normalization inflates scores for items containing tokens with generation probabilities close to 1 (termed ghost tokens), and 2) homogeneity issue—generating multiple similar or repetitive items for a user. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a new decoding approach named Debiasing-Diversifying Decoding (D3). D3 disables length normalization for ghost tokens to alleviate amplification bias, and it incorporates a text-free assistant model to encourage tokens less frequently generated by LLMs for counteracting recommendation homogeneity. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the method’s... | Keqin Bao, Jizhi Zhang, Yang Zhang, Xinyue Huo, Chong Chen, Fuli Feng |  |

However, it is unclear if this success is limited to explicitly-mentioned causal facts in the pretraining data which the model can memorize. Thus, this work investigates: Can LLMs infer causal relations from other relational data in text? To disentangle the role of memorized causal facts vs inferred causal relations, we finetune LLMs on synthetic data containing temporal, spatial and counterfactual relations, and measure whether the LLM can then infer causal relations. We find that: (a) LLMs are susceptible to inferring causal relations from the order of two entity mentions in text (e.g. X mentioned before Y implies X causes Y); (b) if the order is randomized, LLMs still suffer from the post hoc fallacy, i.e. X occurs before Y (temporal relation) implies X causes Y. We also find that while LLMs can correctly deduce the... | Nitish Joshi, Abulhair Saparov, Yixin Wang, He He |  |

However, simulating sensitive interactions, such as in the domain of mental health, is challenging. Privacy concerns restrict data access, and collecting expert feedback, although vital, is laborious. To address this, we develop Roleplay-doh, a novel human-LLM collaboration pipeline that elicits qualitative feedback from a domain-expert, which is transformed into a set of principles, or natural language rules, that govern an LLM-prompted roleplay. We apply this pipeline to enable senior mental health supporters to create customized AI patients as simulated practice partners for novice counselors. After uncovering issues with basic GPT-4 simulations not adhering to expert-defined principles, we also introduce a novel principle-adherence prompting pipeline which shows a 30% improvement in response quality and principle following for the downstream task.

However, there is a notable lack of resources to assess the impact of this language shift on language models (LMs) might not been trained on examples of this variation. Addressing this gap, we present Lou, the first dataset providing high-quality reformulations for German text classification covering seven tasks, like stance detection and toxicity classification. We evaluate 16 mono- and multi-lingual LMs and find substantial label flips, reduced prediction certainty, and significantly altered attention patterns. However, existing evaluations remain valid, as LM rankings are consistent across original and reformulated instances. Our study provides initial insights into the impact of gender-fair language on classification for German. However, these findings are likely transferable to other languages, as we found consistent patterns in multi-lingual and... | Andreas Waldis, Joel Birrer, Anne Lauscher, Iryna Gurevych |  |

This study introduces a unified framework named SLGAN, which harnesses the capabilities of Generative Adversarial Networks to address the challenges associated with Sequence Labeling tasks. SLGAN not only mitigates the limitation of GANs in backpropagating loss to discrete data but also exhibits strong adaptability to various sequence labeling tasks. Unlike traditional GANs, the discriminator within SLGAN does not discriminate whether data originates from the discriminator or the generator; instead, it focuses on predicting the correctness of each tag within the tag sequence. We conducted evaluations on six different tasks spanning four languages, including Chinese, Japanese, and Korean Word Segmentation, Chinese and English Named Entity Recognition, and Chinese Part-of-Speech Tagging. Our experimental results illustrate that SLGAN represents a versatile and highly effective solution,... | Yu Tong, Ge Chen, Guokai Zheng, Rui Li, Jiang Dazhi |  |

Existing methods, like concatenation or free-form textual conversion of triples, have limitations, including duplicated entities or relations, reduced evidence density, and failure to highlight crucial evidence. To address these issues, we propose EFSum, an Evidence-focused Fact Summarization framework for enhanced QA with knowledge-augmented LLMs. We optimize an LLM as a fact summarizer through distillation and preference alignment. Our extensive expeirments show that EFSum improves LLM’s zero-shot QA performance with its helpful and faithful summaries, especially when noisy facts are retrieved. | Sungho Ko, Hyunjin Cho, Hyungjoo Chae, Jinyoung Yeo, Dongha Lee |  |

To better align language models with the speech domain, we explore i) prompting strategies based on radio-industry best practices and ii) preference learning using a novel speech-based preference data of 20K samples collected by annotators who listen to response pairs. Both human and automatic evaluation show that both prompting and preference learning increase the speech-suitability of popular instruction tuned LLMs. More interestingly, we show that these methods are additive; combining them achieves the best win rates in head-to-head comparison, resulting in responses that are preferred or tied to the base model in 76.2% of comparisons on average. Lastly, we share lexical, syntactical, and qualitative analyses that elicit how our studied methods differ with baselines in generating more... | Hyundong Cho, Nicolaas Paul Jedema, Leonardo F. R.

However, model developers fail to disclose their construction methodology which has lead to a lack of open information on how to develop effective pretraining sets. To address this issue, we perform the first systematic study across the entire pipeline of pretraining set construction. First, we run ablations on existing techniques for pretraining set development to identify which methods translate to the largest gains in model accuracy on downstream evaluations. Then, we categorize the most widely used data source, web crawl snapshots, across the attributes of toxicity, quality, type of speech, and domain. Finally, we show how such attribute information can be used to further refine and improve the quality of a pretraining set. These findings constitute an actionable set of steps that practitioners can use to develop high quality... | Jupinder Parmar, Shrimai Prabhumoye, Joseph Jennings, Bo Liu, Aastha Jhunjhunwala, Zhilin Wang, Mostofa Patwary, Mohammad Shoeybi, Bryan Catanzaro |  |

These compound systems often lack intermediate labels or gradient flow to optimize each module, making their end-to-end optimization challenging. Here we seek strategies to optimize both the module-level LM weights and the associated prompt templates of such systems to maximize a downstream task metric. We propose for the first time combining the weight and prompt optimization strategies to optimize a modular LM pipeline by alternating between the two to get the same LM to teach itself. In experiments with multi-hop QA, mathematical reasoning, and feature-based classification using mistral-7b, llama-2-7b, and llama-3-8b, these BetterTogether strategies optimizing the weights and prompts of a pipeline together outperform directly... | Dilara Soylu, Christopher Potts, Omar Khattab |  |

Much prior work has studied such verbatim memorization using observational data. To complement such work, we develop a framework to study verbatim memorization in a controlled setting by continuing pre-training from Pythia checkpoints with injected sequences. We find that (1) non-trivial amounts of repetition are necessary for verbatim memorization to happen; (2) later (and presumably better) checkpoints are more likely to verbatim memorize sequences, even for out-of-distribution sequences; (3) the generation of memorized sequences is triggered by distributed model states that encode high-level features and makes important use of general language modeling capabilities. Guided by these insights, we develop stress tests to evaluate unlearning methods and find they often fail to remove the verbatim memorized information, while also degrading the LM. Overall, these... | Jing Huang, Diyi Yang, Christopher Potts |  |

BPE and MaxMatch, two popular subword tokenization schemes, have stochastic dropout regularization variants. However, there has not been an analysis of the distributions formed by them.We show that these stochastic variants are heavily biased towards a small set of tokenizations per word. If the benefits of subword regularization are as mentioned, we hypothesize that biasedness artificially limits the effectiveness of these schemes. Thus, we propose an algorithm to uniformly sample tokenizations that we use as a drop-in replacement for the stochastic aspects of existing tokenizers, and find that it improves machine translation quality. | Marco Cognetta, Vilém Zouhar, Naoaki Okazaki |  |

Existing benchmarks often fall short in capturing the requisite analytical complexity for practical applications. DataTales addresses this gap by offering 4.9k financial reports paired with corresponding market data, showcasing the demand for models to create clear narratives and analyze large datasets while understanding specialized terminology in the field. Our findings highlights the significant challenge that language models face in achieving the necessary precision and analytical depth for proficient data narration, suggesting promising avenues for future model development and evaluation methodologies. | Yajing Yang, Qian Liu, MinYen Kan |  |

However, the deployment of these models is constrained by high inference time in multilingual settings. To mitigate this challenge, this paper explores a training recipe of an assistant model in speculative decoding, which are leveraged to draft and-then its future tokens are verified by the target LLM. We show that language-specific draft models, optimized through a targeted pretrain-and-finetune strategy, substantially brings a speedup of inference time compared to the previous methods. We validate these models across various languages in inference time, out-of-domain speedup, and GPT-4o evaluation. | Euiin Yi, Taehyeon Kim, Hongseok Jeung, DuSeong Chang, SeYoung Yun |  |

However, current studies often neglect such real-world scenarios as they tend to focus solely on either single-language or single-document tasks. To bridge this gap, we aim to unify Multi-lingual, Cross-lingual and Multi-document Summarization into a novel task, i.e., MCMS, which encapsulates the real-world requirements all-in-one. Nevertheless, the lack of a benchmark inhibits researchers from adequately studying this invaluable problem. To tackle this, we have meticulously constructed the GLOBESUMM dataset by first collecting a wealth of multilingual news reports and restructuring them into event-centric format. Additionally, we introduce the method of protocol-guided prompting for high-quality and cost-effective reference annotation. In MCMS, we also highlight the challenge of conflicts between news reports, in addition to the issues of... | Yangfan Ye, Xiachong Feng, Xiaocheng Feng, Weitao Ma, Libo Qin, Dongliang Xu, Qing Yang, Hongtao Liu, Bing Qin |  |

We propose Cross-lingual Expert Language Models (X-ELM), which mitigate this competition by independently training language models on subsets of the multilingual corpus. This process specializes X-ELMs to different languages while remaining effective as a multilingual ensemble. Our experiments show that when given the same compute budget, X-ELM outperforms jointly trained multilingual models across all 16 considered languages and that these gains transfer to downstream tasks. X-ELM provides additional benefits over performance improvements: new experts can be iteratively added, adapting X-ELM to new languages without catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, training is asynchronous, reducing the hardware requirements for multilingual training and democratizing multilingual modeling. | Terra Blevins, Tomasz Limisiewicz, Suchin Gururangan, Margaret Li, Hila Gonen, Noah A.

To this end, rather than being given the correct answer, students should receive elaborated feedback on how to correct a mistake on their own. Highlighting the complex demands that the generation of such feedback places on a model’s input utilization abilities, we propose two extensions to the training pipeline. Firstly, we employ a KL regularization term between a standard and enriched input format to achieve more targeted input representations. Secondly, we add a preference optimization step to encourage student answer-adaptive feedback generation. The effectiveness of those extensions is underlined by a significant increase in model performance of 3.3 METEOR points. We go beyond traditional surface form-based metrics to assess two important dimensions of feedback quality, i.e., faithfulness and informativeness. Hereby, we are the first to... | Wencke Liermann, JinXia Huang, Yohan Lee, Kong Joo Lee |  |

However, tracking pre-training stability is impractical due to high computational costs. We study Token Embedding Variability as a simple proxy to estimate pre-training stability. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that Multi-head Low-Rank Attention acts as a fundamental approach to reducing instability. This is supported by empirical findings on variants on GPT-2, demonstrating improved stability and lower perplexities, even at deeper layer counts. | Woojin Chung, Jiwoo Hong, Na Min An, James Thorne, SeYoung Yun |  |

We investigate the text normalization routine employed by leading ASR models, including OpenAI Whisper, Meta’s MMS, Seamless, and Assembly AI’s Conformer, and their unintended consequences on performance metrics. Our research reveals that current text normalization practices, while aiming to standardize ASR outputs for fair comparison, by removing inconsistencies such as variations in spelling, punctuation, and special characters, are fundamentally flawed when applied to Indic scripts. Through empirical analysis using text similarity scores and in-depth linguistic examination, we demonstrate that these flaws lead to artificially improved performance metrics for Indic languages. We conclude by proposing a shift towards developing text normalization routines that leverage native linguistic expertise, ensuring more robust and accurate... | Kavya Manohar, Leena G. Pillai |  |

The task becomes even more difficult if it also involves stance detection of retrieved arguments. In this work, we investigate the effect of TDAM dataset composition in few- and zero-shot settings. Our findings show that, while fine-tuning is mandatory to achieve acceptable model performance, using carefully composed training samples and reducing the training sample size by up to almost 90% can still yield 95% of the maximum performance. This gain is consistent across three TDAM tasks on three different datasets. We also publish a new dataset and code for future benchmarking. | Benjamin Schiller, Johannes Daxenberger, Andreas Waldis, Iryna Gurevych |  |

We developed a novel dataset of 5K fictional avatar images for assignment as visual personas to LLMs, and analyzed their negotiation behaviors based on the visual traits depicted in these images, with a particular focus on aggressiveness. The results indicate that LLMs assess the aggressiveness of images in a manner similar to humans and output more aggressive negotiation behaviors when prompted with an aggressive visual persona. Interestingly, the LLM exhibited more aggressive negotiation behaviors when the opponent’s image appeared less aggressive than their own, and less aggressive behaviors when the opponent’s image appeared more aggressive. | Seungjong Sun, Eungu Lee, Seo Yeon Baek, Seunghyun Hwang, Wonbyung Lee, Dongyan Nan, Bernard J.

RAG adopts information retrieval techniques to inject external knowledge from semantic-relevant documents as input contexts. However, due to today’s Internet being flooded with numerous noisy and fabricating content, it is inevitable that RAG systems are vulnerable to these noises and prone to respond incorrectly. To this end, we propose to optimize the retrieval-augmented Generator with a Adversarial Tuning Multi-agent system \*\*(ATM)\*\*. The ATM steers the Generator to have a robust perspective of useful documents for question answering with the help of an auxiliary Attacker agent. The Generator and the Attacker are tuned adversarially for several iterations. After rounds of multi-agent iterative tuning, the Generator can eventually better discriminate useful documents amongst fabrications.

Most existing methods predominantly leverage semantic or syntactic information based on attention scores, which are susceptible to interference caused by irrelevant contexts and often lack sentiment knowledge at a data-specific level. In this paper, we propose a novel Dynamic Multi-granularity Attribution Network (DMAN) from the perspective of attribution. Initially, we leverage Integrated Gradients to dynamically extract attribution scores for each token, which contain underlying reasoning knowledge for sentiment analysis. Subsequently, we aggregate attribution representations from multiple semantic granularities in natural language, enhancing a profound understanding of the semantics. Finally, we integrate attribution scores with syntactic information to capture the relationships between aspects and their relevant contexts more accurately during the sentence... | Yanjiang Chen, Kai Zhang, Feng Hu, Xianquan Wang, Ruikang Li, Qi Liu |  |

Numerous techniques have been proposed to mitigate these biases during both the pre-training and fine-tuning stages. However, fine-tuning a pre-trained debiased language model on a downstream task can reintroduce biases into the model. Additionally, existing debiasing methods for downstream tasks either (i) require labels of protected attributes (e.g., age, race, or political views) that are often not available or (ii) rely on indicators of bias, which restricts their applicability to gender debiasing since they rely on gender-specific words. To address this, we introduce a novel debiasing regularization technique based on the class-wise variance of embeddings. Crucially, our method does not require attribute labels and targets any attribute, thus addressing the shortcomings of existing debiasing methods. Our experiments on encoder language models and three datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms... | Shahed Masoudian, Markus Frohmann, Navid Rekabsaz, Markus Schedl |  |

Recent retrieval-augmented VQA (RA-VQA) systems address this by retrieving and integrating external knowledge sources. However, these systems still suffer from redundant visual information irrelevant to the question during retrieval. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose LLM-RA, a novel method leveraging the reasoning capability of a large language model (LLM) to identify key visual entities, thus minimizing the impact of irrelevant information in the query of retriever. Furthermore, key visual entities are independently encoded for multimodal joint retrieval, preventing cross-entity interference. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms other strong RA-VQA systems. In two knowledge-intensive VQA benchmarks, our method achieves the new state-of-the-art performance among those with similar scale of parameters and even performs... | Pu Jian, Donglei Yu, Jiajun Zhang |  |

Despite the progress made, the challenge of detecting high-risk interactions in multimodal settings, and in particular in speech modality, remains largely unexplored. Conventional research on risk for speech modality primarily emphasises the content (e.g., what is captured as transcription). However, in speech-based interactions, paralinguistic cues in audio can significantly alter the intended meaning behind utterances. In this work, we propose a speech-specific risk taxonomy, covering 8 risk categories under hostility (malicious sarcasm and threats), malicious imitation (age, gender, ethnicity), and stereotypical biases (age, gender, ethnicity).

However, generating high-quality rationales require human-annotation or the use of auxiliary proxy models. In this work, we propose Self-AMPLIFY to automatically generate rationales from post hoc explanation methods applied to Small Language Models (SLMs) to improve their own performance. Self-AMPLIFY is a 3-step method that targets samples, generates rationales and builds a final prompt to leverage ICL. Self-AMPLIFY performance is evaluated on four SLMs and five datasets requiring strong reasoning abilities. Self-AMPLIFY achieves good results against competitors, leading to strong accuracy improvement. Self-AMPLIFY is the first method to apply post hoc explanation methods to autoregressive language models to generate rationales to improve their own performance in a fully automated manner. | Milan Bhan, JeanNoël Vittaut, Nicolas Chesneau, MarieJeanne Lesot |  |

Existing methods improve the accuracy of entity retrieval and construct data flows between retrieval results and response generator, achieving promising results. However, most of them suffer from the following issues: (1) The entity is retrieved by directly interacting with the context at a coarse-grained level, so the similarity score may be disturbed by irrelevant attributes; (2) The generator pays equal attention to retrieved entities and the context and does not learn the generation preferences for the current turn. In this paper, we propose a framework called Regulating Preferences of Generator (RPG) based on retrieval results, which includes a generator preference extractor, an entity retriever, and a generator with the gate-controlled preference regulator. The generator preference extractor not only improves the... | Wanshi Xu, Xianwei Zhuang, Zhanpeng Chen, Zhihong Zhu, Xuxin Cheng, Yuexian Zou |  |

Until now, it has been largely unknown how variations in the linguistic expression of prompts affect these models. This study systematically and empirically evaluates which linguistic features influence models through paraphrase types, i.e., different linguistic changes at particular positions. We measure behavioral changes for five models across 120 tasks and six families of paraphrases (i.e., morphology, syntax, lexicon, lexico-syntax, discourse, and others). We also control for other prompt engineering factors (e.g., prompt length, lexical diversity, and proximity to training data). Our results show a potential for language models to improve tasks when their prompts are adapted in specific paraphrase types (e.g., 6.7% median gain in Mixtral 8x7B; 5.5% in LLaMA 3 8B). In particular, changes in morphology and lexicon, i.e., the vocabulary used, showed promise in improving... | Jan Philip Wahle, Terry Ruas, Yang Xu, Bela Gipp |  |

Existing metrics, such as CLIP, effectively measure the semantic alignment between single prompts and their corresponding images. However, they fall short in evaluating a model’s ability to generalize across a broad spectrum of textual inputs. To address this gap, we propose the VLEU (Visual Language Evaluation Understudy) metric. VLEU leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to sample from the visual text domain, encompassing the entire range of potential inputs for the T2I task, to generate a wide variety of visual text. The images generated by T2I models from these prompts are then assessed for their alignment with the input text using the CLIP model. VLEU quantitatively measures a model’s generalizability by computing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the visual text marginal distribution and the conditional distribution over the images... | Jingtao Cao, Zhang Zheng, Hongru Wang, KamFai Wong |  |

Numerous previous studies have trained their models using the connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss. During inference, these CTC-based models generally require the entire sign video as input to make predictions, a process known as offline recognition, which suffers from high latency and substantial memory usage. In this work, we take the first step towards online CSLR. Our approach consists of three phases: 1) developing a sign dictionary; 2) training an isolated sign language recognition model on the dictionary; and 3) employing a sliding window approach on the input sign sequence, feeding each sign clip to the optimized model for online recognition. Additionally, our online recognition model can be extended to support online translation by integrating a gloss-to-text network and can enhance the performance of any offline model.

Most existing extrinsic debiasing methods rely on manually curated word lists for each sensitive groups to modify training data or to add regular constraints. However, these word lists are often limited by length and scope, resulting in the degradation performance of extrinsic bias mitigation. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a \*\*C\*\*ontinuous \*\*P\*\*rompts \*\*A\*\*djustment \*\*D\*\*ebiasing method (CPAD), which generates continuous token lists from the entire vocabulary space and uses them to bridge the gap between outputs and targets in fairness learning process. Specifically, CPAD encapsulates fine-tuning objective and debiasing objectives into several independent prompts. To avoid the limitation of manual word lists, in fairness learning phase, we extract outputs from the entire vocabulary space via fine-tuned... | Yiwei Dai, Hengrui Gu, Ying Wang, Xin Wang |  |

However, LLM-based evaluators exhibit position bias, or inconsistency, when used to evaluate candidate answers in pairwise comparisons, favoring either the first or second answer regardless of content. To address this limitation, we propose PORTIA, an alignment-based system designed to mimic human comparison strategies to calibrate position bias in a lightweight yet effective manner. Specifically, PORTIA splits the answers into multiple segments, taking into account both length and semantics, and merges them back into a single prompt for evaluation by LLMs. Extensive experiments with six LLMs on 11,520 answer pairs demonstrate that PORTIA markedly enhances the consistency rates for all models and forms of comparison tested, achieving an average relative improvement of 47.46%. It also enables PORTIA-enhanced GPT-3.5 to achieve agreement rates with humans... | Zongjie Li, Chaozheng Wang, Pingchuan Ma, Daoyuan Wu, Shuai Wang, Cuiyun Gao, Yang Liu |  |

While detection methods exist, current reactive approaches, like content flagging and banning, are short-term and insufficient. Additionally, advancements like large language models (LLMs) exacerbate the issue by enabling large-scale creation and dissemination of misinformation. Thus, sustainable, scalable solutions that encourage behavior change and broaden perspectives by persuading misinformants against their viewpoints or broadening their perspectives are needed. To this end, we propose persuasive LLM-based dialogue systems to tackle misinformation. However, challenges arise due to the lack of suitable datasets and formal frameworks for generating persuasive responses. Inspired by existing methods for countering online hate speech, we explore adapting counter-hate response strategies for misinformation. Since misinformation and hate speech often... | Sougata Saha, Rohini K. Srihari |  |

While recent studies indicate that existing offline DAP methods can directly benefit from online training samples, we highlight the need to develop specific online DAP algorithms to fully harness the power of online training. Specifically, we identify that the learned LLM should adhere to the proximity of the behavior LLM, which collects the training samples. To this end, we propose online Preference Optimization in proximity to the Behavior LLM (BPO), emphasizing the importance of constructing a proper trust region for LLM alignment.We conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness and applicability of our approach by integrating it with various DAP methods, resulting in significant performance improvements across a wide range of tasks when training with the same amount of preference... | Wenda Xu, Jiachen Li, William Yang Wang, Lei Li |  |

The dominant paradigms in KPG include one2seq and one2set. Recently, there has been increasing interest in applying large language models (LLMs) to KPG. Our preliminary experiments reveal that it is challenging for a single model to excel in both recall and precision. Further analysis shows that: 1) the one2set paradigm owns the advantage of high recall, but suffers from improper assignments of supervision signals during training; 2) LLMs are powerful in keyphrase selection, but existing selection methods often make redundant selections. Given these observations, we introduce a generate-then-select framework decomposing KPG into two steps, where we adopt a one2set-based model as generator to produce candidates and then use an LLM as selector to select keyphrases from these candidates. Particularly, we make two important improvements on our generator and... | Liangying Shao, Liang Zhang, Minlong Peng, Guoqi Ma, Hao Yue, Mingming Sun, Jinsong Su |  |

Product-related question answering (PQA) entails utilizing product-related resources to provide precise responses to users. We propose a novel task of Multilingual Cross-market Product-based Question Answering (MCPQA) and define the task as providing answers to product-related questions in a main marketplace by utilizing information from another resource-rich auxiliary marketplace in a multilingual context. We introduce a large-scale dataset comprising over 7 million questions from 17 marketplaces across 11 languages. We then perform automatic translation on the Electronics category of our dataset, naming it as McMarket. We focus on two subtasks: review-based answer generation and product-related question ranking. For each subtask, we label a subset of McMarket using an LLM and further evaluate the quality of the annotations via human assessment. We then conduct experiments to... | Yifei Yuan, Yang Deng, Anders Søgaard, Mohammad Aliannejadi |  |

In this paper, we revisit SFT in the context of preference alignment, emphasizing that a minor penalty for the disfavored style is sufficient for preference alignment. Building on this foundation, we introduce a straightforward reference model-free monolithic odds ratio preference optimization algorithm, ORPO, eliminating the need for an additional preference alignment phase. We demonstrate, both empirically and theoretically, that the odds ratio is a sensible choice for contrasting favored and disfavored styles during SFT across diverse sizes from 125M to 7B. Specifically, fine-tuning Phi-2 (2.7B), Llama-2 (7B), and Mistral (7B) with ORPO on the UltraFeedback alone surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art language models including Llama-2 Chat and Zephyr with more than 7B and 13B parameters:... | Jiwoo Hong, Noah Lee, James Thorne |  |

A Diagnostic Approach to Addressee Recognition and Response Selection in Conversations](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.628) |  | 0 | Assessing the performance of systems to classify Multi-Party Conversations (MPC) is challenging due to the interconnection between linguistic and structural characteristics of conversations. Conventional evaluation methods often overlook variances in model behavior across different levels of structural complexity on interaction graphs. In this work, we propose a methodological pipeline to investigate model performance across specific structural attributes of conversations. As a proof of concept we focus on Response Selection and Addressee Recognition tasks, to diagnose model weaknesses. To this end, we extract representative diagnostic subdatasets with a fixed number of users and a good structural variety from a large and open corpus of online MPCs. We further frame our work in terms of data minimization, avoiding the use of original usernames to preserve privacy, and propose alternatives to using original text messages.

Recent prompting techniques, such as chain of thought, have consistently improved LLMs’ performance on various reasoning tasks. Nevertheless, there is still little understanding of what triggers reasoning abilities in LLMs in the inference stage. In this paper, we investigate the effect of the input representation on the reasoning abilities of LLMs. We hypothesize that representing natural language tasks as code can enhance specific reasoning abilities such as entity tracking or logical reasoning. To study this, we propose code prompting, a methodology we operationalize as a chain of prompts that transforms a natural language problem into code and directly prompts the LLM using the generated code without resorting to external code execution. We find that code prompting exhibits a high-performance boost for multiple LLMs (up to 22.52 percentage points on GPT 3.5, 7.75 on Mixtral, and 16.78 on Mistral) across multiple... | Haritz Puerto, Martin Tutek, Somak Aditya, Xiaodan Zhu, Iryna Gurevych |  |

A common solution consists on pretraining the encoder on automatic speech recognition, hence losing efficiency in the training process. In this study, we compare the training dynamics of a system using a pretrained encoder, the conventional approach, and one trained from scratch. We observe that, throughout the training, the randomly initialized model struggles to incorporate information from the speech inputs for its predictions. Hence, we hypothesize that this issue stems from the difficulty of effectively training an encoder for direct speech translation. While a model trained from scratch needs to learn acoustic and semantic modeling simultaneously, a pretrained one can just focus on the latter. Based on these findings, we propose a subtle change in the decoder cross-attention to integrate source information from earlier steps in training. We show that with this change, the model trained... | Belen Alastruey, Gerard I. Gállego, Marta R. Costajussà |  |

However, traditional CQG, focusing primarily on the immediate context, lacks the conversational foresight necessary to guide conversations toward specified conclusions. This limitation significantly restricts their ability to achieve conclusion-oriented conversational outcomes. In this work, we redefine the CQG task as Conclusion-driven Conversational Question Generation (CCQG) by focusing on proactivity, not merely reacting to the unfolding conversation but actively steering it towards a conclusion-oriented question-answer pair. To address this, we propose a novel approach, called Proactive Conversational Question Planning with self-Refining (PCQPR). Concretely, by integrating a planning algorithm inspired by Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with the analytical capabilities of large language models (LLMs),... | Shasha Guo, Lizi Liao, Jing Zhang, Cuiping Li, Hong Chen |  |

Unfortunately, while crucial, Code review is a labor-intensive process that the research community is looking to automate. Existing automated methods rely on single input-output generative models and thus generally struggle to emulate the collaborative nature of code review. This work introduces CodeAgent, a novel multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) system for code review automation. CodeAgent incorporates a supervisory agent, QA-Checker, to ensure that all the agents’ contributions address the initial review question. We evaluated CodeAgent on critical code review tasks: (1) detect inconsistencies between code changes and commit messages, (2) identify vulnerability introductions, (3) validate code style adherence, and (4) suggest code revisions.

Along with scaling them up directly, these models enable LLVMs to showcase powerful vision language (VL) performances by covering diverse tasks via natural language instructions. However, existing open-source LLVMs that perform comparably to closed-source LLVMs such as GPT-4V are often considered too large (e.g., 26B, 34B, and 110B parameters), having a larger number of layers. These large models demand costly, high-end resources for both training and inference. To address this issue, we present a new efficient LLVM family with 1.8B, 3.8B, and 7B LLM model sizes, Traversal of Layers (TroL), which enables the reuse of layers in a token-wise manner. This layer traversing technique simulates the effect of looking back and retracing the answering stream while increasing the number of forward propagation layers without physically... | ByungKwan Lee, Sangyun Chung, Chae Won Kim, Beomchan Park, Yong Man Ro |  |

However, these mainstream evaluation methods mainly focus on fluency and factual reliability, whilst paying little attention to figurative quality. In this paper, we investigate the figurative quality of MT and propose a set of human evaluation metrics focused on the translation of figurative language. We additionally present a multilingual parallel metaphor corpus generated by post-editing. Our evaluation protocol is designed to estimate four aspects of MT: Metaphorical Equivalence, Emotion, Authenticity, and Quality. In doing so, we observe that translations of figurative expressions display different traits from literal ones. | Shun Wang, Ge Zhang, Han Wu, Tyler Loakman, Wenhao Huang, Chenghua Lin |  |

HPSG treebanks are produced automatically by large manually built grammars and feature high-quality annotation based on a well-developed linguistic theory. The English Resource Grammar treebanks include diverse and challenging test datasets, beyond the usual WSJ section 23 and Wikipedia data. HPSG supertagging has previously relied on MaxEnt-based models. We use SVM and neural CRF- and BERT-based methods and show that both SVM and neural supertaggers achieve considerably higher accuracy compared to the baseline and lead to an increase not only in the parsing speed but also the parser accuracy with respect to gold dependency structures. Our fine-tuned BERT-based tagger achieves 97.26% accuracy on 950 sentences from WSJ23 and 93.88% on the out-of-domain technical essay The Cathedral and the Bazaar.

The key to a retrieval system is to calculate relevance scores to query and passage pairs. However, the definition of relevance is often ambiguous. We observed that a major class of relevance aligns with the concept of entailment in NLI tasks. Based on this observation, we designed a method called entailment tuning to improve the embedding of dense retrievers. Specifically, we unify the form of retrieval data and NLI data using existence claim as a bridge. Then, we train retrievers to predict the claims entailed in a passage with a variant task of masked prediction. Our method can be efficiently plugged into current dense retrieval methods, and experiments show the effectiveness of our method. | Lu Dai, Hao Liu, Hui Xiong |  |

Due to the lack of benchmarks, the community has yet to fully understand the hallucination issues within these models. To address this challenge, we introduce a comprehensive diagnostic benchmark, ToolBH. Specifically, we assess the LLM’s hallucinations through two perspectives: depth and breadth. In terms of depth, we propose a multi-level diagnostic process, including (1) solvability detection, (2) solution planning, and (3) missing-tool analysis. For breadth, we consider three scenarios based on the characteristics of the toolset: missing necessary tools, potential tools, and limited functionality tools. Furthermore, we developed seven tasks and collected 700 evaluation samples through multiple rounds of manual annotation. The results show the significant challenges presented by the ToolBH benchmark.

We introduce an algorithm, the Token Embedding Mapping Algorithm (TEMA), that maps the token embeddings of a richly pre-trained model L1 to a poorly trained model L2, thus creating a richer L2’ model. Our experiments show that the L2’ model reduces perplexity with respect to the original monolingual model L2, and that for downstream tasks, including SuperGLUE, the results are state-of-the-art or better for the most semantic tasks. The models obtained with TEMA are also competitive or better than multilingual or extended models proposed as solutions for mitigating the low-resource language problems. | Rodolfo Zevallos, Núria Bel, Mireia Farrús |  |

Existing automated writing evaluation systems primarily use basic surface linguistic features to detect coherence in writing. However, little effort has been made to correct the detected incoherence, which could significantly benefit L2 language learners seeking to improve their writing. To bridge this gap, we introduce DECOR, a novel benchmark that includes expert annotations for detecting incoherence in L2 English writing, identifying the underlying reasons, and rewriting the incoherent sentences. To our knowledge, DECOR is the first coherence assessment dataset specifically designed for improving L2 English writing, featuring pairs of original incoherent sentences alongside their expert-rewritten counterparts. Additionally, we fine-tuned models to automatically detect and rewrite incoherence in student essays. We find that incorporating specific reasons for... | Xuanming Zhang, Anthony Diaz, Zixun Chen, Qingyang Wu, Kun Qian, Erik Voss, Zhou Yu |  |

However, LLMs face challenges in visualizing complex, real-world data through charts and plots. Firstly, existing datasets rarely cover a full range of chart types, such as 3D, volumetric, and gridded charts. Secondly, supervised fine-tuning methods do not fully leverage the intricate relationships within rich datasets, including text, code, and figures. To address these challenges, we propose a hierarchical pipeline and a new dataset for chart generation. Our dataset, Text2Chart31, includes 31 unique plot types referring to the Matplotlib library, with 11.1K tuples of descriptions, code, data tables, and plots. Moreover, we introduce a reinforcement learning-based instruction tuning technique for chart generation tasks without requiring human feedback.

Large Scale Prompt Exploration of Open Source LLMs for Machine Translation and Summarization Evaluation](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.641) |  | 0 | Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized NLP research. Notably, in-context learning enables their use as evaluation metrics for natural language generation, making them particularly advantageous in low-resource scenarios and time-restricted applications. In this work, we introduce PrExMe, a large-scale Prompt Exploration for Metrics, where we evaluate more than 720 prompt templates for open-source LLM-based metrics on machine translation (MT) and summarization datasets, totalling over 6.6M evaluations. This extensive comparison (1) benchmarks recent open-source LLMs as metrics and (2) explores the stability and variability of different prompting strategies. We discover that, on the one hand, there are scenarios for which prompts are stable. For instance, some LLMs show idiosyncratic preferences and favor to grade generated texts with textual labels while others prefer to return numeric scores. On the other hand, the stability of prompts and model rankings can be susceptible to... | Christoph Leiter, Steffen Eger |  |

Despite being widely applied, in-context learning is vulnerable to malicious attacks. In this work, we raise security concerns regarding this paradigm. Our studies demonstrate that an attacker can manipulate the behavior of large language models by poisoning the demonstration context, without the need for fine-tuning the model. Specifically, we design a new backdoor attack method, named ICLAttack, to target large language models based on in-context learning. Our method encompasses two types of attacks: poisoning demonstration examples and poisoning demonstration prompts, which can make models behave in alignment with predefined intentions. ICLAttack does not require additional fine-tuning to implant a backdoor, thus preserving the model’s generality. Furthermore, the poisoned examples are correctly labeled,... | Shuai Zhao, Meihuizi Jia, Anh Tuan Luu, Fengjun Pan, Jinming Wen |  |

The ability to process and respond appropriately to such repair sequences is thus crucial in conversational AI systems. In this paper, we first collect, analyse, and publicly release BlockWorld-Repairs: a dataset of multi-modal TPR sequences in an instruction-following manipulation task that is, by design, rife with referential ambiguity. We employ this dataset to evaluate several state-of-the-art Vision and Language Models (VLM) across multiple settings, focusing on their capability to process and accurately respond to TPRs and thus recover from miscommunication. We find that, compared to humans, all models significantly underperform in this task. We then show that VLMs can benefit from specialised losses targeting relevant tokens during fine-tuning, achieving better performance and... | Francisco Javier Chiyah Garcia, Alessandro Suglia, Arash Eshghi |  |

Traditional turn-based chat systems driven by LLMs prevent users from verbally interacting with the system while generating responses.To overcome these limitations, we adapt existing LLMs to duplex models so that they can listen to users while generating output and dynamically adjust themselves to provide instant feedback.Specifically, we divide the queries and responses of conversations into several time slices and then adopt a time-division-multiplexing (TDM) encoding-decoding strategy to process these slices pseudo-simultaneously.Furthermore, to make LLMs proficient enough to handle real-time conversations, we build a fine-tuning dataset consisting of alternating time slices of queries and responses and covering typical feedback types in instantaneous interactions.Our experiments show that although the queries and responses of... | Xinrong Zhang, Yingfa Chen, Shengding Hu, Xu Han, Zihang Xu, Yuanwei Xu, Weilin Zhao, Maosong Sun, Zhiyuan Liu |  |

While Transformers are highly versatile and powerful, they can still benefit from enhanced structural inductive biases for seq2seq tasks, especially those involving syntactic transformations, such as converting active to passive voice or semantic parsing. In this paper, we propose to strengthen the structural inductive bias of a Transformer by intermediate pre-training to perform synthetically generated syntactic transformations of dependency trees given a description of the transformation. Our experiments confirm that this helps with few-shot learning of syntactic tasks such as chunking, and also improves structural generalization for semantic parsing. Our analysis shows that the intermediate pre-training leads to attention heads that keep track of which syntactic transformation needs to be applied to which token, and that the... | Matthias Lindemann, Alexander Koller, Ivan Titov |  |

This survey leverages a unique taxonomy—dividing puzzles into rule-based and rule-less categories—to critically assess LLMs through various methodologies, including prompting techniques, neuro-symbolic approaches, and fine-tuning. Through a critical review of relevant datasets and benchmarks, we assess LLMs’ performance, identifying significant challenges in complex puzzle scenarios. Our findings highlight the disparity between LLM capabilities and human-like reasoning, particularly in those requiring advanced logical inference. The survey underscores the necessity for novel strategies and richer datasets to advance LLMs’ puzzle-solving proficiency and contribute to AI’s logical reasoning and creative problem-solving advancements. | Panagiotis Giadikiaroglou, Maria Lymperaiou, Giorgos Filandrianos, Giorgos Stamou |  |

One common use of LLMs is performing tasks on scientific topics, such as writing algorithms, querying databases or giving mathematical proofs. Inspired by the way university students are evaluated on such tasks, in this paper, we propose SciEx - a benchmark consisting of university computer science exam questions, to evaluate LLMs’ ability on solving scientific tasks. SciEx is (1) multilingual, containing both English and German exams, and (2) multi-modal, containing questions that involve images, and (3) contains various types of freeform questions with different difficulty levels, due to the nature of university exams. We evaluate the performance of various state-of-the-art LLMs on our new benchmark. Since SciEx questions are freeform, it is not straightforward to evaluate LLM performance. Therefore, we provide human expert grading... | Tu Anh Dinh, Carlos Mullov, Leonard Bärmann, Zhaolin Li, Danni Liu, Simon Reiß, Jueun Lee, Nathan Lerzer, Jianfeng Gao, Fabian PellerKonrad, Tobias Röddiger, Alexander Waibel, Tamim Asfour, Michael Beigl, Rainer Stiefelhagen, Carsten Dachsbacher, Klemens Böhm, Jan Niehues |  |

To mitigate this issue, this study explores a novel contradictory dialogue processing task that aims to detect and modify contradictory statements in a conversation. This task is inspired by research on context faithfulness and dialogue comprehension, which have demonstrated that the detection and understanding of contradictions often necessitate detailed explanations. We develop a dataset comprising contradictory dialogues, in which one side of the conversation contradicts itself. Each dialogue is accompanied by an explanatory label that highlights the location and details of the contradiction. With this dataset, we present a Red Teaming framework for contradictory dialogue processing. The framework detects and attempts to explain the dialogue, then modifies the existing contradictory content using the explanation. Our experiments demonstrate that the framework improves the ability to detect... | Xiaofei Wen, Bangzheng Li, Tenghao Huang, Muhao Chen |  |

Although such ‘glitch tokens’, tokens present in the tokenizer vocabulary but that are nearly or entirely absent during model training, have been observed across various models, a reliable method to identify and address them has been missing. We present a comprehensive analysis of Large Language Model tokenizers, specifically targeting this issue of detecting under-trained tokens. Through a combination of tokenizer analysis, model weight-based indicators, and prompting techniques, we develop novel and effective methods for automatically detecting these problematic tokens. Our findings demonstrate the prevalence of such tokens across a diverse set of models and provide insights into improving the efficiency and safety of language models. | Sander Land, Max Bartolo |  |

A Diagnostic Study of Transitive Reasoning in LLMs](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.650) |  | 0 | Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) on reasoning benchmarks demonstrates their ability to solve compositional questions. However, little is known of whether these models engage in genuine logical reasoning or simply rely on implicit cues to generate answers. In this paper, we investigate the transitive reasoning capabilities of two distinct LLM architectures, LLaMA 2 and Flan-T5, by manipulating facts within two compositional datasets: QASC and Bamboogle. We controlled for potential cues that might influence the models’ performance, including (a) word/phrase overlaps across sections of test input; (b) models’ inherent knowledge during pre-training or fine-tuning; and (c) Named Entities. Our findings reveal that while both models leverage (a), Flan-T5 shows more resilience to experiments (b and c), having less variance than LLaMA 2. This suggests that models may develop an understanding of transitivity through fine-tuning on knowingly relevant datasets, a hypothesis we leave to... | Houman Mehrafarin, Arash Eshghi, Ioannis Konstas |  |

We argue that this is not the case. Starting out with countering the arguments of Bender and Koller (2020), we trace the origins of the SGP to the computational theory of mind (CTM), and we show that it only arises with natural language when questionable theories of meaning are presupposed. We conclude by showing that it would apply to LLMs only if they were interpreted in the manner of how the CTM conceives the mind, i.e., by postulating that LLMs rely on a version of a language of thought, or by adopting said questionable theories of meaning; since neither option is rational, we conclude that the SGP does not apply to LLMs. | Reto Gubelmann |  |

Prior work has identified annotation differences, especially for mention detection, as one of the main reasons for the generalization gap and proposed using additional annotated target domain data. Rather than relying on this additional annotation, we propose an alternative referential task, Major Entity Identification (MEI), where we: (a) assume the target entities to be specified in the input, and (b) limit the task to only the frequent entities. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MEI models generalize well across domains on multiple datasets with supervised models and LLM-based few-shot prompting. Additionally, MEI fits the classification framework, which enables the use of robust and intuitive classification-based metrics. Finally, MEI is also of practical use as it allows a user to search for all mentions of a particular entity or a group... | Kawshik Sundar, Shubham Toshniwal, Makarand Tapaswi, Vineet Gandhi |  |

However, existing approaches either disregard or ineffectively model the user-item high-order interactions. To this end, this paper presents an enhanced LLM-based recommender (ELMRec). We enhance whole-word embeddings to substantially enhance LLMs’ interpretation of graph-constructed interactions for recommendations, without requiring graph pre-training. This finding may inspire endeavors to incorporate rich knowledge graphs into LLM-based recommenders via whole-word embedding. We also found that LLMs often recommend items based on users’ earlier interactions rather than recent ones, and present a reranking solution. Our ELMRec outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, especially achieving a 124.3% to 293.7% improvement over SOTA LLM-based methods in direct recommendations. Our code is available online. | Xinfeng Wang, Jin Cui, Fumiyo Fukumoto, Yoshimi Suzuki |  |

Language Models Are Capable of Probabilistic Reasoning](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.654) |  | 0 | Language models (LM) are capable of remarkably complex linguistic tasks; however, numerical reasoning is an area in which they frequently struggle. An important but rarely evaluated form of reasoning is understanding probability distributions. In this paper, we focus on evaluating the probabilistic reasoning capabilities of LMs using idealized and real-world statistical distributions. We perform a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art LMs on three tasks: estimating percentiles, drawing samples, and calculating probabilities. We evaluate three ways to provide context to LMs 1) anchoring examples from within a distribution or family of distributions, 2) real-world context, 3) summary statistics on which to base a Normal approximation. Models can make inferences about distributions, and can be further aided by the incorporation of real-world context, example shots and simplified assumptions, even if these assumptions are incorrect or misspecified. To conduct this work, we developed a... | Akshay Paruchuri, Jake Garrison, Shun Liao, John Hernandez, Jacob E. Sunshine, Tim Althoff, Xin Liu, Daniel McDuff |  |

Previous works often encode each aspect independently, which may limit their ability to capture meaningful internal correlations between aspects. While there has been significant work on mitigating spurious correlations, our approach focuses on leveraging the beneficial internal correlations to improve multi-aspect rationale extraction. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Aspect Rationale Extractor (MARE) to explain and predict multiple aspects simultaneously. Concretely, we propose a Multi-Aspect Multi-Head Attention (MAMHA) mechanism based on hard deletion to encode multiple text chunks simultaneously. Furthermore, multiple special tokens are prepended in front of the text with each corresponding to one certain aspect. Finally, multi-task training is deployed to reduce the training overhead.... | Han Jiang, Junwen Duan, Zhe Qu, Jianxin Wang |  |

Existing model-based guardrails have not been designed for resource-constrained computational portable devices, such as mobile phones, more and more of which are running LLM-based applications locally. We introduce LoRA-Guard, a parameter-efficient guardrail adaptation method that relies on knowledge sharing between LLMs and guardrail models. LoRA-Guard extracts language features from the LLMs and adapts them for the content moderation task using low-rank adapters, while a dual-path design prevents any performance degradation on the generative task. We show that LoRA-Guard outperforms existing approaches with 100-1000x lower parameter overhead while maintaining accuracy, enabling on-device content moderation. | Hayder Elesedy, Pedro M.

However, the understanding of puns in large language models (LLMs) has not been thoroughly examined, limiting their use in creative writing and humor creation. In this paper, we leverage three popular tasks, i.e., pun recognition, explanation and generation to systematically evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in pun understanding. In addition to adopting the automated evaluation metrics from prior research, we introduce new evaluation methods and metrics that are better suited to the in-context learning paradigm of LLMs. These new metrics offer a more rigorous assessment of an LLM’s ability to understand puns and align more closely with human cognition than previous metrics. Our findings reveal the “lazy pun generation” pattern and identify the primary challenges LLMs encounter in understanding puns. | Zhijun Xu, Siyu Yuan, Lingjie Chen, Deqing Yang |  |

Human evaluation is widely used in the field of question generation (QG) and serves as the gold standard for automatic metrics. However, there is a lack of unified human evaluation criteria, which hampers consistent and reliable evaluations of both QG models and automatic metrics. To address this, we propose \*\*QGEval\*\*, a multi-dimensional \*\*Eval\*\*uation benchmark for \*\*Q\*\*uestion \*\*G\*\*eneration, which evaluates both generated questions and existing automatic metrics across 7 dimensions: fluency, clarity, conciseness, relevance, consistency, answerability, and answer consistency. We demonstrate the appropriateness of these dimensions by examining their correlations and distinctions. Through consistent evaluations of QG models and automatic metrics with QGEval, we find that 1) most QG models... | Weiping Fu, Bifan Wei, Jianxiang Hu, Zhongmin Cai, Jun Liu |  |

However, these approaches do not support more complex graph-based representations, such as semantic dependencies or enhanced universal dependencies, as they cannot handle reentrancy or cycles. By extending them, we define a range of unbounded and bounded linearizations that can be used to cast graph parsing as a tagging task, enlarging the toolbox of problems that can be solved under this paradigm. Experimental results on semantic dependency and enhanced UD parsing show that with a good choice of encoding, sequence-labeling semantic dependency parsers combine high efficiency with accuracies close to the state of the art, in spite of their simplicity. | Ana Ezquerro, David Vilares, Carlos GómezRodríguez |  |

In this paper, we show how to use LLMs to create NuNER, a compact language representation model specialized in the Named Entity Recognition (NER) task. NuNER can be fine-tuned to solve downstream NER problems in a data-efficient way, outperforming similar-sized foundation models in the few-shot regime and competing with much larger LLMs. We find that the size and entity-type diversity of the pre-training dataset are key to achieving good performance. We view NuNER as a member of the broader family of task-specific foundation models, recently unlocked by LLMs. NuNER and NuNER’s dataset are open-sourced with MIT License. | Sergei Bogdanov, Alexandre Constantin, Timothée Bernard, Benoît Crabbé, Etienne Bernard |  |

Based on the place they were recorded, this study introduces a publicly-available and machine-actionable dataset of more than one hundred thousand Greek proverb variants. By quantifying the spatial distribution of proverbs, we show that the most widespread proverbs come from the mainland while the least widespread proverbs come primarily from the islands. By focusing on the least dispersed proverbs, we present the most frequent tokens per location and undertake a benchmark in geographical attribution, using text classification and regression (text geocoding). Our results show that this is a challenging task for which specific locations can be attributed more successfully compared to others. The potential of our resource and benchmark is showcased by two novel applications. First, we extracted terms moving the regression prediction toward the four cardinal directions. Second, we leveraged conformal prediction to... | John Pavlopoulos, Panos Louridas, Panagiotis Filos |  |

We designed a method to convert dense LLMs into fine-grained MoE architectures, and then visually studied the multilingual activation patterns of LLMs through expert activation frequency heatmaps. Through comprehensive experiments on different model families, different model sizes, and different variants, we analyzed the similarities and differences in the internal neuron activation patterns of LLMs when processing different languages. Specifically, we investigated the distribution of high-frequency activated experts, multilingual shared experts, whether multilingual activation patterns are related to language families, and the impact of instruction tuning on activation patterns. We further explored leveraging the discovered differences in expert activation frequencies to guide sparse... | Weize Liu, Yinlong Xu, Hongxia Xu, Jintai Chen, Xuming Hu, Jian Wu |  |

Particularly, the adoption of contrastive learning has substantially elevated state-of-the-art performance across various STS benchmarks. However, contrastive learning categorizes text pairs as either semantically similar or dissimilar, failing to leverage fine-grained annotated information and necessitating large batch sizes to prevent model collapse. These constraints pose challenges for researchers engaged in STS tasks that involve nuanced similarity levels or those with limited computational resources, compelling them to explore alternatives like Sentence-BERT. Despite its efficiency, Sentence-BERT tackles STS tasks from a classification perspective, overlooking the progressive nature of semantic relationships, which results in suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, this paper presents an innovative regression framework and proposes two simple yet... | Bowen Zhang, Chunping Li |  |

Our approach results in a single model that simultaneously classifies a sample and scores input tokens based on their relevance to the classification. To this end, we build on the widely-used three-player-game for training rationalized models, which typically relies on training a rationale selector, a classifier and a complement classifier. We simplify this approach by making a single model fulfill all three roles, leading to a more efficient training paradigm that is not susceptible to the common training instabilities that plague existing approaches. Further, we extend this paradigm to produce class-wise rationales while incorporating recent advances in parameterizing and regularizing the resulting rationales, thus leading to substantially improved and state-of-the-art alignment with human annotations without any explicit supervision. | Marc Felix Brinner, Sina Zarrieß |  |

This is commonly achieved by using rule-based or statistical methods relying on lexical features such as punctuation. Although some recent works no longer exclusively rely on punctuation, we find that no prior method achieves all of (i) robustness to missing punctuation, (ii) effective adaptability to new domains, and (iii) high efficiency. We introduce a new model — Segment any Text (SaT) — to solve this problem. To enhance robustness, we propose a new pretraining scheme that ensures less reliance on punctuation. To address adaptability, we introduce an extra stage of parameter-efficient fine-tuning, establishing state-of-the-art performance in distinct domains such as verses from lyrics and legal documents. Along the way, we introduce architectural modifications that result in a threefold gain in speed over the previous state of the art and solve spurious reliance on context far in the future.... | Markus Frohmann, Igor Sterner, Ivan Vulic, Benjamin Minixhofer, Markus Schedl |  |

Learning-based methods often perform poorly due to the long-tail distribution of vulnerability classification datasets. Recent approaches try to address the problem but treat each CWE class in isolation, ignoring their relationships. This results in non-scalable code vector representations, causing significant performance drops when handling complex real-world vulnerabilities. We propose a hierarchical contrastive learning framework for code vulnerability type classification to bring vector representations of related CWEs closer together. To address the issue of class collapse and enhance model robustness, we mix self-supervised contrastive learning loss into our loss function. Additionally, we employ max-pooling to enable the model to handle longer vulnerability code inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework... | Chen Ji, Su Yang, Hongyu Sun, Yuqing Zhang |  |

One approach to formal theorem proving involves generating complete proofs using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on Natural Language (NL) proofs. However, due to the scarcity of aligned NL and Formal Language (FL) theorem-proving data most modern LLMs exhibit suboptimal performance.This scarcity results in a paucity of methodologies for training LLMs and techniques to fully utilize their capabilities in composing formal proofs. To address these challenges, this paper proposes \*\*TheoremLlama\*\*, an end-to-end framework that trains a general-purpose LLM to be a Lean4 expert. \*\*TheoremLlama\*\* includes NL-FL dataset generation and bootstrapping method to obtain aligned dataset, curriculum learning and block training techniques to train the model, and iterative proof writing method to write Lean4 proofs that work together synergistically.Using the... | Ruida Wang, Jipeng Zhang, Yizhen Jia, Rui Pan, Shizhe Diao, Renjie Pi, Tong Zhang |  |

However, existing studies usually use synthetic speech to train and evaluate SpeechRE models, hindering the further development of SpeechRE due to the disparity between synthetic and real speech. Meanwhile, the modality gap issue, unexplored in SpeechRE, limits the performance of existing models. In this paper, we construct two real SpeechRE datasets to facilitate subsequent researches and propose a Multi-level Cross-modal Alignment Model (MCAM) for SpeechRE. Our model consists of three components: 1) a speech encoder, extracting speech features from the input speech; 2) an alignment adapter, mapping these speech features into a suitable semantic space for the text decoder; and 3) a text decoder, autoregressively generating relation triplets based on the speech features. During training, we first additionally introduce a text encoder to serve as a semantic bridge between the speech encoder and... | Liang Zhang, Zhen Yang, Biao Fu, Ziyao Lu, Liangying Shao, Shiyu Liu, Fandong Meng, Jie Zhou, Xiaoli Wang, Jinsong Su |  |

In this work, we investigate how self-training, a semi-supervised approach that uses a model to obtain pseudo-labels for unlabeled data, can be used to improve the efficiency of active learning for text classification. Building on a comprehensive reproduction of four previous self-training approaches, some of which are evaluated for the first time in the context of active learning or natural language processing, we introduce HAST, a new and effective self-training... | Christopher Schröder, Gerhard Heyer |  |

However, due to their tendency to overly ground given attributes, LLMs often generate unnatural responses provoked by using attributes that deviate from the flow of the conversation or by exploiting too many attributes at once. We term this phenomenon the \*overuse\* problem of LLMs. Unfortunately, research devising precise criteria and frameworks to quantitatively verify LLMs’ \*overuse\* problem is obviously insufficient. To address this issue, we propose \*\*P\*\*ersona \*\*A\*\*ttributes \*\*N\*\*avigation for \*\*D\*\*etecting and \*\*A\*\*lleviating the \*overuse\* problem (\*\*PANDA\*\*) framework. \*\*PANDA\*\* is the first study to quantify the persona \*overuse\* problem of LLMs by establishing clear standards of the problem and verifying various LLMs based on them.

AI systems are increasingly used across the world, yet safety alignment is often focused on homogeneous monolingual settings. Additionally, preference training and safety measures often overfit to harms common in Western-centric datasets. Here, we explore the viability of different alignment approaches when balancing dual objectives: addressing and optimizing for a non-homogeneous set of languages and cultural preferences while minimizing both global and local harms. We collect the first human annotated red teaming prompts in different languages, distinguishing between global and local harm, which serve as a laboratory to understand the reliability of alignment techniques when faced with preference distributions that are non-stationary across geographies and languages.

Ideally, one would train models like GPT using various segmentations and evaluate how well word meanings are captured. Since this is not computationally feasible, we group words according to their segmentation properties and compare how well a model can solve a linguistic task for these groups. We study two criteria: (i) adherence to morpheme boundaries and (ii) the segmentation consistency of the different inflected forms of a lemma. We select word forms with high and low values for these criteria and carry out experiments on GPT-4o’s ability to capture verbal inflection for 10 languages. Our results indicate that in particular the criterion of segmentation consistency can help to predict the model’s ability to recognize and generate the lemma from an inflected form, providing evidence that subword segmentation is relevant. | Marion Di Marco, Alexander Fraser |  |

In this study, we revisit this definition of Event Extraction (EE) by introducing two key argument types that cannot be modeled by existing EE frameworks. First, implicit arguments are event arguments which are not explicitly mentioned in the text, but can be inferred through context. Second, scattered arguments are event arguments that are composed of information scattered throughout the text. These two argument types are crucial to elicit the full breadth of information required for proper event modeling.To support the extraction of explicit, implicit, and scattered arguments, we develop a novel dataset, DiscourseEE, which includes 7,464 argument annotations from online health discourse. Notably, 51.2% of the arguments are implicit, and 17.4% are scattered, making DiscourseEE a unique corpus for... | Omar Sharif, Joseph Gatto, Madhusudan Basak, Sarah Masud Preum |  |

Despite the diversity of the information it can convey, NLF methods are often hand-designed and arbitrary, with little systematic grounding. At the same time, research in learning sciences has long established several effective feedback models. In this opinion piece, we compile ideas from pedagogy to introduce FELT, a feedback framework for LLMs that outlines various characteristics of the feedback space, and a feedback content taxonomy based on these variables, providing a general mapping of the feedback space. In addition to streamlining NLF designs, FELT also brings out new, unexplored directions for research in NLF. We make our taxonomy available to the community, providing guides and examples for mapping our categorizations to future research. | Beatriz Borges, Niket Tandon, Tanja Käser, Antoine Bosselut |  |

We introduce Unown, a novel framework that generates training instances for FC systems automatically using both textual and tabular content. Unown selects relevant evidence and generates supporting and refuting claims with advanced negation artifacts. Designed to be flexible, Unown accommodates various strategies for evidence selection and claim generation, offering unparalleled adaptability. We comprehensively evaluate Unown on both text-only and table+text benchmarks, including Feverous, SciFact, and MMFC, a new multi-modal FC dataset. Our results prove that Unown examples are of comparable quality to expert-labeled data, even enabling models to achieve up to 5% higher accuracy.

This significant yet previously unexplored area holds substantial practical relevance as it mirrors the dynamic requirements of real-world applications. We benchmark a representative set of continual learning (CL) algorithms for TLCL. Furthermore, we propose Task and Language-Specific Adapters (TLSA), an adapter-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy. TLSA facilitates cross-lingual and cross-task transfer and outperforms other parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques. Crucially, TLSA reduces parameter growth stemming from saving adapters to linear complexity from polynomial complexity as it was with parameter isolation-based adapter tuning. We conducted experiments on several NLP tasks arising across several... | Shrey Satapara, P. K. Srijith |  |

These works typically claim that such domain-adaptive pretraining (DAPT) improves performance on downstream medical tasks, such as answering medical licensing exam questions. In this paper, we compare seven public “medical” LLMs and two VLMs against their corresponding base models, arriving at a different conclusion: all medical VLMs and nearly all medical LLMs fail to consistently improve over their base models in the zero-/few-shot prompting regime for medical question-answering (QA) tasks. For instance, across the tasks and model pairs we consider in the 3-shot setting, medical LLMs only outperform their base models in 12.1% of cases, reach a (statistical) tie in 49.8% of cases, and are significantly worse than their base models in the... | Daniel P.

Among these approaches are the reasoning methods, best exemplified by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Program-Aided Language Models (PAL), which elicit LLMs to generate reasoning paths, thus promoting accuracy and attracting increasing attention. However, despite the success of these methods, the ability to deliver multi-step reasoning remains limited to a single language, making it challenging to generalize to other languages and hindering global development.In this work, we propose Cross-lingual Program-Aided Language Models (CrossPAL), a method for aligning reasoning programs across languages. In particular, our method delivers programs as intermediate reasoning steps in different languages through a double-step cross-lingual prompting mechanism inspired by the Program-Aided approach. In addition, we... | Leonardo Ranaldi, Giulia Pucci, Barry Haddow, Alexandra Birch |  |

An Evaluation of Shortcut Challenges in Large Language Models](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.679) |  | 0 | Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in various natural language processing tasks. However, LLMs may rely on dataset biases as shortcuts for prediction, which can significantly impair their robustness and generalization capabilities. This paper presents Shortcut Suite, a comprehensive test suite designed to evaluate the impact of shortcuts on LLMs’ performance, incorporating six shortcut types, five evaluation metrics, and four prompting strategies. Our extensive experiments yield several key findings: 1) LLMs demonstrate varying reliance on shortcuts for downstream tasks, which significantly impairs their performance. 2) Larger LLMs are more likely to utilize shortcuts under zero-shot and few-shot in-context learning prompts. 3) Chain-of-thought prompting notably reduces shortcut reliance and outperforms other prompting strategies, while few-shot prompts generally underperform compared to zero-shot prompts. 4) LLMs often exhibit overconfidence in their... | Yu Yuan, Lili Zhao, Kai Zhang, Guangting Zheng, Qi Liu |  |

However, these approaches face constraints in problem diversity, potentially restricting them to in-domain/distribution data generation. To this end, we propose \*\*ControlMath\*\*, an iterative method involving an equation-generator module and two LLM-based agents. The module creates diverse equations, which the Problem-Crafter agent then transforms into math word problems. The Reverse-Agent filters and selects high-quality data, adhering to the “less is more” principle. This approach enables the generation of diverse math problems, not limited to specific domains or distributions. As a result, we collect ControlMathQA, which involves 190k math word problems. Extensive results prove that combining our dataset with in-domain datasets like GSM8K can help improve the model’s mathematical ability to generalize, leading to improved performance both within and beyond... | Nuo Chen, Ning Wu, Jianhui Chang, Linjun Shou, Jia Li |  |

Identifying Origin of LLM-generated Content](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.681) |  | 0 | Generative models, particularly large language models (LLMs), have achieved remarkable success in producing natural and high-quality content. However, their widespread adoption raises concerns regarding copyright infringement, privacy violations, and security risks associated with AI-generated content. To address these concerns, we propose a novel digital forensics framework for LLMs, enabling the tracing of AI-generated content back to its source. This framework embeds a secret watermark directly into the generated output, eliminating the need for model retraining. To enhance traceability, especially for short outputs, we introduce a “depth watermark” that strengthens the link between content and generator. Our approach ensures accurate tracing while maintaining the quality of the generated content. Extensive experiments across various settings and datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed framework. | Liying Li, Yihan Bai, Minhao Cheng |  |

Existing evaluation resources lack domain and language diversity, limiting the ability for cross-domain and cross-lingual analyses. This paper introduces ReadMe++, a multilingual multi-domain dataset with human annotations of 9757 sentences in Arabic, English, French, Hindi, and Russian, collected from 112 different data sources. This benchmark will encourage research on developing robust multilingual readability assessment methods. Using ReadMe++, we benchmark multilingual and monolingual language models in the supervised, unsupervised, and few-shot prompting settings. The domain and language diversity in ReadMe++ enable us to test more effective few-shot prompting, and identify shortcomings in state-of-the-art unsupervised methods. Our experiments also reveal exciting results of superior domain generalization and enhanced cross-lingual transfer capabilities by models trained on... | Tarek Naous, Michael J.

However, there are few existing resources providing large amounts of standardized, easily accessible IGT data, limiting their applicability to linguistic research, and making it difficult to use such data in NLP modeling. We compile the largest existing corpus of IGT data from a variety of sources, covering over 450k examples across 1.8k languages, to enable research on crosslingual transfer and IGT generation. We normalize much of our data to follow a standard set of labels across languages.Furthermore, we explore the task of automatically generating IGT in order to aid documentation projects. As many languages lack sufficient monolingual data, we pretrain a large multilingual model on our corpus. We demonstrate the utility of this model by finetuning it on monolingual... | Michael Ginn, Lindia Tjuatja, Taiqi He, Enora Rice, Graham Neubig, Alexis Palmer, Lori S. Levin |  |

However, the data is not openly available, is restricted to the news domain, and is by now 35 years old. In this paper, we present and evaluate a new open-access, multi-genre benchmark for PDTB-style shallow discourse parsing, based on the existing UD English GUM corpus, for which discourse relation annotations in other frameworks already exist. In a series of experiments on cross-domain relation classification, we show that while our dataset is compatible with PDTB, substantial out-of-domain degradation is observed, which can be alleviated by joint training on both datasets. | Yang Janet Liu, Tatsuya Aoyama, Wesley Scivetti, Yilun Zhu, Shabnam Behzad, Lauren Levine, Jessica Lin, Devika Tiwari, Amir Zeldes |  |

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) strategies are effective but are inference inefficient, while previous Retrieval Free Generations (RFG) are more efficient but sacrifice faithfulness. To solve this faithfulness-efficiency trade-off dilemma, we propose a novel retrieval-free model training scheme named Retrieval Augmented to Retrieval Free Distillation (RA2FD) to build a retrieval-free model that achieves higher faithfulness than the previous RFG method while maintaining inference efficiency. The core idea of RA2FD is to use a teacher-student framework to distill the faithfulness capacity of a teacher, which is an oracle RAG model that generates multiple knowledge-infused responses. The student retrieval-free model learns how to generate faithful responses from these teacher labels through sequence-level distillation and contrastive learning. Experiment results show that RA2FD let the faithfulness... | Zhiyuan Zhu, Yusheng Liao, Chenxin Xu, Yunfeng Guan, Yanfeng Wang, Yu Wang |  |

However, the reasoning to definite answers emphasizes more on logical thinking, and falls short in effectively reflecting the comprehensive, reflective, and creative thinking that is also critical for the overall reasoning prowess of LLMs. In light of this, we build a dataset SJTP comprising diverse SubJective ToPics with free responses, as well as three evaluation indicators to fully explore LLM’s reasoning ability. We observe that a sole emphasis on logical thinking falls short in effectively tackling subjective challenges. Therefore, we introduce a framework grounded in the principle of the Negation of Negation (NeoN) to unleash the potential comprehensive, reflective, and creative thinking abilities of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments on SJTP demonstrate the efficacy of NeoN, and... | Fangrui Lv, Kaixiong Gong, Jian Liang, Xinyu Pang, Changshui Zhang |  |

However, it is now well known that LMs can demonstrate radical improvements in the presence of experimental contexts such as in-context examples and instructions. How well does this translate to previously studied meaning-sensitive tasks? We present a case-study on the extent to which experimental contexts can improve LMs’ robustness in performing property inheritance—predicting semantic properties of novel concepts, a task that they have been previously shown to fail on. Upon carefully controlling the nature of the in-context examples and the instructions, our work reveals that they can indeed lead to non-trivial property inheritance behavior in LMs. However, this ability is inconsistent: with a minimal reformulation of the task, some LMs were found to pick up on shallow, non-semantic heuristics from their inputs, suggesting that the... | Kanishka Misra, Allyson Ettinger, Kyle Mahowald |  |

Given the proliferation of available PLMs, selecting the most effective one for a given dataset has become a non-trivial challenge. As a promising alternative to human intuition and brute-force fine-tuning, Transferability Estimation (TE) has emerged as an effective approach to model selection. However, current TE methods are primarily designed for classification tasks, and their estimated transferability may not align well with the objectives of text ranking. To address this challenge, we propose to compute the expected rank as transferability, explicitly reflecting the model’s ranking capability. Furthermore, to mitigate anisotropy and incorporate training dynamics, we adaptively scale isotropic sentence embeddings to yield an accurate expected rank score. Our resulting method, Adaptive Ranking Transferability (AiRTran), can effectively... | Jun Bai, Zhuofan Chen, Zhenzi Li, Hanhua Hong, Jianfei Zhang, Chen Li, Chenghua Lin, Wenge Rong |  |

However, the underlying working mechanism of ICL remains poorly understood. Recent research presents two conflicting views on ICL: One emphasizes the impact of similar examples in the demonstrations, stressing the need for label correctness and more shots. The other attributes it to LLMs’ inherent ability of task recognition, deeming label correctness and shot numbers of demonstrations as not crucial. In this work, we provide a Two-Dimensional Coordinate System that unifies both views into a systematic framework. The framework explains the behavior of ICL through two orthogonal variables: whether similar examples are presented in the demonstrations (perception) and whether LLMs can recognize the task (cognition). We propose the peak inverse rank metric to detect the task recognition ability of LLMs and study LLMs’ reactions to different definitions of similarity. Based on these, we conduct... | Anhao Zhao, Fanghua Ye, Jinlan Fu, Xiaoyu Shen |  |

Although unified speech-text pre-training and multimodal data instruction-tuning offer considerable benefits, these methods generally entail significant resource demands and tend to overfit specific tasks.This study aims to refine the use of speech datasets for LSM training by addressing the limitations of vanilla instruction tuning. We explore the instruction-following dynamics within LSMs, identifying a critical issue termed speech anchor bias—a tendency for LSMs to over-rely on speech inputs, mistakenly interpreting the entire speech modality as directives, thereby neglecting textual instructions.To counteract this bias, we introduce a self-powered LSM that leverages augmented automatic speech recognition data generated by the model itself for more effective instruction tuning.

However, there is still a lack of focused work on evaluating scripts generated by LLMs. The evaluation of scripts poses challenges due to their logical structure, sequential organization, adherence to commonsense constraints, and open-endedness. In this work, We introduced a novel script evaluation dataset, MCScript, consisting of more than 1,500 script evaluation tasks and steps, and developed an agent-based script evaluation framework, ABSEval, to collaboratively evaluate scripts generated by LLMs. Our experiments demonstrate that ABSEval provides superior accuracy and relevance, aligning closely with human evaluation. We evaluated the script planning capabilities of 15 mainstream LLMs and provided a detailed analysis. Furthermore, we observed phenomena like the key factor influencing the script planning ability of LLM is not parameter size and suggested improvements... | Sirui Liang, Baoli Zhang, Jun Zhao, Kang Liu |  |

Many previous efforts aimed at explaining these predictions rely on input features, specifically, the words within NLP models. However, such explanations are often less informative due to the discrete nature of these words and their lack of contextual verbosity. To address this limitation, we introduce the Latent Concept Attribution method (LACOAT), which generates explanations for predictions based on latent concepts. Our foundational intuition is that a word can exhibit multiple facets, contingent upon the context in which it is used. Therefore, given a word in context, the latent space derived from our training process reflects a specific facet of that word. LACOAT functions by mapping the representations of salient input words into the training latent space, allowing it to provide latent context-based explanations of the prediction. | Xuemin Yu, Fahim Dalvi, Nadir Durrani, Marzia Nouri, Hassan Sajjad |  |

This data plays a crucial role in the development of models for analysing socio-linguistic phenomena within online communities. In this work, we conduct an in-depth examination of 20 datasets extensively used in NLP for CSS to comprehensively examine data quality. Our analysis reveals that social media datasets exhibit varying levels of data duplication. Consequently, this gives rise to challenges like label inconsistencies and data leakage, compromising the reliability of models. Our findings also suggest that data duplication has an impact on the current claims of state-of-the-art performance, potentially leading to an overestimation of model effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Finally, we propose new protocols and best practices for improving dataset development from social media data and its usage. | Yida Mu, Mali Jin, Xingyi Song, Nikolaos Aletras |  |

It involves a path-star graph where multiple arms radiate from a single starting node and each node is unique. Given the start node and a specified target node that ends an arm, the task is to generate the arm containing that target node. This is straightforward for a human but surprisingly difficult for language models, which did not outperform the random baseline. The authors hypothesized this is due to a deficiency in teacher-forcing and the next-token prediction paradigm. We demonstrate the task is learnable using teacher-forcing in alternative settings and that the issue is partially due to representation. We introduce a regularization method using structured samples of the same graph but with differing target nodes, improving results across a variety of model types. We provide RASP proofs showing the task is theoretically... | Arvid Frydenlund |  |

Proposed solutions aim to capture minority perspectives by either modelling annotator disagreements or grouping annotators based on shared metadata, both of which face significant challenges. We propose a framework that trains models without encoding annotator metadata, extracts latent embeddings informed by annotator behaviour, and creates clusters of similar opinions, that we refer to as voices. Resulting clusters are validated post-hoc via internal and external quantitative metrics, as well a qualitative analysis to identify the type of voice that each cluster represents. Our results demonstrate the strong generalisation capability of our framework, indicated by resulting clusters being adequately robust, while also capturing minority perspectives based on different demographic factors throughout two distinct datasets. | Nikolas Vitsakis, Amit Parekh, Ioannis Konstas |  |

To address the issue, we present Neeko, an innovative framework designed for efficient multiple characters imitation. Neeko employs a dynamic low-rank adapter (LoRA) strategy, enabling it to adapt seamlessly to diverse characters. Our framework breaks down the role-playing process into agent pre-training, multiple characters playing, and character incremental learning, effectively handling both seen and unseen roles. This dynamic approach, coupled with distinct LoRA blocks for each character, enhances Neeko’s adaptability to unique attributes, personalities, and speaking patterns. As a result, Neeko demonstrates superior performance in MCRP over most existing methods, offering more engaging and versatile user interaction experiences. | Xiaoyan Yu, Tongxu Luo, Yifan Wei, Fangyu Lei, Yiming Huang, Hao Peng, Liehuang Zhu |  |

Traditionally anchored to static datasets, these models often struggle to keep up with the rapid linguistic evolution characteristic of online communities. This research aims to bridge this gap by enhancing LLMs’ comprehension of the evolving new concepts on the Internet, without the high cost of continual retraining. In pursuit of this goal, we introduce SLNAG, a benchmark designed to autonomously integrate novel data and assess LLMs’ ability to comprehend emerging concepts, alongside FOCUS, an approach uses causal inference to enhance LLMs to understand new phrases and their colloquial context. Our benchmark and approach involves understanding real-world instances of linguistic shifts, serving as contextual beacons, to form more precise and contextually relevant connections between newly emerging... | Lingrui Mei, Shenghua Liu, Yiwei Wang, Baolong Bi, Xueqi Cheng |  |

Recent work has aimed to reverse engineer transformer models into human-readable representations called circuits that implement algorithmic functions. We extend this research by analyzing and comparing circuits for similar sequence continuation tasks, which include increasing sequences of Arabic numerals, number words, and months. By applying circuit interpretability analysis, we identify a key sub-circuit in both GPT-2 Small and Llama-2-7B responsible for detecting sequence members and for predicting the next member in a sequence. Our analysis reveals that semantically related sequences rely on shared circuit subgraphs with analogous roles. Additionally, we show that this sub-circuit has effects on various math-related prompts, such as on intervaled circuits, Spanish number word and months continuation, and natural language word problems.

One desired property and open question in KE is to let edited LMs correctly handle ripple effects, where LM is expected to answer its logically related knowledge accurately. In this paper, we answer the question of why most KE methods still create messy ripple effects. We conduct extensive analysis and identify a salient indicator, GradSim, that effectively reveals when and why updated knowledge ripples in LMs. GradSim is computed by the cosine similarity between gradients of the original fact and its related knowledge. We observe a strong positive correlation between ripple effect performance and GradSim across different LMs, KE methods, and evaluation metrics. Further investigations into three counter-intuitive failure cases (Negation, Over-Ripple, Multi-Lingual) of ripple effects demonstrate that these failures are often... | Jiaxin Qin, Zixuan Zhang, Chi Han, Pengfei Yu, Manling Li, Heng Ji |  |

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, Lifelong Event Detection via Optimal Transport (\*\*LEDOT\*\*), that leverages optimal transport principles to align the optimization of our classification module with the intrinsic nature of each class, as defined by their pre-trained language modeling. Our method integrates replay sets, prototype latent representations, and an innovative Optimal Transport component. Extensive experiments on MAVEN and ACE datasets demonstrate LEDOT’s superior performance, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. The results underscore LEDOT as a pioneering solution in continual event detection, offering a more effective and nuanced approach to addressing catastrophic forgetting in evolving environments. | Viet Dao, VanCuong Pham, Quyen Tran, ThanhThien Le, Linh Ngo Van, Thien Huu Nguyen |  |

Nowadays, fine-tuning has become the most popular method for adapting a model to practical usage by significantly increasing accuracy on downstream tasks. Despite the great accuracy it achieves, we found fine-tuning is still far away from satisfactory trustworthiness due to “tuning-induced mis-calibration”. In this paper, we delve deeply into why and how mis-calibration exists in fine-tuned models, and how distillation can alleviate the issue. Then we further propose a brand new method named Efficient Trustworthy Distillation (FIRST), which utilizes a small portion of teacher’s knowledge to obtain a reliable language model in a cost-efficient way. Specifically, we identify the “concentrated knowledge” phenomenon during... | KaShun Shum, Minrui Xu, Jianshu Zhang, Zixin Chen, Shizhe Diao, Hanze Dong, Jipeng Zhang, Muhammad Omer Raza |  |

This process risks catastrophic forgetting: rapid loss of generic translation quality. Forgetting has been widely observed, with many mitigation methods proposed. However, the causes of forgetting and the relationship between forgetting and adaptation data are underexplored.This paper takes a novel approach to understanding catastrophic forgetting during NMT adaptation by investigating the impact of the data. We provide a first investigation of what is forgotten, and why. We examine the relationship between forgetting and the in-domain data, and show that the amount and type of forgetting is linked to that data’s target vocabulary coverage. Our findings pave the way toward better informed NMT domain adaptation. | Danielle Saunders, Steve DeNeefe |  |

Various systems have been proposed such as smart reply and AI-assisted writing. Yet, the heterogeneity of the forms of inputs and architectures often renders it challenging to combine insights from user behaviour in one system to improve performance in another. In this work, we consider the case where the user does not select any of the suggested replies from a smart reply system, and how this can be used as one-shot implicit negative feedback to enhance the accuracy of an AI writing model. We introduce Nifty, an approach that uses classifier guidance to controllably integrate implicit user feedback into the text generation process. Empirically, we find up to 34% improvement in Rouge-L, 89% improvement in generating the correct intent, and an 86% win-rate according to human evaluators compared to a vanilla AI writing system on the MultiWOZ and Schema-Guided Dialog datasets. The code is available at... | Benjamin Towle, Ke Zhou |  |

Correctness of a long-form response, however, also depends on the recall of multiple pieces of information relevant to the question. In this paper, we introduce Atomic Self-Consistency (ASC), a technique for improving the recall of relevant information in an LLM response. ASC follows recent work, Universal Self-Consistency (USC) in using multiple stochastic samples from an LLM to improve the long-form response. Unlike USC which only focuses on selecting the best single generation, ASC picks authentic subparts from the samples and merges them into a superior composite answer. Through extensive experiments and ablations, we show that merging relevant subparts of multiple samples performs significantly better than picking a single sample. ASC demonstrates significant gains over USC on multiple factoids and open-ended QA datasets - ASQA,... | Raghuveer Thirukovalluru, Yukun Huang, Bhuwan Dhingra |  |

This research examines the biases exhibited by LLMs towards different brands, a significant concern given the widespread use of LLMs in affected use cases such as product recommendation and market analysis. Biased models may perpetuate societal inequalities, unfairly favoring established global brands while marginalizing local ones. Using a curated dataset across four brand categories, we probe the behavior of LLMs in this space. We find a consistent pattern of bias in this space—both in terms of disproportionately associating global brands with positive attributes and disproportionately recommending luxury gifts for individuals in high-income countries. We also find LLMs are subject to country-of-origin effects which may boost local brand preference in LLM outputs in specific contexts. | Mahammed Kamruzzaman, Hieu Nguyen, Gene Louis Kim |  |

Incorrect translation of these words can have severe consequences, impacting translation quality and user trust. While rare word translation is inherently challenging for neural models due to sparse learning signals, real-world scenarios often allow access to translations of past recordings on similar topics. To leverage these valuable resources, we propose a retrieval-and-demonstration approach to enhance rare word translation accuracy in direct ST models. First, we adapt existing ST models to incorporate retrieved examples for rare word translation, which allows the model to benefit from prepended examples, similar to in-context learning. We then develop a cross-modal (speech-to-speech, speech-to-text, text-to-text) retriever to locate suitable examples. We demonstrate that standard ST models can be effectively adapted to leverage examples for rare word translation, improving rare word translation accuracy over... | Siqi Li, Danni Liu, Jan Niehues |  |

These systems are crucial in providing underrepresented populations with improved access to valuable education. One important area of education that is unavailable to many learners is strategic bargaining related to negotiation. To address this, we develop a LLM-based Assistant for Coaching nEgotiation (ACE). ACE not only serves as a negotiation partner for users but also provides them with targeted feedback for improvement. To build our system, we collect a dataset of negotiation transcripts between MBA students. These transcripts come from trained negotiators and emulate realistic bargaining scenarios. We use the dataset, along with expert consultations, to design an annotation scheme for detecting negotiation mistakes. ACE employs this scheme to identify mistakes and provide targeted feedback to users. To test the effectiveness of ACE-generated feedback, we conducted a user experiment... | Ryan Shea, Aymen Kallala, Xin Liu, Michael W. Morris, Zhou Yu |  |

How to utilize TOD accurately, efficiently and effectively for information collection has always been a critical and challenging task. Recent studies have demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in dialogue, instruction generation, and reasoning, and can significantly enhance the performance of TOD through fine-tuning. However, current datasets primarily cater to user-led systems and are limited to predefined specific scenarios and slots, thereby necessitating improvements in the proactiveness, diversity, and capabilities of TOD. In this study, we present a detailed multi-domain task-oriented data construction process for conversations, and a Chinese dialogue dataset generated based on this process, \*\*TransferTOD\*\*, which authentically simulates human-computer dialogues in 30 popular life service scenarios. Leveraging this dataset, we trained a... | Ming Zhang, Caishuang Huang, Yilong Wu, Shichun Liu, Huiyuan Zheng, Yurui Dong, Yujiong Shen, Shihan Dou, Jun Zhao, Junjie Ye, Qi Zhang, Tao Gui, Xuanjing Huang |  |

Despite its importance, many mental health professionals highlight a disconnect between their training and actual real-world patient practice. To help bridge this gap, we propose PATIENT-𝜓, a novel patient simulation framework for cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) training. To build PATIENT-𝜓, we construct diverse patient cognitive models based on CBT principles and use large language models (LLMs) programmed with these cognitive models to act as a simulated therapy patient. We propose an interactive training scheme, PATIENT-𝜓-TRAINER, for mental health trainees to practice a key skill in CBT – formulating the cognitive model of the patient – through role-playing a therapy session with PATIENT-𝜓. To evaluate PATIENT-𝜓, we conducted a comprehensive user study of 13 mental health trainees and 20 experts. The results demonstrate that practice using PATIENT-𝜓-TRAINER enhances the perceived skill acquisition and... | Ruiyi Wang, Stephanie Milani, Jamie C. Chiu, Jiayin Zhi, Shaun M.

Prior works have explored hierarchical label structures to find relevant information for few-shot classes, but mostly neglected to incorporate external knowledge from medical guidelines. This paper presents DKEC, Domain Knowledge Enhanced Classification for diagnosis prediction with two innovations: (1) automated construction of heterogeneous knowledge graphs from external sources to capture semantic relations among diverse medical entities, (2) incorporating the heterogeneous knowledge graphs in few-shot classification using a label-wise attention mechanism. We construct DKEC using three online medical knowledge sources and evaluate it on a real-world Emergency Medical Services (EMS) dataset and a public electronic health record (EHR) dataset. Results show that DKEC outperforms the state-of-the-art label-wise attention networks and transformer models of different... | Xueren Ge, Abhishek Satpathy, Ronald D. Williams, John A.

Unfortunately, the study concluded that the LLMs could not self-correct reasoning yet. We find that a simple yet effective prompting method enhances LLM performance in identifying and correcting inaccurate answers without external feedback.That is to mask a key condition in the question, add the current response to construct a verification question, and predict the condition to verify the response. The condition can be an entity in an open-domain question or a numerical value in an arithmetic question, which requires minimal effort (via prompting) to identify. We propose an iterative verify-then-correct framework to progressively identify and correct (probably) false responses, named ProCo. We conduct experiments on three reasoning tasks. On average, ProCo, with GPT-3.5-Turbo-1106 as the backend LLM, yields +6.8 exact match on four... | Zhenyu Wu, Qingkai Zeng, Zhihan Zhang, Zhaoxuan Tan, Chao Shen, Meng Jiang |  |

In this study, we compared essays written by second language (L2) learners with various native language (L1) backgrounds to investigate how they distribute information in their non-native L2 production. Analyses of surprisal and constancy of entropy rate indicated that writers with higher L2 proficiency can reduce the expected uncertainty of language production while still conveying informative content. However, the uniformity of information distribution showed less variability among different groups of L2 speakers, suggesting that this feature may be universal in L2 essay writing and less affected by L2 writers’ variability in L1 background and L2 proficiency. | Zixin Tang, Janet G. van Hell |  |

However, their colossal parameter space prohibits their training on resource-constrained edge-devices. For federated fine-tuning, we need to consider the smaller FMs of few billion parameters at most, namely on-device FMs (ODFMs), which can be deployed on-device. Federated fine-tuning of ODFMs has unique challenges non-present in standard fine-tuning: i) ODFMs poorly generalize to downstream tasks due to their limited sizes making proper fine-tuning imperative to their performance, and ii) devices have limited and heterogeneous system capabilities and data that can deter the performance of fine-tuning.Tackling these challenges, we propose HetLoRA, a feasible and effective federated fine-tuning method for ODFMs that leverages the system and data heterogeneity at the edge. HetLoRA allows heterogeneous LoRA ranks across clients for their individual system resources, and efficiently aggregates and... | Yae Jee Cho, Luyang Liu, Zheng Xu, Aldi Fahrezi, Gauri Joshi |  |

This makes the migration of acceleration methods to the new model more costly and more demanding on device memory. To address this problem, we propose the Make Some Noise (MSN) training framework as a replacement for the supervised fine-tuning stage of the large language model. The training method simply introduces some noise at the input for the model to learn the denoising task. It significantly enhances the parallel decoding capability of the model without affecting the original task capability. In addition, we propose a tree-based retrieval-augmented Jacobi (TR-Jacobi) decoding strategy to further improve the inference speed of MSN models. Experiments in both the general and code domains have shown that MSN can improve inference speed by 2.3-2.7x times without compromising model performance. The MSN model also achieves comparable... | Yixuan Wang, Xianzhen Luo, Fuxuan Wei, Yijun Liu, Qingfu Zhu, Xuanyu Zhang, Qing Yang, Dongliang Xu, Wanxiang Che |  |

However, there are instances where we desire a model that excels in specific areas without markedly compromising performance in other areas. A cost-effective and straightforward approach is sampling with low-dimensional data features, which allows selecting large-scale pretraining data for domain-specific use cases. In this work, we revisit importance sampling with n-gram features consisting of multi-granular tokens, which strikes a good balance between sentence compression and representation capabilities. We observed the sampled data to have a high correlation with the target downstream task performance \*while preserving its effectiveness on other tasks\*. This leads to the proposed data sampling paradigm where language models can be pretrained more efficiently on selected documents. On eight benchmarks we demonstrate with ~1% of the data, pretrained models perform on... | Ernie Chang, PinJie Lin, Yang Li, Changsheng Zhao, Daeil Kim, Rastislav Rabatin, Zechun Liu, Yangyang Shi, Vikas Chandra |  |

Prior works have utilized this platform to extract epidemic-related information (e.g. infections, preventive measures) to provide early warnings for epidemic prediction. However, these works only focused on English posts, while epidemics can occur anywhere in the world, and early discussions are often in the local, non-English languages. In this work, we introduce the first multilingual Event Extraction (EE) framework SPEED++ for extracting epidemic event information for any disease and language. To this end, we extend a previous epidemic ontology with 20 argument roles; and curate our multilingual EE dataset SPEED++ comprising 5.1K tweets in four languages for four diseases.

This work studies coupling comprehension and generation with focus on continually learning from interaction with users. We propose techniques to tightly integrate the two capabilities for both learning and inference. We situate our studies in two-player reference games, and deploy various models for thousands of interactions with human users, while learning from interaction feedback signals. We show dramatic improvements in performance over time, with comprehension-generation coupling leading to performance improvements up to 26% in absolute terms and up to 17% higher accuracies compared to a non-coupled system. Our analysis also shows coupling has substantial qualitative impact on the system’s language, making it significantly more human-like. | Mustafa Omer Gul, Yoav Artzi |  |

Despite promising results in various image-language downstream tasks, it is still challenging and unclear how to extend the capabilities of these models to the more complex video domain, especially when dealing with explicit temporal signals. To address the problem in existing large multimodal models, in this paper we adopt visual instruction tuning to build a unified causal video-oriented language modeling framework, named UNICORN. Specifically, we collect a comprehensive dataset under the instruction-following format, and instruction-tune the model accordingly. Experimental results demonstrate that without customized training objectives and intensive pre-training, UNICORN can achieve comparable or better performance on established temporal video-language tasks including moment retrieval, video paragraph captioning and dense video... | Yuanhao Xiong, Yixin Nie, Haotian Liu, Boxin Wang, Jun Chen, Rong Jin, ChoJui Hsieh, Lorenzo Torresani, Jie Lei |  |

In this paper, we propose a new task of narrative schema labelling based on the concept of “story morals” to identify the values and lessons conveyed in stories. Using large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, we develop methods to automatically extract and validate story morals across a diverse set of narrative genres, including folktales, novels, movies and TV, personal stories from social media and the news. Our approach involves a multi-step prompting sequence to derive morals and validate them through both automated metrics and human assessments. The findings suggest that LLMs can effectively approximate human story moral interpretations and offer a new avenue for computational narrative understanding. By clustering the extracted morals on a sample dataset of folktales from around the world, we highlight the commonalities and distinctiveness of narrative values,... | David Hobson, Haiqi Zhou, Derek Ruths, Andrew Piper |  |

We study one such social issue: homelessness in the U.S., by leveraging the remarkable capabilities of large language models to assist social work experts in analyzing millions of posts from Twitter. We introduce a framing typology: Online Attitudes Towards Homelessness (OATH) Frames: nine hierarchical frames capturing critiques, responses and perceptions. We release annotations with varying degrees of assistance from language models, with immense benefits in scaling: 6.5× speedup in annotation time while only incurring a 3 point F1 reduction in performance with respect to the domain experts.

Analogical thinking allows humans to solve problems in creative ways, grasp difficult concepts, and articulate ideas more effectively. Can language models (LMs) do the same? To answer this question, we propose AnaloBench, a benchmark to determine analogical reasoning ability in LMs. Our benchmarking approach focuses on aspects of this ability that are common among humans: (i) recalling related experiences from a large amount of information, and (ii) applying analogical reasoning to complex and lengthy scenarios. We collect a set of 340 high quality, human written analogies for use in our benchmark, which constitutes the largest such collection to date. We then test a broad collection of models consisting of 12 open source and 3 proprietary in various sizes and architectures.

Several datasets have been proposed for training and validating SciIE models. However, due to the high complexity and cost of annotating scientific texts, those datasets restrict their annotations to specific parts of paper, such as abstracts, resulting in the loss of diverse entity mentions and relations in context. In this paper, we release a new entity and relation extraction dataset for entities related to datasets, methods, and tasks in scientific articles. Our dataset contains 106 manually annotated full-text scientific publications with over 24k entities and 12k relations. To capture the intricate use and interactions among entities in full texts, our dataset contains a fine-grained tag set for relations.

One compelling hypothesis is that hallucinations occur when a language model is given a generation task outside its parametric knowledge (due to rarity, recency, domain, etc.). A common strategy to address this limitation is to infuse the language models with retrieval mechanisms, providing the model with relevant knowledge for the task. In this paper, we leverage the planning capabilities of instruction-tuned LLMs and analyze how planning can be used to guide retrieval to further reduce the frequency of hallucinations. We empirically evaluate several variations of our proposed approach on long-form text generation tasks. By improving the coverage of relevant facts, plan-guided retrieval and generation can produce more informative responses while providing a higher rate of attribution to source documents. | Ameya Godbole, Nicholas Monath, Seungyeon Kim, Ankit Singh Rawat, Andrew McCallum, Manzil Zaheer |  |

We propose Detecting Errors through Ensembling Prompts (DEEP) - an end-to-end large language model framework for detecting factual errors in text summarization. Our framework uses a diverse set of LLM prompts to identify factual inconsistencies, treating their outputs as binary features, which are then fed into ensembling models. We then calibrate the ensembled models to produce empirically accurate probabilities that a text is factually consistent or free of hallucination. We demonstrate that prior models for detecting factual errors in summaries perform significantly worse without optimizing the thresholds on subsets of the evaluated dataset.

However, despite widespread adoption, the vast majority of work to-date has focused on a small set of high-resource languages like English and Chinese. This captures a small fraction of the languages in the world, but also makes it unclear which aspects of current state-of-the-art research transfer to a multilingual setting. In this work, we perform an exhaustive study to achieve a new state of the art in aligning multilingual LLMs. We introduce a novel, scalable method for generating high-quality multilingual feedback data to balance data coverage. We establish the benefits of cross-lingual transfer and increased dataset size in preference training. Our preference-trained model achieves a 54.4% win-rate against Aya 23 8B, the current state-of-the-art multilingual LLM in its parameter class, and a 69.5% win-rate or higher against widely used models like Gemma,... | John Dang, Arash Ahmadian, Kelly Marchisio, Julia Kreutzer, Ahmet Üstün, Sara Hooker |  |

Despite the prevalence and harmfulness of logical fallacies, detecting and classifying logical fallacies still remains a challenging task. We observe that logical fallacies often use connective words to indicate an intended logical relation between two arguments, while the argument semantics does not actually support the logical relation. Inspired by this observation, we propose to build a logical structure tree to explicitly represent and track the hierarchical logic flow among relation connectives and their arguments in a statement. Specifically, this logical structure tree is constructed in an unsupervised manner guided by the constituency tree and a taxonomy of connectives for ten common logical relations, with relation connectives as non-terminal nodes and textual arguments as terminal nodes, and the latter are mostly elementary discourse units.

We identify a theoretical constraint, showing that transformers require at least log2 (n+1) layers to handle entity tracking with n state changes. To address this issue, we propose an efficient and frugal enhancement to the standard attention mechanism, enabling it to manage long-term dependencies more efficiently. By considering attention as an adjacency matrix, our model can track entity states with a single layer.Empirical results demonstrate significant improvements in entity tracking datasets while keeping competitive performance on standard natural language modeling. Our modified attention allows us to achieve the same performance with drastically fewer layers. Additionally, our enhanced mechanism reveals structured internal representations of attention.

The high dimensionality of the trigger search space and the diverse range of potential malicious behaviors in LLMs make this a critical open problem. This paper presents BEEAR, a novel mitigation method based on a key insight: backdoor triggers induce a uniform drift in the model’s embedding space, irrespective of the trigger’s form or targeted behavior. Leveraging this observation, we introduce a bi-level optimization approach. The inner level identifies universal perturbations to the decoder’s embeddings that steer the model towards defender-defined unwanted behaviors; the outer level fine-tunes the model to reinforce safe behaviors against these perturbations. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, reducing the success rate of safety backdoor attacks from over 95% to <1% for general harmful behaviors... | Yi Zeng, Weiyu Sun, Tran Ngoc Huynh, Dawn Song, Bo Li, Ruoxi Jia |  |

Traditional approaches have heavily relied on manual features and fail to capture long-range correlations, limiting their effectiveness. Recent advancements leverage text embeddings from pre-trained language models, which require significant fine-tuning on labeled data, posing challenges in data dependency and limited interpretability. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their deep reasoning capabilities and ability to maintain long-range textual associations, offer a promising alternative. This study explores the potential of pre-trained LLMs in one-shot authorship attribution, specifically utilizing Bayesian approaches and probability outputs of LLMs. Our methodology calculates the probability that a text entails previous writings of an author, reflecting a more nuanced understanding of authorship. By utilizing only pre-trained models such as Llama-3-70B, our results on the IMDb and blog datasets show an... | Zhengmian Hu, Tong Zheng, Heng Huang |  |

However, such a paradigm fails to comprehensively differentiate the fine-grained language and cognitive skills, rendering the lack of sufficient interpretation to LLMs’ capabilities. In this paper, we present FAC2E, a framework for Fine-grAined and Cognition-grounded LLMs’ Capability Evaluation. Specifically, we formulate LLMs’ evaluation in a multi-dimensional and explainable manner by dissociating the language-related capabilities and the cognition-related ones. Besides, through extracting the intermediate reasoning from LLMs, we further break down the process of applying a specific capability into three sub-steps: recalling relevant knowledge, utilizing knowledge, and solving problems. Finally, FAC2E evaluates each sub-step of each fine-grained capability, providing a two-faceted diagnosis for LLMs. Utilizing FAC2E, we identify a common shortfall in... | Xiaoqiang Wang, Lingfei Wu, Tengfei Ma, Bang Liu |  |

We propose OpenSep, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for automated audio separation, eliminating the need for manual intervention and overcoming source limitations. OpenSep uses textual inversion to generate captions from audio mixtures with off-the-shelf audio captioning models, effectively parsing the sound sources present. It then employs few-shot LLM prompting to extract detailed audio properties of each parsed source, facilitating separation in unseen mixtures. Additionally, we introduce a multi-level extension of the mix-and-separate training framework to enhance modality alignment by separating single source sounds and mixtures simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate OpenSep’s superiority... | Tanvir Mahmud, Diana Marculescu |  |

This, along with the scarcity of high-quality parallel retrieval data, limits their performance in retrieval. We introduce LANCER, a multi-task learning framework that improves language-invariant dense retrieval by reducing language-specific signals in the embedding space. Leveraging the notion of linear concept erasure, we design a loss function that penalizes cross-correlation between representations and their language labels. LANCER leverages only English retrieval data and general multilingual corpora, training models to focus on language-invariant retrieval by semantic similarity without necessitating a vast parallel corpus. Experimental results on various datasets show our method consistently improves over baselines, with extensive analyses demonstrating greater language agnosticism. | Zhiqi Huang, Puxuan Yu, Shauli Ravfogel, James Allan |  |

Traditional evaluation metrics rely heavily on lexical similarity with human-written references, often showing poor correlation with human judgments and failing to account for alignment with the diversity of human preferences. To address these challenges, we introduce PerSE, an interpretable evaluation framework designed to assess alignment with specific human preferences. It is tuned to infer specific preferences from an in-context personal profile and evaluate the alignment between the generated content and personal preferences. PerSE enhances interpretability by providing detailed comments and fine-grained scoring, facilitating more personalized content generation. Our 13B LLaMA-2-based PerSE shows a 15.8% increase in Kendall correlation and a 13.7% rise in accuracy with zero-shot reviewers... | Danqing Wang, Kevin Yang, Hanlin Zhu, Xiaomeng Yang, Andrew Cohen, Lei Li, Yuandong Tian |  |

When asked to generate deceptive outputs, language models tend to leak honest counterparts but believe them to be false. Exploiting this deficiency, we propose a jailbreak attack method that elicits an aligned language model for malicious output. Specifically, we query the model to generate a fallacious yet deceptively real procedure for the harmful behavior. Since a fallacious procedure is generally considered fake and thus harmless by LLMs, it helps bypass the safeguard mechanism. Yet the output is factually harmful since the LLM cannot fabricate fallacious solutions but proposes truthful ones. We evaluate our approach over five safety-aligned large language models, comparing four previous jailbreak methods, and show that our approach achieves competitive performance with more harmful outputs. We believe the findings could be extended beyond model safety, such as self-verification and... | Yue Zhou, Henry Peng Zou, Barbara Di Eugenio, Yang Zhang |  |

However, the commonly used top-k routing mechanism suffers from redundancy computation and memory costs due to the unbalanced routing. Some experts are overflow, where the exceeding tokens are dropped. While some experts are empty, which are padded with zeros, negatively impacting model performance. To address the dropped tokens and padding, we propose the Rectify-Router, comprising the Intra-GPU Rectification and the Fill-in Rectification. The Intra-GPU Rectification handles dropped tokens, efficiently routing them to experts within the GPU where they are located to avoid inter-GPU communication. The Fill-in Rectification addresses padding by replacing padding tokens with the tokens that have high routing scores. Our experimental results demonstrate that the Intra-GPU Rectification and the Fill-in Rectification effectively handle dropped tokens and padding,... | Zhiyuan Zeng, Qipeng Guo, Zhaoye Fei, Zhangyue Yin, Yunhua Zhou, Linyang Li, Tianxiang Sun, Hang Yan, Dahua Lin, Xipeng Qiu |  |

We propose null-shot prompting, a counter-intuitive approach where we intentionally instruct LLMs to look at and utilize information from a null section. We investigate null-shot prompting on a wide range of tasks, including arithmetic reasoning, commonsense reasoning, and reading comprehension. We observe a substantial increase in performance in arithmetic reasoning tasks for various models, with up to a 44.62% increase compared to a baseline in one model. Therefore, we investigate deeper into this task by utilizing a more challenging mathematics problem-solving benchmark. We observe that LLMs benefit from hallucination in null-shot prompting in this task and discuss the mathematical topics that benefit the most from introducing hallucination in the prompt.

However, the questions people ask are dependent on their informational needs and prior knowledge about the image content. To evaluate how situating images within naturalistic contexts shapes visual questions, we introduce CommVQA, a VQA dataset consisting of images, image descriptions, real-world communicative scenarios where the image might appear (e.g., a travel website), and follow-up questions and answers conditioned on the scenario and description. CommVQA, which contains 1000 images and 8,949 question-answer pairs, poses a challenge for current models. Error analyses and a human-subjects study suggest that generated answers still contain high rates of hallucinations, fail to fittingly address unanswerable questions, and don’t suitably reflect contextual information. | Nandita Naik, Christopher Potts, Elisa Kreiss |  |

It achieves this goal by using an existing smaller model for drafting and then employing the target LLM to verify the draft in a low-cost parallel manner. Under such a drafting-verification framework, drafting efficiency has become a bottleneck in the final speedup of speculative decoding. Therefore, generating longer drafts at less cost can lead to better decoding speedup. To achieve this, we introduce Ouroboros, which can generate draft phrases to parallelize the drafting process and meanwhile lengthen drafts in a training-free manner. The experimental results on various typical text generation tasks show that Ouroboros can achieve speedups of up to 2.4× over speculative decoding and 3.9× over vanilla decoding, without fine-tuning draft and target models.

Despite their capabilities, they exhibit inconsistencies in handling identical queries in different languages, presenting challenges for further advancement. This paper introduces a method to enhance the multilingual performance of LLMs by aggregating knowledge from diverse languages. This approach incorporates a low-resource knowledge detector specific to a language, a strategic language selection process, and mechanisms for answer replacement and integration. Our extensive experiments demonstrate notable performance improvements, particularly in reducing the performance disparity across languages. An ablation study confirms that each component of our method significantly contributes to these enhancements.

A Self-Imitation Learning Perspective](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.744) |  | 0 | This paper introduces a novel generalized self-imitation learning GSIL framework, which effectively and efficiently aligns large language models with offline demonstration data. We develop GSIL by deriving a surrogate objective of imitation learning with density ratio estimates, facilitating the use of self-generated data and optimizing the imitation learning objective with simple classification losses. GSIL eliminates the need for complex adversarial training in standard imitation learning, achieving lightweight and efficient fine-tuning for large language models. In addition, GSIL encompasses a family of offline losses parameterized by a general class of convex functions for density ratio estimation and enables a unified view for alignment with demonstration data. Extensive experiments show that GSIL consistently and significantly outperforms baselines in many challenging benchmarks, such as coding (HuamnEval), mathematical reasoning (GSM8K) and instruction-following benchmark... | Teng Xiao, Mingxiao Li, Yige Yuan, Huaisheng Zhu, Chao Cui, Vasant G.

Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate superior performance across multiple tasks, including TST. However, in zero-shot setups, they tend to directly copy a significant portion of the input text to the output without effectively changing its style. To enhance the stylistic variety and fluency of the text, we present sNeuron-TST, a novel approach for steering LLMs using style-specific neurons in TST. Specifically, we identify neurons associated with the source and target styles and deactivate source-style-only neurons to give target-style words a higher probability, aiming to enhance the stylistic diversity of the generated text. However, we find that this deactivation negatively impacts the fluency of the generated text, which we address by proposing an improved contrastive decoding method that accounts for rapid token probability shifts across layers caused by deactivated... | Wen Lai, Viktor Hangya, Alexander Fraser |  |

It decontexualizes conversational queries into self-contained questions suitable for off-the-shelf retrievers. Existing methods attempt to incorporate retriever’s preference during the training of rewriting models. However, these approaches typically rely on extensive annotations such as in-domain rewrites and/or relevant passage labels, limiting the models’ generalization and adaptation capabilities. In this paper, we introduce AdaQR (Adaptive Query Rewriting), a framework for training query rewriting models with limited rewrite annotations from seed datasets and completely no passage label. Our approach begins by fine-tuning compact large language models using only 10% of rewrite annotations from the seed dataset training split. The models are then utilized to self-sample rewrite candidates for each query instance, further eliminating the expense for human labeling or... | Tianhua Zhang, Kun Li, Hongyin Luo, Xixin Wu, James R.

Despite considerable advancements, existing models predominantly require extensive annotated training data, which is both costly and labor-intensive to collect. Moreover, these models often struggle to adapt to new or unseen relations. Few-shot learning, aiming to lessen annotation demands, typically provides incomplete and biased supervision for target relations, leading to degraded and unstable performance. To accurately and explicitly describe relation semantics while minimizing annotation demands, we explore the definition only zero-shot RE setting where only relation definitions expressed in natural language are used to train a RE model. We introduce REPaL, comprising three stages: (1) We leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate initial seed instances from relation definitions and an unlabeled corpus.

Second, examples in DA-Code are all based on real and diverse data, covering a wide range of complex data wrangling and analytics tasks. Third, to solve the tasks, the models must utilize complex data science programming languages, including Python and SQL, to perform intricate data processing and derive the answers.

However, most existing methods focus on either only the changed lines or nearest context lines, without considering the effectiveness of selecting useful contexts. On the other hand, it is possible that introducing excessive contexts can lead to noise. To this end, we propose a code model COMMIT (Context-aware prOMpting based comMIt-message generaTion) in conjunction with a code dataset CODEC (COntext and metaData Enhanced Code dataset). Leveraging program slicing, CODEC consolidates code changes along with related contexts via property graph analysis. Further, utilizing CodeT5+ as the backbone model, we train COMMIT via context-aware prompt on CODEC.

We prompted GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 with text by native speakers of each variety and analyzed the responses via detailed linguistic feature annotation and native speaker evaluation. We find that the models default to “standard” varieties of English; based on evaluation by native speakers, we also find that model responses to non-”standard” varieties consistently exhibit a range of issues: stereotyping (19% worse than for “standard” varieties), demeaning content (25% worse), lack of comprehension (9% worse), and condescending responses (15% worse). Moreover, if these models are asked to imitate the writing style of prompts in non-”standard” varieties, they produce text that exhibits lower comprehension of the input and is especially prone to stereotyping.... | Eve Fleisig, Genevieve Smith, Madeline Bossi, Ishita Rustagi, Xavier Yin, Dan Klein |  |

Lifelong model editing is the most challenging task that caters to the continuous editing requirements of LLMs. Prior works primarily focus on single or batch editing; nevertheless, these methods fall short in lifelong editing scenarios due to catastrophic knowledge forgetting and the degradation of model performance. Although retrieval-based methods alleviate these issues, they are impeded by slow and cumbersome processes of integrating the retrieved knowledge into the model. In this work, we introduce RECIPE, a RetriEval-augmented ContInuous Prompt lEarning method, to boost editing efficacy and inference efficiency in lifelong learning. RECIPE first converts knowledge statements into short and informative continuous prompts, prefixed to the LLM’s input query embedding, to efficiently refine the response grounded on the knowledge.

The training paradigms for version updates of LLMs include pre-training from scratch (PTFS) and continual pre-training (CPT). Preliminary experiments demonstrate that PTFS achieves better pre-training performance, while CPT has lower training cost. Moreover, their performance and training cost gaps widen progressively with version updates. To investigate the underlying reasons for this phenomenon, we analyze the effect of learning rate adjustments during the two stages of CPT: preparing an initialization checkpoint and continual pre-training based on this checkpoint. We find that a large learning rate in the first stage and a complete learning rate decay process in the second stage are crucial for version updates of LLMs. Hence, we propose a learning rate path switching training paradigm. Our paradigm comprises one main path, where we pre-train a LLM... | Zhihao Wang, Shiyu Liu, Jianheng Huang, Wang Zheng, Yixuan Liao, Xiaoxin Chen, Junfeng Yao, Jinsong Su |  |

However, in realistic scenarios, this is rarely the case and the documents to be retrieved are constantly updated and added. In this paper, we focus on Generative Retrievals (GR), which apply autoregressive language models to IR problems, and explore their adaptability and robustness in dynamic scenarios. We also conduct an extensive evaluation of computational and memory efficiency, crucial factors for real-world deployment of IR systems handling vast and ever-changing document collections. Our results on the StreamingQA benchmark demonstrate that GR is more adaptable to evolving knowledge (4–11%), robust in learning knowledge with temporal information, and efficient in terms of inference FLOPs (x2), indexing time (x6), and storage footprint (x4) compared to Dual Encoders (DE), which are commonly used in retrieval systems.

To address this challenge, we present OneNet, an innovative framework that utilizes the few-shot learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) without the need for fine-tuning. To the best of our knowledge, this marks a pioneering approach to applying LLMs to few-shot entity linking tasks. OneNet is structured around three key components prompted by LLMs: (1) an entity reduction processor that simplifies inputs by summarizing and filtering out irrelevant entities, (2) a dual-perspective entity linker that combines contextual cues and prior knowledge for precise entity linking, and (3) an entity consensus judger that employs a unique... | Xukai Liu, Ye Liu, Kai Zhang, Kehang Wang, Qi Liu, Enhong Chen |  |

To avoid providing hallucinated answers to these unknown questions, existing studies typically investigate approaches to refusing to answer these questions. In this work, we propose a novel and scalable self-alignment method to utilize the LLM itself to enhance its response-ability to different types of unknown questions, being capable of not just refusing to answer but further proactively providing explanations to the unanswerability of unknown questions. Specifically, the Self-Align method first employ a two-stage class-aware self-augmentation approach to generate a large amount of unknown question-response data. Then we conduct disparity-driven self-curation to select qualified data for fine-tuning the LLM itself for aligning the responses to unknown questions as desired.... | Yang Deng, Yong Zhao, Moxin Li, SeeKiong Ng, TatSeng Chua |  |

In this work, we propose CoT-Influx, a novel approach that pushes the boundary of few-shot Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT) learning to improve LLM mathematical reasoning. Motivated by the observation that adding more concise CoT examples in the prompt can improve LLM reasoning performance, CoT-Influx employs a coarse-to-fine pruner to maximize the input of effective and concise CoT examples. The pruner first selects as many crucial CoT examples as possible and then prunes unimportant tokens to fit the context window. As a result, by enabling more CoT examples with double the context window size in tokens, CoT-Influx significantly outperforms various prompting baselines across various LLMs (LLaMA2-7B, 13B, 70B) and 5 math datasets, achieving up to 4.55% absolute improvements.

Existing works mainly adopt the close-ended question-answering (QA) task with answer options for evaluation. However, many clinical decisions involve answering open-ended questions without pre-set options. To better understand LLMs in the clinic, we construct a benchmark ClinicBench. We first collect eleven existing datasets covering diverse clinical language generation, understanding, and reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we construct six novel datasets and clinical tasks that are complex but common in real-world practice, e.g., open-ended decision-making, long document processing, and emerging drug analysis.

Existing works primarily treat LLMs’ activations as points in space and modify them by adding steering vectors. We show that doing so would break the magnitude consistency of the activation vectors in LLMs. To overcome this shortcoming, we propose a novel editing method that views activations in terms of their directions and magnitudes.

This challenge becomes critical in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with knowledge bases, as emerging expressions hinder the retrieval of relevant documents, leading to generator hallucinations. To address this issue, we introduce a novel task aimed at resolving emerging mentions to dynamic entities and present DynamicER benchmark. Our benchmark includes dynamic entity mention resolution and entity-centric knowledge-intensive QA task, evaluating entity linking and RAG model’s adaptability to new expressions, respectively. We discovered that current entity linking models struggle to link these new expressions to entities. Therefore, we propose a temporal segmented clustering method with continual adaptation, effectively managing the temporal dynamics of evolving entities and emerging mentions. Extensive experiments demonstrate... | Jinyoung Kim, Dayoon Ko, Gunhee Kim |  |

In this work, we introduce a novel method that leverages often-discarded language model heads. By employing these components via a mutual information maximization strategy, our approach helps maintain prior knowledge from the pre-trained backbone and strategically aligns the primary classification head, thereby enhancing model performance. Furthermore, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs), renowned for their wealth of knowledge, in addressing FCRE challenges. Our comprehensive experimental results underscore the efficacy of the proposed method and offer valuable insights for future work. | Quyen Tran, Nguyen Xuan Thanh, Nguyen Hoang Anh, Nam Le Hai, Trung Le, Linh Van Ngo, Thien Huu Nguyen |  |

However, a thorough evaluation of these models is crucial before deploying them in real-world applications to ensure they produce reliable performance. Despite the well-established importance of evaluating LLMs in the community, the complexity of the evaluation process has led to varied evaluation setups, causing inconsistencies in findings and interpretations. To address this, we systematically review the primary challenges and limitations causing these inconsistencies and unreliable evaluations in various steps of LLM evaluation. Based on our critical review, we present our perspectives and recommendations to ensure LLM evaluations are reproducible, reliable, and robust. | Md. Tahmid Rahman Laskar, Sawsan Alqahtani, M.

Despite all these practical expectations, existing model editing methods fail to realize all of them. Furthermore, the memory demands for such sequential model editing approaches tend to be prohibitive, frequently necessitating an external memory that grows incrementally over time. To cope with these challenges, we propose CoachHooK, a model editing method that simultaneously supports sequential and batch editing. CoachHooK is memory-friendly as it only needs a small amount of it to store several hook layers whose size remains unchanged over time. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over other batch-supportive model editing methods under both single-round and consecutive batch editing scenarios. Extensive analyses of CoachHooK... | Shuaiyi Li, Yang Deng, Deng Cai, Hongyuan Lu, Liang Chen, Wai Lam |  |

Nevertheless, challenges persist when ORE is performed on specific topics. Existing methods give sub-optimal results in five dimensions: factualness, topic relevance, informativeness, coverage, and uniformity. To improve topic-oriented ORE, we propose a zero-shot approach called PriORE: Open Relation Extraction with a Priori seed generation. PriORE leverages the built-in knowledge of LLMs to maintain a dynamic seed relation dictionary for the topic. The dictionary is initialized by seed relations generated from topic-relevant entity types and expanded during contextualized ORE. PriORE then reduces the randomness in generative ORE by converting it to a more robust relation classification task. Experiments show the approach empowers better topic-oriented control over the generated relations and thus improves ORE performance along the... | Linyi Ding, Jinfeng Xiao, Sizhe Zhou, Chaoqi Yang, Jiawei Han |  |

This challenging nature of literature review writing makes automatic related work generation (RWG) academically and computationally interesting, and also makes it an excellent test bed for examining the capability of SOTA natural language processing (NLP) models. Since the initial proposal of the RWG task, its popularity has waxed and waned, following the capabilities of mainstream NLP approaches. In this work, we survey the zoo of RWG historical works, summarizing the key approaches and task definitions and discussing the ongoing challenges of RWG. | Xiangci Li, Jessica Ouyang |  |

However, models augmented with CL often face challenges in optimizing consistency features, which can detract from their efficiency and effectiveness. To address these challenges, we introduce Curriculum Consistency Learning (CCL), a novel strategy that guides models to learn consistency in alignment with their current capacity to differentiate between features. CCL is designed around the inherent aspects of CL-related losses, promoting task independence and simplifying implementation. Implemented across four representative CSG tasks, including instruction tuning (IT) for large language models and machine translation (MT) in three modalities (text, speech, and vision), CCL demonstrates marked improvements. Specifically, it delivers +2.0 average accuracy point improvement... | Liangxin Liu, Xuebo Liu, Lian Lian, Shengjun Cheng, Jun Rao, Tengfei Yu, Hexuan Deng, Min Zhang |  |

In this paper, we consider the case of syllogistic reasoning, an area of deductive reasoning studied extensively in logic and cognitive psychology. Previous research has shown that pre-trained LLMs exhibit reasoning biases, such as content effects, avoid answering that no conclusion follows, align with human difficulties, and struggle with multi-step reasoning. We contribute to this research line by systematically investigating the effects of chain-of-thought reasoning, in-context learning (ICL), and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on syllogistic reasoning, considering syllogisms with conclusions that support or violate world knowledge and with multiple premises. Crucially, we go beyond the standard focus on accuracy, with an in-depth analysis of the conclusions generated by the models. Our results suggest that the behavior of pre-trained LLMs can be explained by heuristics studied in... | Leonardo Bertolazzi, Albert Gatt, Raffaella Bernardi |  |

However, existing speech FMs (SFMs) fall short of full compliance with the open-source principles, even if claimed otherwise, as no existing SFM has model weights, code, and training data publicly available under open-source terms. In this work, we take the first step toward filling this gap by focusing on the 24 official languages of the European Union (EU). We collect suitable training data by surveying automatic speech recognition datasets and unlabeled speech corpora under open-source compliant licenses, for a total of 950k hours. Additionally, we release automatic transcripts for 441k hours of unlabeled data under the permissive CC-BY license, thereby facilitating the creation of open-source SFMs for the EU languages. | Marco Gaido, Sara Papi, Luisa Bentivogli, Alessio Brutti, Mauro Cettolo, Roberto Gretter, Marco Matassoni, Mohamed Nabih, Matteo Negri |  |

Recently, Contrastive Learning (CL) has been introduced to Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC), significantly improving the discriminative capabilities of KGC models and setting new benchmarks in performance. However, existing contrastive methods primarily focus on individual triples, overlooking the broader structural connectivities and topologies of KGs. This narrow focus limits a comprehensive understanding of the graph’s structural knowledge. To address this gap, we propose StructKGC, a novel contrastive learning framework designed to flexibly accommodate the diverse topologies inherent in KGs. We introduce four contrastive tasks specifically tailored to KG data: Vertex-level CL, Neighbor-level CL, Path-level CL, and Relation composition level CL. These tasks are trained synergistically during the fine-tuning of pre-trained language models (PLMs), allowing for a more nuanced capture of... | Jiashi Lin, Lifang Wang, Xinyu Lu, Zhongtian Hu, Wei Zhang, Wenxuan Lu |  |

In this paper, we propose a novel framework called TRoTR that relies on the notion of topic relatedness for evaluating the diachronic change of context in which text is reused. TRoTR includes two NLP tasks: TRiC and TRaC. TRiC is designed to evaluate the topic relatedness between a pair of recontextualizations. TRaC is designed to evaluate the overall topic variation within a set of recontextualizations. We also provide a curated TRoTR benchmark of biblical text reuse, human-annotated with topic relatedness. The benchmark exhibits an inter-annotator agreement of .811. We evaluate multiple, established SBERT models on the TRoTR tasks and find that they exhibit greater sensitivity to textual similarity than topic relatedness. Our experiments show that fine-tuning these models can mitigate such a kind of sensitivity. | Francesco Periti, Pierluigi Cassotti, Stefano Montanelli, Nina Tahmasebi, Dominik Schlechtweg |  |

Network pruning provides a practical solution to this problem. However, existing pruning works for LLMs mainly focus on unstructured pruning or necessitate post-pruning fine-tuning. The former relies on special hardware to accelerate computation, while the latter may need substantial computational resources. In this paper, we introduce a retraining-free structured pruning method called SoBP (Structured Optimal Brain Pruning). It leverages global first-order information to select pruning structures, then refines them with a local greedy approach, and finally adopts module-wise reconstruction to mitigate information loss. We assess the effectiveness of SoBP across 14 models from 3 LLM families on 8 distinct datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SoBP outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. | Jiateng Wei, Quan Lu, Ning Jiang, Siqi Li, Jingyang Xiang, Jun Chen, Yong Liu |  |

In this paper, we delve into the generation of dictionary-like sense definitions and explore their utility for modeling word meaning. We fine-tuned two Llama models and include an existing T5-based model in our evaluation. Firstly, we evaluate the quality of the generated definitions on existing English benchmarks, setting new state-of-the-art results for the Definition Generation task. Next, we explore the use of definitions generated by our models as intermediate representations subsequently encoded as sentence embeddings. We evaluate this approach on lexical semantics tasks such as the Word-in-Context, Word Sense Induction, and Lexical Semantic Change, setting new state-of-the-art results in all three tasks when compared to unsupervised baselines. | Francesco Periti, David Alfter, Nina Tahmasebi |  |

Empowering Code Instruction Tuning with Really Good Data](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.777) |  | 0 | Recently, there has been a growing interest in studying how to construct better code instruction tuning data. However, we observe Code models trained with these datasets exhibit high performance on HumanEval but perform worse on other benchmarks such as LiveCodeBench. Upon further investigation, we find that many datasets suffer from severe data leakage. After cleaning up most of the leaked data, some well-known high-quality datasets perform poorly. This discovery reveals a new challenge: identifying which dataset genuinely qualify as high-quality code instruction data. To address this, we propose an efficient code data pruning strategy for selecting good samples. Our approach is based on three dimensions: instruction complexity, response quality, and instruction diversity. Based on our selected data, we present XCoder, a family of models finetuned from LLaMA3.

However, existing IR benchmarks focus on a limited scope of tasks, making them insufficient for evaluating the latest IR models. In this paper, we propose MAIR (Massive Instructed Retrieval Benchmark), a heterogeneous IR benchmark that includes 126 distinct IR tasks across 6 domains, collected from existing datasets. We benchmark state-of-the-art instruction-tuned text embedding models and re-ranking models. Our experiments reveal that instruction-tuned models generally achieve superior performance compared to non-instruction-tuned models on MAIR Additionally, our results suggest that current instruction-tuned text embedding models and re-ranking models still lack effectiveness in specific long-tail tasks.

Existing studies evaluate ICL methods primarily based on downstream task performance. This evaluation protocol overlooks the significant cost associated with the demonstration configuration process, i.e., tuning the demonstration as the ICL prompt. However, in this work, we point out that the evaluation protocol leads to unfair comparisons and potentially biased evaluation, because we surprisingly find the correlation between the configuration costs and task performance. Then we call for a two-dimensional evaluation paradigm that considers both of these aspects, facilitating a fairer comparison.Finally, based on our empirical finding that the optimized demonstration on one language model generalizes across language models of different sizes, we introduce a simple yet efficient strategy that can be applied to any... | Guoxin Yu, Lemao Liu, Mo Yu, Yue Yu, Xiang Ao |  |

To extract the encoded knowledge in these models without (potentially) biased human labels, unsupervised probing techniques like Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS) have been developed (Burns et al., 2022). However, salient but unrelated features in activation space can mislead these probes (Farquhar et al., 2023). Addressing this, we propose a cluster-normalization method to minimize the impact of such features by clustering and normalizing activations of contrast pairs before applying unsupervised probing techniques. While this approach does not address the issue of distinguishing between latent knowledge and that portrayed by a simulated agent—a major issue in the literature of eliciting latent knowledge (Paul Christiano and Xu, 2021)—it still significantly improves the accuracy of probes in identifying the intended knowledge amidst... | Walter Laurito, Sharan Maiya, Grégoire Dhimoïla, Owen Yeung, Kaarel Hänni |  |

Motivated by this, we study how LLMs answer multi-hop queries such as “The spouse of the performer of Imagine is”. These queries require two information extraction steps: a latent one for resolving the first hop (“the performer of Imagine”) into the bridge entity (John Lennon), and another for resolving the second hop (“the spouse of John Lennon”) into the target entity (Yoko Ono). Understanding how the latent step is computed internally is key to understanding the overall computation. By carefully analyzing the internal computations of transformer-based LLMs, we discover that the bridge entity is resolved in the early layers of the model. Then, only after this resolution, the two-hop query is solved in the later layers. Because the second hop commences in later layers, there could be cases where these layers no longer encode the necessary... | Eden Biran, Daniela Gottesman, Sohee Yang, Mor Geva, Amir Globerson |  |

Training data attribution (TDA) methods are considered effective solutions to address these challenges.Most recent TDA methods rely on influence functions, assuming the model achieves minimized empirical risk. However, achieving this criterion is difficult, and sourcing accuracy can be compromised by fitting errors during model training. In this paper, we introduce a novel TDA method called Debias and Denoise Attribution (DDA), which enhances influence functions by addressing fitting errors. Specifically, the debias strategy seeks to improve the performance of influence functions by eliminating the knowledge bias present in the base model before fine-tuning, while the denoise strategy aims to reduce discrepancies in influence scores arising from varying degrees of fitting during the training process... | Kangxi Wu, Liang Pang, Huawei Shen, Xueqi Cheng |  |

Large Language Models Wandering between Semantics and Structures in Long Contexts](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.783) |  | 0 | As the utilization of Large Language Models (LLMs) becomes more widespread, there is a growing demand for their ability to handle more complex and longer external knowledge across various use cases. Most existing evaluations of the open-ended question answering (ODQA) task, which necessitates the use of external knowledge, focus solely on whether the model provides the correct answer. However, even when LLMs answer correctly, they often fail to provide an obvious source for their responses. Therefore, it is necessary to jointly evaluate and verify the correctness of the answers and the appropriateness of grounded evidence in complex external contexts. To address this issue, we examine the phenomenon of discrepancies in abilities across two distinct tasks—QA and evidence selection—when performed simultaneously, from the perspective of task alignment. To verify LLMs’ task alignment, we introduce a verification framework and resources considering both semantic relevancy and structural... | Seonmin Koo, Jinsung Kim, YoungJoon Jang, Chanjun Park, Heuiseok Lim |  |

Nevertheless, such domain-specific fine-tuning data often contains contextually sensitive personally identifiable information (PII). Direct fine-tuning LLMs on this data without privacy protection poses a risk of data leakage of sensitive PII during inference time. To address this challenge, we introduce Contextual Privacy Protection Language Models (CPPLM), a novel paradigm for fine-tuning LLMs that effectively injects domain-specific knowledge while safeguarding inference-time data privacy.

Each skill has unique characteristics, and these datasets are often heterogeneous and imbalanced, making the fine-tuning process highly challenging. Balancing the development of each skill while ensuring the model maintains its overall performance requires sophisticated techniques and careful dataset curation. In this work, we propose a general, model-agnostic, reinforcement learning framework, Mixture-of-Skills (MoS), that learns to optimize data usage automatically during the fine-tuning process. This framework ensures the optimal comprehensive skill development of LLMs by dynamically adjusting the focus on different datasets based on their current learning state. To validate the effectiveness of MoS, we conduct extensive experiments using three diverse LLM backbones on... | Minghao Wu, ThuyTrang Vu, Lizhen Qu, Reza Haf |  |

This interest particularly extends to chemical language representation learning, which involves pre-training Transformers on SMILES sequences - textual descriptors of molecules. Despite its success in molecular property prediction, current practices often lead to overfitting and limited scalability due to early convergence. In this paper, we introduce a novel chemical language representation learning framework, called MolTRES, to address these issues. MolTRES incorporates generator-discriminator training, allowing the model to learn from more challenging examples that require structural understanding. In addition, we enrich molecular representations by transferring knowledge from scientific literature by integrating external materials embedding.

We report on the systematic strategy that LMs use in this process.Our controlled experiments reveal that LMs rely more heavily on heuristics, such as lexical overlap, in the earlier stages of reasoning when more steps are required to reach an answer. Conversely, their reliance on heuristics decreases as LMs progress closer to the final answer. This suggests that LMs track only a limited number of future steps and dynamically combine heuristic strategies with rational ones in solving tasks involving multi-step reasoning. | Yoichi Aoki, Keito Kudo, Tatsuki Kuribayashi, Shusaku Sone, Masaya Taniguchi, Keisuke Sakaguchi, Kentaro Inui |  |

However, most ontologies and surveys of tool-use have assumed the core challenge for LLMs is choosing the tool. Instead, we introduce a framework for tools more broadly which guides us to explore a model’s ability to detect “silent” tool errors, and reflect on how to plan. This more directly aligns with the increasingly popular use of models as tools. We provide an initial approach to failure recovery with promising results both on a controlled calculator setting and embodied agent planning. | Jimin Sun, So Yeon Min, Yingshan Chang, Yonatan Bisk |  |

Driven by advances in pre-trained language models and contrastive learning, leading sentence representation methods have reached an average Spearman’s correlation score of approximately 86 across seven STS benchmarks in SentEval. However, further progress has become increasingly marginal, with no existing method attaining an average score higher than 86.5 on these tasks. This paper conducts an in-depth analysis of this phenomenon and concludes that the upper limit for Spearman’s correlation scores under contrastive learning is 87.5. To transcend this ceiling, we propose an innovative approach termed Pcc-tuning, which employs Pearson’s correlation coefficient as a loss function to refine model performance beyond contrastive learning. Experimental results demonstrate that Pcc-tuning can markedly surpass... | Bowen Zhang, Chunping Li |  |

However, achieving zero-shot cross-lingual transfer for SP remains challenging, leading to a performance gap between source and target languages. In this study, we propose Cross-Lingual Back-Parsing (CBP), a novel data augmentation methodology designed to enhance cross-lingual transfer for SP. Leveraging the representation geometry of the mPLMs, CBP synthesizes target language utterances from source meaning representations. Our methodology effectively performs cross-lingual data augmentation in challenging zero-resource settings, by utilizing only labeled data in the source language and monolingual corpora. Extensive experiments on two cross-language SP benchmarks (Mschema2QA and Xspider) demonstrate that CBP brings substantial gains in the target language. Further analysis of the synthesized utterances... | Deokhyung Kang, Seonjeong Hwang, Yunsu Kim, Gary Geunbae Lee |  |

We test models up to 3B parameters under controlled conditions, showing that Mamba-based VLMs outperforms Transformers-based VLMs in captioning, question answering, and reading comprehension. However, we find that Transformers achieve greater performance in visual grounding and the performance gap widens with scale. We explore two hypotheses to explain this phenomenon: 1) the effect of task-agnostic visual encoding on the updates of the hidden states, and 2) the difficulty in performing visual grounding from the perspective of in-context multimodal retrieval. Our results indicate that a task-aware encoding yields minimal performance gains on grounding, however, Transformers significantly outperform Mamba at in-context multimodal retrieval. Overall, Mamba shows promising performance on tasks... | Georgios Pantazopoulos, Malvina Nikandrou, Alessandro Suglia, Oliver Lemon, Arash Eshghi |  |

Detecting and classifying them is a crucial NLP task to prevent misinformation, manipulative claims, and biased decisions. However, existing fallacy classifiers are limited by the requirement for sufficient labeled data for training, which hinders their out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization abilities. In this paper, we focus on leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for zero-shot fallacy classification. To elicit fallacy-related knowledge and reasoning abilities of LLMs, we propose diverse single-round and multi-round prompting schemes, applying different taskspecific instructions such as extraction, summarization, and Chain-of-Thought reasoning. With comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we suggest that LLMs could be potential zero-shot fallacy classifiers. In general, LLMs under single-round prompting schemes have achieved acceptable zeroshot performances compared to the best fullshot baselines and can... | Fengjun Pan, Xiaobao Wu, Zongrui Li, Anh Tuan Luu |  |

This importance stems not only from the better utilization of this capability across various tasks, but also from the proactive identification and mitigation of potential risks, including concerns regarding truthfulness, bias, and toxicity, that may arise alongside the capability. In this paper, we present a thorough survey on the interpretation and analysis of in-context learning. First, we provide a concise introduction to the background and definition of in-context learning. Then, we give an overview of advancements from two perspectives: 1) a theoretical perspective, emphasizing studies on mechanistic interpretability and delving into the mathematical foundations behind ICL; and 2) an empirical perspective, concerning studies that empirically analyze factors associated with ICL. We conclude by discussing open... | Yuxiang Zhou, Jiazheng Li, Yanzheng Xiang, Hanqi Yan, Lin Gui, Yulan He |  |

SemEval-2020 Task 1 provided the first and to date largest manually annotated, diachronic WUG dataset. In this paper, we check the robustness and correctness of the annotations by continuing the SemEval annotation algorithm for two more rounds and comparing against an established annotation paradigm. Further, we test the reproducibility by resampling a new, smaller set of word uses from the SemEval source corpora and annotating them. Our work contributes to a better understanding of the problems and opportunities of the WUG annotation paradigm and points to future improvements. | Dominik Schlechtweg, Pierluigi Cassotti, Bill Noble, David Alfter, Sabine Schulte im Walde, Nina Tahmasebi |  |

It is believed that fine-tuning the parameters of VLMs with few-shot samples corrupts the pre-trained knowledge since fine-tuning the CLIP model even degrades performance. In this paper, we revisit this viewpoint, and propose a new perspective: fine-tuning the specific parameters instead of all will uncover the power of classic model fine-tuning on VLMs. Through our meticulous study, we propose ClipFit, a simple yet effective method to fine-tune CLIP without introducing any overhead of extra parameters. We demonstrate that by only fine-tuning the specific bias terms and normalization layers, ClipFit can improve the performance of zero-shot CLIP by 7.27% average harmonic mean accuracy. Lastly, to understand how fine-tuning in CLIPFit affects the pre-trained models, we conducted... | Ming Li, Jike Zhong, Chenxin Li, Liuzhuozheng Li, Nie Lin, Masashi Sugiyama |  |

In this work, we focus on the generation of entity-centric information-seeking questions from videos. Such a system could be useful for video-based learning, recommending “People Also Ask” questions, video-based chatbots, and fact-checking. Our work addresses three key challenges: identifying question-worthy information, linking it to entities, and effectively utilizing multimodal signals. Further, to the best of our knowledge, there does not exist a large-scale dataset for this task. Most video question generation datasets are on TV shows, movies, or human activities or lack entity-centric information-seeking questions. Hence, we contribute a diverse dataset of YouTube videos, VideoQuestions, consisting of 411 videos with 2265 manually annotated questions. We further propose a model architecture combining Transformers,... | Arpan Phukan, Manish Gupta, Asif Ekbal |  |

This task is widely utilized in educational settings across various domains and subjects. The effectiveness of these questions in assessments relies on the quality of the distractors, as they challenge examinees to select the correct answer from a set of misleading options. The evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has transitioned the task from traditional methods to the use of neural networks and pre-trained language models. This shift has established new benchmarks and expanded the use of advanced deep learning methods in generating distractors. This survey explores distractor generation tasks, datasets, methods, and current evaluation metrics for English objective questions, covering both text-based and multi-modal domains. It also evaluates existing AI models and benchmarks and discusses potential future research... | Elaf Alhazmi, Quan Sheng, Wei Emma Zhang, Munazza Zaib, Ahoud Alhazmi |  |

In this work, we investigate the extent to which modern LMs generate n-grams from their training data, evaluating both (i) the probability LMs assign to complete training n-grams and (ii) n-novelty, the proportion of n-grams generated by an LM that did not appear in the training data (for arbitrarily large n). To enable arbitrary-length n-gram search over a corpus in constant time w.r.t. corpus size, we develop Rusty-DAWG, a novel search tool inspired by indexing of genomic data. We compare the novelty of LM-generated text to human-written text and explore factors that affect generation novelty, focusing on the Pythia models. We find that, for n > 4, LM-generated text is less novel than human-written text, though it is more novel for smaller n. Larger LMs and more constrained decoding strategies both decrease novelty. Finally, we show that LMs complete n-grams with lower loss if they are more... | William Merrill, Noah A. Smith, Yanai Elazar |  |

To help address this, we introduce ASL STEM Wiki: a parallel corpus of 254 Wikipedia articles on STEM topics in English, interpreted into over 300 hours of American Sign Language (ASL). ASL STEM Wiki is the first continuous signing dataset focused on STEM, facilitating the development of AI resources for STEM education in ASL.We identify several use cases of ASL STEM Wiki with human-centered applications. For example, because this dataset highlights the frequent use of fingerspelling for technical concepts, which inhibits DHH students’ ability to learn,we develop models to identify fingerspelled words—which can later be used to query for appropriate ASL signs to suggest to interpreters. | Kayo Yin, Chinmay Singh, Fyodor Minakov, Vanessa Milan, Hal Daumé III, Cyril Zhang, Alex Lu, Danielle Bragg |  |

However, correlation methods tend to capture only the ability of metrics to differentiate between good and bad source-translation pairs, overlooking their reliability in distinguishing alternative translations for the same source. In this paper, we confirm that this is indeed the case by showing that current metrics are insensitive to nuanced differences in translation quality. This effect is most pronounced when the quality is high and the variance among alternatives is low. Given this finding, we shift towards detecting high-quality correct translations, an important problem in practical decision-making scenarios where a binary check of correctness is prioritized over a nuanced evaluation of quality. Using the MQM framework as the gold standard, we systematically stress-test the ability of current metrics to identify translations with no errors as... | Sweta Agrawal, António Farinhas, Ricardo Rei, André F.

This is no exception in machine translation (MT), where better handling of language nuances and context-specific variations leads to improved quality. However, preference data based on human feedback can be very expensive to obtain and curate at a large scale. Automatic metrics, on the other hand, can induce preferences, but they might not match human expectations perfectly. In this paper, we propose an approach that leverages the best of both worlds. We first collect sentence-level quality assessments from professional linguists on translations generated by multiple high-quality MT systems and evaluate the ability of current automatic metrics to recover these preferences. We then use this analysis to curate a new dataset, MT-Pref (metric induced translation preference) dataset, which comprises 18k instances covering 18 language directions, using texts sourced from multiple... | Sweta Agrawal, José Guilherme Camargo de Souza, Ricardo Rei, António Farinhas, Gonçalo Rui Alves Faria, Patrick Fernandes, Nuno Miguel Guerreiro, André F.

However, critical gaps exist in these frameworks: the lack of explicit modeling of dual-task dependencies and the oversight of task-specific semantic differences among utterances. To address these shortcomings, we propose DC-Instruct, a novel generative framework based on Dual-task Inter-dependent Instructions (DII) and Supervised Contrastive Instructions (SCI). Specifically, DII guides large language models (LLMs) to generate labels for one task based on the other task’s labels, thereby explicitly capturing dual-task inter-dependencies. Moreover, SCI leverages utterance semantics differences by guiding LLMs to determine whether a pair of utterances share the same or similar labels. This can improve LLMs on extracting and discriminating task-specific semantics, thus enhancing their SLU reasoning abilities. Extensive experiments on public benchmark... | Bowen Xing, Lizi Liao, Minlie Huang, Ivor W. Tsang |  |

These limitations stem from inadequate knowledge awareness of LLMs during vanilla fine-tuning. To address these problems, we propose a knowledge-aware fine-tuning (KnowTuning) method to improve fine-grained and coarse-grained knowledge awareness of LLMs. We devise a fine-grained knowledge augmentation stage to train LLMs to identify difficult fine-grained knowledge in answers. We also propose a coarse-grained knowledge comparison stage to train LLMs to distinguish between reliable and unreliable knowledge, in three aspects: completeness, factuality, and logicality. Extensive experiments on both generic and medical question answering (QA) datasets confirm the effectiveness of KnowTuning, through automatic and human evaluations,... | Yougang Lyu, Lingyong Yan, Shuaiqiang Wang, Haibo Shi, Dawei Yin, Pengjie Ren, Zhumin Chen, Maarten de Rijke, Zhaochun Ren |  |

Nevertheless, the security of the generated code has raised attention to its potential damage. Existing secure code generation methods have limited generalizability to unseen test cases and poor robustness against the attacked model, leading to safety failures in code generation. In this paper, we propose a generalizable and robust secure code generation method SecCoder by using in-context learning (ICL) and the safe demonstration. The dense retriever is also used to select the most helpful demonstration to maximize the improvement of the generated code’s security. Experimental results show the superior generalizability of the proposed model SecCoder compared to the current secure code generation method, achieving a significant security improvement of an average of 7.20% on unseen test cases.

In particular, among various studies related to CoT, multi-path inference stands out as a simple yet effective improvement. However, there is no optimal setting for the number of inference paths. Therefore, we have to increase the number of inference paths to obtain better results, which in turn increases the inference cost. To address this limitation, we can utilize question-related role templates to guide LLMs into relevant roles, thereby increasing the possibility of correct inferences for each path and further reducing dependence on the number of inference paths while improving reasoning accuracy. However, placing LLMs into specific roles may reduce their reasoning diversity and performance on a few tasks where role dependence is low. To alleviate the excessive immersion of the LLM into a specific role, we propose Nash CoT by constructing a... | Ziqi Zhang, Cunxiang Wang, Xiao Xiong, Yue Zhang, Donglin Wang |  |

In this paper, we find that low-rank pre-training, normally considered as efficient methods that will compromise performance, can be scalably effective when reduced parameters are precisely targeted. Specifically, by applying low-dimensional module only to the attention layer — resolves this issue and enhances both effectiveness and efficiency. We refer to this structure as \*Low-dimensional Projected Attention (LPA)\* and provide an explanatory analysis. Through extensive experimentation at parameter scales of 130M, 370M, and scaling up to 3B, we have validated the effectiveness and scalability of LPA. Our results show that LPA model can save up to 12.4% in time while achieving an approximate 5% improvement in test perplexity (ppl) and on downstream tasks compared with vanilla Transformer. | Xingtai Lv, Ning Ding, Kaiyan Zhang, Ermo Hua, Ganqu Cui, Bowen Zhou |  |

Empowering Small Language Models as Hallucination Detector](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.809) |  | 0 | Hallucination detection is a challenging task for large language models (LLMs), and existing studies heavily rely on powerful closed-source LLMs such as GPT-4. In this paper, we propose an autonomous LLM-based agent framework, called HaluAgent, which enables relatively smaller LLMs (e.g. Baichuan2-Chat 7B) to actively select suitable tools for detecting multiple hallucination types such as text, code, and mathematical expression. In HaluAgent, we integrate the LLM, multi-functional toolbox, and design a fine-grained three-stage detection framework along with memory mechanism. To facilitate the effectiveness of HaluAgent, we leverage existing Chinese and English datasets to synthesize detection trajectories for fine-tuning, which endows HaluAgent with the capability for bilingual hallucination detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that only using 2K samples for tuning LLMs, HaluAgent can perform hallucination detection on various types of tasks and datasets, achieving... | Xiaoxue Cheng, Junyi Li, Xin Zhao, Hongzhi Zhang, Fuzheng Zhang, Di Zhang, Kun Gai, JiRong Wen |  |

Despite the promising progress, their proficiency in compositional reasoning over attributes and relations (e.g., distinguishing between “the car is underneath the person” and “the person is underneath the car”) remains notably inadequate. We investigate the cause for this deficient behavior is the composition attribution issue, where the attribution scores (e.g., attention scores or GradCAM scores) for relations (e.g., underneath) or attributes (e.g., red) in the text are substantially lower than those for object terms. In this work, we show such issue is mitigated via a novel framework called CAE (Composition Attribution Enhancement). This generic framework incorporates various interpretable attribution methods to encourage the model to pay greater attention to composition words denoting relationships and attributes within the text.

When prompted by users, these AI systems successfully perform a wide range of tasks as part of a conversation. To provide some sort of memory and context, such approaches typically condition their output on the entire conversational history. Although this sensitivity to the conversational history can often lead to improved performance on subsequent tasks, we find that performance can in fact also be negatively impacted, if there is a _task-switch_. To the best of our knowledge, our work makes the first attempt to formalize the study of such vulnerabilities and interference of tasks in conversational LLMs caused by task-switches in the conversational history. Our experiments across 5 datasets with 15 task switches using popular LLMs reveal that many of the task-switches can lead to... | Akash Gupta, Ivaxi Sheth, Vyas Raina, Mark J. F.

This paper proposes a novel framework for probing language models for social biases by assessing disparate treatment, which involves treating individuals differently according to their affiliation with a sensitive demographic group. We curate SoFa, a large-scale benchmark designed to address the limitations of existing fairness collections. SoFa expands the analysis beyond the binary comparison of stereotypical versus anti-stereotypical identities to include a diverse range of identities and stereotypes. Comparing our methodology with existing benchmarks, we reveal that biases within language models are more nuanced than acknowledged, indicating a broader scope of encoded biases than previously recognized. Benchmarking LMs on SoFa, we expose how identities expressing... | Marta Marchiori Manerba, Karolina Stanczak, Riccardo Guidotti, Isabelle Augenstein |  |

However, the reliability of the retrieved information is not always guaranteed, and the retrieval of irrelevant data can mislead the response generation. Moreover, standard RALMs frequently neglect their intrinsic knowledge due to the interference from retrieved information. In instances where the retrieved information is irrelevant, RALMs should ideally utilize their intrinsic knowledge or, in the absence of both intrinsic and retrieved knowledge, opt to respond with “unknown” to avoid hallucination. In this paper, we introduces Chain-of-Note (CoN), a novel approach to improve robustness of RALMs in facing noisy, irrelevant documents and in handling unknown scenarios. The core idea of CoN is to generate sequential reading notes for each retrieved document, enabling a thorough evaluation of their relevance to the given question... | Wenhao Yu, Hongming Zhang, Xiaoman Pan, Peixin Cao, Kaixin Ma, Jian Li, Hongwei Wang, Dong Yu |  |

A Dynamic Decision-Making Framework for Large Language Models](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.814) |  | 0 | Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emergent capabilities across diverse reasoning tasks via popular Chains-of-Thought (COT) prompting. However, such a simple and fast COT approach often encounters limitations in dealing with complicated problems, while a thorough method, which considers multiple reasoning pathways and verifies each step carefully, results in slower inference. This paper addresses the challenge of enabling LLMs to autonomously select between fast and slow inference methods, thereby optimizing both efficiency and effectiveness. We introduce a dynamic decision-making framework that categorizes tasks into two distinct pathways: ‘Fast,’ designated for tasks where the LLM quickly identifies a high-confidence solution, and ‘Slow,’ allocated for tasks that the LLM perceives as complex and for which it has low confidence in immediate solutions as well as requiring more reasoning paths to verify. Experiments on five popular reasoning benchmarks demonstrated the... | Jiabao Pan, Yan Zhang, Chen Zhang, Zuozhu Liu, Hongwei Wang, Haizhou Li |  |

Despite recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) for LFTQA, evaluating their effectiveness remains a significant challenge. We introduce LFTQA-Eval, a meta-evaluation dataset comprising 2,988 human-annotated examples, to rigorously assess the efficacy of current automated metrics in assessing LLM-based LFTQA systems, with a focus on faithfulness and comprehensiveness. Our findings reveal that existing automatic metrics poorly correlate with human judgments and fail to consistently differentiate between factually accurate responses and those that are coherent but factually incorrect. Additionally, our in-depth examination of the limitations associated with automated evaluation methods provides essential insights for the improvement of LFTQA automated evaluation. | Yuqi Wang, Lyuhao Chen, Songcheng Cai, Zhijian Xu, Yilun Zhao |  |

Traditional metrics like Exact Match and BertScore poorly reflect model performance, so we trained evaluation models to approximate human evaluation, achieving high agreement. We used them to perform Reinforcement Learning with extraction models to align them with human preference, prioritising semantic understanding. We successfully explored our approach through multiple datasets, including transferring an evaluator trained on one dataset to another as a way to decrease the reliance on human-annotated data. In that vein, we also propose a weak-to-strong supervision method that uses a fraction of the annotated data to train an evaluation model while still achieving high performance in training an RL model. | Italo Luis da Silva, Hanqi Yan, Lin Gui, Yulan He |  |

FinDVer contains 4,000 expert-annotated examples across four subsets, each focusing on a type of scenario that frequently arises in real-world financial domains. We assess a broad spectrum of 25 LLMs under long-context and RAG settings. Our results show that even the current best-performing system (i.e., GPT-4o) significantly lags behind human experts. Our detailed findings and insights highlight the strengths and limitations of existing LLMs in this new task. We believe FinDVer can serve as a valuable benchmark for evaluating LLM capabilities in claim verification over complex, expert-domain documents. | Yilun Zhao, Yitao Long, Tintin Jiang, Chengye Wang, Weiyuan Chen, Hongjun Liu, Xiangru Tang, Yiming Zhang, Chen Zhao, Arman Cohan |  |

We develop a new black-box method, output2prompt, that extracts prompts without access to the model’s logits and without adversarial or jailbreaking queries. Unlike previous methods, output2prompt only needs outputs of normal user queries. To improve memory efficiency, output2prompt employs a new sparse encoding techique. We measure the efficacy of output2prompt on a variety of user and system prompts and demonstrate zero-shot transferability across different LLMs. | Collin Zhang, John X. Morris, Vitaly Shmatikov |  |

However, existing evaluation approaches rely on fixed-form outputs and cannot adapt to the flexible open-text generation scenarios of LLMs (e.g., sentence completion and question answering). To address this, we introduce BiasAlert, a plug-and-play tool designed to detect social bias in open-text generations of LLMs. BiasAlert integrates external human knowledge with its inherent reasoning capabilities to detect bias reliably. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BiasAlert significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods like GPT-4-as-Judge in detecting bias. Furthermore, through application studies, we showcase the utility of BiasAlert in reliable LLM fairness evaluation and bias mitigation across various scenarios. Model and code will be publicly released. | Zhiting Fan, Ruizhe Chen, Ruiling Xu, Zuozhu Liu |  |

However, some works suggest that introducing image information to model does not help improving ASR performance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach effectively utilizing audio-related image information and set up VHASR, a multimodal speech recognition system that uses vision as hotwords to strengthen the model’s speech recognition capability. Our system utilizes a dual-stream architecture, which firstly transcribes the text on the two streams separately, and then combines the outputs. We evaluate the proposed model on four datasets: Flickr8k, ADE20k, COCO, and OpenImages. The experimental results show that VHASR can effectively utilize key information in images to enhance the model’s speech recognition ability. Its performance not only surpasses unimodal ASR, but also achieves SOTA among existing image-based multimodal ASR. | Jiliang Hu, Zuchao Li, Ping Wang, Haojun Ai, Lefei Zhang, Hai Zhao |  |

Research in this field generally consist of two main perspectives: local-level encoding and global-level aggregating, respectively refer to textual node information unification (e.g., using Language Models) and structure-augmented modeling (e.g., using Graph Neural Networks). Most existing works focus on combining different information levels but overlook the interconnections, i.e., the contextual textual information among nodes, which provides semantic insights to bridge local and global levels. In this paper, we propose GraphBridge, a multi-granularity integration framework that bridges local and global perspectives by leveraging contextual textual information, enhancing fine-grained understanding of TAGs. Besides, to tackle scalability and efficiency challenges, we introduce a graph-aware token reduction module.... | Yaoke Wang, Yun Zhu, Wenqiao Zhang, Yueting Zhuang, Liyunfei Liyunfei, Siliang Tang |  |

The resources include the first manually translated news bitext corpus between Portuguese and Emakhuwa, news topic classification datasets, and monolingual data. We detail the process and challenges of acquiring this data and present benchmark results for machine translation and news topic classification tasks. Our evaluation examines the impact of different data types—originally clean text, post-corrected OCR, and back-translated data—and the effects of fine-tuning from pre-trained models, including those focused on African languages.Our benchmarks demonstrate good performance in news topic classification and promising results in machine translation. We fine-tuned multilingual encoder-decoder models using real and synthetic data and evaluated them on our test set and the FLORES evaluation sets.

In this work, we introduce RepMatch, a novel method that characterizes data through the lens of similarity.RepMatch quantifies the similarity between subsets of training instances by comparing the knowledge encoded in models trained on them, overcoming the limitations of existing analysis methods that focus solely on individual instances and are restricted to within-dataset analysis.Our framework allows for a broader evaluation, enabling similarity comparisons across arbitrary subsets of instances, supporting both dataset-to-dataset and instance-to-dataset analyses. We validate the effectiveness of RepMatch across multiple NLP tasks, datasets, and models. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that RepMatch can effectively compare datasets, identify more representative... | Mohammad Modarres, Sina Abbasi, Mohammad Taher Pilehvar |  |

However, the setting of this task overlooks a significant portion of commonsense knowledge based on free-text in the real world, characterized by broad knowledge scope, long content and non instantiation. The editing objects of previous methods (e.g., MEMIT) were single token or entity, which were not suitable for commonsense knowledge in free-text form. To address the aforementioned challenges, we conducted experiments from two perspectives: knowledge localization and knowledge editing. Firstly, we introduced Knowledge Localization for Free-Text(KLFT) method, revealing the challenges associated with the distribution of commonsense knowledge in MLP and Attention layers, as well as in decentralized distribution. Next, we propose a Dynamics-aware Editing Method(DEM), which utilizes a Dynamics-aware Module to locate the parameter positions corresponding to commonsense... | Xiusheng Huang, Yequan Wang, Jun Zhao, Kang Liu |  |

This work presents a large-scale study of political incivility on Twitter. In line with theories of political communication, we differentiate between harsh ‘impolite’ style and intolerant substance. We present a dataset of 13K political tweets in the U.S. context, which we collected and labeled by those categories using crowd sourcing. Our dataset and results shed light on hostile political discourse focused on partisan conflicts in the U.S. The evaluation of state-of-the-art classifiers illustrates the challenges involved in political incivility detection, which often requires high-level semantic and social understanding. Nevertheless, performing incivility detection at scale, we are able to characterise its distribution across individual users and geopolitical regions, where our findings align and extend existing theories of political communication. In particular,... | Sagi Pendzel, Nir Lotan, Alon Zoizner, Einat Minkov |  |

Since most existing clustering methods are solely based on the BERT model, they often fall short in utilizing keyword information, which, however, is very useful in clustering short texts. In this paper, we propose a \*\*CO\*\*-\*\*T\*\*raining \*\*C\*\*lustering (\*\*COTC\*\*) framework to make use of the collective strengths of BERT and TFIDF features. Specifically, we develop two modules responsible for the clustering of BERT and TFIDF features, respectively. We use the deep representations and cluster assignments from the TFIDF module outputs to guide the learning of the BERT module, seeking to align them at both the representation and cluster levels. Reversely, we also use the BERT module outputs to train the TFIDF module, thus leading to the mutual promotion. We then show that the alternating co-training framework can be placed under a unified joint training objective, which allows the... | Zetong Li, Qinliang Su, Shijing Si, Jianxing Yu |  |

However, these works are often disconnected from the impact of such debiasing on downstream applications, which is the main motivation for debiasing in the first place. In this work, we systematically test how methods for intrinsic debiasing affect neural machine translation models, by measuring the extrinsic bias of such systems under different design choices. We highlight three challenges and mismatches between the debiasing techniques and their end-goal usage, including the choice of embeddings to debias, the mismatch between words and sub-word tokens debiasing, and the effect on different target languages. We find that these considerations have a significant impact on downstream performance and the success of debiasing. | Bar Iluz, Yanai Elazar, Asaf Yehudai, Gabriel Stanovsky |  |

It is crucial in a considerable number of fields such as humanities, technical writing and biomedical sciences to enrich texts with semantics and discover more knowledge. The use of Named Entity Disambiguation (NED) in such domains requires handling noisy texts, low resource settings and domain-specific KBs. Existing approaches are mostly inappropriate for such scenarios, as they either depend on training data or are not flexible enough to work with domain-specific KBs. Thus in this work, we present a unsupervised approach leveraging the concept of Group Steiner Trees (GST), which can identify the most relevant candidate for entity disambiguation using the contextual similarities across candidate entities for all the mentions present in a document. We outperform the state-of-the-art unsupervised... | Debarghya Datta, Soumajit Pramanik |  |

Consequently, fine-tuning the entire model becomes a memory-intensive process. High-performance methods for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) typically work with Attention blocks and often overlook MLP blocks, which contain about half of the model parameters. We propose a new selective PEFT method, namely SparseGrad, that performs well on MLP blocks. We transfer layer gradients to a space where only about 1% of the layer’s elements remain significant. By converting gradients into a sparse structure, we reduce the number of updated parameters. We apply SparseGrad to fine-tune BERT and RoBERTa for the NLU task and LLaMa-2 for the Question-Answering task. In these experiments, with identical memory requirements, our method outperforms LoRA and MeProp, robust popular state-of-the-art PEFT approaches. | Viktoria Chekalina, Anna Rudenko, Gleb Mezentsev, Aleksandr Mikhalev, Alexander Panchenko, Ivan V.

However, existing approaches have not effectively combined the structural attributes of knowledge graphs with the textual descriptions of entities to generate robust entity encodings.To address this issue, this paper proposes MoCoKGC (Momentum Contrast Entity Encoding for Knowledge Graph Completion), which incorporates three primary encoders: the entity-relation encoder, the entity encoder, and the momentum entity encoder. Momentum contrastive learning not only provides more negative samples but also allows for the gradual updating of entity encodings. Consequently, we reintroduce the generated entity encodings into the encoder to incorporate the graph’s structural information.Additionally, MoCoKGC enhances the inferential capabilities of the entity-relation encoder through... | Qingyang Li, Yanru Zhong, Yuchu Qin |  |

However, there is still lack of study on how vision language models(VLMs) behave when multi-modal task inputs are considered. Counterfactual planning that evaluates the model’s reasoning ability over alternative task situations are also under exploited. In order to evaluate the planning ability of both multi-modal and counterfactual aspects, we propose ActPlan-1K. ActPlan-1K is a multi-modal planning benchmark constructed based on ChatGPT and household activity simulator iGibson2. The benchmark consists of 153 activities and 1,187 instances. Each instance describing one activity has a natural language task description and multiple environment images from the simulator. The gold plan of each instance is action sequences over the objects in provided scenes.

Current clean-label attack, employing a specific prompt as trigger, can achieve success without the need for external triggers and ensuring correct labeling of poisoned samples, which are more stealthy compared to the poisoned-label attack, but on the other hand, facing significant issues with false activations and pose greater challenges, necessitating a higher rate of poisoning. Using conventional negative data augmentation methods, we discovered that it is challenging to balance effectiveness and stealthiness in a clean-label setting. In addressing this issue, we are inspired by the notion that a backdoor acts as a shortcut, and posit that this shortcut stems from the contrast between the trigger and the data utilized for poisoning. In this study, we propose a method named Contrastive Shortcut Injection (CSI), by leveraging activation values, integrates trigger design and data selection strategies... | Xiaopeng Xie, Ming Yan, Xiwen Zhou, Chenlong Zhao, Suli Wang, Yong Zhang, Joey Zhou |  |

RaTEScore emphasizes crucial medical entities such as diagnostic outcomes and anatomical details, and is robust against complex medical synonyms and sensitive to negation expressions. Technically, we developed a comprehensive medical NER dataset, RaTE-NER, and trained an NER model specifically for this purpose. This model enables the decomposition of complex radiological reports into constituent medical entities. The metric itself is derived by comparing the similarity of entity embeddings, obtained from a language model, based on their types and relevance to clinical significance. Our evaluations demonstrate that RaTEScore aligns more closely with human preference than existing metrics, validated both on established public benchmarks and our newly proposed RaTE-Eval benchmark. | Weike Zhao, Chaoyi Wu, Xiaoman Zhang, Ya Zhang, Yanfeng Wang, Weidi Xie |  |

In this paper, we introduce HalluMeasure, a new LLM-based hallucination detection mechanism that decomposes an LLM response into atomic claims, and evaluates each atomic claim against the provided reference context. The model uses a step-by-step reasoning process called Chain-of-Thought and can identify 3 major categories of hallucinations (e.g., contradiction) as well as 10 more specific subtypes (e.g., overgeneralization) which help to identify reasons behind the hallucination errors. Specifically, we explore four different configurations for HalluMeasure’s classifier: with and without CoT prompting, and using a single classifier call to classify all claims versus separate calls for each claim. The best-performing configuration (with CoT and separate calls for each claim) demonstrates significant improvements in... | Shayan Ali Akbar, Md Mosharaf Hossain, Tess Wood, SiChi Chin, Erica Salinas, Victor Alvarez, Erwin Cornejo |  |

Using a shared secondary decoder with the summarization decoder, we carry out the LTR task at the segment level. Compared to the state-of-the-art, our model outperforms on QMSum benchmark (all metrics) and matches on SQuALITY benchmark (2 metrics) as measured by Rouge and BertScore while offering a lower training overhead. Specifically, on the QMSum benchmark, our proposed system achieves improvements, particularly in Rouge-L (+0.42) and BertScore (+0.34), indicating enhanced understanding and relevance. While facing minor challenges in Rouge-1 and Rouge-2 scores on the SQuALITY benchmark, the model significantly excels in Rouge-L (+1.47), underscoring its capability to generate coherent summaries.

A Study on Edit Intent Classification in Scientific Document Revisions](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.839) |  | 0 | Classification is a core NLP task architecture with many potential applications. While large language models (LLMs) have brought substantial advancements in text generation, their potential for enhancing classification tasks remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a framework for thoroughly investigating fine-tuning LLMs for classification, including both generation- and encoding-based approaches. We instantiate this framework in edit intent classification (EIC), a challenging and underexplored classification task. Our extensive experiments and systematic comparisons with various training approaches and a representative selection of LLMs yield new insights into their application for EIC. We investigate the generalizability of these findings on five further classification tasks. To demonstrate the proposed methods and address the data shortage for empirical edit analysis, we use our best-performing EIC model to create Re3-Sci2.0, a new large-scale dataset of 1,780... | Qian Ruan, Ilia Kuznetsov, Iryna Gurevych |  |

These questions often require a deep understanding of research concepts and the ability to reason over entire articles. In this work, we introduce LitSearch, a retrieval benchmark comprising 597 realistic literature search queries about recent ML and NLP papers. LitSearch is constructed using a combination of (1) questions generated by GPT-4 based on paragraphs containing inline citations from research papers and (2) questions about recently published papers, manually written by their authors. All LitSearch questions were manually examined or edited by experts to ensure high quality. We extensively benchmark state-of-the-art retrieval models and also evaluate two LLM-based reranking pipelines. We find a significant performance gap between BM25 and state-of-the-art dense retrievers, with a... | Anirudh Ajith, Mengzhou Xia, Alexis Chevalier, Tanya Goyal, Danqi Chen, Tianyu Gao |  |

Similar single-label XWS settings have been explored recently, however, these methods cannot be easily adapted for multi-label. We observe that (1) most documents have a dominant class covering the majority of content and (2) long-tail labels would appear in some documents as a dominant class. Therefore, we first utilize the user description to prompt a large language model (LLM) for dominant keyphrases of a subset of raw documents, and then construct a (initial) label space via clustering. We further apply a zero-shot multi-label classifier to locate the documents with small top predicted scores, so we can revisit their dominant keyphrases for more long-tail labels. We iterate this process to discover a comprehensive label space and construct a multi-label classifier... | Xintong Li, Jinya Jiang, Ria Dharmani, Jayanth Srinivasa, Gaowen Liu, Jingbo Shang |  |

Our results show that LLaMA-2, a language model trained on text, achieves accurate predictions of dynamical system time series without fine-tuning or prompt engineering. Moreover, the accuracy of the learned physical rules increases with the length of the input context window, revealing an in-context version of a neural scaling law. Along the way, we present a flexible and efficient algorithm for extracting probability density functions of multi-digit numbers directly from LLMs. | Toni J. B.

However, its current evaluations deviate significantly from practice: their knowledge updates solely consist of structured facts derived from meticulously crafted datasets, instead of practical sources—unstructured texts like news articles, and they often overlook practical real-world knowledge updates. To address these issues, in this paper we propose AKEW (Assessing Knowledge Editing in the Wild), a new practical benchmark for knowledge editing. AKEW fully covers three editing settings of knowledge updates: structured facts, unstructured texts as facts, and extracted triplets. It further introduces new datasets featuring both counterfactual and real-world knowledge updates. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the considerable gap between state-of-the-art knowledge-editing methods and practical scenarios. Our analyses further highlight key insights to motivate future... | Xiaobao Wu, Liangming Pan, William Yang Wang, Anh Tuan Luu |  |

Although both literal and non-literal similarities are considered by courts when assessing the degree of reproduction, prior research has focused only on literal similarities. To bridge this gap, we introduce CopyBench, a benchmark designed to measure both literal and non-literal copying in LM generations. Using copyrighted fiction books as text sources, we provide automatic evaluation protocols to assess literal and non-literal copying, balanced against the model utility in terms of the ability to recall facts from the copyrighted works and generate fluent completions. We find that, although literal copying is relatively rare, two types of non-literal copying—event copying and character copying—occur even in models as small as 7B parameters. Larger models demonstrate significantly more copying, with literal copying rates increasing... | Tong Chen, Akari Asai, Niloofar Mireshghallah, Sewon Min, James Grimmelmann, Yejin Choi, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, Luke Zettlemoyer, Pang Wei Koh |  |

When we use a learned dense retriever on a retrieval corpus at inference time, an often-overlooked design choice is the retrieval unit in which the corpus is indexed, e.g. document, passage, or sentence. We discover that the retrieval unit choice significantly impacts the performance of both retrieval and downstream tasks. Distinct from the typical approach of using passages or sentences, we introduce a novel retrieval unit, proposition, for dense retrieval. Propositions are defined as atomic expressions within text, each encapsulating a distinct factoid and presented in a concise, self-contained natural language format. We conduct an empirical comparison of different retrieval granularity. Our experiments reveal that indexing a corpus by fine-grained units such as propositions significantly outperforms passage-level units in retrieval tasks.

Existing susceptibility studies heavily rely on self-reported beliefs, which can be subject to bias, expensive to collect, and challenging to scale for downstream applications. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose a computational approach to efficiently model users’ latent susceptibility levels. As shown in previous work, susceptibility is influenced by various factors (e.g., demographic factors, political ideology), and directly influences people’s reposting behavior on social media. To represent the underlying mental process, our susceptibility modeling incorporates these factors as inputs, guided by the supervision of people’s sharing behavior. Using COVID-19 as a testbed, our experiments demonstrate a significant alignment between the susceptibility scores estimated by our computational modeling and human... | Yanchen Liu, Mingyu Derek Ma, Wenna Qin, Azure Zhou, Jiaao Chen, Weiyan Shi, Wei Wang, Diyi Yang |  |

However, where and to what extent these models retain task-specific knowledge remains largely unexplored. This study investigates the task-specific information encoded in pre-trained LLMs and the effects of instruction tuning on their representations across a diverse set of over 60 NLP tasks. We use a set of matrix analysis tools to examine the differences between the way pre-trained and instruction-tuned LLMs store task-specific information. Our findings reveal that while some tasks are already encoded within the pre-trained LLMs, others greatly benefit from instruction tuning. Additionally, we pinpointed the layers in which the model transitions from high-level general representations to more task-oriented representations. This finding extends our understanding of the governing mechanisms of... | Zheng Zhao, Yftah Ziser, Shay B. Cohen |  |

To address this challenge, we propose XDetox, a novel method that integrates token-level toxicity explanations with the masking and infilling detoxification process. We utilized this approach with two strategies to enhance the performance of detoxification. First, identifying toxic tokens to improve the quality of masking. Second, selecting the regenerated sentence by re-ranking the least toxic sentence among candidates. Our experimental results show state-of-the-art performance across four datasets compared to existing detoxification methods. Furthermore, human evaluations indicate that our method outperforms baselines in both fluency and toxicity reduction. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in text detoxification. | Beomseok Lee, Hyunwoo Kim, Keon Kim, Yong Suk Choi |  |

A key challenge in CLS is the scarcity of data resources. We begin by evaluating the performance of various language models at different scales in unsupervised and few-shot settings, finding that their effectiveness is sensitive to word types. Expensive large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, outperform small models in simplifying complex content words and Chinese idioms from the dictionary.To take advantage of this, we propose an automatic knowledge distillation framework called PivotKD for generating training data to fine-tune small models.In addition, all models face difficulties with out-of-dictionary (OOD) words such as internet slang.To address this, we implement a retrieval-based interpretation augmentation (RIA) strategy, injecting word interpretations from external resources into the context.Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuned small models outperform GPT-4 in simplifying complex content... | Zihao Xiao, Jiefu Gong, Shijin Wang, Wei Song |  |

We systematically evaluate the performance of LLMs on satisfying lexical constraints with prompt-based controlling, as well as their efficacy in downstream applications. We identified three key reasons that highlight the limitations of LLMs in LCG, including (1) position bias, where LLMs tend to satisfy constraints that appear in specific positions within the input; (2) low responsiveness to control decoding parameters, which minimally impact the performance of LLMs; and (3) struggle with handling the inherent complexity of certain constraints (e.g. compound word). We conclude that black-box LLMs face significant challenges in consistently satisfying lexical constraints with prompt-based controlling. To address this bottleneck, we introduce the Divide and Conquer Generation strategy, effective for both white-box and black-box... | Bingxuan Li, Yiwei Wang, Tao Meng, KaiWei Chang, Nanyun Peng |  |

The existing models are generally divided into structure-based and description-based models, among description-based models often require longer training and inference times as well as increased memory usage. In this paper, we propose Pre-Encoded Masked Language Model (PEMLM) to efficiently solve KGC problem. By encoding textual descriptions into semantic representations before training, the necessary resources are significantly reduced. Furthermore, we introduce a straightforward but effective fusion framework to integrate structural embedding with pre-encoded semantic description, which enhances the model’s prediction performance on 1-N relations. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed strategy attains state-of-the-art performance on the WN18RR (MRR+5.4% and Hits@1+6.4%) and UMLS datasets.

A fundamental challenge in this method lies in ensuring that the reward model accurately understands and evaluates human preferences. Current methods rely on ranking losses to teach the reward model to assess preferences, but they are susceptible to noise and ambiguous data, often failing to deeply understand human intentions. To address this issue, we introduce contrastive learning into the reward modeling process. In addition to supervised ranking loss, we introduce an unsupervised contrastive loss to enable the reward model to fully capture the distinctions in contrastive data. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed contrastive learning-based reward modeling method effectively enhances the generalization of the reward model, stabilizes the reinforcement learning training process, and improves the final alignment with human preferences. | Lu Chen, Rui Zheng, Binghai Wang, Senjie Jin, Caishuang Huang, Junjie Ye, Zhihao Zhang, Yuhao Zhou, Zhiheng Xi, Tao Gui, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang |  |

The core of this task is to leverage structured contexts, specifically row and column contexts, to enhance the semantics of mentions in entity disambiguation. Most entity linking (EL) methods primarily focus on understanding sequential text contexts, making it difficult to adapt to the row and column structure of tables. Additionally, existing methods for TEL indiscriminately mix row and column contexts together, overlooking their semantic differences. In this paper, we explicitly distinguish the modeling of row and column contexts, and propose a method called RoCEL to capture their distinct semantics. Specifically, for row contexts in tables, we take the attention mechanism to learn the implicit relational dependencies between each cell and the mention. For column contexts in tables, we employ a set-wise encoder to learn the categorical information about the... | Yuanzheng Wang, Yixing Fan, Jiafeng Guo, Ruqing Zhang, Xueqi Cheng |  |

This paper is centred around a focused study: whether the current state-of-the-art generalist LLMs can leverage the structures in a few examples to better construct the proof structures with in-context learning. Our study specifically focuses on structure-aware demonstration and structure-aware pruning. We demonstrate that they both help improve performance. A detailed analysis is provided to help understand the results. | Zi'ou Zheng, Christopher Malon, Martin Renqiang Min, Xiaodan Zhu |  |

A major challenge in ED is handling overshadowed entities—uncommon entities sharing mention surfaces with common entities. The current approach to enhance performance on these entities involves reasoning over facts in a knowledge base (KB), increasing computational overhead during inference. We argue that the ED performance on overshadowed entities can be enhanced during training by addressing shortcut learning, which does not add computational overhead at inference. We propose a simple yet effective debiasing technique to prevent models from shortcut learning during training. Experiments on a range of ED datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance without compromising inference speed. Our findings suggest a new research direction for improving entity disambiguation via shortcut learning mitigation. | Panuthep Tasawong, Peerat Limkonchotiwat, Potsawee Manakul, Can Udomcharoenchaikit, Ekapol Chuangsuwanich, Sarana Nutanong |  |

Previous research primarily either focuses on APIs with limited arguments from a single source or overlooks the complex dependency relationship between different APIs. However, it is essential to utilize multiple APIs collaboratively from various sources, especially for complex user instructions. In this paper, we introduce MetaBench, the first benchmark to evaluate LLMs’ ability to plan and execute multiple APIs from various sources in order to complete the user’s task. Specifically, we consider two significant challenges in multiple APIs: 1) graph structures: some APIs can be executed independently while others need to be executed one by one, resulting in graph-like execution order; and 2) permission constraints: which source is authorized to execute the API call. We have experimental results on 9 distinct... | Hongru Wang, Rui Wang, Boyang Xue, Heming Xia, Jingtao Cao, Zeming Liu, Jeff Z. Pan, KamFai Wong |  |

They are prone to overfit into the unexpected patterns or superficial styles in the training data. We conduct an empirical study that only selects the top-10% most updated parameters in LLMs for alignment training, and see improvements in the convergence process and final performance. It indicates the existence of redundant neurons in LLMs for alignment training. To reduce its influence, we propose a low-redundant alignment method named \*\*ALLO\*\*, focusing on optimizing the most related neurons with the most useful supervised signals. Concretely, we first identify the neurons that are related to the human preference data by a gradient-based strategy, then identify the alignment-related key tokens by reward models for computing loss. Besides, we also decompose the alignment process into the forgetting and learning stages, where we first forget the tokens with unaligned... | Zhipeng Chen, Kun Zhou, Xin Zhao, Jingyuan Wang, JiRong Wen |  |

Recently reported state-of-the-art results in VSR often rely on increasingly large amounts of video data, while the publicly available transcribed video datasets are insufficient compared to the audio data. To further enhance the VSR model using the audio data, we employed a generative model for data inflation, integrating the synthetic data with the authentic visual data. Essentially, the generative model incorporates another insight, which enhances the capabilities of the recognition model. For the cross-language issue, previous work has shown poor performance with non-Indo-European languages. We trained a multi-language-family modal fusion model, AudioVSR. Leveraging the concept of modal transfer, we achieved significant results in downstream VSR tasks under conditions of data scarcity. To the best of our knowledge, AudioVSR represents the first work on cross-language-family... | Xiaoda Yang, Xize Cheng, Jiaqi Duan, Hongshun Qiu, Minjie Hong, Minghui Fang, Shengpeng Ji, Jialong Zuo, Zhiqing Hong, Zhimeng Zhang, Tao Jin |  |

Further, unreliability in benchmarking code efficiency is a hurdle across varying hardware specifications for popular interpreted languages such as Python. In this paper, we present ECCO, a reproducible benchmark for evaluating program efficiency via two paradigms: natural language (NL) based code generation and history-based code editing. On ECCO, we adapt and thoroughly investigate the three most promising existing LLM-based approaches: in-context learning, iterative refinement with execution or NL feedback, and fine-tuning conditioned on execution and editing history. While most methods degrade functional correctness and moderately increase program efficiency, we find that adding execution information often helps maintain functional correctness, and NL feedback enhances more... | Siddhant Waghjale, Vishruth Veerendranath, Zhiruo Wang, Daniel Fried |  |

On the other hand, translation-specific LLMs are built by pre-training on domain-specific monolingual corpora and fine-tuning with human-annotated translation data. Despite the superior performance, these methods either demand an unprecedented scale of computing and data or substantial human editing and annotation efforts. In this paper, we develop MT-Ladder, a novel model-agnostic and cost-effective tool to refine the performance of general LLMs for MT. MT-Ladder is trained on pseudo-refinement triplets which can be easily obtained from existing LLMs without additional human cost. During training, we propose a hierarchical fine-tuning strategy with an easy-to-hard schema, improving MT-Ladder’s refining performance progressively. The trained MT-Ladder can be seamlessly integrated with any general-purpose LLMs to boost their... | Zhaopeng Feng, Ruizhe Chen, Yan Zhang, Zijie Meng, Zuozhu Liu |  |

In this paper, we investigate the use of self-training in language agents, which can generate supervision from the agent itself, offering a promising alternative without relying on human or stronger model demonstrations. Self-training, however, requires high-quality model-generated samples, which are hard to obtain for challenging language agent tasks. To address this, we present Reflection-Reinforced Self-Training (Re-ReST), which uses a reflector to refine low-quality generated samples during self-training. The reflector takes the agent’s output and feedback from an external environment (e.g., unit test results in code generation) to produce improved samples. This technique enhances the quality of inferior samples and efficiently enriches the self-training dataset with higher-quality samples.

This study introduces a method for constructing post-OCR synthetic data with different noise levels using weak supervision. We define Character Error Rate (CER) thresholds for “effective” and “ineffective” synthetic data, allowing us to create more useful multi-noise level synthetic datasets. Furthermore, we propose Self-Correct-Noise Test-Time Adaptation (SCN-TTA), which combines self-correction and noise generation mechanisms. SCN-TTA allows a model to dynamically adjust to test data without relying on labels, effectively handling proper nouns in long texts and further reducing CER. In our experiments we evaluate a range of models, including multiple PLMs and LLMs. Results indicate that our method yields models that are effective across diverse text types. Notably, the ByT5 model achieves a CER reduction of 68.67% without relying on manually annotated data | Shuhao Guan, Cheng Xu, Moule Lin, Derek Greene |  |

However, several aspects that are important for DocRE have not been considered and explored. Existing work ignores bidirectional mention interaction when generating relational features for entity pairs. Also, sophisticated neural networks are typically designed for cross-sentence evidence extraction to further enhance DocRE. More interestingly, we reveal a noteworthy finding: If a model has predicted a relation between an entity and other entities, this relation information may help infer and predict more relations between the entity’s adjacent entities and these other entities. Nonetheless, none of existing methods leverage secondary reasoning to exploit results of relation prediction. To this end, we propose a novel Secondary Reasoning Framework (SRF) for DocRE.

Consequently, it serves as an ideal testing ground for Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). In pursuit of this goal, we have established a new REC dataset characterized by two key features: Firstly, it is designed with controllable varying levels of difficulty, necessitating multi-level fine-grained reasoning across object categories, attributes, and multi-hop relationships. Secondly, it includes negative text and images created through fine-grained editing and generation based on existing data, thereby testing the model’s ability to correctly reject scenarios where the target object is not visible in the image—an essential aspect often overlooked in existing datasets and approaches.

This paper investigates the interplay between learning the general and the specific in various learning methods, with emphasis on sample efficiency. We design a framework called LEVERWORLDS, which allows the generation of simple physics-inspired worlds that follow a similar generative process with different distributions, and their instances can be expressed in natural language. These worlds allow for controlled experiments to assess the sample complexity of different learning methods. We experiment with classic learning algorithms as well as Transformer language models, both with fine-tuning and In-Context Learning (ICL). Our general finding is that (1) Transformers generally succeed in the task; but (2) they are considerably less sample efficient than classic methods that make stronger assumptions about the structure, such as Maximum Likelihood... | Eitan Wagner, Amir Feder, Omri Abend |  |

In particular, it is unclear whether language models produce the same value for different ways of assigning joint probabilities to word spans. Our work introduces a novel framework, ConTestS (Consistency Testing over Spans), involving statistical tests to assess score consistency across interchangeable completion and conditioning orders. We conduct experiments on post-release real and synthetic data to eliminate training effects. Our findings reveal that both Masked Language Models (MLMs) and autoregressive models exhibit inconsistent predictions, with autoregressive models showing larger discrepancies. Larger MLMs tend to produce more consistent predictions, while autoregressive models show the opposite trend. Moreover, for both model types, prediction entropies offer insights into the true word span... | Eitan Wagner, Yuli Slavutsky, Omri Abend |  |

Past works have shown that multimodal grounding of user requests in the document image and identifying the accurate structural components and their associated attributes remain key challenges for this task. To address these, we introduce the DocEditAgent, a novel framework that performs end-to-end document editing by leveraging Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). It consists of three novel components – (1) Doc2Command to simultaneously localize edit regions of interest (RoI) and disambiguate user edit requests into edit commands. (2) LLM-based Command Reformulation prompting to tailor edit commands originally intended for specialized software into edit instructions suitable for generalist LMMs. (3) Moreover, DocEditAgent processes these outputs via Large Multimodal Models like GPT-4V and Gemini, to parse the document layout, execute edits on... | Manan Suri, Puneet Mathur, Franck Dernoncourt, Rajiv Jain, Vlad I.

Reward modeling is a crucial step in RLHF. However, collecting paired preference data for training reward models is often costly and time-consuming, especially for domain-specific preferences requiring expert annotation. To address this challenge, we propose the \*\*Do\*\*main knowled\*\*ge\*\* merged \*\*R\*\*eward \*\*M\*\*odel (\*\*DogeRM\*\*), a novel framework that integrates domain-specific knowledge into a general reward model by model merging.

This study investigates the capability of large language models (LLMs) to paraphrase slang within climate-related tweets from Nigeria and the UK, with a focus on identifying emotional nuances. Using DistilRoBERTa as the base-line model, we observe its limited comprehension of slang. To improve cross-cultural understanding, we gauge the effectiveness of leading LLMs ChatGPT 4, Gemini, and LLaMA3 in slang paraphrasing. While ChatGPT 4 and Gemini demonstrate comparable effectiveness in slang paraphrasing, LLaMA3 shows less coverage, with all LLMs exhibiting limitations in coverage, especially of Nigerian slang. Our findings underscore the necessity for culturally sensitive LLM development in emotion classification, particularly in non-anglocentric regions. | Ifeoluwa Wuraola, Nina Dethlefs, Daniel Marciniak |  |

However, achieving optimal results with a given prompt or instruction can be challenging, especially for billion-sized models. Additionally, undesired behaviors such as toxicity or hallucinations can manifest. While much larger models (e.g., ChatGPT) may demonstrate strength in mitigating these issues, there is still no guarantee of complete prevention. In this work, we propose formalizing text generation as a future-constrained generation problem to minimize undesirable behaviors and enforce faithfulness to instructions. The estimation of future constraint satisfaction, accomplished using LLMs, guides the text generation process. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach across three distinct text generation tasks: keyword-constrained generation (Lin et al., 2020), toxicity reduction (Gehman et al., 2020), and factual correctness in question-answering (Gao et... | Lifu Tu, Semih Yavuz, Jin Qu, Jiacheng Xu, Rui Meng, Caiming Xiong, Yingbo Zhou |  |

Unlike most thought-eliciting prompting methods, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which aim to elicit the reasoning process in the output, RE2 shifts the focus to the input by processing questions twice, thereby enhancing the understanding process. Consequently, RE2 demonstrates strong generality and compatibility with most thought-eliciting prompting methods, including CoT. Crucially, RE2 facilitates a “bidirectional” encoding in unidirectional decoder-only LLMs because the first pass could provide global information for the second pass. We begin with a preliminary empirical study as the foundation of RE2, illustrating its potential to enable “bidirectional” attention mechanisms. We then evaluate RE2 on extensive reasoning benchmarks across 14 datasets, spanning 112 experiments, to validate... | Xiaohan Xu, Chongyang Tao, Tao Shen, Can Xu, Hongbo Xu, Guodong Long, JianGuang Lou, Shuai Ma |  |

However, these approaches have struggled to fully capture the variability in stereotypes across different conceptual domains for the same social group (e.g., black in science, health, and art), in part because the identity of a word and the associations formed during pre-training can dominate its contextual representation (Field and Tsvetkov, 2019). This study explores the ability to recover stereotypes from the contexts surrounding targeted entities by utilizing state-of-the-art text embedding models and adaptive semantic axes enhanced by large language models (LLMs). Our results indicate that the proposed pipeline not only surpasses token-based methods in... | Qingcheng Zeng, Mingyu Jin, Rob Voigt |  |

We examine the healthcare knowledge of existing Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) via the Visual Question Answering (VQA) task in hospital settings through expert annotated open-ended questions. We introduce the Emergency Room Visual Question Answering (ERVQA) dataset, consisting of <image, question, answer> triplets covering diverse emergency room scenarios, a seminal benchmark for LVLMs. By developing a detailed error taxonomy and analyzing answer trends, we reveal the nuanced nature of the task. We benchmark state-of-the-art open-source and closed LVLMs using traditional and adapted VQA metrics: Entailment Score and CLIPScore Confidence. Analyzing errors across models, we infer trends based on properties like decoder type, model size, and in-context examples.

Answer aggregation is an important type of solution. The aggregated answers estimated from multiple crowd answers to the same instance are the eventually collected annotations, rather than the individual crowd answers themselves. Recently, the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) on data annotation tasks has attracted interest from researchers. Most of the existing studies mainly focus on the average performance of individual crowd workers; several recent works studied the scenarios of aggregation on categorical labels and LLMs used as label creators. However, the scenario of aggregation on text answers and the role of LLMs as aggregators are not yet well-studied. In this paper, we investigate the capability of LLMs as aggregators in the scenario of close-ended crowd text answer aggregation. We propose a human-LLM hybrid text answer aggregation method with a Creator-Aggregator Multi-Stage (CAMS) crowdsourcing framework. We... | Jiyi Li |  |

Although these methods enhance in-domain (IND) reasoning performance, they struggle to generalize to out-of-domain (OOD) tasks.We believe that the widespread spurious correlations between questions and answers may lead the model to preset a specific answer which restricts the diversity and generalizability of its reasoning process.In this paper, we propose Cascading Decomposed CoTs Distillation (CasCoD) to address these issues by decomposing the traditional single-step learning process into two cascaded learning steps. Specifically, by restructuring the training objectives—removing the answer from outputs and concatenating the question with the rationale as input—CasCoD’s two-step learning process ensures that students... | Chengwei Dai, Kun Li, Wei Zhou, Songlin Hu |  |

To tackle these challenges, state-of-the-art microblog classification models rely on pre-training language models (LMs). However, pre-training dedicated LMs is resource-intensive and not suitable for small labs. Supervised contrastive learning (SCL) has shown its effectiveness with small, available resources. In this work, we examine the effectiveness of fine-tuning transformer-based language models, regularized with a SCL loss for English microblog classification. Despite its simplicity, the evaluation on two English microblog classification benchmarks (TweetEval and Tweet Topic Classification) shows an improvement over baseline models. The result shows that, across all subtasks, our proposed method has a performance gain of up to 11.9 percentage points. All our models are open source. | Junbo Huang, Ricardo Usbeck |  |

However, the incorporation of sophisticated disguising prompts may incur the challenge of “intention shift”. Intention shift occurs when the additional semantics within the prompt distract the LLMs, causing the responses to deviate significantly from the original harmful intentions. In this paper, we propose a novel component, “bait”, to alleviate the effects of intention shift. Bait comprises an initial response to the harmful query, prompting LLMs to rectify or supplement the knowledge within the bait. By furnishing rich semantics relevant to the query, the bait helps LLMs focus on the original intention. To conceal the harmful content within the bait, we further propose a novel attack paradigm, BaitAttack. BaitAttack adaptively generates necessary components to persuade targeted LLMs that they are engaging with a... | Rui Pu, Chaozhuo Li, Rui Ha, Litian Zhang, Lirong Qiu, Xi Zhang |  |

Current methods, which focus on modifying inputs and monitoring changes in the model’s output probability scores, often struggle to comprehensively understand bias from the perspective of model components. We propose a framework that incorporates causal mediation analysis to measure and map the pathways of bias generation and propagation within VLMs. Our framework is applicable to a wide range of vision-language and multimodal tasks. In this work, we apply it to the object detection task and implement it on the GLIP model. This approach allows us to identify the direct effects of interventions on model bias and the indirect effects of interventions on bias mediated through different model components. Our results show that image features are the primary contributors to bias, with significantly higher impacts than text... | Zhaotian Weng, Zijun Gao, Jerone Theodore Alexander Andrews, Jieyu Zhao |  |

In the work, we focus on utilizing LLMs to perform machine translation, where we observe that two patterns of errors frequently occur and drastically affect the translation quality: language mismatch and repetition. The work sets out to explore the potential for mitigating these two issues by leveraging model editing methods, e.g., by locating Feed-Forward Network (FFN) neurons or something that are responsible for the errors and deactivating them in the inference time.We find that directly applying such methods either limited effect on the targeted errors or has significant negative side-effect on the general translation quality, indicating that the located components may also be crucial for ensuring machine translation with LLMs on the rails.To this end, we propose to refine the located components by fetching the intersection of the locating... | Weichuan Wang, Zhaoyi Li, Defu Lian, Chen Ma, Linqi Song, Ying Wei |  |

To make this task more practical and solvable for LLMs, we introduce a new task setting named tool-augmented scientific reasoning. This setting supplements LLMs with scalable toolsets, and shifts the focus from pursuing an omniscient problem solver to a proficient tool-user. To facilitate the research of such setting, we construct a tool-augmented training corpus named MathFunc which encompasses over 30,000 samples and roughly 6,000 tools. Building on MathFunc, we develop SciAgent to retrieve, understand and, if necessary, use tools for scientific problem solving. Additionally, we craft a benchmark, SciToolBench, spanning five scientific domains to evaluate LLMs’ abilities with tool assistance. Extensive experiments on SciToolBench confirm the effectiveness of SciAgent. Notably, SciAgent-Llama3-8B surpasses other LLMs with the comparable size by more than 8.0% in absolute... | Yubo Ma, Zhibin Gou, Junheng Hao, Ruochen Xu, Shuohang Wang, Liangming Pan, Yujiu Yang, Yixin Cao, Aixin Sun |  |

In this paper, we propose the usage of denser naturally-occurring multimodal communicative signals as local implicit feedback to improve the turn-level utterance generation. Therefore, our approach (dubbed GELI) learns a local, turn-level reward model by decomposing the human-provided Global Explicit (GE) session level reward, using Local Implicit (LI) multimodal reward signals to crossmodally shape the reward decomposition step. This decomposed reward model is then used as part of the RLHF pipeline to improve an LLM-based dialog agent. We run quantitative and qualitative human studies on two large-scale datasets to evaluate the performance of our GELI approach, and find that it shows consistent improvements across various conversational metrics compared to baseline methods. | Dong Won Lee, Hae Park, Yoon Kim, Cynthia Breazeal, LouisPhilippe Morency |  |
| 1005 |  |  [Towards Measuring and Modeling "Culture" in LLMs: A Survey](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.882) |  | 0 | We present a survey of more than 90 recent papers that aim to study cultural representation and inclusion in large language models (LLMs). We observe that none of the studies explicitly define “culture, which is a complex, multifaceted concept; instead, they probe the models on some specially designed datasets which represent certain aspects of “culture”. We call these aspects the proxies of culture, and organize them across two dimensions of demographic and semantic proxies. We also categorize the probing methods employed. Our analysis indicates that only certain aspects of “culture,” such as values and objectives, have been studied, leaving several other interesting and important facets, especially the multitude of semantic domains (Thompson et al., 2020) and aboutness (Hershcovich et al., 2022), unexplored. Two other crucial gaps are the lack of robustness of probing techniques and situated studies on the impact of cultural mis- and under-representation in LLM-based applications. | Muhammad Farid Adilazuarda, Sagnik Mukherjee, Pradhyumna Lavania, Siddhant Singh, Alham Fikri Aji, Jacki O'Neill, Ashutosh Modi, Monojit Choudhury |  |

With the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), many researchers have employed LLMs as the ESC models. However, the evaluation of these LLM-based ESCs remains uncertain. In detail, we first re-organize 2,801 role-playing cards from seven existing datasets to define the roles of the role-playing agent. Second, we train a specific role-playing model called ESC-Role which behaves more like a confused person than GPT-4. Third, through ESC-Role and organized role cards, we systematically conduct experiments using 14 LLMs as the ESC models, including general AI-assistant LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) and ESC-oriented LLMs (e.g., ExTES-Llama). We conduct comprehensive human annotations on interactive multi-turn dialogues of different ESC models. The results show that ESC-oriented LLMs exhibit superior ESC abilities... | Haiquan Zhao, Lingyu Li, Shisong Chen, Shuqi Kong, Jiaan Wang, Kexin Huang, Tianle Gu, Yixu Wang, Jian Wang, Dandan Liang, Zhixu Li, Yan Teng, Yanghua Xiao, Yingchun Wang |  |

On the Effectiveness of Socio-Demographic Prompting](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.884) |  | 0 | Socio-demographic prompting is a commonly employed approach to study cultural biases in LLMs as well as for aligning models to certain cultures. In this paper, we systematically probe four LLMs (Llama 3, Mistral v0.2, GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT4) with prompts that are conditioned on culturally sensitive and non-sensitive cues, on datasets that are supposed to be culturally sensitive (EtiCor and CALI) or neutral (MMLU and ETHICS). We observe that all models except GPT4 show significant variations in their responses on both kinds of datasets for both kinds of prompts, casting doubt on the robustness of the culturally-conditioned prompting as a method for eliciting cultural bias in models that are not sufficiently stable with respect to arbitrary prompting cues. Further, we also show that some of the supposedly culturally neutral datasets have a non-trivial fraction of culturally sensitive questions/tasks. | Sagnik Mukherjee, Muhammad Farid Adilazuarda, Sunayana Sitaram, Kalika Bali, Alham Fikri Aji, Monojit Choudhury |  |

Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs also have the potential to generate texts that pose risks of misuse. Consequently, detecting LLM-generated text has become increasingly important.Previous LLM-generated text detection methods use semantic features, which are stored in the last layer. This leads to methods that overfit the training set domain and exhibit shortcomings in generalization. Therefore, We argue that utilizing intrinsic features rather than semantic features for detection results in better performance.In this work, we design Text Fluoroscopy, a black-box method with better generalizability for detecting LLM-generated text by mining the intrinsic features of the text to be detected. Our method captures the text’s intrinsic features by identifying the layer with the largest distribution difference from the last and first... | Xiao Yu, Kejiang Chen, Qi Yang, Weiming Zhang, Nenghai Yu |  |

By including additional context in prompts, we comprehensively analyze LLM’s sensitivity to geographical priming, persona attributes, and numerical information to assess how well the needs of various groups are reflected. Our findings on two LLMs, five languages, and six datasets reveal that mimicking persona-based attributes leads to annotation variability. Meanwhile, incorporating geographical signals leads to better regional alignment. We also find that the LLMs are sensitive to numerical anchors, indicating the ability to leverage community-based flagging efforts and exposure to adversaries. Our work provides preliminary guidelines and highlights the nuances of applying LLMs in culturally sensitive cases. | Sarah Masud, Sahajpreet Singh, Viktor Hangya, Alexander Fraser, Tanmoy Chakraborty |  |

Recently, significant attempts have been made to benchmark datasets and metrics to evaluate LLMs for these traits. However, structural simplicity (subject-relation-object) and contemporary association in their query formulation limit the broader definition of factuality and consistency. In this study, we introduce TeCFaP, a novel Temporally Consistent Factuality Probe task to expand the consistent factuality probe in the temporal dimension. To this end, we propose TEMP-COFAC, a high-quality dataset of prefix-style English query paraphrases. Subsequently, we extend the definitions of existing metrics to represent consistent factuality across temporal dimension. We experiment with a diverse set of LLMs and find most of them performing poorly on TeCFaP. Next, we propose a novel solution... | Ashutosh Bajpai, Aaryan Goyal, Atif Anwer, Tanmoy Chakraborty |  |

We ensure that training data and model architectures are comparable, and discuss the downstream performances across 6 languages that we observe in probing and fine-tuning scenarios.We make two key observations: (1) the architecture dictates which pretraining objective is optimal; (2) multilingual translation is a very effective pretraining... | Zihao Li, Shaoxiong Ji, Timothee Mickus, Vincent Segonne, Jörg Tiedemann |  |

In this work, we focus on evaluating the reliability of current LLMs as science communicators. Unlike existing benchmarks, our approach emphasizes assessing these models on scientific question-answering tasks that require a nuanced understanding and awareness of answerability. We introduce a novel dataset, SCiPS-QA, comprising 742 Yes/No queries embedded in complex scientific concepts, along with a benchmarking suite that evaluates LLMs for correctness and consistency across various criteria. We benchmark three proprietary LLMs from the OpenAI GPT family and 13 open-access LLMs from the Meta Llama-2, Llama-3, and Mistral families. While most open-access models significantly underperform compared to GPT-4 Turbo, our experiments identify Llama-3-70B as a strong competitor, often surpassing GPT-4 Turbo in various evaluation aspects.

However, training MoE from scratch in a large-scale setting still suffers from data-hungry and instability problems. Motivated by this limit, we investigate building MoE models from existing dense large language models. Specifically, based on the well-known LLaMA-2 7B model, we obtain an MoE model by: (1) Expert Construction, which partitions the parameters of original Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) into multiple experts; (2) Continual pre-training, which further trains the transformed MoE model and additional gate networks. In this paper, we comprehensively explore different methods for expert construction and various data sampling strategies for continual pre-training. After these stages, our LLaMA-MoE models could maintain language abilities and route the input tokens to specific experts with part of the parameters activated. Empirically, by training 200B... | Tong Zhu, Xiaoye Qu, Daize Dong, Jiacheng Ruan, Jingqi Tong, Conghui He, Yu Cheng |  |

With the recent emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs), some studies have turned to LLM-based automatic evaluation methods, which demonstrate great potential to become a new evaluation paradigm following traditional string-based and model-based metrics. However, despite the improved performance of existing methods, they still possess some deficiencies, such as dependency on references and limited evaluation flexibility. Therefore, in this paper, we meticulously construct a large-scale NLG evaluation corpus \*\*NLG-Eval\*\* with annotations from both human and GPT-4 to alleviate the lack of relevant data in this field. Furthermore, we propose \*\*Themis\*\*, an LLM dedicated to NLG evaluation, which has been trained with our designed multi-perspective consistency verification and rating-oriented preference alignment methods. Themis can conduct flexible and... | Xinyu Hu, Li Lin, Mingqi Gao, Xunjian Yin, Xiaojun Wan |  |

In this work, we demonstrate that the order of training data can lead to significant training imbalances, potentially resulting in performance degradation. Consequently, we propose to mitigate this imbalance by merging SFT models fine-tuned with different data orders, thereby enhancing the overall effectiveness of SFT. Additionally, we introduce a novel technique, “parameter-selection merging,” which outperforms traditional weighted-average methods on five datasets. Further, through analysis and ablation studies, we validate the effectiveness of our method and identify the sources of performance improvements. | Yiming Ju, Ziyi Ni, Xingrun Xing, Zhixiong Zeng, Hanyu Zhao, Siqi Fan, Zheng Zhang |  |

However, these methods can be very sensitive to the choice of support examples used. Retrieving good supports from the training data for a given test query is already a difficult problem, but in some cases solving this may not even be enough. We consider the setting of grounded language learning problems where finding relevant supports in the same or similar states as the query may be difficult. We design an agent which instead generates possible supports inputs and targets current state of the world, then uses them in-context-learning to solve the test query. We show substantially improved performance on a previously unsolved compositional generalization test without a loss of performance in other areas. The approach is general and can even scale to instructions expressed in natural language. | Sam Spilsbury, Pekka Marttinen, Alexander Ilin |  |

Nevertheless, outdated knowledge or factual errors within LLMs can lead to misleading or incorrect responses, causing significant issues in practical applications. To rectify the fatal flaw without the necessity for costly model retraining, various model editing approaches have been proposed to correct inaccurate information within LLMs in a cost-efficient way. To evaluate these model editing methods, previous work introduced a series of datasets. However, most of the previous datasets only contain fabricated data in a single format, which diverges from real-world model editing scenarios, raising doubts about their usability in practice. To facilitate the application of model editing in real-world scenarios, we propose the challenge of practicality. To resolve such challenges and effectively enhance the capabilities of LLMs, we present FAME, an authentic,... | Zeng Li, Yingyu Shan, Zeming Liu, Jiashu Yao, Yuhang Guo |  |

This paper investigates the novel challenge of defending MLLMs against such attacks. Compared to large language models (LLMs), MLLMs include an additional image modality. We discover that images act as a “foreign language” that is not considered during safety alignment, making MLLMs more prone to producing harmful responses. Unfortunately, unlike the discrete tokens considered in text-based LLMs, the continuous nature of image signals presents significant alignment challenges, which poses difficulty to thoroughly cover all possible scenarios. This vulnerability is exacerbated by the fact that most state-of-the-art MLLMs are fine-tuned on limited image-text pairs that are much fewer than the extensive text-based pretraining corpus, which makes the MLLMs more prone to catastrophic forgetting of their original abilities during... | Renjie Pi, Tianyang Han, Jianshu Zhang, Yueqi Xie, Rui Pan, Qing Lian, Hanze Dong, Jipeng Zhang, Tong Zhang |  |

This paper aims to provide a thorough overview of leveraging LLMs for NLG evaluation, a burgeoning area that lacks a systematic analysis. We propose a coherent taxonomy for organizing existing LLM-based evaluation metrics, offering a structured framework to understand and compare these methods. Our detailed exploration includes critically assessing various LLM-based methodologies, as well as comparing their strengths and limitations in evaluating NLG outputs. By discussing unresolved challenges, including bias, robustness, domain-specificity, and unified evaluation, this paper seeks to offer insights to researchers and advocate for fairer and more advanced NLG evaluation techniques. | Zhen Li, Xiaohan Xu, Tao Shen, Can Xu, JiaChen Gu, Yuxuan Lai, Chongyang Tao, Shuai Ma |  |

Our work aims to address this limitation by introducing InfiniPot, a novel KV cache control framework designed to enable pre-trained LLMs to manage extensive sequences within fixed memory constraints efficiently, without requiring additional training. InfiniPot leverages Continual Context Distillation (CCD), an iterative process that compresses and retains essential information through novel importance metrics, effectively maintaining critical data even without access to future context. Our comprehensive evaluations indicate that InfiniPot significantly outperforms models trained for long contexts in various NLP tasks, establishing its efficacy and versatility. This work represents a substantial advancement toward making LLMs applicable to a broader range of real-world scenarios. | Minsoo Kim, Kyuhong Shim, Jungwook Choi, Simyung Chang |  |

However, the emphasis on brief summary texts during pre-training prevents CLIP from understanding long descriptions. This issue is particularly acute regarding videos given that videos often contain abundant detailed contents. In this paper, we propose the VideoCLIP-XL (eXtra Length) model, which aims to unleash the long-description understanding capability of video CLIP models. Firstly, we establish an automatic data collection system and gather a large-scale VILD pre-training dataset with VIdeo and Long-Description pairs. Then, we propose Text-similarity-guided Primary Component Matching (TPCM) to better learn the distribution of feature space while expanding the long description capability. We also introduce two new tasks namely Detail-aware Description Ranking (DDR) and Hallucination-aware Description Ranking (HDR) for further understanding improvement. Finally, we... | Jiapeng Wang, Chengyu Wang, Kunzhe Huang, Jun Huang, Lianwen Jin |  |

Even though their capabilities of data synthesis have been studied well in recent years, the generated data suffers from a lack of diversity, less adherence to the prompt, and potential biases that creep into the data from the generator model. In this work, we tackle the challenge of generating datasets with high diversity, upon which a student model is trained for downstream tasks. Taking the route of decoding-time guidance-based approaches, we propose CorrSynth, which generates data that is more diverse and faithful to the input prompt using a correlated sampling strategy. Further, our method overcomes the complexity drawbacks of some other guidance-based techniques like classifier-based guidance. With extensive experiments, we show the effectiveness of our approach and substantiate our claims. In particular, we perform intrinsic evaluation to show the... | Suhas S.

To address this question, we review standard definitions of knowledge in epistemology and we formalize interpretations applicable to LLMs. In doing so, we identify inconsistencies and gaps in how current NLP research conceptualizes knowledge with respect to epistemological frameworks. Additionally, we conduct a survey of 100 professional philosophers and computer scientists to compare their preferences in knowledge definitions and their views on whether LLMs can really be said to know. Finally, we suggest evaluation protocols for testing knowledge in accordance to the most relevant definitions. | Constanza Fierro, Ruchira Dhar, Filippos Stamatiou, Nicolas Garneau, Anders Søgaard |  |

Existing works use simple datasets similar to table-to-text tasks and employ methods that ignore domain structures. As a bridge between raw text and statistical analysis, the text-to-table task often deals with complex semi-structured texts that refer to specific domain topics in the real world with entities and events, especially from those of social sciences. In this paper, we analyze the limitations of benchmark datasets and methods used in the text-to-table literature and redefine the text-to-table task to improve its compatibility with long text-processing tasks. Based on this redefinition, we propose a new dataset called CPL (Chinese Private Lending), which consists of judgments from China and is derived from a real-world legal academic project. We further propose TKGT (Text-KG-Table), a two stages domain-aware pipeline, which firstly generates domain knowledge graphs... | Peiwen Jiang, Xinbo Lin, Zibo Zhao, Ruhui Ma, Yvonne Jie Chen, Jinhua Cheng |  |

As a result, LLM-powered code generation applications have sprung up, vastly boosting user productivity. This paper mainly explores how to improve the efficiency and experience of users in formatting the document. Specifically, we propose an automatic document formatting method, Text-to-Format, which is driven by various prompting strategies. Text-to-Format takes the user’s formatting instructions and then generates code that can be run in Microsoft Word to format the content in a document. Further, to evaluate automatic document formatting approaches and advance the document formatting task, we built an evaluation specification including a high-quality dataset DocFormEval data, a code runtime environment, and evaluation metrics. Extensive experimental results on data reveal that the prompting strategy’s effect positively correlates with how much knowledge it introduces related to... | Shihao Rao, Liang Li, Jiapeng Liu, Weixin Guan, Xiyan Gao, Bing Lim, Can Ma |  |

Continual pre-training (CPT) enhances LLM capabilities by imbuing new domain-specific or proprietary knowledge while replaying general corpus to prevent catastrophic forgetting. The data mixture ratio of general corpus and domain-specific corpus, however, has been chosen heuristically, leading to sub-optimal training efficiency in practice. In this context, we attempt to re-visit the scaling behavior of LLMs under the hood of CPT, and discover a power-law relationship between loss, mixture ratio, and training tokens scale. We formalize the trade-off between general and domain-specific capabilities, leading to a well-defined Critical Mixture Ratio (CMR) of general and domain data. By striking the balance, CMR maintains the model’s general ability and achieves the desired domain transfer, ensuring the highest utilization of available... | Jiawei Gu, Zacc Yang, Chuanghao Ding, Rui Zhao, Fei Tan |  |

However, those powerful MLLMs such as GPT-4V still fail spectacularly when presented with certain image and text inputs. In this paper, we identify a typical class of inputs that baffles MLLMs, which consist of images that are highly relevant but inconsistent with answers, causing MLLMs to suffer from visual illusion. To quantify the effect, we propose CorrelationQA, the first benchmark that assesses the visual illusion level given spurious images. This benchmark contains 7,308 text-image pairs across 13 categories. Based on the proposed CorrelationQA, we conduct a thorough analysis on 9 mainstream MLLMs, illustrating that they universally suffer from this instinctive bias to varying degrees. We hope that our curated benchmark and evaluation... | Tianyang Han, Qing Lian, Rui Pan, Renjie Pi, Jipeng Zhang, Shizhe Diao, Yong Lin, Tong Zhang |  |

Current approaches typically train verifier models by labeling solutions as correct or incorrect based solely on whether the final answer matches the gold answer. However, this approach neglects any flawed rationale in the solution yielding the correct answer, undermining the verifier’s ability to distinguish between sound and flawed rationales. We empirically show that in StrategyQA, only 19% of LLM-generated solutions with correct answers have valid rationales, thus leading to an unreliable verifier. Furthermore, we demonstrate that training a verifier on valid rationales significantly improves its ability to distinguish valid and flawed rationale. To make a better verifier without extra human supervision, we introduce REPS (Rationale Enhancement through Pairwise Selection), a method for selecting valid rationales from candidates by iteratively applying pairwise... | Akira Kawabata, Saku Sugawara |  |

Model editing enables the manipulation of specific knowledge memories and the behavior of language generation without retraining. However, the robustness of model editing remains an open question. This work seeks to understand the strengths and limitations of editing methods, facilitating practical applications of communicative AI. We focus on three key research questions. RQ1: Can edited LLMs behave consistently resembling communicative AI in realistic situations? RQ2: To what extent does the rephrasing of prompts lead LLMs to deviate from the edited knowledge memory? RQ3: Which knowledge features are correlated with the performance and robustness of editing? Our empirical studies uncover a substantial disparity between existing editing methods and the practical application of LLMs. On rephrased prompts that are flexible but common in realistic... | Xinbei Ma, Tianjie Ju, Jiyang Qiu, Zhuosheng Zhang, Hai Zhao, Lifeng Liu, Yulong Wang |  |

However, fine-tuning the model with a large number of parameters on limited downstream datasets often leads to vulnerability to adversarial attacks, causing overfitting of the model on standard datasets. To address these issues, we propose IM-BERT from the perspective of a dynamic system by conceptualizing a layer of BERT as a solution of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). Under the situation of initial value perturbation, we analyze the numerical stability of two main numerical ODE solvers: \*the explicit and implicit Euler approaches.\* Based on these analyses, we introduce a numerically robust IM-connection incorporating BERT’s layers. This strategy enhances the robustness of PLMs against adversarial attacks, even in low-resource scenarios, without introducing additional parameters or adversarial training strategies.

However, even meticulously aligned LLMs remain vulnerable to malicious manipulations such as jailbreaking, leading to unintended behaviors. In this work, we propose a novel black-box jailbreak framework for automated red teaming of LLMs. We designed malicious content concealing and memory reframing with an iterative optimization algorithm to jailbreak LLMs, motivated by the research about the distractibility and over-confidence phenomenon of LLMs. Extensive experiments of jailbreaking both open-source and proprietary LLMs demonstrate the superiority of our framework in terms of effectiveness, scalability and transferability. We also evaluate the effectiveness of existing jailbreak defense methods against our attack and highlight the crucial need to develop more effective and practical defense strategies. | Zeguan Xiao, Yan Yang, Guanhua Chen, Yun Chen |  |

Among the various approaches for XMC, tree-based linear models are effective due to their superior efficiency and simplicity. However, the space complexity of tree-based methods is not well-studied. Many past works assume that storing the model is not affordable and apply techniques such as pruning to save space, which may lead to performance loss. In this work, we conduct both theoretical and empirical analyses on the space to store a tree model under the assumption of sparse data, a condition frequently met in text data. We found that, some features may be unused when training binary classifiers in a tree method, resulting in zero values in the weight vectors. Hence, storing only non-zero elements can greatly save space. Our experimental results indicate that tree models can require less than 10% of the size of the standard one-vs-rest method for multi-label text classification.

However, there is still much that is not known about anxiety, such as how it relates to our body and how it manifests in language; especially pertinent given the increasing impact of related disorders.In this work,we introduce WorryWords, the first large-scale repository of manually derived word–anxiety associations for over 44,450 English words. We show that the anxiety associations are highly reliable.We use WorryWords to study the relationship between anxiety and other emotion constructs, as well as the rate at which children acquire anxiety words with age. Finally, we show that using WorryWords alone, one can accurately track the change of anxiety in streams of text.WorryWords enables a wide variety of anxiety-related research in psychology, NLP, public health, and social sciences.WorryWords (and its translations to over 100 languages) is freely available.... | Saif Mohammad |  |

However, concerns persist over the accuracy of these assessments and the potential for misleading conclusions. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of LLMs as evaluators for text generation tasks. We propose FBI, a novel framework designed to examine the proficiency of Evaluator LLMs in assessing four critical abilities in other LLMs: factual accuracy, instruction following, coherence in long-form writing, and reasoning proficiency. By introducing targeted perturbations in answers generated by LLMs, that clearly impact one of these key capabilities, we test whether an Evaluator LLM can detect these quality drops. By creating a total of 2400 perturbed answers covering 22 perturbation categories, we conduct a comprehensive study using different evaluation strategies on five prominent LLMs commonly used as evaluators in... | Sumanth Doddapaneni, Mohammed Safi Ur Rahman Khan, Sshubam Verma, Mitesh M.

However, question-answering (QA) on lengthy documents faces challenges of resource constraints and a high propensity for errors, even for the most advanced models such as GPT-4 and Claude2.In this paper, we introduce _LongAgent_, a multi-agent collaboration method that enables efficient and effective QA over 128k-token-long documents. _LongAgent_ adopts a _divide-and-conquer_ strategy, breaking down lengthy documents into shorter, more manageable text chunks. A leader agent comprehends the user’s query and organizes the member agents to read their assigned chunks, reasoning a final answer through multiple rounds of discussion.Due to members’ hallucinations, it’s difficult to guarantee that every response provided by each member is accurate.To address this, we develop an _inter-member communication_ mechanism that facilitates information sharing, allowing for the detection and... | Jun Zhao, Can Zu, Xu Hao, Yi Lu, Wei He, Yiwen Ding, Tao Gui, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang |  |

First, we curate a large collection of arguments and gather human evaluations of their persuasiveness. Next, we introduce a novel topic model to identify the features of these arguments that influence persuasion. Finally, we use the model to predict the persuasiveness of new arguments and to assess the causal effects of argument components, offering an explanation of the results. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoPersuade in an experimental study on arguments for veganism, validating our findings through human studies and out-of-sample predictions. | Till Saenger, Musashi Hinck, Justin Grimmer, Brandon M.

These variations may also be caused by transcreation, an adaptation process that entails more than transliteration and word-for-word translation. In this paper, we address the problem of cross-cultural translation on two fronts: (i) we introduce XC-Translate, the first large-scale, manually-created benchmark for machine translation that focuses on text that contains potentially culturally-nuanced entity names, and (ii) we propose KG-MT, a novel end-to-end method to integrate information from a multilingual knowledge graph into a neural machine translation model by leveraging a dense retrieval mechanism. Our experiments and analyses show that current machine translation systems and large language models still struggle to translate texts containing entity names, whereas KG-MT outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin, obtaining a 129%... | Simone Conia, Daniel Lee, Min Li, Umar Farooq Minhas, Saloni Potdar, Yunyao Li |  |

In this work, we investigate the compositionality of large language models (LLMs) in mathematical reasoning. Specifically, we construct a new dataset MathTrap by introducing carefully designed logical traps into the problem descriptions of MATH and GSM8K. Since problems with logical flaws are quite rare in the real world, these represent “unseen” cases to LLMs. Solving these requires the models to systematically compose (1) the mathematical knowledge involved in the original problems with (2) knowledge related to the introduced traps. Our experiments show that while LLMs possess both components of requisite knowledge, they do not spontaneously combine them to handle these novel cases. We explore several methods to mitigate this deficiency, such as natural language... | Jun Zhao, Jingqi Tong, Yurong Mou, Ming Zhang, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang |  |

In this study, we present the scaling laws for linear complexity language models to establish a foundation for their scalability. Specifically, we examine the scaling behaviors of three efficient linear architectures. These include TNL, a linear attention model with data-independent decay; HGRN2, a linear RNN with data-dependent decay; and cosFormer2, a linear attention model without decay. We also include LLaMA as a baseline architecture for comparison with softmax attention. These models were trained with six variants, ranging from 70M to 7B parameters on a 300B-token corpus, and evaluated with a total of 1,376 intermediate checkpoints on various downstream tasks. These tasks include validation loss, commonsense reasoning, and information retrieval and generation.

Like typical AES systems, multi-trait AES employs the quadratic weighted kappa (QWK) to measure agreement with human raters, aligning closely with the rating schema; however, its non-differentiable nature prevents its direct use in neural network training. In this paper, we propose Scoring-aware Multi-reward Reinforcement Learning (SaMRL), which integrates actual evaluation schemes into the training process by designing QWK-based rewards with a mean-squared error penalty for multi-trait AES. Existing reinforcement learning (RL) applications in AES are limited to classification models despite associated performance degradation, as RL requires probability distributions; instead, we adopt an autoregressive score generation framework to leverage token generation probabilities for robust multi-trait score predictions. Empirical analyses demonstrate that SaMRL... | Heejin Do, Sangwon Ryu, Gary Geunbae Lee |  |

In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of moral self-correction by answering three research questions: (1) In what scenarios does moral self-correction work? (2) What are the internal mechanisms of LLMs, e.g., hidden states, that are influenced by moral self-correction instructions? (3) Is intrinsic moral self-correction actually superficial in terms of reduced immorality in hidden states? We argue that self-correction can help LLMs find a shortcut to more morally correct output, rather than truly reducing the immorality stored in hidden states.Through empirical investigation with tasks of language... | Guangliang Liu, Haitao Mao, Jiliang Tang, Kristen Marie Johnson |  |

CKGC methods can be roughly divided into two categories: triple-based methods and text-based methods. Due to the imbalanced distribution of entities and limited structural information, triple-based methods struggle with long-tail entities. Text-based methods alleviate this issue, but require extensive training and fine-tuning of language models, which reduces efficiency. To alleviate these problems, we propose ATAP, the first CKGC framework that utilizes automatically generated continuous prompt templates combined with pre-trained language models (PLMs). Moreover, ATAP uses a carefully designed new prompt template training strategy, guiding PLMs to generate optimal prompt templates for CKGC tasks. Combining the rich knowledge of PLMs with the template automatic augmentation strategy, ATAP effectively mitigates the long-tail problem and enhances CKGC performance.... | Fu Zhang, Yifan Ding, Jingwei Cheng |  |

Existing studies show that providing guidance via decomposing the original question into multiple subproblems elicits more robustness in LLM reasoning – a decomposer generates the subproblems, and a solver solves each of these subproblems. However, these techniques fail to accommodate coordination between the decomposer and the solver modules (either in a single model or different specialized ones) – the decomposer does not keep track of the ability of the solver to follow the decomposed reasoning. In this paper, we propose LM2 to address these challenges. LM2 modularizes the decomposition, solution, and verification into three different language models. The decomposer module identifies the key concepts necessary to solve the problem and generates step-by-step subquestions according to the reasoning requirement. The solver model generates the solution to... | Gurusha Juneja, Subhabrata Dutta, Tanmoy Chakraborty |  |

Traditionally, surprisal theory treats words as distinct entities, overlooking any potential similarity between them. Giulianelli et al. (2023) address this limitation by introducing information value, a measure of predictability designed to account for similarities between communicative units. Our work leverages Ricotta and Szeidl’s (2006) diversity index to extend surprisal into a metric that we term similarity-adjusted surprisal, exposing a mathematical relationship between surprisal and information value. Similarity-adjusted surprisal aligns with information value when considering graded similarities and reduces to standard surprisal when words are treated as distinct. Experimental results with reading time data indicate that similarity-adjusted surprisal adds predictive power beyond standard surprisal for certain datasets,... | Clara Meister, Mario Giulianelli, Tiago Pimentel |  |

It usually relies on two independent steps, information retrieval then reading comprehension, that do not benefit each other. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a solution by using generated answers as feedback for retrieval training. RAG usually relies solely on pseudo-relevant passages retrieved from external knowledge bases which can lead to ineffective answer generation. In this work, we propose a multi-level information RAG approach that enhances answer generation through entity retrieval and query expansion. We formulate a joint-training RAG loss such that answer generation is conditioned on both entity and passage retrievals. We show through experiments new state-of-the-art performance on the VIQuAE KB-VQA benchmark and demonstrate that our approach can help retrieve more actual relevant knowledge to generate accurate... | Omar Adjali, Olivier Ferret, Sahar Ghannay, Hervé Le Borgne |  |

However, the high cost of inaccurate summaries in risk-critical applications, particularly those involving human-in-the-loop decision-making, raises concerns about the reliability of uncertainty estimation on text summarization (UE-TS) evaluation methods. This concern stems from the dependency of uncertainty model metrics on diverse and potentially conflicting NLG metrics. To address this issue, we introduce a comprehensive UE-TS benchmark incorporating 31 NLG metrics across four dimensions. The benchmark evaluates the uncertainty estimation capabilities of two large language models and one pre-trained language model on three datasets, with human-annotation analysis incorporated where applicable. We also assess the performance of 14 common uncertainty estimation methods within this benchmark. Our findings emphasize the importance of considering multiple uncorrelated NLG metrics and diverse... | Jianfeng He, Runing Yang, Linlin Yu, Changbin Li, Ruoxi Jia, Feng Chen, Ming Jin, ChangTien Lu |  |

Towards Genuinely Difficult Long Context NLP](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.924) |  | 0 | Improvements in language models’ capabilities have pushed their applications towards longer contexts, making long-context evaluation and development an active research area. However, many disparate use-cases are grouped together under the umbrella term of “long-context”, defined simply by the total length of the model’s input, including - for example - Needle-in-a-Haystack tasks, book summarization, and information aggregation. Given their varied difficulty, in this position paper we argue that conflating different tasks by their context length is unproductive. As a community, we require a more precise vocabulary to understand what makes long-context tasks similar or different. We propose to unpack the taxonomy of long-context based on the properties that make them more difficult with longer contexts. We propose two orthogonal axes of difficulty: (I) Diffusion: How hard is it to find the necessary information in the context? (II) Scope: How much necessary information is there to find?... | Omer Goldman, Alon Jacovi, Aviv Slobodkin, Aviya Maimon, Ido Dagan, Reut Tsarfaty |  |

However, they still mostly utilize the classical Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) algorithm, a simple and reliable method. BPE has been shown to cause such issues as under-trained tokens and sub-optimal compression that may affect the downstream performance. We introduce PickyBPE, a modified BPE algorithm that carries out vocabulary refinement during tokenizer training by removing merges that leave intermediate “junk” tokens. Our method improves vocabulary efficiency, eliminates under-trained tokens, and does not compromise text compression. Our experiments show that this method either improves downstream performance or does not harm it. | Pavel Chizhov, Catherine Arnett, Elizaveta Korotkova, Ivan P. Yamshchikov |  |

However, simply increasing the context window does not guarantee robust performance across diverse long-input processing tasks, such as understanding extensive documents and extracting detailed information from lengthy and noisy data. In response, we introduce Segment+, a general framework that enables LMs to handle extended inputs within limited context windows efficiently. Segment+ utilizes structured notes and a filtering module to manage information flow, resulting in a system that is both controllable and interpretable. Our extensive experiments across various model sizes, focusing on long-document question-answering and Needle-in-a-Haystack tasks, demonstrate the effectiveness of Segment+ in improving performance. | Wei Shi, Shuang Li, Kerun Yu, Jinglei Chen, Zujie Liang, Xinhui Wu, Yuxi Qian, Feng Wei, Bo Zheng, Jiaqing Liang, Jiangjie Chen, Yanghua Xiao |  |

Recent advances in language models (LMs) have made it possible to automatically generate feedback that is actionable and well-aligned with human-specified attributes. However, it remains unclear whether the feedback generated by these models is truly effective in enhancing the quality of student revisions. Moreover, prompting LMs with a precise set of instructions to generate feedback is nontrivial due to the lack of consensus regarding the specific attributes that can lead to improved revising performance. To address these challenges, we propose PROF that PROduces Feedback via learning from LM simulated student revisions. PROF aims to iteratively optimize the feedback generator by directly maximizing the effectiveness of students’ overall revising performance as simulated by LMs. Focusing on an economic essay assignment, we empirically test the efficacy of PROF and observe that our approach not... | Inderjeet Nair, Jiaye Tan, Xiaotian Su, Anne Gere, Xu Wang, Lu Wang |  |

The challenge of tool use demands that LLMs not only understand user queries and generate answers accurately but also excel in task planning, tool invocation, and result summarization. While traditional works focus on training a single LLM with all these capabilities, performance limitations become apparent, particularly with smaller models. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach that decomposes the aforementioned capabilities into a planner, caller, and summarizer. Each component is implemented by a single LLM that focuses on a specific capability and collaborates with others to accomplish the task. This modular framework facilitates individual updates and the potential use of smaller LLMs for building each capability.

While the attention mechanism and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) have been studied independently, their interactions remain largely unexplored. This study investigates how attention heads and next-token neurons interact in LLMs to predict new words. We propose a methodology to identify next-token neurons, find prompts that highly activate them, and determine the upstream attention heads responsible. We then generate and evaluate explanations for the activity of these attention heads in an automated manner. Our findings reveal that some attention heads recognize specific contexts relevant to predicting a token and activate a downstream token-predicting neuron accordingly. This mechanism provides a deeper understanding of how attention heads work with MLP neurons to perform next-token prediction. Our approach offers a foundation for further... | Clement Neo, Shay B.

Evaluating Large Language Models for Comorbid Mental Health Diagnosis](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.931) |  | 0 | In this study, we introduce ANGST, a novel, first of its kind benchmark for depression-anxiety comorbidity classification from social media posts. Unlike contemporary datasets that often oversimplify the intricate interplay between different mental health disorders by treating them as isolated conditions, ANGST enables multi-label classification, allowing each post to be simultaneously identified as indicating depression and/or anxiety. Comprising 2876 meticulously annotated posts by expert psychologists and an additional 7667 silver-labeled posts, ANGST posits a more representative sample of online mental health discourse. Moreover, we benchmark ANGST using various state-of-the-art language models, ranging from Mental-BERT to GPT-4. Our results provide significant insights into the capabilities and limitations of these models in complex diagnostic scenarios. While GPT-4 generally outperforms other models, none achieve an F1 score exceeding 72% in multi-class comorbid classification,... | Amey Hengle, Atharva Kulkarni, Shantanu Patankar, Madhumitha Chandrasekaran, Sneha D'Silva, Jemima Jacob, Rashmi Gupta |  |

It helps people understand the principles of the real world better and benefits the decision-making process related to causation. For instance, commonsense causality is crucial in judging whether a defendant’s action causes the plaintiff’s loss in determining legal liability. Despite its significance, a systematic exploration of this topic is notably lacking. Our comprehensive survey bridges this gap by focusing on taxonomies, benchmarks, acquisition methods, qualitative reasoning, and quantitative measurements in commonsense causality, synthesizing insights from over 200 representative articles.

Some variations of this binary classification task have emerged, such as lexical complexity prediction (LCP) and complexity evaluation of multi-word expressions (MWE). Large language models (LLMs) recently became popular in the Natural Language Processing community because of their versatility and capability to solve unseen tasks in zero/few-shot settings. Our work investigates LLM usage, specifically open-source models such as Llama 2, Llama 3, and Vicuna v1.5, and closed-source, such as ChatGPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4o, in the CWI, LCP, and MWE settings. We evaluate zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings and show that LLMs struggle in certain conditions or achieve comparable results against existing methods.

While current model editing methods can effectively modify a model’s behavior within a specific area of interest, they often overlook the potential unintended side effects on the general abilities of LLMs such as reasoning, natural language inference, and question answering. In this paper, we raise concerns that model editing’s improvements on factuality may come at the cost of a significant degradation of the model’s general abilities. We systematically analyze the side effects by evaluating four popular editing methods on three LLMs across eight representative tasks. Our extensive empirical experiments show that it is challenging for current editing methods to simultaneously improve factuality of LLMs and maintain their general abilities. Our analysis reveals that the side effects are caused by model editing altering the... | JiaChen Gu, HaoXiang Xu, JunYu Ma, Pan Lu, ZhenHua Ling, KaiWei Chang, Nanyun Peng |  |

However, doctor-patient dialogue datasets are not readily available, primarily due to privacy regulations. Moreover, existing datasets lack comprehensive annotations involving medical slots and their different attributes, such as symptoms and their onset, progression, and severity. These comprehensive annotations are crucial for accurate diagnosis. Finally, most existing datasets are non-English, limiting their utility for the larger research community.In response, we introduce MediTOD, a new dataset of doctor-patient dialogues in English for the medical history-taking task.

We integrate insights from cognitive science to quantitatively examine how LLMs perform on n-back tasks—a benchmark used to assess working memory, which involves temporarily holding and manipulating information. Our findings reveal that despite the increased model size, LLMs still face significant challenges in holding and processing information effectively, especially under complex task conditions. We also assess various prompting strategies, revealing their diverse impacts on LLM performance. The results highlight the struggle of current LLMs to autonomously discover optimal problem-solving patterns without heavily relying on manually corrected prompts. To move beyond these constraints, fundamental improvements in the planning and search of LLMs are essential for them to reason autonomously.

However, their unethical applications, such as disseminating disinformation, have become a growing concern. Although recent works have proposed a number of LLM detection methods, their robustness and reliability remain unclear. In this paper, we present RAFT: a grammar error-free black-box attack against existing LLM detectors. In contrast to previous attacks for language models, our method exploits the transferability of LLM embeddings at the word-level while preserving the original text quality. We leverage an auxiliary embedding to greedily select candidate words to perturb against the target detector. Experiments reveal that our attack effectively compromises all detectors in the study across various domains by up to 99%, and are transferable across source models. Manual human evaluation studies show our attacks are realistic and indistinguishable from original human-written text. We also show... | James Wang, Ran Li, Junfeng Yang, Chengzhi Mao |  |

Most existing LLM benchmarks evaluate LLMs on i.i.d. tasks, overlooking their ability to learn iteratively from past experiences. Our paper bridges this evaluation gap by proposing a novel framework, LLM-Evolve, which extends established benchmarks to sequential problem-solving settings. LLM-Evolve evaluates LLMs over multiple rounds, providing feedback after each round to build a demonstration memory that the models can query in future tasks. We applied LLM-Evolve to the MMLU, GSM8K, and AgentBench benchmarks, testing 8 state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source models. Results show that LLMs can achieve performance improvements of up to 17% by learning from past interactions, with the quality of retrieval algorithms and feedback significantly... | Jiaxuan You, Mingjie Liu, Shrimai Prabhumoye, Mostofa Patwary, Mohammad Shoeybi, Bryan Catanzaro |  |

However, such impressive capability typically comes with a substantial model size, which presents significant challenges for autoregressive token-by-token generation. To mitigate computation overload incurred during generation, several early-exit and layer-dropping strategies have been proposed. Despite some promising success due to the redundancy across LLMs layers on metrics like Rough-L/BLUE, our careful knowledge-intensive evaluation unveils issues such as generation collapse, hallucination, and noticeable performance drop even at the trivial exit ratio of ~10-15% of layers. We attribute these errors primarily to ineffective handling of the KV cache through state copying during early exit. In this work, we observe the saturation of computationally expensive feed-forward blocks of LLM layers and propose FFN-SkipLLM, which is a novel... | Ajay Jaiswal, Bodun Hu, Lu Yin, Yeonju Ro, Tianlong Chen, Shiwei Liu, Aditya Akella |  |

This work explores the complexities of applying GEC systems to CSW texts. Our objectives include evaluating the performance of state-of-the-art GEC systems on an authentic CSW dataset from English as a Second Language (ESL) learners, exploring synthetic data generation as a solution to data scarcity, and developing a model capable of correcting grammatical errors in monolingual and CSW texts. We generated synthetic CSW GEC data, resulting in one of the first substantial datasets for this task, and showed that a model trained on this data is capable of significant improvements over existing systems. This work targets ESL learners, aiming to provide educational technologies that aid in the development of their English grammatical correctness without constraining their... | Tom Potter, Zheng Yuan |  |

A potential solution is found in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models which act like retrieving information before generating responses. In this study, we explore how the Atlas approach, a RAG model, decides between what it already knows (parametric) and what it retrieves (non-parametric). We use causal mediation analysis and controlled experiments to examine how internal representations influence information processing. Our findings disentangle the effects of parametric knowledge and the retrieved context. They indicate that in cases where the model can choose between both types of information (parametric and non-parametric), it relies more on the context than the parametric knowledge. Furthermore, the analysis investigates the computations involved in how the model uses the information from the context. We find that multiple mechanisms are active within the model and can be detected with... | Mehrdad Farahani, Richard Johansson |  |

While open-source models handle general image tasks effectively, they face challenges with the high computational demands of complex visually-situated text understanding. Such tasks often require increased token inputs and large vision modules to harness high-resolution information. Striking a balance between model size and data importance remains an open question. This study aims to redefine the design of vision-language models by identifying key components and creating efficient models with constrained inference costs. By strategically formulating datasets, optimizing vision modules, and enhancing supervision techniques, we achieve significant improvements in inference throughput while maintaining high performance. Extensive experiments across models ranging from 160M to 13B parameters offer insights into... | Geewook Kim, Minjoon Seo |  |

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable the creating of computational representations or “digital twins” of populations that generate human-like responses mimicking the population’s language, styles, and attitudes. We introduce Community-Cross-Instruct, an unsupervised framework for aligning LLMs to online communities to elicit their beliefs. Given a corpus of a community’s online discussions, Community-Cross-Instruct automatically generates instruction-output pairs by an advanced LLM to (1) finetune a foundational LLM to faithfully represent that community, and (2) evaluate the alignment of the finetuned model to the community. We demonstrate the method’s utility in accurately representing political and diet communities on Reddit. Unlike prior methods requiring human-authored instructions, Community-Cross-Instruct generates... | Zihao He, Minh Duc Chu, Rebecca Dorn, Siyi Guo, Kristina Lerman |  |

This benchmark is inspired by the Mathador game, where the objective is to reach a target number using basic arithmetic operations on a given set of base numbers, following a simple set of rules. We show that, across leading LLMs, we obtain stable average performance while generating benchmark instances dynamically, following a target difficulty level. Thus, our benchmark alleviates concerns about test-set leakage into training data, an issue that often undermines popular benchmarks. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of both open and closed-source state-of-the-art LLMs on Mathador-LM. Our findings reveal that contemporary models struggle with Mathador-LM, scoring significantly lower than average 3rd graders. This stands in stark contrast to their strong performance on popular mathematical... | Eldar Kurtic, Amir Moeini, Dan Alistarh |  |

In this work, we introduce a manually annotated benchmark of 241 questions across five categories specifically designed for quantitative spatial reasoning, and systematically investigate the performance of SoTA VLMs on this task. Our analysis reveals that questions involving reasoning about distances between objects are particularly challenging for SoTA VLMs; however, some VLMs perform significantly better at this task than others, with an almost 40 points gap between the two best performing models. We also make the surprising observation that the success rate of the top-performing VLM increases by 19 points when a reasoning path using a reference object emerges naturally in the response. Inspired by this observation, we develop... | YuanHong Liao, Rafid Mahmood, Sanja Fidler, David Acuna |  |

We address this question by creating NoCha, a dataset of 1,001 minimally different pairs of true and false claims about 67 recently-published English fictional books, written by human readers of those books. In contrast to existing long-context benchmarks, our annotators confirm that the largest share of pairs in NoCha require global reasoning over the entire book to verify. Our experiments show that while human readers easily perform this task, it is enormously challenging for all ten long-context LLMs that we evaluate: no open-weight model performs above random chance (despite their strong performance on synthetic benchmarks), while GPT-4o achieves the highest pair accuracy at 55.8%. Further analysis reveals that (1) on average, models perform much better... | Marzena Karpinska, Katherine Thai, Kyle Lo, Tanya Goyal, Mohit Iyyer |  |

To address this, we introduce FLAMe, a family of Foundational Large Autorater Models. FLAMe is trained on a diverse set of over 100 quality assessment tasks, incorporating 5M+ human judgments curated from publicly released human evaluations. FLAMe outperforms models like GPT-4 and Claude-3 on various held-out tasks, and serves as a powerful starting point for fine-tuning, as shown in our reward model evaluation case study (FLAMe-RM). On Reward-Bench, FLAMe-RM-24B achieves 87.8% accuracy, surpassing GPT-4-0125 (85.9%) and GPT-4o (84.7%). Additionally, we introduce FLAMe-Opt-RM, an efficient tail-patch fine-tuning approach that offers competitive RewardBench performance using 25×fewer training datapoints. Our FLAMe variants outperform popular proprietary LLM-as-a-Judge models on 8 of 12 autorater benchmarks, covering 53 quality assessment... | Tu Vu, Kalpesh Krishna, Salaheddin Alzubi, Chris Tar, Manaal Faruqui, YunHsuan Sung |  |

We consider a candidate universal much-discussed in the linguistics literature, the Final-over-Final Condition (Sheehan et al., 2017b). This Condition is syntactic in the sense that it can only be stated by reference to abstract sentence properties such as nested phrases and head direction. A study of typologically diverse “mixed head direction” languages confirms that the Condition holds in corpora. But in a targeted syntactic evaluation, Gemini Pro only seems to respect the Condition in German, Russian, Hungarian and Serbian. These relatively high-resource languages contrast with Basque, where Gemini Pro does not seem to have learned the Condition at all. This result suggests that modern language models may need additional sources of bias in order to become truly human-like, within a developmentally-realistic budget of training data. | John T.

The most notable among such methods is Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and its offline variant Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), both of which seek to maximize a reward model based on human preferences. In particular, DPO derives reward signals directly from the offline preference data, but in doing so overfits the reward signals and generates suboptimal responses that may contain human biases in the dataset. In this work, we propose a practical application of a diversity-seeking RL algorithm called GFlowNet-DPO (GDPO) in an offline preference alignment setting to curtail such challenges. Empirical results show GDPO can generate far more diverse responses than the baseline methods that are still relatively aligned with human values in dialog generation and summarization tasks. | Oh Joon Kwon, Daiki E.

This raises concerns about the societal impact that could arise if the ideologies within these models can be easily manipulated. In this work, we investigate how effectively LLMs can learn and generalize ideological biases from their instruction-tuning data. Our findings reveal a concerning vulnerability: exposure to only a small amount of ideologically driven samples significantly alters the ideology of LLMs. Notably, LLMs demonstrate a startling ability to absorb ideology from one topic and generalize it to even unrelated ones. The ease with which LLMs’ ideologies can be skewed underscores the risks associated with intentionally poisoned training data by malicious actors or inadvertently introduced biases by data annotators. It also emphasizes the imperative for robust safeguards to mitigate the influence of ideological manipulations on LLMs. | Kai Chen, Zihao He, Jun Yan, Taiwei Shi, Kristina Lerman |  |

While these metrics are indispensable, they do not speak to a story’s subjective, psychological impact from a reader’s perspective. We introduce the Psychological Depth Scale (PDS), a novel framework rooted in literary theory that measures an LLM’s ability to produce authentic and narratively complex stories that provoke emotion, empathy, and engagement. We empirically validate our framework by showing that humans can consistently evaluate stories based on PDS (0.72 Krippendorff’s alpha). We also explore techniques for automating the PDS to easily scale future analyses. GPT-4o, combined with a novel Mixture-of-Personas (MoP) prompting strategy, achieves an average Spearman correlation of 0.51 with human judgment while Llama-3-70B with constrained decoding scores as high as 0.68 for empathy.

This study investigates the nuances of media framing on public perception and understanding by examining how events are presented within news articles. Unlike previous research that primarily focused on word choice as a framing device, this work explores the comprehensive narrative construction through events and their relations. Our method integrates event extraction, cross-document event coreference, and causal relationship mapping among events to extract framing devices employed by media to assess their role in framing the narrative. We evaluate our approach with a media attitude detection task and show that the use of event mentions, event cluster descriptors, and their causal relations effectively captures the subtle nuances of framing, thereby providing deeper insights into the attitudes conveyed by news... | Jin Zhao, Jingxuan Tu, Han Du, Nianwen Xue |  |

Most existing calibration methods often negatively impact model accuracy due to the lack of diversity of validation data, resulting in reduced generalizability. To address this, we propose a calibration method that incorporates synthetic data without compromising accuracy. We derive the expected calibration error (ECE) bound using the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning framework. Large language models (LLMs), known for their ability to mimic real data and generate text with mixed class labels, are utilized as a synthetic data generation strategy to lower the ECE bound and improve model accuracy on real test data. Additionally, we propose data generation mechanisms for efficient calibration. Testing our method on four different natural language processing tasks, we observed an average up to 34% increase in accuracy... | Yang Ba, Michelle Mancenido, Rong Pan |  |

While some research has made progress in tackling ambiguous settings where multiple valid answers exist, these approaches often neglect to provide source citations, leaving users to evaluate the factuality of each answer. On the other hand, existing work on citation generation has focused on unambiguous settings with single answers, failing to address the complexity of real-world scenarios. Despite the importance of both aspects, no prior research has combined them, leaving a significant gap in the development of QA systems. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing the novel task of QA with source citation in ambiguous settings, where multiple valid answers exist. To facilitate research in this area, we create a comprehensive framework consisting of: (1) five novel datasets, obtained by augmenting three existing reading... | Sagi Shaier, Ari Kobren, Philip V.

As these models are widely deployed in consumer applications, they could lead to new privacy risks due to emergent abilities to identify people in photos, geolocate images, etc. As we demonstrate, somewhat surprisingly, current open-source and proprietary VLMs are very capable image geolocators, making widespread geolocation with VLMs an immediate privacy risk, rather than merely a theoretical future concern. As a first step to address this challenge, we develop a new benchmark, GPTGeoChat, to test the capability of VLMs to moderate geolocation dialogues with users. We collect a set of 1,000 image geolocation conversations between in-house annotators and GPT-4v, which are annotated with the granularity of location information revealed at each turn. Using this new dataset we evaluate the ability of various VLMs to moderate GPT-4v geolocation conversations by determining when... | Ethan Mendes, Yang Chen, James Hays, Sauvik Das, Wei Xu, Alan Ritter |  |

Properly measuring their readability is the first step towards making them more accessible. Here, we present the first systematic study on fine-grained readability measurements in the medical domain, at both sentence-level and span-level. We first introduce a new dataset MedReadMe, which consists of manually annotated readability ratings and fine-grained complex span annotation for 4,520 sentences, featuring two novel “Google-Easy” and “Google-Hard” categories. It supports our quantitative analysis, which covers 650 linguistic features and additional complex span features, to answer “why medical sentences are so hard.” Enabled by our high-quality annotation, we benchmark several state-of-the-art sentence-level readability metrics, including unsupervised, supervised, and prompting-based methods using recently developed large language models (LLMs). Informed by our fine-grained complex span annotation, we find that adding a single... | Chao Jiang, Wei Xu |  |

While previous research in multimodal analysis has primarily focused on singular aspects such as hate speech and its subclasses, this study expands this focus to encompass multiple aspects of linguistics: hate, targets of hate, stance, and humor. We introduce a novel dataset PrideMM comprising 5,063 text-embedded images associated with the LGBTQ+ Pride movement, thereby addressing a serious gap in existing resources. We conduct extensive experimentation on PrideMM by using unimodal and multimodal baseline methods to establish benchmarks for each task. Additionally, we propose a novel framework MemeCLIP for efficient downstream learning while preserving the knowledge of the pre-trained CLIP model. The results of our experiments show that MemeCLIP achieves superior performance compared to previously... | Siddhant Bikram Shah, Shuvam Shiwakoti, Maheep Chaudhary, Haohan Wang |  |

While many story reading systems have been developed for this activity, they often fail to infuse real-world knowledge into the conversation. This limitation can be attributed to the existing question-answering (QA) datasets used for children’s education, upon which the systems are built, failing to capture the nuances of how education experts think when conducting interactive story reading activities. To bridge this gap, we design an annotation framework, empowered by existing knowledge graph to capture experts’ annotations and thinking process, and leverage this framework to construct StorySparkQA dataset, which comprises 5, 868 expert-annotated QA pairs with real-world knowledge. We conduct automated and human expert evaluations across various QA pair generation settings to demonstrate that our StorySparkQA can effectively... | Jiaju Chen, Yuxuan Lu, Shao Zhang, Bingsheng Yao, Yuanzhe Dong, Ying Xu, Yunyao Li, Qianwen Wang, Dakuo Wang, Yuling Sun |  |

Besides, current Med-VQA algorithms, typically reliant on singular models, lack the robustness needed for real-world medical diagnostics which usually require collaborative expert evaluation. To address these shortcomings, this paper presents MedCoT, a novel hierarchical expert verification reasoning chain method designed to enhance interpretability and accuracy in biomedical imaging inquiries. MedCoT is predicated on two principles: The necessity for explicit reasoning paths in Med-VQA and the requirement for multi-expert review to formulate accurate conclusions. The methodology involves an Initial Specialist proposing diagnostic rationales, followed by a Follow-up Specialist who validates these rationales, and finally, a consensus... | Jiaxiang Liu, Yuan Wang, Jiawei Du, Joey Zhou, Zuozhu Liu |  |

Consequently, traditional sentence encoders must be capable of generating conditioned sentence representations that account for diverse conditions or aspects. In this paper, we propose a novel yet efficient framework based on transformer-style language models that facilitates advanced conditioned sentence representation while maintaining model parameters and computational efficiency. Empirical evaluations on the Conditional Semantic Textual Similarity and Knowledge Graph Completion tasks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework. | Ziyong Lin, Quansen Wang, Zixia Jia, Zilong Zheng |  |

Existing methods target instructions from real instruction dialogues as a learning goal and fine-tune a user simulator for posing instructions. However, the user simulator struggles to implicitly model complex dialogue flows and pose high-quality instructions. In this paper, we take inspiration from the cognitive abilities inherent in human learning and propose the explicit modeling of complex dialogue flows through instructional strategy reuse. Specifically, we first induce high-level strategies from various real instruction dialogues. These strategies are applied to new dialogue scenarios deductively, where the instructional strategies facilitate high-quality instructions. Experimental results show that our method can generate diverse, in-depth, and insightful... | Jiao Ou, Jiayu Wu, Che Liu, Fuzheng Zhang, Di Zhang, Kun Gai |  |

These routes can be represented as graphs where nodes correspond to token representations and edges to computations. We automatically build these graphs in a top-down manner, for each prediction leaving only the most important nodes and edges. In contrast to the existing workflows relying on activation patching, we do this through attribution: this allows us to efficiently uncover existing circuits with just a single forward pass. Unlike with patching, we do not need a human to carefully design prediction templates, and we can extract information flow routes for any prediction (not just the ones among the allowed templates). As a result, we can analyze model behavior in general, for specific types of predictions, or different domains. We experiment with Llama 2 and show that some attention head roles are overall important, e.g. previous token heads and subword merging heads. Next, we find... | Javier Ferrando, Elena Voita |  |

The key idea is to use an LLM as a pure language model in a conventional manner. The LLM goes through the input sentence from the beginning, and at each inference step, produces a distribution over its vocabulary for deciding the next token, given a partial sentence. To ensure that the output sentence remains faithful to the input sentence, we design a minimal distortion model that utilizes pronunciation or shape similarities between the original and replaced characters. Furthermore, we propose two useful reward strategies to address practical challenges specific to the CSC task. Experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves LLM performance, enabling them to compete with state-of-the-art domain-general CSC models. | Houquan Zhou, Zhenghua Li, Bo Zhang, Chen Li, Shaopeng Lai, Ji Zhang, Fei Huang, Min Zhang |  |

To perform in-context entity tracking, language models (LMs) must bind an entity to its attribute (e.g., bind a container to its content) to recall attribute for a given entity. For example, given a context mentioning “The coffee is in Box Z, the stone is in Box M, the map is in Box H”, to infer “Box Z contains the coffee” later, LMs must bind “Box Z” to “coffee”. To explain the binding behaviour of LMs, existing research introduces a Binding ID mechanism and states that LMs use a abstract concept called Binding ID (BI) to internally mark entity-attribute pairs. However, they have not directly captured the BI information from entity activations. In this work, we provide a novel view of the Binding ID mechanism by localizing the BI information. Specifically, we discover that there exists a low-rank subspace in the hidden state (or activation) of LMs, that primarily encodes BIs. To identify this subspace, we take principle component... | Qin Dai, Benjamin Heinzerling, Kentaro Inui |  |

Previous red teaming approaches for LLM safety have primarily focused on single prompt attacks or goal hijacking. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study LLM safety in multi-turn dialogue coreference. We created a dataset of 1,400 questions across 14 categories, each featuring multi-turn coreference safety attacks. We then conducted detailed evaluations on five widely used open-source LLMs. The results indicated that under multi-turn coreference safety attacks, the highest attack success rate was 56% with the LLaMA2-Chat-7b model, while the lowest was 13.9% with the Mistral-7B-Instruct model. These findings highlight the safety vulnerabilities in LLMs during dialogue coreference interactions. | Erxin Yu, Jing Li, Ming Liao, Siqi Wang, Zuchen Gao, Fei Mi, Lanqing Hong |  |

However, a significant gap remains in evaluating domain-specific information retrieval – the basis for answer generation. To address this challenge, this work simulates the typical tasks of a sustainability analyst by examining 30 sustainability reports with 16 detailed climate-related questions. As a result, we obtain a dataset with over 8.5K unique question-source-answer pairs labeled by different levels of relevance. Furthermore, we develop a use case with the dataset to investigate the integration of expert knowledge into information retrieval with embeddings. Although we show that incorporating expert knowledge works, we also outline the critical limitations of embeddings in knowledge-intensive downstream domains like climate change communication. | Tobias Schimanski, Jingwei Ni, Roberto Martín, Nicola Ranger, Markus Leippold |  |

To predict instances for novel relations with limited training examples, few-shot relation learning approaches have emerged, utilizing techniques such as meta-learning. However, the assumption is that novel relations in meta-testing and base relations in meta-training are independently and identically distributed, which may not hold in practice. To address the limitation, we propose RelAdapter, a context-aware adapter for few-shot relation learning in KGs designed to enhance the adaptation process in meta-learning. First, RelAdapter is equipped with a lightweight adapter module that facilitates relation-specific, tunable adaptation of meta-knowledge in a parameter-efficient manner. Second, RelAdapter is enriched with contextual information about the target relation, enabling enhanced adaptation to each distinct relation.

Zero-shot detectors, due to their training-free nature, have received considerable attention and notable success. In this paper, we identify a new feature, token cohesiveness, that is useful for zero-shot detection, and we demonstrate that LLM-generated text tends to exhibit higher token cohesiveness than human-written text. Based on this observation, we devise TOCSIN, a generic dual-channel detection paradigm that uses token cohesiveness as a plug-and-play module to improve existing zero-shot detectors. To calculate token cohesiveness, TOCSIN only requires a few rounds of random token deletion and semantic difference measurement, making it particularly suitable for a practical black-box setting where the source model used for generation is not accessible. Extensive experiments with four state-of-the-art base detectors on various... | Shixuan Ma, Quan Wang |  |

Existing methods have made great progress in modal alignment and fusion, however, two vital limitations are neglected: (I) close entanglement of multimodal semantics with modal structures; (II) insufficient learning of the causal effects of semantic and modality-specific information on the final predictions under the end-to-end training fashion. To alleviate the above limitations, we introduce the Dual-oriented Disentangled Network with Counterfactual Intervention (DuoDN). DuoDN addresses key limitations in current systems by effectively disentangling and utilizing modality-specific and multimodal semantic information. The model consists of a Dual-oriented Disentangled Encoder that decouples semantics-oriented and modality-oriented representations, alongside a... | Zhanpeng Chen, Zhihong Zhu, Xianwei Zhuang, Zhiqi Huang, Yuexian Zou |  |

This paper provides a comprehensive overview of jailbreaking research targeting both LLMs and MLLMs, highlighting recent advancements in evaluation benchmarks, attack techniques and defense strategies. Compared to the more advanced state of unimodal jailbreaking, multimodal domain remains underexplored. We summarize the limitations and potential research directions of multimodal jailbreaking, aiming to inspire future research and further enhance the robustness and security of MLLMs. | Siyuan Wang, Zhuohan Long, Zhihao Fan, Zhongyu Wei |  |

Our preliminary analysis shows that while LLMs excel in single-step rule application, their performance drops significantly in multi-step scenarios due to the challenge in rule grounding. It requires anchoring the applicable rule and supporting facts at each step, amidst multiple input rules, facts, and inferred facts. To address this, we propose augmenting LLMs with external working memory and introduce a neurosymbolic framework for rule application. The memory stores facts and rules in both natural language and symbolic forms, enabling precise tracking. Utilizing this memory, our framework iteratively performs symbolic rule grounding and LLM-based rule implementation. The former matches predicates and variables of symbolic rules and facts to ground applicable rules... | Siyuan Wang, Zhongyu Wei, Yejin Choi, Xiang Ren |  |

We propose LLoCO, a novel approach to address this problem by learning contexts offline through context compression and in-domain parameter-efficient finetuning with LoRA. Our method enables an LLM to create a concise representation of the original context and efficiently retrieve relevant information to answer questions accurately. Our approach extends the effective context window of a 4k token LLaMA2-7B model to handle up to 128k tokens. We evaluate our approach on several long-context question-answering datasets, demonstrating that LLoCO significantly outperforms in-context learning while using 30 × fewer tokens during inference. LLoCO achieves up to 7.62 × speed-up during inference and 11.52 × higher throughput during finetuning, substantially reduces the cost of... | Sijun Tan, Xiuyu Li, Shishir G.

This paper delves into existing order-based methods, unifying them into one framework and examining their inefficiencies in utilizing reward values. Building upon these findings, we propose a new Value-based Calibration (VCB) method to better align LLMs with human preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that VCB surpasses existing alignment methods on AI assistant and summarization datasets, providing impressive generalizability, robustness, and diversity in different settings. | Xin Mao, FengLin Li, Huimin Xu, Wei Zhang, Wang Chen, Anh Tuan Luu |  |

Recently, studies have proposed a Knowledge Distillation (KD) approach, reasoning distillation, which transfers such reasoning ability of LLMs through fine-tuning language models of multi-step rationales generated by LLM teachers. However, they have inadequately considered two challenges regarding insufficient distillation sets from the LLM teacher model, in terms of 1) data quality and 2) soft label provision. In this paper, we propose Mentor-KD, which effectively distills the multi-step reasoning capability of LLMs to smaller LMs while addressing the aforementioned challenges. Specifically, we exploit a mentor, intermediate-sized task-specific fine-tuned model, to augment additional CoT annotations and provide soft labels for the student model during reasoning distillation. We conduct extensive experiments and confirm Mentor-KD’s... | Hojae Lee, Junho Kim, SangKeun Lee |  |

This paper investigates the capability of LLMs in storytelling, focusing on narrative development and plot progression. We introduce a novel computational framework to analyze narratives through three discourse-level aspects: i) story arcs, ii) turning points, and iii) affective dimensions, including arousal and valence. By leveraging expert and automatic annotations, we uncover significant discrepancies between the LLM- and human- written stories. While human-written stories are suspenseful, arousing, and diverse in narrative structures, LLM stories are homogeneously positive and lack tension. Next, we measure narrative reasoning skills as a precursor to generative capacities, concluding that most LLMs fall short of human abilities in discourse understanding. Finally, we show that explicit integration of aforementioned... | Yufei Tian, Tenghao Huang, Miri Liu, Derek Jiang, Alexander Spangher, Muhao Chen, Jonathan May, Nanyun Peng |  |

To address this issue, we propose Multi-Passage to Dialogue (MP2D), a data generation framework that automatically creates conversational question-answering datasets with natural topic transitions. By leveraging the relationships between entities in a knowledge graph, MP2D maps the flow of topics within a dialogue, effectively mirroring the dynamics of human conversation. It retrieves relevant passages corresponding to the topics and transforms them into dialogues through the passage-to-dialogue method. Through quantitative and qualitative experiments, we demonstrate MP2D’s efficacy in generating dialogue with natural topic shifts. Furthermore, this study introduces a novel benchmark for topic shift dialogues, TS-WikiDialog. Utilizing the dataset, we demonstrate that even Large... | Yerin Hwang, Yongil Kim, Yunah Jang, Jeesoo Bang, Hyunkyung Bae, Kyomin Jung |  |

To fill this gap, we use LLMs and employ advanced graph prompting and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to predict disease comorbidity within disease networks. Specifically, we introduce a disease Comorbidity prediction model using LLM, named ComLLM, which leverages domain knowledge to enhance the prediction performance. Based on the comprehensive experimental results, ComLLM consistently outperforms conventional models, such as Graph Neural Networks, achieving average area under the curve (AUC) improvements of 10.70% and 6.07% over the best baseline models in two distinct disease networks. ComLLM is evaluated across multiple settings for disease progression prediction, employing various prompting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot, Chain-of-Thought, graph prompting and RAG. Our results show that graph prompting... | Haohui Lu, Usman Naseem |  |

While many RAG approaches have been proposed to enhance large language models through query-dependent retrievals, these approaches still suffer from their complex implementation and prolonged response times. Typically, a RAG workflow involves multiple processing steps, each of which can be executed in various ways. Here, we investigate existing RAG approaches and their potential combinations to identify optimal RAG practices. Through extensive experiments, we suggest several strategies for deploying RAG that balance both performance and efficiency. Moreover, we demonstrate that multimodal retrieval techniques can significantly enhance question-answering capabilities about visual inputs and accelerate the generation of multimodal content using a “retrieval as generation”... | Xiaohua Wang, Zhenghua Wang, Xuan Gao, Feiran Zhang, Yixin Wu, Zhibo Xu, Tianyuan Shi, Zhengyuan Wang, Shizheng Li, Qi Qian, Ruicheng Yin, Changze Lv, Xiaoqing Zheng, Xuanjing Huang |  |

People vary in the weight they place on these dimensions when making moral decisions, in part due to their cultural upbringing and political ideology. As large language models (LLMs) are trained on datasets collected from the internet, they may reflect the biases that are present in such corpora. This paper uses MFT as a lens to analyze whether popular LLMs have acquired a bias towards a particular set of moral values. We analyze known LLMs and find they exhibit particular moral foundations, and show how these relate to human moral foundations and political affiliations. We also measure the consistency of these biases, or whether they vary strongly depending on the context of how the model is prompted. Finally, we show that we can adversarially select prompts that encourage... | Marwa Abdulhai, Gregory SerapioGarcía, Clément Crepy, Daria Valter, John Canny, Natasha Jaques |  |

However, there is limited consensus on what exactly qualifies as a ‘low-resource language.’ To understand how NLP papers define and study ‘low resource’ languages, we qualitatively analyzed 150 papers from the ACL Anthology and popular speech-processing conferences that mention the keyword ‘low-resource.’ Based on our analysis, we show how several interacting axes contribute to ‘low-resourcedness’ of a language and why that makes it difficult to track progress for each individual language. We hope our work (1) elicits explicit definitions of the terminology when it is used in papers and (2) provides grounding for the different axes to consider when connoting a language as low-resource. | Hellina Hailu Nigatu, Atnafu Lambebo Tonja, Benjamin Rosman, Thamar Solorio, Monojit Choudhury |  |

Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in various generative tasks; however, their adaptation to domain-specific intricacies remains challenging, especially within mental health contexts. Unlike standard LLMs, mental health experts first plan to apply domain knowledge in writing summaries. Our work enhances LLMs’ ability by introducing a novel planning engine to orchestrate structuring knowledge alignment. To achieve high-order planning, we divide knowledge encapsulation into two major phases: (i) holding dialogue structure and (ii) incorporating domain-specific knowledge. We employ a planning engine on Llama-2, resulting in a novel framework, PIECE. Our proposed system employs knowledge filtering-cum-scaffolding to encapsulate domain knowledge. Additionally, PIECE leverages sheaf convolution learning to enhance its... | Aseem Srivastava, Smriti Joshi, Tanmoy Chakraborty, Md. Shad Akhtar |  |

However, attribution for long documents remains largely unexplored. Post-hoc attribution systems are designed to map answer text back to the source document, yet the granularity of this mapping has not been addressed. Furthermore, a critical question arises: What exactly should be attributed? This involves identifying the specific information units within an answer that require grounding. In this paper, we propose and investigate a novel approach to the factual decomposition of generated answers for attribution, employing template-based in-context learning. To accomplish this, we utilize the question and integrate negative sampling during few-shot in-context learning for decomposition. This approach enhances the semantic understanding of both abstractive and extractive answers. We examine the impact of answer decomposition by providing a thorough examination of... | Pritika Ramu, Koustava Goswami, Apoorv Saxena, Balaji Vasan Srinivasan |  |

This generative approach to image caption enrichment further makes textual captions more descriptive, improving alignment with the visual context. However, while many studies focus on the benefits of generative caption enrichment (GCE), are there any negative side effects? We compare standard-format captions and recent GCE processes from the perspectives of gender bias and hallucination, showing that enriched captions suffer from increased gender bias and hallucination. Furthermore, models trained on these enriched captions amplify gender bias by an average of 30.9% and increase hallucination by 59.5%. This study serves as a caution against the trend of making captions more descriptive. | Yusuke Hirota, Ryo Hachiuma, ChaoHan Huck Yang, Yuta Nakashima |  |

Current compression techniques, such as parameter pruning, often fail to effectively utilize the knowledge from pruned parameters. To address these challenges, we propose Manifold-Based Knowledge Alignment and Layer Merging Compression (MKA), a novel approach that uses manifold learning and the Information Bottleneck (IB) measure to merge similar layers, reducing model size while preserving essential performance. We evaluate MKA on multiple benchmark datasets and various LLMs. Our findings show that MKA not only preserves model performance but also achieves substantial compression ratios, outperforming traditional pruning methods. Moreover, when coupled with quantization, MKA delivers even greater compression. Specifically, on the MMLU dataset using the Llama3-8B model, MKA achieves a compression ratio of 43.75% with a minimal performance decrease... | Deyuan Liu, Zhanyue Qin, Hairu Wang, Zhao Yang, Zecheng Wang, Fangying Rong, Qingbin Liu, Yanchao Hao, Bo Li, Xi Chen, Cunhang Fan, Zhao Lv, Dianhui Chu, Zhiying Tu, Dianbo Sui |  |

At the same time, extracting semantic information from generated text is a useful tool for applications such as automated fact checking or retrieval augmented generation. Currently, this requires either separate models during inference, which increases computational cost, or destructive fine-tuning of the language model. Instead, we propose an approach called EMBER which enables streaming named entity recognition in decoder-only language models without fine-tuning them and while incurring minimal additional computational cost at inference time. Specifically, our experiments show that EMBER maintains high token generation rates, with only a negligible decrease in speed of around 1% compared to a 43.64% slowdown measured for a baseline. We make our code and data available online, including a toolkit for training, testing, and deploying... | Nicholas Popovic, Michael Färber |  |

However, existing data mining approaches generally either completely ignore or simply treat emojis as ordinary Unicode characters, which may limit the model’s ability to grasp the rich semantic information in emojis and the interaction between emojis and texts. Thus, it is necessary to release the emoji’s power in social media data mining. To this end, we first construct a heterogeneous graph consisting of three types of nodes, i.e. post, word and emoji nodes to improve the representation of different elements in posts. The edges are also well-defined to model how these three elements interact with each other. To facilitate the sharing of information among post, word and emoji nodes, we propose a graph pre-train framework for text and emoji co-modeling, which contains two graph pre-training tasks: node-level graph contrastive learning and edge-level link reconstruction... | Zhou Zhang, Dongzeng Tan, Jiaan Wang, Yilong Chen, Jiarong Xu |  |

Existing contamination detection methods are typically based on the text overlap between training and evaluation data, which can be too superficial to reflect deeper forms of contamination. In this paper, we first present a cross-lingual form of contamination that inflates LLMs’ performance while evading current detection methods, deliberately injected by overfitting LLMs on the translated versions of benchmark test sets. Then, we propose generalization-based approaches to unmask such deeply concealed contamination. Specifically, we examine the LLM’s performance change after modifying the original benchmark by replacing the false answer choices with correct ones from other questions. Contaminated models can hardly generalize to such easier situations, where the false choices can be not even wrong, as all choices are correct... | Feng Yao, Yufan Zhuang, Zihao Sun, Sunan Xu, Animesh Kumar, Jingbo Shang |  |

While improving performance numbers remains an important goal in the short term, such a focus is not necessarily beneficial for the long-term development of the field. We reflect on the state of the art in AES research, discussing issues that we believe can encourage researchers to think bigger than improving performance numbers with the ultimate goal of triggering discussion among AES researchers on how we should move forward. | Shengjie Li, Vincent Ng |  |

Along this direction, one representative strategy is self-reflection, which asks an LLM to refine the solution with the feedback generated by itself iteratively. However, our study shows that such reflection-style methods suffer from the Degeneration-of-Thought (DoT) problem: once the LLM has established confidence in its solutions, it is unable to generate novel thoughts later through reflection even if its initial stance is incorrect. To address the DoT problem, we propose a Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) framework, in which multiple agents express their arguments in the state of “tit for tat” and a judge manages the debate process to obtain a final solution. Clearly, our MAD framework encourages divergent thinking in LLMs which... | Tian Liang, Zhiwei He, Wenxiang Jiao, Xing Wang, Yan Wang, Rui Wang, Yujiu Yang, Shuming Shi, Zhaopeng Tu |  |

While existing research seeks to enhance RAG performance by retrieving higher-quality documents or designing RAG-specific LLMs, the internal mechanisms within LLMs that contribute to RAG’s effectiveness remain underexplored. In this paper, we aim to investigate these internal mechanisms within the popular Mixture-of-Expert (MoE)-based LLMs and demonstrate how to improve RAG by examining expert activations in these LLMs. Our controlled experiments reveal that several core groups of experts are primarily responsible for RAG-related behaviors. The activation of these core experts can signify the model’s inclination towards external/internal knowledge and adjust its behavior. For instance, we identify core experts that can (1) indicate the sufficiency of the model’s internal knowledge, (2) assess the quality of retrieved documents, and (3) enhance the... | Xin Zhou, Ping Nie, Yiwen Guo, Haojie Wei, Zhanqiu Zhang, Pasquale Minervini, Ruotian Ma, Tao Gui, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang |  |

However, since these approaches focused on the presence of symptoms, the context of symptoms can be often ignored, leading to missing important contextual information related to detecting mental disorders. Furthermore, the result of disorder detection can be vulnerable to errors that may occur in identifying symptoms. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework that detects mental disorders by leveraging symptoms and their context while mitigating potential errors in symptom identification. In this way, we propose to use large language models to effectively extract contextual information and introduce an uncertainty-aware decision fusion network that combines predictions of multiple models based on quantified uncertainty values. To evaluate the proposed method, we constructed a new Korean mental... | Migyeong Kang, Goun Choi, Hyolim Jeon, Ji Hyun An, Daejin Choi, Jinyoung Han |  |

Although semantic knowledge from LLMs can help enrich the content information of items, to date it is still hard for them to achieve comparable performance to traditional deep learning recommendation models, partly due to a lack of ability to leverage collaborative filtering. In this paper, we propose a novel training-free prompting framework, PepRec, which aims to capture knowledge from both content-based filtering and collaborative filtering to boost recommendation performance with LLMs, while providing interpretation for the recommendation. Experiments based on two real-world datasets from different domains show that PepRec significantly outperforms various traditional deep learning recommendation... | Yakun Yu, Shiang Qi, Baochun Li, Di Niu |  |

However, how to exhibit in-context compositional generalization (ICCG) of large vision-language models (LVLMs) is non-trival. Due to the inherent asymmetry between visual and linguistic modalities, ICCG in LVLMs faces an inevitable challenge—redundant information on the visual modality. The redundant information affects in-context learning from two aspects: (1) Similarity calculation may be dominated by redundant information, resulting in sub-optimal demonstration selection. (2) Redundant information in in-context demonstrations brings misleading contextual information to in-context learning. To alleviate these problems, we propose a demonstration selection method to achieve ICCG for LVLMs, by considering two key factors of demonstrations: content... | Chuanhao Li, Chenchen Jing, Zhen Li, Mingliang Zhai, Yuwei Wu, Yunde Jia |  |

In this work, we introduce a novel plug-and-play train-free decoding algorithm named Game and Tree based Hallucination Mitigation (GTHM), designed for mitigating VH. GTHM is inspired by empirical observations that the fuzziness of multi-granularity view perception exacerbates VH. Based on this, GTHM leverages visual information to construct a coarse-to-fine visual view tree (CFTree) that organizes visual objects, attributes, and relationships in a hierarchical manner. Additionally, we innovatively model the optimal visual-token matching process on the CFTree as the cooperative game. Specifically, we define the Tree-based Shapley Value (TSV) for each visual view on the CFTree to assess its significant contribution to the overall visual understanding, thereby determining the... | Xianwei Zhuang, Zhihong Zhu, Zhanpeng Chen, Yuxin Xie, Liming Liang, Yuexian Zou |  |

Experimentation on English grade-level simplification dataset shows that LCWL outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised baselines. Fine-tuning the LCWL model on in-domain data and combining with Symmetric Cross Entropy (SCE) consistently delivers better simplifications compared to strong supervised methods. Our results highlight the effectiveness of label confidence weighting techniques for text simplification tasks with encoder-decoder architectures. | Xin Ying Qiu, Jingshen Zhang |  |

PQCs can provide a form of hybrid quantum-classical computation where the input and the output is in the form of classical data. The previous “hidden” state is the quantum state from the previous time-step, and an angle encoding is used to define a (non-linear) mapping from a classical word embedding into the quantum Hilbert space. Measurements of the quantum state provide classical statistics which are used for classification. We report results which are competitive with various RNN baselines on the Rotten Tomatoes dataset, as well as emulator results which demonstrate the feasibility of running such models on quantum hardware. | Wenduan Xu, Stephen Clark, Douglas Brown, Gabriel Matos, Konstantinos Meichanetzidis |  |

For complex reasoning tasks that require step-by-step thinking, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has given impressive results, especially when combined with self-consistency. Nonetheless, some tasks remain particularly difficult for LLMs to solve. Tree of Thoughts (ToT) and Graph of Thoughts (GoT) emerged as alternatives, dividing the complex problem into paths of subproblems. In this paper, we propose Tree of Problems (ToP), a simpler version of ToT, which we hypothesise can work better for complex tasks that can be divided into identical subtasks. Our empirical results show that our approach outperforms ToT and GoT, and in addition per forms better than CoT on complex reasoning tasks. All code for this paper will be made available. | Armel Zebaze, Benoît Sagot, Rachel Bawden |  |

Quantifying the Tangible Impact of Gender Bias in Machine Translation with a Human-centered Study](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.1002) |  | 0 | Gender bias in machine translation (MT) is recognized as an issue that can harm people and society. And yet, advancements in the field rarely involve people, the final MT users, or inform how they might be impacted by biased technologies. Current evaluations are often restricted to automatic methods, which offer an opaque estimate of what the downstream impact of gender disparities might be. We conduct an extensive human-centered study to examine if and to what extent bias in MT brings harms with tangible costs, such as quality of service gaps across women and men. To this aim, we collect behavioral data from ~90 participants, who post-edited MT outputs to ensure correct gender translation. Across multiple datasets, languages, and types of users, our study shows that feminine post-editing demands significantly more technical and temporal effort, also corresponding to higher financial costs. Existing bias measurements, however, fail to reflect the found disparities. Our findings... | Beatrice Savoldi, Sara Papi, Matteo Negri, Ana Guerberof Arenas, Luisa Bentivogli |  |

Traditional approaches often fall short in handling the complexity and the variability of lengthy documents. To address these issues, we introduce Seg2Act, an end-to-end, generation-based method for document logical structuring, revisiting logical structure extraction as an action generation task. Specifically, given the text segments of a document, Seg2Act iteratively generates the action sequence via a global context-aware generative model, and simultaneously updates its global context and current logical structure based on the generated actions. Experiments on ChCatExt and HierDoc datasets demonstrate the superior performance of Seg2Act in both supervised and transfer learning settings. | Zichao Li, Shaojie He, Meng Liao, Xuanang Chen, Yaojie Lu, Hongyu Lin, Yanxiong Lu, Xianpei Han, Le Sun |  |

An Investigation of Calibration Data for LLM Pruning](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.1004) |  | 0 | Network pruning has emerged as a potential solution to make LLMs cheaper to deploy. However, existing LLM pruning approachesuniversally rely on the C4 dataset as the calibration data for calculating pruning scores, leaving its optimality unexplored. In this study, we evaluate the choice of calibration data on LLM pruning, across a wide range of datasets that are most commonly used in LLM training and evaluation, including four pertaining datasets as well as three categories of downstream tasks encompassing nine datasets. Each downstream dataset is prompted with In-Context Learning (ICL) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT), respectively. Besides the already intriguingobservation that the choice of calibration data significantly impacts the performance of pruned LLMs, our results also uncover several subtle and often unexpected findings, summarized as follows: (1) C4 is not the optimal choice for LLM pruning, even among commonly used pre-training datasets; (2) arithmetic datasets—when used as... | Abhinav Bandari, Lu Yin, ChengYu Hsieh, Ajay Jaiswal, Tianlong Chen, Li Shen, Ranjay Krishna, Shiwei Liu |  |

Many recent watermarking techniques slightly modify the output probabilities of LMs to embed a signal in the generated output that can later be detected. Since early proposals for text watermarking, questions about their robustness to paraphrasing have been prominently discussed. Lately, some techniques are deliberately designed and claimed to be robust to paraphrasing. Particularly, a recent approach trains a model to produce a watermarking signal that is invariant to semantically-similar inputs. However, such watermarking schemes do not adequately account for the ease with which they can be reverse-engineered. We show that with limited access to model generations, we can undo the effects of watermarking and drastically improve the effectiveness of paraphrasing attacks. | Saksham Rastogi, Danish Pruthi |  |

Traditional models rely on static, predefined ontologies, limiting their ability to handle new and unforeseen user needs. This survey paper provides a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art techniques in OnExp for conversational understanding. It categorizes the existing literature into three main areas: (1) New Intent Discovery, (2) New Slot-Value Discovery, and (3) Joint OnExp. By examining the methodologies, benchmarks, and challenges associated with these areas, we highlight several emerging frontiers in OnExp to improve agent performance in real-world scenarios and discuss their corresponding challenges. This survey aspires to be a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners, promoting further exploration and innovation in this crucial domain. | Jinggui Liang, Yuxia Wu, Yuan Fang, Hao Fei, Lizi Liao |  |

While unsupervised pre-training has been shown to yield LLMs with well-calibrated conditional probabilities, recent studies have shown that after fine-tuning with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), the calibration of these models degrades significantly. In this work, we introduce Adaptive Temperature Scaling (ATS), a post-hoc calibration method that predicts a temperature scaling parameter for each token prediction. The predicted temperature values adapt based on token-level features and are fit over a standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset. The adaptive nature of ATS addresses the varying degrees of calibration shift that can occur after RLHF fine-tuning. ATS improves calibration by over 10-50% across three downstream natural... | Johnathan Xie, Annie S. Chen, Yoonho Lee, Eric Mitchell, Chelsea Finn |  |

Our research aims to verify which programming languages and features during pre-training affect logical inference performance. Specifically, we pre-trained decoder-based language models from scratch using datasets from ten programming languages (e.g., Python, C, Java) and three natural language datasets (Wikipedia, Fineweb, C4) under identical conditions. Thereafter, we evaluated the trained models in a few-shot in-context learning setting on logical reasoning tasks: FLD and bAbi, which do not require commonsense or world knowledge. The results demonstrate that nearly all models trained with programming languages consistently outperform those trained with natural... | Fumiya Uchiyama, Takeshi Kojima, Andrew Gambardella, Qi Cao, Yusuke Iwasawa, Yutaka Matsuo |  |

A study on word informativeness in language use and lexical systems](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.1009) |  | 0 | Human lexicons contain many different words that speakers can use to refer to the same object, e.g., \*purple\* or \*magenta\* for the same shade of color. On the one hand, studies on language use have explored how speakers adapt their referring expressions to successfully communicate in context, without focusing on properties of the lexical system. On the other hand, studies in language evolution have discussed how competing pressures for informativeness and simplicity shape lexical systems, without tackling in-context communication. We aim at bridging the gap between these traditions, and explore why a soft mapping between referents and words is a good solution for communication, by taking into account both in-context communication and the structure of the lexicon. We propose a simple measure of informativeness for words and lexical systems, grounded in a visual space, and analyze color naming data for English and Mandarin Chinese. We conclude that optimal lexical systems are those... | Eleonora Gualdoni, Gemma Boleda |  |

During this process, white-box KD methods usually minimize the distance between the output distributions of the two models so that more knowledge can be transferred. However, in the current white-box KD framework, the output distributions are from the respective output spaces of the two models, using their own prediction heads. We argue that the space discrepancy will lead to low similarity between the teacher model and the student model on both representation and distribution levels. Furthermore, this discrepancy also hinders the KD process between models with different vocabularies, which is common for current LLMs. To address these issues, we propose a dual-space knowledge distillation (DSKD) framework that unifies the output spaces of the two models for KD. On the basis of DSKD, we further develop a cross-model attention... | Songming Zhang, Xue Zhang, Zengkui Sun, Yufeng Chen, Jinan Xu |  |

Such label noise poses challenges for supervised learning and may significantly deteriorate model quality. To address this, prior work proposed various noise-robust learning approaches capable of learning from data with partially incorrect labels. These approaches are typically evaluated using simulated noise where the labels in a clean dataset are automatically corrupted. However, as we show in this paper, this leads to unrealistic noise that is far easier to handle than real noise caused by human error or semi-automatic annotation. To enable the study of the impact of various types of real noise, we introduce NoiseBench, an NER benchmark consisting of clean training data corrupted with 6 types of real noise, including expert errors, crowdsourcing errors, automatic annotation errors and LLM errors. We present an analysis that... | Elena Merdjanovska, Ansar Aynetdinov, Alan Akbik |  |

Recent studies have explored hallucinations through the lens of internal representations, proposing mechanisms to decipher LLMs’ adherence to facts. However, these approaches often fail to generalize to out-of-distribution data, leading to concerns about whether internal representation patterns reflect fundamental factual awareness, or only overfit spurious correlations on the specific datasets. In this work, we investigate whether a universal truthfulness hyperplane that distinguishes the model’s factually correct and incorrect outputs exists within the model. To this end, we scale up the number of training datasets and conduct an extensive evaluation – we train the truthfulness hyperplane on a diverse collection of over 40 datasets and examine its cross-task, cross-domain, and in-domain generalization. Our results indicate that increasing... | Junteng Liu, Shiqi Chen, Yu Cheng, Junxian He |  |

Recent advancements in dense retrieval have showcased remarkable efficacy compared to traditional sparse retrieval methods. To further enhance retrieval performance, knowledge distillation techniques, often leveraging robust cross-encoder rerankers, have been extensively explored. However, existing approaches primarily distill knowledge from pointwise rerankers, which assign absolute relevance scores to documents, thus facing challenges related to inconsistent comparisons. This paper introduces Pairwise Relevance Distillation (PairDistill) to leverage pairwise reranking, offering fine-grained distinctions between similarly relevant documents to enrich the training of dense retrieval models. Our experiments demonstrate that PairDistill outperforms existing methods, achieving new state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks. This highlights... | ChaoWei Huang, YunNung Chen |  |

Many sources of this data—like code, forum posts, personal websites, and books—are easily attributed to one or a few “users”. In this paper, we ask if it is possible to infer if any of a _user’s_ data was used to train an LLM. Not only would this constitute a breach of privacy, but it would also enable users to detect when their data was used for training. We develop the first effective attacks for _user inference_—at times, with near-perfect success—against LLMs. Our attacks are easy to employ, requiring only black-box access to an LLM and a few samples from the user, which _need not be the ones that were trained on_. We find, both theoretically and empirically, that certain properties make users more susceptible to user inference: being an outlier, having highly correlated examples, and contributing a larger fraction of data. Based on these findings, we... | Nikhil Kandpal, Krishna Pillutla, Alina Oprea, Peter Kairouz, Christopher A. ChoquetteChoo, Zheng Xu |  |

As LMs grow in size, fine-tuning the full parameters of LMs requires a prohibitively large amount of GPU memory. Existing approaches utilize zeroth-order optimizer to conserve GPU memory, which potentially compromises the performance of LMs as non-zero order optimizers tend to converge more readily on most downstream tasks. We propose a novel, memory-efficient, optimizer-independent, end-to-end hierarchical fine-tuning strategy, HiFT, which only updates a subset of parameters at each training step. HiFT significantly reduces the amount of gradients and optimizer state parameters residing in GPU memory at the same time, thereby reducing GPU memory usage. Our results demonstrate that: (1) HiFT achieves comparable performance with parameter-efficient fine-tuning and standard FPFT. (2) Results on six models show that HiFT reduces the number... | Yongkang Liu, Yiqun Zhang, Qian Li, Tong Liu, Shi Feng, Daling Wang, Yifei Zhang, Hinrich Schütze |  |

However, there is no clear conclusion as to which part of the model these hallucinations originate from. In this paper, we present an in-depth investigation into the object hallucination problem specifically within the CLIP model, which serves as the backbone for many state-of-the-art vision-language systems. We unveil that even in isolation, the CLIP model is prone to object hallucinations, suggesting that the hallucination problem is not solely due to the interaction between vision and language modalities. To address this, we propose a counterfactual data augmentation method by creating negative samples with a variety of hallucination issues. We demonstrate that our method can effectively mitigate object hallucinations for CLIP model, and we show the the enhanced model can be employed as a visual encoder, effectively... | Yufang Liu, Tao Ji, Changzhi Sun, Yuanbin Wu, Aimin Zhou |  |

Current fine-tuning methods to adapt LLMs for simultaneous translation focus on prompting optimization strategies using either data augmentation or prompt structure modifications. However, these methods suffer from several issues, such as unnecessarily expanded training sets, computational inefficiency from dumping the key and value cache, increased prompt sizes, or restriction to a single decision policy. To eliminate these issues, in this work, we propose SimulMask, a new paradigm for fine-tuning LLMs for simultaneous translation. It utilizes a novel attention mask approach that models simultaneous translation during fine-tuning by masking attention for a desired decision policy. Applying the proposed SimulMask on a Falcon LLM for the IWSLT 2017 dataset, we have observed a significant translation quality improvement... | Matthew Raffel, Victor Agostinelli, Lizhong Chen |  |

Given an instruction, tool-augmented LLMs can interact with various external tools in multiple rounds and provide a final answer. However, previous LLMs were trained on overly detailed instructions, which included API names or parameters, while real users would not explicitly mention these API details. This leads to a gap between trained LLMs and real-world scenarios. In addition, most works ignore whether the interaction process follows the instruction. To address these issues, we constructed a training dataset called MGToolBench, which contains statement and category-level instructions to better reflect real-world scenarios. In addition, we propose ToolPlanner, a two-stage reinforcement learning framework that utilizes path planning and two feedback mechanisms to enhance the LLM’s task completion and instruction-following capabilities. Experimental results show that ToolPlanner significantly improves the Match Rate,... | Qinzhuo Wu, Wei Liu, Jian Luan, Bin Wang |  |

Being trained on online data, Large Language Models (LLMs) display undesirable behaviors, such as generating harmful text or failing to recognize it. Despite these shortcomings, the models are becoming a part of our everyday lives by being used as tools for information search, content creation, writing assistance, and many more. Furthermore, the research explores using LLMs in applications with immense social risk, such as late-life companions and online content moderators. Despite the potential harms from LLMs in such applications, whether LLMs can reliably identify offensive speech and how they behave when they fail are open questions. This work addresses these questions by probing sixteen widely used LLMs and showing that most fail to identify (non-)offensive online language. Our experiments reveal undesirable behavior patterns in the context of offensive speech detection, such as erroneous response generation, over-reliance... | Esra Dönmez, Thang Vu, Agnieszka Falenska |  |

While we are usually concerned with measuring these values for words, most LMs operate over subwords. Despite seemingly straightforward, accurately computing probabilities over one unit given probabilities over the other requires care. Indeed, we show here that many recent linguistic studies have been incorrectly computing these values. This paper derives the correct methods for computing word probabilities, highlighting issues when relying on language models that use beginning-of-word (bow)-marking tokenisers, e.g., the GPT family. Empirically, we show that correcting the widespread bug in probability computations affects measured outcomes in sentence comprehension and lexical optimisation analyses. | Tiago Pimentel, Clara Meister |  |

We capitalize on semantic frame annotation for characterizing this complexity, and study seven complexity factors that may account for model’s difficulty. We first deploy this methodology on a carefully annotated French reading comprehension benchmark showing that two of those complexity factors are indeed good predictors of models’ failure, while others are less so. We further deploy our methodology on a well studied English benchmark by using chatGPT as a proxy for semantic annotation.Our study reveals that fine-grained linguistically-motivated automatic evaluation of a reading comprehension task is not only possible, but helps understand models’ abilities to handle specific linguistic characteristics of input examples. It also shows that current... | Elie Antoine, Frédéric Béchet, Géraldine Damnati, Philippe Langlais |  |

Lately, due to the risk of providing users with unsafe information, the adoption of those systems in safety-critical domains has raised significant concerns. To respond to this situation, input-output filters, commonly called guardrail models, have been proposed to complement other measures, such as model alignment. Unfortunately, the lack of a standard benchmark for guardrail models poses significant evaluation issues and makes it hard to compare results across scientific publications. To fill this gap, we introduce GuardBench, a large-scale benchmark for guardrail models comprising 40 safety evaluation datasets. To facilitate the adoption of GuardBench, we release a Python library providing an automated evaluation pipeline built on top of it. With our benchmark, we also share the first large-scale prompt moderation datasets in German, French, Italian, and Spanish. To assess the... | Elias Bassani, Ignacio Sanchez |  |

However, these methods are typically evaluated on conventional Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) with complete KGs, where all factual triples required for each question are entirely covered by the given KG. In such cases, LLMs primarily act as an agent to find answer entities within the KG, rather than effectively integrating the internal knowledge of LLMs and external knowledge sources such as KGs. In fact, KGs are often incomplete to cover all the knowledge required to answer questions. To simulate these real-world scenarios and evaluate the ability of LLMs to integrate internal and external knowledge, we propose leveraging LLMs for QA under Incomplete Knowledge Graph (IKGQA), where the provided KG lacks some of the factual triples for each question, and construct corresponding datasets.

Recent work suggests that the prediction of the next word is a key mechanism that contributes to this alignment. What is not yet understood is whether prediction of the next word is necessary for this observed alignment or simply sufficient, and whether there are other shared mechanisms or information that are similarly important. In this work, we take a step towards understanding the reasons for brain alignment via two simple perturbations in popular pretrained language models. These perturbations help us design contrasts that can control for different types of information. By contrasting the brain alignment of these differently perturbed models, we show that improvements in alignment with brain recordings are due to more than improvements in next-word prediction and word-level information. | Gabriele Merlin, Mariya Toneva |  |

However, traditional clustering methods often struggle with domain-specific fine-tuning and the presence of outliers. To address these challenges, we introduce LLMEdgeRefine, an iterative clustering method enhanced by large language models (LLMs), focusing on edge points refinement. LLMEdgeRefine enhances current clustering methods by creating super-points to mitigate outliers and iteratively refining clusters using LLMs for improved semantic coherence. Our method demonstrates superior performance across multiple datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques, and offering robustness, adaptability, and cost-efficiency for diverse text clustering applications. | Zijin Feng, Luyang Lin, Lingzhi Wang, Hong Cheng, KamFai Wong |  |

However, the need to explain the rationale behind decisions is a main issues also for human-based deliberation as it is important to justify why a certain decision has been taken. Resident medical doctors for instance are required not only to provide a (possibly correct) diagnosis, but also to explain how they reached a certain conclusion. Developing new tools to aid residents to train their explanation skills is therefore a central objective of AI in education. In this paper, we follow this direction, and we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first multilingual dataset for Medical Question Answering where correct and incorrect diagnoses for a clinical case are enriched with a natural language explanation written by doctors. These explanations have been manually annotated with argument components (i.e., premise, claim)... | Ekaterina Sviridova, Anar Yeginbergen, Ainara Estarrona, Elena Cabrio, Serena Villata, Rodrigo Agerri |  |

Existing approaches to reduce the KV cache size involve either fine-tuning the model to learn a compression strategy or leveraging attention scores to reduce the sequence length. We analyse the attention distributions in decoder-only Transformers-based models and observe that attention allocation patterns stay consistent across most layers. Surprisingly, we find a clear correlation between the L2 norm and the attention scores over cached KV pairs, where a low L2 norm of a key embedding usually leads to a high attention score during decoding. This finding indicates that the influence of a KV pair is potentially determined by the key embedding itself before being queried. Based on this observation, we compress the KV cache based on the L2 norm of key embeddings. Our experimental results show that this simple strategy... | Alessio Devoto, Yu Zhao, Simone Scardapane, Pasquale Minervini |  |

Due to their comparison of seemingly unrelated concepts in metaphors, existing LLMs have a tendency of over-literalization, which illustrates figurative language solely based on literal objects, ignoring the underlying groundings and associations across disparate metaphorical domains. Furthermore, prior approaches have ignored the binding process between visual objects and metaphorical attributes, which further intensifies the infidelity of visual metaphors. To address the issues above, we propose GOME (Grounding-based Metaphor Binding), which illustrates linguistic metaphors from the grounding perspective elaborated through LLMs. GOME consists of two steps for metaphor illustration, including grounding-based elaboration and scenario visualization. In the elaboration step, metaphorical knowledge is integrated... | Linhao Zhang, Jintao Liu, Li Jin, Hao Wang, Kaiwen Wei, Guangluan Xu |  |

Recent studies that critically examine this issue are often focused on Western contexts, and solely document differences across age, gender, or racial groups. Consequently, NLP research on subjectivity have failed to consider that individuals within demographic groups may hold diverse values, which influence their perceptions beyond group norms. To effectively incorporate these considerations into NLP pipelines, we need datasets with extensive parallel annotations from a variety of social and cultural groups.In this paper we introduce the D3CODE dataset: a large-scale cross-cultural dataset of parallel annotations for offensive language in over 4.5K English sentences annotated by a pool of more than 4k annotators, balanced across gender and age, from across 21 countries, representing eight geo-cultural regions. The dataset captures annotators’ moral... | Aida Mostafazadeh Davani, Mark Diaz, Dylan K. Baker, Vinodkumar Prabhakaran |  |

Given the sensitivity of zero-shot performance to the choice of hand-crafted text prompts, many prompt learning techniques have been developed for VLMs. We explore the efficacy of these approaches in ALMs and propose a novel method, Prompt Learning in Audio Language Models (PALM), which optimizes the feature space of the text encoder branch. Unlike existing methods that work in the input space, our approach results in greater training efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on 11 audio recognition datasets, encompassing a variety of speech-processing tasks, and compare the results with three baselines in a few-shot learning setup. Our method is either on par with or outperforms other approaches while being... | Asif Hanif, Maha Tufail Agro, Mohammad Areeb Qazi, Hanan Aldarmaki |  |

However, for subjective NLP tasks, incorporating a wide range of perspectives in the annotation process is crucial to capture the variability in human judgments. We introduce Annotator-Centric Active Learning (ACAL), which incorporates an annotator selection strategy following data sampling. Our objective is two-fold: (1) to efficiently approximate the full diversity of human judgments, and (2) to assess model performance using annotator-centric metrics, which value minority and majority perspectives equally. We experiment with multiple annotator selection strategies across seven subjective NLP tasks, employing both traditional and novel, human-centered evaluation metrics. Our findings indicate that ACAL improves data efficiency and excels in annotator-centric performance evaluations. However, its success depends on the availability of a sufficiently... | Michiel van der Meer, Neele Falk, Pradeep K. Murukannaiah, Enrico Liscio |  |

However, the application of modern language models to psycholinguistic studies is complicated by the practice of using tokenization as an intermediate step in training a model. Doing so results in a language model over \*token\* strings rather than one over character strings. Vexingly, regions of interest are generally misaligned with these token strings. The paper argues that token-level language models should be (approximately) marginalized into character-level language models before they are used in psycholinguistic studies to compute the surprisal of a region of interest; then, the marginalized character-level language model can be used to compute the... | Mario Giulianelli, Luca Malagutti, Juan Luis Gastaldi, Brian DuSell, Tim Vieira, Ryan Cotterell |  |

Previous research works have identified that detectors exhibit complementary performance — different detectors excel at detecting different types of hallucinations. In this paper, we propose to address the limitations of individual detectors by combining them and introducing a straightforward method for aggregating multiple detectors. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of our aggregated detector, providing a promising step towards evermore reliable machine translation systems. | Anas Himmi, Guillaume Staerman, Marine Picot, Pierre Colombo, Nuno Miguel Guerreiro |  |

While most research has concentrated on English-based prompt manipulation, our investigation broadens the scope to investigate the Arabic language. We initially tested the AdvBench benchmark in Standardized Arabic, finding that even with prompt manipulation techniques like prefix injection, it was insufficient to provoke LLMs into generating unsafe content. However, when using Arabic transliteration and chatspeak (or arabizi), we found that unsafe content could be produced on platforms like OpenAI GPT-4 and Anthropic Claude 3 Sonnet. Our findings suggest that using Arabic and its various forms could expose information that might remain hidden, potentially increasing the risk of jailbreak attacks. We hypothesize that this exposure could be due to the model’s learned connection to specific words, highlighting the... | Mansour Al Ghanim, Saleh Almohaimeed, Mengxin Zheng, Yan Solihin, Qian Lou |  |

Uncovering Stereotypes in Large Language Models](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.1035) |  | 0 | Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to propagate and amplify harmful stereotypes, particularly those that disproportionately affect marginalised communities. To understand the effect of these stereotypes more comprehensively, we introduce GlobalBias, a dataset of 876k sentences incorporating 40 distinct gender-by-ethnicity groups alongside descriptors typically used in bias literature, which enables us to study a broad set of stereotypes from around the world. We use GlobalBias to directly probe a suite of LMs via perplexity, which we use as a proxy to determine how certain stereotypes are represented in the model’s internal representations. Following this, we generate character profiles based on given names and evaluate the prevalence of stereotypes in model outputs. We find that the demographic groups associated with various stereotypes remain consistent across model likelihoods and model outputs. Furthermore, larger models consistently display higher levels of... | Zara Siddique, Liam D. Turner, Luis Espinosa Anke |  |

For task-specific improvements, strategically selecting and training on related tasks that provide meaningful supervision is crucial, as this approach enhances efficiency and prevents performance degradation from learning irrelevant tasks. In this light, we introduce a simple yet effective task selection method that leverages instruction information alone to identify relevant tasks, optimizing instruction tuning for specific tasks. Our method is significantly more efficient than traditional approaches, which require complex measurements of pairwise transferability between tasks or the creation of data samples for the target task. Additionally, by aligning the model with the unique instructional template style of the meta-dataset, we enhance its ability to granularly discern relevant tasks, leading to improved overall performance.... | Changho Lee, Janghoon Han, Seonghyeon Ye, Stanley Jungkyu Choi, Honglak Lee, Kyunghoon Bae |  |

In fact, selectively and repeatedly grasping the hierarchical structure of large-scale text is pivotal for deciphering its essence. To this end, we propose a novel framework for hierarchical text rating utilizing LLMs, which incorporates Recurrent Alignment with Hard Attention (RAHA). Particularly, hard attention mechanism prompts a frozen LLM to selectively focus on pertinent leaf texts associated with the root text and generate symbolic representations of their relationships. Inspired by the gradual stabilization of the Markov Chain, recurrent alignment strategy involves feeding predicted ratings iteratively back into the prompts of another trainable LLM, aligning it to progressively approximate the desired target. Experimental results demonstrate that RAHA outperforms... | Chenxi Lin, Jiayu Ren, Guoxiu He, Zhuoren Jiang, Haiyan Yu, Xiaomin Zhu |  |

Activation sparsification can mitigate these resource challenges by reducing the number of activated neurons during inference. Existing methods typically employ thresholding-based sparsification based on the statistics of activation tensors. However, they do not model the impact of activation sparsification on performance, resulting in suboptimal performance degradation. To address the limitations, this paper reformulates the activation sparsification problem to explicitly capture the relationship between activation sparsity and model performance. Then, this paper proposes CHESS, a general activation sparsification approach via CHannel-wise thrEsholding and Selective Sparsification. First, channel-wise thresholding assigns a unique threshold to each activation channel in the feed-forward network (FFN) layers. Then, selective... | Junhui He, Shangyu Wu, Weidong Wen, Chun Jason Xue, Qingan Li |  |

However, their practical usage for structured domain-specific languages (DSLs) such as YAML, JSON is limited due to domain-specific schema, grammar, and customizations generally unseen by LLMs during pre-training. Efforts have been made to mitigate this challenge via in-context learning through relevant examples or by fine-tuning. However, it suffers from problems, such as limited DSL samples and prompt sensitivity but enterprises maintain good documentation of the DSLs. Therefore, we propose DocCGen, a framework that can leverage such rich knowledge by breaking the NL-to-Code generation task for structured code languages into a two-step process. First, it detects the correct libraries using the library documentation that best matches the NL query. Then, it utilizes schema... | Sameer Pimparkhede, Mehant Kammakomati, Srikanth Tamilselvam, Prince Kumar, Ashok Pon Kumar, Pushpak Bhattacharyya |  |

Despite their popularity and image-grounded nature, previous studies have found that people interpret emojis inconsistently when presented in context and in isolation. In this work, we explore whether emoji semantics differ across languages and how semantics interacts with sentiment in emoji use across languages. To do so, we developed a corpus containing the literal meanings for a set of emojis, as defined by L1 speakers in English, Portuguese and Chinese. We then use these definitions to assess whether speakers of different languages agree on whether an emoji is being used literally or figuratively in the context where they are grounded in, as well as whether this literal and figurative use correlates with the sentiment of the context itself. We found that there were varying levels of disagreement on the definition for each emoji but that these stayed fairly consistent across languages.

The targets that agents refer to typically involve a single entity, which limits their ecological validity and the complexity of the emergent languages. Here, we present a simple multi-entity game in which targets include multiple entities that are spatially related. We ask whether agents dealing with multi-entity targets benefit from the use of graph representations, and explore four different graph schemes. Our game requires more sophisticated analyses to capture the extent to which the emergent languages are compositional, and crucially, what the decomposed features are. We find that emergent languages from our setup exhibit a considerable degree of compositionality, but not over all features. | Daniel Akkerman, Phong Le, Raquel G. Alhama |  |

However, we currently lack a fundamental understanding of what kinds of linguistic distances contribute to PD, and to what extent. Furthermore, studies of cross-lingual generalization are confounded by unknown quantities of CRL language traces in the training data, and by the frequent lack of availability of evaluation data in lower-resource related languages and dialects. To address these issues, we model phonological, morphological, and lexical distance as Bayesian noise processes to synthesize artificial languages that are controllably distant from the HRLN. We analyse PD as a function of underlying noise parameters, offering insights on model robustness to isolated and composed linguistic phenomena, and the impact of task and HRL... | Niyati Bafna, Kenton Murray, David Yarowsky |  |

In this work, we study the inverse problem: investigating whether model fusion can be used to reduce unwanted knowledge. We investigate the effects of model fusion in three scenarios: the learning of shortcuts, social biases, and memorization of training data in fine-tuned language models. Through experiments covering classification and generation tasks, our analysis highlights that shared knowledge among models is enhanced during model fusion, while unshared knowledge is usually forgotten. Based on this observation, we demonstrate the potential of model fusion as a debiasing tool and showcase its efficacy in addressing privacy concerns associated with language models. | Kerem Zaman, Leshem Choshen, Shashank Srivastava |  |

Previous research has addressed this challenge by proposing different frameworks that create a story plan and generate a long story based on that plan. However, these frameworks have been mainly focusing on maintaining narrative coherence in stories, often overlooking creativity in story planning and the expressiveness of the stories generated from those plans, which are desirable properties to captivate readers’ interest. In this paper, we propose Collective Critics for Creative Story Generation framework (CritiCS), which is composed of plan refining stage (CrPlan) and story generation stage (CrText), to integrate a collective revision mechanism that promotes those properties into long-form story generation process. Specifically, in each stage, a group of LLM critics and one leader collaborate to incrementally refine drafts of plan and story... | Minwook Bae, Hyounghun Kim |  |

Uniform Information Density Isn't the Whole Story: Predicting Surprisal Contours in Long-form Discourse](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.1047) |  | 0 | The Uniform Information Density (UID) hypothesis posits that speakers tend to distribute information evenly across linguistic units to achieve efficient communication. Of course, information rate in texts and discourses is not perfectly uniform. While these fluctuations can be viewed as theoretically uninteresting noise on top of a uniform target, another explanation is that UID is not the only functional pressure regulating information content in a language. Speakers may also seek to maintain interest, adhere to writing conventions, and build compelling arguments. In this paper, we propose one such functional pressure; namely that speakers modulate information rate based on location within a hierarchically-structured model of discourse. We term this the Structured Context Hypothesis and test it by predicting the surprisal contours of naturally occurring discourses extracted from large language models using predictors derived from discourse structure. We find that hierarchical... | Eleftheria Tsipidi, Franz Nowak, Ryan Cotterell, Ethan Wilcox, Mario Giulianelli, Alex Warstadt |  |

Consequently, although Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate fluent text, they often introduce inaccuracies by hallucinating content not found in the original source. While supervised fine-tuning methods that maximize likelihood contribute to this issue, they do not consistently enhance the faithfulness of the summaries. Preference-based optimization methods, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), can further refine the model to align with human preferences. However, these methods still heavily depend on costly human feedback. In this work, we introduce a novel and straightforward approach called Model-based Preference Optimization (MPO) to fine-tune LLMs for improved summarization abilities without any human feedback. By leveraging the model’s inherent summarization capabilities, we create a preference dataset... | Jaepill Choi, Kyubyung Chae, Jiwoo Song, Yohan Jo, Taesup Kim |  |

For the future advance of NER in safety-critical fields like healthcare and finance, it is essential to achieve accurate predictions with calibrated confidence when applying Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), including Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), as a real-world application. However, DNNs are prone to miscalibration, which limits their applicability. Moreover, existing methods for calibration and uncertainty estimation are computational expensive. Our investigation in NER found that data augmentation improves calibration and uncertainty in cross-genre and cross-lingual setting, especially in-domain setting. Furthermore, we showed that the calibration for NER tends to be more effective when the perplexity of the sentences generated by data augmentation is lower, and that increasing the size of the augmentation further improves... | Wataru Hashimoto, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Taro Watanabe |  |

However, achieving this at scale is hampered by the volume of available data and the lack of an annotated corpus to assist in the development of automation tools. Thus, we introduce NeuroTrialNER, a new and fully open corpus for named entity recognition (NER). It comprises 1093 clinical trial summaries sourced from ClinicalTrials.gov, annotated for neurological diseases, therapeutic interventions, and control treatments. We describe our data collection process and the corpus in detail. We demonstrate its utility for NER using large language models and achieve a close-to-human performance. By bridging the gap in data resources, we hope to foster the development of text processing tools that help researchers navigate clinical trials data more easily. | Simona Doneva, Tilia Ellendorff, Beate Sick, JeanPhilippe Goldman, Amelia Cannon, Gerold Schneider, Benjamin Ineichen |  |

Contrasting Textual and Visual Explanations in a Clinical Decision-Support Setting](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.1051) |  | 0 | The growing capabilities of AI models are leading to their wider use, including in safety-critical domains. Explainable AI (XAI) aims to make these models safer to use by making their inference process more transparent. However, current explainability methods are seldom evaluated in the way they are intended to be used: by real-world end users. To address this, we conducted a large-scale user study with 85 healthcare practitioners in the context of human-AI collaborative chest X-ray analysis. We evaluated three types of explanations: visual explanations (saliency maps), natural language explanations, and a combination of both modalities. We specifically examined how different explanation types influence users depending on whether the AI advice and explanations are factually correct. We find that text-based explanations lead to significant over-reliance, which is alleviated by combining them with saliency maps. We also observe that the quality of explanations, that is, how much... | Maxime Kayser, Bayar Menzat, Cornelius Emde, Bogdan Bercean, Alex Novak, Abdalá Morgado, Bartlomiej W.

Current methods often overlook path decoding faithfulness, leading to divergence between graph encoder outputs and model predictions. We identify confounding effects and LM-KG misalignment as key factors causing spurious explanations. To address this, we introduce the LM-KG Fidelity metric to assess KG representation reliability and propose the LM-KG Distribution-aware Alignment (LKDA) algorithm to improve explanation faithfulness. Without ground truth, we evaluate KG explanations using the proposed Fidelity-Sparsity Trade-off Curve. Experiments on CommonsenseQA and OpenBookQA show that LKDA significantly enhances explanation fidelity and model performance, highlighting the need to address distributional misalignment for reliable commonsense reasoning. | Weihe Zhai, Arkaitz Zubiaga, Bingquan Liu, Chengjie Sun, Yalong Zhao |  |

It can involve arbitrary text spans during generation. These text spans act as basic generation bricks, akin to tokens in the traditional static vocabularies. We show that, the ability to generate multi-tokens atomically improve both generation quality and efficiency (compared to the standard language model, the MAUVE metric is increased by 25%, the latency is decreased by 20 %). The dynamic vocabulary can be deployed in a plug-and-play way, thus is attractive for various downstream applications. For example, we demonstrate that dynamic vocabulary can be applied to different domains in a training-free manner. It also helps to generate reliable citations in question answering tasks (substantially enhancing citation results without compromising answer accuracy). | Yanting Liu, Tao Ji, Changzhi Sun, Yuanbin Wu, Xiaoling Wang |  |

The current approaches rely on transformer architectures which have proven to be more effective than traditional methods based on hand-crafted linguistic features. In this paper, we introduce DISARM, which advances the state of the art with a training procedure combining multi-task and adversarial learning strategies. By jointly solving the ARC and discourse marker detection tasks and aligning their embedding spaces into a unified latent space, DISARM outperforms the accuracy of existing approaches. | Michele Contalbo, Francesco Guerra, Matteo Paganelli |  |

However, they are under-explored for character-level sequence to sequence tasks. In this work, we investigate pre-training transformers for the character-level task of morphological inflection in several languages. We compare various training setups and secondary tasks where unsupervised data taken directly from the target task is used. We show that training on secondary unsupervised tasks increases inflection performance even without any external data, suggesting that models learn from additional unsupervised tasks themselves—not just from additional data. We also find that this does not hold true for specific combinations of secondary task and training setup, which has interesting implications for denoising objectives in character-level tasks. | Abhishek Purushothama, Adam Wiemerslage, Katharina von der Wense |  |

For such cases, it is common to use query augmentations followed by fine-tuning pre-trained models on the document data paired with synthetic queries. In this work, we propose a novel Universal Document Linking (UDL) algorithm, which links similar documents to enhance synthetic query generation across multiple datasets with different characteristics. UDL leverages entropy for the choice of similarity models and named entity recognition (NER) for the link decision of documents using similarity scores. Our empirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of the UDL across diverse datasets and IR models, surpassing state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot cases.

Specifically, they can be fine-tuned solely on tasks in the source language and subsequently applied to tasks in the target language. However, for low-resource languages unseen during pre-training, relying solely on zero-shot language transfer often yields sub-optimal results. One common strategy is to continue training PLMs using masked language modeling objectives on the target language. Nonetheless, this approach can be inefficient due to the need to adjust all parameters for language adaptation. In this paper, we propose a more efficient solution: soft-prompt tuning for language adaptation. Our experiments demonstrate that with carefully designed prompts, soft-prompt tuning enables mPLMs to achieve effective zero-shot cross-lingual transfer to downstream tasks in previously unseen languages. Notably, we found that prompt tuning outperforms... | PoHeng Chen, YunNung Chen |  |

Although current AEG methods can generate individual opinions, they often overlook the high-level connections between these opinions. This often leads to the generated results being mired in logical confusion, unable to proof their own arguments effectively. The generated essay may present evidence that contradicts the claims or they may fail to assemble the claims into logical flow. In this paper, we present a unified two-stage framework: Proof-Enhancement and Self-Annotation (PESA) for AEG with a focus on logical enhancement. Specifically, we first construct pseudo-labels for logical information,claims and grounds, using a large language model. We then propose a tree planning approach that introduces proof principles and ensures logical consistency.

To combat these issues we propose TV-TREES, the first multimodal entailment tree generator. TV-TREES serves as an approach to video understanding that promotes interpretable joint-modality reasoning by searching for trees of entailment relationships between simple text-video evidence and higher-level conclusions that prove question-answer pairs. We also introduce the task of multimodal entailment tree generation to evaluate reasoning quality. Our method’s performance on the challenging TVQA benchmark demonstrates interpretable, state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on full clips, illustrating that multimodal entailment tree generation can be a best-of-both-worlds alternative to black-box systems. | Kate Sanders, Nathaniel Weir, Benjamin Van Durme |  |

While in many situations, large amounts of conversational data are available for the task at hand, people lack an effective solution able to extract dialogue policies from this data. In this paper, we address this gap by first illustrating how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be instrumental in extracting dialogue policies from datasets, through the conversion of conversations into a unified intermediate representation consisting of canonical forms. We then propose a novel method for generating dialogue policies utilizing a controllable and interpretable graph-based methodology. By combining canonical forms across conversations into a flow network, we find that running graph traversal algorithms helps in extracting dialogue flows. These flows are a better representation of... | Makesh Narsimhan Sreedhar, Traian Rebedea, Christopher Parisien |  |

To address the challenges of TAL, we offer GRIZAL, a model that uses multimodal embeddings and dynamic motion cues to localize actions effectively. GRIZAL achieves sample diversity by using large-scale generative models such as GPT-4 for generating textual augmentations and DALL-E for generating image augmentations. Our model integrates vision-language embeddings with optical flow insights, optimized through a blend of supervised and self-supervised loss functions. On ActivityNet, Thumos14 and Charades-STA datasets, GRIZAL greatly outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot TAL models, demonstrating its robustness and adaptability across a wide range of video content. We will make all the models and code publicly available by open-sourcing them. | Onkar Susladkar, Gayatri Deshmukh, Vandan Gorade, Sparsh Mittal |  |

Traditional fine-tuning approaches often improve compositional reasoning at the cost of degrading multi-modal capabilities, primarily due to the use of global hard negative (HN) loss, which contrasts global representations of images and texts. This global HN loss pushes HN texts that are highly similar to the original ones, damaging the model’s multi-modal representations. To overcome this limitation, we propose Fine-grained Selective Calibrated CLIP (FSC-CLIP), which integrates local hard negative loss and selective calibrated regularization. These innovations provide fine-grained negative supervision while preserving the model’s representational integrity. Our extensive evaluations across diverse benchmarks for both compositionality and multi-modal tasks show that FSC-CLIP not only achieves... | Youngtaek Oh, JaeWon Cho, DongJin Kim, In So Kweon, Junmo Kim |  |

To bridge the gap in the literature on the often-overlooked regional diversity in this domain, we introduce FoodieQA, a manually curated, fine-grained image-text dataset capturing the intricate features of food cultures across various regions in China. We evaluate vision–language Models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) on newly collected, unseen food images and corresponding questions. FoodieQA comprises three multiple-choice question-answering tasks where models need to answer questions based on multiple images, a single image, and text-only descriptions, respectively. While LLMs excel at text-based question answering, surpassing human accuracy, the open-sourced VLMs still fall short by 41% on multi-image and 21% on single-image VQA tasks, although closed-weights models perform closer to human levels (within 10%). Our findings highlight that understanding food and its... | Wenyan Li, Xinyu Zhang, Jiaang Li, Qiwei Peng, Raphael Tang, Li Zhou, Weijia Zhang, Guimin Hu, Yifei Yuan, Anders Søgaard, Daniel Hershcovich, Desmond Elliott |  |

However, creating such resources is expensive and non-trivial. To this end, we propose a novel two-step approach that encompasses two pronunciation tasks: grapheme-to-phoneme and post-lexical processing. We then investigate the efficacy of the proposed approach with a notably limited amount of sentence-level pronunciation data. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed two-step approach effectively mitigates the lack of extensive labeled data, and serves as a feasible solution for addressing French phonological phenomena even under resource-constrained environments. | Hoyeon Lee, Hyeeun Jang, JongHwan Kim, JaeMin Kim |  |

Independent Component Analysis (ICA) creates clearer semantic axes by identifying independent key features. Previous research has shown ICA’s potential to reveal universal semantic axes across languages. However, it lacked verification of the consistency of independent components within and across languages. We investigated the consistency of semantic axes in two ways: both within a single language and across multiple languages. We first probed into intra-language consistency, focusing on the reproducibility of axes by performing ICA multiple times and clustering the outcomes. Then, we statistically examined inter-language consistency by verifying those axes’ correspondences using statistical tests. We newly applied statistical methods to establish a robust framework that ensures the reliability and universality of semantic axes. | Rongzhi Li, Takeru Matsuda, Hitomi Yanaka |  |

Notably, prior works restrict the task of developing detoxification models to only a seen subset of platforms, leaving the question of how the models would perform on unseen platforms unexplored. Additionally, these works do not address non-detoxifiability, a phenomenon whereby the toxic text cannot be detoxified without altering the meaning. We propose DetoxLLM, the first comprehensive end-to-end detoxification framework, which attempts to alleviate the aforementioned limitations. We first introduce a cross-platform pseudo-parallel corpus applying multi-step data processing and generation strategies leveraging ChatGPT. We then train a suite of detoxification models with our cross-platform corpus. We show that our detoxification models outperform the SoTA model trained with human-annotated parallel corpus. We further introduce explanation to... | Md Tawkat Islam Khondaker, Muhammad AbdulMageed, Laks V. S. Lakshmanan |  |

We developed and evaluated two types of classifiers: BERT and GPT-3.5 turbo. Our results demonstrate that the BERT classifier significantly outperforms GPT-3.5 turbo in detecting connective language. Furthermore, our analysis confirms that connective language is distinct from related concepts measuring discourse qualities, such as politeness and toxicity. We also explore the potential of BERT-based classifiers for platform-agnostic tools. This research advances our understanding of the linguistic dimensions of online communication and proposes practical tools for detecting connective language across diverse digital environments. | Josephine Lukito, Bin Chen, Gina M.

Contextual sparsity, where the sparsity pattern is input-dependent, is crucial in LLMs because the permanent removal of attention heads or neurons from LLMs can significantly degrade accuracy. Prior work has attempted to model contextual sparsity using neural networks trained to predict activation magnitudes, which can be used to dynamically prune structures with low predicted activation magnitude. In this paper, we look beyond magnitude-based pruning criteria to assess attention head and neuron importance in LLMs. We develop a novel predictor called ShadowLLM, which can shadow the LLM behavior and enforce better sparsity patterns, resulting in over 15% improvement in end-to-end accuracy compared to prior methods. In addition, ShadowLLM achieves up to a 20% speed-up over the state-of-the-art DejaVu framework. These... | Yash Akhauri, Ahmed F. AbouElhamayed, Jordan Dotzel, Zhiru Zhang, Alexander M.

In psychology, variation in the ability of individuals to differentiate between emotion concepts is called emotion granularity (determined through self-reports of one’s emotions). High emotion granularity has been linked with better mental and physical health; whereas low emotion granularity has been linked with maladaptive emotion regulation strategies and poor health outcomes. In this work, we propose computational measures of emotion granularity derived from temporally-ordered speaker utterances in social media (in lieu of self reports that suffer from various biases). We then investigate the effectiveness of such text-derived measures of emotion granularity in functioning as markers of various mental health conditions (MHCs). We establish baseline measures of emotion granularity derived from textual utterances, and show... | Krishnapriya Vishnubhotla, Daniela Teodorescu, Mallory J. Feldman, Kristen A. Lindquist, Saif M.

While the details are unknown to the open research community, it likely involves significant amounts of curated data and compute, neither of which is readily accessible. In this paper, we present BLSP-Emo (Bootstrapped Language-Speech Pretraining with Emotion support), a novel approach to developing an end-to-end speech-language model capable of understanding both semantics and emotions in speech and generate empathetic responses. BLSP-Emo utilizes existing speech recognition (ASR) and speech emotion recognition (SER) datasets through a two-stage process. The first stage focuses on semantic alignment, following recent work on pretraining speech-language models using ASR data. The second stage performs emotion alignment with the pretrained speech-language model on an... | Chen Wang, Minpeng Liao, Zhongqiang Huang, Junhong Wu, Chengqing Zong, Jiajun Zhang |  |

One way to do this for classification tasks is via dataset synthesis, which can be accomplished by generating examples of each label from the LLM. Prior approaches to synthesis use few-shot prompting, which relies on the LLM’s parametric knowledge to generate usable examples. However, this leads to issues of repetition, bias towards popular entities, and stylistic differences from human text. In this work, we propose Synthesize by Retrieval and Refinement (SynthesizRR), which uses retrieval augmentation to introduce variety into the dataset synthesis process: as retrieved passages vary, the LLM is seeded with different content to generate its examples. We empirically study the synthesis of six datasets, covering topic classification, sentiment analysis, tone detection, and humor, requiring complex synthesis strategies. We find SynthesizRR... | Abhishek Divekar, Greg Durrett |  |

They often struggle with simple daily tasks, such as reading time from a clock, understanding a flowchart, or planning a route using a road map. In light of this, we design a multi-modal self-instruct, utilizing large language models and their code capabilities to synthesize massive abstract images and visual reasoning instructions across daily scenarios. Our strategy effortlessly creates a multimodal benchmark with 11,193 instructions for eight visual scenarios: charts, tables, simulated maps, dashboards, flowcharts, relation graphs, floor plans, and visual puzzles. This benchmark, constructed with simple lines and geometric elements, exposes the shortcomings of most advanced LMMs like GPT-4V and Llava in abstract image understanding,... | Wenqi Zhang, Zhenglin Cheng, Yuanyu He, Mengna Wang, Yongliang Shen, Zeqi Tan, Guiyang Hou, Mingqian He, Yanna Ma, Weiming Lu, Yueting Zhuang |  |

These stories integrate visual aids, such as highlighted bars and lines in charts, along with textual annotations explaining insights. However, creating such stories requires a deep understanding of the data and meticulous narrative planning, often necessitating human intervention, which can be time-consuming and mentally taxing. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in various NLP tasks, their ability to generate coherent and comprehensive data stories remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel task for data story generation and a benchmark containing 1,449 stories from diverse sources. To address the challenges of crafting coherent data stories, we propose a multi-agent framework employing two LLM agents designed to replicate the human storytelling process: one for understanding and describing the data (Reflection), generating the... | Mohammed Saidul Islam, Md.

The diversity of the data distributions and cost of joint training makes the optimization procedure extremely challenging. Data mixing methods partially address this problem, albeit having a sub-optimal performance across data sources and require multiple expensive training runs. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient alternative for better optimization of the data sources by combining models individually trained on each data source with the base model using basic element-wise vector operations. The resulting model, namely Distribution Edited Model (DEM), is cheaper than standard data mixing and outperforms strong baselines on a variety of benchmarks, yielding upto 6.2% improvement on MMLU, 11.5% on BBH, 16.1% on DROP, 6% MathQA and 9.3% on HELM with models of size 3B to 13B.

Existing works typically have two shortcomings. First, they caption images from scratch, ignoring existing alt-text metadata, and second, lack transparency if the captioners’ training data (e.g. GPT) is unknown. In this paper, we study a principled approach Altogether based on the key idea to edit and re-align existing alt-texts associated with the images. To generate training data, we perform human annotation where annotators start with the existing alt-text and re-align it to the image content in multiple rounds, consequently constructing captions with rich visual concepts. This differs from prior work that carries out human annotation as a one-time description task solely based on images and annotator knowledge. We train a captioner on this data that generalizes the process of re-aligning alt-texts at scale. Our results show our Altogether approach leads to richer image captions that also... | Hu Xu, PoYao Huang, Xiaoqing Ellen Tan, ChingFeng Yeh, Jacob Kahn, Christine Jou, Gargi Ghosh, Omer Levy, Luke Zettlemoyer, Wentau Yih, ShangWen Li, Saining Xie, Christoph Feichtenhofer |  |

To overcome this, we propose to construct pseudo-generated samples (premise-hypothesis pairs) using class-specific fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) thereby reducing the human effort and the costs in annotating large amounts of data. However, despite the impressive performance of LLMs, it is necessary to verify that the pseudo-generated labels are actually correct. Towards this goal, in this paper, we propose VerifyMatch, a semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach in which the LLM pseudo-labels guide the training of the SSL model and, at the same time, the SSL model acts as a verifier of the LLM-generated data. In our approach, we retain all pseudo-labeled samples, but to ensure unlabeled data... | Seoyeon Park, Cornelia Caragea |  |

A fundamental aspect of plans is the temporal order in which their steps need to be executed, which reflects the underlying causal dependencies between them. We introduce CaT-Bench, a benchmark of Step Order Prediction questions, which test whether a step must necessarily occur before or after another in cooking recipe plans. We use this to evaluate how well frontier LLMs understand causal and temporal dependencies. We find that SOTA LLMs are underwhelming (best zero-shot is only 0.59 in F1), and are biased towards predicting dependence more often, perhaps relying on temporal order of steps as a heuristic. While prompting for explanations and using few-shot examples improve performance, the best F1 result is only 0.73. Further, human evaluation of explanations along with answer correctness show that, on... | Yash Kumar Lal, Vanya Cohen, Nathanael Chambers, Niranjan Balasubramanian, Raymond J. Mooney |  |

To be useful, these metrics should be fine-grained, show a high correlation with human annotations, and ideally be independant of reference quality; however, most standard evaluation metrics for summarization are reference-based, and existing reference-free metrics correlates poorly with relevance, especially on summaries of longer documents. In this paper, we introduce a reference-free metric that correlates well with human evaluated relevance, while being very cheap to compute. We show that this metric can also be used along reference-based metrics to improve their robustness in low quality reference settings. | Théo Gigant, Camille Guinaudeau, Marc Decombas, Frédéric Dufaux |  |

This work introduces a comprehensive evaluation framework that systematically examines the role of instructions and inputs in the generalisation abilities of such models, considering architectural design, input perturbations across language and vision modalities, and increased task complexity. The proposed framework uncovers the resilience of multimodal models to extreme instruction perturbations and their vulnerability to observational changes, raising concerns about overfitting to spurious correlations. By employing this evaluation framework on current Transformer-based multimodal models for robotic manipulation tasks, we uncover limitations and suggest future advancements should focus on architectural and training innovations that better integrate multimodal inputs, enhancing a model’s generalisation prowess by... | Amit Parekh, Nikolas Vitsakis, Alessandro Suglia, Ioannis Konstas |  |

In this paper, we apply PEFT methods (P-tuning, Adapters, and LoRA) to a modified Retrieval-Enhanced Transformer (RETRO) and a baseline GPT model across several sizes, ranging from 823 million to 48 billion parameters. We show that RETRO models outperform GPT models in zero-shot settings due to their unique pre-training process but GPT models have higher performance potential with PEFT. Additionally, our study indicates that 8B parameter models strike an optimal balance between cost and performance and P-tuning lags behind other PEFT techniques. We further provide a comparative analysis of between applying PEFT to Instruction-tuned RETRO model and base RETRO model. This work presents the first comprehensive comparison of various PEFT methods integrated with RAG, applied to both GPT and RETRO models,... | Aleksander Ficek, Jiaqi Zeng, Oleksii Kuchaiev |  |

However, generating complex code within real-world scenarios remains challenging due to intricate structures, subtle bugs, understanding of advanced data types, and lack of supplementary contents. To address these challenges, we introduce the CoCoST framework, which enhances complex code generation by online searching for more information with planned queries and correctness testing for code refinement. Moreover, CoCoST serializes the complex inputs and outputs to improve comprehension and generates test cases to ensure the adaptability for real-world applications. CoCoST is validated through rigorous experiments on the DS-1000 and ClassEval datasets. Experimental results show that CoCoST substantially improves the quality of complex code generation, highlighting its potential to enhance the practicality of LLMs in generating complex code. | Xinyi He, Jiaru Zou, Yun Lin, Mengyu Zhou, Shi Han, Zejian Yuan, Dongmei Zhang |  |

However, sequential function calling using LLMs with interdependence between functions is still under-explored. To this end, we introduce GraphQLRestBench, a dataset consisting of natural language utterances paired with function call sequences representing real-world REST API calls with variable mapping between functions. In order to represent the response structure of the functions in the LLM prompt, we use the GraphQL schema of the REST APIs. We also introduce a custom evaluation framework for our dataset consisting of four specially designed metrics. We evaluate various open-source LLMs on our dataset using few-shot Chain-of-Thought and ReAct prompting to establish a reasonable baseline. | Avirup Saha, Lakshmi Mandal, Balaji Ganesan, Sambit Ghosh, Renuka Sindhgatta, Carlos Eberhardt, Dan Debrunner, Sameep Mehta |  |

We employ a visual question answer and explanation task where we control the AI system’s limitations by manipulating the visual inputs: during inference, the system either processes full-color or grayscale images. Our goal is to determine whether participants can perceive the limitations of the system. We hypothesize that explanations will make limited AI capabilities more transparent to users. However, our results show that explanations do not have this effect. Instead of allowing users to more accurately assess the limitations of the AI system, explanations generally increase users’ perceptions of the system’s competence – regardless of its actual performance. | Judith Sieker, Simeon Junker, Ronja Utescher, Nazia Attari, Heiko Wersing, Hendrik Buschmeier, Sina Zarrieß |  |

Despite the complexities of script differences and tokenization, these approaches have been indiscriminately applied to summarization across multiple languages. While previous works have argued that these approaches correlate strongly with human ratings in English, it remains unclear whether the conclusion holds for other languages. To answer this question, we construct a small-scale pilot dataset containing article-summary pairs and human ratings in English, Chinese and Indonesian. To measure the strength of summaries, our ratings are measured as head-to-head comparisons with resulting Elo scores across four dimensions. Our analysis reveals that standard metrics are unreliable measures of quality, and that these problems are exacerbated in Chinese and Indonesian. We advocate for more nuanced and careful considerations in designing a robust evaluation... | Jessica Forde, Ruochen Zhang, Lintang Sutawika, Alham Fikri Aji, Samuel Cahyawijaya, Genta Indra Winata, Minghao Wu, Carsten Eickhoff, Stella Biderman, Ellie Pavlick |  |

Existing methods extract each candidate tube feature independently by cropping objects from video frame feature, discarding all contextual information such as position change and inter-entity relationship. In this paper, we propose Video-Text Prompting(VTP) to construct candidate feature. Instead of cropping tube region from feature map, we draw visual markers(e.g. red circle) over objects tubes as video prompts; corresponding text prompt(e.g. in red circle) is also inserted after the subject word of query text to highlight its presence. Nevertheless, each candidate feature may look similar without cropping. To address this, we further propose Contrastive VTP(CVTP) by introducing negative contrastive samples whose candidate object is erased instead of being highlighted; by comparing the difference between VTP candidate and the... | Heng Zhao, Yinjie Zhao, Bihan Wen, YewSoon Ong, Joey Zhou |  |

We rely on a weighted finite state automaton for both marginal and maximum a posteriori inference. As such, our method is sound in the sense that (1) well-formedness of predicted tag sequences is ensured via the automaton structure and (2) there is an unambiguous mapping between well-formed sequences of tags and (discontinuous) mentions. We evaluate our approach on three English datasets in the biomedical domain, and report comparable results to state-of-the-art while having a way simpler and faster model. | Caio Corro |  |

Unfortunately, in many cases, LLM responses are factually incorrect, which limits their applicability in real-world scenarios. As a result, research on evaluating and improving the factuality of LLMs has attracted a lot of research attention recently. In this survey, we critically analyze existing work with the aim to identify the major challenges and their associated causes, pointing out to potential solutions for improving the factuality of LLMs, and analyzing the obstacles to automated factuality evaluation for open-ended text generation. We further offer an outlook on where future research should go. | Yuxia Wang, Minghan Wang, Muhammad Arslan Manzoor, Fei Liu, Georgi N. Georgiev, Rocktim Jyoti Das, Preslav Nakov |  |

However, local explanations are not effective in predicting the model’s behavior on unseen texts. We aim at explaining a neural relevance model by providing lexical explanations that can be globally generalized. Specifically, we construct a relevance thesaurus containing semantically relevant query term and document term pairs, which can augment BM25 scoring functions to better approximate the neural model’s predictions. We propose a novel method to build a relevance thesaurus construction. Our method involves training a neural relevance model which can score the relevance for partial segments of query and documents. The trained model is used to identify relevant terms over the vocabulary space. The resulting thesaurus explanation is evaluated based on ranking effectiveness and fidelity to the targeted neural ranking model. Finally, our... | Youngwoo Kim, Razieh Rahimi, James Allan |  |

We assessed eight large language models, all of which demonstrated the capability to provide explanations grounded in varying moral perspectives for both critiquing and endorsing views that reflect sexist assumptions. With both human and automatic evaluation, we show that all eight models produce comprehensible and contextually relevant text, which is helpful in understanding diverse views on how sexism is perceived. Also, through analysis of moral foundations cited by LLMs in their arguments, we uncover the diverse ideological perspectives in models’ outputs, with some models aligning more with progressive or conservative views on gender roles and sexism.Based on our observations, we caution against the potential misuse of LLMs to justify sexist language. We also highlight that LLMs can serve as tools for understanding the roots of sexist beliefs and designing... | Rongchen Guo, Isar Nejadgholi, Hillary Dawkins, Kathleen C.

Recent work proposes automatic methods for identifying and explaining systematic biases using keywords. We introduce DISCERN, a framework for interpreting systematic biases in text classifiers using language explanations. DISCERN iteratively generates precise natural language descriptions of systematic errors by employing an interactive loop between two large language models. Finally, we use the descriptions to improve classifiers by augmenting classifier training sets with synthetically generated instances or annotated examples via active learning. On three text-classification datasets, we demonstrate that language explanations from our framework induce consistent performance improvements that go beyond what is achievable with exemplars of systematic bias. Finally, in human... | Rakesh R. Menon, Shashank Srivastava |  |

However, to obtain strong downstream performances, prompts need to be carefully curated, which can be a tedious engineering task. To address the issue of manual prompt engineering, prompt-tuning is used where a set of contextual vectors are learned by leveraging information from the training data. Despite their effectiveness, existing prompt-tuning frameworks often lack interpretability, thus limiting their ability to understand the compositional nature of images. In this work, we first identify that incorporating compositional attributes (e.g., a “green” tree frog) in the design of manual prompts can significantly enhance image-text alignment scores. Building upon this observation, we propose a novel and interpretable prompt-tuning method named IntCoOp, which learns to jointly align attribute-level inductive biases and class embeddings... | Soumya Suvra Ghosal, Samyadeep Basu, Soheil Feizi, Dinesh Manocha |  |

While seq2seq models hold the state of the art on DRT parsing, their accuracy degrades with the complexity of the sentence, and they sometimes struggle to produce well-formed DRT representations. We introduce the AMS parser, a compositional, neurosymbolic semantic parser for DRT. It rests on a novel mechanism for predicting quantifier scope. We show that the AMS parser reliably produces well-formed outputs and performs well on DRT parsing, especially on complex sentences. | Xiulin Yang, Jonas Groschwitz, Alexander Koller, Johan Bos |  |

Through a diverse set of prompts tailored to ensure response robustness, we find a general inclination of LLM values towards younger demographics, especially when compared to the US population. Although a general inclination can be observed, we also found that this inclination toward younger groups can be different across different value categories. Additionally, we explore the impact of incorporating age identity information in prompts and observe challenges in mitigating value discrepancies with different age cohorts. Our findings highlight the age bias in LLMs and provide insights for future work.

On this front both context and time dynamics as well as their interplay are of prime importance. Current approaches model context via pre-trained representations, which are typically temporally agnostic. Previous work on modelling context and temporal dynamics has used recurrent methods, which are slow and prone to overfitting. Here we introduce TempoFormer, the first task-agnostic transformer-based and temporally-aware model for dynamic representation learning. Our approach is jointly trained on inter and intra context dynamics and introduces a novel temporal variation of rotary positional embeddings. The architecture is flexible and can be used as the temporal representation foundation of other models or applied to different transformer-based architectures. We show new SOTA performance on three different real-time change detection tasks. | Talia Tseriotou, Adam Tsakalidis, Maria Liakata |  |

To provide an initial answer for this question, we have carried out a contest between Patricio Pron (an awarded novelist, considered one of the best of his generation) and GPT-4 (one of the top performing LLMs), in the spirit of AI-human duels such as DeepBlue vs Kasparov and AlphaGo vs Lee Sidol. We asked Pron and GPT-4 to provide thirty titles each, and then to write short stories for both their titles and their opponent’s. Then, we prepared an evaluation rubric inspired by Boden’s definition of creativity, and we collected several detailed expert assessments of the texts, provided by literature critics and scholars. The results of our experimentation indicate that LLMs are still far from challenging a top human creative writer. We also observed that GPT-4 writes more creatively using Pron’s titles than its own titles (which is an indication of the potential for human-machine... | Guillermo Marco, Julio Gonzalo, María Teresa Mateo Girona, Ramón Santos |  |

Creative NLG, such as automatic poetry generation, is a fascinating niche in this area. While most previous research has focused on forms of the Turing test when evaluating automatic poetry generation — can humans distinguish between automatic and human generated poetry — we evaluate the diversity of automatically generated poetry (with a focus on quatrains), by comparing distributions of generated poetry to distributions of human poetry along structural, lexical, semantic and stylistic dimensions, assessing different model types (word vs. character-level, general purpose LLMs vs. poetry-specific models), including the very recent LLaMA3-8B, and types of fine-tuning (conditioned vs. unconditioned). We find that current automatic poetry systems are considerably underdiverse along multiple dimensions — they often do not rhyme sufficiently, are semantically too... | Yanran Chen, Hannes Gröner, Sina Zarrieß, Steffen Eger |  |

Given that MLMs are continuously trained with increasing amounts of additional data collected over time, an important yet unanswered question is how the social biases encoded with MLMs vary over time. In particular, the number of social media users continues to grow at an exponential rate, and it is a valid concern for the MLMs trained specifically on social media data whether their social biases (if any) would also amplify over time. To empirically analyse this problem, we use a series of MLMs pretrained on chronologically ordered temporal snapshots of corpora. Our analysis reveals that, although social biases are present in all MLMs, most types of social bias remain relatively stable over time (with a few exceptions). To further understand the mechanisms that influence social biases in MLMs, we analyse the temporal corpora used to train the MLMs. Our... | Yi Zhou, Danushka Bollegala, José CamachoCollados |  |

However, previous work reports mixed results with regards to its effectiveness on highly subjective tasks such as hate speech detection. In this paper, we present an in-depth qualitative analysis of the potential and specific pitfalls of synthetic data for hate speech detection in English, with 3,500 manually annotated examples. We show that, across different models, synthetic data created through paraphrasing gold texts can improve out-of-distribution robustness from a computational standpoint. However, this comes at a cost: synthetic data fails to reliably reflect the characteristics of real-world data on a number of linguistic dimensions, it results in drastically different class distributions, and it heavily reduces the representation of both specific identity groups and intersectional hate. | Camilla Casula, Sebastiano Vecellio Salto, Alan Ramponi, Sara Tonelli |  |

It proposes a two-parameter pruning control scheme called ASC with a probabilistic guarantee on rank-safeness competitiveness. ASC uses cluster-level maximum weight segmentation to improve accuracy of rank score bound estimation and threshold-driven pruning, and is targeted for speeding up retrieval applications requiring high relevance competitiveness. The experiments with MS MARCO and BEIR show that ASC improves the accuracy and safeness of pruning for better relevance while delivering a low latency on a single-threaded CPU. | Yifan Qiao, Parker Carlson, Shanxiu He, Yingrui Yang, Tao Yang |  |

This study evaluates the performance of state-of-the-art mLLMs, specifically NLLB-200 (NLLB3.3, NLLB1.3 Distilled1.3, NLB600) and M2M (M2M1.2B, M2M418), in English-Amharic bidirectional translation using the Lesan AI dataset. We employed both automatic and human evaluation methods to analyze translation errors. Automatic evaluation used BLEU, METEOR, chrF, and TER metrics, while human evaluation assessed translation quality at both word and sentence levels. Sentence-level accuracy was rated by annotators on a scale from 0 to 5, and word-level quality was evaluated using Multidimensional Quality Metrics. Our findings indicate that the NLLB3.3B model consistently outperformed other mLLMs across all evaluation methods. Common error included mistranslation, omission, untranslated segments, and additions, with mistranslation being... | Hizkiel Alemayehu, Hamada M. Zahera, AxelCyrille Ngonga Ngomo |  |

Our dataset enables a multifaceted understanding of disinformation. We present a distinctive multilayered methodology for annotating disinformation in texts. What sets our corpus apart is its focus on uncovering hidden intent and manipulation in disinformative content. A team of experts annotated each article with multiple labels indicating both disinformation creators’ intents and the manipulation techniques employed. Additionally, we set new baselines for binary disinformation detection and two multiclass multilabel classification tasks: manipulation techniques and intention types classification. | Arkadiusz Modzelewski, Giovanni Da San Martino, Pavel Savov, Magdalena Wilczynska, Adam Wierzbicki |  |

We train a tokenizer for American Sign Language (ASL) fingerspelling, which discretizes sequences of fingerspelling signs into tokens. We also propose a loss function to improve the interpretability of these tokens such that they preserve both the semantic and the visual information of the signal. We show that the proposed method improves the performance of the discretized sequence on downstream tasks. | Artem Abzaliev, Rada Mihalcea |  |

We posit that we can extend our understanding of LLMs’ ToM abilities by evaluating key human ToM precursors-perception inference and perception-to-belief inference-in LLMs. We introduce two datasets, Percept-ToMi and Percept-FANToM, to evaluate these precursory inferences for ToM in LLMs by annotating characters’ perceptions on ToMi and FANToM, respectively.Our evaluation of eight state-of-the-art LLMs reveals that the models generally perform well in perception inference while exhibiting limited capability in perception-to-belief inference (e.g., lack of inhibitory control).Based on these results, we present PercepToM, a novel ToM method leveraging LLMs’ strong perception inference capability while supplementing their limited perception-to-belief inference.

Despite significant advancement achieved in extractive summarization by Large Language Models (LLMs), these summaries frequently exhibit incoherence. An important aspect of the coherent summary is its readability for intended users. Although there have been many datasets and benchmarks proposed for creating coherent extractive summaries, none of them currently incorporate user intent to improve coherence in extractive summarization. Motivated by this, we propose a systematically created human-annotated dataset consisting of coherent summaries for five publicly available datasets and natural language user feedback, offering valuable insights into how to improve coherence in extractive summaries. We utilize this dataset for aligning LLMs through supervised fine-tuning with natural... | Mihir Parmar, Hanieh Deilamsalehy, Franck Dernoncourt, Seunghyun Yoon, Ryan A. Rossi, Trung Bui |  |

Contextual bandits have been widely used in recommendation systems to generate personalized suggestions based on user-specific contexts. We show that LLMs, pre-trained on extensive corpora rich in human knowledge and preferences, can simulate human behaviours well enough to jump-start contextual multi-armed bandits to reduce online learning regret. We propose an initialization algorithm for contextual bandits by prompting LLMs to produce a pre-training dataset of approximate human preferences for the bandit. This significantly reduces online learning regret and data-gathering costs for training such models. Our approach is validated empirically through two sets of experiments with different bandit setups: one which utilizes LLMs to serve as an oracle and a real-world experiment utilizing data from a conjoint survey experiment. | Parand A.

Contrary to traditional deep learning, large language models (LLMs) are (i) even more overparameterized, (ii) trained on unlabeled text corpora curated from the Internet with minimal human intervention, and (iii) trained in an online fashion. These stark contrasts prevent researchers from transferring lessons learned on model generalization and adaptation in deep learning contexts to LLMs.To this end, our short paper introduces empirical observations that aim to shed light on further training of already pretrained language models. Specifically, we demonstrate that training a model on a text domain could degrade its perplexity on the test portion of the same domain. We observe with our subsequent analysis that the performance degradation is positively correlated with the similarity between the additional and the original pretraining... | Firat Öncel, Matthias Bethge, Beyza Ermis, Mirco Ravanelli, Cem Subakan, Çagatay Yildiz |  |

However, the existing RAG paradigm inevitably suffers from the impact of flawed information introduced during the retrieval phrase, thereby diminishing the reliability and correctness of the generated outcomes. In this paper, we propose Credibility-aware Generation (CAG), a universally applicable framework designed to mitigate the impact of flawed information in RAG. At its core, CAG aims to equip models with the ability to discern and process information based on its credibility. To this end, we propose an innovative data transformation framework that generates data based on credibility, thereby effectively endowing models with the capability of CAG. Furthermore, to accurately evaluate the models’ capabilities of CAG, we construct a comprehensive benchmark covering... | Ruotong Pan, Boxi Cao, Hongyu Lin, Xianpei Han, Jia Zheng, Sirui Wang, Xunliang Cai, Le Sun |  |

While these models bear the potential to be used as approximations of human subjects in behavioral studies, prior efforts have been limited in steering model responses to match individual human users. In this work, we introduce Anthology, a method for conditioning LLMs to particular virtual personas by harnessing open-ended life narratives, which we refer to as backstories. We show that our methodology enhances the consistency and reliability of experimental outcomes while ensuring better representation of diverse sub-populations. Across three nationally representative human surveys conducted as part of Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel (ATP), we demonstrate that Anthology achieves up to 18% improvement in matching the response distributions of human respondents and 27% improvement in consistency metrics. | Suhong Moon, Marwa Abdulhai, Minwoo Kang, Joseph Suh, Widyadewi Soedarmadji, Eran Kohen Behar, David M.

Hence, it is a good domain to evaluate reasoning capability of a model which can then guide us to improve the reasoning ability of models. However, most existing works evaluate only the final predicted answer of a puzzle, without delving into an in-depth analysis of the LLMs’ reasoning chains (such as where they falter) or providing any finer metrics to evaluate them. Since LLMs may rely on simple heuristics or artifacts to predict the final answer, it is crucial to evaluate the generated reasoning chain beyond overall correctness measures, for accurately evaluating the reasoning abilities of LLMs. To this end, we first develop GridPuzzle, an evaluation dataset comprising of 274 grid-based puzzles with different complexities. Second, we propose a new error taxonomy derived from manual analysis of reasoning chains from LLMs including GPT-4, Claude-3, Gemini, Mistral, and Llama-2. Then, we develop a LLM-based... | Nemika Tyagi, Mihir Parmar, Mohith Kulkarni, Aswin RRV, Nisarg Patel, Mutsumi Nakamura, Arindam Mitra, Chitta Baral |  |

However, in this paper, we point out that traditional evaluations which focus solely on performance metrics miss a key factor: the increased effectiveness due to additional compute. By overlooking this aspect, a skewed view of strategy efficiency is often presented. This paper introduces a framework that incorporates the compute budget into the evaluation, providing a more informative comparison that takes into account both performance metrics and computational cost. In this budget-aware perspective, we find that complex reasoning strategies often don’t surpass simpler baselines purely due to algorithmic ingenuity, but rather due to the larger computational resources allocated. When we provide a simple baseline like chain-of-thought self-consistency with comparable compute resources, it frequently outperforms reasoning strategies proposed in the literature.

We investigate this by building StoryPerceptions, a dataset of 2,496 perceptions of storytelling in 502 social media texts from 255 crowd workers, including categorical labels along with free-text storytelling rationales, authorial intent, and more. We construct a fine-grained bottom-up taxonomy of crowd workers’ varied and nuanced perceptions of storytelling by open-coding their free-text rationales. Through comparative analyses at the label and code level, we illuminate patterns of disagreement among crowd workers and across other annotation contexts, including prescriptive labeling from researchers and LLM-based predictions. Notably, plot complexity, references to generalized or abstract actions, and holistic aesthetic judgments (such as a sense of cohesion) are especially important in... | Joel Mire, Maria Antoniak, Elliott Ash, Andrew Piper, Maarten Sap |  |

Salience Prediction of Inquisitive Questions](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.1114) |  | 0 | Inquisitive questions — open-ended, curiosity-driven questions people ask as they read — are an integral part of discourse processing and comprehension. Recent work in NLP has taken advantage of question generation capabilities of LLMs to enhance a wide range of applications. But the space of inquisitive questions is vast: many questions can be evoked from a given context. So which of those should be prioritized to find answers? Linguistic theories, unfortunately, have not yet provided an answer to this question. This paper presents QSalience, a salience predictor of inquisitive questions. QSalience is instruction-tuned over our dataset of linguist-annotated salience scores of 1,766 (context, question) pairs. A question scores high on salience if answering it would greatly enhance the understanding of the text. We show that highly salient questions are empirically more likely to be answered in the same article, bridging potential questions with Questions Under Discussion.

Current research predominantly treats personality recognition as a classification task, failing to reveal the supporting evidence for the recognized personality. In this paper, we propose a novel task named Explainable Personality Recognition, aiming to reveal the reasoning process as supporting evidence of the personality trait. Inspired by personality theories, personality traits are made up of stable patterns of personality state, where the states are short-term characteristic patterns of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in a concrete situation at a specific moment in time. We propose an explainable personality recognition framework called Chain-of-Personality-Evidence (CoPE), which involves a reasoning process from specific contexts to short-term personality states to long-term personality traits. Furthermore, based on the CoPE framework, we construct an... | Lei Sun, Jinming Zhao, Qin Jin |  |

Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods address this issue by adapting models using test samples at inference time. However, current ASR TTA methods have largely focused on non-continual TTA, which limits cross-sample knowledge learning compared to continual TTA. In this work, we first propose a Fast-slow TTA framework for ASR that leverages the advantage of continual and non-continual TTA. Following this framework, we introduce Dynamic SUTA (DSUTA), an entropy-minimization-based continual TTA method for ASR. To enhance DSUTA’s robustness for time-varying data, we design a dynamic reset strategy to automatically detect domain shifts and reset the model, making it more effective at handling multi-domain data. Our method demonstrates superior performance on various noisy ASR datasets,... | GuanTing Lin, Wei Huang, Hungyi Lee |  |

Large language models have shown promising results in arithmetic and symbolic reasoning by expressing intermediate reasoning in text as a chain of thought, yet struggle to extend this capability to answer text queries that are easily solved by visual reasoning, even with extensive multimodal pretraining. We introduce a simple method, whiteboard-of-thought prompting, to unlock the visual reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models across modalities. Whiteboard-of-thought prompting provides multimodal large language models with a metaphorical ‘whiteboard’ to draw out reasoning steps as images, then returns these images back to the model for further processing. We find this can be accomplished with no demonstrations or specialized modules, instead leveraging models’ existing ability to write code with libraries such as... | Sachit Menon, Richard S.

However, how to reliably evaluate code generated by LLMs remains an unresolved problem. This paper presents CodeJudge, a code evaluation framework that leverages LLMs to evaluate the semantic correctness of generated code without the need for test cases. We investigate different ways to guide the LLM in performing “slow thinking” to arrive at an in-depth and reliable evaluation. We experimented with four LLMs as evaluators on four code generation datasets and five programming languages. The results show that CodeJudge significantly outperformed existing methods in most settings. Furthermore, compared with a SOTA GPT-3.5-based code evaluation method, CodeJudge achieved better results even when using a much smaller model, Llama-3-8B-Instruct.

However, the advancement of medical image understanding and reasoning critically depends on building high-quality visual instruction data, which is costly and labor-intensive to obtain, particularly in the medical domain. To mitigate this data-starving issue, we introduce Self-Training Large Language and Vision Assistant for Medical (STLLaVA-Med). The proposed method is designed to train a policy model (an LVLM) capable of auto-generating medical visual instruction data to improve data efficiency, guided through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Specifically, a more powerful and larger LVLM (e.g., GPT-4o) is involved as a biomedical expert to oversee the DPO fine-tuning process on the auto-generated data, encouraging the policy model to align efficiently with human preferences. We validate the efficacy and data efficiency of STLLaVA-Med... | Guohao Sun, Can Qin, Huazhu Fu, Linwei Wang, Zhiqiang Tao |  |

To counter the high costs and limited availability of expert-annotated data for factual alignment, this study introduces an innovative pipeline that utilizes >100B parameter GPT variants like GPT-3.5 & GPT-4 to act as synthetic experts to generate high-quality synthetics feedback aimed at enhancing factual consistency in clinical note summarization. Our research primarily focuses on edit feedback generated by these synthetic feedback experts without additional human annotations, mirroring and optimizing the practical scenario in which medical professionals refine AI system outputs. Although such 100B+ parameter GPT variants have proven to demonstrate expertise in various clinical NLP tasks, such as the Medical Licensing Examination, there... | Prakamya Mishra, Zonghai Yao, Parth Vashisht, Feiyun Ouyang, Beining Wang, Vidhi Dhaval Mody, Hong Yu |  |

However, concerns regarding their security, particularly the vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, persist. Drawing inspiration from adversarial training in deep learning and LLM agent learning processes, we introduce the In-Context Adversarial Game (ICAG) for defending against jailbreaks without the need for fine-tuning. ICAG leverages agent learning to conduct an adversarial game, aiming to dynamically extend knowledge to defend against jailbreaks. Unlike traditional methods that rely on static datasets, ICAG employs an iterative process to enhance both the defense and attack agents. This continuous improvement process strengthens defenses against newly generated jailbreak prompts. Our empirical studies affirm ICAG’s efficacy, where LLMs safeguarded by ICAG exhibit significantly reduced jailbreak success rates across various attack scenarios. Moreover, ICAG demonstrates remarkable... | Yujun Zhou, Yufei Han, Haomin Zhuang, Kehan Guo, Zhenwen Liang, Hongyan Bao, Xiangliang Zhang |  |

These practices can be traced in textual exchanges, and reflect the intentions, knowledge, values, and norms of users and communities. This paper introduces a comprehensive methodological workflow for computational identification of such practices within social media texts. By focusing on supporters of Ukraine during the Russia-Ukraine war in (1) the activist collective NAFO and (2) the Eurovision Twitter community, we present a gold-standard data set capturing their unique practices. Using this corpus, we perform practice prediction experiments with both open-source baseline models and OpenAI’s large language models (LLMs). Our results demonstrate that closed-source models, especially GPT-4, achieve superior performance, particularly with prompts that incorporate salient features of practices, or utilize Chain-of-Thought prompting.

However, the complexities of understanding and categorising this content across various languages remain an important challenge with traditional techniques like topic modelling often struggling to accommodate this multilingual diversity. In this paper, we introduce X-Topic, a multilingual dataset featuring content in four distinct languages (English, Spanish, Japanese, and Greek), crafted for the purpose of tweet topic classification. Our dataset includes a wide range of topics, tailored for social media content, making it a valuable resource for scientists and professionals working on cross-linguistic analysis, the development of robust multilingual models, and computational scientists studying online dialogue. Finally, we leverage X-Topic to perform a comprehensive cross-linguistic and multilingual analysis, and compare the capabilities of current general- and... | Dimosthenis Antypas, Asahi Ushio, Francesco Barbieri, José CamachoCollados |  |

However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on single-turn evaluations, overlooking the models’ capabilities in multi-turn interactions. To address this gap, we introduce , a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the multi-turn conversational abilities of LLMs. By analyzing human-LLM conversations, we categorize interaction patterns into four types: recollection, expansion, refinement, and follow-up. We construct multi-turn queries for each category either by augmenting existing datasets or creating new examples using GPT-4 with a human-in-the-loop process to avoid data leakage. To study the factors impacting multi-turn abilities, we create single-turn versions of the 1170 multi-turn queries and compare performance. Our evaluation of 10 well-known LLMs shows that while closed-source models generally surpass open-source ones, certain open-source models exceed... | WaiChung Kwan, Xingshan Zeng, Yuxin Jiang, Yufei Wang, Liangyou Li, Lifeng Shang, Xin Jiang, Qun Liu, KamFai Wong |  |

We address this shortcoming by updating the CLIP model with the Concadia dataset to assign higher scores to descriptions than captions using parameter efficient fine-tuning and a loss objective derived from work on causal interpretability. This model correlates with the judgements of blind and low-vision people while preserving transfer capabilities and has interpretable structure that sheds light on the caption–description distinction. | Amir Zur, Elisa Kreiss, Karel D'Oosterlinck, Christopher Potts, Atticus Geiger |  |

We propose the first dataset of similar command lines, named CyPHER, for training and unbiased evaluation. The training set is generated using a set of large language models (LLMs) comprising 28,520 similar command-line pairs. Our testing dataset consists of 2,807 similar command-line pairs sourced from authentic command-line data.In addition, we propose a command-line embedding model named CmdCaliper, enabling the computation of semantic similarity with command lines. Performance evaluations demonstrate that the smallest version of CmdCaliper (30 million parameters) suppresses state-of-the-art (SOTA) sentence embedding models with ten times more parameters across various tasks (e.g., malicious command-line detection and similar command-line retrieval).Our study explores the feasibility of data generation using LLMs in the... | SianYao Huang, ChengLin Yang, CheYu Lin, ChunYing Huang |  |

Unfortunately, the vast majority of languages are not considered high resource and lack the quantity of parallel sentences needed to train such systems. These under-represented languages are not without resources, however, and bilingual dictionaries and grammar books are available as linguistic reference material. With current large language models (LLMs) supporting near book-length contexts, we can begin to use the available material to ensure advancements are shared among all of the world’s languages. In this paper, we demonstrate incorporating grammar books in the prompt of GPT-4 to improve machine translation and evaluate the performance on 16 topologically diverse low-resource languages, using a combination of reference material to show that the machine translation performance of LLMs can be improved using this method. | Jonathan Hus, Antonios Anastasopoulos |  |

However, in the case of news videos, the setting is more demanding, requiring the inclusion of such named entities for meaningful summarization. Therefore, we introduce the task of directly summarizing news videos into captions that are entity-aware. To facilitate research in this area, we have collected a large-scale dataset named VIEWS (VIdeo NEWS). Within this task, we face challenges inherent to recognizing named entities and navigating diverse, dynamic contexts, all while relying solely on visual cues. To address these challenges, we propose a model-agnostic approach that enriches visual information extracted from videos with context sourced from external knowledge, enabling the generation of entity-aware captions. We validate the effectiveness of our approach across three video captioning... | Hammad A.

We argue that text offers greater expressiveness, enabling users to provide richer feedback than simple comparative preferences and this richer feedback can lead to more efficient and effective alignment. ALT aligns the model by conditioning its generation on the textual feedback. Our method relies solely on language modeling techniques and requires minimal hyper-parameter tuning, though it still presents the main benefit of RL-based algorithms and can effectively learn from textual feedback. We explore the efficacy and efficiency of textual feedback across different tasks such as toxicity reduction, summarization, and dialog response. We find that ALT outperforms PPO for the task of toxicity reduction while being able to match its performance on summarization with only 20% of the samples. We also explore how ALT can be used with feedback provided by an... | Saüc Abadal Lloret, Shehzaad Dhuliawala, Keerthiram Murugesan, Mrinmaya Sachan |  |

When dealing with complex issues, prompt engineers tend to distill multiple patterns from examples and inject relevant solutions to optimize the prompts, achieving satisfying results. However, existing automatic prompt optimization techniques are only limited to producing single flow instructions, struggling with handling diverse patterns. In this paper, we present AMPO, an automatic prompt optimization method that can iteratively develop a multi-branched prompt using failure cases as feedback. Our goal is to explore a novel way of structuring prompts with multi-branches to better handle multiple patterns in complex tasks, for which we introduce three modules: Pattern Recognition, Branch Adjustment, and Branch Pruning. In experiments across five tasks, AMPO consistently achieves the best results. Additionally, our approach demonstrates significant optimization efficiency due to our... | Sheng Yang, Yurong Wu, Yan Gao, Zineng Zhou, Bin Zhu, Xiaodi Sun, JianGuang Lou, Zhiming Ding, Anbang Hu, Yuan Fang, Yunsong Li, Junyan Chen, Linjun Yang |  |

In this work, we introduce DEFT-UCS, a data-efficient fine-tuning framework that leverages unsupervised core-set selection to identify a smaller, representative dataset to fine-tune PLMs for text-generation needed for text editing tasks such as simplification, grammar correction, clarity, etc. We examine the efficacy of DEFT-UCS across multiple text-editing tasks, and compare to the state-of-the art text-editing model, CoEDIT. Our results demonstrate that DEFT-UCS models are just as accurate as CoEDIT, across eight different datasets consisting of six different editing tasks, while finetuned on 70% less data. | Devleena Das, Vivek Khetan |  |

In this study, we recorded brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while participants viewed 8.3 hours of dramas and movies. We annotated these stimuli at multiple semantic levels, which enabled us to extract latent representations of LLMs for this content. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs predict human brain activity more accurately than traditional language models, particularly for complex background stories. Furthermore, we identify distinct brain regions associated with different semantic representations, including multi-modal vision-semantic representations, which highlights the importance of modeling multi-level and multi-modal semantic representations simultaneously. We will make our fMRI dataset publicly... | Yuko Nakagi, Takuya Matsuyama, Naoko KoideMajima, Hiroto Yamaguchi, Rieko Kubo, Shinji Nishimoto, Yu Takagi |  |

Despite their utility, research indicates that LLMs perpetuate systemic biases. Yet, prior works on LLM harms predominantly focus on Western concepts like race and gender, often overlooking cultural concepts from other parts of the world. Additionally, these studies typically investigate “harm” as a singular dimension, ignoring the various and subtle forms in which harms manifest. To address this gap, we introduce the Covert Harms and Social Threats (CHAST), a set of seven metrics grounded in social science literature. We utilize evaluation models aligned with human assessments to examine the presence of covert harms in LLM-generated conversations, particularly in the context of recruitment. Our experiments reveal that seven out of the eight LLMs included in this study generated... | Preetam Prabhu Srikar Dammu, Hayoung Jung, Anjali Singh, Monojit Choudhury, Tanushree Mitra |  |

Specifically, it guides an LLM to fulfill an input instruction by simulating multiple experts, aggregating their responses, and selecting the best among individual and aggregated responses. This process is performed in a single chain of thoughts through our seven carefully designed subtasks derived from the Nominal Group Technique (Ven and Delbecq, 1974), a well-established decision-making framework. Our evaluations demonstrate that Multi-expert Prompting significantly outperforms ExpertPrompting and comparable baselines in enhancing the truthfulness, factuality, informativeness, and usefulness of responses while reducing toxicity and hurtfulness. It further achieves state-of-the-art truthfulness by outperforming the best baseline by 8.69% with ChatGPT.

Large Language Models (LLM) have recently shown promising performance in temporal reasoning tasks such as temporal question answering. Nevertheless, recent studies have tested the LLMs’ performance in detecting temporal relations of closed-source models only, limiting the interpretability of those results. In this work, we investigate LLMs’ performance and decision process in the Temporal Relation Classification task. First, we assess the performance of seven open and closed-sourced LLMs experimenting with in-context learning and lightweight fine-tuning approaches. Results show that LLMs with in-context learning significantly underperform smaller encoder-only models based on RoBERTa. Then, we delve into the possible reasons for this gap by applying explainable methods. The outcome suggests a limitation of LLMs in this task due to their autoregressive... | Gabriel Roccabruna, Massimo Rizzoli, Giuseppe Riccardi |  |

However, existing text watermarking methods are not robust enough against such attacks nor scalable to millions of users for practical implementation. In this paper, we propose Waterfall, the first training-free framework for robust and scalable text watermarking applicable across multiple text types (e.g., articles, code) and languages supportable by LLMs, for general text and LLM data provenance. Waterfall comprises several key innovations, such as being the first to use LLM as paraphrasers for watermarking along with a novel combination of techniques that are surprisingly effective in achieving robust verifiability and scalability. We empirically demonstrate that Waterfall achieves significantly better... | Gregory Kang Ruey Lau, Xinyuan Niu, Hieu Dao, Jiangwei Chen, ChuanSheng Foo, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low |  |

These basic sets, however, are rarely designed with textual data in mind, and culture, language, and dialect can influence how particular emotions are interpreted. In this work, we broaden our scope to a practically unbounded set of affective states, which includes any terms that humans use to describe their experiences of feeling. We collect and publish MASIVE, a dataset of Reddit posts in English and Spanish containing over 1,000 unique affective states each. We then define the new problem of affective state identification for language generation models framed as a masked span prediction task. On this task, we find that smaller finetuned multilingual models outperform much larger LLMs, even on region-specific Spanish affective states. Additionally, we show that pretraining on MASIVE improves model performance on existing emotion... | Nicholas Deas, Elsbeth Turcan, Iván Pérez Mejía, Kathleen R. McKeown |  |

Moreover, while natural datasets of information-seeking questions are often prone to ambiguity or ill-formed, there are troves of freely available, carefully crafted question datasets for many languages. Thus, we automatically generate shorter, information-seeking questions, resembling web queries in the style of the Natural Questions (NQ) dataset from longer trivia data. Training a QA system on these transformed questions is a viable strategy for alternating to more expensive training setups showing the F1 score difference of less than six points and contrasting the final systems. | Tasnim Kabir, Yoo Yeon Sung, Saptarashmi Bandyopadhyay, Hao Zou, Abhranil Chandra, Jordan L.

Due to the limited parameters of LoRA, recent studies seek to combine LoRA with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to boost performance across various tasks. However, inspired by the observed redundancy in traditional MoE structures, prior studies find that LoRA experts within the MoE architecture also exhibit redundancy, suggesting a need to vary the allocation of LoRA experts across different layers. In this paper, we leverage Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR) Theory to design a fine-grained allocation strategy. Our analysis reveals that the number of experts per layer correlates with layer training quality, which exhibits significant variability across layers. Based on this, we introduce AlphaLoRA, a theoretically principled and training-free method for allocating LoRA experts to reduce redundancy further.

In this work, we introduce four sets of explainable templates for common informal logical fallacies designed to explicate a fallacy’s implicit logic. Using our templates, we conduct an annotation study on top of 400 fallacious arguments taken from LOGIC dataset and achieve a high agreement score (Krippendorf’s 𝛼 of 0.54) and reasonable coverage 83%. Finally, we conduct an experiment for detecting the structure of fallacies and discover that state-of-the-art language models struggle with detecting fallacy templates (0.47 accuracy). To facilitate research on fallacies, we make our dataset and guidelines publicly available. | Irfan Robbani, Paul Reisert, Surawat Pothong, Naoya Inoue, Camélia Guerraoui, Wenzhi Wang, Shoichi Naito, Jungmin Choi, Kentaro Inui |  |

Progress towards Social-AI has accelerated in the past decade across several computing communities, including natural language processing, machine learning, robotics, human-machine interaction, computer vision, and speech. Natural language processing, in particular, has been prominent in Social-AI research, as language plays a key role in constructing the social world. In this position paper, we identify a set of underlying technical challenges and open questions for researchers across computing communities to advance Social-AI.

In this paper, we study an adversarial prompt attacking problem for T2I-Refine, where to goal is to implicitly inject specific concept bias to the input prompts during the refinement process so that the generated images, still with higher quality, are explicitly biased to the target group. Our study is motivated by the limitation of current T2I-Refine research that lacks of explorations on the potential capacity of T2I-Refine models to provide prompt refinement service in a biased or advertising manner. To address the limitations, we develop RAt, a prompt refinement and attacking framework that attacks input prompts with intentionally selected adversarial replacements by optimizing a token distribution matrix based on the text-to-image finetuning strategy with a token-level bias obfuscation loss as... | Ziyi Kou, Shichao Pei, Meng Jiang, Xiangliang Zhang |  |

Case Study in Indonesian and Sundanese](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.1145) |  | 0 | Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to generate synthetic data for training and evaluating models. However, it is unclear whether they can generate a good quality of question answering (QA) dataset that incorporates knowledge and cultural nuance embedded in a language, especially for low-resource languages. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of using LLMs in generating culturally relevant commonsense QA datasets for Indonesian and Sundanese languages. To do so, we create datasets for these languages using various methods involving both LLMs and human annotators, resulting in 4.5K questions per language (9K in total), making our dataset the largest of its kind. Our experiments show that automatic data adaptation from an existing English dataset is less effective for Sundanese. Interestingly, using the direct generation method on the target language, GPT-4 Turbo can generate questions with adequate general knowledge in both languages, albeit not as... | Rifki Afina Putri, Faiz Ghifari Haznitrama, Dea Adhista, Alice Oh |  |

Recent language models still have much room for improvement in their data efficiency compared to humans. This paper investigates whether language models efficiently use indirect data (indirect evidence), from which they infer sentence acceptability. In contrast, humans use indirect evidence efficiently, which is considered one of the inductive biases contributing to efficient language acquisition. To explore this question, we introduce the Wug InDirect Evidence Test (WIDET), a dataset consisting of training instances inserted into the pre-training data and evaluation instances. We inject synthetic instances with newly coined wug words into pretraining data and explore the model’s behavior on evaluation data that assesses grammatical acceptability regarding those words. We prepare the injected instances by varying their levels of indirectness and quantity.... | Miyu Oba, Yohei Oseki, Akiyo Fukatsu, Akari Haga, Hiroki Ouchi, Taro Watanabe, Saku Sugawara |  |

In this paper, we study another important yet underexplored problem, i.e., will LLMs respect copyright information in user input, and behave accordingly? The research problem is critical, as a negative answer would imply that LLMs will become the primary facilitator and accelerator of copyright infringement behavior. We conducted a series of experiments using a diverse set of language models, user prompts, and copyrighted materials, including books, news articles, API documentation, and movie scripts. Our study offers a conservative evaluation of the extent to which language models may infringe upon copyrights when processing user input containing protected material. This research emphasizes the need for further investigation and the importance of ensuring LLMs respect copyright regulations when handling user input to prevent unauthorized use or reproduction of protected content.

Multi-Draft Speculative Decoding (MDSD) offers a promising solution by using a smaller draft model to generate multiple token sequences, which the target LLM verifies in parallel.However, current heuristic approaches, such as Recursive Rejection Sampling (RRS), suffer from low acceptance rates in subsequent drafts, limiting the advantages of using multiple drafts. Meanwhile, Optimal Transport with Membership Cost (OTM) can theoretically improve acceptance rates, but its computational cost is too high for real-time use.We present SpecHub, a novel, efficient sampling-verification method for MDSD that improves acceptance rates with only linear computational overhead. By simplifying the OTM problem into a compact Linear Programming model, SpecHub significantly reduces computational complexity.

However, automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems frequently produce inaccurate transcriptions, leading to noisy inputs for SLU models, which can significantly degrade their performance. To address this, our objective is to train SLU models to withstand ASR errors by exposing them to noises commonly observed in ASR systems, referred to as ASR-plausible noises. Speech noise injection (SNI) methods have pursued this objective by introducing ASR-plausible noises, but we argue that these methods are inherently biased towards specific ASR systems, or ASR-specific noises. In this work, we propose a novel and less biased augmentation method of introducing the noises that are plausible to any ASR system, by cutting off the non-causal effect of noises. Experimental results and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods in enhancing the robustness and... | YeonJoon Jung, Jaeseong Lee, Seungtaek Choi, Dohyeon Lee, Minsoo Kim, Seungwon Hwang |  |

However, achieving reliable training through that proxy reward model (RM) is not a trivial problem, and its behavior remained as a black-box. In this paper, we study the role of proxy rewards in the LLM alignment via ‘reverse reward engineering’ by composing interpretable features as a white-box reward function. We aim to replicate the ground truth (gold) reward signal by achieving a monotonic relationship between the proxy and gold reward signals after training the model using the proxy reward in reinforcement learning (RL). Our findings indicate that successfully emulating the gold reward requires generating responses that are relevant with enough length to open-ended questions, while also ensuring response consistency in closed-ended questions. Furthermore, resulting models optimizing our devised white-box reward show competitive performances with strong... | Sungdong Kim, Minjoon Seo |  |

The proposed VisTEL module harnesses a state-of-the-art visual text recognition engine and the power of a large multimodal model to jointly reason using textual and visual context obtained using surrounding cues in the image to link visual text entity to the correct knowledge base entity. (ii) We present KaLMA – knowledge-aware large multimodal assistant that augments an LMM with knowledge associated with visual text entity in the image to arrive at an accurate answer. Further, we provide a comprehensive experimental analysis and comparison of our approach with traditional visual question answering, pre-large multimodal models, and large multimodal models, as well as prior top-performing approaches.... | Abhirama Subramanyam Penamakuri, Anand Mishra |  |

Recently, researchers have employed MT metrics for various new use cases, such as data filtering and translation re-ranking. However, most MT metrics return assessments as scalar scores that are difficult to interpret, posing a challenge to making informed design choices. Moreover, MT metrics’ capabilities have historically been evaluated using correlation with human judgment, which, despite its efficacy, falls short of providing intuitive insights into metric performance, especially in terms of new metric use cases. To address these issues, we introduce an interpretable evaluation framework for MT metrics. Within this framework, we evaluate metrics in two scenarios that serve as proxies for the data filtering and translation re-ranking use cases. Furthermore, by measuring the performance of MT metrics using Precision, Recall, and F-score, we offer clearer insights into their capabilities than... | Stefano Perrella, Lorenzo Proietti, PereLluís Huguet Cabot, Edoardo Barba, Roberto Navigli |  |

However, existing text-only training methods often overlook the modality gap between using text data during training and employing images during inference. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called Image-like Retrieval, which aligns text features with visually relevant features to mitigate the modality gap. Our method further enhances the accuracy of generated captions by designing a fusion module that integrates retrieved captions with input features. Additionally, we introduce a Frequency-based Entity Filtering technique that significantly improves caption quality. We integrate these methods into a unified framework, which we refer to as IFCap (\*\*I\*\*mage-like Retrieval and \*\*F\*\*requency-based Entity Filtering for Zero-shot \*\*Cap\*\*tioning).

In response, we introduce SheetEncoder, pioneering an efficient encoding method designed to unleash and optimize LLMs’ powerful understanding and reasoning capability on spreadsheets. Initially, we propose a vanilla serialization approach that incorporates cell addresses, values, and formats. However, this approach was limited by LLMs’ token constraints, making it impractical for most applications. To tackle this challenge, three innovative modules are proposed to compress spreadsheets effectively: structural-anchor-based compression, inverse index translation, and data-format-aware aggregation. It significantly improves performance in spreadsheet table detection task, outperforming the vanilla approach by 25.6% in GPT4’s in-context learning setting. Moreover, fine-tuned LLM with SheetEncoder has... | Haoyu Dong, Jianbo Zhao, Yuzhang Tian, Junyu Xiong, Mengyu Zhou, Yun Lin, José Cambronero, Yeye He, Shi Han, Dongmei Zhang |  |

Quality Dimensions and Annotated Datasets for Computational Argument Quality Assessment](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.1155) |  | 0 | Research in the computational assessment of Argumentation Quality has gained popularity over the last ten years. Various quality dimensions have been explored through the creation of domain-specific datasets and assessment methods. We survey the related literature (211 publications and 32 datasets), while addressing potential overlaps and blurry boundaries to related domains. This paper provides a representative overview of the state of the art in Computational Argument Quality Assessment with a focus on quality dimensions and annotated datasets. The aim of the survey is to identify research gaps and to aid future discussions and work in the domain. | Rositsa V. Ivanova, Thomas Huber, Christina Niklaus |  |

The need for sentence segmentation is particularly pronounced in clinical notes, where ungrammatical and fragmented texts are common. We propose a straightforward and effective sequence labeling classifier to predict sentence spans using a dynamic sliding window based on the prediction of each input sequence. This sliding window algorithm allows our approach to segment long text sequences on the fly. To evaluate our approach, we annotated 90 clinical notes from the MIMIC-III dataset. Additionally, we tested our approach on five other datasets to assess its generalizability and compared its performance against state-of-the-art systems on these datasets. Our approach outperformed all the systems, achieving an F1 score that is 15% higher than the next best-performing system on the clinical dataset. | Dongfang Xu, Davy Weissenbacher, Karen O'Connor, Siddharth Rawal, Graciela GonzalezHernandez |  |

This property is considered to be the hallmark of human language as it enables the ability to express novel concepts and ease of learning. As such, numerous studies in the emergent communication field explore the prerequisite conditions for emergence of compositionality. Most of these studies set out one-to-one communication environment wherein a speaker interacts with a single listener during a single round of communication game. However, real-world communications often involve multiple listeners; their interests may vary and they may even need to coordinate among themselves to be successful at a given task. This work investigates the effects of one-to-many communication environment on emergent languages where a single speaker broadcasts its message to multiple listeners to cooperatively solve a task. We observe that simply broadcasting the speaker’s message to multiple listeners... | Heeyoung Lee |  |

Despite such convenience, the performance of ICL heavily depends on the quality of the in-context examples presented, which makes the in-context example selection approach a critical choice. This paper proposes a novel eBayesian in-Context example Selection method (ByCS) for ICL. Extending the inference probability conditioned on in-context examples based on Bayes’ theorem, ByCS focuses on the inverse inference conditioned on test input. Following the assumption that accurate inverse inference probability (likelihood) will result in accurate inference probability (posterior), in-context examples are selected based on their inverse inference results. Diverse and extensive cross-tasking and cross-modality experiments are performed with speech, text, and image examples. Experimental results show the efficacy and... | Siyin Wang, ChaoHan Huck Yang, Ji Wu, Chao Zhang |  |

In that spirit, we are the first to conduct an extensive study of the performance of multilingual models instruction-tuned on different language compositions on parallel instruction-tuning benchmarks across a selection of the most spoken Indo-European languages. We systematically examine the effects of language and instruction dataset size on a mid-sized and a large, multilingual LLMs by instruction-tuning them on parallel instruction-tuning datasets. Our results demonstrate that instruction-tuning on parallel instead of monolingual corpora benefits cross-lingual instruction following capabilities by up to 9.9%. Furthermore, we show that the Superficial Alignment Hypothesis does not hold in general, as the investigated multilingual 7B parameter model presents a counter-example requiring large-scale instruction-tuning datasets.... | Alexander Arno Weber, Klaudia Thellmann, Jan Ebert, Nicolas FloresHerr, Jens Lehmann, Michael Fromm, Mehdi Ali |  |

Existing logical reasoning evaluation benchmarks often focus primarily on simplistic single-step or multi-step reasoning with a limited set of inference rules. Furthermore, the lack of datasets for evaluating non-monotonic reasoning represents a crucial gap since it aligns more closely with human-like reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-LogiEval, a comprehensive evaluation dataset encompassing multi-step logical reasoning with various inference rules and depths. Multi-LogiEval covers three logic types — propositional, first-order, and non-monotonic consisting of more than 30 inference rules and more than 60 of their combinations with various depths. Leveraging this dataset, we conduct evaluations on a range of LLMs such as GPT-4, ChatGPT, Gemini-Pro, Orca,... | Nisarg Patel, Mohith Kulkarni, Mihir Parmar, Aashna Budhiraja, Mutsumi Nakamura, Neeraj Varshney, Chitta Baral |  |

Previous research has leveraged this phenomenon to improve factual accuracy through self-contrast, penalizing early-exit predictions based on the premise that later-layer updates are more factually reliable than earlier-layer associations. We observe a similar pattern for fine-grained emotion classification in text, demonstrating that self-contrast can enhance encoder-based text classifiers. Additionally, we reinterpret self-contrast as a form of linear extrapolation, which motivates a refined approach that dynamically adjusts the contrastive strength based on the selected intermediate layer. Experiments across multiple models and emotion classification datasets show that our method outperforms standard classification techniques in fine-grained emotion classification tasks. | Mayukh Sharma, Sean O'Brien, Julian J.

To achieve better performance on specialized domains such as law and advertisement, LLMs are often continue pre-trained on in-domain data. However, existing approaches suffer from two major issues. First, in-domain data are scarce compared with general domain-agnostic data. Second, data used for continual pre-training are not task-aware, such that they may not be helpful to downstream applications. We propose TRAIT, a task-oriented in-domain data augmentation framework. Our framework is divided into two parts: in-domain data selection and task-oriented synthetic passage generation. The data selection strategy identifies and selects a large amount of in-domain data from general corpora, and thus significantly enriches domain knowledge in the continual pre-training data. The synthetic passages contain guidance on how to use domain knowledge to answer questions about downstream tasks.

We introduce SciDQA, a new dataset for reading comprehension that challenges language models to deeply understand scientific articles, consisting of 2,937 QA pairs. Unlike other scientific QA datasets, SciDQA sources questions from peer reviews by domain experts and answers by paper authors, ensuring a thorough examination of the literature. We enhance the dataset’s quality through a process that carefully decontextualizes the content, tracks the source document across different versions, and incorporates a bibliography for multi-document question-answering. Questions in SciDQA necessitate reasoning across figures, tables, equations, appendices, and supplementary materials, and require multi-document reasoning. We evaluate several open-source and proprietary LLMs across various configurations to explore their capabilities in generating relevant and... | Shruti Singh, Nandan Sarkar, Arman Cohan |  |

The continued success of vanilla Transformers and their variants suggests an undoubted “yes”. In this work, however, we attempt to break the depth-ordered convention by proposing a novel architecture dubbed mixture-of-modules (MoM), which is motivated by an intuition that any layer, regardless of its position, can be used to compute a token as long as it possesses the needed processing capabilities. The construction of MoM starts from a finite set of modules defined by multi-head attention and feed-forward networks, each distinguished by its unique parameterization. Two routers then iteratively select attention modules and feed-forward modules from the set to process a token. The selection dynamically expands the computation graph in the forward pass of the token, culminating in an assembly of modules. We show that MoM provides not only a unified framework for Transformers and their numerous variants... | Zhuocheng Gong, Ang Lv, Jian Guan, Wei Wu, Huishuai Zhang, Minlie Huang, Dongyan Zhao, Rui Yan |  |

COCO captions focused on unambiguous facts in English; ArtEmis introduced subjective emotions and ArtELingo introduced some multilinguality (Chinese and Arabic). However we believe there should be more multilinguality. Hence, we present ArtELingo-28, a vision-language benchmark that spans 28 languages and encompasses approximately 200,000 annotations (140 annotations per image). Traditionally, vision research focused on unambiguous class labels, whereas ArtELingo-28 emphasizes diversity of opinions over languages and cultures. The challenge is to build machine learning systems that assign emotional captions to images. Baseline results will be presented for three novel conditions: Zero-Shot, Few-Shot and One-vs-All Zero-Shot. We find that cross-lingual transfer is more successful for culturally-related languages. Data and code will be made publicly available. | Youssef Mohamed, Runjia Li, Ibrahim Said Ahmad, Kilichbek Haydarov, Philip Torr, Kenneth Church, Mohamed Elhoseiny |  |

Previous research has presented methods to generalize models through data integration or augmentation, but overcoming the differences in labeling criteria between datasets remains a limitation. To address these challenges, we propose PREDICT, a novel framework that uses the notion of multi-agent for hate speech detection. PREDICT consists of two phases: (1) PRE (Perspective-based REasoning): Multiple agents are created based on the induced labeling criteria of given datasets, and each agent generates stances and reasons; (2) DICT (Debate using InCongruenT references): Agents representing hate and non-hate stances conduct the debate, and a judge agent classifies hate or non-hate and provides a balanced reason.

Our paper introduces TokenVerse, a single Transducer-based model designed to handle multiple tasks. This is achieved by integrating task-specific tokens into the reference text during ASR model training, streamlining the inference and eliminating the need for separate NLP models. In addition to ASR, we conduct experiments on 3 different tasks: speaker change detection, endpointing, and NER. Our experiments on a public and a private dataset show that the proposed method improves ASR by up to 7.7% in relative WER while outperforming the cascaded pipeline approach in individual task performance.

Despite the advancements, current strategies for memory-efficient finetuning, such as QLoRA, exhibit inconsistent performance across diverse bit-width quantizations and multifaceted tasks. This inconsistency largely stems from the detrimental impact of the quantization process on preserved knowledge, leading to catastrophic forgetting and undermining the utilization of pretrained models for finetuning purposes. In this work, we introduce a novel quantization framework named ApiQ, designed to restore the lost information from quantization by concurrently initializing the LoRA components and quantizing the weights of LLMs. This approach ensures the maintenance of the original LLM’s activation precision while mitigating the... | Baohao Liao, Christian Herold, Shahram Khadivi, Christof Monz |  |

However, efficiently handling long sequences remains challenging, particularly during the prefilling stage when input lengths exceed GPU memory capacity. Traditional methods often segment sequence into chunks and compress them iteratively with fixed-size memory. However, our empirical analysis shows that the fixed-size memory results in wasted computational and GPU memory resources. Therefore, we introduces Incremental Memory (IM), a method that starts with a small memory size and gradually increases it, optimizing computational efficiency. Additionally, we propose Decremental Chunk based on Incremental Memory (IMDC), which reduces chunk size while increasing memory size, ensuring stable and lower GPU memory usage. Our experiments demonstrate that IMDC is consistently faster (1.45x) and reduces GPU memory... | Zhiyuan Zeng, Qipeng Guo, Xiaoran Liu, Zhangyue Yin, Wentao Shu, Mianqiu Huang, Bo Wang, Yunhua Zhou, Linlin Li, Qun Liu, Xipeng Qiu |  |

Morphology and word order are closely linked, with the latter incorporated into transformer-based models through positional encodings. This prompts a fundamental inquiry: Is there a correlation between the morphological complexity of a language and the utilization of positional encoding in pre-trained language models? In pursuit of an answer, we present the first study addressing this question, encompassing 22 languages and 5 downstream tasks. Our findings reveal that the importance of positional encoding diminishes with increasing morphological complexity in languages. Our study motivates the need for a deeper understanding of positional encoding, augmenting them to better reflect the different languages under consideration. | Poulami Ghosh, Shikhar Vashishth, Raj Dabre, Pushpak Bhattacharyya |  |

This shortcoming hinders their utility in applications where understanding nuanced differences in opinion is essential, such as those related to social and political discourse analysis. This paper addresses this issue by fine-tuning sentence transformers with arguments for and against human-generated controversial claims. We demonstrate how our fine-tuned model enhances the utility of sentence transformers for social computing tasks such as opinion mining and stance detection. We elaborate that applying stance-aware sentence transformers to opinion mining is a more computationally efficient and robust approach in comparison to the classic classification-based approaches. | Vahid Ghafouri, Jose Such, Guillermo SuarezTangil |  |

However, due to the nature of the datasets, systems develop an unintended bias due to the over-generalization of the model to the training data. This compromises the fairness of the systems, which can impact certain groups due to their race, gender, etc.Existing methods mitigate bias using data augmentation, adversarial learning, etc., which require re-training and adding extra parameters to the model.In this work, we present a robust and generalizable technique BiasWipe to mitigate unintended bias in language models. BiasWipe utilizes model interpretability using Shapley values, which achieve fairness by pruning the neuron weights responsible for unintended bias. It first identifies the neuron weights responsible for unintended bias and then achieves fairness by pruning them without loss of original performance.

Identification of such misleading and persuasive multimodal content become more important among various stakeholders, including social media platforms, policymakers, and the broader society as they often cause harm to the individuals, organizations and/or society. While there has been effort to develop AI based automatic system for resource rich languages (e.g., English), it is relatively little to none for medium to low resource languages. In this study, we focused on developing an Arabic memes dataset with manual annotations of propagandistic content. We annotated ∼6K Arabic memes collected from various social media platforms, which is a first resource for Arabic multimodal research.

The central aim is to generate the missing reasoning link between a message and the implied meanings encoding the misogyny. Our study uses argumentation theory as a foundation to form a collection of prompts in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. These prompts integrate different techniques, including chain-of-thought reasoning and augmented knowledge. Our findings show that LLMs fall short on reasoning capabilities about misogynistic comments and that they mostly rely on their implicit knowledge derived from internalized common stereotypes about women to generate implied assumptions, rather than on inductive reasoning. | Arianna Muti, Federico Ruggeri, Khalid AlKhatib, Alberto BarrónCedeño, Tommaso Caselli |  |

Current methods, such as chain-of-thought reasoning and tree-search policy learning techniques, either neglect plan rationality or require extensive human simulation procedures. Addressing this, we propose a novel two-stage framework, named EnPL, to improve the LLMs’ capability in planning conversations towards designated targets, including (1) distilling natural language plans from target-driven conversation corpus and (2) generating new plans with demonstration-guided in-context learning. Specifically, we first propose a filter approach to distill a high-quality plan dataset, ConvPlan (Resources of this paper can be found at https://github.com/pandazzh2020/ConvPlan). With the aid of corresponding conversational data and support from relevant knowledge bases, we validate the quality and rationality of these plans.

However, a thorough data ablation study exploring large sets of candidate data mixtures is typically prohibitively expensive since the full effect is seen only after training the models; this can lead practitioners to settle for sub-optimal data mixtures. We propose an efficient method for approximating data ablations which trains individual models on subsets of a training corpus and reuses them across evaluations of combinations of subsets.In continued pre-training experiments, we find that, given an arbitrary evaluation set, the perplexity score of a single model trained on a candidate set of data is strongly correlated with perplexity scores of parameter averages of models trained on distinct partitions of that data. From this finding, we posit that researchers and practitioners can conduct inexpensive simulations of data ablations by maintaining a pool of models that... | Clara Na, Ian Magnusson, Ananya Harsh Jha, Tom Sherborne, Emma Strubell, Jesse Dodge, Pradeep Dasigi |  |

However, fine-tuning on full parameters solely is inefficient potentially leading to negative interactions among languages. In this work, we demonstrate that the fine-tuning for a language occurs in its intrinsic language-specific subspace with a tiny fraction of entire parameters. Thus, we propose language-specific LoRA to isolate intrinsic language-specific subspaces. Furthermore, we propose architecture learning techniques and introduce a gradual pruning schedule during fine-tuning to exhaustively explore the optimal setting and the minimal intrinsic subspaces for each language, resulting in a lightweight yet effective fine-tuning procedure. The experimental results on a 12-language subset and a 30-language subset of FLORES-101 show that our methods not only outperform full-parameter fine-tuning up to 2.25 spBLEU scores but also reduce trainable parameters to 0.4% for high and... | Zhe Cao, Zhi Qu, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Taro Watanabe |  |

Previous works typically represent the graph using an external encoder, such as graph neural networks, and retrieve relevant triplets based on the similarity between single-vector representations of triplets and the dialog history. However, these external encoders fail to leverage the rich knowledge of pretrained language models, and the retrieval process is also suboptimal due to the information bottleneck caused by the single-vector abstraction of the dialog history. In this work, we propose Dialog generation with Generative Subgraph Retrieval (DialogGSR), which retrieves relevant knowledge subgraphs by directly generating their token sequences on top of language models. For effective generative subgraph retrieval, we introduce two key methods: (i) structure-aware knowledge graph linearization with self-supervised... | Jinyoung Park, Minseok Joo, JooKyung Kim, Hyunwoo J.

However, this adversarial training paradigm often leads to performance degradation on clean inputs and requires frequent re-training on the entire data to account for new, unknown attacks. To overcome these challenges while still harnessing the benefits of adversarial training and the efficiency of PEFT, this work proposes a novel approach, called AdpMixup, that combines two paradigms: (1) fine-tuning through adapters and (2) adversarial augmentation via mixup to dynamically leverage existing knowledge from a set of pre-known attacks for robust inference. Intuitively, AdpMixup fine-tunes PLMs with multiple adapters with both clean and pre-known adversarial examples and intelligently mixes them up in different... | Tuc Nguyen, Thai Le |  |

In clinical data management, the de-ID of Protected Health Information (PHI) is critical for patient confidentiality. However, state-of-the-art de-ID models show poor generalization on a new dataset. This is due to the difficulty of retaining training corpora. Additionally, labeling standards and the formats of patient records vary across different institutions. Our study addresses these issues by exploiting GPT-4 for data augmentation through one-shot and zero-shot prompts. Our approach effectively circumvents the problem of PHI leakage, ensuring privacy by redacting PHI before processing. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposal, we conduct cross-dataset testing. The experimental result demonstrates significant improvements across three types of F1 scores. | Woojin Kim, Sungeun Hahm, Jaejin Lee |  |

We collect438 Connections games to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) against expert and novice humanplayers. Our results show that even the best-performing LLM, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which has otherwise shown impressive reasoning abilities on a wide variety of benchmarks, can only fully solve 18% of the games. Novice and expert players perform better than Claude 3.5 Sonnet, with expert human players significantly outperforming it. We create a taxonomy of the knowledge types required to successfully cluster and categorize words in the Connections game. We find that while LLMs are decent at categorizing words based on semantic relations they struggle with other types of knowledge such as Encyclopedic Knowledge, Multiword Expressions or knowledge that combines both Word Form and Meaning. Our results establish the New York Times Connections... | Prisha Samadarshi, Mariam Mustafa, Anushka Kulkarni, Raven Rothkopf, Tuhin Chakrabarty, Smaranda Muresan |  |

While initial research focused on English, single-language models can be advantageous compared to multilingual ones in terms of pre-training effort, overall resource efficiency or downstream task performance. Despite the growing popularity of prompt-based LLMs, more compute-efficient BERT-like models remain highly relevant. In this work, we present the first German single-language RoBERTa model, GottBERT, pre-trained exclusively on the German portion of the OSCAR dataset. Additionally, we investigated the impact of filtering the OSCAR corpus. GottBERT was pre-trained using fairseq and standard hyperparameters. We evaluated its performance on two Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks (Conll 2003 and GermEval 2014) and three text classification tasks (GermEval 2018 fine and coarse, and 10kGNAD) against existing German BERT... | Raphael Scheible, Johann Frei, Fabian Thomczyk, Henry He, Patric Tippmann, Jochen Knaus, Victor Jaravine, Frank Kramer, Martin Boeker |  |

In this work, we investigate selective annotation for ICL, where there is a limited budget for annotating examples, similar to low-budget active learning (AL). Although uncertainty-based selection is unreliable with few annotated data, we present CoverICL, an adaptive graph-based selection algorithm, that effectively incorporates uncertainty sampling into selective annotation for ICL. First, CoverICL builds a nearest-neighbor graph based on the semantic similarity between candidate ICL examples. Then, CoverICL employs uncertainty estimation by the LLM to identify hard examples for the task. Selective annotation is performed over the active graph of the hard examples, adapting the process to the particular LLM used and the task tackled. CoverICL selects the most representative examples by solving a Maximum Coverage problem,... | Costas Mavromatis, Balasubramaniam Srinivasan, Zhengyuan Shen, Jiani Zhang, Huzefa Rangwala, Christos Faloutsos, George Karypis |  |

Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLM) have shown promising results in high-resource domains but fall short in low-resource concepts that are under-represented (e.g. only a handful of images per category) in the pre-training set. We tackle the challenging task of zero-shot low-resource image classification from a novel perspective. By leveraging a retrieval-based strategy, we achieve this in a training-free fashion. Specifically, our method, named CoRE (Combination of Retrieval Enrichment), enriches the representation of both query images and class prototypes by retrieving relevant textual information from large web-crawled databases. This retrieval-based enrichment significantly boosts classification performance by incorporating the broader contextual information relevant to... | Nicola Dall'Asen, Yiming Wang, Enrico Fini, Elisa Ricci |  |

Recent advances mainly focus on style or scene transfer based on given keywords. However, in e-commerce and recommender systems, it is almost an untouched area to explore user historical interactions, automatically mine user interests with semantic associations, and create item representations that closely align with user individual interests.In this paper, we propose a brand new framework called \*\*I\*\*nterest-\*\*A\*\*ugmented \*\*M\*\*ultimodal \*\*G\*\*enerator (\*\*I-AM-G\*\*). The framework first extracts tags from the multimodal information of items that the user has interacted with, and the most frequently occurred ones are extracted to rewrite the text description of the item. Then, the framework uses a decoupled text-to-text and image-to-image retriever to search for the top-K similar item text and image embeddings from the item pool.

However, this broad language coverage hides performance gaps within languages, for example, across genders. Our study systematically evaluates the performance of two widely used multilingual ASR models on three datasets, encompassing 19 languages from eight language families and two speaking conditions. Our findings reveal clear gender disparities, with the advantaged group varying across languages and models. Surprisingly, those gaps are not explained by acoustic or lexical properties. However, probing internal model states reveals a correlation with gendered performance gap. That is, the easier it is to distinguish speaker gender in a language using probes, the more the gap reduces, favoring female speakers. Our results show that gender disparities persist even in state-of-the-art models. Our findings have implications for the improvement of... | Giuseppe Attanasio, Beatrice Savoldi, Dennis Fucci, Dirk Hovy |  |

Within the training pipeline of LLMs, the Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) phase is crucial for aligning LLMs with human preferences and values. Label smoothing, a technique that replaces hard labels with soft labels, emerges as promising techniques to enhance RLHF training. Despite the benefits, the choice of label smoothing parameters often relies on heuristic approaches and lack theoretical understanding. This paper addresses the challenge of selecting the label smoothing parameter in a principled manner. We introduce Confidence Aware Label Smoothing (CALS), a method that iteratively updates the label smoothing parameter based on preference labels and model forecasts. Our theoretical analysis characterizes the optimal label smoothing parameter, demonstrates its dependence on the confidence level, and reveals its influence on training dynamics and... | Baihe Huang, Hiteshi Sharma, Yi Mao |  |

The recently introduced direct alignment methods, which are often simpler, more stable, and computationally lighter, can more directly achieve this. However, these approaches cannot optimize arbitrary rewards, and the preference-based ones are not the only rewards of interest for LLMs (eg, unit tests for code generation or textual entailment for summarization, among others). RL-finetuning is usually done with a variation of policy gradient, which calls for on-policy or near-on-policy samples, requiring costly generations. We introduce \*Contrastive Policy Gradient\*, or CoPG, a simple and mathematically principled new RL algorithm that can estimate the optimal policy even from off-policy data. It can be seen as an off-policy policy gradient approach that does not rely on important sampling techniques and highlights... | Yannis FletBerliac, Nathan Grinsztajn, Florian Strub, Eugene Choi, Bill Wu, Chris Cremer, Arash Ahmadian, Yash Chandak, Mohammad Gheshlaghi Azar, Olivier Pietquin, Matthieu Geist |  |

However, existing works on plan-following language models (LMs) often are not capable of multimodal input and output. In this work, we present MM-PlanLLM, the first multimodal LLM designed to assist users in executing instructional tasks by leveraging both textual plans and visual information. Specifically, we bring cross-modality through two key tasks: Conversational Video Moment Retrieval, where the model retrieves relevant step-video segments based on user queries, and Visually-Informed Step Generation, where the model generates the next step in a plan, conditioned on an image of the user’s current progress. MM-PlanLLM is trained using a novel multitask-multistage approach, designed to gradually expose the model to multimodal instructional-plans semantic layers, achieving strong performance on both... | Diogo GlóriaSilva, David Semedo, João Magalhães |  |

Human dialogue, by contrast, is “full-duplex” allowing for rich synchronicity in the form of quick and dynamic turn-taking, overlapping speech, and backchanneling. Technically, the challenge of achieving full-duplex dialogue with LLMs lies in modeling synchrony as pre-trained LLMs do not have a sense of “time”. To bridge this gap, we propose Synchronous LLMs for full-duplex spoken dialogue modeling. We design a novel mechanism to integrate time information into Llama3-8b so that they run synchronously with the real-world clock. We also introduce a training recipe that uses 212k hours of synthetic spoken dialogue data generated from text dialogue data to create a model that generates meaningful and natural spoken dialogue, with just 2k... | Bandhav Veluri, Benjamin N.

However, agentic LLMs suffer from a phenomenon known as reasoning derailment, due to the indiscriminate incorporation of observations from partially observable environments. We introduce QuBE, a method that enhances agents’ focus on task-relevant contexts, by constructing a belief state via question answering. We validate QuBE through experiments in two agentic LLM scenarios with partial observability: 1) a canonical interactive decision-making scenario using text-based game engines, and 2) an interactive retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) scenario using search engines. In the AlfWorld text-based game, QuBE outperforms established baselines by substantial margins, and in the search engine scenario, it achieves marked improvements on the BeIR zero-shot retrieval benchmark. The results demonstrate that... | Minsoo Kim, Jongyoon Kim, Jihyuk Kim, Seungwon Hwang |  |

However, language models often face challenges when given extensive information, diminishing their effectiveness in solving questions. Context compression tackles this issue by filtering out irrelevant information, but current methods still struggle in realistic scenarios where crucial information cannot be captured with a single-step approach. To overcome this limitation, we introduce CompAct, a novel framework that employs an active strategy to condense extensive documents without losing key information. Our experiments demonstrate that CompAct brings significant improvements in both performance and compression rate on multi-hop question-answering benchmarks. CompAct flexibly operates as a cost-efficient plug-in module with various off-the-shelf retrievers or readers, achieving exceptionally high compression rates (47x). | Chanwoong Yoon, Taewhoo Lee, Hyeon Hwang, Minbyul Jeong, Jaewoo Kang |  |

However, their spatial reasoning capabilities are under-investigated. In this paper, we construct a novel VQA dataset, Spatial-MM, to comprehensively study LMMs’ spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities. Our analyses on object-relationship and multi-hop reasoning reveal several important findings. Firstly, bounding boxes and scene graphs, even synthetic ones, can significantly enhance LMMs’ spatial reasoning. Secondly, LMMs struggle more with questions posed from the human perspective than the camera perspective about the image. Thirdly, chain of thought (CoT) prompting does not improve model performance on complex multi-hop questions involving spatial relations. Moreover, spatial reasoning steps are much less accurate than non-spatial ones across MLLMs. Lastly, our perturbation analysis on GQA-spatial reveals that LMMs are much stronger at basic object detection than... | Fatemeh Shiri, XiaoYu Guo, Mona Far, Xin Yu, Reza Haf, YuanFang Li |  |

However, refining their capabilities on previously seen knowledge or integrating new knowledge from external sources remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a novel synthetic knowledge ingestion method called , which leverages fine-grained synthesis, interleaved generation, and assemble augmentation strategies to construct high-quality data representations from raw knowledge sources. We then integrate and its variations with three knowledge injection techniques: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT), and Continual Pre-training (CPT) to inject and refine knowledge in language models.

We introduce local contrastive editing that enables the localization and editing of a subset of weights in a target model in relation to a reference model. We deploy this approach to identify and modify subsets of weights that are associated with gender stereotypes in LMs. Through a series of experiments we demonstrate that local contrastive editing can precisely localize and control a small subset (< 0.5%) of weights that encode gender bias. Our work (i) advances our understanding of how stereotypical biases can manifest in the parameter space of LMs and (ii) opens up new avenues for developing parameter-efficient strategies for controlling model properties in a contrastive manner. | Marlene Lutz, Rochelle Choenni, Markus Strohmaier, Anne Lauscher |  |

In this paper, manual inspection of 5 datasets derived from IIT-CDIP uncovers the presence of thousands of instances of sensitive personal data, including US Social Security Numbers (SSNs), birth places and dates, and home addresses of individuals. The presence of such sensitive personal data in commonly-used and publicly available datasets is startling and has ethical and potentially legal implications; we believe such sensitive data ought to be removed from the internet. Thus, in this paper, we develop a modular data de-identification pipeline that replaces sensitive data with synthetic, but realistic, data. Via experiments, we demonstrate that this de-identification method preserves the utility of the de-identified documents so that they can continue be used in various document understanding applications. We will release redacted versions of these datasets... | Stefan Larson, Nicole Lima, Santiago Diaz, Amogh Manoj Joshi, Siddharth Betala, Jamiu Suleiman, Yash Mathur, Kaushal Prajapati, Ramla Alakraa, Junjie Shen, Temi Okotore, Kevin Leach |  |

Either examples or documentation are commonly used for improved code generation. We propose to use both types of information together and present retrieval augmented retrieval (RAR) as a two-step method for selecting relevant examples and documentation. Experiments on three low-resource languages (Power Query M, OfficeScript and Excel formulas) show that RAR outperforms independently example and grammar retrieval (+2.81–26.14%). Interestingly, we show that two-step retrieval selects better examples and documentation when used independently as well. | Avik Dutta, Mukul Singh, Gust Verbruggen, Sumit Gulwani, Vu Le |  |

Parameterised instructions also provide more detailed insights into model failures at no increased cost. Second, STAR improves signal quality by matching demographics to assess harms for specific groups, resulting in more sensitive annotations. STAR further employs a novel step of arbitration to leverage diverse viewpoints and improve label reliability, treating disagreement not as noise but as a valuable contribution to signal quality. | Laura Weidinger, John Mellor, Bernat Guillen Pegueroles, Nahema Marchal, Ravin Kumar, Kristian Lum, Canfer Akbulut, Mark Diaz, A.

However, fine-tuning often incurs high memory overhead, especially for large transformer-based models, such as LLMs. While existing methods may reduce certain parts of the memory required for fine-tuning, they still require caching all intermediate activations computed in the forward pass to update weights during the backward pass. In this work, we develop TokenTune, a method to reduce memory usage, specifically the memory to store intermediate activations, in the fine-tuning of transformer-based models. During the backward pass, TokenTune approximates the gradient computation by backpropagating through just a subset of input tokens. Thus, with TokenTune, only a subset of intermediate activations are cached during the forward pass. Also, TokenTune can be easily combined with existing methods like LoRA, further reducing the memory cost. We evaluate our approach on pre-trained... | Antoine Simoulin, Namyong Park, Xiaoyi Liu, Grey Yang |  |

Our study focuses on concreteness, a well-researched lexical-semantic variable, using it as a case study to examine the variability in visual representations. We rely on images associated with approximately 1,000 abstract and concrete concepts extracted from two different datasets: Bing and YFCC. Our goals are: (i) evaluate whether visual diversity in the depiction of concepts can reliably distinguish between concrete and abstract concepts; (ii) analyze the variability of visual features across multiple images of the same concept through a nearest neighbor analysis; and (iii) identify challenging factors contributing to this variability by categorizing and annotating images.

In this paper, we propose a framework for rigorously evaluating the capabilities of LLMs on time series understanding, encompassing both univariate and multivariate forms. We introduce a comprehensive taxonomy of time series features, a critical framework that delineates various characteristics inherent in time series data. Leveraging this taxonomy, we have systematically designed and synthesized a diverse dataset of time series, embodying the different outlined features, each accompanied by textual descriptions. This dataset acts as a solid foundation for assessing the proficiency of LLMs in comprehending time series.

Expressing Uncertainty Effectively in A Self-Training Manner](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.1205) |  | 0 | Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit excessive, random, and uninformative uncertainty, rendering them unsuitable for decision-making in human-computer interactions. In this paper, we aim to instigate a heightened awareness of self-uncertainty in LLMs, enabling them to express uncertainty more effectively. To accomplish this, we propose an uncertainty-aware instruction tuning (UaIT) method, aligning LLMs’ perception with the probabilistic uncertainty of the generation. We conducted experiments using LLaMA2 and Mistral on multiple free-form QA tasks. Experimental results revealed a surprising 45.2% improvement in the effectiveness of uncertainty expression by LLMs, accompanied by reasonably good out-of-domain generalization capabilities. Moreover, this uncertainty expression can serve as a valuable real-time basis for human decision-making, e.g., retrieving external documents and incorporating stronger LLMs. | Shudong Liu, Zhaocong Li, Xuebo Liu, Runzhe Zhan, Derek F.

The process of data sampling is crucial, as it significantly influences the success of policy improvement. Repeated random sampling is a widely used method that independently queries the model multiple times to generate outputs. In this work, we propose a more effective sampling method, named Preference-Guided Reflective Sampling (PRS). Unlike random sampling, PRS employs a tree-based generation framework to enable more efficient sampling. It leverages adaptive self-refinement techniques to better explore the sampling space. By specifying user preferences in natural language, PRS can further optimize response generation according to these preferences. As a result, PRS can align models to diverse user preferences. Our experiments demonstrate that PRS generates higher-quality responses with significantly higher rewards. On AlpacaEval and Arena-Hard, PRS substantially... | Hai Ye, Hwee Tou Ng |  |

Building on existing frameworks such as measurement modeling, we argue that actionability is a crucial aspect of bias measures that has been largely overlooked in the literature.We conduct a comprehensive review of 146 papers proposing bias measures in NLP, examining whether and how they provide the information required for actionable results. Our findings reveal that many key elements of actionability, including a measure’s intended use and reliability assessment, are often unclear or entirely absent.This study highlights a significant gap in the current approach to developing and reporting bias measures in NLP. We argue that this lack of clarity may impede the effective implementation and utilization of these measures.

The Misleading Success of Simulating Social Interactions With LLMs](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.1208) |  | 0 | Recent advances in large language models (LLM) have enabled richer social simulations, allowing for the study of various social phenomena. However, most recent work has used a more omniscient perspective on these simulations (e.g., single LLM to generate all interlocutors), which is fundamentally at odds with the non-omniscient, information asymmetric interactions that involve humans and AI agents in the real world. To examine these differences, we develop an evaluation framework to simulate social interactions with LLMs in various settings (omniscient, non-omniscient). Our experiments show that LLMs perform better in unrealistic, omniscient simulation settings but struggle in ones that more accurately reflect real-world conditions with information asymmetry. Moreover, we illustrate the limitations inherent in learning from omniscient simulations. Our findings indicate that addressing information asymmetry remains a fundamental challenge for LLM-based agents. | Xuhui Zhou, Zhe Su, Tiwalayo Eisape, Hyunwoo Kim, Maarten Sap |  |

Our method decomposes the short- and long-range modeling aspects of LVQA into two stages. First, we use a short-term visual captioner to generate textual descriptions of short video clips (0.5-8 seconds in length) densely sampled from a long input video. Afterward, an LLM aggregates the densely extracted short-term captions to answer a given question. Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-round summarization prompt that asks the LLM first to summarize the noisy short-term visual captions and then answer a given input question. To analyze what makes our simple framework so effective, we thoroughly evaluate various components of our framework. Our empirical analysis reveals that the choice of the visual captioner and LLM is critical for good LVQA performance. The proposed multi-round summarization prompt also leads to a significant LVQA performance boost.... | Ce Zhang, Taixi Lu, Md Mohaiminul Islam, Ziyang Wang, Shoubin Yu, Mohit Bansal, Gedas Bertasius |  |

Such edits have previously been called disabling edits. These disabling edits cause immediate model collapse and limits the use of ROME for sequential editing. In this paper, we show that disabling edits are an artifact of irregularities in the implementation of ROME. With this paper, we provide a more stable implementation ROME, which we call r-ROME and show that model collapse is no longer observed when making large scale sequential edits with r-ROME, while further improving generalization and locality of model editing compared to the original implementation of ROME. We also provide a detailed mathematical explanation of the reason behind disabling edits. | Akshat Gupta, Sidharth Baskaran, Gopala Anumanchipalli |  |

This situation only furthers an already wide technological divide, thereby hindering technological and socioeconomic inclusion. This challenge is largely due to the absence of datasets that can empower diverse speech systems. In this paper, we seek to mitigate this obstacle for a number of Arabic dialects by presenting Casablanca, a large-scale community-driven effort to collect and transcribe a multi-dialectal Arabic dataset. The dataset covers eight dialects: Algerian, Egyptian, Emirati, Jordanian, Mauritanian, Moroccan, Palestinian, and Yemeni, and includes annotations for transcription, gender, dialect, and code-switching. We also develop a number of strong baselines exploiting Casablanca.

Current alignment methods struggle with dynamic user intentions and complex objectives, making models vulnerable to generating harmful content. We propose Safety Arithmetic, a training-free framework enhancing LLM safety across different scenarios: Base models, Supervised fine-tuned models (SFT), and Edited models. Safety Arithmetic involves Harm Direction Removal to avoid harmful content and Safety Alignment to promote safe responses. Additionally, we present NoIntentEdit, a dataset highlighting edit instances that could compromise model safety if used unintentionally. Our experiments show that Safety Arithmetic significantly improves safety measures, reduces over-safety, and maintains model utility, outperforming existing methods in ensuring safe content generation. | Rima Hazra, Sayan Layek, Somnath Banerjee, Soujanya Poria |  |

Through studying this interaction, we hypothesize that matching levels of reasoning between communication partners would create a more beneficial environment for communicative success and language learning. Our research findings indicate that learning from more explicit, literal language is advantageous, irrespective of the learner’s level of pragmatic competence. Furthermore, we find that integrating pragmatic reasoning during language learning, not just during evaluation, significantly enhances overall communication performance. This paper provides key insights into the importance of aligning reasoning levels and incorporating pragmatic reasoning in optimizing communicative interactions. | Kata Naszádi, Frans A.

This generalization enhances the practicality of REC models for diverse real-world applications. However, the presence of varying numbers of targets in samples makes GREC a more complex task, both in terms of training supervision and final prediction selection strategy. Addressing these challenges, we introduce RECANTFormer, a one-stage method for GREC that combines a decoder-free (encoder-only) transformer architecture with DETR-like Hungarian matching. Our approach consistently outperforms baselines by significant margins in three GREC datasets. | Bhathiya Hemanthage, Hakan Bilen, Phil Bartie, Christian Dondrup, Oliver Lemon |  |

Our framework, Sprout, addresses these challenges by reducing the carbon footprint of inference in large language models (LLMs). Sprout introduces “generation directives” to guide the autoregressive generation process, achieving a balance between ecological sustainability and high-quality outputs. By employing a strategic optimizer for directive assignment and a novel offline quality evaluator, Sprout reduces the carbon footprint of generative LLM inference by over 40% in real-world evaluations, using the Llama model and global electricity grid data. This work is crucial as the rising interest in inference time compute scaling laws amplifies environmental concerns, emphasizing the need for eco-friendly AI solutions. | Baolin Li, Yankai Jiang, Vijay Gadepally, Devesh Tiwari |  |

Comparing Journalist Coverage of Press Releases with LLMs](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.1216) |  | 0 | Journalists engage in multiple steps in the news writing process that depend on human creativity, like exploring different “angles” (i.e. the specific perspectives a reporter takes). These can potentially be aided by large language models (LLMs). By affecting planning decisions, such interventions can have an outsize impact on creative output. We advocate a careful approach to evaluating these interventions to ensure alignment with human values.In a case study of journalistic coverage of press releases, we assemble a large dataset of 250k press releases and 650k articles covering them. We develop methods to identify news articles that _challenge and contextualize_ press releases. Finally, we evaluate suggestions made by LLMs for these articles and compare these with decisions made by human journalists. Our findings are three-fold: (1) Human-written news articles that challenge and contextualize press releases more take more creative angles and use more informational sources.

Major limitations include computational overhead, ineffective vocabulary use, and unnecessarily large embedding and head layers. Additionally, their performance is biased towards a reference corpus, leading to reduced effectiveness for underrepresented languages.To remedy these issues, we propose T-Free, which directly embeds words through sparse activation patterns over character triplets and does not require a reference corpus. T-Free inherently exploits morphological similarities and allows for strong compression of embedding layers. In our exhaustive experimental evaluation, we achieve competitive downstream performance with a parameter reduction of more than 85% on these layers. Further, T-Free shows significant improvements in cross-lingual transfer learning. | Björn Deiseroth, Manuel Brack, Patrick Schramowski, Kristian Kersting, Samuel Weinbach |  |

In this work, we formulate the task of quality estimation for speech translation (SpeechQE), construct a benchmark, and evaluate a family of systems based on cascaded and end-to-end architectures. In this process, we introduce a novel end-to-end system leveraging pre-trained text LLM. Results suggest that end-to-end approaches are better suited to estimating the quality of direct speech translation than using quality estimation systems designed for text in cascaded systems. More broadly, we argue that quality estimation of speech translation needs to be studied as a separate problem from that of text, and release our [data and models](https://github.com/h-j-han/SpeechQE) to guide further research in this space. | HyoJung Han, Kevin Duh, Marine Carpuat |  |

However, a significant gap remains in assessing to what extent LLM-powered applications genuinely enhance user experience and task execution efficiency. This highlights the need to verify utility of LLM-powered applications, particularly by ensuring alignment between the application’s functionality and end-user needs. We introduce AgentEval, a novel framework designed to simplify the utility verification process by automatically proposing a set of criteria tailored to the unique purpose of any given application. This allows for a comprehensive assessment, quantifying the utility of an application against the suggested criteria. We present a comprehensive analysis of the effectiveness and robustness of AgentEval for two open source datasets including Math Problem solving and ALFWorld House-hold related... | Negar Arabzadeh, Siqing Huo, Nikhil Mehta, Qingyun Wu, Chi Wang, Ahmed Awadallah, Charles L.

To address the challenge of achieving alignment without these extensive tuning costs and expensive annotations, we present a novel, tuning-free approach for self-alignment called Dynamic Rewarding with Prompt Optimization (DRPO). Our approach enables self-alignment through a search-based prompt optimization framework, allowing the model to self-improve and generate optimized prompts without additional training or human supervision. The core of DRPO leverages a dynamic rewarding mechanism to identify and rectify model-specific alignment weaknesses, enabling LLMs to adapt quickly to various alignment challenges. Empirical evaluations on eight recent LLMs, including both open- and closed-source, reveal that DRPO significantly enhances alignment performance, enabling base models to outperform their... | Somanshu Singla, Zhen Wang, Tianyang Liu, Abdullah Ashfaq, Zhiting Hu, Eric P.

We introduce three approaches to predict individual annotator ratings on the toxicity of text by incorporating individual annotator-specific information: a neural collaborative filtering (NCF) approach, an in-context learning (ICL) approach, and an intermediate embedding-based architecture. We also study the utility of demographic information for rating prediction. NCF showed limited utility; however, integrating annotator history, demographics, and survey information permits both the embedding-based architecture and ICL to substantially improve prediction accuracy, with the embedding-based architecture outperforming the other methods. We also find that, if demographics are predicted from survey information, using these imputed demographics as features performs comparably to using true demographic data. This suggests that demographics may not... | Harbani Jaggi, Kashyap Coimbatore Murali, Eve Fleisig, Erdem Biyik |  |

The challenge lies in the language marks for dementia are unclear, and LLM may struggle with relating its internal knowledge to dementia detection. In this paper, we present an accurate and interpretable classification approach by Adversarial Text Generation (ATG), a novel decoding strategy that could relate dementia detection with other tasks. We further develop a comprehensive set of instructions corresponding to various tasks and use them to guide ATG, achieving the best accuracy of 85%, >10% improvement compared to the regular prompting strategies. In addition, we introduce feature context, a human-understandable text that reveals the underlying features of LLM used for classifying dementia. From feature contexts, we found that dementia detection can be related to tasks such as... | Youxiang Zhu, Nana Lin, Kiran Balivada, Daniel Haehn, Xiaohui Liang |  |

To address this issue, we investigate whether the knowledge stored in these large encoders can be compressed while maintaining quality. We employ distillation, quantization, and pruning techniques to create efficient xCOMET alternatives and introduce a novel data collection pipeline for efficient black-box distillation. Our experiments show that, using quantization, xCOMET can be compressed up to three times with no quality degradation. Additionally, through distillation, we create an 278M-sized xCOMET-lite metric, which has only 2.6% of xCOMET-XXL parameters, but retains 92.1% of its quality. Besides, it surpasses strong small-scale metrics like COMET-22 and BLEURT-20 on the WMT22 metrics challenge dataset by 6.4%,... | Daniil Larionov, Mikhail Seleznyov, Vasiliy Viskov, Alexander Panchenko, Steffen Eger |  |

We introduce the Greatest Good Benchmark to evaluate the moral judgments of LLMs using utilitarian dilemmas. Our analysis across 15 diverse LLMs reveals consistently encoded moral preferences that diverge from established moral theories and lay population moral standards. Most LLMs have a marked preference for impartial beneficence and rejection of instrumental harm. These findings showcase the ‘artificial moral compass’ of LLMs, offering insights into their moral alignment. | Giovanni Marraffini, Andrés Cotton, Noe Hsueh, Axel Fridman, Juan Wisznia, Luciano Del Corro |  |

We present a new debiasing framework called FairFlow that mitigates dataset biases by learning to be undecided in its predictions for data samples or representations associated with known or unknown biases. The framework introduces two key components: a suite of data and model perturbation operations that generate different biased views of input samples, and a contrastive objective that learns debiased and robust representations from the resulting biased views of samples. Experiments show that FairFlow outperforms existing debiasing methods, particularly against out-of-domain and hard test samples without compromising the in-domain performance. | Jiali Cheng, Hadi Amiri |  |

We explore the linguistic style of the Manosphere, a misogynistic HSG, on Reddit. We find that Manospheric authors have a distinct linguistic style using not only uncivil language, but a greater focus on gendered topics, which are retained when posting in other communities. Thus, potentially harmful aspects of Manospheric style carry over into posts on non-Manospheric subreddits, motivating future work to explore how this stylistic spillover may negatively influence community health. | Jai Aggarwal, Suzanne Stevenson |  |

This paper explores prompt engineering, specifically focusing on the disparity between experimentally designed prompts and real-world “in-the-wild” prompts. We analyze 10,538 in-the-wild prompts collected from various platforms and develop a framework that decomposes the prompts into eight key components. Our analysis shows that and Requirement are the most prevalent two components. Roles specified in the prompts, along with their capabilities, have become increasingly varied over time, signifying a broader range of application scenarios for LLMs. However, from the response of GPT-4, there is a marginal improvement with a specified role, whereas leveraging less prevalent components such as Capability and Demonstration can result in a more satisfying response.

Despite the emerging advancements in interleaved generation, the progress in its evaluation still significantly lags behind. Existing evaluation benchmarks do not support arbitrarily interleaved images and text for both inputs and outputs, and they only cover a limited number of domains and use cases. Also, current works predominantly use similarity-based metrics which fall short in assessing the quality in open-ended scenarios. To this end, we introduce InterleavedBench, the first benchmark carefully curated for the evaluation of interleaved text-and-image generation. InterleavedBench features a rich array of tasks to cover diverse real-world use cases. In addition, we present InterleavedEval, a strong reference-free metric powered by GPT-4o to deliver accurate and explainable evaluation.

However, existing benchmarks are inadequate in measuring the complex logical reasoning capabilities of a model. We present FOLIO, a human-annotated, logically complex and diverse dataset for reasoning in natural language (NL), equipped with first-order logic (FOL) annotations. FOLIO consists of 1,430 examples (unique conclusions), each paired with one of 487 sets of premises used to deductively reason for the validity of each conclusion. The logical correctness of the premises and conclusions is ensured by their FOL annotations, which are automatically verified by an FOL inference engine.

However, their capability to handle highly specialized and open-ended tasks in domains like policy studies remains in question. This paper investigates the efficiency and accuracy of LLMs in specialized tasks through a structured user study focusing on Human-LLM partnership. The study, conducted in two stages—Topic Discovery and Topic Assignment—integrates LLMs with expert annotators to observe the impact of LLM suggestions on what is usually human-only analysis. Results indicate that LLM-generated topic lists have significant overlap with human generated topic lists, with minor hiccups in missing document-specific topics.

What are the features of the data they receive, and how do these features support language modeling objectives? To investigate this question, we train GPT-2 and RoBERTa models on 29M words of English child-directed speech and a new matched, synthetic dataset (TinyDialogues), comparing to OpenSubtitles, Wikipedia, and a heterogeneous blend of datasets from the BabyLM challenge. We evaluate the syntactic and semantic knowledge of these models using developmentally-inspired evaluations. Through pretraining experiments, we test whether the global developmental ordering or the local discourse ordering of children’s training data supports high performance relative to other datasets. The local properties of the data affect model results, but surprisingly, global properties do not. Further, child language input is not... | Steven Y. Feng, Noah D. Goodman, Michael Frank |  |

Data multiplexing addresses this by merging multiple inputs into a single composite input, allowing more efficient inference through a shared forward pass. However, as distinguishing individuals from a composite input is challenging, conventional methods typically require training the entire backbone, yet still suffer from performance degradation. In this paper, we introduce RevMUX, a parameter-efficient data multiplexing framework that incorporates a reversible design in the multiplexer, which can be reused by the demultiplexer to perform reverse operations and restore individual samples for classification. Extensive experiments on four datasets and three types of LLM backbones demonstrate the effectiveness of RevMUX for enhancing LLM inference efficiency while... | Yige Xu, Xu Guo, Zhiwei Zeng, Chunyan Miao |  |

Entailment graphs are crafted precisely for this purpose, focusing on learning entailment relations among predicates. Yet, prevailing approaches overlook the \*polysemy\* and \*hierarchical nature of concepts\* during entity conceptualization. This oversight disregards how arguments might entail differently across various concept levels, thereby missing potential entailment connections. To tackle this hurdle, we introduce the \*concept pyramid\* and propose the HiCon-EG (Hierarchical Conceptual Entailment Graph) framework, which organizes arguments hierarchically, delving into entailment relations at diverse concept levels. By learning entailment relationships at different concept levels, the model is guided to better understand concepts so as to improve its abstract inference capabilities. Our method enhances... | Juncai Li, Ru Li, Xiaoli Li, Qinghua Chai, Jeff Z. Pan |  |

These memes often target women with subtle and obscure cues, making their detection a challenging task for automated systems. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results in reasoning using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to generate the intermediate reasoning chains as the rationale to facilitate multimodal tasks, but often neglect cultural diversity and key aspects like emotion and contextual knowledge hidden in the visual modalities. To address this gap, we introduce a \*\*M\*\*ultimodal \*\*M\*\*ulti-hop CoT (M3Hop-CoT) framework for \*\*M\*\*isogynous meme identification, combining a CLIP-based classifier and a multimodal CoT module with entity-object-relationship integration.

In this paper, we introduce Iterative Refinement Induced Self-Jailbreak (IRIS), a novel approach that leverages the reflective capabilities of LLMs for jailbreaking with only black-box access. Unlike previous methods, IRIS simplifies the jailbreaking process by using a single model as both the attacker and target. This method first iteratively refines adversarial prompts through self-explanation, which is crucial for ensuring that even well-aligned LLMs obey adversarial instructions. IRIS then rates and enhances the output given the refined prompt to increase its harmfulness. We find that IRIS achieves jailbreak success rates of 98% on GPT-4, 92% on GPT-4 Turbo, and 94% on Llama-3.1-70B in under 7 queries.

However, the RAG framework suffers from performance degradation when the query is accompanied by irrelevant contexts. In this work, we propose the RE-RAG framework, which introduces a relevance estimator (RE) that not only provides relative relevance between contexts as previous rerankers did, but also provide confidence, which can be used to classify whether given context is useful for answering the given question. We propose a weakly supervised method for training the RE simply utilizing question-answer data without any labels for correct contexts. We show that RE trained with a small generator (sLM) can not only improve the sLM fine-tuned together with RE but also improve previously unreferenced large language models (LLMs). Furthermore, we investigate new decoding strategies... | Kiseung Kim, JayYoon Lee |  |

To enhance trust, it is imperative to gain a comprehensive understanding of the model’s failure modes and develop effective strategies to improve their performance. In this study, we introduce a methodology designed to examine how input perturbations affect language models across various scales, including pre-trained models and large language models (LLMs). Utilizing fine-tuning, we enhance the model’s robustness to input perturbations. Additionally, we investigate whether exposure to one perturbation enhances or diminishes the model’s performance with respect to other perturbations. To address robustness against multiple perturbations, we present three distinct fine-tuning strategies. Furthermore, we broaden the scope of our methodology to encompass large language models (LLMs) by leveraging a chain of thought (CoT) prompting... | Vatsal Gupta, Pranshu Pandya, Tushar Kataria, Vivek Gupta, Dan Roth |  |

In real interpreting situations, interpreters manage this simultaneity by breaking sentences into smaller segments and translating them while maintaining the source order as much as possible. SiST could benefit from this approach to balance quality and latency. However, current corpora used for simultaneous tasks often involve significant word reordering in translation, which is not ideal given that interpreters faithfully follow source syntax as much as possible. Inspired by conference interpreting by humans utilizing the salami technique, we introduce the Simul-MuST-C, a dataset created by leveraging the Large Language Model (LLM), specifically GPT-4o, which aligns the target text as closely as possible to the source text by using minimal chunks that contain enough information to be interpreted. Experiments on three language pairs... | Mana Makinae, Yusuke Sakai, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Taro Watanabe |  |

A Closer Look at the Evaluation of Table Generation from Text](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.1239) |  | 0 | Understanding whether a generated table is of good quality is important to be able to use it in creating or editing documents using automatic methods. In this work, we underline that existing measures for table quality evaluation fail to capture the overall semantics of the tables, and sometimes unfairly penalize good tables and reward bad ones. We propose TabEval, a novel table evaluation strategy that captures table semantics by first breaking down a table into a list of natural language atomic statements and then compares them with ground truth statements using entailment-based measures. To validate our approach, we curate a dataset comprising of text descriptions for 1,250 diverse Wikipedia tables, covering a range of topics and structures, in contrast to the limited scope of existing datasets. We compare TabEval with existing metrics using unsupervised and supervised text-to-table generation methods, demonstrating its stronger correlation with human judgments of table quality... | Pritika Ramu, Aparna Garimella, Sambaran Bandyopadhyay |  |

However, they lack “prerequisite checks”, i.e., there are no prescribed criteria to pick an AL algorithm best suited for a dataset. A practitioner must pick a technique they trust would beat random sampling, based on prior reported results, and hope that it is resilient to the many variables in their environment: dataset, labeling budget and prediction pipelines. The important questions then are: how often on average, do we expect any AL technique to reliably beat the computationally cheap and easy-to-implement strategy of random sampling? Does it at least make sense to use AL in an “Always ON” mode in a prediction pipeline, so that while it might not always help, it never under-performs random sampling? How much of a role does the prediction pipeline play in AL’s success?We examine these questions in detail for the task of text classification... | Abhishek Ghose, Emma Nguyen |  |

We present BMRetriever, a series of dense retrievers for enhancing biomedical retrieval via unsupervised pre-training on large biomedical corpora, followed by instruction fine-tuning on a combination of labeled datasets and synthetic pairs. Experiments on 5 biomedical tasks across 11 datasets verify BMRetriever’s efficacy on various biomedical applications. BMRetriever also exhibits strong parameter efficiency, with the 410M variant outperforming baselines up to 11.7 times larger, and the 2B variant matching the performance of models with over 5B parameters. The training data and model checkpoints are released at https://huggingface.co/BMRetriever to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and application to new domains. | Ran Xu, Wenqi Shi, Yue Yu, Yuchen Zhuang, Yanqiao Zhu, May Dongmei Wang, Joyce C.

However, relying on this small subset is often susceptible to error propagation from the bi-encoders, which limits the overall performance. To address these issues, we propose the Comparing Multiple Candidates (CMC) framework. CMC compares a query and multiple embeddings of similar candidates (i.e., neighbors) through shallow self-attention layers, delivering rich representations contextualized to each other. Furthermore, CMC is scalable enough to handle multiple comparisons simultaneously. For example, comparing ~10K candidates with CMC takes a similar amount of time as comparing 16 candidates with CE. Experimental results on the ZeSHEL dataset demonstrate that CMC, when plugged in between bi-encoders and cross-encoders as a seamless intermediate reranker (BE-CMC-CE),... | Jonghyun Song, Cheyon Jin, Wenlong Zhao, Andrew McCallum, JayYoon Lee |  |

Existing approaches make sample-level predictions but fail to identify the specific aspects of the claim that are troublesome and the specific evidence relied upon. In this paper, we introduce a method and new benchmark for this challenging task. Our method predicts the fine-grained logical relationship of each aspect of the claim from a set of multimodal documents, which include text, image(s), video(s), and audio(s). We also introduce a new benchmark (M3DC) of claims requiring multimodal multidocument reasoning, which we construct using a novel claim synthesis technique. Experiments show that our approach outperforms other models on this challenging task on two benchmarks while providing finer-grained predictions, explanations, and evidence. | ChiaWei Tang, TingChih Chen, Kiet Nguyen, Kazi Sajeed Mehrab, Alvi Md.

In this study, we propose MedAdapter, a unified post-hoc adapter for test-time adaptation of LLMs towards biomedical applications. Instead of fine-tuning the entire LLM, MedAdapter effectively adapts the original model by fine-tuning only a small BERT-sized adapter to rank candidate solutions generated by LLMs. Experiments on four biomedical tasks across eight datasets demonstrate that MedAdapter effectively adapts both white-box and black-box LLMs in biomedical reasoning, achieving average performance improvements of 18.24% and 10.96%, respectively, without requiring extensive computational resources or sharing data with third parties. MedAdapter also yields enhanced performance when combined with train-time adaptation, highlighting a flexible and complementary solution to existing... | Wenqi Shi, Ran Xu, Yuchen Zhuang, Yue Yu, Haotian Sun, Hang Wu, Carl Yang, May Dongmei Wang |  |

We propose EHRAgent, a large language model (LLM) agent empowered with accumulative domain knowledge and robust coding capability. EHRAgent enables autonomous code generation and execution to facilitate clinicians in directly interacting with EHRs using natural language. Specifically, we formulate a multi-tabular reasoning task based on EHRs as a tool-use planning process, efficiently decomposing a complex task into a sequence of manageable actions with external toolsets. We first inject relevant medical information to enable EHRAgent to effectively reason about the given query, identifying and extracting the required records from the appropriate tables. By integrating interactive coding and execution feedback, EHRAgent then effectively learns from error messages and iteratively improves its originally... | Wenqi Shi, Ran Xu, Yuchen Zhuang, Yue Yu, Jieyu Zhang, Hang Wu, Yuanda Zhu, Joyce C.

However, the proliferation of generated text raises concerns regarding its potential misuse in fraudulent activities such as academic dishonesty, spam dissemination, and misinformation propagation. Prior studies have detected the generation of non-analogous text, which manifests numerous differences between original and generated text. We have observed that the similarity between the original text and its generation is notably higher than that between the generated text and its subsequent regeneration. To address this, we propose a novel approach named SimLLM, aimed at estimating the similarity between an input sentence and its generated counterpart to detect analogous machine-generated sentences that closely mimic human-written ones. Our empirical analysis demonstrates SimLLM’s superior performance compared to existing methods. | HoangQuoc NguyenSon, MinhSon Dao, Koji Zettsu |  |

Despite recent advancements in large vision-language models (LVLMs), their ability to comprehend causality remains unclear. Previous work typically focuses on commonsense causality between events and/or actions, which is insufficient for applications like embodied agents and lacks the explicitly defined causal graphs required for formal causal reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a fine-grained and unified definition of causality involving interactions between humans and/or objects. Building on the definition, we construct a novel dataset, CELLO, consisting of 14,094 causal questions across all four levels of causality: discovery, association, intervention, and counterfactual. This dataset surpasses traditional commonsense causality by including explicit causal graphs that detail the interactions between humans and objects.

However, constructing such a corpus is challenging due to high costs, and limitations in annotator capabilities, and as a result, existing SI corpora are limited. Therefore, we propose a method to convert existing speech translation (ST) corpora into interpretation-style corpora, maintaining the original word order and preserving the entire source content using Large Language Models (LLM-SI-Corpus). We demonstrate that fine-tuning SiMT models using the LLM-SI-Corpus reduces latency while achieving better quality compared to models fine-tuned with other corpora in both speech-to-text and text-to-text settings. The LLM-SI-Corpus is available at https://github.com/yusuke1997/LLM-SI-Corpus. | Yusuke Sakai, Mana Makinae, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Taro Watanabe |  |

A popular approach is to learn a projection network that projects visual features into the input text embedding space of a PLM, as well as feed-forward adaptation layers, with the weights of the PLM frozen. However, is it really necessary to learn such additional layers? In this paper, we make the first attempt to demonstrate that the PLM is able to perform zero-shot crossmodal tasks without any crossmodal pretraining, when the observed visual concepts are injected as both additional input text tokens and augmentation in the intermediate features within each feed-forward network for the PLM. Specifically, inputting observed visual concepts as text tokens helps to inject them through the self-attention layers in the PLM; to augment the intermediate features in a way that is compatible with the PLM, we propose to construct adaptation... | Xudong Lin, Manling Li, Richard S.

However, most existing MLLMs and benchmarks primarily focus on single-image input scenarios, leaving the performance of MLLMs when handling realistic multiple images underexplored. Although a few benchmarks consider multiple images, their evaluation dimensions and samples are very limited. In this paper, we propose a new benchmark MIBench, to comprehensively evaluate fine-grained abilities of MLLMs in multi-image scenarios. Specifically, MIBench categorizes the multi-image abilities into three scenarios: multi-image instruction (MII), multimodal knowledge-seeking (MKS) and multimodal in-context learning (MIC), and constructs 13 tasks with a total of 13K annotated samples. During data construction, for MII and MKS, we extract correct options from manual annotations and create challenging distractors to obtain multiple-choice... | Haowei Liu, Xi Zhang, Haiyang Xu, Yaya Shi, Chaoya Jiang, Ming Yan, Ji Zhang, Fei Huang, Chunfeng Yuan, Bing Li, Weiming Hu |  |

As a consequence, recent approaches have equipped LLMs with mechanisms for knowledge retrieval, reasoning and introspection, not only to improve their capabilities but also to enhance the interpretability of their outputs. However, these methods require additional training, hand-crafted templates or human-written explanations. To address these issues, we introduce ZEBRA, a zero-shot question answering framework that combines retrieval, case-based reasoning and introspection and dispenses with the need for additional training of the LLM. Given an input question, ZEBRA retrieves relevant question-knowledge pairs from a knowledge base and generates new knowledge by reasoning over the relationships in these pairs. This generated knowledge is then used to answer the input question, improving the model’s... | Francesco Molfese, Simone Conia, Riccardo Orlando, Roberto Navigli |  |

With diverse needs and preferences, tailored assistance according to user personas is crucial. In this paper, we introduce ABLE (Adaptive, Bespoke, Listen and Empathetic), a Conversational Support System for Physical Disabilities. By tracking user personas, including gender, age, and personality traits based on the OCEAN model, ABLE ensures that support interactions are uniquely tailored to each user’s characteristics and preferences. Moreover, integrating politeness and empathy levels in responses enhances user satisfaction and engagement, fostering a supportive and respectful environment. The development of ABLE involves compiling a comprehensive conversational dataset enriched with user profile annotations. Leveraging reinforcement learning techniques and diverse reward mechanisms, ABLE trains a model to generate responses aligned with individual user... | Kshitij Mishra, Manisha Burja, Asif Ekbal |  |

Prior work has used LLMs to generate programming language and applied external compilers for such tasks. Yet, when on the fly, it is hard to generate an executable code with the correct logic for the solution. Even so, code for one instance cannot be reused for others, although they might require the same logic to solve. We present Think-and-Execute, a novel framework that improves LLMs’ algorithmic reasoning: (1) In Think, we discover task-level logic shared across all instances, and express such logic with pseudocode; (2) In Execute, we tailor the task-level pseudocode to each instance and simulate the execution of it. Think-and-Execute outperforms several strong baselines (including CoT and PoT) in diverse algorithmic reasoning tasks. We manifest the advantage of using task-level pseudocode over... | Hyungjoo Chae, Yeonghyeon Kim, Seungone Kim, Kai Tzuiunn Ong, Beongwoo Kwak, Moohyeon Kim, Sunghwan Kim, Taeyoon Kwon, Jiwan Chung, Youngjae Yu, Jinyoung Yeo |  |

Coffee-Gym includes two major components: (1) Coffee, a dataset containing humans’ code edit traces for coding questions and human-written feedback for editing erroneous code; (2) CoffeeEval, a reward function that faithfully reflects the helpfulness of feedback by assessing the performance of the revised code in unit tests. With them, Coffee-Gym addresses the unavailability of high-quality datasets for training feedback models with RL, and provides more accurate rewards than the SOTA reward model (i.e., GPT-4). By applying Coffee-Gym, we elicit feedback models that outperform baselines in enhancing open-source code LLMs’ code editing, making them comparable with closed-source LLMs. We make the dataset and the model checkpoint publicly available in https://huggingface.co/spaces/Coffee-Gym/Project-Coffee-Gym. | Hyungjoo Chae, Taeyoon Kwon, Seungjun Moon, Yongho Song, Dongjin Kang, Kai Tzuiunn Ong, Beongwoo Kwak, Seonghyeon Bae, Seungwon Hwang, Jinyoung Yeo |  |

Relying on a single ‘best’ prompt cannot capture all differing approaches to a generation problem. Using this observation, we propose multi-prompt decoding, where many candidate generations are decoded from a prompt bank at inference-time. To ensemble candidates, we use Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding, which selects a final output using a trained value metric. We show multi-prompt improves MBR across a comprehensive set of conditional generation tasks, and show this is a result of estimating a more diverse and higher quality candidate space than that of a single prompt. Our experiments confirm multi-prompt improves generation across tasks, models and metrics. | David Heineman, Yao Dou, Wei Xu |  |

This paper delves into the complex domain of cognitive distortions which are prevalent distortions in cognitive processes often associated with mental health issues. Focusing on patient-doctor dialogues, we introduce a pioneering method for detecting and reasoning about cognitive distortions utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs). Operating within a multimodal context encompassing audio, video, and textual data, our approach underscores the critical importance of integrating diverse modalities for a comprehensive understanding of cognitive distortions. By leveraging multimodal information, including audio, video, and textual data, our method offers a nuanced perspective that enhances the accuracy and depth of cognitive distortion detection... | Gopendra Vikram Singh, Sai Vemulapalli, Mauajama Firdaus, Asif Ekbal |  |

In this paper, we present a simple and efficient method for correcting errors in trained contrastive image-text retrieval models with no additional training, called Nearest Neighbor Normalization (NNN). We show an improvement on retrieval metrics in both text retrieval and image retrieval for all of the contrastive models that we tested (CLIP, BLIP, ALBEF, SigLIP, BEiT) and for both of the datasets that we used (MS-COCO and Flickr30k). NNN requires a reference database, but does not require any training on this database, and can even increase the retrieval accuracy of a model after finetuning. | Neil Chowdhury, Franklin Wang, Sumedh Shenoy, Douwe Kiela, Sarah Schwettmann, Tristan Thrush |  |

We first highlight the inadequacy of current accuracy-based multiple choice question answering (MCQA) formats in assessing social-pragmatic reasoning, and propose the direct evaluation of models’ free-form responses as measure, which correlates better with human judgment. Furthermore, we explore methods to improve pragmatic abilities in LLMs, advocating for preference optimization (PO) over supervised finetuning (SFT), given the absence of a definitive “gold” answer in social contexts. Our results show that preferential tuning consistently outperforms SFT across pragmatic phenomena and offers a near-free launch in pragmatic abilities without compromising general capabilities. Lastly, we examine the internal structure of LLMs, revealing that the significant boost in pragmatic reasoning is tied to deeper layer representations, analogous to human high-level thinking.... | Shengguang Wu, Shusheng Yang, Zhenglun Chen, Qi Su |  |

Existing long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) for LCQA often struggle with the “lost in the middle” issue. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates this issue by providing external factual evidence. However, its chunking strategy disrupts the global long-context information, and its low-quality retrieval in long contexts hinders LLMs from identifying effective factual details due to substantial noise. To this end, we propose LongRAG, a general, dual-perspective, and robust LLM-based RAG system paradigm for LCQA to enhance RAG’s understanding of complex long-context knowledge (i.e., global information and factual details). We design LongRAG as a plug-and-play paradigm, facilitating adaptation to various domains and LLMs. Extensive experiments on three multi-hop datasets demonstrate that LongRAG significantly outperforms long-context... | Qingfei Zhao, Ruobing Wang, Yukuo Cen, Daren Zha, Shicheng Tan, Yuxiao Dong, Jie Tang |  |

It injects a unique signature based on the “green-red” list that can be tracked during detection, where the words in green lists are encouraged to be generated. Recent researchers propose to fix the green/red lists or increase the proportion of green tokens to defend against paraphrasing attacks. However, these methods cause degradation of text quality due to semantic disparities between the watermarked text and the unwatermarked text. In this paper, we propose a semantic-aware watermark method that considers contexts to generate a semantic-aware key to split a semantically balanced green/red list for watermark injection. The semantic balanced list reduces the performance drop due to adding bias on green lists. To defend against paraphrasing attacks, we generate the watermark key considering the semantics of contexts via locally sensitive hashing. To improve the text quality, we propose to... | Yuxuan Guo, Zhiliang Tian, Yiping Song, Tianlun Liu, Liang Ding, Dongsheng Li |  |

Model editing emerges as a promising solution to address these challenges. However, existing editing methods struggle to track and incorporate changes in knowledge associated with edits, which limits the generalization ability of post-edit LLMs in processing edited knowledge. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel model editing method that leverages knowledge graphs for enhancing LLM editing, namely GLAME. Specifically, we first utilize a knowledge graph augmentation module to uncover associated knowledge that has changed due to editing, obtaining its internal representations within LLMs. This approach allows knowledge alterations within LLMs to be reflected through an external graph structure. Subsequently, we design a graph-based knowledge edit module to integrate structured knowledge into the model editing.

With the steady increase in the usage of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT in academic writing, there is a growing concern that AI-generated texts could compromise the scientific publishing including peer-reviews. Previous works have focused on generic AI-generated text detection or have presented an approach for estimating the fraction of peer-reviews that can be AI-generated. Our focus here is to solve a real-world problem by assisting the editor or chair in determining whether a review is written by ChatGPT or not. To address this, we introduce the Term Frequency (TF) model, which posits that AI often repeats tokens, and the Review Regeneration (RR) model which is based on the idea that ChatGPT generates similar outputs upon re-prompting. We stress test these detectors against token attack and paraphrasing. Finally we propose an effective defensive... | Sandeep Kumar, Mohit Sahu, Vardhan Gacche, Tirthankar Ghosal, Asif Ekbal |  |

Existing methods largely use closed-vocabulary object lists to mitigate or evaluate hallucinations in image captioning, ignoring the long-tailed nature of hallucinations that occur in practice. To this end, we propose a framework for addressing hallucinations in image captioning in the open-vocabulary setting. Our framework includes a new benchmark, OpenCHAIR, that leverages generative foundation models to evaluate open-vocabulary object hallucinations for image captioning, surpassing the popular and similarly-sized CHAIR benchmark in both diversity and accuracy. Furthermore, to mitigate open-vocabulary hallucinations without using a closed object list, we propose MOCHa, an approach harnessing advancements in reinforcement learning.

This paper supposes that the non-uniformity of the norm of the parameters is one of the causes of loss spikes. Here, in training of neural networks, the scale of the gradients is required to be kept constant throughout the layers to avoid the vanishing and exploding gradients problem. However, to meet these requirements in the Transformer model, the norm of the model parameters must be non-uniform, and thus, parameters whose norm is smaller are more sensitive to the parameter update. To address this issue, we propose a novel technique, weight scaling as reparameterization (WeSaR). WeSaR introduces a gate parameter per parameter matrix and adjusts it to the value satisfying the requirements. Because of the gate parameter, WeSaR sets the norm of the original parameters uniformly, which results in stable training.

However, typical active learning methods overlook the presence of distinct example groups within a class, whose prevalence may vary, e.g., in occupation classification datasets certain demographics are disproportionately represented in specific classes. This oversight causes models to rely on shortcuts for predictions, i.e., spurious correlations between input attributes and labels occurring in well-represented groups. To address this issue, we propose Active Learning Via INterpolation (ALVIN), which conducts intra-class interpolations between examples from under-represented and well-represented groups to create anchors, i.e., artificial points situated between the example groups in the representation space. By selecting instances close to the anchors for annotation, ALVIN identifies informative examples exposing the model to regions of the representation space that... | Michalis Korakakis, Andreas Vlachos, Adrian Weller |  |

While the significance of dataset quality is generally recognized, explicit investigations into its impact within the RLHF framework, to our knowledge, have been limited. This paper addresses the issue of text quality within the preference dataset by focusing on direct preference optimization (DPO), an increasingly adopted reward-model-free RLHF method. We confirm that text quality significantly influences the performance of models optimized with DPO more than those optimized with reward-model-based RLHF. Building on this new insight, we propose an extension of DPO, termed filtered direct preference optimization (fDPO). fDPO uses a trained reward model to monitor the quality of texts within the preference dataset during DPO training. Samples of lower quality are discarded based on comparisons with texts generated by the model being optimized, resulting in a more... | Tetsuro Morimura, Mitsuki Sakamoto, Yuu Jinnai, Kenshi Abe, Kaito Ariu |  |

While prompt-masking (PLW = 0) is common for SIFT, some fine-tuning APIs support fractional PLWs and suggest that using a small non-zero PLW can help stabilize learning when fine-tuning on short-completion data. However, there has never been a study confirming this claim, and OpenAI, a major cloud-based SIFT provider, recently removed this parameter from their fine-tuning API. We found that performance of models fine-tuned on short-completion data had a statistically-significant negative quadratic relationship with PLW. Using small values (0.01 − 0.5) of PLW produced better results on multiple-choice and short-generation benchmarks (outperforming models fine-tuned on long-completion data) while large values (≈ 1.0) of PLW produced better results on long-generation benchmarks. We explained this effect and verified its importance through additional... | Mathew HuertaEnochian, Seung Ko |  |

However, adding a new link to the network is not trivial: it requires not only the identification of a suitable pair of source and target entities but also the understanding of the content of the source to locate a suitable position for the link in the text. The latter problem has not been addressed effectively, particularly in the absence of text spans in the source that could serve as anchors to insert a link to the target entity. To bridge this gap, we introduce and operationalize the task of entity insertion in information networks. Focusing on the case of Wikipedia, we empirically show that this problem is, both, relevant and challenging for editors. We compile a benchmark dataset in 105 languages and develop a framework for entity insertion called LocEI (Localized Entity Insertion) and its multilingual variant... | Tomás Feith, Akhil Arora, Martin Gerlach, Debjit Paul, Robert West |  |

However, its effectiveness over discourse-level event relation extraction (ERE) tasks remains unexplored. In this paper, we assess the effectiveness of LLMs in addressing discourse-level ERE tasks characterized by lengthy documents and intricate relations encompassing coreference, temporal, causal, and subevent types. Evaluation is conducted using an commercial model, GPT-3.5, and an open-source model, LLaMA-2. Our study reveals a notable underperformance of LLMs compared to the baseline established through supervised learning. Although Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) can improve LLMs performance, it does not scale well compared to the smaller supervised baseline model. Our quantitative and qualitative analysis shows that LLMs have several weaknesses when applied for extracting event relations, including a tendency to fabricate event mentions, and failures to capture... | Kangda Wei, Aayush Gautam, Ruihong Huang |  |

An Empirical Assessment of Meta-Learning and Joint Learning AMR Parsing](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.findings-emnlp.3) |  | 0 | Cross-lingual AMR parsing is the task of predicting AMR graphs in a target language when training data is available only in a source language. Due to the small size of AMR training data and evaluation data, cross-lingual AMR parsing has only been explored in a small set of languages such as English, Spanish, German, Chinese, and Italian. Taking inspiration from Langedijk et al. (2022), who apply meta-learning to tackle cross-lingual syntactic parsing, we investigate the use of meta-learning for cross-lingual AMR parsing. We evaluate our models in k-shot scenarios (including 0-shot) and assess their effectiveness in Croatian, Farsi, Korean, Chinese, and French. Notably, Korean and Croatian test sets are developed as part of our work, based on the existing The Little Prince English AMR corpus, and made publicly available. We empirically study our method by comparing it to classical joint learning. Our findings suggest that while the meta-learning model performs slightly better in 0-shot... | Jeongwoo Kang, Maximin Coavoux, Cédric Lopez, Didier Schwab |  |

However, prevalent unified IE approaches inevitably encounter challenges such as noise interference, abstract label semantics, and diverse span granularity. In this paper, we first present three problematic assumptions regarding the capabilities of unified information extraction model. Furthermore, we propose the General Collaborative Information Extraction (GCIE) framework to address these challenges in universal information extraction tasks. Specifically, GCIE consists of a general Recognizer as well as multiple task-specific Experts for recognizing predefined types and extracting spans respectively. The Recognizer is a large language model, while the Experts comprise a series of smaller language models. Together, they collaborate in a two-stage pipeline to perform unified information extraction.... | Kunlong Bao, Ning Wang |  |

Language models employing cross-encoding demonstrate satisfactory performance in STS, yet their effectiveness significantly diminishes in C-STS. In this work, we argue that the failure is due to the fact that the redundant information in the text distracts language models from the required condition-relevant information. To alleviate this, we propose Self-Augmentation via Self-Reweighting (SEAVER), which, based solely on models’ internal attention and without the need for external auxiliary information, adaptively reallocates the model’s attention weights by emphasizing the importance of condition-relevant tokens. On the C-STS-2023 test set, SEAVER consistently improves performance of all million-scale fine-tuning baseline models (up to around 3 points), and even surpasses performance of billion-scale... | Baixuan Li, Yunlong Fan, Zhiqiang Gao |  |

Knowledge-Augmented Korean Grammatical Error Correction with Large Language Models](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.findings-emnlp.6) |  | 0 | Grammatical error correction (GEC) system is a practical task used in the real world, showing high achievements alongside the development of large language models (LLMs). However, these achievements have been primarily obtained in English, and there is a relative lack of performance for non-English data, such as Korean. We hypothesize that this insufficiency occurs because relying solely on the parametric knowledge of LLMs makes it difficult to thoroughly understand the given context in the Korean GEC. Therefore, we propose a Knowledge-Augmented GEC (KAGEC) framework that incorporates evidential information from external sources into the prompt for the GEC task. KAGEC first extracts salient phrases from the given source and retrieves non-parametric knowledge based on these phrases, aiming to enhance the context-aware generation capabilities of LLMs. Furthermore, we conduct validations for fine-grained error types to identify those requiring a retrieval-augmented manner when LLMs... | Seonmin Koo, Jinsung Kim, Chanjun Park, Heuiseok Lim |  |

Furthermore, the common practice of measuring DR might not be fully accurate. Current research focuses on challenge sets and relies solely on the Source Drop (SD): Using the source in-domain performance as a reference point for degradation. However, we argue that the Target Drop (TD), which measures degradation from the target in-domain performance, should be used as a complementary point of view. To address these issues, we first curated a DR benchmark comprised of 7 diverse NLP tasks, which enabled us to measure both the SD and the TD. We then conducted a comprehensive large-scale DR study involving over 14,000 domain shifts across 21 fine-tuned models and few-shot LLMs. We found that both model types suffer from drops upon domain shifts. While fine-tuned models excel in-domain, few-shot LLMs often surpass them... | Nitay Calderon, Naveh Porat, Eyal BenDavid, Alexander Chapanin, Zorik Gekhman, Nadav Oved, Vitaly Shalumov, Roi Reichart |  |

Unlike approaches that learn a fixed representation of the output classes, we generate at inference time a model tailored to a query classification task. To generate task-based zero-shot classifiers, we train a hypernetwork that receives class descriptions and outputs a multi-class model. The hypernetwork is designed to be equivariant with respect to the set of descriptions and the classification layer, thus obeying the symmetries of the problem and improving generalization. Our approach generates non-linear classifiers, handles rich textual descriptions, and may be adapted to produce lightweight models efficient enough for on-device applications. We evaluate this approach in a series of zero-shot classification tasks, for image, point-cloud, and action recognition,... | Ohad Amosy, Tomer Volk, Eilam Shapira, Eyal BenDavid, Roi Reichart, Gal Chechik |  |

Existing methods that focus on sentence arrangement, textual consistency, and question answering have been shown to be inadequate in addressing this issue. To bridge this gap, we introduce InsertGNN which conceptualizes the problem as a graph and employ a hierarchical Graph Neural Network (GNN) to comprehend the interplay between sentences. Our approach was rigorously evaluated on a TOEFL dataset, and its efficacy was further validated on the expansive arXiv dataset using cross-domain learning. Thorough experimentation unequivocally establishes InsertGNN’s superiority over all comparative benchmarks, achieving an impressive 70% accuracy—a performance on par with average human test scores. | Fang Wu, Stan Z.

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved great success in various tasks, but their potential is less explored in AES. In this paper, we show that our zero-shot prompting framework, Multi Trait Specialization (MTS), elicits LLMs’ ample potential for essay scoring. In particular, we automatically decompose writing proficiency into distinct traits and generate scoring criteria for each trait. Then, an LLM is prompted to extract trait scores from several conversational rounds, each round scoring one of the traits based on the scoring criteria. Finally, we derive the overall score via trait averaging and min-max scaling. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that MTS consistently outperforms straightforward prompting (Vanilla) in average QWK across all LLMs and datasets, with maximum gains of 0.437 on TOEFL11... | Sanwoo Lee, Yida Cai, Desong Meng, Ziyang Wang, Yunfang Wu |  |

Evaluating and enhancing the capabilities of LLMs in evidence detection will strengthen context-based reasoning performance. This paper proposes a benchmark called DetectBench for verifying the ability to detect and piece together implicit evidence within a long context. DetectBench contains 3,928 multiple-choice questions, with an average of 994 tokens per question. Each question contains an average of 4.55 pieces of implicit evidence, and solving the problem typically requires 7.62 logical jumps to find the correct answer. To enhance the performance of LLMs in evidence detection, this paper proposes Detective Reasoning Prompt and Finetune. Experiments demonstrate that the existing LLMs’ abilities to detect evidence in long contexts are far inferior to humans. However, the Detective Reasoning Prompt effectively enhances the capability of powerful LLMs in evidence detection, while the Finetuning... | Zhouhong Gu, Lin Zhang, Xiaoxuan Zhu, Jiangjie Chen, Wenhao Huang, Yikai Zhang, Shusen Wang, Zheyu Ye, Yan Gao, Hongwei Feng, Yanghua Xiao |  |

However, existing methods often encounter difficulties in drawing accurate class prototypes from support set samples, primarily due to probable large intra-class differences and small inter-class differences within the task. Recent approaches attempt to incorporate external knowledge or pre-trained language models to augment data, but this requires additional resources and thus does not suit many few-shot scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel solution to address this issue by adequately leveraging the information within the task itself. Specifically, we utilize label information to construct a task-adaptive metric space, thereby adaptively reducing the intra-class differences and magnifying the inter-class differences. We further employ the optimal transport technique to estimate class prototypes with query set samples together, mitigating the problem of... | Xinyue Liu, Yunlong Gao, Linlin Zong, Bo Xu |  |

One approach focuses on enhancing the generation process by incorporating attribution from the given input to the output. However, the challenge of identifying appropriate attributions and verifying their accuracy against a source is a complex task that requires significant improvements in assessing such systems. We introduce an attribution-oriented Chain-of-Thought reasoning method to enhance the accuracy of attributions. This approach focuses the reasoning process on generating an attribution-centric output. Evaluations on two context enhanced question-answering datasets using GPT-4 demonstrate improved accuracy and correctness of attributions. In addition, the combination of our method with finetuning enhances the response and attribution accuracy of two smaller LLMs, showing their potential to... | Moshe Berchansky, Daniel Fleischer, Moshe Wasserblat, Peter Izsak |  |

Despite these advancements, VLLMs still encounter substantial difficulties in handling queries involving long-tail entities, with a tendency to produce erroneous or hallucinated responses. In this work, we introduce a novel evaluative benchmark named SnapNTell, specifically tailored for entity-centric VQA. This task aims to test the models’ capabilities in identifying entities and providing detailed, entity-specific knowledge. We have developed the SnapNTell Dataset, distinct from traditional VQA datasets: (1) It encompasses a wide range of categorized entities, each represented by images and explicitly named in the answers; (2) It features QA pairs that require extensive knowledge for accurate responses.

Traditional studies including theoretical model-based, empirical study-based and simulation-based methods encounter limitations due to the idealized assumption of complete information and individual rationality, as well as constraints posed by limited available data. In this work, we propose an innovative framework, SRAP-Agent, which integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) into economic simulations, aiming to bridge the gap between theoretical models and real-world dynamics. Using public housing allocation scenarios as a case study, we conduct extensive policy simulation experiments to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the SRAP-Agent and employ the Policy Optimization Algorithm with certain optimization objectives.

It is designed to help us analyze and categorize subtle signals in these posts that indicate people are asking for help during times of war. We are using advanced language processing and machine learning techniques to pick up on the nuances of language that show distress or urgency. The dataset is the binary classification of the social media posts that required help and did not require help in the war. The dataset could significantly improve humanitarian efforts, allowing for quicker and more targeted help for those facing the challenges of war.

However, these methods mainly focus on selecting informative data for expert annotations to improve the model predictive ability (i.e., triage-to-human data), while the rest of the data is indiscriminately assigned to model annotation (i.e., triage-to-model data). This may lead to inefficiencies in budget allocation for annotations, as easy data that the model could accurately annotate may be unnecessarily assigned to the expert, and hard data may be misclassified by the model. As a result, the overall annotation quality may be compromised. To address this issue, we propose a selective annotation framework called SANT. It effectively takes advantage of both the triage-to-human and triage-to-model data through the proposed error-aware triage and... | Chen Huang, Yang Deng, Wenqiang Lei, Jiancheng Lv, Ido Dagan |  |

However, existing unsupervised document hashing methods merely consider flat semantics of documents, resulting in the inability of preserving hierarchical semantics in hash codes. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical generative model that can model and leverage the hierarchical structure of semantics. Specifically, we introduce hierarchical prototypes into the model to construct a hierarchical prior distribution, which is integrated into the variational auto-encoder (VAE) framework, enabling the model to produce hash codes preserving rough hierarchical semantics. To further promote the preservation of hierarchical structure, we force the hash code to preserve as much semantic information as possible via contrastive learning, which exploits the hierarchical pseudo labels produced during VAE training. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks outperform all baseline methods, demonstrating the superiority of... | Qian Zhang, Qinliang Su, Jiayang Chen, Zhenpeng Song |  |

However, multiple KG embeddings can perform almost equally well for link prediction yet give conflicting predictions for unseen queries. This phenomenon is termed predictive multiplicity in the literature. It poses substantial risks for KGE-based applications in high-stake domains but has been overlooked in KGE research. We define predictive multiplicity in link prediction, introduce evaluation metrics and measure predictive multiplicity for representative KGE methods on commonly used benchmark datasets. Our empirical study reveals significant predictive multiplicity in link prediction, with 8% to 39% testing queries exhibiting conflicting predictions. We address this issue by leveraging voting methods from social choice theory, significantly mitigating conflicts by 66% to 78% in our experiments. | Yuqicheng Zhu, Nico Potyka, Mojtaba Nayyeri, Bo Xiong, Yunjie He, Evgeny Kharlamov, Steffen Staab |  |

In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in studying graph reasoning over HKGs. Meanwhile, as discussed in recent works that focus on temporal KGs (TKGs), world knowledge is ever-evolving, making it important to reason over temporal facts in KGs. Previous mainstream benchmark HKGs do not explicitly specify temporal information for each HKG fact. Therefore, almost all existing HKG reasoning approaches do not devise any module specifically for temporal reasoning. To better study temporal fact reasoning over HKGs, we propose a new type of data structure named hyper-relational TKG (HTKG). Every fact in an HTKG is coupled with a timestamp explicitly indicating its time validity. We develop two new benchmark HTKG datasets, i.e., Wiki-hy and YAGO-hy, and propose an HTKG reasoning... | Zifeng Ding, Jingcheng Wu, Jingpei Wu, Yan Xia, Bo Xiong, Volker Tresp |  |

Existing automatic evaluation metrics either suffer from failing to consider factual correctness (e.g., BLEU and ROUGE) or are limited in their interpretability (e.g., F1CheXpert and F1RadGraph). In this paper, we introduce GREEN (Generative Radiology Report Evaluation and Error Notation), a radiology report generation metric that leverages the natural language understanding of language models to identify and explain clinically significant errors in candidate reports, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Compared to current metrics, GREEN offers: 1) a score aligned with expert preferences, 2) human interpretable explanations of clinically significant errors, enabling feedback loops with end-users, and 3) a lightweight open-source method that reaches the performance of commercial counterparts.

Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a widely adopted approach, but while advanced techniques like graph neural networks (GNNs) and self-supervised learning (SSL) have enhanced CF models for better user representations, they often lack the ability to provide explanations for the recommended items. Explainable recommendations aim to address this gap by offering transparency and insights into the recommendation decision-making process, enhancing users’ understanding. This work leverages the language capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to push the boundaries of explainable recommender systems. We introduce a model-agnostic framework called XRec, which enables LLMs to provide comprehensive explanations for user behaviors in recommender systems. By integrating collaborative signals and designing a lightweight collaborative adaptor, the framework... | Qiyao Ma, Xubin Ren, Chao Huang |  |

The LLM is prompted to answer these questionnaires by impersonating the interviewee. The obtained answers are coded as features, which are used to predict standardized psychiatric measures of depression (PHQ-8) and PTSD (PCL-C), using a Random Forest regressor. Our approach is shown to enhance diagnostic accuracy compared to multiple baselines. It thus establishes a novel framework for interpreting unstructured psychological interviews, bridging the gap between narrative-driven and data-driven approaches for mental health assessment. | Gony Rosenman, Talma Hendler, Lior Wolf |  |

Yet, summarizing disordered, large-scale texts, like those found in social media and customer feedback, remains a significant challenge. Current research largely targets predefined aspects within structured texts, neglecting the complexities of dynamic and disordered environments. Addressing this gap, we introduce Disordered-DABS, a novel benchmark for dynamic aspect-based summarization tailored to unstructured text. Developed by adapting existing datasets for cost-efficiency and scalability, our comprehensive experiments and detailed human evaluations reveal that Disordered-DABS poses unique challenges to contemporary summarization models, including state-of-the-art language models such as GPT-3.5. | Xiaobo Guo, Soroush Vosoughi |  |

However, low-resource languages are left behind due to the unavailability of resources. In this work, we focus on enhancing the LLaMA-2-Amharic model by integrating task-specific and generative datasets to improve language model performance for Amharic. We compile an Amharic instruction fine-tuning dataset and fine-tuned LLaMA-2-Amharic model. The fine-tuned model shows promising results in different NLP tasks. We also explore the effectiveness of translated instruction datasets compared to the dataset we created. Our dataset creation pipeline, along with instruction datasets, trained models, and evaluation outputs, is made publicly available to encourage research in language-specific models. | Israel Abebe Azime, Atnafu Lambebo Tonja, Tadesse Destaw Belay, Mitiku Yohannes Fuge, Aman Kassahun Wassie, Eyasu Shiferaw Jada, Yonas Chanie, Walelign Tewabe Sewunetie, Seid Muhie Yimam |  |

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capacity for reasoning and problem-solving. However, their potential in authorship analysis remains under-explored. Traditional studies have depended on hand-crafted stylistic features, whereas state-of-the-art approaches leverage text embeddings from pre-trained language models. These methods, which typically require fine-tuning on labeled data, often suffer from performance degradation in cross-domain applications and provide limited explainability. This work seeks to address three research questions: (1) Can LLMs perform zero-shot, end-to-end authorship verification effectively? (2) Are LLMs capable of accurately attributing authorship among multiple candidates authors (e.g., 10 and 20)? (3) Can LLMs provide explainability in authorship analysis, particularly through the role of linguistic features?... | Baixiang Huang, Canyu Chen, Kai Shu |  |

Nonetheless, they have limited applications in simultaneous machine translation (SiMT), currently dominated by encoder-decoder transformers. This study demonstrates that, after fine-tuning on a small dataset comprising causally aligned source and target sentence pairs, a pre-trained open-source LLM can control input segmentation directly by generating a special “wait” token. This obviates the need for a separate policy and enables the LLM to perform English-German and English-Russian SiMT tasks with BLEU scores that are comparable to those of specific state-of-the-art baselines. We also evaluated closed-source models such as GPT-4, which displayed encouraging results in performing the SiMT task without prior training (zero-shot), indicating a promising avenue for enhancing future SiMT systems. | Roman Koshkin, Katsuhito Sudoh, Satoshi Nakamura |  |

To address this problem, Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is identified as an effective solution. ICA-transformed word embeddings reveal interpretable semantic axes; however, the order of these axes are arbitrary. In this study, we focus on this property and propose a novel method, Axis Tour, which optimizes the order of the axes. Inspired by Word Tour, a one-dimensional word embedding method, we aim to improve the clarity of the word embedding space by maximizing the semantic continuity of the axes. Furthermore, we show through experiments on downstream tasks that Axis Tour yields better or comparable low-dimensional embeddings compared to both PCA and ICA. | Hiroaki Yamagiwa, Yusuke Takase, Hidetoshi Shimodaira |  |

However, the choice of granularity at which DP is applied is often neglected. For example, neural machine translation (NMT) typically operates on the sentence-level granularity. From the perspective of DP, this setup assumes that each sentence belongs to a single person and any two sentences in the training dataset are independent. This assumption is however violated in many real-world NMT datasets, e.g., those including dialogues. For proper application of DP we thus must shift from sentences to entire documents. In this paper, we investigate NMT at both the sentence and document levels, analyzing the privacy/utility trade-off for both scenarios, and evaluating the risks of not using the appropriate privacy granularity in terms of leaking personally identifiable information (PII). Our findings indicate that the document-level... | Doan Nam Long Vu, Timour Igamberdiev, Ivan Habernal |  |

It allows models to “cheat” via memorisation instead of displaying true capabilities. Therefore, contamination analysis has become an crucial part of reliable model evaluation to validate results. However, existing contamination analysis is usually conducted internally by large language model developers and often lacks transparency and completeness. This paper presents an extensive data contamination report for over 15 popular large language models across six popular multiple-choice QA benchmarks. We also introduce an open-source pipeline that enables the community to perform contamination analysis on customised data and models. Our experiments reveal varying contamination levels ranging from 1% to 45% across benchmarks, with the contamination degree increasing rapidly over time. Performance analysis of large language models indicates that data contamination... | Yucheng Li, Yunhao Guo, Frank Guerin, Chenghua Lin |  |

Additionally, we implement a prompt driven by Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning, CLINICR, to mirror the prospective process of incremental reasoning, reaching a correct response to medical questions. We empirically demonstrate how CLINICR outperforms the state-of-the-art 5-shot CoT-based prompt (Liévin et al., 2022). We also present an approach that mirrors real-life clinical practice by first exploring multiple differential diagnoses through MCQ-CLINICR and subsequently narrowing down to a final diagnosis using MCQ-ELIMINATIVE. Finally, emphasizing the importance of response verification in medical settings, we utilize a reward model mechanism, replacing the elimination process performed by MCQ-ELIMINATIVE. | Saeel Sandeep Nachane, Ojas Gramopadhye, Prateek Chanda, Ganesh Ramakrishnan, Kshitij Sharad Jadhav, Yatin Nandwani, Dinesh Raghu, Sachindra Joshi |  |

Current methods to improve data quality are either labor-intensive or prone to factual errors caused by LLM hallucinations. This paper explores elevating the quality of existing instruction data to better align with human values, introducing a simple and effective approach named ReAlign, which reformats the responses of instruction data into a format that better aligns with pre-established criteria and the collated evidence. This approach minimizes human annotation, hallucination, and the difficulty in scaling, remaining orthogonal to existing alignment techniques. Experimentally, ReAlign significantly boosts the general alignment ability, math reasoning, factuality, and readability of the LLMs.Encouragingly, without introducing any additional data or advanced training techniques, and merely by reformatting the response, LLaMA-2-13B’s mathematical reasoning ability on GSM8K can be... | RunZe Fan, Xuefeng Li, Haoyang Zou, Junlong Li, Shwai He, Ethan Chern, Jiewen Hu, Pengfei Liu |  |

However, annotating documents with keyphrases is often prohibitively expensive and impractical, requiring expert annotators. This paper presents silk, an unsupervised method designed to address this issue by extracting silver-standard keyphrases from citation contexts to create synthetic labeled data for domain adaptation. Extensive experiments across three distinct domains demonstrate that our method yields high-quality synthetic samples, resulting in significant and consistent improvements in in-domain performance over strong baselines. | Florian Boudin, Akiko Aizawa |  |

However, gathering and releasing large-scale, real-life multi-turn conversations that could facilitate advancements in mental health support presents challenges in data privacy protection and the time and cost involved in crowdsourcing. To address these challenges, we introduce SMILE, a single-turn to multi-turn inclusive language expansion technique that prompts ChatGPT to rewrite public single-turn dialogues into multi-turn ones. Our work begins by analyzing language transformation and validating the feasibility of our proposed method. We conduct a study on dialogue diversity, including lexical features, semantic features, and dialogue topics, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method. Further, we employ our method to generate a large-scale, lifelike, and diverse dialogue dataset named SMILECHAT, consisting of 55k dialogues.... | Huachuan Qiu, Hongliang He, Shuai Zhang, Anqi Li, Zhenzhong Lan |  |

In recent years, there has been a gradual shift from sentence-level event extraction to document-level event extraction research. Despite the significant success achieved in English domain event extraction research, event extraction in Chinese still remains largely unexplored. However, a major obstacle to promoting Chinese document-level event extraction is the lack of fine-grained, wide domain coverage datasets for model training and evaluation. In this paper, we propose DocEE-zh, a new Chinese document-level event extraction dataset comprising over 36,000 events and more than 210,000 arguments. DocEE-zh is an extension of the DocEE dataset, utilizing the same event schema, and all data has been meticulously annotated by human experts. We highlight two features: focus on high-interest event types and fine-grained argument types. Experimental results indicate that state-of-the-art models... | Minghui Liu, Meihan Tong, Yangda Peng, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li, Bin Xu |  |

In these settings, prompt programs are repeatedly called with different user queries or data instances. A big practical challenge is optimizing such prompt programs. Recent work has mostly focused on either simple prompt programs or assumed that the structure of a prompt program is fixed.We introduce SAMMO, a framework to perform symbolic prompt program search for compile-time optimizations of prompt programs. SAMMO represents prompt programs on a symbolic level which allows for a rich set of transformations that can be searched over during optimization. We show that SAMMO generalizes previous methods and improves the performance of complex prompts on (1) instruction tuning, (2) RAG pipeline tuning, and (3) prompt compression, across several different LLMs. We make all code available open-source at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/sammo-4003/. | Tobias Schnabel, Jennifer Neville |  |

These methods typically involve training a PEFT module for each new task and employing similarity-based selection to route modules during inference. However, they face two major limitations: 1) interference during module training with already learned modules and 2) suboptimal routing when composing modules. In this paper, we present L2R, a method that isolates the training of new PEFT modules to ensure their task specialization. L2R then learns to compose the learned modules by training a network of routers that leverages a small memory containing examples of previously seen tasks. We evaluate our method in two CL setups using various benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that L2R provides an effective composition of PEFT modules, leading to improved generalization and performance compared to other methods. | Vladimir Araujo, MarieFrancine Moens, Tinne Tuytelaars |  |

Our research explores the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) in supertagging for both Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) and Lambek Categorial Grammar (LCG). We also present a simple method that significantly boosts LLMs, enabling them to outperform LSTM and encoder-based models and achieve state-of-the-art performance. This advancement highlights LLMs’ potential in classification tasks, showcasing their adaptability beyond generative capabilities. Our findings demonstrate the evolving utility of LLMs in natural language processing, particularly in complex tasks like supertagging. | Jinman Zhao, Gerald Penn |  |

Current approaches and evaluations merely explore the instance-level editing, while whether LLMs possess the capability to modify concepts remains unclear. This paper pioneers the investigation of editing conceptual knowledge for LLMs, by constructing a novel benchmark dataset ConceptEdit and establishing a suite of new metrics for evaluation. The experimental results reveal that, although existing editing methods can efficiently modify concept-level definition to some extent, they also have the potential to distort the related instantial knowledge in LLMs, leading to poor performance. We anticipate this work can inspire further progress in understanding LLMs. | Xiaohan Wang, Shengyu Mao, Shumin Deng, Yunzhi Yao, Yue Shen, Lei Liang, Jinjie Gu, Huajun Chen, Ningyu Zhang |  |

However, an off-the-shelf RAG system, which relies on generally pre-trained LLMs and retrievers, often falls short in specialized domains and applications. In this paper, we introduce RAG-Studio, an efficient self-aligned training framework to adapt general RAG models to specific domains solely through synthetic data, eliminating the need for expensive human-labeled in-domain data. RAG-Studio accepts a specialized domain corpus, a general LLM, and a general retriever, then autonomously generates contrastive training data for both the LLM and retriever through self-alignment. We fine-tune them to work cohesively as an integrated and effective domain-specific RAG system, where the LLM is adapted to incorporate new domain knowledge and become robust to noisy contexts, and the retriever learns to... | Kelong Mao, Zheng Liu, Hongjin Qian, Fengran Mo, Chenlong Deng, Zhicheng Dou |  |

While recent developments in Large Multimodal Models have demonstrated remarkable abilities in visual reasoning and mathematical tasks, there is little work on investigating whether these models can effectively interpret visual elements for code generation. To this end, we present MMCode, the first multi-modal coding dataset for evaluating algorithmic problem-solving skills in visually rich contexts. MMCode contains 3,548 questions and 6,620 images collected from real-world programming challenges harvested from 10 code competition websites, presenting significant challenges due to the extreme demand for reasoning abilities.

In this work, we identify that existing large language models (LLMs) underperform in this domain due to challenges in understanding case complexities and distinguishing between similar charges. To adapt LLMs for effective legal judgment prediction, we introduce the Ask-Discriminate-Predict (ADAPT) reasoning framework inspired by human judicial reasoning. ADAPT involves decomposing case facts, discriminating among potential charges, and predicting the final judgment. We further enhance LLMs through fine-tuning with multi-task synthetic trajectories to improve legal judgment prediction accuracy and efficiency under our ADAPT framework. Extensive experiments conducted on two widely-used datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our framework in legal judgment prediction, particularly when dealing with complex and confusing charges. | Chenlong Deng, Kelong Mao, Yuyao Zhang, Zhicheng Dou |  |

To adapt LMMs for downstream tasks, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) which only trains additional prefix tokens or modules, has gained popularity. Nevertheless, there has been little analysis of how PEFT works in LMMs. In this paper, we delve into the strengths and weaknesses of each tuning strategy, shifting the focus from the efficiency typically associated with these approaches. We first discover that model parameter tuning methods such as LoRA and Adapters, distort the feature representation space learned during pre-training, limiting the full utilization of pre-trained knowledge. We also demonstrate that prefix-tuning excels at preserving the representation space, despite of its lower performance on downstream tasks. These findings suggest a simple two-step PEFT strategy called... | Donghoon Kim, Gusang Lee, Kyuhong Shim, Byonghyo Shim |  |

However, the evolution of historical events are more complicated in real world scenarios and the limited information provided by the event script chain also make it difficult to accurately predict subsequent events. This paper introduces a Causality Graph Event Prediction(CGEP) task that forecasting consequential event based on an Event Causality Graph (ECG). We propose a Semantic Enhanced Distance-sensitive Graph Prompt Learning (SeDGPL) Model for the CGEP task. In SeDGPL, (1) we design a Distance-sensitive Graph Linearization (DsGL) module to reformulate the ECG into a graph prompt template as the input of a PLM; (2) propose an Event-Enriched Causality Encoding (EeCE) module to integrate both event contextual semantic and graph schema information; (3) propose a Semantic Contrast Event Prediction (ScEP) module to enhance the event representation among numerous candidate events and... | Chuanhong Zhan, Wei Xiang, Liang Chao, Bang Wang |  |

An Empirical Study on Reasoning Tasks](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.findings-emnlp.46) |  | 0 | Towards enhancing the chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning of large language models (LLMs), much existing work has revealed the effectiveness of straightforward learning on annotated/generated CoT paths. However, there is less evidence yet that reasoning capabilities can be enhanced through a reverse learning process, i.e., learning from potential mistakes in reasoning. To investigate whether LLMs can learn from mistakes, we construct mistake-correction datasets, using GPT-4 to identify and correct the mistakes in inaccurate CoTs. With these mistake-correction datasets, we fine-tune open-source LLMs and arrive at the following conclusions. (1) LLMs can indeed learn from mistakes to enhance their CoT reasoning performances. (2) Compared to CoT data, the mistake-correction data provides additional knowledge on the explanations and reasons for the potential mistakes in CoTs, which consistently contributes to the effectiveness of learning from mistakes.

This task, known as Event Temporal Relation Extraction (ETRE), aims to identify and extract temporal connections between events in text. Recent studies focus on locating the relative position of event pairs on the timeline by designing logical expressions or auxiliary tasks to predict their temporal occurrence. Despite these advances, this modeling approach neglects the multidimensional information in temporal relation and the hierarchical process of reasoning. In this study, we propose a novel hierarchical modeling approach for this task by introducing a Temporal Cognitive Tree (TCT) that mimics human logical reasoning. Additionally, we also design a integrated model incorporating prompt optimization and deductive reasoning to exploit multidimensional supervised information.

Long-context generation refers to the ability of a language model to generate coherent and contextually accurate text that spans across lengthy passages or documents. While recent studies show strong performance on NIAH and other retrieval-based long-context benchmarks, there is a significant lack of benchmarks for evaluating long-context generation capabilities. To bridge this gap and offer a comprehensive assessment, we introduce a synthetic benchmark, LongGenBench, which allows for flexible configurations of customized generation context lengths. LongGenBench advances beyond traditional benchmarks by redesigning the format of questions and necessitating that LLMs respond with a single, cohesive long-context answer.

Many works have attempted to improve query rewriting in smaller models to avoid rewriting with costly LLMs, and the most common method is to employ reinforcement learning for feedback training. However, current methods require annotations (labeled relevant documents or downstream answers) or predesigned rewards for feedback, lack generalization, and fail to utilize signals tailored for query rewriting. In this paper, we propose RaFe, a framework for training query rewriting models. By leveraging reranker, RaFe provides ranking feedback aligned well with the rewriting objectives without needing signals from annotations and supports both online and offline training models.

Considering the scarcity and limit (e.g., privacy issues) of real user data, in this paper, we conduct large-scale user simulations for the web search scenario to improve the analysis and modeling of user search behavior. Specially, we propose BASES, a novel user simulation framework with LLM-based agents, designed to facilitate comprehensive simulations of web search user behaviors. Our simulation framework can generate unique user profiles at scale, which subsequently leads to diverse search behaviors. To demonstrate the effectiveness of BASES, we conduct evaluation experiments based on two human benchmarks in both Chinese and English, demonstrating that BASES can effectively simulate large-scale human-like search behaviors. To further accommodate the research on web search, we develop WARRIORS, a new large-scale dataset encompassing web... | Ruiyang Ren, Peng Qiu, Yingqi Qu, Jing Liu, Xin Zhao, Hua Wu, JiRong Wen, Haifeng Wang |  |

Research to date focuses on point-wise and pair-wise recommendation paradigms, which are inefficient for LLM-based recommenders due to high computational costs. However, existing list-wise approaches also fall short in ranking tasks due to misalignment between ranking objectives and next-token prediction. Moreover, these LLM-based methods struggle to effectively address the order relation among candidates, particularly given the scale of ratings. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the large language model framework with Aligned Listwise Ranking Objectives (ALRO). ALRO is designed to bridge the gap between the capabilities of LLMs and the nuanced requirements of ranking tasks. Specifically, ALRO employs explicit feedback in a listwise manner by introducing soft lambda loss, a customized adaptation of lambda loss... | Wenshuo Chao, Zhi Zheng, Hengshu Zhu, Hao Liu |  |

These constraints are necessary for content generation and documentation tasks (e.g., writing technical manuals or children’s reading materials), where the goal is to reduce the ambiguity of text content and increase its overall readability for a specific group of audience. Understanding how large language models can capture these constraints can help researchers build better, more impactful tools for wider use beyond the NLP community. Towards this end, we introduce SpeciaLex, a benchmark for evaluating a language model’s ability to follow specialized lexicon-based constraints across 18 diverse subtasks with 1,785 test instances covering core tasks of Checking, Identification, Rewriting, and Open Generation.

Our approach prompts LLM agents to decompose a given task into manageable subtasks (i.e., to make a plan), and to continuously introspect upon the suitability and results of their actions. We implement a three-fold introspective intervention: 1) anticipatory reflection on potential failures and alternative remedy before action execution, 2) post-action alignment with subtask objectives and backtracking with remedy to ensure utmost effort in plan execution, and 3) comprehensive review upon plan completion for future strategy refinement. By deploying and experimenting with this methodology—a zero-shot approach—within WebArena for practical tasks in web environments, our agent demonstrates superior performance with a success rate of 23.5% over existing zero-shot methods by 3.5%.

Conformal Prediction (CP), known for its model-agnostic and distribution-free features, is a desired approach for various LLMs and data distributions. However, existing CP methods for LLMs typically assume access to the logits, which are unavailable for some API-only LLMs. In addition, logits are known to be miscalibrated, potentially leading to degraded CP performance. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel CP method that (1) is tailored for API-only LLMs without logit-access; (2) minimizes the size of prediction sets; and (3) ensures a statistical guarantee of the user-defined coverage. The core idea of this approach is to formulate nonconformity measures using both coarse-grained (i.e., sample frequency) and fine-grained uncertainty notions (e.g., semantic similarity).

This paper investigates to what extent Large Language Models (LLMs) can replace hand-crafted compilers in translating high-level programming languages to machine instructions, using C to x86 assembly as a case study. We identify two challenges of using LLMs for code translation and introduce two novel data pre-processing techniques to address the challenges: numerical value conversion and training data resampling. While only using a 13B model, our approach achieves a behavioral accuracy of over 91%, outperforming the much larger GPT-4 Turbo model by over 50%. Our results are encouraging, showing that LLMs have the potential to transform how compilation tools are constructed. | Shuoming Zhang, Jiacheng Zhao, Chunwei Xia, Zheng Wang, Yunji Chen, Huimin Cui |  |

To steer LLMs towards human preference, alignment technologies have been introduced and gained increasing attention. Nevertheless, existing methods heavily rely on high-quality positive-negative training pairs, suffering from noisy positive responses that are barely distinguishable from negative ones. Given recent LLMs’ proficiency in generating helpful responses, this work pivots towards a new research question: \*\*can we achieve alignment using solely human-annotated negative samples, preserving helpfulness while reducing harmfulness?\*\* For this purpose, we propose Distributional Dispreference Optimization (D2O), which maximizes the discrepancy between dispreferred responses and the generated non-negative ones. In this way, D2O effectively eschews harmful information without incorporating noisy positive samples, while avoiding collapse using self-generated responses as anchors.

Specifically, instruct-tuned models and fine-tuned judge models based on open-source LLMs have been reported. While it is known that judge models are vulnerable to certain biases, such as favoring longer answers regardless of content, the specifics of these biases remain under-explored. In this work, we qualitatively identify six types of biases inherent in various judge models. We propose EvalBiasBench as a meta-evaluation collection of hand-crafted test cases for each bias type. Additionally, we present de-biasing dataset construction methods and the associated preference dataset OffsetBias. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning on our dataset significantly enhances the robustness of judge models against biases and improves performance across most evaluation scenarios. We release our datasets and the fine-tuned judge model to public. | Junsoo Park, Seungyeon Jwa, Meiying Ren, Daeyoung Kim, Sanghyuk Choi |  |

However, most of the previous works ignored the value of glyph, which could contain enriched semantic information and can not be fully expressed by the pre-trained embedding in hieroglyphic languages like Chinese. We argue that, compared with combining the sophisticated textual features, glyphic information from visual modality could provide us with extra and straight semantic information in extracting events. Motivated by this, we propose a glyphic multi-modal Chinese event extraction model with hieroglyphic images to capture the intra- and inter-character morphological structure from the sequence. Extensive experiments build a new state-of-the-art performance in the ACE2005 Chinese and KBP Eval 2017 dataset, which underscores the effectiveness of our proposed glyphic event extraction model, and more importantly, the glyphic feature can be obtained at nearly... | Xiaoyi Bao, Jinghang Gu, Zhongqing Wang, Minjie Qiang, ChuRen Huang |  |

An Empirical Study on Quantity Bias in CLIP](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.findings-emnlp.59) |  | 0 | CLIP has demonstrated great versatility in adapting to various downstream tasks, such as image editing and generation, visual question answering, and video understanding. However, CLIP-based applications often suffer from misunderstandings regarding user intent, leading to discrepancies between the required number of objects and the actual outputs in image generation tasks. In this work, we empirically investigate the quantity bias in CLIP. By carefully designing different experimental settings and datasets, we comprehensively evaluate CLIP’s understanding of quantity from text, image, and cross-modal perspectives. Our experimental results reveal a quantity bias in CLIP embeddings, impacting the reliability of downstream tasks. | Zeliang Zhang, Zhuo Liu, Mingqian Feng, Chenliang Xu |  |

Traditional algorithms like A\* and its variants are capable of ensuring path validity but suffer from significant computational and memory inefficiencies as the state space grows. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) excel in broader environmental analysis through contextual understanding, providing global insights into environments. However, they fall short in detailed spatial and temporal reasoning, often leading to invalid or inefficient routes. In this work, we propose LLM-A\*, an new LLM based route planning method that synergistically combines the precise pathfinding capabilities of A\* with the global reasoning capability of LLMs. This hybrid approach aims to enhance pathfinding efficiency in terms of time and space complexity while maintaining the integrity of path validity,... | Silin Meng, Yiwei Wang, ChengFu Yang, Nanyun Peng, KaiWei Chang |  |

While approaches like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) have shown promise in enhancing LLMs’ reasoning capabilities, mitigating the influence of inaccurate commonsense knowledge remains a challenge, particularly for small-scale LLMs (e.g., those with less than 10B parameters). In this work, we propose a novel method named Guided Knowledge Generation (GuideKG) to address these issues. It presents three advantages: (i) Employing LLMs to generate knowledge explanations and to automatically assign labels based on the probability of correct answers eliminates the need for costly manual annotation in subsequent training. (ii) Training a new module called the ‘Know-Filter’, which is used to evaluate knowledge, and we have introduced a new loss to enhance its performance.

Most existing works adopt separate modules for retrieval and generation, which may be suboptimal since the retrieval task and the generation task cannot benefit from each other to improve performance. We propose a novel Backbone Shared RAG framework (BSharedRAG). It first uses a domain-specific corpus to continually pre-train a base model as a domain-specific backbone model and then trains two plug-and-play Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules based on the shared backbone to minimize retrieval and generation losses respectively. Experimental results indicate that our proposed BSharedRAG outperforms baseline models by 5% and 13% in Hit@3 upon two datasets in retrieval evaluation and by 23% in terms of BLEU-3 in generation evaluation. Our codes, models, and dataset are available at https://bsharedrag.github.io. | Kaisi Guan, Qian Cao, Yuchong Sun, Xiting Wang, Ruihua Song |  |

Recently, prompt learning methods have demonstrated success in IDRR. However, prior work primarily transform IDRR into a connective-cloze task based on the masked language model (MLM), which limits the predicted connective to one single token. Also, they fail to fully exploit critical semantic features shared among various forms of templates. In this paper, we propose NCPrompt, an NSP-based prompt learning and Contrastive learning method for IDRR. Specifically, we transform the IDRR task into a next sentence prediction (NSP) task, which can allow various-length answer connectives and enlarge the construction of the verbalizer for prompt-learning methods. Also, we notice that various prompt templates naturally constitute positive samples applied for self-supervised contrastive learning. And the usage of NSP naturally creates... | Yuetong Rong, Yijun Mo |  |

Current methods, primarily focused on binary safety classifications, lack mechanisms for detailed critique, limiting their utility for model improvement and user trust. To address these limitations, we introduce SAFETY-J, a bilingual generative safety evaluator for English and Chinese with critique-based judgment. SAFETY-J utilizes a robust training dataset that includes diverse dialogues and augmented query-response pairs to assess safety across various scenarios comprehensively. We establish an automated meta-evaluation benchmark that objectively assesses the quality of critiques with minimal human intervention, facilitating scalable and continuous improvement. Additionally, SAFETY-Jemploys an iterative preference learning technique to dynamically refine safety assessments based on... | Yixiu Liu, Yuxiang Zheng, Shijie Xia, Jiajun Li, Yi Tu, Chaoling Song, Pengfei Liu |  |

Previous studies have explored selecting relevant demonstrations from a human-labeled demonstration pool, but these methods lack diversity and incur high labeling costs. In this work, we address measuring and enhancing the diversity of the text-to-SQL demonstration pool. First, we introduce a diversity metric and present that the diversity of the existing labeling data can be further enhanced. Motivated by these findings, we propose Fused that iteratively fuses demonstrations to create a diverse demonstration pool based on human labeling or even from scratch with LLMs, reducing labeling costs. Fused achieves an average improvement of 2.1% based on existing labeling and 5.5% from scratch on several mainstream datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness. | Dingzirui Wang, Longxu Dou, Xuanliang Zhang, Qingfu Zhu, Wanxiang Che |  |

In this study, we propose a unified framework for systematically evaluating gender, race, and age biases in VLMs with respect to professions. Our evaluation encompasses all supported inference modes of the recent VLMs, including image-to-text, text-to-text, text-to-image, and image-to-image. We create a synthetic, high-quality dataset comprising text and images that intentionally obscure gender, race, and age distinctions across various professions. The dataset includes action-based descriptions of each profession and serves as a benchmark for evaluating societal biases in vision-language models (VLMs). In our benchmarking of popular vision-language models (VLMs), we observe that different input-output modalities result in distinct bias magnitudes and directions. We hope our work will help guide future progress in improving VLMs to learn socially unbiased representations. We will release our... | Ashutosh Sathe, Prachi Jain, Sunayana Sitaram |  |

However, existing approaches typically require designing separate models for each task, overlooking the potential connections between tasks and limiting the versatility of NER methods. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce a new task named Integrated Multimodal NER (IMNER) to break the boundaries between different modal NER tasks, enabling a unified implementation of them. To achieve this, we first design a unified data format for inputs from different modalities. Then, leveraging the pre-trained MMSpeech model as the backbone, we propose an \*\*I\*\*ntegrated \*\*M\*\*ultimod\*\*a\*\*l \*\*Ge\*\*neration Framework (\*\*IMAGE\*\*), formulating the Chinese IMNER task as an entity-aware text generation task.

However, existing VLMs often overly rely on internal text-based knowledge while neglecting visual inputs. This imbalance may lead models to produce answers that do not align with the visual content in GUI comprehension tasks. Such inaccuracies are termed as ‘hallucinations’ where models generate incorrect or illogical responses upon visual verification against GUI elements. These errors result in misinterpretations and diminish the model’s practical utility in applied settings. To address these issues, we introduce VGA, a fine-tuned model designed for comprehensive GUI understanding. Our model aims to balance attention image and text to enhance interpretation and reduce hallucinations.

The assessment of therapeutic alliance is well-established in traditional face-to-face therapy but may not directly translate to text-based settings. With millions of individuals seeking support through online text-based counseling, understanding the relationship in such contexts is crucial.In this paper, we present an automatic approach using large language models (LLMs) to understand the development of therapeutic alliance in text-based counseling. We adapt a theoretically grounded framework specifically to the context of online text-based counseling and develop comprehensive guidelines for characterizing the alliance. We collect a comprehensive counseling dataset and conduct multiple expert evaluations on a subset based on this framework.

When presented with a task goal, these agents typically emulate human actions within a GUI environment until the task is completed. However, a key challenge lies in devising effective plans to guide action prediction in GUI tasks, though planning have been widely recognized as effective for decomposing complex tasks into a series of steps. Specifically, given the dynamic nature of environmental GUIs following action execution, it is crucial to dynamically adapt plans based on environmental feedback and action history.We show that the widely-used ReAct approach fails due to the excessively long historical dialogues. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach called Dynamic Planning of Thoughts (D-PoT) for LLM-based GUI agents.D-PoT involves the dynamic adjustment of... | Shaoqing Zhang, Zhuosheng Zhang, Kehai Chen, Xinbei Ma, Muyun Yang, Tiejun Zhao, Min Zhang |  |

However, existing retrieval-augmented approaches face challenges in addressing diverse queries and documents, particularly for medical knowledge queries, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel plug-and-play LLM-based retrieval method called Self-Rewarding Tree Search (SeRTS) based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and a self-rewarding paradigm. By combining the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with the effectiveness of tree search, SeRTS boosts the zero-shot performance of retrieving high-quality and informative results for RAG. We further enhance retrieval performance by fine-tuning LLMs with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) objectives using the trajectories collected by SeRTS as feedback.

Despite this, LLM-based agents frequently demonstrate notable shortcomings in adjusting to dynamic environments and fully grasping human needs. In this work, we introduce the problem of LLM-based human-agent collaboration for complex task-solving, exploring their synergistic potential. To tackle the problem, we propose a Reinforcement Learning-based Human-Agent Collaboration method, ReHAC, which trains a policy model designed to determine the most opportune stages for human intervention within the task-solving process. We conduct experiments under real and simulated human-agent collaboration scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the synergistic efforts of humans and LLM-based agents significantly improve performance in complex tasks, primarily through well-planned, limited human intervention.

MM-MATH consists of 5,929 open-ended middle school math problems with visual contexts, with fine-grained classification across difficulty, grade level, and knowledge points. Unlike existing benchmarks relying on binary answer comparison, MM-MATH incorporates both outcome and process evaluations. Process evaluation employs LMM-as-a-judge to automatically analyze solution steps, identifying and categorizing errors into specific error types. Extensive evaluation of ten models on MM-MATH reveals significant challenges for existing LMMs, highlighting their limited utilization of visual information and struggles with higher-difficulty problems. The best-performing model achieves only 31% accuracy on MM-MATH, compared to 82% for humans.

To address this, we present LongAlign—a recipe of the instruction data, training, and evaluation for long context alignment. First, we construct a long instruction-following dataset using Self-Instruct. To ensure the data diversity, it covers a broad range of tasks from various long context sources. Second, we adopt the packing and sorted batching strategies to speed up supervised fine-tuning on data with varied length distributions. Additionally, we develop a loss weighting method to balance the contribution to the loss across different sequences during packing training. Third, we introduce the LongBench-Chat benchmark for evaluating instruction-following capabilities on queries of 10k-100k in length. Experiments show that LongAlign outperforms existing recipes for LLMs in long context tasks by up to 30%, while also maintaining their proficiency... | Yushi Bai, Xin Lv, Jiajie Zhang, Yuze He, Ji Qi, Lei Hou, Jie Tang, Yuxiao Dong, Juanzi Li |  |

We introduce AskGNN, a novel approach that bridges this gap by leveraging In-Context Learning (ICL) to integrate graph data and task-specific information into LLMs. AskGNN employs a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-powered structure-enhanced retriever to select labeled nodes across graphs, incorporating complex graph structures and their supervision signals. Our learning-to-retrieve algorithm optimizes the retriever to select example nodes that maximize LLM performance on graph. Experiments across three tasks and seven LLMs demonstrate AskGNN’s superior effectiveness in graph task performance, opening new avenues for applying LLMs to graph-structured data without extensive fine-tuning. | Zhengyu Hu, Yichuan Li, Zhengyu Chen, Jingang Wang, Han Liu, Kyumin Lee, Kaize Ding |  |

Such systems can provide answers to user questions about explanations in dialogues, have the potential to enhance users’ comprehension and offer more information about the decision-making and generation processes of LLMs. Currently available ConvXAI systems are based on intent recognition rather than free chat, as this has been found to be more precise and reliable in identifying users’ intentions. However, the recognition of intents still presents a challenge in the case of ConvXAI, since little training data exist and the domain is highly specific, as there is a broad range of XAI methods to map requests onto. In order to bridge this gap, we present CoXQL, the first dataset in the NLP domain for user intent recognition in ConvXAI, covering 31... | Qianli Wang, Tatiana Anikina, Nils Feldhus, Simon Ostermann, Sebastian Möller |  |

We formalise a behaviourist view of LM character traits: qualities such as truthfulness, sycophancy, and coherent beliefs and intentions, which may manifest as consistent patterns of behaviour. Our theory is grounded in empirical demonstrations of LMs exhibiting different character traits, such as accurate and logically coherent beliefs and helpful and harmless intentions. We infer belief and intent from LM behaviour, finding their consistency varies with model size, fine-tuning, and prompting. In addition to characterising LM character traits, we evaluate how these traits develop over the course of an interaction. We find that traits such as truthfulness and harmfulness can be stationary, i.e., consistent over an interaction, in certain contexts but may be reflective in different contexts, meaning they mirror the LM’s behaviour in the preceding... | Francis Rhys Ward, Zejia Yang, Alex Jackson, Randy Brown, Chandler Smith, Grace Colverd, Louis Thomson, Raymond Douglas, Patrik Bartak, Andrew Rowan |  |

However, acquiring human-authored solutions or augmenting rationales from proprietary models is costly and not scalable. In this paper, we study the problem of whether LLMs could self-improve mathematical reasoning capabilities. To this end, we propose Self-Explore, where the LLM is tasked to explore the first wrong step (i.e., the first pit) within the rationale and use such signals as fine-grained rewards for further improvement. On the GSM8K and MATH test set, Self-Explore achieves 11.57% and 2.89% improvement on average across three LLMs compared to supervised fine-tuning (SFT).

Despite this, these LLM agents introduce unexpected safety risks when operating in interactive environments. Instead of centering on the harmlessness of LLM-generated content in most prior studies, this work addresses the imperative need for benchmarking the behavioral safety of LLM agents within diverse environments. We introduce R-Judge, a benchmark crafted to evaluate the proficiency of LLMs in judging and identifying safety risks given agent interaction records. R-Judge comprises 569 records of multi-turn agent interaction, encompassing 27 key risk scenarios among 5 application categories and 10 risk types. It is of high-quality curation with annotated safety labels and risk descriptions.

While existing methods often prioritize the development of effective models to improve extraction performance, there has been limited emphasis on extraction efficiency. However, in real-world scenarios, products are typically associated with multiple attributes, necessitating multiple extractions to obtain all corresponding values. In this work, we propose an Efficient product Attribute Value Extraction (EAVE) approach via lightweight sparse-layer interaction. Specifically, we employ a heavy encoder to separately encode the product context and attribute. The resulting non-interacting heavy representations of the context can be cached and reused for all attributes. Additionally, we introduce a light encoder to jointly encode the context and the attribute, facilitating lightweight interactions between them.

Recent LMMs have shown various intriguing abilities, such as solving graph theory problems and explaining visual jokes. However, existing multimodal benchmarks have mainly focused on coarse-grained evaluation (e.g., accuracy), without considering the skill composition required by specific instructions. To this end, we present MultiSkill, designed to decompose coarse-level scoring to a fine-grained skill set-level scoring tailored to each instruction. MultiSkill defines five core vision-language capabilities and divides into 12 skills that are necessary to align with user instructions. For evaluation metrics on specific skills, we propose an LMM-based evaluator for open-ended outputs.

Towards Practical Knowledge Unlearning for Large Language Models](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.findings-emnlp.82) |  | 0 | Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on extensive corpora inevitably retain sensitive data, such as personal privacy information and copyrighted material. Recent advancements in knowledge unlearning involve updating LLM parameters to erase specific knowledge. However, current unlearning paradigms are mired in vague forgetting boundaries, often erasing knowledge indiscriminately. In this work, we introduce KnowUnDo, a benchmark containing copyrighted content and user privacy domains to evaluate if the unlearning process inadvertently erases essential knowledge. Our findings indicate that existing unlearning methods often suffer from excessive unlearning. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective method, MemFlex, which utilizes gradient information to precisely target and unlearn sensitive parameters. Experimental results show that MemFlex is superior to existing methods in both precise knowledge unlearning and general knowledge retaining of LLMs. | Bozhong Tian, Xiaozhuan Liang, Siyuan Cheng, Qingbin Liu, Mengru Wang, Dianbo Sui, Xi Chen, Huajun Chen, Ningyu Zhang |  |

In this paper, we introduce \*\*EchoSight\*\*, a novel multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that enables large language models (LLMs) to answer visual questions requiring fine-grained encyclopedic knowledge. To strive for high-performing retrieval, EchoSight first searches wiki articles by using visual-only information, subsequently, these candidate articles are further reranked according to their relevance to the combined text-image query. This approach significantly improves the integration of multimodal knowledge, leading to enhanced retrieval outcomes and more accurate VQA responses. Our experimental results on the E-VQA and InfoSeek datasets demonstrate that EchoSight establishes new... | Yibin Yan, Weidi Xie |  |

However, we discover that a single knowledge generation strategy is often insuffcient for all K-VQA questions. To this end, we propose Diversifcation, Evidence Truncation, and Combination for Knowledge-based Elucidation (DietCoke), which utilizes a bundle of complementary question-answering tactics and aggregates their answers using textual rationales. DietCoke comprises of three stages: diversifcation, rationalization, and ensemble. The diversification stage generates three distinctive decision contexts, each leading to its own answer candidate. The rationalization stage generates two rationales, the automatic rationale and the mechanistic rationale, for each answer candidate using decorrelated techniques. Finally, in the ensemble stage, an LLM informed by the rationales selects one answer from the three candidates. Experiments show that DietCoke significantly outperforms... | Miaoyu Li, Haoxin Li, Zilin Du, Boyang Li |  |

While previous efforts to elicit and calibrate confidence scores have shown some success, they often overlook biases towards certain groups, such as specific nationalities. Existing calibration methods typically focus on average performance, failing to address this disparity. In our study, we demonstrate that the concept of grouping loss is an effective metric for understanding and correcting the heterogeneity in confidence levels. We introduce a novel evaluation dataset, derived from a knowledge base, specifically designed to assess the confidence scores of LLM responses across different groups. Our experimental results highlight significant variations in confidence, which are accurately captured by grouping loss. To tackle this issue, we propose a new method to calibrate the confidence scores of LLMs by considering different groups, a process we term... | Lihu Chen, Alexandre PerezLebel, Fabian M.

In this study, we delve into these drawbacks and demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) remain susceptible to these problems. This study systematically investigates these challenges and their impact on LLMs through three critical research questions: (1) complex problem solving, (2) token structure probing, and (3) resilience to typographical variation. Our findings reveal that scaling model parameters can mitigate the issue of tokenization; however, LLMs still suffer from biases induced by typos and other text format variations. Our experiments show that subword regularization such as BPE-dropout can mitigate this issue. We release our evaluation code and data at... | Yekun Chai, Yewei Fang, Qiwei Peng, Xuhong Li |  |

To meet this need, we present AC-EVAL, an innovative benchmark designed to assess the advanced knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs within the context of ancient Chinese. AC-EVAL is structured across three levels of difficulty reflecting different facets of language comprehension: general historical knowledge, short text understanding, and long text comprehension. The benchmark comprises 13 tasks, spanning historical facts, geography, social customs, art, philosophy, classical poetry and prose, providing a comprehensive assessment framework. Our extensive evaluation of top-performing LLMs, tailored for both English and Chinese, reveals a substantial potential for enhancing ancient text comprehension.

In the most challenging setting, cross-lingual anaphora resolution, training data, and test data are in different languages. As knowledge needs to be transferred across languages, this task is challenging, both in the multilingual and cross-lingual setting. We hypothesize that one way to alleviate some of the difficulty of the task is to include multimodal information in the form of images (i.e. frames extracted from instructional videos). Such visual inputs are by nature language agnostic, therefore cross- and multilingual anaphora resolution should benefit from visual information. In this paper, we provide the first multilingual and multimodal dataset annotated with anaphoric relations and present experimental results for end-to-end multimodal and multilingual anaphora resolution. Given gold mentions, multimodal features improve... | Cennet Oguz, Pascal Denis, Simon Ostermann, Emmanuel Vincent, Natalia Skachkova, Josef van Genabith |  |

Psychological research aims at explaining and documenting internal mechanisms of these phenomena, while computational work often simplifies them into labels. Many emotion fundamentals remain under-explored in natural language processing, particularly how emotions develop and how people cope with them. To help reduce this gap, we follow theories on coping, and treat emotions as strategies to cope with salient situations (i.e., how people deal with emotion-eliciting events). This approach allows us to investigate the link between emotions and behavior, which also emerges in language. We introduce the task of coping identification, together with a corpus to do so, constructed via role-playing. We find that coping strategies realize in text even though they are challenging to recognize, both for humans and automatic systems trained and prompted on the same task. We thus open up a promising research direction... | Enrica Troiano, Sofie Labat, Marco Stranisci, Rossana Damiano, Viviana Patti, Roman Klinger |  |

This focus limits their ability to handle complex text interactions, particularly with longer texts such as lengthy captions or documents, which have not been extensively explored yet. In this paper, we introduce Meet At The Embedding (MATE), a novel approach that combines the capabilities of VLMs with Large Language Models (LLMs) to overcome this challenge without the need for additional image-long text pairs. Specifically, we replace the text encoder of the VLM with a pretrained LLM-based encoder that excels in understanding long texts. To bridge the gap between VLM and LLM, MATE incorporates a projection module that is trained in a multi-stage manner. It starts by aligning the embeddings from the VLM text encoder with those from the LLM using extensive text pairs. This module is... | Young Kyun Jang, Junmo Kang, Yong Jae Lee, Donghyun Kim |  |

Previous distillation methods usually utilize the capabilities of LLMs to generate chain-of-thought (CoT) samples to teach SLMs. However, this distillation approach performs poorly in certain scenarios due to the limitations of CoT. In this work, we introduce a novel Mixed Distillation (MD) framework, distilling multiple step-by-step reasoning abilities into SLMs. First, we leverage LLMs to generate multiple step-by-step reasoning rationales by sampling automatically. Then, we create high-quality, well-balanced mixed thought data and design a novel multi-task loss to help SLMs better learn and adaptively activate multiple step-by-step reasoning. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MD enhances both... | Chenglin Li, Qianglong Chen, Liangyue Li, Caiyu Wang, Feng Tao, Yicheng Li, Zulong Chen, Yin Zhang |  |

Evaluating this ability comes with significant challenges: (i) limited coherence between multiple instructions, (ii) positional bias where the order of instructions affects model performance, and (iii) a lack of objectively verifiable tasks. To address these issues, we introduce a benchmark designed to evaluate models’ abilities to follow multiple instructions through sequential instruction following (SIFo) tasks. In SIFo, the successful completion of multiple instructions is verifiable by examining only the final instruction. Our benchmark evaluates instruction following using four tasks (text modification, question answering, mathematics, and security rule following), each assessing different aspects of sequential instruction following. Our evaluation of popular LLMs, both closed-source and open-source, shows that more recent and larger models significantly outperform their older and smaller... | Xinyi Chen, Baohao Liao, Jirui Qi, Panagiotis Eustratiadis, Christof Monz, Arianna Bisazza, Maarten de Rijke |  |

Extensive research has highlighted the quality of instruction data is essential for the success of this alignment. However, creating high-quality data manually is labor-intensive and time-consuming, which leads researchers to explore using LLMs to synthesize data. Recent studies have focused on using a stronger LLM to iteratively enhance existing instruction data, showing promising results. Nevertheless, previous work often lacks control over the evolution direction, resulting in high uncertainty in the data synthesis process and low-quality instructions. In this paper, we introduce a general and scalable framework, IDEA-MCTS (Instruction Data Enhancement using Monte Carlo Tree Search), a scalable framework for efficiently synthesizing instructions. With tree search and evaluation models, it can efficiently guide each instruction to evolve into a high-quality form,... | Chenglin Li, Qianglong Chen, Zhi Li, Feng Tao, Yicheng Li, Hao Chen, Fei Yu, Yin Zhang |  |

In this work, we explore multi-constraint instruction following for generating long-form text. We create Suri, a dataset with 20K human-written long-form texts paired with LLM-generated backtranslated instructions that contain multiple complex constraints. Because of prohibitive challenges associated with collecting human preference judgments on long-form texts, preference-tuning algorithms such as DPO are infeasible in our setting; thus, we propose Instructional ORPO (I-ORPO), an alignment method based on the ORPO algorithm. Instead of receiving negative feedback from dispreferred responses, I-ORPO obtains negative feedback from synthetically corrupted instructions generated by an LLM. Using Suri, we perform supervised and I-ORPO fine-tuning on Mistral-7b-Instruct-v0.2. The resulting models, Suri-SFT and Suri-I-ORPO, generate significantly longer texts (5K tokens) than... | Chau Pham, Simeng Sun, Mohit Iyyer |  |

However, their use in the medical field can be challenging due to their lack of specific, in-depth knowledge. In this study, we present a system called LLMs Augmented with Medical Textbooks (LLM-AMT) designed to enhance the proficiency of LLMs in specialized domains. LLM-AMT integrates authoritative medical textbooks into the LLMs’ framework using plug-and-play modules. These modules include a Query Augmenter, a Hybrid Textbook Retriever, and a Knowledge Self-Refiner. Together, they incorporate authoritative medical knowledge. Additionally, an LLM Reader aids in contextual understanding. Our experimental results on three medical QA tasks demonstrate that LLM-AMT significantly improves response quality, with accuracy gains ranging from 11.6% to 16.6%. Notably, with GPT-4-Turbo as the base model, LLM-AMT outperforms the specialized Med-PaLM 2 model... | Yubo Wang, Xueguang Ma, Wenhu Chen |  |

In this paper, we extend this investigation to a multilingual context, with a specific focus on human values-related concepts (i.e., value concepts) due to their significance for AI safety. Through our comprehensive exploration covering 7 types of human values, 16 languages and 3 LLM series with distinct multilinguality (e.g., monolingual, bilingual and multilingual), we first empirically confirm the presence of value concepts within LLMs in a multilingual format. Further analysis on the cross-lingual characteristics of these concepts reveals 3 traits arising from language resource disparities: cross-lingual inconsistency, distorted linguistic relationships, and unidirectional cross-lingual transfer between high- and low-resource languages, all in terms of value concepts. Moreover, we validate the feasibility of... | Shaoyang Xu, Weilong Dong, Zishan Guo, Xinwei Wu, Deyi Xiong |  |

This inclusion can lead to cheatingly high scores on model leaderboards, yet result in disappointing performance in real-world applications. To address this benchmark contamination problem, we first propose a set of requirements that practical contamination detection methods should follow. Following these proposed requirements, we introduce PaCoST, a Paired Confidence Significance Testing to effectively detect benchmark contamination in LLMs. Our method constructs a counterpart for each piece of data with the same distribution, and performs statistical analysis of the corresponding confidence to test whether the model is significantly more confident under the original benchmark. We validate the effectiveness of PaCoST and apply it on popular open-source models and benchmarks. We find that almost all models and benchmarks... | Huixuan Zhang, Yun Lin, Xiaojun Wan |  |

Despite the proliferation of numerous specialized AI models within spatio-temporal context of location-based services, these models struggle to autonomously tackle problems regarding complex urban planing and management. To bridge this gap, we introduce UrbanLLM, a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) designed to tackle diverse problems in urban scenarios. UrbanLLM functions as a problem- solver by decomposing urban-related queries into manageable sub-tasks, identifying suitable spatio-temporal AI models for each sub-task, and generating comprehensive responses to the given queries. Our experimental results indicate that UrbanLLM significantly outperforms other established LLMs, such as Llama and the GPT series, in handling problems concerning complex urban activity planning and management.

However, in the thriving open-source Large Language Model (LLM) community, ensembling methods are rare and typically limited to ensembling the full-text outputs of LLMs, such as selecting the best output using a ranker, which leads to underutilization of token-level probability information. In this paper, we treat the \*\*G\*\*eneration of each token by LLMs \*\*a\*\*s a \*\*C\*\*lassification (\*\*GaC\*\*) for ensembling. This approach fully exploits the probability information at each generation step and better prevents LLMs from producing early incorrect tokens that lead to snowballing errors.

We design several ways to provide auxiliary functions to the models by adding them to the query or providing a response prefix to incorporate the ability to utilize auxiliary functions with the instruction-following capability. Our experimental results show the effectiveness of combining the base models’ auxiliary function utilization ability with the instruction following ability. In particular, the performance of adopting our approaches with the open-sourced language models surpasses that of the recent powerful language models, i.e., gpt-4o. | Seonghyeon Lee, Suyeon Kim, Joonwon Jang, Heejae Chon, Dongha Lee, Hwanjo Yu |  |

Answers to open-ended questions are highly diverse and difficult to quantify, and cannot be simply evaluated as correct or incorrect, unlike close-ended questions with definitive answers. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities across various tasks, they exhibit relatively weaker performance in evaluating answers to open-ended questions. In this study, we propose a method that leverages LLMs and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to assess answers to open-ended questions. We utilized LLMs to generate multiple evaluation criteria for a question. Subsequently, answers were subjected to pairwise comparisons under each criterion with LLMs, and scores for each answer were calculated in the AHP. We conducted experiments on four datasets using both ChatGPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4.

On the other hand, Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in tasks like Visual Question Answering (VQA) but remain underexplored in the context of fine-grained image classification. This paper presents CascadeVLM, a novel framework that harnesses the complementary strengths of both CLIP-like and LVLMs VLMs to tackle these challenges. Using granular knowledge effectively in LVLMs and integrating a cascading approach, CascadeVLM dynamically allocates samples using an entropy threshold, balancing computational efficiency with classification accuracy.

In this paper, we thoroughly explore the best practice of leveraging LLMs for query expansion. To this end, we introduce a training-free, straightforward yet effective framework called Multi-Text Generation Integration (MuGI). This approach leverages LLMs to generate multiple pseudo-references, which are then integrated with the original queries to enhance both sparse and dense retrieval methods. Additionally, we introduce a retrieval pipeline based on MuGI, which combines the strengths of sparse and dense retrievers to achieve superior performance without the need for costly pre-indexing. Our empirical findings reveal that: (1) Increasing the number of samples from LLMs benefits IR systems; (2) A balance between the query and pseudo-documents, and an effective integration strategy, is critical for high performance; (3) Contextual information from LLMs is essential, even... | Le Zhang, Yihong Wu, Qian Yang, JianYun Nie |  |

To mitigate these issues, we propose the Chain-of-Rewrite method, which leverages the guidance and feedback gained from the analysis to provide faithful and consistent extensions for effective question answering. Through a two-step rewriting process comprising Semantic Analysis and Semantic Augmentation, the Chain-of-Rewrite method effectively bridges the gap between the user question and relevant documents. By incorporating feedback from the rewriting process, our method can self-correct the retrieval and reading process to further improve the performance. Experiments on four open-domain question answering datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our system under zero-shot settings. | Chunlei Xin, Yaojie Lu, Hongyu Lin, Shuheng Zhou, Huijia Zhu, Weiqiang Wang, Zhongyi Liu, Xianpei Han, Le Sun |  |

Traditional methods often rely on coarse-grained clause-level annotations, which can overlook valuable fine-grained clues. To address this issue, we propose Multi-Granularity Clue Learning (MGCL), a novel approach designed to capture fine-grained emotion-cause clues from a weakly-supervised perspective efficiently. In MGCL, a teacher model is leveraged to give sub-clause clues without needing fine-grained annotated labels and guides a student model to identify clause-level emotion-cause pairs. Furthermore, we explore domain-invariant extra-clause clues under the teacher model’s advice to enhance the learning process. Experimental results on the benchmark dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while offering improved interpretability. | Yang Yu, Xin Lin, Changqun Li, Shizhou Huang, Liang He |  |

In this work, we investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of LLM-based data generation in the challenging setting of source-grounded information-seeking dialogs, with response attribution, over long documents. Our source texts consist of long and noisy meeting transcripts, adding to the task complexity. Since automating attribution remains difficult, we propose a semi-automatic approach: dialog queries and responses are generated with LLMs, followed by human verification and identification of attribution spans. Using this approach, we created MISeD – Meeting Information Seeking Dialogs dataset – a dataset of information-seeking dialogs focused on meeting transcripts. Models finetuned with MISeD demonstrate superior performance compared to off-the-shelf models, even those of larger size. Finetuning on MISeD gives comparable response generation quality to finetuning on fully manual data,... | Lotem Golany, Filippo Galgani, Maya Mamo, Nimrod Parasol, Omer Vandsburger, Nadav Bar, Ido Dagan |  |

However, while existing methods primarily focus on unimodal language models, the question decomposition capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has yet to be explored. To this end, this paper explores visual question decomposition on MLLMs. Specifically, we introduce a systematic evaluation framework including a dataset and several evaluation criteria to assess the quality of the decomposed sub-questions, revealing that existing MLLMs struggle to produce high-quality sub-questions. To address this limitation, we propose a specific finetuning dataset, DecoVQA+, for enhancing the model’s question decomposition capability. Aiming at enabling models to perform appropriate selective decomposition, we propose an efficient finetuning pipeline.

This variability poses challenges for accurate assessment and user satisfaction. Current research frequently overlooks instance-level prompt variations and their implications on subjective evaluations. To address these shortcomings, we introduce ProSA, a framework designed to evaluate and comprehend prompt sensitivity in LLMs. ProSA incorporates a novel sensitivity metric, PromptSensiScore, and leverages decoding confidence to elucidate underlying mechanisms. Our extensive study, spanning multiple tasks, uncovers that prompt sensitivity fluctuates across datasets and models, with larger models exhibiting enhanced robustness. We observe that few-shot examples can alleviate this sensitivity issue, and subjective evaluations are also susceptible to prompt sensitivities, particularly in complex, reasoning-oriented tasks.... | Jingming Zhuo, Songyang Zhang, Xinyu Fang, Haodong Duan, Dahua Lin, Kai Chen |  |

However, a common limitation in most PEFT approaches is their application of a uniform architectural design across all layers. This uniformity involves identical trainable modules and ignores the varying importance of each layer, leading to sub-optimal fine-tuning results. To overcome the above limitation and obtain better performance, we develop a novel approach, Importance-aware Sparse Tuning (IST), to fully utilize the inherent sparsity and select the most important subset of full layers with effective layer-wise importance scoring. The proposed IST is a versatile and plug-and-play technique compatible with various PEFT methods that operate on a per-layer basis. By leveraging the estimated importance scores, IST dynamically updates... | Kai Yao, Penglei Gao, Lichun Li, Yuan Zhao, Xiaofeng Wang, Wei Wang, Jianke Zhu |  |

However, eliciting language models to perform reasoning with abstraction remains unexplored. This paper seeks to bridge this gap by introducing a novel structured reasoning format called Abstraction-of-Thought (AoT). The uniqueness of AoT lies in its explicit requirement for varying levels of abstraction within the reasoning process. This approach could elicit language models to first contemplate on the abstract level before incorporating concrete details, which is overlooked by the prevailing step-by-step Chain-of-Thought (CoT) method. To align models with the AoT format, we present AoT Collection, a generic finetuning dataset consisting of 348k high-quality samples with AoT reasoning processes, collected via an automated and scalable pipeline. We finetune a wide range of language models with AoT Collection and conduct extensive evaluations on 23... | Ruixin Hong, Hongming Zhang, Xiaoman Pan, Dong Yu, Changshui Zhang |  |

However, current phonetic fieldwork relies on manual effort, resulting in substantial time and financial costs. This is especially challenging for the numerous endangered languages that are rapidly disappearing, often compounded by limited funding. In this paper, we introduce pitch-based similarity representations for tone transcription, named Tone2Vec. Experiments on dialect clustering and variance show that Tone2Vec effectively captures fine-grained tone variation. Utilizing Tone2Vec, we develop the first automatic approach for tone transcription and clustering by presenting a novel representation transformation for transcriptions. Additionally, these algorithms are systematically integrated into an open-sourced and easy-to-use package, ToneLab, which facilitates automated fieldwork and cross-regional, cross-lexical analysis for tonal languages. Extensive experiments were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our... | Yi Yang, Yiming Wang, Zhiqiang Tang, Jiahong Yuan |  |

Prior efforts to measure conversational empathy mostly focus on expressed communicative intents—that is, the way empathy is expressed. Yet, these works ignore the fact that conversation is also a collaboration involving both speakers and listeners. In contrast, we propose a multi-dimensional empathy evaluation framework to measure both expressed intents from the speaker’s perspective and perceived empathy from the listener’s perspective. We apply our analytical framework to examine internal customer-service dialogues. We find the two dimensions (expressed intent types and perceived empathy) are interconnected, while perceived empathy has high correlations with dialogue satisfaction levels.To reduce the annotation cost, we explore different options to automatically measure conversational empathy: prompting LLMs and training language model-based classifiers. Our experiments show that prompting methods with... | Zhichao Xu, Jiepu Jiang |  |

Particularly in translating complex data points composed of multiple components, it is common to translate each component separately. However, we argue that this practice often overlooks the interrelation between components within the same data point. To address this limitation, we propose a novel MT pipeline that considers the intra-data relation. in implementing MT for training data. In our MT pipeline, all the components in a data point are concatenated to form a single translation sequence and subsequently reconstructed to the data components after translation. We introduce a Catalyst Statement (CS) to enhance the intra-data relation, and Indicator Token (IT) to assist the decomposition of a translated sequence into its respective data components. Through our approach, we have achieved a considerable improvement in translation quality itself, along with its effectiveness as... | Hyeonseok Moon, Seungyoon Lee, Seongtae Hong, Seungjun Lee, Chanjun Park, Heuiseok Lim |  |

Although Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) proves effective, it is complicated and highly resource-intensive. As such, offline RLHF has been introduced as an alternative solution, which directly optimizes LLMs with ranking losses on a fixed preference dataset. Current offline RLHF only captures the ordering relationship between responses, overlooking the crucial aspect of “how much” one is preferred over the others. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective solution based on reward difference prediction. Specifically, we introduce reward difference coefficients to reweigh sample pairs in offline RLHF. We then propose a difference model that considers rich interactions between a pair of responses for predicting these difference coefficients. Experiments with 7B LLMs on the HH and TL;DR dataset verify the effectiveness of our method in... | Shiqi Wang, Zhengze Zhang, Rui Zhao, Fei Tan, CamTu Nguyen |  |

In this work, we introduce AgentBank, by far the largest trajectory tuning data collection featuring more than 50k diverse high-quality interaction trajectories which comprises 16 tasks covering five distinct agent skill dimensions. Leveraging a novel annotation pipeline, we are able to scale the annotated trajectories and generate a trajectory dataset with minimized difficulty bias. Furthermore, we fine-tune LLMs on AgentBank to get a series of agent models, Samoyed. Our comparative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of scaling the interaction trajectory data to acquire generalized agent capabilities. Additional studies also reveal some key observations regarding trajectory tuning and agent skill generalization. | Yifan Song, Weimin Xiong, Xiutian Zhao, Dawei Zhu, Wenhao Wu, Ke Wang, Cheng Li, Wei Peng, Sujian Li |  |

However, when LLMs face different types of questions, it is worth exploring whether LLMs are aware that some questions have limited answers and need to respond more deterministically but some do not. We refer to this as question awareness of LLMs. The lack of question awareness in LLMs leads to two phenomena that LLMs are: (1) too casual to answer non-open-ended questions or (2) too boring to answer open-ended questions. In this paper, we first evaluate the question awareness in LLMs. The experimental results show that LLMs have the issues of lacking awareness of questions in certain domains, e.g. factual knowledge, resulting in hallucinations during the generation. To mitigate these, we propose a method called Question Awareness Temperature Sampling (QuATS). This method enhances the question awareness of LLMs by adaptively adjusting the output distributions based on... | Dongjie Yang, Hai Zhao |  |

A key challenge is to develop steerable language models that trade-off multiple (conflicting) objectives in a flexible and efficient manner. This paper presents Conditional Language Policy (CLP), a general framework for finetuning language models on multiple objectives. Building on techniques from multi-task training and parameter-efficient finetuning, CLP learn steerable models that effectively trade-off conflicting objectives at \*inference time\*. Notably, this does not require training or maintaining multiple models to achieve different trade-offs between the objectives. Through extensive experiments and ablations on two summarization datasets, we show that CLP learns steerable language models that outperform and Pareto-dominate the existing approaches for multi-objective | Kaiwen Wang, Rahul Kidambi, Ryan Sullivan, Alekh Agarwal, Christoph Dann, Andrea Michi, Marco Gelmi, Yunxuan Li, Raghav Gupta, Avinava Dubey, Alexandre Ramé, Johan Ferret, Geoffrey Cideron, Le Hou, Hongkun Yu, Amr Ahmed, Aranyak Mehta, Léonard Hussenot, Olivier Bachem, Edouard Leurent |  |

Nonetheless, the ongoing challenge of integrating long-tail knowledge continues to impede the seamless adoption of LLMs in specialized domains. In this work, we introduce DALK, a.k.a. Dynamic Co-Augmentation of LLMs and KG, to address this limitation and demonstrate its ability on studying Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), a specialized sub-field in biomedicine and a global health priority. With a synergized framework of LLM and KG mutually enhancing each other, we first leverage LLM to construct an evolving AD-specific knowledge graph (KG) sourced from AD-related scientific literature, and then we utilize a coarse-to-fine sampling method with a novel self-aware knowledge retrieval approach to select appropriate knowledge from the KG to augment LLM inference capabilities.

A proposed deployment use case is psychotherapy, where a LLM-powered chatbot can treat a patient undergoing a mental health crisis. Deployment of LLMs for mental health response could hypothetically broaden access to psychotherapy and provide new possibilities for personalizing care. However, recent high-profile failures, like damaging dieting advice offered by the Tessa chatbot to patients with eating disorders, have led to doubt about their reliability in high-stakes and safety-critical settings.In this work, we develop an evaluation framework for determining whether LLM response is a viable and ethical path forward for the automation of mental health treatment. Our framework measures equity in empathy and adherence of LLM responses to motivational interviewing theory.

Previous research has shown that existing models, when trained on EQA datasets that include unanswerable questions, demonstrate a significant lack of robustness against distribution shifts and adversarial attacks. Despite this, the inclusion of unanswerable questions in EQA training datasets is essential for ensuring real-world reliability. Our proposed training method includes a novel loss function for the EQA problem and challenges an implicit assumption present in numerous EQA datasets. Models trained with our method maintain in-domain performance while achieving a notable improvement on out-of-domain datasets. This results in an overall F1 score improvement of 5.7 across all testing sets. Furthermore, our models exhibit significantly enhanced robustness against two types of adversarial attacks, with a performance decrease of only about one-third compared to the... | Son Tran, Matt Kretchmar |  |

This paper investigates self-supervised learning for voice conversion to create native-sounding polyglot voices. We introduce a novel cross-lingual any-to-one voice conversion system that is able to preserve the source accent without the need for multilingual data from the target speaker. In addition, we show a novel cross-lingual fine-tuning strategy that further improves the accent and reduces the training data requirements. Objective and subjective evaluations with English, Spanish, French and Mandarin Chinese confirm that our approach improves on state-of-the-art methods, enhancing the speech intelligibility and overall quality of the converted speech, especially in cross-lingual scenarios.

However, previous approaches that distill intentions from LMs often fail to generate meaningful and human-centric intentions applicable in real-world E-commerce contexts. This raises concerns about the true comprehension and utilization of purchase intentions by LMs. In this paper, we present IntentionQA, a double-task multiple-choice question answering benchmark to evaluate LMs’ comprehension of purchase intentions in E-commerce. Specifically, LMs are tasked to infer intentions based on purchased products and utilize them to predict additional purchases. IntentionQA consists of 4,360 carefully curated problems across three difficulty levels, constructed using an automated pipeline to ensure scalability on large E-commerce platforms.

Diverging from traditional benchmarks that predict subsequent events individually, EconLogicQA poses a more challenging task: it requires models to discern and sequence multiple interconnected events, capturing the complexity of economic logics. EconLogicQA comprises an array of multi-event scenarios derived from economic articles, which necessitate an insightful understanding of both temporal and logical event relationships. Through comprehensive evaluations, we exhibit that EconLogicQA effectively gauges a LLM’s proficiency in navigating the sequential complexities inherent in economic contexts. We provide a detailed description of EconLogicQA dataset and shows the outcomes from evaluating the benchmark across various leading-edge LLMs, thereby offering a... | Yinzhu Quan, Zefang Liu |  |

Using the MMLU dataset, we show that the base-rate probability (BRP) differences across answer tokens are significant and affect task performance ie. guess A if uncertain. We find that counterfactual prompting does sufficiently mitigate the BRP effect. The BRP effect is found to have a similar effect to test taking strategies employed by humans leading to the conflation of task performance and test-taking ability. We propose the Nvr-X-MMLU task, a variation of MMLU, which helps to disambiguate test-taking ability from task performance and reports the latter. | Kyle Moore, Jesse Roberts, Thao Pham, Oseremhen Ewaleifoh, Douglas H.

The resulting “graph LLMs” are evaluated with in-distribution settings only, thus it remains underexplored whether LLMs are learning generalizable graph reasoning skills or merely memorizing patterns in the synthetic training data. To this end, we propose the NLGift benchmark, an evaluation suite of LLM graph reasoning generalization: whether LLMs could go beyond semantic, numeric, structural, reasoning patterns in the synthetic training data and improve utility on real-world graph-based tasks. Extensive experiments with two LLMs across four graph reasoning tasks demonstrate that while generalization on simple patterns (semantic, numeric) is somewhat satisfactory, LLMs struggle to generalize across reasoning and real-world patterns, casting doubt on the benefit of... | Yizhuo Zhang, Heng Wang, Shangbin Feng, Zhaoxuan Tan, Xiaochuang Han, Tianxing He, Yulia Tsvetkov |  |

However, most Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) datasets are predominantly in English, limiting model performance in other languages. Traditional methods for creating multilingual IFT datasets—such as translating existing English IFT datasets or converting existing NLP datasets into IFT datasets by templating—struggle to capture linguistic nuances and ensure prompt (instruction) diversity. To address this issue, we propose a novel method for collecting multilingual IFT datasets that preserves linguistic naturalness and ensures prompt diversity. This approach leverages English-focused LLMs, monolingual corpora, and a scoring function to create high-quality, diversified IFT datasets in multiple languages. Experiments demonstrate that LLMs finetuned using these IFT datasets show notable improvements in both generative and discriminative tasks, indicating enhanced language... | Sathish Reddy Indurthi, Wenxuan Zhou, Shamil Chollampatt, Ravi Agrawal, Kaiqiang Song, Lingxiao Zhao, Chenguang Zhu |  |

Recent state-of-the-art methods approach this task by first extracting all possible text spans from a given text, then filtering the potential aspect and opinion phrases with a classifier, and finally considering all their pairs with another classifier that additionally assigns sentiment polarity to them. Although several variations of the above scheme have been proposed, the common feature is that the final result is constructed by a sequence of independent classifier decisions. This hinders the exploitation of dependencies between extracted phrases and prevents the use of knowledge about the interrelationships between classifier predictions to improve performance. In this paper, we propose a new ASTE approach consisting of three transformer-inspired layers, which... | Iwo Naglik, Mateusz Lango |  |

This paper addresses this issue by proposing a post-hoc natural language explanation method that can be applied to any CNN-based classifier without altering its training process or affecting predictive performance. By analysing influential neurons and the corresponding activation maps, the method generates a faithful description of the classifier’s decision process in the form of a structured meaning representation, which is then converted into text by a language model. Through this pipeline approach, the generated explanations are grounded in the neural network architecture, providing accurate insight into the classification process while remaining accessible to non-experts. Experimental results show that the NLEs constructed by our method are significantly more plausible and faithful than baselines. In particular, user interventions in the neural network structure (masking... | Adam Wojciechowski, Mateusz Lango, Ondrej Dusek |  |

Despite success on multiple benchmarks, they have yet to be compared and their synergy remains unexplored. In this paper, we identify different strengths and weaknesses through evaluating state-of-the-art models on benchmark datasets: Text-to-SQL demonstrates superiority in handling questions involving arithmetic operations and long tables; E2E TQA excels in addressing ambiguous questions, non-standard table schema, and complex table contents. To combine both strengths, we propose a Synergistic Table-based Question Answering approach that integrate different models via answer selection, which is agnostic to any model types. Further experiments validate that ensembling models by either feature-based or LLM-based answer selector significantly improves the performance over individual models. | Siyue Zhang, Anh Tuan Luu, Chen Zhao |  |

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as promising techniques for encoding structural information and improving performance in tasks like link prediction and node classification. However, a key challenge remains: the difficulty of generalizing to unseen graph data with different properties. In this work, we propose a novel graph foundation model, called OpenGraph, to address this challenge. Our approach tackles several technical obstacles. Firstly, we enhance data augmentation using a large language model (LLM) to overcome data scarcity in real-world scenarios. Secondly, we introduce a unified graph tokenizer that enables the model to generalize effectively to diverse graph data, even when encountering unseen properties during training. Thirdly, our developed scalable graph transformer captures node-wise dependencies within the global topological context. Extensive... | Lianghao Xia, Ben Kao, Chao Huang |  |

However, existing studies on RAG seldom address the issue of predictive uncertainty, i.e., how likely it is that a RAG model’s prediction is incorrect, resulting in uncontrollable risks in real-world applications. In this work, we emphasize the importance of risk control, ensuring that RAG models proactively refuse to answer questions with low confidence. Our research identifies two critical latent factors affecting RAG’s confidence in its predictions: the quality of the retrieved results and the manner in which these results are utilized. To guide RAG models in assessing their own confidence based on these two latent factors, we develop a counterfactual prompting framework that induces the models to alter these factors and analyzes the effect on their answers. We also introduce a benchmarking procedure to collect answers with the option to abstain,... | Lu Chen, Ruqing Zhang, Jiafeng Guo, Yixing Fan, Xueqi Cheng |  |

This means that when a question is phrased in a slightly different but semantically similar way, LLM may output a wrong response despite being able to answer the original question correctly. Previous research has regarded this issue as a problem of the model’s robustness to question paraphrase and proposed a retraining method to address it. However, retraining faces challenges in meeting the computational costs and privacy security demands of LLMs. In this paper, we regard this issue as a problem of alignment with model preferences and propose PEARL (Preference-drivEn pAraphRase Learning). This is a black-box method that enhances model performance by paraphrasing questions in expressions preferred by the model. We validate PEARL across six datasets spanning three tasks: open-domain QA, commonsense reasoning, and math word problem.

However, it depends on the plurality voting rule, which focuses on the most frequent answer while overlooking all other minority responses. These inconsistent minority views often illuminate areas of uncertainty within the model’s generation process. To address this limitation, we present Mirror-Consistency, an enhancement of the standard Self-Consistency approach. Our method incorporates a ‘reflective mirror’ into the self-ensemble decoding process and enables LLMs to critically examine inconsistencies among multiple generations. Additionally, just as humans use the mirror to better understand themselves, we propose using Mirror-Consistency to enhance the sample-based confidence calibration methods, which helps to mitigate issues of overconfidence. Our experimental results demonstrate that Mirror-Consistency yields superior performance in both reasoning... | Siyuan Huang, Zhiyuan Ma, Jintao Du, Changhua Meng, Weiqiang Wang, Zhouhan Lin |  |

Our framework leverages the strengths of large-scale models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and text-guided diffusion models, to incorporate contextual cues from both textual and visual elements during translation. The few-shot learning capability of LLMs allows for the translation of fragmented texts by considering the overall context. Meanwhile, diffusion models’ advanced inpainting and editing abilities make it possible to fuse translated text seamlessly into the original image while preserving its style and realism. Our framework can be constructed entirely using open-source models and requires no training, making it highly accessible and easily expandable. To encourage advancement in the IIMT task, we have meticulously compiled a test dataset called MTIT6, which consists of multilingual... | Zhipeng Qian, Pei Zhang, Baosong Yang, Kai Fan, Yiwei Ma, Derek F.

One effective approach to mitigate these costs is compressing the long input contexts. Existing methods typically leverage the self-attention mechanism of the large model itself for context compression. While these methods have achieved notable results, the compression process still entails quadratic complexity. To mitigate this limitation, we propose the In-Context Former (IC-Former). This method does not rely on the target large model but instead utilizes cross-attention mechanisms to extract and condense information from the contextual embeddings. The computational overhead of our method grows linearly with the compression range. Experimental results indicate that our method requires only 1/32 of the floating-point operations of the baseline during compression and improves processing speed by 68 to 112 times while achieving 90%... | Xiangfeng Wang, Zaiyi Chen, Tong Xu, Zheyong Xie, Yongyi He, Enhong Chen |  |

Unfortunately, jailbreak can circumvent safety guardrails, resulting in LLMs generating harmful content and raising concerns about LLM safety. Due to language models with intensive parameters often regarded as black boxes, the mechanisms of alignment and jailbreak are challenging to elucidate. In this paper, we employ weak classifiers to explain LLM safety through the intermediate hidden states. We first confirm that LLMs learn ethical concepts during pre-training rather than alignment and can identify malicious and normal inputs in the early layers. Alignment actually associates the early concepts with emotion guesses in the middle layers and then refines them to the specific reject tokens for safe generations. Jailbreak disturbs the transformation of early unethical classification into negative emotions. We conduct experiments on models from 7B to 70B across various model families to... | Zhenhong Zhou, Haiyang Yu, Xinghua Zhang, Rongwu Xu, Fei Huang, Yongbin Li |  |

This paper presents a novel prototype learning approach that combines the label synset augmentation and the coarse-to-fine prototype distillation for multi-label few-shot intent detection. To tackle the data scarcity issue and the lack of information for unseen domains, we propose to enhance the representations of utterances with label synset augmentation and refine the prototypes by distilling the coarse domain knowledge from a universal teacher model. To solve the multilingual intent detection in real-world dialogue systems, we fine-tune a cross-lingual teacher model to make our method fast adapt to different languages and re-annotate two non-English task-oriented dialogue datasets CrossWOZ and JMultiWOZ in multi-label form. Experimental results on one English and two non-English datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in... | Xiaotong Zhang, Xinyi Li, Feng Zhang, Zhiyi Wei, Junfeng Liu, Han Liu |  |

Recently, LLMs’ capability to store, retrieve and infer with symbolic knowledge has drawn a great deal of attention, showing their potential to understand structured information. However, it is not yet known whether LLMs can understand Description Logic (DL) ontologies. In this work, we empirically analyze the LLMs’ capability of understanding DL-Lite ontologies covering 6 representative tasks from syntactic and semantic aspects. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate both the effectiveness and limitations of LLMs in understanding DL-Lite ontologies. We find that LLMs can understand formal syntax and model-theoretic semantics of concepts and roles. However, LLMs struggle with understanding TBox NI transitivity and handling ontologies with large ABoxes. We hope that our experiments and analyses provide more insights into LLMs and inspire to build more faithful knowledge engineering... | Keyu Wang, Guilin Qi, Jiaqi Li, Songlin Zhai |  |

However, these models often exhibit overconfidence, leading to potential risks and misjudgments. Existing techniques for eliciting and calibrating LLM confidence have primarily focused on general reasoning datasets, yielding only modest improvements. Accurate calibration is crucial for informed decision-making and preventing adverse outcomes but remains challenging due to the complexity and variability of tasks these models perform. In this work, we investigate the miscalibration behavior of black-box LLMs within the healthcare setting. We propose a novel method, Atypical Presentations Recalibration, which leverages atypical presentations to adjust the model’s confidence estimates. Our approach significantly improves calibration, reducing calibration errors by... | Jeremy Qin, Bang Liu, Quoc Dinh Nguyen |  |

However, existing pipelines for retrieval-augmented code generation (RACG) employ static knowledge bases with a single source, limiting the adaptation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to domains they have insufficient knowledge of. In this work, we develop a novel pipeline, EVOR, that employs the synchronous evolution of both queries and diverse knowledge bases. On two realistic settings where the external knowledge is required to solve code generation tasks, we compile four new datasets associated with frequently updated libraries and long-tail programming languages, named EVOR-BENCH. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EVOR achieves two to four times of execution accuracy compared to other methods such as Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2024), DocPrompting (Zhou et al., 2023), etc. We demonstrate that EVOR is flexible and can be easily combined with them to achieve further... | Hongjin Su, Shuyang Jiang, Yuhang Lai, Haoyuan Wu, Boao Shi, Che Liu, Qian Liu, Tao Yu |  |

Which Part Should You Distill Your LLM?](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.findings-emnlp.145) |  | 0 | Recent methods have demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) can solve reasoning tasks better when they are encouraged to solve subtasks of the main task first. In this paper we devise a similar strategy that breaks down reasoning tasks into a problem decomposition phase and a problem solving phase and show that the strategy is able to outperform a single stage solution. Further, we hypothesize that the decomposition should be easier to distill into a smaller model compared to the problem solving because the latter requires large amounts of domain knowledge while the former only requires learning general problem solving strategies. We propose methods to distill these two capabilities and evaluate their impact on reasoning outcomes and inference cost. We find that we can distill the problem decomposition phase and at the same time achieve good generalization across tasks, datasets, and models. However, it is harder to distill the problem solving capability without losing... | Zhuofeng Wu, Richard He Bai, Aonan Zhang, Jiatao Gu, V. G. Vinod Vydiswaran, Navdeep Jaitly, Yizhe Zhang |  |

This study addresses the overlooked impact of subtler, more complex shortcuts that compromise model reliability beyond oversimplified shortcuts. We introduce a comprehensive benchmark that categorizes shortcuts into occurrence, style, and concept, aiming to explore the nuanced ways in which these shortcuts influence the performance of LMs. Through extensive experiments across traditional LMs, large language models, and state-of-the-art robust models, our research systematically investigates models’ resilience and susceptibilities to sophisticated shortcuts.

It lacks a comprehensive understanding of the impact caused by the attacks. For example, we must consider which scenarios can apply to which attacks, what the common factors are that affect the performance of different attacks, the nature of the relationships between different attacks, and the influence of various datasets and models on the effectiveness of the attacks, etc. Therefore, we need a benchmark to holistically assess the privacy risks faced by NLP models. In this paper, we present a privacy attack and defense evaluation benchmark in the field of NLP, which includes the conventional/small models and large language models (LLMs). This benchmark supports a variety of models, datasets, and protocols, along with standardized... | Wei Huang, Yinggui Wang, Cen Chen |  |

To address these challenges, we propose MM-ChatAlign, a novel framework that utilizes the visual reasoning abilities of MLLMs for MMEA.The framework features an embedding-based candidate collection module that adapts to various knowledge representation strategies, effectively filtering out irrelevant reasoning candidates. Additionally, a reasoning and rethinking module, powered by MLLMs, enhances alignment by efficiently utilizing multimodal information.Extensive experiments on four MMEA datasets demonstrate MM-ChatAlign’s... | Xuhui Jiang, Yinghan Shen, Zhichao Shi, Chengjin Xu, Wei Li, Huang Zihe, Jian Guo, Yuanzhuo Wang |  |

Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) is designed to accurately measure a student’s ability using the least questions, providing an efficient and personalized testing method. However, existing methods mainly focus on minimizing the number of questions required to assess ability, often lacking clear and reliable explanations for the question selection process. Educators and students can hardly trust and accept CAT systems without an understanding of the rationale behind the question selection process. To address this issue, we introduce LLM-Agent-Based CAT (LACAT), a novel agent powered by large language models to enhance CAT with human-like interpretability and explanation capabilities.

They usually contain content structures such as sections, sub-sections, and paragraph demarcations. However, the indexing methods of long documents remain under-explored, while existing systems generally employ fixed-length chunking. As they do not consider content structures, the resultant chunks can exclude vital information or include irrelevant content. Motivated by this, we propose the \*\*M\*\*ulti-view \*\*C\*\*ontent-aware indexing (\*\*MC-indexing\*\*) for more effective long DocQA via (i) segment structured document into content chunks, and (ii) represent each content chunk in raw-text, keywords, and summary views.

However, current models face two major challenges in response generation latency: (1) generating a spoken response requires the prior generation of a written response, and (2) speech sequences are significantly longer than text sequences. This study addresses these issues by extending the input and output sequences of the language model to support the parallel generation of text and speech. Our experiments on spoken question answering tasks demonstrate that our approach improves latency while maintaining the quality of response content. Additionally, we show that latency can be further reduced by generating speech in multiple sequences.

Existing works suggest that LLMs are capable of generating human-like responses. Nevertheless, it is unclear how well LLMs work and where the plausible predictions derive from. This paper critically examines the performance of LLMs as social predictors, pointing out the source of correct predictions and limitations. Based on the notion of mutability that classifies social features, we design three realistic settings and a novel social prediction task, where the LLMs make predictions with input features of the same mutability and accessibility with the response feature. We find that the promising performance achieved by previous studies is because of input shortcut features to the response, which are hard to capture in reality; the performance degrades dramatically to... | Kaiqi Yang, Hang Li, Hongzhi Wen, TaiQuan Peng, Jiliang Tang, Hui Liu |  |

The dataset, spanning 55.00 hours and 52K audio recordings, integrates diverse textual sources, ensuring linguistic richness. A meticulous recording setup captures the nuances of Bahasa phonetics, employing professional equipment to ensure high-fidelity audio samples. Statistical analysis reveals the dataset’s scale and diversity, laying the foundation for model training and evaluation. The proposed EnGen-TTS model performs better than established baselines, achieving a Mean Opinion Score (MOS) of 4.45 ± 0.13. Additionally, our investigation on real-time factor and model size highlights EnGen-TTS as a compelling choice, with efficient performance.

To fill this gap, this paper introduces the MINERS, a benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of multilingual LMs in semantic retrieval tasks, including bitext mining and classification via retrieval-augmented contexts. We create a comprehensive framework to assess the robustness of LMs in retrieving samples across over 200 diverse languages, including extremely low-resource languages in challenging cross-lingual and code-switching settings.

These systems typically focus on optimizing the embedding space by attending to the relevance of text pairs, while overlooking the Boolean logic inherent in language, which may not be captured by current training objectives. In this work, we first investigate whether current retrieval systems can comprehend the Boolean logic implied in language. To answer this question, we formulate the task of Boolean Dense Retrieval and collect a benchmark dataset, BoolQuestions, which covers complex queries containing basic Boolean logic and corresponding annotated passages. Through extensive experimental results on the proposed task and benchmark dataset, we draw the conclusion that current dense retrieval... | Zongmeng Zhang, Jinhua Zhu, Wengang Zhou, Xiang Qi, Peng Zhang, Houqiang Li |  |

To address these challenges, we propose McCrolin, a Multi-consistency Cross-lingual training framework, leveraging multi-task learning to enhance cross-lingual consistency, ranking stability, and input-size robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that McCrolin achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard cross-lingual retrieval QA datasets. Furthermore, McCrolin outperforms competitors when dealing with various input sizes on downstream tasks. In terms of generalizability, results from further analysis show that our method is effective for various encoder architectures and sizes. | Peerat Limkonchotiwat, Wuttikorn Ponwitayarat, Lalita Lowphansirikul, Potsawee Manakul, Can Udomcharoenchaikit, Ekapol Chuangsuwanich, Sarana Nutanong |  |

Robustness here refers to the relative insensitivity of the model’s answers to meaning-preserving variants of their input. Benchmark datasets are constructed by introducing naturally-occurring, non-malicious perturbations, or by generating semantically equivalent paraphrases of input questions or statements.

Unlike common scenarios with sparse audio, music performances continuously involve dense audio signals throughout. While existing multimodal learning methods on the audio-video QA demonstrate impressive capabilities on general scenarios, they are incapable of dealing with fundamental problems within the music performances: they underexplore the interaction between the multimodal signals in performance, and fail to consider the distinctive characteristics of instruments and music. Therefore, existing methods tend to inaccurately answer questions regarding musical performances. To bridge the above research gaps, first, given the intricate multimodal interconnectivity inherent to music data, our primary backbone is designed to incorporate multimodal interactions within the context of music; second, to enable the model to learn music characteristics, we annotate and release rhythmic and music sources in the current... | Xingjian Diao, Chunhui Zhang, Tingxuan Wu, Ming Cheng, Zhongyu Ouyang, Weiyi Wu, Jiang Gui |  |

However, in the presence of distribution drift, a well trained DNN model may not perform well on a new dataset even though class labels are aligned between training and target datasets. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a novel approach based on model risk analysis to adapt a pre-trained DNN model towards a new dataset given only a small set of representative data. We first present a solution of model risk analysis for text classification, which can effectively quantify misprediction risk of a classifier on a dataset. Built upon the existing framework of LearnRisk, the proposed solution, denoted by LearnRisk-TC, first generates interpretable risk features, then constructs a risk model by aggregating these features, and finally trains the risk model on a small set of labeled data.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a promising solution for addressing the limitations of LLMs, yet existing studies on the robustness of RAG often overlook the interconnected relationships between RAG components or the potential threats prevalent in real-world databases, such as minor textual errors. In this work, we investigate two underexplored aspects when assessing the robustness of RAG: 1) vulnerability to noisy documents through low-level perturbations and 2) a holistic evaluation of RAG robustness. Furthermore, we introduce a novel attack method, the Genetic Attack on RAG (GARAG), which targets these aspects.

However, most existing Video LLMs neglect temporal information in video data, leading to struggles with temporal-aware video understanding. To address this gap, we propose a Time Gating Video LLM (TG-Vid) designed to enhance temporal modeling through a novel Time Gating module (TG). The TG module employs a time gating mechanism on its sub-modules, comprising gating spatial attention, gating temporal attention, and gating MLP. This architecture enables our model to achieve a robust understanding of temporal information within videos. Extensive evaluation of temporal-sensitive video benchmarks (i.e., MVBench, TempCompass, and NExT-QA) demonstrates that our TG-Vid model significantly outperforms the existing Video LLMs. Further, comprehensive ablation studies validate that the performance gains are attributed to the designs of our TG module.

However, current LLMs are delicate and elusive in prompt words and styles. And there is an unseen gap between LLM understanding and human-written prompts. This paper introduces AlignedCoT, an LLM-acquainted prompting technique that includes proficient “native-speaking” in in-context learning for the LLMs. Specifically, it achieves consistent and correct step-wise prompts in zero-shot scenarios by progressively probing, refining, and formatting the LLM chain of thoughts so that free from handcrafted few-shot demonstrations while maintaining the prompt quality.

This work seeks the underlying reasons by conducting experimental case studies and linking the performance benefits to well-established sample and computational complexity principles in machine learning. We experimented with six reasoning tasks, ranging from grade school math, air travel planning, ..., to Blocksworld. The results suggest that (i) both CoT and ToT benefit significantly from task decomposition, which breaks a complex reasoning task into a sequence of steps with low sample complexity and explicitly outlines the reasoning structure; (ii) for computationally hard reasoning tasks, the more sophisticated tree structure of ToT outperforms the linear structure of CoT; (iii) explicitly annotating important variables is important for good performance.

However, the model’s capability to follow natural language instructions (e.g., spatial relationships between objects, generating complex scenes) is still unsatisfactory. In this work, we propose Iterative Prompt Relabeling (IPR), a novel algorithm that aligns images to text through iterative image sampling and prompt relabeling with feedback. IPR first samples a batch of images conditioned on the text, then relabels the text prompts of unmatched text-image pairs with classifier feedback. We conduct thorough experiments on SDv2 and SDXL, testing their capability to follow instructions on spatial relations. With IPR, we improved up to 15.22% (absolute improvement) on the challenging spatial relation VISOR benchmark, demonstrating superior performance compared to previous RL methods.

Among the endangered languages spoken today, a significant number exhibit complex morphology. The models employed in contemporary language documentation pipelines that utilize ASR, however, are predominantly based on isolating or inflectional languages, often from the Indo-European family. This raises a critical concern: building models exclusively on such languages may introduce a bias, resulting in better performance with simpler morphological structures. In this paper, we investigate the performance of modern ASR architectures on morphologically complex languages. Results indicate that modern ASR architectures appear less robust in managing high OOV rates for morphologically complex languages in terms of word error rate, while character error rates are consistently higher for isolating languages. | Éric Le Ferrand, Zoey Liu, Antti Arppe, Emily Prud'hommeaux |  |

While the research community has proposed many ToM benchmarks, their hardness varies greatly, and their complexity is not well defined. This work proposes a framework inspired by cognitive load theory to measure the complexity of ToM tasks. We quantify a problem’s complexity as the number of states necessary to solve it correctly. Our complexity measure also accounts for spurious states of a ToM problem designed to make it apparently harder. We use our method to assess the complexity of five widely adopted ToM benchmarks. On top of this framework, we design a prompting technique that augments the information available to a model with a description of how the environment changes with the agents’ interactions. We name this technique Discrete World Models (DWM) and show how it elicits superior performance on ToM tasks. | X. Angelo Huang, Emanuele La Malfa, Samuele Marro, Andrea Asperti, Anthony G.

Previous studies have extensively explored excavating valuable features to build accurate interest profiles. However, they overlook that the user’s attention varies on product attributes(e.g., brand, category). Users may especially prefer specific attributes or switch their preferences between attributes dynamically. Instead, existing approaches mix up all attribute features and let the model automatically extract useful ones from rather complex scenarios. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a dynamic multi-attribute interest learning model to tackle the influences from attributes to user interests. Specifically, we design two interest profiling modules: attribute-centered and attribute-aware profiling. The former focuses on capturing the user’s preferences on a single attribute, while the latter focuses on addressing the interests... | Yutong Bai, Zhicheng Dou, JiRong Wen |  |

Since human A/B testing is commonly used, we assume commercial systems improve over time, which enables us to evaluate machine translation (MT) metrics based on their preference for more recent translations. Our study not only confirms several prior findings, such as the advantage of neural metrics over non-neural ones, but also explores the debated issue of how MT quality affects metric reliability—an investigation that smaller datasets in previous research could not sufficiently explore. Overall, our research demonstrates the dataset’s value as a testbed for metric evaluation. We release our code. | Guojun Wu, Shay B. Cohen, Rico Sennrich |  |

In this work, rather than using LLMs directly as agents, we explore their use as tools for embodied agent learning. Specifically, to train separate agents via offline reinforcement learning (RL), an LLM is used to provide dense reward feedback on individual actions in training datasets. In doing so, we present a consistency-guided reward ensemble framework (CoREN), designed for tackling difficulties in grounding LLM-generated estimates to the target environment domain. The framework employs an adaptive ensemble of spatio-temporally consistent rewards to derive domain-grounded rewards in the training datasets, thus enabling effective offline learning of embodied agents in different environment domains. Experiments with the VirtualHome benchmark demonstrate that CoREN significantly outperforms other offline RL agents, and it also achieves comparable... | Yujeong Lee, Sangwoo Shin, WeiJin Park, Honguk Woo |  |

However, aligning LLMs with complex human preferences remains a significant challenge due to the potential misinterpretation of user prompts. Current methods for aligning LLM behaviors fall into two categories: output optimization (such as RLHF, RLAIF, and DPO) and input optimization (like OPRO and BPO). While both approaches aim to guide LLMs towards generating responses that align with desired objectives, the labor-intensive and intentions-inconsistent data annotation, as well as the strict and tedious training supervision, make them struggle to yield optimal results across all models.

However, when required to generate responses of a specific length, large language models often struggle to meet users’ needs due to their inherent difficulty in accurately perceiving numerical constraints. To explore the ability of large language models to control the length of generated responses, we propose the Target Length Generation Task (TLG) and design two metrics, Precise Match (PM) and Flexible Match (FM) to evaluate the model’s performance in adhering to specified response lengths. Furthermore, we introduce a novel, model-agnostic approach called Ruler, which employs Meta Length Tokens (MLTs) to enhance the instruction-following ability of large language models under length-constrained instructions. Specifically, Ruler equips LLMs with the ability to generate responses of a specified length based on length constraints within the instructions. Moreover, Ruler... | Jiaming Li, Lei Zhang, Yunshui Li, Ziqiang Liu, Yuelin Bai, Run Luo, Longze Chen, Min Yang |  |

GEST contains samples for 16 gender stereotypes about men and women (e.g., Women are beautiful, Men are leaders) that are compatible with the English language and 9 Slavic languages. The definition of said stereotypes was informed by gender experts. We used GEST to evaluate English and Slavic masked LMs, English generative LMs, and machine translation systems. We discovered significant and consistent amounts of gender-stereotypical reasoning in almost all the evaluated models and languages. Our experiments confirm the previously postulated hypothesis that the larger the model, the more stereotypical it usually is. | Matús Pikuliak, Stefan Oresko, Andrea Hrckova, Marián Simko |  |

A well-established area of research in Natural Language Processing, drawing from well-understood concepts in linguistic and computational linguistic research, the field has recently seen a lot of interest as a result of the surge of text, video, and audio available on the web, which in turn require ways of summarising and categorizing the mole of content for which linear text segmentation is a fundamental step. In this survey, we provide an extensive overview of current advances in linear text segmentation, describing the state of the art in terms of resources and approaches for the task. Finally, we highlight the limitations of available resources and of the task itself, while indicating ways forward based on the most recent literature and under-explored research directions. | Iacopo Ghinassi, Lin Wang, Chris Newell, Matthew Purver |  |

Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for Visual Document Understanding are equipped with text recognition ability but lack general structure understanding abilities for text-rich document images. In this work, we emphasize the importance of structure information in Visual Document Understanding and propose Unified Structure Learning to boost the performance of MLLMs. Based on publicly available text-rich images, we build a comprehensive training set DocStruct4M to support structure-aware parsing tasks and multi-grained text localization tasks across 5 domains: document, webpage, table, chart, and natural image. To better encode structure information, we design a simple and effective vision-to-text module H-Reducer, which can not only maintain the layout information but also reduce the length of visual features by merging horizontal adjacent patches... | Anwen Hu, Haiyang Xu, Jiabo Ye, Ming Yan, Liang Zhang, Bo Zhang, Ji Zhang, Qin Jin, Fei Huang, Jingren Zhou |  |

The “localize-then-answer” strategy, while enhancing accuracy and interpretability, faces challenges due to the lack of temporal localization labels in VideoQA datasets. Existing methods often train the models’ localization capabilities indirectly using QA labels, leading to inaccurate localization. Moreover, our experiments show that despite high accuracy, current models depend too heavily on language shortcuts or spurious correlations with irrelevant visual context. To address these issues, we propose a Question-Guided and Answer-Calibrated TRansformer (QGAC-TR), which guides and calibrates localization using question and option texts without localization labels. Furthermore, we design two self-supervised learning tasks to further enhance the model’s refined localization capabilities. Extensive experiments on three public datasets focused on temporal and causal reasoning show that our... | Yuanxing Xu, Yuting Wei, Shuai Zhong, Xinming Chen, Jinsheng Qi, Bin Wu |  |

Specifically, we improve LoRA approaches to alleviate the performance loss from the constrained adapter by introducing a non-linear transformation (call it LoRAN). For a better adaptation, we also design a new non-linear function to appropriately fit the accumulated weight updates. We test our method in multiple advanced large language models. Experimental results show that our LoRAN significantly outperforms a strong baseline on SAMSum and 20 Newsgroups tasks. Moreover, when a lower rank is applied, our approach even yields a 1.95-point improvement in the classification task. | Yinqiao Li, Linqi Song, Hanxu Hou |  |

However, previous work challenges their out-of-context reasoning ability, i.e., the ability to infer information from their training data, instead of from the context or prompt. This paper focuses on a significant aspect of out-of-context reasoning: Out-of-Context Knowledge Reasoning (OCKR), which is to combine multiple knowledge to infer new knowledge. We designed a synthetic dataset with seven representative OCKR tasks to systematically assess the OCKR capabilities of LLMs. Using this dataset, we evaluated several LLMs and discovered that their proficiency in this aspect is limited, regardless of whether the knowledge is trained in a separate or adjacent training settings. Moreover, training the model to reason with reasoning examples does not result in significant improvement, while training the model to perform explicit knowledge retrieval helps for retrieving... | Peng Hu, Changjiang Gao, Ruiqi Gao, Jiajun Chen, Shujian Huang |  |

Existing frameworks adapt from an initial pretrained model to each downstream task directly, but ignore the sequential nature of the downstream tasks and their feedback effect on the pretrained model. In this work, we propose a new framework, called BiKT, to enable bidirectional knowledge transfer between pretrained models and downstream tasks in rounds. We model each downstream task in the current round as a target task for adaptation and treat all the tasks in the previous rounds as source tasks for feedback. We design a feedback algorithm by multi-task learning over the labeled data of the source tasks, where task-specific prompts are plugged into the backbone network for decoupling task-exclusive knowledge from task-shared knowledge. We further utilize the good initiation of the new backbone network updated in the feedback phase and the trained prompts of the source tasks for adaptation.... | Hang Zeng, Chaoyue Niu, Fan Wu, Shaojie Tang, Leihao Pei, Chengfei Lv, Guihai Chen |  |

Decomposition-based methods have demonstrated remarkable performance on this task, which initially train a type-independent span detector and subsequently classify the detected spans based on their types. However, this framework has an evident drawback as a domain-agnostic detector cannot ensure the identification of only those entity spans that are specific to the target domain. To address this issue, we propose Double-Checker, which leverages collaboration between Large Language Models (LLMs) and small models. Specifically, we employ LLMs to verify candidate spans predicted by the small model and eliminate any spans that fall outside the scope of the target domain. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method, consistently yielding improvements over two baseline approaches. Our code is available at... | Wei Chen, Lili Zhao, Zhi Zheng, Tong Xu, Yang Wang, Enhong Chen |  |

However, their application to sentence embeddings is still under active research. In this work, we introduce PromptEOL, a simple and efficient method designed to enhance LLM performance on sentence embeddings with a one-word limitation. We further integrate PromptEOL with in-context learning and alignment to leverage LLMs in two settings: without fine-tuning and with fine-tuning. Our extensive experiments show that PromptEOL enables LLMs to generate superior sentence embeddings without fine-tuning, outperforming contrastive learning methods. Additionally, with fine-tuning, a 2.7B parameter model using PromptEOL surpasses the performance of a 4.8B parameter model from previous methods. We also analyze how scaling model parameters, from 125 million to 66 billion, impacts sentence embedding performance. | Ting Jiang, Shaohan Huang, Zhongzhi Luan, Deqing Wang, Fuzhen Zhuang |  |

However, they are significantly different. In ICL, a set of demonstrations is provided at the inference time, but the LLM’s parameters are not updated. In IT, a set of demonstrations is used to adjust the parameters of the LLM during training, but no demonstrations are provided at the inference time. Although a growing body of literature has explored ICL and IT, studies on these topics have largely been conducted in isolation, leading to a disconnect between these two paradigms. In this work, we explore the relationship between ICL and IT by examining how the hidden states of LLMs change in these two paradigms. Through carefully designed experiments conducted with LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-2-Chat (7B and 13B), we find that ICL and IT converge in LLM hidden states despite their apparent differences in implementation. Specifically, ICL changes an... | Hanyu Duan, Yixuan Tang, Yi Yang, Ahmed Abbasi, Kar Yan Tam |  |

It has been well explored through a two-step paradigm: initially identifying potential visual entities using object detection methods and then aligning the extracted textual entities with their corresponding visual entities. However, when it comes to fine-grained MNERG, the long-tailed distribution of textual entity categories and the performance of object detectors limit the effectiveness of traditional methods. Specifically, more detailed classification leads to many low-frequency categories, and existing object detection methods often fail to pinpoint subtle regions within images. To address these challenges, we propose the Granular Entity Mapper (GEM) framework. Firstly, we design a multi-granularity entity recognition module, followed by a reranking module based on the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to incorporate hierarchical information of... | Ziqi Wang, Chen Zhu, Zhi Zheng, Xinhang Li, Tong Xu, Yongyi He, Qi Liu, Ying Yu, Enhong Chen |  |

This paper presents a novel framework for benchmarking hierarchical gender hiring bias in Large Language Models (LLMs) for resume scoring, revealing significant issues of reverse gender hiring bias and overdebiasing. Our contributions are fourfold: Firstly, we introduce a new construct grounded in labour economics, legal principles, and critiques of current bias benchmarks: hiring bias can be categorized into two types: Level bias (difference in the average outcomes between demographic counterfactual groups) and Spread bias (difference in the variance of outcomes between demographic counterfactual groups); Level bias can be further subdivided into statistical bias (i.e. changing with non-demographic content) and taste-based bias (i.e. consistent regardless of non-demographic content). Secondly, the framework includes rigorous statistical and computational hiring... | Ze Wang, Zekun Wu, Xin Guan, Michael Thaler, Adriano S.

Traditional solutions that rely on penalizing text redundancy or token reoccurrence have shown limited efficacy, particularly for lengthy article and e-commerce descriptions with inherent redundancy, even with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper investigates the underlying causes of textual repetition through the lens of information entropy, attributing the phenomenon to the elevated uncertainty within the input text. To address this, a novel algorithm named Contrastive Token Learning with Similarity Decay (CTSD) is introduced, which modulates the suppression of tokens dynamically, informed by varying attention weights and inter-token distances. Furthermore, an e-commerce dataset comprised of title texts of online real items is compiled and released susceptible to hallucination translations to... | Huangyu Dai, Ben Chen, Kaidi Chen, Ying Han, Zihan Liang, Wen Jiang |  |

However, smaller language models remain valuable due to their lower operational costs. Despite their advantages, smaller models frequently underperform compared to their larger counterparts, even when provided with equivalent data and computational resources. Specifically, their performance tends to degrade in the late pretraining phase. This is anecdotally attributed to their reduced representational capacity. Yet, the exact causes of this performance degradation remain unclear. We use the Pythia model suite to analyse the training dynamics that underlie this phenomenon. Across different model sizes, we investigate the convergence of the Attention and MLP activations to their final state and examine how the effective rank of their parameters influences this process. We find that nearly all layers in larger models stabilise early in training - within the first 20% - whereas layers... | Richard Diehl Martinez, Pietro Lesci, Paula Buttery |  |

Red teaming aims to find prompts that could elicit harmful responses from LLMs, and is essential to discover and mitigate safety risks before real-world deployment. However, manual red teaming is both time-consuming and expensive, rendering it unscalable. In this paper, we propose RTPE, a scalable evolution framework to evolve red teaming prompts across both breadth and depth dimensions, facilitating the automatic generation of numerous high-quality and diverse red teaming prompts. Specifically, in-breadth evolving employs a novel enhanced in-context learning method to create a multitude of quality prompts, whereas in-depth evolving applies customized transformation operations to enhance both content and form of prompts, thereby increasing diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RTPE surpasses... | Rui Li, Peiyi Wang, Jingyuan Ma, Di Zhang, Lei Sha, Zhifang Sui |  |

This paper introduces FININ (Financial Interconnected News Influence Network), a novel market prediction model that captures not only the links between news and prices but also the interactions among news items themselves. FININ effectively integrates multi-modal information from both market data and news articles. We conduct extensive experiments on two datasets, encompassing the S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100 indices over a 15-year period and over 2.7 million news articles. The results demonstrate FININ’s effectiveness, outperforming advanced market prediction models with an improvement of 0.429 and 0.341 in the daily Sharpe ratio for the two markets respectively. Moreover, our results reveal insights into the financial news, including the delayed market pricing of news, the long memory effect of news, and the limitations of... | Mengyu Wang, Shay B.

Knowledge distillation (KD) is a promising solution, enabling the transfer of capabilities from larger teacher LLMs to more compact student models. Particularly, sequence-level KD, which distills rationale-based reasoning processes instead of merely final outcomes, shows great potential in enhancing students’ reasoning capabilities. However, current methods struggle with sequence-level KD under long-tailed data distributions, adversely affecting generalization on sparsely represented domains. We introduce the Multi-Stage Balanced Distillation (BalDistill) framework, which iteratively balances training data within a fixed computational budget. By dynamically selecting representative head domain examples and synthesizing tail domain examples, BalDistill achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse long-tailed datasets,... | Yuhang Zhou, Jing Zhu, Paiheng Xu, Xiaoyu Liu, Xiyao Wang, Danai Koutra, Wei Ai, Furong Huang |  |

To facilitate chart-based reasoning using natural language, various downstream tasks have been introduced recently such as chart question answering, chart summarization, and fact-checking with charts. These tasks pose a unique challenge, demanding both vision-language reasoning and a nuanced understanding of chart data tables, visual encodings, and natural language instructions. Despite the recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs) across diverse NLP tasks, their abilities and limitations in the realm of data visualization remain under-explored, possibly due to their lack of multi-modal capabilities. To bridge the gap, this paper presents one of the first comprehensive evaluations of the recently developed large vision language models (LVLMs) for chart understanding and reasoning tasks.

Many LLMs, however, often struggle with the distinct complexities of materials science tasks, such as computational challenges, and rely heavily on outdated implicit knowledge, leading to inaccuracies and hallucinations. To address these challenges, we introduce HoneyComb, the first LLM-based agent system specifically designed for materials science. HoneyComb leverages a reliable, high-quality materials science knowledge base (MatSciKB) and a sophisticated tool hub (ToolHub) tailored specifically for materials science to enhance its reasoning and computational capabilities. MatSciKB is a curated, structured knowledge collection based on reliable literature, while ToolHub employs an Inductive Tool Construction method to generate, decompose, and refine API tools for materials science. Additionally, HoneyComb leverages a retriever module that adaptively selects... | Huan Zhang, Yu Song, Ziyu Hou, Santiago Miret, Bang Liu |  |

However, such analyses prove challenging due to the semantic shift phenomenon, where word meanings evolve over time. This paper proposes an unsupervised dynamic word embedding method to capture longitudinal semantic shifts in social media data without predefined anchor words. The method leverages word co-occurrence statistics and dynamic updating to adapt embeddings over time, addressing the challenges of data sparseness, imbalanced distributions, and synergistic semantic effects. Evaluated on a large COVID-19 Twitter dataset, the method reveals semantic evolution patterns of vaccine- and symptom-related entities across different pandemic stages, and their potential correlations with real-world statistics.

This necessitates a nuanced understanding of diverse legal concepts, such as Recidivism, Confess, and Robbery, which often coexist within cases, complicating holistic analysis. However, existing methods mainly rely on the generation capability of language models, without paying enough attention to the important legal concepts.To enhance the precision and depth of such explanations, we introduce Legal Concept-guided Criminal Court Views Generation (LeGen), a three-stage approach designed for iterative reasoning tailored to individual legal constructs.Specifically, in the first stage, we design a decomposer to divide the court views into focused sub-views, each anchored around a distinct legal concept. Next, a concept reasoning module generates targeted rationales by intertwining the deconstructed facts with their corresponding legal frameworks, ensuring contextually relevant... | Qi Xu, Xiao Wei, Hang Yu, Qian Liu, Hao Fei |  |

However, creating such datasets is difficult and most works rely on manual curation or proprietary language models. Automatic data curation is difficult as it is still not clear how we can define diversity for instruction tuning, how diversity and quality depend on one other, and how we can optimize dataset quality and diversity. To resolve these issue, we propose a new algorithm, Quality-Diversity Instruction Tuning (QDIT). QDIT provides a simple method to simultaneously control dataset diversity and quality, allowing us to conduct an in-depth study on the effect of diversity and quality on instruction tuning performance. From this study we draw two key insights (1) there is a natural tradeoff between data diversity and quality and (2) increasing data diversity significantly improves the worst case instruction following... | Alexander Bukharin, Shiyang Li, Zhengyang Wang, Jingfeng Yang, Bing Yin, Xian Li, Chao Zhang, Tuo Zhao, Haoming Jiang |  |

However, for low-resource languages, these models still struggle to produce natural and intelligible speech. Grapheme-to-Phoneme conversion (G2P) addresses this challenge by enhancing the input sequence with phonetic information. Despite these advancements, existing G2P systems face limitations when dealing with Persian texts due to the complexity of Persian transcription. In this study, we focus on enriching resources for the Persian language. To achieve this, we introduce two novel G2P training datasets: one manually labeled and the other machine-generated. These datasets comprise over five million sentences alongside their corresponding phoneme sequences. Additionally, we propose two evaluation datasets tailored for Persian sub-tasks, including Kasre-Ezafe detection, homograph disambiguation, and handling out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words.

In this work, we study the ability of LLMs to abstain from answering context-dependent science questions when provided insufficient or incorrect context. We probe model sensitivity in several settings: removing gold context, replacing gold context with irrelevant context, and providing additional context beyond what is given. In experiments on four QA datasets with six LLMs, we show that performance varies greatly across models, across the type of context provided, and also by question type; in particular, many LLMs seem unable to abstain from answering boolean questions using standard QA prompts. Our analysis also highlights the unexpected impact of abstention performance on QA task accuracy. Counter-intuitively, in some settings, replacing gold context with irrelevant context or adding irrelevant context to gold context can improve abstention performance in a... | Bingbing Wen, Bill Howe, Lucy Lu Wang |  |

In contrast, multiple-choice question (MCQ) benchmarks for commonsense reasoning require a hard selection of a single correct answer, which, in principle, should represent the most plausible answer choice. On 250 MCQ items sampled from two commonsense reasoning benchmarks, we collect 5,000 independent plausibility judgments on answer choices. We find that for over 20% of the sampled MCQS, the answer choice rated most plausible does not match the benchmark gold answers; upon manual inspection, we confirm that this subset exhibits higher rates of problems like ambiguity or semantic mismatch between question and answer choices. Experiments with LLMs reveal low accuracyand high variation in performance on the subset, suggesting our plausibility criterion may be helpful in identifying more reliable benchmark items for commonsense evaluation. | Shramay Palta, Nishant Balepur, Peter Rankel, Sarah Wiegreffe, Marine Carpuat, Rachel Rudinger |  |

In realistic scenarios, the annotation budget often becomes the main determinant of the number of perspectives (i.e., annotators) included in the data and subsequent modeling. We introduce a novel framework for annotation collection and modeling in subjective tasks that aims to minimize the annotation budget while maximizing the predictive performance for each annotator. Our framework has a two-stage design: first, we rely on a small set of annotators to build a multitask model, and second, we augment the model for a new perspective by strategically annotating a few samples per annotator. To test our framework at scale, we introduce and release a unique dataset, Moral Foundations Subjective Corpus, of 2000 Reddit posts annotated by 24 annotators for moral sentiment.

Student passion and perseverance, or grit, has been associated with language learning success. Recent work establishes that as students perceive their English teachers to be more supportive, their grit improves. Hypothesizing that the same pattern applies to English-teaching chatbots, we create EDEN, a robust open-domain chatbot for spoken conversation practice that provides empathetic feedback. To construct EDEN, we first train a specialized spoken utterance grammar correction model and a high-quality social chit-chat conversation model. We then conduct a preliminary user study with a variety of strategies for empathetic feedback. Our experiment suggests that using adaptive empathetic feedback leads to higher \*perceived affective support\*. Furthermore, elements of perceived affective support positively correlate with student grit. | Siyan Li, Teresa Shao, Zhou Yu, Julia Hirschberg |  |

Their importance has driven a recent influx of works passing time series into language models, leading to non-trivial forecasting on some datasets. But it remains unknown whether non-trivial forecasting implies that language models can reason about time series. To address this gap, we generate a first-of-its-kind evaluation framework for time series reasoning, including formal tasks and a corresponding dataset of multi-scale time series paired with text captions across ten domains. Using these data, we probe whether language models achieve three forms of reasoning: (1) Etiological Reasoning—given an input time series, can the language model identify the scenario that most likely created it? (2) Question Answering—can a language model answer factual questions about time series? (3) Context-Aided Forecasting–does highly relevant textual context improve a language model’s time series forecasts? We find... | Mike A.

This success is largely due to the comprehensive and in-depth domain knowledge within their training datasets. However, the extent of this knowledge can vary across different domains, and existing methods often assume that LLMs have a complete understanding of their environment, overlooking potential gaps in their grasp of actual world dynamics. To address this gap, we introduce Discover, Verify, and Evolve (DiVE), a framework that discovers world dynamics from a small number of demonstrations, verifies the correctness of these dynamics, and evolves new, advanced dynamics tailored to the current situation. Through extensive evaluations, we analyze the impact of each component on performance and compare the automatically generated dynamics from with human-annotated world dynamics. Our results... | Zhiyuan Sun, Haochen Shi, MarcAlexandre Côté, Glen Berseth, Xingdi Yuan, Bang Liu |  |

However, their performance in tasks involving tabular data, especially those requiring symbolic reasoning, faces challenges due to the structural variance and inconsistency in table cell values often found in web tables. In this paper, we introduce NormTab, a novel framework aimed at enhancing the symbolic reasoning performance of LLMs by normalizing web tables. We study table normalization as a stand-alone, one-time preprocessing step using LLMs to support symbolic reasoning on tabular data. Our experimental evaluation, conducted on challenging web table datasets such as WikiTableQuestion and TabFact, demonstrates that leveraging NormTab significantly improves symbolic reasoning performance, showcasing the importance and effectiveness of web table normalization for enhancing LLM-based symbolic reasoning tasks. | Md Mahadi Hasan Nahid, Davood Rafiei |  |

Existing techniques usually identify hallucinations post-generation that cannot prevent their occurrence and suffer from inconsistent performance due to the influence of the instruction format and model style. In this paper, we introduce a novel pre-detection self-evaluation technique, referred to as SELF-FAMILIARITY, which focuses on evaluating the model’s familiarity with the concepts present in the input instruction and withholding the generation of response in case of unfamiliar concepts under the zero-resource setting, where external ground-truth or background information is not available. We also propose a new dataset Concept-7 focusing on the hallucinations caused by limited inner knowledge. We validate SELF-FAMILIARITY across four different large language models,... | Junyu Luo, Cao Xiao, Fenglong Ma |  |

Previous work has found that datasets with paired inputs are prone to correlations between a specific part of the input (e.g., the hypothesis in NLI) and the label; consequently, models trained only on those outperform chance. Are these correlations picked up by models trained on the full input data? To address this question, we propose a new evaluation method, Counterfactual Attentiveness Test (CAT). CAT uses counterfactuals by replacing part of the input with its counterpart from a different example (subject to some restrictions), expecting an attentive model to change its prediction. Using CAT, we systematically investigate established supervised and in-context learning models on ten datasets spanning four tasks: natural language inference, reading comprehension, paraphrase detection, and visual & language reasoning. CAT reveals that reliance on such... | Yanai Elazar, Bhargavi Paranjape, Hao Peng, Sarah Wiegreffe, Khyathi Raghavi Chandu, Vivek Srikumar, Sameer Singh, Noah A. Smith |  |

Traditional ICL approaches construct prompts using examples that contain questions similar to the input question. However, CoT prompting, which includes crucial intermediate reasoning steps (rationales) within its examples, necessitates selecting examples based on these rationales rather than the questions themselves. Existing methods require human experts or pre-trained LLMs to describe the skill, a high-level abstraction of rationales, to guide the selection. These methods, however, are often costly and difficult to scale. Instead, this paper introduces a new approach named Latent Reasoning Skills (LaRS) that employs unsupervised learning to create a latent space representation of rationales, with a latent variable called a reasoning skill. Concurrently, LaRS learns a reasoning policy to determine the required reasoning... | Zifan Xu, Haozhu Wang, Dmitriy Bespalov, Xian Wu, Peter Stone, Yanjun Qi |  |

Although there has been considerable exploration into enhancing zero-shot abilities in image captioning (IC) for popular datasets such as MSCOCO and Flickr8k, these approaches fall short with fine-grained datasets like CUB, FLO, UCM-Captions, and Sydney-Captions. These datasets require captions to discern between visually and semantically similar classes, focusing on detailed object parts and their attributes. To overcome this challenge, we introduce TRaining-Free Object-Part Enhancement (TROPE). TROPE enriches a base caption with additional object-part details using object detector proposals and natural language processing techniques. It complements rather than alters the base caption, allowing seamless integration with other captioning methods and offering users enhanced flexibility. Our evaluations show that TROPE consistently boosts... | Joshua Feinglass, Yezhou Yang |  |

Confidence estimation enables humans to make more informed decisions, particularly when the model’s certainty is low, or where the consequences of a mistake are significant. However, most existing COC works prioritize high task performance over model reliability. This paper conducts an empirical investigation into how various design choices—including pre-training corpus, confidence estimator and fine-tuning loss—affect the reliability of COC models within the framework of selective prediction. Our experiments on the multi-label COC task, focusing on European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) cases, highlight the importance of a diverse yet domain-specific pre-training corpus for better calibration. Additionally, we demonstrate that larger models tend to exhibit overconfidence, Monte Carlo dropout methods produce reliable confidence... | T. Y. S. S.

To address these challenges, methods for integrating knowledge have been developed, which augment LLMs with domain-specific knowledge graphs through external modules. These approaches, however, face data inefficiency issues as they necessitate the processing of both known and unknown knowledge for fine-tuning. Thus, our research focuses on a novel problem: efficiently integrating unknown knowledge into LLMs without unnecessary overlap of known knowledge. A risk of introducing new knowledge is the potential forgetting of existing knowledge. To mitigate this risk, we propose the innovative InfuserKI framework. This framework employs transformer internal states to determine when to enrich LLM outputs with additional information, effectively preventing knowledge forgetting.

When judging the quality of a summary, factual consistency holds a significant weight. Despite numerous efforts dedicated to building factual inconsistency detectors, the exploration of explanability remains limited among existing effort. In this study, we incorporate both human-annotated and model-generated natural language explanations elucidating how a summary deviates and thus becomes inconsistent with its source article. We build our explanation-augmented dataset on top of the widely used SummaC summarization consistency benchmark. Additionally, we develop an inconsistency detector that is jointly trained with the collected explanations. Our findings demonstrate that integrating explanations during training not only enables the model to provide rationales for its judgments but also enhances its accuracy significantly. | Ge Luo, Weisi Fan, Miaoran Li, Guoruizhe Sun, Runlong Zhang, Chenyu Xu, Forrest Sheng Bao |  |

An Analysis of Image Captions for Training Text-to-Image Generation Model](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.findings-emnlp.211) |  | 0 | Despite advancements in text-to-image models, generating images that precisely align with textual descriptions remains challenging due to misalignment in training data. In this paper, we analyze the critical role of caption precision and recall in text-to-image model training. Our analysis of human-annotated captions shows that both precision and recall are important for text-image alignment, but precision has a more significant impact. Leveraging these insights, we utilize Large Vision Language Models to generate synthetic captions for training. Models trained with these synthetic captions show similar behavior to those trained on human-annotated captions, underscores the potential for synthetic data in text-to-image training. | Sheng Cheng, Maitreya Patel, Yezhou Yang |  |

However, debates persist about whether LLMs exhibit \*abstract generalization\* or rely on \*shallow heuristics\* when given CoT prompts. To understand the factors influencing CoT reasoning we provide a detailed case study of the symbolic reasoning task of decoding shift ciphers, where letters are shifted forward some number of steps in the alphabet. We analyze the pattern of results produced by three LLMs—GPT-4, Claude 3, and Llama 3.1—performing this task using CoT prompting. By focusing on a single relatively simple task, we are able to identify three factors that systematically affect CoT performance: the probability of the task’s expected output (probability), what the model has implicitly learned during pre-training (memorization), and the number of intermediate operations involved in reasoning (noisy reasoning). We show that these factors can... | Akshara Prabhakar, Thomas L. Griffiths, R. Thomas McCoy |  |

Two fundamental questions persist: 1) how consistent is the reasoning, and 2) can models detect unreliable reasoning? In this paper, we investigate self-contradictory (Self-Contra) reasoning, where the model reasoning does not support answers. To answer 1), we define and assess the Self-Contra rate across three datasets and delve into finer-grained categories of Self-Contra reasoning. We find that LLMs often contradict themselves in reasoning tasks involving contextual information understanding or commonsense. The model may generate correct answers by taking shortcuts in reasoning or overlooking contextual evidence, leading to compromised reasoning. For 2), we task the state-of-the-art model GPT-4 with identifying Self-Contra reasoning and finer-grained fallacies. We find that finer-grained aided... | Ziyi Liu, Soumya Sanyal, Isabelle Lee, Yongkang Du, Rahul Gupta, Yang Liu, Jieyu Zhao |  |

To facilitate precedent retrieval, we train a retriever with a fine-grained relevance signal based on the overlap ratio of alleged articles between cases. We investigate two strategies to integrate precedents: direct incorporation at inference via label interpolation based on case proximity and during training via a precedent fusion module using a stacked-cross attention model. We employ joint training of the retriever and LJP models to address latent space divergence between them. Our experiments on LJP tasks from the ECHR jurisdiction reveal that integrating precedents during training coupled with joint training of the retriever and LJP model, outperforms models without precedents or with precedents incorporated only at inference, particularly benefiting sparser articles. | T.

A major point of tension in the literature is the granularity of this fact-checking: larger chunks of text are hard to fact-check, but more atomic facts like propositions may lack context to interpret correctly. In this work, we assess the role of context in these atomic facts. We argue that fully atomic facts are not the right representation, and define two criteria for molecular facts: decontextuality, or how well they can stand alone, and minimality, or how little extra information is added to achieve decontexuality. We quantify the impact of decontextualization on minimality, then present a baseline methodology for generating molecular facts automatically, aiming to add the right amount of information. We compare against various methods of decontextualization and find that molecular facts balance minimality with fact verification accuracy in... | Anisha Gunjal, Greg Durrett |  |

Traditional evaluations fail to assess a model’s factual correctness. To rectify this absence, we present MoleculeQA, a novel question answering (QA) dataset which possesses 62K QA pairs over 23K molecules. Each QA pair, composed of a manual question, a positive option and three negative options, has consistent semantics with a molecular description from authoritative corpus. MoleculeQA is not only the first benchmark to evaluate molecular factual correctness but also the largest molecular QA dataset. A comprehensive evaluation on MoleculeQA for existing molecular LLMs exposes their deficiencies in specific aspects and pinpoints crucial factors for molecular modeling. Furthermore, we employ MoleculeQA in reinforcement learning to mitigate model hallucinations, thereby enhancing the factual correctness of generated information. | Xingyu Lu, He Cao, Zijing Liu, Shengyuan Bai, Leqing Chen, Yuan Yao, HaiTao Zheng, Yu Li |  |

However, the hallucination effect can significantly compromise the reliability of bug reports. This work formulates a new schema of bug detection and presents a novel sanitization technique that detects false positives for hallucination mitigation. Our key idea is to enforce LLMs to emit data-flow paths in few-shot chain-of-thought prompting and validate them via the program-property decomposition. Specifically, we dissect data-flow paths into basic properties upon concise code snippets and leverage parsing-based analysis and LLMs for validation. Our approach averagely achieves 91.03% precision and 74.00% recall upon synthetic benchmarks and boosts the precision by 21.99% with the sanitization. The evaluation upon real-world Android malware applications also demonstrates the superiority over an industrial analyzer, surpassing the precision and... | Chengpeng Wang, Wuqi Zhang, Zian Su, Xiangzhe Xu, Xiangyu Zhang |  |

Contextualizing information extraction helps to scope the validity of automated finings when aggregating them as knowledge graphs. Our approach uses a high-quality curated dataset of time and location annotations in a corpus of epidemiology papers to train an encoder-decoder architecture. We also explored the use of data augmentation techniques during training. Our findings suggest that a relatively small fine-tuned encoder-decoder model performs better than out-of-the-box LLMs and semantic role labeling parsers to accurate predict the relevant scenario information of a particular entity or event. | Enrique NoriegaAtala, Robert Vacareanu, Salena Torres Ashton, Adarsh Pyarelal, Clayton T.

Recent methods have used unstructured memory to incrementally process these contexts, but they still suffer from information overload due to the volume of unstructured data handled. In our study, we introduce structured knowledge representations (GU_json), which significantly improve summarization performance by 40% and 14% across two public datasets. Most notably, we propose the Chain-of-Key strategy (CoK_json) that dynamically updates or augments these representations with new information, rather than recreating the structured memory for each new source. This method further enhances performance by 7% and 4% on the datasets. | Eunjeong Hwang, Yichao Zhou, James B. Wendt, Beliz Gunel, Nguyen Vo, Jing Xie, Sandeep Tata |  |

However, they are designated for specific classification or generative tasks, and require model training or finetuning on large-scale datasets with sizeable parameters and tremendous computing, hindering their clinical utility across diverse resource-constrained scenarios in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel and lightweight framework Med-MoE (Mixture-of-Experts) that tackles both discriminative and generative multimodal medical tasks. The learning of Med-MoE consists of three steps: multimodal medical alignment, Instruction tuning and routing, and domain-specific MoE tuning. After aligning multimodal medical images with LLM tokens, we then enable the model for different multimodal medical tasks with instruction tuning, together with a trainable router tailored for expert selection across input modalities.

Current efforts focus on modeling both context-sensitive and speaker-sensitive dependencies and multimodal fusion. Despite the progress, models in Multimodal ERC (MERC) still struggle due to a lack of CommonSense Knowledge (CSK). In contrast, models in textual ERC typically employ CSK to enhance emotion inference. However, in multimodal scenarios, relying solely on textual CSK while neglecting visual CSK may hinder the understanding of visual emotional cues. To address this, we introduce a novel approach called Multiple Knowledge Enhanced Interactive Graph Network (MKE-IGN) to integrate multiple knowledge, such as textual and visual CSK, into the edge representations, thereby facilitating the modeling of relations between utterances and different types of CSK. Furthermore, considering that irrelevant CSK might be retained as noise, MKE-IGN adaptively selects this CSK guided by the... | Geng Tu, Jun Wang, Zhenyu Li, Shiwei Chen, Bin Liang, Xi Zeng, Min Yang, Ruifeng Xu |  |

To address the challenges of hyper-parameter optimization and online adaptation in RAG, we propose the AutoRAG-HP framework, which formulates the hyper-parameter tuning as an online multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem and introduces a novel two-level Hierarchical MAB (Hier-MAB) method for efficient exploration of large search spaces. We conduct extensive experiments on tuning hyper-parameters, such as top-k retrieved documents, prompt compression ratio, and embedding methods, using the ALCE-ASQA and Natural Questions datasets. Our evaluation from jointly optimization all three hyper-parameters demonstrate that MAB-based online learning methods can achieve Recall@5 ≈ 0.8 for scenarios with prominent gradients in search space, using only ~20% of the LLM API calls required by the Grid Search approach.... | Jia Fu, Xiaoting Qin, Fangkai Yang, Lu Wang, Jue Zhang, Qingwei Lin, Yubo Chen, Dongmei Zhang, Saravan Rajmohan, Qi Zhang |  |

However, enhancing the performance of LLMs typically requires scaling up model sizes or fine-tuning with additional datasets, which results in substantial computational costs. This paper poses an intriguing question: Can we improve the performance of LLMs without additional training? Drawing inspiration from signal processing principles, which suggest that noise often resides in high-frequency components while low-frequency components carry the essence of signals, we propose uncovering untapped potential in LLMs from a frequency perspective. We hypothesize that the high-frequency components in the weight matrices of LLMs’ linear layers may conceal noise that interferes with predictive accuracy. Therefore, we propose conducting spectral modulation in the parameter space of LLMs, which can seamlessly integrate with various models... | Peng Sun, Yao Zhu, Yunjian Zhang, Xiu Yan, Zizhe Wang, Xiangyang Ji |  |

Nonetheless, the generalization of PLMs towards unseen languages is poor, resulting in significantly worse language performance, or even generating nonsensical responses that are comparable to a random baseline. This limitation has been a longstanding problem of PLMs raising the problem of diversity and equal access to language modeling technology. In this work, we solve this limitation by introducing LinguAlchemy, a regularization technique that incorporates various aspects of languages covering typological, geographical, and phylogenetic constraining the resulting representation of PLMs to better characterize the corresponding linguistics constraints. LinguAlchemy significantly improves the accuracy performance of mBERT and XLM-R on unseen languages by ~18% and ~2%, respectively compared to fully finetuned models and displaying a high degree of unseen language generalization.... | Muhammad Farid Adilazuarda, Samuel Cahyawijaya, Genta Indra Winata, Ayu Purwarianti, Alham Fikri Aji |  |

While traditional BERT-based methods have shown limited success, large language models (LLMs) have brought new possibilities. It is promising to leverage their remarkable comprehension ability to understand textual queries. However, implementing LLMs is non-trivial for two main reasons. Firstly, real-world EMTC datasets can be extremely large, with candidate product pairs reaching up to ten million in real-world scenarios, which poses significant challenges in data ingestion. Secondly, the large size of LLMs makes computation and memory demands prohibitive for EMTC applications. To this end, we propose QUEST, a Quantized and Efficient Learning with Sampling Technique. QUEST includes a tailored hash sampling module that reduces the data volume to one-fourth of its original size. Additionally, we perform compressive fine-tuning LLMs with only... | Chuang Zhou, Junnan Dong, Xiao Huang, Zirui Liu, Kaixiong Zhou, Zhaozhuo Xu |  |

To address these shortcomings, we create UniSumEval benchmark, which extends the range of input context (e.g., domain, length) and provides fine-grained, multi-dimensional annotations. We use AI assistance in data creation, identifying potentially hallucinogenic input texts, and also helping human annotators reduce the difficulty of fine-grained annotation tasks. With UniSumEval, we benchmark nine latest language models as summarizers, offering insights into their performance across varying input contexts and evaluation dimensions.

In this paper, we propose an approach for training a generator to improve argument recognition. Our method enhances the probabilities of proper arguments in a reasoning program generation so that the arguments comprising the ground truth have higher weights. The proposed approach consists of an argument aggregator to model the probabilities in each candidate generation and an argument set loss to compute the cross-entropy between that probability and the candidates’ existence in the ground truth in terms of the argument set. In our experiments, we show performance improvements of 3.62% and 3.98% in execution accuracy and program accuracy, respectively, over the existing FinQANet model based on a financial... | Jinsu Lim, Yechan Hwang, YoungJun Lee, HoJin Choi |  |

Naturally, it involves the detection and correction subtasks, which interact with each other dynamically. Such interactions are bi-directional, i.e., the detection result would help reduce the risk of over-correction and under-correction while the knowledge learnt from correction would help prevent false detection. Current CSC approaches are of two types: correction-only or single-directional detection-to-correction interactive frameworks. Nonetheless, they overlook the bi-directional interactions between detection and correction. This paper aims to fill the gap by proposing a Bi-directional Detector-Corrector framework for CSC (Bi-DCSpell). Notably, Bi-DCSpell contains separate detection and correction encoders, followed by a novel interactive learning module facilitating bi-directional feature interactions between detection and correction to improve each other’s... | Haiming Wu, Hanqing Zhang, Richeng Xuan, Dawei Song |  |

However, LLMs often struggle to effectively parse and utilize sparse and complex personal context without additional processing or contextual enrichment, underscoring the need for more sophisticated context understanding mechanisms. In this work, we propose Guided Profile Generation (GPG), a general method designed to generate personal profiles in natural language. As is observed, intermediate guided profile generation enables LLMs to summarize, and extract the important, distinctive features from the personal context into concise, descriptive sentences, precisely tailoring their generation more closely to an individual’s unique habits and preferences. Our experimental results show that GPG improves LLM’s personalization ability across different tasks, for... | Jiarui Zhang |  |

Diverse root cause analysis faults require multi-agents with diverse expertise. To mitigate the hallucination problem of large language models (LLMs), we design blockchain-inspired voting to ensure the reliability of the analysis by using a decentralized decision-making process. To avoid non-terminating loops led by common circular dependency in MSA, we objectively limit steps and standardize task processing through Agent Workflow. We propose a pioneering framework, multi-Agent Blockchain-inspired Collaboration for root cause analysis in micro-services architecture (mABC), where multiple agents based on the powerful LLMs follow Agent Workflow and collaborate in blockchain-inspired voting. Specifically, seven specialized agents derived from Agent Workflow... | Wei Zhang, Hongcheng Guo, Jian Yang, Zhoujin Tian, Yi Zhang, Chaoran Yan, Zhoujun Li, Tongliang Li, Xu Shi, Liangfan Zheng, Bo Zhang |  |

However, Transformer-based LLMs suffer a performance degradation when modeling long-term contexts due to they discard some information to reduce computational overhead. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective method to enable LLMs to take a deep breath, encouraging them to summarize information contained within discrete text chunks. Specifically, we segment the text into multiple chunks and insert special token <SR> at the end of each chunk. We then modify the attention mask to integrate the chunk’s information into the corresponding <SR> token. This facilitates LLMs to interpret information not only from historical individual tokens but also from the <SR> token, aggregating the chunk’s semantic information. Experiments on language modeling and out-of-domain downstream tasks validate the superiority of our approach. | Weiyao Luo, Suncong Zheng, Heming Xia, Weikang Wang, Yan Lei, Tianyu Liu, Shuang Chen, Zhifang Sui |  |

The human preference data used to train the reward model consists of a prompt and a response pair, with humans annotating which response better aligns with human value preferences. Due to the complexity and subjectivity of the annotation task, multiple organizations including OpenAI and Anthropic report significant noise in the human preference datasets, leading to instability and deviation in reward model training from human values. We discover that the difference in scores assigned to response pairs by the reward model effectively indicates the quality of data, and data of varying qualities show significant distinctions in reward model training. We introduce a method that automatically adjusts reward modeling based on data quality, reducing the impact of noise and making full use of dataset. Experiments on multiple human preference... | Binghai Wang, Rui Zheng, Lu Chen, Zhiheng Xi, Wei Shen, Yuhao Zhou, Dong Yan, Tao Gui, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang |  |

Unlike single-modality LLMs that manage only textual contexts, the KV cache of long-context MLLMs includes representations from multiple images with temporal and spatial relationships and related textual contexts. The predominance of image tokens means traditional optimizations for LLMs’ KV caches are unsuitable for multimodal long-context settings, and no prior works have addressed this challenge.In this work, we introduce \*\*LOOK-M\*\*, a pioneering, fine-tuning-free approach that efficiently reduces the multimodal KV cache size while maintaining performance comparable to a full cache. We observe that during prompt prefill, the model prioritizes more textual attention over image features, and based on the multimodal interaction... | Zhongwei Wan, Ziang Wu, Che Liu, Jinfa Huang, Zhihong Zhu, Peng Jin, Longyue Wang, Li Yuan |  |

Among them, ROME is particularly concerning, as it could disrupt LLMs with only a single edit. In this paper, we study the root causes of such collapse. Through extensive analysis, we identify two primary factors that contribute to the collapse: i) inconsistent handling of prefixed and unprefixed keys in the parameter update equation may result in very small denominators, causing excessively large parameter updates; ii) the subject of collapse cases is usually the first token, whose unprefixed key distribution significantly differs from the prefixed key distribution in autoregressive transformers, causing the aforementioned issue to materialize. To validate our findings, we propose a simple yet effective approach: uniformly using prefixed keys during editing phase and adding prefixes during testing phase to... | Wanli Yang, Fei Sun, Jiajun Tan, Xinyu Ma, Du Su, Dawei Yin, Huawei Shen |  |

However, many practical applications demand the seamless integration of both retrieval and generation. This paper introduces a novel and efficient One-pass Generation and retrieval framework (OneGen), designed to improve LLMs’ performance on tasks that require both generation and retrieval. The proposed framework bridges the traditionally separate training approaches for generation and retrieval by incorporating retrieval tokens generated autoregressively. This enables a single LLM to handle both tasks simultaneously in a unified forward pass. We conduct experiments on two distinct types of composite tasks, RAG and Entity Linking, to validate the pluggability, effectiveness, and efficiency of OneGen in training and inference. Furthermore, our results show that integrating... | Jintian Zhang, Cheng Peng, Mengshu Sun, Xiang Chen, Lei Liang, Zhiqiang Zhang, Jun Zhou, Huajun Chen, Ningyu Zhang |  |

To address the challenges of current alignment methodologies, we introduce self-evolution fine-tuning (SEFT) for LLM alignment, aiming to eliminate the need for annotated samples while retaining the stability and efficiency of SFT. SEFT first trains an adaptive reviser to elevate low-quality responses while maintaining high-quality ones. The reviser then gradually guides the policy’s optimization by fine-tuning it with enhanced responses. The method excels in utilizing unlimited unannotated data to optimize policies via supervised fine-tuning. Our experiments on AlpacaEval and MT-Bench demonstrate the effectiveness of SEFT and its advantages over existing alignment techniques. | Ruijun Chen, Jiehao Liang, Shiping Gao, Fanqi Wan, Xiaojun Quan |  |

It is commonly believed that fine-tuning can surpass ICL given sufficient training samples as it allows the model to adjust its internal parameters based on the data. However, this paper presents a counterintuitive finding: For tasks with implicit patterns, ICL captures these patterns significantly better than fine-tuning. We developed several datasets featuring implicit patterns, such as sequences determining answers through parity or identifying reducible terms in calculations. We then evaluated the models’ understanding of these patterns under both fine-tuning and ICL across models ranging from 0.5B to 7B parameters. The results indicate that models employing ICL can quickly grasp deep patterns and significantly improve accuracy. In contrast, fine-tuning, despite utilizing thousands of times more training samples than ICL, achieved only limited... | Qingyu Yin, Xuzheng He, Chak Tou Leong, Fan Wang, Yanzhao Yan, Xiaoyu Shen, Qiang Zhang |  |

Still, their growing scale has increased the computational burden, necessitating a balance between efficiency and performance. Low-rank compression, a promising technique, reduces non-essential parameters by decomposing weight matrices into products of two low-rank matrices. Yet, its application in LLMs has not been extensively studied. The key to low-rank compression lies in low-rank factorization and low-rank dimensions allocation. To address the challenges of low-rank compression in LLMs, we conduct empirical research on the low-rank characteristics of large models. We propose a low-rank compression method suitable for LLMs. This approach involves precise estimation of feature distributions through pooled covariance matrices and a Bayesian optimization strategy for allocating low-rank dimensions. Experiments on the LLaMA-2 models demonstrate that our method outperforms existing strong... | Yixin Ji, Yang Xiang, Juntao Li, Qingrong Xia, Zi Ye, Xinyu Duan, Zhefeng Wang, Kehai Chen, Min Zhang |  |

Emosical comprises video, vocal audio, text, and character identity paired samples with annotated emotion tags. Emosical provides rich emotion annotations for each sample by inferring the background story of the characters. To achieve this, we leverage the musical theatre script, which contains the characters’ complete background stories and narrative contexts. The annotation pipeline includes feeding the speaking character, text, global persona, and context of the dialogue and song track into a large language model. To verify the effectiveness of our tagging scheme, we perform an ablation study by bypassing each step of the pipeline. The ablation results show the usefulness of each component in generating accurate emotion tags. A subjective test is conducted to compare the generated tags of each ablation result. We also perform a statistical analysis to find out the global characteristics of the... | Hayoon Kim, Ahyeon Choi, Sungho Lee, Hyun Jung, Kyogu Lee |  |

In this work, we introduce \*\*Integrated Value Guidance (IVG)\*\*, a method that uses implicit and explicit value functions to guide language model decoding at token and chunk-level respectively, efficiently aligning large language models purely at inference time.This approach circumvents the complexities of direct fine-tuning and outperforms traditional methods.Empirically, we demonstrate the versatility of IVG across various tasks. In controlled sentiment generation and summarization tasks, our method significantly improves the alignment of large models using inference-time guidance from \*\*gpt2\*\*-based value functions. Moreover, in a more challenging instruction-following benchmark AlpacaEval 2.0, we show that both specifically tuned and off-the-shelf value functions greatly improve the length-controlled win rates of large models... | Zhixuan Liu, Zhanhui Zhou, Yuanfu Wang, Chao Yang, Yu Qiao |  |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in Natural Language Processing (NLP), they struggle with Classical Chinese Understanding (CCU), especially in data-demanding and knowledge-intensive tasks. In response to this dilemma, we propose TongGu (mean understanding ancient and modern), the first CCU-specific LLM, underpinned by three core contributions. First, we construct a two-stage instruction-tuning dataset ACCN-INS derived from rich classical Chinese corpora, aiming to unlock the full CCU potential of LLMs. Second, we propose Redundancy-Aware Tuning (RAT) to prevent catastrophic forgetting, enabling TongGu to acquire new capabilities while preserving its foundational knowledge.

Theory of mind evaluations currently focuses on testing models using machine-generated data or game settings prone to shortcuts and spurious correlations, which lacks evaluation of machine ToM ability in real-world human interaction scenarios. This poses a pressing demand to develop new real-world scenario benchmarks. We introduce NegotiationToM, a new benchmark designed to stress-test machine ToM in real-world negotiation surrounding covered multi-dimensional mental states (i.e., desires, beliefs, and intentions). Our benchmark builds upon the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agent modeling theory and conducts the necessary empirical experiments to evaluate large language models. Our findings demonstrate that NegotiationToM is challenging for state-of-the-art LLMs, as they consistently perform significantly worse than humans, even when employing... | Chunkit Chan, Cheng Jiayang, Yauwai Yim, Zheye Deng, Wei Fan, Haoran Li, Xin Liu, Hongming Zhang, Weiqi Wang, Yangqiu Song |  |

The conventional VQA models suffer from language bias that indicates a spurious correlation between textual questions and answers. Given the outstanding effectiveness of counterfactual causal inference in eliminating bias, we propose a model agnostic dual-debiasing framework based on Counterfactual Causal Effect (DCCE), which explicitly models two types of language bias(i.e., shortcut and distribution bias) by separate branches under the counterfactual inference framework. The effects of both types ofbias on answer prediction can be effectively mitigated by subtracting direct effect of textual questions on answers from total effect ofvisual questions on answers. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed DCCE framework significantly reduces language biasand achieves state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark datasets... | Lingyun Song, Chengkun Yang, Xuanyu Li, Xuequn Shang |  |

In this paper, we propose PyramidCodec, a hierarchical discrete representation of audio, for long audio-domain music generation. Specifically, we employ residual vector quantization on different levels of features to obtain the hierarchical discrete representation. The highest level of features has the largest hop size, resulting in the most compact token sequence. The quantized higher-level representation is up-sampled and combined with lower-level features to apply residual vector quantization and obtain lower-level discrete representations. Furthermore, we design a hierarchical training strategy to ensure that the details are gradually added with more levels of tokens. By performing hierarchical tokenization, the overall token sequence represents information at various scales, facilitating long-context... | Jianyi Chen, Zheqi Dai, Zhen Ye, Xu Tan, Qifeng Liu, Yike Guo, Wei Xue |  |

While these CRSs are highly persuasive, they can mislead users by incorporating incredible information in their explanations, ultimately damaging the long-term trust between users and the CRS. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective method, called PC-CRS, to enhance the credibility of CRS’s explanations during persuasion. It guides the explanation generation through our proposed credibility-aware persuasive strategies and then gradually refines explanations via post-hoc self-reflection. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of PC-CRS in promoting persuasive and credible explanations. Further analysis reveals the reason behind current methods producing incredible explanations and the potential of credible explanations to improve recommendation accuracy. | Peixin Qin, Chen Huang, Yang Deng, Wenqiang Lei, TatSeng Chua |  |

Although this is an important prerequisite for their practicality, this problem has hardly been investigated. More recent large language models (LLMs), including instruction-tuned LLMs, have not been analyzed yet, and only one study looks beyond typos. We close this gap by reproducing this study and extending it with a systematic analysis of more recent models, including Sentence-BERT, CharacterBERT, E5-Mistral, AnglE, and Ada v2. We further investigate if instruct-LLMs can be prompted for robustness. Our results are mixed in that the previously observed robustness issues for cross-encoders also apply to bi-encoders that use much larger LLMs, albeit to a lesser extent. While further LLM scaling may improve their embeddings, their cost-effective use for all but large deployments is limited. Training data that includes query... | Tim Hagen, Harrisen Scells, Martin Potthast |  |

It compromises the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) during fine-tuning, yet the underlying causes have not been thoroughly investigated. This paper takes the first step to reveal the direct link between the flatness of the model loss landscape and the extent of CF in the field of LLMs. Based on this, we introduce the sharpness-aware minimization to mitigate CF by flattening the loss landscape. Experiments on three widely-used fine-tuning datasets, spanning different model scales, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in alleviating CF. Analyses show that we nicely complement the existing anti-forgetting strategies, further enhancing the resistance of LLMs to CF. | Hongyu Li, Liang Ding, Meng Fang, Dacheng Tao |  |

Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs often exhibit significant performance disparities across different languages and cultural contexts, as demonstrated by various text-only benchmarks. However, current research lacks such benchmarks for multimodal visio-linguistic settings. This work fills this gap by introducing M5, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LMMs on diverse vision-language tasks within a multilingual and multicultural context. M5 includes eight datasets covering five tasks and 41 languages, with a focus on underrepresented languages and culturally diverse images. Furthermore, we introduce two novel datasets, M5-VGR and M5-VLOD, including a new Visio-Linguistic Outlier Detection task, in which all evaluated open-source models fail to... | Florian Schneider, Sunayana Sitaram |  |

Previous work has shown that LLMs display biases in emotion attribution along gender lines. However, unlike gender, which says little about our values, religion, as a socio-cultural system, prescribes a set of beliefs and values for its followers. Religions, therefore, cultivate certain emotions. Moreover, these rules are explicitly laid out and interpreted by religious leaders. Using emotion attribution, we explore how different religions are represented in LLMs. We find that:Major religions in the US and European countries are represented with more nuance, displaying a more shaded model of their beliefs.Eastern religions like Hinduism and Buddhism are strongly stereotyped.Judaism and Islam are stigmatized – the models’ refusal skyrocket. We ascribe these to cultural bias in LLMs and the scarcity of NLP literature on religion. In the rare instances where religion is... | Flor Miriam Plaza del Arco, Amanda Cercas Curry, Susanna Paoli, Alba Cercas Curry, Dirk Hovy |  |

Most existing studies focus on improving the performance of the target domain by fine-tuning domain-specific models (trained on source domains) based on the target domain dataset. Few works propose continual learning tasks for ABSA, which aim to learn the target domain’s ability while maintaining the history domains’ abilities. In this paper, we propose a Large Language Model-based Continual Learning (LLM-CL) model for ABSA. First, we design a domain knowledge decoupling module to learn a domain-invariant adapter and separate domain-variant adapters dependently with an orthogonal constraint. Then, we introduce a domain knowledge warmup strategy to align the representation between domain-invariant and domain-variant knowledge. In the test phase, we index the corresponding domain-variant knowledge via domain positioning to not require each... | Xuanwen Ding, Jie Zhou, Liang Dou, Qin Chen, Yuanbin Wu, Arlene Chen, Liang He |  |

We propose a Plan-then-Reason framework to answer different types of user queries over tables with sentence context. The framework first plans the reasoning paths over the context, then assigns each step to program-based or textual reasoning to reach the final answer. This framework enhances the table reasoning abilities for both in-context learning and fine-tuning methods. GPT-3.5-Turbo following Plan-then-Reason framework surpasses other prompting baselines without self-consistency while using less API calls and in-context demonstrations. We also construct an instruction tuning set TrixInstruct to evaluate the effectiveness of fine-tuning with this framework. We present ProTrix model family by finetuning models on TrixInstruct. Our experiments show that ProTrix family generalizes to diverse unseen tabular tasks with only 6k training instances. We further demonstrate that ProTrix can generate accurate and... | Zirui Wu, Yansong Feng |  |

This survey examines recent advancements in HS moderation, focusing on the burgeoning role of large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) in detecting, explaining, debiasing, and countering HS. We begin with a comprehensive analysis of current literature, uncovering how text, images, and audio interact to spread HS. The combination of these modalities adds complexity and subtlety to HS dissemination. We also identified research gaps, particularly in underrepresented languages and cultures, and highlight the need for solutions in low-resource settings. The survey concludes with future research directions, including novel AI methodologies, ethical AI governance, and the development of context-aware systems.

This trend raises concerns due to our limited understanding of LLM behaviour in this domain, especially with respect to political bias. Existing studies predominantly focus on LLMs undertaking political questionnaires, which offers only limited insights into their biases and operational nuances. To address this gap, our study establishes a new curated dataset that contains 2,100 human-written articles and utilises their descriptions to generate 56,700 synthetic articles using nine LLMs. This enables us to analyse shifts in properties between human-authored and machine-generated articles, with this study focusing on political bias, detecting it using both supervised models and LLMs. Our findings reveal significant disparities between base and instruction-tuned LLMs, with instruction-tuned models exhibiting... | Filip Trhlík, Pontus Stenetorp |  |

However, current corpora with unconventional entities as event arguments are limited in event types and lack rich multi-events and shared arguments. Financial commentary not only describes the basic elements of an event but also states the background, scope, manner, condition, result, and tool used for the event, as well as the tense, intensity, and emotions of actions or state changes. Therefore, it is not suitable to develop event types that include only a few specific roles, as these cannot comprehensively capture the event’s semantics. Also, there are affluent complex entities serving as event arguments, multiple events, and shared event arguments. To advance the practicality of event extraction technology, this paper first develops a general open event template from the perspective of understanding the meaning of events, aiming to comprehensively... | Qizhi Wan, Changxuan Wan, Rong Hu, Dexi Liu, Xu Wenwu, Kang Xu, Zou Meihua, Liu Tao, Jie Yang, Zhenwei Xiong |  |

Existing methods often struggle with token limits and fail to adequately model hierarchical relationships within documents. To address these constraints, we propose a novel model leveraging a graph-tree structure. Our approach integrates syntax trees for sentence encodings and document graphs for document encodings, which capture fine-grained syntactic relationships and broader document contexts, respectively. We use Tree Transformers to generate sentence encodings, while a graph attention network models inter- and intra-sentence dependencies. During training, we implement bidirectional information propagation from word-to-sentence-to-document and vice versa, which enriches the contextual representation. Our proposed method enables a comprehensive understanding of content at all hierarchical levels and effectively handles arbitrarily... | Sudipta Singha Roy, Xindi Wang, Robert E.

In this study, we explore the understanding of characters in full-length books, which contain complex narratives and numerous interacting characters. We define two tasks: character description, which generates a brief factual profile, and character analysis, which offers an in-depth interpretation, including character development, personality, and social context. We introduce the BookWorm dataset, pairing books from the Gutenberg Project with human-written descriptions and analyses. Using this dataset, we evaluate state-of-the-art long-context models in zero-shot and fine-tuning settings, utilizing both retrieval-based and hierarchical processing for book-length inputs. Our findings show that retrieval-based approaches outperform hierarchical ones in both tasks. Additionally, fine-tuned models using coreference-based retrieval produce the most factual descriptions, as measured by fact- and... | Argyrios Papoudakis, Mirella Lapata, Frank Keller |  |

However, it is not clear how the application of induced grammar could enhance practical performance in downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce an unsupervised grammar induction method for language understanding and generation. We construct a grammar parser to induce constituency structures and dependency relations, which is simultaneously trained on downstream tasks without additional syntax annotations. The induced grammar features are subsequently incorporated into Transformer as a syntactic mask to guide self-attention. We evaluate and apply our method to multiple machine translation tasks and natural language understanding tasks. Our method demonstrates superior performance compared to the original Transformer and other models enhanced with external parsers.

However, LLMs are still suffering from hallucinations. In this work, we propose an inference-time method, Self-Highlighted Hesitation (SH2), to help LLMs decode more truthfully. SH2 is based on a simple fact rooted in information theory that for an LLM, the tokens predicted with lower probabilities are prone to be more informative than others. Our analysis shows that these low-confidence tokens are more likely to be closely related to factual information, such as nouns, proper nouns, and adjectives. Therefore, we propose to ”highlight” the factual information by selecting key tokens with the lowest probabilities and concatenating them to the original context, thus forcing the model to repeatedly read and hesitate on these tokens before generation. During decoding, we also adopt contrastive decoding to emphasize the difference in output probabilities brought by the hesitation.

In this paper, we aim to advance the performance of Llama2 models on Romanian tasks. We tackle the problem of reduced computing resources by using QLoRA for training. We release RoQLlama-7b, a quantized LLM, which shows equal or improved results compared to its full-sized counterpart when tested on seven Romanian downstream tasks in the zero-shot setup. Also, it consistently achieves higher average scores across all few-shot prompts. Additionally, we introduce a novel Romanian dataset, namely RoMedQA, which contains single-choice medical questions in Romanian. | GeorgeAndrei Dima, AndreiMarius Avram, CristianGeorge Craciun, DumitruClementin Cercel |  |

While LVLMs exhibit excellent ability in language understanding, question answering, and conversations of visual inputs, they are prone to producing hallucinations. While several methods are proposed to evaluate the hallucinations in LVLMs, most are reference-based and depend on external tools, which complicates their practical application. To assess the viability of alternative methods, it is critical to understand whether the reference-free approaches, which do not rely on any external tools, can efficiently detect hallucinations. Therefore, we initiate an exploratory study to demonstrate the effectiveness of different reference-free solutions in detecting hallucinations in LVLMs. In particular, we conduct an extensive study on three kinds of techniques: uncertainty-based, consistency-based, and supervised uncertainty quantification methods on four representative LVLMs across two different tasks.... | Qing Li, Jiahui Geng, Chenyang Lyu, Derui Zhu, Maxim Panov, Fakhri Karray |  |

However, integrating listening capabilities effectively remains a significant challenge for generalization and complex auditory task execution. In this work, we introduce WavLLM, a robust and adaptive speech large language model featuring dual encoders—a Whisper encoder for semantics and a WavLM encoder for speaker characteristics. Within the two-stage curriculum learning framework, WavLLM first builds its foundational capabilities by optimizing on mixed elementary single tasks, followed by advanced multi-task training on more complex tasks such as combinations of the elementary tasks. To enhance the flexibility and adherence to different tasks and instructions, a prompt-aware LoRA weight adapter is introduced in the second advanced multi-task training stage. We validate the proposed model on universal speech benchmarks and also apply it... | Shujie Hu, Long Zhou, Shujie Liu, Sanyuan Chen, Lingwei Meng, Hongkun Hao, Jing Pan, Xunying Liu, Jinyu Li, Sunit Sivasankaran, Linquan Liu, Furu Wei |  |

However, the influence of such information on task completion and factual consistency, which are important criteria for task-oriented and document-grounded dialogues, is not yet known. To address this, we introduce FEDI, the first English task-oriented and document-grounded dialogue dataset annotated with this information. Our experiments with Flan-T5, GPT-2 and Llama 2 show a particularly positive impact on task completion and factual consistency. Participants in our human evaluation reported that the responses generated by the feedback-trained models were more informative (Flan-T5 and GPT-2), relevant and factual consistent (Llama 2). | Dominic Petrak, Thy Thy Tran, Iryna Gurevych |  |

Arguments are a means of bringing the perspectives of people with different ideologies closer together, depending on how well they reach their audience. In this paper, we study how to computationally turn ineffective arguments into effective arguments for people with certain ideologies by using instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs), looking closely at style features. For development and evaluation, we collect ineffective arguments per ideology from debate.org, and we generate about 30k, which we rewrite using three LLM methods tailored to our task: zero-shot prompting, few-shot prompting, and LLM steering. Our experiments provide evidence that LLMs naturally improve argument effectiveness for liberals.

A Comprehensive Benchmark of Long Context Capable Approaches](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.findings-emnlp.266) |  | 0 | Long context capability is a crucial competency for large language models (LLMs) as it mitigates the human struggle to digest long-form texts. This capability enables complex task-solving scenarios such as book summarization, code assistance, and many more tasks that are traditionally manpower-intensive. However, transformer-based LLMs face significant challenges with long context input due to the growing size of the KV cache and the intrinsic complexity of attending to extended inputs; where multiple schools of efficiency-driven approaches — such as KV cache quantization, token dropping, prompt compression, linear-time sequence models, and hybrid architectures — have been proposed to produce efficient yet long context-capable models. Despite these advancements, no existing work has comprehensively benchmarked these methods in a reasonably aligned environment. In this work, we fill this gap by providing a taxonomy of current methods and evaluating 10+ state-of-the-art approaches... | Jiayi Yuan, Hongyi Liu, Shaochen (Henry) Zhong, YuNeng Chuang, Songchen Li, Guanchu Wang, Duy Le, Hongye Jin, Vipin Chaudhary, Zhaozhuo Xu, Zirui Liu, Xia Ben Hu |  |

An ambitious vision – serving users by manipulating massive API-based tools – has been proposed and explored. However, we find a widely accepted evaluation mechanism for generic agents is still missing. This work aims to fill this gap. We decompose tool use capability into seven aspects and form a thorough evaluation schema. In addition, we design and release an instruction dataset and a toolset – the two sides that the agents bridge between – following the principle of reflecting real-world challenges. Furthermore, we evaluate multiple generic agents. Our findings can inspire future research in improving LLM-based agents and rethink the philosophy of API design. | Bing Liu, Jianxiang Zhou, Dan Meng, Haonan Lu |  |

However, existing open-source image instruction fine-tuning datasets, containing limited question-answer pairs per image, do not fully exploit visual information to enhance the multimodal mathematical reasoning capabilities of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). To bridge this gap, we address the lack of high-quality, diverse multimodal mathematical datasets by collecting 40K high-quality images with question-answer pairs from 24 existing datasets and synthesizing 320K new pairs, creating the MathV360K dataset, which enhances both the breadth and depth of multimodal mathematical questions. We introduce Math-LLaVA, a LLaVA-1.5-based model fine-tuned with MathV360K. This novel approach significantly improves the multimodal mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLaVA-1.5, achieving a 19-point increase and comparable performance to GPT-4V on MathVista’s minitest... | Wenhao Shi, Zhiqiang Hu, Yi Bin, Junhua Liu, Yang Yang, SeeKiong Ng, Lidong Bing, Roy KaWei Lee |  |

It aims to diagnose current models for various instruction categories at a finer-grained level. The framework is structured around the context-free grammar (CFG) of the task. The CFG serves as the basis for the problem decomposition and the core premise of the instruction categories design. We propose a semi-automatic method for CFG construction with the help of Large-Language Models (LLMs). Then, we induct and generate data spanning five principal instruction categories (i.e. direction change, landmark recognition, region recognition, vertical movement, and numerical comprehension). Our analysis of different models reveals notable performance discrepancies and recurrent issues. The stagnation of numerical comprehension, heavy selective biases over directional concepts, and other interesting findings contribute to the development of future language-guided navigation systems.

However, effectively identifying the most relevant tools for a given task becomes a key bottleneck as the toolset size grows, hindering reliable tool utilization. To address this, we introduce Re-Invoke, an unsupervised tool retrieval method designed to scale effectively to large toolsets without training. Specifically, we first generate a diverse set of synthetic queries that comprehensively cover different aspects of the query space associated with each tool document during the tool indexing phase. Second, we leverage LLM’s query understanding capabilities to extract key tool-related context and underlying intents from user queries during the inference phase. Finally, we employ a novel multi-view similarity ranking strategy based on intents to pinpoint the most relevant tools for each query.

This enables models to delete user information and comply with privacy regulations. While retraining the model from scratch on the training set excluding the instances to be “\*forgotten\*” would result in a desired unlearned model, owing to the size of datasets and models, it is infeasible. Hence, unlearning algorithms have been developed, where the goal is to obtain an unlearned model that behaves as closely as possible to the retrained model. Consequently, evaluating an unlearning method involves - (i) randomly selecting a \*forget\* set (i.e., the training instances to be unlearned), (ii) obtaining an unlearned and a retrained model, and (iii) comparing the performance of the unlearned and the retrained model on the test and forget set. However, when the forget set is randomly selected, the unlearned model is almost often similar to the... | Leon Wichert, Sandipan Sikdar |  |

This study introduces a novel three-module framework to evaluate the moral beliefs of four prominent large language models. Initially, we constructed a dataset containing 472 moral choice scenarios in Chinese, derived from moral words. The decision-making process of the models in these scenarios reveals their moral principle preferences. By ranking these moral choices, we discern the varying moral beliefs held by different language models. Additionally, through moral debates, we investigate the firmness of these models to their moral choices. Our findings indicate that English language models, namely ChatGPT and Gemini, closely mirror moral decisions of the sample of Chinese university students, demonstrating strong adherence to their choices and a preference for individualistic moral beliefs. In contrast, Chinese models such as Ernie and ChatGLM lean towards... | Xuelin Liu, Yanfei Zhu, Shucheng Zhu, Pengyuan Liu, Ying Liu, Dong Yu |  |

Knowledge Editing (KE) aims to overcome this challenge using weight updates that do not require expensive retraining. We propose treating KE as an LLM alignment problem. Toward this goal, we introduce Knowledge Direct Preference Optimization (KDPO), a variation of the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) that is more effective for knowledge modifications. Our method is based on an online approach that continually updates the knowledge stored in the model. We use the current knowledge as a negative sample and the new knowledge we want to introduce as a positive sample in a process called DPO. We also use teacher-forcing for negative sample generation and optimize using the positive sample, which helps maintain localized changes. We tested our KE method on various datasets and models, comparing it to several cutting-edge methods, with 100 and... | Amit Rozner, Barak Battash, Lior Wolf, Ofir Lindenbaum |  |

Existing work generates synthetic queries from domain-specific documents to jointly train the retriever. However, the conventional query generator assumes the query as a question, thus failing to accommodate general search intents. A more lenient approach incorporates task-adaptive elements, such as few-shot learning with an 137B LLM. In this paper, we challenge a trend equating query and question, and instead conceptualize query generation task as a “compilation” of high-level intent into task-adaptive query. Specifically, we propose EGG, a query generator that better adapts to wide search intents expressed in the BeIR benchmark. Our method outperforms baselines and existing models on four tasks with underexplored intents, while utilizing a query generator 47 times smaller than the previous state-of-the-art. Our findings reveal that instructing the LM with explicit search intent is a key aspect of... | Yoonsang Lee, Minsoo Kim, Seungwon Hwang |  |

Despite their importance, there has been little systematic and empirical research on this concept due to issues of measurement and operationalization. We introduce an iterative human-in-the-loop method to identify media storms in a large-scale corpus of news articles. The text is first transformed into signals of dispersion based on several textual characteristics. In each iteration, we apply unsupervised anomaly detection to these signals; each anomaly is then validated by an expert to confirm the presence of a storm, and those results are then used to tune the anomaly detection in the next iteration. We make available the resulting media storm dataset. Both the method and dataset provide a basis for comprehensive empirical study of media storms. | Dror K.

The generated counterfactuals provide insight into the reasoning behind a model’s predictions by highlighting which words significantly influence the outcomes. Additionally, they can be used to detect model fairness issues and augment the training data to enhance the model’s robustness. A substantial amount of research has been conducted to generate counterfactuals for various NLP tasks, employing different models and methodologies. With the rapid growth of studies in this field, a systematic review is crucial to guide future researchers and developers. To bridge this gap, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of textual counterfactual generation methods, particularly those based on Large Language Models.

Despite the availability of open-source LLMs trained using a wide range of biomedical data, current research on the applications of LLMs to genomics and proteomics is still limited. To fill this gap, we propose a collection of finetuned LLMs and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), known as Geneverse, for three novel tasks in genomic and proteomic research. The models in Geneverse are trained and evaluated based on domain-specific datasets, and we use advanced parameter-efficient finetuning techniques to achieve the model adaptation for tasks including the generation of descriptions for gene functions, protein function inference from its structure, and marker gene selection from spatial transcriptomic data. We demonstrate that adapted LLMs and MLLMs perform well for these tasks and may outperform closed-source large-scale models based on our evaluations focusing on both truthfulness and... | Tianyu Liu, Yijia Xiao, Xiao Luo, Hua Xu, Wenjin Jim Zheng, Hongyu Zhao |  |

Memory mechanisms offer a flexible solution for managing long contexts, utilizing techniques such as compression, summarization, and structuring to facilitate nuanced and efficient handling of large volumes of text. However, existing techniques face challenges with static knowledge integration, leading to insufficient adaptation to task-specific needs and missing multi-segmentation relationships, which hinders the dynamic reorganization and logical combination of relevant segments during the response process. To address these issues, we introduce a novel strategy, Question then Reflection Memory Mechanism (QRMeM), which incorporates a dual-structured memory pool. This pool synergizes static textual content with structured graph guidance, fostering a reflective trial-and-error approach for navigating and identifying relevant segments.

A crucial task in LA involves tracking the evolution of language learners’ competence, namely language development assessment (LDA). However, the majority of LDA research focuses on high-resource languages, with limited attention directed toward low-resource languages. Moreover, existing methodologies primarily depend on linguistic rules and language characteristics, with a limited exploration of exploiting pre-trained language models (PLMs) for LDA. In this paper, we construct the IndoCL corpus (Indonesian Corpus of L2 Learners), which comprises compositions written by undergraduate students majoring in Indonesian language. Moreover, we propose a model for LDA tasks, which automatically extracts language-independent features, relieving laborious computation and reliance on specific language.

However, existing research often overlooks the data quality issues within retrieval results, often caused by inaccurate existing vector-distance-based retrieval methods. We propose to boost the precision of RALMs’ answers from a data quality perspective through the Context-Driven Index Trimming (CDIT) framework, where Context Matching Dependencies (CMDs) are employed as logical data quality rules to capture and regulate the consistency between retrieved contexts. Based on the semantic comprehension capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), CDIT can effectively identify and discard retrieval results that are inconsistent with the query context and further modify indexes in the database, thereby improving answer quality. Experiments demonstrate average improvement of 3.75% in accuracy on challenging open-domain question-answering tasks.

This unfortunate fact requires both humans and models to perform complex reasoning about credibility when working with retrieved information. In NLP, this problem has seen little attention. Indeed, retrieval-augmented models are not typically expected to distrust retrieved documents. Human experts overcome the challenge by gathering signals about the context, reliability, and tendency of source documents - that is, they perform \*source criticism\*. We propose a novel NLP task focused on finding and summarising such signals. We introduce a new dataset of 6,709 “media background checks” derived from Media Bias / Fact Check, a volunteer-run website documenting media bias. We test open-source and closed-source LLM baselines with and without retrieval on this dataset, finding that retrieval greatly improves performance.

Despite this, the concurrent serving of multiple adapters, each with unique matrix shapes, poses significant system-level challenges. To address these issues, we identify an opportunity in structurally sparse adapters, which, unlike low-rank adapters, maintain consistent matrix shapes while varying in sparsity patterns. Leveraging this characteristic, we introduce SpartanServe, a system designed for efficient concurrent serving of LLMs using multiple structurally sparse adapters. SpartanServe employs a unified matrix multiplication operation and a novel memory management technique to enable effective batching. Furthermore, the incorporation of Triton kernels enhances the acceleration of matrix multiplication in the serving process. Experimental results demonstrate that SpartanServe achieves 2.12× speedup over S-LoRA... | Junda Su, Zirui Liu, Zeju Qiu, Weiyang Liu, Zhaozhuo Xu |  |

To address this gap, we introduce CONSTRUCTURE, a novel concept-level benchmark to assess MLLMs’ hierarchical concept understanding and reasoning abilities. Our goal is to evaluate MLLMs across four key aspects: 1) Understanding atomic concepts at different levels of abstraction; 2) Performing upward abstraction reasoning across concepts; 3) Achieving downward concretization reasoning across concepts; and 4) Conducting multi-hop reasoning between sibling or common ancestor concepts. Our findings indicate that even state-of-the-art multimodal models struggle with concept structure reasoning (e.g., GPT-4o averages a score of 62.1%).

Prior works have relied on existing transformer models that lack the capability to prioritize targets effectively. Consequently, these models yield similar performance regardless of whether we utilize or disregard target information, undermining the task’s significance. To address this challenge, we introduce Stanceformer, a target-aware transformer model that incorporates enhanced attention towards the targets during both training and inference. Specifically, we design a Target Awareness matrix that increases the self-attention scores assigned to the targets. We demonstrate the efficacy of the Stanceformer with various BERT-based models, including state-of-the-art models and Large Language Models (LLMs), and evaluate its performance across three stance detection datasets, alongside a zero-shot dataset.

To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for learning human-centered driving decisions from diverse simulation scenarios and environments that incorporate human feedback. Our contributions include a GPT-4-based programming planner that integrates seamlessly with the existing CARLA simulator to understand traffic scenes and react to human instructions. Specifically, we build a human-guided learning pipeline that incorporates human driver feedback directly into the learning process and stores optimal driving programming policy using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

With the pipeline, we construct CultureBank, a knowledge base built upon users’ self-narratives with 12K cultural descriptors sourced from TikTok and 11K from Reddit. Unlike previous cultural knowledge resources, CultureBank contains diverse views on cultural descriptors to allow flexible interpretation of cultural knowledge, and contextualized cultural scenarios to help grounded evaluation. With CultureBank, we evaluate different LLMs’ cultural awareness, and identify areas for improvement. We also fine-tune a language model on CultureBank: experiments show that it achieves better performances on two downstream cultural tasks in a zero-shot setting. Finally, we offer recommendations for future culturally aware language technologies.

While there has been significant progress on learning to use specific tools via fine-tuning, language models still struggle with learning how to robustly use new tools from only a few demonstrations. In this work we introduce a self-verification method which distinguishes between close candidates by self-asking contrastive questions during (1) tool selection; and parameter generation. We construct synthetic, high-quality, self-generated data for this goal using Llama-2 70B, which we intend to release publicly. Extensive experiments on 4 tasks from the ToolBench benchmark, consisting of 17 unseen tools, demonstrate an average improvement of 22% over few-shot baselines, even in scenarios where the distinctions between candidate tools are finely nuanced. | Dheeraj Mekala, Jason Weston, Jack Lanchantin, Roberta Raileanu, Maria Lomeli, Jingbo Shang, Jane DwivediYu |  |

The FaithScore evaluation first identifies sub-sentences containing descriptive statements that need to be verified, then extracts a comprehensive list of atomic facts from these sub-sentences, and finally conducts consistency verification between fine-grained atomic facts and the input image. Meta-evaluation demonstrates that our metric highly correlates with human judgments of faithfulness. We collect two benchmark datasets (i.e. LLaVA-1k and MSCOCO-Cap) for evaluating LVLMs instruction-following hallucinations. We measure hallucinations in state-of-the-art LVLMs with FaithScore on the datasets. Results reveal that current systems are prone to generate hallucinated content unfaithful to the image, which leaves room for future improvements. We hope our metric... | Liqiang Jing, Ruosen Li, Yunmo Chen, Xinya Du |  |

However, large language models (LLMs), especially open-source models, often perform poorly in generating informative questions, as measured by expected information gain (EIG). In this paper, we propose a method to enhance the informativeness of LLM-generated questions in 20-question game dialogues. We sample multiple questions from the same model (LLaMA 2-Chat 7B) for each game and create pairs of low-EIG and high-EIG questions to apply a Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) algorithm. Our results show that this method produces more effective questions (in terms of EIG), even in domains different from those used to train the DPO model. | Davide Mazzaccara, Alberto Testoni, Raffaella Bernardi |  |

As current plagiarism detection tools struggle to keep pace with LLMs’ rapid advancements, the educational community faces the challenge of assessing students’ true problem-solving abilities in the presence of LLMs. In this work, we explore a new paradigm for ensuring fair evaluation—generating adversarial examples which preserve the structure and difficulty of the original questions aimed for assessment, but are unsolvable by LLMs. Focusing on the domain of math word problems, we leverage abstract syntax trees to structurally generate adversarial examples that cause LLMs to produce incorrect answers by simply editing the numeric values in the problems. We conduct experiments on various open- and closed-source LLMs, quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrating that our method significantly degrades their math problem-solving ability. We identify shared vulnerabilities among LLMs and propose a... | Roy Xie, Chengxuan Huang, Junlin Wang, Bhuwan Dhingra |  |

Despite their impressive performance, recent studies have shown that LLMs are vulnerable to deliberately crafted adversarial prompts even when aligned via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback or supervised fine-tuning. While existing defense methods focus on either detecting harmful prompts or reducing the likelihood of harmful responses through various means, defending LLMs against jailbreak attacks based on the inner mechanisms of LLMs remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate how LLMs respond to harmful prompts and propose a novel defense method termed Layer-specific Editing (LED) to enhance the resilience of LLMs against jailbreak attacks. Through LED, we reveal that several critical safety layers exist among the early layers of LLMs. We then show that realigning these safety layers (and some selected additional layers) with the decoded safe response from... | Wei Zhao, Zhe Li, Yige Li, Ye Zhang, Jun Sun |  |

Drawing on research from psychology, communications, and linguistics, we identify six strategies for reframing. We automatically reframe replies to comments according to each strategy, using a Reddit dataset. Through human-centered experiments, we find that the replies generated with our framework are perceived to be significantly more receptive than the original replies and a generic receptiveness baseline. We illustrate how transforming receptiveness, a particular social science construct, into a computational framework, can make LLM generations more aligned with human perceptions. We analyze and discuss the implications of our results, and highlight how a tool based on our framework might be used for more teachable and creative content moderation. | Gauri Kambhatla, Matthew Lease, Ashwin Rajadesingan |  |

However, their performance can be inconsistent when tasked with producing text that adheres to specific structured formats, which is crucial in applications like named entity recognition (NER) or relation extraction (RE). To address this issue, this paper introduces an efficient method, G&O, to enhance their structured text generation capabilities. It breaks the generation into a two-step pipeline: initially, LLMs generate answers in natural language as intermediate responses. Subsequently, LLMs are asked to organize the output into the desired structure, using the intermediate responses as context. G&O effectively separates the generation of content from the structuring process, reducing the pressure of completing two orthogonal tasks simultaneously. Tested on zero-shot NER and RE, the results indicate a significant improvement in LLM performance... | Yinghao Li, Rampi Ramprasad, Chao Zhang |  |

Many disagreements, particularly in politically charged settings, arise because raters have opposing values or beliefs. Vicarious annotation is a method for breaking down disagreement by asking raters how they think others would annotate the data. In this paper, we explore the use of vicarious annotation with analytical methods for moderating rater disagreement. We employ rater cohesion metrics to study the potential influence of political affiliations and demographic backgrounds on raters’ perceptions of offense. Additionally, we utilize CrowdTruth’s rater quality metrics, which consider the demographics of the raters, to score the raters and their annotations. We study how the rater quality metrics influence the in-group and cross-group rater cohesion across the personal and vicarious levels. | Deepak Pandita, Tharindu Cyril Weerasooriya, Sujan Dutta, Sarah Luger, Tharindu Ranasinghe, Ashiqur R.

Nevertheless, we doubt the necessity of shaping agents’ behaviors for accurate social simulations. Instead, this paper emphasizes the importance of spontaneous phenomena, wherein agents deeply engage in contexts and make adaptive decisions without explicit directions. We explored spontaneous cooperation across three competitive scenarios and successfully simulated the gradual emergence of cooperation, findings that align closely with human behavioral data. This approach not only aids the computational social science community in bridging the gap between simulations and real-world dynamics but also offers the AI community a novel method to assess LLMs’ capability of deliberate reasoning.Our source code is available at https://github.com/wuzengqing001225/SABM_ShallWeTeamUp | Zengqing Wu, Run Peng, Shuyuan Zheng, Qianying Liu, Xu Han, Brian Inhyuk Kwon, Makoto Onizuka, Shaojie Tang, Chuan Xiao |  |

In particular, shortcutting pre-trained transformers with linear transformations over early layers has been shown to improve precision in early inference. However, for large language models, even this becomes computationally expensive. In this work, we propose Narrow Jump to Conclusions (NJTC) and Normalized Narrow Jump to Conclusions (N-NJTC) - parameter efficient alternatives to standard linear shortcutting that reduces shortcut parameter count by over 97%. We show that N-NJTC reliably outperforms Identity shortcuts at early stages and offers stable precision from all transformer block levels for GPT-2-XL, Phi3-Mini and Llama2-7B transformer models, demonstrating the viability of more parameter efficient short-cutting approaches. | Amrit Diggavi Seshadri |  |

They also excel in answering questions pertaining to natural language inference and commonsense reasoning. Composing these questions is itself a skilled writing task, so in this paper we consider LLMs as authors of commonsense assessment items. We prompt LLMs to generate items in the style of a prominent benchmark for commonsense reasoning, the Choice of Plausible Alternatives (COPA). We examine the outcome according to analyses facilitated by the LLMs and human annotation. We find that LLMs that succeed in answering the original COPA benchmark are also more successful in authoring their own items. | Melissa Roemmele, Andrew Gordon |  |

Inspired by the well-grounded theory on equivocation, we aim to resolve the closely related problem of response clarity in questions extracted from political interviews, leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and human expertise. To this end, we introduce a novel taxonomy that frames the task of detecting and classifying response clarity and a corresponding clarity classification dataset which consists of question-answer (QA) pairs drawn from political interviews and annotated accordingly. Our proposed two-level taxonomy addresses the clarity of a response in terms of the information provided for a given question (high-level) and also provides a fine-grained taxonomy of evasion techniques that relate to unclear, ambiguous responses (lower-level).

However, such safety training can be removed by fine-tuning the LLM on harmful datasets. While this emerging threat (harmful fine-tuning attacks) has been characterized by previous work, there is little understanding of how we should proceed in constructing and validating defenses against these attacks especially in the case where defenders would not have control of the fine-tuning process. We introduce a formal framework based on the training budget of an attacker which we call “Immunization” conditions. Using a formal characterisation of the harmful fine-tuning problem, we provide a thorough description of what a successful defense must comprise of and establish a set of guidelines on how rigorous defense research that gives us confidence should proceed. | Domenic Rosati, Jan Wehner, Kai Williams, Lukasz Bartoszcze, Hassan Sajjad, Frank Rudzicz |  |

Emotions are the expression of affect or feelings; responses to specific events, or situations – known as emotion causes. Both collectively explain the causality between human emotion and intents. However, existing works treat emotion recognition and emotion cause extraction as two individual problems, ignoring their natural causality. In this paper, we propose a Unified Multimodal Emotion recognition and Emotion-Cause analysis framework (UniMEEC) to explore the causality between emotion and emotion cause. Concretely, UniMEEC reformulates the MERC and MECPE tasks as mask prediction problems and unifies them with a causal prompt template. To differentiate the modal effects, UniMEEC proposes a multimodal causal prompt to probe the pre-trained knowledge specified to modality and implements cross-task and cross-modality interactions under... | Guimin Hu, Zhihong Zhu, Daniel Hershcovich, Lijie Hu, Hasti Seifi, Jiayuan Xie |  |

Although improving the robustness of code generation models is crucial to enhancing user experience in real-world applications, existing research efforts do not address this issue. To fill this gap, we propose CodeFort, a framework to improve the robustness of code generation models, generalizing a large variety of code perturbations to enrich the training data and enabling various robust training strategies, mixing data augmentation, batch augmentation, adversarial logits pairing, and contrastive learning, all carefully designed to support high-throughput training. Extensive evaluations show that we increase the average robust pass rates of baseline CodeGen models from 14.79 to 21.74. We notably decrease the robustness drop rate from 95.02% to 54.95% against code-syntax perturbations. | Yuhao Zhang, Shiqi Wang, Haifeng Qian, Zijian Wang, Mingyue Shang, Linbo Liu, Sanjay Krishna Gouda, Baishakhi Ray, Murali Krishna Ramanathan, Xiaofei Ma, Anoop Deoras |  |

However, current RNA FMs often overlook the incorporation of secondary structures in the pretraining of FMs, which impedes the effectiveness in various genomic tasks. To address this problem, we leverage filtered high-fidelity structure annotations for structure pretraining to enhance the modeling ability of FMs in single nucleotide resolution tasks. Experimental evaluations across four comprehensive genomic benchmarks demonstrate that our RNA FM consistently outperforms existing RNA FMs, achieving a 40% improvement in RNA secondary structure prediction and obtaining top-tier results on DNA genomic benchmarks even though it has not been pretrained on any DNA genome. We release the code and models to encourage further research to bridge the gap between in-silico predictions and biological reality. | Heng Yang, Ke Li |  |

Linking Deliberation Chains in Collaborative Dialogues](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.findings-emnlp.305) |  | 0 | Question-asking in collaborative dialogue has long been established as key to knowledge construction, both in internal and collaborative problem solving. In this work, we examine probing questions in collaborative dialogues: questions that explicitly elicit responses from the speaker’s interlocutors. Specifically, we focus on modeling the causal relations that lead directly from utterances earlier in the dialogue to the emergence of the probing question. We model these relations using a novel graph-based framework of \*deliberation chains\*, and realize the problem of constructing such chains as a coreference-style clustering problem. Our framework jointly models probing and causal utterances and the links between them, and we evaluate on two challenging collaborative task datasets: the Weights Task and DeliData. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretically-grounded approach compared to both baselines and stronger coreference approaches, and establish a standard of... | Abhijnan Nath, Videep Venkatesha, Mariah Bradford, Avyakta Chelle, Austin Youngren, Carlos Mabrey, Nathaniel Blanchard, Nikhil Krishnaswamy |  |

More specifically, we focus on question answer generation (QAG), which produces question-answer pairs given an input context. We adapt and apply QAG approaches to generate question-answer pairs for different domains and assess their capacity to generate accurate, diverse, and abundant question-answer pairs. Our analyses combine both qualitative and quantitative evaluations that allow insights into the quality and types of errors made by QAG methods. We also look into strategies for error filtering and their effects. Our work concentrates on Portuguese, a widely spoken language that is underrepresented in natural language processing research.

However, several recent studies indicate that LLMs struggle with challenging instructions. In this paper, we propose Evolutionary Contrastive Distillation (ECD), a novel method for generating high-quality synthetic preference data designed to enhance the complex instruction-following capability of language models. ECD generates data that specifically illustrates the difference between a response that successfully follows a set of complex instructions and a response that is high-quality, but nevertheless makes some subtle mistakes. This is done by prompting LLMs to progressively evolve simple instructions to more complex instructions. When the complexity of an instruction is increased, the original successful response to the original instruction becomes a “hard negative” response for the new instruction, mostly meeting requirements of the new instruction, but... | Julian KatzSamuels, Zheng Li, Hyokun Yun, Priyanka Nigam, Yi Xu, Vaclav Petricek, Bing Yin, Trishul Chilimbi |  |

Traditional game theoretic approaches that have worked well for two-player zero-sum games struggle in the context of negotiation due to their inability to learn human-compatible strategies. On the other hand, approaches that only use human data tend to be domain-specific and lack the theoretical guarantees provided by strategies grounded in game theory. Motivated by the notion of fairness as a criterion for optimality in general sum games, we propose a negotiation framework called FDHC which incorporates fairness into both the reward design and search to learn human-compatible negotiation strategies. Our method includes a novel, RL+search technique called LGM-Zero which leverages a pre-trained language model to retrieve human-compatible offers from large action spaces. Our results show that our method is able to achieve more egalitarian negotiation outcomes and improve negotiation quality. | Ryan Shea, Zhou Yu |  |

In particular, identifying user communities, can be helpful for many downstream tasks. However, particularly when models are trained on past data and tested on future, doing this is difficult.In this paper, we hypothesize to take advantage of Large Language Models (LLMs), to better identify user communities. Due to the fact that many LLMs, such as ChatGPT, are fixed and must be treated as black-boxes, we propose an approach to better prompt them, by training a smaller LLM to do this. We devise strategies to train this smaller model, showing how it can improve the larger LLMs ability to detect communities. Experimental results show improvements on Reddit and Twitter data, and the tasks of community detection, bot detection, and news media profiling. | Nikhil Mehta, Dan Goldwasser |  |

Systematic Evaluation of the Multifaceted Capabilities of LLMs in Negotiation Dialogues](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.findings-emnlp.310) |  | 0 | A successful negotiation requires a range of capabilities, including comprehension of the conversation context, Theory-of-Mind (ToM) skills to infer the partner’s motives, strategic reasoning, and effective communication, making it challenging for automated systems. Despite the remarkable performance of LLMs in various NLP tasks, there is no systematic evaluation of their capabilities in negotiation. Such an evaluation is critical for advancing AI negotiation agents and negotiation research, ranging from designing dialogue systems to providing pedagogical feedback and scaling up data collection practices. This work aims to systematically analyze the multifaceted capabilities of LLMs across diverse dialogue scenarios throughout the stages of a typical negotiation interaction.

Despite these advancements, integrating tabular data, especially numerical data pivotal in clinical contexts, into LLM paradigms has not been thoroughly explored. In this study, we examine the effectiveness of vector representations from last hidden states of LLMs for medical diagnostics and prognostics using electronic health record (EHR) data. We compare the performance of these embeddings with that of raw numerical EHR data when used as feature inputs to traditional machine learning (ML) algorithms that excel at tabular data learning, such as eXtreme Gradient Boosting. We focus on instruction-tuned LLMs in a zero-shot setting to represent abnormal physiological data and evaluating their utilities as feature extractors to enhance ML classifiers for predicting diagnoses, length of stay, and mortality.... | Yanjun Gao, Skatje Myers, Shan Chen, Dmitriy Dligach, Timothy A.

LoCoVQA augments test examples for mathematical reasoning, VQA, and character recognition tasks with increasingly long visual contexts composed of both in-distribution and out-of-distribution distractor images.Across these tasks, a diverse set of VLMs rapidly lose performance as the visual context length grows, often exhibiting a striking logarithmic decay trend. This test assesses how well VLMs can ignore irrelevant information when answering queries—a task that is quite easy for language models (LMs) in the text domain—demonstrating that current state-of-the-art VLMs lack this essential capability for many long-context applications. | Aditya Sharma, Michael Saxon, William Yang Wang |  |

However, existing methods do not match the accuracy of classifier-based methods. Plus, the generated rationales often contain hallucinated information. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework capable of generating more faithful rationales and, more importantly, matching performance with classifier-based black-box scoring systems. We first mimic the human assessment process by querying Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate a thought tree. We then summarise intermediate assessment decisions from each thought tree path for creating synthetic rationale data and rationale preference data. Finally, we utilise the generated synthetic data to calibrate LLMs through a two-step training process: supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization.

While end-to-end OCR methods offer improved accuracy over layout-based approaches, they often grapple with significant repetition issues, especially with complex layouts in Out-Of-Domain (OOD) documents.To tackle this issue, we propose LOCR, a model that integrates location guiding into the transformer architecture during autoregression. We train the model on an original large-scale dataset comprising over 53M text-location pairs from 89K academic document pages, including bounding boxes for words, tables and mathematical symbols. LOCR adeptly handles various formatting elements and generates content in Markdown language.

Existing song translation approaches often prioritize these singability constraints at the expense of translation quality, which is crucial for musicals. This paper aims to enhance translation quality while maintaining key singability features. Our method consists of three main components. First, we create a dataset to train reward models for the automatic evaluation of translation quality. Second, to enhance both singability and translation quality, we implement a two-stage training process with filtering techniques. Finally, we introduce an inference-time optimization framework for translating entire songs. Extensive experiments, including both automatic and human evaluations, demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods and validate the effectiveness of each component in our approach. | Zhuorui Ye, Jinhan Li, Rongwu Xu |  |

Typically, creating verbal cues requires extensive human effort and is quite time-consuming, necessitating an automated method that is more scalable. We propose a novel overgenerate-and-rank method via prompting large language models (LLMs) to generate verbal cues and then ranking them according to psycholinguistic measures and takeaways from a pilot user study. To assess cue quality, we conduct both an automated evaluation of imageability and coherence, as well as a human evaluation involving English teachers and learners. Results show that LLM-generated mnemonics are comparable to human-generated ones in terms of imageability, coherence, and perceived usefulness, but there remains plenty of room for improvement due to the diversity in background and preference among language... | Jaewook Lee, Hunter McNichols, Andrew S.

As a result, NMT models are likely to prefer high-frequency words than low-frequency ones despite low-frequency word may carry the crucial semantic information, which may hamper the translation quality once they are neglected. The objective of this study is to enhance the translation of meaningful but low-frequency words. Our general idea is to optimize the translation of low-frequency words through knowledge distillation. Specifically, we employ a low-frequency teacher model that excels in translating low-frequency words to guide the learning of the student model. To remain the translation quality of high-frequency words, we further introduce a dual-teacher distillation framework, leveraging both the low-frequency and high-frequency teacher models to guide the student model’s training. Our single-teacher distillation method already achieves a +0.64 BLEU improvements... | Yifan Guo, Hongying Zan, Hongfei Xu |  |

A promising baseline SimCSE has made notable breakthroughs in unsupervised SRL (sentence representation learning) following the success of contrastive learning. However, considering the difference between VRL and SRL, there is still room for designing a novel contrastive framework specially targeted for SRL. We pro- pose a novel angle-based similarity function for contrastive objective. By examining the gra- dient of our contrastive objective, we show that an angle-based similarity function incites better training dynamics on SRL than the off-the-shelf cosine similarity: (1) effectively pulling a posi- tive instance toward an anchor instance in the early stage of training and (2) not excessively repelling a false negative instance during the middle of training.

This underscores the need for careful evaluation of LLMs within each legal system before application.Here, we introduce KBL, a benchmark for assessing the Korean legal language understanding of LLMs, consisting of (1) 7 legal knowledge tasks (510 examples), (2) 4 legal reasoning tasks (288 examples), and (3) the Korean bar exam (4 domains, 53 tasks, 2,510 examples). First two datasets were developed in close collaboration with lawyers to evaluate LLMs in practical scenarios in a certified manner. Furthermore, considering legal practitioners’ frequent use of extensive legal documents for research, we assess LLMs in both a closed book setting, where they rely solely on internal knowledge, and a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)... | Kimyeeun Kimyeeun, Choi Youngrok, Eunkyung Choi, Jinhwan Choi, Hai Jin Park, Wonseok Hwang |  |

However, there is presently a challenge: how to handle alignment between distant language pairs (DLPs) in UMMT. To this end, this paper proposes a visual pivoting UMMT method for DLPs. Specifically, we first construct a dataset containing two DLPs, including English-Uyghur and Chinese-Uyghur. We then apply the visual pivoting method for both to pre-training and fine-tuning, and we observe that the images on the encoder and decoder of UMMT have noticeable effects on DLPs. Finally, we introduce informative multi-granularity image features to facilitate further alignment of the latent space between the two languages. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms several baselines on DLPs and close language pairs (CLPs). | Turghun Tayir, Lin Li, Xiaohui Tao, Mieradilijiang Maimaiti, Ming Li, Jianquan Liu |  |

This problem has broad applications in NLP, such as targeted instruction tuning and data selection in chain-of-thought fine-tuning. The key challenge of this problem is that not all auxiliary tasks are useful to improve the performance of the target task. Thus, choosing the right subset of auxiliary tasks is crucial. Conventional subset selection methods, such as forward & backward selection, are unsuitable for LM fine-tuning because they require repeated training on subsets of auxiliary tasks. This paper introduces a new algorithm to estimate model fine-tuning performances without repeated training. Our algorithm first performs multitask training using the data of all the tasks to obtain a meta initialization. Then, we approximate the model fine-tuning loss of a subset using functional values and gradients from the meta initialization. Empirically, we... | Dongyue Li, Ziniu Zhang, Lu Wang, Hongyang Zhang |  |

However, LLMs exhibit only infant-level cognitive abilities in certain areas. One such area is the A-Not-B error, a phenomenon seen in infants where they repeat a previously rewarded behavior despite well-observed changed conditions. This highlights their lack of inhibitory control – the ability to stop a habitual or impulsive response. In our work, we design a text-based multi-choice QA scenario similar to the A-Not-B experimental settings to systematically test the inhibitory control abilities of LLMs. We found that state-of-the-art LLMs (like Llama3-8b) perform consistently well with in-context learning (ICL) but make errors and show a significant drop of as many as 83.3% in reasoning tasks when the context changes trivially. This suggests that LLMs only have inhibitory control abilities on par with human infants in... | Pengrui Han, Peiyang Song, Haofei Yu, Jiaxuan You |  |

Drawing inspiration from this process, our work presents a novel angle for evaluating language models’ (LMs) mathematical abilities, by investigating whether they can discern skills and concepts enabled by math content. We contribute two datasets: one consisting of 385 fine-grained descriptions of K-12 math skills and concepts, or \*standards\*, from Achieve the Core (\*ATC\*), and another of 9.9K math problems labeled with these standards (\*MathFish\*). We develop two tasks for evaluating LMs’ abilities to assess math problems: (1) verifying whether a problem aligns with a given standard, and (2) tagging a problem with all aligned standards. Working with experienced teachers, we find that LMs struggle to tag and verify standards linked to problems, and instead... | Li Lucy, Tal August, Rose E.

However, in real-world scenarios, noisy labels often exhibit dependencies with true labels. In this study, we validate through hypothesis testing that real-world datasets are unlikely to adhere to the CCN assumption, indicating that label noise is dependent on the labels. To address this, we introduce a label-specific denoising framework designed to counteract label-dependent noise. The framework initially presents a holistic selection metric that evaluates noisy labels by concurrently considering loss information, ranking information, and feature centroid. Subsequently, it identifies and corrects noisy labels individually for each label category in a fine-grained manner. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method under... | Pengyu Xu, Liping Jing, Jian Yu |  |

Different from historical linguistics’ comparative approaches, we reformulate this problem into a temporal prediction task with masked language models, digitizing existing phonology rules into ACP (Ancient Chinese Phonology) dataset of 70,943 entries for 17,001 Chinese characters. Utilizing this dataset and Chinese character glyph information, our transformer-based model demonstrates superior performance on a series of reconstruction tasks, with or without prior phonological knowledge on the target historical period. Our work significantly advances the digitization and computational reconstruction of ancient Chinese phonology, providing a more complete and temporally contextualized resource for computational linguistics and historical research. The dataset and model training code are publicly available. | Zhige Huang, Haoan Jin, Mengyue Wu, Kenny Q. Zhu |  |

To overcome the challenge of cross-task generalization, task-level LoRAs combination is proposed, which does not require training a model for new tasks. Instead, it learns the LoRA modules combination weights based on a small number of samples to form the task model. However, task-level LoRAs combination only utilizes a few task modules due to its reliance on the weight enumeration method, and it also ignores the specificity between different instances. Therefore, we proposed an instance-level LoRAs composition for cross-task generalization, which selects appropriate multiple task LoRA modules for each input instance and dynamically determines the composition weights. Our experiments on publicly available datasets show that our method outperforms the typical method, LoraHub, in 16 out of 27 tasks.

Despite existing efforts to refine data quality through heuristic rules and evaluations based on data diversity and difficulty, there’s a lack of systematic approaches specifically tailored for assessing long texts. Addressing this gap, our work systematically measures the quality of long texts by evaluating three fundamental linguistic dimensions: coherence, cohesion, and complexity. Drawing inspiration from the aforementioned three dimensions, we introduce a suite of metrics designed to evaluate the quality of long texts, encompassing both statistical and pre-trained language model-based ones. Leveraging these metrics, we present LongWanjuan, a bilingual dataset specifically tailored to enhance the training of language models for long-text tasks with over 160B tokens. In LongWanjuan, we categorize long texts into holistic, aggregated, and chaotic types, enabling a detailed analysis... | Xiaoran Liu, Kai Lv, Qipeng Guo, Hang Yan, Conghui He, Xipeng Qiu, Dahua Lin |  |

While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive general understanding and generation abilities, their potential in multi-domain MT is under-explored. We establish a comprehensive benchmark for multi-domain translation, featuring 25 German⇔English and 22 Chinese⇔English test sets respectively covering 15 domains. Our evaluation of prominent LLMs reveals a discernible performance gap against traditional MT systems, highlighting domain overfitting and catastrophic forgetting issues after fine-tuning on domain-limited corpora. To mitigate this, we propose a domain Chain of Thought (CoT) fine-tuning technique that utilizes the intrinsic multi-domain intelligence of LLMs to improve translation performance. This method inspires the LLM to perceive domain information... | Tianxiang Hu, Pei Zhang, Baosong Yang, Jun Xie, Derek F. Wong, Rui Wang |  |

Traditionally managed by human professionals, clinical triage is susceptible to substantial variability and high workloads. Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate promising reasoning and understanding capabilities, directly applying them to clinical triage remains challenging due to the complex and dynamic nature of the clinical triage task. To address these issues, we introduce TriageAgent, a novel heterogeneous multi-agent framework designed to enhance collaborative decision-making in clinical triage. TriageAgent leverages LLMs for role-playing, incorporating self-confidence and early-stopping mechanisms in multi-round discussions to improve document reasoning and classification precision for triage tasks. In addition, TriageAgent employs the medical Emergency Severity Index (ESI) handbook through a... | Meng Lu, Brandon Ho, Dennis Ren, Xuan Wang |  |

It leads to increased training time and model bias in its processing. To address this issue, we propose a novel Generative Deduplication framework for social media data selection by removing semantically duplicate data. While related work involves data selection in the task-specific training, our model functions as an efficient pre-processing method to universally enhance social media NLP pipelines. Specifically, we train a generative model via self-supervised learning to predict keyword to capture the semantics of noisy social media text for deduplication. Meanwhile, time-dimensional Gaussian noise is added to improve training complexity and avoid learning trivial features. Extensive experiments suggest that our model can better reduce training samples while improving performance than baselines. The results show our model’s potential to broadly advance social media language understanding in effectiveness and... | Xianming Li, Jing Li |  |

Prior studies have demonstrated model generations favor one gender or exhibit stereotypes about gender, but have not investigated the complex dynamics that can influence model reasoning and decision-making involving gender. We study gender equity within LLMs through a decision-making lens with a new dataset, DeMET Prompts, containing scenarios related to intimate, romantic relationships. We explore nine relationship configurations through name pairs across three name lists (men, women, neutral). We investigate equity in the context of gender roles through numerous lenses: typical and gender-neutral names, with and without model safety enhancements, same and mixed-gender relationships, and egalitarian versus traditional scenarios across various topics. While all models exhibit the same biases (women favored, then those with gender-neutral... | Sharon Levy, William D. Adler, Tahilin Sanchez Karver, Mark Dredze, Michelle R. Kaufman |  |

However, users may ask underspecified questions that require additional context for a model to correctly answer. We study how large language model biases are exhibited through these contextual questions in the healthcare domain. To accomplish this, we curate a dataset of sexual and reproductive healthcare questions (ContextSRH) that are dependent on age, sex, and location attributes. We compare models’ outputs with and without demographic context to determine answer alignment among our contextual questions. Our experiments reveal biases in each of these attributes, where young adult female users are favored. | Sharon Levy, Tahilin Sanchez Karver, William D. Adler, Michelle R. Kaufman, Mark Dredze |  |

Existing works primarily rely on external evaluators, focusing on training and prompting strategies. However, a crucial aspect – model-aware glass-box features – is overlooked. In this study, we explore the utility of glass-box features under the scenario of self-evaluation, namely applying an LLM to evaluate its own output. We investigate various glass-box feature groups and discovered that the softmax distribution serves as a reliable quality indicator for self-evaluation. Experimental results on public benchmarks validate the feasibility of self-evaluation of LLMs using glass-box features. | Hui Huang, Yingqi Qu, Jing Liu, Muyun Yang, Bing Xu, Tiejun Zhao, Wenpeng Lu |  |

Existing approaches to fact tracing rely on assessing the similarity between each training sample and the query along a certain dimension, such as lexical similarity, gradient, or embedding space. However, these methods fall short of effectively distinguishing between samples that are merely relevant and those that actually provide supportive evidence for the information sought by the query. This limitation often results in suboptimal effectiveness. Moreover, these approaches necessitate the examination of the similarity of individual training points for each query, imposing significant computational demands and creating a substantial barrier for practical applications. This paper introduces FASTTRACK, a novel approach that harnesses the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to validate supportive evidence for queries and at the same time clusters the training... | Si Chen, Feiyang Kang, Ning Yu, Ruoxi Jia |  |

Current defense methods can generally be categorized into inference-time and training-time ones. The former often requires a part of clean samples to set detection thresholds, which may be hard to obtain in practical application scenarios, while the latter usually requires an additional retraining or unlearning process to get a clean model, significantly increasing training costs. To avoid these drawbacks, we focus on developing a practical defense method before model training without using any clean samples. Our analysis reveals that with the help of a pre-trained language model (PLM), poisoned samples, different from clean ones, exhibit mismatched relationship and shared characteristics. Based on these observations, we further propose a two-stage poison detection strategy solely... | Yu Chen, Qi Cao, Kaike Zhang, Xuchao Liu, Huawei Shen |  |

Current metaphor detection tasks only provide labels (i.e., metaphor or literal) without interpreting how to understand them. In this paper, we improve the metaphor detection task and explore the reason of metaphor. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first work to reason about metaphor using mainstream Large Language Models (LLMs). Specifically, we utilized ChatGPT3.5 to expand the mainstream datasets in current metaphor detection, including VUA ALL, TroFi, and MOH-X. We input the original sentence, target word, and usage (metaphor or literal) into ChatGPT, guiding it to generate corresponding metaphor reason. Then, we designed supervised baseline experiments (e.g., RoBERTa, GPT-2) and zero-shot experiments with LLMs (e.g., LLaMA3). For the results generated by the above experiments, we provided the case study. We devised four methods that include manual evaluation to evaluate the reason... | Puli Chen, Cheng Yang, Qingbao Huang |  |

Automating the creation of interlinear glossed text would be desirable to reduce annotator effort and maintain consistency across annotated corpora. Prior research has explored a number of statistical and neural methods for automatically producing IGT. As large language models (LLMs) have showed promising results across multilingual tasks, even for rare, endangered languages, it is natural to wonder whether they can be utilized for the task of generating IGT. We explore whether LLMs can be effective at the task of interlinear glossing with in-context learning, without any traditional training. We propose new approaches for selecting examples to provide in-context, observing that targeted selection can significantly improve performance. We find that LLM-based methods beat standard transformer baselines, despite requiring no training at... | Michael Ginn, Mans Hulden, Alexis Palmer |  |

However, understanding how position embedding can capture longer-range contextual information remains elusive. Based on the intuition that different dimensions correspond to different frequency of changes in RoPE encoding, we conducted a dimension-level analysis to investigate the correlation between a hidden dimension of an attention head and its contribution to capturing long-distance dependencies. Using our correlation metric, we identified a particular type of attention heads, which we named Positional Heads, from various length-extrapolated models. These heads exhibit a strong focus on long-range information interaction and play a pivotal role in long input processing, as evidence by our ablation. We further demonstrate the correlation between the efficiency of length extrapolation and the extension of the high-dimensional... | Xiangyu Hong, Che Jiang, Biqing Qi, Fandong Meng, Mo Yu, Bowen Zhou, Jie Zhou |  |

However, these aggregations are mainly conducted on the parameter space, and the parameter distances cannot reflect the data distribution divergences between clients. Therefore, existing Byzantine-resistant aggregations cannot defend against backdoor injection by malicious attackers in federated natural language tasks. In this paper, we propose the client embedding for malicious client detection to enhance Byzantine-resistant aggregations. The distances between client embeddings are required to reflect the data distribution divergences of the corresponding clients. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed client embeddings. | Zhiyuan Zhang, Hao Zhou, Fandong Meng, Jie Zhou, Xu Sun |  |

While pre-trained language models (PLMs) have set the state-of-the-art (SOTA) for ATSA, they are resource-intensive due to their large model sizes, restricting their wide applications to resource-constrained scenarios. Conversely, conventional machine learning methods, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), offer the benefit of less resource requirement but have lower predictive accuracy. This paper introduces an innovative pipeline, termed SVM-ATSA, which bridges the gap between the accuracy of SVM-based methods and the efficiency of PLM-based methods. To improve the feature expression of SVMs and better adapt to the ATSA task, SVM-ATSA decomposes the learning problem into multiple view subproblems, and dynamically selects as well as constructs features with reinforcement learning. The experimental results demonstrate that SVM-ATSA surpasses SOTA PLM-based methods in... | Hanfeng Liu, Minping Chen, Zhenya Zheng, Zeyi Wen |  |

Instead of building neural models to predict relations, we design them to output straightforward rules that can be used to extract relations. The rules are generated using custom T5-style Encoder-Decoder Language Models. Crucially, our rules are fully interpretable and pliable (i.e., humans can easily modify them to boost performance). Through a combination of rules generated by these models along with a very effective, novel baseline, we demonstrate a few-shot relation-classification performance that is comparable to or stronger than the state of the art on the Few-Shot TACRED and NYT29 benchmarks while increasing interpretability and maintaining pliability. | Mayank Singh, Eduardo Blanco |  |

Although sophisticated models perform well on individual datasets, they often fail to generalize due to varying definitions and labeling of “offensive content.” In this paper, we introduce HateCOT, an English dataset with over 52,000 samples from diverse sources, featuring explanations generated by GPT-3.5Turbo and curated by humans. We demonstrate that pretraining on HateCOT significantly enhances the performance of open-source Large Language Models on three benchmark datasets for offensive content detection in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, despite differences in domain and task. Additionally, HateCOT facilitates effective K-shot fine-tuning of LLMs with limited data and improves the quality of their explanations, as confirmed by our human evaluation. | Huy Nghiem, Hal Daumé III |  |

Existing automated detection models often exhibit a bias towards predicting offensive speech based on specific vocabulary, which not only compromises model fairness but also potentially exacerbates biases against vulnerable and minority groups. Addressing these issues, this paper proposes a bias self-awareness and data self-iteration framework for mitigating model biases. This framework aims to “giving control back to models: enabling offensive language detection models to autonomously identify and mitigate biases” through bias self-awareness algorithms and self-iterative data augmentation method. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively reduces the false positive rate of models in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tests, enhances model accuracy and fairness, and shows... | Jiapeng Liu, Weijie Li, Xiaochao Fan, Wenjun Deng, Liang Yang, Yong Li, Yufeng Diao |  |

We introduce Toolken+ that mitigates the first problem by reranking top-k tools selected by ToolkenGPT and the second problem with a special REJECT option such that the model will generate a vocabulary token if REJECT is ranked first.

However, research on sensitive data leakage in NLIDBs is relatively limited. Therefore, we propose a benchmark to assess the potential of language models to leak sensitive data when generating SQL queries. This benchmark covers 932 samples from 34 different domains, including medical, legal, financial, and political aspects. We evaluate 15 models from six LLM families, and the results show that the model with the best performance has an accuracy of 61.7%, whereas humans achieve an accuracy of 94%. Most models perform close to or even below the level of random selection. We also evaluate two common attack methods, namely prompt injection and inference attacks, as well as a defense method based on chain-of-thoughts (COT) prompting.

While most current approaches, including parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and block expansion methods, uniformly apply knowledge across all LLM layers, it raises the question: are all layers equally crucial for knowledge injection? We embark upon evaluating the importance of each layer to locate the optimal layer range for knowledge injection. Intuitively, more important layers should play more critical roles in knowledge injection and deserve denser injection. We observe performance dips in question-answering benchmarks after the removal or expansion of the shallow layers, and the degradation shrinks as the layer gets deeper, indicating that the shallow layers hold the key to knowledge injection. This insight leads us to propose the S strategy, a post-pretraining strategy of selectively enhancing shallow layers while... | Tianxiang Chen, Zhentao Tan, Tao Gong, Yue Wu, Qi Chu, Bin Liu, Jieping Ye, Nenghai Yu |  |

An Analysis of Encoding Strategies for Relation Extraction](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.findings-emnlp.348) |  | 0 | Existing approaches to relation extraction obtain relation embeddings by concatenating embeddings of the head and tail entities. Despite the popularity of this approach, we find that such representations mostly capture the types of the entities involved, leading to false positives and confusion between relations that involve entities of the same type. Another possibility is to use a prompt with a [MASK] token to directly learn relation embeddings, but this approach tends to perform poorly. We show that this underperformance comes from the fact that information about entity types is insufficiently captured by the [MASK] embeddings. We therefore propose a simple model, which combines such [MASK] embeddings with entity embeddings.

While several studies have explored autonomous approaches to distilling and annotating instructions from powerful proprietary LLMs, such as ChatGPT, they often neglect the impact of the distributions and characteristics of tasks, together with the varying difficulty of instructions in training sets. This oversight can lead to imbalanced knowledge capabilities and poor generalization powers of student LLMs. To address these challenges, we introduce Task-Aware Curriculum Planning for Instruction Refinement (TAPIR), a multi-round distillation framework that utilizes an oracle LLM to select instructions that are difficult for a student LLM to follow. To balance the student’s capabilities, task distributions in training sets are adjusted with responses automatically refined according to their corresponding tasks. In addition, by incorporating curriculum planning, our... | Yuanhao Yue, Chengyu Wang, Jun Huang, Peng Wang |  |

Despite advancements in English-Thai MT technology, common MT approaches often underperform in the medical field due to their inability to precisely translate medical terminologies. Our research prioritizes not merely improving translation accuracy but also maintaining medical terminology in English within the translated text through code-switched (CS) translation. We developed a method to produce CS medical translation data, fine-tuned a CS translation model with this data, and evaluated its performance against strong baselines, such as Google Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and GPT-3.5/GPT-4. Our model demonstrated competitive performance in automatic metrics and was highly favored in human preference evaluations. Our evaluation result also shows that medical professionals significantly prefer CS translations that maintain critical English terms... | Parinthapat Pengpun, Krittamate Tiankanon, Amrest Chinkamol, Jiramet Kinchagawat, Pitchaya Chairuengjitjaras, Pasit Supholkhan, Pubordee Aussavavirojekul, Chiraphat Boonnag, Kanyakorn Veerakanjana, Hirunkul Phimsiri, Boonthicha Saejia, Nattawach Sataudom, Piyalitt Ittichaiwong, Peerat Limkonchotiwat |  |

Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) highlight their potential for cognitive simulation. However, these LLM-based cognitive studies primarily focus on replicating human cognition in specific contexts, overlooking the inherently dynamic nature of cognition. To bridge this gap, we explore the cognitive dynamics of LLMs and present a corresponding task inspired by longitudinal studies. Toward the task, we develop CogBench, a novel benchmark to assess the cognitive dynamics of LLMs and validate it through participant surveys. We also design two evaluation metrics for CogBench, including Authenticity and Rationality. Recognizing the inherent static nature of LLMs, we further introduce CogGPT for the task, which features an innovative iterative cognitive mechanism to develop lifelong cognitive dynamics.

A Structured Investigation Framework and Toxicity Metric](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.findings-emnlp.353) |  | 0 | In the pursuit of developing Large Language Models (LLMs) that adhere to societal standards, it is imperative to detect the toxicity in the generated text. The majority of existing toxicity metrics rely on encoder models trained on specific toxicity datasets, which are susceptible to out-of-distribution (OOD) problems and depend on the dataset’s definition of toxicity. In this paper, we introduce a robust metric grounded on LLMs to flexibly measure toxicity according to the given definition. We first analyze the toxicity factors, followed by an examination of the intrinsic toxic attributes of LLMs to ascertain their suitability as evaluators. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our metric with detailed analysis. Our empirical results demonstrate outstanding performance in measuring toxicity within verified factors, improving on conventional metrics by 12 points in the F1 score. Our findings also indicate that upstream toxicity significantly influences downstream metrics,... | Hyukhun Koh, Dohyung Kim, Minwoo Lee, Kyomin Jung |  |

It is therefore crucial to track their discourse on social media to understand their ideological positions and goals. However, Twitter data is also challenging to work with since it is ambiguous and often dependent on social context, and consequently, recent work on political positioning has tended to focus strongly on manifestos (parties’ electoral programs) rather than social media.In this paper, we extend recently proposed methods to predict pairwise positional similarities between parties from the manifesto case to the Twitter case, using hashtags as a signal to fine-tune text representations, without the need for manual annotation. We verify the efficacy of fine-tuning and conduct a series of experiments that assess the robustness of our method for low-resource scenarios. We find that our method yields stable positionings reflective of manifesto positionings, both in... | Maximilian Maurer, Tanise Ceron, Sebastian Padó, Gabriella Lapesa |  |

Previous methods primarily focus on visual aspects of table structure recovery but often fail to effectively comprehend the textual semantics within tables, particularly for descriptive textual cells. In this paper, we introduce UniTabNet, a novel framework for table structure parsing based on the image-to-text model. UniTabNet employs a “divide-and-conquer” strategy, utilizing an image-to-text model to decouple table cells and integrating both physical and logical decoders to reconstruct the complete table structure. We further enhance our framework with the Vision Guider, which directs the model’s focus towards pertinent areas, thereby boosting prediction accuracy. Additionally, we introduce the Language Guider to refine the model’s capability to understand textual semantics in table images.

Traditional methods for measuring accuracy, such as Word Error Rate (WER), are too strict to address this challenge. In this paper, we introduce PolyWER, a proposed framework for evaluating speech recognition systems to handle language-mixing. PolyWER accepts transcriptions of code-mixed segments in different forms, including transliterations and translations. We demonstrate the algorithms use cases through detailed examples, and evaluate it against human judgement. To enable the use of this metric, we appended the annotations of a publicly available Arabic-English code-switched dataset with transliterations and translations of code-mixed speech. We also utilize these additional annotations for fine-tuning ASR models and compare their... | Karima Kadaoui, Maryam Al Ali, Hawau Olamide Toyin, Ibrahim Mohammed, Hanan Aldarmaki |  |

Built on an extended version of the data from the WMT22 Metrics Shared Task (with extra labels of 9 types of Chinese MWEs, and 19 types of Chinese multiword NEs) which includes scores and error annotations provided by human experts, we make further extraction of MWE- and NE-related translation errors. By investigating the human evaluation scores and the error rates on each category of MWEs and NEs, we find that: 1) MT systems tend to perform significantly worse on Chinese sentences with most kinds of MWEs and NEs; 2) MWEs and NEs which make up of about twenty percent of tokens, i.e. characters in Chinese, result in one-third of translation errors; 3) for 13 categories of MWEs and NEs, the error rates exceed 50% with the highest to be 84.8%. Based on the results, we emphasize that MWEs and... | Huacheng Song, Hongzhi Xu |  |

In this paper, we propose Selective Compression Attention (SCA), a general and effective method to expand the context window and reduce memory footprint by compressing the KV cache of LLMs. Specifically, through preliminary experiments, we found that the KV cache contains many similar vectors, resulting in information redundancy, which can be compressed by retaining representative vectors and discarding others. Therefore, SCA continuously selects the most distinctive vectors to keep through a greedy algorithm, reducing information loss during compression. Extensive experiments on various tasks verify the effectiveness of our method. Compared with existing methods, SCA can significantly reduce the impact on model performance under the same compression ratio.... | Huanran Zheng, Wei Zhu, Xiaoling Wang |  |

However, existing supervised and in-context learning approaches suffer from high training costs, poor data efficiency, and generated API calls that can be unfaithful to the API documentation and the user’s request. To address these limitations, we propose an output-side optimization approach called FANTASE. Two of the unique contributions of FANTASE are its State-Tracked Constrained Decoding (SCD) and Reranking components. SCD dynamically incorporates appropriate API constraints in the form of Token Search Trie for efficient and guaranteed generation faithfulness with respect to the API documentation. The Reranking component efficiently brings in the supervised signal by leveraging a lightweight model as the discriminator to rerank the beam-searched candidate generations of the large language model. We demonstrate the superior performance of FANTASE in API call... | Zhuoer Wang, Leonardo F. R.

We investigate LLMs’ abilities in constructive geometric problem-solving, – one of the most fundamental steps in developing human mathematical reasoning, revealing notable challenges in this domain. LLMs exhibit biases in variable names, struggle with 2D spatial relationships and planning, and hallucinate object placements. To this end, we introduce a framework that enhances LLMs’ reasoning potential through a multi-agent system conducting internal dialogue. This work underscores LLMs’ limitations in geometric reasoning and improves their capabilities through self-correction, collaboration, and diverse role specializations. | Spyridon Mouselinos, Henryk Michalewski, Mateusz Tomasz Malinowski |  |

Nevertheless, existing MoE methods usually enforce a constant top-k routing for all tokens, which is arguably restrictive because various tokens (e.g., "<EOS>” vs. “apple”) may require various numbers of experts for feature abstraction. Lifting such a constraint can help make the most of limited resources and unleash the potential of the model for downstream tasks. In this sense, we introduce \*\*AdaMoE\*\* to realize token-adaptive routing for MoE, where different tokens are permitted to select a various number of experts. AdaMoE makes minimal modifications to the vanilla MoE with top-k routing—it simply introduces a fixed number of \*null experts\*, which do not consume any FLOPs, to the expert set and increases the value of k. AdaMoE does not force each token to occupy a fixed number of null... | Zihao Zeng, Yibo Miao, Hongcheng Gao, Hao Zhang, Zhijie Deng |  |

In this work, we propose SUIT (SUbgoal-aware ITerative Training), an iterative training approach for improving ToD systems. We sample dialogs from the model we aim to improve and determine subgoals that contribute to dialog success using distant supervision to obtain high quality training samples. We show how this data improves supervised fine-tuning or, alternatively, preference learning results. Performance improves when applying these steps over several iterations: SUIT reaches new state-of-the-art performance on a popular ToD benchmark. | Magdalena Kaiser, Patrick Ernst, György Szarvas |  |

To model and reason about causality, causal graphs offer a concise yet effective solution. Given the impressive advancements in language models, a crucial question arises: can they really understand causal graphs? To this end, we pioneer an investigation into language models’ understanding of causal graphs. Specifically, we develop a framework to define causal graph understanding, by assessing language models’ behaviors through four practical criteria derived from diverse disciplines (e.g., philosophy and psychology). We then develop CLEAR, a novel benchmark that defines three complexity levels and encompasses 20 causal graph-based tasks across these levels. Finally, based on our framework and benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on six leading language models and summarize five empirical findings. Our results indicate that while language models demonstrate a preliminary understanding of causal graphs,... | Sirui Chen, Mengying Xu, Kun Wang, Xingyu Zeng, Rui Zhao, Shengjie Zhao, Chaochao Lu |  |

While knowledge distillation (KD) is a prominent method for this, research on KD for generative language models like LLMs is relatively sparse, and the approach of distilling student-friendly knowledge, which has shown promising performance in KD for classification models, remains unexplored in generative language models. To explore this approach, we propose PromptKD, a simple yet effective method that utilizes prompt tuning - for the first time in KD - to enable generative language models to transfer student-friendly knowledge. Unlike previous works in classification that require fine-tuning the entire teacher model for extracting student-friendly knowledge, PromptKD achieves similar effects by adding a small number of prompt tokens and tuning only the prompt with student guidance.

Language varies along several axes, most importantly, language instance (e.g. French) and domain (e.g. news). While adapting NLP models to new languages within a single domain, or to new domains within a single language, is widely studied, research in joint adaptation is hampered by the lack of evaluation datasets. This prevents the transfer of NLP systems from well-resourced languages and domains to non-dominant language-domain combinations. To address this gap, we introduce M2QA, a multi-domain multilingual question answering benchmark.M2QA includes 13,500 SQuAD 2.0-style question-answer instances in German, Turkish, and Chinese for the domains of product reviews, news, and creative writing. We use M2QA to explore cross-lingual cross-domain performance of fine-tuned models and state-of-the-art LLMs and investigate modular approaches to domain and language adaptation.We witness... | Leon Engländer, Hannah Sterz, Clifton Poth, Jonas Pfeiffer, Ilia Kuznetsov, Iryna Gurevych |  |

The detection and generation of metaphors in textual form have been studied extensively but metaphors in other forms have been under-explored. Recent studies have shown that Vision-Language (VL) models cannot understand visual metaphors in memes and adverts. As of now, no probing studies have been done that involve complex language phenomena like metaphors with videos. Hence, we introduce a new VL task of describing the metaphors present in the videos in our work. To facilitate this novel task, we construct and release a manually created dataset with 705 videos and 2115 human-written captions, along with a new metric called Average Concept Distance (ACD), to automatically evaluate the creativity of the metaphors generated. We also propose a novel low-resource video metaphor captioning system: GIT-LLaVA, which obtains comparable performance to SoTA video language models on the proposed task.

In this paper, we perform a meta-evaluation of such methods and assess their reliability across a broad range of tasks. In evaluating how well automatic methods align with human evaluations, correlation metrics are the most commonly employed method despite their inherent limitations when dealing with ties and different scales. To address these shortcomings, we use Pairwise Accuracy as an alternative to standard correlation measures. We observe that while automatic evaluation methods can approximate human ratings under specific conditions, their validity is highly context-dependent. Specifically, the simple ROUGE-L metric correlates very well with human ratings for short-answer English tasks but is unreliable in free-form generation tasks and cross-lingual scenarios.

Machine-generated text (MGT) detection is important to cope with such threats. However, it is susceptible to authorship obfuscation (AO) methods, such as paraphrasing, which can cause MGTs to evade detection. So far, this was evaluated only in monolingual settings. Thus, the susceptibility of recently proposed multilingual detectors is still unknown. We fill this gap by comprehensively benchmarking the performance of 10 well-known AO methods, attacking 37 MGT detection methods against MGTs in 11 languages (i.e., 10 × 37 × 11 = 4,070 combinations). We also evaluate the effect of data augmentation on adversarial robustness using obfuscated texts. The results indicate that all tested AO methods can cause evasion of automated detection in all tested languages, where homoglyph attacks are especially successful.

Performance improves with t (larger training sets) and degrades with h (longer forecast horizons). The trade-off between edge-based methods and node-based methods depends on t. Because edges grow faster than nodes, larger training sets favor edge-based methods.We introduce a new forecast-based Citation Prediction benchmark of 3 million papers to quantify these trends.Our benchmark shows that desirable policies for combining edge- and node-based methods depend on h and t.We release our benchmark, evaluation scripts, and embeddings. | Peter Vickers, Kenneth Church |  |

Early Exit (EE) strategies handle the issue by allowing the samples to exit from classifiers attached to the intermediary layers, but they do not generalize well, as exit classifiers can be sensitive to domain changes. To address this, we propose Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in EE framework (DAdEE) that employs multi-level adaptation using knowledge distillation. DAdEE utilizes GAN-based adversarial adaptation at each layer to achieve domain-invariant representations, reducing the domain gap between the source and target domain across all layers. The attached exits not only speed up inference but also enhance domain adaptation by reducing catastrophic forgetting and mode collapse, making it more suitable for real-world scenarios.

The result is a discourse parser, Llamipa (Llama Incremental Parser), that leverages discourse context, leading to substantial performance gains over approaches that use encoder-only models to provide local, context-sensitive representations of discourse units. Furthermore, it is able to process discourse data incrementally, which is essential for the eventual use of discourse information in downstream tasks. | Kate Thompson, Akshay Chaturvedi, Julie Hunter, Nicholas Asher |  |

But in recent “language to code” or “language to action” models, this information is lacking. We show how incorporating the prior discourse and nonlinguistic context of a conversation situated in a nonlinguistic environment can improve the “language to action” component of such interactions. We finetune an LLM to predict actions based on prior context; our model, Nebula, doubles the net-action F1 score over the baseline on this task of Jayannavar et al. (2020). We also investigate our model’s ability to construct shapes and understand location descriptions using a synthetic dataset. | Akshay Chaturvedi, Kate Thompson, Nicholas Asher |  |

In the biomedical domain, continual pre-training is a prevalent method for domain adaptation to inject professional knowledge into powerful LLMs that have been pre-trained in general domains. Previous studies typically conduct standard pre-training by randomly packing multiple documents into a long pre-training sequence. Recently, some existing works suggest that enhancing the relatedness of documents within the same pre-training sequence may be advantageous. However, these studies primarily focus on general domains, which cannot be readily applied in the biomedical domain where the distinction of fine-grained topics is harder. Is it possible to further improve the pre-training for biomedical language models (LMs) using exactly the same corpus?

However, their improved performance comes from increased computational burden and inference latency. Early Exit (EE) strategies can be used to enhance their efficiency, but their adaptation presents challenges in image captioning as it requires varying levels of semantic information for accurate predictions. To overcome this, we introduce CapEEN to improve the performance of EE strategies using knowledge distillation. Inference in CapEEN is completed at intermediary layers if prediction confidence exceeds a predefined value learned from the training data. To account for real-world deployments, where target distributions could drift from that of training samples, we introduce a variant A-CapEEN to adapt the thresholds on the fly using Multi-armed bandits framework.

We are motivated by the premise that retrieval benefits from segments that can vary in size such that a content’s semantic independence is better captured. We propose LumberChunker, a method leveraging an LLM to dynamically segment documents, which iteratively prompts the LLM to identify the point within a group of sequential passages where the content begins to shift. To evaluate our method, we introduce GutenQA, a benchmark with 3000 “needle in a haystack” type of question-answer pairs derived from 100 public domain narrative books available on Project Gutenberg. Our experiments show that LumberChunker not only outperforms the most competitive baseline by 7.37% in retrieval performance (DCG@20) but also that, when integrated into a RAG pipeline, LumberChunker proves to be more effective than other chunking methods and competitive baselines, such as the Gemini 1.5M... | André V.

Physics provides a rich domain for assessing their mathematical capabilities, where physical context requires that any symbolic manipulation satisfies complex semantics (e.g., units, tensorial order). In this work, we systematically remove crucial context from prompts to force instances where model inference may be algebraically coherent, yet unphysical. We assess LM capabilities in this domain using a curated dataset encompassing multiple notations and Physics subdomains. Further, we improve zero-shot scores using synthetic in-context examples, and demonstrate non-linear degradation of derivation quality with perturbation strength via the progressive omission of supporting premises. We find that the models’ mathematical reasoning is not physics-informed in this setting, where physical context is predominantly ignored in favour of reverse-engineering solutions. | Jordan Meadows, Tamsin James, André Freitas |  |

Despite its importance, little work exists on modelling rigour computationally, and there is a lack of analysis on whether these criteria can effectively signal or measure the rigour of scientific papers in practice. In this paper, we introduce a bottom-up, data-driven framework to automatically identify and define rigour criteria and assess their relevance in scientific writing. Our framework includes rigour keyword extraction, detailed rigour definition generation, and salient criteria identification. Furthermore, our framework is domain-agnostic and can be tailored to the evaluation of scientific rigour for different areas, accommodating the distinct salient criteria across fields. We conducted comprehensive experiments based on datasets collected from different domains (e.g. ICLR, ACL) to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in modelling rigour.

However, recent MEE methods employ weak alignment strategies and data augmentation with simple classification models, which ignore the capabilities of natural language-formulated event templates for the challenging Event Argument Extraction (EAE) task. In this work, we focus on EAE and address this issue by introducing a unified template filling model that connects the textual and visual modalities via textual prompts. This approach enables the exploitation of cross-ontology transfer and the incorporation of event-specific semantics. Experiments on the M2E2 benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our system surpasses the current SOTA on textual EAE by +7% F1, and performs generally better than the second-best systems for multimedia EAE. | Philipp Seeberger, Dominik Wagner, Korbinian Riedhammer |  |

In this work, we study strategies to save annotation budgets while achieving competitive or even better performances for iterative preference learning. Built on intuitions from active learning, we empirically show that annotating those response pairs with small margins is generally better than large or random. Besides, experiments under the multi-iteration scenario suggest allocating more annotation budgets in the earlier iterations rather than later ones. | Sen Yang, Leyang Cui, Deng Cai, Xinting Huang, Shuming Shi, Wai Lam |  |

In our work, we propose a new task formulation of dense retrieval, cross-lingual contextualized phrase retrieval, which aims to augment cross-lingual applications by addressing polysemy using context information. However, the lack of specific training data and models are the primary challenges to achieve our goal. As a result, we extract pairs of cross-lingual phrases using word alignment information automatically induced from parallel sentences. Subsequently, we train our Cross-lingual Contextualized Phrase Retriever (CCPR) using contrastive learning, which encourages the hidden representations of phrases with similar contexts and semantics to align closely. Comprehensive experiments on both the cross-lingual phrase retrieval task and a downstream task, i.e, machine translation, demonstrate the effectiveness of CCPR.

However, long video understanding presents unique challenges due to the complexity of reasoning over extended timespans, even for zero-shot LLM-based approaches. The challenge of information redundancy in long videos prompts the question of what specific information is essential for large language models (LLMs) and how to leverage them for complex spatial-temporal reasoning in long-form video analysis. We propose a framework VideoINSTA , i.e. INformative Spatial-TemporAl Reasoning for zero-shot long-form video understanding.VideoINSTA contributes (1) a zero-shot framework for long video understanding using LLMs; (2) an event-based temporalreasoning and content-based spatial reasoning approach for LLMs to reason over spatial-temporal information in videos; (3) a self-reflective information... | Ruotong Liao, Max Erler, Huiyu Wang, Guangyao Zhai, Gengyuan Zhang, Yunpu Ma, Volker Tresp |  |

Previous work has primarily focused on enhancing decompilation performance by increasing the scale of model parameters or training data for pre-training. Based on the characteristics of the decompilation task, we propose two methods: (1) Without fine-tuning, the Self-Constructed Context Decompilation (sc2dec) method recompiles the LLM’s decompilation results to construct pairs for in-context learning, helping the model improve decompilation performance. (2) Fine-grained Alignment Enhancement (FAE), which meticulously aligns assembly code with source code at the statement level by leveraging debugging information, is employed during the fine-tuning phase to achieve further improvements in decompilation. By integrating these two methods, we achieved a Re-Executability performance improvement of approximately 3.90% on the Decompile-Eval benchmark, establishing... | Yunlong Feng, Dechuan Teng, Yang Xu, Honglin Mu, Xiao Xu, Libo Qin, Qingfu Zhu, Wanxiang Che |  |

However, they are not equally sensitive to the subtle changes to that context.To quantify this, Du et al. (2024) gives an information-theoretic metric to measure such sensitivity. Their metric, susceptibility, is defined as the degree to which contexts can influence a model’s response to a query at a distributional level.However, exactly computing susceptibility is difficult and, thus, Du et al. (2024) falls back on a Monte Carlo approximation.Due to the large number of samples required, the Monte Carlo approximation is inefficient in practice. As a faster alternative, we propose Fisher susceptibility, an efficient method to estimate the susceptibility based on Fisher information.Empirically, we validate that Fisher susceptibility is comparable to Monte Carlo estimated susceptibility across a diverse set of query domains despite its being 70×... | Tianyu Liu, Kevin Du, Mrinmaya Sachan, Ryan Cotterell |  |

Therefore, we have built a Korean dataset called ESG-Kor to automatically extract Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) information, which has recently gained importance. ESG-Kor is a dataset consisting of a total of 118,946 sentences that extracted information on each ESG component from Korean companies’ sustainability reports and manually labeled it according to objective rules provided by ESG evaluation agencies. To verify the effectiveness and applicability of the ESG-Kor dataset, classification performance was confirmed using several Korean pre-trained language models, and significant performance was obtained. Additionally, by extending the ESG classification model to documents of small and medium enterprises and extracting information based on ESG key issues and in-depth analysis, we demonstrated... | Jaeyoung Lee, Geonyeong Son, Misuk Kim |  |

One stream of approaches focuses on the iterative enhancement of LLMs by continuously verifying and refining their reasoning outputs for desired quality. Despite its impressive results, this paradigm faces two critical issues: (1) Simple verification methods: The current paradigm relies solely on a single verification method. (2) Wrong Information Ignorance: Traditional paradigms directly ignore wrong information during reasoning and refine the logic paths from scratch each time. To address these challenges, we propose Wrong-of-Thought (WoT), which includes two core modules: (1) Multi-Perspective Verification: A multi-perspective verification method for accurately refining the reasoning process and result, and (2) Wrong Information Utilization: Utilizing wrong information to alert LLMs and reduce the probability of LLMs... | Yongheng Zhang, Qiguang Chen, Jingxuan Zhou, Peng Wang, Jiasheng Si, Jin Wang, Wenpeng Lu, Libo Qin |  |

We firstly show that language models sometimes confuse which predicates apply to which objects. To mitigate this, we explore two tasks: question answering (Q/A), and first order logic (FOL) translation, and two regimes, prompting and finetuning. In FOL translation, we finetune several large language models on synthetic datasets designed to gauge their generalization abilities. For Q/A, we finetune encoder models like BERT and RoBERTa and use prompting for LLMs. The results show that FOL translation for LLMs is better suited to learn predicate argument structure. | Akshay Chaturvedi, Nicholas Asher |  |

To accelerate training and reduce computational demands, we investigate the coreset selection problem for the training data of LLM heuristic learning. Few methods to learn the heuristic functions consider the interaction between the search algorithm and the machine learning model. In this work, we empirically disentangle the requirements of A\* search algorithm from the requirements of the LLM to generalise on this task. Surprisingly, we find an overlap between their requirements; A\* requires more accurate predictions on search nodes near the goal, and LLMs need the same set of nodes for effective generalisation. With these insights, we derive a data-selection distribution for learning LM-based heuristics. On three classical planning domains, maze navigation, Sokoban and sliding tile puzzles, our technique reduces the number of... | Devaansh Gupta, Boyang Li |  |

The Abstract and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) offers challenging problems yet unsolved by AI. While ARC effectively assesses reasoning, its generation-based evaluation overlooks other assessment aspects. Bloom’s Taxonomy suggests evaluating six cognitive stages: Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, and Create. To extend ARC’s focus beyond the Create stage, we developed MC-LARC, a multiple-choice format suitable for assessing stages like Understand and Apply in Large Language Models (LLMs). Our evaluation of ChatGPT4V’s analogical reasoning using MC-LARC confirmed that this format supports LLMs’ reasoning capabilities and facilitates evidence analysis. However, we observed LLMs using shortcuts in MC-LARC tasks. To address this, we propose a self-feedback framework where LLMs identify issues and generate improved options.

Despite new techniques being proposed regularly, the evaluation of meeting summarization techniques relies on metrics not tailored to capture meeting-specific errors, leading to ineffective assessment. This paper explores what established automatic metrics capture and the errors they mask by correlating metric scores with human evaluations across a comprehensive error taxonomy. We start by reviewing the literature on English meeting summarization to identify key challenges, such as speaker dynamics and contextual turn-taking, and error types, including missing information and linguistic inaccuracy, concepts previously loosely defined in the field. We then examine the relationship between these challenges and errors using human annotated transcripts and summaries from encoder-decoder-based and autoregressive Transformer models on the QMSum dataset. Experiments reveal that different model... | Frederic Kirstein, Jan Philip Wahle, Terry Ruas, Bela Gipp |  |

Acquiring extensive knowledge through language modeling on web-scale corpora, they excel on English NLU, yet struggle to extend their NLU capabilities to underrepresented languages. In contrast, machine translation models (MT) produce excellent multilingual representations, resulting in strong translation performance even for low-resource languages. MT encoders, however, lack the knowledge necessary for comprehensive NLU that LLMs obtain through language modeling training on immense corpora. In this work, we get the best both worlds by integrating MT encoders directly into LLM backbones via sample-efficient self-distillation. The resulting MT-LLMs preserve the inherent multilingual representational alignment from the MT encoder, allowing lower-resource languages to tap into the rich knowledge embedded in English-centric LLMs. Merging the MT encoder and LLM in a... | Fabian David Schmidt, Philipp Borchert, Ivan Vulic, Goran Glavas |  |

Despite the fact that some LLMs have multilingual capabilities, recent studies have shown that their inference efficiency deteriorates when generating text in languages other than English. This results in increased inference time and costs. Cross-lingual vocabulary adaptation (CVA) methods have been proposed for adapting models to a target language aiming to improve downstream performance. However, the effectiveness of these methods on increasing inference efficiency of generative LLMs has yet to be explored. In this paper, we perform an empirical study of five CVA methods on four generative LLMs (including monolingual and multilingual models) across four typologically-diverse languages and four natural language understanding tasks. We find that CVA substantially contributes to LLM inference speedups of up to 271.5%. We... | Atsuki Yamaguchi, Aline Villavicencio, Nikolaos Aletras |  |

In this paper, we introduce a unified framework, AutoDetect, to automatically expose weaknesses in LLMs across various tasks. Inspired by the educational assessment process that measures students’ learning outcomes, AutoDetect consists of three LLM-powered agents: Examiner, Questioner, and Assessor.The collaboration among these three agents is designed to realize comprehensive and in-depth weakness identification. Our framework demonstrates significant success in uncovering flaws, with an identification... | Jiale Cheng, Yida Lu, Xiaotao Gu, Pei Ke, Xiao Liu, Yuxiao Dong, Hongning Wang, Jie Tang, Minlie Huang |  |

This paper examines the impact of personalized preference optimization on LLMs, revealing that the extent of knowledge loss varies significantly with preference heterogeneity. Although previous approaches have utilized the KL constraint between the reference model and the policy model, we observe that they fail to maintain general knowledge and alignment when facing personalized preferences. To this end, we introduce Base-Anchored Preference Optimization (BAPO), a simple yet effective approach that utilizes the initial responses of reference model to mitigate forgetting while accommodating personalized alignment. BAPO effectively adapts to diverse user preferences while minimally affecting global knowledge or general alignment.

We enhance the performance of end-to-end ASR systems by instructing a large language model (LLM) to correct the ASR model’s predictions. The LLM’s context is augmented with a dictionary of cross-lingual words that are phonetically and graphemically similar to the potentially incorrect proper nouns in the ASR predictions. Our dictionary-based method DiP-ASR (Dictionary-based Prompting for Automatic Speech Recognition) significantly reduces word error rates compared to both the end-to-end ASR baseline and instruction-based prompting of the LLM without the dictionary across cross-lingual proper noun recognition tasks involving three secondary languages. | Rishabh Kumar, Sabyasachi Ghosh, Ganesh Ramakrishnan |  |

In low-resource environments such as specialized domains, their few-shot capabilities are expected to deliver high performance. Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a critical task in information extraction that is not covered in recent LLM benchmarks. There is a need for better understanding the performance of LLMs for NER in a variety of settings including languages other than English. This study aims to evaluate generative LLMs, employed through prompt engineering, for few-shot clinical NER. We compare 13 auto-regressive models using prompting and 16 masked models using fine-tuning on 14 NER datasets covering English, French and Spanish. While prompt-based auto-regressive models achieve competitive F1 for general NER, they are outperformed within the clinical domain by lighter biLSTM-CRF taggers based on masked models.

We propose a parameter-efficient approach to learning ASR and TTS jointly via a multi-task learning objective and shared parameters. Our evaluation demonstrates thatthe performance of our multi-task model is comparable to that of individually trained models while significantly savingcomputational and memory costs (~50% reduction in the total number of parameters required for the two tasks combined). We experiment with English as a resource-rich language, and Arabic as a relatively low-resource language due to shortage of TTS data. Our models are trained with publicly available data, and both the training code and model checkpoints are openly available for further research. | Hawau Olamide Toyin, Hao Li, Hanan Aldarmaki |  |

Most existing models rely on high-quality text representations provided by pre-trained language models (PLMs). They hence face the challenge of input length limitation caused by PLMs, when dealing with long texts. In light of this, we introduce a comprehensive approach to multi-label long text classification. We propose a text segmentation algorithm, which guarantees to produce the optimal segmentation, to address the issue of input length limitation caused by PLMs. We incorporate external knowledge, labels’ co-occurrence relations, and attention mechanisms in representation learning to enhance both text and label representations. Our method’s effectiveness is validated through extensive experiments on various MLTC datasets, unraveling the intricate correlations between texts and labels. | Wang Zhang, Xin Wang, Qian Wang, Tao Deng, Xiaoru Wu |  |

However, current text-to-SQL LLMs are computationally expensive and challenging to deploy in real-world applications, highlighting the importance of compressing them. To achieve this goal, knowledge distillation (KD) is a common approach, which aims to distill the larger teacher model into a smaller student model. While numerous KD methods for autoregressive LLMs have emerged recently, it is still under-explored whether they work well in complex text-to-SQL scenarios. To this end, we conduct a series of analyses and reveal that these KD methods generally fall short in balancing performance and efficiency. In response to this problem, we propose to improve the KD with imperfect data, namely KID, which effectively boosts the performance without introducing much training budget. The core of KID is to efficiently mitigate the... | Qihuang Zhong, Kunfeng Chen, Liang Ding, Juhua Liu, Bo Du, Dacheng Tao |  |

This study investigates applying conformal prediction (CP), which can transform any heuristic uncertainty notion into rigorous prediction sets, to black-box LLMs in open-ended NLG tasks. We introduce a novel uncertainty measure based on self-consistency theory, and then develop a conformal uncertainty criterion by integrating the uncertainty condition aligned with correctness into the CP algorithm. Empirical evaluations indicate that our uncertainty measure outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we achieve strict control over the correctness coverage rate utilizing 7 popular LLMs on 4 free-form NLG datasets, spanning general-purpose and medical scenarios.

The attraction effect occurs when the presence of an inferior candidate makes a superior candidate more appealing, increasing the likelihood of the superior candidate being chosen over a non-dominated competitor. Our study finds consistent and significant evidence of the attraction effect in GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 when they assume the role of a recruiter. Irrelevant attributes of the decoy, such as its gender, further amplify the observed bias. GPT-4 exhibits greater bias variation than GPT-3.5. Our findings remain robust even when warnings against the decoy effect are included and the recruiter role definition is varied. | Kremena Valkanova, Pencho Yordanov |  |

Patronizing and condescending language (PCL) is a form of speech directed at vulnerable groups. As an essential branch of toxic language, this type of language exacerbates conflicts and confrontations among Internet communities and detrimentally impacts disadvantaged groups. Traditional pre-trained language models (PLMs) perform poorly in detecting PCL due to its implicit toxicity traits like hypocrisy and false sympathy. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), we can harness their rich emotional semantics to establish a paradigm for exploring implicit toxicity. In this paper, we introduce PclGPT, a comprehensive LLM benchmark designed specifically for PCL. We collect, annotate, and integrate the Pcl-PT/SFT dataset, and then develop a bilingual PclGPT-EN/CN model group through a comprehensive pre-training and supervised fine-tuning staircase process to facilitate implicit toxic detection.

The advancement in their capabilities, along with a reduction in parameter size and inference times, has facilitated the use of these models as agents, enabling interactions among multiple models to execute complex tasks. Such collaborations offer several advantages, including the use of specialized models (e.g. coding), improved confidence through multiple computations, and enhanced divergent thinking, leading to more diverse outputs. Thus, the collaborative use of language models is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. In this work, we evaluate the behavior of a network of models collaborating through debate under the influence of an adversary. We introduce pertinent metrics to assess the adversary’s effectiveness, focusing on system accuracy and model agreement.

Existing argument component types in education remain simplistic and isolated, failing to encapsulate the complete argument information. Originating from authentic examination settings, CEAMC categorizes argument components into 4 coarse-grained and 10 fine-grained delineations, surpassing previous simple representations to capture the subtle nuances of argumentation in the real world, thus meeting the needs of complex and diverse argumentative scenarios. Our contributions include the development of CEAMC, the establishment of baselines for further research, and a thorough exploration of the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on CEAMC. The results indicate that our CEAMC can serve as a challenging benchmark for the development of argument analysis in education. | Yupei Ren, Hongyi Wu, Zhaoguang Long, Shangqing Zhao, Xinyi Zhou, Zheqin Yin, Xinlin Zhuang, Xiaopeng Bai, Man Lan |  |

Existing Self-Instruct methods primarily simulate new instructions from a few initial instructions with in-context learning. However, our study identifies a critical flaw in this approach: even with GPT4o, it cannot generate complex instructions of length ≥ 100, which is necessary in complex tasks such as code completion.To address this issue, our key insight is that fine-tuning open source LLMs with only ten examples can produce complex instructions that maintain distributional consistency for complex reasoning tasks. We introduce Ada-Instruct, an adaptive instruction generator developed through fine-tuning. We empirically validated Ada-Instruct’s efficacy across different applications. The results highlight Ada-Instruct’s capacity to generate long, intricate, and distributionally consistent instructions. | Wanyun Cui, Qianle Wang |  |

The commonly used automatic evaluation metrics like ROUGE or BERTScore cannot accurately measure semantic similarities or answers from different perspectives. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been resorted to for NFQA evaluation due to their compelling performance on various NLP tasks. Common approaches include pointwise scoring of each candidate answer and pairwise comparisons between answers. Inspired by the evolution from pointwise to pairwise to listwise in learning-to-rank methods, we propose a novel listwise NFQA evaluation approach, that utilizes LLMs to rank candidate answers in a list of reference answers sorted by descending quality. Moreover, for NF questions that do not have multi-grade or any golden answers, we leverage LLMs to generate the reference answer list of various quality to facilitate the listwise evaluation.

To bridge this gap, this paper pioneers exploring and training powerful Multilingual Math Reasoning (xMR) LLMs. Firstly, by utilizing translation, we construct the first multilingual math reasoning instruction dataset, \*\*MGSM8KInstruct\*\*, encompassing ten distinct languages, thus addressing the issue of training data scarcity in xMR tasks. Based on the collected dataset, we propose different training strategies to build powerful xMR LLMs, named MathOctopus, notably outperform conventional open-source LLMs and exhibit superiority over ChatGPT in few-shot scenarios. Notably, MathOctopus-13B reaches 47.6% accuracy which exceeds ChatGPT 46.3% on MGSM testset. Beyond remarkable results, we unearth several pivotal observations and insights: (1) When extending the... | Nuo Chen, Zinan Zheng, Ning Wu, Ming Gong, Dongmei Zhang, Jia Li |  |

However, this approach often results in an overestimation of performance and lacks the ability to offer comprehensive, interpretable, and dynamic assessments of NLP models. Recently, works like DynaBench and Checklist have addressed these limitations through behavioral testing of NLP models with test types generated by a multi-step human-annotated pipeline. Unfortunately, manually creating a variety of test types requires significant human labor, thus weakening efficiency. In this work, we propose SynthEval, a hybrid behavioral testing framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate a wide range of test types for a comprehensive evaluation of NLP models. The SynthEval framework first generates sentences via LLMs using controlled generation, and then identifies challenging examples by comparing the predictions made by... | Raoyuan Zhao, Abdullatif Köksal, Yihong Liu, Leonie Weissweiler, Anna Korhonen, Hinrich Schütze |  |

While existing benchmarks employ automatic translation for multilingual evaluation, this approach is error-prone and potentially introduces culturally biased questions, especially in social sciences. We introduce the first multitask, multiple-choice Turkish QA benchmark, TurkishMMLU, to evaluate LLMs’ understanding of the Turkish language. TurkishMMLU includes over 10,000 questions, covering 9 different subjects from Turkish high-school education curricula. These questions are written by curriculum experts, suitable for the high-school curricula in Turkey, covering subjects ranging from natural sciences and math questions to more culturally representative topics such as Turkish Literature and the history of the Turkish Republic. We evaluate over 20 LLMs, including multilingual open-source (e.g., Gemma, Llama, MT5), closed-source (GPT 4o, Claude,... | Arda Yüksel, Abdullatif Köksal, Lütfi Kerem Senel, Anna Korhonen, Hinrich Schütze |  |

However, obtaining instruction data is costly and challenging. Prior work employs methods such as expensive human annotation, crowd-sourced datasets with alignment issues, and generating noisy examples via LLMs. We introduce the LongForm-C dataset, which is created by reverse instructions. We generate instructions via LLMs for human-written corpus examples using reverse instructions. First we select a diverse set of human-written documents from corpora such as C4 and Wikipedia; then we generate instructions for these documents via LLMs. This approach provides a cheaper and cleaner instruction-tuning dataset with natural output and one suitable for long text generation. Our models outperform 10x larger language models without instruction tuning on tasks such as story/recipe generation and long-form question answering. Moreover, LongForm models outperform prior instruction-tuned... | Abdullatif Köksal, Timo Schick, Anna Korhonen, Hinrich Schütze |  |

However, due to the black-box nature of GNNs, their outputs can be concerning in high-stakes decision-making scenarios, e.g., drug discovery. Facing such an issue, Graph Counterfactual Explanation (GCE) has emerged as a promising approach to improve GNN transparency. However, current GCE methods usually fail to take domain-specific knowledge into consideration, which can result in outputs that are not easily comprehensible by humans. To address this challenge, we propose a novel GCE method, LLM-GCE, to unleash the power of large language models (LLMs) in explaining GNNs for molecular property prediction. Specifically, we utilize an autoencoder to generate the counterfactual graph topology from a set of counterfactual text pairs (CTPs) based on an input graph. Meanwhile, we also incorporate a CTP dynamic feedback module to mitigate LLM hallucination,... | Yinhan He, Zaiyi Zheng, Patrick Soga, Yaochen Zhu, Yushun Dong, Jundong Li |  |

This paper reviews knowledge mechanism analysis from a novel taxonomy including knowledge utilization and evolution. Knowledge utilization delves into the mechanism of memorization, comprehension and application, and creation. Knowledge evolution focuses on the dynamic progression of knowledge within individual and group LLMs. Moreover, we discuss what knowledge LLMs have learned, the reasons for the fragility of parametric knowledge, and the potential dark knowledge (hypothesis) that will be challenging to address. We hope this work can help understand knowledge in LLMs and provide insights for future research. | Mengru Wang, Yunzhi Yao, Ziwen Xu, Shuofei Qiao, Shumin Deng, Peng Wang, Xiang Chen, JiaChen Gu, Yong Jiang, Pengjun Xie, Fei Huang, Huajun Chen, Ningyu Zhang |  |

Many sought to mitigate this by restricting the attention window within the pre-trained length. However, these methods introduce new issues such as ignoring the middle context and requiring additional training. To address these problems, we propose LongHeads, a training-free framework that enhances LLM’s long context ability by unlocking multi-head attention’s untapped potential. Instead of allowing each head to attend to the full sentence, which struggles with generalizing to longer sequences due to out-of-distribution (OOD) issues, we allow each head to process in-distribution length by selecting and attending to important context chunks. To this end, we propose a chunk selection strategy that relies on the inherent correlation between the... | Yi Lu, Xin Zhou, Wei He, Jun Zhao, Tao Ji, Tao Gui, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang |  |

Natural Language Processing techniques, such as transformer models, permit the quantitative, automated, and scalable analysis of therapists’ verbal behaviors. Here, we present a novel approach to extract linguistic features from text-based crisis intervention transcripts to analyze associations between specific crisis counselor verbal behaviors and perceived genuine concern. Linguistic features associated with higher perceived genuine concern included positive emotional language and affirmations; features associated with lower perceived genuine concern included self-oriented talk and overuse of templates. These findings provide preliminary evidence toward pathways for automating real-time feedback to crisis counselors about clients’ perception of the therapeutic relationship. | Greg Buda, Ignacio Tripodi, Margaret Meagher, Elizabeth A.

In sentence simplification, lexical paraphrasing is one of the primary procedures for rewriting complex sentences into simpler correspondences. While previous studies have confirmed the efficacy of lexically constrained decoding on this task, their constraints can be loose and may lead to sub-optimal generation. We address this problem by designing constraints that replicate the edit operations conducted in simplification and defining stricter satisfaction conditions. Our experiments indicate that the proposed method consistently outperforms the previous studies on three English simplification corpora commonly used in this task. | Tatsuya Zetsu, Yuki Arase, Tomoyuki Kajiwara |  |

However, these tasks are highly subjective and dependent on human factors, such as one’s environment, attitudes, beliefs, and lived experiences. Thus, it may be the case that employing LLMs (which do not have such human factors) in these tasks results in a lack of variation in data, failing to reflect the diversity of human experiences. In this paper, we examine the role of prompting LLMs with human-like personas and asking the models to answer as if they were a specific human. This is done explicitly, with exact demographics, political beliefs, and lived experiences, or implicitly via names prevalent in specific populations. The LLM personas are then evaluated via (1) subjective annotation task (e.g., detecting toxicity) and (2) a belief generation task, where both tasks are known to vary across human factors.

To address such concerns, we introduce DeB-Ang: the utilisation of a custom DeBERTa model with angular loss and contrastive loss functions for effective class separation in neural text classification tasks. We expand the application of this model on binary machine-generated text detection and multi-class neural authorship attribution. We demonstrate improved performance on many benchmark datasets whereby the accuracy for machine-generated text detection was increased by as much as 38.04% across all datasets. | Iqra Zahid, Yue Chang, Tharindu Madusanka, Youcheng Sun, Riza BatistaNavarro |  |

Nevertheless, training sequences and text labels modifies LLMs’ pre-trained weights, diminishing their inherent strength in constructing and comprehending natural language sentences. In this study, we propose a reconstruction-based LLM recommendation model (ReLRec) that harnesses the feature extraction capability of LLMs, while preserving LLMs’ sentence generation abilities. We reconstruct the user and item pseudo-labels generated from user reviews, while training on sequential data, aiming to exploit the key features of both users and items. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of label reconstruction in sequential recommendation tasks. | Hyunsoo Na, Minseok Gang, Youngrok Ko, Jinseok Seol, Sanggoo Lee |  |

However, they can also be exploited for improper purposes such as plagiarism or misinformation dissemination. Thus, there is an urgent need to detect the texts generated by LLMs. One type of most studied methods trains classification models to distinguish LLM texts from human texts. However, existing studies demonstrate the trained models may suffer from distribution shifts (during test), i.e., they are ineffective to predict the generated texts from unseen language tasks or topics which are not collected during training. In this work, we focus on ChatGPT as a representative model, and we conduct a comprehensive investigation on these methods’ generalization behaviors under distribution shift caused by a wide range of factors, including prompts, text lengths, topics, and language tasks. To achieve this goal, we first collect a new dataset with human and ChatGPT texts, and then we... | Han Xu, Jie Ren, Pengfei He, Shenglai Zeng, Yingqian Cui, Amy Liu, Hui Liu, Jiliang Tang |  |

In the private prediction framework, we only require the output synthetic data to satisfy differential privacy guarantees. This is in contrast to approaches that train a generative model on potentially sensitive user-supplied source data and seek to ensure the model itself is safe to release.We prompt a pretrained LLM with source data, but ensure that next-token predictions are made with differential privacy guarantees. Previous work in this paradigm reported generating a small number of examples (<10) at reasonable privacy levels, an amount of data that is useful only for downstream in-context learning or prompting. In contrast, we make changes that allow us to generate thousands of high-quality synthetic data points, greatly expanding the set of potential applications. Our improvements come from an improved privacy analysis and a better private... | Kareem Amin, Alex Bie, Weiwei Kong, Alexey Kurakin, Natalia Ponomareva, Umar Syed, Andreas Terzis, Sergei Vassilvitskii |  |

While various role-playing strategies in multi-agent debates have been explored, in terms of the communication among agents, existing approaches adopt a brute force algorithm – each agent can communicate with all other agents. In this paper, we systematically investigate the effect of communication connectivity in multi-agent systems. Our experiments on GPT and Mistral models reveal that multi-agent debates leveraging sparse communication topology can achieve comparable or superior performance while significantly reducing computational costs. Furthermore, we extend the multi-agent debate framework to multi-modal reasoning and alignment labeling tasks, showcasing its broad applicability and effectiveness. Our findings underscore the importance of communication connectivity on enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the “society of minds” approach. | Yunxuan Li, Yibing Du, Jiageng Zhang, Le Hou, Peter Grabowski, Yeqing Li, Eugene Ie |  |

This paper presents a novel approach to enhance the fact verification process through a Multi-stage ReRanking (M-ReRank) paradigm, which addresses the inherent limitations of single-stage evidence extraction. Our methodology leverages the strengths of advanced reranking techniques, including dense retrieval models and list-aware rerankers, to optimise the retrieval and ranking of evidence of both structured and unstructured types. We demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art models, achieving a recall rate of 93.63% for Wikipedia pages. The proposed system not only improves the retrieval of relevant sentences and table cells but also enhances the overall verification accuracy. Through extensive experimentation on the FEVEROUS dataset, we show that our M-ReRank pipeline achieves substantial improvements in evidence extraction, particularly increasing... | Shrikant Malviya, Stamos Katsigiannis |  |

In this paper, to avoid the expensive effort of human annotation on the verifier training data, we introduce Model-induced Process Supervision (MiPS), a novel method for automating data curation. MiPS annotates an intermediate step by sampling completions of this solution through the reasoning model, and obtaining an accuracy defined as the proportion of correct completions. Inaccuracies of the reasoner would cause MiPS underestimating the accuracy of intermediate steps, therefore, we suggest and empirically show that verification focusing on high predicted scores of the verifier shall be preferred over that of low predicted scores, contrary to prior observations on human curated data. Our approach significantly improves the performance of PaLM 2 on math and coding tasks (accuracy +0.67% on GSM8K, +4.16% on... | Zihan Wang, Yunxuan Li, Yuexin Wu, Liangchen Luo, Le Hou, Hongkun Yu, Jingbo Shang |  |

Within the update process, developers often prioritize improving overall performance metrics, paying less attention to maintaining compatibility with earlier model versions. Instance-level degradation (instance regression) of performance from one model version to the next can interfere with a user’s mental model of the capabilities of a particular language model. Users having to adapt their mental model with every update can lead to dissatisfaction, especially when the new model has degraded compared to a prior version for a known use case (model update regression).We find that when pretrained LLM base models are updated, fine-tuned user-facing downstream task adapters experience negative flips – previously correct instances are now predicted incorrectly. We observe model update regression between different model versions on a diverse set of tasks and models,... | Jessica Maria Echterhoff, Fartash Faghri, Raviteja Vemulapalli, TingYao Hu, ChunLiang Li, Oncel Tuzel, Hadi Pouransari |  |

We introduce a dataset for this task, MUCSUM, consisting of summaries of all events in the classic MUC-4 dataset, along with a set of baselines that comprises both pretrained LM standards in the summarization literature, as well as larger frontier models. We show that ablations that reduce EKS to traditional summarization or structure-to-text yield inferior summaries of target events and that MUCSUM is a robust benchmark for this task. Lastly, we conduct a human evaluation of both reference and model summaries, and provide some detailed analysis of the results. | William Gantt, Alexander Martin, Pavlo Kuchmiichuk, Aaron Steven White |  |

We created a multiple-choice question-and-answer (MCQA) exam by randomly sampling problems from standard LLM benchmarks. Then, we used nine popular LLMs with five prompt-engineering techniques to solve the MCQA problems while increasing the sampling temperature from 0.0 to 1.6. Despite anecdotal reports to the contrary, our empirical results indicate that changes in temperature from 0.0 to 1.0 do not have a statistically significant impact on LLM performance for problem-solving tasks. In addition, these results appear to generalize across LLMs, prompt-engineering techniques, and problem domains.

Existing approaches often overlook the varying difficulty levels inherent in legal document discourse styles and rhetorical roles. In this work, we propose HiCuLR, a hierarchical curriculum learning framework for RRL. It nests two curricula: Rhetorical Role-level Curriculum (RC) on the outer layer and Document-level Curriculum (DC) on the inner layer. DC categorizes documents based on their difficulty, utilizing metrics like deviation from a standard discourse structure and exposes the model to them in an easy-to-difficult fashion. RC progressively strengthens the model to discern coarse-to-fine-grained distinctions between rhetorical roles. Our experiments on four RRL datasets demonstrate the efficacy of HiCuLR, highlighting the complementary nature of DC and RC. | T. Y. S. S. Santosh, Apolline Isaia, Shiyu Hong, Matthias Grabmair |  |

Traditionally, training these models relies on extensive human-annotated preference data, which poses significant challenges in terms of scalability and cost. To overcome these limitations, we propose Semi-Supervised Reward Modeling (SSRM), an approach that enhances RM training using unlabeled data. Given an unlabeled dataset, SSRM involves three key iterative steps: pseudo-labeling unlabeled examples, selecting high-confidence examples through a confidence threshold, and supervised finetuning on the refined dataset. Across extensive experiments on various model configurations, we demonstrate that SSRM significantly improves reward models without incurring additional labeling costs. Notably, SSRM can achieve performance comparable to models trained entirely on labeled data of equivalent volumes.... | Yifei He, Haoxiang Wang, Ziyan Jiang, Alexandros Papangelis, Han Zhao |  |

This paper explores demonstration selection methods for data-to-text tasks that involve numerical time series data as inputs.Previously developed demonstration selection methods primarily focus on textual inputs, often relying on embedding similarities of textual tokens to select similar instances from an example bank. However, this approach may not be suitable for numerical time series data.To address this issue, we propose two novel selection methods: (1) sequence similarity-based selection using various similarity measures, and (2) task-specific knowledge-based selection.From our experiments on two benchmark datasets, we found that our proposed models significantly outperform baseline selections and often surpass fine-tuned models. We also found that scale-invariant similarity measures such as Pearson’s correlation work better than scale-variant measures such as... | Masayuki Kawarada, Tatsuya Ishigaki, Goran Topic, Hiroya Takamura |  |

To address this challenge, we introduce a novel task-free test bed for evaluating and interpreting sentence embeddings. Our test bed consists of five semantic similarity alignment criteria, namely, \*semantic distinction, synonym replacement, antonym replacement, paraphrasing without negation, and sentence jumbling\*. Using these criteria, we examined five classical (e.g., Sentence-BERT, Universal Sentence Encoder (USE), etc.) and eight LLM-induced sentence embedding techniques (e.g., LLaMA2, GPT-3, OLMo, etc.) to test whether their semantic similarity spaces align with what a human mind would naturally expect. Our extensive experiments with 13 different sentence encoders revealed that none of the studied embeddings aligned with all the five semantic similarity alignment criteria.

However, most PEFT strategies are manually designed, often resulting in suboptimal performance. Recent automatic PEFT approaches aim to address this but face challenges such as search space entanglement, inefficiency, and lack of integration between parameter budgets and search processes. To overcome these issues, we introduce a novel Budget-guided Iterative search strategy for automatic PEFT (BIPEFT), significantly enhancing search efficiency. BIPEFT employs a new iterative search strategy to disentangle the binary module and rank dimension search spaces. Additionally, we design early selection strategies based on parameter budgets, accelerating the learning process by gradually removing unimportant modules and fixing rank dimensions. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of BIPEFT in achieving efficient... | Aofei Chang, Jiaqi Wang, Han Liu, Parminder Bhatia, Cao Xiao, Ting Wang, Fenglong Ma |  |

However, the performance of ICL has been shown to be highly sensitive to the selection of few-shot demonstrations. Selecting the most suitable examples as context remains an ongoing challenge and an open problem. Existing literature has highlighted the importance of selecting examples that are diverse or semantically similar to the test sample while ignoring the fact that the optimal selection dimension, i.e., diversity or similarity, is task-specific. Based on how the test sample is answered, we propose Iterative Demonstration Selection (IDS) to leverage the merits of both dimensions. Using zero-shot chain-of-thought reasoning (Zero-shot-CoT), IDS iteratively selects examples that are diverse but still strongly correlated with the test sample as ICL demonstrations. Specifically, IDS applies Zero-shot-CoT to the test sample before... | Chengwei Qin, Aston Zhang, Chen Chen, Anirudh Dagar, Wenming Ye |  |

This debate has emerged from the insufficient evidence that explanations help people in situations they are introduced for. More human-centered, application-grounded evaluations of explanations are needed to settle this. Yet, with no established guidelines for such studies in NLP, researchers accustomed to standardized proxy evaluations must discover appropriate measurements, tasks, datasets, and sensible models for human-AI teams in their studies. To aid with this, we first review existing metrics suitable for application-grounded evaluation. We then establish criteria to select appropriate datasets, and using them, we find that only 4 out of over 50 datasets available for explainability research in NLP meet them. We then demonstrate the importance of reassessing the state of the art to form and study human-AI teams: teaming people with models for certain tasks might only now start to make sense, and for others, it remains unsound.

For the first time, we detect and add anchor words to the text generation process in an unsupervised way. Firstly, we adopt a clustering algorithm to adaptively detect anchor words that are highly consistent with every topic, which forms the path of topic → anchor word. Secondly, we add the causal path of anchor word → word to the popular Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) framework via implicitly using word co-occurrence graphs. We develop the causal path of topic+anchor word → higher-layer topic that aids the expression of topic concepts with anchor words to capture a more semantically tight hierarchical topic structure. Finally, we enhance the model’s representation of the anchor words through a novel contrastive learning. After jointly training the aforementioned constraint objectives, we can produce more coherent and diverse... | Jiyuan Liu, Hegang Chen, Chunjiang Zhu, Yanghui Rao |  |

However, recent works reveal the risk of the model stealing attack, posing a financial threat to EaaS providers. To protect the copyright of EaaS, we propose GuardEmb, a dynamic embedding watermarking method, striking a balance between enhancing watermark detectability and preserving embedding functionality. Our approach involves selecting special tokens and perturbing embeddings containing these tokens to inject watermarks. Simultaneously, we train a verifier to detect these watermarks.

However, they still fail on some straightforward visual question-answering (VQA) problems. This paper dives deeper into this issue, revealing that models tend to err when answering easy questions (e.g., Yes/No questions) about an image, even though they can correctly describe it.We refer to this model behavior discrepancy between difficult and simple questions as model laziness.To systematically investigate model laziness, we manually construct LazyBench, a benchmark that includes Yes/No, multiple choice, short answer questions, and image description tasks that are related to the same subjects in the images.Based on LazyBench. we observe that laziness widely exists in current advanced MLLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5-pro, Claude 3, LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-1.6, and QWen-VL). We also analyzed the failure cases of LLaVA-1.5-13B on the VQA-v2 benchmark and discovered... | Sihang Zhao, Youliang Yuan, Xiaoying Tang, Pinjia He |  |

Existing methods focus on transferring in-domain (IND) prior knowledge to out-of-domain (OOD) data through pre-training and clustering stages. They either handle the two processes in a pipeline manner, which exhibits a gap between intent representation and clustering process or use typical contrastive clustering that overlooks the potential supervised signals from the whole data. Besides, they often deal with either open intent discovery or OOD settings individually. To this end, we propose a Pseudo-Label enhanced Prototypical Contrastive Learning (PLPCL) model for uniformed intent discovery. We iteratively utilize pseudo-labels to explore potential positive/negative samples for contrastive learning and bridge the gap between representation and clustering. To enable better knowledge transfer, we design a prototype learning method integrating the supervised and pseudo signals from IND and OOD samples.

Recently, weight-only quantization techniques have also been applied to LoRA methods to reduce the memory footprint of fine-tuning. However, applying weight-activation quantization to the LoRA pipeline is under-explored, and we observe substantial performance degradation primarily due to the presence of activation outliers. In this work, we propose RoLoRA, the first LoRA-based scheme to apply rotation for outlier elimination, and then fine-tune rotated outlier-free LLMs for effective weight-activation quantization. Different from previous work tackling the outlier challenges from a post-training perspective, we propose rotation-aware fine-tuning to eliminate and preserve the outlier-free characteristics brought by rotation operations. RoLoRA can improve low-bit LoRA... | Xijie Huang, Zechun Liu, ShihYang Liu, KwangTing Cheng |  |

Enhance Legal Reasoning with Insights from Multi-Agent Collaboration](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.findings-emnlp.445) |  | 0 | Large Language Models (LLMs) could struggle to fully understand legal theories and perform complex legal reasoning tasks. In this study, we introduce a challenging task (confusing charge prediction) to better evaluate LLMs’ understanding of legal theories and reasoning capabilities. We also propose a novel framework: Multi-Agent framework for improving complex Legal Reasoning capability (MALR). MALR employs non-parametric learning, encouraging LLMs to automatically decompose complex legal tasks and mimic human learning process to extract insights from legal rules, helping LLMs better understand legal theories and enhance their legal reasoning abilities. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively addresses complex reasoning issues in practical scenarios, paving the way for more reliable applications in the legal domain. | Weikang Yuan, Junjie Cao, Zhuoren Jiang, Yangyang Kang, Jun Lin, Kaisong Song, Tianqianjin Lin, Pengwei Yan, Changlong Sun, Xiaozhong Liu |  |

Combining explainable Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with LLMs is a promising path to address this issue. However, structured KGs are difficult to utilize, and how to make LLMs understand and incorporate them is a challenging topic. We thereby reorganize a more efficient structure of KGs, while designing the KG-related instruction tuning and continual pre-training strategies to enable LLMs to learn and internalize this form of representation effectively. Moreover, we construct subgraphs to further enhance the retrieval capabilities of KGs via CoT reasoning. Extensive experiments on two KGQA datasets demonstrate that our model achieves convincing performance compared to strong baselines. | Yixin Ji, Kaixin Wu, Juntao Li, Wei Chen, Mingjie Zhong, Jia Xu, Min Zhang |  |

Our study explores LLMs’ long-context reasoning by probing their hidden representations. We find that while LLMs encode the position of target information, they often fail to leverage this in generating accurate responses. This reveals a disconnect between information retrieval and utilization, a “know but don’t tell” phenomenon. We further analyze the relationship between extraction time and final accuracy, offering insights into the underlying mechanics of transformer models. | Muhan Gao, Taiming Lu, Kuai Yu, Adam Byerly, Daniel Khashabi |  |

However, when applied as agents in embodied environments, they often suffer from misalignment between their intrinsic knowledge and environmental knowledge, leading to infeasible actions. Traditional environment alignment methods, such as supervised learning on expert trajectories and reinforcement learning, encounter limitations in covering environmental knowledge and achieving efficient convergence, respectively. Inspired by human learning, we propose Exploration-based Error Correction Learning (E2CL), a novel framework that leverages exploration-induced errors and environmental feedback to enhance environment alignment for embodied agents. E2CL incorporates teacher-guided and teacher-free explorations to gather environmental feedback and correct erroneous actions. The agent learns to provide feedback and self-correct, thereby enhancing its adaptability to target environments. Extensive... | Hanlin Wang, Chak Tou Leong, Jian Wang, Wenjie Li |  |

In response to the recent popularity of generative LLMs, many RAG approaches have been proposed, which involve an intricate number of different configurations such as evaluation datasets, collections, metrics, retrievers, and LLMs. Inconsistent benchmarking poses a major challenge in comparing approaches and understanding the impact of each component in the pipeline. In this work, we study best practices that lay the groundwork for a systematic evaluation of RAG and present BERGEN, an end-to-end library for reproducible research standardizing RAG experiments. In an extensive study focusing on QA, we benchmark different state-of-the-art retrievers, rerankers, and LLMs. Additionally, we analyze existing RAG metrics and datasets. | David Rau, Hervé Déjean, Nadezhda Chirkova, Thibault Formal, Shuai Wang, Stéphane Clinchant, Vassilina Nikoulina |  |

Developing counter-narratives (CNs) that confront biases and stereotypes driving hateful narratives is considered an impactful strategy. Current automatic methods focus on isolated utterances to detect and react to hateful content online, often omitting the conversational context where HS naturally occurs. In this work, we explore strategies for the incorporation of conversational history for CN generation, comparing text and graphical representations with varying degrees of context. Overall, automatic and human evaluations show that 1) contextualized representations are comparable to those of isolated utterances, and 2) models based on graph representations outperform text representations, thus opening new research directions for future work. | Selene Baez Santamaría, Helena GómezAdorno, Ilia Markov |  |

However, the parsing accuracy drops sharply when the model is transferred to low-resource language due to distribution shifts. To alleviate this issue, we propose a representation alignment and adversarial model to filter out useful knowledge from rich-resource language and ignore useless ones. Our proposed model consists of two components, i.e., an alignment network in the input layer for selecting useful language-specific features and an adversarial network in the encoder layer for augmenting the language-invariant contextualized features. Experiments on the benchmark datasets show that our proposed model outperforms RoBERTa-enhanced strong baseline models by 1.37 LAS and 1.34 UAS. Detailed analysis shows that both alignment and adversarial networks are equally important in alleviating the distribution shifts problem and can... | Ying Li, Jianjian Liu, Zhengtao Yu, Shengxiang Gao, Yuxin Huang, Cunli Mao |  |

It involves identifying a text’s aspect,sentiment, opinion, and category. Existing methods have insufficiently explored how to effectively leverage the knowledge of pre-trainedlanguage models (PLMs) to handle implicit aspects and opinions, particularly in combinations such as implicit aspect & explicit opinion, explicit aspect & implicit opinion, and implicit aspect & implicit opinion. We introduce ITSCL, a framework leveraging Instruction Tuning and Supervised Contrastive Learning to improve aspect sentiment quad predictions, especially for implicit aspects and opinions. Implementing this approach presents several challenges. First, designing effective instructions and prompts to optimize the model’s training is difficult. Second, creating sentiment combination vectors with contrastive learning to enhance the model’s discrimination requires further investigation.

Thus, it is essential for LVLMs to proactively engage with humans to ask for clarifications or additional information for better responses. In this study, we aim to shift LVLMs from passive answer providers to proactive engaged partners. We begin by establishing a three-tiered hierarchy for questions of invalid, ambiguous, and personalizable nature to measure the proactive engagement capabilities of LVLMs. Utilizing this hierarchy, we create PIE, (ProactIve Engagement Evaluation) through GPT-4o and human annotators, consisting of 853 questions across six distinct, fine-grained question types that are verified by human annotators and accompanied with well-defined metrics. Our evaluations on indicate poor performance of existing LVLMs, with... | Shujin Wu, Yi Fung, Sha Li, Yixin Wan, KaiWei Chang, Heng Ji |  |

Previous work separately learns each new domain knowledge based on parameter isolation methods, which effectively capture the new knowledge. However, task-specific parameters lead to isolation between models, which hinders the mutual transfer of knowledge between new domains. Given the scarcity of domain-specific corpora, we consider making full use of the data from multiple new domains. Therefore, our work aims to leverage previously acquired domain knowledge when modeling subsequent domains. To this end, we propose an Iterative Continual Learning (ICL) framework for multi-domain neural machine translation. Specifically, when each new domain arrives, (1) we first build a pluggable incremental learning model, (2) then we design an iterative updating algorithm to continuously update the original model, which can be used... | Zhibo Man, Kaiyu Huang, Yujie Zhang, Yuanmeng Chen, Yufeng Chen, Jinan Xu |  |

However, the complex nature of clinical environments presents significant hallucination challenges for LLMs, hindering their widespread adoption. In this paper, we address these hallucination issues in the context of Medical Information Extraction (MIE) tasks by introducing ALternate Contrastive Decoding (ALCD). We begin by redefining MIE tasks as an identify-and-classify process. We then separate the identification and classification functions of LLMs by selectively masking the optimization of tokens during fine-tuning. During the inference stage, we alternately contrast output distributions derived from sub-task models. This approach aims to selectively enhance the identification and classification capabilities while minimizing the influence of other inherent abilities in LLMs. Additionally, we propose an alternate adaptive constraint strategy to more... | Derong Xu, Ziheng Zhang, Zhihong Zhu, Zhenxi Lin, Qidong Liu, Xian Wu, Tong Xu, Xiangyu Zhao, Yefeng Zheng, Enhong Chen |  |

However, the use of large PLMs significantly increases inference costs, making them less practical for situations requiring low inference times. Furthermore, it is crucial to simultaneously model the relationships between topics and words as well as the interrelationships among topics themselves. In this work, we propose a novel framework called NeuroMax (\*\*Neur\*\*al T\*\*o\*\*pic Model with \*\*Max\*\*imizing Mutual Information with Pretrained Language Model and Group Topic Regularization) to address these challenges.

Despite this, most evaluations focus solely on synthetic data. To address this, we introduce RealInstruct, the first benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs’ ability to follow real-world multi-constrained instructions by leveraging queries real users asked AI assistants. We also investigate model-based evaluation as a cost-effective alternative to human annotation for this task. Our findings reveal that even the proprietary GPT-4 model fails to meet at least one constraint on over 21% of instructions, highlighting the limitations of state-of-the-art models. To address the performance gap between open-source and proprietary models, we propose the Decompose, Critique and Refine (DeCRIM) self-correction pipeline, which enhances LLMs’ ability to... | Thomas Palmeira Ferraz, Kartik Mehta, YuHsiang Lin, HawShiuan Chang, Shereen Oraby, Sijia Liu, Vivek Subramanian, Tagyoung Chung, Mohit Bansal, Nanyun Peng |  |

Recent studies have attempted to enhance LLMs’ performance by combining step-wise planning with external retrieval. While effective for advanced models like GPT-3.5, smaller LLMs face challenges in decomposing complex questions, necessitating supervised fine-tuning. Previous work has relied on manual annotation and knowledge distillation from teacher LLMs, which are time-consuming and not accurate enough. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for enhancing LLMs’ planning capabilities by using planning data derived from knowledge graphs (KGs). LLMs fine-tuned with this data have improved planning capabilities, better equipping them to handle complex QA tasks that involve retrieval. Evaluations on multiple datasets, including our newly proposed benchmark, highlight the effectiveness of our framework and the benefits of KG-derived planning... | Junjie Wang, Mingyang Chen, Binbin Hu, Dan Yang, Ziqi Liu, Yue Shen, Peng Wei, Zhiqiang Zhang, Jinjie Gu, Jun Zhou, Jeff Z.

Extracting pair, triple, or quad of elements is defined as compound ABSA. Due to its challenges and practical applications, such a compound scenario has become an emerging topic. Recently, large language models (LLMs), e.g. ChatGPT and LLaMA, present impressive abilities in tackling various human instructions. In this work, we are particularly curious whether LLMs still possess superior performance in handling compound ABSA tasks. To assess the performance of LLMs, we design a novel framework, called ChatABSA. Concretely, we design two strategies: constrained prompts, to automatically organize the returned predictions; post-processing, to better evaluate the capability of LLMs in recognition of implicit information. The overall evaluation involves 5 compound ABSA tasks and 8 publicly... | Yinhao Bai, Zhixin Han, Yuhua Zhao, Hang Gao, Zhuowei Zhang, Xunzhi Wang, Mengting Hu |  |

However, these models often suffer from the “hallucination” problem, where the generated headline is not fully supported by its source article. Efforts to address this issue have predominantly focused on English, using over-simplistic classification schemes that overlook nuanced hallucination types. In this study, we introduce the first multilingual, fine-grained news headline hallucination detection dataset that contains over 11 thousand <article, headline> pairs in 5 languages, each annotated with detailed hallucination types by experts. We conduct extensive experiments on this dataset under two settings. First, we implement several supervised fine-tuning approaches as preparatory solutions and demonstrate this dataset’s challenges and utilities.

The research focus has shifted to Hierarchical Attribution (HA) for its ability to model feature interactions. Recent works model non-contiguous combinations with a time-costly greedy search in Eculidean spaces, neglecting underlying linguistic information in feature representations. In this work, we introduce a novel method, namely Poincare Explanation (PE), for modeling feature interactions with hyperbolic spaces in a time efficient manner.Specifically, we take building text hierarchies as finding spanning trees in hyperbolic spaces. First we project the embeddings into hyperbolic spaces to elicit inherit semantic and syntax hierarchical structures. Then we propose a simple yet effective strategy to calculate Shapley score.

However, the overall preference annotations of responses do not fully capture the fine-grained quality of model outputs in complex multi-step reasoning tasks, such as mathematical reasoning. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel algorithm called Step-level Value Preference Optimization (SVPO). Our approach employs Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to automatically annotate step-level preferences for multi-step reasoning. Furthermore, from the perspective of learning-to-rank, we train an explicit value model to replicate the behavior of the implicit reward model, complementing standard preference optimization. This value model enables the LLM to generate higher reward responses with minimal cost during inference.

To address this, we propose SA-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that covers three tiers of situational awareness capabilities, covering environment perception, situation comprehension and future projection. SA-Bench provides a comprehensive evaluation to explore the situational awareness capabilities of LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on advanced LLMs, including GPT-4, LLaMA3, Qwen1.5, among others.

Existing methods often overemphasize inter-modal alignment, neglecting the nuanced nature of conversational context. Dialogue histories are frequently cluttered with redundant information and often lack direct image descriptions, leading to a substantial disconnect between conversational content and visual representation. This study introduces VCU, a novel framework designed to enhance the comprehension of dialogue history and improve cross-modal matching for image retrieval.

To explore the mechanistic causes of these hallucinations, we create diagnostic datasets with subject-relation queries and adapt interpretability methods to trace hallucinations through internal model representations. We discover two general and distinct mechanistic causes of hallucinations shared across LMs (Llama-2, Pythia, GPT-J): 1) : insufficient subject attribute knowledge in lower layer MLPs, and 2) : failure to select the correct object attribute in upper layer attention heads. We also found these two internal mechanistic causes of hallucinations are reflected in external manifestations. Based on insights from our mechanistic analysis, we propose a novel hallucination mitigation method through targeted restoration of the LM’s internal fact recall pipeline, demonstrating superior performance compared to baselines. | Lei Yu, Meng Cao, Jackie C.

However, concerns have arisen as LLMs will exhibit discriminatory ranking behaviors based on users’ sensitive attributes (gender). Worse still, in this paper, we identify a subtler form of discrimination in LLMs, termed implicit ranking unfairness, where LLMs exhibit discriminatory ranking patterns based solely on non-sensitive user profiles, such as user names. Such implicit unfairness is more widespread but less noticeable, threatening the ethical foundation. To comprehensively explore such unfairness, our analysis will focus on three research aspects: (1) We propose an evaluation method to investigate the severity of implicit ranking unfairness. (2) We uncover the reasons for causing such unfairness. (3) To mitigate such unfairness effectively, we utilize a pair-wise regression method to conduct fair-aware data augmentation for LLM fine-tuning.

We propose a metric called Information Parity (IP) that can predict an LLM’s capabilities across multiple languages in a task-agnostic manner. IP is well-motivated from an information theoretic perspective: it is associated with the LLM’s efficiency of compressing the text in a given language compared to a reference language. We evaluate IP and other popular metrics such as Tokenization Parity (TP) and Tokenizer Fertility (TF) on several variants of open-sourced LLMs (Llama2, Gemma, Mistral). Among all metrics known to us, IP is better correlated with existing task-specific benchmark scores from the literature and thus better predicts such scores in a certain language. These findings show that IP may be useful for ranking multilingual LLMs’ capabilities regardless of the downstream task. | Alexander Tsvetkov, Alon Kipnis |  |

However, model editing is challenging as it might also affect knowledge that is unrelated to the new data. State-of-the-art methods identify parameters associated with specific knowledge and then modify them via direct weight updates. However, these locate-and-edit methods suffer from heavy computational overhead and lack theoretical validation. In contrast, directly fine-tuning the model on requested edits affects the model’s behavior on unrelated knowledge, and significantly damages the model’s generation fluency and consistency. To address these challenges, we propose SAUL, a streamlined model editing method that uses sentence concatenation with augmented random facts for generation regularization. Evaluations on three model editing benchmarks show that is a practical and reliable solution for model editing outperforming state-of-the-art methods while maintaining generation quality and... | Mingyang Wang, Lukas Lange, Heike Adel, Jannik Strötgen, Hinrich Schütze |  |

Central to this ecosystem is its mathematical library, mathlib4, which lays the groundwork for the formalization of an expanding range of mathematical theories. However, searching for theorems in mathlib4 can be challenging. To successfully search in mathlib4, users often need to be familiar with its naming conventions or documentation strings. Therefore, creating a semantic search engine that can be used easily by individuals with varying familiarity with mathlib4 is very important. In this paper, we present a semantic search engine for mathlib4 that accepts informal queries and finds the relevant theorems. We also establish a benchmark for assessing the performance of various search engines for mathlib4. | Guoxiong Gao, Haocheng Ju, Jiedong Jiang, Zihan Qin, Bin Dong |  |

Their knowledge is then commonly evaluated using static benchmarks. However, factual knowledge is generally subject to time-sensitive changes, and static benchmarks cannot address those cases. We present an approach to dynamically evaluate the knowledge in LLMs and their time-sensitiveness against Wikidata, a publicly available up-to-date knowledge graph. We evaluate the time-sensitive knowledge in twenty-four private and open-source LLMs, as well as the effectiveness of four editing methods in updating the outdated facts. Our results show that 1) outdatedness is a critical problem across state-of-the-art LLMs; 2) LLMs output inconsistent answers when prompted with slight variations of the question prompt; and 3) the performance of the state-of-the-art knowledge editing algorithms is very limited, as they can not reduce the cases of outdatedness and output inconsistency. | Seyed Mahed Mousavi, Simone Alghisi, Giuseppe Riccardi |  |

However, existing RL methods tend to mainly focus on generation tasks, such as dialogue policy learning (DPL) or response generation (RG), while neglecting dialogue state tracking (DST) for understanding. This narrow focus limits the systems to achieve globally optimal performance by overlooking the interdependence between understanding and generation. Additionally, RL methods face challenges with sparse and delayed rewards, which complicates training and optimization. To address these issues, we extend RL into both understanding and generation tasks by introducing step-by-step rewards throughout the token generation. The understanding reward increases as more slots are correctly filled in DST, while the generation reward grows with the accurate inclusion of user requests. Our approach provides a balanced optimization aligned with task completion. Experimental results demonstrate that... | Huifang Du, Shuqin Li, Minghao Wu, Xuejing Feng, YuanFang Li, Haofen Wang |  |

A third LLM acts as a remediator agent to rewrite utterances violating norms for improving negotiation outcomes.We introduce a simple tuning-free and label-free In-Context Learning (ICL) method to identify high-quality ICL exemplars for the remediator, where we propose a novel select criteria, called value impact, to measure the quality of the negotiation outcomes. We provide rich empirical evidence to demonstrate its effectiveness in negotiations across three different negotiation topics.

In particular, large language models (LLMs) can hardly produce written works at the level of human experts due to the extremely high complexity of literature writing. In this paper, we present HoLLMwood, an automated framework for unleashing the creativity of LLMs and exploring their potential in screenwriting, which is a highly demanding task. Mimicking the human creative process, we assign LLMs to different roles involved in the real-world scenario. In addition to the common practice of treating LLMs as Writer, we also apply LLMs as Editor, who is responsible for providing feedback and revision advice to Writer. Besides, to enrich the characters and deepen the plots, we introduce a role-playing mechanism and adopt LLMs as Actors that can communicate and interact with each other.

LLMs have shown remarkable performance in NLP tasks such as relation extraction (RE) and knowledge graph completion (KGC), enhancing activities related to knowledge graphs. As a result, there is a growing interest in integrating LLMs into cross-lingual entity alignment (EA) task, which aims to identify equivalent entities across various knowledge graphs, thereby improving the performance of current baselines. However, employing LLMs for entity alignment poses challenges in efficiently handling large-scale data, generating suitable data samples, and adapting prompts for the EA task. To tackle these challenges, we propose Seg-Align, an innovative framework that integrating distance feature extraction, sample \*\*Seg\*\*mentation, and zero-shot prompts.

Inspired by causal discovery,we propose a novel deep latent model in the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework, which not only captures the underlying latent structures of data but also utilizes the easily transferable knowledge of emotions as the bridge to link the distributions of events in different domains. To facilitate knowledge transfer across domains, we also propose a novel variational posterior regularization technique to disentangle the latent representations of emotions from those of events in order to mitigate the damage caused by the spurious correlations related to the events in source domains.

Accurately estimating question difficulty based on the ability of the student group is essential for personalized question recommendations. Several studies have focused on predicting question difficulty using student question-solving records or textual information about the questions. However, these approaches require a large amount of student question-solving records and fail to account for the subjective difficulties perceived by different student groups. To address these limitations, we propose the LLaSA framework that utilizes large language models to represent students at various levels. Our proposed method, LLaSA and the zero-shot LLaSA, can estimate question difficulty both with and without students’ question-solving records. In evaluations on the DBE-KT22 and ASSISTMents 2005–2006 benchmarks, the zero-shot LLaSA demonstrated a performance comparable to those of strong... | JaeWoo Park, SeongJin Park, HyunSik Won, KangMin Kim |  |

In this paper, we introduce Inverse-Q\*, an innovative framework that transcends traditional RL methods by optimizing token-level reinforcement learning without the need for additional reward or value models. Inverse-Q\* leverages direct preference optimization techniques but extends them by estimating the conditionally optimal policy directly from the model’s responses, facilitating more granular and flexible policy shaping. Our approach reduces reliance on human annotation and external supervision, making it especially suitable for low-resource settings. We present extensive experimental results demonstrating that Inverse-Q\* not only matches but potentially exceeds the... | Han Xia, Songyang Gao, Qiming Ge, Zhiheng Xi, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang |  |

We argue that successfully intervening on a model is a prerequisite for interpreting its internal workings. Concretely, we establish a three-term objective: a successful intervention should flip the correct with the wrong token and vice versa (effectiveness), and leave other tokens unaffected (faithfulness), all while being sparse (minimality). Using gradient-based optimization, this objective lets us learn (and later evaluate) a specific kind of efficient and interpretable intervention: activation scaling only modifies the signed magnitude of activation vectors to strengthen, weaken, or reverse the steering directions already encoded in the model. On synthetic tasks, this intervention performs comparably with steering vectors in terms of effectiveness and faithfulness, but is... | Niklas Stoehr, Kevin Du, Vésteinn Snæbjarnarson, Robert West, Ryan Cotterell, Aaron Schein |  |

Unlike conventional LoRA, our method requires significantly larger ranks comparable to the pretrained weights to accommodate the complexities of speech-text cross-modality learning. The approach utilizes HuBERT to convert speech into discrete tokens and fine-tunes the pretrained LLM to adapt to cross-modal inputs and outputs. The work employs a Hi-Fi GAN vocoder to synthesize speech waveforms from the generated speech units. The initial studies use the Librispeech corpus to teach the model the relationships between speech and text, and Daily Talk, which involves dialog conversations, to adapt for interaction. The proposed work demonstrates adaptation for spoken and text conversations. However, the proposed framework can be easily extended to other cross-modal... | Zuhair Hasan Shaik, Pradyoth Hegde, Prashant Bannulmath, Deepak K. T. |  |

Closing the performance gap between small open-source models and large proprietary models is crucial to mitigate this reliance. To this end, we introduce a novel two-stage fine-tuning approach that decomposes the task into two simpler tasks. Through comprehensive evaluation on three large cross-domain datasets and two small LLMs, we show that this approach improves execution accuracy by 3 to 7 percent, effectively aligning the performance of open-source models with their proprietary counterparts. Our proposed method has achieved 60.31% execution accuracy on Bird hold-out test set, which is the highest performance among methods using 7B parameter models. | Mohammadreza Pourreza, Davood Rafiei |  |

Medical data and tasks, which vary in format, size, and other parameters, require extensive preprocessing and standardization for effective use in training LLMs. To address these challenges, we introduce MedINST, the Meta Dataset of Biomedical Instructions, a novel multi-domain, multi-task instructional meta-dataset. MedINST comprises 133 biomedical NLP tasks and over 7 million training samples, making it the most comprehensive biomedical instruction dataset to date. Using MedINST as the meta dataset, we curate MedINST32, a challenging benchmark with different task difficulties aiming to evaluate LLMs’ generalization ability. We fine-tune several LLMs on MedINST and evaluate on MedINST32, showcasing enhanced cross-task generalization. | Wenhan Han, Meng Fang, Zihan Zhang, Yu Yin, Zirui Song, Ling Chen, Mykola Pechenizkiy, Qingyu Chen |  |

This type of method leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate the source code for an executable computer program that solves a given problem. This strategy has the advantage of offering an interpretable reasoning path and does not require finetuning a model with task-specific data. We propose PropTest, a general strategy that improves visual programming by further using an LLM to generate code that tests for visual properties in an initial round of proposed solutions. Our method generates tests for data-type consistency, output syntax, and semantic properties. PropTest achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art methods while using publicly available LLMs. This is demonstrated across different benchmarks on visual question answering and referring expression comprehension. Particularly, PropTest improves ViperGPT by obtaining 46.1% accuracy (+6.0%) on GQA using... | Jaywon Koo, Ziyan Yang, Paola CascanteBonilla, Baishakhi Ray, Vicente Ordonez |  |

This highlights the urgent need to understand how fairness mechanisms can be exploited and to develop defenses that ensure both fairness and robustness. We introduce \*BadFair\*, a novel backdoored fairness attack methodology. BadFair stealthily crafts a model that operates with accuracy and fairness under regular conditions but, when activated by certain triggers, discriminates and produces incorrect results for specific groups. This type of attack is particularly stealthy and dangerous, as it circumvents existing fairness detection methods, maintaining an appearance... | Jiaqi Xue, Qian Lou, Mengxin Zheng |  |

Exploring Vision-Language Models' Capability in Reproducing Academic Charts](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.findings-emnlp.485) |  | 0 | While effective data visualization is crucial to present complex information in academic research, its creation demands significant expertise in both data management and graphic design. We explore the potential of using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in automating the creation of data visualizations by generating code templates from existing charts. As the first work to systematically investigate this task, we first introduce AcademiaChart, a dataset comprising 2525 high-resolution data visualization figures with captions from a variety of AI conferences, extracted directly from source codes. We then conduct large-scale experiments with six state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLMs, including both closed-source and open-source models. Our findings reveal that SOTA closed-source VLMs can indeed be helpful in reproducing charts. On the contrary, open-source ones are only effective at reproducing much simpler charts but struggle with more complex ones. Interestingly, the application of... | Zhehao Zhang, Weicheng Ma, Soroush Vosoughi |  |

These diverse modalities capture the state of firms from a variety of different perspectives but requires complex interactions to reconcile in the formation of accurate financial predictions. The commonality between these different modalities is that they all represent a time series, typically observed for a particular firm at a quarterly horizon, providing the ability to model trends and variations of company data over time. However, the time series of these diverse modalities contains varying temporal and cross-channel patterns that are challenging to model without the appropriate inductive biases. In this work, we design a novel multimodal time series prediction task that includes numerical financial results, macroeconomic states, and long financial documents to predict next quarter’s company earnings... | Ross Koval, Nicholas Andrews, Xifeng Yan |  |

Recent works seek to leverage LLMs on knowledge-based visual question answering (VQA) tasks which require common sense knowledge to answer the question about an image, since LLMs have obtained rich knowledge from large-scale training. Several methods have proposed to leverage frozen LLMs by converting visual information to textual prompts. However, how to efficiently exploit the knowledge of LLMs and bridge the disconnects between visual information and language models remain open problems. In this paper, we propose to let LLMs learn to ask (L2A) informative questions to collect essential visual information. We introduce the concepts of denotation and connotation to promote image and question understanding and provide a clear guidance with respect to the objective of question generation. In this way, the model can better capture the associations between different... | Xiaoying Xing, Peixi Xiong, Lei Fan, Yunxuan Li, Ying Wu |  |

A number of strategies for this problem have already been considered in the literature. Little is known about the relative performance of these strategies, however, as they have thus far been evaluated on different ontologies. Moreover, existing evaluations have focused on distinguishing held-out ontology rules from randomly corrupted ones, which often makes the task unrealistically easy and leads to the presence of incorrectly labelled negative examples. To address these concerns, we introduce a benchmark with manually annotated hard negatives and use this benchmark to evaluate ontology completion models. In addition to previously proposed models, we test the effectiveness of several approaches that have not yet been considered for this task, including LLMs and simple but effective hybrid strategies. | Na Li, Thomas Bailleux, Zied Bouraoui, Steven Schockaert |  |

However, there is still a lack of theoretical understanding of how RLHF works, the conditions under which it succeeds or fails, and whether it guarantees optimization of both likelihood 𝛽(⋅) and reward R(⋅) objectives. To address these issues, we consider RLHF as a bi-objective problem that has the nature of a Pareto optimization, present a Pareto improvement condition that is necessary to obtain Pareto-efficient policies, and propose a simple yet powerful method named reward dropout that guarantees a Pareto improvement. To demonstrate the performance of reward dropout, two benchmark datasets commonly used in text style transfer tasks were utilized in our study: sentiment and topic datasets sourced from Yelp and AG_News, respectively. Our experiments highlight that paying attention to a few samples with... | Changhun Lee, Chiehyeon Lim |  |

Weak-to-strong learning, where a less capable model enhances a stronger one, proves valuable in this context. Yet, the efficacy of this paradigm for complex reasoning tasks is still unexplored. In this paper, we introduce a progressive weak-to-strong reasoning framework that enables the strong model to autonomously refine its training data, maximizing the use of weak signals and unlocking its latent abilities. This framework begins with supervised fine-tuning on a selective small but high-quality dataset, followed by preference optimization on contrastive samples identified by the strong model itself. Experiments on the GSM8K and MATH datasets verify that our method can effectively improve the reasoning capabilities of Llama2-70b using three separate weak models. This work paves the way for a more scalable and sophisticated strategy to enhance AI reasoning powers. All relevant... | Yuqing Yang, Yan Ma, Pengfei Liu |  |

Traditional differential privacy based training approaches offer robust safeguards by employing a uniform noise distribution across all parameters. However, this overlooks the distinct sensitivities and contributions of individual parameters in privacy protection and often results in suboptimal models. To address these limitations, we propose ANADP, a novel algorithm that adaptively allocates additive noise based on the importance of model parameters. We demonstrate that ANADP narrows the performance gap between regular fine-tuning and traditional DP fine-tuning on a series of datasets while maintaining the required privacy constraints. | Xianzhi Li, Ran Zmigrod, Zhiqiang Ma, Xiaomo Liu, Xiaodan Zhu |  |

In this work, we introduce a Compositional Generalization Challenge for Graph-based Commonsense Reasoning (CGGC) that goes beyond previous evaluations that are based on sequences or tree structures – and instead involves a reasoning graph: It requires models to generate a natural sentence based on given concepts and a corresponding reasoning graph, where the presented graph involves a previously unseen combination of relation types. To master this challenge, models need to learn how to reason over relation tupels within the graph, and how to compose them when conceptualizing a verbalization. We evaluate seven well-known LLMs using in-context learning and find that performant LLMs still struggle in compositional generalization. We investigate potential causes of this gap by analyzing the structures of reasoning graphs, and find that different... | Xiyan Fu, Anette Frank |  |

While some benchmarks have been developed to investigate LVLM hallucinations, they often rely on hand-crafted corner cases whose failure patterns may not generalize well. Additionally, fine-tuning on these examples could undermine their validity. To address this, we aim to scale up the number of cases through an automated approach, reducing human bias in crafting such corner cases. This motivates the development of AutoHallusion, the first automated benchmark generation approach that employs several key strategies to create a diverse range of hallucination examples. Our generated visual-question pairs pose significant challenges to LVLMs, requiring them to overcome contextual biases and distractions to arrive at correct answers. AutoHallusion enables us to... | Xiyang Wu, Tianrui Guan, Dianqi Li, Shuaiyi Huang, Xiaoyu Liu, Xijun Wang, Ruiqi Xian, Abhinav Shrivastava, Furong Huang, Jordan L.

To bridge the gap, we introduce on-demand keyphrase generation, a novel paradigm that requires keyphrases that conform to specific high-level goals or intents. For this task, we present MetaKP, a large-scale benchmark comprising four datasets, 7500 documents, and 3760 goals across news and biomedical domains with human-annotated keyphrases. Leveraging MetaKP, we design both supervised and unsupervised methods, including a multi-task fine-tuning approach and a self-consistency prompting method with large language models. The results highlight the challenges of supervised fine-tuning, whose performance is not robust to distribution shifts. By contrast, the proposed self-consistency prompting approach greatly improves the performance of large language models, enabling GPT-4o to achieve 0.548 SemF1, surpassing the performance... | Di Wu, Xiaoxian Shen, KaiWei Chang |  |

However, previous text style transfer primarily focused on sentence-level data-driven approaches, limiting exploration of potential problems in large language models (LLMs) and the ability to meet complex application needs. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel task called Public-Speaking Style Transfer (PSST), which aims to simulate humans to transform passage-level, official texts into a public-speaking style. Grounded in the analysis of real-world data from a linguistic perspective, we decompose public-speaking style into key sub-styles to pose challenges and quantify the style modeling capability of LLMs. For such intricate text style transfer, we further propose a fine-grained evaluation framework to analyze the characteristics and identify the problems of stylized texts. Comprehensive experiments suggest that current LLMs struggle to generate public speaking... | Huashan Sun, Yixiao Wu, Yizhe Yang, Yinghao Li, Jiawei Li, Yuhao Ye, Yang Gao |  |

However, the imperfections of the retrievers in RAG models often result in the retrieval of irrelevant information, which could introduce noise and degrade the performance, especially when handling multi-hop questions that require multiple steps of reasoning. To enhance the multi-hop reasoning ability of RAG models, we propose TRACE. TRACE constructs knowledge-grounded reasoning chains, which are a series of logically connected knowledge triples, to identify and integrate supporting evidence from the retrieved documents for answering questions. Specifically, TRACE employs a KG Generator to create a knowledge graph (KG) from the retrieved documents, and then uses a novel Autoregressive Reasoning Chain Constructor to build reasoning chains. Experimental results on three multi-hop QA datasets show that TRACE achieves an average performance improvement of up to 14.03% compared... | Jinyuan Fang, Zaiqiao Meng, Craig MacDonald |  |

However, owing to the curved nature of generation path, they necessitate traversing numerous steps to guarantee the text quality. In this paper, we propose an efficient model FMSeq, which utilizes flow matching to straighten the generation path, thereby enabling fast sampling for diffusion-based seq2seq text generation. Specifically, we construct transport flow only on the target sequences to adapt the diffusion-based model with flow matching. Furthermore, we explore different settings and identify target-parameterization, self-conditioning and time-difference as three effective techniques to improve the generation quality under a few steps. Experiments on four popular tasks demonstrate that FMSeq generates texts of comparable quality to the SOTA diffusion-based DiffuSeq in just 10 steps, achieving a 200-fold speedup. | Pan Liu, Xiaohua Tian, Zhouhan Lin |  |

While these PLMs excel in automatic evaluations, they frequently underperform in human evaluations, indicating a deviation between their generated summaries and human summarization preferences. This discrepancy is likely due to the low quality of fine-tuning datasets and the limited availability of high-quality human-annotated data that reflect true human preference. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel human summarization preference alignment framework AlignSum. This framework consists of three parts: Firstly, we construct a Data Pymarid with extractive, abstractive, and human-annotated summary data. Secondly, we conduct the Gaussian Resampling to remove summaries with extreme lengths. Finally, we implement the two-stage hierarchical fine-tuning with Data Pymarid after Gaussian Resampling. We apply AlignSum to PLMs on the human-annotated CNN/DailyMail and BBC XSum... | Yang Han, Yiming Wang, Rui Wang, Lu Chen, Kai Yu |  |

While prior work has simplified characters via graph-based methods and brief character descriptions, we aim to better tackle the problem of representing complex characters by taking inspiration from advice given to professional writers. We propose CHIRON, a new ‘character sheet’ based representation that organizes and filters textual information about characters. We construct CHIRON sheets in two steps: a Generation Module that prompts an LLM for character information via question-answering and a Validation Module that uses automated reasoning and a domain-specific entailment model to eliminate false facts about a character. We validate CHIRON via the downstream task of masked-character prediction, where our experiments show CHIRON is better and more flexible than comparable summary-based baselines. We also show that metrics derived from CHIRON can be used to... | Alexander Gurung, Mirella Lapata |  |

Existing methods typically construct a uniform embedding space for cross-modal alignment and leverage abundant visual image data to indirectly understand infrared images. However, they ignore the supervisory signals of infrared-modality-specific attributes, which may lead to biased understanding of infrared images. To address this issue, we propose a debating multi-agent generation system which transfers knowledge from visible images to generate infrared image-text pairs and infrared instruction data. Moreover, we construct an infrared question-answering benchmark based on common infrared tasks. Experimental results from incremental fine-tuning on existing models and our Infrared-LLaVA-7B trained from scratch on infrared data demonstrate the effectiveness of the generated data and the... | Shixin Jiang, Zerui Chen, Jiafeng Liang, Yanyan Zhao, Ming Liu, Bing Qin |  |

Recently, Zero-shot NAS has emerged as a promising approach by exploiting Zero-cost (ZC) proxies, which markedly reduce computational demands. Despite this, existing ZC proxies heavily rely on expert knowledge and incur significant trial-and-error costs. Particularly in NLP tasks, most existing ZC proxies fail to surpass the performance of the naive baseline. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework, LPZero, which is the first to automatically design zero-cost (ZC) proxies for various tasks, achieving higher ranking consistency than human-designed proxies. Specifically, we model the ZC proxy as a symbolic equation and incorporate a unified proxy search space that encompasses existing ZC proxies, which are composed of a predefined set of mathematical symbols. To heuristically search for the best ZC proxy, LPZero incorporates genetic programming to find the... | Peijie Dong, Lujun Li, Xiang Liu, Zhenheng Tang, Xuebo Liu, Qiang Wang, Xiaowen Chu |  |

Investigating Phrasal Semantics in Large Language Models](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.findings-emnlp.503) |  | 0 | Phrases are fundamental linguistic units through which humans convey semantics. This study critically examines the capacity of API-based large language models (LLMs) to comprehend phrase semantics, utilizing three human-annotated datasets. We assess the performance of LLMs in executing phrase semantic reasoning tasks guided by natural language instructions and explore the impact of common prompting techniques, including few-shot demonstrations and Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Our findings reveal that LLMs greatly outperform traditional embedding methods across the datasets; however, they do not show a significant advantage over fine-tuned methods. The effectiveness of advanced prompting strategies shows variability. We conduct detailed error analyses to interpret the limitations faced by LLMs in comprehending phrase semantics. Code and data can be found at https://github.com/memray/llm_phrase_semantics/. | Rui Meng, Ye Liu, Lifu Tu, Daqing He, Yingbo Zhou, Semih Yavuz |  |

Exploring the State of In-Context Alignment](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.findings-emnlp.504) |  | 0 | Recent studies have demonstrated that In-Context Learning (ICL), through the use of specific demonstrations, can align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences known as In-Context Alignment (ICA), indicating that models can comprehend human instructions without requiring parameter adjustments. However, the exploration of the mechanism and applicability of ICA remains limited. In this paper, we begin by dividing the context text used in ICA into three categories: format, system prompt, and example. Through ablation experiments, we investigate the effectiveness of each part in enabling ICA to function effectively. We then examine how variants in these parts impact the model’s alignment performance. Our findings indicate that the example part is crucial for enhancing the model’s alignment capabilities, with changes in examples significantly affecting alignment performance. We also conduct a comprehensive evaluation of ICA’s zero-shot capabilities in various alignment tasks.... | Heyan Huang, Yinghao Li, Huashan Sun, Yu Bai, Yang Gao |  |

To date, the interpretability of FLMs has primarily relied on the attention weights in their self-attention layers. However, these attention weights only provide word-level interpretations, failing to capture higher-level structures, and are therefore lacking in readability and intuitiveness. To address this challenge, we first provide a formal definition of \*conceptual interpretation\* and then propose a variational Bayesian framework, dubbed VAriational Language Concept (VALC), to go beyond word-level interpretations and provide concept-level interpretations. Our theoretical analysis shows that our VALC finds the optimal language concepts to interpret FLM predictions. Empirical results on several real-world datasets show that our method can successfully provide conceptual interpretation for FLMs. | Hengyi Wang, Shiwei Tan, Zhiqing Hong, Desheng Zhang, Hao Wang |  |

To address the limitations of current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in understanding this type of data, we create a novel dataset named YManga from the Internet. After filtering out low-quality content, we collect a dataset of 1,015 yonkoma strips, containing 10,150 human annotations. We then define three challenging tasks for this dataset: panel sequence detection, generation of the author’s creative intention, and description generation for masked panels. These tasks progressively introduce the complexity of understanding and utilizing such image-text data. To the best of our knowledge, YManga is the first dataset specifically designed for yonkoma manga strips understanding. Extensive experiments conducted on this dataset reveal significant challenges faced by current multimodal large language models. Our results show... | Qi Yang, Jingjie Zeng, Liang Yang, Zhihao Yang, Hongfei Lin |  |

However, this CT-then-SFT approach struggles with limited data in the context of low-resource languages, failing to balance language modeling and task-solving capabilities. We thus propose a new model merging solution as an alternative for low-resource languages, combining models with distinct capabilities into a single model without additional training. We use model merging to develop task-solving LLMs for low-resource languages without SFT data in the target languages. Our experiments based on Llama-2-7B demonstrate that model merging effectively endows LLMs for low-resource languages with task-solving abilities, outperforming CT-then-SFT in scenarios with extremely scarce data. Observing performance saturation in model merging with increasingly more training tokens, we further analyze the merging process and introduce a slack variable to... | Mingxu Tao, Chen Zhang, Quzhe Huang, Tianyao Ma, Songfang Huang, Dongyan Zhao, Yansong Feng |  |

Training-based methods, such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO), require substantial resources and are impractical for API-based LLMs. Post-processing methods decouple alignment from training but may incur high multiple-time inference costs or rely on less knowledgeable lightweight models for response refinement. In this paper, we propose a new LLM alignment paradigm from the perspective of pre-processing. By reformulating risky queries into highly relevant yet harmless ones before feeding them into LLMs, our method eliminates the high costs of training base LLMs, efficiently applies to both open-source and proprietary LLMs, and achieves a promising balance of harmlessness and helpfulness. For example, with Vicuna-7B as the LLM to align, it enhances helpfulness by 28.52% over DPO while maintaining comparable harmlessness levels.... | Wenjin Yao, Yidong Wang, Zhuohao Yu, Rui Xie, Shikun Zhang, Wei Ye |  |

Recently, LLM-based agents have been developed to address these challenges by selecting appropriate specialized models as tools based on user inputs. However, such advancements have not been extensively explored within the medical domain. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces the first agent explicitly designed for the medical field, named Multi-modal Medical Agent (MMedAgent). We curate an instruction-tuning dataset comprising six medical tools solving seven tasks across five modalities, enabling the agent to choose the most suitable tools for a given task. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MMedAgent achieves superior performance across a variety of medical tasks compared to state-of-the-art open-source methods and even the closed-source model, GPT-4o. Furthermore, MMedAgent exhibits efficiency in updating and... | Binxu Li, Tiankai Yan, Yuanting Pan, Jie Luo, Ruiyang Ji, Jiayuan Ding, Zhe Xu, Shilong Liu, Haoyu Dong, Zihao Lin, Yixin Wang |  |

The current TKGR models are mainly based on graph neural networks or tensor decomposition techniques. Few works in TKGR focus on pre-trained language models (PLMs) which have powerful sequence modeling capabilities to capture the temporal associations between facts. In this paper, we propose a model SALMON: a Structure-Aware Language Model with logicality and densification strategy. Specifically, we design a PLM-based framework with a structure-aware layer inside to jointly capture the temporal evolving pattern and structural information in TKGs. To further enhance the model’s ability to infer causal associations of facts, we propose a logical judging module, which can guide the model to prioritize learning the most relevant evolving information of logical causal associations in TKGs during the... | Fu Zhang, Jinghao Lin, Jingwei Cheng |  |

These cognitive-behavioral traits include typically Attitudes, Opinions, Values (AOVs). However, measuring AOVs embedded within LLMs remains opaque, and different evaluation methods may yield different results. This has led to a lack of clarity on how different studies are related to each other and how they can be interpreted. This paper aims to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive overview of recent works on the evaluation of AOVs in LLMs. Moreover, we survey related approaches in different stages of the evaluation pipeline in these works. By doing so, we address the potential and challenges with respect to understanding the model, human-AI alignment, and downstream application in social sciences. Finally, we provide practical insights into evaluation methods, model enhancement, and interdisciplinary... | Bolei Ma, Xinpeng Wang, Tiancheng Hu, AnnaCarolina Haensch, Michael A.

We evaluate it on the Low-Resource Machine Translation task, using the datasets of South East Asian and Finno-Ugric languages. In addition to its effectiveness, MeritOpt is also highly interpretable, as it can be applied to track the impact of each language used for training. Our analysis reveals that target dataset size affects weight distribution across auxiliary languages, that unrelated languages do not interfere with the training, and auxiliary optimizer parameters have minimal impact. Our approach is easy to apply with a few lines of code, and we provide scripts for reproducing the experiments (https://github.com/VityaVitalich/MeritOpt). | Viktor Moskvoretskii, Nazarii Tupitsa, Chris Biemann, Samuel Horváth, Eduard Gorbunov, Irina Nikishina |  |

Here, we study their performance in detecting convincing arguments to gain insights into LLMs’ persuasive capabilities without directly engaging in experimentation with humans. We extend a dataset by Durmus and Cardie (2018) with debates, votes, and user traits and propose tasks measuring LLMs’ ability to (1) distinguish between strong and weak arguments, (2) predict stances based on beliefs and demographic characteristics, and (3) determine the appeal of an argument to an individual based on their traits. We show that LLMs perform on par with humans in these tasks and that combining predictions from different LLMs yields significant performance gains, surpassing human performance. The data and code released with this paper contribute to the crucial effort of continuously evaluating and monitoring LLMs’ capabilities and potential impact.... | Paula Rescala, Manoel Horta Ribeiro, Tiancheng Hu, Robert West |  |

We present Knowledge Navigator, a system designed to enhance exploratory search abilities by organizing and structuring the retrieved documents from broad topical queries into a navigable, two-level hierarchy of named and descriptive scientific topics and subtopics. This structured organization provides an overall view of the research themes in a domain, while also enabling iterative search and deeper knowledge discovery within specific subtopics by allowing users to refine their focus and retrieve additional relevant documents. Knowledge Navigator combines LLM capabilities with cluster-based methods to enable an effective browsing method. We demonstrate our approach’s effectiveness through automatic and manual evaluations on two novel benchmarks, CLUSTREC-COVID and SCITOC Our code, prompts, and benchmarks are made publicly available. | Uri Katz, Mosh Levy, Yoav Goldberg |  |

The default approach of segmenting text into sentences is often insufficient, especially since sentences are usually complex enough to include multiple units of meaning that merit separate treatment in the downstream task. We focus on the task of abstractive proposition segmentation (APS): transforming text into simple, self-contained, well-formed sentences. Several recent works have demonstrated the utility of proposition segmentation with few-shot prompted LLMs for downstream tasks such as retrieval-augmented grounding and fact verification. However, this approach does not scale to large amounts of text and may not always extract all the facts from the input text.In this paper, we first introduce evaluation metrics for the task to measure several dimensions of quality.We then propose a scalable, yet accurate, proposition segmentation model. We model proposition segmentation as a... | Mohammad Javad Hosseini, Yang Gao, Tim Baumgärtner, Alex Fabrikant, Reinald Kim Amplayo |  |

Prevalent methods simultaneously train additional modules (i.e., one task-shared module and multiple task-specific modules) for adapting PLMs to downstream tasks. However, their adaptability to new tasks is constrained, as the task-specific modules independently adapt to each task, overlooking the potential for knowledge transfer across tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task learning framework, Inspirational Pointer (IP), that enables the transfer of prior knowledge across tasks through human language intervention. Specifically, we attach task descriptions to the input samples, which are then mapped to corresponding task embeddings. Based on those embeddings, we adapt PLMs for downstream tasks. Similar tasks share akin descriptions, allowing new task samples close to similar trained tasks in the task embedding... | Wenxuan Lu, Songhao Jiang, Yijing Wang, Tianning Zang |  |

Researchers typically address these issues by retrieving related knowledge from knowledge graphs or employing self-enhancement methods to elicit knowledge in LLMs. However, noisy knowledge and invalid reasoning issues hamper their ability to answer questions accurately. To this end, we propose a novel method named eliciting, filtering and integrating knowledge in large language model (LINKED). In it, we design a reward model to filter out the noisy knowledge and take the marginal consistent reasoning module to reduce invalid reasoning. With our comprehensive experiments on two complex commonsense reasoning benchmarks, our method outperforms SOTA baselines (up to 9.0% improvement of accuracy). Besides, to measure the positive and negative impact of the injected knowledge, we propose a new metric called effectiveness-preservation score for the knowledge... | Jiachun Li, Pengfei Cao, Chenhao Wang, Zhuoran Jin, Yubo Chen, Kang Liu, Xiaojian Jiang, Jiexin Xu, Jun Zhao |  |

Our proposed method, using counterfactual intervention assisted by Large Language Models (LLMs), reveals that BERT-like models primarily focus on sentence-level features, whereas LLMs such as GPT-3.5, GPT-4 and Llama-3 are sensitive to conventions & accuracy, language complexity, and organization, indicating a more comprehensive rationale alignment with scoring rubrics. Moreover, LLMs can discern counterfactual interventions when giving feedback on essays. Our approach improves understanding of neural AES methods and can also apply to other domains seeking transparency in model-driven decisions. | Yupei Wang, Renfen Hu, Zhe Zhao |  |

The standard process for iterative alignment of LLMs involves collecting new human feedback for each update. However, the data collection process is costly and challenging to scale. To address this issue, we introduce the “TS-Align” framework, which fine-tunes a policy model using pairwise feedback data automatically mined from its outputs. This automatic mining process is efficiently accomplished through the collaboration between a large-scale teacher model and a small-scale student model. The policy fine-tuning process can be iteratively repeated using on-policy generations within our proposed teacher-student collaborative framework. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our final aligned policy outperforms the base policy model with an average win rate of 69.7% across seven conversational or instruction-following... | Chen Zhang, Chengguang Tang, Dading Chong, Ke Shi, Guohua Tang, Feng Jiang, Haizhou Li |  |

Most advancements in AS2 focus on English due to the scarcity of annotated datasets for other languages. This lack of resources prevents the training of effective AS2 models in different languages, creating a performance gap between QA systems in English and other locales. In this paper, we introduce new high-quality datasets for AS2 in five European languages (French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish), obtained through supervised Automatic Machine Translation (AMT) of existing English AS2 datasets such as ASNQ, WikiQA, and TREC-QA using a Large Language Model (LLM). We evaluated our approach and the quality of the translated datasets through multiple experiments with different Transformer architectures.

Active Learning, selecting a few informative instances for annotation and model training, sheds light on solving these issues. However, only few active learning-based studies focus on abstractive text summarization and suffer from low stability, effectiveness, and efficiency. To solve the problems, we propose a novel LLM-determined curriculum active learning framework. Firstly, we design a prompt to ask large language models to rate the difficulty of instances, which guides the model to train on from easier to harder instances. Secondly, we design a novel active learning strategy, i.e., Certainty Gain Maximization, enabling to select instances whose distribution aligns well with the overall distribution. Experiments show our method can improve stability, effectiveness, and efficiency of abstractive text summarization backbones. | Dongyuan Li, Ying Zhang, Zhen Wang, Shiyin Tan, Satoshi Kosugi, Manabu Okumura |  |

Typically, KGQA initially retrieve a targeted subgraph from a large-scale knowledge graph, which serves as the basis for reasoning models to address queries. However, the retrieved subgraph inevitably brings distraction information for knowledge utilization, impeding the model’s ability to perform accurate reasoning. To address this issue, we propose a Question-guided Knowledge Graph Re-scoring method (Q-KGR) to eliminate noisy pathways for the input question, thereby focusing specifically on pertinent factual knowledge.Moreover, we introduce Knowformer, a parameter-efficient method for injecting the re-scored knowledge graph into large language models to enhance their ability to perform factual reasoning.Extensive experiments on multiple KGQA benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing systems. | Yu Zhang, Kehai Chen, Xuefeng Bai, Zhao Kang, Quanjiang Guo, Min Zhang |  |

To further explore the potential of contrastive decoding, we introduce the Contrastive Tuning and Decoding (CTD) framework, which enhances model performance without requiring additional data or significant computational resources.When performing Contrastive Tuning, we optimize a correction model by targeting discrepancies between the original outputs and labels. During Contrastive Decoding, the correction model adjusts the logits of the SFT model using the same input to ensure better adherence to instructions.With the lightweight CTD framework, we refine the behavior of instruction-tuned models, improving their performance on the challenging SUPNATINST dataset with unfamiliar data... | Zhimeng Wang, Pinzheng Wang, Juntao Li, Yibin Chen, Min Zhang |  |

While previous approaches focused on processing retrieved passages to remove irrelevant context, they still rely heavily on the quality of retrieved passages which can degrade if the question is ambiguous or complex. In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient method called question and passage augmentation (QPaug) via LLMs for open-domain QA. QPaug first decomposes the original questions into multiple-step sub-questions. By augmenting the original question with detailed sub-questions and planning, we are able to make the query more specific on what needs to be retrieved, improving the retrieval performance. In addition, to compensate for the case where the retrieved passages contain distracting information or divided opinions, we augment the retrieved passages with self-generated... | Minsang Kim, Cheoneum Park, Seung Baek |  |

In this paper, we emphasize another crucial quality that it should possess, i.e., inter-report consistency, which refers to the capability of generating consistent reports for semantically equivalent radiographs. This quality is even of greater significance than the overall report accuracy in terms of ensuring the system’s credibility, as a system prone to providing conflicting results would severely erode users’ trust. Regrettably, existing approaches struggle to maintain inter-report consistency, exhibiting biases towards common patterns and susceptibility to lesion variants. To address this issue, we propose ICON, which improves the inter-report consistency of radiology report generation. Aiming to enhance the system’s ability to capture similarities in semantically equivalent lesions, our approach first involves extracting lesions from... | Wenjun Hou, Yi Cheng, Kaishuai Xu, Yan Hu, Wenjie Li, Jiang Liu |  |

Nevertheless, some of these benchmarks are not naturally generated by LLMs but are intentionally induced. Also, many merely focus on the factuality hallucination while ignoring the faithfulness hallucination. Additionally, although dialogue pattern is more widely utilized in the era of LLMs, current benchmarks only concentrate on sentence-level and passage-level hallucination. In this study, we propose DiaHalu, the first dedicated dialogue-level hallucination evaluation benchmark for LLMs to our knowledge. Initially, we integrate the collected topics into system prompts and facilitate a dialogue between two LLMs. Subsequently, we manually modify the contents that do not adhere to human language conventions and then have LLMs re-generate, simulating authentic human-machine interaction scenarios.... | Kedi Chen, Qin Chen, Jie Zhou, Yishen He, Liang He |  |

To bridge these gaps, we introduce ExpertEase, a multi-agent framework for grade-specific document simplification using Large Language Models (LLMs). ExpertEase simulates real-world text simplification by introducing expert, teacher, and student agents that cooperate on the task and rely on external tools for calibration. Experiments demonstrate that this multi-agent approach significantly enhances LLMs’ ability to simplify reading materials for diverse audiences. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of LLMs varying in size and type, and compare LLM-generated texts with human-authored ones, highlighting their potential in educational resource development and guiding future research. | Kaijie Mo, Renfen Hu |  |

Although current LLMs are achieving increasingly better performance on various benchmarks, their performance in practical applications does not always match their benchmark results. Leakage of benchmarks can prevent the accurate assessment of LLMs’ true performance. However, constructing new benchmarks is costly, labor-intensive and still carries the risk of leakage. Therefore, in this paper, we ask the question Can we reuse these leaked benchmarks for LLM evaluation? We propose Inference-Time Decontamination (ITD) to address this issue by detecting and rewriting leaked samples without altering their difficulties. ITD can mitigate performance inflation caused by memorizing leaked benchmarks. Our proof-of-concept experiments demonstrate that ITD reduces inflated accuracy by 22.9% on GSM8K and 19.0% on MMLU. On MMLU, using Inference-time Decontamination can lead to a decrease... | Qin Zhu, Qinyuan Cheng, Runyu Peng, Xiaonan Li, Ru Peng, Tengxiao Liu, Xipeng Qiu, Xuanjing Huang |  |

However, these systems have certain limitations: they require a large amount of training data, which increases costs, and often overlook prosody similarity. To address these issues, we propose MultiVerse, a zero-shot multi-task TTS system that is able to perform TTS or speech style transfer in zero-shot and cross-lingual conditions. MultiVerse requires much less training data than traditional data-driven approaches. To ensure zero-shot performance even with limited data, we leverage source-filter theory-based disentanglement, utilizing the prompt for modeling filter-related and source-related representations. Additionally, to further enhance prosody similarity, we adopt a prosody modeling approach combining prompt-based autoregressive and non-autoregressive methods. Evaluations demonstrate the remarkable zero-shot multi-task TTS performance of... | Taejun Bak, Youngsik Eom, SeungJae Choi, YoungSun Joo |  |

In this paper, we propose an innovative approach to address the challenges of topic modeling in Hadith studies by utilizing the Contextualized Topic Model (CTM). Our study introduces RoBERT2VecTM, a novel neural-based approach that combines the RoBERTa transformer model with Doc2Vec, specifically targeting the semantic analysis of “Matn” (the actual content). The methodology outperforms many traditional state-of-the-art NLP models by generating more coherent and diverse Arabic topics. The diversity of the generated topics allows for further categorization, deepening the understanding of discussed concepts. Notably, our research highlights the critical impact of lemmatization and stopwords in enhancing topic modeling. This breakthrough marks a significant stride in applying NLP to non-Latin languages and... | Sania Aftar, Luca Gagliardelli, Amina El Ganadi, Federico Ruozzi, Sonia Bergamaschi |  |

The Case of Semantic Textual Similarity](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.findings-emnlp.535) |  | 0 | While BERT produces high-quality sentence embeddings, its pre-training computational cost is a significant drawback. In contrast, ELECTRA provides a cost-effective pre-training objective and downstream task performance improvements, but worse sentence embeddings. The community tacitly stopped utilizing ELECTRA’s sentence embeddings for semantic textual similarity (STS). We notice a significant drop in performance for the ELECTRA discriminator’s last layer in comparison to prior layers. We explore this drop and propose a way to repair the embeddings using a novel truncated model fine-tuning (TMFT) method. TMFT improves the Spearman correlation coefficient by over 8 points while increasing parameter efficiency on the STS Benchmark. We extend our analysis to various model sizes, languages, and two other tasks. Further, we discover the surprising efficacy of ELECTRA’s generator model, which performs on par with BERT, using significantly fewer parameters and a substantially smaller... | Ivan Rep, David Dukic, Jan Snajder |  |

However, many existing methods struggle to decipher emotional cues in dialogues since they are insufficient in understanding the rich historical emotional context. In this work, we introduce an innovative Detective Network (DetectiveNN), a novel model that is grounded in the cognitive theory of emotion and utilizes a “recall-detect-predict” framework to imitate human emotional reasoning. This process begins by ‘recalling’ past interactions of a specific speaker to collect emotional cues. It then ‘detects’ relevant emotional patterns by interpreting these cues in the context of the ongoing conversation. Finally, it ‘predicts’ the speaker’s current emotional state. Tested on three benchmark datasets, our approach significantly outperforms existing methods. This highlights the advantages of incorporating cognitive factors... | Simin Hong, Jun Sun, Taihao Li |  |

Lately, hypergraph-based deep learning methods to learn informative data representations for the problem of node classification on text-attributed hypergraphs have garnered increasing research attention. However, existing methods struggle to simultaneously capture the full extent of hypergraph structural information and the rich linguistic attributes inherent in the nodes attributes, which largely hampers their effectiveness and generalizability. To overcome these challenges, we explore ways to further augment a pretrained BERT model with specialized hypergraph-aware layers for the task of node classification. Such layers introduce higher-order structural inductive bias into the language model, thus improving the model’s capacity to harness both higher-order context information from the hypergraph structure and semantic information present... | Adrián Bazaga, Pietro Lio, Gos Micklem |  |

However, in this pluralistic world, human preferences can be diversified due to annotators’ different tastes, which hinders the effectiveness of LLM alignment methods. This paper presents the first quantitative analysis of the experimental scaling law for reward models with varying sizes, from 1.3 billion to 7 billion parameters, trained with human feedback exhibiting diverse preferences. Our analysis reveals that the impact of diversified human preferences depends on both model size and data size. Larger models with sufficient capacity mitigate the negative effects of diverse preferences, while smaller models struggle to accommodate them. To mitigate the impact of diverse preferences, we introduce a new metric, Expected Calibration Error (ECE), to evaluate RMs and show their obvious positive correlation with the alignment performance of LLMs.... | Dun Zeng, Yong Dai, Pengyu Cheng, Longyue Wang, Tianhao Hu, Wanshun Chen, Nan Du, Zenglin Xu |  |

However, deploying LLMs on resource-limited settings remains a challenge. While early-exit techniques offer an effective approach, they often require compromised training methods that result in sub-optimal performance. On the other hand, multi-model methods achieve improved results but suffer from significant inference latency and memory consumption. In this paper, we propose LoRAExit, a novel dynamic inference architecture that leverages low-rank adaptors for efficient deployment of LLMs. LoRAExit decouples the training of multiple exit interfaces, enabling the separate optimization of each exit, thereby fundamentally addressing the performance issues of early-exit networks. Moreover, we introduce a superior-exit guided distillation method that effectively utilizes models of different sizes, thereby further enhancing the performance of early exits.

Although the quality of the generated sentences is crucial, the diversity of the generation is equally important because it reflects the model’s ability to use a range of commonsense knowledge facts. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown proficiency in enhancing the generation quality across various tasks through in-context learning (ICL) using given examples without the need for any fine-tuning. However, the diversity aspect in LLM outputs has not been systematically studied before. To address this, we propose a simple method that diversifies the LLM generations, while preserving their quality. Experimental results on three benchmark GCR datasets show that our method achieves an ideal balance between the quality and diversity. Moreover, the sentences generated by our proposed method can be used as training data to improve diversity in... | Tianhui Zhang, Bei Peng, Danushka Bollegala |  |

It now becomes crucial to identify whether the code is AI-generated and to determine the specific model used, particularly for purposes such as protecting Intellectual Property (IP) in industry and preventing cheating in programming exercises. To this end, several attempts have been made to insert watermarks into machine-generated code. However, existing approaches are limited to inserting only a single bit of information. In this paper, we introduce CodeIP, a novel multi-bit watermarking technique that embeds additional information to preserve crucial provenance details, such as the vendor ID of an LLM, thereby safeguarding the IPs of LLMs in code generation. Furthermore, to ensure the syntactical correctness of the generated code, we propose constraining the sampling process for predicting the next token by training a type predictor.

However, this approach largely depends on the quality of prompt initialization and always exhibits large variability among different runs. Such property makes prompt tuning highly unreliable and vulnerable to poorly constructed prompts, which limits its extension to more real-world applications. To tackle this issue, we propose to treat the hard prompt and soft prompt as separate inputs to mitigate noise brought by the prompt initialization. Furthermore, we optimize soft prompts with contrastive learning for utilizing class-aware information in the training process to maintain model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that StablePT outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 6.97% in accuracy and reduces the standard deviation by 1.92 on average. Furthermore, extensive experiments underscore its robustness and stability... | Xiaoming Liu, Chen Liu, Zhaohan Zhang, Chengzhengxu Li, Longtian Wang, Yu Lan, Chao Shen |  |

Most of the existing methods unifiedly model the evolution process of different events and ignore their inherent asynchronous characteristics, resulting in suboptimal performance. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Natural Evolution-based Dual-level Aggregation framework (NEDA) for TKG reasoning. Specifically, we design a natural division strategy to group TKGs into different patches according to the occurrence of a given target entity. Then, we present a dual-level aggregation scheme to extract local representations from information within patches and then aggregate these representations with adaptive weights as the final entity representations. By assigning varying weights to different patches, this aggregation scheme can incorporate the asynchronous characteristics of event evolution for representation computation, thus enhancing prediction performance.

Translating such idioms is challenging for human translators, who often resort to choosing a context-aware translation from an existing list of candidates. However, compiling a dictionary of candidate translations demands much time and creativity even for expert translators. To alleviate such burden, we evaluate if GPT-4 can help generate high-quality translations. Based on automatic evaluations of faithfulness and creativity, we first identify Pareto-optimal prompting strategies that can outperform translation engines from Google and DeepL. Then, at a low cost, our context-aware translations can achieve far more high-quality translations per idiom than the human baseline. We open-source all code and data to facilitate further research. | Kenan Tang, Peiyang Song, Yao Qin, Xifeng Yan |  |

However, LLMs are susceptible to societal biases due to their exposure to human-generated data. Given that LLMs are being used to gain insights into various societal aspects, it is essential to mitigate these biases. To that end, our study investigates the presence of implicit gender biases in multi-agent LLM interactions and proposes two strategies to mitigate these biases. We begin by creating a dataset of scenarios where implicit gender biases might arise, and subsequently develop a metric to assess the presence of biases. Our empirical analysis reveals that LLMs generate outputs characterized by strong implicit bias associations (≥ ≈ 50% of the time). Furthermore, these biases tend to escalate following multi-agent interactions. To mitigate them, we propose two strategies: self-reflection with in-context examples... | Angana Borah, Rada Mihalcea |  |

Commonly, contexts are prepared through either retrieval-based or generation-based methods. The former involves retrieving relevant documents from a corpus like Wikipedia, whereas the latter uses generative models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate the context. In this paper, we introduce a novel context preparation approach called HINTQA, which employs Automatic Hint Generation (HG) techniques. Unlike traditional methods, HINTQA prompts LLMs to produce hints about potential answers for the question rather than generating relevant context. We evaluate our approach across three QA datasets including TriviaQA, Natural Questions, and Web Questions, examining how the number and order of hints impact performance. Our findings show that the HINTQA surpasses both retrieval-based and generation-based approaches. We demonstrate that hints enhance the accuracy of answers more than... | Jamshid Mozafari, Abdelrahman Abdallah, Bhawna Piryani, Adam Jatowt |  |

A Causal Study on Sentiment Analysis](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.findings-emnlp.547) |  | 0 | Sentiment analysis (SA) aims to identify the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, often in the form of a review. Assuming a review and the sentiment associated with it, in this paper we formulate SA as a combination of two tasks: (1) a causal discovery task that distinguishes whether a review “primes” the sentiment (Causal Hypothesis C1), or the sentiment “primes” the review (Causal Hypothesis C2); and (2) the traditional prediction task to model the sentiment using the review as input. Using the peak-end rule in psychology, we classify a sample as C1 if its overall sentiment score approximates an average of all the sentence-level sentiments in the review, and as C2 if the overall sentiment score approximates an average of the peak and end sentiments. For the prediction task, we use the discovered causal mechanisms behind the samples to improve the performance of LLMs by proposing causal prompts that give the models an inductive bias of the underlying causal graph, leading to... | Zhiheng Lyu, Zhijing Jin, Fernando Gonzalez Adauto, Rada Mihalcea, Bernhard Schölkopf, Mrinmaya Sachan |  |

There are two challenges with current short-form QA evaluations: a lack of diverse styles of evaluation data and an over-reliance on expensive and slow LLMs. LLM-based scorers correlate better with humans, but this expensive task has only been tested on limited QA datasets. We rectify these issues by providing rubrics and datasets for evaluating machine QA adopted from the Trivia community. We also propose an efficient, and interpretable QA evaluation that is more stable than an exact match and neural methods (BERTScore). | Zongxia Li, Ishani Mondal, Huy Nghiem, Yijun Liang, Jordan L.

However, most current efforts focus on tasks within individual judicial stages, making it difficult to handle complex tasks that span multiple stages. As the autonomous agents powered by large language models are becoming increasingly smart and able to make complex decisions in real-world settings, offering new insights for judicial intelligence. In this paper, (1) we propose a novel multi-agent framework, AgentsCourt, for judicial decision-making. Our framework follows the classic court trial process, consisting of court debate simulation, legal resources retrieval and decision-making refinement to simulate the decision-making of judge. (2) we introduce SimuCourt, a judicial benchmark that encompasses 420 Chinese judgment documents, spanning the three most common types of judicial cases.

However, recent studies have identified side effects, such as knowledge distortion and the deterioration of general abilities, that have emerged after editing. Despite these findings, evaluating the pitfalls of knowledge editing often relies on inconsistent metrics and benchmarks, lacking a uniform standard. In response, this survey presents a comprehensive study of these side effects, providing a unified perspective on the challenges of knowledge editing in LLMs by conducting experiments with consistent metrics and benchmarks. Additionally, we review related works and outline potential research directions to address these limitations. Our survey highlights the limitations of current knowledge editing methods, emphasizing the need for a deeper understanding of the inner knowledge structures of LLMs and improved knowledge editing... | ChengHsun Hsueh, Paul KuoMing Huang, TzuHan Lin, CheWei Liao, HungChieh Fang, ChaoWei Huang, YunNung Chen |  |

RPI employs integration on internal attention scores and their gradients along a randomized path, which is dynamically established between a baseline representation and the attention scores of the model. The inherent randomness in the integration path originates from modeling the baseline representation as a randomly drawn tensor from a Gaussian diffusion process. As a consequence, RPI generates diverse baselines, yielding a set of candidate attribution maps. This set facilitates the selection of the most effective attribution map based on the specific metric at hand. We present an extensive evaluation, encompassing 11 explanation methods and 5 language models, including the Llama2 and Mistral models. Our results demonstrate that RPI outperforms latest state-of-the-art methods across 4 datasets... | Oren Barkan, Yehonatan Elisha, Yonatan Toib, Jonathan Weill, Noam Koenigstein |  |

These metrics are not suitable for most generation tasks because they assume that every claim is verifiable (i.e., can plausibly be proven true or false). We address this issue with VERISCORE,1 a metric for evaluating factuality in diverse long-form generation tasks that contain both verifiable and unverifiable content. VERISCORE can be effectively implemented with either closed or fine-tuned open-weight language models. Human evaluation confirms that VERISCORE’s extracted claims are more sensible than those from competing methods across eight different long-form tasks. We use VERISCORE to evaluate generations from 16 different models across multiple long-form tasks and find that while GPT-4o is the best-performing model overall, open-weight models such... | Yixiao Song, Yekyung Kim, Mohit Iyyer |  |

The conversational capabilities of large language models (LLMs) show great potential for providing scalable, real-time student guidance. However, current LLMs often give away solutions directly, making them ineffective instructors. We tackle this issue in the code debugging domain with TreeInstruct, an Instructor agent guided by a novel state space-based planning algorithm. TreeInstruct asks probing questions to help students independently identify and resolve errors. It estimates a student’s conceptual and syntactical knowledge to dynamically construct a question tree based on their responses and current knowledge state, effectively addressing both independent and dependent mistakes concurrently in a multi-turn interaction setting. In addition to using an existing single-bug debugging benchmark, we construct a more challenging multi-bug dataset of 150 coding problems, incorrect... | Priyanka Kargupta, Ishika Agarwal, Dilek HakkaniTür, Jiawei Han |  |

However, it is an open question how effective ICL can be. This paper presents Tutor-ICL, a simple prompting method for classification tasks inspired by how effective instructors might engage their students in learning a task. Specifically, we propose presenting exemplar answers in a \*comparative format\* rather than the traditional single-answer format. We also show that including the test instance before the exemplars can improve performance, making it easier for LLMs to focus on relevant exemplars. Lastly, we include a summarization step before attempting the test, following a common human practice. Experiments on various classification tasks, conducted across both decoder-only LLMs (Llama 2, 3) and encoder-decoder LLMs (Flan-T5-XL, XXL), show that Tutor-ICL consistently boosts performance, achieving up to a 13.76% increase in accuracy. | Ikhyun Cho, Gaeul Kwon, Julia Hockenmaier |  |

For example, therapists might try to shift the conversation’s direction to keep the therapeutic process on track and avoid stagnation, or patients might push the discussion towards issues they want to focus on.How do such patient and therapist redirections relate to the development and quality of their relationship? To answer this question, we introduce a probabilistic measure of the extent to which a certain utterance immediately redirects the flow of the conversation, accounting for both the intention and the actual realization of such a change. We apply this new measure to characterize the development of patient- therapist relationships over multiple sessions in a very large, widely-used online therapy platform. Our analysis reveals that (1) patient control of the conversation’s direction generally increases relative to that of the... | Vivian Nguyen, Sang Min Jung, Lillian Lee, Thomas D.

AML trains an attribution model to identify influential tokens in the input for a given language model’s prediction. The central concept of AML is to train an auxiliary attribution model to simultaneously 1) mask as much input data as possible while ensuring that the language model’s prediction closely aligns with its prediction on the original input, and 2) ensure a significant change in the model’s prediction when applying the inverse (complement) of the same mask to the input. This dual-masking approach further enables the optimization of the explanation w.r.t. the metric of interest. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AML on both encoder-based and decoder-based language models, showcasing its superiority over a variety of state-of-the-art explanation methods on multiple benchmarks. | Oren Barkan, Yonatan Toib, Yehonatan Elisha, Jonathan Weill, Noam Koenigstein |  |

Research on deception detection and fact checking often conflates factual accuracy with the truthfulness of statements. This assumption makes it difficult to (a) study subtle distinctions and interactions between the two and (b) gauge their effects on downstream tasks. The belief-based deception framework disentangles these properties by defining texts as deceptive when there is a mismatch between what people say and what they truly believe. In this study, we assess if presumed patterns of deception generalize to German language texts. We test the effectiveness of computational models in detecting deception using an established corpus of belief-based argumentation. Finally, we gauge the impact of deception on the downstream task of fact checking and explore if this property confounds verification models. Surprisingly, our analysis finds no correlation... | Aswathy Velutharambath, Amelie Wührl, Roman Klinger |  |

This customization is achieved by ”hardcoding” additional constraints into the NNR’s architecture and/or training objectives: any change in the desired recommendation behavior thus requires retraining the model with a modified objective. This impedes widespread adoption of multi-aspect news recommenders. In this work, we introduce MANNeR, a modular framework for multi-aspect neural news recommendation that supports on-the-fly customization over individual aspects at inference time. With metric-based learning as its backbone, MANNeR learns aspect-specialized news encoders and then flexibly and linearly combines the resulting aspect-specific similarity scores into different ranking functions, alleviating the need for ranking function-specific retraining... | Andreea Iana, Goran Glavas, Heiko Paulheim |  |

We show that traditional automatic metrics correlate poorly with human judgements and fail to capture the nuanced relationship between generated CNs and human perception. To alleviate this, we introduce a model ranking pipeline based on pairwise comparisons of generated CNs from different models, organized in a tournament-style format. The proposed evaluation method achieves a high correlation with human preference, with a ρ score of 0.88. As an additional contribution, we leverage LLMs as zero-shot CN generators and provide a comparative analysis of chat, instruct, and base models, exploring their respective strengths and limitations. Through meticulous evaluation, including fine-tuning experiments, we elucidate the differences in performance and responsiveness to domain-specific data. We conclude that chat-aligned models in zero-shot are the best... | Irune Zubiaga, Aitor Soroa, Rodrigo Agerri |  |

This survey paper provides an overview of OpenIE technologies spanning from 2007 to 2024, emphasizing a chronological perspective absent in prior surveys. It examines the evolution of task settings in OpenIE to align with the advances in recent technologies.

Current methods have shown that LLMs can effectively handle a certain amount of tools through in-context learning or fine-tuning. However, in real-world scenarios, the number of tools is typically extensive and irregularly updated, emphasizing the necessity for a dedicated tool retrieval component. Tool retrieval is nontrivial due to the following challenges: 1) complex user instructions and tool descriptions; 2) misalignment between tool retrieval and tool usage models. To address the above issues, we propose to enhance tool retrieval with iterative feedback from the large language model. Specifically, we prompt the tool usage model, i.e., the LLM, to provide feedback for the tool retriever model in multi-round, which could progressively improve the tool retriever’s understanding of instructions and tools and reduce the gap between... | Qiancheng Xu, Yongqi Li, Heming Xia, Wenjie Li |  |

Ambiguous questions have different answers depending on their interpretation and can take diverse forms. Temporally ambiguous questions are one of the most common types of such questions. In this paper, we introduce TEMPAMBIQA, a manually annotated temporally ambiguous QA dataset consisting of 8,162 open-domain questions derived from existing datasets. Our annotations focus on capturing temporal ambiguity to study the task of detecting temporally ambiguous questions. We propose a novel approach by using diverse search strategies based on disambiguate versions of the questions. We also introduce and test non-search, competitive baselines for detecting temporal ambiguity using zero-shot and few-shot approaches. | Bhawna Piryani, Abdelrahman Abdallah, Jamshid Mozafari, Adam Jatowt |  |

However, trainable parameter demand for LoRA increases with increasing model embedding dimensions, leading to high compute costs. Additionally, its backward updates require storing high-dimensional intermediate activations and optimizer states, demanding high peak GPU memory. In this paper, we introduce _LaMDA_, a novel approach to fine-tuning large language models, which leverages low-dimensional adaptation to achieve significant reductions in trainable parameters and peak GPU memory footprint. LaMDA freezes a first projection matrix (PMA) in the adaptation path while introducing a low-dimensional trainable square matrix, resulting in substantial reductions in trainable parameters and peak GPU memory usage. LaMDA gradually freezes a second projection matrix (PMB) during the early fine-tuning stages, reducing the compute cost... | Seyedarmin Azizi, Souvik Kundu, Massoud Pedram |  |

Detecting hallucinations in Machine Translation (MT) remains a critical challenge, particularly since existing methods excel with High-Resource Languages (HRLs) but exhibit substantial limitations when applied to Low-Resource Languages (LRLs). This paper evaluates sentence-level hallucination detection approaches using Large Language Models (LLMs) and semantic similarity within massively multilingual embeddings. Our study spans 16 language directions, covering HRLs, LRLs, with diverse scripts. We find that the choice of model is essential for performance. On average, for HRLs, Llama3-70B outperforms the previous state of the art by as much as 0.16 MCC (Matthews Correlation Coefficient). However, for LRLs we observe that Claude Sonnet outperforms other LLMs on... | Kenza Benkirane, Laura Gongas, Shahar Pelles, Naomi Fuchs, Joshua Darmon, Pontus Stenetorp, David Ifeoluwa Adelani, Eduardo Sánchez |  |

We formalize this problem as a reasoning task under zero-shot scenario, where given a video of an unintentional activity we want to know why it transitioned from intentional to unintentional. We first evaluate the effectiveness of current state-of-the-art Large Multimodal Models on this reasoning task and observe that they suffer from hallucination. We further propose a novel prompting technique, termed as Dream of Thoughts (DoT), which allows the model to navigate through hallucinated thoughts to achieve better reasoning. To evaluate the performance on this task, we also introduce three different specialized metrics designed to quantify the models reasoning capability. We perform our experiments on three datasets, OOPs, UCF-Crimes, and ReUAct, and our findings show that DOT prompting technique is able to outperform standard prompting, while minimizing hallucinations. | Shresth Grover, Vibhav Vineet, Yogesh S.

While pruning is a promising technique to reduce model size and accelerate the inference, the traditional pruning techniques can hardly be applied for LLMs as they need to finetune the model on the full dataset with multiple epochs consuming massive data and hardware resources. To deal with this problem, post-training pruning methods are proposed to prune LLMs in one-shot without retraining. However, their accuracy after pruning may suffer from certain performance degradation due to the lack of retraining with massive data. To address this issue, in this paper, we first formulate the post-training problem for layer-wise LLM compression to simultaneously prune multiple weights in LLMs. Next, we provide an optimal solution for this problem and design our post-training pruning algorithm for both unstructured and semi-structured sparsity.

Our study systematically analyzes self-anthropomorphic expression within various dialogue datasets, outlining the contrasts between self-anthropomorphic and non-self-anthropomorphic responses in dialogue systems. We show significant differences in these two types of responses and propose transitioning from one type to the other. We also introduce Pix2Persona, a novel dataset aimed at developing ethical and engaging AI systems in various embodiments. This dataset preserves the original dialogues from existing corpora and enhances them with paired responses: self-anthropomorphic and non-self-anthropomorphic for each original bot response. Our work not only uncovers a new category of bot responses that were previously under-explored but also lays the groundwork for future studies about dynamically adjusting self-anthropomorphism... | Yu Li, Devamanyu Hazarika, Di Jin, Julia Hirschberg, Yang Liu |  |

However, in the field of question generation, the creation of distractors for multiple-choice questions (MCQ) remains a challenging task. In this work, we present a simple, generic framework for distractor generation using readily available Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs). Unlike previous methods, our framework relies solely on pre-trained language models and does not require additional training on specific datasets. Building upon previous research, we introduce a two-stage framework consisting of candidate generation and candidate selection. Our proposed distractor generation framework outperforms previous methods without the need for training or fine-tuning. Human evaluations confirm that our approach produces more effective and engaging distractors. The related codebase is publicly available at... | Devrim Çavusoglu, Seçil Sen, Ulas Sert |  |

While many strategies and datasets to enhance LLMs’ mathematics are developed, it remains a challenge to simultaneously maintain and improve both language and mathematical capabilities in deployed LLM systems. In this work, we tailor the Self-Critique pipeline, which addresses the challenge in the feedback learning stage of LLM alignment. We first train a general Math-Critique model from the LLM itself to provide feedback signals. Then, we sequentially employ rejective fine-tuning and direct preference optimization over the LLM’s own generations for data collection. Based on ChatGLM3-32B, we conduct experiments on both academic and our newly created challenging dataset, MathUserEval. Results show that our pipeline significantly enhances the LLM’s mathematical problem-solving while still improving its language ability,... | Yifan Xu, Xiao Liu, Xinghan Liu, Zhenyu Hou, Yueyan Li, Xiaohan Zhang, Zihan Wang, Aohan Zeng, Zhengxiao Du, Wenyi Zhao, Jie Tang, Yuxiao Dong |  |

However, deploying LLMs on edge devices poses several challenges with respect to memory, energy, and compute costs, limiting their widespread use in devices such as mobile phones. A promising solution is to reduce the number of bits used to represent weights and activations. While existing works have found partial success at quantizing LLMs to lower bitwidths, e.g. 4-bit weights, quantizing activations beyond 16 bits often leads to large computational overheads due to poor on-device quantization support, or a considerable accuracy drop. Yet, 8-bit activations are very attractive for on-device deployment as they would enable LLMs to fully exploit mobile-friendly hardware, e.g. Neural Processing Units (NPUs). In this work, we make a first attempt to facilitate the on-device deployment of LLMs using integer-only quantization. We first investigate the... | Fuwen Tan, Royson Lee, Lukasz Dudziak, Shell Xu Hu, Sourav Bhattacharya, Timothy M. Hospedales, Georgios Tzimiropoulos, Brais Martínez |  |

Interpreting Referring Expression variation under Intergroup Bias](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.findings-emnlp.571) |  | 0 | The variations between in-group and out-group speech (intergroup bias) are subtle and could underlie many social phenomena like stereotype perpetuation and implicit bias. In this paper, we model intergroup bias as a tagging task on English sports comments from forums dedicated to fandom for NFL teams. We curate a dataset of over 6 million game-time comments from opposing perspectives (the teams in the game), each comment grounded in a non-linguistic description of the events that precipitated these comments (live win probabilities for each team). Expert and crowd annotations justify modeling the bias through tagging of implicit and explicit referring expressions and reveal the rich, contextual understanding of language and the world required for this task. For large-scale analysis of intergroup variation, we use LLMs for automated tagging, and discover that LLMs occasionally perform better when prompted with linguistic descriptions of the win probability at the time of the comment,... | Venkata S.

As such, the ability to detect LLMs-generated content has become of paramount importance. We aim to provide a detailed overview of existing detection strategies and benchmarks, scrutinizing their differences and identifying key challenges and prospects in the field, advocating for more adaptable and robust models to enhance detection accuracy. We also posit the necessity for a multi-faceted approach to defend against various attacks to counter the rapidly advancing capabilities of LLMs. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first comprehensive survey on the detection in the era of LLMs. We hope it will provide a broad understanding of the current landscape of LLMs-generated content detection, and we have maintained a website to... | Xianjun Yang, Liangming Pan, Xuandong Zhao, Haifeng Chen, Linda R.

While being a promising direction, most of such frameworks are trained and evaluated in settings with a prior knowledge of task requirements. However, as LLMs become more capable, it is necessary to assess their reasoning abilities in more realistic scenarios where many real-world problems are open-ended with ambiguous scope, and often require multiple formalisms to solve. To investigate this, we introduce the task of reasoning in the wild, where an LLM is tasked to solve a reasoning problem of unknown type by identifying the sub-problems and their corresponding formalisms, and writing a program to solve each sub-problem, guided by a tactic. We create a large tactic-guided trajectory dataset containing detailed solutions to a diverse set of reasoning problems, ranging from well-defined single-form reasoning (e.g., math, logic), to ambiguous and hybrid ones (e.g., commonsense,... | Yuan Yang, Siheng Xiong, Ali Payani, Ehsan Shareghi, Faramarz Fekri |  |

While further SFT and RLHF-based safety training can be conducted in multi-modal settings, collecting multi-modal training datasets poses a significant challenge. Inspired by the structural design of recent multi-modal models, where all input modalities are ultimately fused into the language space, we explore whether unlearning solely in the textual domain can be effective for cross-modality safety alignment. Our empirical evaluation across seven datasets demonstrates promising transferability — textual unlearning in VLMs significantly reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) to less than 8% and in some cases, even as low as nearly 2% for both text-based and vision-text-based attacks, alongside... | Trishna Chakraborty, Erfan Shayegani, Zikui Cai, Nael B.

They decompose complex questions into multiple reasoning steps and invoke specialized models for each step to solve the problems. However, these programs are prone to logic errors, with our preliminary evaluation showing that 58% of the total errors are caused by program logic errors. Debugging complex visual programs remains a major bottleneck for visual reasoning. To address this, we introduce \*\*VDebugger\*\*, a novel critic-refiner framework trained to localize and debug visual programs by tracking execution step by step. VDebugger identifies and corrects program errors leveraging detailed execution feedback, improving interpretability and accuracy. The training data is generated through an automated pipeline that injects errors into correct visual programs using a novel mask-best decoding technique. Evaluations on six datasets demonstrate VDebugger’s effectiveness,... | Xueqing Wu, Zongyu Lin, Songyan Zhao, TeLin Wu, Pan Lu, Nanyun Peng, KaiWei Chang |  |

One commonly recognized factor for this phenomenon is the model’s familiarity with the given prompt or instruction, which is typically estimated by its perplexity. However, finding the prompt with the lowest perplexity is challenging, given the enormous space of possible prompting phrases. In this paper, we propose monotonic paraphrasing (MonoPara), an end-to-end decoding strategy that paraphrases given prompts or instructions into their lower perplexity counterparts based on an ensemble of a paraphrase LM for prompt (or instruction) rewriting, and a target LM (i.e. the prompt or instruction executor) that constrains the generation for lower perplexity. The ensemble decoding process can efficiently paraphrase the original prompt without altering its semantic meaning, while monotonically decrease the perplexity of each generation as calculated by the target LM. We explore... | Qin Liu, Fei Wang, Nan Xu, Tianyi Yan, Tao Meng, Muhao Chen |  |

However, in many target applications, the natural reward functions are in tension with one another – for example, content preservation vs. style matching in style transfer tasks. Current techniques focus on maximizing the average of reward functions, which does not necessarily lead to prompts that achieve balance across rewards – an issue that has been well-studied in the multi-objective and robust optimization literature. In this paper, we conduct an empirical comparison of several existing multi-objective optimization techniques adapted to this new setting: RL-based discrete prompt optimization. We compare two methods optimizing the volume of the Pareto reward surface and one method that chooses an update direction that benefits all rewards simultaneously. We evaluate performance on two NLP tasks: style transfer and machine... | Yasaman Jafari, Dheeraj Mekala, Rose Yu, Taylor BergKirkpatrick |  |

However, how faithful the generated summaries are remains an open yet critical question. To address this, we propose FaReBio, a benchmark dataset with expert-annotated Faithfulness and Reasoning on plain Biomedical Summaries. This dataset consists of 175 plain summaries ($,445 sentences) generated by seven different LLMs, paired with source articles. Using our dataset, we identify the performance gap of LLMs in generating faithful plain biomedical summaries and observe a negative correlation between abstractiveness and faithfulness. We also show that current faithfulness evaluation metrics do not work well in the biomedical domain and confirm the over-confident tendency of LLMs as faithfulness evaluators. To better understand the faithfulness judgements, we further benchmark LLMs in retrieving supporting evidence and show the gap of LLMs in... | Biaoyan Fang, Xiang Dai, Sarvnaz Karimi |  |

By transitioning from constant to dynamic slicing, our method leverages the newly proposed Layer Redundancy (LR) score, which assesses how much change each layer changes its input by measuring the cosine similarity of the input to the output of the layer. We use this score to prune parts of individual layers based on redundancy in such a way that the average pruned percentage for all layers is a fixed value. We conducted extensive experiments using models like Llama3-8B and Mistral-7B on multiple datasets, evaluating different slicing bases and percentages to determine optimal configurations that balance efficiency and performance. Our findings show that our dynamic slicing approach not only maintains but, in many cases, enhances model performance compared to the baseline established by constant... | RazvanGabriel Dumitru, PaulIoan Clotan, Vikas Yadav, Darius Peteleaza, Mihai Surdeanu |  |

However, the disparity in performance between English and non-English languages remains a challenge yet to be fully addressed. This study introduces a promising direction for enhancing non-English performance through a specialized pruning approach. Specifically, we prune MLLMs using bilingual sentence pairs from English and other languages and empirically demonstrate that this pruning strategy can enhance the MLLMs’ performance in non-English language. | Hwichan Kim, Jun Suzuki, Tosho Hirasawa, Mamoru Komachi |  |

The task aims to construct an RST tree for a video to represent its storyline and illustrate the event relationships. We first construct a benchmark dataset by identifying events with their time spans, providing corresponding captions, and constructing RST trees with events as leaves. We then evaluate baseline approaches to video RST parsing: the ‘parsing after captioning’ framework and parsing via visual features. The results show that a parser using gold captions performed the best, while parsers relying on generated captions performed the worst; a parser using visual features provided intermediate performance. However, we observed that parsing via visual features could be improved by pre-training it with video captioning designed to produce a coherent video story. Furthermore, we demonstrated that RST trees obtained from videos contribute to... | Tsutomu Hirao, Naoki Kobayashi, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Manabu Okumura, Akisato Kimura |  |

Nevertheless, all Transformer-based models including LLMs suffer from a preset length limit and can hardly generalize from short training sequences to longer inference ones, namely, they can not perform \*\*length extrapolation\*\* to handle long sequences. Thus, numerous methods have emerged to enhance the length extrapolation of Transformers. Despite the great research efforts, a systematic survey is still lacking. To fill this gap, we delve into these advances in a unified notation from the perspective of positional encoding (PE), as it has been considered the primary factor on length extrapolation. Specifically, we begin with extrapolatable PEs that have dominated this research field. Then, we dive into extrapolation methods based on them, covering position interpolation and randomized position methods.

However, insufficient medical text precision and the modal disparity between text and vision spaces pose challenges for such paradigm. We show analytically and experimentally that enriching medical texts with detailed descriptions can markedly enhance the diagnosis performance, with the granularity and phrasing of these enhancements having a crucial impact on CLIP’s understanding of medical images; and learning proxies within the vision domain can effectively circumvent the modal gap issue. Based on our analysis, we propose a medical visual proxy learning framework comprising two key components: a text refinement module that create high quality medical text descriptions, and a stable Sinkhorn algorithm for an efficient generation of pseudo... | Jiaxiang Liu, Tianxiang Hu, Huimin Xiong, Jiawei Du, Yang Feng, Jian Wu, Joey Zhou, Zuozhu Liu |  |

In this work, we present wSignGen, a word-conditioned 3D American Sign Language (ASL) generation model dedicated to synthesizing realistic and grammatically accurate motion sequences for sign words. Our approach leverages a transformer-based diffusion model, trained on a curated dataset of 3D motion meshes from word-level ASL videos. By integrating CLIP, wSignGen offers two advantages: image-based generation, which is particularly useful for children learning sign language but not yet able to read, and the ability to generalize to unseen synonyms. Experiments demonstrate that wSignGen significantly outperforms the baseline model in the task of sign word generation. Moreover, human evaluation experiments show that wSignGen can generate high-quality, grammatically correct ASL signs effectively conveyed through 3D avatars. | Lu Dong, Xiao Wang, Ifeoma Nwogu |  |

Given that these agents will be integrated into high-stake domains, ensuring their reliability and safety is crucial. This paper presents an Agent-Constitution-based agent framework, TrustAgent, with a particular focus on improving the LLM-based agent safety. The proposed framework ensures strict adherence to the Agent Constitution through three strategic components: pre-planning strategy which injects safety knowledge to the model before plan generation, in-planning strategy which enhances safety during plan generation, and post-planning strategy which ensures safety by post-planning inspection. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can effectively enhance an LLM agent’s safety across multiple domains by identifying and mitigating potential dangers during the planning. Further analysis reveals that the framework not only improves safety but... | Wenyue Hua, Xianjun Yang, Mingyu Jin, Zelong Li, Wei Cheng, Ruixiang Tang, Yongfeng Zhang |  |

In this work, we present two novel techniques: BOTS for finding similarity between online communities based on their opinion, and Emb-PSR for finding similarity in the content they post. To facilitate finding the similarity based on opinion, we model the opinions on online communities using upvotes and downvotes as an indicator for community approval. Our results demonstrate that BOTS and Emb-PSR outperform existing techniques at their individual tasks while also being flexible enough to allow for cross-platform comparison of online communities. We demonstrate this novel cross-platform capability by comparing GAB with various subreddits. | Prasanna Lakkur Subramanyam, JengYu Chou, Kevin Nam, Brian Levine |  |

However, nearly all of them overlook the rich semantics of numerical entities (e.g., magnitude, unit, and distribution) and are simply treated as common entities, or even directly removed. It may severely hinder the performance of answering queries involving numerical comparison or numerical computation. To address this issue, we propose the Complex Number and Entity Query model (CNEQ), which comprises a Number-Entity Predictor and an Entity Filter. The Number-Entity Predictor can independently learn the structural and semantic features of entities and numerical values, thereby enabling better prediction of entities as well as numerical values. The Entity Filter can compare or calculate numerical values to filter out entities that meet certain numerical constraints. To evaluate our model, we generated a variety of multi-hop... | Xianshu Peng, Wei Wei, Kaihe Xu, Dangyang Chen |  |

While existing prompt optimization methods improve prompt effectiveness, they often lead to prompt drifting, wherein newly generated prompts canadversely impact previously successful cases while addressing failures. Furthermore, these methods tend to rely heavily on LLMs’ intrinsic capabilities for prompt optimization tasks. In this paper, we introduce STRAGO (StrategicGuided Optimization), a novel approach designed to mitigate prompt drifting by leveraging insights from both successful and failed cases to identify critical factors for achieving optimization objectives. STRAGO employs a how-to-do methodology, integrating in-context learning to formulate specific, actionable strategies that provide detailed, step-by-step guidance for prompt optimization.

For completing the complex task, we still need a plan for the task to guide LLMs to generate the specific solutions step by step. LLMs can directly generate task plans, but these plans may still contain factual errors or are incomplete. A high-quality task plan contains correct step-by-step solutions for solving all situations and behavioral instructions for avoiding mistakes. To obtain it, we propose the Learning to Plan method, which involves two phases: (1) In the first learning task plan phase, it iteratively updates the task plan with new step-by-step solutions and behavioral instructions, which are obtained by prompting LLMs to derive from training error feedback. (2) In the subsequent test phase, the LLM uses the learned task plan to guide the inference of LLM on the test set. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the five different reasoning type tasks (8... | Yiduo Guo, Yaobo Liang, Chenfei Wu, Wenshan Wu, Dongyan Zhao, Nan Duan |  |

Although researchers are exploring the use of few-shot information extraction through in-context learning with LLMs, they tend to focus only on using correct or positive examples for demonstration, neglecting the potential value of incorporating incorrect or negative examples into the learning process. In this paper, we present C-ICL, a novel few-shot technique that leverages both correct and incorrect sample constructions to create in-context learning demonstrations. This approach enhances the ability of LLMs to extract entities and relations by utilizing prompts that incorporate not only the positive samples but also the reasoning behind them. This method allows for the identification and correction of potential interface errors.... | Ying Mo, Jiahao Liu, Jian Yang, Qifan Wang, Shun Zhang, Jingang Wang, Zhoujun Li |  |

However, these findings have been concentrated on specific tasks and models, leaving it unclear how universal circuits are across different settings. In this paper, we study the circuits implemented by Gemma 2B for solving the subject-verb agreement task across two different languages, English and Spanish. We discover that both circuits are highly consistent, being mainly driven by a particular attention head writing a ‘subject number’ signal to the last residual stream, which is read by a small set of neurons in the final MLPs. Notably, this subject number signal is represented as a direction in the residual stream space, and is language-independent. Finally, we demonstrate this direction has a causal effect on the model predictions, effectively flipping the Spanish predicted verb number by intervening with the direction found in English. | Javier Ferrando, Marta R.

While many researchers have studied LLM personalization and role-playing, they primarily use LLM-as-a-Judge for evaluation without thoroughly examining its validity. This paper investigates the reliability of LLM-as-a-Personalized-Judge—asking LLMs to judge user preferences based on persona. Our results suggest that LLM-as-a-Personalized-Judge is less reliable for personalization than previously believed, showing low agreement with human ground truth. We observed that the personas provided to the LLM often have limited predictive power for the tasks, leading us to introduce verbal uncertainty estimation. We find that powerful LLMs are aware of the certainty of their prediction and can achieve high agreement with ground truth on high-certainty samples, indicating a promising approach for building reliable and scalable proxies for evaluating LLM... | Yijiang River Dong, Tiancheng Hu, Nigel Collier |  |

Nevertheless, encountering conflicting sources of information within the retrieval context is an inevitable practical challenge. In such situations, the language models are recommended to transparently inform users about the conflicts rather than autonomously deciding what to present based on their inherent biases. To analyze how current large language models (LLMs) align with our recommendation, we introduce WhoQA, a public benchmark dataset to examine model’s behavior in knowledge conflict situations. We induce conflicts by asking about a common property among entities having the same name, resulting in questions with up to 8 distinctive answers. WhoQA evaluation set includes 5K questions across 13 Wikidata property types and 150K Wikipedia entities. Our experiments show that despite the simplicity of WhoQA questions, knowledge conflicts... | Quang Pham, Hoang Ngo, Anh Tuan Luu, Dat Quoc Nguyen |  |

In this work, we propose a post-hoc framework, aiming at fusing heterogeneous models off-the-shell, which we call likelihood composition, and the basic idea is to compose multiple models’ likelihood distribution when doing a multi-choice visual-question-answering task. Here the core concept, likelihood, is actually the log-probability of the candidate answer. In likelihood composition, we introduce some basic operations: debias, highlight, majority-vote and ensemble. By combining (composing) these basic elements, we get the mixed composition methods: mix-composition. Through conducting comprehensive experiments on 9 VQA datasets and 10 MLMs, we prove the effectiveness of mix-composition compared with simple ensemble or majority-vote methods.

Although existing methods have explored the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated scientific reviewing, their generated contents are often generic or partial. To address the issues above, we introduce an automated paper reviewing framework SEA. It comprises of three modules: Standardization, Evaluation, and Analysis, which are represented by models SEA-S, SEA-E, and SEA-A, respectively. Initially, SEA-S distills data standardization capabilities of GPT-4 for integrating multiple reviews for a paper. Then, SEA-E utilizes standardized data for fine-tuning, enabling it to generate constructive reviews. Finally, SEA-A introduces a new evaluation metric called mismatch score to assess the consistency between paper contents and reviews. Moreover, we design a self-correction strategy to enhance the consistency.

Specifically, we propose an automated testing framework (called KONTEST) which leverages a knowledge graph to construct test cases. KONTEST probes and measures the inconsistencies in the LLM’s knowledge of the world via a combination of semantically-equivalent queries and test oracles (metamorphic or ontological oracle). KONTEST further mitigates knowledge gaps via a weighted LLM model ensemble. Using four state-of-the-art LLMs (Falcon, Gemini, GPT3.5, and Llama2), we show that KONTEST generates 19.2% error inducing inputs (1917 errors from 9979 test inputs). It also reveals a 16.5% knowledge gap across all tested LLMs. A mitigation method informed by KONTEST’s test suite reduces LLM knowledge gap by 32.48%. Our ablation study further shows that GPT3.5 is not suitable for knowledge-based consistency testing because it is only 60%-68% effective in knowledge... | Sai Sathiesh Rajan, Ezekiel Olamide Soremekun, Sudipta Chattopadhyay |  |

These advancements encourage the investigation of molecule-text modeling within synthetic chemistry, a field dedicated to designing and conducting chemical reactions to synthesize new compounds with desired properties and applications. Current approaches, however, often neglect the critical role of multi-molecule graph interaction in understanding chemical reactions, leading to suboptimal performance in synthetic chemistry tasks. This study introduces PRESTO (Progressive Pretraining Enhances Synthetic Chemistry Outcomes), a new framework that bridges the molecule-text modality gap by integrating a comprehensive benchmark of pretraining strategies and dataset configurations. It progressively improves multimodal LLMs through cross-modal alignment and multi-graph understanding. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that PRESTO offers competitive results in downstream synthetic... | He Cao, Yanjun Shao, Zhiyuan Liu, Zijing Liu, Xiangru Tang, Yuan Yao, Yu Li |  |

In this paper, we address query routing for homogeneous tools by predicting both their performance and the associated cost required to accomplish a given task. We then assign queries to the optimal tools in a cost-effective manner. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves higher performance at a lower cost compared to strong baseline approaches. | Feiteng Mu, Yong Jiang, Liwen Zhang, Chu Liu, Wenjie Li, Pengjun Xie, Fei Huang |  |

These works typically utilize VLM as a foundation, fine-tuning it with instruction-based mobile datasets. However, these VLMs are typically pre-trained on general-domain data, which often results in a lack of fundamental capabilities specific to the mobile domain. Therefore, they may struggle to recognize specific UI elements and understand intra-UI fine-grained information. In addition, the current fine-tuning task focuses on interacting with the most relevant element for the given instruction. These fine-tuned VLMs may still ignore the relationships between UI pages, neglect the roles of elements in page transitions and lack inter-UI understanding. To address issues, we propose a VLM called MobileVLM, which includes two additional pre-training stages to enhance both intra- and inter-UI understanding. We defined four UI-based pre-training tasks, enabling the model to better perceive fine-grained elements... | Qinzhuo Wu, Weikai Xu, Wei Liu, Tao Tan, Jianfeng Liu, Ang Li, Jian Luan, Bin Wang, Shuo Shang |  |

We introduce schema-driven information extraction, a new task that transforms tabular data into structured records following a human-authored schema. To assess various LLM’s capabilities on this task, we present a benchmark comprised of tables from four diverse domains: machine learning papers, chemistry literature, material science journals, and webpages. We use this collection of annotated tables to evaluate the ability of open-source and API-based language models to extract information from tables covering diverse domains and data formats. Our experiments demonstrate that surprisingly competitive performance can be achieved without requiring task-specific pipelines or labels, achieving F1 scores ranging from 74.2 to 96.1, while maintaining cost efficiency. Moreover, through detailed ablation studies and analyses, we investigate the factors... | Fan Bai, Junmo Kang, Gabriel Stanovsky, Dayne Freitag, Mark Dredze, Alan Ritter |  |

Revisiting Task Definition Biases](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.findings-emnlp.601) |  | 0 | Definition bias is a negative phenomenon that can mislead models. However, definition bias in information extraction appears not only across datasets from different domains but also within datasets sharing the same domain. We identify two types of definition bias in IE: bias among information extraction datasets and bias between information extraction datasets and instruction tuning datasets. To systematically investigate definition bias, we conduct three probing experiments to quantitatively analyze it and discover the limitations of unified information extraction and large language models in solving definition bias. To mitigate definition bias in information extraction, we propose a multi-stage framework consisting of definition bias measurement, bias-aware fine-tuning, and task-specific bias mitigation. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in addressing definition bias. | Wenhao Huang, Qianyu He, Zhixu Li, Jiaqing Liang, Yanghua Xiao |  |

Despite the success, fine-tuning continues to rely on repeated and lengthy prompts, which escalate computational expenses, require more resources, and lead to slower inference. In this paper, we present a novel approach, PromptIntern, which internalizes prompt knowledge during model fine-tuning to achieve efficient inference and save costs. Instead of compressing the prompts for a vanilla model, PromptIntern aims to embed the recurrent prompt directly into the model parameters. We design a fine-tuning pipeline that includes instruction template compression, few-shot example absorption, and a progressive internalization strategy, effectively diminishing the need for intricate prompts during inference. Comprehensive experiments on challenging NL2Code tasks demonstrate that our method reduces input tokens by more than 90%, accelerates inference by 4.2 times, and reduces... | Jiaru Zou, Mengyu Zhou, Tao Li, Shi Han, Dongmei Zhang |  |

Existing solutions mainly tested on smaller tables face scalability issues and struggle with complex queries due to incomplete or dispersed data across different table sections. To alleviate these challenges, we propose TAP4LLM as a versatile pre-processor suite for leveraging LLMs in table-based tasks effectively. It covers several distinct components: (1) table sampling to decompose large tables into manageable sub-tables based on query semantics, (2) table augmentation to enhance tables with additional knowledge from external sources or models, and (3) table packing & serialization to convert tables into various formats suitable for LLMs’ understanding. In each module, we design and compare several common methods for usage in various scenarios, aiming to shed light on... | Yuan Sui, Jiaru Zou, Mengyu Zhou, Xinyi He, Lun Du, Shi Han, Dongmei Zhang |  |

Accessibility to computing resources remains a barrier for the open-source community. To address this challenge, we propose the In2Core algorithm, which selects a coreset by analyzing the correlation between training and evaluation samples with a trained model. Notably, we assess the model’s internal gradients to estimate this relationship, aiming to rank the contribution of each training point. To enhance efficiency, we propose an optimization to compute influence functions with a reduced number of layers while achieving similar accuracy. By applying our algorithm to instruction fine-tuning data of LLMs, we can achieve similar performance with just 50% of the training data. Meantime, using influence functions to analyze model coverage to certain testing samples could provide a reliable and interpretable signal... | Ayrton San Joaquin, Bin Wang, Zhengyuan Liu, Philippe Muller, Nicholas Asher, Brian Lim, Nancy F.

A Simulation based on Large Language Models](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.findings-emnlp.605) |  | 0 | Psychological evidence reveals the influence of personality traits on decision-making. For instance, agreeableness is generally associated with positive outcomes in negotiations, whereas neuroticism is often linked to less favorable outcomes. This paper introduces a simulation framework centered on large language model (LLM) agents endowed with synthesized personality traits. The agents negotiate within bargaining domains and possess customizable personalities and objectives. The experimental results show that the behavioral tendencies of LLM-based simulations can reproduce behavioral patterns observed in human negotiations. The contribution is twofold. First, we propose a simulation methodology that investigates the alignment between the linguistic and economic capabilities of LLM agents. Secondly, we offer empirical insights into the strategic impacts of Big Five personality traits on the outcomes of bilateral negotiations. We also provide an in-depth analysis based on simulated... | Yin Jou Huang, Rafik Hadfi |  |

Compared to domain-specific work in this task, this setting proved particularly challenging due to the absence of domain-specific features. Aiming to bridge this gap, we integrate spatial information by proposing an utterance generation model with a novel spatial graph that is flexible to deal with the open-domain characteristics of the commentaries and significantly improves performance. Furthermore, we propose a novel evaluation scheme, more suitable for live commentary generation, that uses LLMs to automatically check whether generated utterances address essential aspects of the video via the answerability of questions extracted directly from the videos using LVLMs. Our results suggest that using a combination of our answerability score and a standard machine translation metric is likely a more reliable way to evaluate the performance in this task. | Erica K.

However, such approach encounters some challenges: Firstly, the original queries may not be suitable for precise retrieval, resulting in erroneous contextual knowledge; Secondly, the language model can easily generate inconsistent answer with external references due to their knowledge boundary limitation. To address these issues, we propose the chain-of-verification (CoV-RAG) to enhance the external retrieval correctness and internal generation consistency. Specifically, we integrate the verification module into the RAG, engaging in scoring, judgment, and rewriting. To correct external retrieval errors, CoV-RAG retrieves new knowledge using a revised query. To correct internal generation errors, we unify QA and verification tasks with a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning during training.

Existing zero-shot detectors that primarily focus on token-level distributions are vulnerable to real-world domain shift including different decoding strategies, variations in prompts, and attacks. We propose a more robust method that incorporates abstract elements—such as topic or event transitions—as key deciding factors, by training a latent-space model on sequences of events or topics derived from human-written texts. On three different domains, machine generations which are originally inseparable from humans’ on the token level can be better distinguished with our latent-space model, leading to a 31% improvement over strong baselines such as DetectGPT. Our analysis further reveals that unlike humans, modern LLMs such as GPT-4 selecting event triggers and transitions differently, and inherent disparity... | Yufei Tian, Zeyu Pan, Nanyun Peng |  |

How to achieve the ability to efficiently retrieve entities in cross-domain large-scale databases is a key issue. Most existing end-to-end Task-Oriented Dialogue systems suffer from the following problems: The ability to handle erroneous but easily confused entities needs to be improved; Matching information between contexts and entities is not captured, leading to weak modeling of domain-invariant and interpretable features, making it difficult to generalize to unseen domains. In this paper, we propose a method for knowledge retrieval driven by matching representations. The approach consists of a matching signal extractor for extracting matching representations between contexts and entities that have generic conceptual features and hence domain invariant properties, and an Attribute Filter for filtering irrelevant information to facilitate... | Wanshi Xu, Xuxin Cheng, Zhihong Zhu, Zhanpeng Chen, Yuexian Zou |  |

In this paper, we propose ShieldLM, an LLM-based safety detector, which aligns with common safety standards, supports customizable detection rules, and provides explanations for its decisions. To train ShieldLM, we compile a large bilingual dataset comprising 14,387 query-response pairs, annotating the safety of responses based on various safety standards. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ShieldLM surpasses strong baselines across four test sets, showcasing remarkable customizability and explainability. Besides performing well on standard detection datasets, ShieldLM has also been shown to be effective as a safety evaluator for advanced LLMs. ShieldLM is released at https://github.com/thu-coai/ShieldLM to support accurate and... | Zhexin Zhang, Yida Lu, Jingyuan Ma, Di Zhang, Rui Li, Pei Ke, Hao Sun, Lei Sha, Zhifang Sui, Hongning Wang, Minlie Huang |  |

This narrow scope often overlooks a vast range of unexamined implicit associations, restricting the identification and, hence, mitigation of such biases. We address this gap by probing VLMs to (1) uncover hidden, implicit associations across 9 bias dimensions. We systematically explore diverse input and output modalities and (2) demonstrate how biased associations vary in their negativity, toxicity, and extremity. Our work (3) identifies subtle and extreme biases that are typically not recognized by existing methodologies.

Compared to traditional LLMs, MoE LLMs outperform traditional LLMs by achieving higher performance with considerably fewer activated parameters. Despite this efficiency, their enormous parameter size still leads to high deployment costs. In this paper, we introduce a two-stage compression method tailored for MoE to reduce the model size and decrease the computational cost. First, in the inter-expert pruning stage, we analyze the importance of each layer and propose the Layer-wise Genetic Search and Block-wise KT-Reception Field with the non-uniform pruning ratio to prune the individual expert. Second, in the intra-expert decomposition stage, we apply the low-rank decomposition to further compress the parameters within the remaining experts.

Obtaining large-scale, high-quality real-world fact-checking datasets for training detectors is costly, leading researchers to use synthetic datasets generated by AI technologies. However, the generalizability of detectors trained on synthetic data to real-world scenarios remains unclear due to the distribution gap. To address this, we propose learning from synthetic data for detecting real-world multimodal misinformation through two model-agnostic data selection methods that match synthetic and real-world data distributions. Experiments show that our method enhances the performance of a small MLLM (13B) on real-world fact-checking datasets, enabling it to even surpass GPT-4V. | Fengzhu Zeng, Wenqian Li, Wei Gao, Yan Pang |  |

In this paper, we study building language-specific LLMs by adapting monolingual and multilingual LLMs. We conduct systematic experiments on how design choices (base model selection, vocabulary extension, and continued pretraining) impact the adapted LLM, both in terms of efficiency (how many tokens are needed to encode the same amount of information) and end task performance. We find that (1) the initial performance of LLM does not always correlate with the final performance after the adaptation. Adapting an English-centric models can yield better results than adapting multilingual models despite their worse initial performance on low-resource languages. (2) Efficiency can easily improved with simple vocabulary extension and continued pretraining in most LLMs we study, and (3) The optimal adaptation method (choice of the base model, new vocabulary size,... | Atula Tejaswi, Nilesh Gupta, Eunsol Choi |  |

However, the development of large language models (LLMs) requires substantial data and computational resources, rendering them valuable intellectual properties for their developers and owners. To establish a mechanism that protects both data and model privacy in a federated learning context, we introduce a method that just needs to distribute a quantized version of the model’s parameters during training. This method enables accurate gradient estimations for parameter updates while preventing clients from accessing a model whose performance is comparable to the centrally hosted one. Moreover, we combine this quantization strategy with LoRA, a popular and parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, to significantly reduce communication costs in federated learning.

Identifying the intended target item from patient’s circumlocution involves the two challenges of term failure and error. (1) The terms relevant to identifying the item remain unseen. (2) What makes the challenge unique is inherent perturbed terms by semantic paraphasia, which are not exactly related to the target item, hindering the identification process. To address each, we propose robustifying the model from semantically paraphasic errors and enhancing the model with unseen terms with gradient-based selective augmentation (GradSelect). Specifically, the gradient value controls augmented data quality amid semantic errors, while the gradient variance guides the inclusion of unseen but relevant terms. Due to limited domain-specific datasets, we evaluate the model on the Tip of the Tongue dataset as an intermediary task and then... | Jongho Kim, Romain Storaï, Seungwon Hwang |  |

We explore this paradigm for the financial domain, focusing on the challenge of answering questions that require multi-hop numerical reasoning over financial texts. We assess the performance of several smaller models that have been fine-tuned to generate programs that encode the required financial reasoning and calculations. Our findings demonstrate that these fine-tuned smaller models approach the performance of the teacher model.To provide a granular analysis of model performance, we propose an approach to investigate the specific student model capabilities that are enhanced by fine-tuning.

In this study, we investigate the efficacy of four techniques in adapting LLMs for clinical use-cases: continuous pretraining, instruct fine-tuning, NEFTune, and prompt engineering. We employ these methods on Mistral 7B and Mixtral 8x7B models, leveraging a large-scale clinical pretraining dataset of 50 billion tokens and an instruct fine-tuning dataset of 500 million tokens. Our evaluation across various clinical tasks reveals nuanced insights. While continuous pretraining beyond 250 billion tokens yields marginal improvements, instruct fine-tuning emerges as a more influential factor. Notably, NEFTune, designed primarily to enhance generation quality, surprisingly demonstrates additional gains on our benchmark. These findings underscore the importance of tailoring fine-tuning strategies and exploring innovative techniques to optimize LLM performance in the clinical domain. | Clément Christophe, Tathagata Raha, Svetlana Maslenkova, Muhammad Umar Salman, Praveen K.

Despite advancements, challenges persist due to the complexity and diversity inherent in medical tasks, which can be categorized as knowledge-intensive tasks and alignment-required tasks. Previous approaches either ignore the latter task or focus on a minority of tasks and hence lose generalization. To address these drawbacks, we propose a progressive fine-tuning pipeline. This pipeline employs a and a to encode diverse knowledge in the first stage and filter out detrimental information. In the second stage, we drop the to avoid the interference of suboptimal representation and leverage an additional alignment module optimized towards an orthogonal direction to the knowledge space to mitigate knowledge forgetting. Based on this two-stage paradigm, we proposed a Medical LLM through decoupling Clinical Alignment and Knowledge... | Yusheng Liao, Shuyang Jiang, Zhe Chen, Yanfeng Wang, Yu Wang |  |

The RLHF process typically starts by training a reward model (RM) using human preference data. Conventional RMs are trained on pairwise responses to the same user request, with relative ratings indicating which response humans prefer. The trained RM serves as a proxy for human preferences. However, due to the black-box nature of RMs, their outputs lack interpretability, as humans cannot intuitively understand why an RM thinks a response is good or not. As RMs act as human preference proxies, it is desirable for them to be human-interpretable to ensure that their internal decision processes are consistent with human preferences and to prevent reward hacking in LLM alignment. To build RMs with interpretable preferences, we propose a two-stage approach: i) train an Absolute-Rating Multi-Objective Reward Model (ArmoRM) with multi-dimensional... | Haoxiang Wang, Wei Xiong, Tengyang Xie, Han Zhao, Tong Zhang |  |

However, CPLMs are trained on massive open-source code, raising concerns about potential data infringement. This paper launches the study of detecting unauthorized code use in CPLMs, i.e., Code Membership Inference (CMI) task. We design a framework Buzzer for different settings of CMI. Buzzer deploys several inference techniques, including signal extraction from pre-training tasks, hard-to-learn sample calibration and weighted inference, to identify code membership status accurately. Extensive experiments show that CMI can be achieved with high accuracy using Buzzer. Hence, Buzzer can serve as a CMI tool and help protect intellectual property rights.

However, understanding users’ contextual search intent when generating responses is an understudied topic for conversational question answering (QA). This conversational extension leads to additional concerns when compared to single-turn QA as it is more challenging for systems to comprehend conversational context and manage retrieved passages over multiple turns. In this work, we propose a method for enabling LLMs to decide when to retrieve in RAG settings given a conversational context. When retrieval is deemed necessary, the LLM then rewrites the conversation for passage retrieval and judges the relevance of returned passages before response generation. Operationally, we build on the single-turn SELF-RAG framework (Asai et al., 2023) and propose SELF-multi-RAG for conversational settings. SELF-multi-RAG... | Nirmal Roy, Leonardo F. R.

Yet, besides NL, LLMs have seen various non-NL formats during pre-training, such as code and logical expression. NL’s status as the optimal format for LLMs, particularly in single-LLM reasoning and multi-agent communication, has not been thoroughly examined. In this work, we challenge the default use of NL by exploring the utility of non-NL formats in these contexts. We show that allowing LLMs to autonomously select the most suitable format before reasoning or communicating leads to a 3.3 to 5.7% improvement in reasoning efficiency for different LLMs, and up to a 72.7% reduction in token usage in multi-agent communication, all while maintaining communicative effectiveness. Our comprehensive analysis further reveals that LLMs can devise a format from limited task instructions... | Weize Chen, Chenfei Yuan, Jiarui Yuan, Yusheng Su, Chen Qian, Cheng Yang, Ruobing Xie, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun |  |

Existing methods employ one single LLM-based agent to iteratively select and execute tools, thereafter incorporating execution results into the next action prediction. Despite their progress, these methods suffer from performance degradation when addressing practical tasks due to: (1) the pre-defined pipeline with restricted flexibility to calibrate incorrect actions, and (2) the struggle to adapt a general LLM-based agent to perform a variety of specialized actions. To mitigate these problems, we propose ConAgents, a Cooperative and interactive Agents framework, which coordinates three specialized agents for tool selection, tool execution, and action calibration separately. ConAgents introduces two communication protocols to enable the flexible cooperation of agents. To effectively generalize the ConAgents into open-source models, we also propose specialized action... | Zhengliang Shi, Shen Gao, Xiuyi Chen, Yue Feng, Lingyong Yan, Haibo Shi, Dawei Yin, Pengjie Ren, Suzan Verberne, Zhaochun Ren |  |

This process is the basis of a wide range of legal applications such as legal advice, automated judicial decisions, legal document drafting, etc. Existing statute retrieval benchmarks emphasize formal and professional queries from sources like bar exams and legal case documents, thereby neglecting non-professional queries from the general public, which often lack precise legal terminology and references. To address this gap, we introduce the STAtute Retrieval Dataset (STARD), a Chinese dataset comprising 1,543 query cases collected from real-world legal consultations and 55,348 candidate statutory articles. Unlike existing statute retrieval datasets, which primarily focus on professional legal queries, STARD captures the complexity and diversity of real queries from the general public.

Without additional training, we propose Counterfactual Inception, a novel method that implants counterfactual thinking into LMMs using self-generated counterfactual keywords. Our method is grounded in the concept of counterfactual thinking, a cognitive process where human considers alternative realities, enabling more extensive context exploration. Bridging the human cognition mechanism into LMMs, we aim for the models to engage with and generate responses that span a wider contextual scene understanding, mitigating hallucinatory outputs. We further introduce Plausibility Verification Process (PVP), a simple yet robust keyword constraint that effectively filters out sub-optimal keywords to enable the consistent triggering of counterfactual thinking in the model responses.

Unlike previous adaptation strategies that solely focus on constructing domain-specific corpus, MELT comprehensively considers both the corpus and the training strategy, given that materials science corpus has distinct characteristics from other domains. To this end, we first construct a comprehensive materials knowledge base from the scientific corpus by building semantic graphs. Leveraging this extracted knowledge, we integrate a curriculum into the adaptation process that begins with familiar and generalized concepts and progressively moves toward more specialized terms. We conduct extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks to verify the effectiveness and generality of MELT. A comprehensive evaluation convincingly supports the strength of MELT, demonstrating superior... | Junho Kim, Yeachan Kim, JunHyung Park, Yerim Oh, Suho Kim, SangKeun Lee |  |

Various input attribution-based methods attempt to interpret their behavior, but they face challenges with implicitly offensive memes and non-causal attributions. To address these issues, we propose a framework based on a Structural Causal Model (SCM). In this framework, VisualBERT is trained to predict the class of an input meme based on both meme input and causal concepts, allowing for transparent interpretation. Our qualitative evaluation demonstrates the framework’s effectiveness in understanding model behavior, particularly in determining whether the model was right due to the right reason, and in identifying reasons behind misclassification. Additionally, quantitative analysis assesses the significance of proposed modelling choices, such as de-confounding, adversarial learning, and dynamic routing, and compares them with input attribution methods. Surprisingly, we find that input... | Dibyanayan Bandyopadhyay, Mohammed Hasanuzzaman, Asif Ekbal |  |

Retraining these models after excluding sensitive data is prohibitively expensive, making machine unlearning a viable, cost-effective alternative. Previous research has focused on machine unlearning for monolingual models, but we find that unlearning in one language does not necessarily transfer to others. This vulnerability makes models susceptible to low-resource language attacks, where sensitive information remains accessible in less dominant languages. This paper presents a pioneering approach to machine unlearning for multilingual language models, selectively erasing information across different languages while maintaining overall performance. Specifically, our method employs an adaptive unlearning scheme that assigns language-dependent weights to address different language performances of multilingual language models.

To address this, we conduct extensive multilingual continual pre-training on the LLaMA series models, enabling translation support across more than 100 languages. Through a comprehensive analysis of training strategies, such as vocabulary expansion and data augmentation, we develop LLaMAX. Remarkably, without sacrificing its generalization ability, LLaMAX achieves significantly higher translation performance compared to existing open-source LLMs (by more than 10 spBLEU points) and performs on-par with specialized translation model (M2M-100-12B) on the Flores-101 benchmark. Extensive experiments indicate that LLaMAX can serve as a robust multilingual foundation model. The code and the models are publicly available. | Yinquan Lu, Wenhao Zhu, Lei Li, Yu Qiao, Fei Yuan |  |

Previous methods often apply Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction (ECPE) task models, treating the entire conversation as a whole for contextual interaction. However, statistical analysis shows that the number of emotion-cause pairs in ECPEC conversation data far exceeds that in ECPE datasets, leading to interference among multiple events within a conversation and causing noise to propagate between different events. To address this issue, we propose a novel CEnter eveNT-guided framEwoRk (CENTER). This model introduces a Center Event Detection task to construct a center event-aware graph that captures the unique representations of different event regions. Additionally, mimicking human reasoning processes, we build a center event reasoning graph and use graph neural network to... | Botao Wang, Keke Tang, Peican Zhu |  |

Nevertheless, many pre-training datasets are restricted by patient privacy concerns, potentially containing noise that can adversely affect downstream performance. Moreover, the growing reliance on multi-modal generation exacerbates this issue because of its susceptibility to adversarial attacks. To investigate how VLMs trained on adversarial noisy data perform on downstream medical tasks, we first craft noisy upstream datasets using multi-modal adversarial attacks. Through our comprehensive analysis, we unveil that moderate noise enhances model robustness and transferability, but increasing noise levels negatively impact downstream task performance. To mitigate this issue, we propose rectify adversarial noise (RAN) framework, a recipe designed to effectively defend adversarial attacks and rectify the influence of upstream noise during fine-tuning. | Xu Han, Linghao Jin, Xuezhe Ma, Xiaofeng Liu |  |

Focusing on two closely related language pairs, English-Marathi and English-Hindi, we exploit the linguistic similarities to develop a robust multilingual APE model. To facilitate cross-linguistic transfer, we generate synthetic Hindi-Marathi and Marathi-Hindi APE triplets. Additionally, we incorporate a Quality Estimation (QE)-APE multi-task learning framework. While the experimental results underline the complementary nature of APE and QE, we also observe that QE-APE multitask learning facilitates effective domain adaptation. Our experiments demonstrate that the multilingual APE models outperform their corresponding English-Hindi and English-Marathi single-pair models by 2.5 and 2.39 TER points, respectively, with further notable improvements over the multilingual APE model observed through... | Sourabh Dattatray Deoghare, Diptesh Kanojia, Pushpak Bhattacharyya |  |

Among the approaches for certifying robustness to such adversarial examples, randomized smoothing has emerged as highly promising due to its nature as a wrapper around arbitrary black-box models. Previous work on randomized smoothing in natural language processing has primarily focused on specific subsets of edit distance operations, such as synonym substitution or word insertion, without exploring the certification of all edit operations. In this paper, we adapt Randomized Deletion (Huang et al., 2023) and propose, CERTified Edit Distance defense (CERT-ED) for natural language classification. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that CERT-ED outperforms the existing Hamming distance method RanMASK (Zeng et al., 2023) in 4 out of 5 datasets in terms of both accuracy and the cardinality of the certificate. By covering various threat models, including 5... | Zhuoqun Huang, Neil G. Marchant, Olga Ohrimenko, Benjamin I. P. Rubinstein |  |

Yet, it remains under-explored how to enhance the ability of LLMs to follow complex instructions with multiple constraints. To bridge the gap, we initially study what training data is effective in enhancing complex constraints following abilities. We found that training LLMs with instructions containing multiple constraints enhances their understanding of complex instructions, especially those with lower complexity levels. Additionally, we further propose methods addressing how to obtain and utilize the effective training data. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to prove the effectiveness of our methods in terms of overall performance and training efficiency. We also demonstrate that our methods improve models’ ability to follow instructions generally and generalize effectively across out-of-domain, in domain, and adversarial settings,... | Qianyu He, Jie Zeng, Qianxi He, Jiaqing Liang, Yanghua Xiao |  |

However, these agents are susceptible to undesired planning hallucinations when lacking specific knowledge for expertise-intensive tasks. To address this, preliminary attempts are made to enhance planning reliability by incorporating external workflow-related knowledge. Despite the promise, such infused knowledge is mostly disorganized and diverse in formats, lacking rigorous formalization and comprehensive comparisons. Motivated by this, we formalize different formats of workflow knowledge and present FlowBench, the first benchmark for workflow-guided planning. FlowBench covers 51 different scenarios from 6 domains, with knowledge presented in diverse formats. To assess different LLMs on FlowBench, we design a multi-tiered evaluation framework. We evaluate the efficacy of workflow knowledge across multiple formats, and the results indicate that current LLM... | Ruixuan Xiao, Wentao Ma, Ke Wang, Yuchuan Wu, Junbo Zhao, Haobo Wang, Fei Huang, Yongbin Li |  |

Mental disorder prediction from social media posts by current LLMs is challenging due to the complexities of sequential text data and the limited context length of language models. Current language model-based approaches split a single data instance into multiple chunks to compensate for limited context size. The predictive model is then applied to each chunk individually, and the most voted output is selected as the final prediction. This results in the loss of inter-post dependencies and important time variant information, leading to poor performance. We propose a novel framework which first compresses the large sequence of chronologically ordered social media posts into a series of numbers. We then use this time variant representation for mental disorder classification. We demonstrate the generalization capabilities of our framework by outperforming the current SOTA in... | Raja Kumar, Kishan Maharaj, Ashita Saxena, Pushpak Bhattacharyya |  |

While existing evaluations of ALLMs primarily focus on single-audio tasks, real-world applications often involve processing multiple audio streams simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we propose the first multi-audio evaluation (MAE) benchmark that consists of 20 datasets from 11 multi-audio tasks encompassing both speech and sound scenarios. Comprehensive experiments on MAE demonstrate that the existing ALLMs, while being powerful in comprehending primary audio elements in individual audio inputs, struggling to handle multi-audio scenarios. To this end, we propose a novel multi-audio-LLM (MALLM) to capture audio context among multiple similar audios using discriminative learning on our proposed synthetic data. The results demonstrate that the proposed MALLM outperforms all baselines and achieves high data efficiency using synthetic data without... | Yiming Chen, Xianghu Yue, Xiaoxue Gao, Chen Zhang, Luis Fernando D'Haro, Robby T.

However, the potential of providing instructions informed by texts and images to assist humans in completing tasks remains underexplored. To uncover this capability, we present the multimodal procedural planning (MPP) task, in which models are given a high-level goal and generate plans of paired text-image steps, providing more complementary and informative guidance than unimodal plans. The key challenges of MPP are to ensure the informativeness, temporal coherence,and accuracy of plans across modalities. To tackle this, we propose Text-Image Prompting (TIP), a dual-modality prompting method that jointly leverages zero-shot reasoning ability in large language models (LLMs) and compelling text-to-image generation ability from diffusion-based models. TIP improves the interaction in the dual modalities using Text-to-Image Bridge and Image-to-Text Bridge, allowing LLMs to guide the... | Yujie Lu, Pan Lu, Zhiyu Chen, Wanrong Zhu, Xin Wang, William Yang Wang |  |

This paper introduces specification instructions: text descriptions specifying fine-grained task-specific behaviors. For each functionality in a suite, we generate an instruction that describes it. We combine the specification instructions to create specification-augmented prompts, which we feed to language models pre-trained on natural instruction data.We conduct experiments to measure how optimizing for some functionalities may negatively impact functionalities that are not covered by the specification set. Our analyses across four tasks and models of diverse sizes and families show that smaller models struggle to follow specification instructions. However, larger models (> 3B params.) can benefit from specifications and—surprisingly—even generalize certain desirable behaviors across... | Pedro Henrique Luz de Araujo, Benjamin Roth |  |

Such NMT systems should be lexically constrained and draw from domain-specific dictionaries. Dictionaries could present multiple candidate translations for a source word/phrase due to the polysemous nature of words. The onus is then on the NMT model to choose the contextually most appropriate candidate. Prior work has largely ignored this problem and focused on the single candidate constraint setting wherein the target word or phrase is replaced by a single constraint. In this work, we present DictDis, a lexically constrained NMT system that disambiguates between multiple candidate translations derived from dictionaries. We achieve this by augmenting training data with multiple dictionary candidates to actively encourage disambiguation during training by implicitly... | Ayush Maheshwari, Preethi Jyothi, Ganesh Ramakrishnan |  |

This instability mainly originates from randomness in initialisation or data shuffling. To address this, researchers either modify the training process or augment the available samples, which typically results in increased computational costs. We propose a new mitigation strategy, called \*\*Delayed Ensemble with Noisy Interpolation (DENI)\*\*, that leverages the strengths of ensembling, noise regularisation and model interpolation, while retaining computational efficiency. We compare DENI with 9 representative mitigation strategies across 3 models, 4 tuning strategies and 7 text classification datasets. We show that: 1) DENI outperforms the best performing mitigation strategy (Ensemble), while using only a fraction of its cost; 2) the mitigation strategies are beneficial for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods,... | Branislav Pecher, Ján Cegin, Róbert Belanec, Jakub Simko, Ivan Srba, Mária Bieliková |  |

Due to these capabilities, many recent methods are proposed to automatically refine the codes with LLMs. However, we should rethink that the refined codes (from LLMs and even humans) are not always more efficient than their original versions. On the other hand, running two different versions of codes and comparing them every time is not ideal and time-consuming. Therefore, in this work, we propose a novel method based on the code language model that is trained to judge the efficiency between two different codes (generated across humans and machines) by either classifying the superior one or predicting the relative improvement. We validate our method on multiple programming languages with multiple refinement steps, demonstrating that the proposed method can effectively distinguish between more and less efficient versions of code. | Minju Seo, Jinheon Baek, Sung Ju Hwang |  |

To mitigate the additional computational and financial costs associated with in-context learning, several prompt compression methods have been proposed to compress the in-context learning prompts. Despite their success, these methods face challenges with transferability due to model-specific compression, or rely on external training data, such as GPT-4. In this paper, we investigate the ability of LLMs to develop a unified compression method that discretizes uninformative tokens, utilizing a self-supervised pre-training technique. By introducing a small number of parameters during the continual pre-training, the proposed Selection-p produces a probability for each input token, indicating whether to preserve or discard it. Experiments show Selection-p achieves state-of-the-art performance across numerous classification tasks,... | Tsz Ting Chung, Leyang Cui, Lemao Liu, Xinting Huang, Shuming Shi, DitYan Yeung |  |

Unlike previous small models (e.g., BART, T5), current LLMs make fewer silly mistakes but more sophisticated ones, such as imposing cause and effect, adding false details, overgeneralizing, etc. These hallucinations are challenging to detect through traditional methods, which poses great challenges for improving the factual consistency of text summarization. In this paper, we propose Contrastive Preference Optimization (CPO) to disentangle the LLMs’ propensities to generate faithful and fake content. Furthermore, we adopt a probing-based specific training method to improve their capacity of distinguishing two types of propensities. In this way, LLMs can execute the instructions more accurately and have enhanced perception of hallucinations. Experimental results show... | Huawen Feng, Yan Fan, Xiong Liu, TingEn Lin, Zekun Yao, Yuchuan Wu, Fei Huang, Yongbin Li, Qianli Ma |  |

However, current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) primarily focus on third-person view videos, neglecting the richness of egocentric perceptual experience. To address this gap, we propose three key contributions. First, we introduce the Egocentric Video Understanding Dataset (EVUD) for training VLMs on video captioning and question answering tasks specific to egocentric videos. Second, we present , a 7B parameter VLM trained using parameter-efficient methods on EVUD. Finally, we evaluate ‘s capabilities on OpenEQA, a challenging benchmark for embodied video question answering. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming open-source models including strong Socratic models using GPT-4 as a planner by 3.6%.Additionally, we outperform Claude 3 and Gemini Pro Vision 1.0 and showcase competitive results compared to Gemini Pro 1.5 and GPT-4V, even... | Alessandro Suglia, Claudio Greco, Katie Baker, Jose L.

This work deals with the impact of unique platform characteristics on the performance of topic models and proposes a new approach to enhance the effectiveness of topic modeling. The data utilized in this study consisted of a total of 1.5 million posts collected using the keyword ”ChatGPT” on the three social media platforms. The devised model reduces platform influence in topic models by developing a platform-invariant contrastive learning algorithm and removing platform-specific jargon word sets. The proposed approach was thoroughly validated through quantitative and qualitative experiments alongside standard and state-of-the-art topic models and showed its supremacy. This method can mitigate... | Minseo Koo, Doeun Kim, Sungwon Han, Sungkyu Park |  |

However, due to the lack of high-quality large-scale data, event factuality detection is under-explored in event understanding research, which limits the development of EFD community. To address these issues and provide faithful event understanding, we introduce MAVEN-FACT, a large-scale and high-quality EFD dataset based on the MAVEN dataset. MAVEN-FACT includes factuality annotations of 112,276 events, making it the largest EFD dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAVEN-FACT is challenging for both conventional fine-tuned models and large language models (LLMs). Thanks to the comprehensive annotations of event arguments and relations in MAVEN, MAVEN-FACT also supports some further analyses and we find that adopting event arguments and... | Chunyang Li, Hao Peng, Xiaozhi Wang, Yunjia Qi, Lei Hou, Bin Xu, Juanzi Li |  |

In this work, we investigate the use of large language models (LLMs) to predict the sequence of actions taken by the Builder. Leveraging LLMs’ in-context learning abilities, we use few-shot prompting techniques, that significantly improve performance over baseline methods.

However, despite these advancements, the tasks of extracting sentiment quadruplets, which capture the nuanced sentiment expressions within a sentence, remain significant challenges. In particular, compound sentences can potentially contain multiple quadruplets, making the extraction task increasingly difficult as sentence complexity grows. To address this issue, we are focusing on simplifying sentence structures to facilitate the easier recognition of these elements and crafting a model that integrates seamlessly with various ABSA tasks. In this paper, we propose Aspect Term Oriented Sentence Splitter (ATOSS), which simplifies compound sentence into simpler and clearer forms, thereby clarifying their structure and intent. As a plug-and-play module, this approach retains the parameters of the ABSA model while making it easier to identify... | Yongsik Seo, Sungwon Song, Ryang Heo, Jieyong Kim, Dongha Lee |  |

Inspired by the theory of “Learning from Errors”, this framework employs an instructor LLM to meticulously analyze the specific errors within a target model, facilitating targeted and efficient training cycles. Within this framework, we implement two strategies: “Learning from Error,” which focuses solely on incorrect responses to tailor training data, and “Learning from Error by Contrast,” which uses contrastive learning to analyze both correct and incorrect responses for a deeper understanding of errors. Our empirical studies, conducted with several open-source models, demonstrate significant improvements across multiple benchmarks, including mathematical reasoning, coding abilities, and factual knowledge. Notably, the refined Llama-3-8b-Instruction has outperformed ChatGPT, illustrating the... | Jiahao Ying, Mingbao Lin, Yixin Cao, Wei Tang, Bo Wang, Qianru Sun, Xuanjing Huang, Shuicheng Yan |  |

Recent advances in both tasks generate a structured representation of the information in an autoregressive manner, a time-consuming and computationally expensive approach. This naturally raises the question of whether autoregressive methods are necessary in order to achieve comparable results. In this work, we propose ITER, an efficient encoder-based relation extraction model, that performs the task in three parallelizable steps, greatly accelerating a recent language modeling approach: ITER achieves an inference throughput of over 600 samples per second for a large model on a single consumer-grade GPU. Furthermore, we achieve state-of-the-art results on the relation extraction datasets ADE and ACE05, and demonstrate competitive performance for both named entity recognition with GENIA and CoNLL03, and for relation extraction with SciERC and CoNLL04. | Moritz Hennen, Florian Babl, Michaela Geierhos |  |

Persuasive chatbots employed responsibly for social good can be an enabler of positive individual and social change. Existing methods rely on fine-tuning persuasive chatbots with task-specific training data which is costly, if not infeasible, to collect. Furthermore, they employ only a handful of pre-defined persuasion strategies. We propose PersuaBot, a zero-shot chatbot based on Large Language Models (LLMs) that is factual and more persuasive by leveraging many more nuanced strategies. PersuaBot uses an LLM to first generate a natural responses, from which the strategies used are extracted. To combat hallucination of LLMs, Persuabot replace any unsubstantiated claims in the response with retrieved facts supporting the extracted strategies. We applied our chatbot, PersuaBot, to three significantly different domains needing persuasion skills: donation solicitation,... | Kazuaki Furumai, Roberto Legaspi, Julio Romero, Yudai Yamazaki, Yasutaka Nishimura, Sina J.

However, they still face challenges with hard samples, which refer to instances where the model exhibits diminished confidence in distinguishing new samples. Existing research has addressed related issues, but often overlooks the semantic information inherent in the labels, treating them merely as one-hot vectors. In this paper, we propose Logits Reranking via Semantic Labels (LRSL), a model-agnostic post-processing method that leverages label semantics and auto detection of hard samples to improve classification accuracy. LRSL automatically identifies hard samples, which are then jointly processed by MLP-based and Similarity-based approaches. Applied only during inference, LRSL operates solely on classification logits, reranking them based on semantic similarities without interfering with the model’s training process. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing... | Peijie Huang, Junbao Huang, Yuhong Xu, Weizhen Li, Xisheng Xiao |  |

However, the behaviors of LLM fact memorization remain under-explored. In this paper, we analyze the scaling laws for LLM’s fact knowledge and LLMs’ behaviors of memorizing different types of facts. We find that LLMs’ fact knowledge capacity has a linear and negative exponential law relationship with model size and training epochs, respectively. Estimated by the built scaling law, memorizing the whole Wikidata’s facts requires training an LLM with 1000B non-embed parameters for 100 epochs, suggesting that using LLMs to memorize all public facts is almost implausible for a general pre-training setting. Meanwhile, we find that LLMs can generalize on unseen fact knowledge and its scaling law is similar to general pre-training. Additionally, we analyze the compatibility and preference of LLMs’ fact memorization. For compatibility, we find LLMs struggle with memorizing... | Xingyu Lu, Xiaonan Li, Qinyuan Cheng, Kai Ding, Xuanjing Huang, Xipeng Qiu |  |

We argue that although the web-crawled data often has formatting errors causing semantic inaccuracies, it can still serve as a valuable source for high-quality supervised fine-tuning in specific domains without relying on advanced models like GPT-4. To this end, we create a paired training dataset automatically by aligning web-crawled data with a smaller set of high-quality data. By training a language model on this dataset, we can convert web data with irregular formats into high-quality ones. Our experiments show that training with the model-transformed data yields better results, surpassing training with only high-quality data by an average score of 9.4% in Chinese math problems. Additionally, our 7B model outperforms several open-source models larger than 32B and surpasses well-known closed-source models such as... | Jing Zhou, Chenglin Jiang, Wei Shen, Xiao Zhou, Xiaonan He |  |

Weight-only quantization has emerged as a promising solution to address these challenges. Previous research suggests that fine-tuning through up and down rounding can enhance performance. In this study, we introduce SignRound, a method that utilizes signed gradient descent (SignSGD) to optimize rounding values and weight clipping within just 200 steps. SignRound integrates the advantages of Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) and Post-Training Quantization (PTQ), achieving exceptional results across 2 to 4 bits while maintaining low tuning costs and avoiding additional inference overhead. For example, SignRound achieves absolute average accuracy improvements ranging from 6.91% to 33.22% at 2 bits, as measured by the average zero-shot accuracy across 11 tasks.

Here, we show that they can be used to answer exam questions simulating students of different skill levels and share a prompt, engineered for GPT-3.5, that enables the simulation of varying student skill levels on questions from different educational domains. We evaluate the proposed prompt on three publicly available datasets (one from science exams and two from English reading comprehension exams) and three LLMs (two versions of GPT-3.5 and one of GPT-4), and show that it is robust to different educational domains and capable of generalising to data unseen during the prompt engineering phase. We also show that, being engineered for a specific version of GPT-3.5, the prompt does not generalise well to different LLMs, stressing the need for prompt engineering for each model in practical applications. Lastly, we find that there is not a direct correlation between the quality of the... | Luca Benedetto, Giovanni Aradelli, Antonia Donvito, Alberto Lucchetti, Andrea Cappelli, Paula Buttery |  |

However, existing methods for Heart Sound Diagnosis (HSD) tasks are predominantly limited to a few fixed categories, framing the HSD task as a rigid classification problem that does not fully align with medical practice and offers only limited information to physicians. Besides, such methods do not utilize echocardiography reports, the gold standard in the diagnosis of related diseases. To tackle this challenge, we introduce HSDreport, a new benchmark for HSD, which mandates the direct utilization of heart sounds obtained from auscultation to predict echocardiography reports. This benchmark aims to merge the convenience of auscultation with the comprehensive nature of echocardiography reports. First, we collect a new dataset for this benchmark, comprising 2,275 heart sound samples along with their corresponding reports.

For example, homophenes, words that share identical lip movements but produce different sounds, can be distinguished by considering the context. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, namely Visual Speech Processing incorporated with LLMs (VSP-LLM), to maximize the context modeling ability by bringing the overwhelming power of LLMs. Specifically, VSP-LLM is designed to perform multi-tasks of visual speech recognition and translation, where the given instructions control the type of task. The input video is mapped to the input latent space of an LLM by employing a self-supervised visual speech model. Focused on the fact that there is redundant information in input frames, we propose a novel deduplication method that reduces the embedded visual features by employing visual speech units. Through the proposed deduplication and low rank... | Jeong Hun Yeo, Seunghee Han, Minsu Kim, Yong Man Ro |  |

For instance, whether a student is eligible for a scholarship depends on eligibility conditions, such as major or degree required. ConditionalQA was proposed to evaluate models’ capability of reading a document and answering eligibility questions, considering \*unmentioned\* conditions. However, it is limited to questions on single documents, neglecting harder cases that may require \*cross-document reasoning\* and \*optimization\*, for example, “What is the maximum number of scholarships attainable?” Such questions over multiple documents are not only more challenging due to more context to understand, but also because the model has to (1) explore all possible combinations of unmentioned conditions and (2) understand the relationship between conditions across documents, to reason about the optimal outcome.

Exploring Decision-Making Under Pressure](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.findings-emnlp.668) |  | 0 | Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their ability to simulate human-like decision-making, yet the impact of psychological pressures on their decision-making processes remains underexplored. To understand how psychological pressures influence decision-making in LLMs, we tested LLMs on various high-level tasks, using both explicit and implicit pressure prompts. Moreover, we examined LLM responses under different personas to compare with human behavior under pressure. Our findings show that pressures significantly affect LLMs’ decision-making, varying across tasks and models. Persona-based analysis suggests some models exhibit human-like sensitivity to pressure, though with some variability. Furthermore, by analyzing both the responses and reasoning patterns, we identified the values LLMs prioritize under specific social pressures. These insights deepen our understanding of LLM behavior and demonstrate the potential for more realistic social simulation... | Kyusik Kim, Hyeonseok Jeon, Jeongwoo Ryu, Bongwon Suh |  |

However, they often suffer from human reporting bias inherent in textual commonsense knowledge, leading to discrepancies in understanding between PLMs and humans. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by introducing an additional information channel to PLMs. We propose Imagine (Machine Imagination-based Reasoning), a novel zero-shot commonsense reasoning framework designed to complement textual inputs with visual signals derived from machine-generated images. To achieve this, we enhance PLMs with imagination capabilities by incorporating an image generator into the reasoning process. To guide PLMs in effectively leveraging machine imagination, we create a synthetic pre-training dataset that simulates visual question-answering.

Knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) is a typical benchmark to evaluate the methods enhancing LLMs with KG. Previous methods on KG-enhanced LLM for KGQA either enhance LLMs with KG retrieval in a single round or perform multi-hop KG reasoning in multiple rounds with LLMs. Both of them conduct retrieving and reasoning based solely on the whole original question, without any processing to the question. To tackle this limitation, we propose a framework of KG-enhanced LLM based on question decomposition and atomic retrieval, called KELDaR. We introduce question decomposition tree as the framework for LLM reasoning. This approach extracts the implicit information of reasoning steps within complex questions, serving as a guide to facilitate atomic retrieval on KG targeting the atomic-level simple questions at leaves of the tree.

Furthermore, the use of cross-modal relation detection modules to eliminate noise from comprehensive image representations leads to the omission of subtle contextual information. In this paper, we present a Visual Connotation and Aesthetic Attributes Understanding Network (Vanessa) for Multimodal Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis. Concretely, Vanessa incorporates a Multi-Aesthetic Attributes Aggregation (MA3) module that models intra- and inter-dependencies among bi-modal representations as well as emotion-laden aesthetic attributes. Moreover, we devise a self-supervised contrastive learning framework to explore the pairwise relevance between images and text via the Gaussian distribution of their CLIP scores.

Most of these are constructed using real-world data. It has been shown that RE models trained on real-world data suffer from factual biases. To evaluate and address this issue, we present CovEReD, a counterfactual data generation approach for document-level relation extraction datasets using entity replacement. We first demonstrate that models trained on factual data exhibit inconsistent behavior: while they accurately extract triples from factual data, they fail to extract the same triples after counterfactual modification. This inconsistency suggests that models trained on factual data rely on spurious signals such as specific entities and external knowledge – rather than on context – to extract triples. We show that by generating document-level counterfactual data with CovEReD and training models on them, consistency is maintained with minimal impact on RE performance.

To address this issue, we introduces an adversarial attack method called FuncFooler, which focuses on perturbing critical code to generate multiple variants of the same function. These variants are then used to retrain the model to enhance its robustness. Current adversarial attacks against LB-BCSD mainly draw inspiration from the FGSM (Fast Gradient Sign Method) method in the image domain, which involves generating adversarial bytes and appending them to the end of the executable file. However, this approach has a significant drawback: the appended bytes do not affect the actual code of the executable file, thus failing to create diverse code variants.

We crowd-source real-world diet-related struggles, then work with nutrition experts to generate supportive text using ChatGPT. Finally, experts evaluate the safety and text quality of ChatGPT’s output. The result is the HAI-coaching dataset, containing ~2.4K crowdsourced dietary struggles and ~97K corresponding ChatGPT-generated and expert-annotated supportive texts.

However, with the rise of recent code generation agents built upon large language models (LLMs), a question emerges: is this traditional practice equally effective for these new tools? In this work, we assess the impact of modularity in code generation by introducing a novel metric for its quantitative measurement. Surprisingly, unlike conventional wisdom on the topic, we find that modularity is not a core factor for improving the performance of code generation models. We also explore potential explanations for why LLMs do not exhibit a preference for modular code compared to non-modular code. | Deokyeong Kang, Ki Jung Seo, Taeuk Kim |  |

Previous approaches often use autoregressive (AR) models and treat the length requirement as a soft constraint, which may not always be satisfied. In this study, we propose a novel length-control decoding algorithm based on the directed acyclic Transformer (DAT). Our approach allows for multiple plausible sequence fragments and predicts a path to connect them. In addition, we propose a Sequence Maximum a Posteriori (Seq-MAP) decoding algorithm that marginalizes different possible paths and finds the most probable summary satisfying the length budget. Our algorithm is based on beam search, which further facilitates a reranker for performance improvement. Experimental results on the Gigaword dataset demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance for length-control summarization. | Chenyang Huang, Hao Zhou, Cameron Jen, Kangjie Zheng, Osmar R.

However, a semantic gap exists between LLMs and retrievers due to differences in their training objectives and architectures. This misalignment forces LLMs to passively accept the documents provided by the retrievers, leading to incomprehension in the generation process, where the LLMs are burdened with the task of distinguishing these documents using their inherent knowledge. This paper proposes R2AG, a novel enhanced RAG framework to fill this gap by incorporating \*\*R\*\*etrieval information into \*\*R\*\*etrieval \*\*A\*\*ugmented \*\*G\*\*eneration. Specifically, R2AG utilizes the nuanced features from the retrievers and employs a R2-Former to capture retrieval information. Then, a retrieval-aware prompting strategy is designed to integrate retrieval information into LLMs’ generation. Notably, R2AG suits low-source... | Fuda Ye, Shuangyin Li, Yongqi Zhang, Lei Chen |  |

This task is not only challenging for models, but also very difficult to evaluate with automatic metrics since there is no consensus about what makes a story ‘good’. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that measures story quality in terms of human likeness regarding three key aspects highlighted in previous work: visual grounding, coherence, and repetitiveness. We then use this method to evaluate the stories generated by several models, showing that the foundation model LLaVA obtains the best result, but only slightly so compared to TAPM, a 50-times smaller visual storytelling model. Upgrading the visual and language components of TAPM results in a model that yields competitive performance with a relatively low number of parameters. Finally, we carry out a human evaluation study, whose results suggest that a ‘good’ story may require more than a human-like level of... | Aditya Kaushik Surikuchi, Raquel Fernández, Sandro Pezzelle |  |

This effect is yet to be examined for transgender and non-binary identities, whose frequent marginalization may exacerbate harmful system behaviors. Addressing this gap, we first create TRANsCRIPT, a corpus of YouTube transcripts from transgender, cisgender, and non-binary speakers. Using this dataset, we probe various PLMs to assess if they encode the gender identity information, examining both frozen and fine-tuned representations as well as representations for inputs with author-specific words removed. Our findings reveal that PLM representations encode information for all gender identities but to different extents. The divergence is most pronounced for cis women and non-binary individuals, underscoring the critical need for gender-inclusive approaches to NLP systems. | Urban Knuples, Agnieszka Falenska, Filip Miletic |  |

While some LLMs have been trained on multilingual data, most of the training data is in English; hence, their performance in English greatly exceeds other languages. To our knowledge, we are the first to collect and translate a large collection of texts, instructions, and benchmarks and train, evaluate, and release open-source LLMs tailored for Romanian. We evaluate our methods on four different categories, including academic benchmarks, MT-Bench (manually translated), and a professionally built historical, cultural, and social benchmark adapted to Romanian. We argue for the usefulness and high performance of RoLLMs by obtaining state-of-the-art results across the board. We publicly release all resources (i.e., data, training and evaluation code, models) with the goal of supporting and encouraging research on Romanian LLMs while concurrently creating a generalizable recipe... | Mihai Masala, Denis C.

Our framework provides a formal definition of anticipatory and responsive measures, and it equips experimenters with the tools to define new, more expressive measures beyond standard next-symbol entropy and surprisal. While extracting these standard quantities from language models is convenient, we demonstrate that using Monte Carlo simulation to estimate alternative responsive and anticipatory measures pays off empirically: New special cases of our generalized formula exhibit enhanced predictive power compared to surprisal for human cloze completion probability as well as ELAN, LAN, and N400 amplitudes, and greater complementarity with surprisal in predicting reading times. | Mario Giulianelli, Andreas Opedal, Ryan Cotterell |  |

Robust moderation is essential for mitigating these negative impacts and maintaining a healthy and constructive community atmosphere. However, effectively addressing trolls is difficult because their behaviors vary widely and require different response strategies (RSs) to counter them. This diversity makes it challenging to choose an appropriate RS for each specific situation.To address this challenge, our research investigates whether humans have preferred strategies tailored to different types of trolling behaviors.Our findings reveal a correlation between the types of trolling encountered and the preferred RS. In this paper, we introduce a methodology for generating counter-responses to trolls by recommending appropriate RSs, supported by a dataset aligning these strategies with human preferences... | Huije Lee, Hoyun Song, Jisu Shin, Sukmin Cho, SeungYoon Han, Jong Park |  |

However, most frameworks leverage benchmarks that assess older chatbots on aspects such as fluency and relevance, which are not reflective of the challenges associated with contemporary models. In fact, a qualitative analysis on Soda. (Kim et al., 2023), a GPT-3.5 generated dialogue dataset, suggests that current chatbots may exhibit several recurring issues related to coherence and commonsense knowledge, but generally produce highly fluent and relevant responses.Noting the aforementioned limitations, this paper introduces Soda-Eval, an annotated dataset based on Soda that covers over 120K turn-level assessments across 10K dialogues, where the annotations were generated by GPT-4. Using Soda-Eval as a benchmark, we then study the performance of several open-access instruction-tuned LLMs,... | John Mendonça, Isabel Trancoso, Alon Lavie |  |

However, the proliferation of FMs brings forth a critical challenge: the potential to generate hallucinated outputs, particularly in high-stakes applications. The tendency of foundation models to produce hallucinated content arguably represents the biggest hindrance to their widespread adoption in real-world scenarios, especially in domains where reliability and accuracy are paramount. This survey paper presents a comprehensive overview of recent developments that aim to identify and mitigate the problem of hallucination in FMs, spanning text, image, video, and audio modalities. By synthesizing recent advancements in detecting and mitigating hallucination across various modalities, the paper aims to provide valuable insights for researchers, developers, and practitioners. Essentially, it establishes a clear framework encompassing... | Pranab Sahoo, Prabhash Meharia, Akash Ghosh, Sriparna Saha, Vinija Jain, Aman Chadha |  |

We present a novel model that establishes upper and lower bounds on the accuracy, without requiring gold labels for the unseen data. We achieve this by training a \*discriminator\* which predicts whether the output of a given sequence-to-sequence model is correct or not. We show across a variety of tagging, parsing, and semantic parsing tasks that the gold accuracy is reliably between the predicted upper and lower bounds, and that these bounds are remarkably close together. | Yuekun Yao, Alexander Koller |  |

We introduce FastMem, a novel method designed to enhance instruction fine-tuned LLMs’ context awareness through fast memorization of the prompt. FastMem maximizes the likelihood of the prompt before inference by updating only the last Feed-Forward Network (FFN) module. This targeted approach ensures efficient optimization without overfitting, significantly improving the model’s ability to comprehend and accurately follow the context. Our experiments demonstrate substantial gains in reading comprehension, text summarization and adherence to output structures. For instance, FastMem improves the accuracy of Llama 3-8B-Inst on the NQ-SWAP dataset from 59.1% to 71.6%, and reduces the output structure failure rate of Qwen 1.5-4B-Chat from 34.9% to 25.5%.

In reality, several factors such as the cost of running baseline, private systems, computational limitations, or incomplete data may prevent some systems from being evaluated on entire tasks. This paper formalize an existing problem in NLP research: benchmarking when some systems scores are missing on the task, and proposes a novel approach to address it. Our method utilizes a compatible partial ranking approach to impute missing data, which is then aggregated using the Borda count method. It includes two refinements designed specifically for scenarios where either task-level or instance-level scores are available. We also introduce an extended benchmark, which contains over 131 million scores, an order of magnitude larger than existing benchmarks.

However, they still fall short of reflecting real-world conversation scenarios. Current dialogue systems exhibit an inability to replicate the dynamic, continuous, long-term interactions involving multiple partners. This shortfall arises because there have been limited efforts to account for both aspects of real-world dialogues: deeply layered interactions over the long-term dialogue and widely expanded conversation networks involving multiple participants. As the effort to incorporate these aspects combined, we introduce Mixed-Session Conversation, a dialogue system designed to construct conversations with various partners in a multi-session dialogue setup. We propose a new dataset called MiSC to implement this system. The dialogue episodes of MiSC consist of 6 consecutive sessions, with four speakers (one main speaker and three partners) appearing in each episode. Also, we propose a new dialogue model with a... | Jihyoung Jang, Taeyoung Kim, Hyounghun Kim |  |

With the rapid evolution of LLMs, the potential for leveraging these models to autonomously generate QA pairs has become apparent, particularly through the use of large-scale models like GPT-4. However, the computational demands and associated costs often render such approaches prohibitive for the average researcher. Addressing this gap, we introduce the Collaborative Small Language Model Framework (CSLM), an innovative solution that combines a group of small-scaled, open-source LLMs to collaboratively produce QA pairs. Experiments on datasets of various domains show that CSLM unleashes the full potential of diverse small models to generate high-quality QA pairs, making it accessible to a broader range of researchers. | Yiming Wang, Yang Liu, Lingchen Wang, An Xiao |  |

To address these challenges, it is crucial to develop large-scale benchmarks that can comprehensively assess the performance of LLMs in basic language tasks. In this paper, we introduce a bilingual benchmark, CWUM, to investigate the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in understanding and manipulating natural language at both character and word levels. CWUM consists of 15 simple text editing tasks, e.g., letter counting, word reversing, Chinese character inserting, etc. We conduct extensive experiments on eight advanced LLMs, including base models and instruction-tuned (chat) variants.

Current jailbreak attacks face two main challenges: low success rates due to defensive measures and high resource requirements for crafting specific prompts. This paper introduces Virtual Context, which leverages special tokens, previously overlooked in LLM security, to improve jailbreak attacks. Virtual Context addresses these challenges by significantly increasing the success rates of existing jailbreak methods and requiring minimal background knowledge about the target model, thus enhancing effectiveness in black-box settings without additional overhead. Comprehensive evaluations show that Virtual Context-assisted jailbreak attacks can improve the success rates of four widely used jailbreak methods by approximately 40% across various LLMs. Additionally, applying Virtual Context to original malicious... | Yuqi Zhou, Lin Lu, Ryan Sun, Pan Zhou, Lichao Sun |  |

However, existing self-detection approaches only retrospectively evaluate answers generated by LLM, typically leading to the over-trust in incorrectly generated answers. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel self-detection paradigm that considers the comprehensive answer space beyond LLM-generated answers. It thoroughly compares the trustworthiness of multiple candidate answers to mitigate the over-trust in LLM-generated incorrect answers. Building upon this paradigm, we introduce a two-step framework, which firstly instructs LLM to reflect and provide justifications for each candidate answer, and then aggregates the justifications for comprehensive target answer evaluation. This framework can be seamlessly integrated with existing approaches for superior self-detection. Extensive... | Moxin Li, Wenjie Wang, Fuli Feng, Fengbin Zhu, Qifan Wang, TatSeng Chua |  |

One of the key characteristics of this type of text is the requirement to split sentences into smaller grammatical segments, to facilitate reading. Automated segmentation methods could foster the creation of Easy Read content, but their viability has yet to be addressed. In this work, we study novel methods for the task, leveraging masked and generative language models, along with constituent parsing. We conduct comprehensive automatic and human evaluations in three languages, analysing the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed alternatives, under scarce resource limitations. Our results highlight the viability of automated Easy Read segmentation and remaining deficiencies compared to expert-driven human segmentation. | Jesus Calleja, Thierry Etchegoyhen, Antonio David Ponce Martínez |  |

We start by making a key observation that data is instrumental in the developmental (e.g., pretraining and fine-tuning) and inferential stages (e.g., in-context learning) of LLMs, and advocate that data-centric research should receive more attention from the community. We identify four specific scenarios centered around data, covering data-centric benchmarks and data curation, data attribution, knowledge transfer, and inference contextualization. In each scenario, we underscore the importance of data, highlight promising research directions, and articulate the potential impacts on the research community and, where applicable, the society as a whole. For instance, we advocate for a suite of data-centric benchmarks tailored to the scale and complexity of data for LLMs. These benchmarks can be used to develop new data curation methods and document research efforts and results,... | Xinyi Xu, Zhaoxuan Wu, Rui Qiao, Arun Verma, Yao Shu, Jingtan Wang, Xinyuan Niu, Zhenfeng He, Jiangwei Chen, Zijian Zhou, Gregory Kang Ruey Lau, Hieu Dao, Lucas Agussurja, Rachael Hwee Ling Sim, Xiaoqiang Lin, Wenyang Hu, Zhongxiang Dai, Pang Wei Koh, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low |  |

To be educational, problems must be solvable, have accurate answers, and, most importantly, be educationally appropriate. We propose that language models have potential to support K-8 math education by automatically generating word problems. However, evaluating educational appropriateness is hard to quantify. We fill this gap by having teachers evaluate problems generated by LLMs, who find existing models and data often fail to be educationally appropriate. We then explore automatically generating \*educational\* word problems, ultimately using our expert annotations to finetune a 70B language model. Our model, MATHWELL, is the first K-8 word problem generator targeted at educational appropriateness. Further expert studies find MATHWELL generates problems far more solvable, accurate, and appropriate than public models. MATHWELL also matches GPT-4’s problem... | Bryan R.

Nonetheless, the resilience of LLMs to handle text containing inherent errors, stemming from human interactions and collaborative systems, has not been thoroughly explored. Our study investigates the resilience of LLMs against five common types of disruptions including 1) ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) errors, 2) OCR (Optical Character Recognition) errors, 3) grammatical mistakes, 4) typographical errors, and 5) distractive content. We aim to investigate how these models react by deliberately embedding these errors into instructions. Our findings reveal that while some LLMs show a degree of resistance to certain types of noise, their overall performance significantly suffers. This emphasizes the importance of further investigation into enhancing model resilience. In response to... | Bin Wang, Chengwei Wei, Zhengyuan Liu, Geyu Lin, Nancy F. Chen |  |

Previous work utilize LLMs to generate query statements on Knowledge Bases (KBs) for retrieving answers. However, LLMs often generate incorrect query statements due to the lack of relevant knowledge in the previous methods. To address this, we propose a framework called Augmenting Reasoning Capabilities of LLMs with Graph Structures in Knowledge Base Question Answering (ARG-KBQA), which retrieves question-related graph structures to improve the performance of LLMs. Unlike other methods that directly retrieve relations or triples from KBs, we introduce an unsupervised two-stage ranker to perform multi-hop beam search on KBs, which could provide LLMs with more relevant information to the questions. Experimental results demonstrate that ARG-KBQA sets a new state-of-the-art on GrailQA and WebQSP under the few-shot setting.... | Yuhang Tian, Dandan Song, Zhijing Wu, Changzhi Zhou, Hao Wang, Jun Yang, Jing Xu, Ruanmin Cao, Haoyu Wang |  |

Most prior works focus on monolingual knowledge editing in English, even though new information can emerge in any language from any part of the world. We propose the Cross-Lingual Multi-Hop Knowledge Editing paradigm, for measuring and analyzing the performance of various SoTA knowledge editing techniques in a cross-lingual setup. Specifically, we create a parallel cross-lingual benchmark, CroLin-MQuAKE for measuring the knowledge editing capabilities. Our extensive analysis over various knowledge editing techniques uncover significant gaps in performance between the cross-lingual and English-centric setting. Following this, we propose a significantly improved system for cross-lingual multi-hop knowledge editing, CLeVer-CKE.

Even though the task highly relies on past actions and visual observations, existing studies typically consider little semantic information carried out by intermediate screenshots and screen operations. To address this, this work presents Chain-of-Action-Thought (dubbed CoAT), which takes the description of the previous actions, the current screen, and more importantly the action thinking of what actions should be performed and the outcomes led by the chosen action. We demonstrate that, in a zero-shot setting upon three off-the-shelf LMMs, CoAT significantly improves the action prediction compared to previous proposed context modeling. To further facilitate the research in this line, we construct a dataset Android-In-The-Zoo (AitZ), which contains 18,643 screen-action pairs together with... | Jiwen Zhang, Jihao Wu, Yihua Teng, Minghui Liao, Nuo Xu, Xiao Xiao, Zhongyu Wei, Duyu Tang |  |

This dependency might introduce novel security risks if LMs develop self-recognition capabilities. Inspired by human identity verification methods, we propose a novel approach for assessing self-recognition in LMs using model-generated “security questions”. Our test can be externally administered to keep track of frontier models as it does not require access to internal model parameters or output probabilities. We use our test to examine self-recognition in ten of the most capable open- and closed-source LMs currently publicly available. Our extensive experiments found no empirical evidence of general or consistent self-recognition in any examined LM. Instead, our results suggest that given a set of alternatives, LMs seek to pick the “best” answer, regardless of its origin. Moreover, we find indications that preferences about which models produce the best answers are consistent across... | Tim R.

However, current training approaches combine standard cross-entropy loss with extensive data, human feedback, or ad hoc methods to enhance performance. These solutions are often not scalable or feasible due to their associated costs, complexity, or resource requirements. This study investigates the use of established semantic segmentation loss functions in natural language generation to create a versatile, practical, and scalable solution for fine-tuning different architectures. We evaluate their effectiveness in solving Math Word Problems and question answering across different models of varying sizes. For the analyzed tasks, we found that the traditional Cross-Entropy loss represents a sub-optimal choice, while models trained to minimize alternative (task-dependent) losses, such as Focal or Lovász, achieve a mean improvement of +36% on exact match without requiring additional data or human... | Daniele Rege Cambrin, Giuseppe Gallipoli, Irene Benedetto, Luca Cagliero, Paolo Garza |  |

We investigate how information is conveyed by the general shape of these clouds, instead of representing the semantic meaning of each token. Specifically, we use the notion of persistent homology from topological data analysis (TDA) to measure the distances between language pairs from the shape of their unlabeled embeddings. These distances quantify the degree of non-isometry of the embeddings. To distinguish whether these differences are random training errors or capture real information about the languages, we use the computed distance matrices to construct language phylogenetic trees over 81 Indo-European languages. Careful evaluation shows that our reconstructed trees exhibit strong and statistically-significant similarities to the reference. | Ondrej Draganov, Steven Skiena |  |

LLMs have been trained on a vast corpus of texts from various sources; despite the best efforts during the data pre-processing stage while training the LLMs, they may pick some undesirable information such as personally identifiable information (PII). Consequently, in recent times research in the area of Machine Unlearning (MUL) has become active, the main idea is to force LLMs to forget (unlearn) certain information (e.g., PII) without suffering from performance loss on regular tasks. In this work, we examine the robustness of the existing MUL techniques for their ability to enable leakage-proof forgetting in LLMs. In particular, we examine the effect of data transformation on forgetting, i.e., is an unlearned LLM able to recall forgotten information if there is a change in the format of the input?

Bringing Quantity-awareness to Retrieval Systems](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.findings-emnlp.707) |  | 0 | Quantitative information plays a crucial role in understanding and interpreting the content of documents. Many user queries contain quantities and cannot be resolved without understanding their semantics, e.g., “car that costs less than $10k”. Yet, modern search engines apply the same ranking mechanisms for both words and quantities, overlooking magnitude and unit information. In this paper, we introduce two quantity-aware ranking techniques designed to rank both the quantity and textual content either jointly or independently. These techniques incorporate quantity information in available retrieval systems and can address queries with numerical conditions equal, greater than, and less than. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed models, we introduce two novel quantity-aware benchmark datasets in the domains of finance and medicine and compare our method against various lexical and neural models.

However, existing works focus on (1) image-sharing behavior in singular sessions, leading to limited long-term social interaction, and (2) a lack of personalized image-sharing behavior. In this work, we introduce , a large-scale long-term multi-modal dialogue dataset that covers a wide range of social personas in a multi-modality format, time intervals, and images. To construct automatically, we propose a novel multi-modal contextualization framework, , that generates long-term multi-modal dialogue distilled from ChatGPT and our proposed image aligner. Using our , we train a multi-modal conversation model, 7B, which demonstrates impressive visual imagination ability. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset in human evaluation. The code, dataset, and model will be publicly released after publication. | YoungJun Lee, Dokyong Lee, Junyoung Youn, Kyeongjin Oh, Byungsoo Ko, Jonghwan Hyeon, HoJin Choi |  |

However, existing approaches make light of the importance of high-quality prompt initialization and the identification of effective optimization directions, thus resulting in substantial optimization steps to obtain satisfactory performance. In this light, we aim to accelerate prompt optimization process to tackle the challenge of low convergence rate. We propose a dual-phase approach which starts with generating high-quality initial prompts by adopting a well-designed meta-instruction to delve into task-specific information, and iteratively optimize the prompts at the sentence level, leveraging previous tuning experience to expand prompt candidates and accept effective ones. Extensive experiments on eight datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving a consistent accuracy gain over... | Muchen Yang, Moxin Li, Yongle Li, Zijun Chen, Chongming Gao, Junqi Zhang, Yangyang Li, Fuli Feng |  |

While recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) like GPT-4o have shown promise in high-level ChartQA tasks, such as chart captioning, their effectiveness in low-level ChartQA tasks (\*e.g.\*, identifying correlations) remains underexplored.In this paper, we address this gap by evaluating MLLMs on low-level ChartQA using a newly curated dataset, \*ChartInsights\*, which consists of 22,347 (chart, task, query, answer) covering 10 data analysis tasks across 7 chart types. We systematically evaluate 19 advanced MLLMs, including 12 open-source and 7 closed-source models. The average accuracy rate across these models is 39.8%, with GPT-4o achieving the highest accuracy at 69.17%.To further explore the limitations of MLLMs in low-level ChartQA, we conduct experiments that alter visual elements of charts (\*e.g.\*, changing color schemes,... | Yifan Wu, Lutao Yan, Leixian Shen, Yunhai Wang, Nan Tang, Yuyu Luo |  |

During communication, cultural differences in common ground during communication may result in pragmatic failure and misunderstandings. We develop our method Rational Speech Acts for Cross-Cultural Communication (RSA+C3) to resolve cross-cultural differences in common ground. To measure the success of our method, we study RSA+C3 in the collaborative referential game of Codenames Duet and show that our method successfully improves collaboration between simulated players of different cultures. Our contributions are threefold: (1) creating Codenames players using contrastive learning of an embedding space and LLM prompting that are aligned with human patterns of play, (2) studying culturally induced differences in common ground reflected in our trained models, and (3) demonstrating that our method RSA+C3 can ease cross-cultural communication in gameplay by inferring... | Isadora White, Sashrika Pandey, Michelle Pan |  |

Ensuring that media content remains unbiased and factual is crucial for maintaining public trust. With this in mind, we introduce SAFARI (CroSs-lingual BiAs and Factuality Detection in News MediA and News ARtIcles), a novel corpus of news media and articles for predicting political bias and the factuality of reporting in a multilingual and cross-lingual setup. To the best of our knowledge, this corpus is unprecedented in its collection and introduces a dataset for political bias and factuality for three tasks: (i) media-level, (ii) article-level, and (iii) joint modeling at the article-level. At the media and article levels, we evaluate the cross-lingual ability of the models; however, in joint modeling, we evaluate on English data. Our frameworks set a new benchmark in the cross-lingual evaluation of political bias and factuality.

There has been a notable gap in data designed for aligning language models to maintain topic relevance in conversations - a critical aspect for deploying chatbots to production. We introduce the CantTalkAboutThis dataset to help language models remain focused on the subject at hand during task-oriented interactions. It consists of synthetic dialogues on a wide range of conversation topics from different domains. These dialogues are interspersed with distractor turns that intentionally divert the chatbot from the predefined topic. Fine-tuning language models on this dataset helps make them resilient to deviating from the assigned role and improves their ability to maintain topical coherence compared to general-purpose instruction-tuned LLMs like gpt-4-turbo and Mixtral-Instruct. Additionally, preliminary observations suggest that training models on... | Makesh Narsimhan Sreedhar, Traian Rebedea, Shaona Ghosh, Jiaqi Zeng, Christopher Parisien |  |

Existing research is mainly conducted in monolingual setting on English datasets. To tackle the data scarcity problem in low-resource languages, cross-lingual stance detection (CLSD) transfers the knowledge from high-resource (source) language to low-resource (target) language. The CLSD task is the most challenging in zero-shot setting when no training data is available in target language, and transferring stance-relevant knowledge learned from high-resource language to bridge the language gap is the key for improving the performance of zero-shot CLSD. In this paper, we leverage the capability of large language model (LLM) for stance knowledge acquisition, and propose KEAR, a knowledge elicitation and retrieval framework. The knowledge elicitation module in KEAR first derives different types of stance knowledge from LLM’s... | Ruike Zhang, Yuan Tian, Penghui Wei, Daniel Zeng, Wenji Mao |  |

TuringQ consists of 4,006 undergraduate and graduate-level question-answer pairs, categorized into four difficulty levels and covering seven core theoretical areas. We evaluate several open-source LLMs, as well as GPT-4, using Chain of Thought prompting and expert human assessment. Additionally, we propose an automated LLM-based evaluation system that demonstrates competitive accuracy when compared to human evaluation. Fine-tuning a Llama3-8B model on TuringQ shows measurable improvements in reasoning ability and out-of-domain tasks such as algebra. TuringQ serves as both a benchmark and a resource for enhancing LLM performance in complex computational reasoning tasks. Our analysis offers insights into LLM capabilities and advances in AI comprehension of theoretical computer science. | Pardis Sadat Zahraei, Ehsaneddin Asgari |  |

These refinement approaches frequently evaluate what sizes of models are able to do refinement for what problems, but less attention is paid to what effective feedback for refinement looks like. In this work, we propose looking at refinement with feedback as a composition of three distinct LLM competencies: (1) detection of bad generations; (2) fine-grained natural language critique generation; (3) refining with fine-grained feedback. The first step can be implemented with a high-performing discriminative model and steps 2 and 3 can be implemented either via prompted or fine-tuned LLMs. A key property of the proposed Detect, Critique, Refine (“DCR”) method is that the step 2 critique model can give fine-grained feedback about errors, made possible by offloading the discrimination to a separate model in step 1. We show that models of different capabilities... | Manya Wadhwa, Xinyu Zhao, Junyi Jessy Li, Greg Durrett |  |

While previous work has touched upon various instances of this problem, there lacks a unified framework to study this behavior. This work systematically studies IP through a rigorous mathematical formulation, a multi-perspective moral reasoning framework, and a set of case studies. Our theoretical foundation for IP relies on a structural causal model and introduces a novel method, indirect intervention, to estimate the causal effect of a mediator variable that cannot be directly intervened upon. Beyond the technical approach, we also introduce a set of moral reasoning principles based on three schools of moral philosophy to study when IP may or may not be ethically appropriate. Equipped with both mathematical and ethical insights, we present three diverse case studies illustrating the varied... | Zhijing Jin, Nils Heil, Jiarui Liu, Shehzaad Dhuliawala, Yahang Qi, Bernhard Schölkopf, Rada Mihalcea, Mrinmaya Sachan |  |

Despite the importance of distinguishing mandatory arguments and optional modifiers in sentences, research in this area has been limited. We introduce a dataset with token-level annotations which labels mandatory and optional elements as complements and adjuncts, respectively. Particularly, we reclassify certain Korean phrases, previously misidentified as adverbial phrases, as complements, addressing misuses of the term adjunct in existing Korean treebanks. Utilizing a Korean dependency treebank, we develop an automatic labeling technique for complements and adjuncts. Experiments using the proposed dataset yield satisfying results, demonstrating that the dataset is trainable and reliable. | Yige Chen, Kyuwon Kim, Kyungtae Lim, Jungyeul Park, Chulwoo Park |  |

However, unveiling such implicit knowledge is a non-trivial task. Due to the complex nature of structured tables, it is challenging even for large language models (LLMs) to mine the implicit knowledge in an insightful and faithful manner. To address this challenge, we propose a novel table reasoning framework Question-then-Pinpoint. Our work focuses on building a plug-and-play table reasoner that can self-question the insightful knowledge and answer it by faithfully pinpointing evidence on the table to provide explainable guidance for the summarizer. To train a reliable reasoner, we collect table knowledge by guiding a teacher LLM to follow the coarse-to-fine reasoning paths and refine it through two quality enhancement strategies to selectively distill the high-quality knowledge to the reasoner. Extensive experiments on two table summarization... | Kwangwook Seo, Jinyoung Yeo, Dongha Lee |  |

This has motivated researchers to explore simpler pipelines leveraging large language models (LLMs) that can work in a zero-shot manner. However, since zero-shot inference does not make use of a training set of pairs of queries and their relevant documents, its performance is mostly worse than that of supervised models, which are trained on such example pairs. Motivated by the existing findings that training examples generally improve zero-shot performance, in our work, we explore if this also applies to ranking models. More specifically, given a query and a pair of documents, the preference prediction task is improved by augmenting examples of preferences for similar queries from a training set. Our proposed pairwise few-shot ranker demonstrates consistent improvements over the zero-shot... | Nilanjan Sinhababu, Andrew Parry, Debasis Ganguly, Debasis Samanta, Pabitra Mitra |  |

We further find that in the single-round, offline self-training, traditional supervised training can deliver gains comparable to preference optimization, but in online self-training, preference optimization methods largely outperform supervised training thanks... | Marek Kadlcík, Michal Stefánik |  |

To address this critical need, we propose the PowerPoint Task Completion-Robustness (PPTC-R) benchmark to measure LLMs’ robustness to the user PPT task instruction and software version (Powerpoint). Specifically, we construct adversarial user instructions by attacking user instructions at sentence, semantic, and multi-language levels. To assess the robustness of Language Models to software versions, we vary the number of provided APIs to simulate both the newest version and earlier version settings. Subsequently, we test 3 closed-source and 4 open-source LLMs using a benchmark that incorporates these robustness settings, aiming to evaluate how deviations impact LLMs’ API calls for task completion. We find that GPT-4 exhibits the highest performance and strong robustness in our... | Zekai Zhang, Yiduo Guo, Yaobo Liang, Dongyan Zhao, Nan Duan |  |

Recent works have leveraged the power of pretrained language models (PLMs) to directly rank news items by using inference approaches that predominately fall into three categories: pointwise, pairwise, and listwise learning-to-rank. While pointwise methods offer linear inference complexity, they fail to capture crucial comparative information between items that is more effective for ranking tasks. Conversely, pairwise and listwise approaches excel at incorporating these comparisons but suffer from practical limitations: pairwise approaches are either computationally expensive or lack theoretical guarantees and listwise methods often perform poorly in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for PLM-based news recommendation that integrates both pointwise relevance prediction and pairwise comparisons in a scalable manner.

When coupled with custom kernels that fuse the dequantization and matmul operations, weight-only quantization can thus enable faster inference by reducing the amount of memory movement. However, developing high-performance kernels for weight-quantized LLMs presents substantial challenges, especially when the weights are compressed to non-evenly-divisible bit widths (e.g., 3 bits) with non-uniform, lookup table (LUT) quantization. This paper describes FLUTE, a flexible lookup table engine for LUT-quantized LLMs, which uses offline restructuring of the quantized weight matrix to minimize bit manipulations associated with unpacking, and vectorization and duplication of the lookup table to mitigate shared memory bandwidth constraints. At batch sizes < 32 and quantization group size... | Han Guo, William Brandon, Radostin Cholakov, Jonathan RaganKelley, Eric P. Xing, Yoon Kim |  |

Prior work showed that simple post-hoc approaches are effective for mitigating this issue, but are not robust in noisy settings, e.g., when the distribution shift is caused by spelling mistakes. In this work, we propose Distance Aware Calibration (DAC), a post-hoc approach that changes the confidence scores of a Language Model leveraging the distance between new samples been evaluated and the in-domain training set. We show that using DAC on top of a Language Model can improve in-domain calibration, robustness to different kind of distribution shift and also the model’s ability to detect out-of-distribution samples. We provide an extensive evaluation on common text classification benchmark for both calibration and out-of-distribution detection tasks. | Alberto Gasparin, Gianluca Detommaso |  |

This is particularly crucial for drug names, where patients often use brand names like Advil or Tylenol instead of their generic equivalents. To study this, we create a new robustness dataset, RABBITS, to evaluate performance differences on medical benchmarks after swapping brand and generic drug names using physician expert annotations.We assess both open-source and API-based LLMs on MedQA and MedMCQA, revealing a consistent performance drop ranging from 1-10%. Furthermore, we identify a potential source of this fragility as the contamination of test data in widely used pre-training datasets. | Jack Gallifant, Shan Chen, Pedro Moreira, Nikolaj Munch, Mingye Gao, Jackson Pond, Leo Anthony Celi, Hugo J.

Specifically, we fine-tune Llama 2 LMs for error generation and find that this approach yields synthetic errors akin to human errors. Next, we train GEC Llama models using these artificial errors and outperform previous state-of-the-art error correction models, with gains ranging between 0.8 and 6 F0.5 points across all tested languages (German, Ukrainian, and Estonian). Moreover, we demonstrate that generating errors by fine-tuning smaller sequence-to-sequence models and prompting large commercial LMs (GPT3.5 and GPT4) also results in synthetic errors beneficially affecting error generation models. We openly release trained models for error generation and correction as well as all the synthesized error datasets for the covered languages. | Agnes Luhtaru, Taido Purason, Martin Vainikko, Maksym Del, Mark Fishel |  |

In cooking, these instructions can be interpreted as a series of modifications to a food preparation.For a model to effectively reason about cooking recipes, it must accurately discern and understand the inputs and outputs of intermediate steps within the recipe.We present a new corpus of cooking recipes enriched with descriptions of intermediate steps that describe the input and output for each step. PizzaCommonsense serves as a benchmark for the reasoning capabilities of LLMs because it demands rigorous explicit input-output descriptions to demonstrate the acquisition of implicit commonsense knowledge, which is unlikely to beeasily memorized. GPT-4 achieves only 26% human-evaluated preference for generations, leaving room for future improvements. | Aïssatou Diallo, Antonis Bikakis, Luke Dickens, Anthony Hunter, Rob Miller |  |

These issues have led to the dilemma of low resources for DDP tasks. Thanks to the powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in cross-task learning, we can use LLMs to model dependency parsing under different annotation schema in an unified manner, in order to alleviate the dilemma of low resources for DDP tasks. However, enabling LLMs to deeply comprehend dependency parsing tasks is a challenge that remains underexplored. Inspired by the application of code-based methods in complex tasks, we propose a code-based unified dependency parsing method. We treat the process of dependency parsing as a search process of dependency paths and use code to represent this search process. Furthermore, we use a curriculum-learning based instruction... | Zizhuo Shen, Yanqiu Shao, Wei Li |  |

However, prior work lacks a comprehensive evaluation of different language families, making it challenging to evaluate LLM robustness against errors in external retrieved knowledge. To overcome this, we establish \*\*NoMIRACL\*\*, a human-annotated dataset for evaluating LLM robustness in RAG across 18 typologically diverse languages. NoMIRACL includes both a non-relevant and a relevant subset. Queries in the non-relevant subset contain passages judged as non-relevant, whereas queries in the relevant subset include at least a single judged relevant passage. We measure relevance assessment using: (i) \*hallucination rate\*, measuring model tendency to hallucinate when the answer is not present in passages in the non-relevant subset, and (ii) \*error rate\*, measuring model inaccuracy to recognize relevant passages in the relevant... | Nandan Thakur, Luiz Bonifacio, Xinyu Zhang, Odunayo Ogundepo, Ehsan Kamalloo, David AlfonsoHermelo, Xiaoguang Li, Qun Liu, Boxing Chen, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Jimmy Lin |  |

Recent studies reveal that this bias is related to disproportional attention across the context. In this work, we examine how to direct LLMs to allocate more attention towards a selected segment of the context through prompting, aiming to compensate for the shortage of attention. We find that language models do not have relative position awareness of the context but can be directed by promoting instruction with an exact document index. Our analysis contributes to a deeper understanding of position bias in LLMs and provides a pathway to mitigate this bias by instruction, thus benefiting LLMs in locating and utilizing relevant information from retrieved documents in RAG applications. The code and data in our study have been made publicly available. | Meiru Zhang, Zaiqiao Meng, Nigel Collier |  |

In the text domain, prevailing methods typically generate distilled data as embedding vectors, which are not human-readable. This approach simplifies optimization but limits the transferability of distilled data across different model architectures. To address this limitation, we introduce a model-agnostic, data-efficient method that leverages Language Model (LM) embeddings. Compared to parameter-efficient methods such as LORA, our approach achieves comparable performance with significantly faster processing times. We evaluate our methodology through classification tasks on datasets like IMDB and AG-News, demonstrating performance that is on par with or exceeds previous model-dependent techniques. By utilizing LM embeddings, our method offers enhanced flexibility and improved transferability, expanding the range of potential applications. | Yefan Tao, Luyang Kong, Andrey Kan, Laurent Callot |  |

However, existing work mainly focuses on capturing user implicit preferences from historical interactions and simply matching them with the next behavior, instead of predicting user explicit intentions. This may lead to inappropriate recommendations. In light of this issue, we propose the adversarial user intention learning approach for sequential recommendaiton, named AuriSRec. The major novelty of our approach is to explicitly predict user current intentions when making recommendations, by inferring their decision-making process as explained in target reviews (reviews written after interacting with the ground-truth item). Specifically, AuriSRec conducts adversarial learning between an intention generator and a discriminator.

One feasible way is erasure search: obtaining the rationale by entirely removing a subset of input without compromising verification accuracy. Despite extensive exploration, current rationalization methods struggle to discern nuanced composition within the correlated evidence, which inevitably leads to noise rationalization in multi-hop scenarios. To address this issue, this paper explores the multi-granular rationale extraction method, aiming to realize the denoising rationalization for multi-hop fact verification. Specifically, given a pretrained veracity prediction model, two independent external explainers are introduced and trained collaboratively to enhance the discriminating ability by imposing varied constraints. Meanwhile, three key properties (Fidelity, Consistency, Salience) are introduced to regularize the denoising and faithful... | Jiasheng Si, Yingjie Zhu, Wenpeng Lu, Deyu Zhou |  |

However, medical jargon in EHRs poses significant challenges in patient comprehension. To address this, we introduce a new task of automatically generating lay definitions, aiming to simplify complex medical terms into patient-friendly lay language. We first created the README dataset, an extensive collection of over 50,000 unique (medical term, lay definition) pairs and 300,000 mentions, each offering context-aware lay definitions manually annotated by domain experts. We have also engineered a data-centric Human-AI pipeline that synergizes data filtering, augmentation, and selection to improve data quality. We then used README as the training data for models and leveraged a Retrieval-Augmented Generation method to reduce hallucinations and improve the quality of model outputs. Our extensive... | Zonghai Yao, Nandyala Siddharth Kantu, Guanghao Wei, Hieu Tran, Zhangqi Duan, Sunjae Kwon, Zhichao Yang, README annotation team, Hong Yu |  |

By examining 24 models on 6 data sets, we find out that 88-98% of cases return statistically significantly distinguishable generation probability and uncertainty distributions. Using this general phenomenon, we showcase a hallucination-reducing training algorithm. Our algorithm outperforms other baselines by achieving higher faithfulness metrics while maintaining sound general text quality measures. | Taehun Cha, Donghun Lee |  |

Given their training on human (created) data, LLMs have been shown to inherit societal biases against protected groups, as well as be subject to bias functionally resembling cognitive bias. Human-like bias can impede fair and explainable decisions made with LLM assistance. Our work introduces BiasBuster, a framework designed to uncover, evaluate, and mitigate cognitive bias in LLMs, particularly in high-stakes decision-making tasks. Inspired by prior research in psychology and cognitive science, we develop a dataset containing 13,465 prompts to evaluate LLM decisions on different cognitive biases (e.g., prompt-induced, sequential, inherent). We test various bias mitigation strategies, while proposing a novel method utilizing LLMs to debias their own human-like cognitive bias within prompts.

To provide a framework for studying such conversation structure, we introduce \*Problem-Oriented Segmentation & Retrieval (POSR), the task of jointly breaking down conversations into segments and linking each segment to the relevant reference item. As a case study, we apply POSR to education where effectively structuring lessons around problems is critical yet difficult. We present \*LessonLink\*, the first dataset of real-world tutoring lessons, featuring 3,500 segments, spanning 24,300 minutes of instruction and linked to 116 SAT Math problems. We define and evaluate several joint and independent approaches for POSR, including segmentation (e.g., TextTiling), retrieval (e.g., ColBERT), and large language models (LLMs) methods. Our results highlight that modeling POSR as one joint task is essential: POSR methods outperform... | Rose E. Wang, Pawan Wirawarn, Kenny Lam, Omar Khattab, Dorottya Demszky |  |

In this work, we propose a null-input prompting method to calibrate intrinsic bias encoded in pre-trained LMs. Different from prior efforts that address intrinsic bias primarily for social fairness and often involve excessive computational cost, our objective is to explore enhancing LMs’ performance in downstream zero/few-shot learning while emphasizing the efficiency of intrinsic bias calibration. Specifically, we leverage a diverse set of auto-selected null-meaning inputs generated from GPT-4 to probe intrinsic bias of pre-trained LMs. Utilizing the bias-reflected probability distribution, we formulate a distribution disparity loss for bias calibration, where we exclusively update bias parameters (0.1% of total parameters) of LMs towards equal probability distribution. Experimental results show that the... | Kang He, Yinghan Long, Kaushik Roy |  |

Here, we introduce \*R&R\*—a combination of two novel prompt-based methods called \*reprompting\* and \*in-context retrieval\* (ICR)—to alleviate this effect in document-based QA. In reprompting, we repeat the prompt instructions periodically throughout the context document to remind the LLM of its original task. In ICR, rather than instructing the LLM to answer the question directly, we instruct it to retrieve the top k passage numbers most relevant to the given question, which are then used as an abbreviated context in a second QA prompt. We test R&R with GPT-4 Turbo and Claude-2.1 on documents up to 80k tokens in length and observe a 16-point boost in QA accuracy on average. Our further analysis suggests that R&R improves performance on long... | Devanshu Agrawal, Shang Gao, Martin Gajek |  |

However, data about violent incidents with direct impact and relevance for humanitarian aid operations is not readily available. An automatic data collection and NLP-backed classification framework aligned with humanitarian perspectives can help bridge this gap. In this paper, we present HumVI – a dataset comprising news articles in three languages (English, French, Arabic) containing instances of different types of violent incidents categorized by the humanitarian sector they impact, e.g., aid security, education, food security, health, and protection. Reliable labels were obtained for the dataset by partnering with a data-backed humanitarian organization, Insecurity Insight.

Recent methods to automatically attribute such utterances have explored simulating human logic with deterministic rules or learning new implicit rules with neural networks when processing contextual information.However, these systems inherently lack character representations, which often leads to errors in more challenging examples of attribution: anaphoric and implicit quotes.In this work, we propose to augment a popular quotation attribution system, BookNLP, with character embeddings that encode global stylistic information of characters derived from an off-the-shelf stylometric model, Universal Authorship Representation (UAR).We create DramaCV, a corpus of English drama plays from the 15th to 20th century that we automatically... | Gaspard Michel, Elena V.

While the accuracy of state-of-the-art Language Models (LMs) approximates human performance, they often exhibit a drop in performance on real-world noisy data. This lack of robustness can be concerning, as even small perturbations in text, irrelevant to the target task, can cause classifiers to incorrectly change their predictions. A potential solution can be the family of Prototype-Based Networks (PBNs) that classifies examples based on their similarity to prototypical examples of a class (prototypes) and has been shown to be robust to noise for computer vision tasks. In this paper, we study whether the robustness properties of PBNs transfer to text classification tasks under both targeted and static adversarial attack settings. Our results show that PBNs, as a mere architectural variation of vanilla LMs, offer more robustness compared to vanilla LMs under both targeted and static settings.

Despite numerous efforts made to optimize LLMs for long contexts, challenges persist in robustly processing long inputs. In this paper, we introduce GraphReader, a graph-based agent system designed to handle long texts by structuring them into a graph and employing an agent to explore this graph autonomously. Upon receiving a question, the agent first undertakes a step-by-step analysis and devises a rational plan. It then invokes a set of predefined functions to read node content and neighbors, facilitating a coarse-to-fine exploration of the graph. Throughout the exploration, the agent continuously records new insights and reflects on current circumstances to optimize the process until it has gathered sufficient information to generate an answer. Experimental results on the LV-Eval dataset reveal that GraphReader using a 4k context window, consistently outperforms... | Shilong Li, Yancheng He, Hangyu Guo, Xingyuan Bu, Ge Bai, Jie Liu, Jiaheng Liu, Xingwei Qu, Yangguang Li, Wanli Ouyang, Wenbo Su, Bo Zheng |  |

However, under common scenarios, such as when generations from a model pair are very similar, or when stochastic decoding results in large variations in generations, it results in inconsistent preference ratings. We address these challenges by introducing a meta-evaluation measure, separability, which estimates how suitable a test instance is for pairwise preference evaluation. For a candidate test instance, separability samples multiple generations from a pair of models, and measures how distinguishable the two sets of generations are. Our experiments show that instances with high separability values yield more consistent preference ratings from both human- and auto-raters. Further, the distribution of separability allows insights into which test benchmarks are more valuable for comparing models. Finally, we incorporate separability into ELO ratings, accounting for how suitable each test... | Sayan Ghosh, Tejas Srinivasan, Swabha Swayamdipta |  |

However, the existing variants of LoRA are hampered by limited expressiveness, a tendency to overfit, and sensitivity to hyperparameter settings. This paper presents LoRA Slow Cascade Learning (LoRASC), an innovative technique designed to enhance LoRA’s expressiveness and generalization capabilities while preserving its training efficiency. Our approach augments expressiveness through a cascaded learning strategy that enables a mixture-of-low-rank adaptation, thereby increasing the model’s ability to capture complex patterns. Additionally, we introduce a slow-fast update mechanism and cascading noisy tuning to bolster generalization. The extensive experiments on various language and vision datasets, as well as robustness benchmarks, demonstrate that the proposed method not only significantly outperforms existing baselines, but also mitigates... | Siwei Li, Yifan Yang, Yifei Shen, Fangyun Wei, Zongqing Lu, Lili Qiu, Yuqing Yang |  |

These models are often adapted to a desired domain or downstream task through a fine-tuning stage. This paper proposes SQFT, an end-to-end solution for low-precision sparse parameter-efficient fine-tuning of LPMs, allowing for effective model manipulation in resource-constrained environments. Additionally, an innovative strategy enables the merging of sparse weights with low-rank adapters without losing sparsity and accuracy, overcoming the limitations of previous approaches. SQFT also addresses the challenge of having quantized weights and adapters with different numerical precisions, enabling merging in the desired numerical format without sacrificing accuracy. Multiple adaptation scenarios, models, and comprehensive sparsity levels demonstrate the effectiveness of SQFT. | Juan Pablo Muñoz, Jinjie Yuan, Nilesh Jain |  |

A popular user-facing application of LLMs is the multi-turn chat setting. Though longer chat memory and better understanding may seemingly benefit users, our paper exposes a vulnerability that leverages the multi-turn feature and strong learning ability of LLMs to harm the end-user: the backdoor. We demonstrate that LLMs can capture the combinational backdoor representation. Only upon presentation of triggers together does the backdoor activate. We also verify empirically that this representation is invariant to the position of the trigger utterance. Subsequently, inserting a single extra token into any two utterances of 5% of the data can cause over 99% Attack Success Rate (ASR). Our results with 3 triggers demonstrate that this framework is generalizable, compatible with any trigger in an adversary’s... | Terry Tong, Qin Liu, Jiashu Xu, Muhao Chen |  |

Addressing this challenge, our research introduces InternalInspector, a novel framework designed to enhance confidence estimation in LLMs by leveraging contrastive learning on internal states including attention states, feed-forward states, and activation states of all layers. Unlike existing methods that primarily focus on the final activation state, InternalInspector conducts a comprehensive analysis across all internal states of every layer to accurately identify both correct and incorrect prediction processes. By benchmarking InternalInspector against existing confidence estimation methods across various natural language understanding and generation tasks, including factual question answering, commonsense reasoning, and reading comprehension, InternalInspector achieves significantly higher accuracy... | Mohammad Beigi, Ying Shen, Runing Yang, Zihao Lin, Qifan Wang, Ankith Mohan, Jianfeng He, Ming Jin, ChangTien Lu, Lifu Huang |  |

LADAM employs attention mechanisms to exchange semantically similar words between sentences. This approach generates a greater diversity of synthetic sentences compared to simpler operations like random insertions, while maintaining the context of the original sentences. Additionally, LADAM is an easy-to-use, lightweight technique that does not require external datasets or large language models. Our experimental results across five datasets demonstrate that LADAM consistently outperforms baseline methods across diverse text classification conditions. | Junehyung Kim, Sungjae Hwang |  |

In this study, we investigate the impact of adversarial attacks on different POS tags within text prompts on the images generated by T2I models. We create a high-quality dataset for realistic POS tag token swapping and perform gradient-based attacks to find adversarial suffixes that mislead T2I models into generating images with altered tokens. Our empirical results show that the attack success rate (ASR) varies significantly among different POS tag categories, with nouns, proper nouns, and adjectives being the easiest to attack. We explore the mechanism behind the steering effect of adversarial suffixes, finding that the number of critical tokens and information fusion vary among POS tags, while features like suffix transferability are consistent across categories. | G.

In practice, multiple responses could exist for a given prompt with varying quality relative to each other. We propose to utilize these responses to create multiple preference pairs for a given prompt. Our work focuses on aligning LLMs by systematically curating multiple preference pairs and presenting them in a meaningful manner facilitating curriculum learning to enhance the prominent DPO technique. We order multiple preference pairs from easy to hard, according to various criteria thus emulating curriculum learning. Our method, which is referred to as Curri-DPO consistently shows increased performance gains on MTbench, Vicuna bench, WizardLM, highlighting its effectiveness over standard DPO setting that utilizes single preference pair. More specifically, Curri-DPO achieves a score of 7.43 on MTbench... | Pulkit Pattnaik, Rishabh Maheshwary, Kelechi Ogueji, Vikas Yadav, Sathwik Tejaswi Madhusudhan |  |

However, ensuring semantic coherence across languages is an overlooked challenge and can be critical in several contexts. To fill this gap, we introduce multi-target cross-lingual summarization as the task of summarizing a document into multiple target languages while ensuring that the produced summaries are semantically similar. We propose a principled re-ranking approach to this problem and a multi-criteria evaluation protocol to assess semantic coherence across target languages, marking a first step that will hopefully stimulate further research on this problem. | Diogo Pernes, Gonçalo M.

One application of such data is to fit supervised learning models in order to predict consequential outcomes, for example: whether a family is likely to be evicted, whether a student will graduate from high school or is at risk of dropping out, and whether a voter will turn out in an upcoming election. While supervised learning has seen drastic improvements in performance with advancements in deep learning technology, these gains are largely lost on tabular data which poses unique difficulties for deep learning frameworks. We propose a technique for transforming tabular data to text data and demonstrate the extent to which this technique can improve the performance of deep learning models for tabular data. Overall, we find modest gains (1.5% on average). Interestingly, we find that these gains do not depend on using large language models to generate text. | Tong Lin, Jason Yan, David Jurgens, Sabina Tomkins |  |

Although LLMs can handle increasingly longer context windows, they struggle to effectively utilize the long content. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of a virtual document (VDoc). A VDoc is created by selecting chunks from the original document that are most likely to contain the information needed to answer the user’s question, while ensuring they fit within the LLM’s context window. We hypothesize that providing a short and focused VDoc to the LLM is more effective than filling the entire context window with less relevant information. Our experiments confirm this hypothesis and demonstrate that using VDocs improves results on the QA task. | Yosi Mass, Boaz Carmeli, Asaf Yehudai, Assaf Toledo, Nathaniel Mills |  |

Existing methods for detecting OOD data are computationally complex and storage-intensive. We propose a novel soft clustering approach for OOD detection based on non-negative kernel regression. Our approach greatly reduces computational and space complexities (up to 11× improvement in inference time and 87% reduction in storage requirements). It outperforms existing approaches by up to 4 AUROC points on four benchmarks. We also introduce an entropy-constrained version of our algorithm, leading to further reductions in storage requirements (up to 97% lower than comparable approaches) while retaining competitive performance. Our soft clustering approach for OOD detection highlights its potential for detecting tail-end phenomena in extreme-scale data settings.

A key challenge with evaluating MMRAG is the paucity of high-quality datasets matching the question styles and modalities of interest. In light of this, we propose SMMQG, a synthetic data generation framework. SMMQG leverages interplay between a retriever, large language model (LLM) and large multimodal model (LMM) to generate question and answer pairs directly from multimodal documents, with the questions conforming to specified styles and modalities. We use SMMQG to generate an MMRAG dataset of 1024 questions over Wikipedia documents and evaluate state-of-the-art models using it, revealing insights into model performance that are attainable only through style- and modality-specific evaluation data. Next, we measure the quality of data produced by SMMQG via a human study. We find that the quality of SMMQG-generated synthetic data is on par with the quality of the... | Ian Wu, Sravan Jayanthi, Vijay Viswanathan, Simon Rosenberg, Sina Pakazad, Tongshuang Wu, Graham Neubig |  |

Molecule representation in language models (LMs) is crucial in enhancing chemical understanding. We propose Augmented Molecular Retrieval (AMORE), a flexible zero-shot framework for assessment of Chemistry LMs of different natures: trained solely on molecules for chemical tasks and on a combined corpus of natural language texts and string-based structures. The framework relies on molecule augmentations that preserve an underlying chemical, such as kekulization and cycle replacements. We evaluate encoder-only and generative LMs by calculating a metric based on the similarity score between distributed representations of molecules and their augmentations. Our experiments on ChEBI-20 and QM9 benchmarks show that these models exhibit significantly lower scores than graph-based molecular models trained without language modeling objectives.

A standard approach is to measure this relevance through the similarity between contexts and queries in the embedding space. However, such similarity often fails to capture the relevance. Alternatively, large language models (LLMs) have been used for ranking contexts. However, they can encounter scalability issues when the number of candidate contexts grows and the context window sizes of the LLMs remain constrained. Additionally, these approaches require fine-tuning LLMs with domain-specific data. In this work, we introduce a scalable ranking framework that combines embedding similarity and LLM capabilities without requiring LLM fine-tuning. Our framework uses a pre-trained LLM to hypothesize the user query based on the retrieved contexts and ranks the context based on the similarity between the hypothesized queries and the user... | Weichao Zhou, Jiaxin Zhang, Hilaf Hasson, Anu Singh, Wenchao Li |  |

However, current approaches often overlook the importance of safety alignment during merging, leading to highly misaligned models. This work investigates the effects of model merging on alignment. We evaluate several popular model merging techniques, demonstrating that existing methods do not only transfer domain expertise but also propagate misalignment. We propose a simple two-step approach to address this problem: (i) generating synthetic safety and domain-specific data, and (ii) incorporating these generated data into the optimization process of existing data-aware model merging techniques. This allows us to treat alignment as a skill that can be maximized in the resulting merged LLM. Our experiments illustrate the effectiveness of integrating alignment-related data during merging, resulting in models... | Hasan Hammoud, Umberto Michieli, Fabio Pizzati, Philip Torr, Adel Bibi, Bernard Ghanem, Mete Ozay |  |

We present a novel curated multimodal dataset of questions about object habitats and affordances, which are formally grounded in the underlying lexical semantics literature, with multiple images from various sources that depict the scenario described in the question. We evaluate 16 text-only and multimodal LLMs on this challenging data. Our findings indicate that while certain LLMs can perform reasonably well on reasoning about affordances, there appears to be a consistent low upper bound on habitat-centered reasoning performance. We discuss how the formal semantics of habitats in fact predicts this behavior and propose this as a challenge to the community. | Sadaf Ghaffari, Nikhil Krishnaswamy |  |

Large language or multimodal model based verification has been proposed to scale up online policing mechanisms for mitigating spread of false and harmful content. While these can potentially reduce burden on human fact-checkers, such efforts may be hampered by foundation model training data becoming outdated. In this work, we test the limits of improving foundation model performance without continual updating through an initial study of knowledge transfer using either existing intra- and inter-domain benchmarks or explanations generated from large language models (LLMs).We evaluate on 12 public benchmarks for fact-checking and misinformation detection as well as two other tasks relevant to content moderation - toxicity and stance detection.

This difficulty hinders the analysis of cultural awareness of machine translation (MT) systems, including traditional neural MT and the emerging MT paradigm using large language models (LLM). To address this gap, we introduce a novel parallel corpus, enriched with CSI annotations in 6 language pairs for investigating Cultural-Aware Machine Translation—CAMT. Furthermore, we design two evaluation metrics to assess CSI translations, focusing on their pragmatic translation quality. Our findings show the superior ability of LLMs over neural MTs in leveraging external cultural knowledge for translating CSIs, especially those lacking translations in the target culture. | Binwei Yao, Ming Jiang, Tara Bobinac, Diyi Yang, Junjie Hu |  |

Yet, in order to meet user expectations, models need to be able to respond appropriately in multiple languages once deployed in downstream applications. This requires strong cross-lingual transfer abilities.In this work, we investigate the minimal amount of multilinguality required during finetuning to elicit cross-lingual generalisation in English-centric LLMs. In experiments across four LLMs, we find that multilingual instruction tuning with as few as two to three languages is both necessary and sufficient to elicit effective cross-lingual generalisation, with the limiting factor being the degree to which a target language is seen during pretraining. Evaluations on five different tasks further reveal that multilingual instruction tuning is most beneficial for generative tasks that assume input/output language agreement, such as in chat settings, while... | Tannon Kew, Florian Schottmann, Rico Sennrich |  |

This method employs a smaller \*draft\* model to speculate a block of tokens, which the \*target\* model then evaluates for acceptance. Despite a wealth of studies aimed at increasing the efficiency of speculative decoding, the influence of generation configurations on the decoding process remains poorly understood, especially concerning decoding temperatures. This paper delves into the effects of decoding temperatures on speculative decoding’s efficacy. Beginning with knowledge distillation (KD), we first highlight the challenge of decoding at higher temperatures, and demonstrate KD in a consistent temperature setting could be a remedy. We also investigate the effects of out-of-domain testing sets with out-of-range temperatures. Building upon these findings, we take an initial step to further the speedup for speculative decoding, particularly in a high-temperature... | Siru Ouyang, Shuohang Wang, Minhao Jiang, Ming Zhong, Donghan Yu, Jiawei Han, Yelong Shen |  |

Second, we develop a smaller sequence-to-sequence model (the Refiner), to improve the generated utterances. The Refiner is fine-tuned on seen domains and then applied to unseen domains. We evaluate our method by training an intent classifier on the generated data, and evaluating it on real (human) data.We find that the Refiner significantly improves the data utility and diversity over the zero-shot LLM baseline for unseen domains and over common baseline approaches.Our results indicate that a two-step approach of a generative LLM in zero-shot setting and a smaller sequence-to-sequence model... | IFan Lin, Faegheh Hasibi, Suzan Verberne |  |

However, current methods often perform suboptimally, mainly due to a lack of detailed, context-specific prompts needed for understanding various sentences and relations. To address this, we introduce the Self-Prompting framework, a novel method designed to fully harness the embedded RE knowledge within LLMs. Specifically, our framework employs a three-stage diversity approach to prompt LLMs, generating multiple synthetic samples that encapsulate specific relations from scratch. These generated samples act as in-context learning samples, offering explicit and context-specific guidance to efficiently prompt LLMs for RE. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets show our approach outperforms existing LLM-based zero-shot RE methods. Additionally, our experiments confirm the effectiveness of our generation pipeline in producing... | Siyi Liu, Yang Li, Jiang Li, Shan Yang, Yunshi Lan |  |

Rethinking Document Information Extraction Datasets for LLMs](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.findings-emnlp.770) |  | 0 | The rise of large language models (LLMs) for visually rich document understanding (VRDU) has kindled a need for prompt-response, document-based datasets. As annotating new datasets from scratch is labor-intensive, the existing literature has generated prompt-response datasets from available resources using simple templates. For the case of key information extraction (KIE), one of the most common VRDU tasks, past work has typically employed the template “What is the value for the key?”. However, given the variety of questions encountered in the wild, simple and uniform templates are insufficient for creating robust models in research and industrial contexts. In this work, we present K2Q, a diverse collection of five datasets converted from KIE to a prompt-response format using a plethora of bespoke templates. The questions in K2Q can span multiple entities and be extractive or boolean. We empirically compare the performance of seven baseline generative models on K2Q with zero-shot... | Ran Zmigrod, Pranav Shetty, Mathieu Sibue, Zhiqiang Ma, Armineh Nourbakhsh, Xiaomo Liu, Manuela Veloso |  |

Multifaceted Benchmarks for Knowledge Probing in Language Models](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.findings-emnlp.771) |  | 0 | Language models often struggle with handling factual knowledge, exhibiting factual hallucination issue. This makes it vital to evaluate the models’ ability to recall its parametric knowledge about facts. In this study, we introduce a knowledge probing benchmark, BELIEF(ICL), to evaluate the knowledge recall ability of both encoder- and decoder-based pre-trained language models (PLMs) from diverse perspectives. BELIEFs utilize a multi-prompt dataset to evaluate PLM’s accuracy, consistency, and reliability in factual knowledge recall. To enable a more reliable evaluation with BELIEFs, we semi-automatically create MyriadLAMA, which has massively diverse prompts. We validate the effectiveness of BELIEFs in comprehensively evaluating PLM’s knowledge recall ability on diverse PLMs, including recent large language models (LLMs). We then investigate key factors in memorizing and recalling facts in PLMs, such as model size, pretraining strategy and corpora, instruction-tuning process and... | Xin Zhao, Naoki Yoshinaga, Daisuke Oba |  |

However, studies traditionally focus on a single aspect of trauma, often neglecting the transferability of findings across different scenarios. We address this gap by training various language models with progressing complexity on trauma-related datasets, including genocide-related court data, a Reddit dataset on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), counseling conversations, and Incel forum posts. Our results show that the fine-tuned RoBERTa model excels in predicting traumatic events across domains, slightly outperforming large language models like GPT-4. Additionally, SLALOM-feature scores and conceptual explanations effectively differentiate and cluster trauma-related language, highlighting different trauma aspects and identifying sexual abuse and experiences related to death as a common traumatic event across all datasets. This transferability is crucial as it... | Miriam Schirmer, Tobias Leemann, Gjergji Kasneci, Jürgen Pfeffer, David Jurgens |  |

However, these state-of-the-art (SOTA) prompting strategies rely on a fixed set of static seed reasoning modules like “think step by step” or “break down this problem” intended to simulate human approach to problem-solving. This constraint limits the flexibility of models in tackling diverse problems effectively. In this paper, we introduce Auto-Evolve, a novel framework that enables LLMs to self-create dynamic reasoning modules and downstream action plan, resulting in significant improvements over current SOTA methods. We evaluate Auto-Evolve on the challenging BigBench-Hard (BBH) dataset with Claude 2.0, Claude 3 Sonnet, Mistral Large, and GPT-4, where it consistently outperforms the SOTA prompt strategies. Auto-Evolve outperforms CoT by up to 10.4% and on an average by 7%... | Krishna Aswani, Huilin Lu, Pranav Patankar, Priya Dhalwani, Xue Tan, Jayant Ganeshmohan, Simon Lacasse |  |

Recent research indicates that the over-reliance on the Large Language Model (LLM) backbone, as one cause of the LVLM hallucination, inherently introduces bias from language priors, leading to insufficient context attention to the visual inputs.We tackle this issue of hallucination by mitigating such over-reliance through preference learning. We propose Vision-guided Direct Preference Optimization (V-DPO) to enhance visual context learning at training time. To interpret the effectiveness and generalizability of V-DPO on different types of training data, we construct a synthetic dataset containing both response- and image-contrast preference pairs, compared against existing human-annotated hallucination samples. Our approach achieves significant improvements compared with baseline methods across various hallucination benchmarks. Our... | Yuxi Xie, Guanzhen Li, Xiao Xu, MinYen Kan |  |

This paper introduces the Multimodal Scientific ASR (MS-ASR) task, which focuses on transcribing scientific conference videos by leveraging visual information from slides to enhance the accuracy of technical terminologies. Realized that traditional metrics like WER fall short in assessing performance accurately, prompting the proposal of severity-aware WER (SWER) that considers the content type and severity of ASR errors. We propose the Scientific Vision Augmented ASR (SciVASR) framework as a baseline method, enabling MLLMs to improve transcript quality through post-editing. Evaluations of state-of-the-art MLLMs, including GPT-4o, show a 45% improvement over speech-only baselines, highlighting the importance of multimodal information integration. | Minghan Wang, Yuxia Wang, ThuyTrang Vu, Ehsan Shareghi, Reza Haf |  |

Given preprocessed texts from an initial web corpus (e.g. Dolma (Soldaini et al., 2024)), we generate synthetic instructions using the backtranslation approach proposed by Li et al., (2023), filter the generated data and rewrite the responses to improve their quality further based on the initial texts. Given similar quantities of instructions, fine-tuning Llama-2 on our (synthetic instruction, rewritten response) pairs yields better AlpacaEval win rates than using other common instruction datasets such as Humpback, ShareGPT, Open Orca, Alpaca-GPT4 and Self-instruct, at both 7B and 70B parameter scales. We also demonstrate that rewriting the responses with an LLM is different from direct distillation: the former process yields better win rate at 70B scale, and the two text distributions exhibit significant distinction in the... | Thao Nguyen, Jeffrey Li, Sewoong Oh, Ludwig Schmidt, Jason Weston, Luke Zettlemoyer, Xian Li |  |

Form understanding involves two main tasks, namely, the identification of keys and values (a.k.a Key Information Extraction or KIE) and the association of keys to corresponding values (a.k.a. Relation Extraction or RE). State of the art models for form understanding often rely on training paradigms that yield poorly calibrated output probabilities and low performance on RE. In this paper, we present AliGATr, a graph-based model that uses a generative objective to represent complex grid-like layouts that are often found in forms. Using a grid-based graph topology, our model learns to generate the layout of each page token by token in a data efficient manner. Despite using 30% fewer parameters than the smallest SotA, AliGATr performs on par with or better than SotA models on the KIE and RE tasks against four datasets. We also show that AliGATr’s output probabilities are better... | Armineh Nourbakhsh, Zhao Jin, Siddharth Parekh, Sameena Shah, Carolyn P. Rosé |  |

Given a training corpusand control criteria formulated as a sequence-level constraint on model outputs, our methodfine-tunes the LLM on the training corpus whileenhancing constraint satisfaction with minimalimpact on its utility and generation quality.Specifically, our approach regularizes the LLMtraining by penalizing the KL divergence be-tween the desired output distribution, which sat-isfies the constraints, and the LLM’s posterior.This regularization term can be approximatedby an auxiliary model trained to decomposethe sequence-level constraints into token-levelguidance, allowing the term to be measuredby a closed-form formulation. To further im-prove efficiency, we design a parallel schemefor concurrently updating both the LLM andthe auxiliary model. We evaluate the empiricalperformance of our approach by controlling thetoxicity when training an LLM.

Current text-to-image models (Rombach et al., 2022a; Belouadi et al., 2023) struggle with generating accurate and visually appealing diagrams from long-context inputs. We propose SciDoc2Diagram, a task that extracts relevant information from scientific papers and generates diagrams, along with a benchmarking dataset, SciDoc2DiagramBench. We develop a multi-step pipeline SciDoc2Diagrammer that generates diagrams based on user intentions using intermediate code generation. We observed that initial diagram drafts were often incomplete or unfaithful to the source, leading us to develop SciDoc2Diagrammer-Multi-Aspect-Feedback (MAF), a refinement strategy that significantly enhances factual correctness and visual appeal and outperforms existing models on both automatic and human judgement. | Ishani Mondal, Zongxia Li, Yufang Hou, Anandhavelu Natarajan, Aparna Garimella, Jordan L.

Existing style transfer methods generally rely on the few-shot capabilities of large language models or on complex controllable text generation approaches that are inefficient and underperform on fluency metrics. We introduce TinyStyler, a lightweight but effective approach, which leverages a small language model (800M params) and pre-trained authorship embeddings to perform efficient, few-shot text style transfer. We evaluate on the challenging task of authorship style transfer and find TinyStyler outperforms strong approaches such as GPT-4. We also evaluate TinyStyler’s ability to perform text attribute style transfer (formal ↔ informal) with automatic and human evaluations and find that the approach outperforms recent controllable text generation methods. | Zachary Horvitz, Ajay Patel, Kanishk Singh, Chris CallisonBurch, Kathleen R.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, their ability to understand emphasis in dialogue remains uncertain. This paper introduces Emphasized-Talk, a benchmark dataset with annotated dialogue samples capturing the implications of emphasis. We evaluate various LLMs, both open-source and commercial, to assess their performance in understanding and generating emphasis. Additionally, we propose an automatic evaluation pipeline using GPT-4, which achieve high correlation with human scoring. Our findings reveal that although commercial LLMs generally perform better, there is still significant room for improvement in comprehending emphasized sentences. | GuanTing Lin, Hungyi Lee |  |

Including an image in the query to a LLaVA-style VLM significantly increases the likelihood of the model returning an English response, regardless of the language of the query. This paper investigates the causes of this loss with a two-pronged approach that combines extensive ablation of the design space with a mechanistic analysis of the models’ internal representations of image and text inputs. Both approaches indicate that the issue stems in the language modeling component of the LLaVA model. Statistically, we find that switching the language backbone for a bilingual language model has the strongest effect on reducing this error. Mechanistically, we provide compelling evidence that visual inputs are not mapped to a similar space as text ones, and that intervening on intermediary attention layers can reduce this bias. Our findings provide important insights to... | Musashi Hinck, Carolin Holtermann, Matthew L.

In this work, we explore zero-shot cross-lingual generalization of preference tuning in detoxifying LLMs. Unlike previous studies that show limited cross-lingual generalization for other safety tasks, we demonstrate that Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training with only English data can significantly reduce toxicity in multilingual open-ended generations. For example, the probability of mGPT-1.3B generating toxic continuations drops from 46.8% to 3.9% across 17 different languages after training. Our results also extend to other multilingual LLMs, such as BLOOM, Llama3, and Aya-23. Using mechanistic interpretability tools like causal intervention and activation analysis, we identified the dual multilinguality property of MLP layers in LLMs, which explains the cross-lingual generalization of DPO. Finally, we show that bilingual sentence retrieval can predict the... | Xiaochen Li, Zheng Xin Yong, Stephen H. Bach |  |

However, traditional calibration methods typically rely on a binary true/false assessment of response correctness, unsuitable for long-form generations where an answer can be partially correct. Addressing this gap, we introduce a unified calibration framework, in which both the correctness of the LLMs’ responses and their associated confidence levels are treated as distributions across a range of scores. We develop three metrics for assessing LLM calibration and propose confidence elicitation methods based on self-consistency and self-evaluation. Our experiments demonstrate that larger models don’t necessarily guarantee better calibration, that various calibration metrics complement each other, and that self-consistency methods excel in factoid datasets. We also find that calibration can be enhanced through... | Yukun Huang, Yixin Liu, Raghuveer Thirukovalluru, Arman Cohan, Bhuwan Dhingra |  |

This is primarily due to the need for efficient recommendation, which requires adaptive and interactive responses. In this study, we focus on sequential recommendation and introduce a lightweight framework called full-scale Matryoshka representation learning for multimodal recommendation (fMRLRec). Our fMRLRec captures item features at different granularities, learning informative representations for efficient recommendation across multiple dimensions. To integrate item features from diverse modalities, fMRLRec employs a simple mapping to project multimodal item features into an aligned feature space. Additionally, we design an efficient linear transformation that embeds smaller features into larger ones, substantially reducing memory requirements for large-scale training on recommendation data.

While quantization has proven to be effective after pre-training and during fine-tuning, applying quantization in Transformers during pre-training has remained largely unexplored at scale for language modeling. This study aims to explore the impact of quantization for efficient pre-training of Transformers, with a focus on linear layer components. By systematically applying straightforward linear quantization to weights, activations, gradients, and optimizer states, we assess its effects on model efficiency, stability, and performance during training. By offering a comprehensive recipe of effective quantization strategies to be applied during the pre-training of Transformers, we promote high training efficiency from scratch while retaining language modeling ability. | Kamran Chitsaz, Quentin Fournier, Gonçalo Mordido, Sarath Chandar |  |

However, progress on the task has been held back by the scarcity of manually annotated video-text correspondence and the heavy concentration on English narrations of Hollywood movies. To address these issues, in this paper, we construct a large-scale multilingual video story dataset named Multilingual Synopses of Movie Narratives (M-SyMoN), containing 13,166 movie summary videos from 7 languages, as well as manual annotation of fine-grained video-text correspondences for 101.5 hours of video. Training on the human annotated data from SyMoN outperforms the SOTA methods by 15.7 and 16.2 percentage points on Clip Accuracy and Sentence IoU scores, respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of the annotations. As benchmarks for future research, we create 6 baseline approaches with different multilingual training strategies, compare... | Yidan Sun, Jianfei Yu, Boyang Li |  |

Subtle differences in low-level details can lead to substantial changes in high-level perception. For example, substituting the shopping bag held by a person with a gun suggests violent behavior, implying criminal or violent activity. Despite significant advancements in various multimodal tasks, Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) remain unexplored in their capabilities to conduct such multi-level visual perceptions.To investigate the perception gap between LVLMs and humans, we introduce MVP-Bench, the first visual–language benchmark systematically evaluating both low- and high-level visual perception of LVLMs. We construct MVP-Bench across natural and synthetic images to investigate how manipulated content influences model perception. Using MVP-Bench, we diagnose the visual perception of 10 open-source and 2 closed-source... | Guanzhen Li, Yuxi Xie, MinYen Kan |  |

The main challenges of topic modeling are finding the optimal number of topics, labeling the topics, segmenting documents by topic, and evaluating topic model performance. Current neural approaches have tackled some of these problems but none have been able to solve all of them. We introduce a novel topic modeling approach, Contextual-Top2Vec, which uses document contextual token embeddings, it creates hierarchical topics, finds topic spans within documents and labels topics with phrases rather than just words. We propose the use of BERTScore to evaluate topic coherence and to evaluate how informative topics are of the underlying documents. Our model outperforms the current state-of-the-art models on a comprehensive set of topic model evaluation metrics. | Dimo Angelov, Diana Inkpen |  |

However, their access to this repository is imprecise and they frequently hallucinate information that is not true or does not exist. A paradigm called Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) promises to fix these issues. Dense passage retrieval (DPR) is the first step in this paradigm. In this paper, we analyze the role of DPR fine-tuning and how it affects the model being trained. DPR fine-tunes pre-trained networks to enhance the alignment of the embeddings between queries and relevant textual data. We explore DPR-trained models mechanistically by using a combination of probing, layer activation analysis, and model editing. Our experiments show that DPR training decentralizes how knowledge is stored in the network, creating multiple access pathways to the same information. We also uncover a limitation in this training style: the internal knowledge of the pre-trained model bounds what the retrieval model can... | Benjamin Z. Reichman, Larry Heck |  |

Despite their success, existing methods typically rely on simple binary labels, such as those indicating preferred outputs in pairwise preferences, which fail to capture the subtle differences in relative quality between pairs. To address this limitation, we introduce an approach called Margin Matching Preference Optimization (MMPO), which incorporates relative quality margins into optimization, leading to improved LLM policies and reward models. Specifically, given quality margins in pairwise preferences, we design soft target probabilities based on the Bradley-Terry model, which are then used to train models with the standard cross-entropy objective. Experiments with both human and AI feedback data demonstrate that MMPO consistently outperforms baseline methods, often by a substantial... | Kyuyoung Kim, Ah Jeong Seo, Hao Liu, Jinwoo Shin, Kimin Lee |  |

To address this issue, we introduce AfriInstruct, which specializes in instruction-tuning of multiple African languages covering various tasks. We trained the LLaMa-2-7B using continual pretraining and instruction fine-tuning, which demonstrates superior performance across multiple tasks.

However, current CoT-based and RAG-based methods are still unsatisfactory in the era of LLMs because 1) CoT often overestimates the capabilities of LLMs and treats them as isolated knowledge Producers; thus, CoT only uses the inherent knowledge of LLM itself and then suffers from the hallucination and outdated knowledge, and 2) RAG underestimates LLMs because LLMs are the passive Receivers that can only use the knowledge retrieved by external retrievers. In contrast, this work regards LLMs as interactive Collaborators and proposes a novel DCRAG (Demands-Guided Collaborative RAG) to leverage the knowledge from both LLMs and the external knowledge graph. Specifically, DCRAG designs three Thought-then-Generate stages to collaboratively investigate knowledge demands, followed by a Demands-Guided Knowledge Retrieval to retrieve external knowledge by... | Jiong Yu, Sixing Wu, Jiahao Chen, Wei Zhou |  |

Many fact-checking approaches and tools have been developed, but they often lack appropriate explainability or granularity to be useful in various contexts. A text validation method that is easy to use, accessible, and can perform fine-grained evidence attribution has become crucial. More importantly, building user trust in such a method requires presenting the rationale behind each prediction, as research shows this significantly influences people’s belief in automated systems. Localizing and bringing users’ attention to the specific problematic content is also paramount, instead of providing simple blanket labels. In this paper, we present ClaimVer, a human-centric framework tailored to meet users’ informational and verification needs by generating rich... | Preetam Prabhu Srikar Dammu, Himanshu Naidu, Mouly Dewan, YoungMin Kim, Tanya Roosta, Aman Chadha, Chirag Shah |  |

We investigate a transition from VAE to text autoencoders (AE), which model a compact latent space and preserves the capability of the language model itself. Our method involves layer-wise latent vectors regularized by orthogonal constraints to encourage distinct semantic spaces. In particular, we estimate an empirical prior online from the learned latent vectors to support sampling during generation like VAE. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the autoencoders generate higher quality and more diverse text than the VAE-based Transformer baselines, offering an effective alternative for generative language modeling. | Yongjing Yin, Wenyang Gao, Haodong Wu, Jianhao Yan, Yue Zhang |  |

This approach falls short of pedagogically best practices and limits their effectiveness as educational tools. We term the objective of training LLMs to emulate effective teaching strategies as ‘pedagogical alignment.’ In this paper, we investigate Learning from Human Preferences () algorithms to achieve this alignment objective. A key challenge in this process is the scarcity of high-quality preference datasets to guide the alignment. To address this, we propose a novel approach for constructing a large-scale dataset using synthetic data generation techniques, eliminating the need for time-consuming and costly manual annotation. Leveraging this dataset, our experiments with Llama and Mistral models demonstrate that LHP methods outperform standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT), improving... | Shashank Sonkar, Kangqi Ni, Sapana Chaudhary, Richard G.

In this study, on QG benchmarks such as SQuAD and HotpotQA, we find that using human-written references cannot guarantee the effectiveness of the reference-based metrics. Most QG benchmarks have only one reference; we replicate the annotation process and collect another reference. A good metric is expected to grade a human-validated question no worse than generated questions. However, the results of reference-based metrics on our newly collected reference disproved the metrics themselves. We propose a reference-free metric consisted of multi-dimensional criteria such as naturalness, answerability, and complexity, utilizing large language models. These criteria are not constrained to the syntactic or semantic of a single reference question, and the metric does not require a diverse set of references. Experiments reveal that our metric accurately distinguishes between high-quality... | Bang Nguyen, Mengxia Yu, Yun Huang, Meng Jiang |  |

We show that this inference strategy can be sub-optimal for common regression and scoring evaluation metrics. As a remedy, we build on prior work on Minimum Bayes Risk decoding,and propose alternate inference strategies that estimate the Bayes-optimal solution for regression and scoring metrics in closed-form from sampled responses.We show that our proposal significantly improves over baselines across datasets and models. | Michal Lukasik, Harikrishna Narasimhan, Aditya Krishna Menon, Felix X.

Moving away from traditional rule-based and slot-filling methodologies, we introduce a novel approach, R3-NL2GQL, integrating both small and large Foundation Models for ranking, rewriting, and refining tasks. This method leverages the interpretative strengths of smaller models for initial ranking and rewriting stages, while capitalizing on the superior generalization and query generation prowess of larger models for the final transformation of natural language queries into GQL formats. Addressing the scarcity of datasets in this emerging field, we have developed a bilingual dataset, sourced from graph database manuals and selected open-source Knowledge Graphs (KGs).... | Yuhang Zhou, Yu He, Siyu Tian, Yuchen Ni, Zhangyue Yin, Xiang Liu, Chuanjun Ji, Sen Liu, Xipeng Qiu, Guangnan Ye, Hongfeng Chai |  |

However, in practical applications, LLMs may encounter outdated information, necessitating the filtering of such data and updating of knowledge beyond internal memory. This paper explores whether LLMs can selectively update their memories based on the time constraints between internal memory and external knowledge. We evaluate existing LLMs using three types of data that exhibit different time constraints. Our experimental results reveal the challenges most LLMs face with time-constrained knowledge and highlight the differences in how various LLMs handle such information. Additionally, to address the difficulties LLMs encounter in understanding time constraints, we propose a two-stage decoupling framework that separates the identification and computation of time constraint into a symbolic system. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework yields an... | Xin Wu, Yuqi Bu, Yi Cai, Tao Wang |  |

This process is commonly known as parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). Due to the scale of LLM, PEFT operations are usually executed in the public environment (e.g., cloud server). This necessitates sharing sensitive user data across public environments, thereby raising potential privacy concerns. To tackle these challenges, we propose a distributed PEFT framework called DLoRA. DLoRA enables scalable PEFT operations to be performed collaboratively between the cloud and user devices. Coupled with the proposed Kill and Revive algorithm, the evaluation results demonstrate that DLoRA can significantly reduce the computation and communication workload over user devices while achieving superior accuracy and privacy protection. | Chao Gao, Sai Qian Zhang |  |

Yet, they are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations and data poisoning attacks, particularly in tasks like text classification and translation. However, the adversarial robustness of abstractive text summarization models remains less explored. In this work, we unveil a novel approach by exploiting the inherent lead bias in summarization models, to perform adversarial perturbations. Furthermore, we introduce an innovative application of influence functions, to execute data poisoning, which compromises the model’s integrity. This approach not only shows a skew in the models’ behavior to produce desired outcomes but also shows a new behavioral change, where models under attack tend to generate extractive summaries rather than abstractive summaries. | Poojitha Thota, Shirin Nilizadeh |  |

This paper presents a new pretrained language model, ByT5-Sanskrit, designed for NLP applications involving the morphologically rich language Sanskrit. We evaluate ByT5-Sanskrit on established Sanskrit word segmentation tasks, where it outperforms previous data-driven approaches by a considerable margin and matches the performance of the current best lexicon-based model. It is easier to deploy and more robust to data not covered by external linguistic resources. It also achieves new state-of-the-art results in Vedic Sanskrit dependency parsing and OCR post-correction tasks. Additionally, based on the Digital Corpus of Sanskrit, we introduce a novel multitask dataset for the joint training of Sanskrit word segmentation, lemmatization, and morphosyntactic tagging tasks. We fine-tune ByT5-Sanskrit on this dataset, creating a versatile multitask model for various downstream Sanskrit... | Sebastian Nehrdich, Oliver Hellwig, Kurt Keutzer |  |

Existing embedding-based EA methods usually encode entities as embeddings, triples as embeddings’ constraint and learn to align the embeddings. However, the details of the underlying logical inference steps among the alignment process are usually omitted, resulting in inadequate inference process. In this paper, we introduce NALA, an entity alignment method that captures three types of logical inference paths with Non-Axiomatic Logic (NAL). Type 1&2 align the entity pairs and type 3 aligns relations. NALA iteratively aligns entities and relations by integrating the conclusions of the inference paths. Our method is logically interpretable and extensible by introducing NAL, and thus suitable for various EA settings. Experimental results show that NALA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of Hits@1, achieving 0.98+ on all three datasets of DBP15K with both supervised and unsupervised settings.... | Chuanhao Xu, Jingwei Cheng, Fu Zhang |  |

This task is challenging due to the need to accurately capture diverse facets of input queries. Existing iterative retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approaches often struggle to delve deeply into each facet of complex queries and integrate knowledge from various sources effectively. This paper introduces ConTReGen, a novel framework that employs a context-driven, tree-structured retrieval approach to enhance the depth and relevance of retrieved content. ConTReGen integrates a hierarchical, top-down in-depth exploration of query facets with a systematic bottom-up synthesis, ensuring comprehensive coverage and coherent integration of multifaceted information. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, including LFQA and ODSUM, alongside a newly introduced dataset, ODSUM-WikiHow, demonstrate that ConTReGen outperforms existing... | Kashob Kumar Roy, Pritom Saha Akash, Kevin ChenChuan Chang, Lucian Popa |  |

Alignment is challenging, costly, and needs to be repeated for every LLM and alignment criterion. We propose to decouple LLMs and alignment by training \*aligner\* models that can be used to align any LLM for a given criteria on an as-needed basis, thus also reducing the potential negative impacts of alignment on performance. Our recipe for training the aligner models solely relies on synthetic data generated with a (prompted) LLM and can be easily adjusted for a variety of alignment criteria. We use the same synthetic data to train \*inspectors\*, binary miss-alignment classification models to guide a \*squad\* of multiple aligners. Our empirical results demonstrate consistent improvements when applying aligner squad to various LLMs, including chat-aligned models, across several instruction-following and red-teaming datasets. | Lilian Ngweta, Mayank Agarwal, Subha Maity, Alex Gittens, Yuekai Sun, Mikhail Yurochkin |  |

While benchmarks like Chatbot Arena use human judges to assess model performance, they are resource-intensive and time-consuming. Alternative methods using LLMs as judges, such as AlpacaEval, MT Bench, WildBench, and InFoBench offer improvements but still do not capture that certain complex instruction aspects are more important than others to follow.To address this gap, we propose a novel evaluation metric, TOWER, that incorporates human-judged importance into the assessment of complex instruction following. We show that human annotators agree with tree-based representations of these complex instructions nearly as much as they agree with other human annotators. We release tree-based annotations of the InFoBench dataset and the corresponding evaluation code to facilitate future research. | Noah Ziems, Zhihan Zhang, Meng Jiang |  |

A notable challenge of MED is the long medical text usually contains multiple entities’ mentions with intricate correlations. However, limited by computation overhead, many existing methods consider only a single candidate entity mention during the disambiguation process. As such, they focus only on local MED optimal while ignoring the sole-mention disambiguation possibly boosted by richer context from other mentions’ disambiguating processes – missing global optimal on entity combination in the text. Motivated by this, we propose a new approach called Extractive Medical Entity Disambiguation with Memory Mechanism and Memorized Entity Information (M3E). Specifically, we reformulate MED as a text extraction task, which simultaneously accepts the context of medical mentions, all possible candidate entities, and entity definitions, and it is then trained to... | Guobiao Zhang, Xueping Peng, Tao Shen, Guodong Long, Jiasheng Si, Libo Qin, Wenpeng Lu |  |

However, this is a challenging task as it requires improvements in all aspects, including inference speed, fine-tuning speed, memory consumption, and, most importantly, model quality. Previous studies have attempted to achieve this by combining quantization with fine-tuning, but they have failed to enhance all four aspects simultaneously. In this study, we propose a new lightweight technique called Quantization for Efficient Fine-Tuning (QEFT). QEFT accelerates both inference and fine-tuning, is supported by robust theoretical foundations, offers high flexibility, and maintains good hardware compatibility. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that QEFT matches the quality and versatility of full-precision parameter-efficient fine-tuning, while using fewer resources.

Compositional generalization empowers LLMs to solve complex problems by combining foundational skills, a critical reasoning ability akin to human intelligence. However, even the most advanced LLMs currently struggle with this form of reasoning. We examine this problem within the framework of in-context learning and find that demonstrating both foundational skills and compositional examples grounded in these skills within the same prompt context is crucial. We refer to this prompt structure as skills-in-context (SKiC). With as few as two exemplars, this in-context learning structure enables LLMs to tackle more challenging problems requiring innovative skill combinations, achieving near-perfect systematic generalization across a broad range of tasks. Intriguingly, SKiC also unlocks the latent potential of LLMs, allowing them to more actively utilize pre-existing internal skills... | Jiaao Chen, Xiaoman Pan, Dian Yu, Kaiqiang Song, Xiaoyang Wang, Dong Yu, Jianshu Chen |  |

However, existing jailbreaking methods usually view a harmful prompt as a whole but they are not effective at reducing LLMs’ attention on combinations of words with malice, which well-aligned LLMs can easily reject. This paper discovers that decomposing a malicious prompt into separated sub-prompts can effectively reduce LLMs’ attention on harmful words by presenting them to LLMs in a fragmented form, thereby addressing these limitations and improving attack effectiveness. We introduce an automatic prompt Decomposition and Reconstruction framework for jailbreaking Attack (DrAttack). DrAttack consists of three key components: (a) ‘Decomposition’ of the original prompt into sub-prompts, (b) ‘Reconstruction’ of these sub-prompts implicitly by In-Context Learning with semantically similar but benign reassembling... | Xirui Li, Ruochen Wang, Minhao Cheng, Tianyi Zhou, ChoJui Hsieh |  |

Exploring Bias in Disease Diagnosis by Large Language Models](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.findings-emnlp.814) |  | 0 | The bias of disease prediction in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical yet underexplored issue, with potential implications for healthcare outcomes and equity. As LLMs increasingly find applications in healthcare, understanding and addressing their biases becomes paramount. This study focuses on this crucial topic, investigating the bias of disease prediction in models such as GPT-4, ChatGPT, and Qwen1.5-72b across gender, age range, and disease judgment behaviors. Utilizing a comprehensive real-clinical health record dataset of over 330,000 entries, we uncover that all three models exhibit distinct biases, indicating a pervasive issue of unfairness. To measure this, we introduce a novel metric–the diagnosis bias score, which reflects the ratio of prediction numbers to label numbers. Our in-depth analysis, based on this score, sheds light on the inherent biases in these models. In response to these findings, we propose a simple yet effective prompt-based solution to alleviate... | Yutian Zhao, Huimin Wang, Yuqi Liu, Suhuang Wu, Xian Wu, Yefeng Zheng |  |

LM-based agents equipped with planning, memory, and code execution capabilities have the potential to support data-driven science. However, evaluating agents on such open-ended tasks is challenging due to multiple valid approaches, partially correct steps, and different ways to express the same decisions. To address these challenges, we present BLADE, a benchmark to automatically evaluate agents’ multifaceted approaches to open-ended research questions. BLADE consists of 12 datasets and research questions drawn from existing scientific literature, with ground truth collected from independent analyses by expert data scientists and researchers.

Moreover, current literature rely on fixed expressions from language IDs, which results in the inadequate learning of language representations, and the failure to generate speech in unseen languages. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method that directly extracts linguistic features from audio input while effectively filtering out miscellaneous acoustic information including speaker-specific attributes like timbre. Subjective and objective evaluations affirm the effectiveness of our approach for multi-lingual text-to-speech, and highlight its superiority in low-resource transfer learning for previously unseen language. | Youngjae Kim, Yejin Jeon, Gary Geunbae Lee |  |

However, bilingual lexicons often have limited lexical overlap with task data, which results in poor translation coverage and lexicon utilization. We propose lexicon-conditioned data generation LexC-Gen, a method that generates low-resource-language classification task data at scale. Specifically, LexC-Gen first uses high-resource-language words from bilingual lexicons to generate lexicon-compatible task data, and then it translates them into low-resource languages with bilingual lexicons via word translation. Across 17 extremely low-resource languages, LexC-Gen generated data is competitive with expert-translated gold data, and yields on average 5.6 and 8.9 points improvement over existing lexicon-based word translation methods on sentiment analysis and topic classification tasks respectively. Through ablation study, we... | Zheng Xin Yong, Cristina Menghini, Stephen H. Bach |  |

Having LLMs role-play based on demographic information sometimes improves human likeness but often does not. This study assessed whether LLM alignment with human behavior can be improved by integrating information from empirically-derived human belief networks. Using data from a human survey, we estimated a belief network encompassing 64 topics loading on nine non-overlapping latent factors. We then seeded LLM-based agents with an opinion on one topic, and assessed the alignment of its expressed opinions on remaining test topics with corresponding human data. Role-playing based on demographic information alone did not align LLM and human opinions, but seeding the agent with a single belief greatly improved alignment for topics related in the belief network, and not for topics outside the network. These results suggest a novel path for human-LLM belief alignment in work seeking to simulate... | YunShiuan Chuang, Krirk Nirunwiroj, Zach Studdiford, Agam Goyal, Vincent Frigo, Sijia Yang, Dhavan Shah, Junjie Hu, Timothy T.

Previous works have explored end-to-end models to improve the quality and robustness of SLU models with Deliberation, however these models have remained autoregressive, resulting in higher latencies. In this work we introduce PRoDeliberation, a novel method leveraging a Connectionist Temporal Classification-based decoding strategy as well as a denoising objective to train robust non-autoregressive deliberation models. We show that PRoDeliberation achieves the latency reduction of parallel decoding (2-10x improvement over autoregressive models) while retaining the ability to correct Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) mistranscriptions of autoregressive deliberation systems. We further show that the design of the denoising training allows PRoDeliberation to overcome the limitations of small ASR devices, and we provide analysis on the... | Trang Le, Daniel Lazar, Suyoun Kim, Shan Jiang, Duc Le, Adithya Sagar, Aleksandr Livshits, Ahmed Aly, Akshat Shrivastava |  |

A prominent family of watermarking strategies for LLMs embeds this signal by upsampling a (pseudorandomly-chosen) subset of tokens at every generation step. However, such signals alter the model’s output distribution and can have unintended effects on its downstream performance. In this work, we evaluate the performance of LLMs watermarked using three different strategies over a diverse suite of tasks including those cast as k-class classification (CLS), multiple choice question answering (MCQ), short-form generation (e.g., open-ended question answering) and long-form generation (e.g., translation) tasks. We find that watermarks (under realistic hyperparameters) can cause significant drops in LLMs’ effective utility across all tasks. We observe drops of 10 to 20% in CLS tasks in the average case, which shoot up to 100% in the worst case. We notice degradations... | Anirudh Ajith, Sameer Singh, Danish Pruthi |  |

However, real-world data is inherently multimodal, often blending images such as symbols, faces, icons, patterns, and charts with textual content in tables. With the evolution of AI models capable of multimodal reasoning, it is pertinent to assess their efficacy in handling such structured data. This study investigates whether current AI models can perform knowledge-aware reasoning on multimodal structured data. We explore their ability to reason on tables that integrate both images and text, introducing MMTabQA, a new dataset designed for this purpose. Our experiments highlight substantial challenges for current AI models in effectively integrating and interpreting multiple text and image inputs, understanding visual context, and comparing visual content across images.

Our findings show that sentence representations derived from LLMs exhibit a high degree of isomorphism across languages.This existing isomorphism can facilitate representational alignments in zero-shot and few-shot settings.Specifically, by applying a contrastive objective at the representation level with only a small number of translation pairs (e.g., 100), we substantially improve models’ performance on Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) tasks across languages. This representation-level approach proves to be more efficient and effective for semantic alignment than continued pretraining or instruction tuning. Interestingly, we also observe substantial STS improvements within individual languages, even without a monolingual objective specifically designed for this purpose. | Di Wu, Yibin Lei, Andrew Yates, Christof Monz |  |

We introduce Storytelling With Action Guidance (SWAG), a novel approach to storytelling with LLMs. Our approach reduces story writing to a search problem through a two-model feedback loop: one LLM generates story content, and another auxiliary LLM is used to choose the next best “action” to steer the story’s future direction. Our results show that SWAG can substantially outperform previous end-to-end story generation techniques when evaluated by GPT-4 and through human evaluation. Our SWAG pipeline using only small open-source models surpasses GPT-3.5-Turbo. | Jonathan Pei, Zeeshan Patel, Karim ElRefai, Tianle Li |  |

Recently, the number of labels has become larger and larger, especially in the applications of e-commerce, so handling text-related e-commerce problems further requires a large memory space in many existing multi-label learning methods. To address the space concern, utilizing a distributed system to share that large memory requirement is a possible solution. We propose “random label forests,” a distributed ensemble method with label subsampling, for handling extremely large-scale labels. Random label forests can reduce memory usage per computer while keeping competitive performances over real-world data sets. | ShengWei Chen, ChihJen Lin |  |

We hypothesize that users of conversational systems want a more personalized experience, and existing work shows that users are highly receptive to personalized questions (PQs). Question Generation tasks, however, focus on factual questions from textual excerpts. To create a PQ generator, we first identify over 400 real user interests by anonymously aggregating ~39K user models. We then populate prompt templates with these 400 interests and use an LLM to generate PQs customized to user interests. The result is PerQs, a novel corpus of ~19K question/answer pairs. We evaluate PerQs at scale in the unique context of the Alexa Prize. Our results show significant positive effects on perceived conversation quality. We then fine-tune, deploy, and evaluate PerQy, a neural model that generates PQs in real-time. When evaluated against several competitive LLM baselines, PerQy produced the most... | Kevin Bowden, Yue Fan, Winson Chen, Wen Cui, Davan Harrison, Xin Wang, Marilyn A. Walker |  |

In contrast, the Selective Scan Structured State-Space Model, or Mamba, addresses this computational challenge effectively. This paper explores a query-based cross-modal projector designed to bolster Mamba’s efficiency for vision-language modeling by compressing visual tokens based on input through the cross-attention mechanism. This innovative projector also removes the need for manually designing the 2D scan order of original image features when converting them into an input sequence for Mamba LLM. Experimental results across various vision-language understanding benchmarks show that the proposed cross-modal projector enhances Mamba-based multimodal LLMs, boosting both performance and throughput. | SooHwan Eom, Jay Shim, Gwanhyeong Koo, Haebin Na, Mark HasegawaJohnson, Sungwoong Kim, Chang Dong Yoo |  |

Recently, large language models (LLMs) are gradually applied to classification tasks with converting original objective into the generation task via in-context learning. However, abundance of the classifier categories poses challenges in selecting demonstrations. Moreover, the mapping between category labels and textual descriptions requires expensive expert knowledge, thereby constraining the efficacy of in-context learning for LLMs. We uphold that SLM is optimal for handling classification tasks, and its shortcomings in the low resource setting can be mitigated by leveraging LLM. Hence, we propose a co-evolution strategy on SLM & LLM for relation identification. Specifically, LLM provides essential background knowledge to assist training process of the SLM classifier, while evaluation metrics from the classifier, in turn, offer... | Zhe Yang, Yi Huang, Yaqin Chen, Xiaoting Wu, Junlan Feng, Chao Deng |  |

Current methods face significant limitations: (I) inadequate capabilities for conversation anticipation, (II) computational inefficiencies due to costly simulations, and (III) neglect of valuable past dialogue experiences. To address these limitations, we propose a new framework, Experiential Policy Learning (EPL), for enhancing such dialogues. EPL embodies the principle of Learning From Experience, facilitating anticipation with an experiential scoring function that estimates dialogue state potential using similar past interactions stored in long-term memory. To demonstrate its flexibility, we introduce Tree-structured EPL (T-EPL) as one possible training-free realization with Large Language Models (LLMs) and Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). T-EPL assesses past dialogue states with LLMs while utilizing MCTS to... | Huy Dao, Yang Deng, KhanhHuyen Bui, Dung D. Le, Lizi Liao |  |

In this work, we present Factcheck-Bench, a holistic end-to-end framework for annotating and evaluating the factuality of LLM-generated responses, which encompasses a multi-stage annotation scheme designed to yield detailed labels for fact-checking and correcting not just the final prediction, but also the intermediate steps that a fact-checking system might need to take. Based on this framework, we construct an open-domain factuality benchmark in three-levels of granularity: claim, sentence, and document. We further propose a system, Factcheck-GPT, which follows our framework, and we show that it outperforms several popular LLM fact-checkers. We make our annotation tool, annotated data, benchmark, and code available at https://github.com/yuxiaw/Factcheck-GPT. | Yuxia Wang, Revanth Gangi Reddy, Zain Muhammad Mujahid, Arnav Arora, Aleksandr Rubashevskii, Jiahui Geng, Osama Mohammed Afzal, Liangming Pan, Nadav Borenstein, Aditya Pillai, Isabelle Augenstein, Iryna Gurevych, Preslav Nakov |  |

Open-RAG uniquely trains the model to navigate challenging distractors that appear relevant but are misleading. By combining the constructive learning and architectural transformation, Open-RAG leverages latent learning, dynamically selecting relevant experts and integrating external knowledge effectively... | Shayekh Bin Islam, Md.

This surge has accelerated efforts to improve the accessibility of counseling by using large language models (LLMs) as counselors. To ensure client privacy, training open-source LLMs faces a key challenge: the absence of realistic counseling datasets. To address this, we introduce Cactus, a multi-turn dialogue dataset that emulates real-life interactions using the goal-oriented and structured approach of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).We create a diverse and realistic dataset by designing clients with varied, specific personas, and having counselors systematically apply CBT techniques in their interactions. To assess the quality of our data, we benchmark against established psychological criteria used to evaluate real counseling sessions, ensuring alignment with expert evaluations.Experimental results demonstrate that Camel, a model trained... | Suyeon Lee, Sunghwan Kim, Minju Kim, Dongjin Kang, Dongil Yang, Harim Kim, Minseok Kang, Dayi Jung, Min Hee Kim, Seungbeen Lee, KyoungMee Chung, Youngjae Yu, Dongha Lee, Jinyoung Yeo |  |

Given the incredible ability of Large language models (LLMs) in both natural language understanding and generation, we believe that we could customize an LLM to help people create compelling graphical layouts starting with only text instructions from the user. We call our method TextLap (text-based layout planning). It uses a curated instruction-based layout planning dataset (InsLap) to customize LLMs as a graphic designer. Human annotators are asked to build a benchmark to evaluate different layout planning models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TextLap and show that it outperforms strong baselines, including GPT-4 based methods, for document generation and graphical design benchmarks. | Jian Chen, Ruiyi Zhang, Yufan Zhou, Jennifer Healey, Jiuxiang Gu, Zhiqiang Xu, Changyou Chen |  |

We derive coreference chains from a corpus of 30 million biomedical abstracts and construct a graph based on the string phrases within these chains, establishing connections between phrases if they co-occur within the same coreference chain. We then use the graph structure and the betweeness centrality measure to distinguish between edges denoting hierarchy, identity and noise, assign directionality to edges denoting hierarchy, and split nodes (strings) that correspond to multiple distinct concepts. The result is a rich, data-driven ontology over concepts in the biomedical domain, parts of which overlaps significantly with human-authored ontologies. We release the coreference chains and resulting ontology... | Shir AshuryTahan, Amir David Nissan Cohen, Nadav Cohen, Yoram Louzoun, Yoav Goldberg |  |

However, existing retrievers are typically optimized towards information that directly targets the question, missing out on such contextual information. Furthermore, there is a lack of training data for relevant context. To this end, we propose and compare different weak supervision techniques to optimize retrieval for contextual information. Experiments demonstrate improvements on the end-to-end QA performance on ASQA, a dataset for long-form question answering. Importantly, as more contextual information is retrieved, we improve the relevant page recall for LFQA by 14.7% and the groundedness of generated long-form answers by 12.5%. Finally, we show that long-form answers often anticipate likely follow-up questions, via experiments on a conversational QA dataset. | Philipp Christmann, Svitlana Vakulenko, Ionut Sorodoc, Bill Byrne, Adrià de Gispert |  |

These rationales have been found to enhance LLM performance across various NLP tasks. Recently, there has been growing interest in using these rationales to provide insights for various important downstream tasks. In this paper, we analyze generated free-text rationales in tasks with subjective answers, emphasizing the importance of rationalization in such scenarios. We focus on pairwise argument ranking, a highly subjective task with significant potential for real-world applications, such as debate assistance. We evaluate the persuasiveness of rationales generated by nine LLMs to support their subjective choices. Our findings suggest that open-source LLMs, particularly Llama2-70B-chat, are capable of providing highly persuasive rationalizations, surpassing even GPT models. Additionally, our experiments demonstrate that the persuasiveness of the generated rationales can be enhanced by... | Mohamed Elaraby, Diane J. Litman, Xiang Li, Ahmed Magooda |  |

Despite the varying significance of different textual elements within a sentence depending on the context, efforts to account for variation of importance in constructing text embeddings have been lacking. We propose a framework of Semantic Token Reweighting to build Interpretable text embeddings (SToRI), which incorporates controllability as well. SToRI refines the text encoding process in CLIP by differentially weighting semantic elements based on contextual importance, enabling finer control over emphasis responsive to data-driven insights and user preferences. The efficacy of SToRI is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on few-shot image classification and image retrieval tailored to user preferences. | Eunji Kim, Kyuhong Shim, Simyung Chang, Sungroh Yoon |  |

However, conflicting knowledge can be present in the LM’s parameters, termed intra-memory conflict, which can affect a model’s propensity to accept contextual knowledge. To study the effect of intra-memory conflict on LM’s ability to accept the relevant context, we utilise two knowledge conflict measures and a novel dataset containing inherently conflicting data, DYNAMICQA. This dataset includes facts with a temporal dynamic nature where facts can change over time and disputable dynamic facts, which can change depending on the viewpoint. DYNAMICQA is the first to include real-world knowledge conflicts and provide context to study the link between the different types of knowledge conflicts. We also evaluate several measures on their ability to reflect the presence of intra-memory conflict: semantic... | Sara Marjanovic, Haeun Yu, Pepa Atanasova, Maria Maistro, Christina Lioma, Isabelle Augenstein |  |

The Case of Text Detoxification](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.findings-emnlp.839) |  | 0 | The lack of high-quality training data remains a significant challenge in NLP. Manual annotation methods, such as crowdsourcing, are costly, require intricate task design skills, and, if used incorrectly, may result in poor data quality. From the other hand, LLMs have demonstrated proficiency in many NLP tasks, including zero-shot and few-shot data annotation. However, they often struggle with text detoxification due to alignment constraints and fail to generate the required detoxified text. This work explores the potential of modern open source LLMs to annotate parallel data for text detoxification. Using the recent technique of activation patching, we generate a pseudo-parallel detoxification dataset based on ParaDetox. The detoxification model trained on our generated data shows comparable performance to the original dataset in automatic detoxification evaluation metrics and superior quality in manual evaluation and side-by-side comparisons. | Daniil Moskovskiy, Sergey Pletenev, Alexander Panchenko |  |

This issue can be partially mitigated by applying lightweight models as an acquisition model, but it can lead to the acquisition-successor mismatch (ASM) problem. Previous works show that the ASM problem can be partially alleviated by using distilled versions of a successor models as acquisition ones. However, distilled versions of pretrained models are not always available. Also, the exact pipeline of model distillation that does not lead to the ASM problem is not clear. To address these issues, we propose to use adapters as an alternative to full fine-tuning for acquisition model training. Since adapters are lightweight, this approach reduces the training cost of the model. We provide empirical evidence that it does not cause the ASM problem and can help to deploy active learning in practical NLP tasks. | Daria Galimzianova, Leonid Sanochkin |  |

Even Task-Oriented Constraints in Instructions Affect LLM-Generated Text Detection](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.findings-emnlp.841) |  | 0 | To combat the misuse of Large Language Models (LLMs), many recent studies have presented LLM-generated-text detectors with promising performance. When users instruct LLMs to generate texts, the instruction can include different constraints depending on the user’s need. However, most recent studies do not cover such diverse instruction patterns when creating datasets for LLM detection. In this paper, we reveal that even task-oriented constraints — constraints that would naturally be included in an instruction and are not related to detection-evasion — cause existing powerful detectors to have a large variance in detection performance. We focus on student essay writing as a realistic domain and manually create task-oriented constraints based on several factors for essay quality. Our experiments show that the standard deviation (SD) of current detector performance on texts generated by an instruction with such a constraint is significantly larger (up to an SD of 14.4 F1-score) than that... | Ryuto Koike, Masahiro Kaneko, Naoaki Okazaki |  |

In Natural Language Inference (NLI) earlier approaches to capturing HLV involve either collecting annotations from many crowd workers to represent human judgment distribution (HJD) or use expert linguists to provide detailed explanations for their chosen labels. While the former method provides denser HJD information, obtaining it is resource-intensive. In contrast, the latter offers richer textual information but it is challenging to scale up to many human judges. Besides, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators (“LLM judges”) but with mixed results, and few works aim to study HJDs. This study proposes to exploit LLMs to approximate HJDs using a small number of expert labels and explanations. Our experiments show that a few explanations significantly improve LLMs’ ability to approximate HJDs with and without... | Beiduo Chen, Xinpeng Wang, Siyao Peng, Robert Litschko, Anna Korhonen, Barbara Plank |  |

We claim that many of the observed shortcomings can be attributed to violation of one or more conversational principles. By drawing upon extensive research from both the social science and AI communities, we propose a set of maxims – quantity, quality, relevance, manner, benevolence, and transparency – for describing effective human-AI conversation. We first justify the applicability of the first four maxims (from Grice) in the context of human-AI interactions. We then argue that two new maxims, benevolence (concerning the generation of, and engagement with, harmful content) and transparency (concerning recognition of one’s knowledge boundaries, operational constraints, and intents), are necessary for addressing behavior unique to modern human-AI interactions. We evaluate the degree to which various language models are able to understand these maxims and find that... | Erik Miehling, Manish Nagireddy, Prasanna Sattigeri, Elizabeth Daly, David Piorkowski, John T.

However, existing methods for such knowledge editing still face difficulties with multi-hop questions that require accurate fact identification and sequential logical reasoning, particularly among numerous fact updates. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces Graph Memory-based Editing for Large Language Models (GMeLLo), a straightforward and effective method that merges the explicit knowledge representation of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with the linguistic flexibility of LLMs. Beyond merely leveraging LLMs for question answering, GMeLLo employs these models to convert free-form language into structured queries and fact triples, facilitating seamless interaction with KGs for rapid updates and precise multi-hop reasoning. Our results show that GMeLLo significantly surpasses current state-of-the-art (SOTA) knowledge... | Ruirui Chen, Weifeng Jiang, Chengwei Qin, Ishaan Singh Rawal, Cheston Tan, Dongkyu Choi, Bo Xiong, Bo Ai |  |

These approaches commonly use a binary cross-entropy mechanism on pairwise samples, i.e., minimizing and maximizing the loss based on preferred or dis-preferred responses, respectively. However, while this training strategy omits the reward model, it also overlooks the varying preference degrees within different responses. We hypothesize that this is a key factor hindering LLMs from sufficiently understanding human preferences. To address this problem, we propose a novel Self-supervised Preference Optimization (SPO) framework, which constructs a self-supervised preference degree loss combined with the alignment loss, thereby helping LLMs improve their ability to understand the degree of preference. Extensive experiments are conducted on two widely used... | Jian Li, Haojing Huang, Yujia Zhang, Pengfei Xu, Xi Chen, Rui Song, Lida Shi, Jingwen Wang, Hao Xu |  |

The influence of parametric world knowledge of large language models (LLMs) often causes role-playing characters to act out of character and to hallucinate about things outside the scope of their knowledge. In this work, we focus on the evaluation and mitigation of hallucination in fictional character role-play. We introduce a dataset with over 2,000 characters and 72,000 interviews, including 18,000 adversarial questions. We propose RoleFact, a role-playing method that mitigates hallucination by modulating the influence of parametric knowledge using a pre-calibrated confidence threshold. Experiments show that the proposed method improves the factual precision of generated responses by 18% for adversarial questions with a 44% reduction in temporal hallucination for time-sensitive interviews.

Moreover, irony is highly subjective and can depend on various factors, such as social, cultural, or generational aspects. This paper explores whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can learn to generate ironic responses to social media posts. To do so, we fine-tune two models to generate ironic and non-ironic content and deeply analyze their outputs’ linguistic characteristics, their connection to the original post, and their similarity to the human-written replies. We also conduct a large-scale human evaluation of the outputs. Additionally, we investigate whether LLMs can learn a form of irony tied to a generational perspective, with mixed results. | Pier Felice Balestrucci, Silvia Casola, Soda Marem Lo, Valerio Basile, Alessandro Mazzei |  |

This necessitates not only the parsing of temporal information within questions but also the identification and understanding of time-evolving facts to generate accurate answers. However, current large language models still have limited sensitivity to temporal information and their inadequate temporal reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that enhances temporal awareness and reasoning through Temporal Information-Aware Embedding and Granular Contrastive Reinforcement Learning. Experimental results on four TSQA datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing LLMs in TSQA tasks, marking a step forward in bridging the performance gap between machine and human temporal understanding and reasoning. | Wanqi Yang, Yanda Li, Meng Fang, Ling Chen |  |

BC improves conversational engagement by providing timely acknowledgments and encouraging the speaker to talk. This study investigates the effect of BC provided by an AI agent on conversational engagement, offering insights for future AI conversational service design. We conducted an experiment with 55 participants, divided into Todak_BC and Todak_NoBC groups based on the presence or absence of the BC feature in Todak, a conversational agent. Each participant engaged in nine sessions with predetermined subjects and questions. We collected and analyzed approximately 6 hours and 30 minutes of conversation logs to evaluate conversational engagement using both quantitative (conversation persistence, including conversation duration and number of utterances) and qualitative metrics (context... | Jin Yea Jang, Saim Shin, Gahgene Gweon |  |

Fine-grained propaganda detection and extraction of textual spans where propaganda techniques are used, are essential for more informed content consumption. Automatic systems targeting the task over lower resourced languages are limited, usually obstructed by lack of large scale training datasets. Our study investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, can effectively extract propagandistic spans. We further study the potential of employing the model to collect more cost-effective annotations. Finally, we examine the effectiveness of labels provided by GPT-4 in training smaller language models for the task. The experiments are performed over a large-scale in-house manually annotated dataset. The results suggest that providing more annotation context to GPT-4 within prompts improves its performance compared to human annotators. Moreover, when... | Maram Hasanain, Fatema Ahmad, Firoj Alam |  |

It not only shortens the inference time and reduces computational costs during the usage of large language models, but also lowers expenses when using closed-source models. In a preliminary study, we discover that when instructing language models to compress prompts, different compression styles (e.g., extractive or abstractive) impact performance of compressed prompts on downstream tasks. Building on this insight, we propose Style-Compress, a lightweight framework that adapts a smaller language model to compress prompts for a larger model on a new task without additional training. Our approach iteratively generates and selects effective compressed prompts as task-specific demonstrations through style variation and in-context learning, enabling smaller models to act as efficient compressors with task-specific examples. Style-Compress outperforms two baseline compression models... | Xiao Pu, Tianxing He, Xiaojun Wan |  |

However, while assessing the quality of an LLM, the focus often tends to be solely on its performance on downstream tasks, while very little to no attention is paid to prompt sensitivity. To fill this gap, we propose POSIX – a novel PrOmpt Sensitivity IndeX as a reliable measure of prompt sensitivity, thereby offering a more comprehensive evaluation of LLM performance. The key idea behind POSIX is to capture the relative change in loglikelihood of a given response upon replacing the corresponding prompt with a different intent-preserving prompt.

While existing RPAs well portray the characters’ knowledge and tones, they face challenges in capturing their minds, especially for small role-playing language models (RPLMs). In this paper, we propose to enhance RPLMs via personality-indicative data. Specifically, we leverage questions from psychological scales and distill advanced RPAs to generate dialogues that grasp the minds of characters. Experimental results validate that RPLMs trained with our dataset exhibit advanced role-playing capabilities for both general and personality-related evaluations. | Yiting Ran, Xintao Wang, Rui Xu, Xinfeng Yuan, Jiaqing Liang, Yanghua Xiao, Deqing Yang |  |

Traditional methods like top-k and top-𝜋 decoding locally normalise the model’s output, which can significantly distort the original distribution. In this paper, we investigate the effects of such distortions by introducing globally-normalised versions of these decoding methods. Further, we propose an independent Metropolis-Hastings (IMH) algorithm to approximate sampling from these globally-normalised distributions without explicitly computing them. Our empirical analyses compare the performance of local and global decoding across two algorithms (top-k and top-𝜋) with various hyperparameters, using the Pythia language models. Results show that in most configuration, global decoding performs worse than the local decoding versions of the same algorithms, despite preserving the distribution’s integrity. Our results thus... | Daniel Gareev, Thomas Hofmann, Ezhilmathi Krishnasamy, Tiago Pimentel |  |

To address this challenge, we introduce LEGOBench, a benchmark for evaluating systems that generate scientific leaderboards. LEGOBench is curated from 22 years of preprint submission data on arXiv and more than 11k machine learning leaderboards on the PapersWithCode portal. We present a language model-based and four graph-based leaderboard generation task configuration. We evaluate popular encoder-only scientific language models as well as decoder-only large language models across these task configurations. State-of-the-art models showcase significant performance gaps in automatic leaderboard generation on LEGOBench. The code is available on GitHub and the dataset is hosted on OSF. | Shruti Singh, Shoaib Alam, Husain Malwat, Mayank Singh |  |

Traditional LQA approaches typically either select the optimal answers from an answer set or extract answers from law texts. However, they often struggle to provide relevant answers to complex, real-world questions due to the rigidity of predetermined answers. Although recent advancements in legal large language models have shown some potential in enhancing answer relevance, they fail to address the multiple user-specific circumstances, i.e., factual details in questions. To address these issues, we (1) construct the first publicly available legal community question-answering (LegalCQA) dataset; and (2) propose a Hierarchical Legal Knowledge Integration (H-LegalKI) framework. LegalCQA is collected from two widely used legal forums for developing user-centered LQA models. For H-LegalKI, we design a legal knowledge retriever that gathers... | Yue Jiang, Ziyu Guan, Jie Zhao, Wei Zhao, Jiaqi Yang |  |

While a major direction to enhance inconsistency detection is to derive stronger Natural Language Inference (NLI) models, we propose an orthogonal aspect that underscores the importance of incorporating task-specific taxonomy into the inference. To this end, we consolidate key error types of inconsistent facts in summaries, and incorporate them to facilitate both the zero-shot and supervised paradigms of LLMs. Extensive experiments on ten datasets of five distinct domains suggest that, zero-shot LLM inference could benefit from the explicit solution space depicted by the error type taxonomy, and achieves state-of-the-art performance overall, surpassing specialized non-LLM baselines, as well as recent LLM baselines. We further distill models that fuse the taxonomy into parameters through our designed prompt completions and supervised training strategies, efficiently substituting... | Liyan Xu, Zhenlin Su, Mo Yu, Jin Xu, Jinho D.

One of the key issues for long-sequence modeling using attention-based model is the mismatch between the limited-range modeling power of full attention and the long-range token dependency in the input sequence. In this work, we propose to scale up the attention receptive field by tensorizing long input sequences into compact tensor representations followed by attention on each transformed dimension. The resulting Tensorized Attention can be adopted as efficient transformer backbones to extend input context length with improved memory and time efficiency. We show that the proposed attention tensorization encodes token dependencies as a multi-hop attention process, and is equivalent to Kronecker decomposition of full attention. Extensive experiments show that tensorized attention can be used to adapt pretrained LLMs... | Aosong Feng, Rex Ying, Leandros Tassiulas |  |

Romanized Bangla texts are ubiquitous on the internet, offering a rich source of data for Bangla NLP tasks and extending the available data sources. However, due to the informal nature of romanized text, they often lack the structure and consistency needed to provide insights. We address these challenges by proposing: (1) BanglaTLit, the large-scale Bangla transliteration dataset consisting of 42.7k samples, (2) BanglaTLit-PT, a pre-training corpus on romanized Bangla with 245.7k samples, (3) encoders further-pretrained on BanglaTLit-PT achieving state-of-the-art performance in several romanized Bangla classification tasks, and (4) multiple back-transliteration baseline methods, including a novel encoder-decoder architecture using further pre-trained encoders. Our results show the potential of automated Bangla back-transliteration in utilizing the untapped sources of romanized Bangla to enrich this... | Md Fahim, Fariha Tanjim Shifat, Fabiha Haider, Deeparghya Dutta Barua, Md Sakib Ul Rahman Sourove, Md Farhan Ishmam, Md Bhuiyan |  |

Results demonstrate that smaller BPE configurations, notably 2k, 5k, and 8k consistently yield higher BLEU scores, indicating improved translation quality through finer tokenization granularity. Conversely, larger BPE configurations and the absence of BPE result in lower BLEU scores, suggesting a decline in translation quality due to coarser tokenization. Additionally, these findings help us understand how the size of the model and how finely we break down words affect the quality of translations. This knowledge will be useful for improving translation systems, especially for languages that don’t have many parallel texts available for training. | Kristine Mae M. Adlaon, Nelson Marcos |  |

Evaluating the Emotional and Empathic Comprehension of LMs](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.findings-emnlp.861) |  | 0 | Empathy plays a pivotal role in fostering prosocial behavior, often triggered by the sharing of personal experiences through narratives. However, modeling empathy using NLP approaches remains challenging due to its deep interconnection with human interaction dynamics. Previous approaches, which involve fine-tuning language models (LMs) on human-annotated empathic datasets, have had limited success. In our pursuit of improving empathy understanding in LMs, we propose several strategies, including contrastive learning with masked LMs and supervised fine-tuning with large language models. While these methods show improvements over previous methods, the overall results remain unsatisfactory. To better understand this trend, we performed an analysis which reveals a low agreement among annotators. This lack of consensus hinders training and highlights the subjective nature of the task. We also explore the cultural impact on annotations. To study this, we meticulously collected story pairs... | Muhammad Arslan Manzoor, Yuxia Wang, Minghan Wang, Preslav Nakov |  |

To address this, we introduce the EU DisinfoTest, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the efficacy of Language Models in identifying disinformation narratives. Developed through a Human-in-the-Loop methodology and grounded in research from EU DisinfoLab, the EU DisinfoTest comprises more than 1,300 narratives. Our benchmark includes persuasive elements under Logos, Pathos, and Ethos rhetorical dimensions. We assessed state-of-the-art LLMs, including the newly released GPT-4o, on their capability to perform zero-shot classification of disinformation narratives versus credible narratives. Our findings reveal that LLMs tend to regard narratives with authoritative appeals as trustworthy, while those with emotional appeals are frequently incorrectly classified as disinformative. These findings highlight the challenges LLMs face... | Witold Sosnowski, Arkadiusz Modzelewski, Kinga Skorupska, Jahna Otterbacher, Adam Wierzbicki |  |

However, the increasing length of prompts leads to high computational costs and often obscures crucial information. Prompt compression has been proposed to alleviate these issues, but it faces challenges in (i) capturing the global context and (ii) training the compressor effectively. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel prompt compression method, namely Reading To Compressing (R2C), utilizing the Fusion-in-Decoder (FiD) architecture to identify the important information in the prompt. Specifically, the cross-attention scores of the FiD are used to discern essential chunks and sentences from the prompt. R2C effectively captures the global context without compromising semantic consistency while detouring the necessity of pseudo-labels for training the compressor. Empirical results show that R2C retains key contexts, enhancing the LLM performance... | Eunseong Choi, Sunkyung Lee, Minjin Choi, June Park, Jongwuk Lee |  |

Previous methods focus on equally treating the contribution of each modality or statically using text as the dominant modality to conduct interaction, which neglects the situation where each modality may become dominant. In this paper, we propose a Knowledge-Guided Dynamic Modality Attention Fusion Framework (KuDA) for multimodal sentiment analysis. KuDA uses sentiment knowledge to guide the model dynamically selecting the dominant modality and adjusting the contributions of each modality. In addition, with the obtained multimodal representation, the model can further highlight the contribution of dominant modality through the correlation evaluation loss. Extensive experiments on four MSA benchmark datasets indicate that KuDA achieves state-of-the-art performance and is able to adapt to different scenarios of dominant modality. | Xinyu Feng, Yuming Lin, Lihua He, You Li, Liang Chang, Ya Zhou |  |

However, the area of data collection for instruction fine-tuning in machine translation remains relatively underexplored. In this paper, we present LexMatcher, a simple yet effective method for data curation,the design of which is driven by the coverage of senses found in bilingual dictionaries. The construction process comprises data retrieval from an existing corpus and data augmentation that supplements the infrequent senses of polysemous words. Utilizing LLaMA2 as our base model, our method outperforms the established baselines on the WMT2022 test sets and also exhibits remarkable performance in tasks related to word sense disambiguation and specialized terminology translation. Our method is also applicable to other pre-trained models, and complements the method... | Yongjing Yin, Jiali Zeng, Yafu Li, Fandong Meng, Yue Zhang |  |

Experiment results on validation set in MultiDoc2Dial show that the proposed SARSAT leads to improvement over strong baselines on both seen and unseen settings and achieves the start-of the-art performance, even with the base reader using the pretrained T5-base model. | JeongDoo Lee, Hyeongjun Choi, Beomseok Hong, Youngsub Han, ByoungKi Jeon, SeungHoon Na |  |

Context-aware models have been previously suggested as a means to mitigate this type of bias. In this work, we examine this claim by analysing in detail the translation of stereotypical professions in English to German, and translation with non-informative context in Basque to Spanish. Our results show that, although context-aware models can significantly enhance translation accuracy for feminine terms, they can still maintain or even amplify gender bias. These results highlight the need for more fine-grained approaches to bias mitigation in Neural Machine Translation. | Harritxu Gete, Thierry Etchegoyhen |  |

Estimating the effectiveness of an automatic evaluation metric, termed meta-evaluation, is a critically important research question. In this position paper, we review recent meta-evaluation practices for summarisation evaluation metrics and find that (1) evaluation metrics are primarily meta-evaluated on datasets consisting of examples from news summarisation datasets, and (2) there has been a noticeable shift in research focus towards evaluating the faithfulness of generated summaries. We argue that the time is ripe to build more diverse benchmarks that enable the development of more robust evaluation metrics and analyze the generalization ability of existing evaluation metrics. In addition, we call for research focusing on user-centric quality dimensions that consider the generated summary’s communicative goal and the role of summarisation in the... | Xiang Dai, Sarvnaz Karimi, Biaoyan Fang |  |

Counterfactuals (CFs), where minimal changes to inputs flip a model’s prediction, offer a way to explain these models. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in NLP tasks, their efficacy in generating high-quality CFs remains uncertain. This work fills this gap by investigating how well LLMs generate CFs for three tasks. We conduct a comprehensive comparison of several common LLMs, and evaluate their CFs, assessing both intrinsic metrics, and the impact of these CFs on data augmentation. Moreover, we analyze differences between human and LLM-generated CFs, providing insights for future research directions. Our results show that LLMs generate fluent CFs, but struggle to keep the induced changes minimal. Generating CFs for Sentiment Analysis (SA) is less challenging than NLI and Hate Speech (HS) where LLMs show weaknesses in generating CFs that flip the original label.... | Van Bach Nguyen, Paul Youssef, Christin Seifert, Jörg Schlötterer |  |

Unfortunately, LLM proprietors often limit access to models’ internal weights, confining users to inference API services. This restriction poses a significant challenge for prompt optimization, as conventional optimization-based algorithms rely heavily on gradient information, which is unavailable via inference APIs. Addressing this challenge, this paper presents the Zeroth-Order Tuning (ZOT) approach, which enables efficient prompt tuning solely via inference APIs. ZOT adopts the zeroth-order optimization framework, utilizing finite differences to approximate gradient information. We further incorporate ZOT with gradient clipping and momentum techniques to enhance the tuning effectiveness. Experimental results show that ZOT outperforms existing black-box prompt tuning methods in terms of both task-specific performance and convergence speed. Furthermore, we provide a... | Heshen Zhan, Congliang Chen, Tian Ding, Ziniu Li, Ruoyu Sun |  |

However, their performance in narrative reasoning, which demands greater abstraction capabilities, remains unexplored. This study utilizes tropes in movie synopses to assess the abstract reasoning abilities of state-of-the-art LLMs and uncovers their low performance. We introduce a trope-wise querying approach to address these challenges and boost the F1 score by 11.8 points. Moreover, while prior studies suggest that CoT enhances multi-step reasoning, this study shows CoT can cause hallucinations in narrative content, reducing GPT-4’s performance. We also introduce an Adversarial Injection method to embed trope-related text tokens into movie synopses without explicit tropes, revealing CoT’s heightened sensitivity to such injections. Our comprehensive analysis provides insights for future... | HungTing Su, YaChing Hsu, Xudong Lin, Xiang Qian Shi, Yulei Niu, HanYuan Hsu, Hungyi Lee, Winston H. Hsu |  |

Studies have shown that synthetic data can effectively improve the performance of LLMs on downstream benchmarks. However, despite its potential benefits, our analysis suggests that there may be inherent flaws in synthetic data. The uniform format of synthetic data can lead to pattern overfitting and cause significant shifts in the output distribution, thereby reducing the model’s instruction-following capabilities. Our work delves into these specific flaws associated with question-answer (Q-A) pairs, a prevalent type of synthetic data, and presents a method based on unlearning techniques to mitigate these flaws. The empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which can reverse the instruction-following issues caused by pattern overfitting without compromising performance on benchmarks at relatively low cost.

While most studies on OOD detection focus on fine-tuned models trained on in-distribution (ID) data, detecting OOD in pre-trained models is also important due to computational limitations and the widespread use of open-source pre-trained models. However, in the same domain shift setting, the OOD detection performance of pre-trained models is insufficient because both ID and OOD samples originate from the same domain, leading to a high overlap in their embeddings. To address this issue, we introduce a new method called CED, a training-free OOD detection technique designed to enhance the distinction between ID and OOD datasets. We theoretically validate that specific auxiliary and oracle samples that satisfy certain conditions improve this distinction. Motivated by our theoretical analysis, CED enhances the differentiation by utilizing these specially... | Hakyung Lee, KeonHee Park, Hoyoon Byun, Jeyoon Yeom, Jihee Kim, GyeongMoon Park, Kyungwoo Song |  |

This is particularly true for Chinese, a language with extensive lexical-morphemic ambiguity. Despite the wide use of large language models (LLMs) in numerous domains and their growing proficiency in Chinese, there is a notable lack of datasets to thoroughly evaluate LLMs’ ability to handle ambiguity in Chinese. To bridge this gap, we introduce the CHAmbi dataset, a specialized Chinese multi-label disambiguation dataset formatted in Natural Language Inference. It comprises 4,991 pairs of premises and hypotheses, including 824 examples featuring a wide range of ambiguities. In addition to the dataset, we develop a series of tests and conduct an extensive evaluation of pre-trained LLMs’ proficiency in identifying and resolving ambiguity in the Chinese language.

However, the mechanisms by which LLMs use different parts of the input context remain largely unexplored. In this work, we provide a comprehensive analysis of context utilization in MT, studying how LLMs use various context parts, such as few-shot examples and the source text, when generating translations. We highlight several key findings: (1) the source part of few-shot examples appears to contribute more than its corresponding targets, irrespective of translation direction; (2) finetuning LLMs with parallel data alters the contribution patterns of different context parts; and (3) there is a positional bias where earlier few-shot examples have higher contributions to the translated sequence. Finally, we demonstrate that inspecting anomalous context contributions can potentially uncover pathological... | Emmanouil Zaranis, Nuno Miguel Guerreiro, André F. T. Martins |  |

Its evaluation should quantify how easy it is to understand a text. Datasets with simplicity labels on text level are a prerequisite for developing such evaluation approaches. However, current publicly available datasets do not align with this, as they mainly treat text simplification as a relational concept (“How much simpler has this text gotten compared to the original version?”) or assign discrete readability levels.This work alleviates the problem of Assessing Readability & Text Simplicity. We present ARTS, a method for language-independent construction of datasets for simplicity assessment. We propose using pairwise comparisons of texts in conjunction with an Elo algorithm to produce a simplicity ranking and simplicity scores.

Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BLEU show a weak correlation with human judgment. More sophisticated metrics using Natural Language Inference (NLI) have shown improved correlations but are complex to implement, require domain-specific training due to poor cross-domain generalization, and lack explainability. More recently, prompt-based metrics using LLMs as evaluators have emerged; while they are easier to implement, they still lack explainability and depend on task-specific prompts, which limits their generalizability. This work introduces Automated eXplainable Consistency Evaluation using LLMs (AXCEL), a prompt-based consistency metric which offers explanations for the consistency scores by providing detailed reasoning and pinpointing inconsistent text spans. AXCEL is also a generalizable metric which... | P. Aditya Sreekar, Sahil Verma, Suransh Chopra, Abhishek Persad, Sarik Ghazarian, Narayanan Sadagopan |  |

LLM agents based on few-shot in-context learning (ICL) achieve surprisingly high performance without training. Despite their simplicity and generalizability, ICL-based agents are limited in their ability to incorporate feedback from an environment. In this paper, we introduce Prospector, an LLM agent that consists of two complementary LLMs, an Actor and a Critic. To elicit better instruction-aligned actions from the LLM agent, we propose AskAct prompting that performs an additional self-asking step such as goal and progress checking before generating an action. Furthermore, to implicitly incorporate the environment feedback, we propose Trajectory Ranking that orders generated trajectories by predicting the expected total reward. Prospector encourages the LLM Actor to generate diverse (creative) trajectories, and harnesses the LLM Critic to select the... | Byoungjip Kim, Youngsoo Jang, Lajanugen Logeswaran, GeonHyeong Kim, Yu Jin Kim, Honglak Lee, Moontae Lee |  |

However, the number of pretrained models available to choose from can be very large, and it remains unclear how to select the optimal model without spending considerable amounts of computational resources, especially for the text domain. To address this problem, we introduce PsyMatrix, a novel framework designed to efficiently characterize text datasets. PsyMatrix evaluates multiple dimensions of text and discourse, producing interpretable, low-dimensional embeddings. Our framework has been tested using a meta-dataset repository that includes the performance of 24 pretrained large language models fine-tuned across 146 classification datasets. Using the proposed embeddings, we successfully developed a meta-learning system capable of recommending the most effective pretrained models (optimal and near-optimal) for fine-tuning on new datasets. | Marcio Monteiro, Charu Karakkaparambil James, Marius Kloft, Sophie Fellenz |  |

Yet, their intricate semantic nuances pose a longstanding challenge. Understanding verb relations through the concept of lexical entailment is crucial for comprehending sentence meanings and grasping verb dynamics. This work investigates the capabilities of eight Large Language Models in recognizing lexical entailment relations among verbs through differently devised prompting strategies and zero-/few-shot settings over verb pairs from two lexical databases, namely WordNet and HyperLex. Our findings unveil that the models can tackle the lexical entailment recognition task with moderately good performance, although at varying degree of effectiveness and under different conditions. Also, utilizing few-shot prompting can enhance the models’ performance. However, perfectly solving the task arises as an unmet challenge for all examined LLMs, which raises an emergence for further research developments on... | Candida Maria Greco, Lucio La Cava, Andrea Tagarelli |  |

However, it is unclear to what degree the model’s final answer is faithful to the stated reasoning steps. In this paper, we perform a causal mediation analysis on twelve LLMs to examine how intermediate reasoning steps generated by the LLM influence the final outcome and find that LLMs do not reliably use their intermediate reasoning steps when generating an answer. To address this issue, we introduce FRODO, a framework to tailor small-sized LMs to generate correct reasoning steps and robustly reason over these steps. FRODO consists of an inference module that learns to generate correct reasoning steps using an implicit causal reward function and a reasoning module that learns to faithfully reason over these intermediate inferences using a counterfactual and causal preference objective. Our experiments show that FRODO significantly outperforms four competitive... | Debjit Paul, Robert West, Antoine Bosselut, Boi Faltings |  |

This paper explores a self-training paradigm, where the LLM autonomously curates its own labels and selectively trains on unknown data samples identified through a reference-free consistency method. Empirical evaluations demonstrate significant improvements in reducing hallucination in generation across multiple subjects. Furthermore, the selective training framework mitigates catastrophic forgetting in out-of-distribution benchmarks, addressing a critical limitation in training LLMs. Our findings suggest that such an approach can substantially reduce the dependency on large labeled datasets, paving the way for more scalable and cost-effective language model training. | Wei Jie Yeo, Teddy Ferdinan, Przemyslaw Kazienko, Ranjan Satapathy, Erik Cambria |  |

Compared with traditional pre-training approaches, VE-KD exhibits competitive performance in downstream tasks while reducing model size and using fewer computational resources. Additionally, VE-KD refrains from overfitting in domain adaptation. Our experiments with different biomedical domain tasks demonstrate that VE-KD performs well compared with models such as BioBERT (+1% at HoC) and PubMedBERT (+1% at PubMedQA), with about 96% less training time. Furthermore, it outperforms DistilBERT and Adapt-and-Distill, showing a significant improvement in document-level tasks. Investigation of vocabulary size and tolerance, which are hyperparameters of our method, provides insights for further model optimization. The fact that VE-KD consistently maintains its advantages, even when the corpus size is small, suggests that it is a... | Pengju Gao, Tomohiro Yamasaki, Kazunori Imoto |  |

Numerous decoding strategies—such as beam search, sampling with temperature, top‐k sampling, nucleus (top‐p) sampling, typical decoding, contrastive decoding, and contrastive search—have been proposed to address these challenges by improving coherence, diversity, and resemblance to human-generated text. In this study, we introduce Adaptive Contrastive Search (ACS), a novel decoding strategy that extends contrastive search (CS) by incorporating an adaptive degeneration penalty informed by the model’s estimated uncertainty at each generation step. ACS aims to enhance creativity and diversity while maintaining coherence to produce high-quality outputs. Extensive experiments across various model architectures, languages, and datasets demonstrate that our approach improves both creativity and coherence, underscoring its effectiveness in text-generation tasks.

We investigate their effectiveness for NLP tasks in low-resource languages (LRLs), especially in the setting of zero-labelled cross-lingual transfer (0-CLT), where no labelled training data for the target language is available – however training data from one or more related medium-resource languages (MRLs) is utilized, alongside the available unlabeled test data for a target language. We introduce Self-Supervised Prompting (SSP), a novel ICL approach tailored for the 0-CLT setting. SSP is based on the key observation that LLMs output more accurate labels if in-context exemplars are from the target language (even if their labels are slightly noisy). To operationalize this, since target language training data is not available in 0-CLT, SSP operates in two stages. In Stage I, using... | Vipul Kumar Rathore, Aniruddha Deb, Ankish Kumar Chandresh, Parag Singla, Mausam |  |

We revisit two important stages in the moderation pipeline for GBV: (1) manual data labelling; and (2) automated classification. For (1), we examine two datasets to investigate the relationship between annotator identities and attitudes and the responses they give to two GBV labelling tasks. To this end, we collect demographic and attitudinal information from crowd-sourced annotators using three validated surveys from Social Psychology. We find that higher Right Wing Authoritarianism scores are associated with a higher propensity to label text as sexist, while for Social Dominance Orientation and Neosexist Attitudes, higher scores are associated with a negative tendency to do so.For (2), we conduct classification experiments using Large Language Models and five prompting strategies,... | Aiqi Jiang, Nikolas Vitsakis, Tanvi Dinkar, Gavin Abercrombie, Ioannis Konstas |  |

Commercial AI systems commonly define the role of the LLM in system prompts. For example, ChatGPT uses ”You are a helpful assistant” as part of its default system prompt. Despite current practices of adding personas to system prompts, it remains unclear how different personas affect a model’s performance on objective tasks. In this study, we present a systematic evaluation of personas in system prompts. We curate a list of 162 roles covering 6 types of interpersonal relationships and 8 domains of expertise. Through extensive analysis of 4 popular families of LLMs and 2,410 factual questions, we demonstrate that adding personas in system prompts does not improve model performance across a range of questions compared to the control setting where no persona is added. Nevertheless, further analysis suggests that the gender, type, and domain of the persona can all influence the resulting prediction... | Mingqian Zheng, Jiaxin Pei, Lajanugen Logeswaran, Moontae Lee, David Jurgens |  |

While the Q-Former has been widely used as a general encoder for aligning several modalities including image, video, audio, and 3D with large language models, previous works on its efficient training and the analysis of its individual components have been limited. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) the Q-Former using InstructBLIP with visual reasoning benchmarks ScienceQA and IconQA. We observe that applying PEFT to the Q-Former achieves comparable performance to full fine-tuning using under 2% of the trainable parameters. Additionally, we employ AdaLoRA for dynamic parameter budget reallocation to examine the relative importance of the Q-Former’s sublayers with 4 different benchmarks. Our findings reveal that the self-attention layers are noticeably more... | Sungkyung Kim, Adam Lee, Junyoung Park, Andrew Chung, Jusang Oh, JayYoon Lee |  |

These potential biases raise concern for discriminatory outcomes with AI systems depending on demographic- particularly gender discrimination against women, and racial discrimination against minorities with ethnic or cultural English dialects.As such we aim to evaluate the performance of ASR systems across different genders and across dialects of English. Concretely, we take a deep dive of the performance of ASR systems on men and women across four US-based English dialects: Standard American English (SAE), African American Vernacular English (AAVE), Chicano English, and Spanglish. To do this, we construct a labeled dataset of 13 hours of podcast audio, transcribed by speakers of the represented dialects. We then evaluate zero-shot performance of different automatic speech recognition models on our... | Camille Harris, Chijioke Mgbahurike, Neha Kumar, Diyi Yang |  |

Nonetheless, some argue that LLMs are too inconsistent to simulate particular values. Are they? To answer, we first define value consistency as the similarity of answers across 1) paraphrases of one question, 2) related questions under one topic, 3) multiple-choice and open-ended use-cases of one question, and 4) multilingual translations of a question to English, Chinese, German, and Japanese. We apply these measures to a few large, open LLMs including llama-3, as well as gpt-4o, using eight thousand questions spanning more than 300 topics. Unlike prior work, we find that models are relatively consistent across paraphrases, use-cases, translations, and within a topic. Still, some inconsistencies remain. Models are more consistent on uncontroversial topics (e.g., in the U.S., “Thanksgiving”) than on controversial ones (e.g. “euthanasia”). Base models are both more consistent compared to fine-tuned... | Jared Moore, Tanvi Deshpande, Diyi Yang |  |

Understanding these errors can potentially help improve the translation quality and user experience. This paper introduces xTower, an open large language model (LLM) built on top of TowerBase designed to provide free-text explanations for translation errors in order to guide the generation of a corrected translation. The quality of the generated explanations by xTower are assessed via both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation. We ask expert translators to evaluate the quality of the explanations across two dimensions: relatedness towards the error span being explained and helpfulness in error understanding and improving translation quality. Extrinsically, we test xTower across various experimental setups in generating translation corrections, demonstrating significant improvements in translation quality. Our findings highlight... | Marcos V. Treviso, Nuno Miguel Guerreiro, Sweta Agrawal, Ricardo Rei, José Pombal, Tânia Vaz, Helena Wu, Beatriz Silva, Daan van Stigt, André F. T. Martins |  |

However, current MMT methods face two primary challenges. The first is their underperformance compared to MT methods based on pre-trained models. The second is the inadequate exploitation and integration of the image modality within the model, primarily due to a lack of triplet training data. A mainstream approach is to introduce large amounts of parallel and monolingual data to train the text model and the visual model separately. However, incorporating extensive external data can result in data imbalance, which may introduce biases during training. Additionally, the collection and cleaning of such large datasets is labor-intensive. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel, low-cost, large language model-based data augmentation method called LAMBDA, which can enrich the original samples and... | Yusong Wang, Dongyuan Li, Jialun Shen, Yicheng Xu, Mingkun Xu, Kotaro Funakoshi, Manabu Okumura |  |

Poorly anonymized sensitive data cannot be easily shared with annotators or external researchers, nor can it be used to train public models. In this work, we explore the feasibility of using synthetic data generated from differentially private language models in place of real data to facilitate the development of NLP in these domains without compromising privacy. In contrast to prior work, we generate synthetic data for real high-stakes domains, and we propose and conduct use-inspired evaluations to assess data quality. Our results show that prior simplistic evaluations have failed to highlight utility, privacy, and fairness issues in the synthetic data. Overall, our work underscores the need for further improvements to synthetic data generation for it to be a viable way to enable privacy-preserving data sharing. | Krithika Ramesh, Nupoor Gandhi, Pulkit Madaan, Lisa Bauer, Charith Peris, Anjalie Field |  |

To address this problem, we propose a novel two-phase processing approach called Dual-Process Masking. This approach streamlines the task by masking less important tokens in the input, identified through retrospective analysis of their estimated contribution during training. It enhances interpretability by using the masks applied during classification learning. Dual-Process Masking significantly improves performance over strong baselines for dialogue act recognition on a collaborative problem-solving dataset and three public dialogue benchmarks. | Yeo Jin Kim, Halim Acosta, Wookhee Min, Jonathan P.

Just-in-time processing of a context is inefficient due to the quadratic cost of self-attention operations, and caching is desirable. However, caching transformer states can easily require almost as much space as the model parameters. When the right context is not known in advance, caching the prompt can be challenging. This work addresses these limitations by introducing models that, inspired by the encoder-decoder architecture, use cross-attention to condition generation on reference text without the prompt. More precisely, we leverage pre-trained decoder-only models and only train a small number of added layers. We use Question-Answering (QA) as a testbed to evaluate the ability of our models to perform conditional generation and observe that they outperform prompt-based inference methods, are comparable to fine-tuned prompted LLMs, and drastically reduce the space footprint... | João Monteiro, Étienne Marcotte, PierreAndré Noël, Valentina Zantedeschi, David Vázquez, Nicolas Chapados, Christopher Pal, Perouz Taslakian |  |

These parameterized facts enable realistic image generation, but they may become obsolete over time, thereby misrepresenting the current state of the world. Knowledge editing techniques aim to update model knowledge in a targeted way. However, facing the dual challenges posed by inadequate editing datasets and unreliable evaluation criterion, the development of T2I knowledge editing encounter difficulties in effectively generalizing injected knowledge. In this work, we design a T2I knowledge editing framework by comprehensively spanning on three phases: First, we curate a dataset CAKE, comprising paraphrase and multi-object test, to enable more fine-grained assessment on knowledge generalization. Second, we propose a novel criterion, adaptive CLIP threshold, to effectively filter out false successful images under the current criterion and achieve reliable editing evaluation.... | Hengrui Gu, Kaixiong Zhou, Yili Wang, Ruobing Wang, Xin Wang |  |

Recently, there has been considerable interest in increasing the context lengths for these models to enhance their applicability to complex tasks. However, at long context lengths and large batch sizes, the key-value (KV) cache, which stores the attention keys and values, emerges as the new bottleneck in memory usage during inference. To address this, we propose Eigen Attention, which performs the attention operation in a low-rank space, thereby reducing the KV cache memory overhead. Our proposed approach is orthogonal to existing KV cache compression techniques and can be used synergistically with them. Through extensive experiments over OPT, MPT, and Llama model families, we demonstrate that Eigen Attention results in up to 40% reduction in KV cache sizes and up to 60% reduction in attention operation latency with minimal drop... | Utkarsh Saxena, Gobinda Saha, Sakshi Choudhary, Kaushik Roy |  |

Traditionally, each prompt has been considered indivisible and updated independently, leading the parameters increase proportionally as prompt length grows. To address this issue, we propose Adaptive Codebook for Composite and Efficient Prompt Tuning (ACCEPT). In our method, we refer to the concept of product quantization (PQ), allowing all soft prompts to share a set of learnable codebook vectors in each subspace, with each prompt differentiated by a set of adaptive weights. We achieve the superior performance on 17 diverse natural language tasks including natural language understanding (NLU) and question answering (QA) tasks by tuning only 0.3% of parameters of the PLMs. Our approach also excels in few-shot and large model settings, highlighting its significant potential. | YuChen Lin, WeiHua Li, JunCheng Chen, ChuSong Chen |  |

As a result of this momentum towards local deployment, compressed LLMs will interact with a large population. Prior work on compression typically prioritize preserving perplexity, which is directly analogous to training loss. The impact of compression method on other critical aspects of model behavior—particularly safety—requires systematic assessment. To this end, we investigate the impact of model compression along four dimensions: (1) degeneration harm, i.e., bias and toxicity in generation; (2) representational harm, i.e., biases in discriminative tasks; (3) dialect bias; and (4) language modeling and downstream task performance. We examine a wide spectrum of LLM compression techniques, including unstructured pruning, semi-structured pruning, and quantization. Our analysis reveals that compression can lead to unexpected consequences. Although compression may... | Zhichao Xu, Ashim Gupta, Tao Li, Oliver Bentham, Vivek Srikumar |  |

Despite its popularity, there are three problems: (1) it relies on providing test cases to generate the right signature, (2) there is poor alignment between instruction and evaluation test cases, and (3) contamination of the exact phrasing being present in training datasets. We adapt MBPP to emphasize on generating code from just natural language by (1) removing ambiguity about the semantics of the task from the descriptions, and (2) evaluating generated code on multiple sets of assertions to account for ambiguity in the syntax. We compare popular open and closed weight models on the original (MBPP) and adapted (MBUPP) datasets. | Mansi Uniyal, Mukul Singh, Gust Verbruggen, Sumit Gulwani, Vu Le |  |

In this paper, we unify these two algorithms under a single conceptual umbrella, optimizing for the same goal, which we call the preservation-memorization objective. ROME uses an equality constraint to optimize this objective to perform one edit at a time, whereas MEMIT employs a more flexible least-square constraint that allows for batched edits. We generalize ROME and enable batched editing with equality constraint in the form of EMMET - an Equality-constrained Mass Model Editing algorithm for Transformers, a new batched memory-editing algorithm. EMMET can perform batched-edits up to a batch-size of 10,000, with very similar performance to MEMIT across multiple dimensions. With the introduction of EMMET, we truly unify ROME and MEMIT and show that both algorithms are equivalent in terms of their optimization objective,... | Akshat Gupta, Dev Sajnani, Gopala Anumanchipalli |  |

Such benchmarks often do not adequately represent the complexity of research workflows, which typically also involve interpreting non-textual data, such as figures and tables, and gathering information across multiple documents and related literature. To address this gap, we introduce M3SciQA, a multi-modal, multi-document scientific question answering benchmark designed for a more comprehensive evaluation of foundation models. M3Sci QA consists of 1452 expert-annotated questions spanning 70 natural language processing paper clusters, where each cluster represents a primary paper along with all its cited documents, mirroring the workflow of comprehending a single paper by requiring multi-modal and multi-document data.

In many proposed applications, it is expected that the agent reasons over accumulated experience presented in an input prompt. We propose the OEDD (Operationalize Experience Despite Distraction) corpus, a human-annotator-validated body of scenarios with pre-scripted agent histories where the agent must make a decision based on disparate experiential information in the presence of a distractor. We evaluate three state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4o, and Gemini 1.5 Pro) using a minimal chain-of-thought prompting strategy and observe that when (1) the input context contains over 1,615 tokens of historical interactions, (2) a crucially decision-informing premise is the rightful conclusion over two disparate environment premises, and (3) a trivial, but distracting red herring fact follows, all LLMs perform worse than random choice at selecting the better of two actions.

Prior work on document generation has generally tackled the creation of each separate format to be a different task, leading to fragmented learning processes, redundancy in models and methods, and disjointed evaluation. We consider each of these documents as templatic views of the same underlying knowledge/content, and we aim to unify the generation and evaluation of these templatic views. We begin by showing that current LLMs are capable of generating various document formats with little to no supervision. Further, a simple augmentation involving a structured intermediate representation can improve performance, especially for smaller models. We then introduce a novel unified evaluation framework that can be adapted to measuring the quality of document generators for heterogeneous downstream applications.

However, LLMs often struggle with complex programming problems without human guidance. This paper investigates the strategies employed by expert programmers to steer code-generating LLMs toward successful outcomes. Through a study involving experts using natural language to guide GPT-4, Gemini Ultra, and, Claude 3.5 Sonnet on highly difficult programming challenges, we frame our analysis using the “Socratic Feedback” paradigm for understanding effective steering strategies. By analyzing 30 conversational transcripts across all three models, we map observed feedback strategies to five stages of Socratic Questioning: Definition, Elenhus, Maieutic, Dialectic, and Counter-factual reasoning. We find evidence that by employing a combination of different Socratic feedback strategies across multiple turns, programmers successfully guided the models... | Subramanian Chidambaram, Li Erran Li, Min Bai, Xiaopeng Li, Kaixiang Lin, Xiong Zhou, Alex C.

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have motivated their use in improving the turn-taking capabilities of Spoken Dialogue Systems (SDS), such as their ability to respond at appropriate times. However, existing models often struggle to predict opportunities for speaking — called Transition Relevance Places (TRPs) — in natural, unscripted conversations, focusing only on turn-final TRPs and not within-turn TRPs. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel dataset of participant-labeled within-turn TRPs and use it to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs in predicting opportunities for speaking. Our experiments reveal the current limitations of LLMs in modeling unscripted spoken interactions, highlighting areas for improvement and paving the way for more naturalistic dialogue systems. | Muhammad Umair, Vasanth Sarathy, Jan Peter de Ruiter |  |

Furthermore, the measurement of the overall fluency of an essay is often overlooked. To address these issues, we present CEFA (Chinese Essay Fluency Assessment), an extensive corpus that is derived from essays authored by native Chinese-speaking primary and secondary students and encapsulates essay fluency scores along with both coarse and fine-grained grammatical error types and corrections.

By fine-tuning pre-trained language models, we create energy-relevant measures for each hearing. Our market analysis shows that natural language analysis using CoCoHD can predict and highlight trends in the energy sector. | Arnav Hiray, Yunsong Liu, Mingxiao Song, Agam Shah, Sudheer Chava |  |

To better understand and adapt to individual student needs, including their misconceptions, LLMs need to be trained on extensive datasets of student-tutor dialogues. Our research uncovers a fundamental challenge in this approach: the “Student Data Paradox”. This paradox emerges when LLMs, trained on student data to understand learner behavior, inadvertently compromise their own factual knowledge and reasoning abilities. We investigate this paradox by training state-of-the-art language models on student-tutor dialogue datasets and evaluating their performance across multiple benchmarks. These benchmarks assess various aspects of language model capabilities, including reasoning, truthfulness, and common sense understanding. Our findings reveal significant declines in the models’ performance across these diverse benchmarks, indicating a broad impact... | Shashank Sonkar, Naiming Liu, Richard G. Baraniuk |  |

The dataset comprises mathematics and reading comprehension questions, each accompanied by four answer choices and their corresponding rationales. At the heart of MalAlgoQA are “malgorithms” - rationales behind incorrect answer choices that represent flawed yet logically coherent reasoning paths. These malgorithms serve as counterfactual scenarios, allowing us to assess an LLM’s ability to identify and analyze flawed reasoning patterns. We propose the Malgorithm Identification task, where LLMs are assessed based on their ability to identify corresponding malgorithm given an incorrect answer choice. To evaluate the model performance, we introduce two metrics: Algorithm Identification Accuracy (AIA) for correct answer rationale identification, and Malgorithm Identification Accuracy (MIA) for incorrect answer... | Shashank Sonkar, Naiming Liu, Myco Le, Richard G.

Poetry Evaluation for Large Models and Datasets](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.findings-emnlp.914) |  | 0 | Large language models (LLMs) can now generate and recognize poetry. But what do LLMs really know about poetry? We develop a task to evaluate how well LLMs recognize one aspect of English-language poetry—poetic form—which captures many different poetic features, including rhyme scheme, meter, and word or line repetition. By using a benchmark dataset of over 4.1k human expert-annotated poems, we show that state-of-the-art LLMs can successfully identify both common and uncommon fixed poetic forms—such as sonnets, sestinas, and pantoums—with surprisingly high accuracy. However, performance varies significantly by poetic form; the models struggle to identify unfixed poetic forms, especially those based on topic or visual features. We additionally measure how many poems from our benchmark dataset are present in popular pretraining datasets or memorized by GPT-4, finding that pretraining presence and memorization may improve performance on this task, but results are inconclusive. We release... | Melanie Walsh, Maria Antoniak, Anna Preus |  |

In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of adding new skills to preexisting models by training on the new skills in isolation and later merging with the general model (e.g. using task vectors). In experiments focusing on scientific literature understanding, safety, and coding, we find that the parallel-train-then-merge procedure, which is significantly cheaper than retraining the models on updated data mixtures, is often comparably effective. Our experiments also show that parallel training is especially well-suited for enabling safety features in LMs relative to continued finetuning and retraining, as it dramatically improves model compliance with safe prompts while preserving its ability to refuse dangerous or harmful prompts. | Jacob Morrison, Noah A.

Depending on their proficiency level and audience, they may pose these questions in an L1 (first language) or an L2 (second language). We investigate how multilingual LLMs perform at crosslingual metalinguistic question answering. Focusing on binary questions about sentence grammaticality constructed from error-annotated learner corpora, we prompt three LLMs (Aya, Llama, and GPT) in multiple languages, including English, German, Korean, Russian, and Ukrainian. Our study reveals that the language of the prompt can significantly affect model performance, and despite English being the dominant training language for all three models, prompting in a different language with questions about English often yields better results. | Shabnam Behzad, Amir Zeldes, Nathan Schneider |  |

However, the effectiveness of traditional topic models often relies on sufficient word co-occurrence, which is lacking in short texts. Therefore, existing approaches, whether probabilistic or neural, frequently struggle to extract meaningful patterns from such data, resulting in incoherent topics. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to extend short texts into more detailed sequences before applying topic modeling. To further improve the efficiency and solve the problem of semantic inconsistency from LLM-generated texts, we propose to use prefix tuning to train a smaller language model coupled with a variational autoencoder for short-text topic modeling. Our method significantly improves short-text topic modeling performance, as demonstrated by extensive experiments on real-world datasets with extreme data sparsity,... | Pritom Saha Akash, Kevin ChenChuan Chang |  |

By contrast, targeted multinguality has been shown to benefit low-resource languages. To test this approach more rigorously, we systematically study best practices for adapting a pre-trained model to a language family. Focusing on the Uralic family as a test case, we adapt XLM-R under various configurations to model 15 languages; we then evaluate the performance of each experimental setting on two downstream tasks and 11 evaluation languages. Our adapted models significantly outperform mono- and multilingual baselines. A regression analysis reveals that adapted vocabulary size is relatively unimportant for low-resource languages, and that low-resource languages can be aggressively up-sampled during training at little detriment to performance in high-resource languages. These results introduce new best practices for performing language... | C. M. Downey, Terra Blevins, Dhwani Serai, Dwija Parikh, Shane SteinertThrelkeld |  |

Existing research primarily addresses simple queries with a single intent, lacking effective systems for handling complex queries with multiple intents and extracting different intent spans. Additionally, there is a notable absence of multilingual, multi-intent datasets. This study addresses three critical tasks: extracting multiple intent spans from queries, detecting multiple intents, and developing a multilingual multi-label intent dataset. We introduce a novel multi-label multi-class intent detection dataset (MLMCID-dataset) curated from existing benchmark datasets. We also propose a pointer network-based architecture (MLMCID) to extract intent spans and detect multiple intents with coarse and fine-grained labels in the form of sextuplets. Comprehensive analysis demonstrates the superiority of our pointer network based system over baseline approaches in... | Ankan Mullick, Sombit Bose, Abhilash Nandy, Gajula Chaitanya, Pawan Goyal |  |

A few of them have been trained on low-resource languages (LRLs) and give decent performance. Owing to the prohibitive costs of training LLMs, they are usually used as a network service, with the client charged by the count of input and output tokens. The number of tokens strongly depends on the script and language, as well as the LLM’s subword vocabulary. We show that LRLs are at a pricing disadvantage, because the well-known LLMs produce more tokens for LRLs than HRLs. This is because most currently popular LLMs are optimized for HRL vocabularies. Our objective is to level the playing field: reduce the cost of processing LRLs in contemporary LLMs while ensuring that predictive and generative qualities are not compromised. As means to reduce the number of tokens processed by the LLM, we consider code-mixing, translation, and transliteration of LRLs to... | Arijit Nag, Animesh Mukherjee, Niloy Ganguly, Soumen Chakrabarti |  |

However, the sheer size of these pretrained models makes full-model finetuning exceedingly costly. One common solution is the “adapter”, which finetunes a few additional parameters while freezing the backbone. It harnesses the heavy-duty backbone while offering a light finetuning for small downstream tasks. This synergy prompts us to explore the potential of augmenting large-scale backbones with traditional machine learning techniques. Often employed in traditional fields and overlooked in the large-scale era, these techniques could provide valuable enhancements. Herein, we delve into the “adapter ensembles” in the realm of large-scale pretrained vision-language models. We begin with a proof-of-concept study to establish the efficacy of combining multiple adapters. We then present extensive evidence showing these ensembles excel in a variety of settings, particularly when employing a... | Yue Bai, Handong Zhao, Zhe Lin, Ajinkya Kale, Jiuxiang Gu, Tong Yu, Sungchul Kim, Yun Fu |  |

We consider an innovative approach that merges pre-trained neural representations of writing style with author-conditional encoder-decoder diarization, enhanced by a Conditional Random Field with Viterbi decoding for alignment refinement. Additionally, we introduce two new large-scale German language datasets, one for authorship verification and the other for author diarization. We evaluate the performance of our diarization framework on these datasets, offering insights into the strengths and limitations of this approach. | Benedikt T.

The explicit and precise control of granular structural attributes, such as node centrality and graph density, is crucial for effective graph generation. This paper introduces a controllable multi-objective translation model for text-attributed graphs, titled Controlled Graph Translator (CGT). It is designed to effectively and efficiently translate a given source graph to a target graph, while satisfying multiple desired graph attributes at granular level. Designed with an encoder-decoder architecture, CGT develops fusion and graph attribute predictor neural networks for controlled graph translation. We validate the effectiveness of CGT through extensive experiments on different genres of datasets. In addition, we illustrate the application of CGT in data augmentation and taxonomy creation, particularly in low resource settings. | Nidhi Vakil, Hadi Amiri |  |

The rapid online information exchange necessitates advanced detection mechanisms to mitigate misinformation-induced harm. Existing research, however, has predominantly focused on the veracity of information, overlooking the legal implications and consequences of misinformation. In this work, we take a novel angle to consolidate the definition of misinformation detection using legal issues as a measurement of societal ramifications, aiming to bring interdisciplinary efforts to tackle misinformation and its consequence. We introduce a new task: Misinformation with Legal Consequence (MisLC), which leverages definitions from a wide range of legal domains covering 4 broader legal topics and 11 fine-grained legal issues, including hate speech, election laws, and privacy regulations. For this task, we advocate a two-step dataset... | Chu Fei Luo, Radin Shayanfar, Rohan Bhambhoria, Samuel Dahan, Xiaodan Zhu |  |

This study explores the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipelines to analyze text data from online mental health forums used for consultations. By analyzing forum posts, these pipelines can flag users who may require immediate professional attention. A crucial challenge in this domain is data privacy and scarcity. To address this, we propose utilizing readily available curricular texts used in institutes specializing in mental health for pre-training the NLP pipelines. This helps us mimic the training process of a psychologist. Our work presents CASE-BERT that flags potential mental health disorders based on forum text. CASE-BERT demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods, achieving an f1 score of 0.91 for Depression and 0.88 for Anxiety, two of the most commonly reported mental health disorders.

In this paper, we propose a pipeline that exploits this bias to do explicit inductive inference. Our pipeline uses an LLM to transform a premise into a set of attested alternatives, and then aggregate answers of the derived new entailment inquiries to support the original inference prediction. On a directional predicate entailment benchmark, we demonstrate that by applying this simple pipeline, we can improve the overall performance of LLMs on inference and substantially alleviate the impact of their attestation bias. | Tianyang Liu, Tianyi Li, Liang Cheng, Mark Steedman |  |

Recent works suggest that Knowledge Graphs (KGs) contain valuable external knowledge for LLMs. Retrieving information from KGs differs from extracting it from document sets. Most existing approaches seek to directly retrieve relevant subgraphs, thereby eliminating the need for extensive SPARQL annotations, traditionally required by semantic parsing methods. In this paper, we model the subgraph retrieval task as a conditional generation task handled by small language models. Specifically, we define a subgraph identifier as a sequence of relations, each represented as a special token stored in the language models. Our base generative subgraph retrieval model, consisting of only 220M parameters, achieves competitive retrieval performance compared to state-of-the-art models relying on 7B parameters, demonstrating that small language models are capable of... | Wenyu Huang, Guancheng Zhou, Hongru Wang, Pavlos Vougiouklis, Mirella Lapata, Jeff Z.

However, these models are still not immune to limitations such as social biases, especially gender bias. This work investigates whether current closed and open-source LLMs possess gender bias, especially when asked to give moral opinions. To evaluate these models, we curate and introduce a new dataset GenMO (Gender-bias in Morality Opinions) comprising parallel short stories featuring male and female characters respectively. Specifically, we test models from the GPT family (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-3.5-turbo-instruct, GPT-4-turbo), Llama 3 and 3.1 families (8B/70B), Mistral-7B and Claude 3 families (Sonnet and Opus). Surprisingly, despite employing safety checks, all production-standard models we tested display significant gender bias with GPT-3.5-turbo giving biased opinions in 24% of the samples. Additionally, all models consistently favour female characters, with GPT... | Divij Bajaj, Yuanyuan Lei, Jonathan Tong, Ruihong Huang |  |

Existing methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), typically involve model adaptation by training the PEFT parameters. One open problem required to be solved to effectively employ these methods is the identification of PEFT parameters. More precisely, related works identify PEFT parameters by projecting high dimensional parameters of LLMs onto low dimensional parameter manifolds with predefined projections, or identifying PEFT parameters as projections themselves. To study this problem, we propose a new approach called Learning to Efficiently Fine-tune (LEFT) where we aim to learn spaces of PEFT parameters from data. In order to learn how to generate the PEFT parameters on a learned parameter space while fine-tuning the LLMs, we propose the Parameter Generation (PG) method. In the experimental analyses, we examine the effectiveness of our... | Taha Ceritli, Savas Özkan, Jeongwon Min, Eunchung Noh, Cho Min, Mete Ozay |  |

For large language models (LLMs) to play a role in longer-form article generation, we must understand the planning steps humans make before writing. We explore one kind of planning, source-selection in news, as a case-study for evaluating plans in long-form generation. We ask: why do _specific_ stories call for _specific_ kinds of sources? We imagine a generative process for story writing where a source-selection schema is first selected by a journalist, and then sources are chosen based on categories in that schema. Learning the article’s _plan_ means predicting the schema initially chosen by the journalist. Working with professional journalists, we adapt five existing schemata and introduce three new ones to describe journalistic plans for the inclusion of sources in documents. Then, inspired by Bayesian latent-variable modeling, we develop metrics to select the most likely plan, or schema, underlying a story, which we use to compare schemata.

We conducted the first real-life A/B test assessing the effectiveness of LLM-generated counter-speech. During the experiment, we posted 753 automatically generated responses aimed at reducing user engagement under tweets that contained hate speech toward Ukrainian refugees in Poland.Our work shows that interventions with LLM-generated responses significantly decrease user engagement, particularly for original tweets with at least ten views, reducing it by over 20%. This paper outlines the design of our automatic moderation system, proposes a simple metric for measuring user engagement and details the methodology of conducting such an experiment. We discuss the ethical considerations and challenges in deploying generative AI for discourse moderation. | Jakub Podolak, Szymon Lukasik, Pawel Balawender, Jan Ossowski, Jan Piotrowski, Katarzyna Bakowicz, Piotr Sankowski |  |

However, cognitive science has long focused on a local perspective, investigating whether translation equivalents truly share the same meaning or the extent that cultural and regional influences result in meaning variations. With recent technological advances and the increasing amounts of available data, the longstanding question of cross-lingual lexical alignment can now be approached in a more data-driven manner. However, developing metrics for the task requires some methodology for comparing metric efficacy. We address this gap and present a methodology for analyzing both synthetic validations and a novel naturalistic validation using lexical gaps in the kinship domain.We further propose new metrics, hitherto unexplored on this task, based on contextualized embeddings. Our analysis spans 16 diverse languages, demonstrating that there is substantial... | Taelin Karidi, Eitan Grossman, Omri Abend |  |

A significant challenge is interpreting complex multi-modal scenes, which include both visual objects and sound sources, and connecting them to the given question. In this paper, we introduce the Source-aware Semantic Representation Network (SaSR-Net), a novel model designed for AVQA. SaSR-Net utilizes source-wise learnable tokens to efficiently capture and align audio-visual elements with the corresponding question. It streamlines the fusion of audio and visual information using spatial and temporal attention mechanisms to identify answers in multi-modal scenes. Extensive experiments on the Music-AVQA and AVQA-Yang datasets show that SaSR-Net outperforms state-of-the-art AVQA methods. We will release our source code and pre-trained models. | Tianyu Yang, Yiyang Nan, Lisen Dai, Zhenwen Liang, Yapeng Tian, Xiangliang Zhang |  |

While natural language enables straightforward ways to represent under-specified, partially observable events, visual data does not facilitate analogous methods and, consequently, introduces unique challenges in event understanding. With the growing prevalence of vision-capable AI agents, these systems must be able to model events from collections of unstructured video data. To tackle robust event modeling in multimodal settings, we introduce a multimodal formulation for partially-defined events and cast the extraction of these events as a three-stage span retrieval task. We propose a corresponding benchmark for this task, MultiVENT-G, that consists of 14.5 hours of densely annotated current event videos and 1,168 text documents, containing 22.8K labeled event-centric entities. We propose a collection of LLM-driven approaches to the task of multimodal event analysis, and evaluate them on... | Kate Sanders, Reno Kriz, David Etter, Hannah Recknor, Alexander Martin, Cameron Carpenter, Jingyang Lin, Benjamin Van Durme |  |

While a wide body of work examines the impact of quantization on LLMs in English, none have evaluated across languages. We conduct a thorough analysis of quantized multilingual LLMs, focusing on performance across languages and at varying scales. We use automatic benchmarks, LLM-as-a-Judge, and human evaluation, finding that (1) harmful effects of quantization are apparent in human evaluation, which automatic metrics severely underestimate: a 1.7% average drop in Japanese across automatic tasks corresponds to a 16.0% drop reported by human evaluators on realistic prompts; (2) languages are disparately affected by quantization, with non-Latin script languages impacted worst; and (3) challenging tasks like mathematical reasoning degrade fastest.

GNN meets LLM for Text Document-to-Presentation Transformation with Attribution](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.findings-emnlp.936) |  | 0 | Automatically generating a presentation from the text of a long document is a challenging and useful problem. In contrast to a flat summary, a presentation needs to have a better and non-linear narrative, i.e., the content of a slide can come from different and non-contiguous parts of the given document. However, it is difficult to incorporate such non-linear mapping of content to slides and ensure that the content is faithful to the document. LLMs are prone to hallucination and their performance degrades with the length of the input document. Towards this, we propose a novel graph based solution where we learn a graph from the input document and use a combination of graph neural network and LLM to generate a presentation with attribution of content for each slide. We conduct thorough experiments to show the merit of our approach compared to directly using LLMs for this task. | Himanshu Maheshwari, Sambaran Bandyopadhyay, Aparna Garimella, Anandhavelu Natarajan |  |

However, PLMs are often optimized on tasks that are inconsistent with AD classification. Spoken language corpora for AD detection are also small and disparate, making generalizability difficult. This paper investigates the use of domain-adaptive prompt fine-tuning for AD detection, using AD classification loss as the training objective and leveraging spoken language corpora from a variety of language tasks. Extensive experiments using voting-based combinations of different prompting paradigms show an impressive mean detection F1=0.8952 (with std=0.01 and best F1=0.9130) for the highest-performing approach when using BERT as the base PLM. | Shahla Farzana, Natalie Parde |  |

However, datasets used in KBQA studies do not capture the true complexity of KBQA tasks. They either have simple questions, use synthetically generated logical forms, or are based on small knowledge base (KB) schemas.We introduce the SPINACH dataset, an expert-annotated KBQA dataset collected from discussions on Wikidata’s “Request a Query” forum with 320 decontextualized question-SPARQL pairs. The complexity of these in-the-wild queries calls for a KBQA system that can dynamically explore large and often incomplete schemas and reason about them, as it is infeasible to create a comprehensive training dataset. We also introduce an in-context learning KBQA agent, also called SPINACH, that mimics how a human expert would write SPARQLs to handle challenging questions.

Central to RLHF is learning a reward function for scoring human preferences. Two main approaches for learning a reward model are 1) training an EXplicit Reward Model (EXRM) as in RLHF, and 2) using an implicit reward learned from preference data through methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Prior work has shown that the implicit reward model of DPO (denoted as DPORM) can approximate an EXRM on the limit infinite samples. However, it is unclear how effective is DPORM in practice. DPORM’s effectiveness directly implies the optimality of learned policy of DPO and also has practical implication for more advanced alignment methods, such as iterative DPO. We compare the accuracy at distinguishing preferred and rejected answers using both DPORM and EXRM. Our findings indicate that even though DPORM can fit the training dataset, it generalizes less... | Yong Lin, Skyler Seto, Maartje ter Hoeve, Katherine Metcalf, BarryJohn Theobald, Xuan Wang, Yizhe Zhang, Chen Huang, Tong Zhang |  |

Recently, rapid advancements in generative AI, particularly through the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), have significantly transformed the landscape of writing assistance. However, underrepresented languages like Arabic encounter significant challenges in the development of advanced AI writing tools, largely due to the limited availability of data. This scarcity constrains the training of effective models, impeding the creation of sophisticated writing assistance technologies. To address these issues, we present \*Gazelle\*, a comprehensive dataset for Arabic writing assistance. In addition, we offer an evaluation framework designed to enhance Arabic writing assistance tools.

Prior works have evaluated models’ knowledge of cultural norms, values, and artefacts, without considering how this knowledge manifests in downstream applications. In this work, we focus on extrinsic evaluation of cultural competence in two text generation tasks, open-ended question answering and story generation. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate model outputs when an explicit cue of culture, specifically nationality, is perturbed in the prompts. Although we find that model outputs do vary when varying nationalities and feature culturally relevant words, we also find weak correlations between text similarity of outputs for different countries and the cultural values of these countries. Finally, we discuss important considerations in designing comprehensive evaluation of cultural competence in user-facing tasks. | Shaily Bhatt, Fernando Diaz |  |

Compared to its predecessor BLASER (Chen et al., 2023), BLASER 2.0 is based on better underlying text and speech representations that cover 202 text languages and 57 speech ones and extends the training data. BLASER 2.0 comes in two varieties: a reference-based and a reference-free (quality estimation) model. We demonstrate that the reference-free version is applicable not only at the dataset level, for evaluating the overall model performance, but also at the sentence level, for scoring individual translations. In particular, we show its applicability for detecting translation hallucinations and filtering training datasets to obtain more reliable translation models. The BLASER 2.0 models are publicly available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/sonar. | David Dale, Marta R. Costajussà |  |

However, current SSC methods are constrained by model size, sequence length, and single-label setting. To address these limitations, this paper proposes LLM-SSC, a large language model (LLM)-based framework for both single- and multi-label SSC tasks. Unlike previous approaches that employ small- or medium-sized language models, the proposed framework utilizes LLMs to generate SSC labels through designed prompts, which enhance task understanding by incorporating demonstrations and a query to describe the prediction target. We also present a multi-label contrastive learning loss with auto-weighting scheme, enabling the multi-label classification task. To support our multi-label SSC analysis, we introduce and release a new dataset, biorc800, which mainly contains unstructured abstracts in the biomedical... | Mengfei Lan, Lecheng Zheng, Shufan Ming, Halil Kilicoglu |  |

Capturing and simulating these diverse traits coherently and efficiently presents a complex challenge. This paper introduces Multi-Trait Adaptive Decoding (mTAD), a method that generates diverse user profiles at decoding-time by sampling from various trait-specific Language Models (LMs). mTAD provides an adaptive and scalable approach to user simulation, enabling the creation of multiple user profiles without the need for additional fine-tuning. By analyzing real-world dialogues from the Conversational Task Assistant (CTA) domain, we identify key conversational traits and developed a framework to generate profile-aware dialogues that enhance conversational diversity. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach in modeling single-traits using specialized LMs, which can capture less common patterns, even in out-of-domain tasks. Furthermore, the results... | Rafael Ferreira, David Semedo, João Magalhães |  |

To ensure fair evaluation, recent benchmarks release only the training and validation sets, keeping the test set labels closed-source. They require anyone wishing to evaluate his language model to submit the model’s predictions for centralized processing and then publish the model’s result on their leaderboard. However, this submission process is inefficient and prevents effective error analysis. To address this issue, we propose to variabilize benchmarks and evaluate language models dynamically. Specifically, we extract variables from each test case and define a value range for each variable. For each evaluation, we sample new values from these value ranges to create unique test cases, thus ensuring a fresh evaluation each time. We applied this... | Kun Qian, Shunji Wan, Claudia Tang, Youzhi Wang, Xuanming Zhang, Maximillian Chen, Zhou Yu |  |

Gloss annotations serve as an intermediary to guide the translation process. In our work, we focus on Gloss2Text translation stage and propose several advances by leveraging pre-trained large language models (LLMs), data augmentation, and novel label-smoothing loss function exploiting gloss translation ambiguities improving significantly the performance of state-of-the-art approaches. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies on the PHOENIX Weather 2014T dataset, our approach surpasses state-of-the-art performance in Gloss2Text translation, indicating its efficacy in addressing sign language translation and suggesting promising avenues for future research and development. | Pooya Fayyazsanavi, Antonios Anastasopoulos, Jana Kosecka |  |

At the core of our proposal is a structured breakdown of the complex task into a number of states in a state machine, so that actions corresponding to various subtasks, e.g., content reading and utterance generation, can be executed in their own dedicated states. Each state leverages a unique set of resources, including prompts and (optionally) additional tools, to augment the generation process. Automatic evaluation shows that SCoT prompting with designated states for hallucination mitigation can increase agent faithfulness to grounding documents by up to 16.8%. When used as training data, our open-domain conversations synthesized from only 6 Wikipedia-based seed demonstrations train strong conversational QA agents. In out-of-domain evaluation, for example, we observe improvements of up to 13.9% in... | Md. Arafat Sultan, Jatin Ganhotra, Ramón Fernandez Astudillo |  |

However, the mechanism by which language models store different types of knowledge is poorly understood. In this work, we examine two types of knowledge relating to temporally sensitive entities and demonstrate that each type is localized to different sets of parameters within the LLMs. We hypothesize that the lack of consideration of the locality of knowledge in existing continual learning methods contributes to both: the failed uptake of new information, and catastrophic forgetting of previously learned information. We observe that sequences containing references to updated and newly mentioned entities exhibit larger gradient norms in a subset of layers. We demonstrate that targeting parameter updates to these relevant layers can improve the performance of continually pretraining on language containing temporal drift. | Jared Fernandez, Yonatan Bisk, Emma Strubell |  |

Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) is based on this fundamental challenge. Current state-of-the-art technologies in ERC are limited due to the need for future information. We introduce High-Dimensional Temporal Fusion Transformer (HiTFT), a time-series forecasting transformer that predicts pseudo-future information to overcome this constraint. This retains the models’ dynamic nature and provides future information more efficiently than other methods. Our proposed method combines pseudo future embeddings with an encoder that models the speaker’s emotional state using past and pseudo-future information as well as inter and intra speaker interactions; these speaker states are then passed through a decoder block that predicts the inferred emotion of that utterance. We further evaluate our method and show that it achieves state of the art... | Tanmay Khule, Rishabh Agrawal, Apurva Narayan |  |

Both approaches are incompatible with textless languages or language pairs with limited parallel data. We present PFB, a framework for training textless S2ST models that require just dozens of hours of parallel speech data. We first pretrain a model on large-scale monolingual speech data, finetune it with a small amount of parallel speech data (20-60 hours), and lastly train with an unsupervised backtranslation objective. We train and evaluate our models for English-to-German, German-to-English and Marathi-to-English translation on three different domains (European Parliament, Common Voice, and All India Radio) with single-speaker synthesized speech. Evaluated using the ASR-BLEU metric, our models achieve reasonable performance on all three domains, with some being within 1-2 points of our higher-resourced... | Anuj Diwan, Anirudh Srinivasan, David Harwath, Eunsol Choi |  |

While Language Models (LMs) with informal communications have been widely discussed, a unique and emphatic style, the Repetitive Lengthening Form (RLF), has been overlooked for years. In this paper, we explore answers to two research questions: 1) Is RLF important for SA? 2) Can LMs understand RLF? Inspired by previous linguistic research, we curate \*\*Lengthening\*\*, the first multi-domain dataset with 850k samples focused on RLF for sentiment analysis. Moreover, we introduce \*\*Explnstruct\*\*, a two-stage Explainable Instruction Tuning framework aimed at improving both the performance and explainability of LLMs for RLF. We further propose a novel unified approach to quantify LMs’ understanding of informal expressions. We show that RLF sentences are expressive expressions and can serve as signatures of document-level sentiment. Additionally, RLF has... | Lei Wang, Eduard C. Dragut |  |

Assessing Temporal Information and Understanding in Large Language Models](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.findings-emnlp.953) |  | 0 | Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly ubiquitous, yet their ability to retain and reason about temporal information remains limited, hindering their application in real-world scenarios where understanding the sequential nature of events is crucial. Our study experiments with 12 state-of-the-art models (ranging from 2B to 70B+ parameters) on a novel numerical-temporal dataset, TempUN, spanning from 10,000 BCE to 2100 CE, to uncover significant temporal retention and comprehension limitations. We propose six metrics to assess three learning paradigms to enhance temporal knowledge acquisition. Our findings reveal that open-source models exhibit knowledge gaps more frequently, suggesting a trade-off between limited knowledge and incorrect responses. Additionally, various fine-tuning approaches significantly improved performance, reducing incorrect outputs and impacting the identification of ‘information not available’ in the generations. The associated dataset and code are... | Himanshu Beniwal, Dishant Patel, Kowsik Nandagopan D, Hritik Ladia, Ankit Yadav, Mayank Singh |  |

In practice, several mid-flight changes are required in the LR schedule either manually, or with careful choices around warmup steps, peak LR, type of decay and restarts. To study this further, we consider the effect of switching the learning rate at a predetermined time during training, which we refer to as “SkipLR”. We model SGD as a stochastic gradient flow and show that when starting from the same initial parameters, switching the learning rate causes the loss curves to contract towards each other. We demonstrate this theoretically for some simple cases, and empirically on large language models. Our analysis provides insight into how learning rate schedules affect the training dynamics, and could inform the design of new schedules to accelerate convergence. | Shreyas Subramanian, Vignesh Ganapathiraman, Corey Barrett |  |

However, their reliability is hindered by issues of hallucination and generating non-factual content. This is particularly problematic in long-form responses, where assessing and ensuring factual accuracy is complex. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing FactAlign, a novel alignment framework designed to enhance the factuality of LLMs’ long-form responses while maintaining their helpfulness. We introduce fKTO, a fine-grained, sentence-level alignment algorithm that extends the Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) alignment method. Leveraging recent advances in automatic factuality evaluation, FactAlign utilizes fine-grained factuality assessments to guide the alignment process. Our experiments on open-domain prompts and information-seeking questions demonstrate that FactAlign significantly improves the factual accuracy of LLM responses while also improving their... | ChaoWei Huang, YunNung Chen |  |

While fine-tuning and in-context learning are effective approaches for adapting LMs to emerging tasks, they can be costly and inefficient. Recently, some researchers have focused on achieving efficient task adaptation via hypernetwork, which is a meta network that generates task-specific weights based on task-oriented information without any optimization. However, the training of hypernetworks often lacks stability since the optimization signal is not straightforward, and the task information is not adequately representative. Moreover, previous works train hypenetworks with the general corpus, which is struggling with few-shot adaptation. To address these issues, we introduce HyperLoRA, a hypernetwork for LoRA parameters generation involving hypernetwork pre-training on instruction-following data and generalization fine-tuning on sparse task data.

Despite the intuitive importance of high-quality demonstrations, previous work has observed that, in some settings, ICL performance is minimally affected by irrelevant labels (Min et al., 2022). We hypothesize that LMs perform ICL with irrelevant labels via two sequential processes: an inference function that solves the task, followed by a verbalization function that maps the inferred answer to the label space. Importantly, we hypothesize that the inference function is invariant to remappings of the label space (e.g., “true”/“false” to “cat”/“dog”), enabling LMs to share the same inference function across settings with different label words. We empirically validate this hypothesis with controlled layer-wise interchange intervention experiments. Our findings confirm the hypotheses on multiple datasets and tasks (natural language inference,... | Junyi Tao, Xiaoyin Chen, Nelson F. Liu |  |

In DAO, we introduce two novel modules: the Diverse-RAG (DRAG) module and the Adaptive Conformal Prediction (AdaCP) module. DRAG systematically retrieves supporting information that best fits the debate discussion, while AdaCP enhances the accuracy and reliability of event extraction by effectively rejecting less promising answers. Experimental results demonstrate a significant reduction in the performance gap between supervised approaches and tuning-free LLM-based methods by 18.1% and 17.8% on ACE05 and 17.9% and 15.2% on CASIE for event detection and argument extraction respectively. | Sijia Wang, Lifu Huang |  |

Simultaneously, it has become easier than ever to use AI tools to generate photorealistic images depicting any scene imaginable. Combining these two—AI-generated fake news content—is particularly potent and dangerous. To combat the spread of AI-generated fake news, we propose the MiRAGeNews Dataset, a dataset of 12,500 high-quality real and AI-generated image-caption pairs from state-of-the-art generators. We find that our dataset poses a significant challenge to humans (60% F-1) and state-of-the-art multi-modal LLMs (< 24% F-1). Using our dataset we train a multi-modal detector (MiRAGe) that improves by +5.1% F-1 over state-of-the-art baselines on image-caption pairs from out-of-domain image generators and news publishers. We release our code and data to aid future work on detecting AI-generated content. | Runsheng Huang, Liam Dugan, Yue Yang, Chris CallisonBurch |  |

Despite their impressive capabilities, MLLMs often suffer from over-reliance on unimodal biases (e.g., language bias and vision bias), leading to incorrect answers in complex multimodal tasks. To investigate this issue, we propose a causal framework to interpret the biases in Visual Question Answering (VQA) problems. Within this framework, we conduct an in-depth causal analysis to assess the causal effect of these biases on MLLM predictions. Based on the analysis, we introduce 1) a novel MORE dataset with 12,000 challenging VQA instances requiring multi-hop reasoning and overcoming unimodal biases. 2) a causality-enhanced agent framework CAVE that guides models to comprehensively integrate information from different modalities and mitigate biases. Our experiments show that MLLMs perform poorly on MORE, indicating strong unimodal biases and limited semantic understanding.... | Meiqi Chen, Yixin Cao, Yan Zhang, Chaochao Lu |  |

Human teachers are usually required to craft in-context demonstrations, which are costly and have high variance. We ask whether a large language model (LLM) can serve as a more effective in-context teacher for itself or otherLLMs, compared to humans. Inspired by the Encoding Specificity Hypothesis from human episodic memory, we hypothesize thatin-context exemplars crafted by the teacher should match the training data of the student. This hypothesis motivates us to propose Self-Explain where an LLM’s self-elicited explanations are used as in-context demonstrations for prompting it as they are generalized fromthe model’s training examples. Self-Explain is shown to significantly outperform using human-crafted exemplars and other baselines.Furthermore, we reveal that for ICT, rationales from different teacher LLMs or human experts that more... | Jiachen Zhao, Zonghai Yao, Zhichao Yang, Hong Yu |  |

We introduce the task of judging social acceptance. Social acceptance requires models to judge and rationalize the acceptability of people’s actions in social situations. For example, is it socially acceptable for a neighbor to ask others in the community to keep their pets indoors at night? We find that LLMs’ understanding of social acceptance is often misaligned with human consensus. To alleviate this, we introduce SocialGaze, a multi-step prompting framework, in which a language model verbalizes a social situation from multiple perspectives before forming a judgment. Our experiments demonstrate that the SocialGaze approach improves the alignment with human judgments by up to 11 F1 points with the GPT-3.5 model. We also identify biases and correlations in LLMs in... | Anvesh Rao Vijjini, Rakesh R. Menon, Jiayi Fu, Shashank Srivastava, Snigdha Chaturvedi |  |

Though large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in many reasoning tasks, temporal reasoning remains challenging due to its intrinsic complexity. In this work, we first study an essential task of temporal reasoning—temporal graph generation, to unveil LLMs’ inherent, global reasoning capabilities. We show that this task presents great challenges even for the most powerful LLMs, such as GPT-3.5/4. We also notice a significant performance gap by small models (< 10B) that lag behind LLMs by 50%. Next, we study how to close this gap with a budget constraint, e.g., not using model finetuning. We propose a new prompting technique tailored for temporal reasoning, Narrative-of-Thought (NoT), that first converts the events set to a Python class, then prompts a small model to generate a temporally grounded narrative,... | Xinliang Frederick Zhang, Nicholas Beauchamp, Lu Wang |  |

Our approach first discovers the underlying intents from target domain demonstrations unsupervisedly, in a highly compact form (up to three words). With the extracted intents, we train our intent predictor to predict the next intent given the agent’s past observations and actions. In particular, we propose a self-exploration approach where top-k probable intent predictions are provided as a hint to the pre-trained LLM agent, which leads to enhanced decision-making capabilities. Auto-Intent substantially improves the performance of GPT-3.5, 4 and Llama-3.1-70B, 405B agents on the large-scale real-website navigation benchmarks from Mind2Web and online navigation tasks from WebArena with its cross-benchmark generalization from Mind2Web. | Jaekyeom Kim, DongKi Kim, Lajanugen Logeswaran, Sungryull Sohn, Honglak Lee |  |

This study introduces a Pathological Clue-driven Representation Learning (PCRL) model to build cross-modal representations based on pathological clues and naturally adapt them for accurate report generation.Specifically, we construct pathological clues from perspectives of segmented regions, pathological entities, and report themes, to fully grasp visual pathological patterns and learn cross-modal feature representations.

We present P-FOLIO, a human-annotated dataset consisting of diverse and complex reasoning chains for a set of realistic logical reasoning stories also written by humans. P-FOLIO is collected with an annotation protocol that facilitates humans to annotate well-structured natural language proofs for first-order logic reasoning problems in a step-by-step manner. The number of reasoning steps in P-FOLIO span from 0 to 20. We further use P-FOLIO to evaluate and improve large-language-model (LLM) reasoning capabilities. We evaluate LLM reasoning capabilities at a fine granularity via single-step inference rule classification, with more diverse inference rules of more diverse and higher levels of complexities than previous works.

Existing approaches struggle with CQA due to two challenges: (1) precisely identifying necessary conditions and the logical relationship, and (2) verifying conditions to detect any that are missing. In this paper, we propose a novel prompting approach, Chain of condition, by first identifying all conditions and constructing their logical relationships explicitly according to the document, then verifying whether these conditions are satisfied, finally solving the logical expression to indicate any missing conditions and generating the answer accordingly. Experiments on two CQA benchmark datasets show our chain of condition outperforms existing prompting baselines, establishing a new state of the art. Furthermore, with only a few examples, our method can facilitate GPT-3.5-Turbo or GPT-4 to outperform all existing supervised models. | Jiuheng Lin, Yuxuan Lai, Yansong Feng |  |

However, the growing research on leveraging persona in LLMs is relatively disorganized and lacks a systematic taxonomy. To close the gap, we present a comprehensive survey to categorize the current state of the field. We identify two lines of research, namely (1) \*LLM Role-Playing\*, where personas are assigned to LLMs, and (2) \*LLM Personalization\*, where LLMs take care of user personas. Additionally, we introduce existing methods for LLM personality evaluation. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first survey for role-playing and personalization in LLMs under the unified view of persona. We continuously maintain a paper collection to foster future endeavors. | YuMin Tseng, YuChao Huang, TengYun Hsiao, WeiLin Chen, ChaoWei Huang, Yu Meng, YunNung Chen |  |

However, previous research has two main issues: 1) a lack of data in low-resource settings, and 2) inconsistent definitions and criteria for judging harmful content, requiring classification models to be robust to spurious features and diverse. We propose Toxicraft, a novel framework for synthesizing datasets of harmful information to address these weaknesses. With only a small amount of seed data, our framework can generate a wide variety of synthetic, yet remarkably realistic, examples of toxic information. Experimentation across various datasets showcases a notable enhancement in detection model robustness and adaptability, surpassing or close to the gold labels. | Zheng Hui, Zhaoxiao Guo, Hang Zhao, Juanyong Duan, Congrui Huang |  |

The key tradeoff is between how much hidden information can be introduced and how much the model can be perturbed. To address this tradeoff, we show how to adapt strategies previously used for LLM watermarking to encode large amounts of information. We tackle the practical (but difficult) setting where we do not have access to the full model when trying to recover the hidden information. Theoretically, we study the fundamental limits in how much steganographic information can be inserted into LLM-created outputs. We provide practical encoding schemes and present experimental results showing that our proposed strategies are nearly optimal. | Daniel Silva, Frederic Sala, Ryan Gabrys |  |

We employ ValueScope to dissect and analyze linguistic and stylistic expressions across 13 Reddit communities categorized under gender, politics, science, and finance. Our analysis provides a quantitative foundation confirming that even closely related communities exhibit remarkably diverse norms. This diversity supports existing theories and adds a new dimension to understanding community interactions. ValueScope not only delineates differences in social norms but also effectively tracks their evolution and the influence of significant external events like the U.S. presidential elections and the emergence of new sub-communities. The framework thus highlights the pivotal role of social norms in shaping online interactions, presenting a substantial advance in both the theory and... | Chan Young Park, Shuyue Stella Li, Hayoung Jung, Svitlana Volkova, Tanushree Mitra, David Jurgens, Yulia Tsvetkov |  |

A Deep Dive into Consistency and Robustness](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.findings-emnlp.973) |  | 0 | Chart question answering (CQA) is a crucial area of Visual Language Understanding. However, the robustness and consistency of current Visual Language Models (VLMs) in this field remain under-explored. This paper evaluates state-of-the-art VLMs on comprehensive datasets, developed specifically for this study, encompassing diverse question categories and chart formats. We investigate two key aspects: 1) the models’ ability to handle varying levels of chart and question complexity, and 2) their robustness across different visual representations of the same underlying data. Our analysis reveals significant performance variations based on question and chart types, highlighting both strengths and weaknesses of current models. Additionally, we identify areas for improvement and propose future research directions to build more robust and reliable CQA systems. This study sheds light on the limitations of current models and paves the way for future advancements in the field. | Srija Mukhopadhyay, Adnan Qidwai, Aparna Garimella, Pritika Ramu, Vivek Gupta, Dan Roth |  |

Prior research has shown that pretrained language models (PLMs) such as SciBERT can achieve state-of-the-art performance on CIC benchmarks. PLMs are trained via self-supervision tasks on a large corpus of general text and can quickly adapt to CIC tasks via moderate fine-tuning on the corresponding dataset. Despite their advantages, PLMs can easily overfit small datasets during fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose a multi-task learning (MTL) framework that jointly fine-tunes PLMs on a dataset of primary interest together with multiple auxiliary CIC datasets to take advantage of additional supervision signals. We develop a data-driven task relation learning (TRL) method that controls the contribution of auxiliary datasets to avoid negative transfer and expensive hyper-parameter tuning.

However, the multimodal pre-training has limitations in terms of resources and training time when it comes to obtaining new models that surpass existing models. To overcome these issues, we propose TransferCVLM, a method of efficient knowledge transfer that integrates pre-trained uni-modal models (and cross-modal fusion-encoder) into a combined vision-language model (CVLM), without pre-training the CVLM with large amount of multimodal data, and then for each task application, fine-tunes the CVLM and transfers the multimodal knowledge of a teacher vision-language model to the CVLM by using knowledge distillation techniques. We demonstrate that 1) the fine-tuned CVLM performs comparable to other vision-language models of similar size, that 2) the multimodal knowledge transfer consistently enhances the CVLM, and the knowledge-transferred CVLM... | Dongha Choi, JungJae Kim, Hyunju Lee |  |

In this work, we demonstrate that streaming Transformer-Transducer (TT) models can be trained from scratch in consumer and accessible GPUs in their entirety with pseudo-labeled (PL) speech from foundational speech models (FSM). This allows training a robust ASR model just in one stage and does not require large data and computational budget compared to the two-step scenario with pre-training and fine-tuning. We perform a comprehensive ablation on different aspects of PL-based streaming TT models such as the impact of (1) shallow fusion of n-gram LMs, (2) contextual biasing with named entities, (3) chunk-wise decoding for low-latency streaming applications, and (4) TT overall performance as the function of the FSM size. Our results demonstrate that TT can be trained from scratch without supervised data, even with very noisy PLs. We validate the proposed framework on 6... | Iuliia Thorbecke, Juan Pablo ZuluagaGomez, Esaú VillatoroTello, Shashi Kumar, Pradeep Rangappa, Sergio Burdisso, Petr Motlícek, Karthik S, Aravind Ganapathiraju |  |

However, they may still falter on more complex problems, making errors that disrupt their reasoning paths. We attribute this to the expansive solution space, where each step has the risk of diverging into mistakes. To enhance language model reasoning, we introduce a specialized training framework called Reasoning Paths Optimization (RPO), which enables learning to reason and explore from diverse paths. Our approach encourages favorable branches at each reasoning step while penalizing unfavorable ones, enhancing the model’s overall problem-solving performance. Reasoning Paths Optimization does not rely on large-scale human-annotated rationales or outputs from closed-source models, making it scalable and data-efficient. We focus on multi-step reasoning tasks, such as math word problems and science-based exam questions. The experiments demonstrate that our framework... | Yew Ken Chia, Guizhen Chen, Weiwen Xu, Anh Tuan Luu, Soujanya Poria, Lidong Bing |  |

However, interacting with external tools introduces inherent uncertainties due to imperfections and misalignments between the tools’ outputs and the agents’ internal models, often leading to suboptimal outcomes. We thus study the problem of tool-use calibration in language agents, and identify prompt design and execution trace selection as two primary areas that suffer from miscalibration. We then propose ProbeCal, which recalibrates the internal probabilities of tool-using language agents to better reflect the actual effectiveness of tool, and enables a more appropriate selection of prompts and execution paths. We empirically show that ProbeCal can significantly and consistently improve off-the-shelf language models in tool-using applications. | Hao Liu, ZiYi Dou, Yixin Wang, Nanyun Peng, Yisong Yue |  |

This paper introduces the novel task of Personalized Video Comment Generation (PVCG), aiming to predict user comments tailored to both the input video and the user’s comment history, where the user is unseen during the model training process. Unlike existing video captioning tasks that ignores the personalization in the text generation process, we introduce PerVidCom, a new dataset specifically collected for this novel task with diverse personalized comments from YouTube. Recognizing the limitations of existing captioning metrics for evaluating this task, we propose a new automatic metric based on Large Language Models (LLMs) with few-shot in-context learning, named FICL-Score, specifically measuring quality from the aspects of emotion, language style and content relevance. We verify the proposed metric with human evaluations. We establish baselines using prominent... | Xudong Lin, Ali Zare, Shiyuan Huang, MingHsuan Yang, ShihFu Chang, Li Zhang |  |

This paper introduces a novel benchmark, BeyondX, designed to address these limitations by incorporating problems with multiple unknowns. Recognizing the challenges in proposing multi-unknown problems from scratch, we developed BeyondX using an innovative automated pipeline that progressively increases complexity by expanding the number of unknowns in simpler problems. Empirical study on BeyondX reveals that the performance of existing LLMs, even those fine-tuned specifically on math tasks, significantly decreases as the number of unknowns increases - with a performance drop of up to 70% observed in GPT-4. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Formulate-and-Solve strategy,... | KueiChun Kao, Ruochen Wang, ChoJui Hsieh |  |

However, existing approaches often struggle to grasp the intricate logical structures and relationships inherent in medical contexts, thus limiting their capacity to furnish precise and nuanced answers. In this work, we address this gap by proposing a novel Abstractive QA system MedLogic-AQA that harnesses first-order logic-based rules extracted from both context and questions to generate well-grounded answers. Through initial experimentation, we identified six pertinent first-order logical rules, which were then used to train a Logic-Understanding (LU) model capable of generating logical triples for a given context, question, and answer. These logic triples are then integrated into the training of MediLogic-AQA, enabling reasoned and coherent reasoning during answer generation. This distinctive fusion of logical reasoning with abstractive... | Aizan Zafar, Kshitij Mishra, Asif Ekbal |  |

State-of-the-art systems of metaphor detection implement heuristic principles such as Metaphor Identification Procedure (MIP) and Selection Preference Violation (SPV). We propose an innovative approach that leverages the cognitive information of embodiment that can be derived from word embeddings, and explicitly models the process of sensorimotor change that has been demonstrated as essential for human metaphor processing. We showed that this cognitively motivated module is effective and can improve metaphor detection, compared with the heuristic MIP that has been applied previously. | Yu Li, Bo Peng, YuYin Hsu, ChuRen Huang |  |

Despite these advancements, LLMs still encounter challenges with length control, frequently failing to adhere to specific length constraints due to their token-level operations and insufficient training on data with strict length limitations. We identify this issue as stemming from a lack of positional awareness and propose novel approaches—PositionID Prompting and PositionID Fine-Tuning—to address it. These methods enhance the model’s ability to continuously monitor and manage text length during generation. Additionally, we introduce PositionID CP Prompting to enable LLMs to perform copy and paste operations accurately. Furthermore, we develop two benchmarks for evaluating length control and copy-paste abilities. Our experiments demonstrate that our methods significantly improve the model’s adherence to length... | Noah Wang, Feiyu Duan, Yibo Zhang, Wangchunshu Zhou, Ke Xu, Wenhao Huang, Jie Fu |  |

This approach utilizes one or more large language models (LLMs) to assess the quality of outputs from other LLMs. However, existing methods rely on generic scoring rubrics that fail to consider the specificities of each question and its problem-solving process, compromising precision and stability in assessments. Inspired by human examination scoring processes, we propose a new evaluation paradigm based on self-adaptive rubrics. Specifically, we create detailed scoring rubrics for each question, capturing the primary and secondary criteria in a structured format of scoring and deduction points that mimic a human evaluator’s analytical process. Building on this paradigm, we further develop a novel benchmark called SedarEval, which covers a range of domains including long-tail knowledge, mathematics, coding, and logical reasoning.

For example, models trained on the reasoning-focused dataset GQA struggle to effectively handle samples from the knowledge-emphasizing dataset OKVQA. Meanwhile, in real-world scenarios, it is user-unfriendly to restrict the domain of questions. Therefore, this paper proposes a necessary task: One-to-Many Visual Question Answering, of which the ultimate goal is to enable a single model to answer as many different domains of questions as possible by the effective integration of available VQA resources. To this end, we first investigate into ten common VQA datasets, and break the task of VQA down into the integration of three key abilities.Then, considering assorted questions rely on different VQA abilities, this paper proposes a novel dynamic Mixture of LoRAs (MoL) strategy.

However, existing research on ECRE has highlighted two critical challenges, including the lack of document-level modeling and causal hallucinations. In this paper, we propose a Knowledge-guided binary Question Answering (KnowQA) method with event structures for ECRE, consisting of two stages: Event Structure Construction and Binary Question Answering. We conduct extensive experiments under both zero-shot and fine-tuning settings with large language models (LLMs) on the MECI and MAVEN-ERE datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the usefulness of event structures on document-level ECRE and the effectiveness of KnowQA by achieving state-of-the-art on the MECI dataset. We observe not only the effectiveness but also the high generalizability and low inconsistency of our method,... | Zimu Wang, Lei Xia, Wei Xjtlu, Xinya Du |  |

While rotation-based methods like RotatE and QuatE perform well in KGE, they face two challenges: limited model flexibility requiring proportional increases in relation size with entity dimension, and difficulties in generalizing the model for higher-dimensional rotations. To address these issues, we introduce OrthogonalE, a novel KGE model employing matrices for entities and block-diagonal orthogonal matrices with Riemannian optimization for relations. This approach not only enhances the generality and flexibility of KGE models but also captures several relation patterns that rotation-based methods can identify. Experimental results indicate that our new KGE model, OrthogonalE, offers generality and flexibility, captures several relation patterns, and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art KGE models while substantially reducing... | Yihua Zhu, Hidetoshi Shimodaira |  |

However, the memory requirements of LLMs present a great challenge when deploying on memory-limited devices, even for quantized LLMs. This paper introduces a framework to compress LLM after quantization further, achieving about 2.2x compression ratio. A compression-aware quantization is first proposed to enhance model weight compressibility by re-scaling the model parameters before quantization, followed by a pruning method to improve further. Upon this, we notice that decompression can be a bottleneck during practical scenarios. We then give a detailed analysis of the trade-off between memory usage and latency brought by the proposed method. A speed-adaptive method is proposed to overcome it. The experimental results show inference with the compressed model can achieve a 40% reduction in memory size with negligible loss in accuracy and inference speed. | Weilan Wang, Yu Mao, Dongdong Tang, Hongchao Du, Nan Guan, Chun Jason Xue |  |

Our model facilitates a wide range of medical interactions in English and Arabic, including multi-turn chats to inquire about additional details such as patient symptoms and medical history, multiple-choice question answering, and open-ended question answering. We propose a semi-automated English-to-Arabic translation pipeline with human refinement to ensure high-quality translations. We also introduce a comprehensive evaluation benchmark for Arabic medical LLMs. Furthermore, we introduce BiMed1.3M, an extensive Arabic-English bilingual instruction set that covers 1.3 Million diverse medical interactions, including 200k synthesized multi-turn doctor-patient chats, in a 1:2 Arabic-to-English ratio.

However, their growing prevalence demands higher reliability and safety including robustness to adversarial attacks. We systematically examine the possibility of incorporating adversarial robustness through various model design choices. We explore the effects of different vision encoders, the resolutions of vision encoders, and the size and type of language models. Additionally, we introduce novel, cost-effective approaches to enhance robustness through prompt engineering. By simply suggesting the possibility of adversarial perturbations or rephrasing questions, we demonstrate substantial improvements in model robustness against strong image-based attacks such as Auto-PGD. Our findings provide important guidelines for developing more robust VLMs, particularly for deployment in... | Rishika Bhagwatkar, Shravan Nayak, Pouya Bashivan, Irina Rish |  |

Despite these advancements, such systems often rely on a large amount of training data annotated with natural logic. To address this issue, we propose a zero-shot method that utilizes the generalization capabilities of instruction-tuned large language models. To comprehensively assess the zero-shot capabilities of our method and other fact verification systems, we evaluate all models on both artificial and real-world claims, including multilingual datasets. We also compare our method against other fact verification systems in two setups. First, in the zero-shot generalization setup, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms other systems that were not specifically trained on natural logic data, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 8.96 points over the best-performing... | Marek Strong, Rami Aly, Andreas Vlachos |  |

In most real-world scenarios, the domain (style and topic) of generated data and the generator model are not known in advance. In this work, we focus on the robustness of classifier-based detectors of AI-generated text, namely their ability to transfer to unseen generators or semantic domains. We investigate the geometry of the embedding space of Transformer-based text encoders and show that clearing out harmful linear subspaces helps to train a robust classifier, ignoring domain-specific spurious features. We investigate several subspace decomposition and feature selection strategies and achieve significant improvements over state of the art methods in cross-domain and cross-generator transfer. Our best approaches for head-wise and coordinate-based subspace removal increase the mean out-of-distribution (OOD) classification score by up to 9% and 14% in particular setups for RoBERTa and BERT... | Kristian Kuznetsov, Eduard Tulchinskii, Laida Kushnareva, German Magai, Serguei Barannikov, Sergey I.

Despite considerable research dedicated to enhancing robustness against adversarial attacks, the realm of provable robustness for backdoor attacks remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we initiate a pioneering investigation into the certified robustness of NLP models against backdoor triggers.We propose a model-agnostic mechanism for large-scale models that applies to complex model structures without the need for assessing model architecture or internal knowledge. More importantly, we take recent advances in randomized smoothing theory and propose a novel weight-based distribution algorithm to enable semantic similarity and provide theoretical robustness guarantees.Experimentally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach across a diverse range of datasets and tasks, highlighting its utility in mitigating backdoor triggers.

However, they introduce significant latency in multi-tenant settings due to the LoRA modules and MOE routers added to multiple linear modules in the Transformer layer. To address this issue, we propose Mixture of Low-Rank Adaptation (MiLoRA), a novel and efficient LoRA variant. MiLoRA differs from previous MOE-style LoRA methods by considering each LoRA module as an expert and employing a prompt-aware routing mechanism. This mechanism calculates expert routing results once before generating the first new token and reuses these results for subsequent tokens, reducing latency. Extensive experiments and analysis on commonsense reasoning tasks, math reasoning tasks, and widely used LLM evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that MiLoRA consistently outperforms strong PEFT baselines with comparable tunable parameter budgets. Additionally, MiLoRA significantly... | Jingfan Zhang, Yi Zhao, Dan Chen, Xing Tian, Huanran Zheng, Wei Zhu |  |

Recently, this has been approached by prompting LLMs with survey questions and quantifying the stances in the outputs towards morally and politically charged statements. However, the stances generated by LLMs can vary greatly depending on how they are prompted, and there are many ways to argue for or against a given position. In this work, we propose to address this by analysing a large and robust dataset of 156k LLM responses to the 62 propositions of the Political Compass Test (PCT) generated by 6 LLMs using 420 prompt variations. We perform coarse-grained analysis of their generated stances and fine-grained analysis of the plain text justifications for those stances. For fine-grained analysis, we propose to identify tropes in the responses: semantically similar phrases that are recurrent and consistent across different prompts, revealing natural... | Dustin Wright, Arnav Arora, Nadav Borenstein, Srishti Yadav, Serge J.

We conducted a large-scale human evaluation of \*HumanEval\* and \*MBPP\*, two popular benchmarks for Python code generation, analyzing their diversity and difficulty. Our findings unveil a critical bias towards a limited set of programming concepts, neglecting most of the other concepts entirely. Furthermore, we uncover a worrying prevalence of easy tasks that can inflate model performance estimations. To address these limitations, we propose a novel benchmark, \*PythonSaga\*, featuring 185 hand-crafted prompts in a balanced representation of 38 programming concepts across diverse difficulty levels. The robustness of our benchmark is demonstrated by the poor performance of existing Code-LLMs. The code and data set are openly available to the NLP community at this [URL](https://github.com/PythonSaga/PythonSaga). | Ankit Yadav, Himanshu Beniwal, Mayank Singh |  |

Combining GEC models that have complementary strengths in correcting different error types is very effective in producing better corrections. However, system combination incurs a high computational cost due to the need to run inference on the base systems before running the combination method itself. Therefore, it would be more efficient to have a single model with multiple sub-networks that specialize in correcting different error types. In this paper, we propose a mixture-of-experts model, MoECE, for grammatical error correction. Our model successfully achieves the performance of T5-XL with three times fewer effective parameters. Additionally, our model produces interpretable corrections by also identifying the error type during inference. | Muhammad Reza Qorib, Alham Aji, Hwee Tou Ng |  |

However, most modern large language models (LLMs) suffer from hallucinations, that is, they generate responses not supported by or even contradicting the knowledge source. To mitigate the issue and increase faithfulness of information-seeking dialogue systems supported by the LLMs, we introduce BeInfo, a simple yet effective method that applies ‘behavioural tuning’ on the LLMs to aid information-seeking dialogue. Relying on three standard information seeking dialogue datasets, we show that models tuned with BeInfo become considerably more faithful to the knowledge source both for datasets and domains seen during BeInfo-tuning, as well as on unseen domains, when applied in a zero-shot manner. In addition, we present a ‘real-life’ case study on conversations with real... | Evgeniia Razumovskaia, Ivan Vulic, Pavle Markovic, Tomasz Cichy, Qian Zheng, TsungHsien Wen, Pawel Budzianowski |  |

Therefore, determining whether to retrieve is crucial for RAG, which is usually referred to as Active Retrieval. However, existing active retrieval methods face two challenges: 1. They usually rely on a single criterion, which struggles with handling various types of instructions. 2. They depend on specialized and highly differentiated procedures, and thus combining them makes the RAG system more complicated and leads to higher response latency. To address these challenges, we propose Unified Active Retrieval (UAR). UAR contains four orthogonal criteria and casts them into plug-and-play classification tasks, which achieves multifaceted retrieval timing judgements with negligible extra inference cost. We further introduce the Unified Active Retrieval Criteria (UAR-Criteria), designed to process diverse active retrieval scenarios through a standardized procedure.... | Qinyuan Cheng, Xiaonan Li, Shimin Li, Qin Zhu, Zhangyue Yin, Yunfan Shao, Linyang Li, Tianxiang Sun, Hang Yan, Xipeng Qiu |  |

However, such language adaptation is often accompanied by catastrophic forgetting of the base model’s capabilities, severely limiting the usefulness of the resulting model. We address this issue by proposing Branch-and-Merge (BaM), a new adaptation method based on iteratively merging multiple models, fine-tuned on a subset of the available training data. BaM is based on the insight that this yields lower magnitude but higher quality weight changes, reducing forgetting of the source domain while maintaining learning on the target domain. We demonstrate in an extensive empirical study on Bulgarian and German that BaM can significantly reduce forgetting while matching or even improving target domain performance compared to both standard continued pretraining and instruction finetuning across different... | Anton Alexandrov, Veselin Raychev, Mark Mueller, Ce Zhang, Martin T.

However, their accuracy performance still can not satisfy the entire academic and industry community. In this work, we propose ATQ, an INT8 weight-activation quantization of LLMs, that can achieve almost lossless accuracy. We employ a mathematically equivalent transformation and a triangle inequality to constrain weight-activation quantization error to the sum of a weight quantization error and an activation quantization error. For the weight part, transformed weights are quantized along the \|in-feature\| dimension and the quantization error is compensated by optimizing following in-features. For the activation part, transformed activations are in the normal range and can be quantized easily. We provide comparison experiments to demonstrate that our ATQ method can achieve almost lossless in accuracy on OPT... | Yundong Gai, Ping Li |  |

However, naively fine-tuning them for specific downstream tasks often requires updating a vast number of parameters, resulting in high computational costs and overfitting when training data is limited. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, called \*Stochastic Tuning\*, that addresses these challenges by selectively updating a small subset of parameters in each step of the tuning process. Our approach is characterized by its customization of updates based on task-specific partial gradients with respect to stochastic sub-networks. The advantage of Stochastic Tuning over existing solutions lies in its ability to consider both parameter weights as well as forward values which guarantees a context-sensitive fine-tuning. Our experiments demonstrate that Stochastic Tuning outperforms existing lightweight fine-tuning... | Mohammad AkbarTajari, Mohammad Taher Pilehvar |  |

Analyzing Self-Consistency of Large Language Models under Ambiguity](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.findings-emnlp.1003) |  | 0 | One of the major aspects contributing to the striking performance of large language models (LLMs) is the vast amount of factual knowledge accumulated during pre-training. Yet, many LLMs suffer from self-inconsistency, which raises doubts about their trustworthiness and reliability. This paper focuses on entity type ambiguity, analyzing the proficiency and consistency of state-of-the-art LLMs in applying factual knowledge when prompted with ambiguous entities. To do so, we propose an evaluation protocol that disentangles knowing from applying knowledge, and test state-of-the-art LLMs on 49 ambiguous entities. Our experiments reveal that LLMs struggle with choosing the correct entity reading, achieving an average accuracy of only 85%, and as low as 75% with underspecified prompts. The results also reveal systematic discrepancies in LLM behavior, showing that while the models may possess knowledge, they struggle to apply it consistently, exhibit biases toward preferred readings, and... | Anastasiia Sedova, Robert Litschko, Diego Frassinelli, Benjamin Roth, Barbara Plank |  |
