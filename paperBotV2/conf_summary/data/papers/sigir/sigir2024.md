| 1 |  |  [CWRCzech: 100M Query-Document Czech Click Dataset and Its Application to Web Relevance Ranking](https://doi.org/10.1145/3626772.3657851) |  | 0 | We present CWRCzech, Click Web Ranking dataset for Czech, a 100M query-document Czech click dataset for relevance ranking with user behavior data collected from search engine logs of Seznam.cz. To the best of our knowledge, CWRCzech is the largest click dataset with raw text published so far. It provides document positions in the search results as well as information about user behavior: 27.6M clicked documents and 10.8M dwell times. In addition, we also publish a manually annotated Czech test for the relevance task, containing nearly 50k query-document pairs, each annotated by at least 2 annotators. Finally, we analyze how the user behavior data improve relevance ranking and show that models trained on data automatically harnessed at sufficient scale can surpass the performance of models trained on human annotated data. CWRCzech is published under an academic non-commercial license and is available to the research community at https://github.com/seznam/CWRCzech. | Josef Vonásek, Milan Straka, Rostislav Krc, Lenka Lasonová, Ekaterina Egorova, Jana Straková, Jakub Náplava | Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics, Charles University; Seznam.cz |
| 2 |  |  [A Unified Search and Recommendation Framework Based on Multi-Scenario Learning for Ranking in E-commerce](https://doi.org/10.1145/3626772.3661356) |  | 0 | Search and recommendation (S R) are the two most important scenarios in e-commerce. The majority of users typically interact with products in S R scenarios, indicating the need and potential for joint modeling. Traditional multi-scenario models use shared parameters to learn the similarity of multiple tasks, and task-specific parameters to learn the divergence of individual tasks. This coarse-grained modeling approach does not effectively capture the differences between S R scenarios. Furthermore, this approach does not sufficiently exploit the information across the global label space. These issues can result in the suboptimal performance of multi-scenario models in handling both S R scenarios. To address these issues, we propose an effective and universal framework for Unified Search and Recommendation (USR), designed with S R Views User Interest Extractor Layer (IE) and S R Views Feature Generator Layer (FG) to separately generate user interests and scenario-agnostic feature representations for S R. Next, we introduce a Global Label Space Multi-Task Layer (GLMT) that uses global labels as supervised signals of auxiliary tasks and jointly models the main task and auxiliary tasks using conditional probability. Extensive experimental evaluations on real-world industrial datasets show that USR can be applied to various multi-scenario models and significantly improve their performance. Online A/B testing also indicates substantial performance gains across multiple metrics. Currently, USR has been successfully deployed in the 7Fresh App. | Jinhan Liu, Qiyu Chen, Junjie Xu, Junjie Li, Baoli Li, Sulong Xu | JD or JD.com; JD |

However, it is not without its challenges: retraining graph embeddings frequently due to changing data is slow and costly, and producing high recall of approximate nearest neighbor search (ANN) on such embeddings is challenging due to the power law distribution of the indexed users. In this work, we address theses issues by introducing a simple query expansion method in ANN, called FriendSeedSelection, where for each node query, we construct a set of 1-hop embeddings and run ANN search. We highlight our approach does not require any model-level tuning, and is inferred from the data at test-time. This design choice effectively enables our recommendation system to adapt to the changing graph distribution without frequent heavy model retraining. We also discuss how we design our system to efficiently construct such queries online to support 10k+ QPS. For friend recommendation, our method shows improvements of recall, and 11% relative friend reciprocated communication metric gains, now serving over 800 million monthly active users at Snapchat. | Pau PerngHwa Kung, Zihao Fan, Tong Zhao, Yozen Liu, Zhixin Lai, Jiahui Shi, Yan Wu, Jun Yu, Neil Shah, Ganesh Venkataraman | Snap |
| 4 |  |  [Doing Personal LAPS: LLM-Augmented Dialogue Construction for Personalized Multi-Session Conversational Search](https://doi.org/10.1145/3626772.3657815) |  | 0 | The future of conversational agents will provide users with personalized information responses. However, a significant challenge in developing models is the lack of large-scale dialogue datasets that span multiple sessions and reflect real-world user preferences. Previous approaches rely on experts in a wizard-of-oz setup that is difficult to scale, particularly for personalized tasks. Our method, LAPS, addresses this by using large language models (LLMs) to guide a single human worker in generating personalized dialogues. This method has proven to speed up the creation process and improve quality. LAPS can collect large-scale, human-written, multi-session, and multi-domain conversations, including extracting user preferences. When compared to existing datasets, LAPS-produced conversations are as natural and diverse as expert-created ones, which stays in contrast with fully synthetic methods. The collected dataset is suited to train preference extraction and personalized response generation. Our results show that responses generated explicitly using extracted preferences better match user's actual preferences, highlighting the value of using extracted preferences over simple dialogue history. Overall, LAPS introduces a new method to leverage LLMs to create realistic personalized conversational data more efficiently and effectively than previous methods. | Hideaki Joko, Shubham Chatterjee, Andrew Ramsay, Arjen P. de Vries, Jeff Dalton, Faegheh Hasibi | Radboud University; University of Glasgow; University of Edinburgh |
| 5 |  |  [Towards a Search Engine for Machines: Unified Ranking for Multiple Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models](https://doi.org/10.1145/3626772.3657733) |  | 0 | This paper introduces uRAG–a framework with a unified retrieval engine that serves multiple downstream retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. Each RAG system consumes the retrieval results for a unique purpose, such as open-domain question answering, fact verification, entity linking, and relation extraction. We introduce a generic training guideline that standardizes the communication between the search engine and the downstream RAG systems that engage in optimizing the retrieval model. This lays the groundwork for us to build a large-scale experimentation ecosystem consisting of 18 RAG systems that engage in training and 18 unknown RAG systems that use the uRAG as the new users of the search engine. Using this experimentation ecosystem, we answer a number of fundamental research questions that improve our understanding of promises and challenges in developing search engines for machines. | Alireza Salemi, Hamed Zamani | University of Massachusetts Amherst |
| 6 |  |  [Sequential Recommendation with Collaborative Explanation via Mutual Information Maximization](https://doi.org/10.1145/3626772.3657770) |  | 0 | Current research on explaining sequential recommendations lacks reliable benchmarks and quantitative metrics, making it difficult to compare explanation performance between different models. In this work, we propose a new explanation type, namely, collaborative explanation, into sequential recommendation, allowing a unified approach for modeling user actions and assessing the performance of both recommendation and explanation. We accomplish this by framing the problem as a joint sequential prediction task, which takes a sequence of user's past item-explanation pairs and predicts the next item along with its associated explanation. We propose a pipeline that comprises data preparation and a model adaptation framework called Sequential recommendation with Collaborative Explanation (SCE). This framework can be flexibly applied to any sequential recommendation model for this problem. Furthermore, to address the issue of inconsistency between item and explanation representations when learning both sub-tasks, we propose Sequential recommendation with Collaborative Explanation via Mutual Information Maximization (SCEMIM). Our extensive experiments demonstrate that: (i) SCE framework is effective in enabling sequential models to make recommendations and provide accurate explanations. (ii) Importantly, SCEMIM enhances the consistency between recommendations and explanations, leading to further improvements in the performance of both sub-tasks. | Yi Yu, Kazunari Sugiyama, Adam Jatowt | Kyoto University; Osaka Seikei University; University of Innsbruck |
| 7 |  |  [A Learning-to-Rank Formulation of Clustering-Based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search](https://doi.org/10.1145/3626772.3657931) |  | 0 | A critical piece of the modern information retrieval puzzle is approximate nearest neighbor search. Its objective is to return a set of k data points that are closest to a query point, with its accuracy measured by the proportion of exact nearest neighbors captured in the returned set. One popular approach to this question is clustering: The indexing algorithm partitions data points into non-overlapping subsets and represents each partition by a point such as its centroid. The query processing algorithm first identifies the nearest clusters – a process known as routing – then performs a nearest neighbor search over those clusters only. In this work, we make a simple observation: The routing function solves a ranking problem. Its quality can therefore be assessed with a ranking metric, making the function amenable to learning-to-rank. Interestingly, ground-truth is often freely available: Given a query distribution in a top-k configuration, the ground-truth is the set of clusters that contain the exact top-k vectors. We develop this insight and apply it to Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS). As we demonstrate empirically on various datasets, learning a simple linear function consistently improves the accuracy of clustering-based MIPS. | Thomas Vecchiato, Claudio Lucchese, Franco Maria Nardini, Sebastian Bruch | ISTI-CNR; Pinecone; Ca' Foscari University of Venice |
| 8 |  |  [A Surprisingly Simple yet Effective Multi-Query Rewriting Method for Conversational Passage Retrieval](https://doi.org/10.1145/3626772.3657933) |  | 0 | Conversational passage retrieval is challenging as it often requires the resolution of references to previous utterances and needs to deal with the complexities of natural language, such as coreference and ellipsis. To address these challenges, pre-trained sequence-to-sequence neural query rewriters are commonly used to generate a single de-contextualized query based on conversation history. Previous research shows that combining multiple query rewrites for the same user utterance has a positive effect on retrieval performance. We propose the use of a neural query rewriter to generate multiple queries and show how to integrate those queries in the passage retrieval pipeline efficiently. The main strength of our approach lies in its simplicity: it leverages how the beam search algorithm works and can produce multiple query rewrites at no additional cost. Our contributions further include devising ways to utilize multi-query rewrites in both sparse and dense first-pass retrieval. We demonstrate that applying our approach on top of a standard passage retrieval pipeline delivers state-of-the-art performance without sacrificing efficiency. | Ivica Kostric, Krisztian Balog | University of Stavanger; University of Stavanger & Google Research |
| 9 |  |  [Memory-Efficient Deep Recommender Systems using Approximate Rotary Compositional Embedding](https://doi.org/10.1145/3626772.3657953) |  | 0 | Embedding tables in deep recommender systems (DRS) process categorical data, which can be memory-intensive due to the high feature cardinality. In this paper, we propose Approximate Rotary Compositional Embedding (ARCE), which intentionally trades off performance to aggressively reduce the size of the embedding tables. Specifically, ARCE uses compositional embedding to split large embedding tables into smaller compositions and replaces index look-ups with vector rotations. To regain the performance loss of this trade-off, ARCE features an input approximation where one index is mapped into multiple indices, creating a larger space for a potential increased learning capability. Experimental results show that using ARCE can reduce the memory overhead of embedding tables in DRS by more than 1000x with less than 3% performance loss, highlighting the potential of using ARCE for less memory intensive DRS designs. We open-source ARCE at https://github.com/VU-DETAIL/arce. | Dongning Ma, Xun Jiao | Villanova University Electrical and Computer Engineering; Villanova University ECE |
| 10 |  |  [Retrieval-Augmented Conversational Recommendation with Prompt-based Semi-Structured Natural Language State Tracking](https://doi.org/10.1145/3626772.3657670) |  | 0 | Conversational recommendation (ConvRec) systems must understand rich and diverse natural language (NL) expressions of user preferences and intents, often communicated in an indirect manner (e.g., "I'm watching my weight"). Such complex utterances make retrieving relevant items challenging, especially if only using often incomplete or out-of-date metadata. Fortunately, many domains feature rich item reviews that cover standard metadata categories and offer complex opinions that might match a user's interests (e.g., "classy joint for a date"). However, only recently have large language models (LLMs) let us unlock the commonsense connections between user preference utterances and complex language in user-generated reviews. Further, LLMs enable novel paradigms for semi-structured dialogue state tracking, complex intent and preference understanding, and generating recommendations, explanations, and question answers. We thus introduce a novel technology RA-Rec, a Retrieval-Augmented, LLM-driven dialogue state tracking system for ConvRec, showcased with a video, open source GitHub repository, and interactive Google Colab notebook. | Sara Kemper, Justin Cui, Kai Dicarlantonio, Kathy Lin, Danjie Tang, Anton Korikov, Scott Sanner | University of Toronto; University of Waterloo |
| 11 |  |  [LLMGR: Large Language Model-based Generative Retrieval in Alipay Search](https://doi.org/10.1145/3626772.3661364) |  | 0 | The search system aims to help users quickly find items according to queries they enter, which includes the retrieval and ranking modules. Traditional retrieval is a multi-stage process, including indexing and sorting, which cannot be optimized end-to-end. With the real data about mini-apps in the Alipay search, we find that many complex queries fail to display the relevant mini-apps, seriously threatening users' search experience. To address the challenges, we propose a Large Language Model-based Generative Retrieval (LLMGR) approach for retrieving mini-app candidates. The information of the mini-apps is encoded into the large model, and the title of the mini-app is directly generated. Through the online A/B test in Alipay search, LLMGR as a supplementary source has statistically significant improvements in the Click-Through Rate (CTR) of the search system compared to traditional methods. In this paper, we have deployed a novel retrieval method for the Alipay search system and demonstrated that generative retrieval methods based on LLM can improve the performance of search system, particularly for complex queries, which have an average increase of 0.2% in CTR. | Chen Wei, Yixin Ji, Zeyuan Chen, Jia Xu, Zhongyi Liu | Soochow University School of Computer Science & Technology; Ant Group; Ant Group Search Recommendation Technology Department |
| 12 |  |  [Optimizing E-commerce Search: Toward a Generalizable and Rank-Consistent Pre-Ranking Model](https://doi.org/10.1145/3626772.3661343) |  | 0 | In large e-commerce platforms, search systems are typically composed of a series of modules, including recall, pre-ranking, and ranking phases. The pre-ranking phase, serving as a lightweight module, is crucial for filtering out the bulk of products in advance for the downstream ranking module. Industrial efforts on optimizing the pre-ranking model have predominantly focused on enhancing ranking consistency, model structure, and generalization towards long-tail items. Beyond these optimizations, meeting the system performance requirements presents a significant challenge. Contrasting with existing industry works, we propose a novel method: a Generalizable and RAnk-ConsistEnt Pre-Ranking Model (GRACE), which achieves: 1) Ranking consistency by introducing multiple binary classification tasks that predict whether a product is within the top-k results as estimated by the ranking model, which facilitates the addition of learning objectives on common point-wise ranking models; 2) Generalizability through contrastive learning of representation for all products by pre-training on a subset of ranking product embeddings; 3) Ease of implementation in feature construction and online deployment. Our extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements in both offline metrics and online A/B test: a 0.75 increase in CVR. | Enqiang Xu, Yiming Qiu, Junyang Bai, Ping Zhang, Dadong Miao, Songlin Wang, Guoyu Tang, Lin Liu, Mingming Li | JD.com |
| 13 |  |  [A Preference-oriented Diversity Model Based on Mutual-information in Re-ranking for E-commerce Search](https://doi.org/10.1145/3626772.3661359) |  | 0 | Re-ranking is a process of rearranging ranking list to more effectively meet user demands by accounting for the interrelationships between items. Existing methods predominantly enhance the precision of search results, often at the expense of diversity, leading to outcomes that may not fulfill the varied needs of users. Conversely, methods designed to promote diversity might compromise the precision of the results, failing to satisfy the users' requirements for accuracy. To alleviate the above problems, this paper proposes a Preference-oriented Diversity Model Based on Mutual-information (PODM-MI), which consider both accuracy and diversity in the re-ranking process. Specifically, PODM-MI adopts Multidimensional Gaussian distributions based on variational inference to capture users' diversity preferences with uncertainty. Then we maximize the mutual information between the diversity preferences of the users and the candidate items using the maximum variational inference lower bound to enhance their correlations. Subsequently, we derive a utility matrix based on the correlations, enabling the adaptive ranking of items in line with user preferences and establishing a balance between the aforementioned objectives. Experimental results on real-world online e-commerce systems demonstrate the significant improvements of PODM-MI, and we have successfully deployed PODM-MI on an e-commerce search platform. | Huimu Wang, Mingming Li, Dadong Miao, Songlin Wang, Guoyu Tang, Lin Liu, Sulong Xu, Jinghe Hu | JD or JD.com; JD.com |
| 14 |  |  [Query Performance Prediction for Conversational Search and Beyond](https://doi.org/10.1145/3626772.3657658) |  | 0 | Query performance prediction (QPP) is a key task in information retrieval (IR) [1]. The QPP task is to estimate the retrieval quality of a search system for a query without human relevance judgments. In summary, I aim to solve 4 limitations identified in previous QPP studies: I have published 3 papers that address 3 of these limitations, while the remaining one is the focus of my future work. While extensively explored for traditional ad-hoc search, QPP for conversational search (CS) [4] has been little studied. I have identified limitation 1 in previous QPP studies: There is a lack of a comprehensive investigation into how well existing QPP methods designed for ad-hoc search perform in the context of CS. To fill this research gap, I have conducted a comprehensive reproducibility study [5], where I examined various QPP methods that were designed for ad-hoc search in the CS setting. I have made the code and data publicly available on https://github.com/ChuanMeng/QPP4CS. Moreover, I have identified limitation 2 in previous studies on QPP for CS: There is a lack of research in investigating and leveraging the CS-specific features that do not exist in ad-hoc search to improve QPP quality for CS. I have authored a paper to fill this research gap [3]. Specifically, my empirical analysis indicates a correlation between query rewriting quality in CS and the actual retrieval quality. Based on this finding, I have proposed a <u>p</u>er<u>pl</u>exity-based pre-retrieval QPP framework (PPL-QPP) for CS, which integrates query rewriting quality into existing QPP methods. Experimental results show that PPL-QPP improves QPP quality. Beyond the scope of QPP for CS, I have identified drawbacks in general QPP methods. Existing QPP methods typically return a single scalar value that indicates the retrieval quality, which results in two issues: (i) relying on a single value to represent different IR metrics leads to a "one size fits all" issue, and (ii) a single value constraints the interpretability of QPP. Thus, I have identified limitation 3: there is a shortage of QPP methods that are capable of effectively predicting various IR evaluation metrics while maintaining interpretability. To address the limitation, I have proposed a QPP framework using automatically <u>gen</u>erated <u>re</u>evance judgments (QPP-GenRE); it decomposes QPP into independent subtasks of judging the relevance of each item in a ranked list to a given query [6]. QPP-GenRE enables the prediction of any IR metric using generated relevance judgments as pseudo-labels, and enables the interpretation of predicted IR metrics based on generated judgments. I have fine-tuned an open-source large language model (LLM) for judging relevance. Experimental results show that QPP-GenRE achieves state-of-the-art QPP quality; my fine-tuned LLM demonstrates a high relevance judgment agreement with human assessors. I have made the code and data publicly available on https://github.com/ChuanMeng/QPP-GenRE. As part of my future work, I plan to solve limitation 4: No study has explored the application of QPP in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to predict when not to rely on low-quality retrieved items that have the potential to hurt RAG's text generation. | Chuan Meng | University of Amsterdam |
| 15 |  |  [UniSAR: Modeling User Transition Behaviors between Search and Recommendation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3626772.3657811) |  | 0 | Nowadays, many platforms provide users with both search and recommendation services as important tools for accessing information. The phenomenon has led to a correlation between user search and recommendation behaviors, providing an opportunity to model user interests in a fine-grained way. Existing approaches either model user search and recommendation behaviors separately or overlook the different transitions between user search and recommendation behaviors. In this paper, we propose a framework named UniSAR that effectively models the different types of fine-grained behavior transitions for providing users a Unified Search And Recommendation service. Specifically, UniSAR models the user transition behaviors between search and recommendation through three steps: extraction, alignment, and fusion, which are respectively implemented by transformers equipped with pre-defined masks, contrastive learning that aligns the extracted fine-grained user transitions, and cross-attentions that fuse different transitions. To provide users with a unified service, the learned representations are fed into the downstream search and recommendation models. Joint learning on both search and recommendation data is employed to utilize the knowledge and enhance each other. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of UniSAR in terms of enhancing both search and recommendation simultaneously. The experimental analysis further validates that UniSAR enhances the results by successfully modeling the user transition behaviors between search and recommendation. | Teng Shi, Zihua Si, Jun Xu, Xiao Zhang, Xiaoxue Zang, Kai Zheng, Dewei Leng, Yanan Niu, Yang Song | Renmin University of China Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence; Kuaishou Technology Co., Ltd. |
| 16 |  |  [Unbiased Learning to Rank Meets Reality: Lessons from Baidu's Large-Scale Search Dataset](https://doi.org/10.1145/3626772.3657892) |  | 0 | Unbiased learning-to-rank (ULTR) is a well-established framework for learning from user clicks, which are often biased by the ranker collecting the data. While theoretically justified and extensively tested in simulation, ULTR techniques lack empirical validation, especially on modern search engines. The dataset released for the WSDM Cup 2023, collected from Baidu's search engine, offers a rare opportunity to assess the real-world performance of prominent ULTR techniques. Despite multiple submissions during the WSDM Cup 2023 and the subsequent NTCIR ULTRE-2 task, it remains unclear whether the observed improvements stem from applying ULTR or other learning techniques. We revisit and extend the available experiments. We find that unbiased learning-to-rank techniques do not bring clear performance improvements, especially compared to the stark differences brought by the choice of ranking loss and query-document features. Our experiments reveal that ULTR robustly improves click prediction. However, these gains in click prediction do not translate to enhanced ranking performance on expert relevance annotations, implying that conclusions strongly depend on how success is measured in this benchmark. | Philipp Hager, Romain Deffayet, JeanMichel Renders, Onno Zoeter, Maarten de Rijke | Naver Labs Europe; Booking.com; University of Amsterdam |
| 17 |  |  [CMCLRec: Cross-modal Contrastive Learning for User Cold-start Sequential Recommendation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3626772.3657839) |  | 0 | Sequential recommendation models generate embeddings for items through the analysis of historical user-item interactions and utilize the acquired embeddings to predict user preferences. Despite being effective in revealing personalized preferences for users, these models heavily rely on user-item interactions. However, due to the lack of interaction information, new users face challenges when utilizing sequential recommendation models for predictions, which is recognized as the cold-start problem. Recent studies, while addressing this problem within specific structures, often neglect the compatibility with existing sequential recommendation models, making seamless integration into existing models unfeasible.To address this challenge, we propose CMCLRec, a Cross-Modal Contrastive Learning framework for user cold-start RECommendation. This approach aims to solve the user cold-start problem by customizing inputs for cold-start users that align with the requirements of sequential recommendation models in a cross-modal manner. Specifically, CMCLRec adopts cross-modal contrastive learning to construct a mapping from user features to user-item interactions based on warm user data. It then generates a simulated behavior sequence for each cold-start user in turn for recommendation purposes. In this way, CMCLRec is theoretically compatible with any extant sequential recommendation model. Comprehensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets substantiate that, compared with state-of-the-art baseline models, CMCLRec markedly enhances the performance of conventional sequential recommendation models, particularly for cold-start users. | Xiaolong Xu, Hongsheng Dong, Lianyong Qi, Xuyun Zhang, Haolong Xiang, Xiaoyu Xia, Yanwei Xu, Wanchun Dou | RMIT University; Macquarle Unnversity; Macquarie University; Nanjing University; College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University; Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology; China University of Petroleum |
| 18 |  |  [Sequential Recommendation for Optimizing Both Immediate Feedback and Long-term Retention](https://doi.org/10.1145/3626772.3657829) |  | 0 | In the landscape of Recommender System (RS) applications, reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a powerful tool, primarily due to its proficiency in optimizing long-term rewards. Nevertheless, it suffers from instability in the learning process, stemming from the intricate interactions among bootstrapping, off-policy training, and function approximation. Moreover, in multi-reward recommendation scenarios, designing a proper reward setting that reconciles the inner dynamics of various tasks is quite intricate. In response to these challenges, we introduce DT4IER, an advanced decision transformer-based recommendation model that is engineered to not only elevate the effectiveness of recommendations but also to achieve a harmonious balance between immediate user engagement and long-term retention. The DT4IER applies an innovative multi-reward design that adeptly balances short and long-term rewards with user-specific attributes, which serve to enhance the contextual richness of the reward sequence ensuring a more informed and personalized recommendation process. To enhance its predictive capabilities, DT4IER incorporates a high-dimensional encoder, skillfully designed to identify and leverage the intricate interrelations across diverse tasks. Furthermore, we integrate a contrastive learning approach within the action embedding predictions, a strategy that significantly boosts the model's overall performance. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DT4IER against state-of-the-art Sequential Recommender Systems (SRSs) and Multi-Task Learning (MTL) models in terms of both prediction accuracy and effectiveness in specific tasks.

| 19 |  |  [Invisible Relevance Bias: Text-Image Retrieval Models Prefer AI-Generated Images](https://doi.org/10.1145/3626772.3657750) |  | 0 | With the advancement of generation models, AI-generated content (AIGC) is becoming more realistic, flooding the Internet. A recent study suggests that this phenomenon causes source bias in text retrieval for web search. Specifically, neural retrieval models tend to rank generated texts higher than human-written texts. In this paper, we extend the study of this bias to cross-modal retrieval. Firstly, we successfully construct a suitable benchmark to explore the existence of the bias. Subsequent extensive experiments on this benchmark reveal that AI-generated images introduce an invisible relevance bias to text-image retrieval models. Specifically, our experiments show that text-image retrieval models tend to rank the AI-generated images higher than the real images, even though the AI-generated images do not exhibit more visually relevant features to the query than real images. This invisible relevance bias is prevalent across retrieval models with varying training data and architectures. Furthermore, our subsequent exploration reveals that the inclusion of AI-generated images in the training data of the retrieval models exacerbates the invisible relevance bias. The above phenomenon triggers a vicious cycle, which makes the invisible relevance bias become more and more serious. To elucidate the potential causes of invisible relevance and address the aforementioned issues, we introduce an effective training method aimed at alleviating the invisible relevance bias. Subsequently, we apply our proposed debiasing method to retroactively identify the causes of invisible relevance, revealing that the AI-generated images induce the image encoder to embed additional information into their representation. This information exhibits a certain consistency across generated images with different semantics and can make the retriever estimate a higher relevance score. | Shicheng Xu, Danyang Hou, Liang Pang, Jingcheng Deng, Jun Xu, Huawei Shen, Xueqi Cheng | Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China; Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences |
| 20 |  |  [Fair Sequential Recommendation without User Demographics](https://doi.org/10.1145/3626772.3657703) |  | 0 | Much existing literature on fair recommendation (i.e., group fairness) leverages users' demographic attributes (e.g., gender) to develop fair recommendation methods. However, in real-world scenarios, due to privacy concerns and convenience considerations, users may not be willing to share their demographic information with the system, which limits the application of many existing methods. Moreover, sequential recommendation (SR) models achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to traditional collaborative filtering (CF) recommenders, and can represent users solely using user-item interactions (user-free). This leaves a wrong impression that SR models are free from group unfairness by design. In this work, we explore a critical question: how can we build a fair sequential recommendation system without even knowing user demographics? To address this problem, we propose Agnostic FairSeqRec (A-FSR): a model-agnostic and demographic-agnostic debiasing framework for sequential recommendation without requiring users' demographic attributes. Firstly, A-FSR reduces the correlation between the potential stereotypical patterns in the input sequences and final recommendations via Dirichlet neighbor smoothing. Secondly, A-FSR estimates an under-represented group of sequences via a gradient-based heuristic, and implicitly moves training focus towards the under-represented group by minimizing a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) based objective. Results on real-world datasets show that A-FSR achieves significant improvements on group fairness in sequential recommendation, while outperforming other state-of-the-art baselines. | Huimin Zeng, Zhankui He, Zhenrui Yue, Julian J.

| 21 |  |  [Negative Sampling Techniques for Dense Passage Retrieval in a Multilingual Setting](https://doi.org/10.1145/3626772.3657854) |  | 0 | The bi-encoder transformer architecture has become popular in open-domain retrieval, surpassing traditional sparse retrieval methods. Using hard negatives during training can improve the effectiveness of dense retrievers, and various techniques have been proposed to generate these hard negatives. We investigate the effectiveness of multiple negative sampling methods based on lexical methods (BM25), clustering, and periodically updated dense indices. We examine techniques that were introduced for finding hard negatives in a monolingual setting and reproduce them in a multilingual setting. We discover a gap amongst these techniques that we fill by proposing a novel clustered training method. Specifically, we focus on monolingual retrieval using multilingual dense retrievers across a broad set of diverse languages. We find that negative sampling based on BM25 negatives is surprisingly effective in an in-distribution setting, but this finding does not generalize to out-of-distribution and zero-shot settings, where the newly proposed method achieves the best results. We conclude with recommendations on which negative sampling methods may be the most effective given different multilingual retrieval scenarios. | Thilina Chaturanga Rajapakse, Andrew Yates, Maarten de Rijke | University of Amsterdam |
| 22 |  |  [M3oE: Multi-Domain Multi-Task Mixture-of Experts Recommendation Framework](https://doi.org/10.1145/3626772.3657686) |  | 0 | Multi-domain recommendation and multi-task recommendation have demonstrated their effectiveness in leveraging common information from different domains and objectives for comprehensive user modeling. Nonetheless, the practical recommendation usually faces multiple domains and tasks simultaneously, which cannot be well-addressed by current methods. To this end, we introduce M3oE, an adaptive multi-domain multi-task mixture-of-experts recommendation framework. M3oE integrates multi-domain information, maps knowledge across domains and tasks, and optimizes multiple objectives. We leverage three mixture-of-experts modules to learn common, domain-aspect, and task-aspect user preferences respectively to address the complex dependencies among multiple domains and tasks in a disentangled manner. Additionally, we design a two-level fusion mechanism for precise control over feature extraction and fusion across diverse domains and tasks. The framework's adaptability is further enhanced by applying AutoML technique, which allows dynamic structure optimization. To the best of the authors' knowledge, our M3oE is the first effort to solve multi-domain multi-task recommendation self-adaptively. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets against diverse baselines demonstrate M3oE's superior performance. The implementation code is available to ensure reproducibility. | Zijian Zhang, Shuchang Liu, Jiaao Yu, Qingpeng Cai, Xiangyu Zhao, Chunxu Zhang, Ziru Liu, Qidong Liu, Hongwei Zhao, Lantao Hu, Peng Jiang, Kun Gai |  |

However, they neglect the valuable information gained through negative feedback in two aspects: (1) different users might hold opposite feedback on the same item, which hampers optimal information propagation in GNNs, and (2) even when an item vastly deviates from users' preferences, they might still choose it and provide a negative rating. In this paper, we propose a negative feedback-aware recommender model (NFARec) that maximizes the leverage of negative feedback. To transfer information to multi-hop neighbors along an optimal path effectively, NFARec adopts a feedback-aware correlation that guides hypergraph convolutions (HGCs) to learn users' structural representations. Moreover, NFARec incorporates an auxiliary task - predicting the feedback sentiment polarity (i.e., positive or negative) of the next interaction - based on the Transformer Hawkes Process. The task is beneficial for understanding users by learning the sentiment expressed in their previous sequential feedback patterns and predicting future interactions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NFARec outperforms competitive baselines.

| 24 |  |  [Modeling User Fatigue for Sequential Recommendation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3626772.3657802) |  | 0 | Recommender systems filter out information that meets user interests. However, users may be tired of the recommendations that are too similar to the content they have been exposed to in a short historical period, which is the so-called user fatigue. Despite the significance for a better user experience, user fatigue is seldom explored by existing recommenders. In fact, there are three main challenges to be addressed for modeling user fatigue, including what features support it, how it influences user interests, and how its explicit signals are obtained. In this paper, we propose to model user Fatigue in interest learning for sequential Recommendations (FRec). To address the first challenge, based on a multi-interest framework, we connect the target item with historical items and construct an interest-aware similarity matrix as features to support fatigue modeling. Regarding the second challenge, built upon feature cross, we propose a fatigue-enhanced multi-interest fusion to capture long-term interest. In addition, we develop a fatigue-gated recurrent unit for short-term interest learning, with temporal fatigue representations as important inputs for constructing update and reset gates. For the last challenge, we propose a novel sequence augmentation to obtain explicit fatigue signals for contrastive learning. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets, including two public datasets and one large-scale industrial dataset. Experimental results show that FRec can improve AUC and GAUC up to 0.026 and 0.019 compared with state-of-the-art models, respectively. Moreover, large-scale online experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of FRec for fatigue reduction.

Current mainstream solutions only perform causality-based optimization in the click space since the conversion labels in the non-click space are absent. However, optimization for unclicked samples is equally essential because the non-click space contains more samples and user characteristics than the click space. To exploit the unclicked samples, we propose a Direct Dual Propensity Optimization (DDPO) framework to optimize the model directly in impression space with both clicked and unclicked samples. In this framework, we specifically design a click propensity network and a conversion propensity network. The click propensity network is dedicated to ensuring that optimization in the click space is unbiased. The conversion propensity network is designed to generate pseudo-conversion labels for unclicked samples, thus overcoming the challenge of absent labels in non-click space. With these two propensity networks, we are able to perform causality-based optimization in both click space and non-click space. In addition, to strengthen the causal relationship, we design two causal transfer modules for the conversion rate prediction model with the attention mechanism. The proposed framework is evaluated on five real-world public datasets and one private Tencent advertising dataset. Experimental results verify that our method is able to improve the prediction performance significantly. For instance, our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 7.0% in terms of the Area Under the Curve on the Ali-CCP dataset. | Hongzu Su, Lichao Meng, Lei Zhu, Ke Lu, Jingjing Li | Tongji University; University of Electronic Science and Technology of China |
| 26 |  |  [A Generic Behavior-Aware Data Augmentation Framework for Sequential Recommendation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3626772.3657682) |  | 0 | Multi-behavior sequential recommendation (MBSR), which models multi-behavior sequentiality and heterogeneity to better learn users' multifaceted intentions has achieved remarkable success. Though effective, the performance of these approaches may be limited due to the sparsity inherent in a real-world data. Existing data augmentation methods in recommender systems focus solely on a single type of behavior, overlooking the variations in expressing user preferences via different types of behaviors. During the augmentation of samples, it is easy to introduce excessive disturbance or noise, which may mislead the next-item recommendation. To address this limitation, we propose a novel generic framework called multi-behavior data augmentation for sequential recommendation (MBASR). Specifically, we design three behavior-aware data augmentation operations to construct rich training samples. Each augmentation operation takes into account the correlations between behaviors and aligns with the users' behavior patterns. In addition, we introduce a position-based sampling strategy that can effectively reduce the perturbation brought by the augmentation operations to the original data. Note that our model is data-oriented and can thus be embedded in different downstream MBSR models, so the overall framework is generic. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our MBASR and its applicability to a wide variety of mainstream MBSR models.

The attribute-opinion pairs, expressed by users in their reviews for items, provide the potentials to capture user preferences and item characteristics at a fine-grained level. To this end, we propose a novel framework FineRec that explores the attribute-opinion pairs of reviews to finely handle sequential recommendation. Specifically, we utilize a large language model to extract attribute-opinion pairs from reviews. For each attribute, a unique attribute-specific user-opinion-item graph is created, where corresponding opinions serve as the edges linking heterogeneous user and item nodes. Afterwards, we devise a diversity-aware convolution operation to aggregate information within the graphs, enabling attribute-specific user and item representation learning. Ultimately, we present an interaction-driven fusion mechanism to integrate attribute-specific user/item representations across all attributes for generating recommendations. Extensive experiments conducted on several real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our FineRec over existing state-ofthe-art methods. Further analysis also verifies the effectiveness of our fine-grained manner in handling the task. | Xiaokun Zhang, Bo Xu, Youlin Wu, Yuan Zhong, Hongfei Lin, Fenglong Ma | Pennsylvania State University; Dalian University of Technology |

While both leverage knowledge (e.g., gradients) sharing to facilitate learning local models, FedRecs rely on a central server to coordinate the optimization process, yet in DecRecs, the knowledge sharing directly happens between clients. Knowledge sharing also opens a backdoor for model poisoning attacks, where adversaries disguise themselves as benign clients and disseminate polluted knowledge to achieve malicious goals like promoting an item's exposure rate. Although research on such poisoning attacks provides valuable insights into finding security loopholes and corresponding countermeasures, existing attacks mostly focus on FedRecs, and are either inapplicable or ineffective for DecRecs. Compared with FedRecs where the tampered information can be universally distributed to all clients once uploaded to the cloud, each adversary in DecRecs can only communicate with neighbor clients of a small size, confining its impact to a limited range. To fill the gap, we present a novel attack method named Poisoning with Adaptive Malicious Neighbors (PAMN). With item promotion in top-K recommendation as the attack objective, PAMN effectively boosts target items' ranks with several adversaries that emulate benign clients and transfers adaptively crafted gradients conditioned on each adversary's neighbors. Moreover, with the vulnerabilities of DecRecs uncovered, a dedicated defensive mechanism based on user-level gradient clipping with sparsified updating is proposed. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the poisoning attack and the robustness of our defensive mechanism. | Ruiqi Zheng, Liang Qu, Tong Chen, Kai Zheng, Yuhui Shi, Hongzhi Yin | Southern University of Science and Technology; The University of Queensland; The University of Queensland School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science; University of Electronic Science and Technology of China |

However, vanilla VFL is only applicable to overlapped users, ignoring potential universal interest patterns hidden among non-overlapped users and suffers from limited user group benefits, which hinders its application in real-world recommenders. In this paper, we extend the traditional vertical federated recommendation problem (VFR) to a more realistic Fully-Vertical federated recommendation setting (Fully-VFR) which aims to utilize all available data and serve full user groups. To tackle challenges in implementing Fully-VFR, we propose a Retrieval-enhanced Vertical Federated recommender (ReFer), a groundbreaking initiative that explores retrieval-enhanced machine learning approaches in VFL. Specifically, we establish a general "retrieval-and-utilization" algorithm to enhance the quality of representations across all parties. We design a flexible federated retrieval augmentation (RA) mechanism for VFL: (i) Cross-RA to complement field missing and (ii) Local-RA to promote mutual understanding between user groups. We conduct extensive experiments on both public and industry datasets. Results on both sequential and non-sequential CTR prediction tasks demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance improvements over baselines and is beneficial for all user groups. | Wenjie Li, Zhongren Wang, Jinpeng Wang, Shutao Xia, Jile Zhu, Mingjian Chen, Jiangke Fan, Jia Cheng, Jun Lei | Meituan; Tsinghua University |

However, CDSR may underperform compared to the SDSR approach in certain domains due to negative transfer, which occurs when there is a lack of relation between domains or different levels of data sparsity. To address the issue of negative transfer, our proposed CDSR model estimates the degree of negative transfer of each domain and adaptively assigns it as a weight factor to the prediction loss, to control gradient flows through domains with significant negative transfer. To this end, our model compares the performance of a model trained on multiple domains (CDSR) with a model trained solely on the specific domain (SDSR) to evaluate the negative transfer of each domain using our asymmetric cooperative network. In addition, to facilitate the transfer of valuable cues between the SDSR and CDSR tasks, we developed an auxiliary loss that maximizes the mutual information between the representation pairs from both tasks on a per-domain basis. This cooperative learning between SDSR and CDSR tasks is similar to the collaborative dynamics between pacers and runners in a marathon. Our model outperformed numerous previous works in extensive experiments on two real-world industrial datasets across ten service domains. We also have deployed our model in the recommendation system of our personal assistant app service, resulting in 21.4% increase in click-through rate compared to existing models, which is valuable to real-world business1. | Chung Park, Taesan Kim, Hyungjun Yoon, Junui Hong, Yelim Yu, Mincheol Cho, Minsung Choi, Jaegul Choo | SK Telecom / KAIST; Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology; SK Telelcom / KAIST; SK Telelcom |

However, irrelevant information from the source domain may instead degrade target domain performance, which is known as the negative transfer problem. There have been some attempts to address this problem, mostly by designing adaptive representations for overlapped users. Whereas, representation adaptions solely rely on the expressive capacity of the CDR model, lacking explicit constraint to filter the irrelevant source-domain collaborative information for the target domain. In this paper, we propose a novel Collaborative information regularized User Transformation (CUT) framework to tackle the negative transfer problem by directly filtering users' collaborative information. In CUT, user similarity in the target domain is adopted as a constraint for user transformation learning to filter the user collaborative information from the source domain. CUT first learns user similarity relationships from the target domain. Then, source-target information transfer is guided by the user similarity, where we design a user transformation layer to learn target-domain user representations and a contrastive loss to supervise the user collaborative information transferred. The results show significant performance improvement of CUT compared with SOTA single and cross-domain methods. Further analysis of the target-domain results illustrates that CUT can effectively alleviate the negative transfer problem. | Hanyu Li, Weizhi Ma, Peijie Sun, Jiayu Li, Cunxiang Yin, Yancheng He, Guoqiang Xu, Min Zhang, Shaoping Ma | Tencent; Tsinghua University |
| 32 |  |  [On the Negative Perception of Cross-domain Recommendations and Explanations](https://doi.org/10.1145/3626772.3657735) |  | 0 | Recommender systems typically operate within a single domain, for example, recommending books based on users' reading habits. If such data is unavailable, it may be possible to make cross-domain recommendations and recommend books based on user preferences from another domain, such as movies. However, despite considerable research on cross-domain recommendations, no studies have investigated their impact on users' behavioural intentions or system perceptions compared to single-domain recommendations. Similarly, while single-domain explanations have been shown to improve users' perceptions of recommendations, there are no comparable studies for the cross-domain case. In this article, we present a between-subject study (N=237) of users' behavioural intentions and perceptions of book recommendations. The study was designed to disentangle the effects of whether recommendations were single- or cross-domain from whether explanations were present or not. Our results show that cross-domain recommendations have lower trust and interest than single-domain recommendations, regardless of their quality. While these negative effects can be ameliorated by cross-domain explanations, they are still perceived as inferior to single-domain recommendations without explanations. Last, we show that explanations decrease interest in the single-domain case, but increase perceived transparency and scrutability in both single- and cross-domain recommendations. Our findings offer valuable insights into the impact of recommendation provenance on user experience and could inform the future development of cross-domain recommender systems. | Denis Kotkov, Alan Medlar, Yang Liu, Dorota Glowacka | University of Helsinki |

Recent MDSR approach exploits domain-specific sequences, decoupled from mixed-domain histories, to model domain-specific sequential preference, and use mixeddomain histories to model domain-shared sequential preference. However, the approach faces challenges in accurately obtaining domain-specific sequential preferences in the target domain, especially when users only occasionally engage with it. In such cases, the history of users in the target domain is limited or not recent, leading the sequential recommender system to capture inaccurate domain-specific sequential preferences. To address this limitation, this paper introduces Multi-Domain Sequential Recommendation via Domain Space Learning (MDSR-DSL). Our approach utilizes cross-domain items to supplement missing sequential context in domain-specific sequences. It involves creating a "domain space" to maintain and utilize the unique characteristics of each domain and a domain-to-domain adaptation mechanism to transform item representations across domain spaces. To validate the effectiveness of MDSR-DSL, this paper extensively compares it with state-of-the-art MD(S)R methods and provides detailed analyses. | Junyoung Hwang, Hyunjun Ju, SeongKu Kang, Sanghwan Jang, Hwanjo Yu | University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; 42dot; Pohang University of Science and Technology |

However, the application of LLMs to CRS has exposed a notable discrepancy in behavior between LLM-based CRS and human recommenders: LLMs often appear inflexible and passive, frequently rushing to complete the recommendation task without sufficient inquiry.This behavior discrepancy can lead to decreased accuracy in recommendations and lower user satisfaction. Despite its importance, existing studies in CRS lack a study about how to measure such behavior discrepancy. To fill this gap, we propose Behavior Alignment, a new evaluation metric to measure how well the recommendation strategies made by a LLM-based CRS are consistent with human recommenders'. Our experiment results show that the new metric is better aligned with human preferences and can better differentiate how systems perform than existing evaluation metrics. As Behavior Alignment requires explicit and costly human annotations on the recommendation strategies, we also propose a classification-based method to implicitly measure the Behavior Alignment based on the responses. The evaluation results confirm the robustness of the method. | Dayu Yang, Fumian Chen, Hui Fang | University of Delaware |

Such ranking models are typically trained to satisfy the single objective of providing relevant information to the users. However, not all information should be made available. For example, documents containing sensitive information, such as personal or confidential information, should not be returned in the search results. Sensitivity-aware search (SAS) aims to develop retrieval models that can satisfy two objectives, namely: (1) providing the user with relevant search results, while (2) ensuring that no documents that contain sensitive information are included in the ranking. In this work, we propose three novel negative sampling strategies that enable cross-encoders to be trained to satisfy the bi-objective task of SAS. Additionally, we investigate and compare with filtering sensitive documents in ranking pipelines. Our experiments on a collection labelled for sensitivity show that our proposed negative sampling strategies lead to a ~37% increase in terms of cost-sensitive nDCG (nCSDCG) for SAS. | Jack McKechnie, Graham McDonald, Craig Macdonald | University of Glasgow |

The task is challenging due to the detailed information needed to determine whether a document is novelty-destroying or simply closely related, resulting in the original search results not always being fully on target. Allowing the user to provide feedback on the relevance of the initial search results and iterating on the search may thus improve the results significantly. We present a relevance feedback method based on computing the affine vector subspace spanned by the relevant document vectors. The method can be used with any dense retrieval system, and we demonstrate its effectiveness in improving recall in prior art searches. We compare the subspace-based method to the Rocchio algorithm and show that the method is less sensitive to changes in hyperparameters when the number of relevant documents increases. | Sebastian Björkqvist | IPRally Technologies Oy |

That is so because they are effective models of relevance and are interpretable by design. Despite their apparent compatibility with inverted indexes, however, retrieval over sparse embeddings remains challenging. That is due to the distributional differences between learned embeddings and term frequency-based lexical models of relevance such as BM25. Recognizing this challenge, a great deal of research has gone into, among other things, designing retrieval algorithms tailored to the properties of learned sparse representations, including approximate retrieval systems. In fact, this task featured prominently in the latest BigANN Challenge at NeurIPS 2023, where approximate algorithms were evaluated on a large benchmark dataset by throughput and recall. In this work, we propose a novel organization of the inverted index that enables fast yet effective approximate retrieval over learned sparse embeddings. Our approach organizes inverted lists into geometrically-cohesive blocks, each equipped with a summary vector. During query processing, we quickly determine if a block must be evaluated using the summaries. As we show experimentally, single-threaded query processing using our method, Seismic, reaches sub-millisecond per-query latency on various sparse embeddings of the MS MARCO dataset while maintaining high recall. Our results indicate that Seismic is one to two orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art inverted index-based solutions and further outperforms the winning (graph-based) submissions to the BigANN Challenge by a significant margin. | Sebastian Bruch, Franco Maria Nardini, Cosimo Rulli, Rossano Venturini | Dipartimento di Informatica, Università di Pisa; ISTI-CNR; Pinecone |

The Role of Fairness and Relevance](https://doi.org/10.1145/3626772.3657832) |  | 0 | Relevance and fairness are two major objectives of recommender systems (RSs). Recent work proposes measures of RS fairness that are either independent from relevance (fairness-only) or conditioned on relevance (joint measures). While fairness-only measures have been studied extensively, we look into whether joint measures can be trusted. We collect all joint evaluation measures of RS relevance and fairness, and ask: How much do they agree with each other? To what extent do they agree with relevance/fairness measures? How sensitive are they to changes in rank position, or to increasingly fair and relevant recommendations? We empirically study for the first time the behaviour of these measures across 4 real-world datasets and 4 recommenders. We find that most of these measures: i) correlate weakly with one another and even contradict each other at times; ii) are less sensitive to rank position changes than relevance- and fairness-only measures, meaning that they are less granular than traditional RS measures; and iii) tend to compress scores at the low end of their range, meaning that they are not very expressive. We counter the above limitations with a set of guidelines on the appropriate usage of such measures, i.e., they should be used with caution due to their tendency to contradict each other and of having a very small empirical range. | Theresia Veronika Rampisela, Tuukka Ruotsalo, Maria Maistro, Christina Lioma | University of Copenhagen |
| 39 |  |  [Sequential Recommendation with Latent Relations based on Large Language Model](https://doi.org/10.1145/3626772.3657762) |  | 0 | Sequential recommender systems predict items that may interest users by modeling their preferences based on historical interactions. Traditional sequential recommendation methods rely on capturing implicit collaborative filtering signals among items. Recent relation-aware sequential recommendation models have achieved promising performance by explicitly incorporating item relations into the modeling of user historical sequences, where most relations are extracted from knowledge graphs. However, existing methods rely on manually predefined relations and suffer the sparsity issue, limiting the generalization ability in diverse scenarios with varied item relations. In this paper, we propose a novel relation-aware sequential recommendation framework with Latent Relation Discovery (LRD). Different from previous relation-aware models that rely on predefined rules, we propose to leverage the Large Language Model (LLM) to provide new types of relations and connections between items. The motivation is that LLM contains abundant world knowledge, which can be adopted to mine latent relations of items for recommendation. Specifically, inspired by that humans can describe relations between items using natural language, LRD harnesses the LLM that has demonstrated human-like knowledge to obtain language knowledge representations of items. These representations are fed into a latent relation discovery module based on the discrete state variational autoencoder (DVAE). Then the self-supervised relation discovery tasks and recommendation tasks are jointly optimized. Experimental results on multiple public datasets demonstrate our proposed latent relations discovery method can be incorporated with existing relation-aware sequential recommendation models and significantly improve the performance. Further analysis experiments indicate the effectiveness and reliability of the discovered latent relations. | Shenghao Yang, Weizhi Ma, Peijie Sun, Qingyao Ai, Yiqun Liu, Mingchen Cai, Min Zhang | Meituan; Tsinghua University |

In the context of sequential recommendation, it is essential to accurately capture the chronological patterns in user activities to generate relevant recommendations. Conventional ID-based sequential recommenders have shown promise but lack comprehensive real-world knowledge about items, limiting their effectiveness. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the potential to bridge this gap by leveraging the extensive real-world knowledge encapsulated in LLMs. However, integrating LLMs into sequential recommender systems comes with its own challenges, including inadequate representation of sequential behavior patterns and long inference latency. In this paper, we propose SeRALM (Enhancing <u>Se</u>quential <u>R</u>ecommenders with Augmented Knowledge from <u>A</u>ligned Large <u>L</u>anguage <u>M</u>odels) to address these challenges. SeRALM integrates LLMs with conventional ID-based sequential recommenders for sequential recommendation tasks. We combine text-format knowledge generated by LLMs with item IDs and feed this enriched data into ID-based recommenders, benefitting from the strengths of both paradigms. Moreover, we develop a theoretically underpinned alignment training method to refine LLMs' generation using feedback from ID-based recommenders for better knowledge augmentation. We also present an asynchronous technique to expedite the alignment training process. Experimental results on public benchmarks demonstrate that SeRALM significantly improves the performances of ID-based sequential recommenders. Further, a series of ablation studies and analyses corroborate SeRALM's proficiency in steering LLMs to generate more pertinent and advantageous knowledge across diverse scenarios. | Yankun Ren, Zhongde Chen, Xinxing Yang, Longfei Li, Cong Jiang, Lei Cheng, Bo Zhang, Linjian Mo, Jun Zhou | Ant Group |

The existing works often treat a fairness requirement, represented as a collection of sensitive attributes, as a hyper-parameter, and pursue extreme fairness by completely removing information of sensitive attributes from the learned fair embedding, which suffer from two challenges: huge training cost incurred by the explosion of attribute combinations, and the suboptimal trade-off between fairness and accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel Adaptive Fair Representation Learning (AFRL) model, which achieves a real personalized fairness due to its advantage of training only one model to adaptively serve different fairness requirements during inference phase. Particularly, AFRL treats fairness requirements as inputs and can learn an attribute-specific embedding for each attribute from the unfair user embedding, which endows AFRL with the adaptability during inference phase to determine the non-sensitive attributes under the guidance of the user's unique fairness requirement. To achieve a better trade-off between fairness and accuracy in recommendations, AFRL conducts a novel Information Alignment to exactly preserve discriminative information of non-sensitive attributes and incorporate a debiased collaborative embedding into the fair embedding to capture attribute-independent collaborative signals, without loss of fairness. Finally, the extensive experiments conducted on real datasets together with the sound theoretical analysis demonstrate the superiority of AFRL. | Xinyu Zhu, Lilin Zhang, Ning Yang | Sichuan University |

Among them, meal-course affiliation associates user-meal and user-course interactions. However, an extensive literature review demonstrates that there is a lack of publicly available meal recommendation datasets including meal-course affiliation. Meal recommendation research has been constrained in exploring the impact of cooperation between two levels of interaction on personalization and healthiness. To pave the way for meal recommendation research, we introduce a new benchmark dataset called MealRec^+. Due to constraints related to user health privacy and meal scenario characteristics, the collection of data that includes both meal-course affiliation and two levels of interactions is impeded. Therefore, a simulation method is adopted to derive meal-course affiliation and user-meal interaction from the user's dining sessions simulated based on user-course interaction data. Then, two well-known nutritional standards are used to calculate the healthiness scores of meals. Moreover, we experiment with several baseline models, including separate and cooperative interaction learning methods. Our experiment demonstrates that cooperating the two levels of interaction in appropriate ways is beneficial for meal recommendations. Furthermore, in response to the less healthy recommendation phenomenon found in the experiment, we explore methods to enhance the healthiness of meal recommendations. The dataset is available on GitHub (https://github.com/WUT-IDEA/MealRecPlus). | Ming Li, Lin Li, Xiaohui Tao, Jimmy Xiangji Huang | University of Southern Queensland; York University; Wuhan University of Technology |

While Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) is commonly used to adapt foundation models for recommendation tasks, most research prioritizes parameter efficiency, often overlooking critical factors like GPU memory efficiency and training speed. Addressing this gap, our paper introduces IISAN (Intra- and Inter-modal Side Adapted Network for Multimodal Representation), a simple plug-and-play architecture using a Decoupled PEFT structure and exploiting both intra- and inter-modal adaptation. IISAN matches the performance of full fine-tuning (FFT) and state-of-the-art PEFT. More importantly, it significantly reduces GPU memory usage - from 47GB to just 3GB for multimodal sequential recommendation tasks. Additionally, it accelerates training time per epoch from 443s to 22s compared to FFT. This is also a notable improvement over the Adapter and LoRA, which require 37-39 GB GPU memory and 350-380 seconds per epoch for training. Furthermore, we propose a new composite efficiency metric, TPME (Training-time, Parameter, and GPU Memory Efficiency) to alleviate the prevalent misconception that "parameter efficiency represents overall efficiency". TPME provides more comprehensive insights into practical efficiency comparisons between different methods. Besides, we give an accessible efficiency analysis of all PEFT and FFT approaches, which demonstrate the superiority of IISAN.

We propose the first attempt to optimize the retrieval models that deliver a limited number of personal documents to large language models for the purpose of personalized generation. We develop two optimization algorithms that solicit feedback from the downstream personalized generation tasks for retrieval optimization–one based on reinforcement learning whose reward function is defined using any arbitrary metric for personalized generation and another based on knowledge distillation from the downstream LLM to the retrieval model. This paper also introduces a pre- and post-generation retriever selection model that decides what retriever to choose for each LLM input. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks from the language model personalization (LaMP) benchmark reveal statistically significant improvements in six out of seven datasets. | Alireza Salemi, Surya Kallumadi, Hamed Zamani | Lowe's Companies, Inc.; University of Massachusetts Amherst |

With the increasing uptake of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, federated search can play a pivotal role in sourcing relevant information across heterogeneous data sources to generate informed responses. However, existing datasets, such as those developed in the past TREC FedWeb tracks, predate the RAG paradigm shift and lack representation of modern information retrieval challenges. To bridge this gap, we present FeB4RAG, a novel dataset specifically designed for federated search within RAG frameworks. This dataset, derived from 16 sub-collections of the widely used benchmarking collection, includes 790 information requests (akin to conversational queries) tailored for chatbot applications, along with top results returned by each resource and associated LLM-derived relevance judgements. Additionally, to support the need for this collection, we demonstrate the impact on response generation of a high quality federated search system for RAG compared to a naive approach to federated search. We do so by comparing answers generated through the RAG pipeline through a qualitative side-by-side comparison. Our collection fosters and supports the development and evaluation of new federated search methods, especially in the context of RAG pipelines. | Shuai Wang, Ekaterina Khramtsova, Shengyao Zhuang, Guido Zuccon | The University of Queensland School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering; CSIRO; The University of Queensland ITEE |

In this paper, we tackle two key challenges in ESC: enhancing contextually relevant and empathetic response generation through dynamic demonstration retrieval, and advancing cognitive understanding to grasp implicit mental states comprehensively. We introduce Dynamic Demonstration Retrieval and Cognitive-Aspect Situation Understanding (), a novel approach that synergizes these elements to improve the quality of support provided in ESCs. By leveraging in-context learning and persona information, we introduce an innovative retrieval mechanism that selects informative and personalized demonstration pairs. We also propose a cognitive understanding module that utilizes four cognitive relationships from the ATOMIC knowledge source to deepen situational awareness of help-seekers' mental states. Our supportive decoder integrates information from diverse knowledge sources, underpinning response generation that is both empathetic and cognitively aware. The effectiveness of is demonstrated through extensive automatic and human evaluations, revealing substantial improvements over numerous state-of-the-art models, with up to 13.79% enhancement in overall performance of ten metrics. Our codes are available for public access to facilitate further research and development. | Zhe Xu, Daoyuan Chen, Jiayi Kuang, Zihao Yi, Yaliang Li, Ying Shen | Alibaba group; Alibaba Group; Sun Yat-sen University |

Traditional methods in this field primarily focus on extracting user preferences from isolated dialogues. It often yields responses with a limited perspective, confined to the scope of individual conversations. Recognizing the potential in collective dialogue examples, our research proposes an expanded approach for CRS models, utilizing selective analogues from dialogue histories and responses to enrich both generation and recommendation processes. This introduces significant research challenges, including: (1) How to secure high-quality collections of recommendation dialogue exemplars? (2) How to effectively leverage these exemplars to enhance CRS models? To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel Demonstration-enhanced Conversational Recommender System (DCRS), which aims to strengthen its understanding on the given dialogue contexts by retrieving and learning from demonstrations. In particular, we first propose a knowledge-aware contrastive learning method that adeptly taps into the mentioned entities and the dialogue's contextual essence for pretraining the demonstration retriever. Subsequently, we further develop two adaptive demonstration-augmented prompt learning approaches, involving contextualized prompt learning and knowledge-enriched prompt learning, to bridge the gap between the retrieved demonstrations and the two end tasks of CRS, i.e., response generation and item recommendation, respectively. Rigorous evaluations on two established benchmark datasets underscore DCRS's superior performance over existing CRS methods in both item recommendation and response generation. | Huy Dao, Yang Deng, Dung D.

Existing datasets and methods are mostly evaluating reactive conversational information seeking systems that solely provide response to every query from the user. We identify a gap in building and evaluating proactive conversational information seeking systems that can monitor a multi-party human conversation and proactively engage in the conversation at an opportune moment by retrieving useful resources and suggestions. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale dataset for proactive document retrieval that consists of over 2.8 million conversations. We conduct crowdsourcing experiments to obtain high-quality and relatively complete relevance judgments through depth-k pooling. We also collect annotations related to the parts of the conversation that are related to each document, enabling us to evaluate proactive retrieval systems. We introduce normalized proactive discounted cumulative gain (npDCG) for evaluating these systems, and further provide benchmark results for a wide range of models, including a novel model we developed for this task. We believe that the developed dataset, called ProCIS, paves the path towards developing proactive conversational information seeking systems. | Chris Samarinas, Hamed Zamani | University of Massachusetts Amherst |

As one essential branch, multi-turn CRSs, built on the user simulator paradigm, have attracted great attention due to their powerful ability to accomplish recommendations without real dialogue resources. Recent multi-turn CRS models, equipped with various delicately designed components (e.g., conversation module), achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. We, for the first time, propose a comprehensive experimental evaluation for existing SOTA multi-turn CRSs to investigate three research questions: (1) reproducibility - are the designed components beneficial to target multi-turn CRSs? (2) scenario-specific adaptability - how do these components perform in various scenarios? and (3) generality - can the effective components from the target CRS be effectively transferred to other multi-turn CRSs? To answer these questions, we design and conduct experiments under different settings, including carefully selected SOTA baselines, components of CRSs, datasets, and evaluation metrics, thus providing an experimental aspect overview of multi-turn CRSs. As a result, we derive several significant insights whereby effective guidelines are provided for future multi-turn CRS model designs across diverse scenarios. | Lu Zhang, Chen Li, Yu Lei, Zhu Sun, Guanfeng Liu | Macquarie University; Yanshan University; Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore; Chengdu University of Information Technology |

Historically, RS aimed to deliver the most consistent (i.e., accurate) items to the trained user profiles. However, the attention towards additional (beyond-accuracy) quality criteria has increased tremendously in recent years. Both the research and applied models are being optimized for diversity, novelty, or fairness, to name a few. Naturally, the proper functioning of such optimization methods depends on the knowledge of users' propensities towards interacting with recommendations having certain quality criteria. However, so far, no dataset that captures such propensities exists. To bridge this research gap, we present SM-RS (single-objective + multi-objective recommendations dataset) that links users' self-declared propensity toward relevance, novelty, and diversity criteria with impressions and corresponding item selections. After presenting the dataset's collection procedure and basic statistics, we propose three tasks that are rarely available to conduct using existing RS datasets: impressions-aware click prediction, users' propensity scores prediction, and construction of recommendations proportional to the users' propensity scores. For each task, we also provide detailed evaluation procedures and competitive baselines.

Studies have shown thatpredicting users' motivation to open an app can help to improve user engagementand enhance performance in various downstream tasks. However, accuratelypredicting open-app motivation is not trivial, as it is influenced byuser-specific factors, search queries, clicked items, as well as their temporaloccurrences. Furthermore, these activities occur sequentially and exhibitintricate temporal dependencies. Inspired by the success of the Neural HawkesProcess (NHP) in modeling temporal dependencies in sequences, this paperproposes a novel neural Hawkes process model to capture the temporaldependencies between historical user browsing and querying actions. The model,referred to as Neural Hawkes Process-based Open-App Motivation prediction model(NHP-OAM), employs a hierarchical transformer and a novel intensity function toencode multiple factors, and open-app motivation prediction layer to integratetime and user-specific information for predicting users' open-app motivations.To demonstrate the superiority of our NHP-OAM model and construct a benchmarkfor the Open-App Motivation Prediction task, we not only extend the public S Rdataset ZhihuRec but also construct a new real-world Open-App MotivationDataset (OAMD). Experiments on these two datasets validate NHP-OAM'ssuperiority over baseline models. Further downstream application experimentsdemonstrate NHP-OAM's effectiveness in predicting users' Open-App Motivation,highlighting the immense application value of NHP-OAM. | Zhongxiang Sun, Zihua Si, Xiao Zhang, Xiaoxue Zang, Yang Song, Hongteng Xu, Jun Xu | Renmin University of China Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence; Renmin Unversity of China Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence; Kuaishou Technology Co., Ltd.

Some estimators (e.g., the position-based model) perform this correction by making strong assumptions about user behavior, which can lead to high bias if the assumptions are not met. Other estimators (e.g., the item-position model) rely on randomization to avoid these assumptions, but they often suffer from high variance. In this paper, we develop a new counterfactual estimator, called Interpol, that provides a tunable trade-off in the assumptions it makes, thus providing a novel ability to optimize the bias-variance trade-off. We analyze the bias of our estimator, both theoretically and empirically, and show that it achieves lower error than both the position-based model and the item-position model, on both synthetic and real datasets. This improvement in accuracy not only benefits offline evaluation of ranking policies, we also find that Interpol improves learning of new ranking policies when used as the training objective for learning-to-rank. | Alexander Buchholz, Ben London, Giuseppe Di Benedetto, Jan Malte Lichtenberg, Yannik Stein, Thorsten Joachims | Amazon Music, Seattle, WA, USA; Amazon Music, Ithaca, NY, NY, USA; Amazon Music, Berlin, Germany |

Asignificant research branch in this domain focuses on user behavior modeling.Current research predominantly centers on modeling co-occurrence relationshipsbetween the target item and items previously interacted with by users in theirhistorical data. However, this focus neglects the intricate modeling of userbehavior patterns. In reality, the abundance of user interaction recordsencompasses diverse behavior patterns, indicative of a spectrum of habitualparadigms. These patterns harbor substantial potential to significantly enhanceCTR prediction performance. To harness the informational potential within userbehavior patterns, we extend Target Attention (TA) to Target Pattern Attention(TPA) to model pattern-level dependencies. Furthermore, three criticalchallenges demand attention: the inclusion of unrelated items within behaviorpatterns, data sparsity in behavior patterns, and computational complexityarising from numerous patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce theDeep Pattern Network (DPN), designed to comprehensively leverage informationfrom user behavior patterns. DPN efficiently retrieves target-related userbehavior patterns using a target-aware attention mechanism. Additionally, itcontributes to refining user behavior patterns through a pre-training paradigmbased on self-supervised learning while promoting dependency learning withinsparse patterns. Our comprehensive experiments, conducted across three publicdatasets, substantiate the superior performance and broad compatibility of DPN. | Hengyu Zhang, Junwei Pan, Dapeng Liu, Jie Jiang, Xiu Li | Tsinghua University; Tencent; Tsinghua University |

However, these GNN-based RSinadvertently introduce excess linear correlation between user and itemembeddings, contradicting the goal of providing personalized recommendations.While existing research predominantly ascribes this flaw to the over-smoothingproblem, this paper underscores the critical, often overlooked role of theover-correlation issue in diminishing the effectiveness of GNN representationsand subsequent recommendation performance. Up to now, the over-correlationissue remains unexplored in RS. Meanwhile, how to mitigate the impact ofover-correlation while preserving collaborative filtering signals is asignificant challenge. To this end, this paper aims to address theaforementioned gap by undertaking a comprehensive study of the over-correlationissue in graph collaborative filtering models. Firstly, we present empiricalevidence to demonstrate the widespread prevalence of over-correlation in thesemodels. Subsequently, we dive into a theoretical analysis which establishes apivotal connection between the over-correlation and over-smoothing issues.Leveraging these insights, we introduce the Adaptive Feature De-correlationGraph Collaborative Filtering (AFDGCF) framework, which dynamically appliescorrelation penalties to the feature dimensions of the representation matrix,effectively alleviating both over-correlation and over-smoothing issues. Theefficacy of the proposed framework is corroborated through extensiveexperiments conducted with four representative graph collaborative filteringmodels across four publicly available datasets. | Wei Wu, Chao Wang, Dazhong Shen, Chuan Qin, Liyi Chen, Hui Xiong | HKUST Fok Ying Tung Research Institute, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou); BOSS Zhipin; Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory; The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou); University of Science and Technology of China |

The nucleus of existing GNN-based recommender systems involvesrecursive message passing along user-item interaction edges to refine encodedembeddings. Despite their demonstrated effectiveness, current GNN-based methodsencounter challenges of limited receptive fields and the presence of noisy"interest-irrelevant" connections. In contrast, Transformer-based methods excelin aggregating information adaptively and globally. Nevertheless, theirapplication to large-scale interaction graphs is hindered by inherentcomplexities and challenges in capturing intricate, entangled structuralinformation. In this paper, we propose TransGNN, a novel model that integratesTransformer and GNN layers in an alternating fashion to mutually enhance theircapabilities. Specifically, TransGNN leverages Transformer layers to broadenthe receptive field and disentangle information aggregation from edges, whichaggregates information from more relevant nodes, thereby enhancing the messagepassing of GNNs. Additionally, to capture graph structure informationeffectively, positional encoding is meticulously designed and integrated intoGNN layers to encode such structural knowledge into node attributes, thusenhancing the Transformer's performance on graphs. Efficiency considerationsare also alleviated by proposing the sampling of the most relevant nodes forthe Transformer, along with two efficient sample update strategies to reducecomplexity. Furthermore, theoretical analysis demonstrates that TransGNN offersincreased expressiveness compared to GNNs, with only a marginal increase inlinear complexity. Extensive experiments on five public datasets validate theeffectiveness and efficiency of TransGNN. | Peiyan Zhang, Yuchen Yan, Xi Zhang, Chaozhuo Li, Senzhang Wang, Feiran Huang, Sunghun Kim | Central South University; Fuzhou University Interdisciplinary Institute for Medical Engineering; Hong Kong University of Science and Technology; Microsoft Research Asia; Peking University School of Intelligence Science and Technology; Jinan University |

Meanwhile, owing to the use of an embeddingtable to represent each user/item as a distinct vector, GNN-based recommendershave inherited the long-standing defect of parameter inefficiency. As a commonpractice for scalable embeddings, parameter sharing enables the use of fewerembedding vectors (i.e., meta-embeddings). When assigning meta-embeddings, mostexisting methods are a heuristically designed, predefined mapping from eachuser's/item's ID to the corresponding meta-embedding indexes, thus simplifyingthe optimization problem into learning only the meta-embeddings. However, inthe context of GNN-based collaborative filtering, such a fixed mapping omitsthe semantic correlations between entities that are evident in the user-iteminteraction graph, leading to suboptimal recommendation performance. To thisend, we propose Lightweight Embeddings for Graph Collaborative Filtering(LEGCF), a parameter-efficient embedding framework dedicated to GNN-basedrecommenders. LEGCF innovatively introduces an assignment matrix as an extralearnable component on top of meta-embeddings. To jointly optimize these twoheavily entangled components, aside from learning the meta-embeddings byminimizing the recommendation loss, LEGCF further performs efficient assignmentupdate by enforcing a novel semantic similarity constraint and finding itsclosed-form solution based on matrix pseudo-inverse. The meta-embeddings andassignment matrix are alternately updated, where the latter is sparsified onthe fly to ensure negligible storage overhead. Extensive experiments on threebenchmark datasets have verified LEGCF's smallest trade-off between size andperformance, with consistent accuracy gain over state-of-the-art baselines.

Whileholistic essay scoring research is prevalent, a noticeable gap exists inscoring essays for specific quality traits. In this work, we focus on therelevance trait, which measures the ability of the student to stay on-topicthroughout the entire essay. We propose a novel approach for graded relevancescoring of written essays that employs dense retrieval encoders. Denserepresentations of essays at different relevance levels then form clusters inthe embeddings space, such that their centroids are potentially separate enoughto effectively represent their relevance levels. We hence use the simple1-Nearest-Neighbor classification over those centroids to determine therelevance level of an unseen essay. As an effective unsupervised dense encoder,we leverage Contriever, which is pre-trained with contrastive learning anddemonstrated comparable performance to supervised dense retrieval models. Wetested our approach on both task-specific (i.e., training and testing on sametask) and cross-task (i.e., testing on unseen task) scenarios using the widelyused ASAP++ dataset. Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art performancein the task-specific scenario, while its extension for the cross-task scenarioexhibited a performance that is on par with the state-of-the-art model for thatscenario.

Selecting the appropriate dense retriever is vital for numerous IR applications that employ these retrievers, trained on public datasets, to encode or conduct searches within a new private target corpus. The effectiveness of a dense retriever can significantly diminish when applied to a target corpus that diverges in domain or task from the original training set. The problem becomes more pronounced in cases where the target corpus is unlabeled, e.g. in zero-shot scenarios, rendering direct evaluation of the model's effectiveness on the target corpus unattainable. Therefore, the unsupervised selection of an optimally pre-trained dense retriever, especially under conditions of domain shift, emerges as a critical challenge. Existing methodologies for ranking dense retrievers fall short in addressing these domain shift scenarios. To tackle this, our method capitalizes on LLMs to create pseudo-relevant queries, labels, and reference lists by analyzing a subset of documents from the target corpus. This allows for the ranking of dense retrievers based on their performance with these pseudo-relevant signals. Significantly, this strategy is the first to depend exclusively on the target corpus data, removing the necessity for training data and test labels. We assessed the effectiveness of our approach by compiling a comprehensive pool of cutting-edge dense retrievers and comparing our method against traditional dense retriever selection benchmarks. The findings reveal that our proposed solution surpasses the existing benchmarks in both the selection and ranking of dense retrievers. | Ekaterina Khramtsova, Shengyao Zhuang, Mahsa Baktashmotlagh, Guido Zuccon |  |

However, the processes and internal mechanisms along which theydetermine relevance are still largely unknown. Existing approaches foranalyzing neural ranker behavior with respect to IR properties rely either onassessing overall model behavior or employing probing methods that may offer anincomplete understanding of causal mechanisms. To provide a more granularunderstanding of internal model decision-making processes, we propose the useof causal interventions to reverse engineer neural rankers, and demonstrate howmechanistic interpretability methods can be used to isolate componentssatisfying term-frequency axioms within a ranking model. We identify a group ofattention heads that detect duplicate tokens in earlier layers of the model,then communicate with downstream heads to compute overall document relevance.More generally, we propose that this style of mechanistic analysis opens upavenues for reverse engineering the processes neural retrieval models use tocompute relevance. This work aims to initiate granular interpretability effortsthat will not only benefit retrieval model development and training, butultimately ensure safer deployment of these models. | Catherine Chen, Jack Merullo, Carsten Eickhoff | University of Tübingen; Brown University |

However, optimizing only for ranking utility can lead to representational harm and may fail to address implicit bias in relevance scores. Prior studies introduced algorithms to train stochastic ranking models, such as the Plackett-Luce ranking model, that maximize expected ranking utility while achieving fairness in expectation (ex-ante fairness). Still, every sampled ranking may not satisfy group fairness (ex-post fairness). Post-processing methods ensure ex-post fairness; however, the LTR model lacks awareness of this step, creating a mismatch between the objective function the LTR model optimizes and the one it is supposed to optimize. In this paper, we first propose a novel objective where the relevance (or the expected ranking utility) is computed over only those rankings that satisfy given representation constraints for groups of items. We call this the ex-post fair relevance. We then give a framework for training Group-Fair LTR models to maximize our proposed ranking objective. Leveraging an efficient sampler for ex-post group-fair rankings and efficient algorithms to train the Plackett-Luce LTR model, we demonstrate their use in training the Group-Fair Plackett-Luce model in our framework. Experiments on MovieLens and Kiva datasets reveal improved fairness and relevance with our group-fair Plackett-Luce model compared to post-processing. In scenarios with implicit bias, our algorithm generally outperforms existing LTR baselines in both fairness and relevance. | Sruthi Gorantla, Eshaan Bhansali, Amit Deshpande, Anand Louis | Indian Institute of Science; Indian Institute of Science Bangalore; University of Wisconsin-Madison; Microsoft |

Tailoring content to individual preferences based on historical data is the main goal of sequential recommendation. The nature of the problem, as well as the good performance observed across various domains, has motivated the use of the transformer architecture, which has proven effective in leveraging increasingly larger amounts of training data when accompanied by an increase in the number of model parameters. This scaling behavior has brought a great deal of attention, as it provides valuable guidance in the design and training of even larger models. Taking inspiration from the scaling laws observed in training large language models, we explore similar principles for sequential recommendation. Addressing scalability in this context requires special considerations as some particularities of the problem depart from the language modeling case. These particularities originate in the nature of the content catalogs, which are significantly larger than the vocabularies used for language and might change over time. In our case, we start from a well-known transformer-based model from the literature and make two crucial modifications. First, we pivot from the traditional representation of catalog items as trainable embeddings to representations computed with a trainable feature extractor, making the parameter count independent of the number of items in the catalog. Second, we propose a contrastive learning formulation that provides us with a better representation of the catalog diversity. We demonstrate that, under this setting, we can train our models effectively on increasingly larger datasets under a common experimental setup. We use the full Amazon Product Data dataset, which has only been partially explored in other studies, and reveal scaling behaviors similar to those found in language models. Compute-optimal training is possible but requires a careful analysis of the compute-performance trade-offs specific to the application. We also show that performance scaling translates to downstream tasks by fine-tuning larger pre-trained models on smaller task-specific domains. Our approach and findings provide a strategic roadmap for model training and deployment in real high-dimensional preference spaces, facilitating better training and inference efficiency. We hope this paper bridges the gap between the potential of transformers and the intrinsic complexities of high-dimensional sequential recommendation in real-world recommender systems.

To overcome thelimitations of supervision signals, recent approaches have adoptedself-supervised learning techniques in recommender systems. However, there arestill two critical challenges that remain unsolved. Firstly, existingsequential models primarily focus on long-term modeling of individualinteraction sequences, overlooking the valuable short-term collaborativerelationships among the behaviors of different users. Secondly, real-world dataoften contain noise, particularly in users' short-term behaviors, which canarise from temporary intents or misclicks. Such noise negatively impacts theaccuracy of both graph and sequence models, further complicating the modelingprocess. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework calledSelf-Supervised Graph Neural Network (SelfGNN) for sequential recommendation.The SelfGNN framework encodes short-term graphs based on time intervals andutilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn short-term collaborativerelationships.

However, due to the distributed training paradigm, FedRec is vulnerable to model poisoning attacks. In this paper, we focus on the targeted model poisoning attack against FedRec, which aims at effectively attacking the FedRec via uploading poisoned gradients to raise the exposure ratio of a multi-target item set. Previous attack methods excel with fewer target items but suffer performance decline as the amount of target items increases, which reveals two perennially neglected issues: (i) The simple promotion of prediction scores without considering intrinsic collaborations between users and items is ineffective in multi-target cases. (ii) Target items are heterogeneous, which requires discriminative attacking users and strategies for different targets. To address the issues, we propose a novel Heterogeneous Multi-target Transfer Attack framework named HMTA which consists of two stages, i.e., (1) diverse user agent generation and (2) optimal multi-target transport attack. The former stage leverages collaboration-aware manifold learning to extract latent associations among users and items, and develops a differentiable contrastive sorting to generate user agents from both difficulty and diversity scale. The latter stage conducts poisoning in a fine-grained and distinguishing way, which first completes distribution mapping from target items to generated user agents and then achieves a hybrid multi-target attack. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HMTA. | Jiajie Su, Chaochao Chen, Weiming Liu, Zibin Lin, Shuheng Shen, Weiqiang Wang, Xiaolin Zheng | Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Ant Group, Hangzhou, China |

However, the inherent openness of sequential recommender systems renders them vulnerable to poisoning attacks, where fraudsters are injected into the training data to manipulate learned patterns. Traditional defense methods predominantly depend on predefined assumptions or rules extracted from specific known attacks, limiting their generalizability to unknown attacks. To solve the above problems, considering the rich open-world knowledge encapsulated in Large Language Models (LLMs), we attempt to introduce LLMs into defense methods to broaden the knowledge beyond limited known attacks. We propose LoRec, an innovative framework that employs LLM-Enhanced Calibration to strengthen the robustness of sequential Recommender systems against poisoning attacks. LoRec integrates an LLM-enhanced CalibraTor (LCT) that refines the training process of sequential recommender systems with knowledge derived from LLMs, applying a user-wise reweighting to diminish the impact of attacks. Incorporating LLMs' open-world knowledge, the LCT effectively converts the limited, specific priors or rules into a more general pattern of fraudsters, offering improved defenses against poisons. Our comprehensive experiments validate that LoRec, as a general framework, significantly strengthens the robustness of sequential recommender systems. | Kaike Zhang, Qi Cao, Yunfan Wu, Fei Sun, Huawei Shen, Xueqi Cheng | Institute of Computing Technology, CAS |
| 66 |  |  [Treatment Effect Estimation for User Interest Exploration on Recommender Systems](https://doi.org/10.1145/3626772.3657736) |  | 0 | Recommender systems learn personalized user preferences from user feedback like clicks. However, user feedback is usually biased towards partially observed interests, leaving many users' hidden interests unexplored. Existing approaches typically mitigate the bias, increase recommendation diversity, or use bandit algorithms to balance exploration-exploitation trade-offs. Nevertheless, they fail to consider the potential rewards of recommending different categories of items and lack the global scheduling of allocating top-N recommendations to categories, leading to suboptimal exploration. In this work, we propose an Uplift model-based Recommender (UpliftRec) framework, which regards top-N recommendation as a treatment optimization problem. UpliftRec estimates the treatment effects, i.e., the click-through rate (CTR) under different category exposure ratios, by using observational user feedback. UpliftRec calculates group-level treatment effects to discover users' hidden interests with high CTR rewards and leverages inverse propensity weighting to alleviate confounder bias. Thereafter, UpliftRec adopts a dynamic programming method to calculate the optimal treatment for overall CTR maximization. We implement UpliftRec on different backend models and conduct extensive experiments on three datasets. The empirical results validate the effectiveness of UpliftRec in discovering users' hidden interests while achieving superior recommendation accuracy. | Jiaju Chen, Wenjie Wang, Chongming Gao, Peng Wu, Jianxiong Wei, Qingsong Hua | Meituan; National University of Singapore; University of Science and Technology of China; Beijing Technology and Business University |

Currently, while commonly used abstractive MDSS methodscan generate flexible and coherent summaries, the difficulty in handling globalinformation and the lack of guidance during decoding still make it challengingto generate better summaries. To alleviate these two shortcomings, this paperintroduces summary candidates into MDSS, utilizing the global information ofthe document set and additional guidance from the summary candidates to guidethe decoding process. Our insights are twofold: Firstly, summary candidates canprovide instructive information from both positive and negative perspectives,and secondly, selecting higher-quality candidates from multiple optionscontributes to producing better summaries. Drawing on the insights, we proposea summary candidates fusion framework – Disentangling Instructive informationfrom Ranked candidates (DIR) for MDSS. Specifically, DIR first uses aspecialized pairwise comparison method towards multiple candidates to pick outthose of higher quality. Then DIR disentangles the instructive information ofsummary candidates into positive and negative latent variables with ConditionalVariational Autoencoder. These variables are further incorporated into thedecoder to guide generation. We evaluate our approach with three differenttypes of Transformer-based models and three different types of candidates, andconsistently observe noticeable performance improvements according to automaticand human evaluation. More analyses further demonstrate the effectiveness ofour model in handling global information and enhancing decodingcontrollability. | Pancheng Wang, Shasha Li, Dong Li, Kehan Long, Jintao Tang, Ting Wang | National University of Defense Technology |

Most previous work focuses on using RAGfor single-round question answering, while how to adapt RAG to the complexconversational setting wherein the question is interdependent on the precedingcontext is not well studied. In this paper, we propose a conversation-level RAGapproach, which incorporates fine-grained retrieval augmentation and self-checkfor conversational question answering (CQA). In particular, our approachconsists of three components, namely conversational question refiner,fine-grained retriever and self-check based response generator, which workcollaboratively for question understanding and relevant information acquisitionin conversational settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate the greatadvantages of our approach over the state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, wealso release a Chinese CQA dataset with new features including reformulatedquestion, extracted keyword, retrieved paragraphs and their helpfulness, whichfacilitates further researches in RAG enhanced CQA. | Linhao Ye, Zhikai Lei, Jianghao Yin, Qin Chen, Jie Zhou, Liang He | East China Normal University |

A recent work of Weller et al. [44] shows thatcurrent expansion techniques benefit weaker models such as DPR and BM25 butharm stronger rankers such as MonoT5. In this paper, we re-examine thisconclusion and raise the following question: Can query expansion improvegeneralization of strong cross-encoder rankers? To answer this question, wefirst apply popular query expansion methods to state-of-the-art cross-encoderrankers and verify the deteriorated zero-shot performance. We identify twovital steps for cross-encoders in the experiment: high-quality keywordgeneration and minimal-disruptive query modification. We show that it ispossible to improve the generalization of a strong neural ranker, by promptengineering and aggregating the ranking results of each expanded query viafusion. Specifically, we first call an instruction-following language model togenerate keywords through a reasoning chain. Leveraging self-consistency andreciprocal rank weighting, we further combine the ranking results of eachexpanded query dynamically. Experiments on BEIR and TREC Deep Learning2019/2020 show that the nDCG@10 scores of both MonoT5 and RankT5 followingthese steps are improved, which points out a direction for applying queryexpansion to strong cross-encoder rankers. | Minghan Li, Honglei Zhuang, Kai Hui, Zhen Qin, Jimmy Lin, Rolf Jagerman, Xuanhui Wang, Michael Bendersky | University of Waterloo; Google Research |

First, a pre-trained model (e.g., BERT) usually truncates a long document before giving its representation, which may cause the loss of some important semantic information. Second, although pre-training models like BERT have been widely used in generating sentence embeddings, a substantial body of literature has shown that the pre-training models often represent sentence embeddings in a homogeneous and narrow space, known as the problem of representation anisotropy, which hurts the quality of dense vector retrieval. In this paper, we split the query and the document in information retrieval into two sets of natural sentences and generate their sentence embeddings with BERT, the most popular pre-trained model. Before aggregating the sentence embeddings to get the entire embedding representations of the input query and document, to alleviate the usual representation degeneration problem of sentence embeddings from BERT, we sample the variational auto-encoder's latent space distribution to obtain isotropic sentence embeddings and utilize supervised contrastive learning to uniform the distribution of these sentence embeddings in the representation space. Our proposed model undergoes training optimization for both the query and the document in the abovementioned aspects. Our model performs well in evaluating three extensively researched neural information retrieval datasets. | Xixi Zhou, Yang Gao, Xin Jie, Xiaoxu Cai, Jiajun Bu, Haishuai Wang | Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China |

The inherent sparsity of user-item interactions in a vast product space often leads to unreliable recommendations. Recent research addresses this challenge by leveraging auxiliary product relations to mitigate recommendation uncertainty, and quantifying uncertainty in recommendation scores to modify the candidates selection. However, such approaches may not be efficient due to the requirement of additional side information or providing suboptimal recommendations. To enhance sequential recommendation performance by leveraging uncertainty information, we introduce Explainable Uncertainty Attribution (ExUA). We employ gradient-based saliency attribution to identify sources of uncertainty stemming from sequential interactions. Experimental findings on Amazon and MovieLens datasets demonstrate ExUA's effectiveness in identifying interactions that induce uncertainty, resulting in a 6%+ improvement in NDCG@20 scores when the uncertainty information is integrated into a post-hoc training phase. | Carles Balsells Rodas, Fan Yang, Zhishen Huang, Yan Gao | Amazon.com Inc, Seattle, WA, USA; Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom |

Most existing methods use data from the advertising platform itself for CTR prediction. As user behaviors also exist on many other platforms, e.g., media platforms, it is beneficial to further exploit such complementary information for better modeling user interest and for improving CTR prediction performance. However, due to privacy concerns, data from different platforms cannot be uploaded to a server for centralized model training. Vertical federated learning (VFL) provides a possible solution which is able to keep the raw data on respective participating parties and learn a collaborative model in a privacy-preserving way. However, traditional VFL methods only utilize aligned data with common keys across parties, which strongly restricts their application scope. In this paper, we propose FedUD, which is able to exploit unaligned data, in addition to aligned data, for more accurate federated CTR prediction. FedUD contains two steps. In the first step, FedUD utilizes aligned data across parties like traditional VFL, but it additionally includes a knowledge distillation module. This module distills useful knowledge from the guest party's high-level representations and guides the learning of a representation transfer network. In the second step, FedUD applies the learned knowledge to enrich the representations of the host party's unaligned data such that both aligned and unaligned data can contribute to federated model training. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of FedUD for federated CTR prediction. | Wentao Ouyang, Rui Dong, Ri Tao, Xiangzheng Liu | Alibaba Group, Beijing, China |

This paper studies the generalization capabilities of existing retrieval methods with ToT queries in multiple domains. We curate a multi-domain dataset and evaluate the effectiveness of recall-oriented first-stage retrieval methods across the different domains, considering in-domain, out-of-domain, and multi-domain training settings. We further explore the use of a Large Language Model (LLM), i.e. GPT-4, for zero-shot re-ranking in various ToT domains, relying solely on the item titles. Results show that multi-domain training enhances recall, and that LLMs are strong zero-shot re-rankers, especially for popular items, outperforming direct GPT-4 prompting without first-stage retrieval.

However, these methods still suffer from missing or redundant information due to the inability to capture and effectively utilize the interrelationship between the query and the source document, as well as between the source document and its generated summary, resulting in the summary being unable to answer the query or containing additional unrequired information. To mitigate this problem, we propose an end-to-end hierarchical two-stage summarization model, that first predicts essential content, and then generates a summary by emphasizing the predicted important sentences while maintaining separate encodings for the query and the source, so that it can comprehend not only the query itself but also the essential information in the source. We evaluated the proposed model on two QFS datasets, and the results indicated its overall effectiveness and that of each component. | Ye Xiong, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Soichiro Murakami, Peinan Zhang, Hiroya Takamura, Manabu Okumura | Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan; CyberAgent, Inc., Tokyo, Japan |

As promising multi-task recommendation system models, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) and related methods use an ensemble of expert sub-networks to improve generalization and have achieved significant success in practical applications. However, they still face key challenges in efficient parameter sharing and resource utilization, especially when they are applied to real-world datasets and resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Mixture-of-Masked-Experts (MoME) to address the challenges. Unlike MoE, expert sub-networks in MoME are extracted from an identical over-parameterized base network by learning binary masks. It utilizes a binary mask learning mechanism composed of neuron-level model masking and weight-level expert masking to achieve coarse-grained base model pruning and fine-grained expert pruning, respectively. Compared to existing MoE-based models, MoME achieves efficient parameter sharing and requires significantly less sub-network storage since it actually only trains a base network and a mixture of partially overlapped binary expert masks. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of MoME in terms of recommendation accuracy and computational efficiency.

While many downstream taskshighly rely on the expressive modeling and predictive embedding of KGs, most ofthe current KG representation learning methods, where each entity is embeddedas a vector in the Euclidean space and each relation is embedded as atransformation, follow an entity ranking protocol. On one hand, such anembedding design cannot capture many-to-many relations. On the other hand, inmany retrieval cases, the users wish to get an exact set of answers without anyranking, especially when the results are expected to be precise, e.g., whichgenes cause an illness. Such scenarios are commonly referred to as "setretrieval". This work presents a pioneering study on the KG set retrievalproblem. We show that the set retrieval highly depends on expressive modelingof many-to-many relations, and propose a new KG embedding model SpherE toaddress this problem. SpherE is based on rotational embedding methods, but eachentity is embedded as a sphere instead of a vector. While inheriting the highinterpretability of rotational-based models, our SpherE can more expressivelymodel one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many relations. Through extensiveexperiments, we show that our SpherE can well address the set retrieval problemwhile still having a good predictive ability to infer missing facts.

Research has found that designing lightweightcollaborative search plugins within instant messaging platforms aligns betterwith users' collaborative habits. However, due to the complexity of multi-userinteraction scenarios, it is challenging to implement a fully functioninglightweight collaborative search system. Therefore, previous studies onlightweight collaborative search had to rely on the Wizard of Oz paradigm. Inrecent years, large language models (LLMs) have been demonstrated to interactnaturally with users and achieve complex information-seeking tasks throughLLM-based agents. Hence, to better support the research in collaborativesearch, in this demo, we propose CoSearchAgent, a lightweight collaborativesearch agent powered by LLMs. CoSearchAgent is designed as a Slack plugin thatcan support collaborative search during multi-party conversations on thisplatform. Equipped with the capacity to understand the queries and context inmulti-user conversations and the ability to search the Web for relevantinformation via APIs, CoSearchAgent can respond to user queries with answersgrounded on the relevant search results. It can also ask clarifying questionswhen the information needs are unclear. The proposed CoSearchAgent is highlyflexible and would be useful for supporting further research on collaborativesearch.

ShareChat alone receives approximately 2million pieces of fresh content daily, complicating efforts to assess quality,learn effective latent representations, and accurately match content with theappropriate user base, especially given limited user feedback. Embedding-basedapproaches are a popular choice for industrial recommender systems because theycan learn low-dimensional representations of items, leading to effectiverecommendation that can easily scale to millions of items and users.

However, modern recommender systems face the challenge of different user behavioral patterns among millions of items, making exploration more difficult. For example, users with varying activity levels require different exploration intensities. Unfortunately, previous studies often overlook this aspect and apply a uniform exploration strategy to all users, which ultimately hampers long-term user experiences. To tackle these challenges, we propose User-Oriented Exploration Policy (UOEP), a novel approach that enables fine-grained exploration among user groups. We first construct a distributional critic that allows policy optimization based on varying quantile levels of cumulative reward feedback from users, representing user groups with different activity levels. Using this critic as a guide, we design a population of distinct actors dedicated to effective and fine-grained exploration within their respective user groups. To simultaneously enhance diversity and stability during the exploration process, we also introduce a population-level diversity regularization term and a supervision module. Experimental results on public recommendation datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach, as it outperforms all other baselines in terms of long-term performance. Moreover, further analyses reveal the benefits of our approach, including improved performance for low-activity users and increased fairness among users. | Changshuo Zhang, Sirui Chen, Xiao Zhang, Sunhao Dai, Weijie Yu, Jun Xu | University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, USA; Gaoling School of AI, Renmin University of China, Beijing, China; University of International Business and Economics School of Information Technology and Management |

Without the guidance of labels, both intra-domain semantic learning and inter-domain semantic alignment pose significant challenges to the model's learning process. The resolution of these challenges relies on the accurate capture of domain-invariant semantic features by the model. Based on this consideration, we propose our Semantic-Attended Mixture of Experts (SA-MoE) model. Leveraging the proficiency of MoE network in capturing visual features, we enhance the model's focus on semantically relevant features through a series of strategies. We first utilize the self-attention mechanism of Vision Transformer to adaptively collect information with different weights on instances from different domains. In addition, we introduce contextual semantic association metrics to more accurately measure the semantic relatedness between instances. By utilizing the association metrics, secondary clustering is performed in the feature space to reinforce semantic relationships. Finally, we employ the metrics for information selection on the fused data to remove the semantic noise. We conduct extensive experiments on three widely used datasets. The consistent comparison results with existing methods indicate that our model possesses the state-of-the-art performance. | Kai Wang, Jiayang Liu, Xing Xu, Jingkuan Song, Xin Liu, Heng Tao Shen | College of Electronic and Information Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China; College of Computer Science and Technology, Huaqiao University, Xiamen, China; University of Electronic Science and Technology of China |

Traditional approaches, however, face limitations due to their presumption of a uniform number of intents across all sessions. This assumption overlooks the dynamic nature of user sessions, where the number and type of intentions can significantly vary. In addition, these methods typically operate in latent spaces, thus hinder the model's transparency.Addressing these challenges, we introduce a novel ISR approach, utilizing the advanced reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). First, this approach begins by generating an initial prompt that guides LLMs to predict the next item in a session, based on the varied intents manifested in user sessions. Then, to refine this process, we introduce an innovative prompt optimization mechanism that iteratively self-reflects and adjusts prompts. Furthermore, our prompt selection module, built upon the LLMs' broad adaptability, swiftly selects the most optimized prompts across diverse domains.

Compared to monolingual and bilingual semantic retrieval, multilingual semantic retrieval requires a stronger alignment approach to pull the contents to be retrieved close to the representation of their corresponding queries, no matter their language combinations. Traditionally, this is achieved through more supervision in the form of multilingual parallel resources, which are expensive to obtain, especially for low-resource languages. In this work, on top of an optimization-based Model-Agnostic Meta-Learner (MAML), we propose a data-efficient meta-distillation approach: MAML-Align,1 specifically for low-resource multilingual semantic retrieval. Our approach simulates a gradual feedback loop from monolingual to bilingual and from bilingual to multilingual semantic retrieval. We systematically compare multilingual meta-distillation learning to different baselines and conduct ablation studies on the role of different sampling approaches in the meta-task construction. We show that MAML-Align's gradual feedback loop boosts the generalization to different languages, including zero-shot ones, better than naive fine-tuning and vanilla MAML. | Meryem M'hamdi, Jonathan May, Franck Dernoncourt, Trung Bui, Seunghyun Yoon | Microsoft & University of Southern California, Redmond, WA, USA; Adobe Research, Seattle, WA, USA; University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA; Adobe Research, San Jose, CA, USA |

We study the case of multi-modal user interactions in a setting whereusers engage with a service provider through multiple channels (website andcall center). In such cases, incomplete modalities naturally occur, since notall users interact through all the available channels. To address thesechallenges, we publish a real-world dataset that allows progress in thisunder-researched area. We further present and benchmark various methods forleveraging multi-modal user interactions for item recommendations, and proposea novel approach that specifically deals with missing modalities by mappinguser interactions to a common feature space. Our analysis reveals importantinteractions between the different modalities and that a frequently occurringmodality can enhance learning from a less frequent one. | Simone Borg Bruun, Krisztian Balog, Maria Maistro | PhD; Tenure Track Assistant Professor; Dr. Scient. |

These methods typicallyinfer user preferences from various auxiliary behaviors and apply them to thetarget behavior for recommendations. However, this direct transfer canintroduce noise to the target behavior in recommendation, due to variations inuser attention across different behaviors. To address this issue, this paperintroduces a novel approach, Behavior-Contextualized Item Preference Modeling(BCIPM), for multi-behavior recommendation. Our proposedBehavior-Contextualized Item Preference Network discerns and learns users'specific item preferences within each behavior. It then considers only thosepreferences relevant to the target behavior for final recommendations,significantly reducing noise from auxiliary behaviors. These auxiliarybehaviors are utilized solely for training the network parameters, therebyrefining the learning process without compromising the accuracy of the targetbehavior recommendations. To further enhance the effectiveness of BCIPM, weadopt a strategy of pre-training the initial embeddings. This step is crucialfor enriching the item-aware preferences, particularly in scenarios where datarelated to the target behavior is sparse. Comprehensive experiments conductedon four real-world datasets demonstrate BCIPM's superior performance comparedto several leading state-of-the-art models, validating the robustness andefficiency of our proposed approach. | Mingshi Yan, Fan Liu, Jing Sun, Fuming Sun, Zhiyong Cheng, Yahong Han | Dalian Minzu University; Hefei University of Technology; Tianjin University; National University of Singapore |

Asthe core motivation behind user selection of items, intent is crucial forelucidating recommendation results. The current mainstream modeling method isto abstract the intent into unknowable but learnable shared or non-sharedparameters. Despite considerable progress, we argue that it still confronts thefollowing challenges: firstly, these methods only capture the coarse-grainedaspects of intent, ignoring the fact that user-item interactions will beaffected by collective and individual factors (e.g., a user may choose a moviebecause of its high box office or because of his own unique preferences);secondly, modeling believable intent is severely hampered by implicit feedback,which is incredibly sparse and devoid of true semantics. To address thesechallenges, we propose a novel recommendation framework designated as BilateralIntent-guided Graph Collaborative Filtering (BIGCF). Specifically, we take acloser look at user-item interactions from a causal perspective and put forththe concepts of individual intent-which signifies private preferences-andcollective intent-which denotes overall awareness. To counter the sparsity ofimplicit feedback, the feature distributions of users and items are encoded viaa Gaussian-based graph generation strategy, and we implement the recommendationprocess through bilateral intent-guided graph reconstruction re-sampling.Finally, we propose graph contrastive regularization for both interaction andintent spaces to uniformize users, items, intents, and interactions in aself-supervised and non-augmented paradigm. Experimental results on threereal-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of BIGCF compared withexisting solutions. | Yi Zhang, Lei Sang, Yiwen Zhang | Anhui University |

This idea, however, has not been applicable to the cold-start items, since cold nodes are isolated in the graph and thus do not take advantage of information exchange from neighboring nodes. Recently, there have been a few attempts to utilize graph convolutions on item-item or user-user attribute graphs to capture high-order collaborative signals for cold-start cases, but these approaches are still limited in that the item-item or user-user graph falls short in capturing the dynamics of user-item interactions, as their edges are constructed based on arbitrary and heuristic attribute similarity. In this paper, we introduce Content-based Graph Reconstruction for Cold-start item recommendation (CGRC), employing a masked graph autoencoder structure and multimodal contents to directly incorporate interaction-based high-order connectivity, applicable even in cold-start scenarios. To address the cold-start items directly on the interaction graph, our approach trains the model to reconstruct plausible user-item interactions from masked edges of randomly chosen cold items, simulating fresh items without connection to users. This strategy enables the model to infer potential edges for unseen cold-start nodes. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model. | Jinri Kim, Eungi Kim, Kwangeun Yeo, Yujin Jeon, Chanwoo Kim, Sewon Lee, Joonseok Lee | Seoul National Univ., Seoul, Republic of Korea |

However, it is well known that such implicit feedback reflects biases, and in particular a presentation bias that favors higher-ranked results. Unbiased Learning-to-Rank (ULTR) methods attempt to optimize performance by jointly modeling this bias along with the ranker so that the bias can be removed. Such methods have been shown to provide theoretical soundness, and promise superior performance and low deployment costs. However, existing ULTR methods don't recognize that query-document relevance is a confounder -- it affects both the likelihood of a result being clicked because of relevance and the likelihood of the result being ranked high by the base ranker. Moreover, the performance guarantees of existing ULTR methods assume the use of a weak ranker -- one that does a poor job of ranking documents based on relevance to a query. In practice, of course, commercial search engines use highly tuned rankers, and desire to improve upon them using the implicit judgments in search logs. This results in a significant correlation between position and relevance, which leads existing ULTR methods to overestimate click propensities in highly ranked results, reducing ULTR's effectiveness. This paper is the first to demonstrate the problem of propensity overestimation by ULTR algorithms, based on a causal analysis. We develop a new learning objective based on a backdoor adjustment. In addition, we introduce the Logging-Policy-aware Propensity (LPP) model that can jointly learn LPP and a more accurate ranker. We extensively test our approach on two public benchmark tasks and show that our proposal is effective, practical and significantly outperforms the state of the art. | Dan Luo, Lixin Zou, Qingyao Ai, Zhiyu Chen, Chenliang Li, Dawei Yin, Brian D.

This coarse-grained approach to re-weighting the entire user sequence hampers the model's ability to accurately model the user interest migration across different scenarios. To enhance the model's capacity to capture user interests from historical behavior sequences in each scenario, we develop a ranking framework named the Scenario-Adaptive Fine-Grained Personalization Network (SFPNet), which designs a kind of fine-grained method for multi-scenario personalized recommendations. Specifically, SFPNet comprises a series of blocks named as Scenario-Tailoring Block, stacked sequentially. Each block initially deploys a parameter personalization unit to integrate scenario information at a coarse-grained level by redefining fundamental features. Subsequently, we consolidate scenario-adaptively adjusted feature representations to serve as context information. By employing residual connection, we incorporate this context into the representation of each historical behavior, allowing for context-aware fine-grained customization of the behavior representations at the scenario-level, which in turn supports scenario-aware user interest modeling. | Moyu Zhang, Yongxiang Tang, Jinxin Hu, Yu Zhang | Unaffiliated; Lazada Group |

The core of transformer architecture liesin the self-attention mechanism, which computes the pairwise attention scoresin a sequence. Due to the permutation-equivariant nature, positional encodingis used to enhance the attention between token representations. In thissetting, the pairwise attention scores can be derived by both semanticdifference and positional difference. However, prior studies often model thetwo kinds of difference measurements in different ways, which potentiallylimits the expressive capacity of sequence modeling. To address this issue,this paper proposes a novel transformer variant with complex vector attention,named EulerFormer, which provides a unified theoretical framework to formulateboth semantic difference and positional difference. The EulerFormer involvestwo key technical improvements. First, it employs a new transformation functionfor efficiently transforming the sequence tokens into polar-form complexvectors using Euler's formula, enabling the unified modeling of both semanticand positional information in a complex rotation form.Secondly, it develops adifferential rotation mechanism, where the semantic rotation angles can becontrolled by an adaptation function, enabling the adaptive integration of thesemantic and positional information according to the semanticcontexts.Furthermore, a phase contrastive learning task is proposed to improvethe anisotropy of contextual representations in EulerFormer. Our theoreticalframework possesses a high degree of completeness and generality. It is morerobust to semantic variations and possesses moresuperior theoretical propertiesin principle. Extensive experiments conducted on four public datasetsdemonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. | Zhen Tian, Wayne Xin Zhao, Changwang Zhang, Xin Zhao, Zhongrui Ma, JiRong Wen | Huawei; Renmin University of China |

As user sequences grow longer, the current efficiency of LLMs isinadequate for training on billions of users and items. To break through theefficiency barrier of LLMs, we propose Behavior Aggregated HierarchicalEncoding (BAHE) to enhance the efficiency of LLM-based CTR modeling.Specifically, BAHE proposes a novel hierarchical architecture that decouplesthe encoding of user behaviors from inter-behavior interactions. Firstly, toprevent computational redundancy from repeated encoding of identical userbehaviors, BAHE employs the LLM's pre-trained shallow layers to extractembeddings of the most granular, atomic user behaviors from extensive usersequences and stores them in the offline database. Subsequently, the deeper,trainable layers of the LLM facilitate intricate inter-behavior interactions,thereby generating comprehensive user embeddings. This separation allows thelearning of high-level user representations to be independent of low-levelbehavior encoding, significantly reducing computational complexity. Finally,these refined user embeddings, in conjunction with correspondingly processeditem embeddings, are incorporated into the CTR model to compute the CTR scores.Extensive experimental results show that BAHE reduces training time and memoryby five times for CTR models using LLMs, especially with longer user sequences.BAHE has been deployed in a real-world system, allowing for daily updates of 50million CTR data on 8 A100 GPUs, making LLMs practical for industrial CTRprediction. | Binzong Geng, Zhaoxin Huan, Xiaolu Zhang, Yong He, Liang Zhang, Fajie Yuan, Jun Zhou, Linjian Mo | Ant Group; Westlake University |

Most existing SBR models focus ondesigning sophisticated neural-based encoders to learn a sessionrepresentation, capturing the relationship among session items. However, theytend to focus on the last item, neglecting diverse user intents that may existwithin a session. This limitation leads to significant performance drops,especially for longer sessions. To address this issue, we propose a novel SBRmodel, called Multi-intent-aware Session-based Recommendation Model (MiaSRec).It adopts frequency embedding vectors indicating the item frequency in sessionto enhance the information about repeated items. MiaSRec represents varioususer intents by deriving multiple session representations centered on each itemand dynamically selecting the important ones.

PLAID differs from ColBERT by assigning terms to clusters andrepresenting those terms as cluster centroids plus compressed residual vectors.While PLAID is effective in batch experiments, its performance degrades instreaming settings where documents arrive over time because representations ofnew tokens may be poorly modeled by the earlier tokens used to select clustercentroids. PLAID Streaming Hierarchical Indexing that Runs on Terabytes ofTemporal Text (PLAID SHIRTTT) addresses this concern using multi-phaseincremental indexing based on hierarchical sharding. Experiments on ClueWeb09and the multilingual NeuCLIR collection demonstrate the effectiveness of thisapproach both for the largest collection indexed to date by the ColBERTarchitecture and in the multilingual setting, respectively. | Dawn J.

However, current approaches, particularly those revolving around user-centric reputation scoring, raise ethical concerns associated with scoring individuals. To counter such issues, in this paper, we introduce a novel item ranking system approach that strategically transitions its emphasis from scoring users to calculating item rankings relying exclusively on items' ratings information, to achieve the same objective. Experiments on three datasets show that our approach achieves higher effectiveness and efficiency than state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, the resulting rankings are more robust to spam and resistant to bribery, contributing to a novel and ethically sound direction for item ranking systems. | Guilherme Ramos, Mirko Marras, Ludovico Boratto | University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy; Instituto de Telecomunicações, and Instituto Superior Técnico, ULisboa, Lisbon, Portugal |

Especially, streamingrecommendation systems in the industry, with only available samples of thecurrent moment, present greater challenges for time modeling. There is still alack of effective time modeling methods for streaming recommendation systems.In this paper, we propose an effective and universal method Interest Clock toperceive time information in recommendation systems. Interest Clock firstencodes users' time-aware preferences into a clock (hour-level personalizedfeatures) and then uses Gaussian distribution to smooth and aggregate them intothe final interest clock embedding according to the current time for the finalprediction. By arming base models with Interest Clock, we conduct online A/Btests, obtaining +0.509duration respectively. Besides, the extended offline experiments showimprovements as well.

To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised alignmentmethod, namely Reinforcement Learning from Contrastive Feedback (RLCF),empowering LLMs to generate both high-quality and context-specific responses.Our approach constructs unsupervised contrastive feedback signals based onsimilar document groups, and adopts a reward function, named group-wisereciprocal rank, to optimize LLMs within a standard Proximal PolicyOptimization. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness ofRLCF on LLMs built with different languages and parameter sizes on multipledownstream IR applications.

Most existing methods utilize the interaction information (e.g., ratings and clicks) or consider auxiliary information (e.g., tags and comments) to analyze the users' cross-domain preferences, but such kinds of information ignore the intrinsic semantic relationship of different domains. In order to effectively explore the inter-domain correlations, encyclopedic knowledge graphs (KG) involving different domains are highly desired in cross-domain recommendation tasks because they contain general information covering various domains with structured data format. However, there are few datasets containing KG information for CDR tasks, so in order to enrich the available data resource, we build a KG-enhanced cross-domain recommendation dataset, named Amazon-KG, based on the widely used Amazon dataset for CDR and the well-known KG DBpedia. In this work, we analyze the potential of KG applying in cross-domain recommendations, and describe the construction process of our dataset in detail. Finally, we perform quantitative statistical analysis on the dataset. We believe that datasets like Amazon-KG contribute to the development of knowledge-aware cross-domain recommender systems.

However, fewer studies have been proposed to study the inductive MKGC (IMKGC) involving emerging entities unseen during training. Existing inductive approaches focus on learning textual entity representations, which neglect rich semantic information in visual modality. Moreover, they focus on aggregating structural neighbors from existing KGs, which of emerging entities are usually limited. However, the semantic neighbors are decoupled from the topology linkage and usually imply the true target entity. In this paper, we propose the IMKGC task and a semantic neighbor retrieval-enhanced IMKGC framework CMR, where the contrast brings the helpful semantic neighbors close, and then the memorize supports semantic neighbor retrieval to enhance inference. Specifically, we first propose a unified cross-modal contrastive learning to simultaneously capture the textual-visual and textual-textual correlations of query-entity pairs in a unified representation space. The contrastive learning increases the similarity of positive query-entity pairs, therefore making the representations of helpful semantic neighbors close. Then, we explicitly memorize the knowledge representations to support the semantic neighbor retrieval. At test time, we retrieve the nearest semantic neighbors and interpolate them to the query-entity similarity distribution to augment the final prediction. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CMR on three inductive MKGC datasets.

It is widely used forinstance to analyze differences between search engines by comparing therankings of documents they retrieve for the same queries. In these situations,though, it is very frequent to find tied documents that have the same score.Unfortunately, the treatment of ties in RBO remains superficial and incomplete,in the sense that it is not clear how to calculate it from the ranking prefixesonly. In addition, the existing way of dealing with ties is very different fromthe one traditionally followed in the field of Statistics, most notably foundin rank correlation coefficients such as Kendall's and Spearman's. In thispaper we propose a generalized formulation for RBO to handle ties, thanks towhich we complete the original definitions by showing how to perform prefixevaluation. We also use it to fully develop two variants that align with theones found in the Statistics literature: one when there is a reference rankingto compare to, and one when there is not. Overall, these three variants provideresearchers with flexibility when comparing rankings with RBO, by clearlydetermining what ties mean, and how they should be treated. Finally, using bothsynthetic and TREC data, we demonstrate the use of these new tie-aware RBOmeasures. We show that the scores may differ substantially from the originaltie-unaware RBO measure, where ties had to be broken at random or by arbitrarycriteria such as by document ID. Overall, these results evidence the need for aproper account of ties in rank similarity measures such as RBO. | Matteo Corsi, Julián Urbano | Delft University of Technology; TU Delft |

A Perspective from Large-Scale Search Evaluation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3626772.3657845) |  | 0 | Information retrieval (IR) has a large literature on evaluation, dating back decades and forming a central part of the research culture. The largest proportion of this literature discusses techniques to turn a sequence of relevance labels into a single number, reflecting the system's performance: precision or cumulative gain, for example, or dozens of alternatives. Those techniques-metrics-are themselves evaluated, commonly by reference to sensitivity and validity. In our experience measuring search in industrial settings, a measurement regime needs many other qualities to be practical. For example, we must also consider how much a metric costs; how robust it is to the happenstance of sampling; whether it is debuggable; and what activities are incentivised when a metric is taken as a goal. In this perspective paper we discuss what makes a search metric successful in large-scale settings, including factors which are not often canvassed in IR research but which are important in "real-world" use. We illustrate this with examples, including from industrial settings, and offer suggestions for metrics as part of a working system. | Paul Thomas, Gabriella Kazai, Nick Craswell, Seth Spielman | Amazon, London, United Kingdom; Microsoft, Seattle, WA, USA; Microsoft, Boulder, CO, USA; Microsoft, Adelaide, Australia |

Recent workon graph neural networks (GNNs) or debiasing methods has attained remarkablegains. However, they still suffer from (1) over-smoothing node embeddingscaused by recursive convolutions with GNNs, and (2) the skewed distribution ofinteractions due to popularity and user-individual biases. This paper proposesa contextualized and debiased recommender model (CaDRec). To overcome theover-smoothing issue, we explore a novel hypergraph convolution operator thatcan select effective neighbors during convolution by introducing bothstructural context and sequential context. To tackle the skewed distribution,we propose two strategies for disentangling interactions: (1) modelingindividual biases to learn unbiased item embeddings, and (2) incorporating itempopularity with positional encoding. Moreover, we mathematically show that theimbalance of the gradients to update item embeddings exacerbates the popularitybias, thus adopting regularization and weighting schemes as solutions.Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the superiority of theCaDRec against state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Debiasing methods aim to mitigate the effect of selectionbias on the evaluation and optimization of RSs. However, existing debiasingmethods only consider single-factor forms of bias, e.g., only the item(popularity) or only the rating value (positivity). This is in stark contrastwith the real world where user selections are generally affected by multiplefactors at once. In this work, we consider multifactorial selection bias inRSs. Our focus is on selection bias affected by both item and rating valuefactors, which is a generalization and combination of popularity and positivitybias. While the concept of multifactorial bias is intuitive, it brings a severepractical challenge as it requires substantially more data for accurate biasestimation. As a solution, we propose smoothing and alternating gradientdescent techniques to reduce variance and improve the robustness of itsoptimization. Our experimental results reveal that, with our proposedtechniques, multifactorial bias corrections are more effective and robust thansingle-factor counterparts on real-world and synthetic datasets. | Jin Huang, Harrie Oosterhuis, Masoud Mansoury, Herke van Hoof, Maarten de Rijke | Radboud University; University of Amsterdam |

The existing fairness-based solutions do not specifically consider the exposure fairness of new items, for which a systematic definition also lacks, discouraging the promotion of new items or contents. In this work, we introduce a multi-degree new-item exposure fairness definition, which considers item entry-time, and also is configurable regarding different fairness requirements. We then propose a configurable new-item fairness-aware framework named CNIF, which employs two-stage training where fairness degrees are incorporated for guidance. Extensive experiments on multiple popular datasets and backbone models demonstrate that CNIF can effectively enhance fairness of the existing models regarding the exposure resources of new items (including the brand-new items with no interaction). Specifically, CNIF demonstrates a substantial advancement with a 65.59% improvement in fairness metric and a noteworthy 9.97% improvement in recommendation accuracy compared to backbone models on the KuaiRec dataset. In comparison to various fairness-based solutions, it stands out by achieving the best trade-off between fairness and recommendation accuracy, surpassing the best baseline by 14.20%. | Huizhong Guo, Dongxia Wang, Zhu Sun, Haonan Zhang, Jinfeng Li, Jie Zhang | Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore, Singapore; Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Alibaba Group, Hangzhou, China; Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China, China; Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore |

It assigns each document a unique identifier,known as DocID, and employs a generative model to directly generate therelevant DocID for the input query. A common choice for DocID is one or severalnatural language sequences, e.g. the title or n-grams, so that the pre-trainedknowledge of the generative model can be utilized. However, a sequence isgenerated token by token, where only the most likely candidates are kept andthe rest are pruned at each decoding step, thus, retrieval fails if any tokenwithin the relevant DocID is falsely pruned. What's worse, during decoding, themodel can only perceive preceding tokens in DocID while being blind tosubsequent ones, hence is prone to make such errors. To address this problem,we present a novel framework for generative retrieval, dubbed Term-SetGeneration (TSGen). Instead of sequences, we use a set of terms as DocID, whichare automatically selected to concisely summarize the document's semantics anddistinguish it from others. On top of the term-set DocID, we propose apermutation-invariant decoding algorithm, with which the term set can begenerated in any permutation yet will always lead to the correspondingdocument. Remarkably, TSGen perceives all valid terms rather than only thepreceding ones at each decoding step. Given the constant decoding space, it canmake more reliable decisions due to the broader perspective. TSGen is alsoresilient to errors: the relevant DocID will not be pruned as long as thedecoded term belongs to it. Lastly, we design an iterative optimizationprocedure to incentivize the model to generate the relevant term set in itsfavorable permutation. We conduct extensive experiments on popular benchmarks,which validate the effectiveness, the generalizability, the scalability, andthe efficiency of TSGen. | Peitian Zhang, Zheng Liu, Yujia Zhou, Zhicheng Dou, Fangchao Liu, Zhao Cao | Renmin University of China Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence; Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence NLP; Huawei Poisson Lab |

Existing studies on RRSs mainly focus on modeling the bilateral interactions between the users on both sides to capture the user preferences. However, due to the presence of exposure bias, modeling user preferences solely based on bilateral interactions often lacks precision. Additionally, in RRSs, users may exhibit varying preferences when acting in different roles, and how to effectively model users from multiple perspectives remains a substantial problem. To solve the above challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel MultI-view Reciprocal Recommender system for Online Recruitment (MIRROR). Specifically, we first propose to model the users from three different views, respectively search, active, and passive views, and we further design several Transformer-based sequential models to capture the user representation corresponding to each view. Then, we propose to divide the bilateral matching process into three stages, respectively apply, reply, and match, and a multi-stage output layer is designed based on the above multi-view modeling results. To train our MIRROR model, we first design a multi-task learning loss based on the multi-stage output results. Moreover, to bridge the semantic gap between search queries and user behaviors, we additionally design a supplementary task for next-query prediction. Finally, we conduct both offline experiments on five real-world datasets and online A/B tests, and the experiment results clearly validate the effectiveness of our MIRROR model compared with several state-of-the-art baseline methods. | Zhi Zheng, Xiao Hu, Shanshan Gao, Hengshu Zhu, Hui Xiong | BOSS Zhipin, Beijing, China; Career Science Lab, BOSS Zhipin, Beijing, China; The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou); Career Science Lab, Boss Zhipin, Beijing, China; University of Science and Technology of China |

Current MRSs overlook the large misalignment between multi-modal content features and ID embeddings. While bidirectional alignment between visual and textual modalities has been extensively studied in large multi-modal models, this study suggests that multi-modal alignment in MRSs should be in a one-way direction. A plug-and-play framework is presented, called FEedback-orienTed mulTi-modal aLignmEnt (FETTLE). FETTLE contains three novel solutions: (1) it automatically determines item-level alignment direction between each pair of modalities based on estimated user feedback; (2) it coordinates the alignment directions among multiple modalities; (3) it implements cluster-level alignment from both user and item perspectives for more stable alignments. Extensive experiments on three real datasets demonstrate that FETTLE significantly improves various backbone models. Conventional collaborative filtering models are improved by 24.79%-62.79%, and recent MRSs are improved by 5.91% - 20.11%. | Yang Li, Qi'ao Zhao, Chen Lin, Jinsong Su, Zhilin Zhang | Amazon, Seattle, Washington, USA; School of Informatics, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China; Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China |

To address thesechallenges and provide a more comprehensive understanding of user affectiveexperience and cognitive activity, we propose EEG-SVRec, the first EEG datasetwith User Multidimensional Affective Engagement Labels in Short VideoRecommendation. The study involves 30 participants and collects 3,657interactions, offering a rich dataset that can be used for a deeper explorationof user preference and cognitive activity. By incorporating selfassessmenttechniques and real-time, low-cost EEG signals, we offer a more detailedunderstanding user affective experiences (valence, arousal, immersion,interest, visual and auditory) and the cognitive mechanisms behind theirbehavior. We establish benchmarks for rating prediction by the recommendationalgorithm, showing significant improvement with the inclusion of EEG signals.Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of this dataset in gaining insightsinto the affective experience and cognitive activity behind user behaviors inrecommender systems. This work presents a novel perspective for enhancing shortvideo recommendation by leveraging the rich information contained in EEGsignals and multidimensional affective engagement scores, paving the way forfuture research in short video recommendation systems. | Shaorun Zhang, Zhiyu He, Ziyi Ye, Peijie Sun, Qingyao Ai, Min Zhang, Yiqun Liu | Tsinghua University Computer Science and Technology; Tsinghua University Department of Computer Science and Technology; Tsinghua University |

With the proliferation of digitaldevices and APPs, a huge number of new items are created rapidly over time. Howto quickly provide recommendations for new items at the inference time ischallenging. What's worse, real-world items exhibit varying degrees of modalitymissing(e.g., many short videos are uploaded without text descriptions). Thoughmany efforts have been devoted to multimedia-based recommendations, they eithercould not deal with new multimedia items or assumed the modality completenessin the modeling process. In this paper, we highlight the necessity of tackling the modality missingissue for new item recommendation. We argue that users' inherent contentpreference is stable and better kept invariant to arbitrary modality missingenvironments. Therefore, we approach this problem from a novel perspective ofinvariant learning. However, how to construct environments from finite userbehavior training data to generalize any modality missing is challenging. Totackle this issue, we propose a novel Multimodality Invariant LearningreCommendation(a.k.a. MILK) framework. Specifically, MILK first designs across-modality alignment module to keep semantic consistency from pretrainedmultimedia item features. After that, MILK designs multi-modal heterogeneousenvironments with cyclic mixup to augment training data, in order to mimic anymodality missing for invariant user preference learning. Extensive experimentson three real datasets verify the superiority of our proposed framework.

The key to essentially addressing the SS-CMR task is to solve the semantic association and modality heterogeneity problems. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised cross-modal retrieval method, namely Semi-supervised Prototype Semantic Association Learning (SPAL) for robust cross-modal retrieval. To be specific, we employ shared semantic prototypes to associate labeled and unlabeled data over both modalities to minimize intra-class and maximize inter-class variations, thereby improving discriminative representations on unlabeled data. What is more important is that we propose a novel pseudo-label guided contrastive learning to refine cross-modal representation consistency in the common space, which leverages pseudo-label semantic graph information to constrain cross-modal consistent representations. Meanwhile, multi-modal data inevitably suffers from the cost and difficulty of data collection, resulting in the incomplete multimodal data problem. Thus, to strengthen the robustness of the SS-CMR, we propose a novel prototype propagation method for incomplete data to reconstruct completion representations which preserves the semantic consistency. Extensive evaluations using several baseline methods across four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. | Junsheng Wang, Tiantian Gong, Yan Yan | Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China; Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China; Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA |

In this paper, we take the example of a typical service system, the recommender system, to investigate how to identify and tackle fairness issues within the service system. Recommender systems often exhibit bias towards a small user group, resulting in pronounced unfairness in recommendation performance, specifically the User-Oriented Fairness (UOF) issue. Existing research on UOF faces limitations in addressing two pivotal challenges: CH1: Current methods fall short in addressing the root cause of the UOF issue, stemming from an unfair training process between advantaged and disadvantaged users. CH2: Current methods struggle to unveil compelling correlations among users in sparse datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel Hypergraph Convolutional Network for User-Oriented Fairness, namely HyperUOF, to address the aforementioned challenges. HyperUOF serves as a versatile framework applicable to various backbone recommendation models for achieving UOF. To address CH1, HyperUOF employs an in-processing method that enhances the training process of disadvantaged users during model training. To addressCH2, HyperUOF incorporates a hypergraph-based approach, proven effective in sparse datasets, to explore high-order correlations among users. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets based on four backbone recommendation models to prove the effectiveness of our proposed HyperUOF. | Zhongxuan Han, Chaochao Chen, Xiaolin Zheng, Li Zhang, Yuyuan Li | Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China; Polytechnic Institute, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China |

The conventional approach for TMR is to represent the data instances as point embeddings for alignment. However, in real-world scenarios, multiple motions often co-occur and superimpose on a single avatar. Simply aggregating text and motion sequences into a single global embedding may be inadequate for capturing the intricate semantics of superimposing motions. In addition, most of the motion variations occur locally and subtly, which further presents considerable challenges in precisely aligning motion sequences with their corresponding text. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a novel Hierarchical Semantics Alignment (HSA) framework for text-to-3D human motion retrieval. Beyond global alignment, we propose the Probabilistic-based Distribution Alignment (PDA) and a Descriptors-based Fine-grained Alignment (DFA) to achieve precise semantic matching. Specifically, the PDA encodes the text and motion sequences into multidimensional probabilistic distributions, effectively capturing the semantics of superimposing motions. By optimizing the problem of probabilistic distribution alignment, PDA achieves a precise match between superimposing motions and their corresponding text. The DFA first adopts a fine-grained feature gating by selectively filtering to the significant and representative local representations and meanwhile excluding the interferences of meaningless features. Then we adaptively assign local representations from text and motion into a set of cross-modal local aggregated descriptors, enabling local comparison and interaction between fine-grained text and motion features. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmark datasets, HumanML3D and KIT-ML, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. It significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art retrieval methods, achieving Rsum improvements of 24.74% on HumanML3D and 23.08% on KIT-ML. | Yang Yang, Haoyu Shi, Huaiwen Zhang | Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot, China |

Unfortunately, current test corpora have focused mostly on needle-in-the-haystack tasks, where only a few tables are expected to exactly match the query intent. Instead, table search tasks often arise in response to the need for retrieving new datasets or augmenting existing ones, e.g., for data augmentation within data science or machine learning pipelines. Existing table repositories and benchmarks are limited in their ability to test retrieval methods for table search tasks. Thus, to close this gap, we introduce a novel dataset for query-by-example Semantic Table Search. This novel dataset consists of two snapshots of the large-scale Wikipedia tables collection from 2013 and 2019 with two important additions: (1) a page and topic aware ground truth relevance judgment and (2) a large-scale DBpedia entity linking annotation. Moreover, we generate a novel set of entity-centric queries that allows testing existing methods under a novel search scenario: semantic exploratory search. The resulting resource consists of 9,296 novel queries, 610,553 query-table relevance annotations, and 238,038 entity-linked tables from the 2013 snapshot. Similarly, on the 2019 snapshot, the resource consists of 2,560 queries, 958,214 relevance annotations, and 457,714 total tables. This makes our resource the largest annotated table-search corpus to date (97 times more queries and 956 times more annotated tables than any existing benchmark). We perform a user study among domain experts and prove that these annotators agree with the automatically generated relevance annotations. As a result, we can re-evaluate some basic assumptions behind existing table search approaches identifying their shortcomings along with promising novel research directions. | Aristotelis Leventidis, Martin Pekár Christensen, Matteo Lissandrini, Laura Di Rocco, Katja Hose, Renée J.

Existing diversified product search approaches mainly relied on datasets sourced from online platforms. However, these datasets often present challenges due to their restricted public access and the absence of manually labeled user intents. Such limitations may lead to irreproducible experimental results and unreliable conclusions, restricting the development of this field. To address these problems, this paper introduces a novel dataset JDivPS for diversified product search. To the best of our knowledge, JDivPS is the first publicly accessible dataset with human-annotated user intents. The dataset is collected from JD.com, a major Chinese e-commerce platform. It includes 10,000 queries, around 1,680,000 unique products, and an average of 10 human-labeled user intents for each query. We have extensively evaluated several diversified ranking models using the JDivPS dataset. The results of these models are recorded and presented, serving as a valuable benchmark for future research.

Within this domain, sales events, which are based on sociological mechanisms, play a significant role. E-Commerce platforms frequently offer sales and promotions to encourage users to purchase items, leading to significant changes in live environments. Learning-To-Rank (LTR) is a crucial component of E-Commerce search and recommendations, and substantial efforts have been devoted to this area. However, existing methods often assume an independent and identically distributed data setting, which does not account for the evolving distribution of online systems beyond online finetuning strategies. This limitation can lead to inaccurate predictions of user behaviors during sales events, resulting in significant loss of revenue. In addition, models must readjust themselves once sales have concluded in order to eliminate any effects caused by the sales events, leading to further regret. To address these limitations, we introduce a long-term E-Commerce search data set specifically designed to incubate LTR algorithms during such sales events, with the objective of advancing the capabilities of E-Commerce search engines. Our investigation focuses on typical industry practices and aims to identify potential solutions to address these challenges. | Jianfu Zhang, Qingtao Yu, Yizhou Chen, Guoliang Zhou, Yawen Liu, Yawei Sun, Chen Liang, Guangda Huzhang, Yabo Ni, Anxiang Zeng, Han Yu | Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China; Shopee Pte.

Despite the various public CTR datasets available due to increasing interest from both academia and industry, these datasets have limitations. They cover a limited range of scenarios and predominantly focus on ID-based features, neglecting the vital role of multi-modal features for effective multi-scenario CTR prediction. Moreover, their scale is modest compared to real-world industrial datasets, hindering robust and comprehensive evaluation of complex models. To address these challenges, we introduce a large-scale Multi-Scenario Multi-Modal CTR dataset named AntM2 C, built from real industrial data from Alipay. This dataset offers an impressive breadth and depth of information, covering CTR data from four diverse business scenarios, including advertisements, consumer coupons, mini-programs, and videos. Unlike existing datasets, AntM2 C provides not only ID-based features but also five textual features and one image feature for both users and items, supporting more delicate multi-modal CTR prediction. AntM2 C is also substantially larger than existing datasets, comprising 100 million CTR data. This scale allows for robust and comprehensive evaluation and comparison of CTR prediction models. We employ AntM2 C to construct several typical CTR tasks, including multi-scenario modeling, item and user cold-start modeling, and multi-modal modeling. Initial experiments and comparisons with baseline methods have shown that AntM2 C presents both new challenges and opportunities for CTR models, with the potential to significantly advance CTR research.

While operating on such high-dimensional spaces is effective, in this paper, we hypothesize that we can improve the retrieval performance by adequately moving to a query-dependent subspace. More in detail, we formulate the Manifold Clustering (MC) Hypothesis: projecting queries and documents onto a subspace of the original representation space can improve retrieval effectiveness. To empirically validate our hypothesis, we define a novel class of Dimension IMportance Estimators (DIME). Such models aim to determine how much each dimension of a high-dimensional representation contributes to the quality of the final ranking and provide an empirical method to select a subset of dimensions where to project the query and the documents. To support our hypothesis, we propose an oracle DIME, capable of effectively selecting dimensions and almost doubling the retrieval performance. To show the practical applicability of our approach, we then propose a set of DIMEs that do not require any oracular piece of information to estimate the importance of dimensions. These estimators allow us to carry out a dimensionality selection that enables performance improvements of up to +11.5% (moving from 0.675 to 0.752 nDCG@10) compared to the baseline methods using all dimensions. Finally, we show that, with simple and realistic active feedback, such as the user's interaction with a single relevant document, we can design a highly effective DIME, allowing us to outperform the baseline by up to +0.224 nDCG@10 points (+58.6%, moving from 0.384 to 0.608). | Guglielmo Faggioli, Nicola Ferro, Raffaele Perego, Nicola Tonellotto | University of Padova, Padova, Italy; University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy; CNR, Pisa, Italy; University of Padova, Padua, Italy |

Location-Based SocialNetwork (LBSN) data, which is often used for the next POI recommendation task,comes with challenges. One frequently disregarded challenge is how toeffectively use the abundant contextual information present in LBSN data.Previous methods are limited by their numerical nature and fail to address thischallenge. In this paper, we propose a framework that uses pretrained LargeLanguage Models (LLMs) to tackle this challenge. Our framework allows us topreserve heterogeneous LBSN data in its original format, hence avoiding theloss of contextual information. Furthermore, our framework is capable ofcomprehending the inherent meaning of contextual information due to theinclusion of commonsense knowledge. In experiments, we test our framework onthree real-world LBSN datasets. Our results show that the proposed frameworkoutperforms the state-of-the-art models in all three datasets. Our analysisdemonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework in using contextualinformation as well as alleviating the commonly encountered cold-start andshort trajectory problems. | Peibo Li, Maarten de Rijke, Hao Xue, Shuang Ao, Yang Song, Flora D.

Onetype of bias that has recently been studied in the ranking literature is whensensitive attributes, such as gender, have an impact on a user's judgment aboutan item's utility. For example, in a search for an expertise area, some usersmay be biased towards clicking on male candidates over female candidates. Wecall this type of bias group membership bias. Increasingly, we seek rankingsthat are fair to individuals and sensitive groups. Merit-based fairnessmeasures rely on the estimated utility of the items. With group membershipbias, the utility of the sensitive groups is under-estimated, hence, withoutcorrecting for this bias, a supposedly fair ranking is not truly fair. In thispaper, first, we analyze the impact of group membership bias on ranking qualityas well as merit-based fairness metrics and show that group membership bias canhurt both ranking and fairness. Then, we provide a correction method for groupbias that is based on the assumption that the utility score of items indifferent groups comes from the same distribution. This assumption has twopotential issues of sparsity and equality-instead-of-equity; we use anamortized approach to address these. We show that our correction method canconsistently compensate for the negative impact of group membership bias onranking quality and fairness metrics. | Ali Vardasbi, Maarten de Rijke, Fernando Diaz, Mostafa Dehghani | Spotify; Google DeepMind; University of Amsterdam; Carnegie Mellon University |

The Ebp models learn an individual vectorial representation for each graph and the retrieval process can be accelerated by pre-computing these representations. The Mbp models learn a neural matching function to compare graphs on a pair-by-pair basis, in which the fine-grained pairwise comparison leads to higher retrieval accuracy but severely degrades retrieval efficiency. In this paper, to combine the advantage of Ebp in retrieval efficiency with that of Mbp in retrieval accuracy, we propose a novel Graph RetrievAl framework via KNowledge Distillation, namely GRAND. The key point is to leverage the idea of knowledge distillation to transfer the fine-grained graph comparison knowledge from an Mbp model to an Ebp model, such that the Ebp model can generate better graph representations and thus yield higher retrieval accuracy. At the same time, we can still pre-compute and index the improved graph representations to retain the retrieval speed of Ebp. Towards this end, we propose to perform knowledge distillation from three perspectives: score, node, and subgraph levels. In addition, we propose to perform mutual two-way knowledge transfer between Mbp and Ebp, such that Mbp and Ebp complement and benefit each other. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that GRAND improves the performance of Ebp by a large margin and the improvement is consistent for different combinations of Ebp and Mbp models. For example, GRAND achieves performance gains of mostly more than 10% and up to 16.88% in terms of Recall@K on different datasets. | Lin Lan, Pinghui Wang, Rui Shi, Tingqing Liu, Juxiang Zeng, Feiyang Sun, Yang Ren, Jing Tao, Xiaohong Guan | MOE KLINNS Lab, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China; GaussDB, Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, Shenzhen, China; Xi'an Jiaotong University |

CS is widely used in many real-world applications, such as online recommendation and expert finding. Recently, the rise of learning-based CS methods has garnered extensive research interests, showcasing the promising potential of neural solutions. However, there remains room for optimization: (1) They initialize node features via classical methods, e.g., one-hot, random, and position encoding, which may fall short in capturing valuable community cohesiveness-related features. (2) The reliance on GCN or GCN-like models poses challenges in scaling to large graphs. (3) Existing methods do not adapt well to dynamic graphs, often requiring retraining from scratch. To handle this, we present CSFormer, a scalable CS based on Graph Transformer. First, we present a novel l-hop neighborhood community vector based on n-order h-index to represent each node's community features, generating a sequence of feature vectors by varying the neighborhood scope l. Then, we build a Transformer backbone to learn a good graph embedding that carries rich community features, based on which we perform a prediction-filtering-based online CS to efficiently return a community of q. We extend CSFormer to dynamic graphs and various community models. Extensive experiments on seven real-world graphs show our solution's superiority on effectiveness, e.g., we attain an average improvement of 20.6% in F1-score compared to the latest competitors. | Yuxiang Wang, Xiaoxuan Gou, Xiaoliang Xu, Yuxia Geng, Xiangyu Ke, Tianxing Wu, Zhiyuan Yu, Runhuai Chen, Xiangying Wu | Hangzhou Dianzi University, Zhejiang, China; Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China; Zhejiang University, Zhejiang, China; Southeast University, Jiangsu, China |

It is also widely accepted that in RecSys performance and privacy are at odds, with the increase of one resulting in the decrease of the other. Among the diverse approaches in privacy enhancing technologies (PET) for RecSys, perturbation stands out for its simplicity and computational efficiency. It involves adding noise to sensitive data, thus hiding its real value from an untrusted actor. We reproduce and test a set of four randomization-based perturbation techniques developed by Batmaz and Polat \citebatmaz2016randomization for privacy preserving collaborative filtering. While the framework presents great advantages - low computational requirements, several useful privacy-enhancing parameters - the supporting paper lacks conclusions drawn from empirical evaluation. We address this shortcoming by proposing - in absence of an implementation by the authors - our own implementation of the obfuscation framework. We then develop an evaluation framework to test the main assumption of the reference paper - that RecSys privacy and performance are competing goals.

Conventional models, typically reliant on a static training-testapproach, struggle to keep pace with these dynamic demands. Streamingrecommendation, particularly through continual graph learning, has emerged as anovel solution. However, existing methods in this area either rely onhistorical data replay, which is increasingly impractical due to stringent dataprivacy regulations; or are inability to effectively address the over-stabilityissue; or depend on model-isolation and expansion strategies. To tackle thesedifficulties, we present GPT4Rec, a Graph Prompt Tuning method for streamingRecommendation. Given the evolving user-item interaction graph, GPT4Rec firstdisentangles the graph patterns into multiple views. After isolating specificinteraction patterns and relationships in different views, GPT4Rec utilizeslightweight graph prompts to efficiently guide the model across varyinginteraction patterns within the user-item graph. Firstly, node-level promptsare employed to instruct the model to adapt to changes in the attributes orproperties of individual nodes within the graph. Secondly, structure-levelprompts guide the model in adapting to broader patterns of connectivity andrelationships within the graph. Finally, view-level prompts are innovativelydesigned to facilitate the aggregation of information from multipledisentangled views. These prompt designs allow GPT4Rec to synthesize acomprehensive understanding of the graph, ensuring that all vital aspects ofthe user-item interactions are considered and effectively integrated.Experiments on four diverse real-world datasets demonstrate the effectivenessand efficiency of our proposal. | Peiyan Zhang, Yuchen Yan, Xi Zhang, Liying Kang, Chaozhuo Li, Feiran Huang, Senzhang Wang, Sunghun Kim | Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Central South University; Fuzhou University Interdisciplinary Institute for Medical Engineering; Hong Kong University of Science and Technology; Microsoft Research Asia; Peking University School of Intelligence Science and Technology; Jinan University |

To address thischallenge, in this work we leverage instructions to flexibly describe retrievalintents and introduce I3, a unified retrieval system that performsIntent-Introspective retrieval across various tasks, conditioned onInstructions without any task-specific training. I3 innovatively incorporates apluggable introspector in a parameter-isolated manner to comprehend specificretrieval intents by jointly reasoning over the input query and instruction,and seamlessly integrates the introspected intent into the original retrievalmodel for intent-aware retrieval. Furthermore, we propose progressively-prunedintent learning. It utilizes extensive LLM-generated data to train I3phase-by-phase, embodying two key designs: progressive structure pruning anddrawback extrapolation-based data refinement. Extensive experiments show thatin the BEIR benchmark, I3 significantly outperforms baseline methods designedwith task-specific retrievers, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performancewithout any task-specific tuning. | Kaihang Pan, Juncheng Li, Wenjie Wang, Hao Fei, Hongye Song, Wei Ji, Jun Lin, Xiaozhong Liu, TatSeng Chua, Siliang Tang | DAMO Academy, Alibaba Group; Worcester Polytechnic Institute; National University of Singapore; Zhejiang University |

Modeling user behaviors involves two distinctrationales: co-occurrence patterns reflected by item IDs, and fine-grainedpreferences represented by item modalities (e.g., text and images). However,existing methods typically entangle these causes, leading to their failure inachieving accurate and explainable recommendations. To this end, we propose anovel framework DIMO to disentangle the effects of ID and modality in the task.At the item level, we introduce a co-occurrence representation schema toexplicitly incorporate cooccurrence patterns into ID representations.Simultaneously, DIMO aligns different modalities into a unified semantic spaceto represent them uniformly. At the session level, we present a multi-viewself-supervised disentanglement, including proxy mechanism and counterfactualinference, to disentangle ID and modality effects without supervised signals.Leveraging these disentangled causes, DIMO provides recommendations via causalinference and further creates two templates for generating explanations.Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate theconsistent superiority of DIMO over existing methods. Further analysis alsoconfirms DIMO's effectiveness in generating explanations. | Xiaokun Zhang, Bo Xu, Zhaochun Ren, Xiaochen Wang, Hongfei Lin, Fenglong Ma | Leiden University; Pennsylvania State University; Dalian University of Technology |

Existing methods apply Reinforcement Learning (RL)to learn planning capacity by maximizing cumulative reward for long-termrecommendation. However, the scarcity of recommendation data presentschallenges such as instability and susceptibility to overfitting when trainingRL models from scratch, resulting in sub-optimal performance. In this light, wepropose to leverage the remarkable planning capabilities over sparse data ofLarge Language Models (LLMs) for long-term recommendation. The key to achievingthe target lies in formulating a guidance plan following principles ofenhancing long-term engagement and grounding the plan to effective andexecutable actions in a personalized manner. To this end, we propose a Bi-levelLearnable LLM Planner framework, which consists of a set of LLM instances andbreaks down the learning process into macro-learning and micro-learning tolearn macro-level guidance and micro-level personalized recommendationpolicies, respectively. Extensive experiments validate that the frameworkfacilitates the planning ability of LLMs for long-term recommendation.

Most existing works rely on either representation alignment or transformation bridges, but they come with shortcomings regarding identifiability of domain-shared and domain-specific latent factors. Specifically, while CDR describes user representations as a joint distribution over two domains, these methods fail to account for its joint identifiability as they primarily fixate on the marginal distribution within a particular domain. Such a failure may overlook the conditionality between two domains and how it contributes to latent factor disentanglement, leading to negative transfer when domains are weakly correlated. In this study, we explore what should and should not be transferred in cross-domain user representations from a causality perspective. We propose a Hierarchical causal subspace disentanglement approach to explore the Joint IDentifiability of cross-domain joint distribution, termed HJID, to preserve domain-specific behaviors from domain-shared factors. HJID abides by the feature hierarchy and divides user representations into generic shallow subspace and domain-oriented deep subspaces. We first encode the generic pattern in the shallow subspace by minimizing the Maximum Mean Discrepancy of initial layer activation. Then, to dissect how domain-oriented latent factors are encoded in deeper layers activation, we construct a cross-domain causality-based data generation graph, which identifies cross-domain consistent and domain-specific components, adhering to the Minimal Change principle. This allows HJID to maintain stability whilst discovering unique factors for different domains, all within a generative framework of invertible transformations that guarantee the joint identifiability. With experiments on real-world datasets, we show that HJID outperforms SOTA methods on both strong- and weak-correlation CDR tasks. | Jing Du, Zesheng Ye, Bin Guo, Zhiwen Yu, Lina Yao | CSIRO's Data 61 & The University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia; The University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia; Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia; Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China |

It leverages user data across different domains or platforms for providing personalized recommendations. Traditional CDR assumes user preferences and behavior data can be shared freely among cloud and users, which is now impractical due to strict restrictions of data privacy. In this paper, we propose a Deployment-friendly Cloud-Device Collaboration framework for Cross-Domain Recommendation (DeCoCDR). It splits CDR into a two-stage recommendation model through cloud-device collaborations, i.e., item-recall on cloud and item re-ranking on device. This design enables effective CDR while preserving data privacy for both the cloud and the device. Extensive offline and online experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of DeCoCDR. In offline experiments, DeCoCDR outperformed the state-of-the-arts in three large datasets. While in real-world deployment, DeCoCDR improved the conversion rate by 45.3% compared with the baseline. | Yu Li, Yi Zhang, Zimu Zhou, Qiang Li | College of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University, Changchun, China; School of Data Science, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong; Algorithm team, WeSure Inc., Shenzhen, China |

Cross-domain recommendations (CDRs) alleviate this issue by transferring knowledge from data in external domains. However, most existing CDRs leverage data from only a single external domain and serve only two domains. CDRs serving multiple domains require domain-shared entities (i.e., users and items) to transfer knowledge, which significantly limits their applications due to the hardness and privacy concerns of finding such entities. We therefore focus on a more general scenario, non-overlapped multi-target CDRs (NO-MTCDRs), which require no domain-shared entities and serve multiple domains. Existing methods require domain-shared users to learn user preferences and cannot work on NO-MTCDRs. We hence propose MITrans, a novel mutual information-based (MI-based) preference disentangling and transferring framework to improve recommendations for all domains. MITrans effectively leverages knowledge from multiple domains as well as learning both domain-shared and domain-specific preferences without using domain-shared users. In MITrans, we devise two novel MI constraints to disentangle domain-shared and domain-specific preferences. Moreover, we introduce a module that fuses domain-shared preferences in different domains and combines them with domain-specific preferences to improve recommendations. Our experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of MITrans in terms of recommendation quality and application range against state-of-the-art overlapped and non-overlapped CDRs. | Zhi Li, Daichi Amagata, Yihong Zhang, Takahiro Hara, Shuichiro Haruta, Kei Yonekawa, Mori Kurokawa | Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan; KDDI Research, Inc., Fujimino, Saitama, Japan |

However, the development of legal case retrieval technologies in the Chinese legal system is restricted by three problems in existing datasets: limited data size, narrow definitions of legal relevance, and naive candidate pooling strategies used in data sampling. To alleviate these issues, we introduce LeCaRDv2, a large-scale Legal Case Retrieval Dataset (version 2). It consists of 800 queries and 55,192 candidates extracted from 4.3 million criminal case documents. To the best of our knowledge, LeCaRDv2 is one of the largest Chinese legal case retrieval datasets, providing extensive coverage of criminal charges. Additionally, we enrich the existing relevance criteria by considering three key aspects: characterization, penalty, procedure. This comprehensive criteria enriches the dataset and may provides a more holistic perspective. Furthermore, we propose a two-level candidate set pooling strategy that effectively identify potential candidates for each query case. It's important to note that all cases in the dataset have been annotated by multiple legal experts specializing in criminal law. Their expertise ensures the accuracy and reliability of the annotations. We evaluate several state-of-the-art retrieval models at LeCaRDv2, demonstrating that there is still significant room for improvement in legal case retrieval.

Existing approaches to multi-behavior recommendations typically follow one of two strategies: some derive initial node representations from individual behavior subgraphs before integrating them for a comprehensive profile, while others interpret multi-behavior data as a heterogeneous graph, applying graph neural networks to achieve a unified node representation. However, these methods do not adequately explore the intricate patterns of behavior among users and items. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel algorithm called Behavior Pattern mining-based Multi-behavior Recommendation (BPMR). Our method extensively investigates the diverse interaction patterns between users and items, utilizing these patterns as features for making recommendations. We employ a Bayesian approach to streamline the recommendation process, effectively circumventing the challenges posed by graph neural network algorithms, such as the inability to accurately capture user preferences due to over-smoothing. Our experimental evaluation on three real-world datasets demonstrates that BPMR significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms, showing an average improvement of 268.29 in NDCG@10 metrics.

This saves reviewing effort if paired with a stopping criterion, and speeds up review completion if performed alongside downstream tasks. Recent studies have shown that neural models have good potential on this task, but their time-consuming fine-tuning and inference discourage their widespread use for screening prioritisation. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach that still relies on neural models, but leverages dense representations and relevance feedback to enhance screening prioritisation, without the need for costly model fine-tuning and inference. This method exploits continuous relevance feedback from reviewers during document screening to efficiently update the dense query representation, which is then applied to rank the remaining documents to be screened. We evaluate this approach across the CLEF TAR datasets for this task. Results suggest that the investigated dense query-driven approach is more efficient than directly using neural models and shows promising effectiveness compared to previous methods developed on the considered datasets.

In recent years, dual-target CDR has been introduced to gain mutual improvements between two domains through more general bidirectional transfer rather than traditional one-way transit. Existing methods in dual-target CDR focus primarily on designing powerful encoders to learn representative cross-domain information, without tackling the fundamental issue of interaction data shortage. In this paper, we present CrossAug, a novel data augmentation approach to leverage interactions more efficiently in two domains. Specifically, we propose intra-domain and inter-domain augmentations based on cross-reconstructed representations in terms of sampled records. To reduce the harm of domain shift, we project domain-shared representations in two domains into a joint space with Householder transformations and apply center alignments. All these modules boost the utilization of interactions with little influence from negative transfer. Extensive experimental results over public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CrossAug and its components in dual-target CDR. | Qingyang Mao, Qi Liu, Zhi Li, Likang Wu, Bing Lv, Zheng Zhang | Shenzhen International Graduate School, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen, China; University of Science and Technology of China State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Intelligence;Hefei Comprehensive National Science Center Institute of Artificial Intelligence; College of Management and Economics, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China; University of Science and Technology of China State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Intelligence |

However, Translate-Distill onlysupports a single document language. Multilingual information retrieval (MLIR),which ranks a multilingual document collection, is harder to train than CLIRbecause the model must assign comparable relevance scores to documents indifferent languages. This work extends Translate-Distill and proposeMultilingual Translate-Distill (MTD) for MLIR. We show that ColBERT-X modelstrained with MTD outperform their counterparts trained ith MultilingualTranslate-Train, which is the previous state-of-the-art training approach, by5robust to the way languages are mixed in training batches.

Their probabilisticbehavior enables certain ranking qualities that are impossible withdeterministic models. For example, they can increase the diversity of displayeddocuments, increase fairness of exposure over documents, and better balanceexploitation and exploration through randomization. A core difficulty in LTR isgradient estimation, for this reason, existing stochastic LTR methods have beenlimited to differentiable ranking models (e.g., neural networks). This is instark contrast with the general field of LTR where Gradient Boosted DecisionTrees (GBDTs) have long been considered the state-of-the-art. In this work, we address this gap by introducing the first stochastic LTRmethod for GBDTs. Our main contribution is a novel estimator for thesecond-order derivatives, i.e., the Hessian matrix, which is a requirement foreffective GBDTs. To efficiently compute both the first and second-orderderivatives simultaneously, we incorporate our estimator into the existingPL-Rank framework, which was originally designed for first-order derivativesonly. Our experimental results indicate that stochastic LTR without the Hessianhas extremely poor performance, whilst the performance is competitive with thecurrent state-of-the-art with our estimated Hessian. Thus, through thecontribution of our novel Hessian estimation method, we have successfullyintroduced GBDTs to stochastic LTR. | Jingwei Kang, Maarten de Rijke, Harrie Oosterhuis | Radboud University; University of Amsterdam |

To date, existing methods either focus on capturing limited contextual information from a single cascade, overlooking the potentially complex dependencies across different cascades, or they are committed to improving model performance by using intricate technologies to extract additional features as supplements to user representations, neglecting the drift of model performance across different platforms. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework called CARE (CAscade-REtrieved In-Context Learning) inspired by the concept of in-context learning in LLMs. Specifically, CARE first constructs a prompts pool derived from historical cascades, then utilizes ranking-based search engine techniques to retrieve prompts with similar patterns based on the query. Moreover, CARE also introduces two augmentation strategies alongside social relationship enhancement to enrich the input context. Finally, the transformed query-cascade representation from a GPT-type architecture is projected to obtain the prediction. Experiments on real-world datasets from various platforms show that CARE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of effectiveness and robustness in information diffusion prediction. | Ting Zhong, Jienan Zhang, Zhangtao Cheng, Fan Zhou, Xueqin Chen | University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China; Delft University of Technology Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences; University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan, China; University of Electronic Science and Technology of China |

To achieve this, we treat all user/item nodes as independenttokens, enhance them with positional embeddings, and feed them into akernelized attention module. Additionally, we incorporate learnable relativedegree information to appropriately reweigh the attentions.

However, prior embedding-based methods are insufficient to adequately describe the dynamics of user actions and items across domains. Moreover, previous efforts frequently lacked a comprehensive investigation of the entire domain distributions. This paper proposes a novel framework entitled Wasserstein Cross-Domain Recommendation (WCDR) that captures uncertainty in Wasserstein space to address above challenges. In this framework, we abstract user/item actions as Elliptical Gaussian distributions and divide them into local-intrinsic and global-domain parts. To further model the domain diversity, we adopt shared-specific pattern for global-domain distributions and present Masked Domain-aware Sub-distribution Aggregation (MDSA) module to produce informative and diversified global-domain distributions, which incorporates attention-based aggregation method and masking strategy that alleviates negative transfer issues. Extensive experiments on two public datasets and one business dataset are conducted. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of WCDR over state-of-the-art methods. | Xianghui Zhu, Mengqun Jin, Hengyu Zhang, Chang Meng, Daoxin Zhang, Xiu Li | Xiaohongshu Inc., Shanghai, China; Shenzhen International Graduate School, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen, China |

The goal of SR models is to recommend top-K items to a user by utilizing information from past actions within a session. Many deep neural networks (DNN) based SR have been proposed in the literature, however, they experience performance declines in practice due to inherent biases (e.g., popularity bias) present in training data. To alleviate this, we propose an underlying neural-network (NN) based Structural Causal Model (SCM) which comprises an evolving user behavior (simulator) and recommendation model. The causal relations between the two sub-models and variables at consecutive timesteps are defined by a sequence of structural equations, whose parameters are learned using logged data. The learned SCM enables the simulation of a user's response on a counterfactual list of recommended items (slate). For this, we intervene on recommendation slates with counterfactual slates and simulate the user's response through learned SCM thereby generating counterfactual sessions to augment the training data. Through extensive empirical evaluation on simulated and real-world datasets, we show that the augmented data mitigates the impact of sparse training data and improves the performance of the SR models. | Muskan Gupta, Priyanka Gupta, Jyoti Narwariya, Lovekesh Vig, Gautam Shroff | TCS Research, Delhi, India |

Nonetheless, accurately simulating user searchbehaviors has long been a challenge, because users' actions in search arehighly complex and driven by intricate cognitive processes such as learning,reasoning, and planning. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) havedemonstrated remarked potential in simulating human-level intelligence and havebeen used in building autonomous agents for various tasks. However, thepotential of using LLMs in simulating search behaviors has not yet been fullyexplored. In this paper, we introduce a LLM-based user search behaviorsimulator, USimAgent. The proposed simulator can simulate users' querying,clicking, and stopping behaviors during search, and thus, is capable ofgenerating complete search sessions for specific search tasks. Empiricalinvestigation on a real user behavior dataset shows that the proposed simulatoroutperforms existing methods in query generation and is comparable totraditional methods in predicting user clicks and stopping behaviors. Theseresults not only validate the effectiveness of using LLMs for user simulationbut also shed light on the development of a more robust and generic usersimulators. | Erhan Zhang, Xingzhu Wang, Peiyuan Gong, Yankai Lin, Jiaxin Mao | Renmin University of China |

The sample space of them is merely a small subset of the entire space, making it challenging to train an efficient model. In recent years, there have been many excellent studies related to cross-domain recommendation aimed at mitigating the problem of data sparsity. However, few of them have simultaneously considered the adaptability of both sample and representation continual transfer setting to the target task. To overcome the above issue, we propose a Entire space Continual and Adaptive Transfer learning framework called ECAT which includes two core components: First, as for sample transfer, we propose a two-stage method that realizes a coarse-to-fine process. Specifically, we perform an initial selection through a graph-guided method, followed by a fine-grained selection using domain adaptation method. Second, we propose an adaptive knowledge distillation method for continually transferring the representations from a model that is well-trained on the entire space dataset. ECAT enables full utilization of the entire space samples and representations under the supervision of the target task, while avoiding negative migration.

The provision ofprecise product attribute values is fundamental in ensuring high-qualityrecommendations and enhancing customer satisfaction. The recently emergingLarge Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance innumerous attribute extraction tasks, without the need for domain-specifictraining data. Nevertheless, varying strengths and weaknesses are exhibited bydifferent LLMs due to the diversity in data, architectures, andhyperparameters. This variation makes them complementary to each other, with nosingle LLM dominating all others. Considering the diverse strengths andweaknesses of LLMs, it becomes necessary to develop an ensemble method thatleverages their complementary potentials. In this paper, we propose a novelalgorithm called LLM-ensemble to ensemble different LLMs' outputs for attributevalue extraction. We iteratively learn the weights for different LLMs toaggregate the labels with weights to predict the final attribute value. Notonly can our proposed method be proven theoretically optimal, but it alsoensures efficient computation, fast convergence, and safe deployment. We havealso conducted extensive experiments with various state-of-the-art LLMs,including Llama2-13B, Llama2-70B, PaLM-2, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4, on Walmart'sinternal data.

This "gold standard'' comes at a high cost, however, in terms of cycle time, user cost, and potential user retention. In developing policies for onboarding users, these costs can be especially problematic, since on-boarding occurs only once. In this work, we describe a simulation methodology used to augment (and reduce) the use of live experiments. We illustrate its deployment for the evaluation of preference elicitation algorithms used to onboard new users of the YouTube Music platform. By developing counterfactually robust user behavior models, and a simulation service that couples such models with production infrastructure, we can test new algorithms in a way that reliably predicts their performance on key metrics when deployed live. | ChihWei Hsu, Martin Mladenov, Ofer Meshi, James Pine, Hubert Pham, Shane Li, Xujian Liang, Anton Polishko, Li Yang, Ben Scheetz, Craig Boutilier | YouTube, New York, NY, USA; Google Research, Mountain View, CA, USA; Google, Mountain View, CA, USA |

Our solution meets practical needs of data security and privacy, scalability, cost-effectiveness, backward compatibility with existing indexes and search infrastructure, and interpretability of outputs for patients. It uses a concept-rich ontology to model raw data from multiple sources as entities, relations, and attributes in a knowledge graph that is stored and indexed in an industry-scale graph database. We evaluate the solution on a real patient-query log and demonstrate its practical utility. The system has been implemented and deployed live to KP customers. | Mayank Kejriwal, Hamid Haidarian, MinHsueh Chiu, Andy Xiang, Deep Shrestha, Faizan Javed | University of Southern California, Marina Del Rey, CA, USA; Kaiser Permanente Digital, Oakland, CA, USA; University of Southern California, Marina del Rey, CA, USA |

The current review process is manual and time-consuming, requiring a clinical trial analyst to manually search through an extensive clinical trial database and then review all candidate studies. Therefore, it is of great interest to develop an automatic retrieval algorithm to select similar studies by giving new study information. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel group-based trial similarity learning network named GTSLNet, consisting of two kinds of similarity learning modules. The pair-wise section-level similarity learning module aims to compare the query trial and the candidate trial from the abstract semantic level via the proposed section transformer. Meanwhile, a word-level similarity learning module uses the word similarly matrix to capture the low-level similarity information. Additionally, an aggregation module combines these similarities. To address potential false negatives and noisy data, we introduce a variance-regularized group distance loss function. Experiment results show that the proposed GTSLNet significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. | Junyu Luo, Cheng Qian, Lucas Glass, Fenglong Ma | The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, USA; IQVIA, Philadelphia, PA, USA; IQVIA, Chicago, USA |

However,customers are often unsure or unaware of how to effectively converse with theseassistants to meet their shopping needs. In this work, we emphasize theimportance of providing customers a fast, easy to use, and natural way tointeract with conversational shopping assistants. We propose a framework thatemploys Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate contextual,useful, answerable, fluent and diverse questions about products, via in-contextlearning and supervised fine-tuning. Recommending these questions to customersas helpful suggestions or hints to both start and continue a conversation canresult in a smoother and faster shopping experience with reduced conversationoverhead and friction. We perform extensive offline evaluations, and discuss indetail about potential customer impact, and the type, length and latency of ourgenerated product questions if incorporated into a real-world shoppingassistant. | Nikhita Vedula, Oleg Rokhlenko, Shervin Malmasi | Amazon |

While various models have been proposed (e.g., Belkin's ASK, Berry picking, Everyday-life information seeking, Information foraging theory, Economic theory, etc.), they have largely ignored the impact of cognitive biases on search behaviour and performance. A growing body of empirical work exploring how people's cognitive biases influence search and judgments, has led to the development of new models of search that draw upon Behavioural Economics and Psychology. This full day tutorial will provide a starting point for researchers seeking to learn more about information seeking, search and retrieval under uncertainty. The tutorial will be structured into three parts. First, we will provide an introduction of the biases and heuristics program put forward by Tversky and Kahneman [60] (1974) which assumes that people are not always rational. The second part of the tutorial will provide an overview of the types and space of biases in search,[5, 40] before doing a deep dive into several specific examples and the impact of biases on different types of decisions (e.g., health/medical, financial). The third part will focus on a discussion of the practical implication regarding the design and evaluation human-centered IR systems in the light of cognitive biases - where participants will undertake some hands-on exercises. | Jiqun Liu, Leif Azzopardi | University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, United Kingdom; The University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK, USA |

Among these works, many of them utilize in-contextexamples to achieve generalization without the need for fine-tuning, while fewof them have considered the problem of how to select and effectively utilizethese examples. Recently, methods based on trajectory-level retrieval with taskmeta-data and using trajectories as in-context examples have been proposed toimprove the agent's overall performance in some sequential decision makingtasks. However, these methods can be problematic due to plausible examplesretrieved without task-specific state transition dynamics and long input withplenty of irrelevant context. In this paper, we propose a novel framework(TRAD) to address these issues. TRAD first conducts Thought Retrieval,achieving step-level demonstration selection via thought matching, leading tomore helpful demonstrations and less irrelevant input noise. Then, TRADintroduces Aligned Decision, complementing retrieved demonstration steps withtheir previous or subsequent steps, which enables tolerance for imperfectthought and provides a choice for balance between more context and less noise.Extensive experiments on ALFWorld and Mind2Web benchmarks show that TRAD notonly outperforms state-of-the-art models but also effectively helps in reducingnoise and promoting generalization. Furthermore, TRAD has been deployed inreal-world scenarios of a global business insurance company and improves thesuccess rate of robotic process automation. | Ruiwen Zhou, Yingxuan Yang, Muning Wen, Ying Wen, Wenhao Wang, Chunling Xi, Guoqiang Xu, Yong Yu, Weinan Zhang | China Pacific Insurance Company; Shanghai Jiao Tong University |

Our approach complements existing prompting approaches for LLM-based zero-shot ranking: Pointwise, Pairwise, and Listwise. Through the first-of-its-kind comparative evaluation within a consistent experimental framework and considering factors like model size, token consumption, latency, among others, we show that existing approaches are inherently characterised by trade-offs between effectiveness and efficiency. We find that while Pointwise approaches score high on efficiency, they suffer from poor effectiveness. Conversely, Pairwise approaches demonstrate superior effectiveness but incur high computational overhead. Our Setwise approach, instead, reduces the number of LLM inferences and the amount of prompt token consumption during the ranking procedure, compared to previous methods. This significantly improves the efficiency of LLM-based zero-shot ranking, while also retaining high zero-shot ranking effectiveness. We make our code and results publicly available at . | Shengyao Zhuang, Honglei Zhuang, Bevan Koopman, Guido Zuccon | CSIRO; The University of Queensland; Google Research |
| 154 |  |  [Representation Learning and Information Retrieval](https://doi.org/10.1145/3626772.3657995) |  | 0 | How to best represent words, documents, queries, entities, relations, and other variables in information retrieval (IR) and related applications has been a fundamental research question for decades. Early IR systems relied on the independence assumptions about words and documents for simplicity and scalability, which were clearly sub-optimal from a semantic point of view. The rapid development of deep neural networks in the past decade has revolutionized the representation learning technologies for contextualized word embedding and graph-enhanced document embedding, leading to the new era of dense IR. This talk highlights such impactful shifts in representation learning for IR and related areas, the new challenges coming along and the remedies, including our recent work in large-scale dense IR [1, 9], in graph-based reasoning for knowledge-enhanced predictions [10], in self-refinement of large language models (LLMs) with retrieval augmented generation (RAG)[2,7] and iterative feedback [3,4], in principle-driven self-alignment of LLMs with minimum human supervision [6], etc. More generally, the power of such deep learning goes beyond IR enhancements, e.g., for significantly improving the state-of-the-art solvers for NP-Complete problems in classical computer science [5,8]. | Yiming Yang |  |

ICL, thus, is conceptually similar to a non-parametric approach, suchas k-NN, where the prediction for each instance essentially depends on thelocal topology, i.e., on a localised set of similar instances and their labels(called few-shot examples). This suggests that a test instance in ICL isanalogous to a query in IR, and similar examples in ICL retrieved from atraining set relate to a set of documents retrieved from a collection in IR.While standard unsupervised ranking models can be used to retrieve thesefew-shot examples from a training set, the effectiveness of the examples canpotentially be improved by re-defining the notion of relevance specific to itsutility for the downstream task, i.e., considering an example to be relevant ifincluding it in the prompt instruction leads to a correct prediction. With thistask-specific notion of relevance, it is possible to train a supervised rankingmodel (e.g., a bi-encoder or cross-encoder), which potentially learns tooptimally select the few-shot examples. We believe that the recent advances inneural rankers can potentially find a use case for this task of optimallychoosing examples for more effective downstream ICL predictions. | Andrew Parry, Debasis Ganguly, Manish Chandra | University of Glasgow; University of Glasgow School of Computing; University of Glasgow Computing Science |

Specifically, the modification text describes the distinction between the two images. To conduct ZS-CIR, the prevailing methods employ pre-trained image-to-text models to transform the query image and text into a single text, which is then projected into the common feature space by CLIP to retrieve the target image. However, these methods neglect that ZS-CIR is a typicalfuzzy retrieval task, where the semantics of the target image are not strictly defined by the query image and text. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a training-free LLM-based Divergent Reasoning and Ensemble (LDRE) method for ZS-CIR to capture diverse possible semantics of the composed result. Firstly, we employ a pre-trained captioning model to generate dense captions for the reference image, focusing on different semantic perspectives of the reference image. Then, we prompt Large Language Models (LLMs) to conduct divergent compositional reasoning based on the dense captions and modification text, deriving divergent edited captions that cover the possible semantics of the composed target. Finally, we design a divergent caption ensemble to obtain the ensemble caption feature weighted by semantic relevance scores, which is subsequently utilized to retrieve the target image in the CLIP feature space. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our proposed LDRE achieves the new state-of-the-art performance. | Zhenyu Yang, Dizhan Xue, Shengsheng Qian, Weiming Dong, Changsheng Xu | State Key Laboratory of Multimodal Artificial Intelligence Systems |

Nevertheless, they still suffer from the cold-start issue. Knowledge Graphs (KGs), providing external information, have been extensively applied in GNN-based methods to mitigate this issue. However, current KG-aware recommendation methods suffer from the knowledge imbalance problem caused by incompleteness of existing KGs. This imbalance is reflected by the long-tail phenomenon of item attributes, i.e., unpopular items usually lack more attributes compared to popular items. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel framework called EditKG: Editing Knowledge Graph for Recommendation, to balance attribute distribution of items via editing KGs. EditKG consists of two key designs: Knowledge Generator and Knowledge Deleter. Knowledge Generator generates attributes for items by exploring their mutual information correlations and semantic correlations. Knowledge Deleter removes the task-irrelevant item attributes according to the parameterized task relevance score, while dropping the spurious item attributes through aligning the attribute scores. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that EditKG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and achieves 8.98% average improvement. The implementations are available at https://github.com/gutang-97/2024SIGIR-EditKG. | Gu Tang, Xiaoying Gan, Jinghe Wang, Bin Lu, Lyuwen Wu, Luoyi Fu, Chenghu Zhou | Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China; Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China |

RLT is crucial for re-ranking as it canimprove re-ranking efficiency by sending variable-length candidate lists to are-ranker on a per-query basis. It also has the potential to improve re-rankingeffectiveness. Despite its importance, there is limited research into applyingRLT methods to this new perspective. To address this research gap, we reproduceexisting RLT methods in the context of re-ranking, especially newly emergedlarge language model (LLM)-based re-ranking. In particular, we examine to whatextent established findings on RLT for retrieval are generalizable to the"retrieve-then-re-rank" setup from three perspectives: (i) assessing RLTmethods in the context of LLM-based re-ranking with lexical first-stageretrieval, (ii) investigating the impact of different types of first-stageretrievers on RLT methods, and (iii) investigating the impact of differenttypes of re-rankers on RLT methods. We perform experiments on the TREC 2019 and2020 deep learning tracks, investigating 8 RLT methods for pipelines involving3 retrievers and 2 re-rankers. We reach new insights into RLT methods in thecontext of re-ranking. | Chuan Meng, Negar Arabzadeh, Arian Askari, Mohammad Aliannejadi, Maarten de Rijke | Leiden University; University of Waterloo; University of Amsterdam |

Neuralnetwork based ranking is widely adopted due to its powerful capacity inmodeling complex relationships, such as between users and items, questions andanswers. However, it is usually exploited in offline or re-ranking manners forit is time-consuming in computations. Online neural network ranking–so calledfast neural ranking–is considered challenging because neural network measuresare usually non-convex and asymmetric. Traditional Approximate Nearest Neighbor(ANN) search which usually focuses on metric ranking measures, is notapplicable to these advanced measures. In this paper, we introduce a novel graph searching framework to acceleratethe searching in the fast neural ranking problem. The proposed graph searchingalgorithm is bi-level: we first construct a probable candidate set; then weonly evaluate the neural network measure over the probable candidate setinstead of evaluating the neural network over all neighbors. Specifically, wepropose a gradient-based algorithm that approximates the rank of the neuralnetwork matching score to construct the probable candidate set; and we presentan angle-based heuristic procedure to adaptively identify the proper size ofthe probable candidate set. Empirical results on public data confirm theeffectiveness of our proposed algorithms. | Weijie Zhao, Shulong Tan, Ping Li | Baidu Research USA; Rochester Institute of Technology; VecML |

Doc2Query minus minus (Doc2Query-) represents an extension to the expansion process that uses a neural model to identify and remove expansions that may not be relevant to the given document, thereby increasing the quality of the ranking while simultaneously reducing the amount of augmented data. In this work, we conduct a detailed reproducibility study of Doc2Query- to better understand the trade-offs inherent to document expansion and filtering mechanisms. After successfully reproducing the best-performing method from the Doc2Query- family, we show that filtering actually harms recall-based metrics on various test collections. Next, we explore whether the two-stage "generate-then-filter" process can be replaced with a single generation phase via reinforcement learning. Finally, we extend our experimentation to learned sparse retrieval models and demonstrate that filtering is not helpful when term weights can be learned. Overall, our work provides a deeper understanding of the behaviour and characteristics of common document expansion mechanisms, and paves the way for developing more efficient yet effective augmentation models. | Watheq Mansour, Shengyao Zhuang, Guido Zuccon, Joel Mackenzie | CSIRO, Brisbane, Australia; The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia |

Recent CIR studies leverage vision-language pre-trained(VLP) methods as the feature extraction backbone, and perform nonlinearfeature-level multimodal query fusion to retrieve the target image. Despite thepromising performance, we argue that their nonlinear feature-level multimodalfusion may lead to the fused feature deviating from the original embeddingspace, potentially hurting the retrieval performance. To address this issue, inthis work, we propose shifting the multimodal fusion from the feature level tothe raw-data level to fully exploit the VLP model's multimodal encoding andcross-modal alignment abilities. In particular, we introduce a Dual QueryUnification-based Composed Image Retrieval framework (DQU-CIR), whose backbonesimply involves a VLP model's image encoder and a text encoder. Specifically,DQU-CIR first employs two training-free query unification components:text-oriented query unification and vision-oriented query unification, toderive a unified textual and visual query based on the raw data of themultimodal query, respectively. The unified textual query is derived byconcatenating the modification text with the extracted reference image'stextual description, while the unified visual query is created by writing thekey modification words onto the reference image. Ultimately, to address diversesearch intentions, DQU-CIR linearly combines the features of the two unifiedqueries encoded by the VLP model to retrieve the target image. Extensiveexperiments on four real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of ourproposed method. | Haokun Wen, Xuemeng Song, Xiaolin Chen, Yinwei Wei, Liqiang Nie, TatSeng Chua | Shandong University; Shandong University School of Software, Joint SDU-NTU Centre for Artificial Intelligence Research; Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen) School of Computer Science and Technology; National University of Singapore; Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen); Monash University |

Nevertheless, due to the expensive labor cost of training data annotation, recent researchers have shifted to the challenging task of zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR), which targets fulfilling CIR without annotated triplets. The pioneer ZS-CIR studies focus on converting the CIR task into a standard text-to-image retrieval task by pre-training a textual inversion network that can map a given image into a single pseudo-word token. Despite their significant progress, their coarse-grained textual inversion may be insufficient to capture the full content of the image accurately. To overcome this issue, in this work, we propose a novel Fine-grained Textual Inversion Network for ZS-CIR, named FTI4CIR. In particular, FTI4CIR comprises two main components: fine-grained pseudo-word token mapping and tri-wise caption-based semantic regularization. The former maps the image into a subject-oriented pseudo-word token and several attribute-oriented pseudo-word tokens to comprehensively express the image in the textual form, while the latter works on jointly aligning the fine-grained pseudo-word tokens to the real-word token embedding space based on a BLIP-generated image caption template. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method. | Haoqiang Lin, Haokun Wen, Xuemeng Song, Meng Liu, Yupeng Hu, Liqiang Nie | Shandong University, Qingdao, Shandong, China; Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen), Shenzhen, Guangdong, China; Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China; Shandong Jianzhu University, Jinan, Shandong, China |

TREC's mission centers around providing the infrastructure and resources to make IR evaluations possible at scale. Over the years, a plethora of different retrieval problems were addressed, culminating in data artifacts that remained as valuable and useful tools for the IR community. Even though the data are largely available from TREC's website, there is currently no resource that facilitates a cohesive way to obtain metadata information about the run file - the IR community's de-facto standard data format for storing rankings of system-oriented IR experiments. To this end, the work at hand introduces a software suite that facilitates access to metadata of experimental resources, resulting from over 30 years of IR experiments and evaluations at TREC. With a particular focus on the run files, the paper motivates the requirements for better access to TREC metadata and details the concepts, the resources, the corresponding implementations, and possible use cases. More specifically, we contribute a web interface to browse former TREC submissions. Besides, we provide the underlying metadatabase and a corresponding RESTful interface for more principled and structured queries about the TREC metadata. | Timo Breuer, Ellen M.

While methods and systems continue evolving, existing test collections for this task exhibit shortcomings, particularly suffering from lexical bias in pooling and limited to keyword-style queries for evaluation. To address these limitations, in this paper, we construct ACORDAR 2.0, a new test collection for this task which is also the largest to date. To reduce lexical bias in pooling, we adapt dense retrieval models to large structured data, using them to find an extended set of semantically relevant datasets to be annotated. To diversify query forms, we employ a large language model to rewrite keyword queries into high-quality question-style queries. We use the test collection to evaluate popular sparse and dense retrieval models to establish a baseline for future studies.

However, the cost of fine-tuning LLMs on rapidly expandingrecommendation data limits their practical application. To address thischallenge, few-shot fine-tuning offers a promising approach to quickly adaptLLMs to new recommendation data. We propose the task of data pruning forefficient LLM-based recommendation, aimed at identifying representative samplestailored for LLMs' few-shot fine-tuning. While coreset selection is closelyrelated to the proposed task, existing coreset selection methods often rely onsuboptimal heuristic metrics or entail costly optimization on large-scalerecommendation data. To tackle these issues, we introduce two objectives for the data pruning taskin the context of LLM-based recommendation: 1) high accuracy aims to identifythe influential samples that can lead to high overall performance; and 2) highefficiency underlines the low costs of the data pruning process. To pursue thetwo objectives, we propose a novel data pruning method based on two scores,i.e., influence score and effort score, to efficiently identify the influentialsamples. Particularly, the influence score is introduced to accurately estimatethe influence of sample removal on the overall performance. To achieve lowcosts of the data pruning process, we use a small-sized surrogate model toreplace LLMs to obtain the influence score. Considering the potential gapbetween the surrogate model and LLMs, we further propose an effort score toprioritize some hard samples specifically for LLMs. Empirical results on threereal-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Inparticular, the proposed method uses only 2fine-tuning, reducing time costs by 97 | Xinyu Lin, Wenjie Wang, Yongqi Li, Shuo Yang, Fuli Feng, Yinwei Wei, TatSeng Chua | National University of Singapore; University of Technology Sydney; The Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Monash University; University of Science and Technology of China |

However,existing offline RL-based sequential recommendation methods face the challengeof obtaining effective user feedback from the environment. Effectively modelingthe user state and shaping an appropriate reward for recommendation remains achallenge. In this paper, we leverage language understanding capabilities andadapt large language models (LLMs) as an environment (LE) to enhance RL-basedrecommenders. The LE is learned from a subset of user-item interaction data,thus reducing the need for large training data, and can synthesise userfeedback for offline data by: (i) acting as a state model that produces highquality states that enrich the user representation, and (ii) functioning as areward model to accurately capture nuanced user preferences on actions.Moreover, the LE allows to generate positive actions that augment the limitedoffline training data. We propose a LE Augmentation (LEA) method to furtherimprove recommendation performance by optimising jointly the supervisedcomponent and the RL policy, using the augmented actions and historical usersignals. We use LEA, the state and reward models in conjunction withstate-of-the-art RL recommenders and report experimental results on twopublicly available datasets. | Jie Wang, Alexandros Karatzoglou, Ioannis Arapakis, Joemon M.

Despite this interest, the field is still emerging, and the lackof open-source R D platforms may impede the exploration of LLM-basedrecommendations. This paper introduces OpenP5, an open-source platform designedas a resource to facilitate the development, training, and evaluation ofLLM-based generative recommender systems for research purposes. The platform isimplemented using encoder-decoder LLMs (e.g., T5) and decoder-only LLMs (e.g.,Llama-2) across 10 widely recognized public datasets, catering to twofundamental recommendation tasks: sequential and straightforwardrecommendations. Recognizing the crucial role of item IDs in LLM-basedrecommendations, we have also incorporated three item indexing methods withinthe OpenP5 platform: random indexing, sequential indexing and collaborativeindexing. Built on the Transformers library, the platform facilitates easycustomization of LLM-based recommendations for users. OpenP5 boasts a range offeatures including extensible data processing, task-centric optimization,comprehensive datasets and checkpoints, efficient acceleration, andstandardized evaluations, making it a valuable tool for the implementation andevaluation of LLM-based recommender systems.

Priorapproaches for enhancing fairness in recommender systems presume theavailability of all sensitive attributes, which can be difficult to obtain dueto privacy concerns or inadequate means of capturing these attributes. Inpractice, the efficacy of these approaches is limited, pushing us toinvestigate ways of promoting fairness with limited sensitive attributeinformation. Toward this goal, it is important to reconstruct missing sensitiveattributes. Nevertheless, reconstruction errors are inevitable due to thecomplexity of real-world sensitive attribute reconstruction problems and legalregulations. Thus, we pursue fair learning methods that are robust toreconstruction errors. To this end, we propose Distributionally Robust FairOptimization (DRFO), which minimizes the worst-case unfairness over allpotential probability distributions of missing sensitive attributes instead ofthe reconstructed one to account for the impact of the reconstruction errors.We provide theoretical and empirical evidence to demonstrate that our methodcan effectively ensure fairness in recommender systems when only limitedsensitive attributes are accessible. | Tianhao Shi, Yang Zhang, Jizhi Zhang, Fuli Feng, Xiangnan He | university of science and technology of china; University of Science and Technology of China |

They open up unprecedented opportunities for transforming information retrieval (IR) research and applications. However, concerns such as halluciation undermine their trustworthiness, limiting their actual utility when deployed in real-world applications, especially high-stake applications where trust is vital. How can we both exploit the strengths of LLMs and mitigate any risk caused by their weaknesses when applying LLMs to IR? What are the best opportunities for us to apply LLMs to IR? What are the major challenges that we will need to address in the future to fully exploit such opportunities? Given the anticipated growth of LLMs, what will future information retrieval systems look like? Will LLMs eventually replace an IR system? In this perspective paper, we examine these questions and provide provisional answers to them. We argue that LLMs will not be able to replace search engines, and future LLMs would need to learn how to use a search engine so that they can interact with a search engine on behalf of users. We conclude with a set of promising future research directions in applying LLMs to IR. | ChengXiang Zhai | University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA |

To this aim, PAG constructs a set-based and sequential identifier for each document. Motivated by the bag-of-words assumption in information retrieval, the set-based identifier is built on lexical tokens. The sequential identifier, on the other hand, is obtained via quantizing relevance-based representations of documents. Extensive experiments on MSMARCO and TREC Deep Learning Track data reveal that PAG outperforms the state-of-the-art generative retrieval model by a large margin (e.g., 15.6% MRR improvements on MS MARCO), while achieving 22x speed up in terms of query latency. | Hansi Zeng, Chen Luo, Hamed Zamani | Amazon; University of Massachusetts Amherst |

However, these systems often overlook a critical aspect: theevolving skill demand of the job market. This paper focuses on the perspectiveof academic researchers, working in collaboration with the industry, aiming todevelop a course recommender system that incorporates job market skill demands.In light of the job market's rapid changes and the current state of research incourse recommender systems, we outline essential properties for courserecommender systems to address these demands effectively, includingexplainable, sequential, unsupervised, and aligned with the job market anduser's goals. Our discussion extends to the challenges and research questionsthis objective entails, including unsupervised skill extraction from joblistings, course descriptions, and resumes, as well as predictingrecommendations that align with learner objectives and the job market anddesigning metrics to evaluate this alignment. Furthermore, we introduce aninitial system that addresses some existing limitations of course recommendersystems using large Language Models (LLMs) for skill extraction andReinforcement Learning (RL) for alignment with the job market. We provideempirical results using open-source data to demonstrate its effectiveness. | Jibril Frej, Anna Dai, Syrielle Montariol, Antoine Bosselut, Tanja Käser | EPFL |

However, existing approaches oftensuffer from fairness issues, as recommendations tend to be more accurate forpatients with common diseases compared to those with rare conditions. In thispaper, we propose a novel model called Robust and Accurate REcommendations forMedication (RAREMed), which leverages the pretrain-finetune learning paradigmto enhance accuracy for rare diseases. RAREMed employs a transformer encoderwith a unified input sequence approach to capture complex relationships amongdisease and procedure codes. Additionally, it introduces two self-supervisedpre-training tasks, namely Sequence Matching Prediction (SMP) and SelfReconstruction (SR), to learn specialized medication needs and interrelationsamong clinical codes. Experimental results on two real-world datasetsdemonstrate that RAREMed provides accurate drug sets for both rare and commondisease patients, thereby mitigating unfairness in medication recommendationsystems. | Zihao Zhao, Yi Jing, Fuli Feng, Jiancan Wu, Chongming Gao, Xiangnan He | University of Science and Technology of China |

Despite an increasinglylanguage-diverse online community, in which many Internet users consume news inmultiple languages, the majority of news recommendation focuses on major,resource-rich languages, and English in particular. Moreover, nearly all newsrecommendation efforts assume monolingual news consumption, whereas more andmore users tend to consume information in at least two languages. Accordingly,the existing body of work on news recommendation suffers from a lack ofpublicly available multilingual benchmarks that would catalyze development ofnews recommenders effective in multilingual settings and for low-resourcelanguages. Aiming to fill this gap, we introduce xMIND, an open, multilingualnews recommendation dataset derived from the English MIND dataset using machinetranslation, covering a set of 14 linguistically and geographically diverselanguages, with digital footprints of varying sizes. Using xMIND, wesystematically benchmark several state-of-the-art content-based neural newsrecommenders (NNRs) in both zero-shot (ZS-XLT) and few-shot (FS-XLT)cross-lingual transfer scenarios, considering both monolingual and bilingualnews consumption patterns. Our findings reveal that (i) current NNRs, even whenbased on a multilingual language model, suffer from substantial performancelosses under ZS-XLT and that (ii) inclusion of target-language data in FS-XLTtraining has limited benefits, particularly when combined with a bilingual newsconsumption. Our findings thus warrant a broader research effort inmultilingual and cross-lingual news recommendation.

Addressing this issue, our study introduces a novel integration of applying Large Language Models (LLMs) as Cross-lingual Readers in information retrieval systems, specifically targeting the complexities of cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR). We present an innovative approach: Activation Steered Multilingual Retrieval (ASMR) that employs "steering activations''-a method to adjust and direct the LLM's focus-enhancing its ability to understand user queries and generate accurate, language-coherent responses. ASMR adeptly combines a Multilingual Dense Passage Retrieval (mDPR) system with an LLM, overcoming the limitations of traditional search engines in handling diverse linguistic inputs. This approach is particularly effective in managing the nuances and intricacies inherent in various languages. Rigorous testing on established benchmarks such as XOR-TyDi QA, and MKQA demonstrates that ASMR not only meets but surpasses existing standards in CLIR, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The results of our research hold significant implications for understanding the inherent features of how LLMs understand and generate natural languages, offering an attempt towards more inclusive, effective, and linguistically diverse information access on a global scale. | Ping Guo, Yubing Ren, Yue Hu, Yanan Cao, Yunpeng Li, Heyan Huang | Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China |

However, these systems are prone to generating biased and toxic completions due to inherent learning biases. Existing detoxification approaches exhibit two key limitations: (1) They primarily focus on mitigating toxicity for grammatically well-formed long sentences but struggle to adapt to the QAC task, where queries are short and structurally different (include spelling errors, do not follow grammatical rules and have relatively flexible word order). (2) These approaches often view detoxification through a binary lens where all text labeled as toxic is undesirable, and non-toxic is considered desirable. To address these limitations, we propose DAC, an intuitive and efficient reinforcement learning-based model to detoxify QAC. With DAC, we introduce an additional perspective of considering the third query class of addressable toxicity. These queries can encompass implicit toxicity, subjective toxicity, or non-toxic queries containing toxic words. We incorporate this three-class query behavior perspective into the proposed model through quantized optimal transport to learn distinctions and generate truly non-toxic completions. We evaluate toxicity levels in the generated completions by DAC across two real-world QAC datasets (Bing and AOL) using two classifiers: a publicly available generic classifier (Detoxify) and a search query-specific classifier, which we develop (TClassify). We find that DAC consistently outperforms all existing baselines on the Bing dataset and achieves competitive performance on the AOL dataset for query detoxification. % providing high quality and low toxicity.

C-Pack includes three critical resources. 1) C-MTP is a massive training dataset for text embedding, which is based on the curation of vast unlabeled corpora and the integration of high-quality labeled corpora. 2) C-MTEB is a comprehensive benchmark for Chinese text embeddings covering 6 tasks and 35 datasets. 3) BGE is a family of embedding models covering multiple sizes. Our models outperform all prior Chinese text embeddings on C-MTEB by more than +10% upon the time of the release. We also integrate and optimize the entire suite of training methods for BGE. Along with our resources on general Chinese embedding, we release our data and models for English text embeddings. The English models also achieve state-of-the-art performance on the MTEB benchmark; meanwhile, our released English data is 2 times larger than the Chinese data. Both Chinese and English datasets are the largest public release of training data for text embeddings.

RAG systems enhancetheir generation ability by incorporating external data retrieved through anInformation Retrieval (IR) phase, overcoming the limitations of standard LLMs,which are restricted to their pre-trained knowledge and limited context window.Most research in this area has predominantly concentrated on the generativeaspect of LLMs within RAG systems. Our study fills this gap by thoroughly andcritically analyzing the influence of IR components on RAG systems. This paperanalyzes which characteristics a retriever should possess for an effectiveRAG's prompt formulation, focusing on the type of documents that should beretrieved. We evaluate various elements, such as the relevance of the documentsto the prompt, their position, and the number included in the context. Ourfindings reveal, among other insights, that including irrelevant documents canunexpectedly enhance performance by more than 30our initial assumption of diminished quality. These findings call fordeveloping specialized approaches tailored to the specific demands ofintegrating retrieval with language generation models and pave the way forfuture research. These results underscore the need for developing specializedstrategies to integrate retrieval with language generation models, therebylaying the groundwork for future research in this field. | Florin Cuconasu, Giovanni Trappolini, Federico Siciliano, Simone Filice, Cesare Campagnano, Yoelle Maarek, Nicola Tonellotto, Fabrizio Silvestri | University of Pisa; Sapienza University of Rome; Technology Innovation Institute |

Toaddress these challenges, we propose a novel LLM-centric approach, IM-RAG, thatintegrates IR systems with LLMs to support multi-round RAG through learningInner Monologues (IM, i.e., the human inner voice that narrates one'sthoughts). During the IM process, the LLM serves as the core reasoning model(i.e., Reasoner) to either propose queries to collect more information via theRetriever or to provide a final answer based on the conversational context. Wealso introduce a Refiner that improves the outputs from the Retriever,effectively bridging the gap between the Reasoner and IR modules with varyingcapabilities and fostering multi-round communications. The entire IM process isoptimized via Reinforcement Learning (RL) where a Progress Tracker isincorporated to provide mid-step rewards, and the answer prediction is furtherseparately optimized via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). We conduct extensiveexperiments with the HotPotQA dataset, a popular benchmark for retrieval-based,multi-step question-answering. The results show that our approach achievesstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while providing high flexibility inintegrating IR modules as well as strong interpretability exhibited in thelearned inner monologues. | Diji Yang, Jinmeng Rao, Kezhen Chen, Xiaoyuan Guo, Yawen Zhang, Jie Yang, Yi Zhang | Mineral.ai; University of California Santa Cruz |

This perspectives paper highlights the importance of moving towardsbuilding human-centered PCAs that emphasize human needs and expectations, andthat considers ethical and social implications of these agents, rather thansolely focusing on technological capabilities. The distinction between aproactive and a reactive system lies in the proactive system'sinitiative-taking nature. Without thoughtful design, proactive systems riskbeing perceived as intrusive by human users. We address the issue byestablishing a new taxonomy concerning three key dimensions of human-centeredPCAs, namely Intelligence, Adaptivity, and Civility. We discuss potentialresearch opportunities and challenges based on this new taxonomy upon the fivestages of PCA system construction. This perspectives paper lays a foundationfor the emerging area of conversational information retrieval research andpaves the way towards advancing human-centered proactive conversationalsystems. | Yang Deng, Lizi Liao, Zhonghua Zheng, Grace Hui Yang, TatSeng Chua | Georgetown University; National University of Singapore; Singapore Management University; Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen |

However, such an ideal assumption is extremely impossible due to the inevitably mismatched data pairs, a.k.a. noisy correspondence, which can wrongly enforce the mismatched data to be similar and thus induces the performance degradation. Although some recent methods have attempted to address this problem, they still face two challenging issues: 1) unreliable data division for training inefficiency and 2) unstable prediction for matching failure. To address these problems, we propose an efficient Uncertainty-Guided Noisy Correspondence Learning (UGNCL) framework to achieve noise-robust cross-modal matching. Specifically, a novel Uncertainty Guided Division (UGD) algorithm is reliably designed leverage the potential benefits of derived uncertainty to divide the data into clean, noisy and hard partitions, which can effortlessly mitigate the impact of easily-determined noisy pairs. Meanwhile, an efficient Trusted Robust Loss (TRL) is explicitly designed to recast the soft margins, calibrated by confident yet error soft correspondence labels, for the data pairs in the hard partition through the uncertainty, leading to increase/decrease the importance of matched/mismatched pairs and further alleviate the impact of noisy pairs for robustness improvement. Extensive experiments conducted on three public datasets highlight the superiorities of the proposed framework, and show its competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-arts.

Although some existing powerful deep learning models have achieved improved performance, various aspects remain unexplored: (1) Most existing models using contrastive learning tend to rely on high-quality data augmentation which requires precise contrastive view generation; (2) There is multifaceted natural noise in group recommendation, and additional noise is introduced during data augmentation; (3) Most existing hypergraph neural network-based models over-entangle the information of members and items, ignoring their unique characteristics. In light of this, we propose a highly effective Disentangled Hypergraph Masked Auto Encoder-enhanced method for group recommendation (DHMAE), combining a disentangled hypergraph neural network with a graph masked autoencoder. This approach creates self-supervised signals without data augmentation by masking the features of some nodes and hyperedges and then reconstructing them. For the noise problem, we design a masking strategy that relies on pre-computed degree-sensitive probabilities for the process of masking features. Furthermore, we propose a disentangled hypergraph neural network for group recommendation scenarios to extract common messages of members and items and disentangle them during the convolution process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models and effectively addresses the noise issue. | Yingqi Zhao, Haiwei Zhang, Qijie Bai, Changli Nie, Xiaojie Yuan | Nankai University |

So far, most NBRstudies have focused on optimizing the accuracy of the recommendation, whereasoptimizing for beyond-accuracy metrics, e.g., item fairness and diversityremains largely unexplored. Recent studies into NBR have found a substantialperformance difference between recommending repeat items and explore items.Repeat items contribute most of the users' perceived accuracy compared withexplore items. Informed by these findings, we identify a potential "short-cut"to optimize for beyond-accuracy metrics while maintaining high accuracy. Toleverage and verify the existence of such short-cuts, we propose aplug-and-play two-step repetition-exploration (TREx) framework that treatsrepeat items and explores items separately, where we design a simple yet highlyeffective repetition module to ensure high accuracy, while two explorationmodules target optimizing only beyond-accuracy metrics. Experiments areperformed on two widely-used datasets w.r.t. a range of beyond-accuracymetrics, viz. five fairness metrics and three diversity metrics. Ourexperimental results verify the effectiveness of TREx. Prima facie, thisappears to be good news: we can achieve high accuracy and improvedbeyond-accuracy metrics at the same time. However, we argue that the real-worldvalue of our algorithmic solution, TREx, is likely to be limited and reflect onthe reasonableness of the evaluation setup. We end up challenging existingevaluation paradigms, particularly in the context of beyond-accuracy metrics,and provide insights for researchers to navigate potential pitfalls anddetermine reasonable metrics to consider when optimizing for accuracy andbeyond-accuracy metrics. | Ming Li, Yuanna Liu, Sami Jullien, Mozhdeh Ariannezhad, Andrew Yates, Mohammad Aliannejadi, Maarten de Rijke | University of Amsterdam; Universiteit van Amsterdam |

However, the cascade graph modeling paradigm adopted in mainstream MBRS usually assumes that users will refer to all types of behavioral knowledge they have when making decisions about target behaviors, i.e., use all types of behavioral interactions indiscriminately when modeling and predicting target behaviors for each user. We call this a full decision chain constraint and argue that it may be too strict by ignoring that different types of behavioral knowledge have varying importance for different users. In this paper, we propose a novel automated decision chain selection (AutoDCS) framework to relax this constraint, which can consider each user's unique decision dependencies and select a reasonable set of behavioral knowledge to activate for the prediction of target behavior. Specifically, AutoDCS first integrates some existing MBRS methods in a base cascade module to obtain a set of behavior-aware embeddings. Then, a bilateral matching gating mechanism is used to select an exclusive set of behaviors for the current user-item pair to form a decision chain, and the corresponding behavior-augmented embeddings are selectively activated. Subsequently, AutoDCS combines the behavior-augmented and original behavior-aware embeddings to predict the target behavior. Finally, we evaluate AutoDCS and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments over four public multi-behavior benchmarks. | Dugang Liu, Shenxian Xian, Yuhao Wu, Chaohua Yang, Xing Tang, Xiuqiang He, Zhong Ming | Shenzhen University; College of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University; FiT,Tencent; Tencent |

While prior research in conversational information-seeking hasconcentrated on improving retrieval techniques, the challenge remains ingenerating responses useful from a user perspective. This study exploresdifferent methods of explaining the responses, hypothesizing that transparencyabout the source of the information, system confidence, and limitations canenhance users' ability to objectively assess the response. By exploringtransparency across explanation type, quality, and presentation mode, thisresearch aims to bridge the gap between system-generated responses andresponses verifiable by the user. We design a user study to answer questionsconcerning the impact of (1) the quality of explanations enhancing the responseon its usefulness and (2) ways of presenting explanations to users. Theanalysis of the collected data reveals lower user ratings for noisyexplanations, although these scores seem insensitive to the quality of theresponse.

Despite recent advances in explainable AI and IRtechniques, there is no consensus on the definition of explainability. Existingapproaches often treat it as a singular notion, disregarding themultidimensional definition postulated in the literature. In this paper, we usepsychometrics and crowdsourcing to identify human-centered factors ofexplainability in Web search systems and introduce SSE (Search SystemExplainability), an evaluation metric for explainable IR (XIR) search systems.In a crowdsourced user study, we demonstrate SSE's ability to distinguishbetween explainable and non-explainable systems, showing that systems withhigher scores indeed indicate greater interpretability. We hope that aside fromthese concrete contributions to XIR, this line of work will serve as ablueprint for similar explainability evaluation efforts in other domains ofmachine learning and natural language processing. | Catherine Chen, Carsten Eickhoff | University of Tübingen; Brown University |

Nevertheless, current metadata-based approaches have revealed shortcomings due to the low quality and availability of dataset metadata, while the magnitude and heterogeneity of actual data hindered the development of content-based solutions. To address these challenges, we propose to convert different formats of structured data into a unified form, from which we extract a compact data snippet that indicates the relevance of the whole data. Thanks to its compactness, we feed it into a dense reranker to improve search accuracy. We also convert it back to the original format to be presented for assisting users in relevance judgment. The effectiveness of our approach has been demonstrated by extensive experiments on two test collections for dataset search. | Qiaosheng Chen, Jiageng Chen, Xiao Zhou, Gong Cheng | Nanjing University |

Fine-tuning is often required to fit generalLLMs for a specific domain, like the web-based healthcare system. However, twoproblems arise during fine-tuning LLMs for medical applications. One is thetask variety problem, which involves distinct tasks in real-world medicalscenarios. The variety often leads to sub-optimal fine-tuning for dataimbalance and seesaw problems. Besides, the large amount of parameters in LLMsleads to huge time and computation consumption by fine-tuning. To address thesetwo problems, we propose a novel parameter efficient fine-tuning framework formulti-task medical applications, dubbed as MOELoRA. The designed framework aimsto absorb both the benefits of mixture-of-expert (MOE) for multi-task learningand low-rank adaptation (LoRA) for parameter efficient fine-tuning. Forunifying MOE and LoRA, we devise multiple experts as the trainable parameters,where each expert consists of a pair of low-rank matrices to retain the smallsize of trainable parameters. Then, a task-motivated gate function for allMOELoRA layers is proposed, which can control the contributions of each expertand produce distinct parameters for various tasks. We conduct experiments on amulti-task medical dataset, indicating MOELoRA outperforms the existingparameter efficient fine-tuning methods.

Integrating bothpositive and negative feedback to form a signed graph can lead to a morecomprehensive understanding of user preferences. However, the existing effortsto incorporate both types of feedback are sparse and face two main limitations:1) They process positive and negative feedback separately, which fails toholistically leverage the collaborative information within the signed graph; 2)They rely on MLPs or GNNs for information extraction from negative feedback,which may not be effective. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SIGformer, a new method thatemploys the transformer architecture to sign-aware graph-based recommendation.SIGformer incorporates two innovative positional encodings that capture thespectral properties and path patterns of the signed graph, enabling the fullexploitation of the entire graph.

Previous studies have found thatthe performance of neural models frequently adheres to predictable scalinglaws, correlated with factors such as training set size and model size. Thisinsight is invaluable, especially as large-scale experiments grow increasinglyresource-intensive. Yet, such scaling law has not been fully explored in denseretrieval due to the discrete nature of retrieval metrics and complexrelationships between training data and model sizes in retrieval tasks. In thisstudy, we investigate whether the performance of dense retrieval models followsthe scaling law as other neural models. We propose to use contrastivelog-likelihood as the evaluation metric and conduct extensive experiments withdense retrieval models implemented with different numbers of parameters andtrained with different amounts of annotated data. Results indicate that, underour settings, the performance of dense retrieval models follows a precisepower-law scaling related to the model size and the number of annotations.Additionally, we examine scaling with prevalent data augmentation methods toassess the impact of annotation quality, and apply the scaling law to find thebest resource allocation strategy under a budget constraint. We believe thatthese insights will significantly contribute to understanding the scalingeffect of dense retrieval models and offer meaningful guidance for futureresearch endeavors. | Yan Fang, Jingtao Zhan, Qingyao Ai, Jiaxin Mao, Weihang Su, Jia Chen, Yiqun Liu | Renmin University of China; Xiaohongshu Inc; Tsinghua University |

Recently, theadvent of AI-generated content provides the opportunity for OR to transcendthese limitations, showcasing the potential for personalized outfit generationand recommendation. To this end, we introduce a novel task called Generative OutfitRecommendation (GOR), aiming to generate a set of fashion images and composethem into a visually compatible outfit tailored to specific users. The keyobjectives of GOR lie in the high fidelity, compatibility, and personalizationof generated outfits. To achieve these, we propose a generative outfitrecommender model named DiFashion, which empowers exceptional diffusion modelsto accomplish the parallel generation of multiple fashion images. To ensurethree objectives, we design three kinds of conditions to guide the parallelgeneration process and adopt Classifier-Free-Guidance to enhance the alignmentbetween the generated images and conditions. We apply DiFashion on bothpersonalized Fill-In-The-Blank and GOR tasks and conduct extensive experimentson iFashion and Polyvore-U datasets. The quantitative and human-involvedqualitative evaluation demonstrate the superiority of DiFashion overcompetitive baselines. | Yiyan Xu, Wenjie Wang, Fuli Feng, Yunshan Ma, Jizhi Zhang, Xiangnan He | National University of Singapore; University of Science and Technology of China |

However, existing diffusion model-based recommendersystems do not explicitly leverage high-order connectivities that containcrucial collaborative signals for accurate recommendations. Addressing thisgap, we propose CF-Diff, a new diffusion model-based collaborative filtering(CF) method, which is capable of making full use of collaborative signals alongwith multi-hop neighbors. Specifically, the forward-diffusion process addsrandom noise to user-item interactions, while the reverse-denoising processaccommodates our own learning model, named cross-attention-guided multi-hopautoencoder (CAM-AE), to gradually recover the original user-item interactions.CAM-AE consists of two core modules: 1) the attention-aided AE module,responsible for precisely learning latent representations of user-iteminteractions while preserving the model's complexity at manageable levels, and2) the multi-hop cross-attention module, which judiciously harnesses high-orderconnectivity information to capture enhanced collaborative signals. Throughcomprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets, we demonstrate thatCF-Diff is (a) Superior: outperforming benchmark recommendation methods,achieving remarkable gains up to 7.29Theoretically-validated: reducing computations while ensuring that theembeddings generated by our model closely approximate those from the originalcross-attention, and (c) Scalable: proving the computational efficiency thatscales linearly with the number of users or items. | Yu Hou, JinDuk Park, WonYong Shin | Yonsei University |

Most studiesalleviate the noise issues from data cleaning perspective such as dataresampling and reweighting, but they are constrained by heuristic assumptions.Another denoising avenue is from model perspective, which proactively injectsnoises into user-item interactions and enhances the intrinsic denoising abilityof models. However, this kind of denoising process poses significant challengesto the recommender model's representation capacity to capture noise patterns. To address this issue, we propose Denoising Diffusion Recommender Model(DDRM), which leverages multi-step denoising process of diffusion models torobustify user and item embeddings from any recommender models. DDRM injectscontrolled Gaussian noises in the forward process and iteratively removesnoises in the reverse denoising process, thereby improving embedding robustnessagainst noisy feedback. To achieve this target, the key lies in offeringappropriate guidance to steer the reverse denoising process and providing aproper starting point to start the forward-reverse process during inference. Inparticular, we propose a dedicated denoising module that encodes collaborativeinformation as denoising guidance. Besides, in the inference stage, DDRMutilizes the average embeddings of users' historically liked items as thestarting point rather than using pure noise since pure noise lackspersonalization, which increases the difficulty of the denoising process.Extensive experiments on three datasets with three representative backendrecommender models demonstrate the effectiveness of DDRM. | Jujia Zhao, Wenjie Wang, Yiyan Xu, Teng Sun, Fuli Feng, TatSeng Chua | Shandong University; National University of Singapore; Leiden University; University of Science and Technology of China School of Data Science; National University of Singapore School of Computing; University of Science and Technology of China |

Amongvarious methods, an increasingly popular paradigm is to reconstruct user-iteminteractions based on the historical observations. This can be viewed as aconditional generative task, where recently developed diffusion modeldemonstrates great potential. However, existing studies on diffusion modelslack effective solutions for modeling implicit feedback data. Particularly, theisotropic nature of the standard diffusion process fails to account for theheterogeneous dependencies among items, leading to a misalignment with thegraphical structure of the interaction space. Meanwhile, random noisedestroying personalized information in interaction vectors, causing difficultyin reverse reconstruction. In this paper, we make novel adaptions of diffusionmodel and propose Graph Signal Diffusion Model for Collaborative Filtering(named GiffCF). To better represent the high-dimensional and sparsedistribution of implicit feedback, we define a generalized form of denoisingdiffusion using heat equation on the item-item similarity graph. Our forwardprocess smooths interaction signals with an advanced family of graph filters.Hence, instead of losing information, it involves item-item similarities asbeneficial prior knowledge for recommendation. To reconstruct high-qualityinteractions, our reverse process iteratively refines and sharpens preferencesignals in a deterministic manner, where the update direction is conditioned onthe user history and computed from a carefully designed two-stage denoiser.Finally, through extensive experiments, we show that GiffCF effectivelyleverages the advantages of both diffusion model and graph signal processing,and achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets. | Yunqin Zhu, Chao Wang, Qi Zhang, Hui Xiong | Shanghai AI Laboratory; The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology; University of Science and Technology of China |

Conventional attack methods employ perturbations at asingle granularity, e.g., word-level or sentence-level, to a target document.However, limiting perturbations to a single level of granularity may reduce theflexibility of creating adversarial examples, thereby diminishing the potentialthreat of the attack. Therefore, we focus on generating high-qualityadversarial examples by incorporating multi-granular perturbations. Achievingthis objective involves tackling a combinatorial explosion problem, whichrequires identifying an optimal combination of perturbations across allpossible levels of granularity, positions, and textual pieces. To address thischallenge, we transform the multi-granular adversarial attack into a sequentialdecision-making process, where perturbations in the next attack step areinfluenced by the perturbed document in the current attack step. Since theattack process can only access the final state without direct intermediatesignals, we use reinforcement learning to perform multi-granular attacks.During the reinforcement learning process, two agents work cooperatively toidentify multi-granular vulnerabilities as attack targets and organizeperturbation candidates into a final perturbation sequence. Experimentalresults show that our attack method surpasses prevailing baselines in bothattack effectiveness and imperceptibility. | YuAn Liu, Ruqing Zhang, Jiafeng Guo, Maarten de Rijke, Yixing Fan, Xueqi Cheng | University of Amsterdam; Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences |

Interestingly, previous studies found that particularly on the BEIR subset Touché 2020, an argument retrieval task, neural retrieval models are considerably less effective than BM25. Still, so far, no further investigation has been conducted on what makes argument retrieval so "special". To more deeply analyze the respective potential limits of neural retrieval models, we run a reproducibility study on the Touché 2020 data. In our study, we focus on two experiments: (i) a black-box evaluation (i.e., no model retraining), incorporating a theoretical exploration using retrieval axioms, and (ii) a data denoising evaluation involving post-hoc relevance judgments. Our black-box evaluation reveals an inherent bias of neural models towards retrieving short passages from the Touché 2020 data, and we also find that quite a few of the neural models' results are unjudged in the Touché 2020 data. As many of the short Touché passages are not argumentative and thus non-relevant per se, and as the missing judgments complicate fair comparison, we denoise the Touché 2020 data by excluding very short passages (less than 20 words) and by augmenting the unjudged data with post-hoc judgments following the Touché guidelines. On the denoised data, the effectiveness of the neural models improves by up to 0.52 in nDCG@10, but BM25 is still more effective.

In contrast to traditional recommender systems that can benefit from extensive information, site recommendation starkly suffers from extremely limited information and thus leads to unsatisfactory performance. Therefore, existing site recommendation methods primarily focus on several specific name brands and heavily rely on fine-grained human-crafted features to avoid the data sparsity problem. However, such solutions are not able to fulfill the demand for rapid development in modern business. Therefore, we aim to alleviate the data sparsity problem by effectively utilizing data across multiple cities and thereby propose a novel Optimal Transport enhanced Cross-city (OTC) framework for site recommendation. Specifically, OTC leverages optimal transport (OT) on the learned embeddings of brands and regions separately to project the brands and regions from the source city to the target city. Then, the projected embeddings of brands and regions are utilized to obtain the inference recommendation in the target city. By integrating the original recommendation and the inference recommendations from multiple cities, OTC is able to achieve enhanced recommendation results. The experimental results on the real-world OpenSiteRec dataset, encompassing thousands of brands and regions across four metropolises, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed OTC in further improving the performance of site recommendation models. | Xinhang Li, Xiangyu Zhao, Zihao Wang, Yang Duan, Yong Zhang, Chunxiao Xing | City University of Hong Kong; UIUC; HKUST; Tsinghua University |

Most existing sequential-based and graph neural network-based methods have explored various approaches to modeling user visiting behaviors and have achieved considerable performances. However, two key issues have received less attention: i) Most previous studies have ignored the fact that user preferences are diverse and constantly changing in terms of various aspects, leading to entangled and suboptimal user representations. ii) Many existing methods have inadequately modeled the crucial cooperative associations between different aspects, hindering the ability to capture complementary recommendation effects during the learning process. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework Disentangled Contrastive Hypergraph Learning (DCHL) for next POI recommendation. Specifically, we design a multi-view disentangled hypergraph learning component to disentangle intrinsic aspects among collaborative, transitional and geographical views with adjusted hypergraph convolutional networks. Additionally, we propose an adaptive fusion method to integrate multi-view information automatically. Finally, cross-view contrastive learning is employed to capture cooperative associations among views and reinforce the quality of user and POI representations based on self-discrimination. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets validate the superiority of our proposal over various state-of-the-arts.

Its main objective is to predict the users' next interested POI based on their previous check-in information. Most existing studies view the next POI recommendation as a sequence prediction problem but pay little attention to the fine-grained latent preferences of users, neglecting the diversity of user motivations on visiting the POIs. In this paper, we propose a contrastive learning framework based on latent preferences (CLLP) for next POI recommendation, which models the latent preference distributions of users at each POI and then yield disentangled latent preference representations. Specifically, we leverage the cross-local and global spatio-temporal contexts to learn POI representations for dynamically modeling user preferences. And we design a novel distillation strategy to make full use of the collaborative signals from other users for representation optimization. Then, we disentangle multiple latent preferences in POI representations using predefined preference prototypes, while leveraging preference-level contrastive learning to encourage independence of different latent preferences by improving the quality of latent preference representation space. Meanwhile, we employ a multi-task training strategy to jointly optimize all parameters. Experimental results on two real-world datasets show that CLLP achieves the state-of-the-art performance and significantly outperforms all existing solutions. Further investigations demonstrate the robustness of CLLP against sparse and noisy data. | Hongli Zhou, Zhihao Jia, Haiyang Zhu, Zhizheng Zhang | Southeast University School of Computer Science and Engineering |

However, there is no publicly available dataset so far and most existing approaches are limited to an extremely small scope of brands, which seriously hinders the research on site recommendation. Therefore, we collect, construct and release an open comprehensive dataset, namely OpenSiteRec, to facilitate and promote the research on site recommendation. Specifically, OpenSiteRec leverages a heterogeneous graph schema to represent various types of real-world entities and relations in four international metropolises. To evaluate the performance of the existing general methods on the site recommendation task, we conduct benchmarking experiments of several representative recommendation models on OpenSiteRec. Furthermore, we also highlight the potential application directions to demonstrate the wide applicability of OpenSiteRec. We believe that our OpenSiteRec dataset is significant and anticipated to encourage the development of advanced methods for site recommendation.

The retrieved documents are then re-ranked by a more effective but expensive ranking model, e.g., a deep neural ranker such as BERT. However, in such a standard pipeline, no new documents are typically discovered after the first stage retrieval. Hence, the amount of exposure that a particular group of documents - e.g., documents from a particular demographic category - can receive is limited by the number of documents that are retrieved in the first stage retrieval. Indeed, if too few documents from a group are retrieved in the first stage retrieval, ensuring that the group receives a fair amount of exposure to the user may become infeasible. Therefore, it is useful to identify more documents from underrepresented groups that are potentially relevant to the query during the re-ranking stage. In this work, we investigate how deploying adaptive re-ranking, which enables the discovery of additional potentially relevant documents in the re-ranking stage, can improve the exposure that a given group of documents receives in the final ranking. We propose six adaptive re-ranking policies that can discover documents from underrepresented groups to increase the disadvantaged groups' exposure in the final ranking. Our experiments on the TREC 2021 and 2022 Fair Ranking Track test collections show that our policies consistently improve the fairness of the exposure distribution in the final ranking, compared to standard adaptive re-ranking approaches, resulting in increases of up to ~13% in Attention Weighted Ranked Fairness (AWRF). Moreover, our best performing policy, Policy 6, consistently maintains and frequently increases the utility of the search results in terms of nDCG. | Thomas Jänich, Graham McDonald, Iadh Ounis | University of Glasgow |

The exploration of redistribution problemshas a long history in economics, offering valuable insights for conceptualizingfair re-ranking as a taxation process. Such a formulation provides us with afresh perspective to re-examine fair re-ranking and inspire the development ofnew methods. From a taxation perspective, we theoretically demonstrate thatmost previous fair re-ranking methods can be reformulated as an item-level taxpolicy. Ideally, a good tax policy should be effective and convenientlycontrollable to adjust ranking resources. However, both empirical andtheoretical analyses indicate that the previous item-level tax policy cannotmeet two ideal controllable requirements: (1) continuity, ensuring minorchanges in tax rates result in small accuracy and fairness shifts; (2)controllability over accuracy loss, ensuring precise estimation of the accuracyloss under a specific tax rate. To overcome these challenges, we introduce anew fair re-ranking method named Tax-rank, which levies taxes based on thedifference in utility between two items. Then, we efficiently optimize such anobjective by utilizing the Sinkhorn algorithm in optimal transport. Upon acomprehensive analysis, Our model Tax-rank offers a superior tax policy forfair re-ranking, theoretically demonstrating both continuity andcontrollability over accuracy loss. Experimental results show that Tax-rankoutperforms all state-of-the-art baselines in terms of effectiveness andefficiency on recommendation and advertising tasks. | Chen Xu, Xiaopeng Ye, Wenjie Wang, Liang Pang, Jun Xu, TatSeng Chua | Institute of Computing Technology; Renmin University of China; National University of Singapore |

Worker recruitment is a core issue in SC, for which most state-of-the-art algorithms focus on designing incentive mechanisms based on the existing SC worker pool. However, they may fail when the number of SC workers is not enough, especially for the new SC platforms. In recent years, social networks have been found to be helpful for worker recruitment by selecting seed workers to spread the task information so as to inspire more social users to participate, but how to select seed workers remains a challenge. Existing methods typically require numerous iterative searches leading to inefficiency in facing the big picture and failing to cope with dynamic environments. In the paper, we formulate the Effective Coverage Maximization (ECM) problem. We prove that the ECM problem is NP-hard and propose a novel worker recruitment method combined with the dual-embedding and Rainbow Deep Q-network (DQN), which is called DQNSelector. The dual-embedding extracts long-range social influence information from the social network and near-range coverage quality information from the geographic information map using the inner-product method and our proposed efficient Path Increment Iterative Calculation (PIIC) algorithm respectively. We then combine the dual embedding to design a Rainbow DQN-based reinforcement learning model so as to select seed workers. Extensive experiments and ablation studies based on real-world datasets verify the superiority of DQNSelector. | Yucen Gao, Wei Liu, Jianxiong Guo, Xiaofeng Gao, Guihai Chen | Peking University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Beijing Normal University |

Existing community search algorithms often adopt community models to find target communities, and k-truss model is a popularly used one that provides structural constraints. However, the structural constraints presented by k-truss is so tight that the searching algorithm often can not find the target communities. There always exist some subgraphs that may not conform to k-truss structure but do have cohesive characteristics to meet users' personalized requirements. Moreover, the k-truss based community search algorithms can not meet users' real-time demands on large graphs. To address the above problems, this paper proposes the relaxed k-truss community search problem for the first time. Then we construct a relaxed k-truss index, which can help to find cohesive communities in linear time and provide flexible searching for nested communities. We also design an index maintenance algorithm to dynamically update the index. Furthermore, a community search algorithm based on the relaxed k-truss index is presented. Extensive experimental results on real datasets prove the effectiveness and efficiency of our model and algorithms. | Xiaoqin Xie, Shuangyuan Liu, Jiaqi Zhang, Shuai Han, Wei Wang, Wu Yang | Harbin Engineering University College of Computer Science and Technology |

However, KGE methodsmay learn biased representations on low-quality KGs that are prevalent in thereal world. Some recent studies propose adversarial attacks to investigate thevulnerabilities of KGE methods, but their attackers are target-oriented withthe KGE method and the target triples to predict are given in advance, whichlacks practicability. In this work, we explore untargeted attacks with the aimof reducing the global performances of KGE methods over a set of unknown testtriples and conducting systematic analyses on KGE robustness. Considering logicrules can effectively summarize the global structure of a KG, we developrule-based attack strategies to enhance the attack efficiency. In particular,weconsider adversarial deletion which learns rules, applying the rules to scoretriple importance and delete important triples, and adversarial addition whichcorrupts the learned rules and applies them for negative triples asperturbations. Extensive experiments on two datasets over three representativeclasses of KGE methods demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed untargetedattacks in diminishing the link prediction results. And we also find thatdifferent KGE methods exhibit different robustness to untargeted attacks.

Recently, the advent of Large LanguageModels (LLMs) has sparked interest in leveraging them for sequentialrecommendation, viewing it as language modeling. Previous studies representitems within LLMs' input prompts as either ID indices or textual metadata.However, these approaches often fail to either encapsulate comprehensive worldknowledge or exhibit sufficient behavioral understanding. To combine thecomplementary strengths of conventional recommenders in capturing behavioralpatterns of users and LLMs in encoding world knowledge about items, weintroduce Large Language-Recommendation Assistant (LLaRA). Specifically, ituses a novel hybrid prompting method that integrates ID-based item embeddingslearned by traditional recommendation models with textual item features.Treating the "sequential behaviors of users" as a distinct modality beyondtexts, we employ a projector to align the traditional recommender's IDembeddings with the LLM's input space. Moreover, rather than directly exposingthe hybrid prompt to LLMs, a curriculum learning strategy is adopted togradually ramp up training complexity. Initially, we warm up the LLM usingtext-only prompts, which better suit its inherent language modeling ability.Subsequently, we progressively transition to the hybrid prompts, training themodel to seamlessly incorporate the behavioral knowledge from the traditionalsequential recommender into the LLM. Empirical results validate theeffectiveness of our proposed framework.

Large language models (LLMs) have showncapabilities in commonsense reasoning and leveraging external tools that mayhelp address these challenges. However, existing LLM-based RSs suffer fromhallucinations, misalignment between the semantic space of items and thebehavior space of users, or overly simplistic control strategies (e.g., whetherto rank or directly present existing results). To bridge these gap, weintroduce ToolRec, a framework for LLM-empowered recommendations via toollearning that uses LLMs as surrogate users, thereby guiding the recommendationprocess and invoking external tools to generate a recommendation list thataligns closely with users' nuanced preferences. We formulate the recommendation process as a process aimed at exploring userinterests in attribute granularity. The process factors in the nuances of thecontext and user preferences. The LLM then invokes external tools based on auser's attribute instructions and probes different segments of the item pool.We consider two types of attribute-oriented tools: rank tools and retrievaltools. Through the integration of LLMs, ToolRec enables conventionalrecommender systems to become external tools with a natural language interface.Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of ToolRec, particularly inscenarios that are rich in semantic content. | Yuyue Zhao, Jiancan Wu, Xiang Wang, Wei Tang, Dingxian Wang, Maarten de Rijke | University of Science and Technology of China, University of Amsterdam; University of Technology Sydney; University of Science and Technology of China School of Data Science; University of Amsterdam; University of Science and Technology of China |

It generally utilizesadditional Transformer decoder blocks to provide sustainable supervisionsignals and compress contextual information into dense representations.However, the underlying reasons for the effectiveness of such a pre-trainingtechnique remain unclear. The usage of additional Transformer-based decodersalso incurs significant computational costs. In this study, we aim to shedlight on this issue by revealing that masked auto-encoder (MAE) pre-trainingwith enhanced decoding significantly improves the term coverage of input tokensin dense representations, compared to vanilla BERT checkpoints. Building uponthis observation, we propose a modification to the traditional MAE by replacingthe decoder of a masked auto-encoder with a completely simplified Bag-of-Wordprediction task. This modification enables the efficient compression of lexicalsignals into dense representations through unsupervised pre-training.Remarkably, our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performanceon several large-scale retrieval benchmarks without requiring any additionalparameters, which provides a 67auto-encoder pre-training with enhanced decoding. | Guangyuan Ma, Xing Wu, Zijia Lin, Songlin Hu | Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Tsinghua University |

Addressing this challenge, we envision a recommendationsimulator, capitalizing on recent breakthroughs in human-level intelligenceexhibited by Large Language Models (LLMs). We propose Agent4Rec, a usersimulator in recommendation, leveraging LLM-empowered generative agentsequipped with user profile, memory, and actions modules specifically tailoredfor the recommender system. In particular, these agents' profile modules areinitialized using real-world datasets (e.g. MovieLens, Steam, Amazon-Book),capturing users' unique tastes and social traits; memory modules log bothfactual and emotional memories and are integrated with an emotion-drivenreflection mechanism; action modules support a wide variety of behaviors,spanning both taste-driven and emotion-driven actions. Each agent interactswith personalized recommender models in a page-by-page manner, relying on apre-implemented collaborative filtering-based recommendation algorithm. Wedelve into both the capabilities and limitations of Agent4Rec, aiming toexplore an essential research question: “To what extent can LLM-empoweredgenerative agents faithfully simulate the behavior of real, autonomous humansin recommender systems?” Extensive and multi-faceted evaluations of Agent4Rechighlight both the alignment and deviation between agents and user-personalizedpreferences.

Prior work has demonstrated that generative retrieval withatomic identifiers is equivalent to single-vector dense retrieval. Accordingly,generative retrieval exhibits behavior analogous to hierarchical search withina tree index in dense retrieval when using hierarchical semantic identifiers.However, prior work focuses solely on the retrieval stage without consideringthe deep interactions within the decoder of generative retrieval. In this paper, we fill this gap by demonstrating that generative retrievaland multi-vector dense retrieval share the same framework for measuring therelevance to a query of a document. Specifically, we examine the attentionlayer and prediction head of generative retrieval, revealing that generativeretrieval can be understood as a special case of multi-vector dense retrieval.Both methods compute relevance as a sum of products of query and documentvectors and an alignment matrix. We then explore how generative retrievalapplies this framework, employing distinct strategies for computing documenttoken vectors and the alignment matrix. We have conducted experiments to verifyour conclusions and show that both paradigms exhibit commonalities of termmatching in their alignment matrix. | Shiguang Wu, Wenda Wei, Mengqi Zhang, Zhumin Chen, Jun Ma, Zhaochun Ren, Maarten de Rijke, Pengjie Ren | Shandong University; Leiden University; University of Amsterdam |

Ideally these come from real searchers, but it is hard to collect this data at scale, so typical experiments rely on third-party labellers who may or may not produce accurate annotations. Label quality is managed with ongoing auditing, training, and monitoring. We discuss an alternative approach. We take careful feedback from real searchers and use this to select a large language model (LLM), and prompt, that agrees with this feedback; the LLM can then produce labels at scale. Our experiments show LLMs are as accurate as human labellers and as useful for finding the best systems and hardest queries. LLM performance varies with prompt features, but also varies unpredictably with simple paraphrases. This unpredictability reinforces the need for high-quality "gold" labels. | Paul Thomas, Seth Spielman, Nick Craswell, Bhaskar Mitra | Microsoft |

Traditional methods relying on passage-level judgments are no longer effective due to the diversity of responses generated by LLM-based systems. We provide a workbench to explore several alternative evaluation approaches to judge the relevance of a system's response that incorporate LLMs: 1. Asking an LLM whether the response is relevant; 2. Asking the LLM which set of nuggets (i.e., relevant key facts) is covered in the response; 3. Asking the LLM to answer a set of exam questions with the response. This workbench aims to facilitate the development of new, reusable test collections. Researchers can manually refine sets of nuggets and exam questions, observing their impact on system evaluation and leaderboard rankings.

A generative retrieval system returns a grounded generated text in response to an information need instead of the traditional document ranking. Quantifying the utility of these types of responses is essential for evaluating generative retrieval systems. As the established evaluation methodology for ranking-based ad hoc retrieval may seem unsuitable for generative retrieval, new approaches for reliable, repeatable, and reproducible experimentation are required. In this paper, we survey the relevant information retrieval and natural language processing literature, identify search tasks and system architectures in generative retrieval, develop a corresponding user model, and study its operationalization. This theoretical analysis provides a foundation and new insights for the evaluation of generative ad hoc retrieval systems. | Lukas Gienapp, Harrisen Scells, Niklas Deckers, Janek Bevendorff, Shuai Wang, Johannes Kiesel, Shahbaz Syed, Maik Fröbe, Guido Zuccon, Benno Stein, Matthias Hagen, Martin Potthast | University of Kassel & hessian.AI, Kassel, Germany; Leipzig University & ScaDS.AI, Leipzig, Germany; Leipzig University, Leipzig, Germany; Bauhaus-Universität Weimar, Weimar, Germany; Friedrich-Schiller-Universität Jena, Jena, Germany |

Specifically, we investigate 1) datafiltering and refinement, 2) video input type selection, 3) temporal modeling,and 4) video feature enhancement. We then summarize this empirical study intothe M2-RAAP recipe, where our technical contributions lie in 1) the datafiltering and text re-writing pipeline resulting in 1M high-quality bilingualvideo-text pairs, 2) the replacement of video inputs with key-frames toaccelerate pre-training, and 3) the Auxiliary-Caption-Guided (ACG) strategy toenhance video features. We conduct extensive experiments by adapting threeimage-text foundation models on two refined video-text datasets from differentlanguages, validating the robustness and reproducibility of M2-RAAP foradaptation-based pre-training.

While current methods treat this as a query-targetmatching problem, we argue that CIR triplets contain additional associationsbeyond this primary relation. In our paper, we identify two new relationswithin triplets, treating each triplet as a graph node. Firstly, we introducethe concept of text-bridged image alignment, where the query text serves as abridge between the query image and the target image. We propose a hinge-basedcross-attention mechanism to incorporate this relation into network learning.Secondly, we explore complementary text reasoning, considering CIR as a form ofcross-modal retrieval where two images compose to reason about complementarytext. To integrate these perspectives effectively, we design a twinattention-based compositor. By combining these complementary associations withthe explicit query pair-target image relation, we establish a comprehensive setof constraints for CIR. Our framework, CaLa (Complementary Association Learningfor Augmenting Composed Image Retrieval), leverages these insights. We evaluateCaLa on CIRR and FashionIQ benchmarks with multiple backbones, demonstratingits superiority in composed image retrieval. | Xintong Jiang, Yaxiong Wang, Mengjian Li, Yujiao Wu, Bingwen Hu, Xueming Qian | Xi'an Jiaotong University; Anhui University of Technology; Xi'an Jiaotong University School of Software; CSRIO; Zhejiang Lab; Hefei University of Technology |

Although Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, they exhibit limitations inhandling large-scale, diverse, and ambiguous real-world needs of retrieval, dueto the computation cost and the injective embeddings they produce. This paperpresents a two-stage Coarse-to-Fine Index-shared Retrieval (CFIR) framework,designed for fast and effective large-scale long-text to image retrieval. Thefirst stage, Entity-based Ranking (ER), adapts to long-text query ambiguity byemploying a multiple-queries-to-multiple-targets paradigm, facilitatingcandidate filtering for the next stage. The second stage, Summary-basedRe-ranking (SR), refines these rankings using summarized queries. We alsopropose a specialized Decoupling-BEiT-3 encoder, optimized for handlingambiguous user needs and both stages, which also enhances computationalefficiency through vector-based similarity inference. Evaluation on the AToMiCdataset reveals that CFIR surpasses existing MLLMs by up to 11.06Recall@1000, while reducing training and retrieval times by 68.75respectively.

This relevance is referred to as the case-to-case reference relation. Toefficiently find relevant cases from a large case pool, retrieval tools arewidely used by legal practitioners. Existing legal case retrieval models mainlywork by comparing the text representations of individual cases. Although theyobtain a decent retrieval accuracy, the intrinsic case connectivityrelationships among cases have not been well exploited for case encoding,therefore limiting the further improvement of retrieval performance. In a casepool, there are three types of case connectivity relationships: the casereference relationship, the case semantic relationship, and the case legalcharge relationship. Due to the inductive manner in the task of legal caseretrieval, using case reference as input is not applicable for testing. Thus,in this paper, a CaseLink model based on inductive graph learning is proposedto utilise the intrinsic case connectivity for legal case retrieval, a novelGlobal Case Graph is incorporated to represent both the case semanticrelationship and the case legal charge relationship. A novel contrastiveobjective with a regularisation on the degree of case nodes is proposed toleverage the information carried by the case reference relationship to optimisethe model. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two benchmark datasets,which demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of CaseLink.

In practice, determining whether two documents sharethe same judgments is essential for establishing their relevance in legalretrieval. However, existing legal retrieval studies either ignore the vitalrole of judgment prediction or rely on implicit training objectives, expectinga proper alignment of legal documents in vector space based on their judgments.Neither approach provides explicit evidence of judgment consistency forrelevance modeling, leading to inaccuracies and a lack of transparency inretrieval. To address this issue, we propose a law-guided method, namely GEAR,within the generative retrieval framework. GEAR explicitly integrates judgmentprediction with legal document retrieval in a sequence-to-sequence manner.Experiments on two Chinese legal case retrieval datasets show the superiorityof GEAR over state-of-the-art methods while maintaining competitive judgmentprediction performance. Moreover, we validate its robustness across languagesand domains on a French statutory article retrieval dataset. | Weicong Qin, Zelin Cao, Weijie Yu, Zihua Si, Sirui Chen, Jun Xu | Renmin University of China Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence; University of International Business and Economics School of Information Technology and Management; University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign |

In addition to contextual information, personality traits also affect emotional perception. However, current MERC methods solely consider the personality influence of speakers, neglecting speaker-addressee interaction patterns. Additionally, the bottleneck problem of Emotion Shift (ES), where consecutive utterances by the same speaker exhibit different emotions has been long neglected in MERC. Early ES research fails to distinguish diverse shift patterns and simply introduces whether shifts occur as knowledge into the MERC model without considering the complementary nature of the two tasks. Based on this, we propose a Persona-infused Cross-task Graph Network (PCGNet). It first models the speaker-addressee interactive relationships by the persona-infused refinement network. Then, it learns the auxiliary task of ES Detection and the main task of MERC using cross-task connections to capture correlations across two tasks. Finally, we introduce shift-aware contrastive learning to discern diverse shift patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that PCGNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two widely used datasets. | Geng Tu, Feng Xiong, Bin Liang, Ruifeng Xu | Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China; The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China |

Although current studies significantly understand human intention consistency, they struggle with undesired repetitive outcomes that need resolution. We make two pivotal discoveries using statistical analyses and experimental designs: (1) The occurrence of repetitions is intricately linked to the models and decoding strategies. (2) During training and decoding, adding perturbations to logits can reduce repetition. Motivated by these observations, we introduce AR-Trip (Anti Repetition for Trip Recommendation), which incorporates a cycle-aware predictor comprising three mechanisms to avoid duplicate Points-of-Interest (POIs) and demonstrates their effectiveness in alleviating repetition. Experiments on four public datasets illustrate that AR-Trip successfully mitigates repetition issues while enhancing precision. | Wenzheng Shu, Kangqi Xu, Wenxin Tai, Ting Zhong, Yong Wang, Fan Zhou | Hong Kong University of Science and Technology; University of Electronic Science and Technology of China |

This paper proposes a cluster-based partial dense retrieval scheme guided by sparse retrieval results to optimize fusion between dense and sparse retrieval at a low space and CPU-time cost while retaining a competitive relevance. This scheme exploits the overlap of sparse retrieval results and document embedding clusters, and judiciously selects a limited number of clusters to probabilistically guarantee the inclusion of top sparse results. This paper provides an evaluation of this scheme on its in-domain and zero-shot retrieval performance for the MS MARCO and BEIR datasets. | Yingrui Yang, Parker Carlson, Shanxiu He, Yifan Qiao, Tao Yang | University of California, Santa Barbara; University of California at Santa Barbara |

Iterative approaches, such as iterativerelevance feedback and uncertainty sampling, are shown to be effective undervarious operational scenarios. Despite neural models demonstrating success inother text-related tasks, linear models such as logistic regression, ingeneral, are still more effective and efficient in HRR since the model istrained and retrieves documents from the same fixed collection. In this work,we leverage SPLADE, an efficient retrieval model that transforms documents intocontextualized sparse vectors, for HRR. Our approach combines the best of bothworlds, leveraging both the contextualization from pretrained language modelsand the efficiency of linear models.

In this paper, we propose a straightforward yet effective approach for cross-modal feature embedding, specifically targeting the correlation between facial and voice association. Previous studies have examined cross-modal association tasks in order to establish the relationship between voice clips and facial images. Previous studies have examined the issue of cross-modal discrimination; however, they have not adequately recognized the importance of managing the heterogeneity in inter-modal features between audio and video. As a result, there is a significant prevalence of false positives and false negatives. To address the issue, the proposed method learns the embeddings of cross-modal features by introducing an additional feature that bridges the gap between these features. This facilitates the embedding of voice and face features belonging to the same individual within a convex hull. Through the utilization of cross-modal feature learning, cross-modal attention particularly reduces inter-class variance, resulting in a notable enhancement of the clustering power. We comprehensively evaluated our approach on cross-modal verification, matching, and retrieval tasks using the large-scale VoxCeleb dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves notable improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods. | Jiwoo Kang, Taewan Kim, YoungHo Park | Sookmyung Women's University; Dongduk Women's University |

Conventional methods predict the relevance solely based oninstance-level semantic features and neglect the diverse legal factors (LFs),which are associated with diverse court judgments. Consequently,comprehensively representing a criminal case remains a challenge for theseapproaches. Moreover, extracting and utilizing these LFs for criminal casematching face two challenges: (1) the manual annotations of LFs rely heavily onspecialized legal knowledge; (2) overlaps among LFs may potentially harm themodel's performance. In this paper, we propose a two-stage framework namedDiverse Legal Factor-enhanced Criminal Case Matching (DLF-CCM). Firstly,DLF-CCM employs a multi-task learning framework to pre-train an LF extractionnetwork on a large-scale legal judgment prediction dataset. In stage two,DLF-CCM introduces an LF de-redundancy module to learn shared LF and exclusiveLFs. Moreover, an entropy-weighted fusion strategy is introduced to dynamicallyfuse the multiple relevance generated by all LFs. Experimental results validatethe effectiveness of DLF-CCM and show its significant improvements overcompetitive baselines.

Traditional end-to-endevaluation methods are computationally expensive. Furthermore, evaluation ofthe retrieval model's performance based on query-document relevance labelsshows a small correlation with the RAG system's downstream performance. Wepropose a novel evaluation approach, eRAG, where each document in the retrievallist is individually utilized by the large language model within the RAGsystem. The output generated for each document is then evaluated based on thedownstream task ground truth labels. In this manner, the downstream performancefor each document serves as its relevance label. We employ various downstreamtask metrics to obtain document-level annotations and aggregate them usingset-based or ranking metrics. Extensive experiments on a wide range of datasetsdemonstrate that eRAG achieves a higher correlation with downstream RAGperformance compared to baseline methods, with improvements in Kendall's τcorrelation ranging from 0.168 to 0.494. Additionally, eRAG offers significantcomputational advantages, improving runtime and consuming up to 50 times lessGPU memory than end-to-end evaluation. | Alireza Salemi, Hamed Zamani | University of Massachusetts Amherst |

Nevertheless, the indexes generated bythese systems exhibit significant deviations from the ones that use traditionalretrieval models, leading to a discrepancy in the performance of existing queryoptimizations that were specifically developed for traditional structures.These disparities arise from structural variations in query and documentstatistics, including sub-word tokenization, leading to longer queries, smallervocabularies, and different score distributions within posting lists. Thispaper introduces Block-Max Pruning (BMP), an innovative dynamic pruningstrategy tailored for indexes arising in learned sparse retrieval environments.BMP employs a block filtering mechanism to divide the document space intosmall, consecutive document ranges, which are then aggregated and sorted on thefly, and fully processed only as necessary, guided by a defined safe earlytermination criterion or based on approximate retrieval requirements. Throughrigorous experimentation, we show that BMP substantially outperforms existingdynamic pruning strategies, offering unparalleled efficiency in safe retrievalcontexts and improved tradeoffs between precision and efficiency in approximateretrieval tasks. | Antonio Mallia, Torsten Suel, Nicola Tonellotto | University of Pisa; Pinecone; New York University |

In this study, we leverage LLMs directly to serve as components in the widely used multi-stage text ranking pipeline. Specifically, we fine-tune the open-source LLaMA-2 model as a dense retriever (repLLaMA) and a pointwise reranker (rankLLaMA). This is performed for both passage and document retrieval tasks using the MS MARCO training data. Our study shows that finetuned LLM retrieval models outperform smaller models. They are more effective and exhibit greater generalizability, requiring only a straightforward training strategy. Moreover, our pipeline allows for the fine-tuning of LLMs at each stage of a multi-stage retrieval pipeline. This demonstrates the strong potential for optimizing LLMs to enhance a variety of retrieval tasks. Furthermore, as LLMs are naturally pre-trained with longer contexts, they can directly represent longer documents. This eliminates the need for heuristic segmenting and pooling strategies to rank long documents. On the MS MARCO and BEIR datasets, our repLLaMA-rankLLaMA pipeline demonstrates a high level of effectiveness. | Xueguang Ma, Liang Wang, Nan Yang, Furu Wei, Jimmy Lin | Microsoft Research Asia; University of Waterloo |

Recently, self-supervised learning (SSL) has gained widespread adoption for social recommender. However, most existing methods exhibit poor robustness when faced with sparse user behavior data and are susceptible to inevitable social noise. To overcome the aforementioned limitations, we introduce a new Graph Diffusive Self-Supervised Learning (GDSSL) paradigm for social recommendation. Our approach involves the introduction of a guided social graph diffusion model that can adaptively mitigate the impact of social relation noise commonly found in real-world scenarios. This model progressively introduces random noise to the initial social graph and then iteratively restores it to recover the original structure. Additionally, to enhance robustness against noise and sparsity, we propose graph diffusive self-supervised learning, which utilizes the denoised social relation graph generated by our diffusion model for contrastive learning. The extensive experimental outcomes consistently indicate that our proposed GDSSL outmatches existing advanced solutions in social recommendation. | Jiuqiang Li, Hongjun Wang | Southwest Jiaotong University |

Previous works first rank candidate examples by some metrics and then independently retrieve examples similar to test samples. However, their effectiveness may be discounted because of two limitations: in-context example redundancy and example preference misalignment between retriever and LLM. To alleviate them, we propose a novel framework that sequentially retrieves in-context examples. It not only considers which example is useful for the test sample but also prevents its information from being duplicated by already retrieved examples. Subsequently, we exploit the rewards of LLMs on retrieved in-context examples to optimize parameters for bridging preference gaps. Experiments on four ABSA datasets show that our framework is significantly superior to previous works. | Qianlong Wang, Keyang Ding, Xuan Luo, Ruifeng Xu | Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen |

Recent work has observed that approachessuch as combining ranked lists representing a single document language each orusing multilingual pretrained language models demonstrate a preference for onelanguage over others. This results in systematic unfair treatment of documentsin different languages. This work proposes a language fairness metric toevaluate whether documents across different languages are fairly ranked throughstatistical equivalence testing using the Kruskal-Wallis test. In contrast tomost prior work in group fairness, we do not consider any language to be anunprotected group. Thus our proposed measure, PEER (Probability ofEqualExpected Rank), is the first fairness metric specifically designed tocapture the language fairness of MLIR systems. We demonstrate the behavior ofPEER on artificial ranked lists. We also evaluate real MLIR systems on twopublicly available benchmarks and show that the PEER scores align with prioranalytical findings on MLIR fairness.

In Information Retrieval (IR), stemming is used in keyword-based matching pipelines to normalise text before indexing and query processing to improve subsequent matching between document and query keywords. The use of stemming has been shown to often improve the effectiveness of keyword-matching models such as BM25. However, traditional stemming methods, focusing solely on individual terms, overlook the richness of contextual information. Recognizing this gap, in this paper, we investigate the promising idea of using large language models (LLMs) to stem words by lever-aging its capability of context understanding. With this respect, we identify three avenues, each characterised by different trade-offs in terms of computational cost, effectiveness and robustness : (1) use LLMs to stem the vocabulary for a collection, i.e., the set of unique words that appear in the collection (vocabulary stemming), (2) use LLMs to stem each document separately (contextual stemming), and (3) use LLMs to extract from each document entities that should not be stemmed, then use vocabulary stemming to stem the rest of the terms (entity-based contextual stemming). Through a series of empirical experiments, we compare the use of LLMs for stemming with that of traditional lexical stemmers such as Porter and Krovetz for English text. We find that while vocabulary stemming and contextual stemming fail to achieve higher effectiveness than traditional stemmers, entity-based contextual stemming can achieve a higher effectiveness than using Porter stemmer alone, under specific conditions.

The key to addressing this task is to effectively perform cross-modality alignment between text and images. In this paper, we propose a novel TBPS framework, named Memory-Aided Coarse-to-fine Alignment (MACA), to learn an accurate and reliable alignment between the two modalities. Firstly, we introduce a proposal-based alignment module, which performs contrastive learning to accurately align the textual modality with different pedestrian proposals at a coarse-grained level. Secondly, for the fine-grained alignment, we propose an attribute-based alignment module to mitigate unreliable features by aligning text-wise details with image-wise global features. Moreover, we introduce an intuitive memory bank strategy to supplement useful negative samples for more effective contrastive learning, improving the convergence and generalization ability of the model based on the learned discriminative features. Extensive experiments on CUHK-SYSU-TBPS and PRW-TBPS demonstrate the superiority of MACA over state-of-the-art approaches.

Nonetheless,its capacity for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization has been relativelyunderexplored. In this work, we point out that the traditional optimization ofInfoNCE in GCL restricts the cross-domain pairs only to be negative samples,which inevitably enlarges the distribution gap between different domains. Thisviolates the requirement of domain invariance under OOD scenario andconsequently impairs the model's OOD generalization performance. To addressthis issue, we propose a novel strategy "Negative as Positive", where the mostsemantically similar cross-domain negative pairs are treated as positive duringGCL. Our experimental results, spanning a wide array of datasets, confirm thatthis method substantially improves the OOD generalization performance of GCL. | Zixu Wang, Bingbing Xu, Yige Yuan, Huawei Shen, Xueqi Cheng | Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences |

The optimal choice of a backbone model for a given retrieval task is dependent on the target retrieval domain as well as the pre-training domain of available language models and their generalization capabilities, the availability of relevance judgements, etc. In this work, we study the impact of these factors on retrieval effectiveness for African languages using three multilingual benchmark datasets: Mr. TyDi, MIRACL, and the newly released CIRAL dataset. We compare the effectiveness of mBERT as a backbone for dense retrieval models against multilingual language models such as AfriBERTa and AfroXLMR, which are specialized for African languages. Furthermore, we examine the impact of different training regimes on the effectiveness of dense retrieval in different domains for African languages. Our findings show that the pre-training domain of the backbone LM plays a huge role in retrieval effectiveness, especially in the absence of retrieval training data.

Existing methods often focus on limited cross-modal information within individual micro-videos, overlooking the potential advantages of exploiting vast repository of past videos. We present MMRA, a multi-modal retrieval-augmented popularity prediction model that enhances prediction accuracy using relevant retrieved information. MMRA first retrieves relevant instances from a multi-modal memory bank, aligning video and text through transformation mechanisms involving a vision model and a text-based retriever. Additionally, a multi-modal interaction network is carefully designed to jointly capture cross-modal correlations within the target video and extract informative knowledge through retrieved instances, ultimately enhancing the prediction. Extensive experiments conducted on the real-world micro-video dataset demonstrate the superiority of MMRA when compared to state-of-the-art models.

Modern ranked retrieval techniques are far more capable, but they require that content be either born digital or digitized. For physical content, searching metadata remains the state of the art. This paper seeks to change that, using a textual-edge graph neural network to learn relations between items from available metadata and from any content that has been digitized. Results show that substantial improvement over the best prior method can be achieved. | Tokinori Suzuki, Douglas W. Oard, Emi Ishita, Yoichi Tomiura | Kyushu University; University of Maryland |

However, users are often reluctant to trust recommended results due to the lack of transparency in these systems. While recent work on explaining recommender systems has gained attention, prevailing methods only provide post-hoc explanations based on results or rudimentary explanations according to attention scores. Such limitations hinder reliability and applicability in risk-sensitive scenarios. Inspired by the information theory, we propose a self-explainable framework with an ante-hoc view called ExNext for next POI recommendation aimed at overcoming these limitations. Specifically, we endow self-explainability to POI recommender systems through compact representation learning using a variational information bottleneck approach. The learned representation further improves accuracy by reducing redundancy behind massive spatial-temporal trajectories, which, in turn, boosts the recommendation performance. Experiments on three real-world datasets show significant improvements in both model explainability and recommendation performance. | Kai Yang, Yi Yang, Qiang Gao, Ting Zhong, Yong Wang, Fan Zhou | Hong Kong University of Science and Technology; University of Electronic Science and Technology of China; Southwestern University of Finance and Economics |

Obtaining a diverse set of user queries for test collectionconstruction can be challenging, and acquiring relevance judgments, whichindicate the appropriateness of retrieved documents to a query, is often costlyand resource-intensive. Generating synthetic datasets using Large LanguageModels (LLMs) has recently gained significant attention in variousapplications. In IR, while previous work exploited the capabilities of LLMs togenerate synthetic queries or documents to augment training data and improvethe performance of ranking models, using LLMs for constructing synthetic testcollections is relatively unexplored. Previous studies demonstrate that LLMshave the potential to generate synthetic relevance judgments for use in theevaluation of IR systems. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate whetherit is possible to use LLMs to construct fully synthetic test collections bygenerating not only synthetic judgments but also synthetic queries. Inparticular, we analyse whether it is possible to construct reliable synthetictest collections and the potential risks of bias such test collections mayexhibit towards LLM-based models. Our experiments indicate that using LLMs itis possible to construct synthetic test collections that can reliably be usedfor retrieval evaluation. | Hossein A.

Efficient lateinteraction retrieval is based on an optimized multi-step strategy, where anapproximate search first identifies a set of candidate documents to re-rankexactly. In this work, we introduce SPLATE, a simple and lightweight adaptationof the ColBERTv2 model which learns an “MLM adapter”, mapping its frozentoken embeddings to a sparse vocabulary space with a partially learned SPLADEmodule. This allows us to perform the candidate generation step in lateinteraction pipelines with traditional sparse retrieval techniques, making itparticularly appealing for running ColBERT in CPU environments. Our SPLATEColBERTv2 pipeline achieves the same effectiveness as the PLAID ColBERTv2engine by re-ranking 50 documents that can be retrieved under 10ms. | Thibault Formal, Stéphane Clinchant, Hervé Déjean, Carlos Lassance | Naver Labs Europe; Cohere |

Stochastic RAG casts the retrieval process in RAG as a stochastic sampling without replacement process. Through this formulation, we employ straight-through Gumbel-top-k that provides a differentiable approximation for sampling without replacement and enables effective end-to-end optimization for RAG. We conduct extensive experiments on seven diverse datasets on a wide range of tasks, from open-domain question answering to fact verification to slot-filling for relation extraction and to dialogue systems. By applying this optimization method to a recent and effective RAG model, we advance state-of-the-art results on six out of seven datasets. | Hamed Zamani, Michael Bendersky | Google; University of Massachusetts Amherst |
| 243 |  |  [The Surprising Effectiveness of Rankers trained on Expanded Queries](https://doi.org/10.1145/3626772.3657938) |  | 0 | An significant challenge in text-ranking systems is handling hard queries that form the tail end of the query distribution. Difficulty may arise due to the presence of uncommon, underspecified, or incomplete queries. In this work, we improve the ranking performance of hard or difficult queries while maintaining the performance of other queries. Firstly, we do LLM-based query enrichment for training queries using relevant documents. Next, a specialized ranker is fine-tuned only on the enriched hard queries instead of the original queries. We combine the relevance scores from the specialized ranker and the base ranker, along with a query performance score estimated for each query. Our approach departs from existing methods that usually employ a single ranker for all queries, which is biased towards easy queries, which form the majority of the query distribution. In our extensive experiments on the DL-Hard dataset, we find that a principled query performance based scoring method using base and specialized ranker offers a significant improvement of up to 48.4% on the document ranking task and up to 25% on the passage ranking task compared to the baseline performance of using original queries, even outperforming SOTA model. | Abhijit Anand, Venktesh V, Vinay Setty, Avishek Anand | University of Stavanger; TU Delft; L3S Research Institute |

However, conventional GF-based CFapproaches mostly perform matrix decomposition on the item-item similaritygraph to realize the ideal LPF, which results in a non-trivial computationalcost and thus makes them less practical in scenarios where rapidrecommendations are essential. In this paper, we propose Turbo-CF, a GF-basedCF method that is both training-free and matrix decomposition-free. Turbo-CFemploys a polynomial graph filter to circumvent the issue of expensive matrixdecompositions, enabling us to make full use of modern computer hardwarecomponents (i.e., GPU). Specifically, Turbo-CF first constructs an item-itemsimilarity graph whose edge weights are effectively regulated. Then, our ownpolynomial LPFs are designed to retain only low-frequency signals withoutexplicit matrix decompositions. We demonstrate that Turbo-CF is extremely fastyet accurate, achieving a runtime of less than 1 second on real-world benchmarkdatasets while achieving recommendation accuracies comparable to bestcompetitors. | JinDuk Park, YongMin Shin, WonYong Shin | Yonsei University |
| 245 |  |  [Unifying Graph Retrieval and Prompt Tuning for Graph-Grounded Text Classification](https://doi.org/10.1145/3626772.3657934) |  | 0 | Text classification has long time been researched as a fundamental problem in information retrieval. Since text data are frequently connected with graph structures, it poses new possibilities for a more accurate and explainable classification. One common approach of this graph-text integration is to consider text as graph attributes and utilize GNNs to conduct a node classification task. While both text and graph data are modeled, GNNs treat text in a rather coarse-grained way, have limitations in preserving the detailed structures of a graph, and are less robust to graph sparsity. In this paper, we propose to take an alternative perspective instead, viewing graph as the context of texts, as enlightened by retrieval augmented generation. We propose a novel framework called Graph Retrieval Prompt Tuning (GRPT), consisting of a Graph Retrieval Module and a Prompt Tuning Module integrated with graph context. For graph retrieval, two retrieval strategies are designed to retrieve node context and path context, preserving both node proximity and detailed connectivity patterns. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show the effectiveness of our framework in both standard supervised and sparse settings. | Le Dai, Yu Yin, Enhong Chen, Hui Xiong | The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou); University of Science and Technology of China School of Data Science; University of Science and Technology of China Department of Computer Science and Technology; University of Science and Technology of China |

A tight distribution matching between the teacher and student models can be hard as over-calibration may degrade training effectiveness when a teacher does not perform well. This paper contrastively reweights KL divergence terms to prioritize the alignment between a student and a teacher model for proper separation of positive and negative documents. This paper analyzes and evaluates the proposed loss function on the MS MARCO and BEIR datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the relevance of tested student models. | Yingrui Yang, Yifan Qiao, Shanxiu He, Tao Yang |  |

However, their potential to enhance math information retrieval remains largely unexplored. This paper investigates the use of two large language models, LLaMA-2 and Orca-2 for three tasks in math information retrieval. First, the study explores the use of these models for relevance assessment, evaluating the relevance of answers to math questions. Then, the application of these models for math data augmentation is studied. Using the existing math information retrieval test collection, ARQMath, answers of different relevance degrees are generated for each topic. These answers are then used for fine-tuning a cross-encoder re-ranker and are compared against fine-tuning with answers that are manually labeled. Finally, the use of these models for ranking candidate answers to math questions is explored. The experimental results indicate that, while these models may not be effective for relevance assessment and ranking tasks, Orca-2 can be a valuable resource for math data augmentation. | Behrooz Mansouri, Reihaneh Maarefdoust | University of Southern Maine |

People can easily share their life experiences and thoughts with relatives and friends via instant messaging software. As time passes, individuals may forget certain details of life events, leading to difficulties in effectively communicating with others. The propensity of individuals to forget or mix up life events highlights the importance of services aimed at retrieving information about past experiences. This paper presents a conversational information recall system, ConvLogRecaller, which proactively supports real-time memory recall assistance during online conversations. Given a conversation of the user with others, ConvLogRecaller suggests a message if the user forgets the details of the life experiences. The services provided by our system can avoid hesitations or memory lapses that might hinder the efficiency of a conversation. | YuanChi Lee, AnZi Yen, HenHsen Huang, HsinHsi Chen | National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University; National Taiwan University; Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica |

These models enable thefusion of various modalities, such as text and images. One significant outcomeof CLIP is its capability to allow users to search for images using text as aquery, as well as vice versa. This is achieved via a joint embedding of imagesand text data that can, for instance, be used to search for similar items.Despite efficient query processing techniques such as approximate nearestneighbor search, the results may lack precision and completeness. We introduceCLIP-Branches, a novel text-image search engine built upon the CLIParchitecture. Our approach enhances traditional text-image search engines byincorporating an interactive fine-tuning phase, which allows the user tofurther concretize the search query by iteratively defining positive andnegative examples. Our framework involves training a classification model giventhe additional user feedback and essentially outputs all positively classifiedinstances of the entire data catalog. By building upon recent techniques, thisinference phase, however, is not implemented by scanning the entire datacatalog, but by employing efficient index structures pre-built for the data.Our results show that the fine-tuned results can improve the initial searchoutputs in terms of relevance and accuracy while maintaining swift responsetimes | Christian Lülf, Denis Mayr Lima Martins, Marcos Antonio Vaz Salles, Yongluan Zhou, Fabian Gieseke | Independent Researcher; University of Copenhagen; University of Münster |

Traditional methods typically employ either classification-dividing the Earth's surface into grid cells and classifying images accordingly, or retrieval-identifying locations by matching images with a database of image-location pairs. However, classification-based approaches are limited by the cell size and cannot yield precise predictions, while retrieval-based systems usually suffer from poor search quality and inadequate coverage of the global landscape at varied scale and aggregation levels. To overcome these drawbacks, we present Img2Loc, a novel system that redefines image geolocalization as a text generation task. This is achieved using cutting-edge large multi-modality models (LMMs) like GPT-4V or LLaVA with retrieval augmented generation. Img2Loc first employs CLIP-based representations to generate an image-based coordinate query database. It then uniquely combines query results with images itself, forming elaborate prompts customized for LMMs. When tested on benchmark datasets such as Im2GPS3k and YFCC4k, Img2Loc not only surpasses the performance of previous state-of-the-art models but does so without any model training.

When combined with graph embedding techniques, such as graph neural networks (GNNs), knowledge graphs become a potent tool in providing valuable insights. This study explores the application of graph embedding in identifying competitors from a financial knowledge graph. Existing state-of-the-art(SOTA) models face challenges due to the unique attributes of our knowledge graph, including directed and undirected relationships, attributed nodes, and minimal annotated competitor connections. To address these challenges, we propose a novel graph embedding model, JPEC(JPMorgan Proximity Embedding for Competitor Detection), which utilizes graph neural network to learn from both first-order and second-order node proximity together with vital features for competitor retrieval. JPEC had outperformed most existing models in extensive experiments, showcasing its effectiveness in competitor retrieval. | Wanying Ding, Manoj Cherukumalli, Santosh Chikoti, Vinay K.

Recognizing the current gap in leveraging agent capabilities for multi-agent collaboration in recommendation systems, we introduce MACRec, a novel framework designed to enhance recommendation systems through multi-agent collaboration. Unlike existing work on using agents for user/item simulation, we aim to deploy multi-agents to tackle recommendation tasks directly. In our framework, recommendation tasks are addressed through the collaborative efforts of various specialized agents, including Manager, User/Item Analyst, Reflector, Searcher, and Task Interpreter, with different working flows. Furthermore, we provide application examples of how developers can easily use MACRec on various recommendation tasks, including rating prediction, sequential recommendation, conversational recommendation, and explanation generation of recommendation results.

One of the key issues to realizing model reuse resides in efficiently and accurately finding the target models that meet user needs from a model repository. However, the existing popular model-sharing platforms (e.g., Hugging Face) mainly support model retrieval based on model name matching and task filtering. If not familiar with the platform or specific models, users may suffer from low retrieval efficiency and a less user-friendly interaction experience. To address these issues, we have developed ModelGalaxy, a versatile model retrieval platform supporting multiple model retrieval methods, including keyword-based search, dataset-based search, and user-task-centric search. Moreover, ModelGalaxy leverages the power of large language models to provide users with easily retrieving and using models.

This effectively reduces the trust and confidence of end users in LLM-based applications, including Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for Question Answering (QA) tasks. In this work, we introduce RAG-Ex, a model- and language-agnostic explanation framework that presents approximate explanations to the users revealing why the LLMs possibly generated a piece of text as a response, given the user input. Our framework is compatible with both open-source and proprietary LLMs. We report the significance scores of the approximated explanations from our generic explainer in both English and German QA tasks and also study their correlation with the downstream performance of LLMs. In the extensive user studies, our explainer yields an F1-score of 76.9% against the end user annotations and attains almost on-par performance with model-intrinsic approaches. | Viju Sudhi, Sinchana Ramakanth Bhat, Max Rudat, Roman Teucher | Fraunhofer IAIS |

While it is highlyrecommended that applicants tailor their resume to the specific role they areapplying for, manually tailoring resumes to job descriptions and role-specificrequirements is often (1) extremely time-consuming, and (2) prone to humanerrors. Furthermore, performing such a tailoring step at scale while applyingto several roles may result in a lack of quality of the edited resumes. Totackle this problem, in this demo paper, we propose ResumeFlow: a LargeLanguage Model (LLM) aided tool that enables an end user to simply providetheir detailed resume and the desired job posting, and obtain a personalizedresume specifically tailored to that specific job posting in the matter of afew seconds. Our proposed pipeline leverages the language understanding andinformation extraction capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs such as OpenAI'sGPT-4 and Google's Gemini, in order to (1) extract details from a jobdescription, (2) extract role-specific details from the user-provided resume,and then (3) use these to refine and generate a role-specific resume for theuser. Our easy-to-use tool leverages the user-chosen LLM in a completelyoff-the-shelf manner, thus requiring no fine-tuning. We demonstrate theeffectiveness of our tool via a video demo and propose novel task-specificevaluation metrics to control for alignment and hallucination.

We explore an information retrieval method that integrates both partition-based and similarity-based network analysis to identify and recommend communities within content-based datasets. Our prototype "ScholarNodes" web interface bridges the gap between community detection algorithms (Louvain, K-means, Spectral clustering) and the BM25 (Best Matching 25) ranking algorithm within a cohesive user interface. From free-text keyword queries, ScholarNodes recommends collaborations, identifies local and external researcher networks, and visualizes an interdisciplinarity graph for individual researchers using the OpenAlex dataset, a global collection of academic papers and authors. Beyond the specific information retrieval use case, we discuss the broader applicability of the methods to generic social network analysis, community detection, and recommender systems. Additionally, we delve into the technical aspects of generating topical terms, community alignment techniques, and interface design considerations for integrating community detection algorithms into a search experience. | Md Asaduzzaman Noor, Jason A.

The speech recognition system (speech-to-text) uses query priors, trained solely on text, to distinguish between phonetically confusing alternatives. Hence, the generation of synthetic queries that are similar to existing VA usage can greatly improve upon the VA's abilities-especially for use-cases that do not (yet) occur in paired audio/text data. In this paper, we provide a preliminary exploration of the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic queries that are complementary to template-based methods. We investigate whether the methods (a) generate queries that are similar to randomly sampled, representative, and anonymized user queries from a popular VA, and (b) whether the generated queries are specific. We find that LLMs generate more verbose queries, compared to template-based methods, and reference aspects specific to the entity. The generated queries are similar to VA user queries, and are specific enough to retrieve the relevant entity. We conclude that queries generated by LLMs and templates are complementary. | Sonal Sannigrahi, Thiago FragaSilva, Youssef Oualil, Christophe Van Gysel | Apple; Instituto Superior Técnico |

Legal documents are extensive, and we posit that generating questions about them and detecting the answers provided by these documents help the Legal Research journey. This paper presents a pipeline that relates Legal Questions with documents answering them. We align features generated by Large Language Models with traditional clustering methods to find convergent and divergent answers to the same legal matter. We performed a case study with 50 legal documents on the Brazilian judiciary system. Our pipeline found convergent and divergent answers to 23 major legal questions regarding the case law for daily fines in Civil Procedural Law. The pipeline manual evaluation shows it managed to group diverse similar answers to the same question with an average precision of 0.85. It also managed to detect two divergent legal matters with an average F1 Score of 0.94. | Johny Moreira, Altigran S. da Silva, Edleno Silva de Moura, Leandro Bezerra Marinho | Universidade Federal de Campina Grande; Universidade Federal do Amazonas |

Our experimental results show that large language models could achieve a macro F1 score of over 0.5 for all our collected real-world market research datasets in a zero-shot setting. We also provide in-depth analyses of the errors made by the large language models.

The conventional retrieval methods in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for large language models (LLMs) treat a large corpus of past issue tracking tickets as plain text, ignoring the crucial intra-issue structure and inter-issue relations, which limits performance. We introduce a novel customer service question-answering method that amalgamates RAG with a knowledge graph (KG). Our method constructs a KG from historical issues for use in retrieval, retaining the intra-issue structure and inter-issue relations. During the question-answering phase, our method parses consumer queries and retrieves related sub-graphs from the KG to generate answers. This integration of a KG not only improves retrieval accuracy by preserving customer service structure information but also enhances answering quality by mitigating the effects of text segmentation. Empirical assessments on our benchmark datasets, utilizing key retrieval (MRR, Recall@K, NDCG@K) and text generation (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR) metrics, reveal that our method outperforms the baseline by 77.6% in MRR and by 0.32 in BLEU. Our method has been deployed within LinkedIn's customer service team for approximately six months and has reduced the median per-issue resolution time by 28.6%. | Zhentao Xu, Mark Jerome Cruz, Matthew Guevara, Tie Wang, Manasi Deshpande, Xiaofeng Wang, Zheng Li | LinkedIn Corporation; LinkedIn Corporation Senior Machine Learning Engineer |

Users often mix artist names and keywords from track title or lyrics making spell correction highly contextual. Data drift in search queries caused during calendar event days or a newly released music album, brings a unique challenge of quickly adapting to new data points. Scalability of the solution is an essential requirement as the Music catalog is extremely large. In this work, we build a multi-stage framework for spell correction solution for music, media and named entity heavy search engines. We offer contextual spelling suggestions using a generative text transformer model and a mechanism to rapidly adapt to data drift as well as different market needs by using parameter efficient based fine tuning techniques. Furthermore, using a reinforcement learning approach our spell correction system can learn from a user's implicit and explicit feedback in real-time. Some key components of this system are being used in search at Amazon Music and showing significant improvements in customer engagement rate and other relevant metrics. | Siddharth Sharma, Shiyun Yang, Ajinkya Walimbe, Tarun Sharma, Joaquin Delgado | Amazon Inc |

In this paper, we build a short (S) and long (L) term Hawkes (H) process for each item and use it to obtain BIA recommendations for each customer. The challenges of deploying into a production environment including model scalability, an evolving item catalog, and real-time inference are discussed along with solutions such as model compression, frequency-based item filtering, training data sampling, data parallelization, parallel execution and microservice-based real-time recommendations. We significantly reduced model training time from roughly 250 hours to about 3 hours by applying the solutions, while serving real-time inference with less than 70ms latency. We compare our BIA model against state-of-the-art baselines using three publicly available datasets and provide results from A/B tests with millions of live customers. On 3 public datasets, our model outperforms SOTA baseline models in recall and NDCG metrics by around 85% and 10%, respectively, and in live A/B testing it exhibited more than 30% increase in click-through rate and roughly 30% revenue increase compared to other state of the art models. | Rankyung Park, Amit Pande, David Relyea, Pushkar Chennu, Prathyusha Kanmanth Reddy | Target Corporation |

It also aims to enrich the diversity, personalization, and interactivity of that connection, ensuring the information retrieval process is as seamless, beneficial, and supportive as possible in the global digital era. Current information retrieval systems often encounter challenges like a constrained understanding of queries, static and inflexible responses, limited personalization, and restricted interactivity. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), there's a transformative paradigm shift as we integrate LLM-powered agents into these systems. These agents bring forth crucial human capabilities like memory and planning to make them behave like humans in completing various tasks, effectively enhancing user engagement and offering tailored interactions. In this tutorial, we delve into the cutting-edge techniques of LLM-powered agents across various information retrieval fields, such as search engines, social networks, recommender systems, and conversational assistants. We will also explore the prevailing challenges in seamlessly incorporating these agents and hint at prospective research avenues that can revolutionize the way of information retrieval. | An Zhang, Yang Deng, Yankai Lin, Xu Chen, JiRong Wen, TatSeng Chua | Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; Renmin Univ China, Beijing, Peoples R China |

Compared to the traditional “index-retrieve-then-rank” pipeline, the GR paradigm aims to consolidate all information within a corpus into a single model. Typically, a sequence-to-sequence model is trained to directly map a query to its relevant document identifiers (i.e., docids). This tutorial offers an introduction to the core concepts of the GR paradigm and a comprehensive overview of recent advances in its foundations and applications. We start by providing preliminary information covering foundational aspects and problem formulations of GR. Then, our focus shifts towards recent progress in docid design, training approaches, inference strategies, and the applications of GR. We end by outlining remaining challenges and issuing a call for future GR research. This tutorial is intended to be beneficial to both researchers and industry practitioners interested in developing novel GR solutions or applying them in real-world scenarios. | Yubao Tang, Ruqing Zhang, Zhaochun Ren, Jiafeng Guo, Maarten de Rijke | Leiden Univ, Leiden, Netherlands; Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Key Lab Network Data Sci & Technol, ICT, Beijing, Peoples R China |
| 270 |  |  [Robust Information Retrieval](https://doi.org/10.1145/3626772.3661380) |  | 0 | A typical information retrieval (IR) system applies a single retrieval strategy to every information need of users. However, the results of the past IR experiments show that a particular retrieval strategy is in general good at fulfilling some type of information needs while failing to fulfil some other type, i.e., high variation in retrieval effectiveness across information needs. On the other hand, the same results also show that an information need that a particular retrieval strategy failed to fulfil could be fulfilled by one of the other existing retrieval strategies. The challenge in here is therefore to determine in advance what retrieval strategy should be applied to which information need. This challenge is related to the robustness of IR systems in retrieval effectiveness. For an IR system, robustness can be defined as fulfilling every information need of users with an acceptable level of satisfaction. Maintaining robustness in retrieval effectiveness is a long-standing challenge and in this article we propose a simple but powerful method as a remedy. The method is a selective approach to index term weighting and for any given query (i.e., information need) it predicts the "best" term weighting model amongst a set of alternatives, on the basis of the frequency distributions of query terms on a target document collection. To predict the best term weighting model, the method uses the Chi-square statistic, the statistic of the Chi-square goodness-of-fit test. The results of the experiments, performed using the official query sets of the TREC Web track and the Million Query track, reveal in general that the frequency distributions of query terms provide relevant information on the retrieval effectiveness of term weighting models. In particular, the results show that the selective approach proposed in this article is, on average, more effective and more robust than the most effective single term weighting model. | YuAn Liu, Ruqing Zhang, Jiafeng Guo, Maarten de Rijke | Computer Engineering Department,Muğla Sıtkı Koçman University,Muğla,Turkey; Computer Engineering Department,Eskişehir Technical University,Eskişehir,Turkey |

These systems, which combine the strengths of information retrieval and generative models, have shown promise in enhancing the capabilities and performance of machine learning applications. However, despite their growing prominence, RAG systems are not without their limitations and continue to be in need of exploration and improvement. This workshop seeks to focus on the critical aspect of information retrieval and its integral role within RAG frameworks. We argue that current efforts have undervalued the role of Information Retrieval (IR) in the RAG and have concentrated their attention on the generative part. As the cornerstone of these systems, IR's effectiveness dramatically influences the overall performance and outcomes of RAG models. We call for papers that will seek to revisit and emphasize the fundamental principles underpinning RAG systems. At the end of the workshop, we aim to have a clearer understanding of how robust information retrieval mechanisms can significantly enhance the capabilities of RAG systems. The workshop will serve as a platform for experts, researchers, and practitioners. We intend to foster discussions, share insights, and encourage research that underscores the vital role of Information Retrieval in the future of generative systems. | Fabio Petroni, Federico Siciliano, Fabrizio Silvestri, Giovanni Trappolini | Sapienza Univ Rome, Rome, Italy; Samaya AI, London, England |
| 272 |  |  [A Predictive Framework for Query Reformulation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3626772.3657653) |  | 0 | Web search services are widely employed for various purposes. After identifying information needs, users attempt to articulate them in web queries that express their intentions. Then, they submit these queries to the chosen search engine with the hope of obtaining relevant results to meet their needs. In some cases, users may not immediately find precisely what they are seeking, prompting them to rewrite the query to obtain a greater number of relevant results or results that are perhaps more related to their intent. While significant work has been done on developing features such as query auto-completion, query suggestion, and query recommendation, the majority of these efforts were based on query co-occurrence or query similarity by clustering them or constructing query flow graphs to capture query connections. These approaches operate under the assumption that frequently observed follow-up queries are more likely to be submitted by users [1, 2, 4]. In this research, we investigate user query reformulation behavior. To achieve this, we will utilize the Trip Click dataset, a large-scale collection of user click data within the context of a health web search engine [3]. The log data from 2018 to 2020 will be considered, comprising 1,803,493 records representing the clicks that occurred across 527,749 sessions. Specifically, the focus will be on the impact of user interactions with the search result page when forming subsequent queries. | Reyhaneh Goli | The University of Melbourne |

However, existing algorithms dealing with those types of data still focus on uni-modal representation learning by vision-language alignment and cross-modal retrieval. In this workshop, we target to bring a new retrieval problem where both queries and documents are multimodal. With the popularity of vision language modeling, large language models (LLMs), retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and multimodal LLM, we see a lot of new opportunities for multimodal representation and retrieval tasks. This event will be a comprehensive half-day workshop focusing on the subject of multimodal representation and retrieval.

| 274 |  |  [Axiomatic Guidance for Efficient and Controlled Neural Search](https://doi.org/10.1145/3626772.3657651) |  | 0 | Pre-trained language models based on the transformer architecture provide solutions to general ad-hoc search tasks--ranging from news search to question-answering--vastly outperforming statistical approaches in terms of both precision and recall. These models operate over "semantics'', removing the need for bespoke features based on proprietary data (e.g., interaction logs). In doing so, this paradigm may lead to further adoption of the idealised "end-to-end'' retrieval system as an elegant and powerful search solution. However, outside of sanitised benchmarks, these models present exploitable and untrustworthy biases relinquishing any control over inference due to their black-box nature. Such biases threaten the viability of neural models in production. Without greater control over model output, stakeholders could raise concerns hindering the adoption of effective and efficient search. Today, feature-based search systems are still performant relative to state-of-the-art neural search and can adapt to a changing corpus and the needs of system stakeholders. As agency over information access is further reduced via emerging paradigms such as Retrieval-Augmented-Generation, we must retain control over the output of a search system. We consider that bias in neural search systems is an artefact of the training and underlying mechanisms of current pre-trained models but is not present in statistical models. Features such as statistical models are principled and arbitrarily controllable; these features can adapt to a corpus and meet the demands of a given search task. Conversely, the output of a current neural system can only be changed by post hoc constraints or by re-training the underlying model. We posit that by allowing external features to influence the semantic interactions within neural search at inference time, we can not only allow control over system output but reduce the need to model corpus-specific priors, which can instead be modelled by external features, allowing for greater generalisation and training efficiency gains. We aim to reduce the complexity of neural ranker training and inference, applying classical IR principles and systems that align with such principles as a generalisable process as opposed to the ad-hoc constraint of prior work. Such an approach can reduce the need for larger models whilst improving generalisation. Axiomatic signals can guide and control neural ranking models to reduce spurious factors in semantic relevance estimation by compensating for the frozen priors of neural systems whilst still operating over flexible latent space. Given the biases observed in current systems, this may satiate the concerns of multiple stakeholders, leading to broader adoption of the paradigm. | Andrew Parry | University of Glasgow |
| 275 |  |  [Personalized Large Language Models through Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning Techniques](https://doi.org/10.1145/3626772.3657657) |  | 0 | Personalization of the search experience according to the users and their context is an important topic in Information Retrieval (IR), studied by the research community for a long time. The IR field has witnessed a transformation with the recent availability of pre-trained Large Language Models. Typically, personalization requires the model to incorporate user-specific information, through the definition of an appropriate prompting or injecting user knowledge into the model and then fine-tuning it. However, using prompting, we do not know where and how much the model is personalizing the output. Furthermore, fine-tuning such systems is computationally expensive: since they are characterized by billions of parameters, the fine-tuning process has introduced profound computational challenges. For these reasons, we propose a novel approach that combines personalization and Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning methods. | Marco Braga | University of Milano-Bicocca |
| 276 |  |  [Towards a Framework for Legal Case Retrieval](https://doi.org/10.1145/3626772.3657650) |  | 0 | Legal case reports detail the main points of a decided case, findings and decisions of the court. The reports are a fundamental source for Case law, a law which requires judges to align their rulings with previous judicial decisions on similar cases [1]. Timely and reliable access to case reports is thus of critical importance to legal practitioners working on a current case, and laymen interested in the outcome of cases. However, ensuring effective retrieval of previous case reports is still proving a challenge, even with the use of retrieval technologies already proven effective in other Information Retrieval (IR) domains. This has been attributed to factors such as lack of structure, and lengthiness of case report documents, and queries formulated to represent an ongoing case for which the reports are being sought [4]. To address these factors we propose an IR framework that focuses on infusing structure into the documents and queries through the identification of legal rhetorical roles such as arguments and facts in the text. Furthermore, we aim to explore the use of selected groupings of these rhetorical roles as representations for the documents and queries. The benefit of using selected content is illustrated in recent research where for instance segments of documents such as abstracts, case headers, specific paragraphs, and sentences have been used to build effective legal IR systems. We thus hypothesize that we can attain marked improved performance when we build a case retrieval system using only a section of a case report or a query such as arguments or facts. However, in contrast to these studies we posit that utilizing rhetorical role information to extract content will lead to more effective representations that can enhance the performance of case retrieval systems. The proposed framework will consists of a set of components needed to process both query and case report text to firstly infuse structure, extract effective representative content and finally perform retrieval. To aid the development of the framework, several empirical investigations will be conducted on publicly accessible datasets, and a self-curated test collection derived from Botswana legal case reports. Key research questions to assist in our investigation are as follows:: Can we successfully detect the implicit elements of a legal text reflecting rhetorical roles significant to legal case documents?RQ2: In comparison to human formulated queries, do whole case queries give better performance?RQ3: Can we improve retrieval performance by only retaining textual units representing specific rhetorical roles from an entire query text (current case)?RQ4: Does indexing only textual units representing specific rhetorical roles from prior case documents improve retrieval performance?RQ5: Do the selected approaches result in performance improvement for our local corpus in terms of precision, recall and user satisfaction?Some preliminary work has been done and published towards investigating the viability of using summaries in legal case retrieval and identification of rhetorical roles in case documents. We submitted results of a system that utilized expanded summarized queries for an AILA precedent retrieval task competition that outperformed other submissions [2]. Furthermore, our approach that utilized TagCrowd for summarization performed well on a task of Statute retrieval [5]. Towards the feasibility of rhetorically labelling legal text we experimented with the fastText classifier for an AILA organized task. While our methods did not attain state-of-the-art, they gave insights into the performance of the different roles and factors that can affect performance in the task.

RQ2: In comparison to human formulated queries, do whole case queries give better performance? RQ3: Can we improve retrieval performance by only retaining textual units representing specific rhetorical roles from an entire query text (current case)? RQ4: Does indexing only textual units representing specific rhetorical roles from prior case documents improve retrieval performance?

In a conversational setting such signals are usuallyunavailable due to the nature of the interactions, and, instead, the evaluationoften relies on crowdsourced evaluation labels. The role of user feedback inannotators' assessment of turns in a conversational perception has been littlestudied. We focus on how the evaluation of task-oriented dialogue systems(TDSs), is affected by considering user feedback, explicit or implicit, asprovided through the follow-up utterance of a turn being evaluated. We exploreand compare two methodologies for assessing TDSs: one includes the user'sfollow-up utterance and one without. We use both crowdworkers and largelanguage models (LLMs) as annotators to assess system responses across fouraspects: relevance, usefulness, interestingness, and explanation quality. Ourfindings indicate that there is a distinct difference in ratings assigned byboth annotator groups in the two setups, indicating user feedback doesinfluence system evaluation. Workers are more susceptible to user feedback onusefulness and interestingness compared to LLMs on interestingness andrelevance. User feedback leads to a more personalized assessment of usefulnessby workers, aligning closely with the user's explicit feedback. Additionally,in cases of ambiguous or complex user requests, user feedback improvesagreement among crowdworkers. These findings emphasize the significance of userfeedback in refining system evaluations and suggest the potential for automatedfeedback integration in future research.

It benefits from easily available, privacy-friendly yet expressive data, and does not require extensive re-tuning of the upstream user model for different downstream tasks. While this approach has shown promise in search engines and e-commerce applications, its fit for instant messaging platforms, a cornerstone of modern digital communication, remains largely uncharted. We explore this research gap using Snapchat data as a case study. Specifically, we implement a Transformer-based user model with customized training objectives and show that the model can produce high-quality user representations across a broad range of evaluation tasks, among which we introduce three new downstream tasks that concern pivotal topics in user research: user safety, engagement and churn. We also tackle the challenge of efficient extrapolation of long sequences at inference time, by applying a novel positional encoding method. | Qixiang Fang, Zhihan Zhou, Francesco Barbieri, Yozen Liu, Leonardo Neves, Dong Nguyen, Daniel L.

Most prominently, they can estimate the relevance of a passage or document to a user's query. In this work, we depart from this direction by exploring whether neural networks can effectively predict which of a document's passages are unlikely to be relevant to any query submitted to the search engine.We refer to this query-agnostic estimation of passage relevance as a passage's quality.We find that our novel methods for estimating passage quality allow passage corpora to be pruned considerably while maintaining statistically equivalent effectiveness; our best methods can consistently prune >25% of passages in a corpora, across various retrieval pipelines. Such substantial pruning reduces the operating costs of neural search engines in terms of computing resources, power usage, and carbon footprint-both when processing queries (thanks to a smaller index size) and when indexing (lightweight models can prune low-quality passages prior to the costly dense or learned sparse encoding step). This work sets the stage for developing more advanced neural "learning-what-to-index" methods. | Xuejun Chang, Debabrata Mishra, Craig Macdonald, Sean MacAvaney | University of Glasgow |

Current research mainly mitigates shortcut learning behavior using augmentation and distillation techniques, but these methods could be laborious and introduce unwarranted biases. To tackle these, in this paper, we propose COMI, a novel method to COrrect and MItigate shortcut learning behavior. Inspired by the ways students solve shortcuts in educational scenarios, we aim to reduce model's reliance on shortcuts and enhance its ability to extract underlying information integrated with standard Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM). Specifically, we first design Correct Habit (CoHa) strategy to retrieve the top.. challenging samples for priority training, which encourages model to rely less on shortcuts in the early training. Then, to extract more meaningful underlying information, the information derived from ERM is separated into task-relevant and task-irrelevant information, the former serves as the primary basis for model predictions, while the latter is considered non-essential. However, within task-relevant information, certain potential shortcuts contribute to overconfident predictions. To mitigate this, we design Deep Mitigation (DeMi) network with shortcut margin loss to adaptively control the feature weights of shortcuts and eliminate their influence. Besides, to counteract unknown shortcut tokens issue in NLP, we adopt locally interpretable module-LIME to help recognize shortcut tokens. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on NLP and CV tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of COMI, which can perform well on both IID and OOD samples. | Lili Zhao, Qi Liu, Linan Yue, Wei Chen, Liyi Chen, Ruijun Sun, Chao Song | OPPO; University of Science and Technology of China |

Such graphs are ubiquitous in real-world domains like recommender systems and social networks. However, the spatial heterogeneity, rich semantic information, and intricate evolution patterns of THGs make it still difficult to generate high-quality embeddings for graph nodes. In this paper, we focus on two valuable and understudied issues related to THG learning: (a) How to capture the specific evolutionary characteristics of diverse temporal heterogeneous graphs? (b) Due to the heterogeneous nature of the graph, how to capture the unique temporal patterns of different node types? We explore these questions and present our solution by proposing a new method named CasMLN (Cascaded Multi-level Learning Network) for THG learning. Through the multi-level learning structure and aggregation methods specifically designed for different levels, we obtain information of multiple levels and fuse them to improve embedding generation. Additionally, we pioneer the use of large language models (LLMs) in the THG field. By leveraging the universality and powerful capabilities of LLMs, our method introduces LLM-based external knowledge to effectively capture the implicit nature of graphs and node types, which helps to enhance type- and graph-level representations. We evaluate our method on several real-world THG datasets for different downstream tasks. Extensive experimental results show that CasMLN outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and efficiency. | Fengyi Wang, Guanghui Zhu, Chunfeng Yuan, Yihua Huang | Nanjing University State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology |

Current systems have made significant advancements in handling synthetic claims sourced from Wikipedia, and noteworthy progress has been achieved in addressing real-world claims that are verified by fact-checking organizations as well. We compile and release QuanTemp, a diverse, multi-domain dataset focused exclusively on numerical claims, encompassing comparative, statistical, interval, and temporal aspects, with detailed metadata and an accompanying evidence collection. This addresses the challenge of verifying real-world numerical claims, which are complex and often lack precise information, a gap not filled by existing works that mainly focus on synthetic claims. We evaluate and quantify these gaps in existing solutions for the task of verifying numerical claims. We also evaluate claim decomposition based methods, numerical understanding based natural language inference (NLI) models and our best baselines achieves a macro-F1 of 58.32. This demonstrates that QuanTemp serves as a challenging evaluation set for numerical claim verification. | Venktesh V, Abhijit Anand, Avishek Anand, Vinay Setty | University of Stavanger; TU Delft; L3S Research Institute |

With the development of large language models (LLMs), recent research has adopted visual instruction tuning to inject the knowledge of LLMs into downstream multimodal tasks. The high complexity and great demand for resources urge researchers to study e.cient distillation solutions to transfer the knowledge from pre-trained multimodal models (teachers) to more compact student models. However, the instruction tuning for knowledge distillation in multimodal LLMs is resource-intensive and capability-restricted. The comprehension of students is highly reliant on the teacher models. To address this issue, we propose a novel Multimodal Distillation Calibration framework (MmDC). The main idea is to generate high-quality training instances that challenge student models to comprehend and prompt the teacher to calibrate the knowledge transferred to students, ultimately cultivating a better student model in downstream tasks. This framework comprises two stages: (1) multimodal alignment and (2) knowledge distillation calibration. In the.rst stage, parameter-e.cient.ne-tuning is used to enhance feature alignment between di.erent modalities. In the second stage, we develop a calibration strategy to assess the student model's capability and generate high-quality instances to calibrate knowledge distillation from teacher to student. The experiments on diverse datasets show that our framework e.ciently improves the student model's capabilities. Our 7B-size student model, after three iterations of distillation calibration, outperforms the current state-of-the-art LLaVA-13B model on the ScienceQA and LLaVA Test datasets and also exceeds other strong baselines in a zero-shot setting. | Xinwei Li, Li Lin, Shuai Wang, Chen Qian | Southeast university; Tsinghua University; Southeast University |

This list, the outcome of ad auction and allocation processes, directly impacts the platform's ad revenue and gross merchandise volume (GMV). Specifically, the ad auction determines which ad is displayed and the corresponding payment, while the ad allocation decides the display positions of the advertisement and organic items. The prevalent methods of segregating the ad auction and allocation into two distinct stages face two problems: 1) Ad auction does not consider externalities, such as the influence of actual display position and context on ad Click-Through Rate (CTR); 2) The ad allocation, which utilizes the auction-winning ad's payment to determine the display position dynamically, fails to maintain incentive compatibility (IC) for the advertisement. For instance, in the auction stage employing the traditional Generalized Second Price (GSP), even if the winning ad increases its bid, its payment remains unchanged. This implies that the advertisement cannot secure a better position and thus loses the opportunity to achieve higher utility in the subsequent ad allocation stage. Previous research often focused on one of the two stages, neglecting the two-stage problem, which may result in suboptimal outcomes. Therefore, this paper proposes a deep automated mechanism that integrates ad auction and allocation, ensuring both IC and Individual Rationality (IR) in the presence of externalities while maximizing revenue and GMV. The mechanism takes candidate ads and the ordered list of organic items as input. For each candidate ad, several candidate allocations are generated by inserting the ad in different positions of the ordered list of organic items. For each candidate allocation, a list-wise model takes the entire allocation as input and outputs the predicted result for each ad and organic item to model the global externalities. Finally, an automated auction mechanism, modeled by deep neural networks, is executed to select the optimal allocation. Consequently, this mechanism simultaneously decides the ranking, payment, and display position of the ad. Furthermore, the proposed mechanism results in higher revenue and GMV than state-of-the-art baselines in offline experiments and online A/B tests. | Xuejian Li, Ze Wang, Bingqi Zhu, Fei He, Yongkang Wang, Xingxing Wang | Meituan |

Despite recent advancements in temporal graph representation learning, performance degradation occurs with periodic collections of new temporal edges, owing to their dynamic nature and newly emerging information. This paper investigates online representation learning on temporal graphs, aiming for efficient updates of temporal models to sustain predictive performance during deployment. Unlike costly retraining or exclusive fine-tuning susceptible to catastrophic forgetting, our approach aims to distill information from previous model parameters and adapt it to newly gathered data. To this end, we propose TGOnline, an adaptive online meta-learning framework, tackling two key challenges. First, to distill valuable knowledge from complex temporal parameters, we establish an optimization objective that determines new parameters, either by leveraging global ones or by placing greater reliance on new data, where global parameters are meta-trained across various data collection periods to enhance temporal generalization. Second, to accelerate the online distillation process, we introduce an edge reduction mechanism that skips new edges lacking additional information and a node deduplication mechanism to prevent redundant computation within training batches on new data. Extensive experiments on four real-world temporal graphs demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of TGOnline for online representation learning, outperforming 18 state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, TGOnline not only outperforms the commonly utilized retraining strategy but also achieves a significant speedup of ~30x. | Ruijie Wang, Jingyuan Huang, Yutong Zhang, Jinyang Li, Yufeng Wang, Wanyu Zhao, Shengzhong Liu, Charith Mendis, Tarek F.

Previous studies mainly fall into two categories: one reconstructs the structural relations of the graph through the representations of nodes, while the other aggregates neighboring node information using graph neural networks. However, existing methods only explore the local structural information of nodes during the learning process. This makes it difficult to represent the macroscopic structural information and leaves it easily affected by data sparsity and noise. To address this issue, we propose the Intent Distribution based Bipartite graph Representation learning (IDBR) model, which explicitly integrates node intent distribution information into the representation learning process. Specifically, we obtain node intent distributions through clustering and design an intent distribution based graph convolution neural network to generate node representations. Compared to traditional methods, we expand the scope of node representations, enabling us to obtain more comprehensive representations of global intent. When constructing the intent distributions, we effectively alleviated the issues of data sparsity and noise. Additionally, we enrich the representations of nodes by integrating potential neighboring nodes from both structural and semantic dimensions. Experiments on the link prediction and recommendation tasks illustrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

However, the currently well-performing models predominantly rely on massive pre-trained language models with at least several hundred million or even over one hundred billion parameters. These complex models not only require immense computational power but also extensive storage, presenting challenges for resource-limited environments such as online education.Current research indicates that specific capabilities of larger models can be transferred to smaller models through knowledge distillation. However, prior to our work, there were no small models specifically designed for MRC task with complex reasoning abilities. In light of this, we present a novel multi-teacher multi-stage distillation approach, MTMS. It facilitates the easier deployment of reasoning-based MRC task on resource-constrained devices, thereby enabling effective applications. In this method, we design a multi-teacher distillation framework that includes both a logical teacher and a semantic teacher. This framework allows MTMS to simultaneously extract features from different perspectives of the text, mitigating the limitations inherent in single-teacher information representations. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-stage contrastive learning strategy. Through this strategy, the student model can progressively align with the teacher models, effectively bridging the gap between them. Extensive experimental outcomes on two inference-based datasets from real-world scenarios demonstrate that MTMS requires nearly 10 times fewer parameters compared with the teacher model size while achieving the competitive performance. | Zhuo Zhao, Zhiwen Xie, Guangyou Zhou, Jimmy Xiangji Huang | jhuangyorku.ca; gyzhoumail.ccnu.edu.cn; xiezhiwenwhu.edu.cn; zhuomails.ccnu.edu.cn |

Previous studies on MMSS have achieved success by either selecting the task-relevant visual information or filtering out the task-irrelevant visual information to help the textual modality to generate the summary. However, enhancing from a single perspective usually introduces over-preservation or over-compression problems. To tackle these issues, we resort to Information Bottleneck (IB), which seeks to find a maximally compressed mapping of the input information that preserves as much information about the target as possible. Specifically, we propose a novel method, T(3), which adopts IB to balance the Trade-off between Task-relevant and Task-irrelevant visual information through the variational inference framework. In this way, the task-irrelevant visual information is compressed to the utmost while the task-relevant visual information is maximally retained. With the holistic perspective, the generated summary could maintain as many key elements as possible while discarding the unnecessary ones as far as possible. Extensive experiments on the representative MMSS dataset demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method.

At the same time, many benchmark datasets have become available for QA and MRC tasks. However, most existing large-scale benchmark datasets have been created predominantly using synchronous document collections like Wikipedia or the Web. Archival document collections, such as historical newspapers, contain valuable information from the past that is still not widely used to train large language models. To further contribute to advancing QA and MRC tasks and to overcome the limitation of previous datasets, we introduce ChroniclingAmericaQA, a largescale temporal QA dataset with 487K question-answer pairs created based on the historical newspaper collection Chronicling America. Our dataset is constructed from a subset of the Chronicling America newspaper collection spanning 120 years. One of the significant challenges for utilizing digitized historical newspaper collections is the low quality of OCR text. Therefore, to enable realistic testing of QA models, our dataset can be used in three different ways: answering questions from raw and noisy content, answering questions from cleaner, corrected version of the content, as well as answering questions from scanned images of newspaper pages. This and the fact that ChroniclingAmericaQA spans the longest time period among available QA datasets make it quite a unique and useful resource. | Bhawna Piryani, Jamshid Mozafari, Adam Jatowt | University of Innsbruck |

However, this approach often leads to a degradation in clustering quality, negatively impacting BPQ's performance. To address these challenges, we introduce Binary-to-Real-and-Back K-Means (BRB-KMeans), a novel method that initially transforms binary data into real-valued vectors, performs k-means clustering on these vectors, and then converts the generated centroids back into binary data. This innovative approach significantly enhances clustering quality by leveraging the high clustering quality of k-means in the real-valued vector space, thereby facilitating future quantization for binary data. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that BRB-KMeans significantly enhances clustering quality and overall BPQ performance, notably outperforming traditional methods. | Suwon Lee, SangMin Choi | Gyeongsang National University |

However, most audio-text paired datasets often lack rich expressionof the text data compared to the audio samples. One of the significantchallenges facing audio-text datasets is the presence of similar or identicalcaptions despite different audio samples. Therefore, under many-to-one mappingconditions, audio-text datasets lead to poor performance of retrieval tasks. Inthis paper, we propose a novel approach to tackle the data imbalance problem inaudio-language retrieval task. To overcome the limitation, we introduce amethod that employs a distance sampling-based paraphraser leveraging ChatGPT,utilizing distance function to generate a controllable distribution ofmanipulated text data. For a set of sentences with the same context, thedistance is used to calculate a degree of manipulation for any two sentences,and ChatGPT's few-shot prompting is performed using a text cluster with asimilar distance defined by the Jaccard similarity. Therefore, ChatGPT, whenapplied to few-shot prompting with text clusters, can adjust the diversity ofthe manipulated text based on the distance. The proposed approach is shown tosignificantly enhance performance in audio-text retrieval, outperformingconventional text augmentation techniques. | Yoori Oh, Yoseob Han, Kyogu Lee | Soongsil University; Seoul National University |

The primary challenge lies in reducing the semantic distance between the news evidences of different modalities and accurately aligning them in the latent space. It has been observed that the relevance of news image content varies across coarse-to-fine scales, depending on the object and its class label. For instance, the visual evidence to justify a news item sometimes may be a very local detail such as the tiny changes of facial expression and limb position while sometimes may be the global composition. Consequently, how to align news text with image at the most discriminative scale significantly impacts detection performance. However, very few studies have addressed this issue in fake news detection. In this paper, we delve deeper into this issue and propose a simple yet effective Multi-scale Semantic Alignment and Cross-modal Attention (MSACA) network. Specifically, we construct hierarchical multi-scale images for each news data, enhance the semantic consistency between text and images in the latent space, and employ an attention module to select the deterministic embeddings in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on two real-world benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed MSACA network. | Jiandong Wang, Hongguang Zhang, Chun Liu, Xiongjun Yang | Systems Engineering Institute |

The diversity of user utterances and the scarcity of training data motivate multi-label few-shot intent detection. However, existing methods ignore the hybrid of verb and noun within an intent, which is essential to identify the user intent. In this paper, we propose a label hierarchical structure-aware method for multi-label few-shot intent detection via prompt tuning (LHS). Firstly, for the support data, we concatenate the original utterance with the label description generated by GPT-4 to obtain the utterance-level representation. Then we construct a multi-label hierarchical structure-aware prompt model to learn the label hierarchical information. To learn more discriminative class prototypes, we devise a prototypical contrastive learning method to pull the utterances close to their corresponding intent labels and away from other intent labels. Extensive experiments on two datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. | Xiaotong Zhang, Xinyi Li, Han Liu, Xinyue Liu, Xianchao Zhang | Dalian University of Technology |

In this paper, we propose a multimodal rumor detection model (MKV), which maps multimodal key semantics with discrimination into feature vectors for rumor detection. More specifically, MKV extracts high-dimensional features for each modality separately by the Multimodal Feature Extractor (MFE). The mapping mechanism learns low-dimensional mapping scheme (Map) and key semantics (Key) with discrimination from the different modal features respectively. Subsequently, the Map and Key jointly construct a state matrix (State) containing all possible permutations of modalities. In particular, a max pooling operation is performed on State and products a feature vector (Vector). The mapping mechanism is able to incrementally learn the discriminative semantics by stacking manner. Vectors from the stacking process are leveraged in the Rumor Detection module (RD). Extensive experiments on two public datasets show that the MKV achieves the state-of-the-art performance. | Yang Li, Liguang Liu, Jiacai Guo, LapKei Lee, Fu Lee Wang, Zhenguo Yang | Guangdong University of Technology; Hong Kong Metropolitan University |

We show that LLMs like LLaMa can achieve high performance on intent classification tasks with large number of classes but still make classification errors and worse, generate out-of-vocabulary intent labels. To address these critical issues, we introduce Paraphrase and AGgregate (PAG)-LLM approach wherein an LLM generates multiple paraphrases of the input query (parallel queries), performs intent classification for the original query and each paraphrase, and at the end aggregate all the predicted intent labels based on their confidence scores. We evaluate PAG-LLM on two large intent classification datasets: CLINC, and Banking and show 22.7% and 15.1% error reduction. We show that PAG-LLM is especially effective for hard examples where LLM is uncertain, and reduces the critical misclassification and hallucinated label generation errors. | Vikas Yadav, Zheng Tang, Vijay Srinivasan | University of Arizona; Samsung Research America |

We propose "self-referential reviews," crafted by merging personal information with existing reviews using the novel "Self-Referential ReviewMaker" prototype, which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs). The essence of the "self-referential review" lies in harnessing the self-reference effect, making the readers feel as if they are the protagonist of the review. To validate the efficacy of self-referential reviews, we conducted a user study focusing on online reviews with thirty-four participants. The contributions of our paper are centered around self-referential reviews, highlighting (1) the creation of these reviews using our new prototype, Self-Referential ReviewMaker, (2) their effectiveness in enhancing review helpfulness through the self-reference effect, and (3) the identification of additional factors influencing the self-reference effect with further discussion on enhancing user-focused review systems. | Kyusik Kim, Hyungwoo Song, Bongwon Suh | Seoul National University |

We present two unbiased validation strategies that embed blind relevance assessments into a technology-assisted review (TAR) process, so as to compare its recall to that which would have been achieved by exhaustive manual review. We illustrate the use of these strategies within the context of TAR occasioned by litigation over accounting practices preceding the collapse of a major insurance company. | Gordon V.

An Initial Log Analysis of Google Bard Interactions in the Wild](https://doi.org/10.1145/3626772.3657914) |  | 0 | Advancements in large language models (LLMs) have changed information retrieval, offering users a more personalised and natural search experience with technologies like OpenAI ChatGPT, Google Bard (Gemini), or Microsoft Copilot. Despite these advancements, research into user tasks and information needs remains scarce. This preliminary work analyses a Google Bard prompt log with 15,023 interactions called the Bard Intelligence and Dialogue Dataset (BIDD), providing an understanding akin to query log analyses. We show that Google Bard prompts are often verbose and structured, encapsulating a broader range of information needs and imperative (e.g., directive) tasks distinct from traditional search queries. We show that LLMs can support users in tasks beyond the three main types based on user intent: informational, navigational, and transactional. Our findings emphasise the versatile application of LLMs across content creation, LLM writing style preferences, and information extraction. We document diverse user interaction styles, showcasing the adaptability of users to LLM capabilities. | Johanne R.

Refining titles to be more concise and informative is crucial for better user experience and product promotion. Recent solutions to product title refinement follow the standard text extractive and generative methods. Some also leverage multimodal information, e.g. using product images to supplement original titles with visual knowledge. However, these generative methods often produce additional terms not endorsed by sellers. Thus, it remains challenging to incorporate visual information missing from original titles into refined titles without excessively introducing novel terms. Additionally, most existing methods require human-labeled datasets, which are laborious to construct. In response to the two challenges, we present a self-supervised multimodal framework (HLATR) for title refinement that comprises two key modules: (1) a perturbated sample generator that constructs training data by systematically mining homogeneous listing information and (2) a title refinement network that effectively harnesses visual information to refine the original titles. To explicitly balance the extraction from original titles and the generation of supplementary novel terms, we adapt the copy mechanism that is guided by a focused refinement loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework consistently outperforms others in generating refined titles that contain essential multimodal semantics with minimal deviation from the original ones. | Jiaqi Deng, Kaize Shi, Huan Huo, Dingxian Wang, Guandong Xu | Etsy Inc; University of Technology Sydney |

ScienceDirectTopic Pages (TP) are intended to facilitate learning and to provide users with a structured overview of sources to deepen their knowledge about such unfamiliar topics. Our free service provides insight into a vast set of technical topics across 20 different scientific domains. Designed to emulate the natural flow of learning, TPs are embedded within millions of articles so that users can click on unfamiliar concepts they come across whilst reading an article. This redirects the user to a TP, consisting of a definition of the concept, which provides the user with a basic understanding of the concept. The TP further presents a collection of relevant snippets extracted from books and review articles published by ScienceDirect for users interested in references and more detailed explanations and applications of the concept. Finally, a set of related topics is provided to extend the user's knowledge even further. To build TPs, we utilize various information retrieval methods across our product. We retrieve the most relevant snippets for each topic/concept using a semantic search model fine-tuned on our scientific database. We further leverage the power of Retrieval Augmented Generation to generate reliable definitions on the topics sourced from ScienceDirect's content.

To address this, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as apopular solution to enhance factual accuracy. However, traditional retrievalmodules often rely on large document index and disconnect with generativetasks. With the advent of generative retrieval (GR), language models canretrieve by directly generating document identifiers (DocIDs), offeringsuperior performance in retrieval tasks. However, the potential relationshipbetween GR and downstream tasks remains unexplored. In this paper, we proposeCorpusLM, a unified language model that leverages external corpus totackle various knowledge-intensive tasks by integrating generative retrieval,closed-book generation, and RAG through a unified greedy decoding process. Wedesign the following mechanisms to facilitate effective retrieval andgeneration, and improve the end-to-end effectiveness of KI tasks: (1) Wedevelop a ranking-oriented DocID list generation strategy, which refines GR bydirectly learning from a DocID ranking list, to improve retrieval quality. (2)We design a continuous DocIDs-References-Answer generation strategy, whichfacilitates effective and efficient RAG. (3) We employ well-designedunsupervised DocID understanding tasks, to comprehend DocID semantics and theirrelevance to downstream tasks. We evaluate our approach on the widely used KILTbenchmark with two variants of backbone models, i.e., T5 and Llama2.Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our models in bothretrieval and downstream tasks. | Xiaoxi Li, Zhicheng Dou, Yujia Zhou, Fangchao Liu | Renmin University of China Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence; Huawei Poisson Lab; Renmin University of China |

Although existing methods can learn goodembeddings for each factual element in quadruples by integrating temporalinformation, they often fail to infer the evolution of temporal facts. This ismainly because of (1) insufficiently exploring the internal structure andsemantic relationships within individual quadruples and (2) inadequatelylearning a unified representation of the contextual and temporal correlationsamong different quadruples. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novelTransformer-based reasoning model (dubbed ECEformer) for TKG to learn theEvolutionary Chain of Events (ECE). Specifically, we unfold the neighborhoodsubgraph of an entity node in chronological order, forming an evolutionarychain of events as the input for our model. Subsequently, we utilize aTransformer encoder to learn the embeddings of intra-quadruples for ECE. Wethen craft a mixed-context reasoning module based on the multi-layer perceptron(MLP) to learn the unified representations of inter-quadruples for ECE whileaccomplishing temporal knowledge reasoning. In addition, to enhance thetimeliness of the events, we devise an additional time prediction task tocomplete effective temporal information within the learned unifiedrepresentation. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets verify thestate-of-the-art performance and the effectiveness of our method. | Zhiyu Fang, ShuaiLong Lei, Xiaobin Zhu, Chun Yang, ShiXue Zhang, XuCheng Yin, Jingyan Qin | University of Science and Technology Beijing; University of Science and Technology Beijing School of Computer & Communication Engineering |

However, real-world MMKGs present challenges due to their diverse and imbalanced nature, which means that the modality information can span various types (e.g., image, text, numeric, audio, video) but its distribution among entities is uneven, leading to missing modalities for certain entities. Existing works usually focus on common modalities like image and text while neglecting the imbalanced distribution phenomenon of modal information. To address these issues, we propose a comprehensive framework NativE to achieve MMKGC in the wild. NativE proposes a relation-guided dual adaptive fusion module that enables adaptive fusion for any modalities and employs a collaborative modality adversarial training framework to augment the imbalanced modality information. We construct a new benchmark called WildKGC with five datasets to evaluate our method.

The goal is to forecast future events for newly emerging entities within temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs), leveraging only a limited set of initial observations. Hyperbolic space is advantageous for modeling emerging graph entities for two reasons: First, its geometric property of exponential expansion aligns with the rapid growth of new entities in real-world graphs; Second, it excels in capturing power-law patterns and hierarchical structures, well-suitable for new entities distributed at the peripheries of graph hierarchies and loosely connected with others through few links. We therefore propose a meta-learning framework, MetaHKG, to enable few-shot temporal reasoning within a hyperbolic space. Unlike prior hyperbolic learning works, MetaHKG addresses the challenges of effectively representing new entities in TKGs and adapting model parameters by incorporating novel hyperbolic time encodings and temporal attention networks that achieve translational invariance. We also introduce a meta hyperbolic optimization algorithm to enhance model adaptation by learning both global and entity-specific parameters through bi-level optimization. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three real-world temporal knowledge graphs demonstrate the superiority of MetaHKG over a diverse range of baselines, which achieves average 5.2% relative improvements. Compared to its Euclidean counterpart, MetaHKG operates in a lower-dimensional space but yields a more stable and efficient adaptability towards new entities. | Ruijie Wang, Yutong Zhang, Jinyang Li, Shengzhong Liu, Dachun Sun, Tianchen Wang, Tianshi Wang, Yizhuo Chen, Denizhan Kara, Tarek F.

Wikidata is one of the largestpublic general-purpose KBs. Yet, its collaborative nature has led to aconvoluted schema and taxonomy. The YAGO 4 KB cleaned up the taxonomy byincorporating the ontology of Schema.org, resulting in a cleaner structureamenable to automated reasoning. However, it also cut away large parts of theWikidata taxonomy, which is essential for information retrieval. In this paper,we extend YAGO 4 with a large part of the Wikidata taxonomy - while respectinglogical constraints and the distinction between classes and instances. Thisyields YAGO 4.5, a new, logically consistent version of YAGO that adds a richlayer of informative classes. An intrinsic and an extrinsic evaluation show thevalue of the new resource. | Fabian M.

Our Information Retrieval (IR) community is notable for its experimental rigour: the use of statistical significance is grows across our publications. However, we show that ignoring the context of a test risks Type I errors, leading to potential publication bias. We examine two contexts: multiple testing and the types of the retrieval systems being compared. Our results show that multiple testing corrections are critical for experimental work. In addition, we find that past research on the reliability of test collections maybe flawed owing to the type of systems examined. The latter result has not been shown before. Together our results suggest substantial numbers of Type I errors in offline IR experiments. We detail a methodology to alleviate the errors. | Nicola Ferro, Mark Sanderson | RMIT University; University of Padova |

However, there is a lack of high-quality human-annotated CLIR resources for African languages: the few existing collections are mostly curated synthetically or from sources with limited corpora for these languages. We present CIRAL, a test collection for cross-lingual retrieval with English queries and passages in four African languages: Hausa, Somali, Swahili, and Yoruba. CIRAL's corpora are obtained from Indigenous African websites and consist of a total of over 2.5 million passages. We gathered over 1,600 queries and 30k high-quality binary relevance judgments annotated by native speakers of the languages. Additional pools were also obtained at CIRAL's shared task, which was hosted at the Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation 2023 to encourage community participation in CLIR for African languages. We describe the design and curation process of our test collection and provide reproducible baselines that demonstrate CIRAL's utility in evaluating the effectiveness of systems.

However, in contrast to standard NLP tasksthat inherently operate on human vocabulary, current research in generativerecommendations struggles to effectively encode recommendation items within thetext-to-text framework using concise yet meaningful ID representations. Tobetter align LLMs with recommendation needs, we propose IDGen, representingeach item as a unique, concise, semantically rich, platform-agnostic textual IDusing human language tokens. This is achieved by training a textual IDgenerator alongside the LLM-based recommender, enabling seamless integration ofpersonalized recommendations into natural language generation. Notably, as userhistory is expressed in natural language and decoupled from the originaldataset, our approach suggests the potential for a foundational generativerecommendation model. Experiments show that our framework consistentlysurpasses existing models in sequential recommendation under standardexperimental setting. Then, we explore the possibility of training a foundationrecommendation model with the proposed method on data collected from 19different datasets and tested its recommendation performance on 6 unseendatasets across different platforms under a completely zero-shot setting. Theresults show that the zero-shot performance of the pre-trained foundation modelis comparable to or even better than some traditional recommendation modelsbased on supervised training, showing the potential of the IDGen paradigmserving as the foundation model for generative recommendation.

To enhance robustness, self-supervised learning (SSL) has become a vital tool for data augmentation. Traditional methods often depend on fine-tuning with task-specific labels, limiting their effectiveness when labeled data is scarce. Our research tackles this by advancing graph model generalization in zero-shot learning environments. Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs), we aim to create a graph-oriented LLM capable of exceptional generalization across various datasets and tasks without relying on downstream graph data. We introduce the GraphGPT framework, which integrates LLMs with graph structural knowledge through graph instruction tuning. This framework includes a text-graph grounding component to link textual and graph structures and a dual-stage instruction tuning approach with a lightweight graph-text alignment projector. These innovations allow LLMs to comprehend complex graph structures and enhance adaptability across diverse datasets and tasks. Our framework demonstrates superior generalization in both supervised and zero-shot graph learning tasks, surpassing existing benchmarks.

However, the gap between training objectives and the discrepancy between data distributions in pretraining and downstream tasks hinders the transfer of the pretrained knowledge. Inspired by instruction-based prompts widely used in pretrained language models, we introduce instructions into graph pertaining. In this paper, we propose a novel pretraining framework named Instructionbased Hypergraph Pretraining. To overcome the discrepancy between pretraining and downstream tasks, text-based instructions provide explicit guidance on specific tasks for representation learning. Compared to learnable prompts, whose effectiveness depends on the quality and diversity of training data, text-based instructions intrinsically encapsulate task information and support the model's generalization beyond the structure seen during pretraining. To capture high-order relations with task information in a contextaware manner, a novel prompting hypergraph convolution layer is devised to integrate instructions into information propagation in hypergraphs. Extensive experiments conducted on three public datasets verify the superiority of IHP in various scenarios. | Mingdai Yang, Zhiwei Liu, Liangwei Yang, Xiaolong Liu, Chen Wang, Hao Peng, Philip S.

Each sentiment triplet consists of an aspect, corresponding opinion, and sentiment. Although extensive research has been conducted on the ASTE task, existing methods use the span representations to predict the relationship between spans, failing to consider the interrelation between span pairs. On the other hand, early fusion of entity information is critical for sentiment classification. In this paper, we propose an Enhanced Packed Marker with Entity Information (EPMEI) framework for ASTE task to address the above limitations of the existing works. Specifically, EPMEI consists of entity recognition and sentiment classification models. The entity information is obtained from the entity recognition model first. After that, we insert solid markers with entity information at the input layer of the sentiment classification model to highlight the subject span and improve subject span representation. Furthermore, we introduce a subject-oriented packing strategy, which packs each subject span and all its levitated markers of object spans to model the interrelation between the same-subject span pairs. Extensive experimental results on four ASTE benchmark datasets demonstrate that EPMEI achieves the state-of-the-art baseline.

Existing studies augment the text through the substitution of same type entities or language modeling, but suffer from the lower quality and the limited entity context patterns within low-resource corpora. In this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation method E2DA from both exogenous and endogenous perspectives. As for exogenous augmentation, we treat the limited manually annotated data as anchors, and leverage the powerful instruction-following capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to expand the anchors by generating data that are highly dissimilar from the original anchor texts in terms of entity mentions and contexts. As regards the endogenous augmentation, we explore diverse semantic directions in the implicit feature space of the original and expanded anchors for effective data augmentation. Our complementary augmentation method from two perspectives not only continuously expands the global text-level space, but also fully explores the local semantic space for more diverse data augmentation. Extensive experiments on 10 diverse datasets across various low-resource settings demonstrate that the proposed method excels significantly over prior state-of-the-art data augmentation methods. | Xinghua Zhang, Gaode Chen, Shiyao Cui, Jiawei Sheng, Tingwen Liu, Hongbo Xu | Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences |

ACE-2005 is widely recognised as the standard corpus in this field. While other corpora, like PropBank, primarily focus on annotating predicate-argument structure, ACE-2005 provides comprehensive information about the overall event structure and semantics. However, its limited language coverage restricts its usability. This paper introduces ACE-2005-PT, a corpus created by translating ACE-2005 into Portuguese, with European and Brazilian variants. To speed up the process of obtaining ACE-2005-PT, we rely on automatic translators. This, however, poses some challenges related to automatically identifying the correct alignments between multi-word annotations in the original text and in the corresponding translated sentence. To achieve this, we developed an alignment pipeline that incorporates several alignment techniques: lemmatization, fuzzy matching, synonym matching, multiple translations and a BERT-based word aligner. To measure the alignment effectiveness, a subset of annotations from the ACE-2005-PT corpus was manually aligned by a linguist expert. This subset was then compared against our pipeline results which achieved exact and relaxed match scores of 70.55% and 87.55% respectively. As a result, we successfully generated a Portuguese version of the ACE-2005 corpus, which has been accepted for publication by LDC. | Luís Filipe Cunha, Purificação Silvano, Ricardo Campos, Alípio Jorge | FCUP-University of Porto; FLUP-University of Porto; University of Beira Interior |

However, previous studies have shown they are vulnerable to maliciously crafted adversarial samples. Despite recent success, these methods are generally instance-specific and require generating perturbations for each input sample. In this paper, we reveal that VLP models are also vulnerable to the instance-agnostic universal adversarial perturbation (UAP). Specifically, we design a novel Contrastive-training Perturbation Generator with Cross-modal conditions (C-PGC) to achieve the attack. In light that the pivotal multimodal alignment is achieved through the advanced contrastive learning technique, we devise to turn this powerful weapon against themselves, i.e., employ a malicious version of contrastive learning to train the C-PGC based on our carefully crafted positive and negative image-text pairs for essentially destroying the alignment relationship learned by VLP models. Besides, C-PGC fully utilizes the characteristics of Vision-and-Language (V+L) scenarios by incorporating both unimodal and cross-modal information as effective guidance. Extensive experiments show that C-PGC successfully forces adversarial samples to move away from their original area in the VLP model's feature space, thus essentially enhancing attacks across various victim models and V+L tasks.

Furthermore, they often neglect the underlying user intents reflected by the bundles in the generation process, resulting in less intelligible bundles. This paper addresses these limitations through the exploration of two interrelated tasks, i.e., personalized bundle generation and the underlying intent inference, based on different user sessions. Inspired by the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), we propose an adaptive in-context learning paradigm, which allows LLMs to draw tailored lessons from related sessions as demonstrations, enhancing the performance on target sessions. Specifically, we first employ retrieval augmented generation to identify nearest neighbor sessions, and then carefully design prompts to guide LLMs in executing both tasks on these neighbor sessions. To tackle reliability and hallucination challenges, we further introduce (1) a self-correction strategy promoting mutual improvements of the two tasks without supervision signals and (2) an auto-feedback mechanism for adaptive supervision based on the distinct mistakes made by LLMs on different neighbor sessions. Thereby, the target session can gain customized lessons for improved performance by observing the demonstrations of its neighbor sessions. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. | Zhu Sun, Kaidong Feng, Jie Yang, Xinghua Qu, Hui Fang, YewSoon Ong, Wenyuan Liu | Delft University of Technology; Agency for Science, Technology and Research; Shanda AI-Lab; Yanshan University; Nanyang Technological University; Shanghai University of Finance and Economics |

Leveraging the advances insensing technologies, our study aims to characterize user behaviors withphysiological signals, particularly in relation to cognitive load, affectivearousal, and valence. We conduct a controlled lab study with 26 participants,and collect data including Electrodermal Activities, Photoplethysmogram,Electroencephalogram, and Pupillary Responses. This study examinesinformational search with four stages: the realization of Information Need(IN), Query Formulation (QF), Query Submission (QS), and Relevance Judgment(RJ). We also include different interaction modalities to represent modernsystems, e.g., QS by text-typing or verbalizing, and RJ with text or audioinformation. We analyze the physiological signals across these stages andreport outcomes of pairwise non-parametric repeated-measure statistical tests.The results show that participants experience significantly higher cognitiveloads at IN with a subtle increase in alertness, while QF requires higherattention. QS involves demanding cognitive loads than QF. Affective responsesare more pronounced at RJ than QS or IN, suggesting greater interest andengagement as knowledge gaps are resolved. To the best of our knowledge, thisis the first study that explores user behaviors in a search process employing amore nuanced quantitative analysis of physiological signals. Our findings offervaluable insights into user behavior and emotional responses in informationseeking processes. We believe our proposed methodology can inform thecharacterization of more complex processes, such as conversational informationseeking. | Kaixin Ji, Danula Hettiachchi, Flora D.

However, around 14% of errors remain. Additionally, current works use GPT-4 to only predict the correct option without providing any explanation and thus do not provide any insight into the thinking process and reasoning used by GPT-4 or other LLMs. Therefore, we introduce a new domain-specific error taxonomy derived from collaboration with medical students. Our GPT-4 USMLE Error (G4UE) dataset comprises 4153 GPT-4 correct responses and 919 incorrect responses to the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) respectively. These responses are quite long (258 words on average), containing detailed explanations from GPT-4 justifying the selected option. We then launch a large-scale annotation study using the Potato annotation platform and recruit 44 medical experts through Prolific, a well-known crowdsourcing platform. We annotated 300 out of these 919 incorrect data points at a granular level for different classes and created a multi-label span to identify the reasons behind the error. In our annotated dataset, a substantial portion of GPT-4's incorrect responses is categorized as a "Reasonable response by GPT-4," by annotators. This sheds light on the challenge of discerning explanations that may lead to incorrect options, even among trained medical professionals. We also provide medical concepts and medical semantic predications extracted using the SemRep tool for every data point. We believe that it will aid in evaluating the ability of LLMs to answer complex medical questions.

Simultaneously, emojis from the posts can help us better understand users' emotions and predict mental health conditions. However, research in emoji-based suicide analysis remains underexplored, with few resources available, which can restrict the development of studying emoji usage patterns among users with suicidal ideation. In this work, we build a derived suicide-related emoji dataset named SuicidEmoji, which contains 25k emoji posts (2,329 suicide-related posts and 22,722 posts for the control group users) filtered from about 1.3 million crawled Reddit data. To the best of our knowledge, SuicidEmoji is the first suicide-related emoji dataset. Based on SuicidEmoji, we propose two novel tasks: emoji-aware suicidal ideation detection and emoji prediction, for which we build two benchmark subdatasets from SuicidEmoji to evaluate the performance of advanced methods including pre-trained language models (PLMs) and large language models (LLMs). We analyze the experimental results of two PLMs and the highly capable LLMs, which reveal the significance and challenges of emoji-based suicide-related NLP tasks. | Tianlin Zhang, Kailai Yang, Shaoxiong Ji, Boyang Liu, Qianqian Xie, Sophia Ananiadou | The University of Manchester; University of Helsinki |

While there has been a significant increase in aspect-based sentiment analysis, yet the proposed methods' practical implications in real-world settings remain moot for their closed and irreproducible codebases, inability to accommodate datasets from various domains, and poor evaluation methodologies. LADy is an open-source benchmark toolkit with a standard pipeline and experimental details to fill the gaps. It incorporates a host of canonical models along with benchmark datasets from varying domains, including unsolicited online reviews. Leveraging an object-oriented design, LADy readily extends to new models and training datasets. The first of its kind, LADy also features review augmentation via natural language backtranslation that can be integrated into the training phase of the models to boost efficiency and improve efficacy during inference. LADy's codebase, along with the installation instructions and case studies on five datasets for seven methods with backtranslation augmentation over ten languages, can be obtained under cc-by-nc-sa-4.0 license at https://github.com/fani-lab/LADy. | Farinam Hemmatizadeh, Christine Wong, Alice Yu, Hossein Fani | University of Windsor School of Computer Science |
| 322 |  |  [A Reproducibility Study of PLAID](https://doi.org/10.1145/3626772.3657856) |  | 0 | The PLAID (Performance-optimized Late Interaction Driver) algorithm for ColBERTv2 uses clustered term representations to retrieve and progressively prune documents for final (exact) document scoring. In this paper, we reproduce and fill in missing gaps from the original work. By studying the parameters PLAID introduces, we find that its Pareto frontier is formed of a careful balance among its three parameters; deviations beyond the suggested settings can substantially increase latency without necessarily improving its effectiveness. We then compare PLAID with an important baseline missing from the paper: re-ranking a lexical system. We find that applying ColBERTv2 as a re-ranker atop an initial pool of BM25 results provides better efficiency-effectiveness trade-offs in low-latency settings. However, re-ranking cannot reach peak effectiveness at higher latency settings due to limitations in recall of lexical matching and provides a poor approximation of an exhaustive ColBERTv2 search. We find that recently proposed modifications to re-ranking that pull in the neighbors of top-scoring documents overcome this limitation, providing a Pareto frontier across all operational points for ColBERTv2 when evaluated using a well-annotated dataset. Curious about why re-ranking methods are highly competitive with PLAID, we analyze the token representation clusters PLAID uses for retrieval and find that most clusters are predominantly aligned with a single token and vice versa. Given the competitive trade-offs that re-ranking baselines exhibit, this work highlights the importance of carefully selecting pertinent baselines when evaluating the efficiency of retrieval engines. | Sean MacAvaney, Nicola Tonellotto | University of Glasgow; University of Pisa |

In recent years, we have witnessed the growing popularity of models based on representation learning, which naturally begs the question: How effective are these models when presented with queries and documents that differ from the training data? While BEIR was designed to answer this question, our work addresses two shortcomings that prevent the benchmark from achieving its full potential: First, the sophistication of modern neural methods and the complexity of current software infrastructure create barriers to entry for newcomers. To this end, we provide reproducible reference implementations that cover learned dense and sparse models. Second, comparisons on BEIR are performed by reducing scores from heterogeneous datasets into a single average that is difficult to interpret. To remedy this, we present meta-analyses focusing on effect sizes across datasets that are able to accurately quantify model differences. By addressing both shortcomings, our work facilitates future explorations in a range of interesting research questions. | Ehsan Kamalloo, Nandan Thakur, Carlos Lassance, Xueguang Ma, JhengHong Yang, Jimmy Lin | Naver Labs Europe; University of Waterloo |

Given a network and a small group of examples as seeds, these tasks involve identifying additional members of interest from the same community. While most existing expansion methods focus on defining a fixed metric function based on the network structure alone, they often overlook the rich content associated with nodes in attributed networks. In this paper, we bridge the gap by learning a deep metric that takes into account both the network structure and node attributes, and by utilizing the recent advanced graph neural networks as encoding functions. The key challenge lies in the extreme scarcity of given positive examples (i.e., the seed nodes) in real-world applications and the absence of negatives (i.e., non-members of the target community). We introduce Bootstrap Deep Metric (BDM), a graph deep metric learning framework for seed expansion problems. BDM utilizes previous versions of representations to generate anchors for positive and unlabeled nodes, and learns enhanced node representations by minimizing the metric losses on both positive and unlabeled nodes. It eliminates the need for negative nodes, while producing closely aligned representations for members of target community and uniformly distributed representations for non-members, which effectively aid in selecting expansion nodes. Experimental results on real-life datasets show that our BDM not only substantially outperforms state-of-the-art approaches but also remarkably surpasses fully labeled classification models in most cases.

It has been used to analyze various graphs. In the context of social networks, it requires the collection of each user's social relations, posing the risk of user privacy intrusion caused by untrusted servers. Local differential privacy is a widely adopted approach for providing privacy protection while allowing acceptable utility of the protected data for analytics. There has been growing research interest in applying local differential privacy protection to community detection. However, such protection approaches typically suffer from poor accuracy due to the excessive noise in the protected data. This paper proposes LDP-Cd, a two-phase community detection framework under local differential privacy. LDP-Cd initializes the community groups using the Louvain community detection algorithm and iteratively refines the community in the second phase. Besides, we propose an order-consistent data perturbation method over the degree vector, thus ensuring the ordering consistency of the fitness between the user and community groups, thereby improving the accuracy of community detection. Experimental results on real datasets show that LDP-Cd has significant advantages over existing methods regarding community detection accuracy and a trade-off between user privacy and community detection utility. | Taolin Guo, Shunshun Peng, Zhejian Zhang, Mengmeng Yang, KwokYan Lam | Chongqing Normal University; Data61 of Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization; Nanyang Technological University; Chongqing University |

Although great strides have been made in applying them to settings like document ranking and short-form text generation, they still struggle to compose complete, accurate, and verifiable long-form reports. Reports with these qualities are necessary to satisfy the complex, nuanced, or multi-faceted information needs of users. In this perspective paper, we draw together opinions from industry and academia, and from a variety of related research areas, to present our vision for automatic report generation, and---critically---a flexible framework by which such reports can be evaluated. In contrast with other summarization tasks, automatic report generation starts with a detailed description of an information need, stating the necessary background, requirements, and scope of the report. Further, the generated reports should be complete, accurate, and verifiable. These qualities, which are desirable---if not required---in many analytic report-writing settings, require rethinking how to build and evaluate systems that exhibit these qualities. To foster new efforts in building these systems, we present an evaluation framework that draws on ideas found in various evaluations. To test completeness and accuracy, the framework uses nuggets of information, expressed as questions and answers, that need to be part of any high-quality generated report.

Due to the limitation in the semantic understanding of retrieval models, the success of RAG heavily lies on the ability of LLMs to identify passages with utility. Recent efforts have explored the ability of LLMs to assess the relevance of passages in retrieval, but there has been limited work on evaluating the utility of passages in supporting question answering. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study about the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in utility evaluation for open-domain question answering (QA). Specifically, we introduce a benchmarking procedure and collection of candidate passages with different characteristics, facilitating a series of experiments with five representative LLMs. Our experiments reveal that: (i) well-instructed LLMs can distinguish between relevance and utility, and that LLMs are highly receptive to newly generated counterfactual passages. Moreover, (ii) we scrutinize key factors that affect utility judgments in the instruction design. And finally, (iii) to verify the efficacy of utility judgments in practical retrieval augmentation applications, we delve into LLMs' QA capabilities using the evidence judged with utility and direct dense retrieval results. (iv) We propose a.. -sampling, listwise approach to reduce the dependency of LLMs on the sequence of input passages, thereby facilitating subsequent answer generation. We believe that the way we formalize and study the problem along with our findings contributes to a critical assessment of retrieval-augmented LLMs. Our code and benchmark can be found at https://github.com/ict-bigdatalab/utility_judgments. | Hengran Zhang, Ruqing Zhang, Jiafeng Guo, Maarten de Rijke, Yixing Fan, Xueqi Cheng | University of Amsterdam; CAS Key Lab of Network Data Science and Technology, ICT, CAS;University of Chinese Academy of Sciences |
| 328 |  |  [CIQA: A Coding Inspired Question Answering Model](https://doi.org/10.1145/3626772.3657830) |  | 0 | Methods in question-answering (QA) that transform texts detailing processes into an intermediate code representation, subsequently executed to generate a response to the presented question, have demonstrated promising results in analyzing scientific texts that describe intricate processes. The limitations of these existing text-to-code models are evident when attempting to solve QA problems that require knowledge beyond what is presented in the input text. We propose a novel domain-agnostic model to address the problem by leveraging domain-specific and open-source code libraries. We introduce an innovative QA text-to-code algorithm that learns to represent and utilize external APIs from code repositories, such as GitHub, within the intermediate code representation. The generated code is then executed to answer a question about a text. We present three QA datasets, focusing on scientific problems in the domains of chemistry, astronomy, and biology, for the benefit of the community. Our study demonstrates that our proposed method is a competitive alternative to current state-of-the-art (SOTA) QA text-to-code models and generic SOTA QA models. | Mousa Arraf, Kira Radinsky | Technion |

Most existing works made efforts on using graph neural networks or Multi-modal Large Language Models to incorporate external knowledge for answer generation. Despite the promising results, they have limited interpretability and exhibit a deficiency in handling questions with unseen answers. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretable graph routing network (GRN) which explicitly conducts entity routing over a constructed scene knowledge graph step by step for KB-VQA. At each step, GRN keeps an entity score vector representing how likely of each entity to be activated as the answer, and a transition matrix representing the transition probability from one entity to another. To answer the given question, GRN will focus on certain keywords of the question at each step and correspondingly conduct entity routing by transiting the entity scores according to the transition matrix computed referring to the focused question keywords. In this way, it clearly provides the reasoning process of KB-VQA and can handle the questions with unseen answers without distinction. Experiments on the benchmark dataset KRVQA have demonstrated that GRN improves the performance of KB-VQA by a large margin, surpassing existing state-of-the art KB-VQA methods and Multi-modal Large Language Models, as well as shows competent capability in handling unseen answers and good interpretability in KB-VQA. | Duokang Wang, Linmei Hu, Rui Hao, Yingxia Shao, Xin Lv, Liqiang Nie, Juanzi Li | School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen); Beijing Institute of Technology; Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications; Tsinghua University |
| 330 |  |  [Flexible and Adaptable Summarization via Expertise Separation](https://doi.org/10.1145/3626772.3657789) |  | 0 | A proficient summarization model should exhibit both flexibility the capacity to handle a range of in-domain summarization tasks, and adaptability - the competence to acquire new knowledge and adjust to unseen out-of-domain tasks. Unlike large language models (LLMs) that achieve this through parameter scaling, we propose a more parameter-efficient approach in this study. Our motivation rests on the principle that the general summarization ability to capture salient information can be shared across different tasks, while the domain-specific summarization abilities need to be distinct and tailored. Concretely, we propose MoeSumm, a Mixture-of-Expert Summarization architecture, which utilizes a main expert for gaining the general summarization capability and deputy experts that selectively collaborate to meet specific summarization task requirements. We further propose a max-margin loss to stimulate the separation of these abilities. Our model's distinct separation of general and domain-specific summarization abilities grants it with notable flexibility and adaptability, all while maintaining parameter efficiency. MoeSumm achieves flexibility by managing summarization across multiple domains with a single model, utilizing a shared main expert and selected deputy experts. It exhibits adaptability by tailoring deputy experts to cater to out-of-domain few-shot and zero-shot scenarios. Experimental results on 11 datasets show the superiority of our model compared with recent baselines and LLMs. We also provide statistical and visual evidence of the distinct separation of the two abilities in MoeSumm. | Xiuying Chen, Mingzhe Li, Shen Gao, Xin Cheng, Qingqing Zhu, Rui Yan, Xin Gao, Xiangliang Zhang | Shandong University; Ant Group; PEKING UNIVERSITY; Peking University; University of Notre Dame; Renmin University of China; KAUST |

In times when such answers are readily accessible to anyone, the stimulation and preservation of human's cognitive abilities, as well as the assurance of maintaining good reasoning skills by humans becomes crucial. This study addresses such needs by proposing hints (instead of final answers or before giving answers) as a viable solution. We introduce a framework for the automatic hint generation for factoid questions, employing it to construct TriviaHG, a novel large-scale dataset featuring 160,230 hints corresponding to 16,645 questions from the TriviaQA dataset. Additionally, we present an automatic evaluation method that measures the Convergence and Familiarity quality attributes of hints. To evaluate the TriviaHG dataset and the proposed evaluation method, we enlisted 10 individuals to annotate 2,791 hints and tasked 6 humans with answering questions using the provided hints. The effectiveness of hints varied, with success rates of 96%, 78%, and 36% for questions with easy, medium, and hard answers, respectively. Moreover, the proposed automatic evaluation methods showed a robust correlation with annotators' results. Conclusively, the findings highlight three key insights: the facilitative role of hints in resolving unknown questions, the dependence of hint quality on answer difficulty, and the feasibility of employing automatic evaluation methods for hint assessment. | Jamshid Mozafari, Anubhav Jangra, Adam Jatowt | University of Innsbruck; Columbia University |

However, the efficacy of these systems is intricately linked to the quality of user-provided prompts, which often poses a challenge to users unfamiliar with prompt crafting. This paper addresses this challenge by leveraging user reformulation data from interaction logs to develop an automatic prompt reformulation model. Our in-depth analysis of these logs reveals that user prompt reformulation is heavily dependent on the individual user's capability, resulting in significant variance in the quality of reformulation pairs. To effectively use this data for training, we introduce the Capability-aware Prompt Reformulation (CAPR) framework. CAPR innovatively integrates user capability into the reformulation process through two key components: the Conditional Reformulation Model (CRM) and Configurable Capability Features (CCF). CRM reformulates prompts according to a specified user capability, as represented by CCF. The CCF, in turn, offers the flexibility to tune and guide the CRM's behavior. This enables CAPR to effectively learn diverse reformulation strategies across various user capacities and to simulate high-capability user reformulation during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate CAPR's superior performance over existing baselines and its remarkable robustness on unseen systems. Furthermore, comprehensive analyses validate the effectiveness of different components. CAPR can facilitate user-friendly interaction with text-to-image systems and make advanced artistic creation more achievable for a broader range of users. | Jingtao Zhan, Qingyao Ai, Yiqun Liu, Jia Chen, Shaoping Ma | Xiaohongshu Inc; Tsinghua University |

These collections cover a wide range of content, including online courses, TV series, movies, and cartoons. However, short video creators occasionally publish videos in a disorganized manner due to various reasons, such as revisions, secondary creations, deletions, and reissues, which often result in a poor browsing experience for users. Therefore, accurately reordering videos within a collection based on their content coherence is a vital task that can enhance user experience and presents an intriguing research problem in the field of video narrative reasoning. In this work, we curate a dedicated multimodal dataset for this Short Video Ordering (SVO) task and present the performance of some benchmark methods on the dataset. In addition, we further propose an advanced SVO framework with the aid of position decoding and successor prediction. The proposed framework combines both pairwise and listwise ordering paradigms, which can get rid of the issues from both quadratic growth and cascading conflict in the pairwise paradigm, and improve the performance of existing listwise methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves the best performance on our open SVO dataset, and each component of the framework contributes to the final performance. Both the SVO dataset and code will be released at https://github.com/ShipingGe/SVO. | Shiping Ge, Qiang Chen, Zhiwei Jiang, Yafeng Yin, Ziyao Chen, Qing Gu | Tencent WeChat; Nanjing University State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology |

Existing researches explore the keyinformation in case facts to yield the court views. Most of them employ acoarse-grained approach that partitions the facts into broad segments (e.g.,verdict-related sentences) to make predictions. However, this approach fails tocapture the complex details present in the case facts, such as various criminalelements and legal events. To this end, in this paper, we propose an EventGrounded Generation (EGG) method for criminal court view generation withcooperative (Large) Language Models, which introduces the fine-grained eventinformation into the generation. Specifically, we first design a LLMs-basedextraction method that can extract events in case facts without massiveannotated events. Then, we incorporate the extracted events into court viewgeneration by merging case facts and events. Besides, considering thecomputational burden posed by the use of LLMs in the extraction phase of EGG,we propose a LLMs-free EGG method that can eliminate the requirement for eventextraction using LLMs in the inference phase. Extensive experimental results ona real-world dataset clearly validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. | Linan Yue, Qi Liu, Lili Zhao, Li Wang, Weibo Gao, Yanqing An | ByteDance; University of Science and Technology of China |

There are several key challenges in LSI, such as (i)~usage of label (statute) semantics which can be complicated and confusing; (ii)~the input text (i.e., the facts) are very long and noisy; (iii)~the label distribution usually follows a long tail, making predictions for the rare labels challenging. Although multiple methods have been proposed to address these challenges, there has not been any comprehensive study to establish the effects of these factors on different models/approaches. In this work, we reproduce several LSI models on two popular LSI datasets and study the effect of the above-mentioned challenges. We conduct thorough experiments with transformer-based encoders such as BERT and Longformer. We further try out different combinations of these encoders with approaches devised specifically for LSI, which essentially use different mechanisms to model the statute texts to enhance fact representations. Our experiments yield several interesting insights into how the above-mentioned challenges are addressed by different models, the interplay of different encoding and statute text handling measures, and how the nature of the LSI datasets affects the model performances. Finally, we also analyze the explanability capabilities of different approaches using human-annotated rationales. | Shounak Paul, Rajas Bhatt, Pawan Goyal, Saptarshi Ghosh | Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur; Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur; IIT Kharagpur |

These factors also increase the costs of annotating large datasets, which are required to train state-of-the-art summarization systems. To address these challenges, we introduce CivilSum, a collection of 23,350 legal case decisions from the Supreme Court of India and other Indian High Courts paired with human-written summaries. Compared to previous datasets such as IN-Abs, CivilSum not only has more legal decisions but also provides shorter and more abstractive summaries, thus offering a challenging benchmark for legal summarization. Unlike other domains such as news articles, our analysis shows the most important content tends to appear at the end of the documents. We measure the effect of this tail bias on summarization performance using strong architectures for long-document abstractive summarization, and the results highlight the importance of long sequence modeling for the proposed task. CivilSum and related code are publicly available to the research community to advance text summarization in the legal domain. | Manuj Malik, Zheng Zhao, Marcio Fonseca, Shrisha Rao, Shay B.

Investigating Large Language Models on Math Stack Exchange](https://doi.org/10.1145/3626772.3657945) |  | 0 | Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in various natural language tasks, often achieving performances that surpass those of humans. Despite these advancements, the domain of mathematics presents a distinctive challenge, primarily due to its specialized structure and the precision it demands. In this work, we follow a two-step approach to investigating the proficiency of LLMs in answering mathematical questions. First, we employ the most effective LLMs, as identified by their performance on math question-answer benchmarks, to generate answers to 78 questions from the Math Stack Exchange (MSE). Second, a case analysis is conducted on the LLM that showed the highest performance, focusing on the quality and accuracy of its answers through manual evaluation. We found that GPT-4 performs best (nDCG of 0.48 and P@10 of 0.37) amongst existing LLMs fine-tuned for answering mathematics questions and outperforms the current best approach on ArqMATH3 Task1, considering P@10. Our case analysis indicates that while GPT-4 can generate relevant answers, it isn't consistently accurate. This paper explores the current limitations of LLMs in navigating complex mathematical question-answering. | Ankit Satpute, Noah Gießing, André GreinerPetter, Moritz Schubotz, Olaf Teschke, Akiko Aizawa, Bela Gipp | University of Göttingen, Germany; FIZ Karlsruhe – Leibniz Institute for Information Infrastructure; Technical University, Berlin; National Insutitute of Informatics |

Each of these directions however shows different benefits. This motivates our work to study hybrid human-AI approaches jointly leveraging the potential of large language models and crowdsourcing, which is understudied to date. We propose novel combination strategies Model First, Worker First, and Meta Vote, which we evaluate along with baseline methods such as mean, median, hard- and soft-voting. Using 120 statements from the PolitiFact dataset, and a combination of state-of-the-art AI models and crowdsourced assessments, we evaluate the effectiveness of these combination strategies. Results suggest that the effectiveness varies with scales granularity, and that combining AI and human judgments enhances truthfulness assessments' effectiveness and robustness. | Xia Zeng, David La Barbera, Kevin Roitero, Arkaitz Zubiaga, Stefano Mizzaro | University of Udine; Università Degli Studi Di Udine; Queen Mary University of London |

Authorship representation learning using neural networks has been shown to work in open-set environment settings with hundreds of thousands of authors. However, the performance of authorship attribution models often degrades significantly when texts are from different domains than the training data. In this work, we propose addressing this issue by adopting a novel causal framework for authorship representation learning. Our key insight is to use causal interventions during training to make models robust to differences in domains. Specifically, we introduce generating style-counterfactual examples by retrieving the most similar content texts by different authors on the same topics/domains. This exposes the model to challenging examples with similar content but distinct styles. Furthermore, we introduce causal masking of topic-indicative words to generate content-counterfactual examples. Content-counterfactuals hide topic content to encourage focusing on writing style. Experiments on three disparate domains - Amazon reviews, fanfiction stories, and Reddit comments - demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods for authorship attribution. | Hieu Man, Thien Huu Nguyen | University of Oregon |

This development marks significant progress towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). Despite their superior performance, LLMs often exhibit limitations when adapted to domain-specific tasks through instruction fine-tuning (IF). The primary challenge lies in the discrepancy between the data distribution in general and domain-specific contexts, leading to suboptimal accuracy in specialized tasks. To address this, continual instruction fine-tuning (CIF), particularly supervised fine-tuning (SFT), on targeted domain-specific instruction datasets is necessary. Our ablation study reveals that the structure of these instruction datasets critically influences CIF performance, with substantial data distributional shifts resulting in notable performance degradation. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that enhances CIF by promoting format uniformity. We assess our approach using the Llama2 chat model across various domain-specific instruction datasets. The results demonstrate not only an improvement in task-specific performance under CIF but also a reduction in catastrophic forgetting (CF). This study contributes to the optimization of LLMs for domain-specific applications, highlighting the significance of data structure and distribution in CIF. | Xiaoyu Tan, Leijun Cheng, Xihe Qiu, Shaojie Shi, Yuan Cheng, Wei Chu, Yinghui Xu, Yuan Qi | Shanghai University of Engineering Science; INF Technology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd.; Fudan University |

These stakeholders, ranging from policymakers to opposition figures, citizens, and more, play pivotal roles in shaping news narratives. Recognizing their stakeholder types, reflecting their roles, political alignments, social standing, and more, is paramount for a nuanced comprehension of news content. Despite existing works focusing on salient entity extraction, coverage variations, and political affiliations through social media data, the automated detection of stakeholder roles within news content remains an underexplored domain. In this paper, we bridge this gap by introducing an effective approach to classify stakeholder types in news articles. Our method involves transforming the stakeholder classification problem into a natural language inference task, utilizing contextual information from news articles and external knowledge to enhance the accuracy of stakeholder type detection. Moreover, our proposed model showcases efficacy in zero-shot settings, further extending its applicability to diverse news contexts. | Alapan Kuila, Sudeshna Sarkar | IIT KHARAGPUR |

A key challenge in Text-to-SQL parsing is developing effective encoding mechanisms to capture the complex relationships between question words, database schemas, and their associated connections within the heterogeneous graph structure. Existing approaches typically introduce some useful multi-hop structures manually and then incorporate them into graph neural networks (GNNs) by stacking multiple layers, which (1) ignore the difficult-to-identify but meaningful semantics embedded in the multi-hop reasoning path, and (2) are limited by the expressive capability of GNN to capture long-range dependencies among the heterogeneous graph. To address these shortcomings, we introduce GRL-SQL, a graph reasoning enhanced language model, which innovatively applies structure encoding to capture the dependencies between node pairs, encompassing one-hop, multi-hop and distance information, subsequently enriched through self-attention for enhanced representational power over GNNs. Furthermore, GRL-SQL incorporates an interaction module that enables joint reasoning and fusion over the question-schema representations for enhancing global context modeling. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed GRL-SQL. | Zheng Gong, Ying Sun | Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou); Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) AI Thrust |

Despite the progress made, existing research on masked GAEs predominantly relies on a random strategy to obscure input graph characteristics, disregarding the potential variability in node importance during the reconstruction process. In this study, we propose an efficient masking strategy termed importance-inspired dynamic masking to explore diverse node sampling. Our approach employs an auxiliary network to assess the importance of nodes within the graph. Subsequently, we derive sampling probabilities guided by the learned node importance. To enhance model training, we introduce a dynamic sampling strategy that adapts to nodes of varying importance across different training stages. This importance-inspired dynamic masking strategy empowers masked GAEs to acquire refined representations for graph-related tasks. We have conducted extensive experiments on node classification, which validate the efficacy of our proposed strategy. | Ge Chen, Yulan Hu, Sheng Ouyang, Zhirui Yang, Yong Liu, Cuicui Luo | University of Chinese Academy of Sciences; Renmin University of China |

Both texts and visuals play key roles in the debate, as they can complement, contradict, or reinforce each other in nuanced ways. It is therefore urgently needed to study the messages as multimodal objects to better understand the polarized debate about climate change impacts and policies. Multimodal representation models such as CLIP are known to be able to transfer knowledge across domains and modalities, enabling the investigation of textual and visual semantics together. Yet they are not directly able to distinguish the nuances between supporting and sceptic climate change stances. This paper explores a simple but effective strategy combining modality fusion and domain-knowledge enhancing to prepare CLIP-based models with knowledge of climate change stances. A multimodal Dutch Twitter dataset is collected and experimented with the proposed strategy, which increased the macro-average F1 score across stances from 51% to 86%. The outcomes can be applied in both data science and public policy studies, to better analyse how the combined use of texts and visuals generates meanings during debates, in the context of climate change and beyond. | Nan Bai, Ricardo da Silva Torres, Anna Fensel, Tamara Metze, Art Dewulf | Delft University of Technology; Wageningen University & Research |

There has not been much exploration into developing efficient methods for summarizing financial documents, which often contain complex facts and figures. Here, we study the problem of bullet point summarization of long Earning Call Transcripts (ECTs) using the recently released ECTSum dataset. We leverage an unsupervised question-based extractive module followed by a parameter efficient instruction-tuned abstractive module to solve this task. Our proposed model FLANFinBPS achieves new state-of-the-art performances outperforming the strongest baseline with 14.88% average ROUGE score gain, and is capable of generating factually consistent bullet point summaries that capture the important facts discussed in the ECTs.

However, existing methodologies face certain challenges, including latent factors affecting citation behaviors and dynamic intrinsic of citation networks. To address these challenges, this study introduces a novel framework named CoDy (modeling scholarly Collaboration and temporal Dynamics in citation networks for impact prediction). CoDy strategically predicts author collaborations as an auxiliary task, forecasting not only the number of current collaborations between scholars but also the number of future collaborations among them. Besides, CoDy proposes a fine-grained temporal encoding module to model the multiple different temporal patterns for publication and citation. Extensive experimental validations demonstrate CoDy's effectiveness in predicting citation counts and classifying impact levels. In-depth analyses provide further validation of its reliability and robustness. CoDy can significantly enhance impact prediction by explicitly modeling collaboration and temporal patterns and offer valuable insights into paper impact formation. | Pengwei Yan, Yangyang Kang, Zhuoren Jiang, Kaisong Song, Tianqianjin Lin, Changlong Sun, Xiaozhong Liu | Alibaba Group; Worcester Polytechnic Institute; Zhejiang University; Northeastern UniversityAlibaba Group |

However, most approaches currently used for learning hypergraph representations do not consider pairwise relationships between nodes. While high-order relationships provide insight into the general connections among nodes in a group, they do not reveal the pairwise relationships between individual nodes within that group. Considering that it is unlikely for all nodes in the same group to share identical relationships, we argue that considering pairwise relationships is a critical aspect. In this paper, we propose Multi-view Mixed Attention for Contrastive Learning (MMACL) to address the aforementioned problem. MMACL proposes Mixed-Attention, which blends high-order relationships derived from the hypergraph attention network and pairwise relationships derived from the graph attention network. Then, it performs node-level contrastive learning to the graph structure with different views learned at each layer to finally obtain an expressive node representation. Our extensive experimental results on several popular datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed MMACL for hypergraph node classification.

Most previous studies used dense retrieval methods for applying RAG in question answering scenarios. However, recent work showed that traditional information retrieval methods (a.k.a. sparse methods) can do as well as or even better than dense retrieval ones. In particular, it was shown that Okapi BM25 outperforms dense retrieval methods, in terms of perplexity, for the fundamental text completion task in LLMs. We extend this study and show, using two popular LLMs, that a broad set of sparse retrieval methods achieve better results than all the dense retrieval methods we experimented with, for varying lengths of queries induced from the prompt. Furthermore, we found that Okapi BM25 is substantially outperformed by a term-proximity retrieval method (MRF), which is in turn outperformed by a pseudo-feedback-based bag-of-terms approach (relevance model). Additional exploration sheds some light on the effectiveness of lexical retrieval methods for RAG. Our findings call for further study of classical retrieval methods for RAG. | Oz Huly, Idan Pogrebinsky, David Carmel, Oren Kurland, Yoelle Maarek | TechnionTechnology Innovation Institute; Technion; Technology Innovation Institute; Technion Faculty of Data and Decision Sciences |

Understanding how INs physically manifesthas long been a complex and elusive process. However, recent studies utilisingElectroencephalography (EEG) data have provided real-time insights into theneural processes associated with INs. Unfortunately, they have yet todemonstrate how this insight can practically benefit the search experience. Assuch, within this study, we explore the ability to predict the realisation ofIN within EEG data across 14 subjects whilst partaking in a Question-Answering(Q/A) task. Furthermore, we investigate the combinations of EEG features thatyield optimal predictive performance, as well as identify regions within theQ/A queries where a subject's realisation of IN is more pronounced. Thefindings from this work demonstrate that EEG data is sufficient for thereal-time prediction of the realisation of an IN across all subjects with anaccuracy of 73.5% (SD 2.6%) and on a per-subject basis with an accuracy of90.1% (SD 22.1%). This work helps to close the gap by bridging theoreticalneuroscientific advancements with tangible improvements in informationretrieval practices, paving the way for real-time prediction of the realisationof IN. | Niall McGuire, Yashar Moshfeghi | Strathclyde University NeuraSearch Lab; University of Strathclyde NeuraSearch Lab |

Such limitation motivates us to pose the problemof the time-aware personalized information diffusion prediction for the firsttime, telling the time when the target user will be informed. In this paper, weaddress this problem from a fresh geometric perspective of Ricci curvature, andpropose a novel Ricci-curvature regulated Ordinary Differential Equation(R-ODE). In the diffusion process, R-ODE considers that the inter-correlatedusers are organized in a dynamic system in the representation space, and thecascades give the observations sampled from the continuous realm. At eachinfection time, the message diffuses along the largest Ricci curvature,signifying less transportation effort. In the continuous realm, the messagetriggers users' movement, whose trajectory in the space is parameterized by anODE with graph neural network. Consequently, R-ODE predicts the infection timeof a target user by the movement trajectory learnt from the observations.Extensive experiments evaluate the personalized time prediction ability ofR-ODE, and show R-ODE outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines. | Li Sun, Jingbin Hu, Mengjie Li, Hao Peng | North China Electric Power University; Beihang University |

Various strategies have been developed to overcome this challenge, such as those based on string-matching rules, manually crafted thesauri, and machine learning models. However, these methods are constrained by limited prior biomedical knowledge and can hardly generalize beyond the limited amounts of rules, thesauri, or training samples. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive results in diverse biomedical NLP tasks due to their unprecedentedly rich prior knowledge and strong zero-shot prediction abilities. However, LLMs suffer from issues including high costs, limited context length, and unreliable predictions. In this research, we propose PromptLink, a novel biomedical concept linking framework that leverages LLMs. Empirical results on the concept linking task between two EHR datasets and an external biomedical KG demonstrate the effectiveness of PromptLink. Furthermore, PromptLink is a generic framework without reliance on additional prior knowledge, context, or training data, making it well-suited for concept linking across various types of data sources.

The key point of modeling repeatconsumption is capturing the temporal patterns between a user's repeatedconsumption of the items. Existing studies often rely on heuristic assumptions,such as assuming an exponential distribution for the temporal gaps. However,due to the high complexity of real-world recommender systems, these pre-defineddistributions may fail to capture the intricate dynamic user consumptionpatterns, leading to sub-optimal performance. Drawing inspiration from theflexibility of neural ordinary differential equations (ODE) in capturing thedynamics of complex systems, we propose ReCODE, a novel model-agnosticframework that utilizes neural ODE to model repeat consumption. ReCODEcomprises two essential components: a user's static preference predictionmodule and the modeling of user dynamic repeat intention. By considering bothimmediate choices and historical consumption patterns, ReCODE offerscomprehensive modeling of user preferences in the target context. Moreover,ReCODE seamlessly integrates with various existing recommendation models,including collaborative-based and sequential-based models, making it easilyapplicable in different scenarios. Experimental results on two real-worlddatasets consistently demonstrate that ReCODE significantly improves theperformance of base models and outperforms other baseline methods. | Sunhao Dai, Changle Qu, Sirui Chen, Xiao Zhang, Jun Xu | Renmin University of China Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence; University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign |

RLStop is trained onexample rankings using a reward function to identify the optimal point to stopexamining documents. Experiments at a range of target recall levels on multiplebenchmark datasets (CLEF e-Health, TREC Total Recall, and Reuters RCV1)demonstrated that RLStop substantially reduces the workload required to screena document collection for relevance.

While this capability is useful for quickly comprehending event sequences without reading lengthy descriptions, timeline summarization remains a relatively underexplored area in recent years when compared to traditional document summarization task and their evolution. The advent of large language models (LLMs) has led some to presume summarization as a solved problem. However, timeline summarization poses unique challenges for LLMs. Our investigation is centered on evaluating the performance of LLMs, against state-of-the-art models in this field. We employed three different approaches: chunking, knowledge graph-based summarization, and TimeRanker. Each of these methods was systematically tested on three benchmark datasets for timeline summarization to assess their effectiveness in capturing and condensing key events and their evolution within timelines. Our findings reveal that while LLMs show promise, timeline summarization remains a complex task that is not yet fully resolved. | Daivik Sojitra, Raghav Jain, Sriparna Saha, Adam Jatowt, Manish Gupta | University of Innsbruck, Austria; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Patna; Microsoft, India |

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the state-of-the-art approach for many high-impact, real-world graph applications. For feature-rich graphs, a prevalent practice involves utilizing a PM directly to generate features, without incorporating any domain adaptation techniques. Nevertheless, this practice is suboptimal because the node features extracted from PM are graph-agnostic and prevent GNNs from fully utilizing the potential correlations between the graph structure and node features, leading to a decline in GNNs performance. In this work, we seek to improve the node features obtained from a PM for downstream graph tasks and introduce TOUCHUP-G, which has several advantages. It is (a) General: applicable to any downstream graph task, including link prediction which is often employed in recommender systems; (b) Multi-modal: able to improve raw features of any modality (e.g. images, texts, audio); (c) Principled: it is closely related to a novel metric, feature homophily, which we propose to quantify the potential correlations between the graph structure and node features and we show that TOUCHUP-G can effectively shrink the discrepancy between the graph structure and node features; (d) Effective: achieving state-of-the-art results on four real-world datasets spanning different tasks and modalities. | Jing Zhu, Xiang Song, Vassilis N.

| 358 |  |  [An Integrated Data Processing Framework for Pretraining Foundation Models](https://doi.org/10.1145/3626772.3657671) |  | 0 | The ability of the foundation models heavily relies on large-scale, diverse, and high-quality pretraining data. In order to improve data quality, researchers and practitioners often have to manually curate datasets from difference sources and develop dedicated data cleansing pipeline for each data repository. Lacking a unified data processing framework, this process is repetitive and cumbersome. To mitigate this issue, we propose a data processing framework that integrates a Processing Module which consists of a series of operators at different granularity levels, and an Analyzing Module which supports probing and evaluation of the refined data. The proposed framework is easy to use and highly flexible. In this demo paper, we first introduce how to use this framework with some example use cases and then demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the data quality with an automated evaluation with ChatGPT and an end-to-end evaluation in pretraining the GPT-2 model. The code and demonstration video are accessible on GitHub. | Yiding Sun, Feng Wang, Yutao Zhu, Wayne Xin Zhao, Jiaxin Mao | Renmin University of China Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence |

Extensive research is conducted by companies to comprehend the emotions conveyed in video advertisements, as they play a crucial role in crafting memorable commercials. Understanding and explaining these abstract concepts in videos is an unsolved problem. There is a large body of work that tries to predict human emotion or activity from videos, however, this is not sufficient. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for detecting and, most importantly, explaining emotions in video advertisements. Our framework consists of two main stages: emotion detection and explanation generation. We use a deep learning model to detect the underlying emotions of a video advertisement and generate visual explanations to give insight into our model's predictions. We demonstrate our system on a dataset of video advertisements and show that our framework can accurately detect and explain emotions in video advertisements. Our results suggest that our novel algorithm has the potential to explain decisions from any video classification model. | Joachim Vanneste, Manisha Verma, Debasis Ganguly | University of Glasgow; Amazon |

It supports over 90 languages andutilizes transformer models to assist humans in the labor-intensive process offact verification. This demonstration showcases a complete workflow thatdetects text claims in need of verification, generates relevant search enginequeries, and retrieves appropriate documents from the web. It employs NaturalLanguage Inference (NLI) to predict the veracity of claims and uses LLMs tosummarize the evidence and suggest textual revisions to correct any errors inthe text.

This process is crucial for various applications, such as natural language understanding, question-answering systems, and knowledge-driven decision-making. However the difficulty lies in the complexity of natural language, which is nuanced, ambiguous, and context-dependent. Extracting accurate and reliable information requires overcoming challenges such as entity disambiguation and relation extraction which are time-consuming tasks for users.Shadowfax is an interactive platform designed to support users by streamlining the process of knowledge base population (KPB) from text documents. Unlike other existing tools, it relies on a unified machine learning model to extract relevant information from unstructured text, enabling operational agents to gain a quick overview. The proposed system supports a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks using a single architecture, while presenting information in the most comprehensive way possible to the end user. | Maxime Prieur, Cédric du Mouza, Guillaume Gadek, Bruno Grilhères | Conservatoire national des arts et métiers; Airbus Defence and Space |

In this paper we present SynDy, a framework for Synthetic Dynamic Dataset Generation to leverage the capabilities of the largest frontier Large Language Models (LLMs) to train local, specialized language models. To the best of our knowledge, SynDy is the first paper utilizing LLMs to create fine-grained synthetic labels for tasks of direct relevance to misinformation mitigation, namely Claim Matching, Topical Clustering, and Claim Relationship Classification. SynDy utilizes LLMs and social media queries to automatically generate distantly-supervised, topically focused datasets with synthetic labels on these three tasks, providing essential tools to scale up human-led fact-checking at a fraction of the cost of human-annotated data. Training on SynDy's generated labels shows improvement over a standard baseline and is not significantly worse compared to training on human labels (which may be infeasible to acquire). SynDy is being integrated into Meedan's chatbot tiplines that are used by over 50 organizations, serve over 230K users annually, and automatically distribute human-written fact-checks via messaging apps such as WhatsApp. SynDy will also be integrated into our deployed Co center dot Insights toolkit, enabling low-resource organizations to launch tiplines for their communities. Finally, we envision SynDy enabling additional fact-checking tools such as matching new misinformation claims to high-quality explainers on common misinformation topics. | Michael Shliselberg, Ashkan Kazemi, Scott A.

TextData was developed based on the Community Digital Library (CDL) system. Although the CDL allowed users to bookmark webpages with plain text and provided search and recommendation, it fell short in key features. To better help users save what they know, TextData offers the addition of markdown to submissions for providing a richer method of note-taking. To better help users find what they don't, TextData provides methods for visualizing the relationships among submissions and provides in-context interactive search intent prediction with question-answering via a generative large language model. TextData is free-to-use, can be accessed online, and the source code is publicly available. | Kevin Ros, Kedar Takwane, Ashwin Patil, Rakshana Jayaprakash, ChengXiang Zhai | University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign |

However, these LLM-based evaluation methods are invariably based on proprietary LLMs. Despite their remarkable capabilities, proprietary LLMs are costly and subject to internal changes that can affect their output, which inhibits the reproducibility of their results and limits the widespread adoption of LLM-based evaluation. In this demo, we aim to use publicly available LLMs for standardizing LLM-based QA evaluation. However, open-source LLMs lag behind their proprietary counterparts. We overcome this gap by adopting chain-of-thought prompting with self-consistency to build a reliable evaluation framework. We demonstrate that our evaluation framework, based on 750M and 7B open LLMs, correlates competitively with human judgment, compared to most recent GPT-3 and GPT-4 models. | Ehsan Kamalloo, Shivani Upadhyay, Jimmy Lin | University of Waterloo |

To address this issue, we developed a fact-checking system Truth-O-Meter12 which verifies LLM results on the Internet and other sources of information to detect wrong claims/facts and proposes corrections for them. NLP and reasoning techniques such as Abstract Meaning Representation and syntactic alignment are applied to match hallucinating sentences with truthful ones. To handle inconsistent sources while fact-checking, we rely on argumentation analysis in the form of defeasible logic programming, selecting the most authoritative source. Our evaluation shows that LLM content can be substantially improved for factual correctness and meaningfulness on an industrial scale. | Boris Galitsky, Anton Chernyavskiy, Dmitry I.

It can contribute heavily towards the overall customer satisfaction. However, high-quality service can become expensive, creating an incentive to make it as cost efficient as possible and prompting most companies to utilize AI-powered assistants, or "chat bots". On the other hand, human-to-human interaction is still desired by customers, especially when it comes to complex scenarios such as disputes and sensitive topics like bill payment. This raises the bar for customer service agents. They need to accurately understand the customer's question or concern, identify a solution that is acceptable yet feasible (and within the company's policy), all while handling multiple conversations at once. In this work, we introduce "Ask Me Anything" (AMA) as an add-on feature to an agent-facing customer service interface. AMA allows agents to ask questions to a large language model (LLM) on demand, as they are handling customer conversations---the LLM provides accurate responses in real-time, reducing the amount of context switching the agent needs. In our internal experiments, we find that agents using AMA versus a traditional search experience spend approximately 10% fewer seconds per conversation containing a search, translating to millions of dollars of savings annually. Agents that used the AMA feature provided positive feedback nearly 80% of the time, demonstrating its usefulness as an AI-assisted feature for customer care. | Scott Rome, Tianwen Chen, Raphael Tang, Luwei Zhou, Ferhan Ture | Comcast |

Compared with traditional knowledge graphs, UKGs possess the capability of uncertainty knowledge expression, which facilitates more reliable and precise knowledge graph reasoning by not only completing missing triples but also predicting triple confidences. In this paper, we release unKR, the first open-source python library for uncertain Knowledge graph (UKG) Reasoning by representation learning. We design a unified framework to implement two types of representation learning models for UKG reasoning, i.e., normal and few-shot ones. Besides, we standardize the evaluation tasks and metrics for UKG reasoning to ensure fair comparisons, and report the detailed results of each model under the consistent test setting. With unKR, it is effortless for users to reproduce existing models, as well as efficiently customize their own models. | Jingting Wang, Tianxing Wu, Shilin Chen, Yunchang Liu, Shutong Zhu, Wei Li, Jingyi Xu, Guilin Qi | Southeast University |

This has driven the need for scalable, automatic, reliable, and cost-effective methods to evaluate the quality of LLM-generated text. What is meant by evaluating an LLM is not yet well defined and there are widely different expectations about what kind of information evaluation will produce. Evaluation methods that were developed for traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks (before the rise of LLMs) remain applicable but are not sufficient for capturing high-level semantic qualities of summaries. Emerging evaluation methods that use LLMs to evaluate LLM-output, appear to be powerful but lacking in reliability. New elements of LLM generated text that were not an element of previous NLP tasks, such as the artifacts of hallucination, need to be considered. We outline the different types of LLM evaluation currently used in the literature but focus on offline, system-level evaluation of the text generated by LLMs. Evaluating LLM-generated summaries is a complex and fast-evolving area, and we propose strategies for applying evaluation methods to avoid common pitfalls. Despite having promising strategies for evaluating LLM summaries, we highlight some open challenges that remain. | Tempest A. van Schaik, Brittany Pugh | Microsoft |

In particular, text-to-image generation models offer a novel approach to guiding the image generation process using natural language input, which is inspiring for multimodal search advertising. Traditional multimodal search ads require advertisers to prepare ad creatives, such as ad images, which is time-consuming and requires uniform image specifications and content quality inspection. To this end, we propose a streamlined generation framework for search ad image creatives. First, we prepare a Chinese image caption model with high-quality image-caption pairs to bootstrap training data refinement. With curated high-quality images and synthesized descriptive captions, we then train a Chinese text-to-image generation model, the largest to date, using SDXL and a 10-billion multimodal text encoder. Specifically, we introduce a two-stage bilingual multimodal representation alignment process to seamlessly integrate the text encoder with the generation model. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework, including assessments of image captioning and image generation. The implementation of our framework in Baidu Search Ads shows significant revenue increase, For example, beauty industry ads with generated image creatives achieve a 29% higher click-through rate (CTR). | Kang Zhao, Xinyu Zhao, Zhipeng Jin, Yi Yang, Wen Tao, Cong Han, Shuanglong Li, Lin Liu | Baidu Search Ads |

The major challenges include a heterogeneous user base, intricate marketing campaigns, constraints imposed by sparsity, and limited seed users, which lead to overfitting. In this context, we propose a novel solution named AudienceLinkNet, specifically designed to address the challenges associated with audience expansion in the context of Rakuten's diverse services and its clients. Our approach formulates the audience expansion problem as a graph problem and explores the combination of a Pre-trained Knowledge Graph Embedding Model and a Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). It emphasizes the structural retention properties of GCNs, enabling the model to overcome challenges related to cross-service data usage, sparsity and limited seed data. AudienceLinkNet simplifies the targeting process for small and large marketing campaigns and better utilizes demographics and behavioral attributes for targeting. Extensive experiments on our advertising platform, Rakuten AIris Target Prospecting, demonstrate the effectiveness of our audience expansion model.

The ability to efficiently and accurately understand, process, reason about, analyze, and generate tabular data is critical for achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) systems. However, despite their prevalence and importance, tables present unique challenges due to their structured nature and the diverse semantics embedded within them. Textual content, numerical values, visual formats, and even formulas in tables carry rich semantic information that is often underutilized due to the complexity of accurately interpreting and integrating. Fortunately, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new frontiers in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML), showing remarkable success in understanding and generating text, code, etc. Applying these advanced models to the domain of tabular data holds the promise of significant breakthroughs in how we process and leverage structured information. Therefore, this tutorial aims to provide a comprehensive study of the advances, challenges, and opportunities in leveraging cutting-edge LLMs for tabular data. By introducing methods of prompting or training cutting-edge LLMs for table interpreting, processing, reasoning, analytics, and generation, we aim to equip researchers and practitioners with the knowledge and tools needed to unlock the full potential of LLMs for tabular data in their domains. | Haoyu Dong, Zhiruo Wang | Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA USA; Microsoft AI, Beijing, Peoples R China |

Misinformation from LLMs can take various forms, from factual errors due to hallucination to intentionally deceptive content, and can have severe consequences in high-stakes domains.This tutorial covers comprehensive strategies to prevent and detect misinformation generated by LLMs. We first introduce the types of misinformation LLMs can produce and their root causes. We then explore two broad categories: Preventing misinformation generation: a) AI alignment training techniques to reduce LLMs' propensity for misinformation and refuse malicious instructions during model training. b) Training-free mitigation methods like prompt guardrails, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and decoding strategies to curb misinformation at inference time. Detecting misinformation after generation, including a) using LLMs themselves to detect misinformation through embedded knowledge or retrieval-enhanced judgments, and b) distinguishing LLM-generated text from human-written text through black-box approaches (e.g., classifiers, probability analysis) and white-box approaches (e.g., watermarking). We also discuss the challenges and limitations of detecting LLM-generated misinformation. | Aiwei Liu, Qiang Sheng, Xuming Hu | Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Comp Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China; Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol Guangzhou, Guangzhou, Peoples R China |

Utilizing the capabilities and responsibilities of LLMs for automated evaluation (LLM4Eval) has recently attracted considerable attention in multiple research communities. For instance, LLM4Eval models have been studied in the context of automated judgments, natural language generation, and retrieval augmented generation systems. We believe that the information retrieval community can significantly contribute to this growing research area by designing, implementing, analyzing, and evaluating various aspects of LLMs with applications to LLM4Eval tasks. The main goal of LLM4Eval workshop is to bring together researchers from industry and academia to discuss various aspects of LLMs for evaluation in information retrieval, including automated judgments, retrieval-augmented generation pipeline evaluation, altering human evaluation, robustness, and trustworthiness of LLMs for evaluation in addition to their impact on real-world applications. We also plan to run an automated judgment challenge prior to the workshop, where participants will be asked to generate labels for a given dataset while maximising correlation with human judgments. The format of the workshop is interactive, including roundtable and keynote sessions and tends to avoid the one-sided dialogue of a mini-conference. | Hossein A.

However, these models are far from infallible, raising significant ethical concerns, especially in decision-making applications, prompting calls for increased restraint [2]. The Augmented Intelligence paradigm is one proposed mitigation. Therein LLMs are tools used by human decision makers to improve performance without corresponding loss of accountability. However, this mitigation imposes requirements on models that are not the primary focus of existing evaluation approaches. In particular, current explanation evaluation approaches tend to prioritize premises and conclusions over reasoning quality. It is evident that logical soundness is a crucial aspect of system operation, as the output must be interpretable to the user. This work therefore proposes adopting a technique from programming language theory, wherein intermediate representations are employed to simplify the evaluation of code [3]. Rather than the model mapping directly from queries to solutions, code generation is used to produce an executable intermediate. An effect of this design is to shift the LLM from being a producer of solutions to the creator delegation plans. Production of a more structured output is expected to ease estimation of model reasoning quality via the comparison to golden solutions. Use of a bespoke representation, designed to take advantage of the particulars of automated code generation, aims to reduce the difficulty of this estimation. Use of a novel syntax is however, made challenging by the obvious absence of existing examples. It is impractical and undesirable for reasons of both cost and flexibility, to create the large numbers of examples which would be needed for conventional training. Early efforts have therefore been concentrated on two main areas: developing a syntax and interpreter, and addressing the challenge of data sparsity. A well-designed syntax is crucial, not only because updates will necessitate revising an increasing number of established solutions, but also due to its expected impact on the overall system utility. The expressiveness of the syntax is particularly significant in this context. Excessive constraint sacrifices generality, while too much leniency results in a proliferation of semantically equivalent solutions, complicating comparisons with the gold solutions. The generated intermediate representation is executed by an interpreter to produce the end solution. Other than a small number of control flow statements all other statements in the language are parameterized calls to external tools such as retrieval systems or math expression evaluators. External tool usage is the primary motivator behind avoiding training via extensive, manually curated, examples: the ability to easily add or remove tools is highly desirable. In case of an error, the interpreter output may include explanations of constructs and available tools, error messages, and task-specific metrics. Whereas on success, tool output is substituted into the appropriate section of the representation, such that a completely evaluated intermediate includes all information necessary to construct the end natural language explanation. Transformation into this natural language explanation can then be undertaken by another LLM. In terms of solutions for data sparsity, an approach similar to that used by LLM agents in environment exploration is suggested [1]. For each query, a ranking of model generations based on interpreter output in conjunction with a scoring function is produced. Pairwise selection of stronger and weaker responses are used thereafter in a modified form of iterative Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) [4]. Given the preliminary system we aim to test the system across a range of tasks with correspondence to the augmented intelligence paradigm such as multi-hop question answering. | Edward Richards | University of Glasgow |

Traditional means of developing a misinformation ground-truth dataset do not scale well because of the extensive manual effort required to annotate the data. It is crucial to anticipate and counteract potential adversarial fake information to mitigate detrimental effects and promote societal harmony. To this end, this PhD proposal spans three main research directions. The first concerns investigating ways of developing unsupervised models for fake news identification leveraging retrieval augmented generation (RAG) approaches. In our second thread of work, we explore ways of creating synthetic datasets to eventually train supervised or few-shot example-based models. Another direction of research work involves tracking the propagation of fake information through social networks to develop preventive measures against it. | Payel Santra | Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, Kolkata |

However, this ability can place confidentiality at risk when some inferences, although correct, could cause harm. We therefore flip the problem, seeking not to enable but to prevent specific inferences. This inference prevention task is motivated by what has been called the "mosaicing'' problem in declassification review for documents that in the past were withheld from public access for national security reasons~\citepozen2005mosaic. The goal of such a review is to reveal as much as can now be safely revealed but to also withhold things that could be used to infer facts that require continued protection. This problem is modeled using three primary components: (1) currently public information, (2) a set of secrets (information that is not public and requires continuing protection), and (3) a review set (other information now being reviewed for possible release). The inference prevention task is to determine what in the review set would substantially increase the inference rick for a secret. Our initial work investigated use of knowledge graphs for keeping secrets using Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) techniques. While declassification is typically text-based, we expect a structured analog to that problem can provide some useful insights. There also are applications where prevention of inference in a knowledge graph is the actual task, such as protecting against specific drug discovery inferences when augmenting the Hetionet knowledge graph. Our mosaicing problem is the inverse of KGC---rather than inferring a link, we need to prevent inference of a link. This challenge is distinct from anonymization for social media graphs because we can't alter most relationships, only those in the review set. Using the FB15K-237 knowledge graph, we analyzed three KGC models to identify the relation in a defined review set most critical to inference of a missing secret relation (thus "nominating" a relation for redaction). We evaluated the impact of redactions nominated by one model on inference by other models by ranking a secret with some selected confounds, finding that our simplest model (RuleN) produced the best nominations, despite being least effective of the three on the KGC task. Future work will use graphs more closely modeling declassification, and other KGC models. It will also explore areas in which differences between the traditional KGC task and the declassification problem may be exploited, most notably in the focus on specific secrets for declassification which may allow more focused training of models and improve scalability. Our ultimate goal is to perform redaction directly on text. We will explore two sets of techniques, one building on traditional Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) and a second using Large Language Models (LLM) which now constitute a major element of text-based inference methods. Both approaches to MHQA typically operate over limited document sets, so a retrieval step is needed for preselection. This retrieval step adds challenges because we must accommodate redundant information spread across the collection. We can evaluate nomination generalizability across model classes and the impact of alternative retrieval approaches using the same confound ranking technique, but ultimately we will also need absolute measures of effectiveness, not just relative comparisons, because we must balance the benefit of releasing information with the cost imposed by the risk of revealing a secret. While our work begins the exploration of the mosaicing problem, it has limitations. We must use analogs for our problem as working with classified information is challenging in access and distribution. While these are selected to serve as reasonable representations of our problem, they will exhibit differences from the actual classified datasets. Furthermore, the performance of the model classes used for inference in both the text and KG scenarios may not generalize against novel approaches developed in the future. The framework established in testing the current models would still be applicable but would have to be rerun with these new classes of models. | Nathaniel Rollings | University of Maryland, College Park |
