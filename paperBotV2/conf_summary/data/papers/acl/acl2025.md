To empower LLMs to self-repair their responses toward optimal quantity and improve their attentive listening skills, we propose Q-Tuning and Q-Traveling, which draw on heuristic path-finding to enable decoder-only LLMs to travel among multiple “Q-alternatives” (Quantity Alternatives) and search for the optimal quantity in coordination with a conversation goal. Automatic and human evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of Q-Tuning and Q-Traveling in constructing human-like, user-centered conversation agents. | Junlin Li, Bo Peng, YuYin Hsu |  |

This paper introduces the Multiverse Interactive Role-play Ability General Evaluation (MIRAGE), a comprehensive framework designed to assess LLMs’ proficiency in portraying advanced human behaviors through murder mystery games. MIRAGE features eight intricately crafted scripts encompassing diverse themes and styles, providing a rich simulation. To evaluate LLMs’ performance, MIRAGE employs four distinct methods: the Trust Inclination Index (TII) to measure dynamics of trust and suspicion, the Clue Investigation Capability (CIC) to measure LLMs’ capability of conducting information, the Interactivity Capability Index (ICI) to assess role-playing capabilities and the Script Compliance Index (SCI) to assess LLMs’ capability of understanding and following instructions.

Current intent classification systems encounter considerable challenges, primarily due to the vast number of possible intents and the significant semantic overlap among similar intent classes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to few-shot dialogue intent classification through in context learning, incorporating dynamic label refinement to address these challenges. Our method retrieves relevant examples for a test input from the training set and leverages a large language model to dynamically refine intent labels based on semantic understanding, ensuring that intents are clearly distinguishable from one another. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively resolves confusion between semantically similar intents, resulting in significantly enhanced performance across multiple datasets compared to baselines. We also show that our method... | Gyutae Park, Ingeol Baek, Byeongjeong Kim, Joongbo Shin, Hwanhee Lee |  |

For this purpose, KenLM, a lightweight n-gram-based language model that operates on CPUs, is widely used. However, the traditional method of training KenLM utilizes only high-quality data and, consequently, does not explicitly learn the linguistic patterns of low-quality data. To address this issue, we propose an ensemble approach that leverages two contrasting KenLMs: (i) Good KenLM, trained on high-quality data; and (ii) Bad KenLM, trained on low-quality data. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces noisy content while preserving high-quality content compared to the traditional KenLM training method. This indicates that our method can be a practical solution with minimal computational overhead for resource-constrained environments. | Yungi Kim, Hyunsoo Ha, Sukyung Lee, Jihoo Kim, Seonghoon Yang, Chanjun Park |  |

However, current screening tests are very time- and resource-consuming. We present an LSTM that aims to automatically classify dyslexia based on eye movements recorded during natural readingcombined with basic demographic information and linguistic features. The proposed model reaches an AUC of 0.93 and outperforms thestate-of-the-art model by 7 %. We report several ablation studies demonstrating that the fixation features matter the most for classification. | Anna Laurinavichyute, Anastasiya Lopukhina, David Robert Reich |  |
| 7 |  |  [Doc-React: Multi-page Heterogeneous Document Question-answering](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2025.acl-short.6) |  | 0 | Answering questions over multi-page, multimodal documents, including text and figures, is a critical challenge for applications that require answers to integrate information across multiple modalities and contextual dependencies. Existing methods, such as single-turn retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), struggle to retrieve fine-grained and contextually relevant information from large, heterogeneous documents, leading to suboptimal performance. Inspired by iterative frameworks like ReAct, which refine retrieval through feedback, we propose Doc-React, an adaptive iterative framework that balances information gain and uncertainty reduction at each step. Doc-React leverages InfoNCE-guided retrieval to approximate mutual information, enabling dynamic sub-query generation and refinement. A large language model (LLM) serves as both a judge and generator, providing structured feedback to iteratively improve retrieval. By combining mutual information optimization with entropy-aware... | Junda Wu, Yu Xia, Tong Yu, Xiang Chen, Sai Sree Harsha, Akash V. Maharaj, Ruiyi Zhang, Victor S. Bursztyn, Sungchul Kim, Ryan A.

| 8 |  |  [ConECT Dataset: Overcoming Data Scarcity in Context-Aware E-Commerce MT](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2025.acl-short.7) |  | 0 | Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has improved translation by using Transformer-based models, but it still struggles with word ambiguity and context. This problem is especially important in domain-specific applications, which often have problems with unclear sentences or poor data quality. Our research explores how adding information to models can improve translations in the context of e-commerce data. To this end we create ConECT– a new Czech-to-Polish e-commerce product translation dataset coupled with images and product metadata consisting of 11,400 sentence pairs. We then investigate and compare different methods that are applicable to context-aware translation. We test a vision-language model (VLM), finding that visual context aids translation quality. Additionally, we explore the incorporation of contextual information into text-to-text models, such as the product’s category path or image descriptions. The results of our study demonstrate that the incorporation of contextual... | Mikolaj Pokrywka, Wojciech Kusa, Mieszko Rutkowski, Mikolaj Koszowski |  |
| 9 |  |  [A Measure of the System Dependence of Automated Metrics](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2025.acl-short.8) |  | 0 | Automated metrics for Machine Translation have made significant progress, with the goal of replacing expensive and time-consuming human evaluations. These metrics are typically assessed by their correlation with human judgments, which captures the monotonic relationship between human and metric scores. However, we argue that it is equally important to ensure that metrics treat all systems fairly and consistently. In this paper, we introduce a method to evaluate this aspect. | Pius von Däniken, Jan Milan Deriu, Mark Cieliebak |  |
| 10 |  |  [Call for Rigor in Reporting Quality of Instruction Tuning Data](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2025.acl-short.9) |  | 0 | Instruction tuning is crucial for adapting large language models (LLMs) to align with user intentions. Numerous studies emphasize the significance of the quality of instruction tuning (IT) data, revealing a strong correlation between IT data quality and the alignment performance of LLMs. In these studies, the quality of IT data is typically assessed by evaluating the performance of LLMs trained with that data. However, we identified a prevalent issue in such practice: hyperparameters for training models are often selected arbitrarily without adequate justification. We observed significant variations in hyperparameters applied across different studies, even when training the same model with the same data. In this study, we demonstrate the potential problems arising from this practice and emphasize the need for careful consideration in verifying data quality. Through our experiments on the quality of LIMA data and a selected set of 1,000 Alpaca data points, we demonstrate that arbitrary... | Hyeonseok Moon, Jaehyung Seo, Heuiseok Lim |  |

Unlike language or sign language, such nonverbal communication lacks formal rules, requiring complex reasoning based on commonsense understanding.Enabling current Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) to accurately interpret body language is a crucial challenge, as human unconscious actions can easily cause the model to misinterpret their intent.To address this, we propose a dataset, BQA, a body language question answering dataset, to validate whether the model can correctly interpret emotions from short clips of body language comprising 26 emotion labels of videos of body language.We evaluated various VideoLLMs on the BQA with and without Multimodal Chain of Thought (CoT) and revealed that understanding body language is challenging, and our analyses of the wrong answers by VideoLLMs show that certain VideoLLMs made largely biased answers depending on the age... | Shintaro Ozaki, Kazuki Hayashi, Miyu Oba, Yusuke Sakai, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Taro Watanabe |  |
| 12 |  |  [Grounded, or a Good Guesser? A Per-Question Balanced Dataset to Separate Blind from Grounded Models for Embodied Question Answering](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2025.acl-short.11) |  | 0 | Embodied question answering (EQA) means using \*perception of\* and \*action in\* an environment to answer natural language questions about that environment. However, previous work has demonstrated that blind language models (which do not incorporate perception, but predict an answer based solely on the question text) are a strong baseline for existing benchmarks, even compared against state-of-the-art vision and language models. To determine whether a model is grounding its answers in its specific environment, rather than relying on a language model’s expectations about the world generally, we propose PQB-EQA, a \*per-question balanced\* EQA dataset. In this new benchmark, every question appears twice, paired with two different environments that yield two different answers. That is, the answer distribution is balanced for each question, not just across the whole dataset. We show both theoretically and empirically that grounding in the environment is necessary to perform better than... | Miles Shelton, Nate Wingerd, Kritim K.

| 13 |  |  [Learning Sparsity for Effective and Efficient Music Performance Question Answering](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2025.acl-short.12) |  | 0 | Music performances, characterized by dense and continuous audio as well as seamless audio-visual integration, present unique challenges for multimodal scene understanding and reasoning. Recent Music Performance Audio-Visual Question Answering (Music AVQA) datasets have been proposed to reflect these challenges, highlighting the continued need for more effective integration of audio-visual representations in complex question answering. However, existing Music AVQA methods often rely on dense and unoptimized representations, leading to inefficiencies in the isolation of key information, the reduction of redundancy, and the prioritization of critical samples. To address these challenges, we introduce Sparsify, a sparse learning framework specifically designed for Music AVQA. It integrates three sparsification strategies into an end-to-end pipeline and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Music AVQA datasets. In addition, it reduces training time by 28.32% compared to its fully... | Xingjian Diao, Tianzhen Yang, Chunhui Zhang, Weiyi Wu, Ming Cheng, Jiang Gui |  |
| 14 |  |  [Cross-Lingual Transfer of Cultural Knowledge: An Asymmetric Phenomenon](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2025.acl-short.13) |  | 0 | Despite substantial research efforts evaluating how well large language models (LLMs) handle global cultural diversity, the mechanisms behind their cultural knowledge acquisition, particularly in multilingual settings, remain unclear. We study this question by investigating how cultural knowledge transfers across languages during the language adaptation of LLMs, a process where an LLM is continually pre-trained to learn another language. We introduce an interpretable framework to study this transfer, ensuring training data transparency and controlling transfer effects. Through a study of four non-Anglophonic cultures, we observe bidirectional cultural transfer between English and other high-resource languages, while low-resource languages primarily transfer knowledge to English with limited reverse flow. To explain this asymmetric phenomenon, we propose a frequency-based hypothesis: cultural knowledge appearing more frequently in the pretraining data transfers more easily, which is... | Chen Zhang, Zhiyuan Liao, Yansong Feng |  |
| 15 |  |  [Leveraging Human Production-Interpretation Asymmetries to Test LLM Cognitive Plausibility](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2025.acl-short.14) |  | 0 | Whether large language models (LLMs) process language similarly to humans has been the subject of much theoretical and practical debate. We examine this question through the lens of the production-interpretation distinction found in human sentence processing and evaluate the extent to which instruction-tuned LLMs replicate this distinction. Using an empirically documented asymmetry between pronoun production and interpretation in humans for implicit causality verbs as a testbed, we find that some LLMs do quantitatively and qualitatively reflect human-like asymmetries between production and interpretation. We demonstrate that whether this behavior holds depends upon both model size-with larger models more likely to reflect human-like patterns and the choice of meta-linguistic prompts used to elicit the behavior. Our codes and results are available here. | SuetYing Lam, Qingcheng Zeng, Jingyi Wu, Rob Voigt |  |
| 16 |  |  [Improving the Calibration of Confidence Scores in Text Generation Using the Output Distribution's Characteristics](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2025.acl-short.15) |  | 0 | Well-calibrated model confidence scores can improve the usefulness of text generation models. For example, users can be prompted to review predictions with low confidence scores, to prevent models from returning bad or potentially dangerous predictions. However, confidence metrics are not always well calibrated in text generation. One reason is that in generation, there can be many valid answers, which previous methods do not always account for. Hence, a confident model could assign probability to many sequences because they are all valid, and not because it is unsure about how to perform the task. We propose task-agnostic confidence metrics suited to generation, which rely solely on model probabilities without the need for further fine-tuning or heuristics. Using these, we are able to improve the calibration of BART and Flan-T5 on summarization, translation, and question answering datasets. | Lorenzo Jaime Yu Flores, Ori Ernst, Jackie CK Cheung |  |
| 17 |  |  [KnowShiftQA: How Robust are RAG Systems when Textbook Knowledge Shifts in K-12 Education?](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2025.acl-short.16) |  | 0 | Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems show remarkable potential as question answering tools in the K-12 Education domain, where knowledge is typically queried within the restricted scope of authoritative textbooks. However, discrepancies between these textbooks and the parametric knowledge inherent in Large Language Models (LLMs) can undermine the effectiveness of RAG systems. To systematically investigate RAG system robustness against such knowledge discrepancies, we introduce KnowShiftQA. This novel question answering dataset simulates these discrepancies by applying deliberate hypothetical knowledge updates to both answers and source documents, reflecting how textbook knowledge can shift. KnowShiftQA comprises 3,005 questions across five subjects, designed with a comprehensive question typology focusing on context utilization and knowledge integration. Our extensive experiments on retrieval and question answering performance reveal that most RAG systems suffer a substantial... | Tianshi Zheng, Weihan Li, Jiaxin Bai, Weiqi Wang, Yangqiu Song |  |
| 18 |  |  [Improving Parallel Sentence Mining for Low-Resource and Endangered Languages](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2025.acl-short.17) |  | 0 | While parallel sentence mining has been extensively covered for fairly well-resourced languages, pairs involving low-resource languages have received comparatively little attention.To address this gap, we present Belopsem, a benchmark of new datasets for parallel sentence mining on three language pairs where the source side is low-resource and endangered: Occitan-Spanish, Upper Sorbian-German, and Chuvash-Russian. These combinations also reflect varying linguistic similarity within each pair. We compare three language models in an established parallel sentence mining pipeline and apply two types of improvements to one of them, Glot500. We observe better mining quality overall by both applying alignment post-processing with an unsupervised aligner and using a cluster-based isotropy enhancement technique. These findings are crucial for optimising parallel data extraction for low-resource languages in a realistic way. | Shu Okabe, Katharina Hämmerl, Alexander Fraser |  |
| 19 |  |  [Revisiting Epistemic Markers in Confidence Estimation: Can Markers Accurately Reflect Large Language Models' Uncertainty?](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2025.acl-short.18) |  | 0 | As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes domains, accurately assessing their confidence is crucial. Humans typically express confidence through epistemic markers (e.g., “fairly confident”) instead of numerical values. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs consistently use these markers to reflect their intrinsic confidence due to the difficulty of quantifying uncertainty associated with various markers. To address this gap, we first define \*\*\*marker confidence\*\*\* as the observed accuracy when a model employs an epistemic marker. We evaluate its stability across multiple question-answering datasets in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings for open-source and proprietary LLMs. Our results show that while markers generalize well within the same distribution, their confidence is inconsistent in out-of-distribution scenarios. These findings raise significant concerns about the reliability of epistemic markers for confidence estimation,... | Jiayu Liu, Qing Zong, Weiqi Wang, Yangqiu Song |  |
| 20 |  |  [Limited-Resource Adapters Are Regularizers, Not Linguists](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2025.acl-short.19) |  | 0 | Cross-lingual transfer from related high-resource languages is a well-established strategy to enhance low-resource language technologies. Prior work has shown that adapters show promise for, e.g., improving low-resource machine translation (MT). In this work, we investigate an adapter souping method combined with cross-attention fine-tuning of a pre-trained MT model to leverage language transfer for three low-resource Creole languages, which exhibit relatedness to different language groups across distinct linguistic dimensions. Our approach improves performance substantially over baselines. However, we find that linguistic relatedness—or even a lack thereof—does not covary meaningfully with adapter performance. Surprisingly, our cross-attention fine-tuning approach appears equally effective with randomly initialized adapters, implying that the benefit of adapters in this setting lies in parameter regularization, and not in meaningful information transfer. We provide analysis... | Marcell Fekete, Nathaniel Romney Robinson, Ernests Lavrinovics, E. Djeride JeanBaptiste, Raj Dabre, Johannes Bjerva, Heather C. Lent |  |

A Large Scale Empirical Study across 20 NLP Evaluation Tasks](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2025.acl-short.20) |  | 0 | There is an increasing trend towards evaluating NLP models with LLMs instead of human judgments, raising questions about the validity of these evaluations, as well as their reproducibility in the case of proprietary models. We provide JUDGE-BENCH, an extensible collection of 20 NLP datasets with human annotations covering a broad range of evaluated properties and types of data, and comprehensively evaluate 11 current LLMs, covering both open-weight and proprietary models, for their ability to replicate the annotations. Our evaluations show substantial variance across models and datasets. Models are reliable evaluators on some tasks, but overall display substantial variability depending on the property being evaluated, the expertise level of the human judges, and whether the language is human or model-generated. We conclude that LLMs should be carefully validated against human judgments before being used as evaluators. | Anna Bavaresco, Raffaella Bernardi, Leonardo Bertolazzi, Desmond Elliott, Raquel Fernández, Albert Gatt, Esam Ghaleb, Mario Giulianelli, Michael Hanna, Alexander Koller, André F.

| 22 |  |  [FocalPO: Enhancing Preference Optimizing by Focusing on Correct Preference Rankings](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2025.acl-short.21) |  | 0 | Efficient preference optimization algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have become a popular approach in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. These algorithms implicitly treat the LLM as a reward model, and focus on training it to correct misranked preference pairs. However, recent work (CITATION) empirically finds that DPO training rarely improves these misranked preference pairs, despite its gradient emphasizing on these cases. We introduce FocalPO, a DPO variant that instead down-weighs misranked preference pairs and prioritizes enhancing the model’s understanding of pairs that it can already rank correctly. Inspired by Focal Loss used in vision tasks, FocalPO achieves this by adding a modulating factor to dynamically scale DPO loss. Our experiment demonstrates that FocalPO surpasses DPO and its variants on popular benchmarks like Alpaca Eval 2.0 and Arena-Hard using Mistral-Base-7B and Llama-3-Instruct-8B, with the introduced... | Tong Liu, Xiao Yu, Wenxuan Zhou, Jindong Gu, Volker Tresp |  |
| 23 |  |  [Combining Domain and Alignment Vectors Provides Better Knowledge-Safety Trade-offs in LLMs](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2025.acl-short.22) |  | 0 | There is a growing interest in training domain-expert LLMs that excel in specific technical fields compared to their general-purpose instruction-tuned counterparts. However, these expert models are not either explicitly trained to be safe, or experience a loss in their safety abilities in the process, making them capable of generating harmful content. We observe that simple interpolation between the domain and alignment delta parameters leads to safer domain-specific models that preserve their utility. Building on this, we introduce MergeAlign, a simple, efficient, and effective model merging-based alignment method. We apply MergeAlign on Llama3 models that are experts in medicine and finance, obtaining substantial safety alignment improvements with minimal to no degradation on domain-specific benchmarks. We study the impact of model merging through model similarity metrics and contributions of individual models being merged, as well as the applicability of MergeAlign on more general... | Megh Thakkar, Quentin Fournier, Matthew Riemer, PinYu Chen, Amal Zouaq, Payel Das, Sarath Chandar |  |

Uniform Meaning Representation (UMR), a semantic representation designed to capture the meaning of texts in many languages, is well-positioned to be leveraged in the development of low-resource language technologies. In this work, we explore the downstream utility of UMR for low-resource languages by incorporating it into GPT-4 prompts. Specifically, we examine the ability of GPT-4 to perform translation from three indigenous languages (Navajo, Arápaho, and Kukama), with and without demonstrations, as well as with and without UMR annotations. Ultimately, we find that in the majority of our test cases, integrating UMR into the prompt results in a statistically significant increase in performance, which is a promising indication of future applications of the UMR formalism. | Shira Wein |  |
| 25 |  |  [Subword models struggle with word learning, but surprisal hides it](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2025.acl-short.24) |  | 0 | We study word learning in subword and character language models with the psycholinguistic lexical decision task. While subword LMs struggle to discern words and non-words with high accuracy, character LMs solve this task easily and consistently. Only when supplied with further contexts do subword LMs perform similarly to character models. Additionally, when looking at word-level and syntactic learning trajectories, we find that both processes are separable in character LMs. Word learning happens before syntactic learning, whereas both occur simultaneously in subword LMs. This raises questions about the adequacy of subword LMs for modeling language acquisition and positions character LMs as a viable alternative to study processes below the syntactic level. | Bastian Bunzeck, Sina Zarrieß |  |
| 26 |  |  [LLM as Entity Disambiguator for Biomedical Entity-Linking](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2025.acl-short.25) |  | 0 | Entity linking involves normalizing a mention in medical text to a unique identifier in a knowledge base, such as UMLS or MeSH. Most entity linkers follow a two-stage process: first, a candidate generation step selects high-quality candidates, and then a named entity disambiguation phase determines the best candidate for final linking. This study demonstrates that leveraging a large language model (LLM) as an entity disambiguator significantly enhances entity linking models’ accuracy and recall. Specifically, the LLM disambiguator achieves remarkable improvements when applied to alias-matching entity linking methods. Without any fine-tuning, our approach establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA), surpassing previous methods on multiple prevalent biomedical datasets by up to 16 points in accuracy. We released our code on GitHub at https://github.com/ChristopheYe/llm_disambiguator | Christophe Ye, Cassie S. Mitchell |  |
| 27 |  |  [Towards Geo-Culturally Grounded LLM Generations](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2025.acl-short.26) |  | 0 | Generative large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated gaps in diverse cultural awareness across the globe. We investigate the effect of retrieval augmented generation and search-grounding techniques on LLMs’ ability to display familiarity with various national cultures. Specifically, we compare the performance of standard LLMs, LLMs augmented with retrievals from a bespoke knowledge base (i.e., KB grounding), and LLMs augmented with retrievals from a web search (i.e., search grounding) on multiple cultural awareness benchmarks. We find that search grounding significantly improves the LLM performance on multiple-choice benchmarks that test propositional knowledge (e.g., cultural norms, artifacts, and institutions), while KB grounding’s effectiveness is limited by inadequate knowledge base coverage and a suboptimal retriever. However, search grounding also increases the risk of stereotypical judgments by language models and fails to improve evaluators’ judgments of cultural... | Piyawat Lertvittayakumjorn, David Kinney, Vinodkumar Prabhakaran, Donald Martin Jr., Sunipa Dev |  |
| 28 |  |  [MUSTS: MUltilingual Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2025.acl-short.27) |  | 0 | Predicting semantic textual similarity (STS) is a complex and ongoing challenge in natural language processing (NLP). Over the years, researchers have developed a variety of supervised and unsupervised approaches to calculate STS automatically. Additionally, various benchmarks, which include STS datasets, have been established to consistently evaluate and compare these STS methods. However, they largely focus on high-resource languages, mixed with datasets annotated focusing on relatedness instead of similarity and containing automatically translated instances. Therefore, no dedicated benchmark for multilingual STS exists. To solve this gap, we introduce the Multilingual Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark (MUSTS), which spans 13 languages, including low-resource languages. By evaluating more than 25 models on MUSTS, we establish the most comprehensive benchmark of multilingual STS methods. Our findings confirm that STS remains a challenging task, particularly for low-resource... | Tharindu Ranasinghe, Hansi Hettiarachchi, Constantin Orasan, Ruslan Mitkov |  |
| 29 |  |  [Can Large Language Models Accurately Generate Answer Keys for Health-related Questions?](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2025.acl-short.28) |  | 0 | The evaluation of text generated by LLMs remains a challenge for question answering, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), summarization, and many other natural language processing tasks. Evaluating the factuality of LLM generated responses is particularly important in medical question answering, where the stakes are high. One method of evaluating the factuality of text is through the use of information nuggets (answer keys). Nuggets are text representing atomic facts that may be used by an assessor to make a binary decision as to whether the fact represented by said nugget is contained in an answer. Although manual nugget extraction is expensive and time-consuming, recent RAG shared task evaluations have explored automating the nuggetization of text with LLMs. In this work, we explore several approaches to nugget generation for medical question answering and evaluate their alignment with expert human nugget generation. We find providing an example and extracting nuggets from an... | Davis Bartels, Deepak Gupta, Dina DemnerFushman |  |
| 30 |  |  [Literary Evidence Retrieval via Long-Context Language Models](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2025.acl-short.29) |  | 0 | How well do modern long-context language models understand literary fiction? We explore this question via the task of literary evidence retrieval, repurposing the RELiC dataset of Thai et al. (2022) to construct a benchmark where the entire text of a primary source (e.g., The Great Gatsby) is provided to an LLM alongside literary criticism with a missing quotation from that work. This setting, in which the model must generate the missing quotation, mirrors the human process of literary analysis by requiring models to perform both global narrative reasoning and close textual examination. We curate a high-quality subset of 292 examples through extensive filtering and human verification. Our experiments show that recent reasoning models, such as Gemini 2.5 Pro can exceed human expert performance (62.5% vs. 50% accuracy). In contrast, the best open-weight model achieves only 29.1% accuracy, highlighting a wide gap in interpretive reasoning between open and closed-weight models. Despite... | Katherine Thai, Mohit Iyyer |  |
| 31 |  |  [A Little Human Data Goes A Long Way](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2025.acl-short.30) |  | 0 | Faced with an expensive human annotation process, creators of NLP systems increasingly turn to synthetic data generation. While this method shows promise, the extent to which synthetic data can replace human annotation is poorly understood. We investigate the use of synthetic data in Fact Verification (FV) and Evidence-based Question Answering (QA) by incrementally replacing human-generated data with synthetic points on eight diverse datasets. Strikingly, replacing up to 90% of the training data only marginally decreases performance, but replacing the final 10% leads to severe declines. We find that models trained on purely synthetic data can be improved by including as few as 125 human-generated data points. We show that matching the performance gain of a little human data requires an order of magnitude more synthetic data, and then estimate price ratios at which human annotation would be a more cost-effective solution. Our results suggest that even when human annotation at scale is... | Dhananjay Ashok, Jonathan May |  |
| 32 |  |  [Seeking Rational Demonstrations for Large Language Models: A Domain Generalization Approach to Unsupervised Cross-Domain Keyphrase Generation](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2025.acl-short.31) |  | 0 | Unsupervised cross-domain keyphrase generation is crucial in real-world natural language processing scenarios. However, the accuracy of up-to-date approaches is limited by the distribution shift between source and target domain, which stems from the cross-domain field. Large language models (LLMs) offer potential for the cross-domain keyphrase generation tasks due to their strong generalization abilities, facilitated by providing demonstrations relevant to the target task. Nevertheless, it is often difficult to obtain labeled samples from the target domain. To address this challenge, this paper aims to seek rational demonstrations from the source domain, thereby improving the LLMs’ ability in the unsupervised cross-domain keyphrase generation setting. Specifically, we design a novel domain-aware retrieval model on the source domain. Guided by insights from domain generalization theory, we introduce two generalization terms, one for cross-domain relevance and another for each domain... | Guangzhen Zhao, Yu Yao, Dechang Kong, Zhenjiang Dong |  |

Retrieval-augmented models mitigate this by providing relevant external documents to the model but struggle when retrieval is based only on past context, which may not align with the model’s intended future content. We introduce LexKeyPlan, a novel framework that integrates anticipatory planning into generation. Instead of relying solely on context for retrieval, LexKeyPlan generates keyphrases outlining future content serving as forward-looking plan, guiding retrieval for more accurate text generation. This work incorporates planning into legal text generation, demonstrating how keyphrases—representing legal concepts—enhance factual accuracy. By structuring retrieval around legal concepts, LexKeyPlan better aligns with legal reasoning, making it particularly suited for legal applications. Using the ECHR corpus as case study, we show that LexKeyPlan... | T. Y. S. S. Santosh, Elvin Quero Hernandez |  |

However, LLM-based agents face substantial challenges when deployed in novel environments or required to navigate unconventional action spaces. To empower agents to autonomously explore environments, optimize workflows, and enhance their understanding of actions, we propose SynWorld, a framework that allows agents to synthesize possible scenarios with multi-step action invocation within the action space and perform Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) exploration to effectively refine their action knowledge in the current environment. Our experiments demonstrate that SynWorld is an effective and general approach to learning action knowledge in new environments. | Runnan Fang, Xiaobin Wang, Yuan Liang, Shuofei Qiao, Jialong Wu, Zekun Xi, Ningyu Zhang, Yong Jiang, Pengjun Xie, Fei Huang, Huajun Chen |  |

While efficient and scalable, this approach often fails to handle complex queries involving logical constructs such as negations, conjunctions, and disjunctions. In this paper, we propose a novel inference-time logical reasoning framework that explicitly incorporates logical reasoning into the retrieval process. Our method extracts logical reasoning structures from natural language queries and then composes the individual cosine similarity matching scores to formulate the final document scores. This approach enables the retrieval process to handle complex logical reasoning without compromising computational efficiency. Our results on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms traditional retrieval methods across different models and datasets, significantly... | Felix Faltings, Wei Wei, Yujia Bao |  |

Arguments contain subtexts, some of which are beneficial to the perception of semantic relations. However, subtexts are connotative. The neural IDRR model fails to be aware of them without being given pertinent prompts. In this paper, we leverage LLaMA to generate subtexts for argument pairs, and verify the effectiveness of subtext-based IDRR. We construct an IDRR baseline using the decoder-only backbone LLaMA, and enhance it with subtext-aware relation reasoning. A confidence-diagnosed dual-channel network is used for collaboration between in-subtext and out-of-subtext IDRR. We experiment on PDTB-2.0 and PDTB-3.0 for both the main-level and secondary-level relation taxonomies. The test results show that our approach yields substantial improvements compared to the baseline, and achieves higher F1-scores on both benchmarks than the previous... | Zhipang Wang, Yu Hong, Weihao Sun, Guodong Zhou |  |

However, the application of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods to SSMs remains largely unexplored. In particular, prompt-based methods like Prompt Tuning and Prefix-Tuning, which are widely used in Transformers, do not perform well on SSMs. To address this, we propose \*\*state-based methods\*\* as a superior alternative to prompt-based methods. This new family of methods naturally stems from the architectural characteristics of SSMs. State-based methods adjust state-related features directly instead of depending on external prompts. Furthermore, we introduce a novel state-based PEFT method: \*\*State-offset Tuning\*\*. At every timestep, our method directly affects the state at the current step, leading to more effective adaptation. Through extensive experiments across diverse datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code is... | Wonjun Kang, Kevin Galim, Yuchen Zeng, Minjae Lee, Hyung Il Koo, Nam Ik Cho |  |

By analyzing citations from research articles and external sources such as patents, media, and policy documents, we examine how different NLP topics are consumed both within the academic community and by the broader public. Our findings reveal that language modeling has the widest internal and external influence, while linguistic foundations have lower impacts. We also observe that internal and external impacts generally align, but topics like ethics, bias, and fairness show significant attention in policy documents with much fewer academic citations. Additionally, external domains exhibit distinct preferences, with patents focusing on practical NLP applications and media and policy documents engaging more with the societal implications of NLP models. | Yu Zhang |  |

However, this practice introduces data heterogeneity and complicates the model with additional modules, leading to increased expenses for training a high-performing model. To address this challenge, we propose a dual-stage curriculum learning (DCL) framework specifically designed for sequence labeling tasks. The DCL framework enhances training by gradually introducing data instances from easy to hard. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic metric for evaluating the difficulty levels of sequence labeling tasks. Experiments on several sequence labeling datasets show that our model enhances performance and accelerates training, mitigating the slow training issue of complex models. | Xuemei Tang, Jun Wang, Qi Su, ChuRen Huang, Jinghang Gu |  |

Existing acceleration methods often lead to noticeable performance degradation, while Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models require extensive computational resources. In this paper, we propose L0-MoE, a lightweight MoE approach using L0-regularization to accelerate dense LLMs nearly without performance loss. Our method introduces a cluster confusion matrix for domain-aware dataset curation and applies dynamic batching for efficient training. Experiments show that L0-MoE achieves up to 2.5x speedup over dense models while maintaining competitive performance, outperforming existing LLM acceleration baselines. | Zhenyu Zhang, JiuDong Yang, Zhaowen Tao, Meng Chen |  |

Investigating Indexical, Iconic, and Symbolic Gesture Comprehension](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2025.acl-short.40) |  | 0 | Understanding hand gestures is essential for human communication, yet it remains unclear how well multimodal large language models (MLLMs) comprehend them. In this paper, we examine MLLMs’ ability to interpret indexical gestures, which require external referential grounding, in comparison to iconic gestures, which depict imagery, and symbolic gestures, which are conventionally defined. We hypothesize that MLLMs, lacking real-world referential understanding, will struggle significantly with indexical gestures. To test this, we manually annotated five gesture type labels to 925 gesture instances from the Miraikan SC Corpus and analyzed gesture descriptions generated by state-of-the-art MLLMs, including GPT-4o. Our findings reveal a consistent weakness across models in interpreting indexical gestures, suggesting that MLLMs rely heavily on linguistic priors or commonsense knowledge rather than grounding their interpretations in visual or contextual cues. | Noriki Nishida, Koji Inoue, Hideki Nakayama, Mayumi Bono, Katsuya Takanashi |  |

Integrating Fast Intuition and Deliberate Thinking for Enhancing Visual Question Answering](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2025.acl-short.41) |  | 0 | Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still struggle with complex reasoning tasks in Visual Question Answering (VQA). While current methods have advanced by incorporating visual prompts, our study uncovers critical limitations: these approaches indiscriminately annotate all detected objects for every visual question, generating excessive visual markers that degrade task performance. This issue stems primarily from a lack of focus on key visual elements, raising two important questions: Are all objects equally important, and do all questions require visual prompts? Motivated by Dual Process Theory, which distinguishes between instinctive and deliberate cognitive modes in human reasoning, we propose FOCUS, a plug-and-play approach that dynamically adapts to the complexity of questions, combining fast intuitive judgments with deliberate analytical reasoning to enhance the vision-language reasoning capability of the MLLM. For straightforward questions, FOCUS supports efficient... | Songtao Jiang, Chenyi Zhou, Yan Zhang, Yeying Jin, Zuozhu Liu |  |

Policy changes by Twitter/X and, more recently, Meta, signal a shift away from partnerships with fact-checking organisations and towards an increased reliance on crowdsourced community notes. However, the extent and nature of dependencies between fact-checking and \*helpful\* community notes remain unclear. To address these questions, we use language models to annotate a large corpus of Twitter/X community notes with attributes such as topic, cited sources, and whether they refute claims tied to broader misinformation narratives. Our analysis reveals that community notes cite fact-checking sources up to five times more than previously reported. Fact-checking is especially crucial for notes on posts linked to broader narratives, which are \*twice\* as likely to reference fact-checking sources compared... | Nadav Borenstein, Greta Warren, Desmond Elliott, Isabelle Augenstein |  |

While most existing works focus on translating a single SL into a single spoken language (one-to-one SLT), leveraging multilingual resources could mitigate low-resource issues and enhance accessibility. However, multilingual SLT (MLSLT) remains unexplored due to language conflicts and alignment difficulties across SLs and spoken languages. To address these challenges, we propose a multilingual gloss-free model with dual CTC objectives for token-level SL identification and spoken text generation. Our model supports 10 SLs and handles one-to-one, many-to-one, and many-to-many SLT tasks, achieving competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on three widely adopted benchmarks: multilingual SP-10, PHOENIX14T, and CSL-Daily. | Sihan Tan, Taro Miyazaki, Kazuhiro Nakadai |  |

This paper introduces Numerical Token Integrity Loss(NTIL) to address this gap. NTIL operates at two levels: (1) token-level, where it extends the Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD) to preserve ordinal relationships between numerical values, and (2) sequence-level, where it penalizes the overall discrepancy between the predicted and actual sequences. This dual approach improves numerical prediction and integrates effectively with LLMs/MLLMs. Extensive experiments show significant performance improvements with NTIL. | Xiang Fei, Jinghui Lu, Qi Sun, Hao Feng, Yanjie Wang, Wei Shi, AnLan Wang, Jingqun Tang, Can Huang |  |

Recently, AI-based tutoring systems have emerged to assist teachers; however, these systems require high-quality and large-scale teacher feedback data, which is both time-consuming and costly to generate manually. In this study, we propose FEAT, a cost-effective framework for generating teacher feedback, and have constructed three complementary datasets: (1) DIRECT-Manual (DM), where both humans and large language models (LLMs) collaboratively generate high-quality teacher feedback, albeit at a higher cost; (2) DIRECT-Generated (DG), an LLM-only generated, cost-effective dataset with lower quality;, and (3) DIRECT-Augmented (DA), primarily based on DG with a small portion of DM added to enhance quality while maintaining cost-efficiency. Experimental results showed that incorporating a small portion of DM (5–10%) into DG leads to superior performance compared to using 100% DM alone. | Hyein Seo, Taewook Hwang, Yohan Lee, Sangkeun Jung |  |

Although temporal reasoning has raised increasing research attention, comprehensive testing of Allen’s interval relations (e.g., before, after, during) —a fundamental framework for temporal relationships— remains underexplored. To fill this gap, we present ChronoSense, a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs’ temporal understanding. It includes 16 tasks, identifying the Allen relation between two temporal events and temporal arithmetic. We assess the performance of seven recent LLMs. The results indicate that models handle Allen relations, even symmetrical ones, quite differently. Moreover, the findings suggest that the models may rely on memorization to answer time-related questions. Overall, the models’ low performance highlights the need for improved temporal understanding in LLMs. Our dataset and the source code are available at https://github.com/duyguislakoglu/chronosense. | Duygu Sezen Islakoglu, JanChristoph Kalo |  |

Using a cooperative language game in which players aim to converge on a shared word, we investigate how people adapt their communication strategies when paired with either an LLM or another human. Our study demonstrates that LLMs exert a measurable influence on human communication strategies and that humans notice and adapt to these differences irrespective of whether they are aware they are interacting with an LLM. These findings highlight the reciprocal influence of human–AI dialogue and raise important questions about the long-term implications of embedding LLMs in everyday communication. | Tanguy Cazalets, Ruben Janssens, Tony Belpaeme, Joni Dambre |  |

Multi-view prompting method improves the performance of ABSA by predicting tuples with various templates and then assembling the results. However, this method suffers from inefficiencies and out-of-distribution errors. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Order Template (DOT) method for ABSA, which dynamically creates an order template that contains only the necessary views for each instance. Ensuring the diverse and relevant view generation, our proposed method improves F1 scores on ASQP and ACOS datasets while significantly reducing inference time. | Yonghyun Jun, Hwanhee Lee |  |

While ASR performance has seen improvements in low-resource settings, obstacles remain when training models on data collected by documentary linguists. One notable challenge lies in the way that this data is curated. ASR datasets built from spontaneous speech are typically recorded in consistent settings and transcribed by native speakers following a set of well designed guidelines. In contrast, field linguists collect data in whatever format it is delivered by their language consultants and transcribe it as best they can given their language skills and the quality of the recording. This approach to data curation, while valuable for linguistic research, does not always align with the standards required for training robust ASR models. In this paper, we explore methods for identifying speech transcriptions in fieldwork data that may be unsuitable... | Éric Le Ferrand, Bo Jiang, Joshua K. Hartshorne, Emily Prud'hommeaux |  |

Test-Time Scaling Improves Selective Question Answering](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2025.acl-short.50) |  | 0 | Scaling the test-time compute of large language models has demonstrated impressive performance on reasoning benchmarks. However, existing evaluations of test-time scaling make the strong assumption that a reasoning system should always give an answer to any question provided. This overlooks concerns about whether a model is confident in its answer, and whether it is appropriate to always provide a response. To address these concerns, we extract confidence scores during reasoning for thresholding model responses. We find that increasing compute budget at inference time not only helps models answer more questions correctly, but also increases confidence in correct responses. We then extend the current paradigm of zero-risk responses during evaluation by considering settings with non-zero levels of response risk, and suggest a recipe for reporting evaluations under these settings. | William Jurayj, Jeffrey Cheng, Benjamin Van Durme |  |

However, most of the work in this space relies on human efforts, as the development of methods for automatic individual identification is hindered by the lack of data. In this paper, we explore cross-species pre-training to address the task of individual classification in white-faced capuchin monkeys. Using acoustic embeddings from birds and humans, we find that they can be effectively used to identify the calls from individual monkeys. Moreover, we find that joint multi-species representations can lead to further improvements over the use of one representation at a time. Our work demonstrates the potential of cross-species data transfer and multi-species representations, as strategies to address tasks on species with very limited data. | Álvaro VegaHidalgo, Artem Abzaliev, Thore Bergman, Rada Mihalcea |  |

However, due to manipulation’s nuanced and context-specific nature, identifying manipulative language in complex, multi-turn, and multi-person conversations remains a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs). To address this gap, we introduce the MultiManip dataset, comprising 220 multi-turn, multi-person dialogues balanced between manipulative and non-manipulative interactions, all drawn from reality shows that mimic real-world scenarios. For manipulative interactions, it includes 11 distinct manipulations depicting real-life scenarios. We conduct extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4o and Llama-3.1-8B, employing various prompting strategies. Despite their capabilities, these models often struggle to detect manipulation effectively. To overcome this limitation, we propose SELF-PERCEPT, a... | Danush Khanna, Pratinav Seth, Sidhaarth Sredharan Murali, Aditya Kumar Guru, Siddharth Shukla, Tanuj Tyagi, Sandeep Chaurasia, Kripabandhu Ghosh |  |

This paper presents a novel approach to address this issue by adapting a Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) framework. Our method compresses entity-specific information while preserving task-relevant features. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on both general and financial domain RE datasets, excelling in in-domain settings (original test sets) and out-of-domain (modified test sets with type-constrained entity replacements). Our approach offers a robust, interpretable, and theoretically grounded methodology. | Samuel Mensah, Elena Kochkina, Jabez Magomere, Joy Prakash Sain, Simerjot Kaur, Charese Smiley |  |

Yet, we hypothesize that a key limitation remains: the entanglement of general knowledge and task-specific adaptations. To overcome this, we propose a modular framework that disentangles these components by constructing a library of task-specific LoRA modules alongside a general-domain LoRA. By subtracting this general knowledge component from each task-specific module, we obtain residual modules that focus more exclusively on task-relevant information. We call this approach general knowledge subtraction or GenKnowSub. Leveraging the refined task-specific modules and the Arrow routing algorithm, we dynamically select and combine modules for new inputs without additional training. Our studies on the Phi-3 model and standard Arrow as baselines reveal that using general knowledge LoRAs derived from diverse languages, including English,... | Mohammadtaha Bagherifard, Sahar Rajabi, Ali Edalat, Yadollah Yaghoobzadeh |  |

We examine this question in the context of binomial ordering preferences involving two conjoined nouns in English. When choosing a binomial ordering (radio and television vs television and radio), humans rely on more than simply the observed frequency of each option. Humans also rely on abstract ordering preferences (e.g., preferences for short words before long words). We investigate whether large language models simply rely on the observed preference in their training data, or whether they are capable of learning the abstract ordering preferences (i.e., abstract representations) that humans rely on. Our results suggest that both smaller and larger models’ ordering preferences are driven exclusively by their experience with that item in the training data. Our study provides further insights into differences between how large language... | Zachary Nicholas Houghton, Kenji Sagae, Emily Morgan |  |

Exploring EMG-to-Text Conversion with LLMs](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2025.acl-short.56) |  | 0 | Unvoiced electromyography (EMG) is an effective communication tool for individuals unable to produce vocal speech. However, most prior methods rely on paired voiced and unvoiced EMG signals, along with speech data, for unvoiced EMG-to-text conversion, which is not practical for these individuals. Given the rise of large language models (LLMs) in speech recognition, we explore their potential to understand unvoiced speech. To this end, we address the challenge of learning from unvoiced EMG alone and propose a novel EMG adaptor module that maps EMG features to an LLM’s input space, achieving an average word error rate of 0.49 on a closed-vocabulary unvoiced EMG-to-text task. Even with a conservative data availability of just six minutes, our approach improves performance over specialized models by nearly 20%. While LLMs have been shown to be extendable to new language modalities—such as audio—understanding articulatory biosignals, like unvoiced EMG, is more challenging.

Structural differences between models result in extra development costs and limit knowledge sharing between tasks. In this work, we present UniMAE, a novel unsupervised training method that transforms an Decoder-Only LLM into a Uni-Directional Masked Auto-Encoder. UniMAE compresses high-quality semantic information into the [EOS] embedding while preserving the generation capabilities of LLMs. Comprehensive evaluations across 56 MTEB datasets demonstrate that UniMAE can achieve state-of-the-art results under unsupervised settings with merely 100 training steps, establishing the first effective approach to unifying generation and representation learning in decoder-only architectures. | Dan Qiao, Yuan Gao, Zheming Yang, Di Yang, Ziheng Wu, Pengcheng Lu, Minghui Qiu, Juntao Li, Min Zhang |  |

Current solutions incur prohibitive training costs, leaving statistical behaviors and cost-effective approaches underexplored. From the decoding perspective, we identify the Posterior Salience Attenuation (PSA) phenomenon, where the salience ratio correlates with long-text performance degradation. Notably, despite the attenuation, gold tokens still occupy high-ranking positions in the decoding space. Motivated by it, we propose the training-free Positional Contrastive Decoding (PCD) that contrasts the logits derived from long-aware attention with those from designed local-aware attention, enabling the model to focus on the gains introduced by large-scale short-to-long training. Through the analysis of long-term decay simulation, we demonstrate that PCD effectively alleviates attention score degradation. Experimental results show that PCD achieves... | Zikai Xiao, Ziyang Wang, Wen Ma, Yan Zhang, Wei Shen, WangYan WangYan, Luqi Gong, Zuozhu Liu |  |

We observe that during decoding, the attention scores of most tokens in Video-LLMs tend to be sparse and concentrated, with only certain tokens requiring comprehensive full attention. Based on this insight, we introduce Sparse-to-Dense (StD), a novel decoding strategy that integrates two distinct modules: one leveraging sparse top-K attention and the other employing dense full attention. These modules collaborate to accelerate Video-LLMs without loss. The fast (sparse) model speculatively decodes multiple tokens, while the slow (dense) model verifies them in parallel. StD is a tuning-free, plug-and-play solution that achieves up to a 1.94 walltime speedup in video processing. It maintains model performance while enabling a seamless... | Xuan Zhang, Cunxiao Du, Sicheng Yu, Jiawei Wu, Fengzhuo Zhang, Wei Gao, Qian Liu |  |

Evaluations often use metrics like AUROC to assess how well UQ methods (e.g., negative sequence probabilities) correlate with task correctness functions (e.g., ROUGE-L). We show that mutual biases-when both UQ methods and correctness functions are biased by the same factors-systematically distort evaluation. First, we formally prove that any mutual bias non-randomly skews AUROC rankings, compromising benchmark integrity. Second, we confirm this happens empirically by testing 7 widely used correctness functions, from lexical-based and embedding-based metrics to LM-as-a-judge approaches, across 4 datasets × 4 models × 8 UQ methods. Our analysis showsthat length biases in correctness functions distort UQ assessments by interacting with length biases in UQ methods. We identify LM-as-a-judge methods as the least length-biased, offering a promising path for a fairer UQ evaluation. | Andrea Santilli, Adam Golinski, Michael Kirchhof, Federico Danieli, Arno Blaas, Miao Xiong, Luca Zappella, Sinead Williamson |  |

We find that despite not directly seeing the original training data, students memorize more than baseline models (models of the same size, trained on the original data)—3.4% for exact matches and 57% for extractive memorization—and show increased hallucination rates. Further, under this SeqKD setting, we also characterize how students behave on specific training data subgroups, such as subgroups with low quality or specific counterfactual memorization (CM) scores, and find that students exhibit greater denoising on low-quality subgroups. Finally, we propose a modification to SeqKD named Adaptive-SeqKD, which intervenes in SeqKD to reduce memorization and hallucinations. Overall, we recommend caution when applying SeqKD: students inherit both their teachers’ superior performance and their... | Verna Dankers, Vikas Raunak |  |

The model focuses on retrieving relevant portions of a code repository based on natural language queries such as requests to implement new features or fix bugs. These retrieved code chunks can then be presented to an user or to a second code-editing model or agent. To train CoRet, we propose a loss function explicitly designed for repository-level retrieval. On SWE-bench and Long Code Arena’s bug localisation datasets, we show that our model substantially improves retrieval recall by at least 15 percentage points over existing models, and ablate the design choices to show their importance in achieving these results. | Fabio Fehr, Prabhu Teja Sivaprasad, Luca Franceschi, Giovanni Zappella |  |

The Human Reference and the Limits of Progress](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2025.acl-short.63) |  | 0 | In Machine Translation (MT) evaluation, metric performance is assessed based on agreement with human judgments. In recent years, automatic metrics have demonstrated increasingly high levels of agreement with humans. To gain a clearer understanding of metric performance and establish an upper bound, we incorporate human baselines in the MT meta-evaluation, that is, the assessment of MT metrics’ capabilities. Our results show that human annotators are not consistently superior to automatic metrics, with state-of-the-art metrics often ranking on par with or higher than human baselines. Despite these findings suggesting human parity, we discuss several reasons for caution. Finally, we explore the broader implications of our results for the research field, asking: Can we still reliably measure improvements in MT evaluation? With this work, we aim to shed light on the limits of our ability to measure progress in the field, fostering discussion on an issue that we believe is crucial to the... | Lorenzo Proietti, Stefano Perrella, Roberto Navigli |  |

A recent advancement, the Directed Acyclic Transformer (DAT), addresses this issue by capturing multiple translation modalities to paths in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). However, the collaboration with the latent variable introduced through the Glancing training (GLAT) is crucial for DAT to attain state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we introduce Diffusion Directed Acyclic Transformer (Diff-DAT), which serves as an alternative to GLAT as a latent variable introduction for DAT. Diff-DAT offers two significant benefits over the previous approach. Firstly, it establishes a stronger alignment between training and inference. Secondly, it facilitates a more flexible tradeoff between quality and latency. | Quan NguyenTri, Cong Dao Tran, Hoang ThanhTung |  |

However, what is often overlooked is a “precomputation step”, which requires a one-time but significant computational cost. The authors of MEMIT (CITATION) originally precompute approximately 44 million hidden vectors per edited layer, which requires a forward pass over 44 million tokens. For GPT-J (6B), this precomputation step takes 36 hours on a single GPU, while it takes approximately 40 hours for Llama2-7B. Additionally, this precomputation time grows with model size. In this paper, we show that this excessive computational cost is unnecessary. Knowledge editing using MEMIT and related methods, such as ROME and EMMET, can be performed by pre-computing a very small portion of the 44 million hidden vectors. We first present the theoretical minimum number of hidden vector precomputation required for solutions... | Akshat Gupta, Maochuan Lu, Thomas Hartvigsen, Gopala Anumanchipalli |  |

Among work focused on the so-called founding era (mid to late 18th century), the majority of such studies use the Corpus of Founding Era American English (COFEA) and rely on methods such as word counting and manual coding. Here, we demonstrate what can be inferred about meaning change and variation using more advanced NLP methods, focusing on terms in the U.S. Constitution. We also carry out a data quality assessment of COFEA, pointing out issues with OCR quality and metadata, compare diachronic change to synchronic variation, and discuss limitations when using NLP methods for studying historical meaning. | Dallas Card |  |

Previous methods required obtaining pre-segmented article chunks through additional retrieval models. This paper explores leveraging the parameterized knowledge stored during the pre-training phase of large language models (LLMs) to recall reference passage from any starting position independently. We propose a two-stage framework that simulates the scenario of humans recalling easily forgotten references. Initially, the LLM is prompted to recall document title identifiers to obtain a coarse-grained document set. Then, based on the acquired coarse-grained document set, it recalls fine-grained passage. In the two-stage recall process, we use constrained decoding to ensure that content outside of the stored documents is not generated. To increase speed, we only recall a short prefix in the second stage, and then locate its position to retrieve a... | Ye Wang, Xinrun Xu, Zhiming Ding |  |

In this paper, we study empirically whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit the same behavior of conversational adaptation.We construct a corpus of conversations between LLMs and find that two LLM agents end up making more similar syntactic choices as conversations go on, confirming that modern LLMs adapt their language use to their conversational partners in at least a rudimentary way. | Florian Kandra, Vera Demberg, Alexander Koller |  |

This linguistic disparity is particularly evident for Bangla - the 5th most spoken language. A few initiatives attempted to create open-source Bangla LLMs with performance still behind high-resource languages and limited reproducibility. To address this gap, we introduce TigerLLM - a family of Bangla LLMs. Our results demonstrate that these models surpass all open-source alternatives and also outperform larger proprietary models like GPT3.5 across standard benchmarks, establishing TigerLLM as the new baseline for future Bangla language modeling. | Nishat Raihan, Marcos Zampieri |  |

Effective triage systems, like those in emergency rooms, could ensure proper prioritization of open cases, optimizing time and resource allocation in the court system. In this work, we introduce the Criticality Prediction dataset, a novel resource for evaluating case prioritization. Our dataset features a two-tier labeling system: (1) the binary LD-Label, identifying cases published as Leading Decisions (LD), and (2) the more granular Citation-Label, ranking cases by their citation frequency and recency, allowing for a more nuanced evaluation. Unlike existing approaches that rely on resource-intensive manual annotations, we algorithmically derive labels leading to a much larger dataset than otherwise possible. We evaluate several multilingual models, including both smaller fine-tuned models and large language models in a zero-shot setting. Our results show that the fine-tuned models... | Ronja Stern, Ken Kawamura, Matthias Stürmer, Ilias Chalkidis, Joel Niklaus |  |

While LLMs have shown potential in zero-shot forecasting through prompting alone, recent studies suggest that LLMs lack inherent effectiveness in forecasting. Given these conflicting findings, a rigorous validation is essential for drawing reliable conclusions. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs as zero-shot forecasters compared to state-of-the-art domain-specific models. Our experiments show that LLM-based zero-shot forecasters often struggle to achieve high accuracy due to their sensitivity to noise, underperforming even simple domain-specific models. We have explored solutions to reduce LLMs’ sensitivity to noise in the zero-shot setting, but improving their robustness remains a significant challenge. Our findings suggest that rather than emphasizing zero-shot forecasting, a more... | Junwoo Park, Hyuck Lee, Dohyun Lee, Daehoon Gwak, Jaegul Choo |  |

However, their ability to evaluate generated content remains limited, and training vision-language reward models (VLRMs) with preference data is computationally expensive. This paper explores a training-free alternative by merging text-based reward models (RMs) with LVLMs to create VLRMs. Our approach shows that integrating these models leads to improved performance over LVLMs’ scoring and text-based RMs, offering an efficient method for incorporating textual preferences into LVLMs. | ChenAn Li, TzuHan Lin, YunNung Chen, Hungyi Lee |  |

However, LLMs often fail to effectively self-verify and generate correct feedback, further misleading refinement and leading to the failure of self-correction, especially in complex reasoning tasks. In this paper, we propose Program-driven Self-Correction (ProgCo). First, program-driven verification (ProgVe) achieves complex verification logic and extensive validation through self-generated, self-executing verification pseudo-programs. Then,program-driven refinement (ProgRe) receives feedback from ProgVe, conducts dual reflection and refinement on both responses and verification programs to mitigate misleading of incorrect feedback in complex reasoning tasks. Experiments on three instruction-following and mathematical benchmarks indicate that ProgCo achieves effective self-correction, and can be further enhance performance when combined with... | Xiaoshuai Song, Yanan Wu, Weixun Wang, Jiaheng Liu, Wenbo Su, Bo Zheng |  |

This paper focuses on parameter-efficient fine-tuning using soft prompting, a promising approach that adapts pre-trained models to downstream tasks by learning a small set of parameters. We propose a novel Input Dependent Soft Prompting technique with a self-Attention Mechanism (ID-SPAM) that generates soft prompts based on the input tokens and attends different tokens with varying importance. Our method is simple and efficient, keeping the number of trainable parameters small. We show the merits of the proposed approach compared to state-of-the-art techniques on various tasks and show the improved zero shot domain transfer capability. | Ananth Muppidi, Abhilash Nandy, Sambaran Bandyopadhyay |  |

These evaluation metrics are acceptable for determining the extent to which language models can understand and reason about text in a general sense, but fail to capture nuanced capabilities, such as the ability of language models to recognize and obey rare grammar points, particularly in languages other than English. We measure the perplexity of language models when confronted with the “first person psych predicate restriction” grammar point in Japanese. Weblab is the only tested open source model in the 7-10B parameter range which consistently assigns higher perplexity to ungrammatical psych predicate sentences than grammatical ones. We give evidence that Weblab’s uniformly bad tokenization is a possible root cause for its good performance, and show that Llama 3’s perplexity on grammatical psych predicate sentences can be reduced by orders of magnitude (28x... | Andrew Gambardella, Takeshi Kojima, Yusuke Iwasawa, Yutaka Matsuo |  |

Many studies analyze unique hard attention transformers, where attention selects a single position that maximizes the attention scores. When multiple positions achieve the maximum score, either the rightmost or the leftmost of those is chosen. In this paper, we highlight the importance of this seeming triviality. Recently, finite-precision transformers with both leftmost- and rightmost-hard attention were shown to be equivalent to Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). We show that this no longer holds with only leftmost-hard attention—in that case, they correspond to a strictly weaker fragment of LTL. Furthermore, we show that models with leftmost-hard attention are equivalent to soft attention, suggesting they may better approximate real-world transformers than right-attention models. These findings refine the landscape of transformer expressivity... | Selim Jerad, Anej Svete, Jiaoda Li, Ryan Cotterell |  |

However, prior research highlights that LLMs often overlook input-label mapping information in ICL, relying more on their pre-trained knowledge. To address this issue, we introduce In-Context Contrastive Decoding (ICCD), a novel method that emphasizes input-label mapping by contrasting the output distributions between positive and negative in-context examples. Experiments on 7 natural language understanding (NLU) tasks show that our ICCD method brings consistent and significant improvement (up to +1.8 improvement on average) upon 6 different scales of LLMs without requiring additional training. Our approach is versatile, enhancing performance with various demonstration selection methods, demonstrating its broad applicability and effectiveness.

Does this finding also hold for speech translation (ST) models? If so, what are the implications for the speaker’s gender assignment in translation? We address these questions from an interpretability perspective, using probing methods to assess gender encoding across diverse ST models. Results on three language directions (English → French/Italian/Spanish) indicate that while traditional encoder-decoder models capture gender information, newer architectures—integrating a speech encoder with a machine translation system via adapters—do not. We also demonstrate that low gender encoding capabilities result in systems’ tendency toward a masculine default, a translation bias that is more pronounced in newer architectures. | Dennis Fucci, Marco Gaido, Matteo Negri, Luisa Bentivogli, André F.

Previous studies show that semantic parsing enhances the performance of smaller models (e.g., BERT) on downstream tasks. However, it remains unclear whether the improvements extend similarly to LLMs. In this paper, our empirical findings reveal that, unlike smaller models, directly adding semantic parsing results into LLMs reduces their performance. To overcome this, we propose SENSE, a novel prompting approach that embeds semantic hints within the prompt. Experiments show that SENSE consistently improves LLMs’ performance across various tasks, highlighting the potential of integrating semantic information to improve LLM capabilities. | Kaikai An, Shuzheng Si, Helan Hu, Haozhe Zhao, Yuchi Wang, Qingyan Guo, Baobao Chang |  |

In forensic settings simply being considered as one of the potential authors of an evidential piece of text or communication can result in undesirable scrutiny. This raises a fairness question: Is every author in the candidate pool at equal risk of misattribution? Standard evaluation measures for authorship attribution systems do not explicitly account for this notion of fairness. We introduce a simple measure, Misattribution Unfairness Index (MAUIk), which is based on how often authors are ranked in the top k for texts they did not write. Using this measure we quantify the unfairness of five models on two different datasets. All models exhibit high levels of unfairness with increased risks for some authors. Furthermore, we find that this unfairness relates to how the models embed the authors as vectors in the latent search space. In particular, we observe that the risk of misattribution is higher for authors... | Pegah Alipoormolabashi, Ajay Patel, Niranjan Balasubramanian |  |

Using PhoAudiobook, we conduct experiments on three leading zero-shot TTS models: VALL-E, VoiceCraft, and XTTS-V2. Our findings demonstrate that PhoAudiobook consistently enhances model performance across various metrics. Moreover, VALL-E and VoiceCraft exhibit superior performance in synthesizing short sentences, highlighting their robustness in handling diverse linguistic contexts. We publicly release PhoAudiobook to facilitate further research and development in Vietnamese text-to-speech. | Thi Vu, Linh The Nguyen, Dat Quoc Nguyen |  |

TestCase-Eval: A Systematic Evaluation of Fault Coverage and Exposure](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2025.acl-short.82) |  | 0 | We introduce TestCase-Eval, a new benchmark for systematic evaluation of LLMs in test-case generation. TestCase-Eval includes 500 algorithm problems and 100,000 human-crafted solutions from the Codeforces platform. It focuses on two pivotal tasks: (1) Fault Coverage, which measures how well LLM-generated test sets probe diverse input scenarios and cover a wide range of potential failure modes. (2) Fault Exposure, which evaluates whether LLMs can craft a tailored test input that reveals a specific incorrect code implementation. We provide a comprehensive assessment of 19 state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs on TestCase-Eval, offering insights into their strengths and limitations in generating effective test cases for algorithm problems. | Zheyuan Yang, Zexi Kuang, Xue Xia, Yilun Zhao |  |

Rethinking Sorting in LLM-Based Pairwise Ranking with Batching and Caching](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2025.acl-short.83) |  | 0 | We introduce a novel framework for analyzing sorting algorithms in pairwise ranking prompting (PRP), re-centering the cost model around LLM inferences rather than traditional pairwise comparisons. While classical metrics based on comparison counts have traditionally been used to gauge efficiency, our analysis reveals that expensive LLM inferences overturn these predictions; accordingly, our framework encourages strategies such as batching and caching to mitigate inference costs. We show that algorithms optimal in the classical setting can lose efficiency when LLM inferences dominate the cost under certain optimizations. | Juan Wisznia, Cecilia Bolaños, Juan Tollo, Giovanni Marraffini, Agustín Gianolini, Noe Hsueh, Luciano Del Corro |  |

A key concern is that models often produce confident, yet unfounded, answers to unanswerable problems. We introduce TreeCut, a synthetic dataset that systematically generates infinite unanswerable math word problems and their answerable counterparts, by representing each question as a tree and removing chosen necessary conditions. Experiments show TreeCut effectively induce hallucinations in large language models, including GPT-4o and o3-mini, with rates of 64% and 44% in their respective worst-case scenarios under zero-shot setting. Further analysis highlights that deeper or more complex trees, composite item names, and removing necessary condition near the middle of a path all increase the likelihood of hallucinations, underscoring the persistent challenges LLMs face in identifying unanswerable math problems.

However, obtaining large-scale, high-quality labeled data remains a key challenge, particularly in desktop environments like Windows Operating System (OS). Existing datasets primarily focus on structured web-based elements, leaving a gap in real-world GUI interaction data for non-web applications. To address this, we introduce a new framework that leverages LLMs to generate large-scale GUI grounding data, enabling automated and scalable labeling across diverse interfaces. To ensure high accuracy and reliability, we manually validated and refined 5,000 GUI coordinate-instruction pairs, creating WinSpot—the first benchmark specifically designed for GUI grounding tasks in Windows environments. WinSpot provides a high-quality dataset for training and evaluating visual GUI agents, establishing a foundation for future research in GUI automation across diverse and unstructured desktop environments. | Zheng Hui, Yinheng Li, Dan Zhao, Colby R.

Although large language models (LLMs) have shown promise, they may rely on superficial cues leading to spurious predictions. Using the MIMIC portion of the SHAC (Social History Annotation Corpus) dataset and focusing on drug status extraction as a case study, we demonstrate that mentions of alcohol or smoking can falsely induce models to predict current/past drug use where none is present, while also uncovering concerning gender disparities in model performance. We further evaluate mitigation strategies—such as prompt engineering and chain-of-thought reasoning—to reduce these false positives, providing insights into enhancing LLM reliability in health domains. | Fardin Ahsan Sakib, Ziwei Zhu, Karen Trister Grace, Meliha Yetisgen, Özlem Uzuner |  |

We present an embodied emotion classification dataset, CHEER-Ekman, extending the existing binary embodied emotion dataset with Ekman’s six basic emotion categories. Using automatic best-worst scaling with large language models, we achieve performance superior to supervised approaches on our new dataset. Our investigation reveals that simplified prompting instructions and chain-of-thought reasoning significantly improve emotion recognition accuracy, enabling smaller models to achieve competitive performance with larger ones. | Phan Anh Duong, Cat Luong, Divyesh Bommana, Tianyu Jiang |  |

To date, however, progress in this direction remains limited by scarce gaze data. We overcome the issue with ScanEZ, a self-supervised framework grounded in cognitive models of reading. ScanEZ jointly models the spatial and temporal dimensions of scanpaths by leveraging synthetic data and a 3-D gaze objective inspired by masked language modeling. With this framework, we provide evidence that two key factors in scanpath prediction during reading are: the use of masked modeling of both spatial and temporal patterns of eye movements, and cognitive model simulations as an inductive bias to kick-start training. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on established datasets (e.g., up to 31.4% negative log-likelihood improvement on CELER L1), and proves portable across different experimental conditions. | Ekta Sood, Prajit Dhar, Enrica Troiano, Rosy Southwell, Sidney K.

For example, a summarization system that tends to overrepresent negative reviews of products can mislead customers into disregarding good products. Previous works measure fairness in MDS at two levels: summary-level and corpus-level. While summary-level fairness focuses on individual summaries, corpus-level fairness focuses on a corpus of summaries. Recent methods primarily focus on summary-level fairness. We propose FairPO, a preference tuning method that focuses on both summary-level and corpus-level fairness in MDS. To improve summary-level fairness, we propose to generate preference pairs by perturbing document sets. To improve corpus-level fairness, we propose fairness-aware preference tuning by dynamically adjusting the weights of preference pairs. Our experiments show that FairPO... | Haoyuan Li, Rui Zhang, Snigdha Chaturvedi |  |

In medication, a systematic benchmark to evaluate model capabilities is lacking, which is critical given the high-risk nature of medical information. This paper introduces a Chinese benchmark aimed at assessing models in medication tasks, focusing on knowledge and reasoning across six datasets: indication, dosage and administration, contraindicated population, mechanisms of action, drug recommendation, and drug interaction. We evaluate eight closed-source and five open-source models to identify knowledge boundaries, providing the first systematic analysis of limitations and risks in proprietary medical models. | Yue Wu, Yangmin Huang, Qianyun Du, Lixian Lai, Zhiyang He, Jiaxue Hu, Xiaodong Tao |  |

However, current automatic evaluations are based on procedures that diverge from human evaluation. Specifically, human evaluation derives rankings by aggregating sentence-level relative evaluation results, e.g., pairwise comparisons, using a rating algorithm, whereas automatic evaluation averages sentence-level absolute scores to obtain corpus-level scores, which are then sorted to determine rankings. In this study, we propose an aggregation method for existing automatic evaluation metrics which aligns with human evaluation methods to bridge this gap. We conducted experiments using various metrics, including edit-based metrics, -gram based metrics, and sentence-level metrics, and show that resolving the gap improves results for the most of metrics on the SEEDA benchmark.We also found that even BERT-based metrics sometimes outperform the... | Takumi Goto, Yusuke Sakai, Taro Watanabe |  |

Existing approaches for detecting hallucination in long-form tasks either focus on limited domains or rely heavily on external fact-checking tools, which may not always be available.In this work, we systematically investigate reference-free hallucination detection in open-domain long-form responses. Our findings reveal that internal states (e.g., model’s output probability and entropy) alone are insufficient for reliably (i.e., better than random guessing) distinguishing between factual and hallucinated content.

We show that WiCkeD can be automatically applied to any existing benchmark, making it more challenging. We apply WiCkeD to 6 popular benchmarks and use it to evaluate 18 open-weight LLMs. The performance of the models drops12.1 points on average with respect to the original versions of the datasets. When using chainof-thought on 3 MMLU datasets, the performance drop for the WiCkeD variant is similar to the one observed when using the LLMs directly, showing that WiCkeD is also challenging for models with enhanced reasoning abilities. WiCkeD also uncovers that some models are more sensitive to the extra reasoning required, providing additional information with respect to the original benchmarks.We relase our code and data at github.com/anonymized. | Ahmed Elhady, Eneko Agirre, Mikel Artetxe |  |

We investigate whether visual information can bridge this gap instead. Image caption datasets are very easy to create without requiring multilingual expertise, so this offers a more efficient alternative for low-resource languages. We find that multilingual image-caption alignment can implicitly align the text representations between languages, languages unseen by the encoder in pretraining can be incorporated into this alignment post-hoc, and these aligned representations are usable for cross-lingual Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and bitext retrieval. | Nathaniel Krasner, Nicholas Lanuzo, Antonios Anastasopoulos |  |

Recent work attributes this deterioration to an exponential decay in hidden-state memory. While token filtering has emerged as a promising remedy, its underlying rationale and limitations remain largely non-understood. In this paper, we first investigate the attention patterns of Mamba to shed light on why token filtering alleviates long-context degradation. Motivated by these findings, we propose LAMB, a training-free, attention-guided token filtering strategy designed to preserve critical tokens during inference. LAMB can boost long-context performance for both pure SSMs and hybrid models, achieving up to an average improvement of 30.35% over state-of-the-art techniques on standard long-context understanding benchmarks. Our analysis and experiments reveal new insights into the interplay between attention, token selection, and... | Zhifan Ye, Zheng Wang, Kejing Xia, Jihoon Hong, Leshu Li, Lexington Whalen, Cheng Wan, Yonggan Fu, Yingyan Celine Lin, Souvik Kundu |  |

Prior works have highlighted this limitation, particularly in maintaining temporal consistency when understanding event relations. For example, models often confuse mutually exclusive temporal relations like “before” and “after” between events and make inconsistent predictions. In this work, we tackle the issue of temporal inconsistency in LLMs by proposing a novel counterfactual prompting approach. Our method generates counterfactual questions and enforces collective constraints, enhancing the model’s consistency. We evaluate our method on multiple datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in event ordering for explicit and implicit events and temporal commonsense understanding, by effectively addressing temporal inconsistencies. | Jongho Kim, Seungwon Hwang |  |

While extensive research has investigated biases in LLMs, prior work has predominantly focused on explicit bias, with minimal attention to implicit bias and the relation between these two forms of bias. This paper presents a systematic framework grounded in social psychology theories to investigate and compare explicit and implicit biases in LLMs.We propose a novel self-reflection-based evaluation framework that operates in two phases: first measuring implicit bias through simulated psychological assessment methods, then evaluating explicit bias by prompting LLMs to analyze their own generated content. Through extensive experiments on advanced LLMs across multiple social dimensions, we demonstrate that LLMs exhibit a substantial inconsistency between explicit and implicit biases: while explicit bias manifests as mild stereotypes, implicit bias exhibits strong... | Yachao Zhao, Bo Wang, Yan Wang, Dongming Zhao, Ruifang He, Yuexian Hou |  |

Existing AVR benchmarks focus on single-step reasoning, emphasizing the end result but neglecting the multi-stage nature of reasoning process. Past studies found MLLMs struggle with these benchmarks, but it doesn’t explain how they fail. To address this gap, we introduce MultiStAR, a Multi-Stage AVR benchmark, based on RAVEN, designed to assess reasoning across varying levels of complexity. Additionally, existing metrics like accuracy only focus on the final outcomes while do not account for the correctness of intermediate steps. Therefore, we propose a novel metric, MSEval, which considers the correctness of intermediate steps in addition to the final outcomes. We conduct comprehensive experiments on MultiStAR using 17 representative close-source and... | Yanbei Jiang, Yihao Ding, Chao Lei, Jiayang Ao, Jey Han Lau, Krista A. Ehinger |  |

In this paper, we conduct a rigorous theoretical analysis of LLMs’ mathematical abilities, with a specific focus on their arithmetic performances. We identify numerical precision as a key factor that influences their effectiveness in arithmetical tasks. Our results show that Transformers operating with low numerical precision fail to address arithmetic tasks, such as iterated addition and integer multiplication, unless the model size grows super-polynomially with respect to the input length. In contrast, Transformers with standard numerical precision can efficiently handle these tasks with significantly smaller model sizes. We further support our theoretical findings through empirical experiments that explore the impact of varying numerical precision on arithmetic tasks, providing valuable... | Guhao Feng, Kai Yang, Yuntian Gu, Xinyue Ai, Shengjie Luo, Jiacheng Sun, Di He, Zhenguo Li, Liwei Wang |  |

While MoE layers improve LLM performance without increasing inference costs, the ever-growing number of experts inflates memory requirements, hindering practical deployment. Our empirical study reveals that some experts encode redundant knowledge during pre-training. We thus propose a method of grouping and pruning similar experts to improve the model’s parameter efficiency. We validate the effectiveness of our method by pruning three state-of-the-art MoE architectures, including Mixtral, Deepseek-MoE, and Qwen. The evaluation shows that our method outperforms other model pruning methods on a range of natural language tasks. | Zeliang Zhang, Xiaodong Liu, Hao Cheng, Chenliang Xu, Jianfeng Gao |  |

It aims to generate responses consistent with the dialogue history and personality information across multiple sessions to engage users’ interest in the dialogue. Recent approaches focusing on history modeling and persona modeling have advanced the development of this field. However, they overlook the importance of dialogue structure in helping large language models (LLMs) understand the dialogue context. Moreover, these methods do not efficiently expand and utilize personality information, reducing the responses’ consistency. In this paper, we propose a Persona-Aware LLM-enAnCEd(PALACE) framework for multi-session personalized dialogue generation. Specifically, the framework consists of three components: a topic-aware memory bank, a persona prompt learning module, and VAE-LoRA. The topic-aware memory bank works by retrieving historical information that possesses a certain... | Dongshuo Liu, Zhijing Wu, Dandan Song, Heyan Huang |  |

Previous research on IIMT was primarily conducted on simplified scenarios such as images of one-line text with black font in white backgrounds, which is far from reality and impractical for applications in the real world. To make IIMT research practically valuable, it is essential to consider a complex scenario where the text backgrounds are derived from real-world images. To facilitate research of complex scenarios IIMT, we design an IIMT dataset that includes subtitle text with a real-world background. However, previous IIMT models perform inadequately in complex scenarios. To address the issue, we propose the DebackX model, which separates the background and text-image from the source image, performs translation on the text-image directly, and fuses the translated text-image with the background to generate the target image. Experimental results show that our model achieves... | Yanzhi Tian, Zeming Liu, Zhengyang Liu, Yuhang Guo |  |

Conventional compression methods often result in substantial performance degradation within LLMs and struggle to restore model quality during fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we present Bayesian Knowledge Distillation (BayesKD), a novel distillation framework meticulously designed for compact LLMs in resource-constrained fine-tuning scenarios. Departing from conventional LLM distillation methods that introduce time-consuming paradigms and fail to generalize in compressed LLM fine-tuning scenarios, our BayesKD develops the Logits Dual-Scaling, Knowledge Alignment Module, and Bayesian Distillation Optimization. In particular, our Logits Dual-Scaling strategy adaptively aligns the strength of the teacher’s knowledge transfer, while the... | Wei Li, Lujun Li, Mark G.

To address these limitations, we introduce GOLFer - Smaller LMs-Generated Documents Hallucination Filter & Combiner - a novel method leveraging smaller open-source LMs for query expansion. GOLFer comprises two modules: a hallucination filter and a documents combiner. The former detects and removes non-factual and inconsistent sentences in generated documents, a common issue with smaller LMs, while the latter combines the filtered content with the query using a weight vector to balance their influence. We evaluate GOLFer alongside dominant LLMs-based query expansion methods on three web search and ten low-resource datasets.... | Lingyuan Liu, Mengxiang Zhang |  |

However, the efficacy of this method is highly dependent on the quality of the generated documents, which often requires complex prompt strategies and the integration of advanced dense retrieval techniques. This can be both costly and computationally intensive. To mitigate these limitations, we explore the use of zero-shot LLM-based query expansion to improve sparse retrieval, particularly for learned sparse retrievers. We introduce a novel fusion ranking framework, Exp4Fuse, which enhances the performance of sparse retrievers through an indirect application of zero-shot LLM-based query expansion. Exp4Fuse operates by simultaneously considering two retrieval routes—one based on the original query and the other on the LLM-augmented query. It then generates two ranked lists using a sparse retriever and fuses them using a... | Lingyuan Liu, Mengxiang Zhang |  |

Foundation large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 suffer from over-predicting emotions and are too resource-intensive. We design an LLM-based data synthesis pipeline and leverage a large model, Mistral-7b, for the generation of training examples for more accessible, lightweight BERT-type encoder models. We focus on enlarging the semantic diversity of examples and propose grounding the generation into a corpus of narratives to produce non-repetitive story-character-centered utterances with unique contexts over 28 emotion classes. By running 700K inferences in 450 GPU hours, we contribute with the dataset of 100K contextual and also 300K context-less examples to cover both scenarios. We use it for fine-tuning pre-trained encoders, which results in several Emo Pillars models. We show that Emo Pillars models are... | Alexander Shvets |  |

To adapt MaaS PLMs to downstream tasks without accessing their parameters and gradients, some existing methods focus on the output-side adaptation of PLMs, viewing the PLM as an encoder and then optimizing a task-specific decoder for decoding the output hidden states and class scores of the PLM. Despite the effectiveness of these methods, they only use a single prompt to query PLMs for decoding, leading to a heavy reliance on the quality of the adopted prompt. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Multi-Prompting Decoder (MPD) framework for MaaS adaptation. The core idea is to query PLMs with multiple different prompts for each sample, thereby obtaining multiple output hidden states and class scores from PLMs for subsequent decoding. Such multi-prompting decoding paradigm can simultaneously mitigate reliance on the... | Zifeng Cheng, Zhaoling Chen, Zhiwei Jiang, Yafeng Yin, Cong Wang, Shiping Ge, Qing Gu |  |

Predictive turn-taking models (PTTMs) facilitate natural- istic human-robot interaction, yet most rely solely on speech. We introduce MM-VAP, a multimodal PTTM which combines speech with visual cues including facial expression, head pose and gaze. We find that it outperforms the state-of-the-art audio-only in videoconfer- encing interactions (84% vs. 79% hold/shift prediction accuracy). Unlike prior work which aggregates all holds and shifts, we group by duration of silence between turns. This reveals that through the inclusion of visual features, MM-VAP outperforms a state-of-the-art audio- only turn-taking model across all durations of speaker transitions. We conduct a detailed abla- tion study, which reveals that facial expression features contribute the most to model perfor- mance. Thus, our working hypothesis is that when interlocutors can see one another, visual cues are vital for turn-taking and must therefore be included for accurate... | Sam O'Connor Russell, Naomi Harte |  |

Existing work has largely been confined to the task level, without considering that tasks are artificially defined and, to LLMs, merely consist of tokens and representations. To bridge this gap, we investigate zero-shot generalization from the perspective of the data itself. We first demonstrate that zero-shot generalization happens very early during instruction tuning, with loss serving as a stable indicator. Next, we investigate training data arrangement through similarity and granularity perspectives, confirming that the timing of exposure to certain training examples may greatly facilitate generalization on unseen tasks. Finally, we propose a more grounded training data arrangement framework, Test-centric Multi-turn Arrangement, and show its effectiveness in promoting continual learning and further loss reduction.

To address this gap, we propose a novel benchmark called MFinMeeting, which is a multilingual, multi-sector, and multi-task dataset designed for financial meeting understanding. First, MFinMeeting supports English, Chinese, and Japanese, enhancing comprehension of financial discussions in diverse linguistic contexts. Second, it encompasses various industry sectors defined by the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS), ensuring that the benchmark spans a broad range of financial activities.

Leveraging large language models (LLMs), DA has significantly improved the performance of RE models with considerably fewer parameters. However, existing DA methods struggle with diversity misalignments, as they neglect the diversity required by the model and generate homogeneous augmentations that do not cover the inter-sample and inter-relation variability, leading to suboptimal performance. Inspired by the Observe-Orient-Decide-Act (OODA) framework, which provides a robust theoretical foundation for iterative decision-making under dynamic conditions, we propose an OODA-driven Diverse DA method (ODDA), guiding the data generation and selection process. DDA first observes the RE model’s behavior to select effective demonstrations for LLMs. Next, it orients LLMs towards generating diverse data by replacing schema constraints with... | Yijie Zhong, Yunfan Gao, Xiaolian Zhang, Haofen Wang |  |

In light of the detected summarization issues, we propose different cost-effective mitigation strategies, based on Chain-of-Thought prompting, that involve the injection of knowledge extracted by external, lightweight models.

To address this challenge, we propose Derailer-Rerailer, a novel framework that adaptively balances reasoning accuracy and computational efficiency. At its core, our framework employs a lightweight Derailer mechanism to assess reasoning stability and selectively triggers an advanced Rerailer verification process only when necessary, thereby optimizing computational resource usage. Extensive evaluation across both open and closed-source models on more than 20 categories of mathematical, symbolic, and commonsense reasoning tasks demonstrates our framework’s effectiveness: Derailer-Rerailer achieves significant accuracy improvements (8-11%... | Guangya Wan, Yuqi Wu, Hao Wang, Shengming Zhao, Jie Chen, Sheng Li |  |

In this paper, we introduce our winning approach for the “Conversational Multi-Doc QA” challenge in WSDM Cup 2024, which exploits the superior natural language understanding and generation capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). We first adapt LLMs to the task, then devise a hybrid training strategy to make the most of in-domain unlabeled data. Moreover, an advanced text embedding model is adopted to filter out potentially irrelevant documents, and several approaches are designed and compared for the model ensemble. Equipped with all these techniques, our solution finally ranked 1st place in WSDM Cup 2024, surpassing its rivals to a large extent.

To address these issues, we propose TreeRAG, which employs Tree-Chunking for chunking and embedding in a tree-like structure , coupled with "root-to-leaves" and "leaf-to-root" retrieve strategy named Bidirectional Traversal Retrieval. This approach effectively preserves the hierarchical structure among knowledge points and significantly enhances the ability to retrieve while minimizing noise inference.

Existing fine-grained attribution methods rely on model-internal similarity metrics between responses and documents, such as saliency scores and hidden state similarity. However, these approaches suffer from either high computational complexity or coarse-grained representations. Additionally, a common problem shared by the previous works is their reliance on decoder-only Transformers, limiting their ability to incorporate contextual information after the target span. To address the above problems, we propose two techniques applicable to all model-internals-based methods. First, we aggregate token-wise evidence through set union operations, preserving the granularity of representations. Second, we enhance the attributor by integrating dependency parsing to enrich the semantic... | Qiang Ding, Lvzhou Luo, Yixuan Cao, Ping Luo |  |

Current methods for optimizing dialogue strategies require substantial human effort for strategy optimization. To address these challenges, we propose ASTRO (Automated Strategy Optimization), a fully automated solution that leverages LLMs’ self-envolving capabilities. ASTRO dynamically generates customized strategy sets based on task goals and optimizes strategy planner using a self-play reinforcement learning paradigm. Our experimental results demonstrate ASTRO’s significant performance improvements over baseline models across various non-cooperative dialogue tasks, highlighting the potential for autonomously developing such agents without human intervention.

However, many seemingly aligned LLMs are soon shown to be susceptible to jailbreak attacks. These attacks aim to circumvent the models’ safety guardrails and security mechanisms by introducing jailbreak prompts into malicious queries. In response to these challenges, this paper introduces \*\*Defensive Prompt Patch\*\* (DPP), a novel prompt-based defense mechanism specifically designed to protect LLMs against such sophisticated jailbreak strategies. Unlike previous approaches, which have often compromised the utility of the model for the sake of safety, DPP is designed to achieve a minimal Attack Success Rate (ASR) while preserving the high utility of LLMs. Our method uses strategically designed suffix prompts that effectively thwart a wide range of standard and adaptive jailbreak techniques.

Graded entity salience addresses this need by assigning entities scores that reflect their relative importance in a text. Existing approaches fall into two main categories: subjective judgments of salience, which allow for gradient scoring but lack consistency, and summarization-based methods, which define salience as mention-worthiness in a summary, promoting explainability but limiting outputs to binary labels (entities are either summary-worthy or not). In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for graded entity salience that combines the strengths of both approaches. Using an English dataset spanning 12 spoken and written genres, we collect 5 summaries per document and calculate each entity’s salience score based on its presence across these summaries. Our approach shows stronger... | Jessica Lin, Amir Zeldes |  |

Inthis paper, we propose a novel task: the automatic verification of individual reasoning steps in a logical deductive Chain-of-Thought. Thistask addresses two well-known problems of LLMs, hallucination and incorrect reasoning. We propose a new dataset of logical reasoningchains, in which the individual deduction steps have been manually annotated for soundness, and benchmark several methods on it. We findthat LLMs can detect unsound reasoning steps fairly well, but argue that verification has to be performed by transparent methods instead.We test symbolic methods, but find that they under-perform. We develop a neuro-symbolic baseline called VANESSA that comes closer to the performance of LLMs. | Zacchary Sadeddine, Fabian M. Suchanek |  |

We introduce the Translate-with-Care (TWC) dataset, comprising 3,950 challenging scenarios across six low- to mid-resource languages, to assess translation systems’ performance. Our analysis of diverse technologies, including GPT-4, mBART-50, NLLB-200, and Google Translate, reveals a universal struggle in translating genderless content, resulting in gender stereotyping and reasoning errors. All models preferred masculine pronouns when gender stereotypes could influence choices. Google Translate and GPT-4 showed particularly strong bias, favoring male pronouns 4-6 times more than feminine ones in leadership and professional success contexts. Fine-tuning mBART-50 on TWC substantially resolved these biases and errors, led to strong... | Pardis Sadat Zahraei, Ali Emami |  |

However, surveys often include numerous features that lead to high-dimensional inputs for machine learning models. This paper exploits a unique source of information in surveys for feature selection. We observe that feature names (i.e., survey questions) are often semantically indicative of what features are most useful. Using language models, we leverage semantic textual similarity (STS) scores between features and targets to select features. The performance of STS scores in directly ranking features as well as in the minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance (mRMR) algorithm is evaluated using survey data collected as part of a clinical study on persistent post-surgical pain (PPSP) as well as an accessible dataset collected through the NIH All of Us program. Our findings show that features selected with STS can result in higher... | Benjamin C. Warner, Ziqi Xu, Simon Haroutounian, Thomas George Kannampallil, Chenyan Lu |  |

A prominent example is the “lost in the middle” phenomenon, where LLMs struggle to utilize relevant information situated in the middle of the input. While prior research primarily focuses on single pieces of relevant information, real-world applications often involve multiple relevant information pieces. To bridge this gap, we present LongPiBench, a benchmark designed to assess positional bias involving multiple pieces of relevant information. It includes various tasks and input lengths. Thorough experiments are conducted with three commercial and six open-source models. These experiments reveal that while most current models are more robust against the “lost in the middle” issue, there also exist noticeable biases related to the spacing of relevant information pieces. These findings highlight the importance of evaluating and reducing positional biases for long-context LLMs. | Runchu Tian, Yanghao Li, Yuepeng Fu, Siyang Deng, Qinyu Luo, Cheng Qian, Shuo Wang, Xin Cong, Zhong Zhang, Yesai Wu, Yankai Lin, Huadong Wang, Xiaojiang Liu |  |

Specifically, we quantize the most important layers to higher bit precision and less important layers to lower bits. We propose two effective strategies to measure the importance of layers within LLMs: the first measures the importance of a layer based on how different its output embeddings are from the input embeddings (higher is better); the second estimates the importance of a layer using the number of layer weights that are much larger than average (smaller is better). We show that quantizing different layers at varying bits as per our importance scores results in minimal performance drop with a far more compressed model. Finally, we present several practical key takeaways from our variable layer-wise quantization experiments: (a) LLM performance under variable quantization remains close... | RazvanGabriel Dumitru, Vikas Yadav, Rishabh Maheshwary, PaulIoan Clotan, Sathwik Tejaswi Madhusudhan, Mihai Surdeanu |  |

A Petroglyph Revisited](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.30/) |  | 0 | Do autoregressive Transformer language models require explicit positional encodings (PEs)? The answer is ‘no’ provided they have more than one layer—they can distinguish sequences with permuted tokens without the need for explicit PEs. This follows from the fact that a cascade of (permutation invariant) set processors can collectively exhibit sequence-sensitive behavior in the autoregressive setting. This property has been known since early efforts (contemporary with GPT-2) adopting the Transformer for language modeling. However, this result does not appear to have been well disseminated, leading to recent rediscoveries. This may be partially due to a sudden growth of the language modeling community after the advent of GPT-2/3, but perhaps also due to the lack of a clear explanation in prior work, despite being commonly understood by practitioners in the past. Here we review the long-forgotten explanation why explicit PEs are nonessential for multi-layer autoregressive Transformers... | Kazuki Irie |  |

Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simpler and more efficient alternative, but its performance depends heavily on the quality of preference data. To address this, we propose Confidence-Reward driven Preference Optimization (CRPO), a novel method that combines reward scores with model confidence to improve data selection for fine-tuning. CRPO selects challenging sentence pairs where the model is uncertain or underperforms, leading to more effective learning. While primarily designed for LLMs, CRPO also generalizes to encoder-decoder models like NLLB, demonstrating its versatility. Empirical results show that CRPO outperforms existing methods such as RS-DPO, RSO and MBR score in both... | Guofeng Cui, Pichao Wang, Yang Liu, Zemian Ke, Zhu Liu, Vimal Bhat |  |

Specifically, LLMs fail to focus on characteristic elements driving dominant discourses and lack the ability to integrate contextual information required for understanding abstract ideological views. To address these limitations, we propose a framework motivated by the theory of ideological discourse analysis to analyze news articles related to real-world events. Our framework represents the news articles using a relational structure−talking points, which captures the interaction between entities, their roles, and media frames along with a topic of discussion. It then constructs a vocabulary of repeating themes−prominent talking points, that are used to generate ideology-specific viewpoints (or partisan perspectives). We evaluate our framework’s ability to generate these perspectives through automated tasks−ideology... | Nishanth Sridhar Nakshatri, Nikhil Mehta, Siyi Liu, Sihao Chen, Daniel Hopkins, Dan Roth, Dan Goldwasser |  |

Previous work by retrieving a set of tokens iteratively with retrieved content prepending to the input poses a high runtime issue, which degrades the inference efficiency of the LLMs because they fail to use the Key-Value (KV) cache efficiently. We propose FlashBack, a modular RALM designed to improve the inference efficiency of RALM with appending context pattern while maintaining decent performance after fine-tuning by Low-Rank Adaption. FlashBack appends retrieved documents at the end of the context for efficiently utilizing the KV cache. We also introduce the Marking Token as two special prompt tokens for marking the appending context during fine-tuning. Our experiments show that FlashBack can improve language modeling performance in... | Runheng Liu, Xingchen Xiao, Heyan Huang, Zewen Chi, Zhijing Wu |  |

With the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 in the medical field, leveraging these technologies for the Medical Quality Control Indicator Calculation (MQCIC) presents a promising approach. In this work, (1) we introduce a real-world task MQCIC and propose an open-source Chinese electronic medical records (EMRs)-based dataset (CMQCIC-Bench) comprising 785 instances and 76 indicators. (2) We propose a semi-automatic method to enhance the rule representation. Then we propose the Clinical Facts-based Inferential Rule (CF-IR) method that disentangles the clinical fact verification and inferential rule reasoning actions. (3) We conduct comprehensive experiments on 20 representative LLMs, covering general and medical models. Our findings reveal that CF-IR outperforms Chain-of-Thought methods in MQCIC tasks.

However, editing commonsense knowledge still faces difficulties, including limited knowledge coverage in existing resources, the infeasibility of annotating labels for an overabundance of commonsense knowledge, and the strict knowledge formats of current editing methods. In this paper, we address these challenges by presenting ConceptEdit, a framework that integrates conceptualization and instantiation into the KE pipeline for LLMs to enhance their commonsense reasoning capabilities. ConceptEdit dynamically diagnoses implausible commonsense knowledge within an LLM using another verifier LLM and augments the source knowledge to be edited with conceptualization for stronger generalizability. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMs enhanced with... | Liyu Zhang, Weiqi Wang, Tianqing Fang, Yangqiu Song |  |

Traditional statistical causal discovery methods, while well-established, predominantly rely on observational data and often overlook the semantic cues inherent in cause-and-effect relationships. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has ushered in an affordable way of leveraging the semantic cues for knowledge-driven causal discovery, but the development of LLMs for causal discovery lags behind other areas, particularly in the exploration of multi-modal data. To bridge the gap, we introduce MatMCD, a multi-agent system powered by tool-augmented LLMs. MatMCD has two key agents: a Data Augmentation agent that retrieves and processes modality-augmented data, and a Causal Constraint agent that integrates multi-modal data for knowledge-driven reasoning. The proposed design of the inner-workings ensures successful cooperation of the agents. Our... | ChengAo Shen, Zhengzhang Chen, Dongsheng Luo, Dongkuan Xu, Haifeng Chen, Jingchao Ni |  |

Due to resource limitations, SLMs struggle to accurately interpret natural language questions and may overlook critical constraints, leading to challenges such as generating SQL with incorrect logic or incomplete conditions. To address these issues, we propose PARSQL, a novel framework that leverages SQL parsing and reasoning. Specifically, we design PARSer, an SQL parser that extracts constraints from SQL to generate sub-SQLs for data augmentation and producing step-by-step SQL explanations (reason) via both rule-based and LLM-based methods. We define a novel text-to-reason task and incorporate it into multi-task learning, thereby enhancing text-to-SQL performance. Additionally, we employ an efficient SQL selection strategy that conducts direct similarity computation... | Yaxun Dai, Haiqin Yang, Hao Mou, Pingfu Chao |  |

However, their outputs often include confidently stated inaccuracies. Earlier works suggest that LLMs encode truthfulness as a distinct linear feature, termed the “truth direction”, which can classify truthfulness reliably. We address several open questions about the truth direction: (i) whether LLMs universally exhibit consistent truth directions; (ii) whether sophisticated probing techniques are necessary to identify truth directions; and (iii) how the truth direction generalizes across diverse contexts.Our findings reveal that not all LLMs exhibit consistent truth directions, with stronger representations observed in more capable models, particularly in the context of logical negation.Additionally, we demonstrate that truthfulness probes trained on declarative atomic statements can generalize effectively to logical transformations, question-answering tasks, in-context... | Yuntai Bao, Xuhong Zhang, Tianyu Du, Xinkui Zhao, Zhengwen Feng, Hao Peng, Jianwei Yin |  |

This method, however, relies solely on pairwise comparisons, where the generations are evaluated within an identical context. While effective to such conditional preferences often fail to encompass the nuanced and multidimensional nature of human preferences. In this work, we revisit the traditional paradigm of preference acquisition and propose a new axis based on eliciting preferences jointly over the instruction-response pairs. Unlike prior preference optimizations, which are designed for conditional ranking protocols (e.g., DPO), we propose Joint Preference Optimization (JPO), a new preference optimization objective that upweights the joint probability of the chosen instruction-response pair over the rejected instruction-response pair. Interestingly, LLMs trained with joint instruction-response preference data using... | Hritik Bansal, Ashima Suvarna, Gantavya Bhatt, Nanyun Peng, KaiWei Chang, Aditya Grover |  |

Originating from psychometrics, adaptive testing has become the mainstream method for human measurement and has now been widely applied in education, healthcare, sports, and sociology. It customizes assessments by selecting the fewest test questions . However, current adaptive testing methods face several challenges. The mechanized nature of most algorithms leads to guessing behavior and difficulties with open-ended questions. Additionally, subjective assessments suffer from noisy response data and coarse-grained test outputs, further limiting their effectiveness. To move closer to an ideal adaptive testing process, we propose TestAgent, a large language model (LLM)-powered agent designed to enhance adaptive testing through interactive engagement. This is the first application of LLMs in adaptive testing. TestAgent... | Junhao Yu, Yan Zhuang, Yuxuan Sun, Weibo Gao, Qi Liu, Mingyue Cheng, Zhenya Huang, Enhong Chen |  |

However, techniques like in-context learning only consider similarity when drawing few-shot examples and not cross-group differences in values. We propose SPICA, a framework that accounts for group-level differences during in-context example retrieval. SPICA introduces three designs: scenario banks, group-informed retrieval metrics, and in-context alignment prompts. From an evaluation of SPICA on an alignment task collecting inputs from four demographic groups (n = 544), our metrics retrieve in-context examples that more closely match observed preferences, with the best prompt configuration using multiple contrastive responses to demonstrate examples. In an end-to-end evaluation (n = 120), we observe that SPICA is higher rated than similarity-based retrieval, with groups seeing up to a +0.16 point improvement on a 5 point scale.

Often these models know how to solve a task but their auto-regressive decoding nature leads to incorrect results if started incorrectly. We observe that smaller models in particular, when corrected, can solve a task that they would otherwise struggle with. We demonstrate this phenomenon by using a larger model to guide smaller models, which leads to significantly improved performance (up to +24 points on the GSM8K dataset by 7B models). To assist smaller models in initiating the starting step, we propose QuestCoT, where a smaller model first asks how to start before proceeding with a chain of reasoning. On various multistep mathematical reasoning datasets over multiple smaller models, we show that getting the start right can lead to significant performance gains across all models (gains of up to +6 points on GSM8K, +9 on SVAMP, +5 on ASDiv, and +7 on MultiArith). | Kushal Jain, Moritz Miller, Niket Tandon, Kumar Shridhar |  |

Previous studies mainly adopt prompt learning paradigm to predict a causal answer word based on a Pre-trained Language Model (PLM) for causality existence identification. However, the indecision in selecting answer words from some synonyms and the confusion of indicating opposite causal directions with the same answer word raise more challenges in directional causality identification. Inspired by the strong capabilities of pre-trained Generative Language Models (GLMs) in generating responses or statements, we propose to instruct a GLM to generate causality statements and identify directional event causality by evaluating the generated statements. Specifically, we propose an Instructive Generation and Statement Evaluation method to identify both the existence and direction of causality. We first fine-tune a GLM to instructively generate causality statements based... | Wei Xiang, Chuanhong Zhan, Qing Zhang, Bang Wang |  |

However, the best practice to leverage coding instruction data to enhance mathematical reasoning remains underexplored. This study investigates three key questions: (1) How do different coding styles of mathematical code-based rationales impact LLMs’ learning performance? (2) Can general-domain coding instructions improve performance? (3) How does integrating textual rationales with code-based ones during training enhance mathematical reasoning abilities? Our findings reveal that code-based rationales with concise comments, descriptive naming, and hardcoded solutions are beneficial, while improvements from general-domain coding instructions and textual rationales are relatively minor. Based on these insights, we propose CoinMath, a learning strategy designed to enhance mathematical reasoning by diversifying the coding styles of... | Chengwei Wei, Bin Wang, JungJae Kim, Guimei Liu, Nancy F.

Important efforts in this direction rely on manual or automatic fact-checking, which can be challenging for emerging claims with limited information. Such scenarios can be handled by assessing the reliability and the political bias of the source of the claim, i.e., characterizing entire news outlets rather than individual claims or articles. This is an important but understudied research direction. While prior work has looked into linguistic and social contexts, we do not analyze individual articles or information in social media. Instead, we propose a novel methodology that emulates the criteria that professional fact-checkers use to assess the factuality and political bias of an entire outlet. Specifically, we design a variety of prompts based on these criteria and elicit responses from large language models (LLMs), which we... | Zain Muhammad Mujahid, Dilshod Azizov, Maha Tufail Agro, Preslav Nakov |  |

To support such comparison, structured representation that captures fine-grained information plays a vital role.In particular, identifying distinct atomic facts and the discourse relations connecting them enables deeper semantic comparison. Our proposed approach combines structured discourse information extraction with a classifier, FDSpotter, for factual consistency verification. We show that adversarial discourse relations pose challenges for language models, but fine-tuning on our annotated data, DiscInfer, achieves competitive performance. Our proposed approach advances factual consistency verification by grounding in linguistic structure and decomposing it into interpretable components. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the evaluation of two tasks: data-to-text... | Kun Zhang, Oana Balalau, Ioana Manolescu |  |

To bridge this gap, motivated by human behaviour, we introduce a generalizable and explicit paradigm for uncovering interactive patterns of LLMs across diverse worldviews. Specifically, we first define interactive hallucination through stance transfer, then construct SHARP, a benchmark built by extracting relations from commonsense knowledge graphs and utilizing LLMs’ inherent hallucination properties to simulate multi-role interactions. Extensive experiments confirm our paradigm’s effectiveness and stability, examine the factors that influence these metrics, and challenge conventional hallucination mitigation solutions. More broadly, our work reveals a fundamental limitation in popular post-training methods for... | Chuyi Kong, Ziyang Luo, Hongzhan Lin, Zhiyuan Fan, Yaxin Fan, Yuxi Sun, Jing Ma |  |

This issue has been noted and discussed over the past 10 years, but without the benefit of data to inform the discourse.To address this lack in the literature, we present a survey- and interview-based analysis of the lack of adoption of NLP in LD, focusing on the matter of collaborations between documentary linguists and NLP researchers.

However, due to privacy concerns, existing academic research lacks direct access to such data, making benchmarking difficult. To fill this gap, we propose a synthetic data pipeline that generates realistic user profiles and private documents, enabling the creation of PersonaBench—a benchmark for evaluating models’ ability to understand personal information. Using this benchmark, we assess Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines on personalized questions and find that current models struggle to accurately extract and answer questions even when provided with the full set of user documents, highlighting the need for improved personalization methods. | Juntao Tan, Liangwei Yang, Zuxin Liu, Zhiwei Liu, Rithesh R.

However, only annotating existing samples may hardly benefit the model’s generalization. Moreover, AL commonly faces a cold start problem due to insufficient annotated data for effective sample selection. To address this, we introduce a counterfactual data augmentation approach inspired by Variation Theory, a theory of human concept learning that emphasizes the essential features of a concept by focusing on what stays the same and what changes. We use a neuro-symbolic pipeline to pinpoint key conceptual dimensions and use a large language model (LLM) to generate targeted variations along those dimensions. Through a text classification experiment, we show that our approach achieves significantly higher performance when there are fewer annotated data, showing its capability to address the cold start problem in AL. We also find that as the annotated training data gets larger, the impact of the generated data... | Simret Araya Gebreegziabher, Kuangshi Ai, Zheng Zhang, Elena L. Glassman, Toby JiaJun Li |  |

General-purpose models, while versatile, often lack the depth needed for expert-level tasks because of limited domain-specific information. Domain adaptation training can enhance these models, but it demands substantial, high-quality data. To address this, we propose ORBIT, a cost-efficient methodology for curating massive, high-quality domain-specific datasets from noisy web sources, tailored for training specialist large language models. Using astronomy as a primary case study, we refined the 1.3T-token FineWeb-Edu dataset into a high-quality, 10B-token subset focused on astronomy. Fine-tuning LLaMA-3-8B on a 1B-token astronomy subset improved performance on the MMLU astronomy benchmark from 69% to 76% and achieved top results on AstroBench, an astronomy-specific benchmark.

The varying degrees of effectiveness observed in these methods highlight both the complexity and importance of addressing this cognitive bias. We believe these effects are inherently rooted in LLMs, and a comprehensive solution that fully addresses SPE may be beyond the scope of this work. However, we have proposed practical strategies, such as using binary choices instead of multiple choices where feasible, limiting prompt length, and placing... | Xiaobo Guo, Soroush Vosoughi |  |

Numerous studies have attempted to apply pre-trained LLMs to single-cell data analysis within one tissue. However, when it comes to cross-tissue cell annotation, LLMs often suffer from unsatisfactory performance due to the lack of specialized biological knowledge regarding genes and tissues. In this paper, we introduce scRAG, a novel framework that incorporates advanced LLM-based RAG techniques into cross-tissue single-cell annotation. scRAG utilizes LLMs to retrieve structured triples from knowledge graphs and unstructured similar cell information from the reference cell database, and it generates candidate cell types. The framework further optimizes predictions by retrieving marker genes from both candidate cells and similar cells to refine its results.

We introduce Open-Target Stance Detection (OTSD), the most realistic task where targets are neither seen during training nor provided as input. We evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) from GPT, Gemini, Llama, and Mistral families, comparing their performance to the only existing work, Target-Stance Extraction (TSE), which benefits from predefined targets. Unlike TSE, OTSD removes the dependency of a predefined list, making target generation and evaluation more challenging. We also provide a metric for evaluating target quality that correlates well with human judgment. Our experiments reveal that LLMs outperform TSE in target generation, both when the real target is explicitly and not explicitly mentioned in the text. Similarly, LLMs overall surpass TSE in stance detection for both explicit and non-explicit cases. However, LLMs struggle in both target generation and... | Abu Ubaida Akash, Ahmed Fahmy, Amine Trabelsi |  |

In this work, we seek to improve alignment between language models and human brain while processing speech information by integrating associative memory. After verifying the alignment between language model and brain by mapping language model activations to brain activity, the original text stimuli expanded with simulated associative memory are regarded as input to computational language models. We find the alignment between language model and brain is improved in brain regions closely related to associative memory processing.

However, these models still lack the ability to recognize their knowledge boundaries and refuse to answer questions they don’t know proactively. While there have been successful attempts to enhance the reliability of LLMs, reliable LALMs remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we systematically investigate various approaches towards reliable LALMs, including training-free methods such as multi-modal chain-of-thought (MCoT), and training-based methods such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Besides, we identify the limitations of previous evaluation metrics and propose a new metric, the Reliability Gain Index (RGI), to assess the effectiveness of different reliable methods. Our findings suggest that both training-free and training-based methods enhance the reliability of LALMs to... | Ziyang Ma, Xiquan Li, Yakun Song, Wenxi Chen, Chenpeng Du, Jian Wu, Yuanzhe Chen, Zhuo Chen, Yuping Wang, Yuxuan Wang, Xie Chen |  |

Experimental results show that larger vocabulary sizes lead to better performance in LLMs. Moreover, we consider a continual training scenario where a pre-trained language model is trained on a different target language. We introduce a simple method to use a new vocabulary instead of the pre-defined one. We show that using the new vocabulary outperforms the model with the vocabulary used in pre-training. | Sho Takase, Ryokan Ri, Shun Kiyono, Takuya Kato |  |

However, real-world recommendation settings are generally multimodal, causing a significant gap between existing research and practical applications. To address this issue, we propose Muse, the first multimodal conversational recommendation dataset. Muse comprises 83,148 utterances from 7,000 conversations centered around the Clothing domain. Each conversation contains comprehensive multimodal interactions, rich elements, and natural dialogues. Data in Muse are automatically synthesized by a multi-agent framework powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs). It innovatively derives user profiles from real-world scenarios rather than depending on manual design and history data for better scalability, and then it fulfills conversation simulation and optimization. Both human and LLM evaluations demonstrate the high quality of conversations in Muse. Additionally, fine-tuning experiments on three MLLMs... | Zihan Wang, Xiaocui Yang, Yongkang Liu, Shi Feng, Daling Wang, Yifei Zhang |  |

In this work, we explore an unsupervised approach to translation direction detection based on the simple hypothesis that p(translation\|original)>p(original\|translation), motivated by the well-known simplification effect in translationese or machine-translationese. In experiments with multilingual machine translation models across 20 translation directions, we confirm the effectiveness of the approach for high-resource language pairs, achieving document-level accuracies of 82–96% for NMT-produced translations, and 60–81% for human translations, depending on the model used. | Michelle Wastl, Jannis Vamvas, Rico Sennrich |  |

Investigating the Effects of Architectural Inductive Biases on Hallucination](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.60/) |  | 0 | The growth in prominence of large language models (LLMs) in everyday life can be largely attributed to their generative abilities, yet some of this is also owed to the risks and costs associated with their use. On one front is their tendency to hallucinate false or misleading information, limiting their reliability. On another is the increasing focus on the computational limitations associated with traditional self-attention based LLMs, which has brought about new alternatives, in particular recurrent models, meant to overcome them. Yet it remains uncommon to consider these two concerns simultaneously. Do changes in architecture exacerbate/alleviate existing concerns about hallucinations? Do they affect how and where they occur? Through an extensive evaluation, we study how these architecture-based inductive biases affect the propensity to hallucinate. While hallucination remains a general phenomenon not limited to specific architectures, the situations in which they occur and the... | Jerry Huang, Prasanna Parthasarathi, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Boxing Chen, Sarath Chandar |  |

While recent LLMs are typically fine-tuned with tool usage examples during supervised fine-tuning (SFT), questions remain about their ability to develop robust tool-usage skills and can effectively generalize to unseen queries and tools. In this work, we present GenTool, a novel training framework that prepares LLMs for diverse generalization challenges in tool utilization. Our approach addresses two fundamental dimensions critical for real-world applications: Zero-to-One Generalization, enabling the model to address queries initially lacking a suitable tool by adopting and utilizing one when it becomes available, and Weak-to-Strong Generalization, allowing models to leverage enhanced versions of existing tools to solve queries. To achieve this, we develop synthetic training data simulating these two dimensions of tool usage... | Jie He, Jennifer Neville, Mengting Wan, Longqi Yang, Hui Liu, Xiaofeng Xu, Xia Song, Jeff Z.

One significant application of LLMs is in tackling software engineering challenges, particularly in resolving real-world tasks on GitHub by fixing code based on the issues reported by the users. However, many current approaches rely on proprietary LLMs, which limits reproducibility, accessibility, and transparency. The critical components of LLMs for addressing software engineering issues and how their capabilities can be effectively enhanced remain unclear. To address these challenges, we introduce SWE-Fixer, a novel open-source framework designed to effectively and efficiently resolve GitHub issues. SWE-Fixer comprises two essential modules: a code file retrieval module and a code editing module. The retrieval module employs BM25 along with a lightweight model to achieve coarse-to-fine file retrieval. Subsequently, the code editing module utilizes the other model to generate... | Chengxing Xie, Bowen Li, Chang Gao, He Du, Wai Lam, Difan Zou, Kai Chen |  |

While VLMs perform well on vision tasks that they are trained on, our results highlight key challenges in abstract pattern recognition. We present GlyphPattern, a 954 item dataset that pairs 318 human-written descriptions of visual patterns from 40 writing systems with three visual presentation styles.GlyphPattern evaluates abstract pattern recognition in VLMs, requiring models to understand and judge natural language descriptions of visual patterns. GlyphPattern patterns are drawn from a large-scale cognitive science investigation of human writing systems; as a result, they are rich in spatial reference and compositionality. Our experiments show that GlyphPattern is challenging for state-of-the-art VLMs (GPT-4o achieves only 55% accuracy), with marginal gains from few-shot prompting. Our detailed analysis reveals errors at multiple levels, including visual processing, natural language... | Zixuan Wu, Yoolim Kim, Carolyn Jane Anderson |  |

The automated generation of counterfactual examples remains a challenging task even for large language models (LLMs), despite their impressive performance on many tasks. In this paper, we first introduce ZeroCF, a faithful approach for leveraging important words derived from feature attribution methods to generate counterfactual examples in a zero-shot setting. Second, we present a new framework, FitCF, which further verifies aforementioned counterfactuals by label flip verification and then inserts them as demonstrations for few-shot prompting, outperforming three state-of-the-art baselines. Through ablation studies, we identify the importance of each of FitCF’s core components in improving the quality of counterfactuals, as assessed through flip rate, perplexity, and similarity measures.... | Qianli Wang, Nils Feldhus, Simon Ostermann, Luis Felipe VillaArenas, Sebastian Möller, Vera Schmitt |  |

Existing methods focus on correcting the output, but they often overlook the potential of improving the ability of LLMs to detect and correct misleading content in the input itself. In this paper, we propose a novel three-stage fine-tuning method that enhances the ability of LLMs to detect and correct misleading information in the input, further improving response accuracy and reducing hallucinations. Specifically, the three stages include (1) training LLMs to identify misleading information, (2) training LLMs to correct the misleading information using built-in or external knowledge, and (3) training LLMs to generate accurate answers based on the corrected queries. To evaluate our method, we conducted experiments on three datasets for the hallucination... | Guocong Li, Weize Liu, Yihang Wu, Ping Wang, Shuaihan Huang, Hongxia Xu, Jian Wu |  |

A key issue is that fine-tuning often compromises the safety alignment of LLMs. To address this issue, we propose a method named IRR (Identify, Remove, and Recalibrate for Safety Realignment) that performs safety realignment for LLMs. The core of IRR is to identify and remove unsafe delta parameters from the fine-tuned models, while recalibrating the retained parameters. We evaluate the effectiveness of IRR across various datasets, including both full fine-tuning and LoRA methods. Our results demonstrate that IRR significantly enhances the safety performance of fine-tuned models on safety benchmarks, such as harmful queries and jailbreak attacks, while maintaining their performance on downstream tasks.

Based on the insight that such risks can originate from trade-offs between the agent’s Helpful, Harmlessness and Honest (HHH) goals, we build a novel three-stage evaluation framework, which is carefully constructed to effectively and naturally expose such risks. We conduct 14,400 agentic simulations across 12 advanced LLMs, with extensive experiments and analysis. Results reveal that LLM agents can autonomously engage in catastrophic behaviors and deception, without being deliberately induced. Furthermore, stronger reasoning abilities often increase, rather than mitigate, these risks. We also show that these agents can violate instructions and superior commands. On the whole, we empirically prove the existence of catastrophic risks in autonomous LLM agents. | Rongwu Xu, Xiaojian Li, Shuo Chen, Wei Xu |  |

As a representative PEFT method, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) introduces low-rank matrices to approximate the incremental tuning parameters and achieves impressive performance over multiple scenarios. After that, plenty of improvements have been proposed for further improvement. However, these methods either focus on single-task scenarios or separately train multiple LoRA modules for multi-task scenarios, limiting the efficiency and effectiveness of LoRA in multi-task scenarios. To better adapt to multi-task fine-tuning, in this paper, we propose a novel Mixture of Low-Rank Experts (MoRE) for multi-task PEFT. Specifically, instead of using an individual LoRA for each task, we align different ranks of LoRA module with different tasks, which we named low-rank experts.... | Dacao Zhang, Kun Zhang, Shimao Chu, Le Wu, Xin Li, Si Wei |  |

While LLMs have achieved notable success across various domains, their application in specialized fields such as lunar exploration remains underdeveloped, and their full potential in this domain has yet to be fully realized. To address this gap, we introduce Lunar Twins, the first LLMs designed specifically for lunar exploration, along with a collaborative framework that combines both large and small models. Additionally, we present Lunar GenData, a multi-agent collaborative workflow for generating lunar instructions, and establish the first specialized lunar dataset, which integrates real data from the Chang’e lunar missions. Lastly, we developed Lunar Eval, the first comprehensive evaluation suite for assessing the capabilities of LLMs in lunar exploration tasks. Experimental validation demonstrates that our approach not only enhances domain... | XinYu Xiao, Yalei Liu, Xiangyu Liu, Zengrui Li, Erwei Yin, Qianchen Xia |  |

To encourage more transparent documentation and facilitate discussion on human-AI system evaluation design options, we present an evaluation card SPHERE, which encompasses five key dimensions: 1) What is being evaluated?; 2) How is the evaluation conducted?; 3) Who is participating in the evaluation?; 4) When is evaluation conducted?; 5) How is evaluation validated? We conduct a review of 39 human-AI systems using SPHERE, outlining current evaluation practices and areas for improvement. We provide three recommendations for improving the validity and rigor of evaluation practices. | Dora Zhao, Qianou Ma, Xinran Zhao, Chenglei Si, Chenyang Yang, Ryan Louie, Ehud Reiter, Diyi Yang, Tongshuang Wu |  |

Speech, as a natural mode of communication, encodes rich user-specific characteristics such as speaking rate and pitch, making it critical for effective interaction. Our work introduces a data-centric customization approach for efficiently enhancing multimodal understanding in conversational speech modeling. Central to our contributions is a novel multi-task learning paradigm that involves designing auxiliary tasks to utilize a small amount of speech data. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Spoken-SQuAD benchmark, using only 10% of the training data with open-weight models, establishing a robust and efficient framework for audio-centric conversational modeling. We also introduce ASK-QA, the first dataset for multi-turn spoken dialogue with ambiguous user requests and dynamic evaluation inputs. | Maximillian Chen, Ruoxi Sun, Sercan Ö. Arik |  |

Integrating Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can enhance reasoning; however, existing methods typically demand costly fine-tuning or retrieve noisy KG information. Recent approaches leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to generate KG-based input embedding prefixes as soft prompts for LLMs but fail to account for question relevance, resulting in noisy prompts. Moreover, in MCQA tasks, the absence of relevant KG knowledge for certain answer options remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we propose Question-Aware Knowledge Graph Prompting (QAP), which incorporates question embeddings into GNN aggregation to dynamically assess KG relevance. QAP employs global attention to capture inter-option relationships, enriching soft prompts with inferred knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that QAP outperforms state-of-the-art... | Haochen Liu, Song Wang, Chen Chen, Jundong Li |  |

Given a wide range of MLLMs, model merging potentially offers a cheap way to aggregate their diverse knowledge into a single MLLM. However, directly plug-in existing model merging approaches often leads to suboptimal performance due to (1) inclusion of harmful models that have over-confident predictions in the target task; (2) the lack of specialized designs for vision-language inputs. To tackle these pain points, we conduct pioneering investigations to dissect the merging procedures and propose an uncertainty-guided MLLM merging algorithm, i.e., UQ-Merge, which i) identifies beneficial candidates for merging, ii) determines the merging order and the number of helpful candidates, and iii) performs appropriate merging. Within our framework, we consider uncertainty quantification on both text and... | Huaizhi Qu, Xinyu Zhao, Jie Peng, Kwonjoon Lee, Behzad Dariush, Tianlong Chen |  |

However, their generated responses often suffer from hallucinations, hindering their widespread adoption in high stakes domains such as law, which can potentially mislead experts and propagate societal harms. To enhance trustworthiness in these systems, one promising approach is to attribute the answer to an actual source, thereby improving the factuality and verifiability of the response. In pursuit of advancing attributed legal question answering, we introduce AQuAECHR, a benchmark comprising information-seeking questions from ECHR jurisprudence along with attributions to relevant judgments. We present strategies to automatically curate this dataset from ECHR case law guides and utilize an LLM-based filtering pipeline to improve dataset quality, as validated by legal experts. Additionally, we assess several LLMs, including those trained on legal corpora, on this dataset to underscore... | Korbinian Q. Weidinger, T. Y. S. S. Santosh, Oana Ichim, Matthias Grabmair |  |

However, S2ST still faces two main challenges: 1) extracting linguistic features for various speech signals, called cross-modal (CM), and 2) learning alignment of difference languages in long sequences, called cross-lingual (CL). We propose the unit language to overcome the two modeling challenges. The unit language can be considered a text-like representation format, constructed using n-gram language modeling. We implement multi-task learning to utilize the unit language in guiding the speech modeling process. Our initial results reveal a conflict when applying source and target unit languages simultaneously. We propose task prompt modeling to mitigate this conflict. We conduct experiments on four languages of the Voxpupil dataset. Our method demonstrates significant improvements over a strong baseline and achieves performance comparable to models trained with text. | Yuhao Zhang, Xiangnan Ma, Kaiqi Kou, Peizhuo Liu, Weiqiao Shan, Benyou Wang, Tong Xiao, Yuxin Huang, Zhengtao Yu, JingBo Zhu |  |

Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs), though excel at using vision to ground real-world objects, often struggle with accurately localizing GUI elements – a critical requirement for effective GUI automation – due to the semantic gap between real-world objects and GUI elements. In this work, we introduce Ponder & Press, a divide-and-conquer framework for general computer control that uses only visual input. Our approach combines a general-purpose MLLM as an ‘interpreter’, responsible for translating high-level user instructions into detailed action descriptions, with a GUI-specific MLLM as a ‘locator’ that precisely locates GUI elements for action placement. By leveraging a purely visual input, our agent offers a versatile, human-like interaction paradigm applicable to various applications.... | Yiqin Wang, Haoji Zhang, Jingqi Tian, Yansong Tang |  |

Understanding and executing complex rules, along with multi-step planning, are fundamental to logical reasoning and critical for practical LLM agents and decision-making systems. However, evaluating LLMs as effective rule-based executors and planners remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce LogicGame, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the comprehensive rule understanding, execution, and planning capabilities of LLMs. Unlike traditional benchmarks, LogicGame provides diverse games that contain a series of rules with an initial state, requiring models to comprehend and apply predefined regulations to solve problems. We create simulated scenarios in which models execute or plan operations to achieve specific outcomes. These game scenarios are specifically designed to distinguish logical reasoning from mere knowledge by relying exclusively... | Jiayi Gui, Yiming Liu, Jiale Cheng, Xiaotao Gu, Xiao Liu, Hongning Wang, Yuxiao Dong, Jie Tang, Minlie Huang |  |

Prior approaches for modeling network dynamics typically rely on rule-based models, which lack realism and generalizability, or deep learning-based models, which require large-scale training datasets. As abstract graph representations of entity-wise interactions, social graphs present an opportunity to explore network evolution mechanisms through realistic simulations of human-item interactions. Leveraging the pre-trained social consensus knowledge embedded in large language models (LLMs), we present GraphAgent-Generator (GAG), a novel simulation-based framework for dynamic, text-attributed social graph generation. GAG simulates the temporal node and edge generation processes for zero-shot social graph generation. The resulting graphs adhere to seven key macroscopic network properties, achieving an 11% improvement in microscopic graph structure metrics.

Within natural language processing (NLP), AD helps detect issues like spam, misinformation, and unusual user activity. Although large language models (LLMs) have had a strong impact on tasks such as text generation and summarization, their potential in AD has not been studied enough. This paper introduces AD-LLM, the first benchmark that evaluates how LLMs can help with NLP anomaly detection. We examine three key tasks: (i) zero-shot detection, using LLMs’ pre-trained knowledge to perform AD without tasks-specific training; (ii) data augmentation, generating synthetic data and category descriptions to improve AD models; and (iii) model selection, using LLMs to suggest unsupervised AD models. Through experiments with different datasets, we find that LLMs can work well in zero-shot AD, that carefully designed augmentation... | Tiankai Yang, Yi Nian, Li Li, Ruiyao Xu, Yuangang Li, Jiaqi Li, Zhuo Xiao, Xiyang Hu, Ryan A.

Despite their efficiency, LLM-based agents can hardly fully understand each other, which frequently causes errors during the development process. Moreover, the accumulation of errors could easily lead to the failure of the whole project. In order to reduce such errors, we introduce an intention aligned multi-agent framework RTADev, which utilizes a self-correction mechanism to ensure that all agents work based on a consensus. RTADev mimics human teams where individuals are free to start meetings anytime for reaching agreement. Specifically, RTADev integrates an alignment checking phase and a conditional ad hoc group review phase, so that the errors can be effectively reduced with minimum agent communications.

Prompt compression aims to reduce the inference cost by minimizing input tokens without compromising on the task performance. However, existing prompt compression techniques either rely on sub-optimal metrics such as information entropy or model it as a task-agnostic token classification problem that fails to capture task-specific information.To address these issues, we propose a novel and efficient reinforcement learning (RL) based task-aware prompt compression method. To ensure low latency requirements, we leverage existing Transformer encoder-based token classification model while guiding the learning process with task-specific reward signals using lightweight REINFORCE algorithm. We evaluate the performance of our method on three diverse and challenging tasks... | Shivam Shandilya, Menglin Xia, Supriyo Ghosh, Huiqiang Jiang, Jue Zhang, Qianhui Wu, Victor Rühle, Saravan Rajmohan |  |

While existing methodologies have aimed to generate long and coherent stories, they fall significantly short of human capabilities in terms of diversity and character depth. To address this, we introduce a novel story generation framework called CCI (Character-centric Creative story generation via Imagination). CCI features two modules for creative story generation: IG (Image-Guided Imagination) and MW (Multi-Writer model). In the IG module, we utilize a text-to-image model to create visual representations of key story elements, such as characters, backgrounds, and main plots, in a more novel and concrete manner than text-only approaches. The MW module uses these story elements to generate multiple persona-description candidates and selects the best one to insert into the story, thereby enhancing the richness and depth of the narrative. We compared the stories generated by CCI and baseline models through statistical... | Kyeongman Park, Minbeom Kim, Kyomin Jung |  |

This paper investigates the capability of state-of-the-art neural machine translation (NMT) and large language models (LLMs) in translating proverbs, which are deeply rooted in cultural contexts. We construct a translation dataset of standalone proverbs and proverbs in conversation for four language pairs. Our experiments show that the studied models can achieve good translation between languages with similar cultural backgrounds, and LLMs generally outperform NMT models in proverb translation. Furthermore, we find that current automatic evaluation metrics such as BLEU, CHRF++ and COMET are inadequate for reliably assessing the quality of proverb translation, highlighting the need for more culturally aware evaluation metrics. | Minghan Wang, VietThanh Pham, Farhad Moghimifar, ThuyTrang Vu |  |

Especially, LLM planning for multi-agent collaboration requires communication of agents or credit assignment as the feedback to re-adjust the proposed plans and achieve effective coordination. However, existing methods that overly rely on physical verification or self-reflection suffer from excessive and inefficient querying of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for multi-agent collaboration that introduces Reinforced Advantage feedback (ReAd) for efficient self-refinement of plans. Specifically, we perform critic regression to learn a sequential advantage function from LLM-planned data, and then treat the LLM planner as an optimizer to generate actions that maximize the advantage function. It endows the LLM with the foresight to discern whether the action contributes to accomplishing the final task. We provide theoretical... | Yang Zhang, Shixin Yang, Chenjia Bai, Fei Wu, Xiu Li, Zhen Wang, Xuelong Li |  |

While previous studies have built several datasets to assess LLMs’ performance on UAQ, these datasets lack factual knowledge support, which limits the evaluation of LLMs’ ability to utilize their factual knowledge when handling UAQ. To address the limitation, we introduce a new unanswerable question dataset UAQFact, a bilingual dataset with auxiliary factual knowledge created from a Knowledge Graph. Based on UAQFact, we further define two new tasks to measure LLMs’ ability to utilize internal and external factual knowledge, respectively. Our experimental results across multiple LLM series show that UAQFact presents significant challenges, as LLMs do not consistently perform well even when they have factual knowledge stored. Additionally, we find that incorporating external knowledge may enhance performance, but LLMs still cannot make full use of the knowledge... | Chuanyuan Tan, Wenbiao Shao, Hao Xiong, Tong Zhu, Zhenhua Liu, Kai Shi, Wenliang Chen |  |

It mainly comes from limited capacity and negative transfer between dissimilar languages. To address this issue, we propose a method to dynamically group and scale up the parameters of multilingual LLM while boosting positive transfer among similar languages. Specifically, the model is first tuned on monolingual corpus to determine the parameter deviation in each layer and quantify the similarity between languages. Layers with more deviations are extended to mixture-of-experts layers to reduce competition between languages, where one expert module serves one group of similar languages. Experimental results on 18 to 128 languages show that our method reduces the negative transfer between languages and significantly boosts multilingual performance with fewer parameters. Such language group... | Chong Li, Yingzhuo Deng, Jiajun Zhang, Chengqing Zong |  |

While significant advancements have been achieved in conversational emotion recognition and emotional response generation, recognizing the causes of eliciting emotions is less explored. Previous studies have primarily focused on identifying the causes of emotions by understanding verbal contextual utterances, overlooking that non-verbal emotional cues can elicit emotions. To address this issue, we develop an Emotional Contagion Graph Network (ECGN) that simulates the impact of non-verbal implicit emotions on the counterpart’s emotions. To achieve this, we construct a heterogeneous graph that simulates the transmission of non-verbal emotions alongside verbal influences. By applying message passing between nodes, the constructed graph effectively models both the implicit emotional dynamics and explicit verbal interactions. We evaluate ECGN’s performance through extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets and compare it... | Fangxu Yu, Junjie Guo, Zhen Wu, Xinyu Dai |  |

Moreover, there is a lack of in-depth investigations into the relationship between LLM’s ability to criticize and its task-solving performance. To address these issues, we propose Critic-CoT, a novel framework that pushes LLMs toward System-2-like critic capability. Through a step-wise CoT reasoning paradigm and the automatic construction of weak-supervision data without human annotation, Critic-CoT enables LLMs to engage in slow, analytic self-critique and refinement, thereby improving their reasoning abilities. Experiments on GSM8K and MATH and out-of-domain evaluation demonstrate that our enhanced model significantly boosts task-solving performance by filtering out invalid solutions or iterative refinement. Furthermore, we... | Xin Zheng, Jie Lou, Boxi Cao, Xueru Wen, Yuqiu Ji, Hongyu Lin, Yaojie Lu, Xianpei Han, Debing Zhang, Le Sun |  |

Although benchmarks exist for assessing compositional behavior, it is unclear how to measure the difficulty of a systematic generalization problem. In this work, we show how one aspect of systematic generalization can be described by the entropy of the distribution of component parts in the training data. We formalize a framework for measuring entropy in a sequence-to-sequence task and find that the performance of popular model architectures scales with the entropy. Our work connects systematic generalization to information efficiency, and our results indicate that success at high entropy can be achieved even without built-in priors, and that success at low entropy can serve as a target for assessing progress towards robust systematic generalization. | Sondre Wold, Lucas Georges Gabriel Charpentier, Étienne Simon |  |

However, it has been speculated that this may be due to data leakage that caused language models to see the text stimuli during training. This paper presents two studies to address this concern at scale. The first study reveals relatively little leakage of five naturalistic reading time corpora in two pre-training datasets in terms of length and frequency of token n-gram overlap. The second study replicates the negative relationship between language model size and the fit of surprisal to reading times using models trained on ‘leakage-free’ data that overlaps only minimally with the reading time corpora. Taken together, this suggests that previous results using language models trained on these corpora are not driven by the effects of data leakage. | ByungDoh Oh, Hongao Zhu, William Schuler |  |

Current dense retrievers retrieve the relevant documents within a corpus via embedding similarities, which compute similarities between dense vectors mainly depending on word co-occurrence between queries and documents, but overlook the real query intents. Thus, they often retrieve numerous irrelevant documents. Particularly in the scenarios of complex queries such as negative-constraint queries, their retrieval performance could be catastrophic. To address the issue, we propose a neuro-symbolic information retrieval method, namely NS-IR, that leverages first-order logic (FOL) to optimize the embeddings of naive natural language by considering the logical consistency between queries and documents. Specifically, we introduce two novel techniques, logic alignment and connective constraint, to re-rank candidate documents, thereby enhancing retrieval relevance. Furthermore, we construct a new dataset NegConstraint... | Ganlin Xu, Zhoujia Zhang, Wangyi Mei, Jiaqing Liang, Weijia Lu, Xiaodong Zhang, Zhifei Yang, Xiaofeng Ma, Yanghua Xiao, Deqing Yang |  |

This paper aims to improve label detection that involves multi-round long dialogues by efficiently detecting OOD dialogues and images. We introduce a novel scoring framework named Dialogue Image Aligning and Enhancing Framework (DIAEF) that integrates the visual language models with the novel proposed scores that detect OOD in two key scenarios (1) mismatches between the dialogue and image input pair and (2) input pairs with previously unseen labels. Our experimental results, derived from various benchmarks, demonstrate that integrating image and multi-round dialogue OOD detection is more effective with previously unseen labels than using... | Rena Wei Gao, Xuetong Wu, Siwen Luo, Caren Han, Feng Liu |  |

To address these limitations, this paper proposes a multi-round role representation learning strategy. First, we construct an event pattern-instance graph (EPIG) to comprehensively capture the role semantics embedded in various direct and indirect associations, including those among roles within event patterns, arguments within event instances, and the alignments between patterns and instances. Second, to enhance the learning of role node representation in the graph, we optimize the update mechanisms for both node and edge representations in the EPIG graph. By leveraging the graph attention network, we iteratively update the... | Qizhi Wan, Liu Tao, Changxuan Wan, Rong Hu, Keli Xiao, Yuxin Shuai |  |

We extend it to more languages with diverse scripts and writing systems, introducing EXECUTE. Our simplified framework allows easy expansion to any language. Tests across multiple LLMs reveal that challenges in other languages are not always on the character level as in English. Some languages show word-level processing issues, some show no issues at all. We also examine sub-character tasks in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean to assess LLMs’ understanding of character components. | Lukas Edman, Helmut Schmid, Alexander Fraser |  |

We introduce HaluMap, a post-hoc framework that detects hallucinations by mapping entailment and contradiction relations between source inputs and generated outputs using a natural language inference (NLI) model. To improve reliability, we propose a calibration step leveraging intra-text relations to refine predictions. HaluMap outperforms state-of-the-art NLI-based methods by five percentage points compared to other training-free approaches, while providing clear, interpretable explanations. As a training-free and model-agnostic approach, HaluMap offers a practical solution for verifying LLM outputs across diverse NLP tasks.

To address this, we propose HopRAG, a novel RAG framework that augments retrieval with logical reasoning through graph-structured knowledge exploration. During indexing, HopRAG constructs a passage graph, with text chunks as vertices and logical connections established via LLM-generated pseudo-queries as edges. During retrieval, it employs a retrieve-reason-prune mechanism: starting with lexically or semantically similar passages, the system explores multi-hop neighbors guided by pseudo-queries and LLM reasoning to identify truly relevant ones. Experiments on multiple multi-hop benchmarks demonstrate that HopRAG’s retrieve-reason-prune mechanism can expand the retrieval scope based on logical connections and improve final answer quality. | Hao Liu, Zhengren Wang, Xi Chen, Zhiyu Li, Feiyu Xiong, Qinhan Yu, Wentao Zhang |  |

This necessitates reliable methods for detecting such AI-generated content. However, existing detectors, relying on either audio or lyrics, face key practical limitations: audio-based detectors fail to generalize to new or unseen generators and are vulnerable to audio perturbations; lyrics-based methods require cleanly formatted and accurate lyrics, unavailable in practice. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel, practically grounded approach: a multimodal, modular late-fusion pipeline that combines automatically transcribed sung lyrics and speech features capturing lyrics related information within the audio. By relying on lyrical aspects directly from audio, our method enhances robustness, mitigates susceptibility to low-level artifacts, and enables practical applicability.

We observe that LVLMs disproportionately focus on a small subset of image tokens—termed blind tokens—which are typically irrelevant to the query (e.g., background or non-object regions). We hypothesize that such attention misalignment plays a key role in generating hallucinated responses. To mitigate this issue, we propose Attentional Vision Calibration (AvisC), a test-time approach that dynamically recalibrates the influence of blind tokens without modifying the underlying attention mechanism. AvisC first identifies blind tokens by analyzing layer-wise attention distributions over image tokens, then employs a contrastive decoding strategy to balance the influence of original and blind-token-biased logits. Experiments on standard benchmarks, including POPE, MME, and AMBER, demonstrate... | Sangmin Woo, Donguk Kim, Jaehyuk Jang, Yubin Choi, Changick Kim |  |

Exploring jailbreak prompts can expose LLMs’ vulnerabilities and guide efforts to secure them. Existing methods primarily design sophisticated instructions for the LLM to follow, or rely on multiple iterations, which could hinder the performance and efficiency of jailbreaks. In this work, we propose a novel jailbreak paradigm, Simple Assistive Task Linkage (SATA), which can effectively circumvent LLM safeguards and elicit harmful responses. Specifically, SATA first masks harmful keywords within a malicious query to generate a relatively benign query containing one or multiple [MASK] special tokens. It then employs a simple assistive task—such as a masked language model task or an element lookup by position task—to encode the semantics of the masked keywords. Finally, SATA links the assistive task with the masked query to jointly perform the... | Xiaoning Dong, Wenbo Hu, Wei Xu, Tianxing He |  |

Current generative CSS models face interpretability limitations due to insufficient emotional perception and redundant discrete speech coding. To address the above issues, we present Chain-Talker, a three-stage framework mimicking human cognition: Emotion Understanding derives context-aware emotion descriptors from dialogue history; Semantic Understanding generates compact semantic codes via serialized prediction; and Empathetic Rendering synthesizes expressive speech by integrating both components. To support emotion modeling, we develop CSS-EmCap, an LLM-driven automated pipeline for generating precise conversational speech emotion captions. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that Chain-Talker produces more expressive and empathetic speech than existing methods, with CSS-EmCap contributing to reliable emotion... | Yifan Hu, Rui Liu, Yi Ren, Xiang Yin, Haizhou Li |  |

This method reduces trainable parameters and mitigates heavy memory consumption associated with full delta matrices by sequentially multiplying \mathbf A and \mathbf B with the activation. Despite its success, the intrinsic low-rank characteristic may limit its performance. Although several variants have been proposed to address this issue, they often overlook the crucial computational and memory efficiency brought by LoRA. In this paper, we propose Circular Convolution Adaptation (C3A), which not only achieves high-rank adaptation with enhanced performance but also excels in both computational power and memory utilization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that C3A consistently outperforms LoRA and its variants across various fine-tuning tasks. | Aochuan Chen, Jiashun Cheng, Zijing Liu, Ziqi Gao, Fugee Tsung, Yu Li, Jia Li |  |

In this paper, we propose a truthfulness-driven rank-adaptive LoRA method to improve LLM truthfulness (RaLFiT), which adaptively allocates the ranks in LoRA training according to the truthfulness correlations of modules within LLM. Specifically, it first measures the truthfulness correlation of each LLM module by a probing process, and allocates higher ranks to strongly correlated modules, which means a larger update subspace during training. Experimental results on TruthfulQA show that RaLFiT consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods across the Llama LLM family, verifying its effectiveness and superiority,... | Jiahao Li, Zhendong Mao, Quan Wang |  |

Under current evaluation frameworks, many editing methods achieve exceptionally high scores, sometimes nearing perfection. However, few studies integrate KE into real-world application scenarios (e.g., recent interest in LLM-as-agent). To support our analysis, we introduce a novel script-based benchmark – ScEdit (Script-based Knowledge Editing Benchmark) – which encompasses both counterfactual and temporal edits. We integrate token-level and text-level evaluation methods, comprehensively analyzing existing KE techniques. The benchmark extends traditional fact-based (“What”-type question) evaluation to action-based (“How”-type question) evaluation. We observe that all KE methods exhibit a drop in performance on established metrics and face challenges on text-level metrics, indicating a challenging task. Our benchmark is available at https://github.com/asdfo123/ScEdit. | Xinye Li, Zunwen Zheng, Qian Zhang, Dekai Zhuang, Jiabao Kang, Liyan Xu, Qingbin Liu, Xi Chen, Zhiying Tu, Dianhui Chu, Dianbo Sui |  |

While large safety guard models achieve strong performance, their computational cost is substantial. To mitigate this, smaller distilled models are used, but they often underperform on “hard” examples where the larger model provides accurate predictions. We observe that many inputs can be reliably handled by the smaller model, while only a small fraction require the larger model’s capacity. Motivated by this, we propose SafeRoute, a binary router that distinguishes hard examples from easy ones. Our method selectively applies the larger safety guard model to the data that the router considers hard, improving efficiency while maintaining accuracy compared to solely using the larger safety guard model. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our adaptive model selection significantly enhances the trade-off between... | Seanie Lee, Dong Bok Lee, Dominik Wagner, Minki Kang, Haebin Seong, Tobias Bocklet, Juho Lee, Sung Ju Hwang |  |

While moderators can facilitate participation, few studies assess conversational engagement and evaluate moderation effectiveness. To address this gap, we develop a dataset comprising 17 sessions from an online ESL conversation club, which includes both moderated and non-moderated discussions. We then introduce an approach that integrates automatic ESL dialogue assessment and a framework that categorizes moderation strategies. Our findings indicate that moderators help improve the flow of topics and start/end a conversation. Interestingly, we find active acknowledgement and encouragement to be the most effective moderation strategy, while excessive information and opinion sharing by moderators has a negative impact. Ultimately, our study paves the way for analyzing ESL group discussions and the role of moderators in non-native conversation settings.

Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising automated approach to detecting presuppositions, yet the extent to which their judgments align with human intuitions remains unexplored. Moreover, LLMs may inadvertently reflect societal biases when identifying presupposed content. To empirically investigate this, we prompt multiple large language models to evaluate presuppositions across diverse textual domains, drawing from three distinct datasets annotated by human raters. We calculate the agreement between LLMs and human raters, and find several linguistic factors associated with fluctuations in human-model agreement. Our observations reveal discrepancies in human-model alignment, suggesting potential biases in LLMs, notably influenced by gender and political ideology. | Katherine Atwell, Mandy Simons, Malihe Alikhani |  |

Current Japanese LMMs often rely on translated English datasets, restricting their ability to capture Japan-specific cultural knowledge. To address this, we explore the potential of Japanese PDF data as a training resource, an area that remains largely underutilized. We introduce a fully automated pipeline that leverages pretrained models to extract image-text pairs from PDFs through layout analysis, OCR, and vision-language pairing, removing the need for manual annotation. Additionally, we construct instruction data from extracted image-text pairs to enrich the training data. To evaluate the effectiveness of PDF-derived data, we train Japanese LMMs and assess their performance on the Japanese LMM Benchmark.

In this work, we propose EnerGIZAr, a novel methodology that improves continual pre-training by leveraging statistical word alignment techniques. Our approach utilizes GIZA++ to construct a subword-level alignment matrix between source (English) and target language tokens. This matrix enables informed initialization of target tokenizer embeddings, which provides a more effective starting point for adaptation. We evaluate EnerGIZAr against state-of-the-art initialization strategies such as OFA and FOCUS across four typologically diverse languages: Hindi, Basque, Arabic and Korean. Experimental results on key NLP tasks – including POS tagging, Sentiment Analysis, NLI, and NER – demonstrate that EnerGIZAr achieves superior monolingual performance while also out-performing all methods for... | Pranaydeep Singh, Eneko Agirre, Gorka Azkune, Orphée De Clercq, Els Lefever |  |

To advance research on AI agents in mobile scenarios, we introduce the Android Multi-annotation EXpo (AMEX), a comprehensive, large-scale dataset designed for generalist mobile GUI-control agents which are capable of completing tasks by directly interacting with the graphical user interface (GUI) on mobile devices. AMEX comprises over 104K high-resolution screenshots from popular mobile applications, which are annotated at multiple levels. Unlike existing GUI-related datasets, e.g., Rico, AitW, etc., AMEX includes three levels of annotations: GUI interactive element grounding, GUI screen and element functionality descriptions, and complex natural language instructions with stepwise GUI-action chains.

Yet, single-epoch pretraining tasks common to modern LLMs yield minimal overfitting, leading to dropout not being used for large LLMs. Nevertheless, no thorough empirical investigation has been done on the role of dropout in LM pretraining. Through experiments in single-epoch pretraining of both masked (BERT) and autoregressive (Pythia 160M and 1.4B) LMs with varying levels of dropout, we find that downstream performance in language modeling, morpho-syntax (BLiMP), question answering (SQuAD), and natural-language inference (MNLI) improves when dropout is not applied during pretraining. We additionally find that the recently-introduced “early dropout” also degrades performance over applying no dropout at all. We further investigate the models’ editability, and find that models trained without... | Houjun Liu, John Bauer, Christopher D. Manning |  |

Unfortunately, EaaS is vulnerable to model extraction attacks, highlighting the urgent need for copyright protection. Although some preliminary works propose applying embedding watermarks to protect EaaS, recent research reveals that these watermarks can be easily removed. Hence, it is crucial to inject robust watermarks resistant to watermark removal attacks. Existing watermarking methods typically inject a target embedding into embeddings through linear interpolation when the text contains triggers. However, this mechanism results in each watermarked embedding having the same component, which makes the watermark easy to identify and eliminate. Motivated by this, in this paper, we propose a novel embedding-specific watermarking (ESpeW) mechanism to offer robust copyright protection for EaaS. Our approach involves injecting unique, yet readily identifiable watermarks into each embedding. Watermarks... | Zongqi Wang, Baoyuan Wu, Jingyuan Deng, Yujiu Yang |  |

However, the process of selecting tokens for masking is random, and the percentage of masked tokens is typically fixed for the entire training process. In this paper, we propose to adjust the masking ratio and to decide which tokens to mask based on a novel task-informed anti-curriculum learning scheme. First, we harness task-specific knowledge about useful and harmful tokens in order to determine which tokens to mask. Second, we propose a cyclic decaying masking ratio, which corresponds to an anti-curriculum schedule (from hard to easy). We exemplify our novel task-informed anti-curriculum by masking (TIACBM) approach across three diverse downstream tasks: sentiment analysis, text classification by topic, and authorship attribution. Our findings suggest that TIACBM enhances the ability of the model to focus on key task-relevant features, contributing to statistically... | Andrei Jarca, FlorinelAlin Croitoru, Radu Tudor Ionescu |  |

In RLHF, and more generally during post-training, flawed reward signals often lead to outputs that optimize for these spurious correlates instead of genuine quality or correctness. We propose \*\*Carmo (Context-Aware Reward Modeling)\*\*, a novel approach that first generates dynamic, context-relevant criteria to ground the reward model prior to producing reward scores. Unlike prior methods that use static rubrics, Carmo leverages powerful LLMs to adaptively create evaluation criteria, e.g., logical consistency, clarity, and depth, tailored to the user query. Our theoretical analysis shows that such criteria generation can mitigate reward hacking. We further demonstrate how Carmo can be distilled into smaller models, thereby lowering the computational cost of alignment.

In this paper, we introduce SLAM-Omni, a timbre-controllable, end-to-end voice interaction system with single-stage training. SLAM-Omni achieves zero-shot timbre control by modeling spoken language with semantic tokens and decoupling speaker information to a vocoder. By predicting grouped speech semantic tokens at each step, our method significantly reduces the sequence length of audio tokens, accelerating both training and inference. Additionally, we propose historical text prompting to compress dialogue history, facilitating efficient multi-round interactions. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that SLAM-Omni outperforms prior models of similar scale, requiring only 15 hours of training on 4 GPUs with limited data. Notably, it is the first spoken dialogue system to achieve competitive performance with a single-stage training approach, eliminating... | Wenxi Chen, Ziyang Ma, Ruiqi Yan, Yuzhe Liang, Xiquan Li, Ruiyang Xu, Zhikang Niu, Yanqiao Zhu, Yifan Yang, Zhanxun Liu, Kai Yu, Yuxuan Hu, Jinyu Li, Yan Lu, Shujie Liu, Xie Chen |  |

To address this issue, we present C2LEVA, a comprehensive bilingual benchmark featuring systematic contamination prevention. C2LEVA firstly offers a holistic evaluation encompassing 22 tasks, each targeting a specific application or ability of LLMs, and secondly a trustworthy assessment due to our contamination-free tasks, ensured by a systematic contamination prevention strategy that fully automates test data renewal and enforces data protection during benchmark data release. Our large-scale evaluation of 15 open-source and proprietary models demonstrates the effectiveness of C2LEVA. | Yanyang Li, Tin Long Wong, Cheung To Hung, Jianqiao Zhao, Duo Zheng, Ka Wai Liu, Michael R.

A Fine-grained Analysis on the Effectiveness of Input Representations and Models for Table Question Answering](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.117/) |  | 0 | In table question answering (TQA), tables are encoded as either texts or images. Prior work suggests that passing images of tables to multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) performs comparably to using textual input with large language models (LLMs). However, the lack of controlled setups limits fine-grained distinctions between these approaches. In this paper, we conduct the first controlled study on the effectiveness of several combinations of table representations and model types from two perspectives: question complexity and table size. We build a new benchmark based on existing TQA datasets. In a systematic analysis of seven pairs of MLLMs and LLMs, we find that the best combination of table representation and model varies across setups. We propose FRES, a method selecting table representations dynamically, and observe a 10% average performance improvement compared to using both representations indiscriminately. | Wei Zhou, Mohsen Mesgar, Heike Adel, Annemarie Friedrich |  |

While standardized patient (SP) simulations provide valuable experiential learning, they are often costly and inflexible. Virtual patient (VP) systems offer a scalable alternative, but most fail to adapt to the varying communication skills of trainees. In particular, when trainees respond ineffectively, VPs should escalate in hostility or become uncooperative—yet this level of adaptive interaction remains largely unsupported. To address this gap, we introduce Adaptive-VP, a VP dialogue generation framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to dynamically adapt VP behavior based on trainee input. The framework features a pipeline for constructing clinically grounded yet flexible VP scenarios and a modular system for assessing trainee communication and adjusting VP responses in real time, while ensuring learner safety. We validated Adaptive-VP by simulating challenging patient... | Keyeun Lee, Seolhee Lee, Esther Hehsun Kim, Yena Ko, Jinsu Eun, Dahee Kim, Hyewon Cho, Haiyi Zhu, Robert E.

These efforts typically start with contrastive learning and gradually extend to the disentanglement of modal information, achieving solid multimodal discrete unified representations. However, existing research often overlooks two critical issues: 1) The use of Euclidean distance for quantization in discrete representations often overlooks the important distinctions among different dimensions of features, resulting in redundant representations after quantization; 2) Different modalities have unique characteristics, and a uniform alignment approach does not fully exploit these traits. To address these issues, we propose Training-free Optimization of Codebook (TOC) and Fine and Coarse cross-modal Information Disentangling (FCID). These methods refine the unified discrete representations from pretraining and perform fine- and coarse-grained information... | Hai Huang, Yan Xia, Shengpeng Ji, Shulei Wang, Hanting Wang, Minghui Fang, Jieming Zhu, Zhenhua Dong, Sashuai Zhou, Zhou Zhao |  |

In this work, we explore the following question: which properties of text domains do LLMs faithfully approximate, and how well do they do so? Applying observational approaches familiar from corpus linguistics, we prompt a commonly used, opensource LLM to regenerate text from two domains of permissively licensed English text which are often contained in LLM training data—Wikipedia and news text. This regeneration paradigm allows us to investigate whether LLMs can faithfully match the original human text domains in a fairly semantically-controlled setting. We investigate varying levels of syntactic abstraction, from more simple properties like sentence length, and article readability, to more complex and higher order properties such as dependency tag distribution, parse depth, and parse complexity.

This simplification can lead to the loss of essential inter-dependencies between rows, columns, and cells, while also posing scalability challenges for large tables. To address these issues, prior works have explored special tokens, structured embeddings, and sparse attention patterns. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of tabular encoding techniques used in QA, which highlights the crucial role of attention sparsity in preserving structural information of tables. We also introduce a set of novel sparse attention mask designs for tabular data, that not only enhance computational efficiency but also preserve structural integrity, leading to better overall performance. | Raphaël Mouravieff, Benjamin Piwowarski, Sylvain Lamprier |  |

The intuition behind this is that the programming languages (PLs) inherently exhibit greater structural organization than natural languages (NLs). This structural advantage makes PLs particularly suited for IE tasks. Nevertheless, existing research primarily focuses on Python for code-style simulation, overlooking the potential of other widely-used PLs (e.g., C++ and Java) during the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) phase. In this research, we propose Multiple Programming Languages with large language models for information extraction (abbreviated as MPL), a novel framework that explores the potential of incorporating different PLs in the SFT phase. Additionally, we introduce function-prompt with virtual running to simulate code-style inputs more effectively and efficiently. Experimental results on a wide range of datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MPL.... | Bo Li, Gexiang Fang, Wei Ye, Zhenghua Xu, Jinglei Zhang, Hao Cheng, Shikun Zhang |  |

Recent work explores iterative retrieval to address complex problems. However, the absence of intermediate guidance often leads to inaccurate retrieval and intermediate reasoning errors, leading to incorrect reasoning. To address these, we propose Self-Critique Guided Iterative Reasoning (SiGIR), which uses self-critique feedback to guide the iterative reasoning process. Specifically, through end-to-end training, we enable the model to iteratively address complex problems via question decomposition, while also being able to self-evaluate its intermediate reasoning steps. During iterative reasoning, the model engages in branching exploration and employs self-evaluation to guide the selection of promising reasoning trajectories. Extensive experiments on three multi-hop reasoning datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our... | Zheng Chu, Huiming Fan, Jingchang Chen, Qianyu Wang, Mingda Yang, Jiafeng Liang, Zhongjie Wang, Hao Li, Guo Tang, Ming Liu, Bing Qin |  |

However, these models exhibit a positional bias, particularly an even worse “anchored bias” in the GPT-2 family, where they consistently favour the first choice ‘A’ in MCQs during inference. This anchored bias challenges the integrity of GPT-2’s decision-making process, as it skews performance based on the position rather than the content of the choices in MCQs. In this study, we utilise the mechanistic interpretability approach to identify the internal modules within GPT-2 models responsible for this bias. We focus on the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layers and attention heads, using the “logit lens” method to trace and modify the specific value vectors that contribute to the bias. By updating these vectors within MLP and recalibrating attention patterns to neutralise the preference for the first choice ‘A’, we... | Ruizhe Li, Yanjun Gao |  |

In this paper, we first show that GEC models struggle to generalize beyond the specific types of errors encountered during training, limiting their ability to correct new, unseen errors at test time, particularly in out-of-domain (OOD) scenarios. This phenomenon amplifies with named entities (NEs), where, in addition to insufficient contextual information or knowledge about the NEs, novel NEs keep emerging. To address these issues, we propose DARAG (Data- and Retrieval-Augmented Generative Error Correction), a novel approach designed to improve GEC for ASR in in-domain (ID) and OOD scenarios. First, we augment the GEC training dataset with synthetic data generated using foundational generative models, thereby simulating additional errors from which the model can learn from. For out-of-domain scenarios, we simulate test-time errors... | Sreyan Ghosh, Mohammad Sadegh Rasooli, Michael Levit, Peidong Wang, Jian Xue, Dinesh Manocha, Jinyu Li |  |

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promise in natural language (NL) reasoning, especially with techniques like chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. Neuro-symbolic methods like Logic-LM and LINC further enhance performance on challenging datasets FOLIO and AR-LSAT by integrating formalization with LLMs and symbolic solvers, and possibly refinement with LLMs. However, these methods still struggle with the accurate formalization of complex NL problems.In this paper, we introduce LTRAG, a framework to enhance autoformalization and self-refinement for logical reasoning with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), by building knowledge bases of thought-guided examples (https://github.com/sysulic/LTRAG ).Experimental results on FOLIO and AR-LSAT show that LTRAG consistently outperforms Logic-LM and LINC across different models. On GPT-4 and AR-LSAT, it achieves an accuracy gain of 13% over Logic-LM. | Ruikang Hu, Shaoyu Lin, Yeliang Xiu, Yongmei Liu |  |

Since most SSL-based downstream tasks prioritize content information in speech, ideal representations should disentangle content from unwanted variations like speaker characteristics in the SSL representations. However, removing speaker information often degrades other speech components, and existing methods either fail to fully disentangle speaker identity or require resource-intensive models. In this paper, we propose a novel disentanglement method that linearly decomposes SSL representations into speaker-specific and speaker-independent components, effectively generating speaker disentangled representations. Comprehensive experiments show that our approach achieves speaker independence and as such, when applied to content-driven tasks such as voice conversion, our representations yield significant improvements over... | Giuseppe Ruggiero, Matteo Testa, Jurgen Van de Walle, Luigi Di Caro |  |

To this end, we propose leveraging code as supervision for cross-modal alignment, since code inherently encodes all information needed to generate corresponding figures, establishing a precise connection between the two modalities. Specifically, we co-develop our image-to-code model and dataset with model-in-the-loop approach, resulting in an image-to-code model, FigCodifier and ImgCode-8.6M dataset, the largest image-code dataset to date. Furthermore, we utilize FigCodifier to synthesize novel mathematical figures and then construct MM-MathInstruct-3M, a high-quality multimodal math instruction fine-tuning dataset.

Therefore, confidence estimations indicating the extent of trustworthiness of the generations become essential. However, current LLM confidence estimations in languages other than English remain underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a comprehensive investigation of Multilingual Confidence estimation (MlingConf) on LLMs, focusing on both language-agnostic (LA) and language-specific (LS) tasks to explore the performance and language dominance effects of multilingual confidence estimations on different tasks. The benchmark comprises four meticulously checked and human-evaluated high-quality multilingual datasets for LA tasks and one for the LS task tailored to specific social, cultural, and geographical contexts of a language.

Current benchmarks primarily use multi-hop question answering to assess and analyze newly injected or updated knowledge. However, we argue that these benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate how well the updated models apply this knowledge in real-life scenarios, particularly when questions require complex reasoning involving one-to-many relationships or multi-step logical intersections. To fill in this gap, we introduce a new benchmark, COMPKE: Complex Question Answering under Knowledge Editing, which includes 11,924 complex questions that reflect real-life situations. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of four different knowledge editing methods in COMPKE, and our results show that the performance of these methods varies between different models. For example, MeLLo achieves an accuracy of 39.47 on GPT-4o-mini but drops significantly to 3.83 on Qwen2.5-3B.

However, solving reasoning tasks often requires an LLM to generate long sequences, incurring O(N) time and memory complexities per token, where N is the current sequence length. To reduce complexities, existing sparsity-based algorithms propose to retain Key-Value (KV) vectors, the intermediate representations of only the most critical tokens. However, these algorithms struggle with the “impossible trinity” of accuracy, time, and memory. For example, the state-of-the-art algorithm, Quest, achieves high accuracy with O(L) time but O(N) memory (L is the cache budget, L ≪ N). To address the “impossible trinity”, in this paper, we identify a new attention pattern during the decode stage of reasoning tasks, where milestone tokens (analogous to lemmas in mathematical proofs) emerge, are utilized, and then... | Junhao Hu, Wenrui Huang, Weidong Wang, Zhenwen Li, Tiancheng Hu, Zhixia Liu, Xusheng Chen, Tao Xie, Yizhou Shan |  |

Although these methods have demonstrated satisfactory performance in handling a single user’s compression request, their processing time increases linearly with the number of requests, making them inefficient for real-world scenarios with multiple simultaneous requests. To address this limitation, we propose a Univeral Model for Customized Compression (UniCuCo) for LLMs, which introduces a StratNet that learns to map arbitrary requests to their optimal pruning strategy. The challenge in training StratNet lies in the high computational cost of evaluating pruning strategies and the non-differentiable nature of the pruning process, which hinders gradient backpropagation for StratNet updates. To overcome these challenges, we leverage a Gaussian process to approximate the evaluation process. Since the gradient of the Gaussian process is computable, we can... | Rongguang Ye, Ming Tang |  |

Using contrastive learning, it aligns all major music modalities–including sheet music, performance signals, and audio recordings–with multilingual text in a shared representation space, enabling retrieval across unaligned modalities with text as a bridge. It features a multilingual text encoder adaptable to unseen languages, exhibiting strong cross-lingual generalization. Leveraging retrieval-augmented generation, we curated M4-RAG, a web-scale dataset consisting of 2.31 million music-text pairs. This dataset is enriched with detailed metadata that represents a wide array of global musical traditions. To advance future research, we release WikiMT-X, a benchmark comprising 1,000 triplets of sheet music, audio, and richly varied text descriptions.

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in dialogue and reasoning, they still struggle to solve these strictly constrained dialogue tasks. To address this challenge, we construct Process Flow Dialogue (PFDial) dataset, which contains 12,705 high-quality Chinese dialogue instructions derived from 440 flowcharts containing 5,055 process nodes. Based on PlantUML specification, each UML flowchart is converted into atomic dialogue units i.e., structured five-tuples. Experimental results demonstrate that a 7B model trained with merely 800 samples, and a 0.5B model trained on total data both can surpass 90% accuracy. Additionally, the 8B model can surpass GPT-4o up to 43.88% with an average of 11.00%.

Previous efforts typically relied on an idealized assumption — patients can accurately report symptoms aligned with their actual health conditions. However, in reality, patients often misreport their symptoms, due to cognitive limitations, emotional factors, etc. Overlooking patient misreports can significantly compromise the diagnostic accuracy of MDSs. To address this critical issue, we emphasize the importance of enabling MDSs to “listen to patients” by tackling two key challenges: how to detect misreport and mitigate misreport effectively. In this work, we propose PaMis, a novel framework that can detect patient misreports based on calculating the structural entropy of the dialogue entity graph, and mitigate them through generating controlled clarifying questions. Our experimental results demonstrate that PaMis effectively enhances MDSs reliability... | Lang Qin, Yao Zhang, Hongru Liang, Adam Jatowt, Zhenglu Yang |  |

Investigations with the N-Back Paradigm](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.136/) |  | 0 | Cognitive tasks originally developed for humans are now increasingly used to study language models. While applying these tasks is often straightforward, interpreting their results can be challenging. In particular, when a model underperforms, it is often unclear whether this results from a limitation in the cognitive ability being tested or a failure to understand the task itself. A recent study argues that GPT 3.5’s declining performance on 2-back and 3-back tasks reflects a working memory capacity limit similar to humans (Gong et al., 2024). By analyzing a range of open-source language models of varying performance levels on these tasks, we show that the poor performance is due at least in part to a limitation in task comprehension and task set maintenance. We challenge the best-performing model with progressively harder versions of the task (up to 10-back) and experiment with alternative prompting strategies, before analyzing model attentions. Our larger aim is to contribute to the... | Xiaoyang Hu, Richard L. Lewis |  |

However, due to the feature divergence of an attribute (resp. object) when combined with different objects (resp. attributes), it is challenging to learn disentangled primitive features that are general across different compositions. To this end, we propose the solution of cross-composition feature disentanglement, which takes multiple primitive-sharing compositions as inputs and constrains the disentangled primitive features to be general across these compositions. More specifically, we leverage a compositional graph to define the overall primitive-sharing relationships between compositions, and build a task-specific architecture upon the recently successful large pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) CLIP, with dual cross-composition disentangling adapters (called L-Adapter and V-Adapter) inserted into CLIP’s frozen text and... | Yuxia Geng, Runkai Zhu, Jiaoyan Chen, Jintai Chen, Xiang Chen, Zhuo Chen, Shuofei Qiao, Yuxiang Wang, Xiaoliang Xu, ShengJun Huang |  |

To mitigate this issue, we propose __Sequential Chunk-wise Optimization (SeCO)__, a memory-efficient training paradigm that partitions lengthy inputs into manageable chunks. Each chunk independently constructs its computational graph and performs localized backpropagation, ensuring that only one chunk’s forward activations are stored in memory. Building on SeCO, we further introduce __Sparse Chunk-wise Optimization (SpaCO)__, which reduces computational overhead by selectively propagating gradients to specific chunks and incorporates a carefully designed compensation factor to ensure unbiased gradient estimation. SpaCO decouples the computational cost of backpropagation from the context length, enabling training time to gradually converge to inference time as sequences become longer.

Despite its successes, the substantial parameter redundancy, which limits the capacity and efficiency of LoRA, has been recognized as a bottleneck. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of redundancy in fine-tuning LoRA and reveal that reducing density redundancy does not degrade expressiveness. Based on this insight, we introduce Spectral-encoding Low-Rank Adaptation (SeLoRA), which harnesses the robust expressiveness of spectral bases to re-parameterize LoRA from a sparse spectral subspace. Designed with simplicity, SeLoRA enables seamless integration with various LoRA variants for performance boosting, serving as a scalable plug-and-play framework.

In this work, we propose a novel benchmark, : Code Migration Across Environment, designed to evaluate LLMs’ performance in handling code migration tasks. The benchmark comprises 922 data points across 19 Python and Java packages, offering three tasks to systematically evaluate code migration: identifying version-incompatible functions, determining function changes, and adapting code to target environments. Experimental evaluation of across seven LLMs revealed an average pass@1 rate of 26.50%, with GPT-4o performing best at 43.84%. We highlight our key findings as follows: (i) LLMs are more familiar with newer function versions, making them better at migrating legacy code, and (ii) a logical inconsistency where LLMs sometimes identify... | Keyuan Cheng, Xudong Shen, Yihao Yang, TengyueWang TengyueWang, Yang Cao, Muhammad Asif Ali, Hanbin Wang, Lijie Hu, Di Wang |  |

In this study, we focus on natural language understanding in three classical languages—Sanskrit, Ancient Greek and Latin—to investigate the factors affecting cross-lingual zero-shot generalization. First, we explore named entity recognition and machine translation into English. While LLMs perform equal to or better than fine-tuned baselines on out-of-domain data, smaller models often struggle, especially with niche or abstract entity types. In addition, we concentrate on Sanskrit by presenting a factoid question–answering (QA) dataset and show that incorporating context via retrieval-augmented generation approach significantly boosts performance. In contrast, we observe pronounced performance drops for smaller LLMs across these QA tasks. These results suggest model scale as an important factor influencing cross-lingual generalization.

To overcome these challenges, we propose BrainECHO (Brain signal decoding via vEctor-quantized speCtrogram reconstruction for WHisper-enhanced text generatiOn), a multi-stage framework that employs decoupled representation learning to achieve state-of-the-art performance on both EEG and MEG datasets. Specifically, BrainECHO consists of three stages: (1) Discrete autoencoding, which transforms continuous Mel spectrograms into a finite set of high-quality discrete representations for subsequent stages.

However, MCIT faces challenges in mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting (CF) and enhancing Knowledge Transfer (KT). Existing works combine Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) and LoRA to address these. However, using a fixed number of shared LoRA blocks across tasks can lead to the overwriting of acquired knowledge, making MLLMs harder to handle CF and KT. Therefore, we propose the \*\*Prog\*\*ressive \*\*LoRA\*\* framework (ProgLoRA), which contains a progressive LoRA pool and trains a new LoRA block for each incremental task to reduce knowledge interference. Specifically, ProgLoRA has two key mechanisms: task-aware allocation for effectively leveraging acquired knowledge at current task and task recall for realigning the model with learned tasks.

Although some researchers have quietly shifted to a more appropriate scheme over the last year, the implications of this change have yet to be widely acknowledged. We highlight this overlooked shift, show how similar evaluation practices falsely imply reasoning deficits in other benchmarks, and demonstrate that fairer methods dramatically reduce performance gaps (e.g. on SIQA) and even yield superhuman results (OpenBookQA). In doing so, we reveal how evaluation shapes perceived difficulty and offer guidelines to ensure that multiple-choice evaluations accurately reflect actual model capabilities. | Lukasz Borchmann |  |

Prior work has shown that finetuning on specialized datasets can mitigate this behavior, and doing so in English can transfer to other languages. In this work, we investigate the impact of different finetuning methods on the model’s bias and toxicity, but also on its ability to produce fluent and diverse text. We reduce biases by finetuning on curated non-harmful text, but find only direct preference optimization to be effective for mitigating toxicity. The mitigation caused by applying these methods in English also transfers to non-English languages. We find evidence that the extent to which transfer takes place can be predicted by the amount of data in a given language present in the model’s pretraining data. However, this transfer of bias and toxicity mitigation often comes at... | Vera Neplenbroek, Arianna Bisazza, Raquel Fernández |  |

A programming language, called RASP, has been proposed, which can be directly compiled into transformer weights to implement these algorithms. However, the tasks that can be implemented in RASP are often uncommon to learn from natural unsupervised data, showing a mismatch between theoretical capabilities of the transformer architecture, and the practical learnability of these capabilities from unsupervised data. We propose tracr-injection, a method that allows us to distill algorithms written in RASP directly into a pre-trained language model. We showcase our method by injecting 3 different algorithms into a language model. We show how our method creates an interpretable subspace within the model’s residual stream, which can be decoded into the variables present in the code of the RASP algorithm. Additionally, we found that... | Tomás Vergara Browne, Alvaro Soto |  |

Automated prompt optimization techniques address this challenge but the major of them rely on randomly selected evaluation subsets, which fail to represent the full dataset, leading to unreliable evaluations and suboptimal prompts. Existing coreset selection methods, designed for LLM benchmarking, are unsuitable for prompt optimization due to challenges in clustering similar samples, high data collection costs, and the unavailability of performance data for new or private datasets. To overcome these issues, we propose IPOMP, an Iterative evaluation data selection approach for effective Prompt Optimization using real time Model Performance. IPOMP is a two-stage approach that selects representative and diverse samples using semantic clustering and boundary analysis, followed by iterative refinement with real-time model performance data... | Ximing Dong, Shaowei Wang, Dayi Lin, Ahmed E.

Weak-to-strong generalization offers a promising approach by leveraging predictions from weaker models to guide stronger systems, but its effectiveness could be constrained by the inherent noise and inaccuracies in these weak predictions. To address this, we propose a theoretically grounded approach that replaces forward KL divergence—whose mass-covering behavior risks overfitting to imperfect weak signals—with reverse KL divergence. Reverse KL divergence’s zero-forcing effect prioritizes high-confidence predictions, effectively mitigating the influence of unreliable weak supervision. Theoretically, we extend existing bounds and derive tighter lower bounds for both forward and reverse KL divergence. Notably, when a sufficiently pre-trained strong model is fine-tuned on the last linear layer, reverse KL guarantees that it outperforms its... | Wei Yao, Wenkai Yang, Ziqiao Wang, Yankai Lin, Yong Liu |  |

We show that shifts in semantic embedding space can be causally linked to real-world market shocks or deviations from the expected market behaviour (sec:market_shocks). Furthermore, we show how partisanship can influence the predictive power of text for market fluctuations and shape reactions to those same shocks. We also provide some evidence that text-based signals are particularly salient during rare events such as COVID-19, highlighting the value of language data as an exogenous variable in economic forecasting. Our findings underscore the bidirectional relationship between news outlets and market shocks, offering a novel empirical approach to studying their effect on each other. | Felix Drinkall, Stefan Zohren, Michael McMahon, Janet B.

However, safeguarding these systems from malicious queries receives relatively little attention, while methods for single-agent safety are challenging to transfer. In this paper, we explore MAS safety from a topological perspective, aiming at identifying structural properties that enhance security. To this end, we propose NetSafe framework, unifying diverse MAS workflows via iterative RelCom interactions to enable generalized analysis. We identify several critical phenomena for MAS under attacks (misinformation, bias, and harmful content), termed as Agent Hallucination, Aggregation Safety and Security Bottleneck. Furthermore, we verify that highly connected and larger systems are more vulnerable to adversarial spread, with task performance in a Star Graph Topology decreasing by 29.7%.

In this paper, we introduce \*\*COVER\*\* (\*\*CO\*\*unterfactual \*\*V\*\*id\*\*E\*\*o \*\*R\*\*easoning), a multidimensional multimodal benchmark that systematically evaluates MLLMs across the abstract-concrete and perception-cognition dimensions. Beyond prior multimodal benchmarks, COVER decomposes complex queries into structured sub-questions, enabling fine-grained reasoning analysis. Experiments on commercial and open-source models reveal a strong correlation between sub-question accuracy and counterfactual reasoning performance, highlighting the role of structured inference in video understanding. Furthermore, our results suggest a key insight: enhancing the reasoning capability of models is essential for improving the robustness of video understanding.

Considering the high cost of fine-tuning language models, model editing methods with low cost are usually required to manipulate models’ knowledge. The evidence suggests that modules carrying knowledge in a Transformer module are primarily the MLP blocks, thus we propose iReVa, a method that explicitly initializes and retrofits key-value pairs into MLP blocks to construct a new mapping of a piece of knowledge without damaging the irrelevant knowledge. In comparison to existing methods, iReVa reveals better interpretability and a stronger capacity for carrying traceable edits. Experiment results on a series of GPT series models show our prominent performance on edit success and generalization without influencing specificity.

While instructing LLMs to acknowledge knowledge limitations by responding with “I don’t know” appears promising, we find that models consistently struggle with admitting knowledge gaps. This challenge may originate from current instruction datasets that emphasise answer generation over knowledge boundary awareness. To address this limitation, we introduce \*\*U\*\*ncertainty-and-\*\*S\*\*ensitivity-Aware Tuning \*\*(US-Tuning)\*\*, a novel two-stage approach for contextual question answering (QA). The first stage enhances LLMs’ ability to recognise their knowledge boundaries, while the second stage reinforces instruction adherence through carefully designed causal prompts.

Unlike traditional model compression, which needs retraining, recent dynamic computation methods show that not all components are required for inference, enabling a training-free pipeline.In this paper, we focus on the dynamic depth of LLM generation. A token-position aware layer skipping framework is proposed to save 1.5x times operations efficiently while maintaining performance.We first observed that tokens predicted later have lower perplexity and thus require less computation. Then, we propose a training-free algorithm called Position-Aware Depth Decay Decoding (), which leverages a power-law decay function, \left\lfloor L × (𝛼i) \right\rfloor, to determine the number of layers to retain when generating token Ti. Remarkably, without any retraining, the achieves success across a wide range of generation tasks for the first time.Experiments on large language models (the... | Siqi Fan, Xuezhi Fang, Xingrun Xing, Peng Han, Shuo Shang, Yequan Wang |  |

Solving complex puzzles, such as Sudoku, offers a canonical example of this collaboration, where clear and customized explanations often hold greater importance than the final solution. In this study, we evaluate the performance of five LLMs in solving and explaining 6x6 Sudoku puzzles. While one LLM demonstrates limited success in solving puzzles, none can explain the solution process in a manner that reflects strategic reasoning or intuitive problem-solving. These findings underscore significant challenges that must be addressed before LLMs can become effective partners in human-AI collaborative decision-making. | Anirudh Maiya, Razan Alghamdi, Maria Leonor Pacheco, Ashutosh Trivedi, Fabio Somenzi |  |

Moreover, detecting Machine-Generated Text (MGT) remains challenging due to the lack of robust benchmarks that assess generalization to real-world scenarios. In this work, we evaluate the resilience of state-of-the-art MGT detectors (e.g., Mage, Radar, LLM-DetectAIve) to linguistically informed adversarial attacks. We develop a pipeline that fine-tunes language models using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to shift the MGT style toward human-written text (HWT), obtaining generations more challenging to detect by current models. Additionally, we analyze the linguistic shifts induced by the alignment and how detectors rely on “linguistic shortcuts” to detect texts. Our results show that detectors can be easily fooled with relatively few examples,... | Andrea Pedrotti, Michele Papucci, Cristiano Ciaccio, Alessio Miaschi, Giovanni Puccetti, Felice Dell'Orletta, Andrea Esuli |  |

Most prior works assume pre-segmented speech, limiting their real-world applicability. In this paper, we propose InfiniSST, a novel approach that formulates SST as a multi-turn dialogue task, enabling seamless translation of unbounded speech. We construct translation trajectories and robust segments from MuST-C with multi-latency augmentation during training and develop a key-value (KV) cache management strategy to facilitate efficient inference. Experiments on MuST-C En-Es, En-De, and En-Zh demonstrate that InfiniSST reduces computation-aware latency by 0.5 to 1 second while maintaining the same translation quality compared to baselines. Ablation studies further validate the contributions of our data construction and cache... | Siqi Ouyang, Xi Xu, Lei Li |  |

However, existing methods have primarily focused on model undersafety, where the model responds to hazardous queries, while neglecting oversafety, where the model refuses to answer safe queries. In this paper, we introduce the concept of safety calibration, which systematically addresses both undersafety and oversafety. Specifically, we present VSCBench, a novel dataset of 3,600 image-text pairs that are visually or textually similar but differ in terms of safety, which is designed to evaluate safety calibration across image-centric and text-centric scenarios. Based on our benchmark, we evaluate safety calibration across eleven widely used VLMs. Our extensive experiments revealed major issues with both undersafety and oversafety. We further investigated four approaches to improve the model’s safety calibration. We found that even though some methods effectively calibrated... | Jiahui Geng, Qing Li, Zongxiong Chen, Yuxia Wang, Derui Zhu, Zhuohan Xie, Chenyang Lyu, Xiuying Chen, Preslav Nakov, Fakhri Karray |  |

Adaptive Tool Integration for Math Language Models via Expectation-Maximization](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.159/) |  | 0 | Recent advances in mathematical problem-solving with language models (LMs) integrate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and code execution to harness their complementary strengths. However, existing hybrid frameworks exhibit a critical limitation: they depend on externally dictated instructions or rigid code-integration templates, lacking metacognitive awareness—the capacity to dynamically evaluate intrinsic capabilities and autonomously determine when and how to integrate tools. This rigidity motivates our study of autonomous code integration, enabling models to adapt tool-usage strategies as their reasoning abilities evolve during training.While reinforcement learning (RL) shows promise for boosting LLM reasoning at scale (e.g., DeepSeek-R1), we demonstrate its inefficiency in learning autonomous code integration due to inadequate exploration of the vast combinatorial space of CoT-code interleaving patterns. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Expectation-Maximization (EM)... | Haozhe Wang, Long Li, Chao Qu, Weidi Xu, Fengming Zhu, Wei Chu, Fangzhen Lin |  |

In this work, we introduce GoodLiar, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework that generates deceptive contexts to systematically rewrite an LLM’s core logical or philosophical understandings. By incentivizing an RL agent to produce persuasive and coherent arguments, GoodLiar aims to induce persistent belief shifts, rather than merely influencing immediate judgments of factual truthfulness. %rather than one-off policy breaches. Our approach introduces DA-ILQL, a novel offline RL method that extends ILQL by integrating on-policy data and language exploration to enhance the language discovery and optimization.

However, factual errors in the responses would undermine their reliability. Despite growing attention to LLM factuality, the effect of response length on factuality remains underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate this relationship by first introducing an automatic and bi-level long-form factuality evaluation framework, which achieves high agreement with human annotations while being cost-effective. Using this framework, we conduct controlled experiments and find that longer responses exhibit lower factual precision, confirming the presence of length bias. To explain this phenomenon, we empirically examine three hypotheses: error propagation, long context, and facts exhaustion. Our results reveal that facts exhaustion, where the model gradually exhausts more reliable knowledge, is the primary cause of factual degradation, rather than the other two hypotheses. | James Xu Zhao, Jimmy Z.

While this social reasoning capability emerges naturally in human cognitive development, how has the social reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) evolved during their development process? Various datasets have been proposed to assess LLMs’ social reasoning capabilities, but each is designed with a distinct focus, and none have explored how models’ social reasoning capabilities evolve during model size scaling or reasoning tokens scaling. In light of this, we optimize the evaluation of LLMs’ social reasoning from both data and model perspectives, constructing progressively difficult levels of social reasoning data and systematically exploring how LLMs’ social reasoning capabilities evolve. Furthermore, through an in-depth analysis of DeepSeek-R1’s reasoning trajectories, we identify notable cognitive “Aha Moment” and the... | Guiyang Hou, Wenqi Zhang, Zhe Zheng, Yongliang Shen, Weiming Lu |  |

To eliminate their hallucinations, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful approach, leveraging external knowledge sources like knowledge graphs (KGs). In this paper, we study the task of KG-driven RAG and propose a novel Similar Graph Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (SimGRAG) method. It effectively addresses the challenge of aligning query texts and KG structures through a two-stage process: (1) query-to-pattern, which uses an LLM to transform queries into a desired graph pattern, and (2) pattern-to-subgraph, which quantifies the alignment between the pattern and candidate subgraphs using a graph semantic distance (GSD) metric. We also develop an optimized retrieval algorithm that efficiently identifies the top-k subgraphs within 1-second on a 10-million-scale KG. Extensive experiments show that SimGRAG outperforms state-of-the-art KG-driven RAG... | Yuzheng Cai, Zhenyue Guo, Yiwen Pei, Wanrui Bian, Weiguo Zheng |  |

However, existing methods mainly focus on instance-level editing, which is prone to over-editing risk featuring knowledge degradation and general ability deterioration, due to redundant instance-specific modifications for knowledge. To mitigate the over-editing risk, we explore the rule-level editing problem that avoids case-by-case modification by generalizing rule-level knowledge to update rule-derived instances. We further construct a benchmark called RuleEdit for systematic evaluation on rule-level editing. Moreover, we propose a Rule-Transfer Editing (RTE) method to facilitate effective updates and generalizations of rule-level knowledge in LLMs. Experimental results highlight our significant improvements, with the enhancements of 28.1% in... | Bihan Zhou, Haopeng Ren, Li Yuan, Yi Cai, Liuwen Cao, Zikun Deng |  |

With their expanded context windows, LCLMs can process entire knowledge bases and perform retrieval and reasoning directly – a capability we define as In-Context Retrieval and Reasoning (ICR^2). However, existing benchmarks like LOFT often overestimate LCLM performance by providing overly simplified contexts. To address this, we introduce ICR^2, a benchmark that evaluates LCLMs in more realistic scenarios by including confounding passages retrieved with strong retrievers. We then propose three methods to enhance LCLM performance: (1) retrieve-then-generate fine-tuning, (2) retrieval-attention-probing, which uses attention heads to filter and de-noise long contexts during decoding, and (3) joint retrieval head training alongside the generation head. Our evaluation of five well-known LCLMs on LOFT and ICR^2 demonstrates significant gains with... | Yifu Qiu, Varun R. Embar, Yizhe Zhang, Navdeep Jaitly, Shay B. Cohen, Benjamin Han |  |

The common approach involves using a bi-encoder to compute the semantic similarity between a query and documents. However, the scalar similarity often fail to reflect enough information, hindering the interpretation of retrieval results. In addition, this process primarily focuses on global semantics, overlooking the finer-grained semantic relationships between the query and the document’s content. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, Generation Augmented Retrieval (GeAR), which not only improves the global document-query similarity through contrastive learning, but also integrates well-designed fusion and decoding modules. This enables GeAR to generate relevant context within the documents based on a given query, facilitating learning to retrieve local fine-grained information.Furthermore, when used as a retriever, GeAR does not incur any additional computational cost over bi-encoders.... | Haoyu Liu, Shaohan Huang, Jianfeng Liu, Yuefeng Zhan, Hao Sun, Weiwei Deng, Feng Sun, Furu Wei, Qi Zhang |  |

Previous studies view them as three separate tasks. Therefore, their proposed techniques usually work for one specific task only, lacking generalizability and a holistic perspective. In this paper, we aim at a unified solution to the three tasks. To be specific, we identify two common skills needed for entity set expansion, taxonomy expansion, and seed-guided taxonomy construction: finding “siblings” and finding “parents”. We propose a taxonomy-guided instruction tuning framework to teach a large language model to generate siblings and parents for query entities, where the joint pre-training process facilitates the mutual enhancement of the two skills. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed TaxoInstruct framework, which outperforms... | Yanzhen Shen, Yu Zhang, Yunyi Zhang, Jiawei Han |  |

With the increasing number of online debates among social media users, conversational stance detection has become a crucial research area. However, existing conversational stance detection datasets are restricted to a limited set of specific targets, which constrains the effectiveness of stance detection models when encountering a large number of unseen targets in real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we manually curate a large-scale, high-quality zero-shot conversational stance detection dataset, named ZS-CSD, comprising 280 targets across two distinct target types. Leveraging the ZS-CSD dataset, we propose SITPCL, a speaker interaction and target-aware prototypical contrastive learning model, and establish the benchmark performance in the zero-shot setting. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SITPCL model achieves... | Yuzhe Ding, Kang He, Bobo Li, Li Zheng, Haijun He, Fei Li, Chong Teng, Donghong Ji |  |

These challenges are often exacerbated by misinformation caused by lack of verification, reasoning without attribution, and potential knowledge conflicts. We propose LongFaith, a novel pipeline for synthesizing faithful long-context reasoning instruction datasets. By integrating ground truth and citation-based reasoning prompts, we eliminate distractions and improve the accuracy of reasoning chains, thus mitigating the need for costly verification processes. We open-source two synthesized datasets—LongFaith-SFT and LongFaith-PO—which systematically address multiple dimensions of faithfulness, including verified reasoning, attribution, and contextual grounding.

While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in this area, they continue to struggle with domain-specific knowledge. Synthetic data generation has emerged as an effective solution to this challenge. However, existing methods are often either inefficient to scale across multiple domains or overly reliant on external documents. We introduce SYNTHVERIFY, a novel step-by-step prompting-based synthetic data generation framework designed to enhance zero-shot claim verification. Our core insight is that guiding generation with domain-specific claim patterns and structured evidence plans can bridge LLMs’ knowledge gaps in specialized domains without requiring access to external corpora or sacrificing generalizability. Using SYNTHVERIFY, we construct a diverse synthetic dataset for zero-shot verification, enabling... | Rongwen Zhao, Jeffrey Flanigan |  |

However, current LLMs for high-stakes domain tasks, such as financial investment and legal QA, typically generate brief answers without reasoning processes and explanations. This limits users’ confidence in making decisions based on their responses. While original CoT shows promise, it lacks self-correction mechanisms during reasoning. This work introduces Domaino1s, which enhances LLMs’ reasoning capabilities on domain tasks through supervised fine-tuning and tree search. We construct CoT-stock-2k and CoT-legal-2k datasets for fine-tuning models that activate domain-specific reasoning steps based on their judgment. Additionally, we propose Selective Tree Exploration to spontaneously explore solution spaces and sample optimal reasoning paths to improve performance. We also introduce PROOF-Score, a new metric for evaluating domain models’ explainability, complementing traditional accuracy metrics with richer... | Xu Chu, Zhijie Tan, Hanlin Xue, Guanyu Wang, Tong Mo, Weiping Li |  |

However, conventional sequence labeling approaches to INER often suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, which leads to the degradation of the model’s performance on previously encountered entity types. In this paper, we formalize INER as a unified seq2seq generation task and propose a parameter-efficient dynamic prefix method. By employing the dynamic prefix as a task instructor to guide the generative model, our approach can preserve task-invariant knowledge while adapting to new entities with minimal parameter updates, making it particularly effective in low-resource scenarios. Additionally, we introduce a generative label augmentation strategy with dual optimization objectives including a self-entropy loss and a task-aware similarity loss to enable optimal balance between... | Zihao Wu, YongXiang Hua, Yongxin Zhu, Fang Zhang, Linli Xu |  |

Tracing Teachers in Model Distillation](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.173/) |  | 0 | Model distillation – using outputs from a large teacher model to teach a small student model – is a practical means of creating efficient models for a particular task. We ask: Can we identify a students’ teacher based on its outputs? Such “footprints” left by teacher LLMs would be interesting artifacts. Beyond this, reliable teacher inference may have practical implications as actors seek to distill specific capabilities of massive proprietary LLMs into deployed smaller LMs, potentially violating terms of service. We consider practical task distillation targets including summarization, question answering, and instruction-following. We assume a finite set of candidate teacher models, which we treat as blackboxes. We design discriminative models that operate over lexical features. We find that n-gram similarity alone is unreliable for identifying teachers, but part-of-speech (PoS) templates preferred by student models mimic those of their teachers. | Somin Wadhwa, Chantal Shaib, Silvio Amir, Byron C.

Multiple-choice (MC) evaluation mitigates this issue, but generating high-quality distractors is time-consuming and labor-intensive. We introduce D-GEN, the first open-source distractor generator model that transforms open-ended data into an MC format. To evaluate distractor quality, we propose two novel methods: 1) ranking alignment, ensuring generated distractors retain the discriminatory power of ground-truth distractors, and 2) entropy analysis, comparing model confidence distributions. Our results show that D-GEN preserves ranking consistency (Spearman’s 𝜌 0.99, Kendall’s 𝜏 0.94) and closely matches the entropy distribution of ground-truth distractors. Human evaluation further confirms the fluency, coherence, distractiveness, and incorrectness. Our work advances robust and efficient distractor generation with automated evaluation, setting a new standard for MC... | Grace Byun, Jinho D. Choi |  |

In this paper, we introduce HammerBench, a novel benchmark framework for assessing LLMs’ function-calling capabilities in real-world, multi-turn dialogues. HammerBench simulates diverse mobile assistant use cases, incorporating imperfect instructions, dynamic question-answer trajectories, intent and argument shifts, and the indirect use of external information through pronouns. To construct this benchmark, we curate a comprehensive dataset derived from popular mobile app functionalities and anonymized user logs, complemented by a cost-effective data generation pipeline leveraging open-source models. HammerBench is further augmented with fine-grained interaction snapshots and metrics, enabling detailed evaluation of function-calling performance across individual conversational turns.

It can greatly enhance task performance using a few examples, termed demonstrations, without fine-tuning. Although effective in question answering, ICL often underperforms in long-form generation tasks such as summarization. Under appropriately realistic assumptions, we empirically and theoretically show that ICL demonstrations alone are insufficient to teach LLMs the task’s language and format distributions for generation. We argue for explicit exposure to the task distributions and hypothesize that defining them by prompting enhances model performance. To this end, we present LongGuide, which efficiently generates two parallel streams of guidelines capturing task language and format properties: (i) Metric Guidelines (MGs) that instruct models to optimize self-evaluated metrics; and (ii) Output Constraint Guidelines (OCGs) that constrain generation at both token and... | Do Xuan Long, Duong Ngoc Yen, Do Xuan Trong, Anh Tuan Luu, Kenji Kawaguchi, Shafiq Joty, MinYen Kan, Nancy F.

However, their lack of a reliable control mechanism limits their effectiveness in applications that require strict adherence to predefined taxonomies, syntactic structures, or domain-specific rules. Existing approaches, such as fine-tuning and prompting, remain insufficient to ensure compliance with these requirements, particularly in low-resource scenarios and structured text generation tasks.To address these limitations, we introduce GRAMMAR-LLM, a novel framework that integrates formal grammatical constraints into the LLM decoding process. GRAMMAR-LLM enforces syntactic correctness in linear time while maintaining expressiveness in grammar rule definition. To achieve this, we define a class of grammars, called LL(prefix), – which we show to be equivalent to LL(1) – specifically designed for their use with LLMs. These grammars are expressive enough to support common tasks... | Gabriele Tuccio, Luana Bulla, Maria Madonia, Aldo Gangemi, Misael Mongiovì |  |

In response, we introduce MANBench (Multimodal Ability Norms Benchmark), a bilingual benchmark (English and Chinese) comprising 1,314 questions across nine tasks, spanning knowledge-based and non-knowledge-based domains. MANBench emphasizes intuitive reasoning, seamless cross-modal integration, and real-world complexity, providing a rigorous evaluation framework.Through extensive human experiments involving diverse participants, we compared human performance against state-of-the-art MLLMs. The results indicate that while MLLMs excel in tasks like Knowledge and Text-Image Understanding, they struggle with deeper cross-modal reasoning tasks such as Transmorphic Understanding, Image Consistency, and Multi-image Understanding. Moreover, both humans and MLLMs face challenges in highly complex tasks like Puzzles and Spatial... | Han Zhou, Qitong Xu, Yiheng Dong, Xin Yang |  |

In an effort to extend the focus of bias research beyond English-centric datasets, we have localized the content from the StereoSet, IndiBias, and kamruzzaman-etal’s datasets, producing a resource tailored to capture biases prevalent within the Bangla-speaking community. Our BanStereoSet dataset consists of 1,194 sentences spanning 9 categories of bias: race, profession, gender, ageism, beauty, beauty in profession, region, caste, and religion. This dataset not only serves as a crucial tool for measuring bias in multilingual LLMs but also facilitates the exploration of stereotypical bias across different social categories, potentially guiding the development of more equitable language technologies in \*Bangladeshi\* contexts. Our analysis of several language models using this dataset indicates significant biases, reinforcing the... | Mahammed Kamruzzaman, Abdullah Al Monsur, Shrabon Kumar Das, Enamul Hassan, Gene Louis Kim |  |

While most mLLMs are trained on caption-like data only, Alayrac et al. (2022) showed that additionally training them on interleaved sequences of text and images can lead to the emergence of in-context learning capabilities. However, the dataset they used, M3W, is not public and is only in English. There have been attempts to reproduce their results but the released datasets are English-only. In contrast, current multilingual and multimodal datasets are either composed of caption-like only or medium-scale or fully private data. This limits mLLM research for the 7,000 other languages spoken in the world. We therefore introduce mOSCAR, to the best of our knowledge the first large-scale multilingual and multimodal document corpus crawled from the web. It covers 163 languages, 303M documents, 200B tokens and 1.15B images.

NorEval consists of 24 high-quality human-created datasets – of which five are created from scratch. In contrast to existing benchmarks for Norwegian, NorEval covers a broad spectrum of task categories targeting Norwegian language understanding and generation, establishes human baselines, and focuses on both of the official written standards of the Norwegian language: Bokmål and Nynorsk. All our datasets and a collection of over 100 human-created prompts are integrated into LM Evaluation Harness, ensuring flexible and reproducible evaluation. We describe the NorEval design and present the results of benchmarking 19 open-source pretrained and instruction-tuned LMs for Norwegian in various scenarios. Our benchmark, evaluation framework, and annotation materials are publicly available. | Vladislav Mikhailov, Tita Ranveig Enstad, David Samuel, Hans Christian Farsethås, Andrey Kutuzov, Erik Velldal, Lilja Øvrelid |  |

In this work, we introduce MASSIE - a comprehensive collection for instruction-following multilingual IE that standardizes and unifies 215 manually annotated datasets, covering 96 typologically diverse languages from 18 language families. Based on MASSIE, we conduct empirical studies on few-shot in-context learning and report important factors that either positively or negatively affect LLMs’ performance in multilingual IE, covering 21 LLMs sizing from 0.5B to 72B. Additionally, we introduce LF1 - a structure-aware metric that captures partially matched spans, resolving the conservativeness of standard exact matching scheme which overpenalizes LLMs’ predictions. Overall, our results signify that multilingual IE remains very challenging for existing LLMs, especially on complex tasks involving relations and events. In addition,... | Thang Le, Huy Huu Nguyen, Anh Tuan Luu, Thien Huu Nguyen |  |

However, most approaches focus on aligning images and text at a coarse level, facing two critical challenges: cross-modal misalignment bias and intra-modal semantic divergence, which significantly degrade sentence representation quality. To address these challenges, we propose DALR (Dual-level Alignment Learning for Multimodal Sentence Representation). For cross-modal alignment, we propose a consistency learning module that softens negative samples and utilizes semantic similarity from an auxiliary task to achieve fine-grained cross-modal alignment. Additionally, we contend that sentence relationships go beyond binary positive-negative labels, exhibiting a more intricate ranking structure. To better capture these relationships and enhance representation quality, we integrate ranking distillation with global intra-modal alignment learning.

This survey provides a systematic review of recent advancements, focusing on genomic sequence modeling, RNA structure prediction, protein function inference, and single-cell transcriptomics. Meanwhile, we also discuss several key challenges, including data scarcity, computational complexity, and cross-omics integration, and explore future directions such as multimodal learning, hybrid AI models, and clinical applications. By offering a comprehensive perspective, this paper underscores the transformative potential of LLMs in driving innovations in bioinformatics and precision medicine. | Zhenyu Wang, Zikang Wang, Jiyue Jiang, Pengan Chen, Xiangyu Shi, Yu Li |  |

Evaluating MLLMs' Capability via Chart Editing](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.185/) |  | 0 | Although multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise in generating chart rendering code, editing charts via code presents a greater challenge. This task demands MLLMs to integrate chart understanding and reasoning capacities, which are labor-intensive. While many MLLMs claim such editing capabilities, current evaluations rely on limited case studies, highlighting the urgent need for a comprehensive evaluation framework.In this work, we propose ChartEdit, a new high-quality benchmark designed for chart editing tasks. This benchmark comprises 1,405 diverse editing instructions applied to 233 real-world charts, with each instruction-chart instance having been manually annotated and validated for accuracy. Utilizing ChartEdit, we evaluate the performance of 10 mainstream MLLMs across two types of experiments at both the code and chart levels.The results suggest that large-scale models can generate code to produce images that partially match the reference images.However, their... | Xuanle Zhao, Xuexin Liu, Haoyue Yang, Xianzhen Luo, Fanhu Zeng, Jianling Li, Qi Shi, Chi Chen |  |

We investigate this phenomenon, dubbed as “safety alignment degradation” in this paper, and show that the challenge arises from the representation gap that emerges when introducing vision modality to VLMs. In particular, we show that the representations of multi-modal inputs shift away from that of text-only inputs which represent the distribution that the LLM backbone is optimized for. At the same time, the safety alignment capabilities, initially developed within the textual embedding space, do not successfully transfer to this new multi-modal representation space. To reduce safety alignment degradation, we introduce Cross-Modality Representation Manipulation (CMRM), an inference time representation intervention method for recovering the safety alignment ability that is inherent in the LLM backbone of VLMs, while simultaneously... | Qin Liu, Chao Shang, Ling Liu, Nikolaos Pappas, Jie Ma, Neha Anna John, Srikanth Doss, Lluís Màrquez, Miguel Ballesteros, Yassine Benajiba |  |

The current web automation approaches take the current web state, history actions, and language instruction as inputs to predict the next action, overlooking the importance of history states. However, the highly verbose nature of web page states can result in long input sequence and sparse information, hampering the effective utilization of history states. In this paper, we propose a novel web history compressor approach to turbocharge web automation using history states. Our approach employs a history compressor module that distills the most task-relevant information from each history state into a fixed-length short representation, mitigating the challenges posed by the highly verbose history states. Experiments are conducted on the Mind2Web and WebLINX datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Results show that our approach obtains 1.2-5.4% absolute accuracy improvements compared to the baseline approach... | Xiyue Zhu, Peng Tang, Haofu Liao, Srikar Appalaraju |  |

Inevitably, the retrieved passages based on similarity search may be irrelevant to the given question, and the aggregation of these passages can confuse the model to give a correct answer. To improve the performance of RALM in such conditions, we propose layer-knowledge guided attention for RALMs, which harnesses the layer-wise knowledge of LLMs to optimize per-layer attention on useful passages, making the model pay attention to the most relevant content and ignore irrelevant ones. Specifically, we first systematically study LLM’s attention patterns and their relationship with the accuracy of RALM responses, where middle-focus attentions play a crucial role in selectively gathering relevant information. Based on this, a layer-wise passage estimator leverages the varied knowledge encoded... | Weijie Shi, Hao Chen, Jiaming Li, Yao Zhao, Yazhong Zhang, Qijin Chen, Jipeng Zhang, Ruiyuan Zhang, Jia Zhu, Jiajie Xu, Xiaofang Zhou |  |

Existing jailbreak methods create a forced instruction-following scenario, or search adversarial prompts with prefix or suffix tokens to achieve a specific representation manually or automatically. However, they suffer from low efficiency and explicit jailbreak patterns, far from the real deployment of mass attacks to LLMs. In this paper, we point out that simply rewriting the original instruction can achieve a jailbreak, and we find that this rewriting approach is learnable and transferable. We propose the \*\*R\*\*ewrite to \*\*J\*\*ailbreak (R2J) approach, a transferable black-box jailbreak method to attack LLMs by iteratively exploring the weakness of the LLMs and automatically improving the attacking strategy. The jailbreak is more efficient and hard to identify since no additional features are... | Yuting Huang, Chengyuan Liu, Yifeng Feng, Yiquan Wu, Chao Wu, Fei Wu, Kun Kuang |  |

Further, current approaches that try to address these limitations, frequently reduce sign language processing (SLP) to traditional translation tasks, neglecting the multimodal and linguistic complexity inherent in signed languages. In this paper, we present an empirical investigation informed by learning theory into natively integrating sign language support within LLMs, directly addressing the documented needs of DHH users. We introduce the first text-based and multimodal LLMs capable of sign language processing called SignAlignLM, and propose new prompting and fine-tuning strategies incorporating sign linguistic rules and conventions. We show that LLMs can be generalized interfaces for both spoken and signed languages if trained with a... | Mert Inan, Anthony Sicilia, Malihe Alikhani |  |

As vision language models (VLMs) continue to advance and are deployed in high-stakes applications, assessing their ability to comprehend negation becomes essential. To address this, we introduce NegVQA, a visual question answering (VQA) benchmark consisting of 7,379 two-choice questions covering diverse negation scenarios and image-question distributions. We construct NegVQA by leveraging large language models to generate negated versions of questions from existing VQA datasets. Evaluating 20 state-of-the-art VLMs across seven model families, we find that these models struggle significantly with negation, exhibiting a substantial performance drop compared to their responses to the original questions. Furthermore, we uncover a U-shaped scaling trend, where increasing model size initially degrades performance on NegVQA before leading to improvements. Our benchmark reveals critical gaps... | Yuhui Zhang, Yuchang Su, Yiming Liu, Serena YeungLevy |  |

Argumentative reasoning, a form of reasoning naturally expressed in language and central to everyday discourse, presents unique challenges for LLMs due to its reliance on context, implicit assumptions, and value judgments. This paper addresses a gap in the study of reasoning in LLMs by presenting the first large-scale evaluation of their unconstrained natural language reasoning capabilities based on natural language argumentation. The paper offers three contributions: (i) the formalisation of a new strategy designed to evaluate argumentative reasoning in LLMs: argument-component selection; (ii) the creation of the Argument Reasoning Tasks (ART) dataset, a new benchmark for argument-component selection based on argument... | Debela Gemechu, Ramon RuizDolz, Henrike Beyer, Chris Reed |  |

Recent LLM-powered toolkits, such as OpenAI Codex and Cursor, have offered end-to-end automation of the software development process. However, building effective SWE agents remains challenging due to the lack of high-quality training data and effective test cases. To address this issue, we present SWE-Dev, an SWE agent built upon open-source LLMs. First, we develop a robust pipeline to synthesize test cases for patch evaluation. Second, we scale up agent trajectories to construct the training data for building SWE-Dev. Experiments on the SWE-bench-Verified benchmark show that the SWE-Dev models can achieve top performance among all open SWE agents. Specifically, the success rates of the SWE-Dev 7B and 32B parameter models reach 23.4% and 36.6%, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art open-source models.

Many supervised and zero-shot detectors have already been proposed, yet their effectiveness and precision remain disputed. Current research therefore focuses on making detectors robust against domain shifts and on building corresponding benchmarks. In this paper, we show that the actual limitations hindering progress in LLM detection lie elsewhere: LLM detection is often implicitly modeled as an authorship attribution task, while its true nature is that of authorship verification. We systematically analyze the current research with respect to this misunderstanding, conduct an in-depth comparative analysis of the benchmarks, and validate our claim using state-of-the-art LLM detectors. Our contributions open the realm of authorship analysis technology for understanding and tackling the problem of LLM detection. | Janek Bevendorff, Matti Wiegmann, Emmelie Richter, Martin Potthast, Benno Stein |  |

However, the effectiveness of CoT reasoning is inconsistent across tasks with different reasoning types. This work presents a novel perspective to understand CoT behavior through the lens of confirmation bias in cognitive psychology. Specifically, we examine how model internal beliefs, approximated by direct question-answering probabilities, affect both reasoning generation (Q → R) and reasoning-guided answer prediction (QR → A) in CoT. By decomposing CoT into a two-stage process, we conduct a thorough correlation analysis in model beliefs, rationale attributes, and stage-wise performance. Our results provide strong evidence of confirmation bias in LLMs, such that model beliefs not only skew the reasoning process but also influence how rationales are utilized for answer prediction. Furthermore, the interplay between task vulnerability to confirmation bias and... | Yue Wan, Xiaowei Jia, Xiang Lorraine Li |  |

However, current approaches face critical limitations: they ignore biological prior knowledge encoded in gene regulatory relationships and fail to leverage multi-omics signals that could provide complementary regulatory insights. In this paper, we propose GRNFormer, a new framework that systematically integrates multi-scale Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) inferred from multi-omics data into RNA foundation model training. Our framework introduces two key innovations. First, we introduce a pipeline for constructing hierarchical GRNs that capture regulatory relationships at both cell-type-specific and cell-specific resolutions. Second, we design a structure-aware integration framework that addresses the information asymmetry in GRNs through two technical advances: (1) A graph topological adapter using multi-head cross-attention to weight regulatory... | Mufan Qiu, Xinyu Hu, Fengwei Zhan, Sukwon Yun, Jie Peng, Ruichen Zhang, Bhavya Kailkhura, Jiekun Yang, Tianlong Chen |  |

For example, a statement like, “Ugh, I can’t believe I got promoted to lead the entire team. So stressful!”, subtly highlights an achievement while pretending to be complaining. Detecting humblebragging is important for machines to better understand the nuances of human language, especially in tasks like sentiment analysis and intent recognition. However, this topic has not yet been studied in computational linguistics. For the first time, we introduce the task of automatically detecting humblebragging in text. We formalize the task by proposing a 4-tuple definition of humblebragging and evaluate machine learning, deep learning, and large language models (LLMs) on this task, comparing their performance with humans. We also create and release a dataset called HB-24, containing 3,340 humblebrags generated using GPT-4o. Our experiments show that detecting... | Sharath Naganna, Saprativa Bhattacharjee, Biplab Banerjee, Pushpak Bhattacharyya |  |

However, current SQA datasets have limited reasoning types and neglect the relevance between tables and text, creating a significant gap with real scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a QA benchmark for scientific tables and text with diverse reasoning types (SCITAT). To cover more reasoning types, we summarize various reasoning types from real-world questions. To reason on both tables and text, we require the questions to incorporate tables and text as much as possible. Based on SCITAT, we propose a baseline (CAR), which combines various reasoning methods to address different reasoning types and process tables and text at the same time. CAR brings average improvements of 4.1% over other baselines on SCITAT, validating its effectiveness. Error analysis reveals the challenges of SCITAT, such as complex numerical calculations and domain knowledge. | Xuanliang Zhang, Dingzirui Wang, Baoxin Wang, Longxu Dou, Xinyuan Lu, Keyan Xu, Dayong Wu, Qingfu Zhu |  |

Prior work has explored attribution at the sentence level, but these methods fall short when users seek attribution for specific keywords within the response, such as numbers, years, or names. To address this limitation, we propose TokenShapley, a novel token-level attribution method that combines Shapley value-based data attribution with KNN-based retrieval techniques inspired by recent advances in KNN-augmented LLMs. By leveraging a precomputed datastore for contextual retrieval and computing Shapley values to quantify token importance, TokenShapley provides a fine-grained data attribution approach. Extensive evaluations on four benchmarks show that TokenShapley outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in token-level attribution, achieving a 11–23% improvement in accuracy. | Yingtai Xiao, Yuqing Zhu, Sirat Samyoun, Wanrong Zhang, Jiachen T.

However, the depth of exploration of the reasoning procedure can significantly affect the task performance. Existing methods to automatically decide the depth often lead to high cost and a lack of flexibility. To address these issues, we propose Entropy-based Exploration Depth Conduction (Entro-duction), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the exploration depth during multi-step reasoning by monitoring LLM’s output entropy and variance entropy. We employ these two features to capture the model’s uncertainty of the current step and the fluctuation of uncertainty across consecutive reasoning steps. Based on the observed entropy changes, the LLM selects whether to deepen, expand, or stop exploration according to the probability, which facilitates the trade-off between the reasoning accuracy and exploration effectiveness. Experimental results across four benchmark datasets... | Jinghan Zhang, Xiting Wang, Fengran Mo, Yeyang Zhou, Wanfu Gao, Kunpeng Liu |  |

However, their definitions are commonly under-specified. We make a theoretical contribution to the specification of representational harms by introducing a framework, grounded in speech act theory (Austin 1962), that conceptualizes representational harms caused by generative language systems as the perlocutionary effects (i.e., real-world impacts) of particular types of illocutionary acts (i.e., system behaviors). Building on this argument and drawing on relevant literature from linguistic anthropology and sociolinguistics, we provide new definitions of stereotyping, demeaning, and erasure. We then use our framework to develop a granular taxonomy of illocutionary acts that cause representational harms, going beyond the high-level taxonomies presented in previous work. We also discuss the ways that our framework and taxonomy can support the development of valid measurement... | Emily Corvi, Hannah Washington, Stefanie Reed, Chad Atalla, Alexandra Chouldechova, P.

However, such workflows are often undocumented, and their automatic extraction from conversations remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present a novel framework for extracting and evaluating dialog workflows from historical interactions. Our extraction process involves two key stages: (1) a retrieval step to select relevant conversations based on key procedural elements, and (2) a structured workflow generation step using question-answer-based chain-of-thought (QA-CoT) prompting. To comprehensively evaluate the quality of the extracted workflows, we introduce an automated simulation framework with agent and customer bots that measures their effectiveness in resolving customer issues. Extensive experiments on the ABCD and SynthABCD datasets show that our QA-CoT technique improves workflow extraction by 12.16% in average macro accuracy over the baseline.... | Prafulla Kumar Choubey, Xiangyu Peng, Shilpa Bhagavath, Caiming Xiong, Shiva Kumar Pentyala, ChienSheng Wu |  |

As the impact of generative models grows, it is necessary to develop statistical methods to understand collections of available models. These methods are particularly important in settings where the user may not have access to information related to a model’s pre-training data, weights, or other relevant model-level covariates. In this paper we extend recent results on representations of black-box generative models to model-level statistical inference tasks. We demonstrate that the model-level representations are effective for multiple inference tasks. | Hayden S. Helm, Aranyak Acharyya, Youngser Park, Brandon Duderstadt, Carey E. Priebe |  |

One major challenge in such evaluation is that LLMs may have developed shortcuts by encountering the head entity “Scarlett Johansson” and the answer entity “United States” in the same training sequences or merely guess the answer based on frequency-based priors. To prevent shortcuts, we exclude test queries where the head and answer entities might have co-appeared during training. Through careful selection of relations and facts and systematic removal of cases where models might guess answers or exploit partial matches, we construct an evaluation dataset SOCRATES (ShOrtCut-fRee lATent rEaSoning). We observe that LLMs demonstrate promising latent multi-hop reasoning abilities without exploiting shortcuts, but only for certain types of queries. For queries requiring latent recall... | Sohee Yang, Nora Kassner, Elena Gribovskaya, Sebastian Riedel, Mor Geva |  |

To develop the instruction-tuned math models, we propose a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) process that first achieves competitive performance across general domains, followed by targeted fine-tuning for the math domain using a carefully curated set of prompts and synthetically generated responses. The resulting model, AceMath-72B-Instruct greatly outperforms Qwen2.5-Math-72B-Instruct, GPT-4o and Claude-3.5 Sonnet. To develop math-specialized reward model, we first construct AceMath-RewardBench, a comprehensive and robust benchmark for evaluating math reward models across diverse problems and difficulty levels. After that, we present a systematic approach to build our math reward models. The resulting model, AceMath-72B-RM, consistently outperforms... | Zihan Liu, Yang Chen, Mohammad Shoeybi, Bryan Catanzaro, Wei Ping |  |

However, their effectiveness is under-explored due to the difficulty of high-quality corpus collection and the lack of available benchmarks. The climate-related events stored in regional newspapers record how communities adapted and recovered from disasters. However, the processing of the original corpus is non-trivial. In this study, we first develop a disruptive weather impact dataset with a four-stage well-crafted construction pipeline. Then, we propose WXImpactBench, the first benchmark for evaluating the capacity of LLMs on disruptive weather impacts. The benchmark involves two evaluation tasks, multi-label classification and ranking-based question answering. Extensive experiments on evaluating a set of LLMs provide first-hand analysis of the challenges in developing disruptive weather impact understanding and climate change... | Yongan Yu, Qingchen Hu, Xianda Du, Jiayin Wang, Fengran Mo, Renée Sieber |  |

Existing methods combine quantization with parameter-efficient fine-tuning but often fail to meet practical performance requirements. This paper introduces MeMoTune, a novel fine-tuning framework for quantized LLMs. By employing a measure and moment approach within a low-rank approximation framework in probability measure space, MeMoTune optimizes the objective function for superior fine-tuning results. The update process is further refined through scaled gradient, enhancing convergence efficiency and noise robustness. Experiments on tasks like text generation, summarization, and understanding show MeMoTune significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, e.g. fine-tuning Llama2-13B on GSM8K improves accuracy by 5.5%, while fine-tuning DeBERTaV3-base on CoLA of GLUE increases Matthews correlation by 1.7%.

However, to ensure their safe and effective integration into real-world educational settings, they must demonstrate proficiency in specific, granular areas of knowledge. Existing cloze-style benchmarks, commonly used to evaluate LMs’ knowledge, have three major limitations. They: 1) do not cover the educational domain; 2) typically focus on low-complexity, generic knowledge or broad domains, which do not adequately assess the models’ knowledge in specific subjects; and 3) often rely on templates that can bias model predictions. Here, we introduce MALAMUTE, a multilingual, template-free, and highly granular probing dataset comprising expert-written, peer-reviewed probes from 71 university-level textbooks across three languages (English, Spanish, and Polish). MALAMUTE is the first education-based cloze-style dataset. It covers eight domains, each with up to 14 subdomains, further broken down into concepts and concept-based... | Sagi Shaier, George Arthur Baker, Chiranthan Sridhar, Lawrence Hunter, Katharina von der Wense |  |

However, a persistent challenge lies in the limited semantics derived from the raw data. To address this issue, researchers have explored enhancing textual ABSA with additional augmentations, they either craft audio, text and linguistic features based on the input, or rely on user-posted images. Yet these approaches have their limitations: the former three formations are heavily overlap with the original data, which undermines their ability to be supplementary while the user-posted images are extremely dependent on human annotation, which not only limits its application scope to just a handful of text-image datasets, but also propagates the errors derived from human mistakes to the entire downstream loop. In this study, we explore the way of generating the sentimental image that no one has ever ventured before. We propose a novel Sentimental Image Generation method that can... | Xiaoyi Bao, Jinghang Gu, Zhongqing Wang, ChuRen Huang |  |

An effective strategy to mitigate this hazard is to leverage off-the-shelf LLMs to detect hallucinations after the generation. The primary challenge resides in the comprehensive elicitation of the intrinsic knowledge acquired during their pre-training phase. However, existing methods that employ multi-step reasoning chains predominantly fall short of addressing this issue. Moreover, since existing methods for hallucination detection tend to decompose text into isolated statements, they are unable to understand the contextual semantic relations in long-form content. In this paper, we study a novel concept, self-elicitation, to leverage self-generated thoughts derived from prior statements as catalysts to elicit the expression of intrinsic knowledge and understand contextual semantics. We present a... | Zihang Liu, Jiawei Guo, Hao Zhang, Hongyang Chen, Jiajun Bu, Haishuai Wang |  |

Current works find that LLMs fall short on questions around low-frequency entities. However, such proofs are unreliable since the questions can differ not only in entity frequency but also in difficulty themselves. So we introduce \*\*ComparisonQA\*\* benchmark, containing \*\*283K\*\* abstract questions, each instantiated by a pair of high-frequency and low-frequency entities. It ensures a controllable comparison to study the role of knowledge frequency in the performance of LLMs. Because the difference between such a pair is only the entity with different frequencies. In addition, we use both correctness and uncertainty to develop a two-round method to evaluate LLMs’ knowledge robustness. It aims to avoid possible semantic shortcuts which is a serious problem of current QA study. Experiments reveal that LLMs, including GPT-4o, exhibit particularly low robustness regarding low-frequency... | Qing Zong, Zhaowei Wang, Tianshi Zheng, Xiyu Ren, Yangqiu Song |  |

Current text segmentation models, when applied directly to STS (Streaming Text Segmentation), exhibit numerous limitations, such as imbalances in labels that affect the stability of model training, and discrepancies between the model’s training tasks (sentence classification) and the actual text segmentation that limit the model’s segmentation capabilities.To address these challenges, we first implement STS for the first time using a sliding window-based segmentation method. Secondly, we employ two different levels of sliding window-based balanced label strategies to stabilize the training process of the streaming segmentation model and enhance training convergence speed. Finally, by adding a one-dimensional bounding-box regression task for text sequences within the window, we restructure the training approach of STS... | Rui He, Zhongqing Wang, Minjie Qiang, Hongling Wang, Yifan Zhang, Hua Xu, Shuai Fan, Guodong Zhou |  |

The task of taxonomy expansion involves integrating emerging entities into existing taxonomies by identifying appropriate parent entities for these new query entities. Previous methods rely on self-supervised techniques that generate annotation data from existing taxonomies but are less effective with small taxonomies (fewer than 100 entities). In this work, we introduce CodeTaxo, a novel approach that leverages large language models through code language prompts to capture the taxonomic structure. Extensive experiments on five real-world benchmarks from different domains demonstrate that CodeTaxo consistently achieves superior performance across all evaluation metrics, significantly outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods. The code and data are available at https://github.com/QingkaiZeng/CodeTaxo-official. | Qingkai Zeng, Yuyang Bai, Zhaoxuan Tan, Zhenyu Wu, Shangbin Feng, Meng Jiang |  |

A recent work applies conformal prediction to KGE methods, providing uncertainty estimates by generating a set of answers that is guaranteed to include the true answer with a predefined confidence level. However, existing methods provide probabilistic guarantees averaged over a reference set of queries and answers (marginal coverage guarantee). In high-stakes applications such as medical diagnosis, a stronger guarantee is often required: the predicted sets must provide consistent coverage per query (conditional coverage guarantee). We propose CondKGCP, a novel method that approximates predicate-conditional coverage guarantees while maintaining compact prediction sets. CondKGCP merges predicates with similar vector representations and augments calibration with rank information. We prove the theoretical guarantees and demonstrate empirical... | Yuqicheng Zhu, Daniel Hernández, Yuan He, Zifeng Ding, Bo Xiong, Evgeny Kharlamov, Steffen Staab |  |

Unlike prior approaches that require human annotations or training a dedicated data filter, AutoDS relies solely on a model’s logits to determine whether a given passage is mathematically informative and educational. By integrating AutoDS into a continual pretraining pipeline, we substantially boost downstream performance on challenging math benchmarks (MATH, GSM8K, and BBH) while using far fewer tokens than previous methods. Empirically, our approach achieves roughly a twofold improvement in pretraining token efficiency over strong baselines, underscoring the potential of self-directed data selection in enhancing mathematical reasoning. We will release our curated dataset to facilitate future research in automated domain-specific data curation. | Yifan Zhang, Yifan Luo, Yang Yuan, Andrew C. Yao |  |

In this paper, we introduce a novel Fault-Aware DistIllation via Peer-Review (FAIR) approach: 1) instead of merely obtaining rationales from teachers, our method asks teachers to identify and explain the student’s mistakes, providing customized instruction learning data; 2) we design a simulated peer-review process between teacher LLMs, and selects only the generated rationales above the acceptance threshold, which reduces the chance of teachers guessing correctly with flawed rationale, improving instructional data quality.... | Zhuochun Li, Yuelyu Ji, Rui Meng, Daqing He |  |

These prosodic characteristics can be considered oneof major signatures for ADSD, which is unique to each source. So better is the PTM at capturing prosodic signs better the ADSD per-formance. We consider various SOTA PTMs that have shown top performance in different prosodic tasks for our experiments on benchmark datasets, ASVSpoof 2019 and CFAD. x-vector (speaker recognition PTM) attains the highest performance in comparison to allthe PTMs considered despite consisting lowest model parameters. This higher performance can be due to its speaker recognition pre-training that enables it for capturing unique prosodic characteristics of the sources in a better way. Further, motivated from tasks suchas audio deepfake detection and speech recognition, where fusion of PTMs... | Orchid Chetia Phukan, Drishti Singh, Swarup Ranjan Behera, Arun Balaji Buduru, Rajesh Sharma |  |

However, RAG also introduces biases contained within the retrieved documents. These biases can be amplified in scenarios which are multilingual and culturally-sensitive, such as territorial disputes. We thus introduce BordIRLines, a dataset of territorial disputes paired with retrieved Wikipedia documents, across 49 languages. We evaluate the cross-lingual robustness of this RAG setting by formalizing several modes for multilingual retrieval. Our experiments on several LLMs show that incorporating perspectives from diverse languages can in fact improve robustness; retrieving multilingual documents best improves response consistency and decreases geopolitical bias over RAG with purely in-language documents. We also consider how RAG responses utilize presented documents, finding a much wider variance in the linguistic distribution of response citations, when querying in... | Bryan Li, Fiona Luo, Samar Haider, Adwait Agashe, Siyu Li, Runqi Liu, Miranda Muqing Miao, Shriya Ramakrishnan, Yuan Yuan, Chris CallisonBurch |  |

However, due to differences in pre-training data and objectives, there is an inevitable gap between the documents ranked as relevant by the reranker and those required by the generator to support answering the query. To address this gap, we propose RADIO, a novel and practical preference alignment framework with RAtionale DIstillatiOn. Specifically, We first propose a rationale extraction method that leverages the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to extract the rationales necessary for answering the query. Subsequently, a rationale-based alignment process is designed to rerank the documents based on the extracted rationales, and fine-tune the reranker to align the preferences. We conduct extensive experiments on two tasks across three datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our... | Pengyue Jia, Derong Xu, Xiaopeng Li, Zhaocheng Du, Xiangyang Li, Yichao Wang, Yuhao Wang, Qidong Liu, Maolin Wang, Huifeng Guo, Ruiming Tang, Xiangyu Zhao |  |

A primary challenge in studying multilingual scaling is the difficulty of analyzing individual language performance due to cross-lingual transfer. To tackle this, we shift the focus from individual languages to language families. We introduce and validate a hypothesis that the test cross-entropy loss for each language family is determined solely by its own sampling ratio, independent of other languages in the mixture. This insight simplifies the complexity of multilingual scaling and make the analysis scalable to an arbitrary number of languages. Building on this hypothesis, we derive a power-law relationship that links performance with dataset size, model size and sampling ratios. This relationship enables us to predict performance across various combinations of the above three quantities, and... | Yifei He, Alon Benhaim, Barun Patra, Praneetha Vaddamanu, Sanchit Ahuja, Parul Chopra, Vishrav Chaudhary, Han Zhao, Xia Song |  |

Unfortunately, they have recently been shown to be vulnerable to corpus poisoning attacks in which a malicious user injects a small fraction of adversarial passages into the retrieval corpus to trick the system into returning these passages among the top-ranked results for a broad set of user queries. Further study is needed to understand the extent to which these attacks could limit the deployment of dense retrievers in real-world applications. In this work, we propose Approximate Greedy Gradient Descent (AGGD), a new attack on dense retrieval systems based on the widely used HotFlip method for efficiently generating adversarial passages. We demonstrate that AGGD can select a higher quality set of token-level perturbations than HotFlip by replacing its random token sampling... | Jinyan Su, Preslav Nakov, Claire Cardie |  |

Although we focus on climate science to illustrate its effectiveness, our approach can potentially be adapted for other specialized domains. Existing methods often neglect curated taxonomies—hierarchies of verified entities and relationships—and LLMs frequently struggle to extract KGs in specialized domains. Our approach addresses these gaps by anchoring extraction to expert-curated taxonomies, aligning entities and relations with domain semantics, and validating LLM outputs using RAG against the domain taxonomy. Through a climate science case study using our annotated dataset of 25 publications (1,705 entity-publication links, 3,618 expert-validated relationships), we demonstrate that taxonomy-guided LLM prompting combined with RAG-based validation reduces hallucinations by 23.3%... | Huitong Pan, Qi Zhang, Mustapha Adamu, Eduard C.

However, existing methods often suffer from accuracy degradation without full-model sparsity-aware fine-tuning. This paper presents Wanda++, a novel pruning framework that outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by utilizing decoder-block-level regional gradients. Specifically, Wanda++ improves the pruning score with regional gradients for the first time and proposes an efficient regional optimization method to minimize pruning-induced output discrepancies between the dense and sparse decoder output. Notably, Wanda++ improves perplexity by up to 32% over Wanda in the language modeling task and generalizes effectively to downstream tasks. Moreover, despite updating weights with regional optimization, Wanda++ remains orthogonal to sparsity-aware fine-tuning, further reducing perplexity with LoRA in great extend. Our approach is lightweight, pruning a 7B LLaMA... | Yifan Yang, Kai Zhen, Bhavana Ganesh, Aram Galstyan, Goeric Huybrechts, Markus Müller, Jonas M.

Existing detection methods, including text-based Authorship Attribution (AA), overlook the multimodal nature of these ads, which combine text and images. To bridge this gap, we introduce MATCHED, a multimodal AA dataset comprising 27,619 unique text descriptions and 55,115 unique images sourced from Backpage across seven U.S. cities in four geographic regions. This study extensively benchmarks text-only, vision-only, and multimodal baselines for vendor identification and verification tasks, employing multitask (joint) training objectives that achieve superior classification and retrieval performance on in-sample and out-of-data distribution datasets. The results demonstrate that while text remains the dominant modality, integrating visual features adds stylistic cues that enrich model performance. Moreover, text-image alignment... | Vageesh Kumar Saxena, Benjamin Bashpole, Gijs van Dijck, Gerasimos Spanakis |  |

Existing fraud detection benchmarks primarily focus on single-turn classification tasks, failing to capture the dynamic nature of real-world fraud attempts. To address this gap, we introduce Fraud-R1, a challenging bilingual benchmark designed to assess LLMs’ ability to resist fraud and phishing attacks across five key fraud categories: Fraudulent Services, Impersonation, Phishing Scams, Fake Job Postings, and Online Relationships, covering subclasses. Our dataset comprises manually curated fraud cases from social media, news, phishing scam records, and prior fraud datasets. | Shu Yang, Shenzhe Zhu, Zeyu Wu, Keyu Wang, Junchi Yao, Junchao Wu, Lijie Hu, Mengdi Li, Derek F.

Although this capability has a variety of benign applications, paraphrasing attacks—paraphrases applied to machine-generated texts—are known to significantly degrade the performance of machine-text detectors. This motivates us to consider the novel problem of paraphrase inversion, where, given paraphrased text, the objective is to recover an approximation of the original text. The closer the approximation is to the original text, the better machine-text detectors will perform. We propose an approach which frames the problem as translation from paraphrased text back to the original text, which requires examples of texts and corresponding paraphrases to train the inversion model. Fortunately, such training data can easily be generated, given a corpus of original texts and one or more paraphrasing models. We find that language models such as GPT-4 and Llama-3 exhibit... | Rafael Alberto Rivera Soto, Barry Y. Chen, Nicholas Andrews |  |

To address this, we introduce SANSKRITI, a benchmark designed to evaluate language models’ comprehension of India’s rich cultural diversity. Comprising of 21,853 meticulously curated question-answer pairs spanning 28 states and 8 union territories, SANSKRITI is the largest dataset for testing Indian cultural knowledge. It covers sixteen key attributes of Indian culture namely rituals and ceremonies, history, tourism, cuisine, dance and music, costume, language, art, festivals, religion, medicine, transport, sports, nightlife and personalities, providing a comprehensive representation of India’s cultural tapestry. We evaluate SANSKRITI on leading Large Language Models (LLMs), Indic Language Models (ILMs), and Small Language Models(SLMs), revealing significant disparities in their ability to handle culturally nuanced queries, with... | Arijit Maji, Raghvendra Kumar, Akash Ghosh, Anushka, Sriparna Saha |  |

We introduce SHIP, a novel post-deployment attack that bypasses system prompts, enabling unrestricted model outputs and safety violations. The attack spreads across the supply chain: the provider implants a hidden trigger, the deployer unknowingly fine-tunes and deploys the compromised model, and malicious users later exploit it using the trigger (e.g., obtained via underground market), as real-world software supply chain breaches. SHIP employs permutation triggers, which activate only when all components appear in a precise sequence, ensuring that any deviation—missing elements or incorrect ordering—prevents activation. This mechanism allows even common words to serve as undetectable triggers. We introduce Precise Activation Guarding, ensuring strict sequence-based activation, and... | Lu Yan, Siyuan Cheng, Xuan Chen, Kaiyuan Zhang, Guangyu Shen, Xiangyu Zhang |  |

The PCFP addresses a fundamental question in morphological processing: how do speakers accurately generate inflected forms of words when presented with incomplete paradigms? This problem is particularly salient when modeling complex inflectional systems. We focus on Spanish verbal paradigms, where certain verbs follow an irregular L-shaped pattern, where the first-person singular present indicative stem matches the stem used throughout the present subjunctive mood. We formulate the problem as a morphological reinflection task. Specifically, we investigate the role of input frequency in the acquisition of regular versus irregular L-shaped patterns in transformer models. By systematically manipulating the input distributions and analyzing model behavior, we reveal four key findings: 1) Models perform better on L-shaped... | Akhilesh Kakolu Ramarao, Kevin Tang, Dinah BaerHenney |  |

We present a conceptually motivated investigation into the use of figurative language and causal semantic context to facilitate targeted empathetic response generation within a specific mental health support domain, studying how these factors may be leveraged to promote improved response quality. Our approach achieves a 7.6% improvement in BLEU, a 36.7% reduction in Perplexity, and a 7.6% increase in lexical diversity (D-1 and D-2) compared to models without these signals, and human assessments show a 24.2% increase in empathy ratings. These findings provide deeper insights into grounded empathy understanding and response generation, offering a foundation for future research in this area. | Gyeongeun Lee, Zhu Wang, Sathya N.

However, existing work has focused on relatively complex “many-hop” reasoning problems. In this paper, we analyse the performance of fine-tuned LLMs on simple reasoning problems, all of which can be solved in at most three inference steps. Due to the simplicity of these problems, the model cannot encounter test problems that are fundamentally different from those it has seen during training. Unfortunately, however, we find that the models remain highly brittle, being susceptible to seemingly innocent perturbations, such as the addition of duplicates to the set of premises and shuffling the order in which the premises are presented. | Nurul Fajrin Ariyani, Zied Bouraoui, Richard Booth, Steven Schockaert |  |

The main barrier to the success of these systems is that learners often struggle to understand definitions due to the presence of potentially unfamiliar words and grammar, particularly when non-standard language is involved. To address these challenges, we propose CLIX, the task of Cross-Lingual explanations of Idiomatic eXpressions. We explore the capabilities of current NLP models for this task, and observe that while it remains challenging, large language models show promise. Finally, we perform a detailed error analysis to highlight the key challenges that need to be addressed before we can reliably incorporate these systems into educational tools. | Aaron Gluck, Katharina von der Wense, Maria Leonor Pacheco |  |

Semantic entropy (SE) enhances traditional entropy estimation by quantifying uncertainty at the semantic cluster level. However, as modern LLMs generate longer one-sentence responses, SE becomes less effective because it overlooks two crucial factors: intra-cluster similarity (the spread within a cluster) and inter-cluster similarity (the distance between clusters). To address this limitation, we propose a simple black-box uncertainty quantification method inspired by nearest neighbor estimates of entropy. Our approach can also be easily extended to white-box settings by incorporating token probabilities. Additionally, we provide theoretical results showing that our method generalizes semantic entropy. Extensive empirical results demonstrate its effectiveness compared to semantic entropy across two recent LLMs (Phi3 and Llama3) and three common... | Dang Nguyen, Ali Payani, Baharan Mirzasoleiman |  |

Existing solutions face trade-offs: explicit memory designs based on external storage require complex management and incur storage overhead, while implicit memory designs that store information via parameters struggle with reliable retrieval. In this paper, we propose R3Mem, a memory network that optimizes both information Retention and Retrieval through Reversible context compression. Specifically, R3Mem employs virtual memory tokens to compress and encode infinitely long histories, further enhanced by a hierarchical compression strategy that refines information from document- to entity-level for improved assimilation across granularities. For retrieval, R3Mem employs a reversible architecture, reconstructing raw data by invoking the model backward with compressed information. Implemented via parameter-efficient fine-tuning, it can integrate seamlessly with any Transformer-based model.... | Xiaoqiang Wang, Suyuchen Wang, Yun Zhu, Bang Liu |  |

While various methods exist to enhance privacy in text-based applications, privacy risks associated with visual inputs remain largely overlooked such as Protected Health Information (PHI) in medical images. To tackle this problem, two key tasks: accurately localizing sensitive text and processing it to ensure privacy protection should be performed. To address this issue, we introduce VisShield (Vision Privacy Shield), an end-to-end framework designed to enhance the privacy awareness of VLMs. Our framework consists of two key components: a specialized instruction-tuning dataset OPTIC (Optical Privacy Text Instruction Collection) and a tailored training methodology. The dataset provides diverse privacy-oriented prompts that guide VLMs to perform targeted Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for precise localization of sensitive text, while the training strategy ensures effective adaptation... | Tiejin Chen, Pingzhi Li, Kaixiong Zhou, Tianlong Chen, Hua Wei |  |

However, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which process both text and images, introduce unique privacy challenges that remain underexplored. Compared to text-only models, MLLMs can extract and expose sensitive information embedded in images, posing new privacy risks. We reveal that some MLLMs are susceptible to privacy breaches, leaking sensitive data embedded in images or stored in memory. Specifically, in this paper, we (1) introduce MM-Privacy, a comprehensive dataset designed to assess privacy risks across various multi-modal tasks and scenarios, where we define Disclosure Risks and Retention Risks. (2) systematically evaluate different MLLMs using MM-Privacy and demonstrate how models leak sensitive data across various tasks, and (3) provide additional insights into the role of task inconsistency in privacy risks, emphasizing... | Tiejin Chen, Pingzhi Li, Kaixiong Zhou, Tianlong Chen, Hua Wei |  |

However, challenges arise when processing speech transcripts that describe complex scenarios, as they are verbose and include repetition, hedging, and vagueness. E.g., during a company’s earnings call, an executive might project a positive revenue outlook to reassure investors, despite uncertainty regarding future earnings. It is crucial for LLMs to incorporate this uncertainty systematically when making decisions. In this paper, we introduce DeFine, a modular framework that constructs probabilistic factor profiles from complex scenarios. It then integrates these profiles with analogical reasoning, leveraging insights from similar past experiences to guide LLMs in making critical decisions in new situations. Our framework separates the tasks of quantifying uncertainty and incorporating it into LLM decision-making. This approach is particularly useful in areas such as consulting and financial... | Yebowen Hu, Xiaoyang Wang, Wenlin Yao, Yiming Lu, Daoan Zhang, Hassan Foroosh, Dong Yu, Fei Liu |  |

This imbalance leads to \*\*Tool Overuse\*\*, where models unnecessarily rely on external tools for tasks solvable with parametric knowledge, increasing computational overhead. Inspired by human metacognition, we introduce \*\*SMART\*\* (Strategic Model-Aware Reasoning with Tools), a paradigm that enhances an agent’s self-awareness to optimize task handling and reduce tool overuse. To support this paradigm, we introduce \*\*SMART-ER\*\*, a dataset spanning three domains, where reasoning alternates between parametric knowledge and tool-dependent steps, with each step enriched by rationales explaining when tools are necessary. Through supervised training, we develop \*\*SMARTAgent\*\*, a family of models that dynamically balance parametric knowledge and tool use. Evaluations show that SMARTAgent reduces tool use... | Cheng Qian, Emre Can Acikgoz, Hongru Wang, Xiusi Chen, Avirup Sil, Dilek HakkaniTür, Gokhan Tur, Heng Ji |  |

However, challenges remain in enhancing their performance for underrepresented languages, ensuring continual learning without catastrophic forgetting, and developing robust evaluation methodologies. This work addresses these issues by investigating the impact of Continued Pretraining (CPT) on multilingual models and proposing a comprehensive evaluation framework for LLMs, focusing on the case of Galician language. Our first contribution explores CPT strategies for languages with limited representation in multilingual models. We analyze how CPT with Galician corpora improves text generation while assessing the trade-offs between linguistic enrichment and task-solving capabilities. Our findings show that CPT with small, high-quality corpora and diverse instructions enhances both task performance and linguistic quality. Our second contribution is a structured... | Pablo Rodríguez, Silvia Paniagua Suárez, Pablo Gamallo, Susana Sotelo Docío |  |

The temporal dimension introduces extensive possible variations across frames, over which consistency and continuity may be violated. In this work, we evaluate the emergence of new concepts and relation transitions as time progresses in a video, which we refer to as Temporal Compositionality. We propose TC-Bench, a benchmark of meticulously crafted text prompts, ground truth videos, and new evaluation metrics. The prompts articulate the initial and final states of scenes, effectively reducing ambiguities for frame development. In addition, by collecting corresponding ground-truth videos, the benchmark can be used for text-to-video and image-to-video generation. We develop new metrics to measure the completeness of component transitions, which demonstrate significantly higher correlations with human judgments than existing metrics. Our experiments reveal that contemporary video generators are still weak in... | Weixi Feng, Jiachen Li, Michael Saxon, TsuJui Fu, Wenhu Chen, William Yang Wang |  |

Sparse attention methods alleviate this cost but often impose static, predefined masks, failing to capture heterogeneous attention patterns. This results in suboptimal token interactions, limiting adaptability and retrieval accuracy in long-sequence tasks. This work introduces a dynamic sparse attention mechanism that assigns adaptive masks at the attention-map level, preserving heterogeneous patterns across layers and heads. Unlike existing approaches, our method eliminates the need for fine-tuning and predefined mask structures while maintaining computational efficiency. By learning context-aware attention structures, it achieves high alignment with full-attention models, ensuring minimal performance degradation while reducing memory and compute overhead. This approach provides a scalable alternative to full attention, enabling... | Hanzhi Zhang, Heng Fan, Kewei Sha, Yan Huang, Yunhe Feng |  |

This study examines the biases and limitations of LLMs in three roles: answer generator, judge, and debater. These roles loosely correspond to previously described alignment frameworks: preference alignment (judge) and scalable oversight (debater), with the answer generator reflecting the typical setting with user interactions. We develop a “no-consensus” benchmark by curating examples that encompass a variety of a priori ambivalent scenarios, each presenting two possible stances. Our results show that while LLMs can provide nuanced assessments when generating open-ended answers, they tend to take a stance on no-consensus topics when employed as judges or debaters. These findings underscore the necessity for more sophisticated methods for aligning LLMs without human... | Bhaktipriya Radharapu, Manon Revel, Megan Ung, Sebastian Ruder, Adina Williams |  |

Recently, as their capabilities have expanded, primarily text-based NLP systems have often been billed as able to assist or even automate this kind of work. But to what extent are these systems able to model these tasks as experts conceptualize and perform them now? In this study, we interview sixteen domain experts across two domains to understand their processes of document research, and compare it to the current state of NLP systems. We find that our participants processes are idiosyncratic, iterative, and rely extensively on the social context of a document in addition its content, and that approaches in NLP and adjacent fields that explicitly center the document as an object, rather than as merely a container for text, tend to better reflect our participants’ priorities. We call on the NLP community to more carefully consider the... | Sireesh Gururaja, Nupoor Gandhi, Jeremiah Milbauer, Emma Strubell |  |

However, our study reveals a significant security vulnerability in batch prompting: malicious users can inject attack instructions into a batch, leading to unwanted interference across all queries, which can result in the inclusion of harmful content, such as phishing links, or the disruption of logical reasoning. In this paper, we construct BatchSafeBench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 150 attack instructions of two types and 8k batch instances, to study the batch prompting vulnerability systematically. Our evaluation of both closed-source and open-weight LLMs demonstrates that all LLMs are susceptible to batch prompting attacks. We then explore multiple defending approaches. While the prompting-based defense shows limited effectiveness for smaller LLMs, the probing-based approach achieves about 95% accuracy in... | Murong Yue, Ziyu Yao |  |

While most studies focus on evaluating the capabilities of state-of-the-art (SoTA) Vision Language Models (VLMs) through task accuracy (e.g., visual question answering, grounding), our work explores the related but complementary aspect of consistency – the ability of a VLM to produce semantically similar or identical responses to semantically similar queries. We note that consistency is a fundamental prerequisite (necessary but not sufficient condition) for robustness and trust in VLMs. Armed with this perspective, we propose the MM-Rbenchmark, which allows us to analyze performance, in terms of consistency and accuracy, of SoTA VLMs on three tasks: Question Rephrasing, Image Restyling, and Context Reasoning. Our analysis reveals that consistency does not always align with accuracy, indicating that models with higher accuracy are not necessarily... | ShihHan Chou, Shivam Chandhok, Jim Little, Leonid Sigal |  |

However, how context-faithful LLMs are and what factors influence LLMs’ context faithfulness remain largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate the impact of memory strength and evidence presentation on LLMs’ receptiveness to external evidence. We quantify the memory strength of LLMs by measuring the divergence in LLMs’ responses to different paraphrases of the same question, which is not considered by previous works. We also generate evidence in various styles to examine LLMs’ behavior. Our results show that for questions with high memory strength, LLMs are more likely to rely on internal memory. Furthermore, presenting paraphrased evidence significantly increases LLMs’ receptiveness compared to simple repetition or adding details. These findings provide key insights for improving retrieval-augmented generation and context-aware... | Yuepei Li, Kang Zhou, Qiao Qiao, Bach Nguyen, Qing Wang, Qi Li |  |

In the practical use of MLLMs, users have full control over the interaction process with the model, such as using their own collected photos and posing arbitrary open-ended questions. Traditional backdoor attacks that rely on adding external triggers are less applicable. To this end, we introduce a new shadow-activated backdoor attacking paradigm in this paper, wherein attacks implicitly inject malicious content into the responses of MLLMs when the responses explicitly relate to the shadowed object, i.e., without any triggers. To facilitate the shadow-activated backdoor attack, we present a novel framework named BadMLLM to achieve the desired behaviors by constructing a poisoned dataset using GPT-4 Vision and implementing an attention-regularized tuning strategy to address... | Ziyi Yin, Muchao Ye, Yuanpu Cao, Jiaqi Wang, Aofei Chang, Han Liu, Jinghui Chen, Ting Wang, Fenglong Ma |  |

Towards Enhanced Chart and Geometry Understanding](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.249/) |  | 0 | Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in multimodal tasks, yet they often struggle with visual arithmetic, seemingly simple capabilities like object counting or length comparison, which are essential for relevant complex tasks like chart understanding and geometric reasoning. In this work, we first investigate the root causes of this deficiency through a suite of probing tasks focusing on basic visual arithmetic. Our analysis reveals that while pre-trained vision encoders typically capture sufficient information, the text decoder often fails to decode it correctly for arithmetic reasoning. To address this, we propose CogAlign, a novel post-training strategy inspired by Piaget’s theory of cognitive development. CogAlign trains VLMs to recognize invariant properties under visual transformations. We demonstrate that this approach significantly improves the performance of three diverse VLMs on our proposed probing tasks. Furthermore, CogAlign enhances performance... | KungHsiang Huang, Can Qin, Haoyi Qiu, Philippe Laban, Shafiq Joty, Caiming Xiong, ChienSheng Wu |  |

There are two main reasons: (1) users are typically concerned with only the top-K results, making top-K ranking more important, and (2) tail items often lack precise feedback, making top-K ranking more reliable. Based on this, we propose K-order Ranking Preference Optimization (KPO) by extending the DPO’s Plackett-Luce model to accommodate top-K rankings. Additionally, recognizing that the number of important items can vary across queries, we extend KPO to dynamically determine appropriate K for different samples and introduce a curriculum learning strategy to boost training efficiency.

While recent studies have identified critical layers linked to specific functions or behaviors, these efforts typically rely on data-dependent analyses of fine-tuned models, limiting their use to post-hoc settings. In contrast, we introduce a data-oblivious approach to identify intrinsic critical layers in pre-fine-tuned LLMs by analyzing representation dynamics via Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA). We show that layers with significant shifts in representation space are also those most affected during fine-tuning—a pattern that holds consistently across tasks for a given model. Our spectral analysis further reveals that these shifts are driven by changes in the top principal components, which encode semantic transitions from rationales to conclusions.We further apply these findings to two practical scenarios: efficient domain... | Xuyuan Liu, Lei Hsiung, Yaoqing Yang, Yujun Yan |  |

However, most prior work on program repair focuses on isolated elements, such as classes or functions, neglecting their interdependencies, which limits repair accuracy. We present SynFix, a RelationGraph-based approach that integrates LLMs with structural search and synchronization techniques for coordinated program repair across codebases. SynFix constructs a RelationGraph to capture relationships among classes, functions, variables, and their interactions (e.g., imports, inheritance, dependencies). Each RelationGraph node includes detailed code descriptions to help LLMs understand root causes and retrieve relevant contexts. By analyzing one-hop nodes in the RelationGraph, SynFixensures repairs account for dependent updates across components. Patch validation is conducted using regression... | Xunzhu Tang, Jiechao Gao, Jin Xu, Tiezhu Sun, Yewei Song, Saad Ezzini, Wendkûuni C. Ouédraogo, Jacques Klein, Tegawendé F. Bissyandé |  |

Current RAG systems often struggle when retrieval models fail to rank the most relevant documents, leading to the inclusion of more context at the expense of latency and accuracy. While abstractive compression methods can drastically reduce token counts, their token-by-token generation process significantly increases end-to-end latency. Conversely, existing extractive methods reduce the latency but rely on independent, non-adaptive sentence selection, failing to fully utilize contextual information. EXIT addresses these limitations by classifying sentences from retrieved documents—while preserving their contextual dependencies—enabling parallelizable, context-aware extraction that adapts to query complexity and retrieval quality. Our evaluations on both single-hop and multi-hop QA tasks show that EXIT... | Taeho Hwang, Sukmin Cho, Soyeong Jeong, Hoyun Song, SeungYoon Han, Jong C. Park |  |

However, its application to domain-specific tasks remains challenging, as LLMs often fail to decompose tasks accurately or execute subtasks effectively. This paper introduces the Re-TASK framework, a novel theoretical model that Revisits LLM Tasks from cApability, Skill, and Knowledge perspectives, drawing on the principles of Bloom’s Taxonomy and Knowledge Space Theory. While CoT provides a workflow-centric perspective on tasks, Re-TASK introduces a Chain-of-Learning (CoL) paradigm that highlights task dependencies on specific capability items, further broken down into their constituent knowledge and skill components. To address CoT failures, we propose a Re-TASK prompting strategy, which strengthens task-relevant capabilities through targeted knowledge injection and skill adaptation.

However, PEFT has been proven vulnerable to malicious attacks. Research indicates that poisoned LLMs, even after PEFT, retain the capability to activate internalized backdoors when input samples contain predefined triggers. In this paper, we introduce a novel weak-to-strong unlearning algorithm to defend against backdoor attacks based on feature alignment knowledge distillation, named W2SDefense. Specifically, we first train a small-scale language model through full-parameter fine-tuning to serve as the clean teacher model. Then, this teacher model guides the large-scale poisoned student model in unlearning the backdoor, leveraging PEFT. Theoretical analysis suggests that W2SDefense has the potential to enhance the student model’s ability to unlearn backdoor features, preventing the activation of the backdoor.

Although it has demonstrated effectiveness during pre-training, there remains a lack of comprehensive analysis for the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage on the following points: (1) whether packing can effectively enhance training efficiency while maintaining performance, (2) the suitable size of the model and dataset for fine-tuning with the packing method, and (3) whether packing unrelated or related training samples might cause the model to either excessively disregard or over-rely on the context.In this paper, we perform extensive comparisons between SFT methods using padding and packing, covering SFT datasets ranging from 69K to 1.2M and models from 8B to 70B. This provides the first comprehensive analysis of the advantages and limitations of packing versus padding,... | Shuhe Wang, Guoyin Wang, Yizhong Wang, Jiwei Li, Eduard H. Hovy, Chen Guo |  |

However, existing methods face challenges in managing semantic intricacies and optimizing the efficiency of the search process. To overcome these limitations, we propose Better Red Teaming (BRT)—an innovative framework that reconceptualizes test case generation as a strategic planning problem, leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). A notable advancement of our approach is the incorporation of LLMs as world models, enabling the prediction of state transitions and simulation of long-term outcomes throughout the search process. By jointly optimizing objectives related to conditional mutual information and diversity, we improve the world model’s capacity to follow actions while maintaining output diversity. Extensive experiments conducted across a range of LLM architectures demonstrate that BRT achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates without sacrificing... | Yongkang Chen, Chongyang Zhao, Jianwentian Jianwentian, Guiling Cao, Hu Li, Xiaohui Kuang |  |

A typical VLM includes a visual encoder, a text encoder, and an LLM. Recent studies suggest pruning visual tokens based on visual and textual priors to accelerate VLMs without additional training costs. However, these methods often overlook prompt semantics or suffer from biased self-attention in the LLM. Inspired by the efficient mechanisms of the human brain for multimodal understanding, we introduce AdaV, a novel training-free visual token pruning method. By emulating the neural pathways that preprocess visual and auditory information before the reasoning stage, we shift text-guided visual attention redirection to the pre-LLM stage, which reduces biased token pruning and enhances model robustness with a limited visual token budget.

However, existing solutions often suffer from limited agent coordination and heavy reliance on predefined Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), which demand extensive human input. To address these limitations, we propose MegaAgent, a large-scale autonomous LLM-based multi-agent system. MegaAgent generates agents based on task complexity and enables dynamic task decomposition, parallel execution, efficient communication, and comprehensive system monitoring of agents. In evaluations, MegaAgent demonstrates exceptional performance, successfully developing a Gobang game within 800 seconds and scaling up to 590 agents in a national policy simulation to generate multi-domain policies. It significantly outperforms existing systems, such as MetaGPT, in both task completion efficiency and scalability.

Existing methods rely on reward signals and additional annotated data, limiting their scalability and adaptability to diverse human values. To address these challenges, we introduce Persona-judge, a novel discriminative paradigm that enables training-free personalized alignment with unseen preferences. Instead of optimizing policy parameters through external reward feedback, Persona-judge leverages the intrinsic preference judgment capabilities of the model. Specifically, a draft model generates candidate tokens conditioned on a given preference, while a judge model, embodying another preference, cross-validates the predicted tokens whether to be accepted. Experimental results demonstrate that Persona-judge, using the inherent preference evaluation mechanisms of the model, offers a scalable and computationally... | Xiaotian Zhang, Ruizhe Chen, Yang Feng, Zuozhu Liu |  |

In this paper, we study the representation-based self-distillation methods for Neural Machine Translation (NMT) considering the efficiency issue with a large vocabulary. We present a rank-order augmented Pearson correlation loss and an iterative distillation method to prevent the discrepancy of predictions between the student and a stronger teacher from disturbing the training. To prevent the teacher from misleading the student’s learning, we utilize a warm-up strategy and present a gradient adaption method to scale down or zero the Knowledge Distillation (KD) gradients which are opposite to the translation. Experiments show that our method can lead to significant improvements over the strong Transformer baseline on low/middle/high-resource tasks, obtaining comparable... | Hongfei Xu, Zhuofei Liang, Qiuhui Liu, Lingling Mu |  |

Research indicates that certain layers in LLMs harbor substantial redundancy, and pruning these layers has minimal impact on the overall performance. While various layer pruning methods have been developed based on this insight, they generally overlook the finer-grained redundancies within the layers themselves. In this paper, we delve deeper into the architecture of LLMs and demonstrate that finer-grained pruning can be achieved by targeting redundancies in multi-head attention (MHA) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) blocks. We propose a novel, training-free structured pruning approach called BlockPruner. Unlike existing layer pruning methods, BlockPruner segments each Transformer layer into MHA and MLP blocks. It then assesses the importance of these blocks using perplexity measures and applies a heuristic search for... | Longguang Zhong, Fanqi Wan, Ruijun Chen, Xiaojun Quan, Liangzhi Li |  |

In this paper, we conduct a rigorous evaluation of LLMs’ implicit bias towards certain demographics by attacking them from a psychometric perspective to elicit agreements to biased viewpoints. Inspired by psychometric principles in cognitive and social psychology, we propose three attack approaches, i.e., Disguise, Deception, and Teaching. Incorporating the corresponding attack instructions, we built two benchmarks: (1) a bilingual dataset with biased statements covering four bias types (2.7K instances) for extensive comparative analysis, and (2) BUMBLE, a larger benchmark spanning nine common bias types (12.7K instances) for comprehensive evaluation. Extensive evaluation of popular commercial and open-source LLMs shows that our... | Yuchen Wen, Keping Bi, Wei Chen, Jiafeng Guo, Xueqi Cheng |  |

In this work, we aim to enable long-context LLMs to generate responses with fine-grained sentence-level citations on the fly, thereby improving their faithfulness and verifiability. We first introduce LongBench-Cite, an automated benchmark for assessing current LLMs’ performance in long-context question answering with citations (LQAC), revealing considerable room for improvement. To this end, we propose CoF (Coarse to Fine), a novel pipeline that utilizes off-the-shelf LLMs to automatically construct long-context QA instances with precise sentence-level citations, and leverage this pipeline to construct LongCite-45k, a large-scale SFT dataset for LQAC. Finally, we train... | Jiajie Zhang, Yushi Bai, Xin Lv, Wanjun Gu, Danqing Liu, Minhao Zou, Shulin Cao, Lei Hou, Yuxiao Dong, Ling Feng, Juanzi Li |  |

While previous studies have extensively examined biases related to protected attributes such as race, the emergence and propagation of biases on socially contentious issues in multi-agent LLM interactions remain underexplored. This study explores how LLM agents shape public opinion through debates on five contentious topics. By simulating over 2,500 debates, we analyze how initially neutral agents, assigned a centrist disposition, adopt specific stances over time. Statistical analyses reveal significant group conformity mirroring human behavior; LLM agents tend to align with numerically dominant groups or more intelligent agents, exerting a greater influence. These findings underscore the crucial role of agent intelligence in shaping discourse and highlight the risks of bias amplification in online interactions. Our results emphasize the... | Min Choi, Keonwoo Kim, Sungwon Chae, Sangyeob Baek |  |

However, using LLMs for translation suffers from high computational costs and significant latency. Based on our evaluation, in most cases, translations using LLMs are comparable to that generated by neural machine translation (NMT) systems. Only in particular scenarios, LLM and NMT models show respective advantages. As a result, integrating NMT and LLM for translation and using LLM only when necessary seems to be a sound solution. A scheduling policy that optimizes translation result while ensuring fast speed and as less LLM usage as possible is thereby required. We compare several scheduling policies and propose a novel and straightforward decider that leverages source sentence features. We conduct extensive experiments on multilingual test sets and the result shows that we can achieve optimal translation performance with less LLM usage, demonstrating... | Zhanglin Wu, Daimeng Wei, Xiaoyu Chen, Hengchao Shang, Jiaxin Guo, Zongyao Li, Yuanchang Luo, Jinlong Yang, Zhiqiang Rao, Hao Yang |  |

Recent advancements have extended DPO to multimodal scenarios, achieving strong performance. However, traditional DPO relies on binary preference optimization, rewarding or penalizing entire responses without considering fine-grained segment correctness, leading to suboptimal solutions. The root of this issue lies in the absence of fine-grained supervision during the optimization process. To address this, we propose Adaptive Sentence-level Preference Optimization (ASPO), which evaluates individual sentences for more precise preference optimization. By dynamically calculating adaptive rewards at the sentence level based on model predictions, ASPO enhances response content assessment without additional models or parameters. This significantly improves the alignment of multimodal features. Extensive experiments show that ASPO... | Yeyuan Wang, Dehong Gao, Rujiao Long, Lei Yi, Linbo Jin, Libin Yang, Xiaoyan Cai |  |

Presently available CR datasets are either small in scale or restrict coreference resolution to a limited text span. In this paper, we present NovelCR, a large-scale bilingual benchmark designed for long-span coreference resolution. NovelCR features extensive annotations, including 148k mentions in NovelCR-en and 311k mentions in NovelCR-zh. Moreover, the dataset is notably rich in long-span coreference pairs, with 85% of pairs in NovelCR-en and 83% in NovelCR-zh spanning across three or more sentences. Experiments on NovelCR reveal a large gap between state-of-the-art baselines and human performance, highlighting that NovelCR remains an open issue. | Meihan Tong, Shuai Wang |  |

Our analysis reveals a strong correlation between token-level uncertainty and hallucinations. We hypothesize that attention mechanisms inherently encode context utilization signals, supported by probing analysis. Based on these insights, we propose Dynamic Attention-Guided Context Decoding (DAGCD), a lightweight framework that leverages attention distributions and uncertainty signals in a single-pass decoding. Experiments on open-book QA datasets demonstrate DAGCD’s effectiveness, yielding significant improvements in faithfulness and robustness while preserving computational efficiency. | Huangyw Huangyw, Yong Zhang, Ning Cheng, Zhitao Li, Shaojun Wang, Jing Xiao |  |

However, the mechanisms behind LLMs’ choice behavior remain unclear, posing risks in safety-critical situations. Inspired by the intrinsic and extrinsic motivation framework within the classic human behavioral model of Self-Determination Theory and its established research methodologies, we investigate the factors influencing LLMs’ choice behavior by constructing a virtual QA platform that includes three different experimental conditions, with four models from GPT and Llama series participating in repeated experiments. Our findings indicate that LLMs’ behavior is influenced not only by intrinsic attention bias but also by extrinsic social influence, exhibiting patterns similar to the Matthew effect and Conformity. We distinguish independent pathways of these two factors in LLMs’ behavior by self-report. This work provides new insights into understanding... | Weidong Wu, Qinlin Zhao, Hao Chen, Lexin Zhou, Defu Lian, Hong Xie |  |

To address this critical issue, previous learning-based methods attempt to finetune models but are limited by off-policy sampling and coarse-grained feedback. In this paper, we present Reinforcement Learning for Hallucination (RLFH), an on-policy self-alignment approach that enables LLMs to actively explore their knowledge boundaries and self-correct generation behavior through fine-grained feedback signals. RLFH introduces a self-assessment framework where the policy serves as its own judge. Through this framework, responses are automatically decomposed into atomic facts and their truthfulness and informativeness are assessed against external knowledge sources. The resulting fine-grained feedback at the statement level are then converted into token-level dense reward signals. This enables online reinforcement learning to achieve precise and... | Xueru Wen, Jie Lou, Xinyu Lu, Yuqiu Ji, Xinyan Guan, Yaojie Lu, Hongyu Lin, Ben He, Xianpei Han, Debing Zhang, Le Sun |  |

Semantic parsing (SP), previously a mainstream approach for KGQA, enables precise graph pattern matching by mapping natural language queries to executable logical forms. However, it faces limitations in scalability and generalization, especially when dealing with complex, multi-hop reasoning tasks.In this work, we propose a Fine-Grained Semantic Parsing (FGSP) framework for KGQA. Our framework constructs a fine-grained mapping library via phrase-level segmentation of historical question-logical form pairs, and performs online retrieval and fusion of relevant subgraph fragments to answer complex queries. This fine-grained, compositional approach ensures tighter semantic alignment between questions and knowledge graph structures, enhancing both interpretability and adaptability... | Yurun Song, Xiangqing Shen, Rui Xia |  |

However, existing tool environments face challenges in balancing stability, scale, and realism, particularly for benchmarking purposes. To address this, we propose MirrorAPI, a novel framework that trains specialized LLMs to accurately simulate real API responses, effectively acting as “mirrors” to tool environments. Using a comprehensive dataset of request-response pairs from 7,000+ APIs, we employ supervised fine-tuning and chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance simulation fidelity. MirrorAPI achieves superior accuracy and stability compared to state-of-the-art methods, as demonstrated by its performance on the newly constructed MirrorAPI-Bench and its integration into StableToolBench. | Zhicheng Guo, Sijie Cheng, Yuchen Niu, Hao Wang, Sicheng Zhou, Wenbing Huang, Yang Liu |  |

While KGs provide structured, semantically rich representations well-suited for reasoning, most existing verification methods rely on unstructured text corpora, limiting their ability to effectively leverage KGs. Additionally, despite possessing strong reasoning abilities, modern LLMs struggle with multi-step modular pipelines and reasoning over KGs without adaptation. To address these challenges, we propose ClaimPKG, an end-to-end framework that seamlessly integrates LLM reasoning with structured knowledge from KGs. Specifically, the main idea of ClaimPKG is to employ a lightweight, specialized LLM to represent the input claim as pseudo-subgraphs, guiding a dedicated subgraph retrieval module to identify relevant KG subgraphs. These retrieved subgraphs are then processed by a general-purpose LLM to produce the final verdict... | Hoang Pham, ThanhDo Nguyen, KhacHoai Nam Bui |  |

It inherently discards linguistic relations between tokens during tokenization, creating a fundamental gap. To address this, we propose TriEmbed, a reparameterization method for embeddings that incorporates the morphological relationships inherent in subword tokenizer algorithms. Specifically, by organizing the vocabulary into a Trie structure, we can encode these relations and reparametrize the embeddings, facilitating the recovery of other linguistic relationships during training. Empirical results across various settings demonstrate that TriEmbed outperforms conventional embeddings from the perspective of scaling, while offering more linguistically informative token embeddings. | Baizhou Huang, Xiaojun Wan |  |

This paper introduces the Chain of Methodologies (CoM), a simple and innovative iterative prompting framework designed to build structured reasoning processes by injecting human methodological insights, thereby enabling LLMs to perform long and effective reasoning for complex tasks. Assuming that LLMs possess certain metacognitive abilities, CoM leverages user-defined methodologies to stimulate the cognitive insights that LLMs have learned implicitly from training data. Experimental results indicate that CoM outperforms competitive baselines, highlighting the potential of training-free prompting methods as general solutions for complex reasoning tasks and the possibility of incorporating human-like methodological insights to bridge the gap to human-level reasoning. | Cong Liu, Jie Wu, Weigang Wu, Xu Chen, Liang Lin, WeiShi Zheng |  |

Current alignment techniques adopt a one-size-fits-all approach that fails to accommodate users’ diverse backgrounds and needs. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of personalized alignment—a paradigm that enables LLMs to adapt their behavior within ethical boundaries based on individual preferences. We propose a unified framework comprising preference memory management, personalized generation, and feedback-based alignment, systematically analyzing implementation approaches and evaluating their effectiveness across various scenarios. By examining current techniques, potential risks, and future challenges, this survey provides a structured foundation for developing more adaptable and ethically-aligned LLMs. | Jian Guan, Junfei Wu, JiaNan Li, Chuanqi Cheng, Wei Wu |  |

However, existing LoRA’s shared parameter space paradigm introduces parameter interference, leading to a gap in generalization performance for specific tasks compared to full fine-tuning. To address this issue, we propose a parameter-separated low-rank adapter, called Subspace Low-Rank Adaptation (SuLoRA). The core idea of SuLoRA is to account for task differences by decomposing LoRA’s parameter matrix into multiple independent subspaces and assigning them differentially to distinct tasks. This prevents interference across tasks and enhances the effectiveness of low-rank adaptation. Additionally, SuLoRA achieves higher rank expansion by freezing the A matrix, further improving generalization... | Chenhao Ding, Jiangyang Li, Songlin Dong, Xinyuan Gao, Yuhang He, Yihong Gong |  |

They often directly fuse the two modalities for cross-reference during the alignment to understand multimodal queries. However, existing methods often overlook crucial visual information due to a text-dominant issue, which overly depends on text-driven signals. In this paper, we introduce MIRe, a retrieval framework that achieves modality interaction without fusing textual features during the alignment. Our method allows the textual query to attend to visual embeddings while not feeding text-driven signals back into the visual representations. Additionally, we construct a pre-training dataset for multimodal query retrieval by transforming concise question-answer pairs into extended passages. Our experiments demonstrate that our pre-training strategy significantly enhances the understanding of multimodal queries, resulting... | YeongJoon Ju, HoJoong Kim, SeongWhan Lee |  |

As a result, effectively parsing such questions and establishing an efficient interaction channel between large language models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs (KGs) is essential for ensuring reliable reasoning. In this paper, we present a novel semantic parsing framework Correcting on Graph (CoG), aiming to establish faithful logical queries that connect LLMs and KGs. We first propose a structured knowledge decoding that enables the LLM to generate fact-aware logical queries during inference, while leveraging its parametric knowledge to fill in the blank intermediate entities. Then, we introduce a knowledge path correction that combines the logical query with KGs to correct hallucination entities and path deficiencies in the generated content, ensuring the reliability and comprehensiveness of the retrieved knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoG outperforms the state-of-the-art KGQA methods on... | Ruilin Zhao, Feng Zhao, Hong Zhang |  |

However, RLHF’s complex process limits its ability to continually learn human feedback, making it impractical for real-world applications where the deployed model continuously receives feedback from users. The non-RL-based method, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), is not primitively favorable for Continual Learning (CL). We observe that when combined with Experiment Relay (ER) for CL, DPO tends to significantly widen the gap in the probability of human-preferred and dispreferred responses. Consequently, this diminishes the diversity in model generation, potentially leading to model collapse. To overcome the above challenges, we propose the Continual Optimal Policy Regularization (COPR), a novel non-RL offline method to convert the historical optimal policies into optimization constraints when continually learning new preferences. We first derive... | Han Zhang, Lin Gui, Yu Lei, Yuanzhao Zhai, Yehong Zhang, Zhuo Zhang, Yulan He, Hui Wang, Yue Yu, KamFai Wong, Bin Liang, Ruifeng Xu |  |

Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an efficient method that directly optimizes models using preference pairs, significantly reducing resource demands. However, the effectiveness of DPO heavily depends on the data quality, which is frequently compromised by noise. In this work, we propose 𝛾-PO, a dynamic target margin preference optimization algorithm that adjust reward margins at the pairwise level. By introducing instance-specific margin calibration, 𝛾-PO strategically prioritizes high-confidence pairs (those demonstrating higher reward margins) while suppressing potential noise from ambiguous pairs. Moreover, 𝛾-PO is a plug-and-play method, compatible with variants of DPO that rely on reward margin between preference pairs. Across benchmarks such as AlpacaEval2 and Arena-Hard, 𝛾-PO achieves an average 4.4% improvement over other baselines,... | Jie Sun, Junkang Wu, Jiancan Wu, Zhibo Zhu, Xingyu Lu, Jun Zhou, Lintao Ma, Xiang Wang |  |

Recent methods compress videos by leveraging visual redundancy uniformly, yielding promising results. Nevertheless, our quantitative analysis shows that redundancy varies significantly across time and model layers, necessitating a more flexible compression strategy. We propose \*\*AdaReTaKe\*\*, a training-free method that flexibly reduces visual redundancy by allocating compression ratios among time and layers with theoretical guarantees. Integrated into state-of-the-art MLLMs, AdaReTaKe improves processing capacity from 256 to 2048 frames while preserving critical information. Experiments on VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench, and LVBench datasets demonstrate that AdaReTaKe outperforms existing methods by 2.3% and 2.8% for 7B and 72B models, respectively, with even greater improvements of 5.9% and 6.0% on the longest LVBench. | Xiao Wang, Qingyi Si, Shiyu Zhu, Jianlong Wu, Li Cao, Liqiang Nie |  |

To fulfill this gap, we propose DialogTool, a multi-turn dialogue dataset with stateful tool interactions considering the whole life cycle of tool use, across six key tasks in three stages: 1) tool creation; 2) tool utilization: tool awareness, tool selection, tool execution; and 3) role-consistent response: response generation and role play. Furthermore, we build VirtualMobile – an embodied virtual mobile evaluation environment to simulate API calls and assess the robustness of the created APIs. Taking advantage of these artifacts, we conduct comprehensive evaluation on 13 distinct open- and closed-source LLMs and provide detailed analysis at each stage, revealing that the existing... | Hongru Wang, Wenyu Huang, Yufei Wang, Yuanhao Xi, Jianqiao Lu, Huan Zhang, Nan Hu, Zeming Liu, Jeff Z.

On life service platforms like Meituan, user purchases are driven by living needs, making accurate living need predictions crucial for personalized service recommendations. Traditional approaches treat this prediction as a closed-set classification problem, severely limiting their ability to capture the diversity and complexity of living needs. In this work, we redefine living need prediction as an open-set classification problem and propose PIGEON, a novel system leveraging large language models (LLMs) for unrestricted need prediction. PIGEON first employs a behavior-aware record retriever to help LLMs understand user preferences, then incorporates Maslow’s hierarchy of needs to align predictions with human living needs. For evaluation and application, we design a recall module based on a fine-tuned text embedding model that links flexible need descriptions to appropriate life services.... | Xiaochong Lan, Jie Feng, Yizhou Sun, Chen Gao, Jiahuan Lei, Xinleishi Xinleishi, Hengliang Luo, Yong Li |  |

Vanilla retrieval methods using sparse or dense retrievers to directly search for relevant rules to support downstream reasoning, often suffer from low accuracy. This is primarily due to a significant semantic gap between the instantiated facts in the queries and the abstract representations of the rules. Such misalignment results in suboptimal retrieval quality, which in turn negatively impacts reasoning performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose Self-Induction Augmented Retrieval (SIAR), a novel approach that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to induce potential inferential rules that might offer benefits for reasoning by abstracting the underlying knowledge and logical structure in queries. These induced rules are then used for query augmentation to improve retrieval effectiveness. Additionally, we introduce Rule Relevance ReEstimate (R3), a method that re-estimates... | Ziyang Huang, Wangtao Sun, Jun Zhao, Kang Liu |  |

A key enabler of this communication is the human capacity for Theory of Mind (ToM)—the ability to infer and align with the mental states of others. ToM is usually modeled as components of desires, beliefs, and intentions. Research in linguistics and psychology has shown that people oftentimes reveal their ToM through pragmatic aspects of language. Considering the advancements in natural language generation and perception that Large Language Models (LLMs) have made in recent years, a critical question arises in relation to ToM: can LLM-powered agents develop similar abilities for inferring mental states during natural language communication? This study investigates the extent to which open-source LLaMA models can represent and retain ToM-related constructs, and whether these internal representations contribute to a coherent mental state modeling in a given conversation. Additionally,... | Mehdi Jafari, Yuncheng Hua, Hao Xue, Flora D. Salim |  |

However, will these causalities remain straightforward when crucial hints hide in visual details? If not, what factors might influence cross-modal generalization? Whether we can effectively enhance their capacity for robust causal inference across both text and vision? Motivated by these, we introduce \*\*MuCR\*\* - a novel \*\*Mu\*\*ltimodal \*\*C\*\*ausal \*\*R\*\*easoning benchmark that leverages synthetic siamese images and text pairs to challenge MLLMs. Additionally, we develop tailored metrics from multiple perspectives, including image-level match, phrase-level understanding, and sentence-level explanation, to comprehensively assess MLLMs’ comprehension abilities.

Although it helps address the limitations of large language models (LLMs) with fixed input length constraints, the recursive merging process can amplify LLM hallucinations, increasing the risk of factual inaccuracies. In this paper, we seek to mitigate hallucinations by enriching hierarchical merging with context from the source document. Specifically, we propose different approaches to contextual augmentation ranging from \*replacing\* intermediate summaries with relevant input context, to \*refining\* them while using the context as supporting evidence, and \*aligning\* them implicitly (via citations) to the input. Experimental results on datasets representing legal and narrative domains show that contextual augmentation... | Litu Ou, Mirella Lapata |  |

While commonsense knowledge bases like ConceptNet provide structured collections of general facts, they lack visually grounded representations. Scene graph datasets like Visual Genome, though rich in object-level descriptions, primarily focus on directly observable information and lack systematic categorization of commonsense knowledge. We present Visual Commonsense Dataset (VCD), a large-scale dataset containing over 100,000 images and 14 million object-commonsense pairs that bridges this gap. VCD introduces a novel three-level taxonomy for visual commonsense, integrating both Seen (directly observable) and Unseen (inferrable) commonsense across Property, Action, and Space aspects. Each commonsense is represented as a triple where the head entity is grounded to object bounding boxes in images, enabling scene-dependent and object-specific visual commonsense representation.

These longer intermediate reasoning rationales embody various meta-reasoning skills in human cognition such as reflection and decomposition, being difficult to create and acquire. In this work, we introduce Self-Reasoning Language Model (SRLM), where the model itself can synthesize longer CoT data and iteratively improve performance through self-training. By incorporating a few demonstration examples (i.e., 1,000 samples) on how to unfold hidden reasoning chains from existing responses, which act as a reasoning catalyst, we demonstrate that SRLM not only enhances the model’s initial performance but also ensures more stable and consistent improvements in subsequent iterations. Our proposed SRLM achieves an average absolute improvement of more than +2.5 points across five reasoning tasks:... | Hongru Wang, Deng Cai, Wanjun Zhong, Shijue Huang, Jeff Z.

Most existing methods primarily aim to analyze filter bubbles in the relatively static recommendation environment. Nevertheless, the filter bubble phenomenon continues to exacerbate as users interact with the system over time. To address these issues, we propose a novel paradigm, Hypergraph-Aware Multi-Grained Preference Learning to Burst Filter Bubbles in Conversational Recommendation System (HyperCRS), aiming to burst filter bubbles by learning multi-grained user preferences during the dynamic user-system interactions via natural language conversations. HyperCRS develops Multi-Grained Hypergraph (user-, item-, and attribute-grained) to explore diverse relations and capture high-order connectivity.

Disagreement samples, which arise from subjective interpretations, pose a unique challenge due to their ambiguous nature. Understanding how LLMs process these cases, particularly their confidence levels, can offer insight into their alignment with human annotators. This study systematically evaluates the performance of multiple LLMs in detecting offensive language at varying levels of annotation agreement. We analyze binary classification accuracy, examine the relationship between model confidence and human disagreement, and explore how disagreement samples influence model decision-making during few-shot learning and instruction fine-tuning. Our findings reveal that LLMs struggle with low-agreement samples, often exhibiting overconfidence in these ambiguous cases. However, utilizing disagreement samples in training improves... | Junyu Lu, Kai Ma, Kaichun Wang, Kelaiti Xiao, Roy KaWei Lee, Bo Xu, Liang Yang, Hongfei Lin |  |

This becomes critical, especially in applications such as long-form video understanding. In this paper, we introduce a Language Repository (LangRepo) for LLMs, that maintains concise and structured information as an interpretable (i.e., all-textual) representation. Our repository is updated iteratively based on multi-scale video chunks. We introduce write and read operations that focus on pruning redundancies in text, and extracting information at various temporal scales. The proposed framework is evaluated on zero-shot visual question-answering benchmarks, showing state-of-the-art performance at its scale.

However, mRAG systems struggle with retrieving relevant information due to linguistic variations between queries and documents, generating inconsistent responses when multilingual sources conflict. In this work, we systematically investigate language preferences in both retrieval and generation of mRAG through a series of experiments. Our analysis indicates that retrievers tend to prefer high-resource and query languages, yet this preference does not consistently improve generation performance. Moreover, we observe that generators prefer the query language or Latin scripts, leading to inconsistent outputs. To overcome these issues, we propose Dual Knowledge Multilingual RAG (DKM-RAG), a simple yet effective framework that fuses translated multilingual passages with complementary model knowledge.

To keep LLMs current, existing approaches typically involve continued pre-training on new documents. However, they frequently face difficulties in extracting stored knowledge. Motivated by the remarkable success of the Feynman Technique in efficient human learning, we introduce Self-Tuning, a learning framework aimed at improving an LLM’s ability to effectively acquire new knowledge from unseen raw documents through self-teaching. Specifically, we develop a Self-Teaching strategy that augments the documents with a set of knowledge-intensive tasks created in a self-supervised manner, focusing on three crucial aspects: memorization, comprehension, and self-reflection. Additionally, we introduce three Wiki-Newpages-2023-QA datasets to facilitate an in-depth analysis of an LLM’s knowledge acquisition ability concerning memorization,... | Xiaoying Zhang, Baolin Peng, Ye Tian, Jingyan Zhou, Yipeng Zhang, Haitao Mi, Helen M.

Unfortunately, LLMs face significant security and ethical risks. Although techniques such as safety alignment are developed for defense, prior researches reveal the possibility of bypassing such defenses through well-designed jailbreak attacks. In this paper, we propose QueryAttack, a novel framework to examine the generalizability of safety alignment. By treating LLMs as knowledge databases, we translate malicious queries in natural language into structured non-natural query language to bypass the safety alignment mechanisms of LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on mainstream LLMs, and the results show that QueryAttack not only can achieve high attack success rates (ASRs), but also can jailbreak various defense methods. Furthermore, we tailor a defense method against QueryAttack, which can reduce ASR by up to 64% on GPT-4-1106.

Explore How LLMs Compute Mixed Arithmetic Expressions](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.299/) |  | 0 | Large language models (LLMs) can solve complex multi-step math reasoning problems, but little is known about how these computations are implemented internally. Many recent studies have investigated the mechanisms of LLMs on simple arithmetic tasks (e.g., a+b, a× b), but how LLMs solve mixed arithmetic tasks still remains unexplored. This gap highlights the limitation of these findings in reflecting real-world scenarios. In this work, we take a step further to explore how LLMs compute mixed arithmetic expressions. We find that LLMs follow a similar workflow to mixed arithmetic calculations: first parsing the complete expression, then using attention heads to aggregate information to the last token position for result generation, without step-by-step reasoning at the token dimension. However, \*\*for some specific expressions, the model generates the final result depends on the generation of intermediate results at the last token position, which is similar to human thinking.\*\*... | Chengzhi Li, Heyan Huang, Ping Jian, Zhen Yang, Chenxu Wang, Yifan Wang |  |

High-quality user profiles are essential for aligning agent behavior with real user interests. Typically, these profiles are constructed by leveraging LLMs for user profile modeling (LLM-UM). However, this process faces several challenges: (1) LLMs struggle with long user behaviors due to context length limitations and performance degradation. (2) Existing methods often extract only partial segments from full historical behavior sequence, inevitably discarding diverse user interests embedded in the omitted content, leading to incomplete modeling and suboptimal profiling. (3) User profiling is often tightly coupled with the inference context, requiring online processing, which introduces significant latency overhead. In this paper, we propose PersonaX, an agent-agnostic LLM-UM framework to address these challenges. It augments downstream... | Yunxiao Shi, Wujiang Xu, Zeqi Zhang, Xing Zi, Qiang Wu, Min Xu |  |

However, existing automated evaluation metrics cannot fairly evaluate the outputs generated by RAG models during training and evaluation. LLM-based judgment models provide the potential to produce high-quality judgments, but they are highly sensitive to evaluation prompts, leading to inconsistencies when judging the output of RAG models. This paper introduces the Judge-Consistency (ConsJudge) method, which aims to enhance LLMs to generate more accurate evaluations for RAG models. Specifically, ConsJudge prompts LLMs to generate different judgments based on various combinations of judgment dimensions, utilizes the judge-consistency to evaluate these judgments, and selects the chosen and rejected judgments for DPO training. Our experiments show that ConsJudge can effectively provide more accurate judgments for optimizing RAG models across various RAG models... | Shuliang Liu, Xinze Li, Zhenghao Liu, Yukun Yan, Cheng Yang, Zheni Zeng, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun, Ge Yu |  |

In this paper, we identify that such a prevailing view does not hold consistently. We conduct comprehensive investigations to thoroughly inspect the impact of rationales on model performance as well as a novel perspective of model reliability. The results lead to several key findings that add new insights upon existing understandings: 1) Rationales can, at times, deteriorate model performance; 2) Rationales can, at times, improve model reliability, even outperforming their untrained counterparts; 3) A linear correspondence exists in between the performance and reliability improvements, while both are driven by the intrinsic difficulty of the task. These findings provide informative regulations on the broad utilization of rationales and raise critical implications on the procedure of explicitly aligning language models with implicit human thoughts.

Recent techniques, such as Generation-Augmented Retrieval (GAR) and Generative Document Retrieval (GDR), leverage LLMs to enhance retrieval but face key challenges: GAR’s generated content may not always align with the target document corpus, while GDR limits the generative capacity of LLMs by constraining outputs to predefined document identifiers. To address these issues, we propose Context-Aware Generation-Augmented Retrieval (CA-GAR), which enhances LLMs by integrating corpus information into their generation process. CA-GAR optimizes token selection by incorporating relevant document information and leverages a Distribution Alignment Strategy to extract corpus information using a lexicon-based approach. Experimental evaluations on seven tasks from the BEIR benchmark and four non-English languages from Mr.TyDi demonstrate that CA-GAR... | Heng Yu, Junfeng Kang, Rui Li, Qi Liu, Liyang He, Zhenya Huang, Shuanghong Shen, Junyu Lu |  |

While remarkable success has been made in the era of large language models (LLMs), current research still focuses on the simple no-library or single-library setting, ignoring the complex multi-library scenario in real-world applications. To address this limitation, we make the first attempt to introduce MLDebugging (Multi-Library Debugging), a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess debugging challenges within multi-library Python code. Specifically, MLDebugging encompasses 126 distinct Python libraries, covering a wide range of multi-library code issues, categorized into seven distinct types. Furthermore, we conduct a thorough evaluation of MLDebugging using both mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs and highlight that current LLMs still struggle to correctly perform code debugging across multi-library scenarios.

While the fine-tuned judge models are claimed to achieve comparable evaluation capability with GPT-4, in this work, we conduct an empirical study of LLM-as-a-Judge. Our findings indicate that although the fine-tuned judge models achieve high performance on in-domain test sets, even surpassing GPT-4, they underperform GPT-4 across several dimensions, including generalizability, fairness and adaptability. We also reveal that the fine-tuned judge model inherently operates as a task-specific classifier, consequently imposing the limitations. | Hui Huang, Xingyuan Bu, Hongli Zhou, Yingqi Qu, Jing Liu, Muyun Yang, Bing Xu, Tiejun Zhao |  |

However, these agents often generate short-sighted responses that fail to sustain user guidance and meet expectations. Although preference optimization has proven effective in aligning LLMs with user expectations, it remains costly and performs poorly in multi-turn dialogue. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel multi-turn preference optimization (MTPO) paradigm \*\*ECPO\*\*, which leverages Expectation Confirmation Theory to explicitly model the evolution of user satisfaction throughout multi-turn dialogues, uncovering the underlying causes of dissatisfaction. These causes can be utilized to support targeted optimization of unsatisfactory responses, thereby achieving turn-level preference optimization.

In clinical practice, dynamic time series data, such as lab test results, capture critical temporal patterns, while clinical notes provide rich semantic context. Merging these modalities is challenging due to the inherent differences between continuous signals and discrete text. To bridge this gap, we introduce ProMedTS, a novel self-supervised multimodal framework that employs prompt-guided learning to unify these heterogeneous data types. Our approach leverages lightweight anomaly detection to generate anomaly captions that serve as prompts, guiding the encoding of raw time series data into informative prompt embeddings. These prompt embeddings are aligned with textual representations in a shared latent space, preserving fine-grained... | Shuai Niu, Jing Ma, Hongzhan Lin, Liang Bai, Zhihua Wang, Wei Bi, Richard Yi Da Xu, Guo Li, Xian Yang |  |

Despite these impressive achievements in mathematics and coding, the reasoning abilities of LLMs in domains requiring cryptographic expertise remain underexplored. In this paper, we introduce CipherBank, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in cryptographic decryption tasks. CipherBank comprises 2,358 meticulously crafted problems, covering 262 unique plaintexts across 5 domains and 14 subdomains, with a focus on privacy-sensitive and real-world scenarios that necessitate encryption. From a cryptographic perspective, CipherBank incorporates 3 major categories of encryption methods, spanning 9 distinct algorithms, ranging from classical ciphers to custom cryptographic techniques.

A Case Study on Entity Unlearning](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.310/) |  | 0 | Large language models (LLMs) risk retaining unauthorized or sensitive information from their training data, which raises privacy concerns. LLM unlearning seeks to mitigate these risks by selectively removing specified data while maintaining overall model performance. However, most existing work focuses on methods to achieve effective forgetting and does not provide a detailed analysis of the retain set, the portion of training data that is not targeted for removal. In this paper, we investigate the effects of unlearning on various subsets of the retain set through a case study on entity unlearning. We introduce the Syntactically Similar Neighbor Set, a group of queries that share similar syntactic structures with the data targeted for removal, and show that this subset suffers the greatest performance drop during unlearning. Moreover, when used for regularization, this set not only preserves performance on syntactically similar queries but also delivers comparable or improved results... | Hwan Chang, Hwanhee Lee |  |

To investigate RPAs’ performance when faced with different types of conflicting requests, we develop an evaluation benchmark that includes contextual knowledge conflicting requests, parametric knowledge conflicting requests, and non-conflicting requests to assess RPAs’ ability to identify conflicts and refuse to answer appropriately without over-refusing. Through extensive evaluation, we find that most RPAs behave significant performance gaps toward different conflict requests. To elucidate the reasons, we conduct an in-depth representation-level analysis of RPAs under various conflict scenarios. Our findings reveal the existence of rejection regions and direct response regions within the model’s forwarding representation, and thus influence the RPA’s final response behavior.... | Wenhao Liu, Siyu An, Junru Lu, Muling Wu, Tianlong Li, Xiaohua Wang, Changze Lv, Xiaoqing Zheng, Di Yin, Xing Sun, Xuanjing Huang |  |

However, effectively evaluating such reflection capabilities remains challenging due to the lack of appropriate benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce LR2Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the Long-chain Reflective Reasoning capabilities of LLMs. LR2Bench comprises 850 samples across six Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) where reflective reasoning is crucial for deriving solutions that meet all given constraints. Each type of task focuses on distinct constraint patterns, such as knowledge-based, logical, and spatial constraints, providing a comprehensive evaluation of diverse problem-solving scenarios.

Therefore, measuring biases in LLMs is crucial to mitigate its ethical risks. However, most existing bias evaluation datasets are focus on English andNorth American culture, and their bias categories are not fully applicable to other cultures. The datasets grounded in the Chinese language and culture are scarce. More importantly, these datasets usually only support single evaluation task and cannot evaluate the bias from multiple aspects in LLMs. To address these issues, we present a Multi-task Chinese Bias Evaluation Benchmark (McBE) that includes 4,077 bias evaluation instances, covering 12 single bias categories, 82 subcategories and introducing 5 evaluation tasks, providing extensive category coverage, content diversity, and measuring comprehensiveness.

Although graph neural networks (GNNs) have been proposed to solve this problem, their performance is usually limited when uncertain nodes are near the cluster boundaries due to label scarcity. In this paper, we introduce a new perspective of leveraging large language models (LLMs) to enhance text-attributed graph clustering and develop a novel approach named Multi-agent Collaboration with Ranking Guidance (MARK). The core of our MARK is to generate reliable guidance using the collaboration of three LLM-based agents as ranking-based supervision signals. In particular, we first conduct the coarse graph clustering, and utilize a concept agent to induce the semantics of each cluster. Then, we infer the robustness under perturbations to identify uncertain nodes and use a generation agent to produce synthetic text... | Yiwei Fu, Yuxing Zhang, Chunchun Chen, JianwenMa JianwenMa, Quan Yuan, RongCheng Tu, Xinli Huang, Wei Ye, Xiao Luo, Minghua Deng |  |

Although summaries generated by these large language models are smooth and capture key information sufficiently, the quality of their output depends on the prompt, and the generated text is somewhat procedural to a certain extent. We construct LecSumm to verify whether language models truly capture human writing preferences, in which we recruit 200 college students to write summaries for lecture notes on ten different machine-learning topics and analyze writing preferences in real-world human summaries through the dimensions of length, content depth, tone & style, and summary format. We define the method of capturing human writing preferences by language models as finetuning pre-trained models with data and designing prompts to optimize the output of large language models.

To mitigating this, we first explore the micro-level manifestations of position bias, concluding that attention weights are a micro-level expression of position bias. Then we identify that, in addition to position embeddings, positional information in hidden states also contributes to position bias, and it manifests itself in specific channels of hidden states, called positional hidden states. Based on these, we propose a method to mitigate position bias by scaling positional hidden states. Experiments on NaturalQuestions Multi-document QA, KV retrieval and LongBench, using various models including RoPE models, context window-extended models, and Alibi models, demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.

Traditional Chain-of-Thought-based methods typically generate the reasoning path in a chain structure, leading to unnecessary interference caused by non-zero self-attention among weakly related reasoning steps. Such a setting also differs from humans’ typical graph-structured reasoning habit (with an inter-step relationship graph in mind). To solve the problem, this paper proposes a novel decoding method for Transformer-based LLM, named Self-attention-based Graph-of-Thought (SaGoT). SaGoT constructs a thought graph simultaneously as an LLM inference (based on a newly defined inter-step self-attention indicator), and generates reasoning steps with a novel graph-structured self-attention mechanism. It is a significant contribution for SaGoT to enable an LLM’s graph-like reasoning ability by modifying its inner working operations, compared to SOTA prompting methods that are... | Ruiqiao Bai, Xue Han, Shuo Lei, Junlan Feng, Yanyan Luo, Chao Deng |  |

To complete a task, the agent needs to decompose it into easily executed steps by planning. Existing studies mainly conduct the planning by inferring what steps should be executed next starting from the agent’s initial state. However, this forward reasoning paradigm doesn’t work well for complex tasks. We propose to study this issue in Minecraft, a virtual environment that simulates complex tasks based on real-world scenarios. We believe that the failure of forward reasoning is caused by the big perception gap between the agent’s initial state and task goal. To this end, we leverage backward reasoning and make the planning starting from the terminal state, which can directly achieve the task goal in one step. Specifically, we design a backward reasoning based agent (BAR). It is equipped with a recursive goal decomposition module, a state... | Weihong Du, Wenrui Liao, Binyu Yan, Hongru Liang, Anthony G.

In real-world conversational interactions, however, user queries are often volatile, ambiguous, and diverse, making it difficult accurately and efficiently grasp the user’s underlying intentions. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective deliberative agent framework that leverages human thought process to build high-level domain knowledge. To further achieve efficient knowledge accumulation and retrieval, we design a tree-structured knowledge base to store refined experience and data. Moreover, we construct a new benchmark, User-Intent-Understanding (UIU), which covers multi-domain, multi-tone, and sequential multi-turn personalized user queries. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method across multi-step evaluations. | Jiakai Tang, Shiqi Shen, Zhipeng Wang, Gong Zhi, Xueyang Feng, Zexu Sun, Haoran Tan, Xu Chen |  |

Current approaches for obtaining draft tokens rely on lightweight draft models or additional model structures to generate draft tokens and retrieve context from databases. Due to the draft model’s small size and limited training data, model-based speculative decoding frequently becomes less effective in out-of-domain scenarios. Additionally, the time cost of the drafting phase results in a low upper limit on acceptance length during the verification step, limiting overall efficiency. This paper proposes RASD (Retrieval-Augmented Speculative Decoding), which adopts retrieval methods to enhance model-based speculative decoding. We introduce tree pruning and tree fusion to achieve this. Specifically, we develop a pruning method based on the draft model’s probability distribution to construct the optimal retrieval tree. Second, we employ the longest prefix... | Guofeng Quan, Wenfeng Feng, Chuzhan Hao, Guochao Jiang, Yuewei Zhang, Hao Henry Wang |  |

Modular methods prioritize flexibility by avoiding the use of KG-fine-tuned models during retrieval, leading to fixed retrieval strategies and suboptimal retrieval quality. Conversely, coupled methods embed KG information within models to improve retrieval quality but at the expense of flexibility.In this paper, we propose a novel flexible modular KG-RAG framework, termed FRAG, which synergizes the advantages of both approaches. FRAG estimates the hop range of reasoning paths based solely on the query and classifies it as either simple or complex.To match the complexity of the query, tailored pipelines are applied to ensure efficient and... | Zengyi Gao, Yukun Cao, Hairu Wang, Ao Ke, Yuan Feng, S.

Current benchmarks for relation hallucinations lack detailed evaluation and effective mitigation, and their datasets often suffer from biases due to systematic annotation processes. To address these challenges, we introduce Reefknot, a comprehensive benchmark targeting relation hallucinations, comprising over 20,000 real-world samples. We provide a systematic definition of relation hallucinations, integrating perceptive and cognitive perspectives, and construct a relation-based corpus using the Visual Genome scene graph dataset. Our comparative evaluation reveals significant limitations in current MLLMs’ ability to handle relation hallucinations. Additionally, we propose a novel confidence-based mitigation strategy, which reduces the... | Kening Zheng, Junkai Chen, Yibo Yan, Xin Zou, Huiyu Zhou, Xuming Hu |  |

Among several prompting strategies aiming at bridging the gap, multilingual in-context learning (ICL) has been particularly effective when demonstration in target languages is unavailable. However, there lacks a systematic understanding when and why it works well.In this work, we systematically analyze multilingual ICL, using demonstrations in HRLs to enhance cross-lingual transfer. We show that demonstrations in mixed HRLs consistently outperform English-only ones across the board, particularly for tasks written in LRLs. Surprisingly, our ablation study show that the presence of irrelevant non-English sentences in the prompt yields measurable gains, suggesting the effectiveness of multilingual exposure itself. Our results highlight the potential of strategically... | Yilei Tu, Andrew Xue, Freda Shi |  |

Despite the remarkable success, we observed that LLMs often misunderstand or overlook some problem-specific undertrained keywords during code generation, compromising the accuracy of the generated code. After explicitly explaining these undertrained keywords using well-trained terms in the prompt, LLMs are more likely to generate correct code implementation. Inspired by this observation, we propose a novel technique named SEK(Self-Explained Keywords), which empowers an LLM for better code generation by extracting and explaining the key terms in the problem description with the LLM itself. Comprehensive experiments across four benchmarks, i.e., HumanEval(+), MBPP(+), APPS and BigCodeBench, with five representative LLMs, show that SEK can significantly improve LLMs in code generation, yielding substantial and consistent gains. For instance, SEK improves the Pass@1 of DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Instruct from... | Lishui Fan, Mouxiang Chen, Zhongxin Liu |  |

Unleashing Safety Potential of LLMs via Self-Aware Guard Enhancement](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.325/) |  | 0 | Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across various tasks but remain vulnerable to meticulously crafted jailbreak attacks. In this paper, we identify a critical safety gap: while LLMs are adept at detecting jailbreak prompts, they often produce unsafe responses when directly processing these inputs. Inspired by this insight, we propose SAGE(Self-Aware Guard Enhancement), a training-free defense strategy designed to align LLMs’ strong safety discrimination performance with their relatively weaker safety generation ability. SAGE consists of two core components: a Discriminative Analysis Module and a Discriminative Response Module, enhancing resilience against sophisticated jailbreak attempts through flexible safety discrimination instructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate SAGE’s effectiveness and robustness across various open-source and closed-source LLMs of different sizes and architectures, achieving an average 99% defense success rate against numerous... | Peng Ding, Jun Kuang, ZongYu Wang, Xuezhi Cao, Xunliang Cai, Jiajun Chen, Shujian Huang |  |

While open-source LMM agents have made significant advances in offline evaluation benchmarks, their performance still falls substantially short of human-level capabilities in more realistic online settings. A key bottleneck is the lack of diverse and large-scale trajectory-level datasets across various domains, which are expensive to collect. In this paper, we address this challenge by developing a scalable recipe to synthesize the largest and most diverse trajectory-level dataset to date, containing over 94K successful multimodal web trajectories, spanning 49K unique URLs, 720K screenshots, and 33M web elements. In particular, we leverage extensive web exploration and refinement to obtain diverse task intents. The average cost is 28 cents per successful trajectory, making it affordable to a wide range of users in the community.

In this work, we propose Pyramid-descent Visual Position Encoding (PyPE), a novel approach designed to enhance the perception of visual tokens within VLMs. By assigning visual position indexes from the periphery to the center and expanding the central receptive field incrementally, PyPE addresses the limitations of traditional raster-scan methods and mitigates the long-term decay effects induced by Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). Our method reduces the relative distance between interrelated visual elements and instruction tokens, promoting a more rational allocation of attention weights and allowing for a multi-granularity perception of visual elements and countering the over-reliance on anchor tokens.

However, existing works primarily focus on modeling explicit character profiles, while ignoring the underlying personality traits that truly shape behaviors and decision-making, hampering the development of more anthropomorphic and psychologically-grounded AI systems. In this paper, we explore the modeling of Big Five personality traits, which is the most widely used trait theory in psychology, and propose P-React, a mixture of experts (MoE)-based personalized LLM. Particularly, we integrate a Personality Specialization Loss (PSL) to better capture individual trait expressions, providing a more nuanced and psychologically grounded personality simulacrum. To facilitate research in this field, we curate OCEAN-Chat, a high-quality, human-verified dataset designed to train LLMs in expressing personality traits across diverse topics.

However, traditional AES systems face three major challenges: (i) reliance on handcrafted features that limit generalizability, (ii) difficulty in capturing fine-grained traits like coherence and argumentation, and (iii) inability to handle multimodal contexts. In the era of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), we propose \*\*EssayJudge\*\*, the \*\*first multimodal benchmark to evaluate AES capabilities across lexical-, sentence-, and discourse-level traits\*\*. By leveraging MLLMs’ strengths in trait-specific scoring and multimodal context understanding, EssayJudge aims to offer precise, context-rich evaluations without manual feature engineering, addressing longstanding AES limitations.

This approach is effective but increases resource demands as each model must be deployed separately. Recent advancements attempt to address this by applying prompt tuning, which allows a shared base model to adapt to multiple tasks with minimal parameter changes. However, a key challenge remains: intermediate outputs, passed between models as plain text, require recomputation of hidden states (i.e., Key and Value (KV) states in Transformers) during inference. In this paper, we introduce FTHSS, a novel prompt-tuning method that enables models to share KV hidden states, eliminating redundant forward passes and reducing KV cache storage. By modifying input and attention masks during training, FTHSS allows models to effectively utilize KV hidden states from prior models in both single- and multi-round... | Yuanjie Lyu, Chao Zhang, Yuhao Chen, Yong Chen, Tong Xu |  |

Self-correction that instructs models to refine their outputs presents a promising solution to this issue. Previous studies have mainly concentrated on Large Language Models (LLMs), while the self-correction abilities of VLMs, particularly concerning both visual and linguistic information, remain largely unexamined. This study investigates the self-correction capabilities of VLMs during both inference and fine-tuning stages. We introduce a Self-Correction Learning (SCL) approach that enables VLMs to learn from their self-generated self-correction data through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) without relying on external feedback, facilitating self-improvement. Experimental results demonstrate that although VLMs struggle to self-correct effectively during iterative inference without additional fine-tuning and external feedback, they can enhance their performance and avoid... | Jiayi He, Hehai Lin, Qingyun Wang, Yi R.

We propose a proof-of-concept framework that projects how model-generated advice could propagate through societal systems on a macroscopic scale over time, enabling more robust alignment. To assess the long-term safety awareness of language models, we also introduce a dataset of 100 indirect harm scenarios, testing models’ ability to foresee adverse, non-obvious outcomes from seemingly harmless user prompts. Our approach achieves not only over 20% improvement on the new dataset but also an average win rate exceeding 70% against strong baselines on existing safety benchmarks (AdvBench, SafeRLHF, WildGuardMix), suggesting a promising direction for safer agents. | Chenkai Sun, Denghui Zhang, ChengXiang Zhai, Heng Ji |  |

While current approaches leverage high-quality pairwise preference data through outcome-based criteria like answer correctness or consistency, they fundamentally neglect the internal logical coherence of responses. To overcome this, we propose Probability-Consistent Preference Optimization (PCPO), a novel framework that establishes dual quantitative metrics for preference selection: (1) surface-level answer correctness and (2) intrinsic token-level probability consistency across responses. Extensive experiments show that our PCPO consistently outperforms existing outcome-only criterion approaches across a diverse range of LLMs and benchmarks.

Despite these advancements, there is a lack of a robust benchmark specifically for assessing the image‐to‐web conversion proficiency of these large models. It is essential to ensure the integrity of the web elements generated, which comprise both visible and invisible categories. Previous evaluation methods (e.g., BLEU) are notably susceptible to significant alterations due to the presence of invisible elements. Furthermore, it is crucial to measure the layout information of web pages—i.e., the positional relationships between elements—which has been overlooked by prior work. To address these challenges, we have curated and aligned a benchmark of images and corresponding web codes (IW-bench). Specifically, we propose Element Accuracy, which tests the completeness of elements by parsing the Document Object Model (DOM) tree. We also introduce Layout Accuracy to analyze... | Hongcheng Guo, Wei Zhang, Junhao Chen, Yaonan Gu, Jian Yang, Junjia Du, Shaosheng Cao, Binyuan Hui, Tianyu Liu, Jianxin Ma, Chang Zhou, Zhoujun Li |  |

While previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of fine-tuning LLMs for these generation-based tasks, embedding-based tasks, which are equally critical to EDA workflows, have been largely overlooked. These tasks, including natural language code search, RTL code functionality equivalence checking, and performance prediction, are essential for accelerating and optimizing the hardware design process. To address this gap, we present DeepRTL2, a family of versatile LLMs that unifies both generation- and embedding-based tasks related to RTL. By simultaneously tackling a broad range of tasks, DeepRTL2 represents the first model to provide a comprehensive solution to the diverse challenges in EDA. Through extensive experiments, we show that DeepRTL2... | Yi Liu, Hongji Zhang, Yunhao Zhou, Zhengyuan Shi, Changran Xu, Qiang Xu |  |

Existing approaches to self-improvement often rely on external supervision signals in the form of seed data and/or assistance from third-party models. This paper presents Crescent – a simple yet effective framework for generating high-quality synthetic question-answer data in a fully autonomous manner. Crescent first elicits the LLM to generate raw questions via a bait prompt, then diversifies these questions leveraging a rejection sampling-based self-deduplication, and finally feeds the questions to the LLM and collects the corresponding answers by means of majority voting. We show that Crescent sheds light on the potential of true self-improvement with zero external supervision signals for math reasoning; in particular, Crescent-generated... | Yutao Sun, Mingshuai Chen, Tiancheng Zhao, Ruochen Xu, Zilun Zhang, Jianwei Yin |  |

However, these methods struggle to handle MSA tasks in low-resource languages. While multilingual LLMs enable cross-lingual transfer, they are limited to textual data and cannot address multimodal scenarios. To achieve MSA in low-resource languages, we propose a novel transfer learning framework named Language Family Disentanglement and Rethinking Transfer (LFD-RT). During pre-training, we establish cross-lingual and cross-modal alignments, followed by a language family disentanglement module that enhances the sharing of language universals within families while reducing noise from cross-family alignments. We propose a rethinking strategy for unsupervised fine-tuning that adapts the pre-trained model to MSA tasks in low-resource languages.

However, the underlying mechanism remains underexplored, and relying solely on reasoning capacity may raise security concerns. In this paper, we try to answer the question: Does CoT reasoning really reduce harmfulness from jailbreaking? Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that CoT reasoning has dual effects on jailbreaking harmfulness. Based on the theoretical insights, we propose a novel jailbreak method, FicDetail, whose practical performance validates our theoretical findings. | Chengda Lu, Xiaoyu Fan, Yu Huang, Rongwu Xu, Jijie Li, Wei Xu |  |

While reward models (RMs) with reinforcement learning or test-time scaling offer the potential for improving generation quality, a critical gap remains: publicly available multi-modal RMs for LVLMs are scarce, and the implementation details of proprietary models are often unclear. We bridge this gap with InternLM-XComposer2.5-Reward (IXC-2.5-Reward), a simple yet effective multi-modal reward model that aligns LVLMs with human preferences. To ensure the robustness and versatility of IXC-2.5-Reward, we set up a high-quality multi-modal preference corpus spanning text, image, and video inputs across diverse domains, such as instruction following, general understanding, text-rich documents, mathematical reasoning, and video understanding. IXC-2.5-Reward achieves excellent results on the latest multi-modal reward model benchmark and shows... | Yuhang Zang, Xiaoyi Dong, Pan Zhang, Yuhang Cao, Ziyu Liu, Shengyuan Ding, Shenxi Wu, Yubo Ma, Haodong Duan, Wenwei Zhang, Kai Chen, Dahua Lin, Jiaqi Wang |  |

Although significant progress has been made in semantic map construction and target direction prediction in current research, redundant exploration and exploration failures remain inevitable. A critical but underexplored direction is the timely termination of exploration to overcome these challenges. We observe a diminishing marginal effect between exploration steps and exploration rates and analyze the cost-benefit relationship of exploration. Inspired by this, we propose RATE-Nav, a Region-Aware Termination-Enhanced method. It includes a geometric predictive region segmentation algorithm and region-Based exploration estimation algorithm for exploration rate calculation. By leveraging the visual question answering capabilities of visual language models (VLMs) and exploration rates enables efficient termination.RATE-Nav achieves a success rate of 67.8% and an SPL of 31.3% on the HM3D dataset.

Inspired by ResNet’s residual learning, we propose Residual Mixture-of-Agents (RMoA), integrating residual connections to optimize efficiency and reliability. To maximize information utilization from model responses while minimizing computational costs, we innovatively design an embedding-based diversity selection mechanism that greedily selects responses via vector similarity. Furthermore, to mitigate iterative information degradation, we introduce a Residual Extraction Agent to preserve cross-layer incremental information by capturing inter-layer response differences, coupled with a Residual Aggregation Agent for hierarchical information integration.

While existing automatic data synthetic methods alleviate the burden of manual curation, they often rely heavily on either the quality of seed data or strong assumptions about the structure and content of web documents. To tackle these challenges, we propose Web Reconstruction (WebR), a fully automated framework for synthesizing high-quality instruction-tuning (IT) data directly from raw web documents with minimal assumptions. Leveraging the inherent diversity of raw web content, we conceptualize web reconstruction as an instruction-tuning data synthesis task via a novel dual-perspective paradigm—Web as Instruction and Web as Response—where each web document is designated as either the input or output role to trigger the reconstruction process. Comprehensive experiments show that datasets generated by WebR outperform state-of-the-art baselines... | Yuxin Jiang, Yufei Wang, Chuhan Wu, Xinyi Dai, Yan Xu, Weinan Gan, Yasheng Wang, Xin Jiang, Lifeng Shang, Ruiming Tang, Wei Wang |  |

However, the lack of human preference labels remains a significant bottleneck when applying RLHF to a downstream domain. Humans in RLHF play a critical role in injecting reasoning preferences into LLM, and we assume the reasoning process underlying human assessments may potentially be replaced by reasoning pathways derived from Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Inspired by this assumption, we propose Reinforcement Learning from Knowledge Graph Feedback (RLKGF), a novel method that leverages KG semantics and structure to derive RL rewards in the absence of manual annotations. Unlike Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF), RLKGF directly integrates human priors encoded in KGs as the reward model, aligning LLM responses with expert knowledge without additional preference labeling or reward model training.

However, understanding how tasks are internally encoded and generalized remains a challenge. To address some of the empirical and technical gaps in the literature, we introduce an automated formulation for encoding task information in ICL prompts as a function of attention heads within the transformer architecture. This approach computes a single task vector as a weighted sum of attention heads, with the weights optimized causally via gradient descent. Our findings show that existing methods fail to generalize effectively to modalities beyond text. In response, we also design a benchmark to evaluate whether a task vector can preserve task fidelity in functional regression tasks.

Previous studies have isolated LLM jailbreak attacks and defenses. We analyze the security protection mechanism of the LLM, and propose a framework that combines attack and defense. Our method is based on the linearly separable property of LLM intermediate layer embedding, as well as the essence of jailbreak attack, which aims to embed harmful problems and transfer them to the safe area. We utilize generative adversarial network (GAN) to learn the security judgment boundary inside the LLM to achieve efficient jailbreak attack and defense. The experimental results indicate that our method achieves an average jailbreak success rate of 88.85% across three popular LLMs, while the defense success rate on the state-of-the-art jailbreak dataset reaches an average of 84.17%.

However, a critical yet underexplored issue persists: over-execution, where the agent executes tasks in a fully autonomous way, without adequate assessment of its action confidence to compromise an adaptive human-agent collaboration. This poses substantial risks in complex scenarios, such as those involving ambiguous user instructions, unexpected interruptions, and environmental hijacks. To address the issue, we introduce OS-Kairos, an adaptive GUI agent capable of predicting confidence levels at each interaction step and efficiently deciding whether to act autonomously or seek human intervention. OS-Kairos is developed through two key mechanisms: (i) collaborative probing that annotates confidence scores at each interaction step; (ii) confidence-driven interaction that leverages these confidence scores to elicit the ability of adaptive interaction.

While the communication framework is crucial for agent coordination, it also introduces a critical yet unexplored security vulnerability. In this work, we introduce Agent-in-the-Middle (AiTM), a novel attack that exploits the fundamental communication mechanisms in LLM-MAS by intercepting and manipulating inter-agent messages. Unlike existing attacks that compromise individual agents, AiTM demonstrates how an adversary can compromise entire multi-agent systems by only manipulating the messages passing between agents. To enable the attack under the challenges of limited control and role-restricted communication format, we develop an LLM-powered adversarial agent with a reflection mechanism that generates contextually-aware malicious instructions.

In this paper, we introduce DRT, an attempt to bring the success of long CoT to neural machine translation (MT). Specifically, in view of the literature books that might involve similes and metaphors, translating these texts to a target language is very difficult in practice due to cultural differences. In such cases, literal translation often fails to convey the intended meaning effectively. Even for professional human translators, considerable thought must be given to preserving semantics throughout the translation process. To simulate LLMs’ long thought ability in MT, we first mine sentences containing similes or metaphors from existing literature books, and then develop a multi-agent framework to translate these sentences via long thought. In the multi-agent framework, a translator is used to iteratively... | Jiaan Wang, Fandong Meng, Yunlong Liang, Jie Zhou |  |

These patterns, such as trends in vital signs like abnormal heart rate or blood pressure, can indicate deteriorating health or an impending critical event of any individual in a given population. Similarly, clinical notes often contain textual descriptions that reflect these changes. Identifying corresponding temporal patterns across different modalities is crucial for improving the accuracy of clinical outcome predictions, yet it remains a challenging task. To address this gap, we introduce a Cross-modal Temporal Pattern Discovery (CTPD) framework, designed to efficiently extract meaningful cross-modal temporal... | Fuying Wang, Feng Wu, Yihan Tang, Lequan Yu |  |

Unlike previous methods requiring explicit cross-modal alignment, our approach eliminates this need by using pre-trained models like Qwen-VL and VideoLLaVA, which seamlessly handle multimodal inputs. We introduce two multi-agent debating mechanisms—consensus-driven (CD) and round-driven (RD)—to enable cooperation between models with complementary strengths. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both image-text and video-text datasets for VUCP, improving robustness and accuracy. | Dong Zhang, Haiyan Tian, Qingying Sun, Shoushan Li |  |

To tackle these challenges, we propose a new multi-answer QA framework – Retrieval-augmented Independent Reading with Inter-passage Verification (RI²VER). Our framework retrieves a large set of passages and processes each passage individually to generate an initial high-recall but noisy answer set. Then we propose a new inter-passage verification pipeline that validates every candidate answer through (1) Verification Question Generation, (2) Gathering Additional Evidence, and (3) Verification with inter-passage synthesis. Evaluations on the QAMPARI and RoMQA datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing baselines across various model sizes, achieving an average F1 score improvement of... | Bingsen Chen, Shenji Wan, Xi Ye, Chen Zhao |  |

Prompt Multi-Lookup enhances the autoregressive decoding efficiency by generating multiple candidate sequences from context. Template Datastore exploits structured patterns, particularly in mathematical and code generation tasks, to enable fast and accurate candidate generation. Common Sequences optimize inference by precomputing frequent short sequences in specialized domains. For mathematical generation, PROMTEC achieves a 3.91 × speedup on the miniF2F benchmark. For code generation, it achieves up to a 4.23 × speedup on the HumanEval benchmark. This work highlights the potential of integrated candidate generation to accelerate LLM inference while maintaining high-quality outputs. | Alan ChiMan Lee, WingSun Cheng, Calvin ChunKit Chan |  |

A critical challenge lies in the scarcity of high-quality reasoning data—characterized by diversity and rich supervisory signals—necessary for robust model training. While data augmentation (DA) methods have been leveraged to mitigate this scarcity, prevailing approaches often introduce noise and exhibit logical inconsistencies, thereby diminishing their utility for complex reasoning tasks. Moreover, existing DA paradigms predominantly isolate data synthesis from label validation, failing to unify these complementary processes within a cohesive architecture.To address these limitations, we introduce Logical DA, a multi-agent framework for enhancing reasoning-focused data augmentation in few-shot learning scenarios. Our system includes four agents operating through two synergistic phases: (1) diverse data generation, and (2) label verification.The system... | Haoqi Zheng, DongWang DongWang, Silin Yang, Yunpeng Qi, Ruochun Jin, Liyang Xu |  |

While general-purpose text embedding models demonstrate strong performance on generic retrieval benchmarks, their effectiveness diminishes when applied to private datasets (e.g., company-specific proprietary data), which often contain specialized terminology and lingo. In this work, we introduce BMEmbed, a novel method for adapting general-purpose text embedding models to private datasets. By leveraging the well-established keyword-based retrieval technique (BM25), we construct supervisory signals from the ranking of keyword-based retrieval results to facilitate model adaptation. We evaluate BMEmbed across a range of domains, datasets, and models, showing consistent improvements in retrieval performance. Moreover, we provide empirical insights into how BM25-based signals contribute to improving embeddings by fostering alignment and uniformity, highlighting the value of this... | Yubai Wei, Jiale Han, Yi Yang |  |

In this paper, we introduce a novel jailbreak method, SQL Injection Jailbreak (SIJ), which targets the external properties of LLMs, specifically, the way LLMs construct input prompts. By injecting jailbreak information into user prompts, SIJ successfully induces the model to output harmful content. For open-source models, SIJ achieves near 100% attack success rates on five well-known LLMs on the AdvBench and HEx-PHI, while incurring lower time costs compared to previous methods. For closed-source models, SIJ achieves an average attack success rate over 85% across five models in the GPT and Doubao series. Additionally, SIJ exposes a new vulnerability in LLMs that... | Jiawei Zhao, Kejiang Chen, Weiming Zhang, Nenghai Yu |  |

However, these capabilities come with an increased model scale. While post-training pruning reduces model size in unimodal models, its application to MLLMs often yields limited success. Our analysis discovers that conventional methods fail to account for the unique token attributes across layers and modalities inherent to MLLMs. Inspired by this observation, we propose TAMP, a simple yet effective pruning framework tailored for MLLMs, featuring two key components: (1) Diversity-Aware Sparsity, which adjusts sparsity ratio per layer based on diversities among multimodal output tokens, preserving more parameters in high-diversity layers; and (2) Adaptive Multimodal Input Activation, which identifies representative multimodal input tokens using attention scores to guide unstructured weight pruning. We validate our method on two state-of-the-art MLLMs: LLaVA-NeXT,... | Jaewoo Lee, Keyang Xuan, Chanakya Ekbote, Sandeep Polisetty, Yi R. Fung, Paul Pu Liang |  |

A critical challenge is understanding users with diverse musical expertise and generating music that meets their expectations, an area that remains underexplored.To address this gap, we introduce the novel task of Professional and Amateur Description-to-Song Generation. This task focuses on aligning generated content with human expressions from varying musical proficiency levels, aiming to produce songs that accurately meet auditory expectations and adhere to musical structural conventions. We utilized the MuChin dataset, which contains annotations from both professionals and amateurs for identical songs, as the source for these distinct description types. We also collected a pre-train dataset of over 1.5 million songs; lyrics were included for some, while for others, lyrics were generated using Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models.Furthermore, we... | Zihao Wang, Jiaxing Yu, Haoxuan Liu, Zehui Zheng, Yuhang Jin, Shuyu Li, Shulei Ji, Kejun Zhang |  |

Large language models (LLMs), trained on vast corpora, have shown strong potential in data generation, making them a promising tool for data imputation. However, challenges persist in designing effective prompts for a finetuning-free process and in mitigating biases and uncertainty in LLM outputs. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, LLM-Forest, which introduces a “forest” of few-shot learning LLM “trees” with their outputs aggregated via confidence-based weighted voting based on LLM self-assessment, inspired by the ensemble learning (Random Forest). This framework is established on a new concept of bipartite information graphs to identify high-quality relevant neighboring entries with both feature and value granularity.

However, LLMs may suffer from spurious correlations between input texts and output labels, which limits LLMs’ ability to reason based purely on general language understanding. For example, in the natural language inference (NLI) task, LLMs may make predictions primarily based on premise or hypothesis, rather than both components. To address this problem that may lead to unexpected performance degradation, we propose task calibration (TC), a zero-shot and inference-only calibration method inspired by mutual information which recovers LLM performance through task reformulation. In NLI, TC encourages LLMs to reason based on both premise and hypothesis, while mitigating the models’ over-reliance on individual premise or hypothesis for inference. Experimental results show that TC achieves a substantial improvement on 13 different benchmarks in the zero-shot setup. We further validate the... | Yingjie Li, Yun Luo, Xiaotian Xie, Yue Zhang |  |

Existing QR approaches typically fall into two categories: discriminative models and generative methods leveraging large language models (LLMs). Discriminative models often struggle with natural language understanding and offer limited flexibility in rewriting, while generative LLMs, despite producing high-quality rewrites, face high inference latency and cost in online settings. These limitations force offline deployment, making them vulnerable to issues like information staleness and semantic drift. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel hybrid pipeline for QR that balances efficiency and effectiveness. Our approach combines \*\*offline knowledge distillation\*\* to create a lightweight but efficient student model with \*\*online reinforcement learning (RL)\*\* to refine query rewriting dynamically using... | Duy A.

This technological marginalization is particularly acute for Alaska’s 20 Native languages, all of which face endangerment despite their rich linguistic heritage. We present GenAlaskan, a framework demonstrating how both large language models and specialized classifiers can effectively identify these languages with minimal data. Working closely with Native Alaskan community members, we create Akutaq-2k, a carefully curated dataset of 2000 sentences spanning all 20 languages, named after the traditional Yup’ik dessert, symbolizing the blending of diverse elements. We design few-shot prompting on proprietary and open-source LLMs, achieving nearly perfect accuracy with just 40 examples per language.

Existing code-focused resources typically fail to ensure either the breadth of coverage (e.g., spanning simple coding tasks to advanced algorithmic problems) or verifiable correctness (e.g., unit tests). In contrast, KodCode comprises question–solution–test triplets that are systematically validated via a self-verification procedure. Our pipeline begins by synthesizing a broad range of coding questions, then generates solutions and test cases with additional attempts allocated to challenging problems. Finally, post-training data synthesis is done by rewriting questions into diverse formats and generating responses under a test-based reject sampling procedure from a reasoning model (DeepSeek R1). This pipeline yields a large-scale, robust and diverse coding dataset. It... | Zhangchen Xu, Yang Liu, Yueqin Yin, Mingyuan Zhou, Radha Poovendran |  |

However, existing methods for RWG always suffer from shallow comprehension due to taking the limited portions of references papers as input and isolated explanation for each reference due to ineffective capturing the relationships among them. To address these issues, we focus on full-text-based RWG task and propose a novel multi-agent framework. Our framework consists of three agents: a selector that decides which section of the papers is going to read next, a reader that digests the selected section and updates a shared working memory, and a writer that generates RWS based on the final curated memory. To better capture the relationships among references, we also propose two graph-aware strategies for selector, enabling to optimize the reading order with constrains of the graph structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework... | Xiaochuan Liu, Ruihua Song, Xiting Wang, Xu Chen |  |

This challenge is further amplified by the one-to-many nature of idiomatic translations, where a single source idiom can have multiple target-language equivalents depending on cultural references and contextual variations. Traditional static knowledge graphs (KGs) and prompt-based approaches struggle to capture these complex relationships, often leading to suboptimal translations. To address this, we propose an IdiomCE, an adaptive graph neural network (GNN) based methodology that learns intricate mappings between idiomatic expressions, effectively generalizing to both seen and unseen nodes during training. Our proposed method enhances translation quality even in resource-constrained settings, facilitating improved idiomatic translation in smaller models. We evaluate our approach on multiple idiomatic translation datasets using... | Pratik Rakesh Singh, Kritarth Prasad, Mohammadi Zaki, Pankaj Wasnik |  |

However, their ability to answer climate adaptation questions remains unclear. In particular, can they be used by agronomists and climate scientists to answer questions on the best climate adaptation strategies? Answering questions in this domain requires knowledge of climate data and its uncertainties, and the ability to link them to the broader climate literature while accommodating the unique constraints of users and experts. We investigate the generative and evaluative capabilities of several state-of-the-art LLMs, open-source and proprietary, on climate adaptation for agriculture questions posed by domain experts using evaluation criteria designed by the experts.We propose an iterative exploration framework that enables LLMs to dynamically aggregate information from heterogeneous sources, such as text from climate literature and structured tabular climate... | Vincent Nguyen, Sarvnaz Karimi, Willow Hallgren, Mahesh Prakash |  |

However, they inherently struggle to leverage graph-structured user-item interactions, which are widely recognized as beneficial. This paper presents AGRec, adapting LLMs’ decoders with graph reasoning for recommendation. We reveal that LLMs and graph neural networks (GNNs) manifest complementary strengths in distinct user domains. Building on this, we augment the decoding logits of LLMs with an auxiliary GNN model to optimize token generation. Moreover, we introduce a rankable finite state machine to tackle two challenges: (1) adjusting autoregressive generation with discriminative decoders that directly predict user-item similarity, and (2) token homogeneity, where LLMs often generate items with similar prefix tokens, narrowing the scope of beam search. This approach offers a novel perspective to enhance LLMs with graph knowledge. Our AGRec... | Xinfeng Wang, Jin Cui, Fumiyo Fukumoto, Yoshimi Suzuki |  |

Many recent methods have formulated the MACD task by learning robust prototypes to represent categories with limited support samples. However, few of them address the noise categories in the support set that hinder their models from effective prototype generations. To this end, we propose a causal denoising prototypical network (CDPN) for few-shot MACD. We reveal the underlying relation between causal inference and contrastive learning, and present causal contrastive learning (CCL) using discrete and continuous noise as negative samples. We empirically found that CCL can (1) prevent models from overly predicting more categories and (2) mitigate semantic ambiguity issues among categories. Experimental results show that CDPN outperforms competitive baselines. Our code is available online. | Jin Cui, Xinfeng Wang, Yoshimi Suzuki, Fumiyo Fukumoto |  |

However, existing benchmarks are either based on outdated data setups or focus solely on simple, flat table structures. In this paper, we introduce \*\*RealHiTBench\*\*, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of both LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) across a variety of input formats for complex tabular data, including LaTeX, HTML, and PNG. RealHiTBench also includes a diverse collection of tables with intricate structures, spanning a wide range of task types. Our experimental results, using \*\*25\*\* state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrate that RealHiTBench is indeed a challenging benchmark. Moreover, we also develop TreeThinker, a tree-based agent that organizes hierarchical headers into a tree structure for enhanced tabular reasoning, validating the importance of improving LLMs’... | Pengzuo Wu, Yuhang Yang, Guangcheng Zhu, Chao Ye, Hong Gu, Xu Lu, Ruixuan Xiao, Bowen Bao, Yijing He, Liangyu Zha, Wentao Ye, Junbo Zhao, Haobo Wang |  |

It requires a comprehensive understanding of document multi-modalities and a focused concentration on relevant textual regions during translation. However, most existing methods usually rely on the vanilla encoder-decoder paradigm, severely losing concentration on key regions that are especially crucial for complex-layout document translation. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we propose a new Query-Response DIT framework (QRDIT). QRDIT reformulates the DIT task into a parallel response/translation process of the multiple queries (i.e., relevant source texts), explicitly centralizing its focus toward the most relevant textual regions to ensure translation accuracy. A novel dynamic aggregation mechanism is also designed to enhance the text semantics in query features toward translation.

This includes understanding dependencies, project structures, and managing multi-file changes. However, the ability of LLMs to effectively comprehend and handle complex code repositories has yet to be fully explored. To address these challenges, we introduce a hierarchical benchmark designed to evaluate repository dependency understanding(DependEval) for LLMs. The benchmark is based on 2683 repositories collected from real-world websites. It evaluates models on three core tasks: Dependency Recognition, Repository Construction, and Multi-file Editing, across 8 programming languages from actual code repositories. Our evaluation of over 25 LLMs reveals substantial performance gaps and provides valuable insights into repository-level code understanding. | Junjia Du, Yadi Liu, Hongcheng Guo, Jiawei Wang, Haojian Huang, Yunyi Ni, Zhoujun Li |  |

To alleviate the problems of long-tail distribution and the lack of annotations of code-specific evidence, many previous works have proposed incorporating code knowledge to improve coding performance. However, existing methods often focus on a single type of knowledge and design specialized modules that are complex and incompatible with each other, thereby limiting their scalability and effectiveness. To address this issue, we propose GKI-ICD, a novel, general knowledge injection framework that integrates three key types of knowledge, namely ICD Description, ICD Synonym, and ICD Hierarchy, without specialized design of additional modules. The comprehensive utilization of the above knowledge, which exhibits both differences and complementarity, can effectively enhance the ICD coding performance.

Nonetheless, MU for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains in its nascent phase. Therefore, we propose to \*\*reformulate the task of multimodal MU in the era of MLLMs\*\*, which aims to erase only the visual patterns associated with a given entity while preserving the corresponding textual knowledge encoded within the original parameters of the language model backbone. Furthermore, we \*\*develop a novel geometry-constrained gradient ascent method MMUnlearner\*\*. It updates the weights of MLLMs with a weight saliency map jointly restricted by the remaining concepts and textual knowledge during unlearning, thereby preserving parameters essential for non-target knowledge.

Given the significant cost and labor demands of manual annotation, existing large-scale Video QADs benchmarks are typically generated automatically using video captions. Since video captions are incomplete representations of visual content and susceptible to error propagation, direct generation of QADs from video is crucial. This work first leverages a large vision-language model for video QADs generation. To enhance the consistency and diversity of the generated QADs, we propose utilizing temporal motion to describe the video objects. In addition, We design a selection mechanism that chooses diverse temporal object motions to generate diverse QADs focusing on different objects and interactions, maximizing overall semantic uncertainty for a given video.

We analyze the correlation between the input-output difference of self-attention block and Feed-Forward Network (FFN) within the same transformer layer, and find that these two differential vectors are highly correlated. Thus, we propose to dynamically skip the FFN blocks based on the self-attention difference and introduce Diffential Layer Skipping (DiffSkip) to show that LLMs are inherently dynamic-depth models, capable of adjusting computational depth when generating different tokens. DiffSkip employs a lightweight router module to dynamically skip a set of FFN blocks in LLMs and only requires efficient fine-tuning while keeping the whole LLM frozen. Experimental results demonstrate that DiffSkip effectively enables dynamic FFN skipping in decoder-only language models, even in continuous token generation tasks where many layer-skipping methods struggle. | Xuan Luo, Weizhi Wang, Xifeng Yan |  |

To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark covering a wide range of temporal granularities, designed to systematically evaluate LLMs’ capabilities in explainable temporal reasoning. Furthermore, our findings reveal that LLMs struggle to deliver convincing explanations when relying solely on textual information. To address challenge, we propose GETER, a novel structure-aware generative framework that integrates Graph structures with text for Explainable TEmporal Reasoning. Specifically, we first leverage temporal knowledge graphs to develop a temporal encoder that captures structural information for the query. Subsequently, we introduce a structure-text prefix adapter to map graph structure features into the text embedding space.

However, existing methods that integrate spatial layouts with text have limitations, such as producing overly long text sequences or failing to fully leverage the autoregressive traits of LLMs. In this work, we introduce Interleaving Layout andText in a Large Language Model (LayTextLLM) for document understanding. LayTextLLM projects each bounding box to a single embedding and interleaves it with text, efficiently avoiding long sequence issues while leveraging autoregressive traits of LLMs. LayTextLLM not only streamlines the interaction of layout and textual data but also shows enhanced performance in KIE and VQA. Comprehensive benchmark evaluations reveal significant improvements of LayTextLLM, with a 15.2% increase on KIE tasks and 10.7% on VQA tasks compared to previous SOTA... | Jinghui Lu, Haiyang Yu, Yanjie Wang, Yongjie Ye, Jingqun Tang, Ziwei Yang, Binghong Wu, Qi Liu, Hao Feng, Han Wang, Hao Liu, Can Huang |  |

While synthesizing instructional data from unsupervised text has become a common approach for training such models, conventional methods rely heavily on human effort for data annotation. Although existing automated synthesis paradigms have alleviated this constraint, they still exhibit significant limitations in ensuring adequate diversity and difficulty of synthesized instructions. To address these challenges, we propose Self-Foveate, an innovative LLM-driven method for instruction synthesis. This approach introduces a “Micro-Scatter-Macro” multi-level foveation methodology that effectively guides the LLM to deeply excavate fine-grained information embedded in unsupervised text, thereby enhancing both the diversity and difficulty of synthesized instructions. Comprehensive experiments across multiple unsupervised corpora and diverse model architectures validate... | Mingzhe Li, Xin Lu, Yanyan Zhao |  |

First, they can not thoroughly explore the vast input space of table understanding tasks, leading to limited data diversity. Second, they ignore the weaknesses in table understanding ability of the target LLM and blindly pursue the increase of data quantity, resulting in suboptimal data efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a progressive and weakness-guided data synthesis framework tailored for table instruction tuning, named TableDreamer, to mitigate the above issues. Specifically, we first synthesize diverse tables and related instructions as seed data, and then perform an iterative exploration of the input space under the guidance of the newly identified weakness data, which eventually serve as the final training data for fine-tuning the target LLM.

The corpus comprises about 777k tokens, carefully collected and manually annotated with 21 entity types using both nested and flat annotation schemes - using the Wojood guidelines. While is useful for various NLP tasks like domain adaptation and transfer learning, this paper primarily focuses on benchmarking existing Arabic Named Entity Recognition (NER) models, especially cross-domain and cross-dialect model performance. Our benchmarking of four Arabic NER models using reveals a significant drop in performance of up to 38% when compared to the in-distribution data. Furthermore, we present an in-depth analysis of domain and dialect divergence and the impact of resource scarcity. We also measured the overlap between domains and dialects using the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) metric, and illustrated why certain NER models perform better on specific dialects... | Nagham Hamad, Mohammed Khalilia, Mustafa Jarrar |  |

To address this, existing methods train rewriting models with supervision from large amounts of manually annotated data and trained aesthetic assessment models. To alleviate the dependence on data scale for model training and the biases introduced by trained models, we propose a novel prompt optimization framework, designed to rephrase a simple user prompt into a sophisticated prompt to a text-to-image model. Specifically, we employ the large vision language models (LVLMs) as the solver to rewrite the user prompt, and concurrently, employ LVLMs as a reward model to score the aesthetics and alignment of the images generated by the optimized prompt. Instead of laborious human feedback, we exploit the prior knowledge of the LVLM to provide rewards, i.e., AI feedback. Simultaneously, the solver and the reward model are unified... | Hongji Yang, Yucheng Zhou, Wencheng Han, Jianbing Shen |  |

GitHub issue resolving is a key challenge among these tasks. While recent approaches have made progress on this task, they focus on textual data within issues, neglecting visual data. However, this visual data is crucial for resolving issues as it conveys additional knowledge that text alone cannot. We propose CodeV, the first approach to leveraging visual data to enhance the issue-resolving capabilities of LLMs. CodeV resolves each issue by following a two-phase process: data processing and patch generation. To evaluate CodeV, we construct a benchmark for visual issue resolving, namely Visual SWE-bench. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of CodeV, as well as provide valuable insights into leveraging visual data to resolve GitHub issues. | Linhao Zhang, Daoguang Zan, Quanshun Yang, Zhirong Huang, Dong Chen, Bo Shen, Tianyu Liu, Yongshun Gong, Pengjie Huang, Xudong Lu, Guangtai Liang, Lizhen Cui, Qianxiang Wang |  |

Large Language Models (LLMs) offer significant potential for addressing this gap due to their ability to handle extensive context and multi-turn reasoning. This review introduces a conceptual taxonomy dividing psychotherapy into interconnected stages–assessment, diagnosis, and treatment–to systematically examine LLM advancements and challenges. Our comprehensive analysis reveals imbalances in current research, such as a focus on common disorders, linguistic biases, fragmented methods, and limited theoretical integration. We identify critical challenges including capturing dynamic symptom fluctuations, overcoming linguistic and cultural biases, and ensuring diagnostic reliability. Highlighting future directions, we advocate for continuous multi-stage modeling, real-time adaptive systems grounded in... | Hongbin Na, Yining Hua, Zimu Wang, Tao Shen, Beibei Yu, Lilin Wang, Wei Wang, John B.

Data evolution explores methods to generate higher-quality reasoning training data. Model evolution focuses on training strategies to boost reasoning capabilities. Self-evolution research autonomous system evolution via iterating cycles of data and model evolution. We further discuss the scaling law of self-evolution and analyze representative O1-like works through this lens. By summarizing advanced methods and outlining future directions, this paper aims to drive advancements in LLMs’ reasoning abilities. | Tao He, Hao Li, Jingchang Chen, Runxuan Liu, Yixin Cao, Lizi Liao, Zihao Zheng, Zheng Chu, Jiafeng Liang, Ming Liu, Bing Qin |  |

Rehearsal-based methods mitigate this problem by retaining a small set of old data. Nevertheless, they still suffer inevitable performance loss. Although training separate experts for each task can help prevent forgetting, effectively assembling them remains a challenge. Some approaches use routers to assign tasks to experts, but in continual learning, they often require retraining for optimal performance. To address these challenges, we introduce the Sequential Ensemble of Experts (SEE) framework. SEE removes the need for an additional router, allowing each expert to independently decide whether a query should be handled. The framework employs distributed routing, and during continual fine-tuning, SEE only requires the training of new experts for incoming tasks, rather than retraining the entire system. Experiments reveal that the SEE outperforms prior approaches, including multi-task... | Zhilin Wang, Yafu Li, Xiaoye Qu, Yu Cheng |  |

By introducing more computational budget during test-time, LLMs have the potential to explore more accurate and higher-quality solutions. However, such paradigms are primarily verified in domains that have well-defined criteria for responses, such as coding and mathematics. Inspired by the success of this paradigm, we aim to bridge it to more subtle open-domain question answering. Specifically, we utilize search mechanisms such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for both policy model improvement and reward model improvement that achieve better performance in test-time scaling strategies. Our contributions are summarized in two folds: For the training phase, we demonstrate that our approach surpasses previous SOTA automatic data annotation methods and various public instruction-tuning datasets, with fewer data points.

This disparity is primarily due to insufficient alignment between vision and audio modalities during training, leading to inadequate attention to visual information when using audio queries. To mitigate this issue, we propose a Self-Knowledge Distillation (Self-KD) training method where the vision-text component of the OLLM serves as the teacher and the vision-audio component as the student. This enables the model to process audio in a manner analogous to its text processing. Our experimental results demonstrate that Self-KD is an effective method for enhancing the vision-audio capabilities of OLLMs by learning from the vision-text components, which subsequently improves the interaction between audio and images and results in improved... | Rui Hu, Delai Qiu, Shuyu Wei, Jiaming Zhang, Yining Wang, Shengping Liu, Jitao Sang |  |

OpenHuEval is constructed from a vast collection of Hungarian-specific materials sourced from multiple origins. In the construction, we incorporated the latest design principles for evaluating LLMs, such as using real user queries from the internet, emphasizing the assessment of LLMs’ generative capabilities, and employing LLM-as-judge to enhance the multidimensionality and accuracy of evaluations. Ultimately, OpenHuEval encompasses eight Hungarian-specific dimensions, featuring five tasks and 3953 questions. Consequently, OpenHuEval provides the comprehensive, in-depth, and scientifically accurate assessment of LLM performance in the context of the Hungarian language and its specifics. We evaluated current mainstream LLMs, including both traditional LLMs and recently developed Large Reasoning Models.

However, a significant amount of factual knowledge is stored in structured data, which has unique characteristics not typically encountered in the unstructured texts used for pretraining LLMs. To evaluate the capability of LLMs in handling facts structurally stored, we introduce a benchmark called StructFact, which includes meticulously annotated factual questions, spanning five tasks that reflect the intrinsic properties of structured data. This benchmark aims to delineate the strengths and limitations of LLMs in reasoning with structured data for knowledge-intensive tasks in practical applications. Extensive experiments conducted on 10 common LLMs have yielded several insights, one notable finding being that these models struggle significantly with the heterogeneity of structured data during reasoning. | Sirui Huang, Yanggan Gu, Zhonghao Li, Xuming Hu, Qing Li, Guandong Xu |  |

As language models advance at an unprecedented pace, a critical question arises: Are these models becoming self-conscious? Drawing upon insights from psychological and neural science, this work presents a practical definition of self-consciousness for language models and refines ten core concepts. Our work pioneers an investigation into self-consciousness in language models by, for the first time, leveraging structural causal games to establish the functional definitions of the ten core concepts. Based on our definitions, we conduct a comprehensive four-stage experiment: quantification (evaluation of ten leading models), representation (visualization of self-consciousness within the models), manipulation (modification of the models’ representation), and acquisition (fine-tuning the models on core concepts). Our findings indicate that although models are in the early stages... | Sirui Chen, Shu Yu, Shengjie Zhao, Chaochao Lu |  |

However, existing methods often employ multiple models for these tasks, leading to increased system complexity and maintenance overhead. While some models attempt to unify detection and recognition, they often fail to address the intrinsic differences in data representations, thereby limiting performance in document processing. Our research reveals that recognition relies on discrete tokens, whereas detection relies on continuous coordinates, leading to challenges in gradient updates and optimization. To bridge this gap, we propose the Gaussian-Kernel Cross-Entropy Loss (GK-CEL), enabling generative frameworks to handle both tasks simultaneously. Building upon GK-CEL, we propose DocFusion, a unified document parsing model with only 0.28B parameters. Additionally, we construct the DocLatex-1.6M dataset to provide high-quality training support.

However, we observe that pruning often leads to a degradation in safety performance. To address this issue, we present a novel and lightweight approach, termed Hierarchical Safety Realignment (HSR). HSR operates by first quantifying the contribution of each attention head to safety, identifying the most critical ones, and then selectively restoring neurons directly within these attention heads that play a pivotal role in maintaining safety. This process hierarchically realigns the safety of pruned LVLMs, progressing from the attention head level to the neuron level. We validate HSR across various models and pruning strategies, consistently achieving notable improvements in safety performance. To our knowledge, this is the first work explicitly focused on restoring safety in... | Yue Li, Xin Yi, Dongsheng Shi, Gerard de Melo, Xiaoling Wang, Linlin Wang |  |

Generating high-quality long-form content still remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present LongDPO, a novel approach designed to enhance long-form text generation through step-level supervision. By leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to collect stepwise preference pairs and employing a global memory pool to maintain factual accuracy, LongDPO effectively mitigates issues such as inconsistencies that are prevalent in long-context LLMs. Furthermore, we integrate critique-augmented generation to refine the selected preference pairs. Following the collection of stepwise preference pairs, we apply stepwise preference learning for fine-grained optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that our method enhances performance on long-form... | Bowen Ping, Jiali Zeng, Fandong Meng, Shuo Wang, Jie Zhou, Shanghang Zhang |  |

While retrieval-augmented frameworks traditionally focus on selecting top-ranked documents in a single pass, many real-world scenarios demand compositional retrieval, where multiple sources must be combined in a coordinated manner. In this work, we propose a tri-encoder sequential retriever that models this process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), decomposing the probability of retrieving a set of elements into a sequence of conditional probabilities and allowing each retrieval step to be conditioned on previously selected examples. We train the retriever in two stages: first, we efficiently construct supervised sequential data for initial policy training; we then refine the policy to align with the LLM’s preferences using a reward grounded in the structural correspondence of generated programs. Experimental results show that... | Quanyu Long, Jianda Chen, Zhengyuan Liu, Nancy F. Chen, Wenya Wang, Sinno Jialin Pan |  |

However, we observe that the initial policy model could significantly influence the final performance as well as the token efficiency. Additionally, there is a lack of systematic guidelines for obtaining a better initial policy model. To bridge this gap, we initiate a comprehensive investigation by activating the initial model using a variety of datasets with different data volumes and reasoning patterns. Then, we conduct a thorough analysis and comparison of the RL process for different initial models from the perspectives of upper bounds, diversity, and token efficiency, providing a deeper understanding and insight into the long-CoT RL. Based on our empirical results, we propose a systematic guideline and a novel Re-RFT method for constructing a better RL start point.

Despite significant progress in neural topic modeling, effectively distinguishing document representations as well as topic embeddings remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose a novel method called \*\*En\*\*hancing Global \*\*C\*\*lustering with \*\*O\*\*ptimal \*\*T\*\*ransport in Topic Modeling (EnCOT). Our approach utilizes an abstract global clusters concept to capture global information and then employs the Optimal Transport framework to align document representations in the topic space with global clusters, while also aligning global clusters with topics. This dual alignment not only enhances the separation of documents in the topic space but also facilitates learning of latent topics. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that... | Tu Vu, Manh Do, Tung Nguyen, Ngo Van Linh, Sang Dinh, Thien Huu Nguyen |  |

However, when applied to lemmatisation or morphological analysis, fine-tuning has not yet achieved competitive results. This paper explores various approaches to combine morphological features to both reduce label complexity and enhance multi-task training. Specifically, we group three nominal features into a single label, and combine the three most distinctive features of verbs into another unified label. These combined labels are used to fine-tune DBBERT, a BERT model pre-trained on both ancient and modern Greek. Additionally, we experiment with joint training – both among these labels and in combination with POS tagging – within a multi-task framework to improve performance by transferring parameters. To evaluate our models, we use a manually annotated gold standard from the Database of Byzantine Book Epigrams. Our results show a nearly 9 pp. improvement,... | Colin Swaelens, Ilse De Vos, Els Lefever |  |

However, users without technical expertise often turn to (untrustworthy) third-party services, such as prompt engineering, to enhance their LLM experience, creating vulnerabilities to adversarial threats like backdoor attacks. Backdoor-compromised LLMs generate malicious outputs to users when inputs contain specific “triggers” set by attackers. Traditional defense strategies, originally designed for small-scale models, are impractical for API-accessible LLMs due to limited model access, high computational costs, and data requirements. To address these limitations, we propose Chain-of-Scrutiny (CoS) which leverages LLMs’ unique reasoning abilities to mitigate backdoor attacks. It guides the LLM to generate reasoning steps for a given input and scrutinizes for consistency with the final output – any inconsistencies indicating a potential attack. It is... | Xi Li, Ruofan Mao, Yusen Zhang, Renze Lou, Chen Wu, Jiaqi Wang |  |

Despite current advancements, truncation methods struggle with limited capacity, unstable training and inconsistency of selected threshold. To address these problems we introduce TMP Adapter, a novel approach that builds upon the improved adapter model and incorporates the Threshold Margin Penalty (TMP) as an additive loss function to calibrate ranking model relevance scores for ranked list truncation. We evaluate TMP Adapter’s performance on various retrieval datasets and observe that TMP Adapter is a promising advancement in the calibration methods, which offers both theoretical and practical benefits for ranked list truncation. | Pavel Posokhov, Sergei Masliukhin, Skrylnikov Stepan, Danil Tirskikh, Olesia Makhnytkina |  |

Although large language models (LLMs) excel in TST tasks, they often face unidirectional issues due to imbalanced training data and their tendency to generate safer responses. These challenges present a significant obstacle in achieving effective style transfer. To address this issue, we propose a novel method for text style transfer based on neuron activation modulation (NAM-TST). This approach identifies neurons related to style through gradient-based activation difference analysis and calculates the activation differences between the source and target styles. During text generation, we use the activation difference to align the activation values of style-related neurons with those of the target style to guide the model in performing the transfer. This strategy enables the model to generate text that satisfies specific style requirements, effectively mitigating the unidirectional... | Chaona Kong, Jianyi Liu, Yifan Tang, Ru Zhang |  |

Nonetheless, most existing TEC-VQA benchmarks focus on high-resource languages like English and Chinese. Despite pioneering works expanding multilingual QA pairs in non-text-centric VQA datasets through translation engines, the translation-based protocol encounters a substantial “visual-textual misalignment” problem when applied to TEC-VQA. Specifically, it prioritizes the text in question-answer pairs while disregarding the visual text present in images. Moreover, it fails to address complexities related to nuanced meaning, contextual distortion, language bias, and question-type diversity. In this work, we tackle multilingual TEC-VQA by introducing MTVQA, the first benchmark featuring high-quality human expert annotations... | Jingqun Tang, Qi Liu, Yongjie Ye, Jinghui Lu, Shu Wei, AnLan Wang, Chunhui Lin, Hao Feng, Zhen Zhao, Yanjie Wang, Yuliang Liu, Hao Liu, Xiang Bai, Can Huang |  |

We introduce HICD, a novel method designed to induce hallucinations for contrastive decoding to mitigate hallucinations. Unlike existing contrastive decoding methods, HICD selects attention heads crucial to the model’s prediction as inducing heads, then induces hallucinations by dispersing attention of these inducing heads and compares the hallucinated outputs with the original outputs to obtain the final result. Our approach significantly improves performance on tasks requiring contextual faithfulness, such as context completion, reading comprehension, and question answering. It also improves factuality in tasks requiring accurate knowledge recall. We demonstrate that our inducing heads selection and attention dispersion method leads to more “contrast-effective” hallucinations for contrastive decoding, outperforming other hallucination-inducing... | Xinyan Jiang, Hang Ye, Yongxin Zhu, Xiaoying Zheng, Zikang Chen, Jun Gong |  |

While previous studies have proposed decoding strategies to mitigate repetition, the underlying mechanism behind this issue remains insufficiently explored. In this work, we investigate the root causes of repetition in LLMs through the lens of mechanistic interpretability. Inspired by recent advances in Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), which enable monosemantic feature extraction, we propose a novel approach—”Duplicatus Charm”—to induce and analyze the Repeat Curse. Our method systematically identifies “Repetition Features” -the key model activations responsible for generating repetitive outputs. First, we locate the layers most involved in repetition through logit analysis. Next, we extract and stimulate relevant features using SAE-based activation manipulation. To validate our approach, we construct a... | Junchi Yao, Shu Yang, Jianhua Xu, Lijie Hu, Mengdi Li, Di Wang |  |

Inspired by the human process of second language acquisition, particularly code-switching—the practice of language alternation in a conversation—we propose code-switching curriculum learning (CSCL) to enhance cross-lingual transfer for LLMs. CSCL mimics the stages of human language learning by progressively training models with a curriculum consisting of 1) token-level code-switching, 2) sentence-level code-switching, and 3) monolingual corpora. Using Qwen 2 as our underlying model, we demonstrate the efficacy of the CSCL in improving language transfer to Korean, achieving significant performance gains compared to monolingual continual pre-training methods. Ablation studies reveal that both token- and sentence-level code-switching significantly enhance cross-lingual transfer... | Haneul Yoo, Cheonbok Park, Sangdoo Yun, Alice Oh, Hwaran Lee |  |

When subjected to jailbreak attacks, their ability to generate more targeted and organized content can lead to greater harm. Although some studies claim that reasoning enables safer LRMs against existing LLM attacks, they overlook the inherent flaws within the reasoning process itself. To address this gap, we propose the first jailbreak attack targeting LRMs, exploiting their unique vulnerabilities stemming from the advanced reasoning capabilities. Specifically, we introduce a Chaos Machine, a novel component to transform attack prompts with diverse one-to-one mappings. The chaos mappings iteratively generated by the machine are embedded into the reasoning chain, which strengthens the variability and complexity and also promotes a more robust attack. Based on this, we... | Yang Yao, Xuan Tong, Ruofan Wang, Yixu Wang, Lujundong Li, Liang Liu, Yan Teng, Yingchun Wang |  |

Existing methods typically rely on a fixed set of strategies to evolve, which require manual design and are monolithic in form. In addition, iterative evolution also makes the acquisition of hard samples expensive. In view of this, we propose the Tag-Evol framework, a more diverse and efficient instruction evolving method. Specifically, Tag-Evol uses diverse and specific knowledge tags as strategies to achieve controlled evolution by injecting different combinations of tags into the original instructions. Experiments with multiple backbones in mathematical and code domain benchmarks show that the proposed method generates significantly better evolved data than other methods. Furthermore, we conduct a thorough analysis of the evolved data, demonstrating that Tag-Evol is not only efficient but also generates more diverse and challenging data. | Yixuan Wang, Shiqi Zhou, Chuanzhe Guo, Qingfu Zhu |  |

Understanding these vulnerabilities through black-box jailbreak attacks, which better reflect real-world scenarios, offers critical insights into model robustness. While existing methods have shown improvements through various prompt engineering techniques, their success remains limited against safety-aligned models, overlooking a more fundamental problem: the effectiveness is inherently bounded by the predefined strategy spaces. However, expanding this space presents significant challenges in both systematically capturing essential attack patterns and efficiently navigating the increased complexity. To better explore the potential of expanding the strategy space, we address these challenges through a novel framework that decomposes jailbreak strategies into essential components based on the Elaboration Likelihood... | Yao Huang, Yitong Sun, Shouwei Ruan, Yichi Zhang, Yinpeng Dong, Xingxing Wei |  |

Gender rewriting, an NLP task that involves automatically detecting and replacing gendered forms with neutral or opposite forms (e.g., from masculine to feminine), can be employed to mitigate these biases. While such systems have been developed in a number of languages (English, Arabic, Portuguese, German, French), automatic use of gender neutralization techniques (as opposed to inclusive or gender-switching techniques) has only been studied for English.

Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) aim to identify and evaluate all relevant papers on a topic. After retrieving a set of candidate papers, the abstract screening phase determines initial relevance. To date, abstract screening methods using large language models (LLMs) focus on binary classification settings; existing question answering (QA) based ranking approaches suffer from error propagation. LLMs offer a unique opportunity to evaluate the SLR’s inclusion and exclusion criteria, yet, existing benchmarks do not provide them exhaustively. We manually extract these criteria as well as research questions for 57 SLRs, mostly in the medical domain, enabling principled comparisons between approaches. Moreover, we propose LGAR, a zero-shot LLM Guided Abstract Ranker composed of an LLM based graded relevance scorer and a dense re-ranker. Our extensive experiments show that LGAR outperforms... | Christian Jaumann, Andreas Wiedholz, Annemarie Friedrich |  |

While English has received tremendous interest, Morphologically Rich Languages (MRLs) like Hebrew, require more research. In this paper, we address the evaluation of Hebrew NLI models by introducing LCHAIM, a dataset designed to evaluate these models on tasks involving long premises and complex reasoning. The dataset, created by translating and validating the English ConTRoL dataset, consists of 8,325 context-hypothesis pairs that require coreferential, temporal, logical and analytical reasoning. Our experiments show the difficulty of contextual reasoning in Hebrew, as evidenced by the performance of different models. Fine-tuning the LongHero model on both the shorter premise Hebrew NLI and the LCHAIM datasets yielded a mean accuracy of 52%, that is 35% less than human performance. Similarly, Large language Models (LLMs)... | Ehud Malul, Oriel Perets, Ziv Mor, Yigal Kassel, Elior Sulem |  |

Many existing methods utilize deep learning models to obtain code representations for vulnerability detection. However, these approaches predominantly capture the overall semantics of the code rather than its intrinsic vulnerability-specific semantics. To address this issue, we propose CLeVeR, the first approach that leverages contrastive learning to generate precise vulnerability code representations under the supervision of vulnerability descriptions. Specifically, we introduce an Adapter, a Representation Refinement module, and a Description Simulator to mitigate the challenges of semantic misalignment and imbalance between code and descriptions, and input data inconsistency between pre-training and fine-tuning stages, respectively. For vulnerability detection and classification tasks, CLeVeR achieves F1 scores of 72.82% (real-world dataset) and 80.34%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods (SOTAs) by 11.85% and... | Jiayuan Li, Lei Cui, Sen Zhao, Yun Yang, Lun Li, Hongsong Zhu |  |

MEMIT, a prominent batch editing algorithm, stands out for its capability to perform mass knowledge modifications. However, we uncovers a critical limitation that MEMIT’s editing efficacy significantly deteriorates when processing batches containing multiple edits sharing the same subject. Our analysis reveals the root cause lies in MEMIT’s key-value modeling framework: when multiple facts with the same subject in a batch are modeled through MEMIT’s key-value mechanism, identical keys (derived from the shared subject) are forced to represent different values (corresponding to distinct knowledge), resulting in update conflicts during editing. Addressing this issue, we propose MEMIT-Merge, an enhanced approach that merges value computation processes for facts sharing the same subject, effectively resolving... | Zilu Dong, Xiangqing Shen, Rui Xia |  |

Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools in enabling nuanced, knowledge-intensive conversations, thus aiding in complex decision-making tasks. With the burgeoning expectation to harness LLMs for predictive analysis, there is an urgent need to systematically assess their capability in this domain. However, there are no relevant evaluations in existing studies. To bridge this gap, we introduce the PredictiQ benchmark, which integrates 1130 sophisticated predictive analysis queries originating from 44 real-world datasets of 8 diverse fields. We design an evaluation protocol considering text analysis, code generation, and their alignment. Twelve renowned LLMs are evaluated, offering insights into their practical use in predictive analysis. | Qin Chen, Yuanyi Ren, Xiaojun Ma, Yuyang Shi |  |

Typical text generation approaches adopt an auto-regressive generation without deliberate reasoning, often leading to untrustworthy and factually inaccurate responses. In this paper, we propose HaluSearch, a novel framework that incorporates tree search-based algorithms (e.g., MCTS) to enable an explicit slow thinking generation process for mitigating hallucinations during inference. Specifically, HaluSearch frames text generation as a step-by-step reasoning process, using a self-evaluation reward model to score each generation step and guide the tree search towards the most reliable generation pathway. To balance efficiency and quality, we introduce a hierarchical system switch mechanism, which dynamically switches between fast and slow thinking modes at both instance and step levels. We conduct extensive experiments on both English and Chinese datasets, and the results show... | Xiaoxue Cheng, Junyi Li, Xin Zhao, JiRong Wen |  |

This method has been widely applied in tasks such as Question Answering (QA). However, existing RAG methods struggle with open-domain QA tasks because they perform independent retrieval operations and directly incorporate the retrieved information into generation without maintaining a summarizing memory or using adaptive retrieval strategies, leading to noise from redundant information and insufficient information integration.To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive memory-based optimization for enhanced RAG (Amber) for open-domain QA tasks, which comprises an Agent-based Memory Updater, an Adaptive Information Collector, and a Multi-granular Content Filter, working together within an iterative memory updating paradigm. Specifically, Amber... | Qitao Qin, Yucong Luo, Yihang Lu, Zhibo Chu, Xiaoman Liu, Xianwei Meng |  |

However, conventional KD approaches primarily focus on homogeneous architectures with identical tokenizers, constraining their applicability in cross-architecture scenarios. As for the cross-tokenizer KD, the differences in the tokenizers give rise to two fundamental challenges: (1) sequence misalignment caused by divergent tokenization strategies, and (2) mismatched vocabulary size and composition. While existing probability-matching methods attempt to address these issues, their efficacy remains limited due to suboptimal alignment in both the sequence and vocabulary aspects. To overcome these limitations, we propose Contextual Dynamic Mapping (CDM), a novel cross-tokenizer distillation framework that employs contextual information to enhance sequence alignment precision and dynamically improves vocabulary mapping. We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach across five advanced and widely-used... | Yijie Chen, Yijin Liu, Fandong Meng, Yufeng Chen, Jinan Xu, Jie Zhou |  |

However, full finetuning is usually costly. Existing work, such as parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT), often focuses on how to finetune but neglects the issue of where to finetune. As a pioneering work on reducing the cost of backpropagation (at the layer level) by answering where to finetune, we conduct a semantic analysis of the LM inference process. We first propose using transition traces of the latent representation to compute deviations (or loss). Then, using a derived formula of scaling law, we estimate the gain of each layer in reducing deviation (or loss). Further, we narrow down the scope for finetuning, and also, study the cost-benefit balance of LM finetuning. We perform extensive experiments across well-known LMs and datasets. The results show that our approach is effective and efficient, and outperforms the existing baselines. Our approach is orthogonal to other... | Jian Gu, Aldeida Aleti, Chunyang Chen, Hongyu Zhang |  |

However, the scarcity of long-context summarization datasets hinders progress in this area. To address this, we introduce CNNSum, a multi-scale long-context summarization benchmark based on Chinese novels, featuring human-driven annotations across four subsets totaling 695 samples, with lengths ranging from 16k to 128k. We benchmark numerous LLMs and conduct detailed human assessments to summarize abnormal output types. Furthermore, we extensively explore how to improve long-context summarization. In our study: (1) Advanced LLMs may generate much subjective commentary, leading to vague summaries. (2) Currently, long-context summarization mainly relies on memory ability. The advantages of Large LLMs are hard to utilize, thus small LLMs are more cost-effective. (3) Different prompt types paired with various version models may cause large performance gaps. In further fine-tuning, these can be mitigated,... | Lingxiao Wei, He Yan, Xiangju Lu, Junmin Zhu, Jun Wang, Wei Zhang |  |

A critical yet underexplored challenge in RAG is document segmentation, also known as document chunking. Existing widely-used rule-based chunking methods usually lead to suboptimal splits, where overly large chunks introduce irrelevant information and small chunks lack semantic coherence. Existing semantic-based approaches either require costly LLM calls or fail to adaptively group contextually related sentences. To address these limitations, we propose PIC, Pseudo-Instruction for document Chunking), a simple yet effective method that leverages document summaries as pseudo-instructions to guide chunking. By computing semantic similarity between sentences and the summary, PIC dynamically groups sentences into chunks that align with the document’s key themes, ensuring semantic completeness and relevance to potential user instructions. Experiments on multiple open-domain... | Zhitong Wang, Cheng Gao, Chaojun Xiao, Yufei Huang, Shuzheng Si, Kangyang Luo, Yuzhuo Bai, Wenhao Li, Tangjian Duan, Chuancheng Lv, Guoshan Lu, Gang Chen, Fanchao Qi, Maosong Sun |  |

Existing methods for benchmarking the uncertainty of LLMs face three key challenges: the need for internal model access, additional training, or high computational costs. This is particularly unfavorable for closed-source models. To this end, we introduce UBench, a new benchmark for evaluating the uncertainty of LLMs. Unlike other benchmarks, UBench is based on confidence intervals. It encompasses 11,978 multiple-choice questions spanning knowledge, language, understanding, and reasoning capabilities. Based on this, we conduct extensive experiments. This includes comparisons with other advanced uncertainty estimation methods, the assessment of the uncertainty of 20 LLMs, and an exploration of the effects of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts, role-playing (RP) prompts, and temperature on model uncertainty. Our analysis reveals several... | Xunzhi Wang, Zhuowei Zhang, Gaonan Chen, Qiongyu Li, Bitong Luo, Zhixin Han, Haotian Wang, Zhiyu Li, Hang Gao, Mengting Hu |  |

It is an important problem in intelligent transportation systems, with a plethora of methods being proposed. Existing efforts mainly focus on capturing and utilizing spatio-temporal dependencies to predict future traffic flows. Though promising, they fall short in adapting to test-time environmental changes in traffic conditions. To tackle this challenge, we propose to introduce large language models (LLMs) to help traffic flow forecasting and design a novel method named Large Language Model Enhanced Traffic Flow Predictor (LEAF). LEAF adopts two branches, capturing different spatio-temporal relations using graph and hypergraph structures, respectively. The two branches are first pre-trained individually, and during test time, they yield different predictions. Based on these predictions, a large language model is used to select the most likely result. Then, a... | Yusheng Zhao, Xiao Luo, Haomin Wen, Zhiping Xiao, Wei Ju, Ming Zhang |  |

To promote further research on flowchart-based code generation, this work presents Flow2Code, a novel benchmark for flowchart-based code generation evaluation. The evaluation dataset spans 15 programming languages and includes 5,622 code segments paired with 16,866 flowcharts of three types: code, UML, and pseudocode. Extensive experiments with 13 multimodal LLMs reveal that current LLMs can not generate code based on flowcharts perfectly. Besides, experiment results show that the supervised fine-tuning technique contributes greatly to the models’ performance. The dataset will be publicly available. | Mengliang He, Jiayi Zeng, Yankai Jiang, Wei Zhang, Zeming Liu, Xiaoming Shi, Aimin Zhou |  |

We study performance-focused ACT, or PACT, which invests more computation on hard steps to improve performance, such as by adding forward passes. We first discuss beam search and hesitation-based methods as PACT and their limitations. While the hesitation-based approach outperforms beam search by perturbing input embeddings, it suffers from inefficiency due to invalidating KVCache and exhibits instability due to its reliance on randomness. To address this, we propose IMPACT, a novel PACT method that perturbs network weights rather than input embeddings. This approach enables the reuse of KVCache, offers deterministic predictions, and significantly improves memory and computational efficiency. By achieving a better balance between performance and efficiency, IMPACT makes PACT accessible to communities with consumer-grade hardware. | Romain Storaï, Jaeseong Lee, Seungwon Hwang |  |

Traditional approaches adopt schema linking to first eliminate redundant tables and columns and prompt LLMs for SQL generation. However, they often struggle with accurately identifying corresponding tables and columns, due to discrepancies in naming conventions between natural language questions (NL) and database schemas. Besides, existing methods overlook the challenge of effectively transforming structure information from NL into SQL. To address these limitations, we introduce UCS-SQL, a novel text-to-SQL framework, uniting both content and structure pipes to bridge the gap between NL and SQL. Specifically, the content pipe focuses on identifying key content within the original content, while the structure pipe is dedicated to transforming the linguistic structure from NL... | Zhenhe Wu, Zhongqiu Li, Jie Zhang, Zhongjiang He, Jian Yang, Yu Zhao, Ruiyu Fang, Bing Wang, Hongyan Xie, Shuangyong Song, Zhoujun Li |  |

Recent advancements have focused on optimizing the thought process of code generation, achieving significant improvements. However, such thought process lacks effective process supervision, making it hard to optimize the thoughts. Although Process Reward Models (PRMs) have been widely established in mathematical reasoning, building a code PRM is still not trivial for the gap between thoughts to code. In this paper, we propose CodePRM, a novel approach that leverages the code execution feedback to build a code PRM. Specifically, we first collect a large dataset of thought traces, where each thought step is labeled with their derived code’ pass rates, accompanied by the corresponding code snippets, and execution feedback. During training, we train a PRM to take both the reasoning process and code execution feedback as input to score individual thought steps, enabling it to leverage code execution results to... | Qingyao Li, Xinyi Dai, Xiangyang Li, Weinan Zhang, Yasheng Wang, Ruiming Tang, Yong Yu |  |

In this paper, we introduce STEM-PoM, a comprehensive benchmark dataset designed to evaluate LLMs’ reasoning abilities on math symbols within contextual scientific text. The dataset, sourced from real-world ArXiv documents, contains over 2K math symbols classified as main attributes of variables, constants, operators, and unit descriptors, with additional sub-attributes including scalar/vector/matrix for variables and local/global/discipline-specific labels for both constants and operators.

Building upon prior studies on contrastive decoding that address this issue without requiring additional model training, we introduce RVCD (Retrieval Visual Contrastive Decoding), an advanced method to suppress OH. RVCD leverages both negative and positive images at the logit level, explicitly referencing AI-generated images designed to represent a single concept. Our approach demonstrates substantial improvements over existing decoding-based methods. | Jihoon Lee, Min Song |  |

However, despite being the fifth most-spoken language globally, Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) in Bangla remains underdeveloped. In this work, we investigate how LLMs can be leveraged for improving Bangla GEC. For that, we first do an extensive categorization of 12 error classes in Bangla, and take a survey of native Bangla speakers to collect real-world errors. We next devise a rule-based noise injection method to create grammatically incorrect sentences corresponding to correct ones. The Vaiyākaraṇa dataset, thus created, consists of 5,67,422 sentences of which 2,27,119 are erroneous. This dataset is then used to instruction-tune LLMs for the task of GEC in Bangla. Evaluations show that instruction-tuning with Vaiyākaraṇa improves GEC performance of LLMs by 3-7 percentage points as compared to the zero-shot setting, and makes them achieve... | Pramit Bhattacharyya, Arnab Bhattacharya |  |

Existing methods still struggle with these dual requirements, leading to questions that lack depth and distractors that are either too obvious or irrelevant. In this paper, we propose BiFlow, a novel framework that integrates bidirectional reasoning perspectives: teacher reasoning generates contextually relevant questions and plausible distractors, while student reasoning evaluates question clarity and the misleading nature of the distractors. To further enhance reasoning, we introduce PathFinder, a mechanism that employs breadth-first search and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategies to explore diverse reasoning paths, improving both the quality and diversity of generated questions and distractors. Additionally, we enrich the FairytaleQA dataset to FairytaleMCQ with high-quality distractors, providing a robust benchmark for... | Yimiao Qiu, Yang Deng, Quanming Yao, Zhimeng Zhang, Zhiang Dong, Chang Yao, Jingyuan Chen |  |

However, the limited labeled multimodal data often hinders embedding performance. Recent approaches have leveraged data synthesis to address this problem, yet the quality of synthetic data remains a critical bottleneck. In this work, we identify three criteria for high-quality synthetic multimodal data. First, broad scope ensures that the generated data covers diverse tasks and modalities, making it applicable to various downstream scenarios. Second, robust cross-modal alignment makes different modalities semantically consistent. Third, high fidelity ensures that the synthetic data maintains realistic details to enhance its reliability. Guided by these principles, we synthesize datasets that: (1) cover a wide range of tasks, modality combinations, and languages, (2) are generated via a deep thinking process... | Haonan Chen, Liang Wang, Nan Yang, Yutao Zhu, Ziliang Zhao, Furu Wei, Zhicheng Dou |  |

We present Word2Passage, a novel approach that improves retrieval accuracy by optimizing word importance in query expansion. Our method generates references at word, sentence, and passage levels for query expansion, then determines word importance by considering both their reference level origin and characteristics derived from query types and corpus analysis. Specifically, our method assigns distinct importance scores to words based on whether they originate from word, sentence, or passage-level references. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Word2Passage outperforms existing methods across various datasets and LLM configurations, effectively enhancing both retrieval accuracy and generation quality.

We present MECoT (Markov Emotional Chain-of-Thought), a framework that enhances LLMs’ ability to generate authentic personality-driven dialogues through stochastic emotional transitions. Inspired by dual-process theory, MECoT combines a Markov-chain-driven emotional processor for intuitive responses with an LLM-based reasoning mechanism for rational regulation, mapped onto a 12-dimensional Emotion Circumplex Model. The framework dynamically adjusts emotional transitions using personality-weighted matrices and historical context, ensuring both emotional coherence and character consistency.

Leveraging Knowledge Graphs (KGs) as external knowledge sources has emerged as a viable solution. However, existing KG-enhanced methods, either retrieval-based or agent-based, encounter difficulties in accurately retrieving knowledge and efficiently traversing KGs at scale. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, FiDeLiS, designed to improve the factuality of LLM responses by anchoring answers to verifiable reasoning steps retrieved from KGs. To achieve this, we leverage step-wise beam search with a deductive scoring function, allowing the LLM to validate reasoning process step by step, and halt the search once the question is deducible. In addition, we propose a Path-RAG module to pre-select a smaller candidate set for each beam search step, reducing computational costs by narrowing the search space. Extensive experiments show that our... | Yuan Sui, Yufei He, Nian Liu, Xiaoxin He, Kun Wang, Bryan Hooi |  |

Evaluation of the existing methods for cross-lingual knowledge editing (CKE) is limited both w.r.t. edit effectiveness: benchmarks do not account for entity aliases and use faulty entity translations; as well as robustness: existing work fails to report on downstream generation and task-solving abilities of LLMs after editing. In this work, we aim to (i) maximize the effectiveness of CKE while at the same time (ii) minimizing the extent of downstream model collapse due to the edits. To accurately measure the effectiveness of CKE methods, we introduce BabelEdits, a new CKE benchmark covering 60 languages that combines high-quality multilingual synsets from BabelNet with marker-based translation to ensure entity translation quality.

Some approaches utilize synthetic data generated by advanced LLMs based on evaluation results to train models. However, conventional evaluation methods fail to provide detailed, fine-grained profiles of LLMs, limiting their guidance for data synthesis. In this paper, we introduce the \*\*Cognitive Diagnostic Synthesis\*\* (CDS) method, which incorporates a diagnostic process inspired by \*\*Cognitive Diagnosis Theory\*\* (CDT) to refine evaluation results and characterize model profiles at the knowledge component level. Based on these diagnostics, we propose two diagnosis-synthesis strategies for weakness-targeted data synthesis.

Previous methods typically relied on simple features to measure the relevance between examples. We argue that these features are not sufficient to reflect the intrinsic connections between examples. In this study, we propose a curriculum ICL strategy guided by problem-solving logic. We select demonstration examples by analyzing the problem-solving logic and order them based on curriculum learning. Specifically, we constructed a problem-solving logic instruction set based on the BREAK dataset and fine-tuned a language model to analyze the problem-solving logic of examples. Subsequently, we selected appropriate demonstration examples based on problem-solving logic and assessed their difficulty according to the number of problem-solving steps.

To address this gap, we introduce BESSTIE, a benchmark for sentiment and sarcasm classification for three varieties of English: Australian (en-AU), Indian (en-IN), and British (en-UK). Using web-based content from two domains, namely, Google Place reviews and Reddit comments, we collect datasets for these language varieties using two methods: location-based and topic-based filtering. Native speakers of the language varieties manually annotate the datasets with sentiment and sarcasm labels. To assess whether the dataset accurately represents these varieties, we conduct two validation steps: (a) manual annotation of language varieties and (b) automatic language variety prediction.

High-performance navigation models require a large amount of training data, the high cost of manually annotating data has seriously hindered this field. Therefore, some previous methods translate trajectory videos into step-by-step instructions for expanding data, but such instructions do not match well with users’ communication styles that briefly describe destinations or state specific needs. Moreover, local navigation trajectories overlook global context and high-level task planning. To address these issues, we propose NavRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that generates user demand instructions for VLN. NavRAG leverages LLM to build a hierarchical scene description tree for 3D scene understanding from global layout to local details, then simulates various user roles with specific demands to retrieve... | Zihan Wang, Yaohui Zhu, Gim Hee Lee, Yachun Fan |  |

In this paper, we introduce SQLForge, a novel approach for synthesizing reliable and diverse data to enhance text-to-SQL reasoning in LLMs. We improve data reliability through SQL syntax constraints and SQL-to-question reverse translation, ensuring data logic at both structural and semantic levels. We also propose an SQL template enrichment and iterative data domain exploration mechanism to boost data diversity. Building on the augmented data, we fine-tune a variety of open-source models with different architectures and parameter sizes, resulting in a family of models termed SQLForge-LM. SQLForge-LM achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the widely recognized Spider and BIRD benchmarks among the open-source models. Specifically, SQLForge-LM achieves EX accuracy of... | Yu Guo, Dong Jin, Shenghao Ye, Shuangwu Chen, Jianyang Jianyang, Xiaobin Tan |  |

However, PRMs still struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) challenges. This paper identifies the OOD issues including step OOD, arising from differences in reasoning patterns across model types and sizes, and question OOD, due to dataset shifts between training and real-world problems. To address these issues, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Process Reward Model (RetrievalPRM), a novel framework designed to tackle these OOD issues. By utilizing a two-stage retrieval-enhanced mechanism, RetrievalPRM retrieves semantically similar questions and steps for PRM as a warmup to stimulate its potential to judge target steps, improving generalization and reasoning consistency across different models and problem types. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RetrievalPRM outperforms existing baselines... | Jiachen Zhu, Congmin Zheng, Jianghao Lin, Kounianhua Du, Ying Wen, Yong Yu, Jun Wang, Weinan Zhang |  |

Direct task-specific fine-tuning is limited by overfitting risks, data requirements, and computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose a scalable, two-stage training approach: (1) A task-independent speech pretraining stage using contrastive learning to align text and speech representations over all layers, followed by (2) a task-specific fine-tuning stage requiring minimal data. This approach outperforms traditional ASR pretraining and enables the model to surpass models specialized on speech translation and question answering while being trained on only 10% of the task-specific data. | Maike Züfle, Jan Niehues |  |

While FlashAttention is the most widely used and effective GPU-aware acceleration algorithm, it must require time-consuming and hardware-specific manual implementation, limiting adaptability across GPU architectures. Existing LLMs have shown a lot of promise in code generation tasks, but struggle to generate high-performance attention code. The key challenge is it cannot comprehend the complex data flow and computation process of the attention operator and utilize low-level primitive to exploit GPU performance.To address the above challenge, we propose an LLM-friendly Thinking Language (LLM-TL) to help LLMs decouple the generation of high-level optimization logic and low-level implementation on GPU, and enhance LLMs’ understanding of attention operator.Along with a 2-stage reasoning workflow, TL-Code generation and translation, the LLMs can... | Qirui Zhou, Shaohui Peng, Weiqiang Xiong, Haixin Chen, Yuanbo Wen, Haochen Li, Ling Li, Qi Guo, Yongwei Zhao, Ke Gao, Ruizhi Chen, Yanjun Wu, Zhao Chen, Yunji Chen |  |

However, many LLMs still encounter challenges in reasoning, especially for LLMs with fewer parameters or insufficient pre-training data. Through our experiments, we identify that noise accumulation across layers often leads to unstable token predictions during reasoning. We find that contrasting the probability distributions across layers effectively mitigates this interference. Building on this insight, we propose Adaptive Layer-Wise contrastive decoding (ALW), a novel framework that enhances reasoning ability by dynamically disentangling noise in shallow layers from critical signals in deep layers. Extensive experiments on several reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ALW consistently improves answer accuracy across multiple LLMs while maintaining inference efficiency. For example, we achieve a 48% improvement on the Gsm8k using the LLaMA-7B model and an absolute accuracy increase of... | Yuechi Zhou, Chuyue Zhou, Jianxin Zhang, Juntao Li, Min Zhang |  |

To address this critical issue, we propose Mixture of Decoding (MoD), a novel approach for hallucination mitigation that dynamically adapts decoding strategies by evaluating the correctness of the model’s attention on image tokens. Specifically, MoD measures the consistency between outputs generated from the original image tokens and those derived from the model’s attended image tokens, to distinguish the correctness aforementioned. If the outputs are consistent, indicating correct attention, MoD employs a complementary strategy to amplify critical information. Conversely, if the outputs are inconsistent, suggesting erroneous attention, MoD utilizes a contrastive strategy to suppress misleading information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoD significantly outperforms existing decoding methods across... | Xinlong Chen, Yuanxing Zhang, Qiang Liu, Junfei Wu, Fuzheng Zhang, Tieniu Tan |  |

This paper introduces VidCapBench, a video caption evaluation scheme specifically designed for T2V generation, agnostic to any particular caption format. VidCapBench employs a data annotation pipeline, combining expert model labeling and human refinement, to associate each collected video with key information spanning video aesthetics, content, motion, and physical laws. VidCapBench then partitions these key information attributes into automatically assessable and manually assessable subsets, catering to both the rapid evaluation needs of agile development and the accuracy requirements of thorough validation. By evaluating numerous state-of-the-art captioning models, we demonstrate the superior stability and comprehensiveness of VidCapBench compared to existing video... | Xinlong Chen, Yuanxing Zhang, Chongling Rao, Yushuo Guan, Jiaheng Liu, Fuzheng Zhang, Chengru Song, Qiang Liu, Di Zhang, Tieniu Tan |  |

Few-Shot-CoT relies on task-specific, manually labeled demonstrations, limiting its generalization to unseen tasks. While Zero-Shot-CoT eliminates this reliance, it often underperforms. To address this, existing methods aim to automatically generate demonstrations in zero-shot settings. However, these generated demonstrations face challenges due to demonstration bias: 1) selected demonstrations may contain errors, and 2) they may not be suitable or representative enough for all questions. To mitigate these biases, we propose Global Coevolutionary Reasoning (GCR). The method first applies Zero-Shot-CoT to answer all questions, then clusters the results. For each cluster, a random sample is selected, and these selected samples serve as demonstrations for each other. The model then iteratively re-answers the questions and updates their rationales based on these... | Chuan Gou, Bangwei Li, Jianhua Dai, Xiaoyang Han, Ming Cai |  |

Unfortunately, in the context of machine translation, previous work mainly focused on documenting robustness failures or improving robustness. In contrast, we study robustness from a model representation perspective by looking at internal model representations of ungrammatical inputs and how they evolve through model layers. For this purpose, we perform Grammatical Error Detection (GED) probing and representational similarity analysis. Our findings indicate that the encoder first detects the grammatical error, then corrects it by moving its representation toward the correct form. To understand what contributes to this process, we turn to the attention mechanism where we identify what we term \*Robustness Heads\*. We find that \*Robustness Heads\* attend to interpretable linguistic units when responding to grammatical errors, and that when we fine-tune models for robustness, they tend to rely more on \*Robustness... | Abderrahmane Issam, Yusuf Can Semerci, Jan Scholtes, Gerasimos Spanakis |  |

Beyond the constraints of any specific non-linguistic modality, Omni-MLLMs map various non-linguistic modalities into the embedding space of LLMs and enable the interaction and understanding of arbitrary combinations of modalities within a single model. In this paper, we systematically investigate relevant research and provide a comprehensive survey of Omni-MLLMs. Specifically, we first explain the four core components of Omni-MLLMs for unified multi-modal modeling with a meticulous taxonomy that offers novel perspectives. Then, we introduce the effective integration achieved through two-stage training and discuss the corresponding datasets as well as evaluation. Furthermore, we summarize the main challenges of current Omni-MLLMs and outline future directions.

However, the best strategy to decide which cross-lingual data to include is unclear. Prior research often focuses on a small set of languages from a few language families and/or a single task. It is still an open question how these findings extend to a wider variety of languages and tasks. In this work, we analyze cross-lingual transfer for 263 languages from a wide variety of language families. Moreover, we include three popular NLP tasks: POS tagging, dependency parsing, and topic classification. Our findings indicate that the effect of linguistic similarity on transfer performance depends on a range of factors: the NLP task, the (mono- or multilingual) input representations, and the definition of linguistic similarity. | Verena Blaschke, Masha Fedzechkina, Maartje ter Hoeve |  |

In emergent communication, two artificial neural network agents develop a language while solving a communicative task. In this study, the agents play a concept-level reference game. This means that the speaker agent has to describe a concept to a listener agent, who has to pick the correct target objects that satisfy the concept. Concepts consist of multiple objects and can be either more specific, i.e. the target objects share many attributes, or more generic, i.e. the target objects share fewer attributes. We tested two directions of zero-shot generalization to novel levels of abstraction: When generalizing from more generic to very specific concepts, agents utilized a compositional strategy. When generalizing from more specific to very generic concepts, agents utilized a more flexible linguistic strategy that involves reusing many messages from training. Our results provide evidence that neural network agents can learn... | Kristina Kobrock, Xenia Ohmer, Elia Bruni, Nicole Gotzner |  |

Unfortunately, recent studies have discovered that there exist notable disparities in their performance across different languages. Understanding the underlying mechanisms behind such disparities is crucial ensuring equitable access to LLMs for a global user base. Therefore, this paper conducts a systematic investigation into the behaviors of LLMs across 27 different languages on 3 different scenarios, and reveals a Linguistic Map correlates with the richness of available resources and linguistic family relations. Specifically, high-resource languages within specific language family exhibit greater knowledge consistency and mutual information dissemination, while isolated or low-resource languages tend to remain marginalized.

We identify five core capabilities of LLMs using XFinBench, i.e., _terminology understanding_, _temporal reasoning_, _future forecasting_, _scenario planning_, and _numerical modelling_. Upon XFinBench, we conduct extensive experiments on 18 leading models. The result shows that o1 is the best-performing text-only model with an overall accuracy of 67.3%, but still lags significantly behind human experts with 12.5%, especially in temporal reasoning and scenario planning capabilities.

Such automatic instruction collection pipelines, however, inadvertently introduce significant variability in data quality. This paper introduces a novel instruction curation algorithm, derived from two unique perspectives, human and LLM preference alignment, to compress this vast corpus of machine-generated multimodal instructions to a compact and high-quality form: (i) For human preference alignment, we have collected a machine-generated multimodal instruction dataset and established a comprehensive set of both subjective and objective criteria to guide the data quality assessment critically from human experts. By doing so, a reward model was trained on the annotated dataset to internalize the nuanced human understanding of instruction alignment.

In this paper, we propose a post-training quantization framework with W(1+1)A(1×4) configuration, where weights are quantized to 1 bit with an additional 1 bit for fine-grain grouping and activations are quantized to 1 bit with a 4-fold increase in the number of channels. For weight quantization, we propose utilizing Hessian-aware fine-grained grouping along with an EM-based quantization scheme. For activation quantization, we decompose INT4-quantized activations into a 4 × INT1 format equivalently and simultaneously smooth the scaling factors based on quantization errors, which further reduces the quantization errors in activations. Our method surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLM quantization baselines on W2A4 across multiple tasks,... | Siqing Song, Chuang Wang, RuiQi Wang, Yi Yang, XuYao Zhang |  |

While deploying separate editing systems for each language might seem viable, this approach incurs substantial costs due to the need to manage multiple models. A more efficient solution involves integrating knowledge updates across all languages into a unified model. However, sequential edits across languages often lead to destructive parameter interference, significantly degrading multilingual generalization and the accuracy of injected knowledge. To address this issue, we propose LangEdit, a novel null-space constrained framework designed to precisely isolate language-specific knowledge updates. The core innovation of LangEdit lies in its ability to project parameter updates for each language onto the orthogonal complement of other languages’ subspaces. This approach mathematically guarantees update... | Wei Sun, Tingyu Qu, Mingxiao Li, Jesse Davis, MarieFrancine Moens |  |

To address this issue, we introduce the Tool-Awareness Training (TAT) method, designed to enhance scientific reasoning. This approach leverages both forward and backward data generation strategies to strengthen the model’s conscious and selective tool utilization in multi-step reasoning tasks. Our method unfolds in three stages: (1) developing tool-knowledge through backward tooluse data generation (2) enhancing tool-awareness in multi-step reasoning by utilizing forward reasoning data, and (3) improving domain adaptability through large-scale domain-specific data for multi-task learning. These three stages progressively establish the foundation for tool learning and scientific reasoning, effectively integrating both, enabling the model to tackle multi-domain scientific tasks while optimizing tool usage.

To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Multi-objective Preference Optimization (AMoPO), a novel framework that achieves dynamic balance across preference dimensions. By introducing the multi-objective optimization paradigm to use the dimension-aware generation metrics as implicit rewards, AMoPO aligns LLMs with diverse preferences without additional reward models or reference models. We introduce an adaptive weight assignment mechanism that models the generation space as a Gaussian distribution, allowing dynamic prioritization of preference dimensions. Empirical results demonstrate that AMoPO outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 28.5%, and the experiments on 7B, 14B, and 32B models reveal the scaling... | Qi Liu, Jingqing Ruan, Hao Li, Haodong Zhao, Desheng Wang, Jiansong Chen, Guanglu Wan, Xunliang Cai, Zhi Zheng, Tong Xu |  |

To address this limitation, we propose \*\*S\*\*upervised \*\*O\*\*ptimism \*\*C\*\*orrection (SOC), which introduces a simple yet effective auxiliary loss for token-level Q-value estimations during supervised fine-tuning.

While Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has shown promise in aligning LLMs with human preferences, it is less suitable for multi-step reasoning tasks because (1) DPO relies on paired preference data, which is not readily available for multi-step reasoning tasks, and (2) it treats all tokens uniformly, making it ineffective for credit assignment in multi-step reasoning tasks, which often come with sparse reward. In this work, we propose OREO (Offline REasoning Optimization), an offline RL method for enhancing LLM multi-step reasoning. Building on insights from previous works of maximum entropy reinforcement learning, it jointly learns a policy model and value function by optimizing the soft Bellman Equation.

This poses the risk of leaking inappropriate data such as benchmarks, personal information, and copyrighted texts in the training data. Membership Inference Attacks (MIA), which determine whether a given text is included in the model’s training data, have been attracting attention. Previous studies of MIAs revealed that likelihood-based classification is effective for detecting leaks in LLMs. However, the existing likelihood-based methods cannot be applied to some proprietary models like ChatGPT or Claude 3 because the likelihood for input text is unavailable to the user. In this study, we propose a Sampling-based Pseudo-Likelihood (SPL) method for MIA (SaMIA) that calculates SPL using only the text generated by an LLM to detect leaks. The SaMIA treats the target text as the reference text and multiple outputs from the LLM as text samples, calculates the... | Masahiro Kaneko, Youmi Ma, Yuki Wata, Naoaki Okazaki |  |

This limitation primarily stems from two factors: (1) the absence of reasoning data related to vulnerabilities, which hinders the models’ ability to capture underlying vulnerability patterns; and (2) their focus on learning semantic representations rather than the reason behind them, thus failing to recognize semantically similar vulnerability samples. Furthermore, the development of LLMs specialized in vulnerability detection is challenging, particularly in environments characterized by the scarcity of high-quality datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel framework ReVD that excels at mining vulnerability patterns through reasoning data synthesizing and vulnerability-specific preference optimization. Specifically, we construct forward and backward reasoning processes for vulnerability and corresponding... | XinCheng Wen, Yijun Yang, Cuiyun Gao, Yang Xiao, Deheng Ye |  |

Existing supervised detectors often overfit within their training domains, as they have primarily learned domain-specific textual features, such as word frequency, syntax, and semantics. In this paper, we introduce a domain-independent feature, namely the difference of writing strategy between LLMs and human, to improve the out-of-domain generalization capability of detectors. LLMs focus on the preceding range tokens when generating a token, while human consider multiple ranges, including bidirectional, global, and local contexts. The attention mask influences the range of tokens to which the model can attend. Therefore, we propose a method called M-RangeDetector, which integrates four distinct attention masking strategies into a Multi-Range Attention module, enabling the model to capture diverse writing strategies.

However, while closed-source models effectively retain and recall past utterances, whether open-source models share this ability remains unexplored. To fill this gap, we systematically evaluate how well open-source interaction models utilize past utterances using ContextDialog, a benchmark we proposed for this purpose. Our findings show that speech-based models have more difficulty than text-based ones, especially when recalling information conveyed in speech, and even with retrieval-augmented generation, models still struggle with questions about past utterances. These insights highlight key limitations in open-source models and suggest ways to improve memory retention and retrieval robustness. | Heeseung Kim, Che Hyun Lee, Sangkwon Park, Jiheum Yeom, Nohil Park, Sangwon Yu, Sungroh Yoon |  |

However, the success of task arithmetic relies on the linearity between model weight differences and output feature changes, which is often lacking in conventional fine-tuned models. In this work, we employ neuron description methods to analyze and classify neurons based on their functionalities. We theoretically demonstrate that grouping Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neurons by functionality enhances model linearity. Building on this, we propose a neuron-based task arithmetic merging method that consistently improves performance across various tasks and model scales. Our approach is complementary to existing merging techniques, achieving superior results in merging models fine-tuned on fundamental tasks like Math, Code and Translation. | Wangyun Gu, Qianghua Gao, LiXin Zhang, Xu Shen, Jieping Ye |  |

Do these models truly understand commonsense knowledge, or just memorize expression patterns? To investigate this question, we present the first extensive robustness evaluation of LLMs in commonsense reasoning. We introduce HellaSwag-Pro, a large-scale bilingual benchmark consisting of 11,200 cases, by designing and compiling seven types of question variants. To construct this benchmark, we propose a two-stage method to develop Chinese HellaSwag, a finely annotated dataset comprising 12,000 instances across 56 categories. We conduct extensive experiments on 41 representative LLMs, revealing that these LLMs are far from robust in commonsense reasoning. Furthermore, this robustness varies depending on the language in which the LLM is tested. This work establishes a high-quality evaluation benchmark, with extensive experiments... | Xiaoyuan Li, Moxin Li, Rui Men, Yichang Zhang, Keqin Bao, Wenjie Wang, Fuli Feng, Dayiheng Liu, Junyang Lin |  |

Recent research has focused on automated alignment, which involves developing alignment systems with minimal human intervention. However, prior research has predominantly focused on developing data generation methods, while insufficient attention has been paid to quality control mechanisms and often produces inaccurate and unhelpful data, leading to unpredictable benefits during iterative optimization. In this paper, we present Self-Steering Optimization (SSO), an algorithm that autonomously generates high-quality preference data, eliminating manual annotation requirements. SSO employs a specialized optimization objective to build a data generator from the policy model itself, which is used to produce accurate and on-policy data. We demonstrate SSO‘s effectiveness through comprehensive experiments on two series of models: Llama 3 and Qwen 2. Our evaluation across diverse benchmarks shows that SSO consistently... | Hao Xiang, Bowen Yu, Hongyu Lin, Keming Lu, Yaojie Lu, Xianpei Han, Ben He, Le Sun, Jingren Zhou, Junyang Lin |  |

However, these benchmarks often include overly simple or uninformative samples, making it difficult to effectively distinguish the performance of different MLLMs. Additionally, evaluating models across many benchmarks creates a significant computational burden. To address these issues, we propose LIME (Less Is More for MLLM Evaluation), a refined and efficient benchmark curated using a semi-automated pipeline. This pipeline filters out uninformative samples and eliminates answer leakage by focusing on tasks that require image-based understanding. Our experiments show that LIME reduces the number of samples by 76% and evaluation time by 77%, while it can more effectively distinguish different models’ abilities. Notably, we find that traditional automatic metrics like CIDEr are insufficient for evaluating MLLMs’ captioning performance, and excluding... | King Zhu, Qianbo Zang, Shian Jia, Siwei Wu, Feiteng Fang, Yizhi Li, Shuyue Guo, Tianyu Zheng, Jiawei Guo, Bo Li, Haoning Wu, Xingwei Qu, Jian Yang, Ruibo Liu, Xiang Yue, Jiaheng Liu, Chenghua Lin, Hamid AlinejadRokny, Min Yang, Shiwen Ni, Wenhao Huang, Ge Zhang |  |

While distilling large models into smaller ones offers a sustainable solution, current techniques—such as static knowledge distillation, resource-intensive reinforcement learning from human feedback, or limited self-reflection—struggle to yield substantial and lasting performance gains. In this paper, we present a novel Debate and Reflect (D&R) framework that orchestrates multi-turn debates between smaller models and stronger teacher models, eliciting actionable feedback (e.g., error analysis, corrective strategies) to guide student models. Further, we introduce Tree-structured Direct Preference Optimization (T-DPO) to efficiently leverage these debate logs, organizing interactions into a hierarchical format for effective training. Empirical evaluations across diverse NLP benchmarks demonstrate that our approach... | Xiaofeng Zhou, Heyan Huang, Lizi Liao |  |

Code review comments are often implicit, ambiguous, and colloquial, requiring models to grasp both code and human intent. This challenge calls for evaluating large language models’ ability to bridge both technical and conversational contexts. While existing work has employed the automated code refinement (ACR) task to resolve these comments, current evaluation methods fall short, relying on text matching metrics that provide limited insight into model failures and remain susceptible to training data contamination.To address these limitations, we introduce a novel evaluation benchmark, CodeReviewQA that enables us to conduct fine-grained assessment of model capabilities and mitigate data contamination risks.In CodeReviewQA, we decompose the... | Hong Yi Lin, Chunhua Liu, Haoyu Gao, Patanamon Thongtanunam, Christoph Treude |  |

In this paper, we connect elements of narrativity with fundamental aspects of framing, and present a framework which formalizes and operationalizes such aspects. We annotate and release a data set of news articles in the climate change domain, analyze the dominance of narrative frame components across political leanings, and test LLMs in their ability to predict narrative frames and their components. Finally, we apply our framework in an unsupervised way to elicit components of narrative framing in a second domain, the COVID-19 crisis, where our predictions are congruent with prior theoretical work showing the generalizability of our approach. | Yulia Otmakhova, Lea Frermann |  |

While fine-grained hallucination detection (FHD) holds promise for enhancing high-quality vision-language data construction and model alignment through enriched feedback signals, automated solutions for this task have yet to be systematically explored. Inspired by the concept of “MLLM as a Judge”, we introduce MHALO, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for evaluating MLLMs’ capability in performing token-level FHD. Our benchmark encompasses 12 distinct hallucination types spanning both multimodal perception and reasoning domains. Through extensive evaluations of 9 selected MLLMs, we reveal substantial performance limitations, with the leading model achieving an average F1IoU of only 40.59%. To address this limitation, we develop HaloDet-4B, a specialized model trained on our curated training data, which significantly... | Yishuo Cai, Renjie Gu, Jiaxu Li, Xuancheng Huang, Junzhe Chen, Xiaotao Gu, Minlie Huang |  |

By mapping recurring themes as series, parallel, or cross relationships, we identify statistical differences in communication patterns in long-form true and fake news. Our analysis of large-scale news datasets reveals that true news are more likely to exhibit more complex topological structures, with greater thematic interleaving and long-range coherence, whereas fake news favor simpler, more linear narratives. These findings suggest that topological features capture stylistic distinctions beyond traditional linguistic cues, offering new insights for discourse modeling. | Barbara Scalvini, Alireza Mashaghi |  |

Likert scale personality questionnaires have become the primary tool for assessing these characteristics in LLMs. However, such scales can be skewed by factors such as social desirability, distorting the assessment of true personality traits. To address this issue, we firstly incorporate the forced-choice test, a method known for reducing response bias in human personality assessments, into the evaluation of LLM. Specifically, we evaluated six LLMs: Llama-3.1-8B, GLM-4-9B, GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-sonnet, and Deepseek-V3. We compared the Likert scale and forced-choice test results for LLMs’ Big Five personality scores, as well as their reliability. In addition, we looked at how temperature parameter and language affected LLM personality scores. The results show that the forced-choice test better... | Xiaoyu Li, Haoran Shi, Zengyi Yu, Yukun Tu, Chanjin Zheng |  |

Medical texts written by medical practitioners contain a lot of technical terms, and patients who are non-experts are often unable to use the information effectively. Therefore, there is a strong social demand for medical text simplification that paraphrases input sentences without using medical terms. However, this task has not been sufficiently studied in non-English languages. We therefore developed parallel corpora for medical text simplification in nine languages: German, English, Spanish, French, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, and Chinese, each with 10,000 sentence pairs, by automatic sentence alignment to online medical references for professionals and consumers. We also propose a method for training text simplification models to actively paraphrase complex expressions, including medical terms. Experimental results show that the... | Koki Horiguchi, Tomoyuki Kajiwara, Takashi Ninomiya, Shoko Wakamiya, Eiji Aramaki |  |

To address this challenge, we introduce a novel backdoor defender, i.e., BadWindtunnel, in which we build a high-noise simulated training environment, similar to the wind tunnel, which allows precise control over training conditions to model the backdoor learning behavior without affecting the final model. We also use the confidence variance as a learning behavior quantification metric in the simulated training, which is based on the characteristics of backdoor-poisoned data (shorted in poisoned data): higher learnability and robustness. In addition, we propose a two-step strategy to further model poisoned data, including target label identification and poisoned data revealing. Extensive experiments demonstrate BadWindtunnel’s superiority, with a 21% higher average reduction in attack success rate than the second-best defender. | Ruyi Zhang, Songlei Jian, Yusong Tan, Heng Gao, Haifang Zhou, Kai Lu |  |

Some empirical studies have revealed that many MMT models underutilize visual data during translation. They attempt to enhance cross-modal interactions to enable better exploitation of visual data. However, they only focus on simple interactions between nouns in text and corresponding entities in image, overlooking global semantic alignment, particularly for prepositional phrases and verbs in text which are more likely to be translated incorrectly. To address this, we design a Text-Image In-depth Questioning method to deepen interactions and optimize translations. Furthermore, to mitigate errors arising from contextually irrelevant image noise, we propose a Consistency Constraint strategy to improve our approach’s robustness. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on five translation directions of Multi30K and AmbigCaps, with... | Yue Gao, Jing Zhao, Shiliang Sun, Xiaosong Qiao, Tengfei Song, Hao Yang |  |

We propose ReKG-MCTS, a novel training-free framework that synergizes Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with LLM capabilities to enable dynamic reasoning over KGs. The framework conceptualizes KG reasoning as a decision-making process, where MCTS strategically explores paths over KG while LLMs provide semantic guidance for reasoning paths. The framework consists of four phases: (1) UCB-based node selection that balances exploration-exploitation on KG, (2) path expansion with KG structural constraints, (3) LLM-guided MC rollouts for simulation, and (4) value backpropagation. Experimental results on WebQSP and CWQ demonstrate that ReKG-MCTS outperforms existing training-free methods and achieves competitive performance... | Xiaozhuang Song, Shufei Zhang, Tianshu Yu |  |

Existing approaches often struggle with the complexity of mapping questions to precise logical forms, particularly when dealing with diverse entities and relations. In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Topology Multi-task Learning (HTML), a novel framework that leverages a hierarchical multi-task learning paradigm to enhance the performance of logical form generation. Our framework consists of a main task: generating logical forms from questions, and three auxiliary tasks: entity prediction from the input question, relation prediction for the given entities, and logical form generation based on the given entities and relations. Through joint instruction-tuning, HTML allows mutual guidance and knowledge transfer among the hierarchical tasks, capturing the subtle dependencies between entities, relations, and logical forms.

Existing evaluation benchmarks predominantly focus on fine-grained constraint satisfaction and domain-specific capability assessment, yet overlook the crucial structural dependencies between dialogue turns that distinguish multi-turn from single-turn interactions. These structural dependencies not only reflect user intent but also establish an essential second dimension for the instruction following evaluation beyond constraint satisfaction. To address this gap, we propose StructFlowBench, a multi-turn instruction following benchmark with structural flow modeling. The benchmark defines an innovative structural flow framework with six fundamental inter-turn relationships. These relationships introduce novel structural constraints for model evaluation and also serve as generation parameters for creating customized dialogue flows tailored to specific... | Jinnan Li, Jinzhe Li, Yue Wang, Yi Chang, Yuan Wu |  |

While previous studies have explored the application of MLLM for detecting out-of-context (OOC) misinformation, our empirical analysis reveals two persisting challenges of this paradigm. Evaluating the representative GPT-4o model on direct reasoning and evidence augmented reasoning, results indicate that MLLM struggle to capture the deeper relationships—specifically, cases in which the image and text are not directly connected but are associated through underlying semantic links. Moreover, noise in the evidence further impairs detection accuracy.To address these challenges, we propose CMIE, a novel OOC misinformation detection framework that incorporates a Coexistence Relationship Generation (CRG) strategy and an Association Scoring (AS) mechanism. CMIE identifies the underlying coexistence relationships between images and text, and selectively utilizes relevant... | Fanxiao Li, Jiaying Wu, Canyuan He, Wei Zhou |  |

Etiquettes are region-specific and are an essential part of the culture of a region; hence, it is imperative to make LLMs sensitive to etiquettes. However, there needs to be more resources in evaluating LLMs for their understanding and bias with regard to etiquettes. In this resource paper, we introduce EtiCor++, a corpus of etiquettes worldwide. We introduce different tasks for evaluating LLMs for knowledge about etiquettes across various regions. Further, we introduce various metrics for measuring bias in LLMs. Extensive experimentation with LLMs shows inherent bias towards certain regions. | Ashutosh Dwivedi, Siddhant Singh, Ashutosh Modi |  |

Previous event studies, constrained by static single-companies analyses and simplistic assumptions, fail to capture these ripple effects. While large language models (LLMs) offer emergent reasoning capabilities, their direct application falters due to structural market unawareness and limited capacity to analyze ripple effects. We propose FinRipple, an elegant framework that empowers LLMs with the ability to analyze ripple effects through financial theory-guided large-scale reinforcement learning. We begin by relaxing the assumptions of previous methods, incorporating a time-varying knowledge graph to accurately represent market structure. By seamlessly integrating classical asset pricing theory, we align the LLM with the market, enabling it to predict ripple effects. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to provide a standardized definition of ripple effect prediction, a... | Yuanjian Xu, Jianing Hao, Kunsheng Tang, Jingnan Chen, Anxian Liu, Peng Liu, Guang Zhang |  |

Much of the recent emphasis in natural language processing (NLP) has been on modeling machine translation and many other problems using a single pre-trained Transformer decoder, while encoder-decoder architectures, which were the standard in earlier NMT models, have received relatively less attention. In this paper, we explore translation models that are universal, efficient, and easy to optimize, by marrying the world of LLMs with the world of NMT. We apply LLMs to NMT encoding and leave the NMT decoder unchanged. We also develop methods for adapting LLMs to work better with the NMT decoder. Furthermore, we construct a new dataset involving multiple tasks to assess how well the machine translation system generalizes across various tasks. Evaluations on the WMT and our datasets show that results using our method match or surpass a range of baselines in terms of translation... | Yingfeng Luo, Tong Zheng, Yongyu Mu, Bei Li, Qinghong Zhang, Yongqi Gao, Ziqiang Xu, Peinan Feng, Xiaoqian Liu, Tong Xiao, JingBo Zhu |  |

However, designing EC remains a complex, expertise-intensive process. Traditional approaches to EC generation may fail to produce comprehensive, contextually appropriate criteria. To address these challenges, we introduce EC-RAFT, a method that utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning (RAFT) to generate structured and cohesive EC directly from clinical trial titles and descriptions. EC-RAFT integrates contextual retrieval, synthesized intermediate reasoning, and fine-tuned language models to produce comprehensive EC sets. To enhance clinical alignment evaluation with referenced criteria, we also propose an LLM-guided evaluation pipeline. Our results demonstrate that our solution, which uses Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct as a base model, achieves a BERTScore of 86.23 and an EC-matched LLM-as-a-Judge score of 1.66 out of 3, outperforming zero-shot... | Nopporn Lekuthai, Nattawit Pewngam, Supitcha Sokrai, Titipat Achakulvisut |  |

In this work, we explore the redefinition task, in which we assign alternative values to well-known physical constants and units of measure, prompting LLMs to respond accordingly. Our findings show that not only does model performance degrade with scale, but its false confidence also rises. Moreover, while factors such as prompting strategies or response formatting are influential, they do not preclude LLMs from anchoring to memorized values. | Elena Stringli, Maria Lymperaiou, Giorgos Filandrianos, Athanasios Voulodimos, Giorgos Stamou |  |

Compared to explicit reasoning in test-time compute, implicit reasoning is more inference-efficient, requiring fewer generated tokens. However, why does the advanced reasoning capability fail to emerge in the implicit reasoning style? In this work, we train GPT-2 from scratch on a curated multi-step mathematical reasoning dataset and conduct analytical experiments to investigate how language models perform implicit reasoning in multi-step tasks. Our findings reveal: 1) Language models can perform step-by-step reasoning and achieve high accuracy in both in-domain and out-of-domain tests via implicit reasoning. However, this capability only emerges when trained on fixed-pattern data. 2) Conversely, implicit reasoning abilities emerging from training on unfixed-pattern data tend to overfit... | Tianhe Lin, Jian Xie, Siyu Yuan, Deqing Yang |  |

Previous studies have attempted to fine-tune open-source LLMs to replicate the evaluation explanations and judgments of powerful proprietary models, such as GPT-4. However, these methods are largely limited to text-based analyses under predefined general criteria, resulting in reduced adaptability for unseen instructions and demonstrating instability in evaluating adherence to quantitative and structural constraints. To address these limitations, we propose a novel evaluation framework, ARJudge, that adaptively formulates evaluation criteria and synthesizes both text-based and code-driven analyses to evaluate LLM responses. ARJudge consists of two components: a fine-tuned Analyzer that generates multi-faceted evaluation analyses and a tuning-free Refiner that combines and refines all analyses to make the final judgment.

To mitigate these issues, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as an effective strategy, where LLM agents engage in in-depth debates with others on tasks. However, existing MAD methods face two major issues: (a) too lengthy input contexts, which causes LLM agents to get lost in plenty of input information and experiences performance drop; and (b) the overconfidence dilemma, where self-assured LLM agents dominate the debate, leading to low debating effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose a novel MAD method called ”CortexDebate”. Inspired by the human brain’s tendency to establish a sparse and dynamically optimized network among cortical areas governed by white matter, CortexDebate constructs a sparse debating graph among LLM agents, where each LLM agent only debates with the ones that are helpful to it. To optimize the graph, we propose a... | Yiliu Sun, Zicheng Zhao, Sheng Wan, Chen Gong |  |

Within patents, the description constitutes more than 90% of the document on average. Yet, its automatic generation remains understudied. When drafting patent applications, patent attorneys typically receive invention reports (IRs), which are usually confidential, hindering research on LLM-supported patent drafting.Often, pre-publication research papers serve as IRs. We leverage this duality to build PAP2PAT, an open and realistic benchmark for patent drafting consisting of 1.8k patent-paper pairs describing the same inventions. To address the complex long-document patent generation task, we propose chunk-based outline-guided generation using the research paper as invention specification. Our extensive evaluation using PAP2PAT and a human case study show that LLMs can... | Valentin Knappich, Anna Hätty, Simon Razniewski, Annemarie Friedrich |  |

Traditional methods are labor-intensive, while large language models (LLMs) offer promising automation potential. However, prior systems lacked dynamic negotiation and real-time decision-making capabilities. This paper explores LLMs in automating DCN and proposes a novel evaluation framework with 13 metrics across 4 aspects. Our experiments reveal that LLMs tend to over-concede compared to human negotiators. To address this, we propose the Multi-Agent Debt Negotiation (MADeN) framework, incorporating planning and judging modules to improve decision rationality. We also apply post-training techniques, including DPO with rejection sampling, to optimize performance. Our studies provide valuable insights for practitioners and researchers seeking to enhance efficiency and outcomes in this domain. | Xiaofeng Wang, Zhixin Zhang, Jin Guang Zheng, Yiming Ai, Rui Wang |  |

However, the challenge of generating accurate and reliable code persists due to the highly complex and long-reasoning nature of the task. Even state-of-the-art models often fail in code generation due to small errors, which can drastically affect the overall functionality of code. Our study identifies that current models tend to produce errors concentrated at specific error-prone points, which significantly impacts the accuracy of the generated code. To address this issue, we introduce Focused-DPO, a framework that enhances code generation by directing preference optimization towards these critical error-prone areas. This approach builds on Direct Preference Optimization, emphasizing accuracy in parts prone to errors. Additionally, we develop a method called Error-Point Identification, which constructs a dataset that targets these problematic points without requiring costly human annotations.

However, these models rely on shortcut learning, using a decision rule that relies on superficial cues that are spuriously correlated with the labels (Geirhos et al., 2020). In this research, we focus on the reliance on a specific type of shortcuts, namely syntactic heuristics, in BERT when performing Natural Language Inference (NLI), a representative task in Natural Language Understanding (Jeretic et al., 2020). By making use of two probing methods, one supervised, one unsupervised, we investigate where these shortcuts emerge, how they evolve and how they impact the latent knowledge of the LM. Our findings reveal that syntactic heuristics are absent in pretrained models but emerge and evolve as the model is finetuned with datasets of increasing size.

While it has been previously shown that their efficacy in usage scenarios involving non-Western contexts falls short, existing studies are limited in scope, covering just a narrow range of cultures, focusing exclusively on a small number of cultural aspects, or evaluating a limited selection of models on a single task only. Towards globally inclusive LVLM research, we introduce GIMMICK, an extensive multimodal benchmark designed to assess a broad spectrum of cultural knowledge across 144 countries representing six global macro-regions. GIMMICK comprises six tasks built upon three new datasets that span 728 unique cultural events or facets on which we evaluated 20 LVLMs and 11 LLMs, including five proprietary and 26 open-weight models of all sizes. We systematically examine (1) regional cultural biases, (2) the influence of model size, (3) input modalities,... | Florian Schneider, Carolin Holtermann, Chris Biemann, Anne Lauscher |  |

A critical challenge in GUI automation is the precise grounding of interface elements across diverse platforms. Existing vision-only GUI agents directly ground elements from large and cluttered screenshots, requiring them to process substantial irrelevant information that compromises their accuracy. In addition, these approaches typically employ basic cross-entropy loss for learning grounding objectives, which fails to effectively capture grounding quality compared to established object detection metrics like Intersection-over-Union (IoU). To address these issues, we introduce R-VLM, a novel GUI grounding approach that leverages zoomed-in region proposals for precise element localization. We also propose an IoU-aware objective function that facilitates model convergence toward high IoU... | Joonhyung Park, Peng Tang, Sagnik Das, Srikar Appalaraju, Kunwar Yashraj Singh, R.

Different from objective tasks such as commonsense reasoning and arithmetic question-answering, the performance of LLMs on subjective tasks is still limited, where the perspective on the specific problem plays crucial roles for better interpreting the context and giving proper response. For example, in certain scenarios, LLMs may perform better when answering from an expert role perspective, potentially eliciting their relevant domain knowledge. In contrast, in some scenarios, LLMs may provide more accurate responses when answering from a third-person standpoint, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the problem and potentially mitigating inherent biases. In this paper, we propose Reasoning through Perspective Transition (RPT), a method based on in-context learning that enables LLMs to dynamically select among direct, role, and third-person... | Xiaolong Wang, Yuanchi Zhang, Ziyue Wang, Yuzhuang Xu, Fuwen Luo, Yile Wang, Peng Li, Yang Liu |  |

However, current benchmarks often rely on unrealistic simulated data, failing to reflect the differences between LLM-generated and real-world itineraries. Existing evaluation metrics, which primarily emphasize constraints, fall short of providing a comprehensive assessment of the overall quality of travel plans. To address these limitations, we introduce TripTailor, a benchmark designed specifically for personalized travel planning in real-world scenarios. This dataset features an extensive collection of over 500,000 real-world points of interest (POIs) and nearly 4,000 diverse travel itineraries, complete with detailed information, providing a more authentic evaluation framework. Experiments show that fewer than 10% of the itineraries generated by the... | Kaimin Wang, Yuanzhe Shen, Changze Lv, Xiaoqing Zheng, Xuanjing Huang |  |

However, standard evaluation methods often rely on test sets that contain named entities already present in the training data, raising concerns about overestimation of model performance.This work investigates the impact of varying degrees of entity contamination on a dataset level on the generalization ability and reported F1 scores of three state-of-the-art NER models.Experiments on five standard benchmarks show that F1 scores for contaminated entities statistically significantly inflate reported F1 scores as contamination rates increase, with F1 performance gaps ranging from 2-10% compared to entities not seen during training.To address these inflated F1 scores, we additionally propose a novel NER dataset splitting method using a minimum cut algorithm to minimize train-test entity leakage.While our splitting method ensures near-zero entity contamination, we also compare new... | Florian Babl, Moritz Hennen, Jakob Murauer, Michaela Geierhos |  |

Existing multi-domain detection models typically capture domain-shared semantic features to achieve generalized detection. However, they often fail to generalize well due to poor adaptability, which limits their ability to provide complementary features for detection, especially in data-constrained conditions. To address these challenges, we investigate the propagation-adaptive multi-domain fake news detection paradigm. We propose a novel framework, Structure-adaptive Adversarial Contrastive Learning (StruACL), to adaptively enable structure knowledge transfer between multiple domains. Specifically, we first contrast representations between content-only and propagation-rich data to preserve structural patterns in the shared representation space. Additionally, we design a propagation-guided adversarial training strategy to enhance the diversity of representations. Under the StruACL... | Lingwei Wei, Dou Hu, Wei Zhou, Philip S.

In this paper, we introduce BiasGuard, a novel bias detection tool that explicitly analyzes inputs and reasons through fairness specifications to provide accurate judgments. BiasGuard is implemented through a two-stage approach: the first stage initializes the model to explicitly reason based on fairness specifications, while the second stage leverages reinforcement learning to enhance its reasoning and judgment capabilities. Our experiments, conducted across five datasets, demonstrate that BiasGuard outperforms existing tools, improving accuracy and reducing over-fairness misjudgments. We also highlight the importance of reasoning-enhanced decision-making and provide evidence for the... | Zhiting Fan, Ruizhe Chen, Zuozhu Liu |  |

While significant progress has been made in developing taxonomies for LLM risks and safety evaluation prompts, most studies have focused on monolingual contexts, primarily in English. However, language- and region-specific risks in bilingual contexts are often overlooked, and core findings can diverge from those in monolingual settings. In this paper, we introduce Qorǵau, a novel dataset specifically designed for safety evaluation in Kazakh and Russian, reflecting the unique bilingual context in Kazakhstan, where both Kazakh (a low-resource language) and Russian (a high-resource language) are spoken. Experiments with both multilingual and language-specific LLMs reveal notable differences in safety performance, emphasizing the need for tailored, region-specific datasets to ensure the responsible and safe deployment of LLMs in countries like Kazakhstan.

However, existing datasets and models often fail to consider critical aspects of medical diagnostics, such as the integration of historical records and the analysis of disease progression over time. In this paper, we introduce MMXU (Multimodal and MultiX-ray Understanding), a novel dataset for MedVQA that focuses on identifying changes in specific regions between two patient visits. Unlike previous datasets that primarily address single-image questions, MMXU enables multi-image questions, incorporating both current and historical patient data. We demonstrate the limitations of current LVLMs in identifying disease progression on MMXU-test, even those that perform well on traditional benchmarks. To address this, we propose a MedRecord-Augmented Generation (MAG) approach, incorporating both global and regional... | Linjie Mu, Zhongzhen Huang, Shengqian Qin, Yakun Zhu, Shaoting Zhang, Xiaofan Zhang |  |

Thanks to the pretraining of Large Language Models (LLMs) on code data, recent approaches like CodeAct successfully use code as LLM agents’ action, achieving good results. However, CodeAct greedily generates the next action’s code block by relying on fragmented thoughts, resulting in inconsistency and accumulative hallucination. Moreover, CodeAct lacks action-related ground-truth (GT), making its supervision signals and termination conditions questionable in multi-turn interactions. To address these issues, we propose Tree-of-Code (ToC), a self-growing framework that generates nodes through self-supervision, incorporating prompt and model exploration in a GT-free setting. Each node employs CodeProgram, an end-to-end code generation paradigm that aligns executable code logic with global reasoning. This approach uses task-level execution success as both node validity and stop-growing flags, bypassing process... | Ziyi Ni, Yifan Li, Ning Yang, Dou Shen, Pin Lyu, Daxiang Dong |  |

AkaCE, developed for the Akan language, contains 385 emotion-labeled dialogues and 6162 utterances across audio, visual, and textual modalities, along with word-level prosodic prominence annotations. The presence of prosodic labels in this dataset also makes it the first prosodically annotated African language dataset. We demonstrate the quality and utility of AkaCE through experiments using state-of-the-art emotion recognition methods, establishing solid baselines for future research. We hope AkaCE inspires further work on inclusive, linguistically and culturally diverse NLP resources. | David Sasu, Zehui Wu, Ziwei Gong, Run Chen, Pengyuan Shi, Lin Ai, Julia Hirschberg, Natalie Schluter |  |

This challenge is unsurprising, as successful human writing, according to the Cognitive Writing Theory, is a complex cognitive process involving iterative planning, translating, reviewing, and monitoring. Motivated by these cognitive principles, we aim to equip LLMs with human-like cognitive writing capabilities through CogWriter, a novel training-free framework that transforms LLM constrained long-form text generation into a systematic cognitive writing paradigm. Our framework consists of two key modules: (1) a Planning Agent that performs hierarchical planning to decompose the task, and (2) multiple Generation Agents that execute these plans in parallel. The system maintains quality via continuous monitoring and reviewing mechanisms, which evaluate outputs against specified requirements and trigger necessary revisions.

However, existing MLLMs still face challenges in achieving precise grounding in complex multi-image scenarios. To address this, we first explore a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework that integrates single-image grounding with multi-image comprehension. While partially effective, it remains unstable and struggles to capture abstract visual information due to its non-end-to-end nature. Therefore, we introduce Migician, the first multi-image grounding model capable of performing free-form and accurate grounding across multiple images. To support this, we present the MGrounding-630k dataset, which comprises data for several multi-image grounding tasks derived from existing datasets, along with newly generated free-form grounding instruction-following data. Furthermore, we propose MIG-Bench, a... | You Li, Heyu Huang, Chi Chen, Kaiyu Huang, Chao Huang, Zonghao Guo, Zhiyuan Liu, Jinan Xu, Yuhua Li, Ruixuan Li, Maosong Sun |  |

While LLMs can accurately solve reasoning tasks through a variety of strategies, even without fine-tuning, smaller models are not expressive enough to fit the LLMs distribution on all strategies when distilled and tend to prioritize one strategy over the others. This reliance on one strategy poses a challenge for smaller models when attempting to solve reasoning tasks that may be difficult with their preferred strategy. To address this, we propose a distillation method SIKeD: \*\*S\*\*elf-guided \*\*I\*\*terative \*\*K\*\*nowledg\*\*e\*\* \*\*D\*\*istillation, where the LLM teaches the smaller model to approach a task using different strategies and the smaller model uses its self-generated on-policy outputs to choose the most suitable strategy for the given task.

Conducting jailbreak attacks on LLMs can proactively identify vulnerabilities to enhance their security measures. However, previous jailbreak attacks primarily focus on single-turn dialogue scenarios, leaving vulnerabilities in multi-turn dialogue contexts inadequately explored. This paper investigates the resilience of black-box LLMs in multi-turn jailbreak attack scenarios from a novel interrogation perspective. We propose an optimal interrogation principle to conceal the jailbreak intent and introduce a multi-turn attack chain generation strategy called CoA. By employing two effective interrogation strategies tailored for LLMs, coupled with an interrogation history record management mechanis, it achieves a significant optimization of the attack process. Our approach enables the iterative generation of attack... | Xikang Yang, Biyu Zhou, Xuehai Tang, Jizhong Han, Songlin Hu |  |

With the increasing availability of open-source instruction-tuning datasets, it is advantageous to automatically select high-quality and diverse subsets from a vast amount of data. Existing methods typically prioritize instance quality and use heuristic rules to maintain diversity. However, this absence of a comprehensive view of the entire collection often leads to suboptimal results. Moreover, heuristic rules generally focus on distance or clustering within the embedding space, which fails to accurately capture the intent of complex instructions in the semantic space. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified method for quantifying the information content of datasets. This method models the semantic space by constructing a label graph and quantifies diversity based on the distribution of information within the graph. Based on such a measurement, we further introduce an efficient sampling... | Yicheng Chen, Yining Li, Kai Hu, Zerun Ma, Haochen Ye, Kai Chen |  |

Although large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced various NLP tasks, their potential for ATE has scarcely been examined. We propose a retrieval-based prompting strategy that, in the few-shot setting, selects demonstrations according to syntactic rather than semantic similarity. This syntactic retrieval method is domain-agnostic and provides more reliable guidance for capturing term boundaries. We evaluate the approach in both in-domain and cross-domain settings, analyzing how lexical overlap between the query sentence and its retrieved examples affects performance. Experiments on three specialized ATE benchmarks show that syntactic retrieval improves F1-score. These findings highlight the importance of syntactic cues when adapting LLMs to terminology-extraction tasks. | Yongchan Chun, Minhyuk Kim, Dongjun Kim, Chanjun Park, Heuiseok Lim |  |

However, their reliance on scarce professionals highlights the need for automated detection. Current systems mainly employ black-box neural networks, which lack interpretability, which is crucial in mental health contexts. Some attempts to improve interpretability use post-hoc LLM generation but suffer from hallucination. To address these limitations, we propose RED, a Retrieval-augmented generation framework for Explainable depression Detection. RED retrieves evidence from clinical interview transcripts, providing explanations for predictions. Traditional query-based retrieval systems use a one-size-fits-all approach, which may not be optimal for depression detection, as user backgrounds and situations vary. We introduce a personalized query generation module that combines standard queries with user-specific background inferred by LLMs, tailoring retrieval to individual... | Linhai Zhang, Ziyang Gao, Deyu Zhou, Yulan He |  |

To address this gap, we introduce the Examinations for Medical PErsonnel in Chinese (EMPEC), a comprehensive healthcare knowledge benchmark featuring 157,803 exam questions across 124 subjects and 20 healthcare professions, including underrepresented roles like Optometrists and Audiologists. Each question is tagged for release time and source authenticity. We evaluated 17 LLMs, including proprietary and open-source models, finding that while models like GPT-4 achieved over 75% accuracy, they struggled with specialized fields and alternative medicine. Notably, we find that most medical-specific LLMs underperform their general-purpose counterparts in EMPEC, and incorporating EMPEC’s data in fine-tuning improves performance. In addition, we... | Zheheng Luo, Chenhan Yuan, Qianqian Xie, Sophia Ananiadou |  |

While ICRL capabilities have been demonstrated in transformers through task-specific training, the potential of large language models (LLMs) out of the box remains largely unexplored. This paper investigates whether LLMs can generalize cross-domain to perform ICRL on the Dueling Bandits (DB) problem, a stateless preference-based RL setting. We find that top-performing LLMs exhibit a notable zero-shot capacity for relative decision-making, which translates to low short-term weak regret across all DB environments by quickly including the best arm in duels. However, an optimality gap still exists between LLMs and classic DB algorithms in terms of strong regret. LLMs struggle to converge and consistently exploit even when explicitly prompted to do so, and they are sensitive to prompt variations. To bridge this gap, we propose an agentic-flow... | Fanzeng Xia, Hao Liu, Yisong Yue, Tongxin Li |  |

While effective, these methods require labor-intensive prompt engineering, raising the question of whether reasoning can be induced without reliance on explicit prompts. In this work, we unlock the reasoning capabilities of LLMs without explicit prompting.Inspired by zero-shot CoT and CoT-decoding, we propose a novel decoding strategy that systematically nudges LLMs to continue reasoning, thereby preventing immature reasoning processes. Specifically, we monitor the model’s generation and inject a designated phrase, whenever the model is likely to halt or drift away from logical reasoning process. Our experimental evaluations on diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed strategy substantially improves LLM reasoning capabilities, highlighting the potential of decoding-based interventions as an alternative to traditional prompting... | Hyunbin Jin, Je Won Yeom, Seunghyun Bae, Taesup Kim |  |

While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) typically enhances LLM capabilities, our experiments indicate that traditional text-based RAG systems struggle to significantly improve depression detection accuracy. This challenge stems partly from the rich depression-relevant information encoded in acoustic speech patterns — information that current text-only approaches fail to capture effectively. To address this limitation, we conduct a systematic analysis of temporal speech patterns, comparing healthy individuals with those experiencing depression. Based on our findings, we introduce Speech Timing-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation, SpeechT-RAG, a novel system that leverages speech timing features for both accurate depression detection and reliable confidence estimation. This integrated approach not only... | Xiangyu Zhang, Hexin Liu, Qiquan Zhang, Beena Ahmed, Julien Epps |  |

Most existing studies primarily retrieve knowledge documents based on semantic similarity to assist in answering questions but ignore the fine-grained necessary information within documents. In this paper, we propose a novel fine-grained knowledge enhancement method (FKE) for RAG, where fine-grained knowledge primarily includes sentence-level information easily overlooked in the document-based retrieval process. Concretely, we create a disentangled Chain-of-Thought prompting procedure to retrieve fine-grained knowledge from the external knowledge corpus. Then we develop a decoding enhancement strategy to constrain the document-based decoding process using fine-grained knowledge, thereby facilitating more accurate generated answers. Given an existing RAG pipeline, our method could be applied in a plug-and-play manner to... | Jingxuan Han, Zhendong Mao, Yi Liu, Yexuan Che, Zheren Fu, Quan Wang |  |

To address these challenges, we propose BayesGenie, an off-the-shelf approach that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Bayesian Optimization to facilitate precise and user-friendly image editing. Our method enables users to modify images through natural language descriptions without manual area marking, while preserving the original image’s semantic integrity.

Consequently, the task of semantic parsing remains crucial in enabling access to the information in these graphs via natural language queries. However, annotated data is scarce, requires significant effort to create, and is not easily transferable between different graphs. To address these challenges we introduce SPOT, a method to generate training data for semantic parsing over Property Graphs without human annotations. We generate tree patterns, match them to the KG to obtain a query program, and use a finite-state transducer to produce a proto-natural language realization of the query. Finally, we paraphrase the proto-NL with an LLM to generate samples for training a semantic parser. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SPOT on two property graph benchmarks utilizing the Cypher query language. In addition, we show that our... | Francesco Cazzaro, Justin Kleindienst, Sofia Márquez Gomez, Ariadna Quattoni |  |

To understand and uncover the mechanisms adopted for formal reasoning in LMs, this paper presents a mechanistic interpretation of syllogistic inference. Specifically, we present a methodology for circuit discovery aimed at interpreting content-independent and formal reasoning mechanisms. Through two distinct intervention methods, we uncover a sufficient and necessary circuit involving middle-term suppression that elucidates how LMs transfer information to derive valid conclusions from premises. Furthermore, we investigate how belief biases manifest in syllogistic inference, finding evidence of partial contamination from additional attention heads responsible for encoding commonsense and contextualized knowledge. Finally, we explore the generalization of the discovered mechanisms across... | Geonhee Kim, Marco Valentino, André Freitas |  |

The primary challenge lies in effectively pinpointing crucial information snippets related to question-answer (QA) pairs, typically relying on keywords. However, existing works fail to fully utilize the guiding potential of keywords and neglect to differentiate the distinct roles of question-specific and document-specific keywords. To address this, we define dual-perspective keywords—question and document keywords—and propose a Dual-Perspective Keyword-Guided (DPKG) framework, which seamlessly integrates keywords into the multi-hop question generation process. We argue that question keywords capture the questioner’s intent, whereas document keywords reflect the content related to the QA pair. Functionally, question and document keywords work together to pinpoint essential information snippets in the document, with question... | Maodong Li, Longyin Zhang, Fang Kong |  |

Their effectiveness can mainly be attributed to their ability to adapt to an array of downstream tasks. However, generally, full fine-tuning is a computationally expensive job. To mitigate this, many techniques have been developed that prime efficiency, a prominent one being Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). However, LoRA and its variants employ re-parametrized additive updates. In this paper, we propose Low-Rank Multiplicative Adaptation (LoRMA), which shifts the paradigm of additive updates to a richer space of matrix multiplicative transformations. We tackle challenges such as computational complexity and rank bottleneck of matrix multiplication by effectively re-ordering operations and introducing rank inflation strategies. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of various evaluation metrics. | Harsh Bihany, Shubham Patel, Ashutosh Modi |  |

Existing studies highlight that dependency-related issues cause over 40% of observed runtime errors on the generated repository. To address this, we introduce DI-BENCH, a large-scale benchmark and evaluation framework specifically designed to assess LLMs’ capability on dependency inference. The benchmark features 581 repositories with testing environments across Python, C#, Rust, and JavaScript. Extensive experiments with textual and execution-based metrics reveal that the current best-performing model achieves only a 48% execution pass rate on Python, indicating significant room for improvement. DI-BENCH establishes a new viewpoint for evaluating LLM performance on repositories, paving the way for more robust end-to-end software synthesis. | Linghao Zhang, Junhao Wang, Shilin He, Chaoyun Zhang, Yu Kang, Bowen Li, Jiaheng Wen, Chengxing Xie, Maoquan Wang, Yufan Huang, Elsie Nallipogu, Qingwei Lin, Yingnong Dang, Saravan Rajmohan, Dongmei Zhang, Qi Zhang |  |

Existing solutions, such as prompt engineering and fine-tuning, face limitations: the former provides only marginal improvements, while the latter struggles to enhance honesty when annotated data is scarce.To overcome the above limitations, we propose , a novel framework that enhances honesty through weak-to-strong generalization. Specifically, we train the strong LLMs under weak model supervision to improve their honesty. For the weak model, we employ a learning-to-rank strategy to train a “honest head”, which learns to select the most honest response among model’s outputs generated through beam search. For the strong LLM, we leverage the self-labeled dataset to update its parameters. Our proposal requires only minimal training data to train the weak honest model, yet achieve decent performance... | Yunfan Xie, Lixin Zou, Dan Luo, Min Tang, Chenliang Li |  |

False-premise questions (FPQs) serve as an important evaluation method by exposing cases where flawed assumptions lead to incorrect responses. While existing benchmarks focus on single-hop FPQs, real-world reasoning often requires multi-hop inference, where models must verify consistency across multiple reasoning steps rather than relying on surface-level cues. To address this gap, we introduce MultiHoax, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs’ ability to handle false premises in complex, multi-step reasoning tasks. Our dataset spans seven countries and ten diverse knowledge categories, using Wikipedia as the primary knowledge source to enable cross-regional factual reasoning. Experiments reveal that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to detect false premises across different countries, knowledge categories, and... | Mohammadamin Shafiei, Hamidreza Saffari, Nafise Sadat Moosavi |  |

While recent advances in Artificial Intelligence agents have reignited interest in IF games as a domain for studying decision-making, existing approaches prioritize task-specific performance metrics over human-like comprehension of narrative context and gameplay logic. This work presents a cognitively inspired framework that guides Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn and play IF games systematically. Our proposed \*\*L\*\*earning to \*\*P\*\*lay \*\*L\*\*ike \*\*H\*\*umans (LPLH) framework integrates three key components: (1) structured map building to capture spatial and narrative relationships, (2) action learning to identify context-appropriate commands, and (3) feedback-driven experience analysis to refine decision-making over time. By aligning LLMs-based agents’ behavior with narrative intent and commonsense constraints, LPLH moves beyond purely exploratory strategies to deliver... | Jinming Zhang, Yunfei Long |  |

The intensity and directionality of hate are closely tied to the target and argument it is associated with. However, research on hate speech detection in Chinese has lagged behind, and existing datasets lack span-level fine-grained annotations. Furthermore, the lack of research on Chinese hateful slang poses a significant challenge. In this paper, we provide two valuable fine-grained Chinese hate speech detection research resources. First, we construct a Span-level Target-Aware Toxicity Extraction dataset (STATE ToxiCN), which is the first span-level Chinese hate speech dataset. Secondly, we evaluate the span-level hate speech detection performance of existing models using STATE ToxiCN. Finally, we conduct the first study on Chinese hateful slang and evaluate the ability of LLMs to understand hate semantics. Our work contributes valuable resources and insights to advance span-level hate speech detection in... | Zewen Bai, Liang Yang, Shengdi Yin, Junyu Lu, Jingjie Zeng, Haohao Zhu, Yuanyuan Sun, Hongfei Lin |  |

Current evaluations on conceptual knowledge editing primarily focus on whether the definitions of concepts are successfully edited, neglecting the impact on the model’s related beliefs. To address this gap, we introduce a benchmark called RelEdit, which includes criteria and questions to assess both concept-level and instance-level relational reasoning abilities of edited models. Our findings reveal that existing knowledge editing methods struggle to reason about related conceptual knowledge effectively. Additionally, we introduce a simple memory-based in-context editing baseline, MICE, which prompts the language model to generate answers that align with the stored edited concepts in external memory. In addition, we find that MICE obtains the best scores on our benchmark, suggesting a promising research direction for model editing. | Yifan Niu, Miao Peng, Nuo Chen, Yatao Bian, Tingyang Xu, Jia Li |  |

However, the ability to follow speech instructions has not been fully realized due to the lack of datasets and heavily biased training tasks. Leveraging the rich ASR datasets, previous approaches have used Large Language Models (\*\*LLMs\*\*) to continue the linguistic information of speech to construct speech instruction datasets. Yet, due to the gap between LLM-generated results and real human responses, the continuation methods further amplify these shortcomings. Given the high costs of collecting and annotating speech instruction datasets by humans, using speech synthesis to construct large-scale speech instruction datasets has become a balanced and robust alternative. Although modern Text-To-Speech (\*\*TTS\*\*) models have achieved near-human-level synthesis quality, it... | Yonghua Hei, Yibo Yan, Shuliang Liu, Huiyu Zhou, Linfeng Zhang, Xuming Hu |  |

However, previous approaches often treat nonsensical responses or template-based refusals (e.g., “Sorry, I cannot answer.”) as the unlearning target, which can give the impression of deliberate information suppression, making the process even more vulnerable to attacks and jailbreaks. Moreover, most methods rely on auxiliary models or retaining datasets, which adds complexity to the unlearning process. To address these challenges, we propose MEOW, a streamlined and stealthy unlearning method that eliminates the need for auxiliary models or retaining data while avoiding leakage through its innovative use of inverted facts. These inverted facts are generated by an offline LLM and serve as fine-tuning labels. Meanwhile, we introduce MEMO, a novel metric that measures the model’s memorization, to select optimal fine-tuning targets. The use of inverted facts not only... | Tianle Gu, Kexin Huang, Ruilin Luo, Yuanqi Yao, Xiuying Chen, Yujiu Yang, Yan Teng, Yingchun Wang |  |

While alignment techniques help LLMs align with human intentions and values, improving context-faithfulness through alignment remains underexplored. To address this, we propose Context-DPO, the first alignment method specifically designed to enhance LLMs’ context-faithfulness. We introduce ConFiQA, a benchmark that simulates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios with knowledge conflicts to evaluate context-faithfulness. By leveraging faithful and stubborn responses to questions with provided context from ConFiQA, our Context-DPO aligns LLMs through direct preference optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Context-DPO significantly improves context-faithfulness, achieving 35% to 280% improvements on popular open-source models. Further analysis demonstrates that Context-DPO preserves LLMs’ generative capabilities while providing interpretable... | Baolong Bi, Shaohan Huang, Yiwei Wang, Tianchi Yang, Zihan Zhang, Haizhen Huang, Lingrui Mei, Junfeng Fang, Zehao Li, Furu Wei, Weiwei Deng, Feng Sun, Qi Zhang, Shenghua Liu |  |

Simultaneously, the rapid advancement of reasoning techniques has continuously pushed the performance boundaries of LLMs. This intersection of practical role-playing demands and evolving reasoning capabilities raises an important research question: Can reasoning techniques enhance the role-playing capabilities of LLMs?” To address this, we conduct a comprehensive study using 6 role-playing benchmarks, 24 LLMs, and 3 distinct role-playing strategies, comparing the effectiveness of direct zero-shot role-playing, role-playing with Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and role-playing using reasoning-optimized LLMs. Our findings reveal that CoT may reduce role-playing performance, reasoning-optimized LLMs are unsuitable for role-playing, reasoning ability disrupts the role-playing scaling law, and large models... | Xiachong Feng, Longxu Dou, Lingpeng Kong |  |

We propose a distant supervision method for training, which comprises a reasoning process extension strategy, aiding in training LLMs to understand reasoning patterns more effectively as well as a cross-way validation strategy, ensuring the quality of the automatically generated data. To evaluate the performance of TableLLM, we have crafted benchmarks tailored to address both document and spreadsheet formats as well as constructed a well-organized evaluation pipeline capable of handling both scenarios. Thorough evaluations underscore the advantages of TableLLM when compared to various existing general-purpose and tabular data-focused LLMs. We have publicly released the model checkpoint, source code, benchmarks, and a web... | Xiaokang Zhang, Sijia Luo, Bohan Zhang, Zeyao Ma, Jing Zhang, Yang Li, Guanlin Li, Zijun Yao, Kangli Xu, Jinchang Zhou, Daniel ZhangLi, Jifan Yu, Shu Zhao, Juanzi Li, Jie Tang |  |

This survey examines the architectures, applications, and challenges of LLM-based agents in medicine. We analyze key components including system profiles, clinical planning, medical reasoning frameworks, and external capacity enhancement. The survey covers major applications in clinical decision support, medical documentation, training simulations, and healthcare service optimization, along with evaluation frameworks and metrics. While these agents show promise in enhancing healthcare delivery, challenges remain in hallucination management, multimodal integration, implementation, and ethics. We conclude by highlighting future directions in medical reasoning, physical system integration, and training simulations, providing researchers and practitioners with a structured overview of the field’s current state and prospects. | Wenxuan Wang, Zizhan Ma, Zheng Wang, Chenghan Wu, Jiaming Ji, Wenting Chen, Xiang Li, Yixuan Yuan |  |

Current KE evaluations typically assess editing success by considering only the edited knowledge without any preceding contexts. In real-world applications, however, preceding contexts often trigger the retrieval of the original knowledge and undermine the intended edit. To address this issue, we have developed CHED—a benchmark designed to evaluate the context robustness of KE methods. Evaluations on CHED show that they often fail when preceding contexts are present. To mitigate this shortcoming, we introduce CoRE, a KE method designed to strengthen context robustness by minimizing context-sensitive variance in hidden states of the model for edited knowledge. This method not only improves the editing success rate in situations where a preceding context is present but also preserves the overall capabilities of the model. We also provide an in-depth analysis of the differing impacts of... | Haewon Park, Gyubin Choi, Minjun Kim, Yohan Jo |  |

A representative scenario is in software development, where agents can collaborate in a team like humans, following predefined phases to complete sub-tasks sequentially. However, for an agent team, each phase yields only one possible outcome. This results in the completion of only one development chain, thereby losing the opportunity to explore multiple potential decision paths within the solution space. Consequently leading to suboptimal results or extensive trial and error. To address this, we introduce Cross-Team Orchestration (Croto), a scalable multi-team framework that enables orchestrated teams to jointly propose various task-oriented solutions and interact with their insights in a self-independence while cross-team collaboration environment for superior solutions generation. Experiments reveal a notable increase in software quality compared to... | Zhuoyun Du, Chen Qian, Wei Liu, Zihao Xie, Yifei Wang, Rennai Qiu, Yufan Dang, Weize Chen, Cheng Yang, Ye Tian, Xuantang Xiong, Lei Han |  |

However, models are still prone to mistakes like Additions and Omissions. Furthermore, few languages are taken into account since both train and test data are not readily available. In this paper, we hope to facilitate the development and improvement of multilingual KG-to-Text models by providing a multilingual evaluation framework that is reference-less (no need for test data) and permits estimating how much a KG-to-Text Model under- (omission) or over- (addition) generates. We focus on two high (English, Russian) and five low (Breton, Irish, Maltese, Welsh, Xhosa) resource languages and show that our metric has fair to moderate correlation with reference-based metrics, positioning it as a consistent alternative when no references are available. We also show that our metric outperforms prior reference-less metrics in correlation with existing human judgments.

However, their effectiveness for low-resource, morphologically rich languages such as Amharic remains underexplored due to data scarcity and suboptimal tokenization. We address this gap by introducing Amharic-specific dense retrieval models based on pre-trained Amharic BERT and RoBERTa backbones. Our proposed RoBERTa-Base-Amharic-Embed model (110M parameters) achieves a 17.6% relative improvement in MRR@10 and a 9.86% gain in Recall@10 over the strongest multilingual baseline, Arctic Embed 2.0 (568M parameters). More compact variants, such as RoBERTa-Medium-Amharic-Embed (42M), remain competitive while being over 13× smaller. Additionally, we train a ColBERT-based late interaction retrieval model that achieves the highest MRR@10 score (0.843) among all evaluated models. We benchmark our proposed models against both sparse and dense retrieval baselines to... | Kidist Amde Mekonnen, Yosef Worku Alemneh, Maarten de Rijke |  |

Automatically transforming NL into STL is an attractive approach to overcome the limitations of manual transformation, which is time-consuming and error-prone. However, due to the lack of datasets, automatic transformation currently faces significant challenges and has not been fully explored. In this paper, we propose a NL-STL dataset named STL-Diversity-Enhanced (STL-DivEn), comprising 16,000 samples enriched with diverse patterns. To develop the dataset, we first manually create a small-scale seed set of NL-STL pairs. Next, representative examples are identified through clustering and used to guide large language models (LLMs) in generating additional NL-STL pairs. Finally, diversity and accuracy are ensured through rigorous rule-based filters and human validation. Furthermore, we introduce the... | Yue Fang, Zhi Jin, Jie An, Hongshen Chen, Xiaohong Chen, Naijun Zhan |  |

Existing studies have gradually adopted literal annotations to model basic meanings, rejecting the aggregated meanings of target words. However, these methods ignore the problem of interference caused by literal annotations, and do not make full use of semantic expression relations of MDT, making the models difficult to detect and generalize. To address these challenges, we propose a dependency-based Dual-Attention and Global Semantic Improvement (DAGS) framework. DAGS first extracts literal annotations of target words as basic meaning from several mainstream corpora. Then, we apply dependency tree and dual-attention while filtering on input sentences and basic meanings. Finally, we improve the MDT to further consider the global semantic relationship on contexts.

Traditional tamper detection methods, designed for deterministic classification models, fail to address the output randomness and massive parameter spaces characteristic of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce Efficient Sensitive Fingerprinting (ESF), the first fingerprinting method tailored for black-box tamper detection of LLMs. ESF generates fingerprint samples by optimizing output sensitivity at selected detection token positions and leverages Randomness-Set Consistency Checking (RSCC) to accommodate inherent output randomness. Furthermore, a novel Max Coverage Strategy (MCS) is proposed to select an optimal set of fingerprint samples that maximizes joint sensitivity to tampering. Grounded in a rigorous theoretical framework, ESF is both computationally... | Xiaofan Bai, Pingyi Hu, Xiaojing Ma, Linchen Yu, Dongmei Zhang, Qi Zhang, Bin Benjamin Zhu |  |

Based on the mechanisms, we significantly improve both model performance and data efficiency in the BoN... | Zhenru Zhang, Chujie Zheng, Yangzhen Wu, Beichen Zhang, Runji Lin, Bowen Yu, Dayiheng Liu, Jingren Zhou, Junyang Lin |  |

Compared to closed-ended QA, it demands longer answer statements, more nuanced reasoning processes, and diverse expressions, making refined and interpretable automatic evaluation both crucial and challenging. Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore struggle to capture semantic similarities due to different patterns between model responses and reference answers. Current LLM-based evaluation approaches, such as pairwise or listwise comparisons of candidate answers, lack intuitive interpretability. While pointwise scoring of each response provides some descriptions, it fails to adapt across different question contents. Most notably, existing methods overlook the distinction between factoid and non-factoid questions. To address these challenges, we propose MinosEval, a novel evaluation method that first distinguishes open-ended questions and then ranks candidate answers... | Yongqi Fan, Yating Wang, Guandong Wang, Jie Zhai, Jingping Liu, Qi Ye, Tong Ruan |  |

This paper explores automated dataset augmentation using LLMs as human proxies to condition LLMs for clinician control without increasing cognitive workload. On the BioNLP ACL’24 Discharge Me! Shared Task, we achieve new state-of-the-art results with simpler methods than prior submissions through more efficient training, yielding a 9% relative improvement without augmented training and up to 34% with dataset augmentation. Preliminary human evaluation further supports the effectiveness of our approach, highlighting the potential of augmenting clinical text generation for control to enhance relevance, accuracy, and factual consistency. | Osman Alperen Koras, Rabi Bahnan, Jens Kleesiek, Amin Dada |  |

However, this has had important consequences for programming skills, ethics, and assessment integrity, thus making the detection of LLM-generated code essential for maintaining accountability and standards. While, there has been some previous research on this problem, it generally lacks domain coverage and robustness, and only covers a small number of programming languages. Here, we aim to bridge this gap. In particular, we propose a framework capable of distinguishing between human-written and LLM-generated program code across multiple programming languages, code generators, and domains. We use a large-scale dataset from renowned platforms and LLM-based code generators, alongside applying rigorous data quality checks, feature engineering, and comparative analysis of traditional machine learning models, pre-trained language models (PLMs), and LLMs for code detection.

However, our investigations reveal that the Mamba architecture still has room for further optimization—not only in linear projections but also in state caches, which contribute significantly to memory consumption, particularly after quantizing the former into low bits. After a theoretical analysis of the causes of outliers in states, we propose Decoupled Scale Quantization (DSQ), which mitigates outliers in both the state and channel dimensions by applying separate quantization scales. To preserve the selective ability of quantized Mamba, we introduce Efficient Selectivity Reconstruction (ESR), a novel quantization simulation scheme in block-wise reconstruction that enables fast parallel scan algorithms with the non-linear quantization function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Q-Mamba across various... | Tianqi Chen, Yuanteng Chen, Peisong Wang, Weixiang Xu, Zeyu Zhu, Jian Cheng |  |

Despite recent advancements, two major challenges remain. First, existing datasets typically feature fixed layouts and a limited set of entity categories, while current methods are based on a full-shot setting that is difficult to apply in real-world scenarios, where new entity categories frequently emerge. Secondly, current methods often treat key entities simply as parts of the OCR-parsed context, neglecting the positive impact of the relationships between key-value entities. To address the first challenge, we introduce a new large-scale, human-annotated dataset, Complex Layout document for Key Information Extraction (CLEX). Comprising 5,860 images with 1,162 entity categories, CLEX is larger and more complex than existing datasets. It also primarily focuses on the zero-shot and few-shot KIE tasks, which are more aligned with real-world... | Kaiwen Wei, Jie Yao, Jiang Zhong, Yangyang Kang, Jingyuan Zhang, Changlong Sun, Xin Zhang, Fengmao Lv, Li Jin |  |

Yet, the reliance on manual labels limits scalability. Recent studies leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate sentence pairs, reducing annotation dependency. However, they overlook ranking information crucial for fine-grained semantic distinctions. To tackle this challenge, we propose a method for controlling the generation direction of LLMs in the latent space. Unlike unconstrained generation, the controlled approach ensures meaningful semantic divergence. Then, we refine exist sentence embedding model by integrating ranking information and semantic information. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves new SOTA performance with a modest cost in ranking sentence synthesis. | Liyang He, Chenglong Liu, Rui Li, Zhenya Huang, Shulan Ruan, Jun Zhou, Enhong Chen |  |

These approaches decompose a fine-tuned LLM into a base model and corresponding delta weights, which are compressed using low-rank or low-bit representations to reduce storage costs. However, their effectiveness is highly sensitive to the magnitude of the model deltas—a factor directly influenced by the scale of the training data. We propose the Residual Quantization Tree (RQT), a hierarchical quantization framework that automatically shares low-bit integer weights across similar fine-tuned models. The RQT construction employs a two-phase greedy algorithm: a bottom-up aggregation of models based on weight matrix similarity, and top-down residual quantization, in which each node optimizes the quantization parameters and then delegates residual errors to child nodes. We evaluate RQT on fine-tuned models across mathematics, coding, chatbot,... | Tianqi Chen, Peisong Wang, Weixiang Xu, Zeyu Zhu, Jian Cheng |  |

LCFO consists of long input documents (5k words average length), each of which comes with three summaries of different lengths (20%, 10%, and 5% of the input text), as well as approximately 15 questions and answers (QA) related to the input content. Notably, LCFO also provides alignments between specific QA pairs and corresponding summaries in 7 domains. The primary motivation behind providing summaries of different lengths is to establish a controllable framework for generating long texts from shorter inputs, i.e. summary expansion. To establish an evaluation metric framework for summarization and summary expansion, we provide human evaluation scores for human-generated outputs, as well as results from various state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs).

Span-based SRL, a prominent paradigm, is often tackled using BIO-based or graph-based methods. However, these approaches often fail to capture the inherent relationship between syntax and semantics. While syntax-aware models have been proposed to address this limitation, they heavily rely on pre-existing syntactic resources, limiting their general applicability. In this work, we propose a lexicalized tree representation for span-based SRL, which integrates constituency and dependency parsing to explicitly model predicate-argument structures. By structurally representing predicates as roots and arguments as subtrees directly linked to the predicate, our approach bridges the gap between syntactic and semantic representations. Experiments on standard English benchmarks (CoNLL05 and CoNLL12) demonstrate that our model achieves competitive performance, with particular... | Yang Hou, Zhenghua Li |  |

However, these models are usually trained only with positive samples—entities that match the input mention’s identifier—and do not explicitly learn from hard negative samples, which are entities that look similar but have different meanings. To address this limitation, we introduce ANGEL (Learning from Negative Samples in Biomedical Generative Entity Linking), the first framework that trains generative BioEL models using negative samples. Specifically, a generative model is initially trained to generate positive entity names from the knowledge base for given input entities. Subsequently, both correct and incorrect outputs are gathered from the model’s top-k predictions. Finally, the model is updated to prioritize the correct predictions through preference optimization. Our models fine-tuned with ANGEL outperform the previous best baseline models... | Chanhwi Kim, Hyunjae Kim, Sihyeon Park, Jiwoo Lee, Mujeen Sung, Jaewoo Kang |  |

Typically, best reported performance is achieved with a zero- or a few-shot prompt. We observe that asking the model to take other routes of solving the same task, such as through code generation, hurts performance. Furthermore, training sets are typically no longer useful for improving model performance through few-shot learning, due to their use in training. Indeed, we observe that auto-prompting techniques such as DSPy (CITATION), when applied on training sets, do not produce few-shot examples that further improve validation performance. Further, when used in conjunction with program-of-thought, performance becomes even worse.Our work overcomes these limitations by introducing a novel self-play programming interface which leverages the ability of VLMs to first generate code to decompose a complex visual reasoning task in sub-tasks, then use itself, or other models, as a tool to... | Tautvydas Misiunas, Hassan Mansoor, Jasper Uijlings, Oriana Riva, Victor Carbune |  |

In this paper, we study the CoT performance from the perspective of effectiveness and faithfulness. For the former, we identify key factors that influence CoT effectiveness on performance improvement, including problem difficulty, information gain, and information flow. For the latter, we interpret the unfaithful CoT issue by conducting a joint analysis of the information interaction among the question, CoT, and answer. The result demonstrates that, when the LLM predicts answers, it can recall correct information missing in the CoT from the question, leading to the problem. Finally, we propose a novel algorithm to mitigate this issue, in which we recall extra information from the question to enhance the CoT generation and evaluate CoTs based on their information... | Jiachun Li, Pengfei Cao, Yubo Chen, Jiexin Xu, Huaijun Li, Xiaojian Jiang, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao |  |

Crucially, we contribute a framework to address the challenge of obtaining adequate images that represent non-compositional compounds (such as “couch potato”), making it relevant for any image-based approach targeting figurative language. Our method uses prompting strategies and diffusion models to generate images. Comparing and combining our approach with a state-of-the-art text-based approach reveals complementary contributions regarding features as well as degrees of abstractness in compounds. | Sinan Kurtyigit, Diego Frassinelli, Carina Silberer, Sabine Schulte im Walde |  |

Recent research has shown that explanations provide valuable information for understanding human label variation (HLV) and large language models (LLMs) can approximate HJD from a few human-provided label-explanation pairs. However, collecting explanations for every label is still time-consuming. This paper examines whether LLMs can be used to replace humans in generating explanations for approximating HJD. Specifically, we use LLMs as annotators to generate model explanations for a few given human labels. We test ways to obtain and combine these label-explanations with the goal to approximate human judgment distributions. We further compare the resulting human with model-generated explanations, and test automatic and human explanation selection. Our experiments show that LLM explanations are promising for NLI: to estimate HJDs, generated explanations yield comparable results to... | Beiduo Chen, Siyao Peng, Anna Korhonen, Barbara Plank |  |

Although large language models (LLMs) offer promising automation capabilities, their standalone use often results in inconsistent outputs, limiting their reliability. In this work, we propose a framework that combines ensemble methods with code refinement methodology to address these challenges. Our approach integrates multiple smaller LLMs, fine-tuned via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and employs a moderator-based mechanism to simulate human consensus. To address the limitations of metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore, we introduce a composite evaluation metric that combines code conciseness and contextual similarity. The validity of this metric is confirmed through correlation analysis with human expert ratings. Results demonstrate that smaller ensemble models with refined outputs consistently outperform other ensembles, individual models, and even large-scale... | Angelina Parfenova, Jürgen Pfeffer |  |

Red teaming is a promising approach to enhance model safety by creating adversarial prompts to test and improve model robustness. However, existing red-teaming methods often require expensive fine-tuning, especially for large LLMs. We propose the Dynamic Evil Score-Guided Decoding framework (DESGD), an efficient red-teaming method that does not increase computational cost with the target model size. DESGD introduces the concept of an ‘evil score’ to dynamically evaluate the potential of tokens to contribute to harmful outputs during decoding. This framework constructs a small unsafe model using an adversarial dataset and adjusts the logits vector of the target model based on the evil score. Experiments show that DESGD achieves an ASR of 92.83% on the Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct model, compared to 83.48% with adversarial... | Cong Gao, Bo Zhang, Linkang Yang, Minghao Hu, Zhunchen Luo, Xiaoying Bai, Guotong Geng, Jun Zhang, Yunhua Xue |  |

The current discourse parsing datasets based on conversations consists of written English dialogues restricted to a single domain. In this resource paper, we introduce CoMuMDR: Code-mixed Multi-modal Multi-domain corpus for Discourse paRsing in conversations. The corpus (code-mixed in Hindi and English) has both audio and transcribed text and is annotated with nine discourse relations. We experiment with various SoTA baseline models; the poor performance of SoTA models highlights the challenges of multi-domain code-mixed corpus, pointing towards the need for developing better models for such realistic settings. | Divyaksh Shukla, Ritesh Baviskar, Dwijesh Gohil, Aniket Tiwari, Atul Shree, Ashutosh Modi |  |

Datasets describing noun compound semantics tend to describe only the predominant sense of a compound, which is limiting, especially in diachronic settings where senses may shift over time. We create a novel dataset of relatedness judgements of noun compounds in English and German, the first to capture diachronic meaning changes for multi-word expressions without prematurely condensing individual senses into an aggregate value. Furthermore, we introduce a novel, sense-targeting approach for noun compounds that evaluates two contrasting vector representations in their ability to cluster example sentence pairs. Our clustering approach targets both noun compounds and their constituent parts, to model the interdependence of these terms over time. We calculate time-delineated distributions of these clusters and compare them against measures of semantic change aggregated from the... | Chris W.

However, they struggle significantly with low-resource programming languages (LRPLs) such as D, exacerbating the digital divide. This gap limits developers using LRPLs from equally benefiting and hinders innovation within underrepresented programming communities. To make matters worse, manually generating data for LRPLs is highly labor intensive and requires expensive expert effort. In this work, we begin by analyzing the NL-PL Gap, where LLMs’ direct-generated LRPL data often suffers from subpar quality due to the misalignment between natural language (NL) instructions and programming language (PL) outputs. To address this issue, we introduce Bridge-Assist Generation, a method to generate LRPL data utilizing LLM’s general knowledge, HRPL proficiency, and in-context learning capabilities.

As the capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) continue to evolve, evaluation of frontier multimodal intelligence becomes necessary yet challenging. In this work, we introduce ProBench, a benchmark of open-ended user queries encapsulating professional expertise and advanced reasoning. ProBench consists of 4,000 high-quality samples independently collected from professionals based on their productivity demands. It spans across 10 fields and 56 sub-fields, including science, arts, humanities, coding, mathematics, and creative writing. Experimentally, we evaluate and compare 24 latest models using MLLM-as-a-Judge. Our results reveal that although the best open-source models rival the proprietary ones, they all face significant challenges in visual perception, textual understanding, domain knowledge, and advanced reasoning. Our benchmark is publicly accessible at TBC. | Yan Yang, Dongxu Li, Haoning Wu, Bei Chen, Liu Liu, Liyuan Pan, Junnan Li |  |

Yet, the validity of methods for measuring different kinds of LSC remains unestablished due to the absence of historical benchmark datasets. To address this gap, we propose LSC-Eval, a novel three-stage general-purpose evaluation framework to: (1) develop a scalable methodology for generating synthetic datasets that simulate theory-driven LSC using In-Context Learning and a lexical database; (2) use these datasets to evaluate the sensitivity of computational methods to synthetic change; and (3) assess their suitability for detecting change in specific dimensions and domains. We apply LSC-Eval to simulate changes along the Sentiment, Intensity, and Breadth (SIB) dimensions, as defined in the SIBling framework, using examples from psychology. We then evaluate the ability of selected methods to detect these controlled interventions. Our findings validate the use of synthetic benchmarks, demonstrate that... | Naomi Baes, Raphaël Merx, Nick Haslam, Ekaterina Vylomova, Haim Dubossarsky |  |

Despite their remarkable capability to generate diverse and vivid images, considerable efforts are being made to prevent the generation of harmful content, such as abusive, violent, or pornographic material. To assess the safety of existing models, we introduce a novel jailbreaking method called Chain-of-Jailbreak (CoJ) attack, which compromises image generation models through a step-by-step editing process. Specifically, for malicious queries that cannot bypass the safeguards with a single prompt, we intentionally decompose the query into multiple sub-queries. The image generation models are then prompted to generate and iteratively edit images based on these sub-queries. To evaluate the effectiveness of our CoJ attack method, we constructed a comprehensive dataset, CoJ-Bench, including nine safety... | Wenxuan Wang, Kuiyi Gao, Youliang Yuan, Jentse Huang, Qiuzhi Liu, Shuai Wang, Wenxiang Jiao, Zhaopeng Tu |  |

Tokenizers split texts into smaller units and might behave differently for less common linguistic forms. This might affect downstream LLM performance differently on two types of tasks: Tasks where the model should be robust to language variation (e.g., for semantic tasks like NLI, labels do not depend on whether a text uses British or American spelling) and tasks where the model should be sensitive to language variation (e.g., for form-based tasks like authorship verification, labels depend on whether a text uses British or American spelling). We pre-train BERT base models with the popular Byte-Pair Encoding algorithm to investigate how key tokenization design choices impact the performance of downstream models: the corpus used to train the tokenizer, the pre-tokenizer and the vocabulary size. We find that the best tokenizer varies on the two task types and that the... | Anna Wegmann, Dong Nguyen, David Jurgens |  |

In this work, we introduce WirelessMathBench, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on mathematical modeling challenges to wireless communications engineering. Our benchmark consists of 587 meticulously curated questions sourced from 40 state-of-the-art research papers, encompassing a diverse spectrum of tasks ranging from basic multiple-choice questions to complex equation completion tasks, including both partial and full completions, all of which rigorously adhere to physical and dimensional constraints. Through extensive experimentation with leading LLMs, we observe that while many models excel in basic recall tasks, their performance degrades significantly when reconstructing partially or fully obscured equations, exposing fundamental... | Xin Li, Mengbing Liu, Li Wei, Jiancheng An, Mérouane Abdelkader Debbah, Chau Yuen |  |

However, we find that DPO-based MOA approaches suffer from widespread preference conflicts in the data, where different objectives favor different responses. This results in conflicting optimization directions, hindering the optimization on the Pareto Front. To address this, we propose to construct Pareto-optimal responses to resolve preference conflicts. To efficiently obtain and utilize such responses, we propose a self-improving DPO framework that enables LLMs to self-generate and select Pareto-optimal responses for self-supervised preference alignment. Extensive experiments on two datasets demonstrate the superior Pareto Front achieved by our framework compared to various baselines | Moxin Li, Yuantao Zhang, Wenjie Wang, Wentao Shi, Zhuo Liu, Fuli Feng, TatSeng Chua |  |

In this paper, we closely examine the reasons behind this phenomenon, focusing on the pre-training corpus. We find that the existence of code-switching, alternating between different languages within a context, is key to multilingual capabilities. We conduct an analysis to investigate code-switching in the pre-training corpus, examining its presence and categorizing it into four types within two quadrants. We then assess its impact on multilingual performance. These types of code-switching data are unbalanced in proportions and demonstrate different effects on facilitating language transfer. To better explore the power of code-switching for language alignment during pre-training, we investigate the strategy of synthetic code-switching. We continuously scale up the synthetic code-switching data and observe remarkable improvements in both benchmarks... | Zhijun Wang, Jiahuan Li, Hao Zhou, Rongxiang Weng, Jingang Wang, Xin Huang, Xue Han, Junlan Feng, Chao Deng, Shujian Huang |  |

As models grow and computation becomes cheaper, ensuring tasks and test cases are unseen during training phases will become nearly impossible. We argue that knowledge-retrieval and reasoning tasks are not ideal for measuring generalization, as LLMs are not trained for specific tasks. Instead, we propose user behavior prediction, also a key aspect of personalization, as a theoretically sound, scalable, and robust alternative. We introduce a novel framework for this approach and test it on movie and music recommendation datasets for GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct. Results align with our framework’s predictions, showing GPT-4o outperforms GPT-4o-mini and Llama, though all models have much room for improvement, especially Llama. | Sougata Saha, Monojit Choudhury |  |

Thus, there has been significant research work in AI agents that interact with the internet through web browsing.However, there is also another interface designed specifically for machine interaction with online content: application programming interfaces (APIs). In this paper we ask – \*what if we were to take tasks traditionally tackled by Browsing Agents, and give AI agents access to APIs\*?To do so, we propose two varieties of agents: (1) an API-calling agent that attempts to perform online tasks through APIs only, similar to traditional coding agents, and (2) a Hybrid Agent that can interact with online data through both web browsing and APIs.In experiments on WebArena, a widely-used and realistic benchmark for web navigation tasks, we find that API-Based Agents outperform web Browsing Agents.Hybrid Agents out-perform both others nearly uniformly across tasks, resulting in a more than 24.0%... | Yueqi Song, Frank F.

To systematically track the progress in these languages, we introduce MiLiC-Eval, a benchmark designed for minority languages in China, featuring 24K instances across 9 tasks. MiLiC-Eval focuses on underrepresented writing systems. Its parallelism between tasks and languages can provide a faithful and fine-grained assessment of linguistic and problem-solving skills. Our evaluation reveals that open-source LLMs perform poorly on syntax-intensive tasks and multi-script languages. We further demonstrate how MiLiC-Eval can help advance LRL research in handling diverse writing systems and understanding the process of language adaptation. | Chen Zhang, Mingxu Tao, Zhiyuan Liao, Yansong Feng |  |

However, despite their strong generalization capabilities, instruction-following LLMs encounter difficulties when dealing with tasks that require domain knowledge. This work introduces a specialized instruction fine-tuning for the domain of computational argumentation (CA). The goal is to enable an LLM to effectively tackle any unseen CA tasks while preserving its generalization capabilities. Reviewing existing CA research, we crafted natural language instructions for 105 CA tasks to this end. On this basis, we developed a CA-specific benchmark for LLMs that allows for a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs’ capabilities in solving various CA tasks. We synthesized 52k CA-related instructions, adapting the self-instruct process to train a CA-specialized instruction-following LLM. Our experiments suggest that CA-specialized instruction fine-tuning significantly... | Maja Stahl, Timon Ziegenbein, Joonsuk Park, Henning Wachsmuth |  |

Specifically, LLM-DoS attacks aim to exhaust computational resources and block services. However, existing studies predominantly focus on white-box attacks, leaving black-box scenarios underexplored. In this paper, we introduce Auto-Generation for LLM-DoS (AutoDoS) attack, an automated algorithm designed for black-box LLMs. AutoDoS constructs the DoS Attack Tree and expands the node coverage to achieve effectiveness under black-box conditions. By transferability-driven iterative optimization, AutoDoS could work across different models in one prompt.Furthermore, we reveal that embedding the Length Trojan allows AutoDoS to bypass existing defenses more effectively.Experimental results show that AutoDoS significantly amplifies service response latency by over 250×↑, leading to severe resource... | Yuanhe Zhang, Zhenhong Zhou, Wei Zhang, Xinyue Wang, Xiaojun Jia, Yang Liu, Sen Su |  |

Yet they often diverge when confronted with complex, multi-factor moral dilemmas. To address these discrepancies, we propose a framework that synthesizes multiple LLMs’ moral judgments into a collectively formulated moral judgment, realigning models that deviate significantly from this consensus. Our aggregation mechanism fuses continuous moral acceptability scores (beyond binary labels) into a collective probability, weighting contributions by model reliability. For misaligned models, a targeted embedding-optimization procedure fine-tunes token embeddings for moral philosophical theories, minimizing JS divergence to the consensus while preserving semantic integrity. Experiments on a large-scale social moral dilemma dataset show our approach builds robust consensus and improves individual model fidelity. These findings highlight the value of data-driven moral alignment across multiple models and its... | Chenchen Yuan, Zheyu Zhang, Shuo Yang, Bardh Prenkaj, Gjergji Kasneci |  |

However, the recursive thinking capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) remain limited, particularly in the absence of expert-curated data for distillation. In this paper, we propose AvR: Alignment via Refinement, a novel method aimed at unlocking the potential of LLMs for recursive reasoning through long-form CoT. AvR introduces a refinement process that integrates criticism and improvement actions, guided by differentiable learning techniques to optimize refinement-aware rewards. As a result, the synthesized multi-round data can be organized as a long refinement thought, further enabling test-time scaling. Experimental results show that AvR significantly outperforms conventional preference optimization methods. Notably, with only 3k synthetic samples, our method boosts the performance of the LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct model by over 20% in win rate on... | Haoke Zhang, Xiaobo Liang, Cunxiang Wang, Juntao Li, Min Zhang |  |

CitaLaw features a diverse set of legal questions for both laypersons and practitioners, paired with a comprehensive corpus of law articles and precedent cases as a reference pool. This framework enables LLM-based systems to retrieve supporting citations from the reference corpus and align these citations with the corresponding sentences in their responses. Moreover, we introduce syllogism-inspired evaluation methods to assess the legal alignment between retrieved references and LLM-generated responses, as well as their consistency with user questions. Extensive experiments on 2 open-domain and 7 legal-specific LLMs demonstrate that integrating legal references substantially enhances response quality. Furthermore, our proposed syllogism-based evaluation method exhibits strong agreement with human judgments. | Kepu Zhang, Weijie Yu, Sunhao Dai, Jun Xu |  |

We propose an editing-based generative backdoor, named MEGen, aiming to expand the backdoor to generative tasks in a unified format of any text-to any text, leading to natural generations with a specific intention. Experiments show that MEGen achieves a high attack success rate by adjusting only a small set of local parameters with few-shot samples. Notably, we show that the backdoored model, when triggered, can freely output... | Jiyang Qiu, Xinbei Ma, Zhuosheng Zhang, Hai Zhao, Yun Li, Qianren Wang |  |

We propose a Bias Benchmark for Generation (BBG), an adaptation of the Bias Benchmark for QA (BBQ), designed to evaluate social bias in long-form generation by having LLMs generate continuations of story prompts. Building our benchmark in English and Korean, we measure the probability of neutral and biased generations across ten LLMs. We also compare our long-form story generation evaluation results with multiple-choice BBQ evaluation, showing that the two approaches produce inconsistent results. | Jiho Jin, Woosung Kang, Junho Myung, Alice Oh |  |

In this paper, we present Math2Visual, an automatic framework for generating pedagogically meaningful visuals from MWP text descriptions. Math2Visual leverages a pre-defined visual language and a design space grounded in interviews with math teachers, to illustrate the core mathematical relationships in MWPs.Using Math2Visual, we construct an annotated dataset of 1,903 visuals and evaluate Text-to-Image (TTI) models for their ability to generate visuals that align with our design. We further fine-tune several TTI models with our dataset, demonstrating improvements in educational visual generation.

This involves two key challenges: (i) how to effectively explore the solution space and generate more potentially correct solution candidates, and (ii) how to select the optimal solution from multiple solution candidates, both of which require a training-free approach without introducing a more powerful teacher model. To address these challenges, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Self-Play with Reasoning Consistency (RASPberry), which introduces a more flexible action-level sampling granularity compared to existing methods, leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search for efficient solution space exploration, and utilizes an enhanced version of reasoning consistency to guide the selection of the optimal solution.

Previous works integrate additional filters or finetune Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn adaptive retrieval to reduce the performance damage of noisy documents. However, prior noise filtering may lead to the loss of crucial information, and these methods do not focus on distracting documents with high semantic relevance, which is the most challenging problem. In this study, we propose a training method for fact-centric preference alignment (FPA) to improve the ability of LLMs to directly extract useful information from noisy retrieval results without prior filtering. Our method performs positive document mining based on factual consistency and uses LLMs self-generated synthetic data as training data without manual annotation. We evaluate our FPA on four question answering benchmarks, and the... | Jia Hao, Chunhong Zhang, Jiarun Liu, Haiyu Zhao, Zhiqiang Zhan, Zheng Hu |  |

Existing prompt-based debiasing methods exhibit instability due to their sensitivity to prompt changes, while fine-tuning-based techniques incur substantial computational overhead and catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we propose FairSteer, a novel inference-time debiasing framework without requiring customized prompt design or model retraining. Motivated by the linear representation hypothesis, our preliminary investigation demonstrates that fairness-related features can be encoded into separable directions in the hidden activation space. FairSteer operates in three steps: biased activation detection, debiasing steering vector (DSV) computation, and dynamic activation steering. Specifically, it first trains a lightweight linear classifier to detect bias signatures in activations, and then computes DSVs as intervention directions derived from small... | Yichen Li, Zhiting Fan, Ruizhe Chen, Xiaotang Gai, Luqi Gong, Yan Zhang, Zuozhu Liu |  |

While psychology theory-based human annotations have contributed to multimodal emotion tasks, the subjective nature of emotional perception often leads to inconsistent annotations, limiting the robustness of current models. Addressing these challenges requires more fine-grained methods and evaluation frameworks. In this paper, we propose the Retrieval-Augmented Emotion Reasoning (RAER) framework, a plug-and-play module that enhances MLLMs’ ability to tackle compound and context-rich emotion tasks. To systematically evaluate model performance, we introduce the Stimulus-Armed Bandit (SAB) framework, designed to benchmark emotional reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we construct the Compound Emotion QA dataset, an AI-generated multimodal dataset aimed at strengthening emotion understanding in MLLMs. Experimental... | Zhuofan Wen, Zheng Lian, Shun Chen, Hailiang Yao, Longjiang Yang, Bin Liu, Jianhua Tao |  |

However, integrating the vital structural information of KGs into Large Language Models (LLMs) and outputting predictions deterministically remains challenging. To address this, we propose a new method called GLTW, which encodes the structural information of KGs and merges it with LLMs to enhance KGC performance. Specifically, we introduce an improved Graph Transformer (iGT) that effectively encodes subgraphs with both local and global structural information and inherits the characteristics of language model, bypassing training from scratch. Also, we develop a subgraph-based multi-classification training objective, using all entities within KG as classification objects, to boost learning efficiency. Importantly, we combine iGT with an LLM that takes KG language prompts as input. Our extensive experiments on various KG datasets show that GLTW achieves significant performance... | Kangyang Luo, Yuzhuo Bai, Cheng Gao, Shuzheng Si, Zhu Liu, Yingli Shen, Zhitong Wang, Cunliang Kong, Wenhao Li, Yufei Huang, Ye Tian, Xuantang Xiong, Lei Han, Maosong Sun |  |

However, ICL performance is highly dependent on the selection of these demonstrations. Recent work explores retrieval-based methods for selecting query-specific demonstrations, but these approaches often rely on surrogate objectives such as metric learning, failing to directly optimize ICL performance. Consequently, they struggle to identify truly beneficial demonstrations. Moreover, their discriminative retrieval paradigm is ineffective when the candidate pool lacks sufficient high-quality demonstrations. To address these challenges, we propose GenICL, a novel generative preference learning framework that leverages LLM feedback to directly optimize demonstration selection for ICL. Experiments on 19 datasets across 11 task categories demonstrate that GenICL achieves superior performance than existing methods in selecting the most effective... | Zheng Zhang, Shaocheng Lan, Lei Song, Jiang Bian, Yexin Li, Kan Ren |  |

Despite so, the majority of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) are “character-blind” and struggle in spelling tasks, although they still seem to acquire some character knowledge during pre-training, a phenomenon dubbed Spelling Miracle. To shed light on this phenomenon, we systematically evaluate a range of PLMs with different parameter sizes using a controlled binary substring identification task. Through a series of experiments, we propose the first comprehensive investigation on where, when, and how a PLMs develop awareness of characters and substrings, with a particular linguistic focus on morphemic units such as prefixes, suffixes, and roots. | Cristiano Ciaccio, Marta Sartor, Alessio Miaschi, Felice Dell'Orletta |  |

The dialogue’s life-cycle spans from Prelude through Interlocution to Epilogue, encompassing rich dialogue elements. Despite large volumes of dialogue-related studies, there is a lack of systematic investigation into the dialogue stages to frame benchmark construction that covers comprehensive dialogue elements. This hinders the precise modeling, generation and assessment of LLMs-based dialogue systems. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we introduce a new research task—Dialogue Element MOdeling, including Element Awareness and Dialogue Agent Interaction, and propose a novel benchmark, DEMO, designed for a comprehensive dialogue modeling and assessment. On this basis, we further build the DEMO agent with the adept ability to model dialogue elements via imitation... | Minzheng Wang, Xinghua Zhang, Kun Chen, Nan Xu, Haiyang Yu, Fei Huang, Wenji Mao, Yongbin Li |  |

To overcome this, we introduce \*\*InfiniteICL\*\*, a framework that parallels context and parameters in LLMs with short- and long-term memory in human cognitive systems, focusing on transforming temporary context knowledge into permanent parameter updates. This approach significantly reduces memory usage, maintains robust performance across varying input lengths, and theoretically enables infinite context integration through the principles of context knowledge elicitation, selection, and consolidation. Evaluations demonstrate that our method reduces context length by 90% while achieving 103% average performance of full-context prompting across fact recall, grounded reasoning, and skill acquisition tasks. When conducting sequential multi-turn transformations on complex, real-world contexts (with length up to 2M... | Bowen Cao, Deng Cai, Wai Lam |  |

However, the scarcity of related datasets, with only one published dataset featuring highly uniform dialogue scenarios, hinders model development in this field. To address this, we introduce MECAD, the first multimodal, multi-scenario MECTEC dataset, comprising 989 conversations from 56 TV series spanning a wide range of dialogue contexts. In addition, existing MECTEC methods fail to explicitly model emotional and causal contexts and neglect the fusion of semantic information at different levels, leading to performance degradation. In this paper, we propose M3HG, a novel model that explicitly captures emotional and causal contexts and effectively fuses contextual information at both inter- and intra-utterance levels via a multimodal heterogeneous graph.... | Qiao Liang, Ying Shen, Tiantian Chen, Lin Zhang |  |

However, video popularity is shaped by complex cultural and social factors that such approaches often overlook. We argue that Large Language Models (LLMs), with their deep contextual awareness, can better capture these nuances. To bridge the gap between pixel-based video data and token-based LLMs, we convert frame-level visuals into sequential text representations using Vision-Language Models. This enables LLMs to process multimodal content—titles, frame-based descriptions, and captions—capturing both engagement intensity (view count) and geographic spread (number of countries where a video trends). On 13,639 popular videos, a supervised neural network using content embeddings achieves 80% accuracy, while our LLM-based approach reaches 82% without fine-tuning. Combining the neural network’s predictions with the LLM further improves accuracy to... | Pratik Kayal, Pascal Mettes, Nima Dehmamy, Minsu Park |  |

Existing defense mechanisms, such as safety fine-tuning and model editing, either require extensive parameter modifications or lack precision, leading to performance degradation on general tasks, which is unsuitable to post-deployment safety alignment. To address these challenges, we propose DELMAN (\*\*D\*\*ynamic \*\*E\*\*diting for \*\*L\*\*L\*\*M\*\*s J\*\*A\*\*ilbreak Defe\*\*N\*\*se), a novel approach leveraging direct model editing for precise, dynamic protection against jailbreak attacks. DELMAN directly updates a minimal set of relevant parameters to neutralize harmful behaviors while preserving the model’s utility. To avoid triggering a safe response in benign context, we incorporate KL-divergence regularization to ensure the updated model remains consistent with the original... | Yi Wang, Fenghua Weng, Sibei Yang, Zhan Qin, Minlie Huang, Wenjie Wang |  |

We address this gap with FAME, a dataset of 500 meetings in English and 300 in German produced by MIMIC, our new multi-agent meeting synthesis framework that generates meeting transcripts on a given knowledge source by defining psychologically grounded participant profiles, outlining the conversation, and orchestrating a large language model (LLM) debate. A modular post-processing step refines these outputs, mitigating potential repetitiveness and overly formal tones, ensuring coherent, credible dialogues at scale. We also propose a psychologically grounded evaluation framework assessing naturalness, social behavior authenticity, and transcript difficulties. Human assessments show that FAME approximates real-meeting spontaneity (4.5/5 in naturalness), preserves speaker-centric challenges (3/5 in spoken language), and introduces richer... | Frederic Kirstein, Muneeb Khan, Jan Philip Wahle, Terry Ruas, Bela Gipp |  |

A resulting consensus is that CS can be explained by the syntax of the contributing languages. There is however no large-scale, multi-language, cross-phenomena experiment that tests this claim. When designing such an experiment, we need to make sure that the system that is predicting where bilinguals tend to switch has access only to syntactic information. We provide such an experiment here. Results show that syntax alone is sufficient for an automatic system to distinguish between sentences in minimal pairs of CS, to the same degree as bilingual humans. Furthermore, the learnt syntactic patterns generalise well to unseen language pairs. | Igor Sterner, Simone Teufel |  |

We present Optima, a novel framework that addresses these issues by significantly enhancing both communication efficiency and task effectiveness in LLM-based MAS through training. Optima employs an iterative generate, rank, select, and train paradigm with a reward function balancing task performance, token efficiency, and communication readability. We explore various algorithms, including Supervised Fine-Tuning, Direct Preference Optimization, and their hybrid approaches, providing insights into their effectiveness-efficiency trade-offs. We integrate Monte Carlo Tree Search-inspired techniques for DPO data generation, treating conversation turns as tree nodes to explore diverse interaction paths.

Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive world knowledge across different benchmarks and domains but their knowledge is inconveniently scattered across their billions of parameters. In this paper, we propose a prompt-based method to construct domain-specific KGs by extracting knowledge solely from LLMs’ parameters. First, we use an LLM to create a schema for a specific domain, which contains a set of domain-representative entities and relations. After that, we use the schema to guide the LLM through an iterative data generation process equipped with Chain-of-Verification (CoVe) for increased data quality. Using this method, we construct KGs for two domains: books and landmarks, which we then evaluate against Wikidata, an open-source human-created KG. Our results show that LLMs can... | Marinela Parovic, Ze Li, Jinhua Du |  |

In this work, we deliver an in-depth analysis of the behavior across different choices of learning methods from the perspective of both performance and calibration. Through extensive controlled experiments, we observe that the miscalibration problem exists across all learning methods in low-resource setups. To achieve simultaneous gain for both in-task performance and calibration, we then study the potential of self-ensembling applied at different modeling stages (e.g., variations of in-context examples or variations in prompts or different ensembling strategies) to make the predictions more calibrated and have comparable or even better performance. We find that... | Chengzu Li, Han Zhou, Goran Glavas, Anna Korhonen, Ivan Vulic |  |

Existing work primarily focuses on behavior cloning from expert demonstrations or preference learning through exploratory trajectory sampling. However, these methods often struggle to address long-horizon tasks, where suboptimal actions accumulate step by step, causing agents to deviate from correct task trajectories.To address this, we highlight the importance of timely calibration and the need to automatically construct calibration trajectories for training agents. We propose Step-Level Trajectory Calibration (STeCa), a novel framework for LLM agent learning. Specifically, STeCa identifies suboptimal actions through a step-level reward comparison during exploration. It constructs calibrated trajectories using LLM-driven reflection, enabling agents to learn from improved decision-making processes. We finally leverage these calibrated trajectories with... | Hanlin Wang, Jian Wang, Chak Tou Leong, Wenjie Li |  |

However, existing approaches primarily focus on improving the quality of correct training data, e.g., distilling high-quality correct solutions from advanced models, neglecting the value contained in error data, potentially hindering the model’s reflective ability. Though some studies attempted to leverage error data, they often involve complex mechanisms, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explore error nodes.In this work, we propose to enhance LLM’s reasoning ability by Learning from Errors for MatheMatical Advancement (LEMMA). LEMMA constructs data consists of an incorrect solution with an erroneous step and a reflection connection to a correct solution for fine-tuning. Specifically, we systematically analyze the model-generated error types and introduce an _error-type grounded mistake augmentation_ method to collect diverse and representative errors.

Decision-Making in Multi-Agent Debate](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.606/) |  | 0 | Much of the success of multi-agent debates depends on carefully choosing the right parameters. The decision-making protocol stands out as it can highly impact final model answers, depending on how decisions are reached. Systematic comparison of decision protocols is difficult because many studies alter multiple discussion parameters beyond the protocol. So far, it has been largely unknown how decision-making influences different tasks. This work systematically evaluates the impact of seven decision protocols (e.g., majority voting, unanimity consensus). We change only one variable at a time - the decision protocol - to analyze how different methods affect the collaboration between agents and measure differences in knowledge and reasoning tasks. Our results show that voting protocols improve performance by 13.2% in reasoning tasks and consensus protocols by 2.8% in knowledge tasks compared to other decision protocols. Increasing the number of agents improves performance, while more... | Lars Benedikt Kaesberg, Jonas Becker, Jan Philip Wahle, Terry Ruas, Bela Gipp |  |

Previous work primarily defines sarcasm as a form of verbal irony, which covers only a subset of real-world sarcastic expressions. However, sarcasm serves multifaceted functions and manifests itself through various rhetorical devices, such as echoic mention, rhetorical question and hyperbole. To fully capture its complexity, this paper investigates fine-grained sarcasm classification through the lens of rhetorical devices, and introduces RedSD, a RhEtorical Device-Aware Sarcasm Dataset with counterfactually augmented data.To construct the dataset, we extract sarcastic dialogues from situation comedies (i.e., sitcoms), and summarize nine rhetorical devices commonly employed in sarcasm. We then propose a rhetorical device-aware counterfactual data generation pipeline facilitated by both Large Language Models (LLMs) and human revision. Additionally, we propose duplex counterfactual augmentation that... | Qingqing Hong, Dongyu Zhang, Jiayi Lin, Dapeng Yin, Shuyue Zhu, Junli Wang |  |

While many-shot ICL shows promising performance through scaled demonstrations, the selection method for many-shot demonstrations remains limited to random selection in existing work. Since the conventional instance-level retrieval is not suitable for many-shot scenarios, we hypothesize that the data requirements for in-context learning and fine-tuning are analogous. To this end, we introduce a novel gradient matching approach that selects demonstrations by aligning fine-tuning gradients between the entire training set of the target task and the selected examples, so as to approach the learning effect on the entire training set within the selected examples. Through gradient matching on relatively small models, e.g., Qwen2.5-3B or Llama3-8B, our method consistently outperforms random selection on... | Jianfei Zhang, Bei Li, Jun Bai, Rumei Li, Yanmeng Wang, Chenghua Lin, Wenge Rong |  |

Such collections are highly heterogeneous, with varying degrees of OCR quality, spelling conventions and other inconsistencies —all phenomena that are underrepresented in the training data of standard embedding models, with ramifications for their generalization. In our paper, we show that this problem can be alleviated with a simple and inexpensive method that does not require supervision or in-domain training. Specifically, we fine-tune existing multilingual models using noisy texts and a contrastive loss. We show that these models show considerable improvements across different noise conditions. Control experiments indicate minimal, and occasionally positive, impact on standard similarity tasks. These findings suggest that embedding models can be inexpensively adapted for cross-lingual semantic search in heterogeneous, digitized corpora.

It contains 1,297 expert-annotated problems covering six core areas: classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, electromagnetism, atomic physics, and optics.Each problem requires advanced physics knowledge and mathematical reasoning.We develop a robust automated evaluation system for precise and reliable validation. Our evaluation of leading foundation models reveals substantial limitations. Even the most advanced model, o3-mini, achieves only 59.9% accuracy, highlighting significant challenges in solving high-level scientific problems.Through comprehensive error analysis, exploration of diverse prompting strategies, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based knowledge augmentation, we identify key areas for improvement, laying the foundation for future advancements. | Kaiyue Feng, Yilun Zhao, Yixin Liu, Tianyu Yang, Chen Zhao, John Sous, Arman Cohan |  |

This throws into question popular single-prompt evaluation practices. We present DOVE (Dataset Of Variation Evaluation) a large-scale dataset containing prompt perturbations of various evaluation benchmarks. In contrast to previous work, we examine LLM sensitivity from an holistic perspective, and assess the joint effects of perturbations along various dimensions, resulting in thousands of perturbations per instance. We evaluate several model families against DOVE, leading to several findings, including efficient methods for choosing well-performing prompts, observing that few-shot examples reduce sensitivity, and identifying instances which are inherently hard across all perturbations. DOVE consists of more than 250M prompt perturbations and model outputs, which we make publicly available to spur a... | Eliya Habba, Ofir Arviv, Itay Itzhak, Yotam Perlitz, Elron Bandel, Leshem Choshen, Michal ShmueliScheuer, Gabriel Stanovsky |  |

Prior research has explored various avenues to enhance alignment efficiency, primarily through minimal-data training or data-driven activations to identify key attention heads. However, these approaches inherently introduce data dependency, which hinders generalization and reusability. To address this issue and enhance model alignment efficiency, we propose the Attention Localization and Pruning Strategy ALPS, an efficient algorithm that localizes the most task-sensitive attention heads and prunes by restricting attention training updates to these heads, thereby reducing alignment costs. Experimental results demonstrate that our method activates only 10% of attention parameters during fine-tuning while achieving a 2% performance improvement over baselines on three tasks. Moreover, the identified task-specific heads are transferable across datasets and mitigate... | Hao Chen, Haoze Li, Zhiqing Xiao, Lirong Gao, Qi Zhang, Xiaomeng Hu, Ningtao Wang, Xing Fu, Junbo Zhao |  |

While safety-aligned LLMs can effectively defend against normal harmful queries, they remain vulnerable to such attacks. Existing defense methods primarily rely on fine-tuning or input modification, which often suffer from limited generalization and reduced utility. To address this, we introduce DeTAM, a finetuning-free defense approach that improves the defensive capabilities against jailbreak attacks of LLMs via targeted attention modification. Specifically, we analyze the differences in attention scores between successful and unsuccessful defenses to identify the attention heads sensitive to jailbreak attacks. During inference, we reallocate attention to emphasize users’ core intentions, minimizing interference from attack tokens. Our experimental results demonstrate that DeTAM outperforms various baselines in jailbreak defense and exhibits robust... | Yu Li, Han Jiang, Zhihua Wei |  |

As artificial general intelligence (AGI) progresses, integrating large language models (LLMs) with mathematical reasoning tasks is becoming increasingly significant. This survey provides \*\*the first comprehensive analysis of mathematical reasoning in the era of multimodal large language models (MLLMs)\*\*. We review over 200 studies published since 2021, and examine the state-of-the-art developments in Math-LLMs, with a focus on multimodal settings. We categorize the field into three dimensions: benchmarks, methodologies, and challenges. In particular, we explore multimodal mathematical reasoning pipeline, as well as the role of (M)LLMs and the associated methodologies. Finally, we identify five major challenges hindering the realization of AGI in this domain, offering insights into the future direction for enhancing multimodal... | Yibo Yan, Jiamin Su, Jianxiang He, Fangteng Fu, Xu Zheng, Yuanhuiyi Lyu, Kun Wang, Shen Wang, Qingsong Wen, Xuming Hu |  |

We demonstrate that, by effectively encoding ego-graphs (1-hop neighbourhoods), we can reduce the reliance on resource-intensive textual encoders. This makes the model both fast at training and inference time, as well as frugal in terms of cost. We perform a comprehensive evaluation on three popular datasets and show that FnF-TG can achieve superior performance compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. We also extend inductive learning to a fully inductive setting, where relations don’t rely on transductive (fixed) representations, as in previous work, but are a function of their textual description. Additionally, we introduce new variants of existing datasets, specifically designed to test the performance of models on unseen relations at inference time, thus offering a new... | Andrei Catalin Coman, Christos Theodoropoulos, MarieFrancine Moens, James Henderson |  |

Questions initially requiring retrieval may become answerable from pretraining knowledge as newer models incorporate more recent information during pretraining, making it difficult to distinguish evidence-based reasoning from recall. We introduce NeoQA (News Events for Out-of-training Question Answering), a benchmark designed to address this issue. To construct NeoQA, we generated timelines and knowledge bases of fictional news events and entities along with news articles and Q&A pairs to prevent LLMs from leveraging pretraining knowledge, ensuring that no prior evidence exists in their training data. We propose our dataset as a new platform for evaluating evidence-based question answering, as it requires LLMs to generate responses exclusively from retrieved evidence and only when sufficient evidence is available. NeoQA enables controlled... | Max Glockner, Xiang Jiang, Leonardo F. R. Ribeiro, Iryna Gurevych, Markus Dreyer |  |

While existing methods enhance dialogue performance by extracting core patterns from dialogue data and integrating them into models, two key challenges persist: (1) heavy reliance on human experts for dialogue strategy induction, and (2) LLM-based automatic extraction often focuses on summarizing specific behaviors, neglecting the underlying thought processes behind strategy selection. In this paper, we present ChatMap, which focuses on enhancing customer service chatbots by mining thought processes using a Multi-Agent aPproach. Specifically, the process begins by extracting customer requests and solutions from a raw dialogue dataset, followed by clustering similar requests, analyzing the thought processes behind solutions, and refining service thoughts.

While recent advancements have demonstrated the efficacy of automatically optimizing either the system or user prompt to boost performance, such unilateral approaches often yield suboptimal outcomes due to the interdependent nature of these components. In this work, we introduce P3, a novel self-improvement framework that concurrently optimizes both system and user prompts through an iterative process. The offline optimized prompts are further leveraged to promote online prompting by performing query-dependent prompt optimization. Extensive experiments on general tasks (e.g., Arena-hard and Alpaca-eval) and reasoning tasks (e.g., GSM8K and GPQA) demonstrate that P3 achieves superior performance in the realm of automatic prompt optimization. Our results highlight the effectiveness of a holistic optimization strategy in enhancing LLM... | Xinyu Zhang, Yuanquan Hu, Fangchao Liu, Zhicheng Dou |  |

In this work, we evaluate the extent to which vision-and-language models (VLMs) are compatible with humans when producing or judging the appropriateness of vague quantifiers in visual contexts. We release a novel dataset, VAQUUM, containing 20,300 human ratings on quantified statements across a total of 1089 images. Using this dataset, we compare human judgments and VLM predictions using three different evaluation methods. Our findings show that VLMs, like humans, are influenced by object counts in vague quantifier use. However, we find significant inconsistencies across models in different evaluation settings, suggesting that judging and producing vague quantifiers rely on two different processes.

To systematically examine visual-mathematical reasoning in MLLMs, we (1) evaluate their understanding of geometric primitives, (2) test multi-step reasoning, and (3) explore a potential solution to improve visual reasoning capabilities. Our findings reveal fundamental shortcomings in shape recognition, with top models achieving under 50% accuracy in identifying regular polygons. We analyze these failures through the lens of dual-process theory and show that MLLMs rely on System 1 (intuitive, memorized associations) rather than System 2 (deliberate reasoning). Consequently, MLLMs fail to count the sides of both familiar and novel shapes, suggesting they have neither learned the concept of “sides” nor effectively process visual inputs.... | William Rudman, Michal Golovanevsky, Amir Bar, Vedant Palit, Yann LeCun, Carsten Eickhoff, Ritambhara Singh |  |

However, most existing methods overfit to specific models, causing edited knowledge to be discarded during each LLM update and requiring frequent re-editing, which is particularly burdensome in today’s rapidly evolving open-source community. To address this issue, we propose the problem of cross-model knowledge editing and introduce \*\*MindBridge\*\*, a scalable solution inspired by the low coupling between modality processing and LLMs in multi-modal models. MindBridge introduces the novel concept of \*\*memory modality\*\*, which encodes edited knowledge as an independent modality. It first performs LLM-agnostic pre-training of the memory modality and then integrates it with various LLMs. Extensive experiments on multiple LLMs and popular knowledge editing datasets demonstrate that MindBridge achieves superior... | Shuaike Li, Kai Zhang, Qi Liu, Enhong Chen |  |

Current approaches mainly rely on costly annotations and are not comprehensive – in terms of evaluating all aspects, such as relations, attributes, and dependencies between aspects. Therefore, we introduce the FIHA (automated Fine-graIned Hallucination evAluation in LVLMs), which could access LVLMs hallucination in an LLM-free and annotation-free way and model the dependency between different types of hallucinations. FIHA can generate Q&A pairs on any image dataset at minimal cost, enabling hallucination assessment from both image and caption. Based on this approach, we introduce a benchmark called FIHA-v1, which consists of diverse questions on various images from three datasets. Furthermore, we use the Davidson Scene Graph (DSG) to organize the structure among Q&A pairs, in which we can increase the... | Bowen Yan, Zhengsong Zhang, Liqiang Jing, Eftekhar Hossain, Xinya Du |  |

By operationalizing proto-role theory, which characterizes agents via properties such as \*instigation\* and \*volition\* and patients via properties such as \*change of state\*, we examine the ability of LLMs to answer questions that require complex, multi-step event reasoning. Specifically, we investigate the extent to which LLMs capture semantic roles such as “agent” and “patient” through zero-shot prompts, and whether incorporating semantic proto-role labeling (SPRL) context improves semantic role labeling (SRL) performance in a zero-shot setting. We find that, while SPRL context sometimes degrades SRL accuracy in high-performing models (e.g., GPT-4o), it also uncovers an internal consistency between SPRL and SRL predictions that mirrors... | Elizabeth Spaulding, Shafiuddin Rehan Ahmed, James H.

In this paper, we introduce G\small{E}\normalsize{AR}, a system that advances RAG performance through two key innovations: (i) an efficient graph expansion mechanism that augments any conventional base retriever, such as BM25, and (ii) an agent framework that incorporates the resulting graph-based retrieval into a multi-step retrieval framework. Our evaluation demonstrates G\small{E}\normalsize{AR}‘s superior retrieval capabilities across three multi-hop question answering datasets. Notably, our system achieves state-of-the-art results with improvements exceeding 10% on the challenging MuSiQue dataset, while consuming fewer tokens and requiring fewer iterations than existing multi-step retrieval systems.

To achieve this goal, in a first step, several existing NMT models were analysed and compared in order to identify the system with the highest performance on the original corpus. In a second step, after using the best NMT system, we semi-automatically designed and applied a number of rules to refine and improve the quality of the produced resource, creating a new corpus named WebNLG-IT. We used this resource for fine-tuning several LLMs for RDF-to-text tasks. In this way, comparing the performance of LLM-based generators on both Italian and English, we have (1) evaluated the quality of WebNLG-IT with respect to the original English version, (2) released the first fine-tuned LLM-based system for generating Italian from semantic web triples and (3) introduced an Italian version of a modular generation... | Michael Oliverio, Pier Felice Balestrucci, Alessandro Mazzei, Valerio Basile |  |

However, due to patient data privacy concerns and computational costs, many healthcare providers prefer using small, locally-hosted models over external generic LLMs. This study presents a comprehensive domain- and task-specific adaptation process for the open-source LLaMA-2 13 billion parameter model, enabling it to generate high-quality clinical notes from outpatient patient-doctor dialogues. Our process incorporates continued pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning from both AI and human feedback. We introduced a new approach, DistillDirect, for performing on-policy reinforcement learning with Gemini 1.0 Pro as the teacher model. Our resulting model, LLaMA-Clinic, can generate clinical notes comparable in quality to those authored by physicians.

While prior work has focused on improving robustness for feed-forward and convolutional architectures, the robustness of recurrent networks and modern state space models (SSMs), such as S4, remains understudied. These architectures pose unique challenges due to their sequential processing and complex parameter dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a novel regularization technique based on Growth Bound Matrices (GBM) to improve NLP model robustness by reducing the impact of input perturbations on model outputs. We focus on computing the GBM for three architectures: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), State Space models (S4), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Our method aims to (1) enhance resilience against word substitution attacks, (2) improve generalization on clean text, and (3) providing the first systematic analysis of SSM (S4) robustness.... | Mohammed Bouri, Adnane Saoud |  |

This paper presents \*\*QCompiler\*\*, a neuro-symbolic framework inspired by linguistic grammar rules and compiler design, to bridge this gap. It theoretically presents a minimal yet sufficient Backus-Naur Form (BNF) grammar G[q] to formalize complex queries. Unlike previous methods, this grammar maintains completeness while minimizing redundancy. Based on this, QCompiler includes a query expression translator, a Lexical syntax parser, and a Recursive Descent Processor to compile queries into Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) for execution. The atomicity of the sub-queries in the leaf nodes ensures more precise document retrieval and response generation, significantly improving the RAG system’s ability to address complex queries. | Yuyao Zhang, Zhicheng Dou, Xiaoxi Li, Jiajie Jin, Yongkang Wu, Zhonghua Li, Ye Qi, JiRong Wen |  |

Recently, researchers introduced Mamba, an advanced model built upon State Space Models (SSMs) that offers linear complexity and constant memory. Although Mamba is reported to match or surpass the performance of attention-based models, our analysis reveals a performance gap: Mamba excels in tasks that involve localized key information but faces challenges with tasks that require handling distributed key information. Our controlled experiments suggest that the inconsistency arises from Mamba’s reliance on \*\*local pattern shortcuts\*\* across model scales (10M to 1.4B), which enable Mamba to remember local key information within its limited memory but hinder its ability to retain more dispersed information. Therefore, we introduce a global gate module into the Mamba model to address this issue.... | Wangjie You, Zecheng Tang, Juntao Li, Lili Yao, Min Zhang |  |

Despite its effectiveness in removing undesired knowledge, GA leads to severe utility degradation in MGMs. In this paper, we explore the mechanism behind this degradation by quantifying two distinct forms of knowledge in MGMs: (i) Conceptual Knowledge, which represents specific information about concepts; (ii) Natural Knowledge, which refers to the ability to produce coherent and logically structured outputs. Our analysis reveals that applying GA globally not only removes the targeted Conceptual Knowledge but also inadvertently diminishes Natural Knowledge, resulting in utility collapse. To address this issue, we propose Forget the Token and Pixel (FTTP), a novel approach that selectively applies GA to targeted Conceptual Knowledge while preserving Natural Knowledge through Gradient... | Jiaqi Li, Chuanyi Zhang, Miaozeng Du, Hui Zhang, Yongrui Chen, Qianshan Wei, Junfeng Fang, Ruipeng Wang, Sheng Bi, Guilin Qi |  |

We do so through empirical analysis of model initialisation and architecture, synthetic training data, preference optimisation with synthetic data and tweaking all other components. We empirically demonstrate that this training recipe also scales well with more compute getting results on par with leading SLMs in a fraction of the compute cost. We hope these insights will make SLM training and research more accessible. In the context of SLM scaling laws, our results far outperform predicted compute optimal performance, giving an optimistic view to SLM feasibility.

However, vanilla fine-tuning often leads to catastrophic forgetting, compromising the broad general abilities of LLMs and introducing potential security risks. These abilities, which are developed using proprietary and unavailable training data, make simple data replay methods ineffective. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel approach called \*\*Ra\*\*tionale \*\*Dis\*\*tillation. RaDis harnesses the strong generative capabilities of LLMs to create rationales for training data, which are then “replayed” to prevent forgetting. These rationales connect prior knowledge with new tasks, acting as self-distillation targets to regulate the training process. By jointly training on reference translations and self-generated rationales, the model can learn new translation skills while preserving its general abilities... | Junhong Wu, Yang Zhao, Yangyifan Xu, Bing Liu, Chengqing Zong |  |

But when are these connectives necessary to avoid possible misunderstandings? We investigate this question by first building a corpus of 4,274 text revisions in each of which a connective was explicitly inserted. For a subset of 250 cases, we collect plausibility annotations on other connectives to check whether they would represent suitable alternative relations. The results of this annotation show that several relations are often perceived as plausible in our data. Furthermore, we analyze the extent to which large language models can identify instances with multiple plausible relations as a possible source of misunderstandings. We find that the models predict plausibility of individual connectives with up to 66% accuracy, but they are not reliable in estimating when multiple relations are plausible. | Berfin Aktas, Michael Roth |  |

In this work, we extend the WMT24 dataset to cover 55 languages by collecting new human-written references and post-edits for 46 new languages/dialects in addition to post-edits of the references in 8 out of 9 languages in the original WMT24 dataset. We benchmark a variety of MT providers and LLMs on the collected dataset using automatic metrics and find that LLMs are the best-performing MT systems in all 55 languages. However, we caution against using our results to reach strong conclusions about MT quality without a human-based evaluation due to limitations of automatic evaluation metrics, which we leave for future work. | Daniel Deutsch, Eleftheria Briakou, Isaac Rayburn Caswell, Mara Finkelstein, Rebecca Galor, Juraj Juraska, Geza Kovacs, Alison Lui, Ricardo Rei, Jason Riesa, Shruti Rijhwani, Parker Riley, Elizabeth Salesky, Firas Trabelsi, Stephanie Winkler, Biao Zhang, Markus Freitag |  |

To that end, we introduce the ̲Graph-based ̲Formal- ̲Logical ̲Distributional ̲Semantics (GFoLDS) prototype, a pretrained LM over graph representations of logical forms, as a proof-of-concept of LFLMs. Using GFoLDS, we present strong experimental evidence that LFLMs can leverage the built-in, basic linguistic knowledge inherent in such models to immediately begin learning more complex patterns. On downstream tasks, we show that GFoLDS vastly outperforms textual, transformer LMs (BERT) pretrained on the same data, indicating that LFLMs can learn with substantially less data than models over plain text. Furthermore, we show that the performance of this model is likely to scale with additional parameters and pretraining data, suggesting the viability of LFLMs in real-world applications. | Michael Sullivan |  |

Though existing LLM benchmarks are capable of evaluating specificcapabilities of LLMs in English as well as in various mid- to low-resource languages, including those in the Southeast Asian (SEA)region, a comprehensive and culturally representative evaluation suite for the SEA languages has not been developed thus far.Here, we present SEA-HELM, a holistic linguistic and cultural LLM evaluation suite that emphasises SEA languages, comprisingfive core pillars: (1) NLP CLASSICS, (2) LLM-SPECIFICS, (3) SEA LINGUISTICS, (4) SEA CULTURE, (5) SAFETY.

To address these issues, we propose TRANS-ZERO, a self-play framework that leverages only monolingual data and the intrinsic multilingual knowledge of LLM. TRANS-ZERO combines Genetic Monte-Carlo Tree Search (G-MCTS) with preference optimization, achieving strong translation performance that rivals supervised methods. Experiments demonstrate that this approach not only matches the performance of models trained on large-scale parallel data but also excels in non-English translation directions. Further analysis reveals that G-MCTS itself significantly enhances translation quality by exploring semantically consistent candidates through iterative translations, providing a robust foundation for the framework’s success. | Wei Zou, Sen Yang, Yu Bao, Shujian Huang, Jiajun Chen, Shanbo Cheng |  |

To address the limitations, we propose a simple yet effective strategy for generating and calibrating distributions of CLIPScore values. Leveraging a model-agnostic conformal risk control framework, we calibrate CLIPScore values for task-specific control variables, tackling the aforementioned limitations. Experimental results demonstrate that using conformal risk control, over score distributions produced with simple methods such as input masking, can achieve competitive performance compared to more complex approaches. Our method effectively detects erroneous words, while providing formal guarantees aligned with desired risk levels. It also improves the correlation between uncertainty estimations and prediction errors, thus enhancing the... | Gonçalo Emanuel Cavaco Gomes, Bruno Martins, Chrysoula Zerva |  |

Despite its effectiveness, it has been observed that the capability of DPO to generate human-preferred response is limited and the results of DPO are far from resilient. To address these limitations, in this paper we propose a novel Self-Guided Direct Preference Optimization algorithm, i.e., SGDPO, which incorporates a pilot term to steer the gradient flow during the optimization process, allowing for fine-grained control over the updates of chosen and rejected rewards. We provide a detailed theoretical analysis of our proposed method and elucidate its operational mechanism. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive experiments on various models and benchmarks. The extensive experimental results demonstrate the consistency between the empirical results and our theoretical analysis and confirm the effectiveness of our proposed approach (up to... | Wenqiao Zhu, Ji Liu, Lulu Wang, Jun Wu, Yulun Zhang |  |

However, existing methods remain hindered by high costs—either through expensive API access or additional intermediate training—and are limited in their ability to generalize across different domains. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-agent debate framework based on the Socratic questioning strategy, abbreviated as SoDa. Distinguished from previous methods that prioritize data quantity, we highlight the wisdom of Socratic questioning in augmenting reasoning quality by deepening the thinking process to encourage exploration and broadening it to motivate self-reflection on each question. Combined with our efficient production pipeline, SoDa enables scaling while maintaining affordable costs. We use SoDa to generate diverse datasets for mathematics and code generation tasks with the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model, successfully fine-tuning a range of... | Jiangbo Pei, Peiyu Liu, Xin Zhao, Aidong Men, Yang Liu |  |

Through extensive experiments across three diverse price prediction datasets, we demonstrate that a Mistral-7B model fine-tuned with quantile heads significantly outperforms traditional approaches for both point and distributional estimations, as measured by three established metrics each for prediction accuracy and distributional calibration.Our systematic comparison of LLM... | Nikhita Vedula, Dushyanta Dhyani, Laleh Jalali, Boris N.

However, their capabilities in guiding users to solve complex real-world tasks remain underexplored. To address this limitation, in this work, we focus on coding tutoring, a challenging problem that requires tutors to proactively guide students towards completing predefined coding tasks. We propose a novel agent workflow, Trace-and-Verify (TRAVER), which combines knowledge tracing to estimate a student’s knowledge state and turn-by-turn verification to ensure effective guidance toward task completion. We introduce DICT, an automatic evaluation protocol that assesses tutor agents using controlled student simulation and code generation tests. Extensive experiments reveal the challenges of coding tutoring and demonstrate that TRAVER achieves a significantly higher success rate.

A critical aspect of their functionality is grounding — the ability to map linguistic intents to visual and structural interface elements. However, existing GUI agents often struggle to adapt to the dynamic and interconnected nature of real-world digital environments, where tasks frequently span multiple platforms and applications while also being impacted by version updates. To address this, we introduce TransBench, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate and enhance the transferability of GUI agents across three key dimensions: cross-version transferability (adapting to version updates), cross-platform transferability (generalizing across platforms like iOS, Android, and Web), and cross-application transferability (handling tasks spanning functionally distinct... | Yuheng Lu, Qian Yu, Hongru Wang, Zeming Liu, Wei Su, Yanping Liu, Yuhang Guo, Maocheng Liang, Yunhong Wang, Haifeng Wang |  |

An observation is that the LLMs exhibit dramatic performance fluctuation when disturbing the order of the incorporated constraints. Yet, none of the existing works has systematically investigated this position bias problem in the field of multi-constraint instruction following. To bridge this gap, we design a probing task where we quantitatively measure the difficulty distribution of the constraints by a novel Difficulty Distribution Index (CDDI). Through the experimental results, we find that LLMs are more performant when presented with the constraints in a “hard-to-easy” order. This preference can be generalized to LLMs with different architecture or different sizes of parameters. Additionally, we conduct an explanation study, providing an intuitive insight into the correlation between the LLM’s attention and constraint orders. Our code and dataset are publicly... | Jie Zeng, Qianyu He, Qingyu Ren, Jiaqing Liang, Weikang Zhou, Zeye Sun, Fei Yu, Yanghua Xiao |  |

However, current VTM methods struggle with capturing the relationship between visuals and music in open-domain settings, mainly due to two challenges: the lack of large-scale, high-quality visual-music paired datasets and the absence of direct semantic correspondence between visuals and music. In this work, we propose CoT-VTM, a framework that distills Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to enable visual-to-music generation without paired data, while efficiently producing music aligned with visual content in open-domain settings. We first bridge the gap between visual, music, and text data using appropriate foundation models. Next, we identify key elements of the visual-music relationship and design a CoT prompt for visual-to-music mapping. To fully distill the reasoning of CoT, we incorporate latent information from intermediate reasoning steps as supervisory signals alongside visual and music supervision.

While automated, reference-free evaluation models are essential given the impracticality of large-scale human assessment for lengthy texts, challenges persist in evaluating different systems on how to handle different summary granularities and evolving model generations. In this work, we conduct a systematic study on diverse factual-consistency evaluation systems across four long-document datasets, encompassing summaries generated by models from non-LLMs to proprietary LLMs. Our analysis reveals that fine-grained continuous scores can provide more reliable assessments of different evaluation systems’ capabilities than binary classification. We also examine the relationship between sentence-level and summary-level model performance, highlighting its dependency on dataset characteristics. Moreover, our study reveals that advanced systems can achieve higher recall in error... | Yang Zhong, Diane J. Litman |  |

Despite the development of sophisticated tests to reveal their new capabilities, the underlying basis of these complex skills remains unclear. We argue that complex skills might be explained using simpler ones, represented by linguistic concepts. As an initial step in exploring this hypothesis, we focus on the lexical-semantic concept of synonymy, laying the groundwork for research into its relationship with more complex skills. We develop a comprehensive test suite to assess various aspects of synonymy under different conditions, and evaluate causal open-source models ranging up to 10 billion parameters. We find that these models effectively recognize synonymy but struggle to generate synonyms when prompted with relevant context. | Ioana Ivan, Carlos Ramisch, Alexis Nasr |  |

However, current research mainly focuses on explicit toxicity, with less attention to some more implicit toxicity regarding prejudice and discrimination. To address this limitation, we introduce a subtler type of toxicity named dual-implicit toxicity and a novel toxicity benchmark termed MDIT-Bench: Multimodal Dual-Implicit Toxicity Benchmark. Specifically, we first create the MDIT-Dataset with dual-implicit toxicity using the proposed Multi-stage Human-in-loop In-context Generation method. Based on this dataset, we construct the MDIT-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating the sensitivity of models to dual-implicit toxicity, with 317,638 questions covering 12 categories, 23 subcategories, and 780 topics. MDIT-Bench includes three difficulty levels, and we propose a metric to measure the toxicity gap exhibited by the model across them. In the experiment, we conducted MDIT-Bench on 13 prominent... | Bohan Jin, Shuhan Qi, Kehai Chen, Xinyi Guo, Xuan Wang |  |

With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), researchers have begun utilizing LLMs to build more powerful recommender systems. However, existing approaches that focus on aligning LLMs with recommendation tasks do not fully leverage their sequential information processing capabilities, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a novel system called compressed vocabulary expansion (CoVE). In CoVE, each item is assigned a unique ID within the expanded vocabulary. Our framework effectively capitalizes on sequence understanding abilities of LLMs, significantly enhancing their performance on recommendation tasks. Additionally, we compress the embedding layer, making CoVE practical for large-scale industrial applications. The effectiveness and performance of CoVE are demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on multiple recommendation datasets and comparisons with prior... | Haochen Zhang, Tianyi Zhang, Junze Yin, Oren Gal, Anshumali Shrivastava, Vladimir Braverman |  |

Adaptive RAG enhances this approach by enabling dynamic retrieval during generation, activating retrieval only when the query exceeds LLM’s internal knowledge. Existing methods primarily focus on detecting LLM’s confidence via statistical uncertainty. Instead, we present the first attempts to solve adaptive RAG from a representation perspective and develop an inherent control-based framework, termed CtrlA. Specifically, we extract the features that represent the honesty and confidence directions of LLM and adopt them to control LLM behavior and guide retrieval timing decisions. We also design a simple yet effective query formulation strategy to support adaptive retrieval. Experiments show that CtrlA is superior to existing adaptive RAG methods on a diverse set of tasks. Honesty steering can effectively make LLMs more... | Huanshuo Liu, Hao Zhang, Zhijiang Guo, Jing Wang, Kuicai Dong, Xiangyang Li, Yi Quan Lee, Cong Zhang, Yong Liu |  |

Traditional MoE networks impose an expert capacity constraint to ensure GPU-friendly computation. However, this leads to token dropping when capacity is saturated and results in low hardware efficiency due to padding in underutilized experts. Removing the capacity constraint, in turn, compromises load balancing and computational efficiency.To address these issues, we propose Maximum Score Routing (\*\*MaxScore\*\*), a novel MoE routing paradigm that models routing as a minimum-cost maximum-flow problem and integrates a SoftTopk operator. MaxScore resolves the fundamental limitations of iterative rerouting and optimal transport formulations, achieving lower training losses and higher evaluation scores at equivalent FLOPs compared to both constrained... | Bowen Dong, Yilong Fan, Yutao Sun, Zhenyu Li, Tengyu Pan, Zhou Xun, Jianyong Wang |  |

In this work, we analyze the evolution of factual knowledge representation in the OLMo-7B model by tracking the roles of its Attention Heads and Feed Forward Networks (FFNs) over training. We classify these components into four roles—general, entity, relation-answer, and fact-answer specific—and examine their stability and transitions. Our results show that LLMs initially depend on broad, general-purpose components, which later specialize as training progresses. Once the model reliably predicts answers, some components are repurposed, suggesting an adaptive learning process. Notably, answer-specific attention heads display the highest turnover, whereas FFNs remain stable, continually refining stored knowledge. These insights offer a mechanistic view of knowledge formation in LLMs and have implications for model pruning,... | Ahmad Dawar Hakimi, Ali Modarressi, Philipp Wicke, Hinrich Schütze |  |

Recently, low-resource methods for LLM alignment have been popular, while still facing challenges in obtaining both high-quality and aligned content. Motivated by the observation that the difficulty of generating aligned responses is concentrated at the beginning of decoding, we propose a novel framework, Weak-to-Strong Decoding (WSD), to enhance the alignment ability of base models by the guidance of a small aligned model. The small model first drafts well-aligned beginnings, followed by the large base model to continue the rest, controlled by a well-designed auto-switch mechanism. We also collect a new dataset, GenerAlign, to fine-tune a small-sized Pilot-3B as the draft model, which effectively enhances different base models under the WSD framework to outperform all baseline methods, while avoiding degradation on downstream tasks, termed as the... | Feifan Song, Shaohang Wei, Wen Luo, Yuxuan Fan, Tianyu Liu, Guoyin Wang, Houfeng Wang |  |

We investigate this question by disentangling the textual interpretation and mathematical solving steps in word problems drawn from Brazil’s largest college entrance exam (ENEM) and GSM8K, a popular grade school-level benchmark. Using the symbolic solver SymPy, we transform word problems into equivalent purely mathematical representations, isolating equation formulation from textual comprehension. Our extended benchmarks enable a structured analysis of LLM performance across these two dimensions. Through empirical evaluations, we find that small-scale LLMs struggle significantly more with text interpretation than with equation solving, with accuracy dropping by a factor of 2 to 7 when solving full word problems compared to their math-only counterparts. Exploratory factor analysis confirms a bidimensional structure in LLM reasoning, where models exhibit distinct... | Pedro Calais, Gabriel Franco, Zilu Tang, Themistoklis Nikas, Wagner Meira Jr., Evimaria Terzi, Mark Crovella |  |

The frequency of certain other words favored by ChatGPT, such as “significant”, has instead kept increasing. These phenomena suggest that some authors of academic papers have adapted their use of large language models (LLMs), for example, by selecting outputs or applying modifications to the LLM-generated content. Such coevolution and cooperation of humans and LLMs thus introduce additional challenges to the detection of machine-generated text in real-world scenarios. Estimating the impact of LLMs on academic writing by examining word frequency remains feasible, and more attention should be paid to words that were already frequently employed, including those that have decreased in frequency due to LLMs’ disfavor. The coevolution between humans and LLMs also... | Mingmeng Geng, Roberto Trotta |  |

TKG extrapolation aims to infer possible future facts based on known history, which has garnered significant attention in recent years. Some existing methods treat TKG as a sequence of independent subgraphs to model temporal evolution patterns, demonstrating impressive reasoning performance. However, they still have limitations: 1) In modeling subgraph semantic evolution, they usually neglect the internal structural interactions between subgraphs, which are actually crucial for encoding TKGs. 2) They overlook the potential smooth features that do not lead to semantic changes, which should be distinguished from the semantic evolution process. Therefore, we propose Disentangled Multi-span Evolutionary Network (DiMNet) for TKG reasoning. Specifically, we design a multi-span evolution strategy that captures local neighbor features while perceiving... | Hao Dong, Ziyue Qiao, Zhiyuan Ning, Qi Hao, Yi Du, Pengyang Wang, Yuanchun Zhou |  |

The legal domain has received some attention from the NLP community, in part due to its textual nature. Question answering (QA) systems represent some of the tasks in this domain. This work explores the legal multiple-choice QA (MCQA) for Romanian. The contribution of this work is multi-fold. We introduce JuRO, the first openly available Romanian legal MCQA dataset, comprising 10,836 questions from three examinations. Along with this dataset, we introduce CROL, an organized corpus of laws comprising a total of 93 distinct documents with their modifications over 763 time spans, which we used for information retrieval techniques in this work. Additionally, we construct Law-RoG, the first graph of legal knowledge for the Romanian language, derived from the aforementioned corpus. Lastly, we propose a novel approach for MCQA, namely Graph... | CristianGeorge Craciun, RazvanAlexandru Smadu, DumitruClementin Cercel, MihaelaClaudia Cercel |  |

Traditional VQA benchmarks encounter a modality gap and over-reliance on language priors, whereas human cognition excels at intuitive semiosis, associating abstract visual symbols to linguistic semantics. Inspired by this neurocognitive mechanism, we focus on emojis, the visual cipher conveying abstract textual semantics. Specifically, we propose a novel task of generating abstract linguistics from emoji sequence images, where such reasoning underpins critical applications in cryptography, thus challenging MLLMs’ reasoning of decoding complex semantics of visual ciphers. We introduce eWe-bench (Express What you SeE), assessing MLLMs’ capability of intuitive semiosis like humans. Our data construction framework ensures high visual sensitivity and data quality, which can be extended to future data enhancement. Evaluation results on advanced MLLMs highlight critical deficiencies in... | Jiayi Kuang, Yinghui Li, Chen Wang, Haohao Luo, Ying Shen, Wenhao Jiang |  |

However, since job seekers apply only to a few jobs, interaction labels in resume-job datasets are sparse. We introduce ConFit v2, an improvement over ConFit to tackle this sparsity problem. We propose two techniques to enhance the encoder’s contrastive training process: augmenting job data with hypothetical reference resume generated by a large language model; and creating high-quality hard negatives from unlabeled resume/job pairs using a novel hard-negative mining strategy. This method also simplifies the representation space of the encoder. We evaluate ConFit v2 on two real-world datasets and demonstrate that it outperforms ConFit and prior methods (including BM25 and OpenAI text-embedding-003), achieving an average absolute improvement of 13.8% in recall and 17.5% in nDCG across job-ranking and... | Xiao Yu, Ruize Xu, Chengyuan Xue, Jinzhong Zhang, Xu Ma, Zhou Yu |  |

Our classifier, based on LLM representations, performs well even before a single token is generated, suggesting that crucial information about the reasoning process is already present in the initial steps representations. In contrast, a strong BERT-based baseline, which relies solely on the generated tokens, performs worse—likely because it depends on shallow linguistic cues rather than deeper reasoning dynamics. Surprisingly, using later reasoning steps does not always improve classification. When additional context is unhelpful, earlier representations resemble later ones more, suggesting LLMs encode key information early. This implies reasoning can often stop early without loss. To test this, we conduct early stopping experiments, showing that truncating CoT reasoning still improves performance over not using CoT at all, though a gap remains compared to full... | Anum Afzal, Florian Matthes, Gal Chechik, Yftah Ziser |  |

However, RGB video, the dominant medium for representing these demonstrations, often fails to capture fine-grained contextual cues such as intent, safety-critical environmental factors, and subtle preferences embedded in human behavior. This sensory gap fundamentally limits the ability of Vision Language Models (VLMs) to reason about why actions occur and how they should adapt to individual users. To address this, we introduce MICA (Multimodal Interactive Contextualized Assistance), a framework that improves conversational agents for task assistance by integrating eye gaze and speech cues. MICA segments demonstrations into meaningful sub-tasks and extracts keyframes and captions that capture fine-grained intent and user-specific cues, enabling richer contextual grounding for visual question answering. Evaluations on questions derived from real-time chat-assisted task replication show that... | Gabriel Herbert Sarch, Balasaravanan Thoravi Kumaravel, Sahithya Ravi, Vibhav Vineet, Andrew D.

For this we assess over 2,000 research works released between 2020 and 2024 based on criteria typical of what is considered good research (e.g. presence of statistical tests and reproducibility), and cross-validate it with arguments that are at the centre of controversy (e.g., claims of emergent behaviour). We find multiple trends, such as declines in ethics disclaimers, a rise of LLMs as evaluators, and an increase on claims of LLM reasoning abilities without leveraging human evaluation. We note that conference checklists are effective at curtailing some of these issues, but balancing velocity and rigour in research cannot solely rely on these. We tie all these findings to findings from recent meta-reviews and extend recommendations on how to address what does, does not, and should work in LLM research. | Adrian de Wynter |  |

Existing approaches detect noisy annotations by ranking local perplexities, presuming that noisy samples yield higher perplexities than their clean counterparts. However, this assumption breaks down when the noise ratio is high and many demonstrations are flawed.We re-examine the perplexity-based paradigm for text generation under noisy annotations, highlighting two sources of bias in perplexity: the annotation itself and the domain-specific knowledge inherent in large language models (LLMs). To overcome these biases, we introduce a dual-debiasing framework that uses synthesized neighbors to explicitly correct perplexity estimates, yielding a robust Sample Cleanliness Score. This metric uncovers absolute sample cleanliness regardless of the overall corpus noise level.Extensive experiments demonstrate our method’s superior noise-detection capabilities and show that its final ICL... | Siqi Liang, Sumyeong Ahn, Paramveer Dhillon, Jiayu Zhou |  |

However, when individuals encounter unfamiliar knowledge in texts, they often formulate questions that the text itself cannot answer due to insufficient understanding of the underlying information. Recent studies reveal that while LLMs can detect unanswerable questions, they struggle to assist users in reformulating these questions. Even advanced models like GPT-3.5 demonstrate limited effectiveness in this regard. To address this limitation, we propose DRS: Deep Question Reformulation with Structured Output, a novel zero-shot method aimed at enhancing LLMs’ ability to assist users in reformulating questions to extract relevant information from new documents. DRS combines the strengths of LLMs with a DFS-based algorithm to iteratively explore potential entity combinations and constrain outputs using predefined entities. This structured approach significantly enhances the reformulation capabilities of... | Zhecheng Li, Yiwei Wang, Bryan Hooi, Yujun Cai, Nanyun Peng, Kaiwei Chang |  |

However, these models often require substantial computational resources, which remains a major drawback. Reducing the complexity of deep learning architectures, and exploring simpler yet effective approaches can lead to cost-efficient NLP solutions. This is also a step towards explainable AI, i.e., uncovering how a particular task is carried out. For this analysis, we chose the task of hate speech detection. We address hate speech detection by introducing a model that employs a weighted sum of valence, arousal, and dominance (VAD) scores for classification. To determine the optimal weights and classification strategies, we analyze hate speech and non-hate speech words based on both their individual and summed VAD-values. Our experimental results demonstrate that this straightforward approach can compete with state-of-the-art neural network methods,... | Happy Khairunnisa Sariyanto, Diclehan Ulucan, Oguzhan Ulucan, Marc Ebner |  |

Despite the increasing prominence of large language models (LLMs), existing benchmarks lack the ability to evaluate multi-hop reasoning in the biomedical domain, particularly for queries involving one-to-many and many-to-many relationships. This gap leaves the critical challenges of biomedical multi-hop reasoning underexplored. To address this, we introduce BioHopR, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate multi-hop, multi-answer reasoning in structured biomedical knowledge graphs. Built from the comprehensive PrimeKG, BioHopR includes 1-hop and 2-hop reasoning tasks that reflect real-world biomedical complexities.Evaluations of state-of-the-art models reveal that O3-mini, a proprietary reasoning-focused model, achieves 37.93% precision on 1-hop tasks and 14.57% on 2-hop tasks, outperforming proprietary models such as GPT4O and open-source biomedical models... | Yunsoo Kim, Yusuf Abdulle, Honghan Wu |  |

However, current approaches are limited by sequential stage dependencies that prevent full hardware utilization. We present PipeSpec, a framework that generalizes speculative decoding to use multiple models arranged in a hierarchical pipeline, enabling asynchronous execution with lightweight coordination for prediction verification and rollback. Our analytical model characterizes token generation rates across pipeline stages and proves guaranteed throughput improvements over traditional decoding for any non-zero acceptance rate. We further derive closed-form expressions for steady-state verification probabilities that explain the empirical benefits of pipeline depth. We validate PipeSpec across text summarization, mathematical reasoning, and code generation tasks using LLaMA 2 and 3 models, demonstrating that pipeline efficiency... | Bradley McDanel, Sai Qian Zhang, Yunhai Hu, Zining Liu |  |

To address these issues, we present LAM SIMULATOR, a comprehensive framework designed for online exploration of agentic tasks with high-quality feedback. Our framework features a dynamic task query generator, an extensive collection of tools, and an interactive environment where Large Language Model (LLM) Agents can call tools and receive real-time feedback. This setup enables LLM Agents to explore and solve tasks autonomously, facilitating the discovery of multiple approaches to tackle any given task. The resulting action trajectory data are then used to create high-quality training datasets for LAMs. Our experiments on popular agentic benchmarks, ToolBench and CRMArena, highlight the effectiveness of LAM SIMULATOR: models trained with... | Thai Quoc Hoang, KungHsiang Huang, Shirley Kokane, Jianguo Zhang, Zuxin Liu, Ming Zhu, Jake Grigsby, Tian Lan, Michael S.

As data grows, expanding taxonomies is essential, but existing methods face key challenges: (1) discriminative models struggle with representation limits and generalization, while (2) generative methods either process all candidates at once, introducing noise and exceeding context limits, or discard relevant entities by selecting noisy candidates. We propose LORex (Lineage-Oriented Reasoning for Taxonomy Expansion), a plug-and-play framework that combines discriminative ranking and generative reasoning for efficient taxonomy expansion. Unlike prior methods, LORex ranks and chunks candidate terms into batches, filtering noise and iteratively refining selections by reasoning candidates’ hierarchy to ensure contextual efficiency. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks and twelve baselines show that LORex improves accuracy by 12% and Wu & Palmer similarity by 5% over... | Sahil Mishra, Kumar Arjun, Tanmoy Chakraborty |  |

One possible explanation for this behavior can be the degree to which these models are able to capture implicit phenomena at the phonological and subphonemic levels. We introduce a language-agnostic probing method to investigate phonological feature encoding in transformers trained directly on phonemes, and perform it across seven morphologically diverse languages. We show that phonological features which are local, such as final-obstruent devoicing in Turkish, are captured well in phoneme embeddings, whereas long-distance dependencies like vowel harmony are better represented in the transformer’s encoder. Finally, we discuss how these findings inform empirical strategies for training morphological models, particularly regarding the role of subphonemic feature acquisition. | Gal Astrach, Yuval Pinter |  |

We empirically study the ability of retrievers to satisfy malicious queries, both when used directly and when used in a retrieval augmented generation-based setup. Concretely, we investigate six leading retrievers, including NV-Embed and LLM2Vec, and find that given malicious requests, most retrievers can (for >50% of queries) select relevant harmful passages. For example, LLM2Vec correctly selects passages for 61.35% of our malicious queries. We further uncover an emerging risk with instruction-following retrievers, where highly relevant harmful information can be surfaced by exploiting their instruction-following capabilities. Finally, we show that even safety-aligned LLMs, such as Llama3, can satisfy malicious requests when provided with harmful retrieved passages in-context.

This involves identifying and removing the relevant information and then assessing whether the model’s performance on the main task changes. If the removed information is relevant, the model’s performance should decline. The difficulty with this approach lies in removing only the target information while leaving other information unchanged. It has been shown that Iterative Nullspace Projection (INLP), a widely used removal technique, introduces random modifications to representations when eliminating target information. We demonstrate that Mean Projection (MP) and LEACE, two proposed alternatives, remove information in a more targeted manner, thereby enhancing the potential for obtaining behavioural explanations through Amnesic Probing. | Alicja Dobrzeniecka, Antske Fokkens, Pia Sommerauer |  |

However, carefully crafted prompts can also manipulate model behavior. Therefore, the security risks that “prompts themselves face” and those “arising from harmful prompts” cannot be overlooked and we define the Prompt Threat (PT) issues. In this paper, we review the latest attack methods related to prompt threats, focusing on prompt leakage attacks and prompt jailbreak attacks. Additionally, we summarize the experimental setups of these methods and explore the relationship between prompt threats and prompt injection attacks. | Zixuan Xia, Haifeng Sun, Jingyu Wang, Qi Qi, Huazheng Wang, Xiaoyuan Fu, Jianxin Liao |  |

In contrast, small-scale LLMs (SLMs) are more efficient yet struggle to capture evolving real-world knowledge. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) helps by integrating external knowledge, but imperfect retrieval can introduce distracting noise that misleads SLMs. We propose RoseRAG, a robust RAG framework for SLMs via Margin-aware Preference Optimization. RoseRAG employs multi-turn prompting for detailed reasoning, rejection sampling for high-quality explanations, and contrastive preference selection to refine responses by maximizing the likelihood gap between preferred and non-preferred outputs. By integrating these components into a margin-aware optimization process, RoseRAG robustly enhances the accuracy and reliability of SLMs for RAG applications.

We conducted a series of experiments with both human-provided and machine-generated guidelines in both full- and low-data settings. Our results demonstrate the promise of annotation guidelines when there is a decent amount of training data and highlight its effectiveness in improving cross-schema generalization and low-frequency event-type performance. | Saurabh Srivastava, Sweta Pati, Ziyu Yao |  |

Multilingual Knowledge Graph Construction (mKGC) refers to the task of automatically constructing or predicting missing entities and links for knowledge graphs in a multilingual setting. In this work, we reformulate the mKGC task as a Question Answering (QA) task and introduce mRAKL: a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based system to perform mKGC. We achieve this by using the head entity and linking relation in a question, and having our model predict the tail entity as an answer. Our experiments focus primarily on two low-resourced languages: Tigrinya and Amharic. We experiment with using higher-resourced languages, Arabic and English, to utilize cross-lingual transfer for mKGC. With a BM25 retriever, we find that the RAG-based approach improves performance over a no-context setting. Further, our ablation studies show that with an idealized retrieval system, mRAKL improves accuracy by up to 4.92... | Hellina Hailu Nigatu, Min Li, Maartje ter Hoeve, Saloni Potdar, Sarah E.

However, the mechanisms through which these models process emotional stimuli remain largely unexplored. Our study addresses this gap by investigating how autoregressive LLMs infer emotions, showing that emotion representations are functionally localized to specific regions in the model. Our evaluation includes diverse model families and sizes, and is supported by robustness checks. We then show that the identified representations are psychologically plausible by drawing on cognitive appraisal theory—a well-established psychological framework positing that emotions emerge from evaluations (appraisals) of environmental stimuli. By causally intervening on construed appraisal concepts, we steer the generation and show that the outputs align with theoretical and intuitive expectations.

Traditional drug editing relies on iterative conversations with domain experts, refining the drug until the desired property is achieved. This interactive and iterative process mirrors the strengths of LLMs, making them well-suited for drug editing. \*In existing works, LLMs edit each molecule independently without leveraging knowledge from past edits.\* However, human experts develop intuition about effective modifications over time through historical experience; accumulating past knowledge is pivotal for human experts, and so it is for LLMs. \*In this work, we propose RL-Guider — a reinforcement-learning agent to provide suggestions to LLMs; it uses the rich information provided from evaluating editing results made by the LLM based on the recommendations to improve itself over time.\* RL-Guider is the first work that leverages both... | Xufeng Liu, Yixuan Ding, Jingxiang Qu, Yichi Zhang, Wenhan Gao, Yi Liu |  |

This requires not only a thorough understanding of the law of a jurisdiction, from judgments to statutes, but also the ability to make new arguments to try to expand the law in a new direction and make novel and creative arguments that are persuasive to judges. To capture and evaluate these legal skills in language models, we introduce BRIEFME, a new dataset focused on legal briefs. It contains three tasks for language models to assist legal professionals in writing briefs: argument summarization, argument completion, and case retrieval. In this work, we describe the creation of these tasks, analyze them, and show how current models perform. We see that today’s large language models (LLMs) are already quite good at the summarization and guided completion tasks, even beating human-generated headings. Yet, they perform poorly on other tasks in our benchmark: realistic argument... | Jesse Woo, Fateme Hashemi Chaleshtori, Ana Marasovic, Kenneth Marino |  |

However, how representational co-speech gestures refer to objects remains understudied from a computational perspective. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a multimodal reference resolution task centred on representational gestures, while simultaneously tackling the challenge of learning robust gesture embeddings. We propose a self-supervised pre-training approach to gesture representation learning that grounds body movements in spoken language. Our experiments show that the learned embeddings align with expert annotations and have significant predictive power. Moreover, reference resolution accuracy further improves when (1) using multimodal gesture representations, even when speech is unavailable at inference time, and (2) leveraging dialogue history. Overall, our findings highlight the complementary roles of gesture and... | Esam Ghaleb, Bulat Khaertdinov, Asli Özyürek, Raquel Fernández |  |

However, a recent study by Pruś et al. (2024) has shown that non-experts’ annotations of the aspectual class of English verb phrases can disagree with both expert linguistic annotations and each another. They hypothesised that people use their world knowledge to tacitly conjure their own contexts, leading to disagreement between them. In this paper, we test that hypothesis by adding context to Pruś et al.’s examples and mirroring their experiment. Our results show that whilst their hypothesis explains some of the disagreement, some examples continue to yield divided responses even with the additional context. Finally, we show that outputs from GPT-4, despite to some degree capturing the aspectual class division, are not an accurate predictor of human answers. | Katarzyna Prus, Mark Steedman, Adam Lopez |  |

However, LLMs must consider the sensitivity of information when communicating with employees, especially given access restrictions. Simple filtering based on user clearance levels can pose both performance and privacy challenges. To address this, we propose the concept of sensitivity awareness (SA), which enables LLMs to adhere to predefined access rights rules. In addition, we developed a benchmarking environment called ACCESS DENIED INC to evaluate SA. Our experimental findings reveal significant variations in model behavior, particularly in managing unauthorized data requests while effectively addressing legitimate queries. This work establishes a foundation for benchmarking sensitivity-aware language models and provides insights to enhance privacy-centric AI... | Dren Fazlija, Arkadij Orlov, Sandipan Sikdar |  |

Recent studies leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract cell states by translating gene or protein expression into biological context. However, existing single-cell LLMs face two major challenges: (1) Integration of spatial information—they struggle to generalize spatial coordinates and effectively encode spatial context as text, and (2) Treating each cell independently—they overlook cell-cell interactions, limiting their ability to capture biological relationships. To address these limitations, we propose Spatial2Sentence, a novel framework that integrates both single-cell expression and spatial information into natural language using a multi-sentence approach. Given an expression matrix and spatial coordinates, Spatial2Sentence constructs expression similarity and distance matrices, pairing spatially adjacent and... | ChiJane Chen, Yuhang Chen, Sukwon Yun, Natalie Stanley, Tianlong Chen |  |

This task involves providing LLMs with a base problem alongside a related, more complex problem. The models must solve the base problem and leverage its solution to address the more complex one, thereby showcasing their capacity for progressive reasoning and problem-solving. This work features three key contributions. First, we propose a general recipe for generating more challenging versions of existing benchmarks. Second, from the analysis of experimental results over twenty large language models (LLM) on our benchmarks, we have two important observations: (i) Most LLMs excel in traditional code generation benchmarks like HumanEval and MBPP, but their performance declines on self-invoking tasks. For example, o1-mini achieves 96.2% pass@1 on HumanEval but only 76.2% on HumanEval Pro. (ii) On self-invoking code generation task, the instruction-tuned... | Zhaojian Yu, Yilun Zhao, Arman Cohan, Xiaoping Zhang |  |

However, existing SVS models overly depend on phoneme and note boundary annotations, limiting their robustness in zero-shot scenarios and producing poor transitions between phonemes and notes. Moreover, they also lack effective multi-level style control via diverse prompts. To overcome these challenges, we introduce TCSinger 2, a multi-task multilingual zero-shot SVS model with style transfer and style control based on various prompts. TCSinger 2 mainly includes three key modules: 1) Blurred Boundary Content (BBC) Encoder, predicts duration, extends content embedding, and applies masking to the boundaries to enable smooth transitions. 2) Custom Audio Encoder, uses contrastive learning to extract aligned representations from singing, speech, and textual prompts. 3) Flow-based Custom Transformer, leverages Cus-MOE, with F0 supervision,... | Yu Zhang, Wenxiang Guo, Changhao Pan, Dongyu Yao, Zhiyuan Zhu, Ziyue Jiang, Yuhan Wang, Tao Jin, Zhou Zhao |  |

In this work, we ask whether compute-optimal scaling behaviour can be skill-dependent. In particular, we examine knowledge and reasoning-based skills such as knowledge-based QA and code generation, and we answer this question in the affirmative: scaling laws are skill-dependent. Next, to understand whether skill-dependent scaling is an artefact of the pretraining datamix, we conduct an extensive ablation of different datamixes and find that, also when correcting for datamix differences, knowledge and code exhibit fundamental differences in scaling behaviour. We conclude with an analysis of how our findings relate to standard compute-optimal scaling using a validation set, and find that a misspecified validation set can impact... | Nicholas Roberts, Niladri S.

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable entire documents to be processed in a single pass. However, their computational cost is significantly high. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods split text into smaller chunks, but they often yield inferior results and may lose global context. Recent approaches that integrate LLMs into RAG via iterative summarization either underutilize LLM capabilities or still incur high computational costs. In this paper, we combine the high accuracy of LLMs with the efficiency of RAG and propose LLM-Guided Dynamic Progress Control with Attention-Based Hierarchical Weighted Graph (PECAN). Our method introduces two key improvements: (1) LLM-Guided Dynamic Progress Control: We leverage LLMs to dynamically control the retrieval process, adjusting the amount of retrieved information based on different queries to achieve a better balance of... | Xinyu Wang, Yanzheng Xiang, Lin Gui, Yulan He |  |

Although post-training model editing offers a pathway for dynamic updates, existing methods frequently suffer from overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework that leverages hyperbolic geometry and graph neural networks for precise and stable model edits. We introduce HYPE, (HYperbolic Parameter Editing), which comprises three key components: (i) Hyperbolic Graph Construction, which uses Poincaré embeddings to represent knowledge triples in hyperbolic space, preserving hierarchical relationships and preventing unintended side effects by ensuring that edits to parent concepts do not inadvertently affect child concepts; (ii) Möbius-Transformed Updates, which apply hyperbolic addition to propagate edits while maintaining structural... | Yash Kumar Atri, Ahmed M.

Nonetheless, words and tokens typically have a limited number of senses (or meanings). We propose multi-sense embeddings as a drop-in replacement for each token in order to capture the range of their uses in a language. To construct a sense embedding dictionary, we apply a clustering algorithm to embeddings generated by an LLM and consider the cluster centers as representative sense embeddings. In addition, we propose a novel knowledge distillation method that leverages the sense dictionary to learn a smaller student model that mimics the senses from the much larger base LLM model, offering significant space and inference time savings, while maintaining competitive performance. Via thorough experiments on various benchmarks, we showcase the effectiveness of our sense embeddings and knowledge... | Qitong Wang, Mohammed J. Zaki, Georgios Kollias, Vasileios Kalantzis |  |

In this work we introduce CodeScientist, a novel ASD system that frames ideation and experiment construction as a form of genetic search jointly over combinations of research articles and codeblocks defining common actions in a domain (like prompting a language model). We use this paradigm to conduct hundreds of automated experiments on machine-generated ideas broadly in the domain of agents and virtual environments, with the system returning 19 discoveries, 6 of which were judged as being both at least minimally sound... | Peter Jansen, Oyvind Tafjord, Marissa Radensky, Pao Siangliulue, Tom Hope, Bhavana Dalvi Mishra, Bodhisattwa Prasad Majumder, Daniel S.

ICAT breaks down a long output text into a list of atomic claims and not only verifies each claim through retrieval from a (reliable) knowledge source, but also computes the alignment between the atomic factual claims and various aspects expected to be presented in the output. We study three implementations of the ICAT framework, each with a different assumption on the availability of aspects and alignment method. By adopting data from the diversification task in the TREC Web Track and the ClueWeb corpus, we evaluate the ICAT framework. We demonstrate strong correlation with human judgments and provide comprehensive evaluation across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. Our framework further offers interpretable and fine-grained analysis of diversity and coverage. Its modular design allows for easy adaptation to different domains and datasets, making it a... | Chris Samarinas, Alexander Krubner, Alireza Salemi, Youngwoo Kim, Hamed Zamani |  |

Quantization, a technique that reduces the precision of model parameters, offers a promising solution for improving LLM efficiency and sustainability. While post-training quantization methods typically achieve 4-8 bits per parameter, recent research suggests that training LLMs with 1.58 bits per weight parameter from scratch can maintain model accuracy while greatly reducing memory requirements and energy consumption at inference time. Here, we investigate a training strategy for quantization-aware pre-training, where the models are first trained with 16-bit precision and then transition into 1.58-bit quantization-aware training. Our results on 11 downstream tasks, show that this 16-to-1.58-bit training strategy is preferable over full 1.58-bit training and leaves models closer to those which have undergone 16-bit training. We further investigate the effects of retaining the optimizer state at the... | Jacob Nielsen, Peter SchneiderKamp, Lukas Galke |  |

It is nonetheless important to tackle this problem, as social media represents a significant attack vector in online influence campaigns, which may be bolstered through the use of mass-produced AI-generated posts supporting (or opposing) particular policies, decisions, or events. We approach this problem with the mindset and resources of a reasonably sophisticated threat actor, and create a dataset of 505,159 AI-generated social media posts from a combination of open-source, closed-source, and fine-tuned LLMs, covering 11 different controversial topics. We show that while the posts can be detected under typical research assumptions about knowledge of and access to the generating models, under the more realistic assumption that an attacker will not release their... | Hillary Dawkins, Kathleen C.

By teasing apart possibility, typicality, and contextual relatedness, we show that despite the results of previous work, language models’ ability to do this is far from robust. In fact, under certain conditions, all models tested—including Llama 3, Gemma 2, and Mistral NeMo—perform at worse-than-chance level, assigning higher probabilities to impossible sentences such as ‘the car was given a parking ticket by the brake’ than to merely unlikely sentences such as ‘the car was given a parking ticket by the explorer’. | James A.

It rotates dimensions in the query and the key vectors by different angles according to their positions in the input sequence. For long context modeling, the range of positions may vary a lot, and thus RoPE rotates some dimensions by a great range of angles. We hypothesize that the wide range of rotation angles may prevent LLMs from utilizing those dimensions. To validate this hypothesis, we present a controlled experiment showing that applying RoPE causes low utility of certain dimensions. Our analyses on three LLMs also indicate that these dimensions do not help LLMs do long-context question answering. | TingRui Chiang, Dani Yogatama |  |

We introduce RULEARN, a novel benchmark to assess the rule-learning abilities of LLM agents in interactive settings. In RULEARN, agents strategically interact with simulated environments to gather observations, discern patterns, and solve complex problems. To enhance the rule-learning capabilities for LLM agents, we propose IDEA, a novel reasoning framework that integrates the process of \*\*I\*\*nduction, \*\*De\*\*duction, and \*\*A\*\*bduction. The IDEA agent generates initial hypotheses from limited observations through abduction, devises plans to validate these hypotheses or leverages them to solve problems via deduction, and refines previous hypotheses through induction, dynamically establishing and applying rules that mimic human rule-learning behaviors. Our evaluation of the IDEA... | Kaiyu He, Mian Zhang, Shuo Yan, Peilin Wu, Zhiyu Chen |  |

While existing ToM reasoning methods show promise with reasoning via perceptual perspective-taking, they often rely excessively on off-the-shelf LLMs, reducing their efficiency and limiting their applicability to high-order ToM reasoning. To address these issues, we present EnigmaToM, a novel neuro-symbolic framework that enhances ToM reasoning by integrating a Neural Knowledge Base of entity states (Enigma) for (1) a psychology-inspired iterative masking mechanism that facilitates accurate perspective-taking and (2) knowledge injection that elicits key entity information. Enigma generates structured knowledge of entity states to build spatial scene graphs for belief tracking across various ToM orders and enrich events with fine-grained entity state details.

We introduce a ground-truth-free evaluation framework focused on reasoning consistency and instruction following, shifting the emphasis from correctness—which is elusive without labels—to transparent, coherent, evidence-based reasoning. Each model response must include a direct answer, a structured multi-step explanation, and supporting evidence, all assessed via semantic similarity and output adherence checks. We further propose TopK-ReRank, which refines rankings by constructing a consensus answer from the most reliable models, reducing ambiguity across diverse reasoning styles. Experiments show that our framework outperforms existing label-free methods, including majority voting, triplet ranking, and peer-review approaches, providing a more interpretable and efficient... | Jiamu Zhang, Jiayi Yuan, Andrew Wen, Hoang Anh Duy Le, YuNeng Chuang, SooHyun Choi, Rui Chen, Xia Hu |  |

Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across domains, their ability to infer and generate grammars has not yet been thoroughly explored. In this paper, we aim to study and improve the ability of LLMs for few-shot grammar generation, where grammars are inferred from sets of a small number of positive and negative examples and generated in Backus-Naur Form. To explore this, we introduced a novel dataset comprising 540 structured grammar generation challenges, devised 6 metrics, and evaluated 8 various LLMs against it. Our findings reveal that existing LLMs perform sub-optimally in grammar generation. To address this, we propose an LLM-driven hybrid genetic algorithm, namely HyGenar, to optimize grammar generation. HyGenar achieves substantial improvements in both the... | Weizhi Tang, Yixuan Li, Chris Sypherd, Elizabeth Polgreen, Vaishak Belle |  |

However, despite their usefulness, argument scheme classification, that is classifying natural language arguments according to the schemes they are instances of, is an under-explored task in NLP. In this paper we present a systematic evaluation of large language models (LLMs) for classifying argument schemes based on Walton’s taxonomy. We experiment with seven LLMs in zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting, and explore two strategies to enhance task instructions: employing formal definitions and LLM-generated descriptions. Our analysis on both manually annotated and automatically generated arguments, including enthymemes, indicates that while larger models exhibit satisfactory performance in identifying argument schemes, challenges remain for smaller models. Our work offers the first comprehensive assessment of LLMs in identifying argument schemes, and provides insights for... | Elfia BezouVrakatseli, Oana Cocarascu, Sanjay Modgil |  |

Existing guardrails rely on rule-based filtering or single-pass classification, limiting their ability to handle nuanced safety violations. To address this, we propose ThinkGuard, a critique-augmented guardrail model that distills knowledge from high-capacity LLMs by generating structured critiques alongside safety labels. Fine-tuned on critique-augmented data, the captured deliberative thinking ability drastically enhances the guardrail’s cautiousness and interpretability. Evaluated on multiple safety benchmarks, ThinkGuard achieves the highest average F1 and AUPRC, outperforming all baselines. Compared to LLaMA Guard 3, ThinkGuard improves accuracy by 16.1% and macro F1 by 27.0%. Moreover, it surpasses label-only fine-tuned models, confirming that structured critiques enhance both classification precision and nuanced safety reasoning while maintaining computational... | Xiaofei Wen, Wenxuan Zhou, Wenjie Jacky Mo, Muhao Chen |  |

However, recent works show that LLMs still suffer from hallucinations in NLI due to attestation bias, where LLMs overly rely on propositional memory to build shortcuts. To solve the issue, we design an unsupervised framework to construct counterfactual reasoning data and fine-tune LLMs to reduce attestation bias. To measure bias reduction, we build bias-adversarial variants of NLI datasets with randomly replaced predicates in premises while keeping hypotheses unchanged. Extensive evaluations show that our framework can significantly reduce hallucinations from attestation bias. Then, we further evaluate LLMs fine-tuned with our framework on original NLI datasets and their bias-neutralized versions, where original entities are replaced with randomly sampled ones. Extensive results show that our framework consistently improves inferential... | Liang Cheng, Tianyi Li, Zhaowei Wang, Tianyang Liu, Mark Steedman |  |

Traditional ICL embeds examples within the prompt, while activation steering, uses a vector derived from examples to guide the latent states of LLMs toward desired behaviors. However, traditional ICL is difficult to control quantitatively and consumes valuable context space. Existing activation steering methods apply a single sentence-level steering vector uniformly across all tokens, ignoring LLMs’ token-wise, auto-regressive nature. This coarse control can lead to inconsistencies and suboptimal adjustments during generation. To address this problem, we introduce Dynamic Steering with Episodic Memory (DSEM), a novel training-free framework that aligns LLMs to given demonstrations by steering at the token level conditioned on the input query. DSEM employs a key-value memory to store associations between generated tokens and... | Van Dai Do, Quan Hung Tran, Svetha Venkatesh, Hung Le |  |

We introduce Eeyore , an 8B model optimized for realistic depression simulation through a structured alignment framework, incorporating expert input at every stage.First, we systematically curate real-world depression-related conversations, extracting depressive traits to guide data filtering and psychological profile construction, and use this dataset to instruction-tune Eeyore for profile adherence. Next, to further enhance realism, Eeyore undergoes iterative preference optimization—first leveraging model-generated preferences and then calibrating with a small set of expert-annotated preferences.Throughout the entire pipeline, we actively collaborate with domain experts, developing interactive interfaces to validate trait extraction and iteratively refine... | Siyang Liu, Bianca Brie, Wenda Li, Laura Biester, Andrew Lee, James W.

As a result, text produced by people with dyslexia often differs from the text typically used to train natural language processing (NLP) models, raising concerns about their effectiveness for dyslexic users. This paper examines the fairness of four commercial machine translation (MT) systems towards dyslexic text through a systematic audit using both synthetically generated dyslexic text and real writing from individuals with dyslexia. By programmatically introducing various dyslexic-style errors into the WMT dataset, we present insights on how dyslexic biases manifest in MT systems as the text becomes more dyslexic, especially with real-word errors. Our results shed light on the NLP biases affecting people with dyslexia – a population that often relies on NLP tools as assistive technologies, highlighting the need for more diverse data and user representation in the development of... | Gregory Price, Shaomei Wu |  |

Existing research enhances open-source LLMs using closed-source guidance (e.g., GPT-4), but this heavily relies on generated data quality. An alternative is leveraging LLMs’ self-correction to refine responses for better constraint adherence. However, this is limited by the feedback quality, as we found LLMs cannot generate reliable feedback or detect errors. Moreover, the self-correction effectiveness relies on few-shot examples illustrating response modifications. As constraints in complex instructions are diverse, manually crafting such examples for each constraint type can be labor-intensive and sub-optimal. To address these two challenges, we propose the Divide-Verify-Refine (DVR) framework with three steps: (1) Divide complex instructions into single constraints and prepare appropriate tools; (2) Verify responses using tools that provide rigorous check... | Xianren Zhang, Xianfeng Tang, Hui Liu, Zongyu Wu, Qi He, Dongwon Lee, Suhang Wang |  |

Unlike traditional language models that require explicit user invocation, this assistant operates in the background, anticipating user needs without interrupting conversations. We address several challenges, including determining when to respond, crafting concise responses that enhance conversations, leveraging knowledge of the user for context-aware assistance, and real-time, on-device processing. To achieve this, we construct a semi-synthetic dialogue dataset and propose a two-model pipeline: a small model that decides when to respond and a larger model that generates the response. We evaluate our approach on real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in providing helpful, unobtrusive assistance. User studies with our assistant, implemented on Apple Silicon M2 hardware, show a strong preference for the... | Tuochao Chen, Nicholas Scott Batchelder, Alisa Liu, Noah A.

To support this, we introduce a pilot dataset of real-world claims extracted from PolitiFact, specifically annotated for large-scale structured data. This dataset underpins two case studies: the first investigates voting-related claims using the Vote semantic frame, while the second explores various semantic frames based on data sources from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of frame semantics in improving evidence retrieval and explainability for fact-checking. Finally, we conducted a survey of frames evoked in fact-checked claims, identifying high-impact frames to guide future work in this direction. | Jacob Daniel Devasier, Akshith Reddy Putta, Rishabh Mediratta, Chengkai Li |  |

This paper presents Craw4LLM, an efficient web crawling method that explores the web graph based on the preference of LLM pretraining. Specifically, it leverages the influence of a webpage in LLM pretraining as the priority score of the web crawler’s scheduler, replacing the standard graph-connectivity-based priority. Our experiments on a web graph containing 900 million webpages from a commercial search engine’s index demonstrate the efficiency of Craw4LLM in obtaining high-quality pretraining data. With just 21% URLs crawled, LLMs pretrained on Craw4LLM data reach the same downstream performances of previous crawls, significantly reducing the crawling waste and alleviating the burdens on websites.

This paper highlights an overlooked privacy risk: \*an unsafe model could compromise the privacy of other LLMs involved in the model merging\*. Specifically, we propose \*PhiMM\*, a privacy attack approach that trains a phishing model capable of stealing privacy using a crafted privacy phishing instruction dataset. Furthermore, we introduce a novel model cloaking method that mimics a specialized capability to conceal attack intent, luring users into merging the phishing model. Once victims merge the phishing model, the attacker can extract personally identifiable information (PII) or infer membership information (MI) by... | Zhenyuan Guo, Yi Shi, Wenlong Meng, Chen Gong, Chengkun Wei, Wenzhi Chen |  |

Every evaluation tells a story, but what do users really think about current LLMs? This paper presents CLUE, an LLM-powered interviewer that conducts in-the-moment user experience interviews, right after users interact with LLMs, and automatically gathers insights about user opinions from massive interview logs. We conduct a study with thousands of users to understand user opinions on mainstream LLMs, recruiting users to first chat with a target LLM and then be interviewed by CLUE. Our experiments demonstrate that CLUE captures interesting user opinions, e.g., the bipolar views on the displayed reasoning process of DeepSeek-R1 and demands for information freshness and multi-modality.

To address these issues, we introduce HiCOT (Hierarchical Clustering and Contrastive Learning with Optimal Transport for Neural Topic Modeling), a novel framework that enhances topic coherence and efficiency. HiCOT integrates Optimal Transport to refine document-topic relationships using compact PLM-based embeddings, captures semantic structure of the documents. Additionally, it employs hierarchical clustering combine with contrastive learning to disentangle topic-word and topic-topic relationships, ensuring clearer structure and better coherence. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate HiCOT’s superior effectiveness over existing NTMs in topic coherence, topic performance, representation quality, and... | Hoang Tran Vuong, Tue Le, Tu Vu, Tung Nguyen, Linh Ngo Van, Sang Dinh, Thien Huu Nguyen |  |

However, they often struggle with multi-step, goal-oriented scenarios in interactive financial markets, such as trading, where complex agentic approaches are required to improve decision-making. To address this, we propose FLAG-Trader, a unified architecture integrating linguistic processing (via LLMs) with gradient-driven reinforcement learning (RL) policy optimization, in which a partially fine-tuned LLM acts as the policy network, leveraging pre-trained knowledge while adapting to the financial domain through parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Through policy gradient optimization driven by trading rewards, our framework not only enhances LLM performance in trading but also improves results on other financial-domain tasks. We present extensive empirical evidence to validate these enhancements. | Guojun Xiong, Zhiyang Deng, Keyi Wang, Yupeng Cao, Haohang Li, Yangyang Yu, Xueqing Peng, Mingquan Lin, Kaleb E.

We focus on generating human-imperceptible adversarial examples and introduce a novel imperceptible retrieve-to-generate attack against RAG. This task aims to find imperceptible perturbations that retrieve a target document, originally excluded from the initial top-k candidate set, in order to influence the final answer generation. To address this task, we propose ReGENT, a reinforcement learning-based framework that tracks interactions between the attacker and the target RAG and continuously refines attack strategies based on relevance-generation-naturalness rewards. Experiments on newly constructed factual and non-factual question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that ReGENT significantly outperforms existing attack methods in misleading RAG systems with small imperceptible text perturbations. | Hongru Song, YuAn Liu, Ruqing Zhang, Jiafeng Guo, Jianming Lv, Maarten de Rijke, Xueqi Cheng |  |

However, they struggle with producing structured output while maintaining accuracy in zero-shot information extraction (IE), such as named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE). To address these challenges, we propose CROSSAGENTIE, a multi-agent framework that enhances zero-shot IE through multi-agent LLM collaboration. CROSSAGENTIE refines LLM predictions iteratively through two mechanisms: intra-group cross-type debate, which resolves entity-label conflicts through context-based evidence and confidence aggregation, and inter-group cross-task debate, where NER and RE mutually refine outputs via bidirectional feedback. Furthermore, we introduce template fine-tuning, distilling high-confidence multi-agent outputs into a single model, significantly reducing inference cost while preserving accuracy. Experiments across five NER and five RE datasets show that CROSSAGENTIE significantly outperforms... | Meng Lu, Yuzhang Xie, Zhenyu Bi, Shuxiang Cao, Xuan Wang |  |

However, existing MU methods, which require tuning the entire model parameters on the unlearned data with random labels or perturbed gradients, significantly degrade model utility, especially given the difficulty of accessing the original training data. This presents a key challenge: how can we achieve MU using only the unlearned data while preserving model utility?In this paper, we propose NeuMuter, a simple but effective MU method that eliminates the influence of unlearned data from LLMs by modulating the outputs of merely 1% of the neurons in the feed-forward network (FFN) modules within the Transformer blocks, minimizing disruption to the model’s performance. We design a trainable masking scheme that decouples the memorization of different training data within the neurons of LLMs, allowing us to precisely identify and... | Lishuai Hou, Zixiong Wang, Gaoyang Liu, Chen Wang, Wei Liu, Kai Peng |  |

Learning from experience, the ability to derive reusable patterns from past tasks, is crucial for improving generalization. However, existing methods focus on summarizing workflows, i.e., common sub-routines, which may introduce excessive low-level details that distract models. Additionally, the absence of task-specific objectives can lead to inconsistencies between workflows and future task queries, hindering reasoning performance. This paper seeks to mitigate these issues by proposing A2, a framework that derives task-adaptive hierarchical abstraction to enhance web task reasoning. Our approach first extracts general-purpose semantic abstraction from past task-solution pairs. Combined with the next task query, this abstraction forms a task-adaptive episodic abstraction that guides subsequent reasoning. Experiments show that A2 achieves... | Xinyu Pang, Ruixin Hong, Hongming Zhang, Changshui Zhang |  |

However, there is still a lack of definitive standards for evaluating their safety due to the subjective nature of current safety benchmarks. To address this gap, we conducted the first exploration of LLMs’ safety evaluation from a legal perspective by proposing the SafeLawBench benchmark. SafeLawBench categorizes safety risks into three levels based on legal standards, providing a systematic and comprehensive framework for evaluation. It comprises 24,860 multi-choice questions and 1,106 open-domain question-answering (QA) tasks. Our evaluation included 2 closed-source LLMs and 18 open-source LLMs using zero-shot and few-shot prompting, highlighting the safety features of each model. We also evaluated the LLMs’ safety-related reasoning stability and refusal behavior. Additionally, we found that a majority voting mechanism can enhance model performance.

Traditional debiasing methods face a trade-off between the need for extensive labeled datasets and high computational costs. Model merging, which efficiently combines multiple models into a single one, offers a promising alternative but its usage is limited to MLLMs with the same architecture. We propose 3DM, a novel framework integrating Distill, Dynamic Drop, and Merge to address these challenges. 3DM employs knowledge distillation to harmonize models with divergent architectures and introduces a dynamic dropping strategy that assigns parameter-specific drop rates based on their contributions to bias and overall performance. This approach preserves critical weights while mitigating biases, as validated on the MMSD2.0 sarcasm detection dataset.

Encouraging LLMs to abstain when faced with knowledge gaps is a promising strategy to reduce hallucinations in multilingual settings. Current abstention strategies for multilingual scenarios primarily rely on generating feedback in various languages using LLMs and performing self-reflection. However, these methods can be adversely impacted by inaccuracies and biases in the generated feedback. To address this, from a causal perspective, we introduce CausalAbstain, a method that helps LLMs determine whether to utilize multiple generated feedback responses and how to identify the most useful ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CausalAbstain effectively selects helpful feedback and enhances abstention decisions with interpretability in both native language (Casual-native) and multilingual (Causal-multi) settings, outperforming strong baselines on two benchmark datasets covering encyclopedic and... | Yuxi Sun, Aoqi Zuo, Wei Gao, Jing Ma |  |

With the rise of LLMs, modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) generate detailed and comprehensive image descriptions. However, benchmarking the quality of such captions remains unresolved. This paper addresses two key questions: (1) How well do VLMs actually perform on image captioning, particularly compared to humans? We built CapArena, a platform with over 6000 pairwise caption battles and high-quality human preference votes. Our Arena-style evaluation marks a milestone, showing that leading models like GPT-4o achieve or even surpass human performance, while most open-source models lag behind. (2) Can automated metrics reliably assess caption quality? Using human annotations from CapArena, we evaluate traditional and recent captioning metrics, as well as VLM-as-a-Judge. Our analysis reveals that while some metrics (e.g., METEOR) show high caption-level agreement with humans, their systematic biases lead to... | Kanzhi Cheng, Wenpo Song, Jiaxin Fan, Zheng Ma, Qiushi Sun, Fangzhi Xu, Chenyang Yan, Nuo Chen, Jianbing Zhang, Jiajun Chen |  |

These online activities raise significant social concerns that require immediate actions. Existing approaches to combat this challenge are generally impractical due to the scarcity of labeled samples and imbalance of classes in real-world applications. To this end, we propose a novel Large Language Model-empowered Heterogeneous Graph Prompt Learning framework for illicit Drug Trafficking detection, called LLM-HetGDT that leverages LLM to facilitate heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) to effectively identify minority classes, i.e., drug trafficking participants, in the class-imbalanced scenarios. Specifically, we first pre-train HGNN over a contrastive pretext task to capture the inherent node and structure information over an unlabeled drug trafficking heterogeneous graph (HG). Afterward, to alleviate the... | Tianyi Ma, Yiyue Qian, Zehong Wang, Zheyuan Zhang, Chuxu Zhang, Yanfang Ye |  |

While training LLMs from scratch is resource-intensive, fine-tuning a pre-trained model for specific tasks has become a practical alternative. Full fine-tuning (FFT) achieves strong performance; however, it is computationally expensive and inefficient. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, like LoRA, have been proposed to address these challenges by freezing the pre-trained model and adding lightweight task-specific modules. LoRA, in particular, has proven effective, but its application to multi-task scenarios is limited by interference between tasks. Recent approaches, such as Mixture-of-Experts (MOE) and asymmetric LoRA, have aimed to mitigate these issues but still struggle with sample scarcity and noise interference due to their fixed structure. In response, we propose CoLA, a more flexible LoRA architecture with an... | Yiyun Zhou, Chang Yao, Jingyuan Chen |  |

However, as the number and complexity of entities and entity-pair relations grow, the problem space expands quadratically, causing incomplete annotations and frequent false negatives, especially in biomedical datasets due to high construction costs. This leads to low recall in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose GLiM, a novel framework that reduces the problem space using a graph-enhanced Transformer-based model and leverages large language models (LLMs) for reasoning. GLiM employs a cascaded approach: first, a graph-enhanced Transformer processes entity-pair relations with finer granularity by dynamically adjusting the graph size based on the number of entities; then, LLM inference handles challenging cases. Experiments show that GLiM boosts average recall and F1 scores by +6.34 and +4.41, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art models on biomedical... | Hao Fang, Yuejie Zhang, Rui Feng, Yingwen Wang, Qing Wang, Wen He, Xiaobo Zhang, Tao Zhang, Shang Gao |  |

However, a major problem is catastrophic forgetting, where models lose their ability to recognize earlier keywords. Although several continual learning methods have proven their usefulness for reducing forgetting, most existing approaches depend on storing and revisiting old data to combat catastrophic forgetting. Though effective, these methods face two practical challenges: 1) privacy risks from keeping user data and 2) large memory and time consumption that limit deployment on small devices. To address these issues, we propose an exemplar-free Analytic Continual Learning (AnalyticKWS) method that updates model parameters without revisiting earlier data. Inspired by efficient learning principles, AnalyticKWS computes a closed-form analytical solution for model updates and requires only a... | Yang Xiao, Tianyi Peng, Rohan Kumar Das, Yuchen Hu, Huiping Zhuang |  |

The synthetic users are grounded in health and lifestyle conditions, specifically sleep and diabetes management in this study, to ensure realistic interactions with the health coaching agent. Synthetic users are created in two stages: first, structured data are generated grounded in real-world health and lifestyle factors in addition to basic demographics and behavioral attributes; second, full profiles of the synthetic users are developed conditioned on the structured data. Interactions between synthetic users and the coaching agent are simulated using generative agent-based models such as Concordia, or directly by prompting a language model.

To address these issues, we propose Imagine to Hear, a novel approach that dynamically generates auditory knowledge using generative models. Our framework detects multiple audio-related textual spans from the given prompt and generates corresponding auditory knowledge.

While this approach is robust for language generation tasks such as writing and summarization, it has limitations for high-level reasoning tasks, such as prediction and decision-making. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a new method called Prediction-Augmented Generation (PAG). PAG can improve the generation quality and predictive accuracy of large language models in inference-driven tasks by integrating task-specific predictive models as external tools, enabling more structured and precise reasoning. Moreover, our method does not simply copy the inferences of a predictive model, but improves the inference results with knowledge from the large language model to create better predictions. We comprehensively evaluate our proposed method on diverse datasets for automatic diagnosis tasks requiring extensive domain knowledge and advanced reasoning. | ChanYang Ju, DongHo Lee |  |

However, existing methods assume a single-user setting and become inefficient in real-world multi-client scenarios, where decentralized organizations (e.g., hospitals, financial institutions) independently update overlapping knowledge, leading to redundant mediator knowledge vector (MKV) computations and privacy concerns.To address these challenges, we introduce Federated Locate-then-Edit Knowledge Editing (FedLEKE), a novel task that enables multiple clients to collaboratively perform LEKE while preserving privacy and reducing computational overhead. To achieve this, we propose FedEdit, a two-stage framework that optimizes MKV selection and reuse.In the first stage, clients locally apply LEKE and upload the computed MKVs. In the second stage, rather than relying solely on server-based MKV sharing, FedLEKE allows clients retrieve relevant MKVs based on cosine... | Zongkai Zhao, Guozeng Xu, Xiuhua Li, Kaiwen Wei, Jiang Zhong |  |

Our real-world measurements show that both server-based and on-device deployments struggle to meet diverse QoE demands: server deployments face high costs and last-hop issues (e.g., Internet latency and dynamics), while on-device LLM inference is constrained by resources. We introduce , a device-server cooperative scheduler designed to optimize users’ QoE by adaptively routing requests and migrating response generation between endpoints while maintaining cost constraints. employs cost-aware scheduling, leveraging the predictable speed of on-device LLM inference with the flexible capacity of server-based inference to dispatch requests on the fly, while introducing a token-level... | Ting Sun, Penghan Wang, Fan Lai |  |

This work explores the possibility of adapting the model to dynamic user interests without any model-level updates via In-context Learning (ICL), which enables adaptation through few-shot examples within input prompts. While using recent user interactions as ICL demonstrations offers a potential solution for dynamic interest adaptation, existing LLM-based recommenders face critical limitations: recommendation-specific tuning often diminishes the model’s in-context learning ability, and the original LLM’s ICL lacks task-specific optimization for recommendations. To bridge this gap, we introduce RecICL, a framework that establishes recommendation-oriented in-context learning by structuring recent user interactions and current inputs into ICL formats.

Previous data watermarking techniques primarily focus on effective memorization after pretraining, while overlooking challenges that arise in other stages of the LLM pipeline, such as the risk of watermark filtering during data preprocessing, or potential forgetting through post-training, or verification difficulties due to API-only access. We propose a novel data watermarking approach that injects coherent and plausible yet fictitious knowledge into training data using generated passages describing a fictitious entity and its associated attributes. Our watermarks are designed to be memorized by the LLM through seamlessly integrating in its training data, making them harder to detect lexically during preprocessing. We demonstrate that our watermarks can be effectively... | Xinyue Cui, Johnny TianZheng Wei, Swabha Swayamdipta, Robin Jia |  |

However, dialogue context frequently contains noisy or irrelevant information, leading to sub-optimal result in knowledge retrieval. One possible approach to retrieving knowledge is to manually annotate standard queries for each dialogue. Yet, this approach is hindered by the challenge of data scarcity, as human annotation is costly. To solve the challenge, we propose an LLM-enhanced model of query-guided knowledge retrieval for task-oriented dialogue. It generates high-quality queries for knowledge retrieval in task-oriented dialogue solely using low-resource annotated queries. To strengthen the performance correlation between response generation and knowledge retrieval, we propose a retrieval preservation mechanism by further selecting the most relevant knowledge from retrieved top-K records and explicitly incorporating these as prompts to guide a generator in response generation.... | Jiale Chen, Xuelian Dong, Wenxiu Xie, Ru Peng, Kun Zeng, Tianyong Hao |  |

However, evidence suggests that the conventional scheme of next-word prediction may not fully capture how humans learn to think. Inspired by how humans generalize mathematical reasoning, we propose a new approach named ClozeMath to fine-tune LLMs for mathematical reasoning. Our ClozeMath involves a text-infilling task that predicts masked equations from a given solution, analogous to cloze exercises used in human learning. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH, and GSM-Symbolic show that ClozeMath surpasses the strong baseline Masked Thought in performance and robustness, with two test-time scaling decoding algorithms, Beam Search and Chain-of-Thought decoding. Additionally, we conduct an ablation study to analyze the effects of various architectural and implementation choices on our approach. | Quang Hieu Pham, Thuy Duong Nguyen, Tung Pham, Anh Tuan Luu, Dat Quoc Nguyen |  |

A fair number of tokens in these texts are hardly modifiable without changing the intended meaning, causing statistical measures to falsely indicate the absence of a watermark. Existing research addresses this issue by rely mainly on a limited number of high-entropy tokens, which are considered flexible for modification, and accurately reflecting watermarks. However, their detection accuracy remains suboptimal, as they neglect strong watermark evidences embedded in low entropy tokens modified through watermarking. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Bayes’ Rule derived Watermark Detector (BRWD), which exploit watermark information from every token, by leveraging the posterior probability of watermark’s presence. We theoretically prove the optimality of our method... | Beining Huang, Du Su, Fei Sun, Qi Cao, Huawei Shen, Xueqi Cheng |  |

This study introduces \*\*Chain-of-Diagnosis (CoD)\*\* to enhance the interpretability of medical automatic diagnosis. CoD transforms the diagnostic process into a diagnostic chain that mirrors a physician’s thought process, providing a transparent reasoning pathway. Additionally, CoD outputs the disease confidence distribution to ensure transparency in decision-making. This interpretability makes model diagnostics controllable and aids in identifying critical symptoms for inquiry through the entropy reduction of confidences. With CoD, we developed \*\*DiagnosisGPT\*\*, capable of diagnosing 9,604 diseases for validating CoD. Experimental results demonstrate that DiagnosisGPT outperforms other LLMs on automatic diagnostic tasks across three real-world benchmarks.

While significant progress has been made in image-aspect alignment, due to the subtlety and complexity of language expressions, there are not always explicit aspect words in the language to align with images. Existing methods typically assume a direct alignment between images and aspects, matching the entire image with a corresponding aspect. This rough alignment of images and aspects introduces noise. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a Dual-Aware Enhanced Alignment Network (DaNet) designed for fine-grained multimodal aspect-image alignment and denoising. Specifically, we first introduce a Multimodal Denoising Encoder (MDE) that jointly image and text to guide the compression and denoising of visual sequences. And then, aspect-aware and sentiment-aware networks are constructed to jointly enhance fine-grained alignment and denoising of text-image... | Aoqiang Zhu, Min Hu, Xiaohua Wang, Jiaoyun Yang, Yiming Tang, Ning An |  |

While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in understanding Chinese, recent studies show that simple character substitutions in toxic Chinese text can easily confuse the state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs. In this paper, we highlight the multimodal nature of Chinese language as a key challenge for deploying LLMs in toxic Chinese detection. First, we propose a taxonomy of 3 perturbation strategies and 8 specific approaches in toxic Chinese content. Then, we curate a dataset based on this taxonomy, and benchmark 9 SOTA LLMs (from both the US and China) to assess if they can detect perturbed toxic Chinese text. Additionally, we explore cost-effective enhancement solutions like in-context learning (ICL) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Our results reveal two important findings. (1) LLMs are less capable of detecting perturbed multimodal Chinese toxic contents. (2) ICL or SFT with a small... | Shujian Yang, Shiyao Cui, Chuanrui Hu, Haicheng Wang, Tianwei Zhang, Minlie Huang, Jialiang Lu, Han Qiu |  |

Existing text embedding (e.g., SimCSE and LLM2Vec) have demonstrated excellent performance, but the values of each dimension are difficult to trace and interpret. Bag-of-words, as classic sparse interpretable embeddings, suffers from poor performance. Recently, Benara et al. (2024) propose interpretable text embeddings using large language models, which forms ”0/1” embeddings based on responses to a series of questions. These interpretable text embeddings are typically high-dimensional (larger than 10,000). In this work, we propose Low-dimensional (lower than 500) Dense and Interpretable text embeddings with Relative representations (LDIR). The numerical values of its dimensions indicate semantic relatedness to different anchor texts through farthest point sampling, offering both semantic representation as well as a certain level of traceability and interpretability. We validate LDIR on... | Yile Wang, Zhanyu Shen, Hui Huang |  |

However, previous chain-of-thought reasoning methods typically generate only a single answer in each trial, thereby ignoring the possibility of other potential answers. As a result, these alternative answers are often overlooked in subsequent voting processes. In this work, we propose to generate ranked answers in each reasoning process and conduct ranked voting among multiple ranked answers from different responses, thereby making the overall self-consistency more reliable. Specifically, we use three ranked voting methods: Instant-runoff voting, Borda count voting, and mean reciprocal rank voting. We validate our methods on six datasets, including three multiple-choice and three open-ended question-answering tasks, using both advanced open-source and closed-source large language... | Weiqin Wang, Yile Wang, Hui Huang |  |

Although safety training is widely used in LLMs, the mismatch between pre-training and safety training still leads to safety vulnerabilities. To expose the safety vulnerabilities in LLMs and improve LLMs’ performance in safety, we propose a novel framework, SemanticCamo, which attacks LLMs through semantic camouflage.SemanticCamo bypasses safety guardrails by replacing the original unsafe content with semantic features, thereby concealing malicious intent while keeping the query’s objectives unchanged. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o and Claude-3.5, finding that SemanticCamo successfully induces harmful responses from the target models in over 80% of cases on average, outperforming previous counterparts. Additionally, the performance of SemanticCamo against various defenses is... | Jihui Yan, Xiaocui Yang, Daling Wang, Shi Feng, Yifei Zhang, Yinzhi Zhao |  |

Existing joint optimization methods iteratively alternate between quantization and low-rank approximation. However, these methods tend to prioritize one component at the expense of the other, resulting in suboptimal decompositions that fail to leverage each component’s unique strengths. In this work, we introduce Outlier-Driven Low-Rank Initialization (ODLRI), which assigns low-rank components the specific role of capturing activation-sensitive weights. This structured decomposition mitigates outliers’ negative impact on quantization, enabling more effective balance between quantization and low-rank approximation. Experiments on Llama2 (7B, 13B, 70B), Llama3-8B, and Mistral-7B demonstrate that incorporating ODLRI into the joint optimization framework consistently reduces activation-aware error, minimizes quantization scale, and... | Yoonjun Cho, Soeun Kim, Dongjae Jeon, Kyelim Lee, Beomsoo Lee, Albert No |  |

Existing approaches, represented by process reward models (PRMs), primarily focus on rewarding signals up to the current step, exhibiting a one-directional nature and lacking a mechanism to model the distance to the final target. To address this problem, we draw inspiration from the A\* algorithm, which states that an effective supervisory signal should simultaneously consider the incurred cost and the estimated cost for reaching the target. Building on this key insight, we introduce BiRM, a novel process supervision model that not only evaluates the correctness of previous steps but also models the probability of future success. We conduct extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks and demonstrate that BiRM provides more precise evaluations of LLM reasoning steps, achieving an improvement of 3.1% on... | Wenxiang Chen, Wei He, Zhiheng Xi, Honglin Guo, Boyang Hong, Jiazheng Zhang, Nijun Li, Tao Gui, Yun Li, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang |  |

However, although LLMs show promising cross-lingual alignment in Information Extraction (IE), a significant imbalance across languages persists, highlighting an underlying deficiency. To address this, we propose KnowCoder-X, a powerful code LLM with advanced cross-lingual and multilingual capabilities for universal IE. Firstly, it standardizes the representation of multilingual schemas using Python classes, ensuring a consistent ontology across different languages. Then, IE across languages is formulated as a unified code generation task. Secondly, we conduct IE cross-lingual alignment instruction tuning on the translated instance prediction task to enhance the model’s cross-lingual transferability. During this phase, we also construct a high-quality and diverse bilingual IE parallel dataset with 257k samples, called ParallelNER, synthesized by our proposed robust three-stage pipeline, with manual... | Yuxin Zuo, Wenxuan Jiang, Wenxuan Liu, Zixuan Li, Long Bai, Hanbin Wang, Yutao Zeng, Xiaolong Jin, Jiafeng Guo, Xueqi Cheng |  |

Recent studies have concentrated on classifying cardiac conditions using ECG data but have overlooked ECG report generation, which is time-consuming and requires clinical expertise. To automate ECG report generation and ensure its versatility, we propose the Multimodal ECG Instruction Tuning (MEIT) framework, the first attempt to tackle ECG report generation with LLMs and multimodal instructions. To facilitate future research, we establish a benchmark to evaluate MEIT with various LLMs backbones across two large-scale ECG datasets. Our approach uniquely aligns the representations of the ECG signal and the report, and we conduct extensive experiments to benchmark MEIT with nine open-source LLMs using more than 800,000 ECG reports. MEIT’s results underscore the superior performance of instruction-tuned LLMs, showcasing their proficiency in quality... | Zhongwei Wan, Che Liu, Xin Wang, Chaofan Tao, Hui Shen, Jing Xiong, Rossella Arcucci, Huaxiu Yao, Mi Zhang |  |

Despite increasing research on disaster-focused LLMs, there remains a lack of systematic reviews and in-depth analyses of their applications in natural disaster management. To address this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of LLMs in disaster response, introducing a taxonomy that categorizes existing works based on disaster phases and application scenarios. By compiling public datasets and identifying key challenges and opportunities, this study aims to provide valuable insights for the research community and practitioners in developing advanced LLM-driven solutions to enhance resilience against natural disasters. | Zhenyu Lei, Yushun Dong, Weiyu Li, Rong Ding, Qi R.

Yet, most research in reasoning has focused on mathematical tasks, leaving domains like medicine underexplored. The medical domain, though distinct from mathematics, also demands robust reasoning to provide reliable answers, given the high standards of healthcare. However, verifying medical reasoning is challenging, unlike those in mathematics. To address this, we propose \*\*Medical Verifiable Problems\*\* with a medical verifier to check the correctness of model outputs. This verifiable nature enables advancements in medical reasoning through \*\*a two-stage approach\*\*: (1) using the verifier to guide the search for a complex reasoning trajectory for fine-tuning LLMs, (2) applying reinforcement learning (RL) with verifier-based rewards to enhance complex reasoning further. Finally, we introduce HuatuoGPT-o1, a medical LLM capable of complex reasoning, which outperforms general and... | Junying Chen, Zhenyang Cai, Ke Ji, Xidong Wang, Wanlong Liu, Rongsheng Wang, Benyou Wang |  |

Existing methods to mitigating such risk often rely on sampling multiple full-length generations, which introduces significant response latency and becomes ineffective when the model consistently produces hallucinated outputs with high confidence. To address these limitations, we introduce Monitoring Decoding (MD), a novel framework that dynamically monitors the generation process and selectively applies in-process interventions, focusing on revising crucial tokens responsible for hallucinations. Instead of waiting until completion of multiple full-length generations, we identify hallucination-prone tokens during generation using a monitor function, and further refine these tokens through a tree-based decoding strategy. This approach ensures an enhanced factual accuracy and coherence in... | Yurui Chang, Bochuan Cao, Lu Lin |  |

However, existing verifiers are trained with binary classification labels, which are not informative enough for the model to accurately assess the solutions. To mitigate the aforementioned insufficiency of binary labels, we introduce step-wise natural language feedback as rationale labels, that is, the correctness of each step and the detailed explanations. In this paper, we propose Math-Minos, a natural language feedback-enhanced verifier by constructing automatically generated training data and a two-stage training paradigm for effective training and efficient inference. Our experiments reveal that a small set of natural language feedback can significantly boost the performance of the verifier in both verification and reinforcement learning and also significantly alleviates the data-demanding problems of the reward... | Bofei Gao, Zefan Cai, Runxin Xu, Peiyi Wang, Ce Zheng, Runji Lin, Keming Lu, Dayiheng Liu, Chang Zhou, Wen Xiao, Tianyu Liu, Baobao Chang |  |

However, existing detection methods mainly evaluate on static benchmarks, which neglect the evolving nature of LLMs. Relying on existing static benchmarks could create a misleading sense of security, overestimating the real-world effectiveness of detection methods.To bridge this gap, we introduce EvoBench, a dynamic benchmark considering a new dimension of generalization across continuously evolving LLMs.EvoBench categorizes the evolving LLMs into (1) updates over time and (2) developments like finetuning and pruning, covering 7 LLM families and their 29 evolving versions. To measure the generalization across evolving LLMs, we introduce a new EMG (Evolving Model Generalization) metric. Our evaluation of 14 detection methods on EvoBench reveals that they all struggle to maintain generalization when confronted with evolving... | Xiao Yu, Yi Yu, Dongrui Liu, Kejiang Chen, Weiming Zhang, Nenghai Yu, Jing Shao |  |

We present MMSciBench, a benchmark for evaluating mathematical and physical reasoning through text-only and text-image formats, with human-annotated difficulty levels, solutions with detailed explanations, and taxonomic mappings. Evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals significant limitations, with even the best model achieving only 63.77% accuracy and particularly struggling with visual reasoning tasks. Our analysis exposes critical gaps in complex reasoning and visual-textual integration, establishing MMSciBench as a rigorous standard for measuring progress in multimodal scientific understanding. The code for MMSciBench is open-sourced at GitHub, and the dataset is available at Hugging Face. | Xinwu Ye, Chengfan Li, Siming Chen, Wei Wei, Robert Tang |  |

To address this issue, we propose Lightweight Query Checkpoint (LQC), a small classification model that detects verification-required queries before the LLM generates a potentially faulty answer. LQC leverages hidden states extracted from intermediate layers of a smaller-scale, non-instruct-tuned LLM to effectively distinguish queries requiring verification from clear queries. We first systematically define categories of queries that need verification, construct a dataset comprising both defective and clear queries, and train a binary contrastive learning model. Through extensive experiments on various QA datasets, we demonstrate that incorporating LQC into QA pipelines reduces hallucinations while preserving strong answer quality. | Minjoo Son, Jonghak Jang, Misuk Kim |  |

Since access to the original in-hospital data (source domain) is often restricted, annotated data from the target hospital (target domain) is crucial for domain adaptation. However, clinical annotation is notoriously expensive and time-consuming, as it demands clinical and linguistic expertise. To address this issue, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to annotate the target domain data for the adaptation. We conduct experiments on four clinical information extraction tasks, including eight target domain data. Experimental results show that LLM-annotated data consistently enhances SLM performance and, with a larger number of annotated data, outperforms manual annotation in three out of four tasks. | Seiji Shimizu, Shohei Hisada, Yutaka Uno, Shuntaro Yada, Shoko Wakamiya, Eiji Aramaki |  |

However, their adaption in the text domain remains limited. Most existing methods rely on predefined concept annotations and cannot discover unseen concepts, while other methods that extract concepts without supervision often produce explanations that are not intuitively comprehensible to humans, potentially diminishing user trust. These methods fall short of discovering comprehensible concepts automatically. To address this issue, we propose ECO-Concept, an intrinsically interpretable framework to discover comprehensible concepts with no concept annotations. ECO-Concept first utilizes an object-centric architecture to extract semantic concepts automatically. Then the comprehensibility of the extracted concepts is evaluated by large language models. Finally, the evaluation result guides the subsequent model fine-tuning... | Yifan Sun, Danding Wang, Qiang Sheng, Juan Cao, Jintao Li |  |

While existing work tackles this issue by utilizing generative models to create high-quality synthetic corpora, their methods require learning from the original in-hospital clinical documents, turning them unfeasible in practice. To address this problem, we introduce RecordTwin, a novel synthetic corpus creation method designed to generate synthetic documents from anonymized clinical entities. In this method, we first extract and anonymize entities from in-hospital documents to ensure the information contained in the synthetic corpus is restricted. Then, we use a large language model to fill the context between anonymized entities. To do so, we use a small, privacy-preserving subset of the original documents to mimic their formatting and writing style. This approach only requires anonymized entities and a small subset of original documents in the generation process,... | Seiji Shimizu, Ibrahim Baroud, Lisa Raithel, Shuntaro Yada, Shoko Wakamiya, Eiji Aramaki |  |

Unfortunately, existing methods often focus on surface-level patterns, overlooking the deeper attack essences. As a result, defenses fail when attack prompts change, even though the underlying “attack essences” remain the same. To address this issue, we introduce EDDF, an Essence-Driven Defense Framework Against Jailbreak Attacks in LLMs. EDDF is a plug-and-play input-filtering method and operates in two stages: 1) offline essence database construction, and 2) online adversarial query detection. The key idea behind EDDF is to extract the “attack essence” from a diverse set of known attack instances and store it in an offline vector database. Experimental results demonstrate that EDDF significantly outperforms existing methods by reducing the Attack Success Rate by at least 20%, underscoring its superior robustness against jailbreak attacks. | Shiyu Xiang, Ansen Zhang, Yanfei Cao, Fan Yang, Ronghao Chen |  |

However, existing MSA datasets commonly exhibit significant sentiment distribution imbalances and cross-modal sentiment conflicts, which hinder performance improvement. This paper shows that distributional discrepancies and sentiment conflicts can be incorporated into the model training to learn stable multimodal invariant sentiment representation. To this end, we propose a Multimodal Invariant Sentiment Representation Learning (MISR) method. Specifically, we first learn a stable and consistent multimodal joint representation in the latent space of Gaussian distribution based on distributional constraints Then, under invariance constraint, we further learn multimodal invariant sentiment representations from multiple distributional environments constructed by the joint representation and unimodal data, achieving robust and efficient MSA performance.

Traditional approaches, such as truncating inputs, sparse self-attention, and chunking, attempt to mitigate these issues, but they often lead to information loss and hinder the model’s ability to capture long-range dependencies. In this paper, we introduce ChuLo, a novel chunk representation method for long document understanding that addresses these limitations. Our ChuLo groups input tokens using unsupervised keyphrase extraction, emphasizing semantically important keyphrase based chunks to retain core document content while reducing input length. This approach minimizes information loss and improves the efficiency of Transformer-based models. Preserving all tokens in long document understanding, especially token classification tasks, is important to ensure that fine-grained annotations,... | Yan Li, Caren Han, Yue Dai, Feiqi Cao |  |

Current approaches to address this issue involve costly dataset scrubbing, or model filtering through unlearning and model editing, which can be bypassed through extraction attacks. We propose REVS, a novel non-gradient-based method for unlearning sensitive information from LMs. REVS identifies and modifies a small subset of neurons relevant for constituent tokens which form sensitive information. To adequately evaluate our method on truly sensitive information, we curate three datasets: an email and URL datasets naturally memorized by the models, and a synthetic social security number dataset that we tune the models to memorize. Compared to other methods, REVS demonstrates superior performance in unlearning sensitive information and robustness to extraction attacks, while retaining underlying model integrity. | Tomer Ashuach, Martin Tutek, Yonatan Belinkov |  |

Prior work suggests that the use of external information, e.g., excerpts from Wikipedia, improves stance detection performance. However, whether or not such information can benefit large language models (LLMs) remains an unanswered question, despite their wide adoption in many reasoning tasks. In this study, we conduct a systematic evaluation on how Wikipedia and web search external information can affect stance detection across eight LLMs and in three datasets with 12 targets. Surprisingly, we find that such information degrades performance in most cases, with macro F1 scores dropping by up to 27.9%. We explain this through experiments showing LLMs’ tendency to align their predictions with the stance and sentiment of the provided information rather than the ground truth stance of the given text. We also find that performance degradation persists with chain-of-thought... | Quang Minh Nguyen, Taegyoon Kim |  |

To detect such issues, we propose the novel task of Query-Conditioned Natural Language Inference (QC-NLI), where the goal is to determine the semantic relationship (e.g. entailment or not entailment) between two documents conditioned on a query; we demonstrate that many common tasks regarding inconsistency detection can be formulated as QC-NLI problems. We focus on three applications in particular: fact verification, intrinsic hallucination detection, and document inconsistency detection. We convert existing datasets for these tasks into the QC-NLI format, and manual annotation confirms their high quality. Finally, we employ zero- and few-shot prompting methods to solve the QC-NLI prediction problem for each task, showing the... | Marc E.

To address this, we propose a novel method that extracts flowcharts from dialogue data and incorporates them into LLMs. This approach not only makes the decision-making process more interpretable through visual representation, but also ensures the reproducibility of expert knowledge by explicitly modeling structured reasoning flows. By evaluating on dialogue datasets, we demonstrate that our method effectively reconstructs expert decision-making paths with high precision and recall scores. These findings underscore the potential of flowchart-based decision making to bridge the gap between flexibility and structured reasoning, making chatbot systems more interpretable for developers and end-users. | Yuuki Yamanaka, Hiroshi Takahashi, Tomoya Yamashita |  |

Distinct from the typical automated essay scoring, this task focuses primarily on evaluating the completeness of narrative content and the coherence of expression, as well as the interpretability of assessment results. To address these issues, we propose a novel computational assessing framework NarGINA, under which the narrative graph is introduced to provide a concise and structured summary representation of narrative text, allowing for explicit narrative measurement. To this end, we construct the first Chinese children’s narrative assessment corpus based on real children’s narrative samples, and we then design a narrative graph construction model and a narrative graph-assisted scoring model to yield accurate narrative ability assessment. Particularly, to enable the scoring model to understand narrative graphs, we propose a multi-view graph contrastive learning... | Jun Zhong, Longwei Xu, Li Kong, Xianzhuo Li, Dandan Liang, Junsheng Zhou |  |

Block floating-point (BFP) arithmetic offers an effective solution by leveraging the strengths of both floating-point and fixed-point representations, leading to reductions in both storage and computational overhead. However, current low-bit BFP quantization approaches often struggle to handle extreme outliers, leading to significant accuracy degradation. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Extendable Exponent Sharing (EES), a novel BFP representation that extends the exponent bit width to capture a wider dynamic range. EES achieves this by embedding extendable exponent bits into the least significant mantissa bits, thereby increasing the shared exponent’s bit width without incurring additional storage costs. To optimize the trade-off between accuracy and energy efficiency, EES employs a... | Dongyang Li, Zeyang Li, Bosheng Liu, Jigang Wu |  |

However, the high cost of acquiring annotated data often prevents models from obtaining capabilities to tackle downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, EpiCoDe that boosts model performance in data-scarcity scenarios without extra training. We first employ model extrapolation to enhance a finetuned model with its inferior version, and then adopt contrastive decoding to further reduce predicted errors, by comparing the logit scores given by the extrapolated and the vanilla finetuned model. Experiments across three domains over four different LLMs show that EpiCoDe consistently outperforms existing methods with significant and robust improvement. We also propose a new theoretical framework to reveal the mechanism behind contrastive decoding in data-scarcity scenarios, which further helps better understand the effectiveness of our... | Mingxu Tao, Jie Hu, Mingchuan Yang, Yunhuai Liu, Dongyan Zhao, Yansong Feng |  |

Despite the numerous QA datasets that have been developed and some work done in parallel, there is a notable lack of a framework and large-scale region-specific datasets queried by native users in their own languages. This gap hinders effective benchmarking and the development of fine-tuned models for regional and cultural specificities. In this study, we propose a scalable, language-independent framework, NativQA, to seamlessly construct culturally and regionally aligned QA datasets in native languages for LLM evaluation and tuning. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework by designing a multilingual natural QA dataset, MultiNativQA, consisting of approximately ~64K manually annotated QA pairs in seven languages, ranging from high- to extremely low-resource, based on queries from native... | Md.

Despite the increased discourse challenges introduced by noise from automatic speech recognition (ASR), the integration of document-level context in speech translation (ST) remains insufficiently explored. In this paper, we develop DoCIA, an online framework that enhances ST performance by incorporating document-level context. DoCIA decomposes the ST pipeline into four stages. Document-level context is integrated into the ASR refinement, MT, and MT refinement stages through auxiliary LLM (large language model)-based modules. Furthermore, DoCIA leverages document-level information in a multi-level manner while minimizing computational overhead. Additionally, a simple yet effective determination mechanism is introduced to prevent hallucinations from excessive refinement, ensuring the reliability of the final results. Experimental results show that DoCIA... | Xinglin Lyu, Wei Tang, Yuang Li, Xiaofeng Zhao, Ming Zhu, Junhui Li, Yunfei Lu, Min Zhang, Daimeng Wei, Hao Yang |  |

MHQA requires integrating evidence from diverse sources while managing intricate logical dependencies, often leads to errors in reasoning. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), widely employed in MHQA tasks, faces challenges in effectively filtering noisy data and retrieving all necessary evidence, thereby limiting its effectiveness in addressing MHQA challenges. To address these challenges, we propose RISE:Reasoning Enhancement via Iterative Self-Exploration, a novel framework designed to enhance models’ reasoning capability through iterative self-exploration. Specifically, RISE involves three key steps in addressing MHQA tasks: question decomposition, retrieve-then-read, and self-critique. By leveraging continuous self-exploration, RISE identifies accurate reasoning paths, iteratively self-improving the model’s capability to... | Bolei He, Xinran He, Mengke Chen, Xianwei Xue, Ying Zhu, ZhenHua Ling |  |

However, VLMs are prone to hallucinations—generating outputs that lack alignment with visual content. This paper addresses hallucination detection in VLMs by leveraging the visual grounding information encoded in transformer attention maps. We identify three primary challenges in this approach: the elective nature of visual grounding for certain tokens, the high-dimensional and noisy nature of attention maps, and the dynamic sequence length of attention on previous tokens. To address these, we propose VADE, a novel sequence modelling approach to effectively learn complex sequential patterns from high-dimensional and noisy attention maps for fine-grained hallucination detection and mitigation. VADE achieves an average PR-AUC of 80% in hallucination detection on M-HalDetect across four different model architectures and an 5% improvement in hallucination mitigation on MSCOCO. | Vishnu Prabhakaran, Purav Aggarwal, Vinay Kumar Verma, Gokul Swamy, Anoop Saladi |  |

Existing LLM agents mainly generate natural language plans to guide reasoning, which is verbose and inefficient. NL plans are also tailored to specific tasks and restrict agents’ ability to generalize across similar tasks. To this end, we explore pseudocode-style plans (P-code Plan) to capture the structural logic of reasoning. We find that P-code Plan empowers LLM agents with stronger generalization ability and more efficiency. Inspired by this finding, we propose a pseudocode-style ̲Planning ̲Guided ̲Preference ̲Optimization method called PGPO for effective agent learning. With two planning-oriented rewards, PGPO further enhances LLM agents’ ability to generate high-quality P-code Plans and subsequent reasoning. Experiments show that PGPO achieves superior performance on representative agent benchmarks and outperforms the current leading baselines.

While clinical notes share similarities with biomedical text in terminology, they often lack the proper casing found in polished publications. Language models, unlike humans, require a fixed vocabulary and case sensitivity is a trade-off that must be considered carefully. Improper casing can lead to sub-optimal tokenization and increased sequence length, degrading downstream performance and increasing computational costs. While most recent open-domain encoder language models use uncased tokenization for all tasks, there is no clear trend in biomedical and clinical models. In this work we (1) show that uncased models exceed the performance of cased models on clinical notes, even on traditionally case-sensitive tasks such as named entity recognition and (2) introduce independent case encoding to better balance model performance on case-sensitive and improperly-cased tasks. | Cory Paik, Katharina von der Wense |  |

However, this reduction causes accuracy degradation due to activation outliers. Rotation-based INT4 methods address this via matrix calibration, but they introduce multi-hour overheads and leave key computations in full precision. Microscaling (MX) floating-point (FP) formats offer fine-grained representation with a shared scale, enabling fully quantized matrix multiplications through direct casting without calibration. However, existing research shows unsatisfactory empirical results for MXFP4 inference, and the robustness of MX formats remains largely unexplored. In this work, we uncover the fundamental tradeoffs of the MX format: while it effectively suppresses activation outliers, it does so at the cost of increased group-wise asymmetry. To address this, we propose AMXFP4, a 4-bit asymmetric FP format that handles... | Janghwan Lee, Jiwoong Park, Jinseok Kim, Yongjik Kim, Jungju Oh, Jinwook Oh, Jungwook Choi |  |

The most common approach for packing data before continual pre-training involves concatenating input texts and splitting them into fixed-length sequences. While straightforward and efficient, this method often leads to excessive truncation and context discontinuity, which can hinder model performance. To address these issues, we explore the potential of data engineering to enhance continual pre-training, particularly its impact on model performance and efficiency. We propose Seamless Packing (SP), a novel data packing strategy aimed at preserving contextual information and enhancing model performance. Our approach employs a sliding window technique in the first stage that synchronizes overlapping tokens across consecutive sequences, ensuring better continuity and contextual coherence. In the second stage, we adopt a First-Fit-Decreasing algorithm to... | Ruicheng Yin, Xuan Gao, Changze Lv, Xiaohua Wang, Xiaoqing Zheng, Xuanjing Huang |  |

This study examines implicit age-related name bias in LLMs used for job recommendations. Analyzing six LLMs and 117 American names categorized by perceived age across 30 occupations, we find systematic bias: older-sounding names are favored for senior roles, while younger-sounding names are linked to youth-dominant jobs, reinforcing generational stereotypes. We also find that this bias is based on perceived rather than real ages associated with the names. | Mahammed Kamruzzaman, Gene Louis Kim |  |

However, toxicity can be fine-grained into various subcategories, making it difficult to remove certain types of toxicity by using a single toxicity probe vector. To address this limitation, we propose a category-specific toxicity probe vector approach. First, we train multiple toxicity probe vectors for different toxicity categories. During generation, we dynamically select the most relevant toxicity probe vector based on the current context. Finally, the selected vector is dynamically scaled and subtracted from model. Our method successfully mitigated toxicity from categories that the single probe vector approach failed to detoxify. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves up to a 78.52% reduction in toxicity on the evaluation dataset, while fluency remains nearly unchanged, with only a 0.052% drop compared to the... | Cho Hyeonsu, Dooyoung Kim, Youngjoong Ko |  |

However, instruction tuning may overly tailor the models to task-specific formats, potentially compromising their generalization on unseen tasks. We attribute the issue to the spurious correlations learned between inputs and targets. We propose explicit task knowledge injection to mitigate these shortcuts with latent task adaptation and knowledge reinstatement. Latent tasks serve as interpolations between new tasks and facilitate knowledge sharing with joint adaptation enabling the model to build task knowledge more smoothly. Knowledge reinstatement helps optimize building new knowledge with prior knowledge. Specifically, we retrieve input-relevant latent tasks and jointly learn the task and the relevant latent tasks. Moreover, we prompt the model to recall the forms of inputs corresponding to the target and build the task... | Yukun Zhao, Lingyong Yan, Zhenyang Li, Shuaiqiang Wang, Zhumin Chen, Zhaochun Ren, Dawei Yin |  |

Existing automatic singing annotation (ASA) methods, however, primarily tackle isolated aspects of the annotation pipeline. To address this fundamental challenge, we present STARS, which is, to our knowledge, the first unified framework that simultaneously addresses singing transcription, alignment, and refined style annotation. Our framework delivers comprehensive multi-level annotations encompassing: (1) precise phoneme-audio alignment, (2) robust note transcription and temporal localization, (3) expressive vocal technique identification, and (4) global stylistic characterization including emotion and pace. The proposed architecture employs hierarchical acoustic feature processing across frame, word, phoneme, note, and sentence levels.

However, CoT prompting greatly increases computational demands, which has prompted growing interest in distilling CoT capabilities into Small Language Models (SLMs). This study systematically examines the factors influencing CoT distillation, including the choice of granularity, format and teacher model. Through experiments involving four teacher models and seven student models across seven mathematical and commonsense reasoning datasets, we uncover three key findings: (1) Unlike LLMs, SLMs exhibit a \*non-monotonic\* relationship with granularity, with stronger models benefiting from finer-grained reasoning and weaker models performing better with simpler CoT supervision; (2) CoT format significantly impacts LLMs but has \*minimal\* effect on SLMs, likely due to their reliance on supervised fine-tuning rather than pretraining preferences; (3) Stronger teacher models do \*NOT\* always... | Xinghao Chen, Zhijing Sun, Wenjin Guo, Miaoran Zhang, Yanjun Chen, Yirong Sun, Hui Su, Yijie Pan, Dietrich Klakow, Wenjie Li, Xiaoyu Shen |  |

The inherent linguistic diversity presents significant challenges in achieving performance comparable to traditional SLU. Recent studies have attempted to improve multilingual SLU performance by sharing multilingual encoders. However, these approaches have not directly established information flow between languages. To address this, we first demonstrate the feasibility of such information transfer and pinpoint the key challenges: prediction error mitigation and multilingual slot alignment. We then propose the INformation Transfer network (INT) to tackle these challenges. The gate unit in INT controls the information flow between languages, reducing the adverse impact of prediction errors on both ID and SF. Additionally, we reformulate SF as a span prediction problem and introduce a slot-matching attention mechanism to achieve slot alignment across languages.... | Di Wu, Liting Jiang, Bohui Mao, Hongyan Xie, Haoxiang Su, Zhongjiang He, Ruiyu Fang, Shuangyong Song, Hao Huang, Xuelong Li |  |

In this work, we introduce CIP, a novel technique that leverages causal influence diagrams (CIDs) to identify and mitigate risks arising from agent decision-making. CIDs provide a structured representation of cause-and-effect relationships, enabling agents to anticipate harmful outcomes and make safer decisions. Our approach consists of three key steps: (1) initializing a CID based on task specifications to outline the decision-making process, (2) guiding agent interactions with the environment using the CID, and (3) iteratively refining the CID based on observed behaviors and outcomes. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively enhances safety in both code execution and mobile device control tasks. | Dongyoon Hahm, Woogyeol Jin, June Suk Choi, Sungsoo Ahn, Kimin Lee |  |

In this position/theory paper, we propose a paradigm shift by designing an architecture to memorize text directly, bearing in mind the principle that memorization precedes learning. We introduce MeMo, a novel architecture for language modeling that explicitly memorizes sequences of tokens in layered associative memories. By design, MeMo offers transparency and the possibility of model editing, including forgetting texts. We experimented with the MeMo architecture, showing the memorization power of the one-layer and the multi-layer configurations. | Fabio Massimo Zanzotto, Elena Sofia Ruzzetti, Giancarlo A.

By extending the Retrieval-Augmented Generative Error Correction (RAGEC) framework, DeRAGEC employs synthetic denoising rationales to filter out noisy NE candidates before correction. By leveraging phonetic similarity and augmented definitions, it refines noisy retrieved NEs using in-context learning, requiring no additional training. Experimental results on CommonVoice and STOP datasets show significant improvements in Word Error Rate (WER) and NE hit ratio, outperforming baseline ASR and RAGEC methods. Specifically, we achieved a 28% relative reduction in WER compared to ASR without postprocessing. | Solee Im, Wonjun Lee, Jinmyeong An, Yunsu Kim, Jungseul Ok, Gary Geunbae Lee |  |

To address this, Rehearsal, a personalized opinion summarization framework via LLM-based role-playing is proposed. Having the model act as the user, the model can better understand the user’s personalized needs.Additionally, a role-playing supervisor and practice process are introduced to improve the role-playing ability of the LLMs, leading to a better expression of user needs.Furthermore, the summary generation process is guided by suggestions from virtual users, ensuring that the generated summary includes the user’s interest, thus achieving personalized summary generation.

This study proposes AdParaphrase v2.0, a dataset for ad text paraphrasing, containing human preference data, to enable the analysis of the linguistic factors and to support the development of methods for generating attractive ad texts. Compared with v1.0, this dataset is 20 times larger, comprising 16,460 ad text paraphrase pairs, each annotated with preference data from ten evaluators, thereby enabling a more comprehensive and reliable analysis. Through the experiments, we identified multiple linguistic features of engaging ad texts that were not observed in v1.0 and explored various methods for generating attractive ad texts. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrated the relationships between human preference and ad performance, and highlighted the potential of reference-free metrics based on large language models for evaluating ad text attractiveness.The dataset is publicly available at:... | Soichiro Murakami, Peinan Zhang, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Hiroya Takamura, Manabu Okumura |  |

We start by observing that systems trained on average values are ill-suited for the prediction of the reading times for specific subjects, as they fail to account for individual variability and accurately analyze the reading gestures of specific reader groups, or to target specific user needs. To overcome such limitation, that is to predict the reading times for a specific subject, we propose a novel approach based on creating an embedding to compactly describe her/his fixations. Embeddings are used to individuate readers that share same or similar reading behavior from a reference corpus. Models are then trained on values averaged over this subset of similar readers. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms its corresponding variants, in... | Calogero Jerik Scozzaro, Matteo Delsanto, Daniele Paolo Radicioni |  |

This unpredictability poses a significant challenge to ensuring their safe deployment, as identifying and operating within a reliable “safe zone” is essential for mitigating risks. To address this, we present PredictaBoard, a novel collabo-rative benchmarking framework designed to evaluate the ability of score predictors (referred to as assessors) to anticipate LLM errors on specific task instances (i.e., prompts) from existing datasets. PredictaBoard evaluates pairs of LLMs and assessors by considering the rejection rate at different tolerance errors. As such, PredictaBoard stimulates research into developing better assessors and making LLMs more predictable, not only with a higher average performance. We conduct illustrative experiments using baseline assessors and state-of-the-art LLMs. PredictaBoard highlights... | Lorenzo Pacchiardi, Konstantinos Voudouris, Ben Slater, Fernando MartínezPlumed, José HernándezOrallo, Lexin Zhou, Wout Schellaert |  |

However, the decentralized nature of FL exacerbates data quality challenges, as local clients lack global visibility to filter noisy or low-quality samples before training. To resolve this issue, we propose FedDQC, a novel federated instruction tuning framework with dynamic data quality control. Our approach introduces two key innovations. First, we propose instruction-response alignment (IRA)—an efficient client-side metric for quality evaluation requiring only low-cost inference. We validate that higher-IRA data corresponds to more relevant and easier-to-learn question-answer pairs. Second, mirroring the human easy-to-hard knowledge acquisition process, we design a quality-aware hierarchical FL training framework, where the LLM is progressively fine-tuned from high- to low-IRA data in a collaborative manner. The framework also... | Yaxin Du, Rui Ye, Fengting Yuchi, Wanru Zhao, Jingjing Qu, Yanfeng Wang, Siheng Chen |  |

However, in many real-world scenarios, the collected training data inevitably contains noisy labels. To learn from noisy labels, most solutions select samples with small losses for model training. However, the selected samples, in turn, impact the loss computation in the next iteration. An inaccurate initial selection can create a vicious cycle, leading to suboptimal performance. To break this cycle, we propose Delora, a novel framework that decouples the sample selection from model training. For sample selection, Delora establishes a noisy label detector by introducing clean and noisy LoRA. Benefiting from the memory effect, the clean LoRA is encouraged to memorize clean data, while the noisy LoRA is constrained to memorize mislabeled data, which serves as a learnable threshold for selecting clean and noisy samples. For model training, Delora can use... | Bo Yuan, Yulin Chen, Yin Zhang |  |

This work explores the persuasive potential of LLMs through the framework of Jürgen Habermas’ Theory of Communicative Action. It examines whether LLMs express illocutionary intent (i.e., pragmatic functions of language such as conveying knowledge, building trust, or signaling similarity) in ways that are comparable to human communication.We simulate online discussions between opinion holders and LLMs using conversations from the persuasive subreddit \*ChangeMyView\*. We then compare the likelihood of illocutionary intents in human-written and LLM-generated counter-arguments, specifically those that successfully changed the original poster’s view. We find that all three LLMs effectively convey illocutionary intent — often more so than humans — potentially increasing their anthropomorphism. Further, LLMs craft... | Esra Dönmez, Agnieszka Falenska |  |

We introduce Nunchi-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs’ cultural understanding, with a focus on Korean superstitions. The benchmark consists of 247 questions spanning 31 topics, assessing factual knowledge, culturally appropriate advice, and situational interpretation. We evaluate multilingual LLMs in both Korean and English to analyze their ability to reason about Korean cultural contexts and how language variations affect performance. To systematically assess cultural reasoning, we propose a novel verification strategy with customized scoring metrics that capture the extent to which models recognize cultural nuances and respond appropriately. Our findings highlight significant challenges in LLMs’ cultural reasoning. While models generally recognize factual information, they struggle to apply it in practical... | Kyuhee Kim, Sangah Lee |  |

Existing endeavors have focused on bridging these gaps; however, these approaches either hinge on external data and cannot completely eliminate manual effort, or they fall short in effectively directing LLMs to generate high-quality exemplary prompts. To address the said pitfalls, we propose a novel prompt approach for automatic reasoning named LBS3, inspired by curriculum learning which better reflects human learning habits. Specifically, LBS3 initially steers LLMs to recall easy-to-hard proxy queries that are pertinent to the target query. Following this, it invokes a progressive strategy that utilizes exemplary prompts stemmed from easy-proxy queries to direct LLMs in solving hard-proxy queries, enabling the high-quality of the proxy... | Kangyang Luo, Zichen Ding, Zhenmin Weng, Lingfeng Qiao, Meng Zhao, Xiang Li, Di Yin, Jinlong Shu |  |

Knowledge distillation (KD) with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a promising approach to enhance the conversational abilities of smaller models using a larger teacher model. However, current methods primarily focus on “black-box” KD, which only uses the teacher’s responses, overlooking the rich distributional information within the teacher’s probability distribution. This paper addresses this gap by introducing daDPO (Distillation-Aware DPO), a novel framework that integrates the teacher’s distributional information into DPO distillation while preserving theoretical guarantees. Our framework offers a unified objective that enhances both preference optimization and distribution-based distillation.

Nonetheless, the high rejection rates require repeated LLMs calls to validate draft tokens, undermining the overall efficiency gain of SD.In this work, we revisit existing verification mechanisms and propose a novel synergetic mechanism Consultant Decoding (CD). CD achieves up to a 2.5-fold increase in inference speed compared to the target model, while maintaining comparable generation quality (~100% of the target model’s performance). Interestingly, this is achieved by combining models whose parameter sizes differ by two orders of magnitude.In addition, CD reduces the call frequency of the large target model to below 10%, particularly in more demanding tasks.CD’s performance was even found to surpass that of the large target model, which theoretically represents the upper bound for... | Chuanghao Ding, Jiaping Wang, Ziqing Yang, Xiaoliang Wang, Dahua Lin, Nguyen CamTu, Fei Tan |  |

To address this, we propose IntelliCockpitBench, a benchmark that encompasses diverse automotive scenarios. It includes images from front, side, and rear cameras, various road types, weather conditions, and interior views, integrating data from both moving and stationary states. Notably, all images and queries in the benchmark are verified for high levels of authenticity, ensuring the data accurately reflects real-world conditions. A sophisticated scoring methodology combining human and model-generated assessments enhances reliability and consistency.

Existing bias analysis methods rely on small-size intermediate tasks (questionnaire answering or political content generation) and rely on the LLMs themselves for analysis, thus propagating bias. We propose a new approach leveraging the observation that LLM sentiment predictions vary with the target entity in the same sentence. We define an entropy-based inconsistency metric to encode this prediction variability.

Document compression is a practical solution, but current soft compression methods often suffer from accuracy losses and require extensive pretraining. In this paper, we introduce PISCO, a novel method that achieves a 16x compression rate with minimal accuracy loss (0-3%) across diverse RAG-based question-answering (QA) tasks. Unlike existing approaches, PISCO requires no pretraining or annotated data, relying solely on sequence-level knowledge distillation from document-based questions. With the ability to fine-tune a 7-10B LLM in 24 hours on a single A100 GPU, PISCO offers a highly efficient and scalable solution. We present comprehensive experiments showing that PISCO outperforms existing compression models by 8% in accuracy. | Maxime Louis, Hervé Déjean, Stéphane Clinchant |  |

Recently, LLMs have demonstrated potential reasoning capabilities through prompt design, such as the Chain of Thought (CoT). Despite their superiority in question answering, LLMs still face challenges in answering questions that require multi-hop reasoning, often generating unreliable reasoning chains during answer generation. To improve LLMs’ performance in multi-hop reasoning, we introduce a novel reasoning approach, AnchorCoT, designed to assist LLMs in answering questions involving complex logical reasoning steps. AnchorCoT first predicts key entities which work as important “anchors” to guide the reasoning process and then employs a novel ranking algorithm to ensure the logical sequence of the predicted answers.We implement AnchorCoT on Qwen2.5-7B/14B and GPT-4o and evaluate our method on widely used multi-hop reasoning datasets, including HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and... | Tianshi Ming, Xian Wu, Yingying Zhang, Zichuan Fu, Dawei Cheng |  |

Recently, abundant works have been proposed to solve this problem with token pruning, which identifies the redundant tokens in MLLMs and then prunes them to reduce the computation and KV storage costs, leading to significant acceleration without training. While these methods claim efficiency gains, critical questions about their fundamental design and evaluation remain unanswered: Why do many existing approaches underperform even compared to naive random token selection? Are attention-based scoring sufficient for reliably identifying redundant tokens? Is language information really helpful during token pruning? What makes a good trade-off between token importance and duplication? Are current evaluation protocols comprehensive and unbiased? The ignorance of previous research on these problems hinders the long-term... | Zichen Wen, Yifeng Gao, Weijia Li, Conghui He, Linfeng Zhang |  |

Federated learning (FL) helps to exploit the use of vast private instruction data from clients, becoming popular for LLM tuning by improving data diversity. Existing federated tuning simply consumes all local data, causing excessive computational overhead and overfitting to local data, while centralized data-efficient solutions are not suitable for FL due to privacy concerns. This work presents FedHDS, a federated data-efficient instruction tuning approach, which tunes LLMs with a representative subset of edge-side data. It reduces the data redundancy at both intra- and inter-client levels without sharing raw data. Experiments with various LLMs, datasets and partitions show that FedHDS improves Rouge-L on unseen tasks by an average of 10.72% over the SOTA full-data federated instruction tuning methods, while using less than 1.5% of the data samples,... | Zhen Qin, Zhaomin Wu, Bingsheng He, Shuiguang Deng |  |

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in tasks requiring complex semantic and pragmatic understanding, highlighting their potential for detecting and explaining the meaning of implicit content. However, their ability to do this within political discourse remains largely underexplored. Leveraging, for the very first time, the large IMPAQTS corpus comprising transcribed Italian political speeches with expert annotations of various types of implicit content, we propose methods to test the effectiveness of LLMs in this challenging problem. Through a multiple-choice task and an open-ended generation task, we demonstrate that all tested models struggle to interpret presuppositions and implicatures. To illustrate, the best-performing model provides a fully correct explanation in only... | Walter Paci, Alessandro Panunzi, Sandro Pezzelle |  |

In practical applications, models must generalize to unseen entity types where labeled training data is either unavailable or severely limited—a challenge that demands zero-shot learning capabilities. While large language models (LLMs) offer extensive parametric knowledge, they fall short in cost-effectiveness compared to specialized small encoders. Existing zero-shot methods predominantly adopt a relaxed definition of the term with potential leakage issues and rely on entity type names for generalization, overlooking the value of richer descriptions for disambiguation. In this work, we introduce ZeroNER, a description-driven framework that enhances hard zero-shot NER in low-resource settings. By leveraging general-domain annotations and entity type descriptions with LLM supervision, ZeroNER enables a BERT-based student model to successfully identify unseen entity types.

Investigating the Existence and Role](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.806/) |  | 0 | This study comprehensively explores whether there actually exist “emotion neurons” within large language models (LLMs) that selectively process and express certain emotions, and what functional role they play. Drawing on the representative emotion theory of the six basic emotions, we focus on six core emotions. Using synthetic dialogue data labeled with emotions, we identified sets of neurons that exhibit consistent activation patterns for each emotion. As a result, we confirmed that principal neurons handling emotion information do indeed exist within the model, forming distinct groups for each emotion, and that their distribution varies with model size and architectural depth. We then validated the functional significance of these emotion neurons by analyzing whether the prediction accuracy for a specific emotion significantly decreases when those neurons are artificially removed. We observed that in some emotions, the accuracy drops sharply upon neuron removal, while in others, the... | Jaewook Lee, Woojin Lee, OhWoog Kwon, Harksoo Kim |  |

Existing research demonstrates the effectiveness of grammar-based code representations in small-scale models, showing their ability to reduce syntax errors and enhance performance. However, as language models scale to the billion level or beyond, syntax-level errors become rare, making it unclear whether grammar information still provides performance benefits. To explore this, we develop a series of billion-scale GrammarCoder models, incorporating grammar rules in the code generation process. Experiments on HumanEval (+) and MBPP (+) demonstrate a notable improvement in code generation accuracy. Further analysis shows that grammar-based representations enhance LLMs’ ability to discern subtle code differences, reducing semantic errors caused by minor variations. These findings suggest that grammar-based code representations remain... | Qingyuan Liang, Zhao Zhang, Zeyu Sun, Zheng Lin, Qi Luo, Yueyi Xiao, Yizhou Chen, Yuqun Zhang, Haotian Zhang, Lu Zhang, Chenbin Chenbin, Yingfei Xiong |  |

Compared to approaches predicated on GUI metadata, which are platform-dependent and vulnerable to implementation variations, vision-based approaches offer broader applicability.In this vision-based paradigm, the GUI instruction grounding, which maps user instruction to the location of corresponding element on the given screenshot, remains a critical challenge, particularly due to limited public training dataset and resource-intensive manual instruction data annotation.In this paper, we delve into unexplored challenges in this task including element-to-screen ratio, unbalanced element type, and implicit instruction. To address these challenges, we introduce a large-scale data synthesis pipeline UI-E2I-Synth for generating varying complex instruction datasets using... | Xinyi Liu, Xiaoyi Zhang, Ziyun Zhang, Yan Lu |  |

However, their performance on temporal questions and historical knowledge is limited because they often cannot understand temporal scope and orientation or neglect the temporal aspect altogether.In this study, we aim to measure precisely how robust LLMs are for question answering based on their ability to process temporal information and perform tasks requiring temporal reasoning and temporal factual knowledge. Specifically, we design eight time-sensitiverobustness tests for factual information to check the sensitivity of six popular LLMs in the zero-shot setting.Overall, we find LLMs lacking temporal robustness, especially to temporal reformulations and the use of different granularities of temporal references. We show how a selection of these eight tests can be used automatically to judge a model’s temporal robustness for user questions on the fly. Finally, we apply the findings of this study to... | Jonas Wallat, Abdelrahman Abdallah, Adam Jatowt, Avishek Anand |  |

However, current empirical methods, which primarily focus on isolated tools learning, still struggle with accurate multi-tool selection due to issues like confusing similar tools and neglecting dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose the Tool Experience Network (ToolExpNet), which integrates tools and trial-and-error experiences into a network characterized by semantic similarity and dependency relationships. ToolExpNet iteratively conducts simulated experiments using adaptive sampling to explore subtle differences and connections between tools, and summarizes these experiences to provide insightful guidance for LLM tool selection. Our experiments demonstrate that learning the relationships between tools helps achieve more comprehensive tool learning. Evaluations on multiple real-world API datasets show that ToolExpNet... | Zijing Zhang, Zhanpeng Chen, He Zhu, Ziyang Chen, Nan Du, Xiaolong Li |  |

Existing embeddings-based clustering methods rely on a few labeled examples or unsupervised fine-tuning to optimize results for each new dataset, which makes them less generalizable to multiple datasets. Our goal is to make these existing embedders more generalizable to new domain datasets without further fine-tuning. Inspired by our theoretical derivation and simulation results on the effectiveness of sampling and pooling techniques, we view the clustering task as a small-scale selection problem. A good solution to this problem is associated with better clustering performance. Accordingly, we propose a two-stage approach: First, for each utterance (referred to as the seed), we derive its embedding using an existing embedder. Then, we apply a distance metric to select a pool of candidates close to the seed. Because the... | IFan Lin, Faegheh Hasibi, Suzan Verberne |  |

In this paper, we introduce GRI-QA, a test benchmark designed to evaluate Table QA approaches in the environmental domain. Using GRI standards, we extract and annotate tables from non-financial corporate reports, generating question-answer pairs through a hybrid LLM-human approach. The benchmark includes eight datasets, categorized by the types of operations required, including operations on multiple tables from multiple documents. Our evaluation reveals a significant gap between human and model performance, particularly in multi-step reasoning, highlighting the relevance of the benchmark and the need for further research in domain-specific Table QA.

Considering that the model requires a confluence of multidimensional sub-capabilities to address the challenges of various development phases, constructing a multi-view evaluation framework is crucial for accurately guiding the enhancement of development efficiency. However, existing benchmarks usually fail to provide an assessment of sub-capabilities and focus solely on webpage generation outcomes. In this work, we draw inspiration from the principles of software engineering and further propose WebUIBench, a benchmark systematically designed to evaluate MLLMs in four key areas: WebUI Perception, HTML Programming, WebUI-HTML Understanding, and WebUI-to-Code. WebUIBench comprises 21K high-quality question-answer pairs derived from over 0.7K real-world websites.

While several methods tackle multi-hop queries by iteratively generating internal queries and retrieving external documents, these approaches are computationally expensive. In this paper, we identify a three-stage information processing pattern in LLMs during layer-by-layer reasoning, consisting of extraction, processing, and subsequent extraction steps. This observation suggests that the representations in intermediate layers contain richer information compared to those in other layers. Building on this insight, we propose Layer-wise RAG (L-RAG). Unlike prior methods that focus on generating new internal queries, L-RAG leverages intermediate representations from the middle layers, which capture next-hop information, to retrieve external knowledge. L-RAG achieves performance comparable to multi-step approaches while maintaining inference overhead similar to... | Linjiaen Linjiaen, Jingyu Liu, Yingbo Liu |  |

While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning, it struggles with non-English languages due to the entanglement of reasoning and execution. Program-of-Thought (PoT) prompting separates reasoning from execution, offering a promising alternative but shifting the challenge to generating programs from non-English questions. We propose a framework to evaluate PoT by separating multilingual reasoning from code execution to examine (i) the impact of fine-tuning on question-reasoning alignment and (ii) how reasoning quality affects answer correctness. Our findings demonstrate that PoT fine-tuning substantially enhances multilingual reasoning, outperforming CoT fine-tuned models. We further demonstrate a strong correlation between reasoning quality (measured through code quality) and answer accuracy, highlighting its potential as a test-time performance improvement... | Patomporn Payoungkhamdee, Pume Tuchinda, Jinheon Baek, Samuel Cahyawijaya, Can Udomcharoenchaikit, Potsawee Manakul, Peerat Limkonchotiwat, Ekapol Chuangsuwanich, Sarana Nutanong |  |

While manually designing tree annotation schemes significantly improves annotation quality for humans and models, their creation remains time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. We propose a fully automated pipeline that uses LLMs to construct such schemes and perform annotation. We evaluate our approach on speech functions (SFs) and the Switchboard-DAMSL (SWBD-DAMSL) taxonomies. Our experiments compare various design choices, and we show that frequency-guided decision trees, paired with an advanced LLM for annotation, can outperform previously manually designed trees and even match or surpass human annotators while significantly reducing the time required for annotation. We release all code and resultant schemes and annotations to facilitate future research on discourse annotation. | Kseniia Petukhova, Ekaterina Kochmar |  |

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have made the synthesis of analogical data possible, which, however, still heavily relies on extensive human efforts to be annotated. This paper empirically examines the LLMs’ capability to annotate story-level analogical data. Specifically, we propose a novel multi-stage progressive reasoning prompt framework A3E (Automated Analogy Annotation Expert), which is based on the structure mapping theory from cognitive psychology and efficiently annotates candidate story pairs across six fine-grained categories. We use A3E to evaluate how well the state-of-the-art LLMs can serve as analogy annotators. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed A3E achieves an average performance gain of + 73% across a range of prompting baselines and base LLMs. The code and data is available at https://github.com/zhangxjohn/A3E. | Xiaojing Zhang, Bochen Lyu |  |

However, this shared topology has not been systematically characterized, nor have its alternatives been thoroughly explored, leaving the problems of low data efficiency and unreliable generalization unaddressed. As a solution, we introduce a theory of \*\*reward generalization\*\* in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), focusing on the \*\*topology of information flow\*\* at both macro and micro levels. At the macro level, we portray the RLHF information flow as an autoencoding process over behavior distributions, formalizing the RLHF objective of distributional consistency between human preference and model behavior. At the micro level, we present \*induced Bayesian networks\* to model the impact of dataset topologies on reward generalization.

Existing methods mainly optimize instruction-response pairs but lack a systematic design for the underlying reasoning structure. This paper proposes RSS: a Reasoning Structure driven data Synthesis method. We first proactively develop a hierarchical GFlowNet to construct reasoning structures efficiently through a coarse-to-fine directed acyclic graph (DAG) growth process. Then reasoning DAGs are leveraged to actively guide the instruction generation via an iterative suggester-editor workflow and enhance response quality using a structure-aware strategy. Experiments show that LLMs trained on our synthetic datasets achieve 48.50%, 84.00%, 79.90% for AlpacaEval2, GSM8K and HumanEval, outperforming existing data synthesis methods. | Tianpeng Bu, Minying Zhang, Hongtao Duan, Shurui Li, Lulu Hu, Yu Li |  |

However, existing distillation methods model preference knowledge in teacher LLMs by comparing pairwise responses, overlooking the extent of difference between responses. This limitation hinders student SLMs from capturing the nuanced preferences for multiple responses. In this paper, we propose a Preference-Aligned Distillation (PAD) framework, which models teacher’s preference knowledge as a probability distribution over all potential preferences, thereby providing more nuanced supervisory signals. Our insight in developing PAD is rooted in the demonstration that language models can serve as reward functions, reflecting their intrinsic preferences. Based on this, PAD comprises three key steps: (1) sampling diverse responses using high-temperature; (2) computing rewards for both teacher and student to construct their intrinsic preference; and... | Yanggan Gu, Junzhuo Li, Sirui Huang, Xin Zou, Zhenghua Li, Xuming Hu |  |

TKPO extends the Bradley-Terry model from pair-wise to list-wise comparison, which is further applied at the token level for fine-grained preference signal utilization. In comparison to the representative methods, e.g., DPO, TKPO does not require response pairs; instead, we propose a controllable attributes-driven method to construct reject samples for self-alignment. Additionally, TKPO... | Zihao Li, Xuekong Xu, Ziyao Chen, Lixin Zou, Ethanhjwu Ethanhjwu, Qiang Chen, Chenliang Li |  |

Existing approaches primarily rely on reactive measures such as blocking or suspending offensive messages, with emerging strategies focusing on proactive measurements like detoxification and counterspeech. In our work, which we call HATEPRISM, we conduct a comprehensive examination of hate speech regulations and strategies from three perspectives: country regulations, social platform policies, and NLP research datasets. Our findings reveal significant inconsistencies in hate speech definitions and moderation practices across jurisdictions and platforms, alongside a lack of alignment with research efforts. Based on these insights, we suggest ideas and research direction for further exploration of a unified framework for automated hate speech moderation... | Naquee Rizwan, Seid Muhie Yimam, Daryna Dementieva, Florian Skupin, Tim Fischer, Daniil Moskovskiy, Aarushi Ajay Borkar, Robert Geislinger, Punyajoy Saha, Sarthak Roy, Martin Semmann, Alexander Panchenko, Chris Biemann, Animesh Mukherjee |  |

The reliance on the rolled-out trajectory renders the compute cost and time prohibitively high. In particular, the correctness of a reasoning trajectory can typically only be judged at its completion, leading to sparse rewards in RL or requiring expensive synthetic data generation in expert iteration-like methods. In this work, we focus on the Automatic Theorem Proving (ATP) task and propose a novel verifier-in-the-loop design, which, unlike existing approaches that leverage feedback on the entire reasoning trajectory, employs an automated verifier to give intermediate feedback at each step of the reasoning process. Using Lean as the verifier, we empirically show that the step-by-step local verification produces a global improvement in the... | Sara Rajaee, Kumar Pratik, Gabriele Cesa, Arash Behboodi |  |

However, differences in annotation standards lead to variations in building analysis tools, resulting in inconsistent analyses and limiting the generalizability of findings, especially in large-scale and cross-linguistic contexts. To address this issue, we collected all publicly available datasets (four in total) and conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the generalizability of various cross-linguistic models. The results indicate that models exhibit significant performance differences across datasets, highlighting the generalization problem. To mitigate this issue, we propose two solutions. First, we propose a multi-task learning model based on teacher student architecture solution, which demonstrates improved generalization performance in our experiments. Second, we introduce a new dataset (~5,000 samples) derived from reannotating existing open... | Hongzhi Qi, Nan Bai, Jianqiang Li, Wei Zhai, Qing Zhao, Qi Gao, Bing Xiang Yang, Guanghui Fu |  |

Prior research has localized and identified mechanisms behind knowledge recall; however, it has only focused on English monolingual models. The question of how these mechanisms generalize to non-English languages and multilingual LLMs remains unexplored. In this paper, we address this gap by conducting a comprehensive analysis of three multilingual LLMs. First, we show that previously identified recall mechanisms in English largely apply to multilingual contexts, with nuances based on language and architecture. Next, through patching intermediate representations, we localize the role of language during recall, finding that subject enrichment is language-independent, while object extraction is language-dependent. Additionally, we discover that the last token representation acts as a Function Vector (FV), encoding both the language of the query and the content to be extracted... | Constanza Fierro, Negar Foroutan, Desmond Elliott, Anders Søgaard |  |

In contrast to popular Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) methods, such as PPO and DPO, which are typically applied in single-step tasks, SeqPO-SiMT effectively tackles the multi-step SiMT task. This intuitive framework allows the SiMT LLMs to simulate and refine the SiMT process using a tailored reward. We conduct experiments on six datasets from diverse domains for En → Zh and Zh → En SiMT tasks, demonstrating that SeqPO-SiMT consistently achieves significantly higher translation quality with lower latency. In particular, SeqPO-SiMT outperforms the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) model by 1.13 points in COMET, while reducing the Average Lagging by 6.17 in... | Ting Xu, Zhichao Huang, Jiankai Sun, Shanbo Cheng, Wai Lam |  |

A Case Study of Yokai in Japanese Folktales](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.829/) |  | 0 | Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong language understanding and generation abilities across various languages, their cultural knowledge is often limited to English-speaking communities, which can marginalize the cultures of non-English communities. To address the problem, the evaluation of the cultural awareness of the LLMs and the methods to develop culturally aware LLMs have been investigated. In this study, we focus on evaluating knowledge of folktales, a key medium for conveying and circulating culture. In particular, we focus on Japanese folktales, specifically on knowledge of Yokai. Yokai are supernatural creatures originating from Japanese folktales that continue to be popular motifs in art and entertainment today. Yokai have long served as a medium for cultural expression, making them an ideal subject for assessing the cultural awareness of LLMs. We introduce YokaiEval, a benchmark dataset consisting of 809 multiple-choice questions (each with four... | Ayuto Tsutsumi, Yuu Jinnai |  |

This instability makes it difficult to provide solid conclusions to guide the training, especially for key experiments such as data ablation and scaling law. (2) Inconsistency between base and instruct models: base models generally exhibit poorer evaluation performance compared to corresponding instruct models. This gap poses a challenge for assessing whether a base model with better evaluation can truly lead to a better instruct model. To address these issues, we propose \*\*B\*\*ase model \*\*O\*\*riented \*\*S\*\*ystematic \*\*E\*\*valuation (\*\*BOSE\*\*), a method specifically designed to optimize the evaluation of base models. Specifically, BOSE introduces two key innovations: In-Context Light-instruction Prompt... | Hongzhi Luan, Changxin Tian, Zhaoxin Huan, Xiaolu Zhang, Kunlong Chen, Zhiqiang Zhang, Jun Zhou |  |

Researchers synthesized data with strong generation capabilities closed-source LLMs (i.e., GPT-4) under DP to alleviate this problem, but this method is not so flexible in fitting the given privacy distributions without fine-tuning. Besides, such methods can hardly balance the diversity of synthetic data and its relevance to target privacy data without accessing so much private data. To this end, this paper proposes DPGA-TextSyn, combining general LLMs with genetic algorithm (GA) to produce relevant and diverse synthetic text under DP constraints. First, we integrate the privacy gene (i.e., metadata) to generate better initial samples. Then, to achieve survival of... | Zhonghao Sun, Zhiliang Tian, Yiping Song, Yuyi Si, Juhua Zhang, Minlie Huang, Kai Lu, Zeyu Xiong, Xinwang Liu, Dongsheng Li |  |

However, most approaches, which blend the source model’s embedding by replacing the source vocabulary with the target language-specific vocabulary, may constrain expressive capacity in the target language since the source model is predominantly trained on English data. In this paper, we propose Semantic Aware Linear Transfer (SALT), a novel cross-lingual transfer technique that recycles embeddings from target language Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to transmit the deep representational strengths of PLM-derived embedding to LLMs. SALT derives unique regression lines based on the similarity in the overlap of the source and target vocabularies to handle each non-overlapping token’s embedding space. Our extensive experiments show that SALT significantly outperforms other transfer methods, achieving lower loss and faster... | Seungyoon Lee, Seongtae Hong, Hyeonseok Moon, Heuiseok Lim |  |

BDC integrates a Monte Carlo Tree-of-Agents algorithm, where multiple LLMs mutually verify and refine reasoning paths through reflection-guided pruning, enabling efficient exploration of high-quality solutions. To handle data diversity, we cluster problems by latent semantics, train composable LoRA experts on each cluster, and deploy an input-aware hypernetwork to dynamically merge these experts into tailored solvers. Experiments on APPS and CodeContest benchmarks demonstrate BDC’s superiority: it achieves up to 73.8% accuracy on hard problems, outperforming state-of-the-art methods like LATS and RethinkMCTS by 9–15%. This work lays the groundwork for advancing LLM capabilities in complex reasoning tasks, offering a novel System2-to-System1... | Kounianhua Du, Hanjing Wang, Jianxing Liu, Jizheng Chen, Xinyi Dai, Yasheng Wang, Ruiming Tang, Yong Yu, Jun Wang, Weinan Zhang |  |

Existing commonsense evaluations for LLMs primarily focus on downstream knowledge tasks, failing to probe whether LLMs truly understand and utilize knowledge or merely memorize it. They also rely heavily on human annotation and lack automated large-scale data generation. To address this, we propose to automatically construct a large benchmark named CoCo (Consistency of Commonsense) comprising 39K samples derived from commonsense knowledge graphs (CSKGs), paired with symbolic questions and ground-truth answers, which systematically assesses LLMs’ knowledge memorization, comprehension, and application and examines the consistency between these tasks. To enhance our evaluation, we also propose novel metrics and prompting strategies. Experimental results on multiple LLMs reveal that CoCo presents significant challenges, and our detailed analysis provides deeper insights into... | Guozheng Li, Peng Wang, Wenjun Ke, Zijie Xu, Jiajun Liu, Ziyu Shang |  |

However, encoders offer advantages such as lower computational and memory costs. Recent work adapts them for zero-shot generalization using Statement Tuning, which reformulates tasks into finite templates. We extend this approach to multilingual NLP, exploring whether encoders can achieve zero-shot cross-lingual generalization and serve as efficient alternatives to memory-intensive LLMs for low-resource languages. Our results show that state-of-the-art encoder models generalize well across languages, rivaling multilingual LLMs while being more efficient. We also analyze multilingual Statement Tuning dataset design, efficiency gains, and language-specific generalization, contributing to more inclusive and resource-efficient NLP models. We release our code and models. | Ahmed Elshabrawy, ThanhNhi Nguyen, Yeeun Kang, Lihan Feng, Annant Jain, Faadil Abdullah Shaikh, Jonibek Mansurov, Mohamed Fazli Mohamed Imam, JesúsGermán OrtizBarajas, Rendi Chevi, Alham Fikri Aji |  |

We propose an approach that enhances Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with a novel explicit dialogue planning phase, allowing robotic agents to systematically refine their understanding of ambiguous commands through structured clarification steps. This reduces hallucinations and improves task feasibility.To evaluate this approach, we introduce a novel dataset of over 1,100 annotated dialogues in English and Italian, designed for fine-tuning and assessing Multi-Modal models in HRI scenarios. Experimental results show that dialogue planning improves response accuracy and quality, and contributes to cross-lingual generalisation, enabling models trained in one language to transfer effectively to another. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of structured, goal-driven, and explicit dialogue... | Claudiu Daniel Hromei, Federico Borazio, Andrea Sensi, Elisa Passone, Danilo Croce, Roberto Basili |  |

Consequently, evaluations of large vision-language models (LVLMs) predominantly target high-resource languages, underscoring the need for evaluation data for low-resource languages. To address this limitation, we introduce MVL-SIB, a massively multilingual vision-language benchmark that evaluates both cross-modal and text-only topical matching across 205 languages – over 100 more than the most multilingual existing VL benchmarks encompass. We then benchmark a range of of open-weight LVLMs together with GPT-4o(-mini) on MVL-SIB. Our results reveal that LVLMs struggle in cross-modal topic matching in lower-resource languages, performing no better than chance on languages like N’Koo. Our analysis further reveals that VL support in LVLMs declines disproportionately relative to textual support for lower-resource languages, as evidenced by comparison of cross-modal and text-only topical matching... | Fabian David Schmidt, Florian Schneider, Chris Biemann, Goran Glavas |  |

However, it remains challenging for these agents to balance character portrayal utility with content safety because this essential character simulation often comes with the risk of generating unsafe content. To address this issue, we first conduct a systematic exploration of the safety-utility trade-off across multiple LLMs. Our analysis reveals that risk scenarios created by villain characters and user queries (referred to as risk coupling) contribute to this trade-off. Building on this, we propose a novel Adaptive Dynamic Multi-Preference (ADMP) method, which dynamically adjusts safety-utility preferences based on the degree of risk coupling and guides the model to generate responses biased toward utility or safety. We further introduce Coupling Margin Sampling (CMS) into coupling detection to enhance the model’s ability to handle... | Yihong Tang, Kehai Chen, Xuefeng Bai, ZhengYu Niu, Bo Wang, Jie Liu, Min Zhang |  |

Traditional sentiment analysis methods focus on static reviews, failing to capture the evolving temporal relationship between user sentiment rating and textual content. Sentiment analysis on streaming reviews addresses this limitation by modeling and predicting the temporal evolution of user sentiments. However, it suffers from data sparsity, manifesting in temporal, spatial, and combined forms. In this paper, we introduce SynGraph, a novel framework designed to address data sparsity in sentiment analysis on streaming reviews. SynGraph alleviates data sparsity by categorizing users into mid-tail, long-tail, and extreme scenarios and incorporating LLM-augmented enhancements within a dynamic graph-based structure. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate its effectiveness in addressing sparsity and improving sentiment modeling in streaming reviews. | Xin Zhang, Qiyu Wei, Yingjie Zhu, Linhai Zhang, Deyu Zhou, Sophia Ananiadou |  |

However, their effectiveness is frequently hampered by parameter mis-filling during tool calling. In this paper, we propose the Hierarchical Tool Error Checklist (HiTEC) framework to systematically diagnose and mitigate tool-calling errors without relying on extensive real-world interactions. HiTEC introduces a two-tiered approach: a global error checklist that identifies common, cross-tool issues, and a local error checklist that targets tool-specific and contextual failures. Building on this structure, we propose two deployments: HiTEC-In Context Learning (HiTEC-ICL) and HiTEC-Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (HiTEC-KTO). HiTEC-ICL embeds the global checklist in the initial prompts and leverages a two-round conversational interaction to dynamically refine parameter handling, while HiTEC-KTO generates high-quality negative examples to... | Yue Cui, Liuyi Yao, Shuchang Tao, Weijie Shi, Yaliang Li, Bolin Ding, Xiaofang Zhou |  |

BAREC consists of 69,441 sentences spanning 1+ million words, carefully curated to cover 19 readability levels, from kindergarten to postgraduate comprehension. The corpus balances genre diversity, topical coverage, and target audiences, offering a comprehensive resource for evaluating Arabic text complexity. The corpus was fully manually annotated by a large team of annotators. The average pairwise inter-annotator agreement, measured by Quadratic Weighted Kappa, is 81.8%, reflecting a high level of substantial agreement.Beyond presenting the corpus, we benchmark automatic readability assessment across different granularity levels, comparing a range of techniques.

However, training MedVLP models typically requires large-scale datasets with paired, high-quality image-text data, which are scarce in the medical domain. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and diffusion models have made it possible to generate large-scale synthetic image-text pairs. This raises the question: Can MedVLP succeed using purely synthetic data? To address this, we use off-the-shelf generative models to create synthetic radiology reports and paired Chest X-ray (CXR) images, and propose an automated pipeline to build a diverse, high-quality synthetic dataset, enabling a rigorous study that isolates model and training settings, focusing entirely from the data perspective.Our results show that MedVLP models trained exclusively on synthetic data outperform those trained on real data by 3.8% in averaged AUC on zero-shot... | Che Liu, Zhongwei Wan, Haozhe Wang, Yinda Chen, Talha Qaiser, Chen Jin, Nikolay Burlutskiy, Fariba Yousefi, Rossella Arcucci |  |

In this paper, we introduce the first factuality-based visual question-answering benchmark in Chinese, named ChineseSimpleVQA, aimed at assessing the visual factuality of LVLMs across 8 major topics and 56 subtopics. The key features of this benchmark include a focus on the Chinese language, diverse knowledge types, a multi-hop question construction, high-quality data, static consistency, and easy-to-evaluate through short answers. Moreover, we contribute a rigorous data construction pipeline and decouple the visual factuality into two parts: seeing the world (i.e., object recognition) and discovering knowledge. This decoupling allows us to analyze the capability boundaries and execution mechanisms of LVLMs. Subsequently, we evaluate 34 advanced open-source and closed-source... | Jihao Gu, Yingyao Wang, Pi Bu, Chen Wang, Ziming Wang, Tengtao Song, Donglai Wei, Jiale Yuan, Yingxiu Zhao, Yancheng He, Shilong Li, Jiaheng Liu, Meng Cao, Jun Song, Yingshui Tan, Xiang Li, Wenbo Su, Xiaoyong Zhu, Bo Zheng |  |

While CT scans are critical for clinical diagnostics, they remain less explored compared to 2D radiographs. To date, there has been no comprehensive benchmark for 3D radiograph report generation (3DRRG), nor sufficient investigation into the optimal training strategies for Vision Language Models (VLMs) in this context, particularly with respect to vision encoder choices, visual token compression, and model scaling.In this work, we make two three contributions. We curate CT-3DRRG, the largest publicly available 3D CT-report dataset, establishing a robust and diverse benchmark for evaluating VLM performance on 3DRRG. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive training recipe for building high-performing VLMs for 3DRRG, exploring key factors such as vision encoder pretraining strategies, visual token... | Che Liu, Zhongwei Wan, Yuqi Wang, Hui Shen, Haozhe Wang, Kangyu Zheng, Mi Zhang, Rossella Arcucci |  |

However, incorporating many documents and extended contexts poses challenges—such as hallucinations and semantic drift—for lightweight LLMs with fewer parameters. This work proposes a novel framework called DEC (Dynamic Enhancement Chain). DEC first decomposes complex questions into logically coherent subquestions to form a hallucination-free reasoning chain. It then iteratively refines these subquestions through context-aware rewriting to generate effective query formulations. For retrieval, we introduce a lightweight discriminative keyword extraction module that leverages extracted keywords to achieve targeted, precise document recall with relatively low computational overhead.

While previous studies have focused exclusively on single-context evaluation (e.g., discourse faithfulness or world factuality), real-world hallucinations typically involve mixed contexts, which remains inadequately evaluated. In this study, we use summarization as a representative task to comprehensively evaluate LLMs’ capability in detecting mixed-context hallucinations, specifically distinguishing between factual and non-factual hallucinations. Through extensive experiments across direct generation and retrieval-based models of varying scales, our main observations are: (1) LLMs’ intrinsic knowledge introduces inherent biases in hallucination evaluation; (2) These biases particularly impact the detection of factual hallucinations, yielding a significant performance bottleneck; and (3) the fundamental... | Siya Qi, Rui Cao, Yulan He, Zheng Yuan |  |

Despite the increasing support for multilingual capabilities in open-source and proprietary LLMs, the impact of backdoor attacks on these systems remains largely under-explored. Our research focuses on cross-lingual backdoor attacks against multilingual LLMs, particularly investigating how poisoning the instructiontuning data for one or two languages can affect the outputs for languages whose instructiontuning data were not poisoned. Despite its simplicity, our empirical analysis reveals that our method exhibits remarkable efficacy in models like BLOOM and GPT-4o, with high attack success rates, surpassing 90% in more than 7 out of 12 languages across various scenarios.

Prior attempts to interpret continuous prompts relied on projecting individual prompt tokens onto the vocabulary space. However, this approach is problematic as performant prompts can yield arbitrary or contradictory text, and it individually interprets each prompt token. In this work, we propose a new approach to interpret continuous prompts that elicits textual descriptions from their representations during model inference. Using a Patchscopes variant (Ghandeharioun et al., 2024) called InSPEcT over various tasks, we show our method often yields accurate task descriptions which become more faithful as task performance increases. Moreover, an elaborated version of InSPEcT reveals biased features in continuous prompts, whose presence correlates with biased model predictions.

Recent works have attempted to apply Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to enhance the performance of MLLMs, but have shown inconsistent improvements in mitigating hallucinations. To address this issue more effectively, we introduce Hallucination-targeted Direct Preference Optimization (HDPO) to reduce hallucinations in MLLMs. Unlike previous approaches, our method tackles hallucinations from their diverse forms and causes. Specifically, we develop three types of preference pair data targeting the following causes of MLLM hallucinations: (1) insufficient visual capabilities, (2) long context generation, and (3) multimodal conflicts. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across multiple hallucination evaluation datasets, surpassing most state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and highlighting the potential of our approach.

Existing methods for generating multi-turn dialogue data struggle to ensure both diversity and quality in instructions. To address this, we propose Review-Instruct, a novel framework that synthesizes multi-turn conversations through an iterative “Ask-Respond-Review” process involving three agent roles: a Candidate, multiple Reviewers, and a Chairman. The framework iteratively refines instructions by incorporating Reviewer feedback, enhancing dialogue diversity and difficulty. We construct a multi-turn dataset using the Alpaca dataset and fine-tune the LLaMA2-13B model.

Uncertainty Estimation (UE) quantifies the model’s confidence and helps users assess response reliability. However, existing UE methods have not been thoroughly examined in scenarios like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), where the input prompt includes non-parametric knowledge. This paper shows that current UE methods cannot reliably estimate the correctness of LLM responses in the RAG setting. We propose an axiomatic framework to identify deficiencies in existing UE methods. Our framework introduces five constraints that an effective UE method should meet after incorporating retrieved documents into the LLM’s prompt. Experimental results reveal that no existing UE method fully satisfies all the axioms, explaining their suboptimal performance in RAG. We further introduce a simple yet effective calibration function based on our... | Heydar Soudani, Evangelos Kanoulas, Faegheh Hasibi |  |

While automated fact-checking (AFC) has become essential in combating misinformation, most work in multilingual settings has focused on claim verification rather than generating explanatory verdicts (i.e. short texts discussing the veracity of the claim), leaving a gap in AFC resources beyond English.To this end, we introduce EuroVerdict, a multilingual dataset designed for verdict generation, covering eight European languages. Developed in collaboration with professional fact-checkers, the dataset comprises claims, manually written verdicts, and supporting evidence, including fact-checking articles and additional secondary sources. We evaluate EuroVerdict with Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct on verdict generation under different settings, varying the prompt language, input article language, and training approach.

However, the datasets used to train the LLMs typically exhibit a geographical bias towards English-speaking Western countries. This results in LLMs producing biased or hallucinated responses to queries that require answers localized to other geographical regions. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark named LoFTI (Localization and Factuality Transfer to Indian Locales) that can be used to evaluate an LLM’s contextual localization and factual text transfer capabilities. LoFTI consists of factual statements about entities in source and target locations; the source locations are spread across the globe and the target locations are all within India with varying degrees of hyperlocality (country, states, cities). The entities span a wide variety of categories. We use LoFTI to evaluate Mixtral, Llama3.3-70B, GPT-4 and two other Mixtral-based... | Sona Elza Simon, Soumen Kumar Mondal, Abhishek Singhania, Sayambhu Sen, Preethi Jyothi |  |

However, standardized documents (e.g., SEC filing) share similar formats such as repetitive boilerplate texts,and similar table structures. This similarity forces traditional RAG methods to misidentify near-duplicate text, leading to duplicate retrieval that undermines accuracy and completeness. To address these issues, we propose the Hierarchical Retrieval with Evidence Curation (HiREC) framework. Our approach first performs hierarchical retrieval to reduce confusion among similar texts. It first retrieve related documents and then selects the most relevant passages from the documents. The evidence curation process removes irrelevant passages. When necessary, it automatically generates complementary queries to collect missing information. To evaluate our approach, we construct and release a Large-scale Open-domain Financial... | Jaeyoung Choe, Jihoon Kim, Woohwan Jung |  |

Most recent approaches rely on costly LLM calls to generate executable relation paths or traverse the KG, which is inefficient in complex KGQA tasks, such as those involving multi-hop or multi-entity questions. We introduce the GNN-RAG framework, which utilizes lightweight Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for effective and efficient graph retrieval. The GNN learns to assign importance weights to nodes based on their relevance to the question, as well as the relevance of their neighboring nodes. This enables the framework to effectively handle context from deeper parts of the graph, improving retrieval performance. GNN-RAG retrieves the shortest paths connecting question entities to GNN answer candidates, providing this information as context for the LLM.

However, current automated RAG metrics perform poorly in clinical and conversational use cases. Using clinical human evaluations of responses is expensive, unscalable, and not conducive to the continuous iterative development of RAG systems. To address these challenges, we introduce ASTRID - an Automated and Scalable TRIaD for evaluating clinical QA systems leveraging RAG - consisting of three metrics: Context Relevance (CR), Refusal Accuracy (RA), and Conversational Faithfulness (CF). Our novel evaluation metric, CF, is designed to better capture the faithfulness of a model’s response to the knowledge base without penalising conversational elements.

Specifically, we quantify through cluster analysis of LM internal representations the extent to which mentions of the same entity cluster together and mentions of different entities remain separated.Our experiments examine five Transformer-based autoregressive models, showing that they effectively identify and distinguish entities with metrics analogous to precision and recall ranging from 0.66 to 0.9.Further analysis reveals that entity-related information is compactly represented in a low-dimensional linear subspace at early LM layers.Additionally, we clarify how the characteristics of entity representations influence word... | Masaki Sakata, Benjamin Heinzerling, Sho Yokoi, Takumi Ito, Kentaro Inui |  |

It requires not only the precise integration of facts but also the maintenance of thematic coherence throughout the article. Existing methods, such as multi-agent discussion, often struggle with issues like hallucinations, topic incoherence, and significant latency. To address these challenges, we propose RAPID, an efficient \*\*R\*\*etrieval-\*\*A\*\*ugmented long text generation framework with writing \*\*P\*\*lanning and \*\*I\*\*nformation \*\*D\*\*iscovery. RAPID consists of three main modules: (1) Retrieval-augmented preliminary outline generation to reduce hallucinations, (2) Attribute-constrained search for efficient information discovery, (3) Plan-guided article generation for enhanced coherence.

The task involves selecting the correct response from 6 options, including 5 manually crafted distractors, given the conversation history. Extensive benchmarking experiments with a diverse set of state-of-the-art open-weight LLMs show poor performance on CHARPEVAL due to their inability to effectively reason over discontinuous chunks of text across the input. Our analysis reveals systematic error patterns across models with different properties, highlighting the need to improve LLMs beyond simply scaling-up data and compute.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates these issues by integrating external dynamic information for improved factual grounding. With advances in multimodal learning, Multimodal RAG extends this approach by incorporating multiple modalities such as text, images, audio, and video to enhance the generated outputs. However, cross-modal alignment and reasoning introduce unique challenges beyond those in unimodal RAG. This survey offers a structured and comprehensive analysis of Multimodal RAG systems, covering datasets, benchmarks, metrics, evaluation, methodologies, and innovations in retrieval, fusion, augmentation, and generation. We review training strategies, robustness enhancements, loss functions, and agent-based approaches, while also exploring the diverse Multimodal RAG scenarios.

However, existing data annotation methods usually suffer from high annotation cost and the lack of effective automatic validation. To address these issues, we propose a Fine-grained Multi-Agent Debate framework (FMAD) and MMATH-Data, a dataset created by FMAD, which consists of 46K reasoning steps. By prompting multiple agents to debate, FMAD assesses the contribution of each reasoning step to the final solution, with labels based on the judge’s confidence score and the winner’s position. To facilitate reasoning in math and examine FMAD and MMATH-Data, we further propose two key components: a Multi-Agent Debate Reward Model (MRM) trained on MMATH-Data, which serves as a reward model to provide robust feedback during the optimization process, and MMATH-LLM, a model designed specifically for mathematical reasoning. MMATH-LLM is fine-tuned using reinforcement learning with supervised feedback from MRM,... | Shaowei Zhang, Deyi Xiong |  |

We propose a modular approach that resolves ambiguity using natural language interpretations before mapping these to logical forms (e.g., SQL queries). Although LLMs excel at parsing unambiguous utterances, they show strong biases for ambiguous ones, typically predicting only preferred interpretations. We constructively exploit this bias to generate an initial set of preferred disambiguations and then apply a specialized infilling model to identify and generate missing interpretations. To train the infilling model, we introduce an annotation method that uses SQL execution to validate different meanings. Our approach improves interpretation coverage and generalizes across datasets with different annotation styles, database structures, and ambiguity types. | Irina Saparina, Mirella Lapata |  |

For this task, transparency plays an important role for medical coders and regulatory bodies, which can be achieved using explainability methods. However, the evaluation of these approaches has been mostly limited to short text and binary settings due to a scarcity of annotated data. Recent efforts by Cheng et al. (2023) have introduced the MDACE dataset, which provides a valuable resource containing code evidence in clinical records. In this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the MDACE dataset and perform plausibility evaluation of current explainable medical coding systems from an applied perspective. With this, we contribute to a deeper understanding of automatic medical coding and evidence extraction. Our findings reveal that ground truth evidence aligns with code descriptions to a certain degree.

When dealing with high-resolution images, dominant LMMs typically divide them into multiple local images and a global image, leading to a large number of visual tokens. In this work, we introduce AVG-LLaVA, an LMM that can adaptively select the appropriate visual granularity based on the input image and instruction. Specifically, we first apply the multiple pooling layers to obtain visual tokens at different granularities. Then we propose a visual granularity router, which includes a Transformer layer, an MLP layer, and a voter layer, used to select the appropriate visual granularity based on the image and instruction. Furthermore, we put forward RGLF, a novel training paradigm that aims at aligning the granularity predicted by the router with the preferences of the LMM, without the need for additional manually annotated data. Extensive experiments and analysis show that AVG-LLaVA achieves superior... | Zhibin Lan, Liqiang Niu, Fandong Meng, Wenbo Li, Jie Zhou, Jinsong Su |  |

While advanced large language models (LLMs) exhibit similar abilities, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To investigate this, we conduct controlled experiments to analyze the roles of word form and contextual information in semantic reconstruction and examine LLM attention patterns. Specifically, we first propose SemRecScore, a reliable metric to quantify the degree of semantic reconstruction, and validate its effectiveness. Using this metric, we study how word form and contextual information influence LLMs’ semantic reconstruction ability, identifying word form as the core factor in this process. Furthermore, we analyze how LLMs utilize word form and find that they rely on specialized attention heads to extract and process word form information, with this... | Chenxi Wang, Tianle Gu, Zhongyu Wei, Lang Gao, Zirui Song, Xiuying Chen |  |

However, incorrect understanding of the sentence to be translated can degrade translation quality. To address this issue, we proposed a novel Iterative Bilingual Understanding Translation (IBUT) method based on the cross-lingual capabilities of LLMs and the dual characteristics of translation tasks. The cross-lingual capability of LLMs enables the generation of contextual understanding for both the source and target languages separately. Furthermore, the dual characteristics allow IBUT to generate effective cross-lingual feedback, iteratively refining contextual understanding, thereby reducing errors and improving translation performance. Experimental results showed that the proposed IBUT outperforms several strong comparison methods, especially being generalized to multiple domains (e.g., news, commonsense, and cultural translation benchmarks). | Andong Chen, Kehai Chen, Yang Xiang, Xuefeng Bai, Muyun Yang, Yang Feng, Tiejun Zhao, Min Zhang |  |

This work investigates a critical security vulnerability: attackers can steal prompt templates using only a limited number of sample images. To investigate this threat, we introduce Prism, a prompt-stealing benchmark consisting of 50 templates and 450 images, organized into Easy and Hard difficulty levels. To identify the vulnerabity of VLMs to prompt stealing, we propose EvoStealer, a novel template stealing method that operates without model fine-tuning by leveraging differential evolution algorithms. The system first initializes population sets using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) based on predefined patterns, then iteratively generates enhanced offspring through MLLMs. During evolution, EvoStealer identifies common features across offspring to derive generalized... | Yurong Wu, Fangwen Mu, Qiuhong Zhang, Jinjing Zhao, Xinrun Xu, Lingrui Mei, Yang Wu, Lin Shi, Junjie Wang, Zhiming Ding, Yiwei Wang |  |

We introduce Multilingual StyleDistance (mStyleDistance), a method that can generate style embeddings in new languages using synthetic data and a contrastive loss. We create style embeddings in nine languages and a multilingual STEL-or-Content benchmark (Wegmann et al., 2022) that serves to assess their quality. We also employ our embeddings in an authorship verification task involving different languages. Our results show that mStyleDistance embeddings outperform existing style embeddings on these benchmarks and generalize well to unseen features and languages. We make our models and datasets publicly available. | Justin Qiu, Jiacheng Zhu, Ajay Patel, Marianna Apidianaki, Chris CallisonBurch |  |

While existing research has demonstrated strong performance in single-instance or few-instance sequential editing and one-time massive editing scenarios, the batched sequential editing paradigm remains a significant challenge. The primary issue lies in the model’s tendency to gradually forget previously edited knowledge and become increasingly unstable after multiple iterations of batched editing. To address these challenges, we propose \*\*SeqMMR\*\*, an enhanced framework for batched sequential knowledge editing that leverages \*\*Seq\*\*uential \*\*M\*\*odel \*\*M\*\*erging and a model \*\*R\*\*outer.

This process iteratively generates self-reflection for self-training, fostering a continuous and self-evolving process. Leveraging this pipeline, we construct ReflectEvo-460k, a large-scale, comprehensive, self-generated reflection dataset with broadened instructions and diverse multi-domain tasks. Building upon this dataset, we demonstrate the effectiveness of reflection learning to improve SLMs’ reasoning abilities using SFT and DPO with remarkable performance, substantially boosting Llama-3 from 52.4% to 71.2% and Mistral from 44.4% to 71.1%. It validates that ReflectEvo can rival or even surpass the reasoning capability of the three prominent open-sourced models on BIG-bench without distillation from superior models or fine-grained human annotation.

However, existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often fall short in achieving human-like reasoning due to a lack of integrated commonsense knowledge, limiting their robustness and accuracy in real-world scenarios where both explicit facts and implicit understanding are crucial. To address this challenge, we present MAGIC-VQA: Multimodal And Grounded Inference with Commonsense Knowledge, a novel framework designed to enhance multimodal inference by integrating commonsense reasoning. MAGIC-VQA introduces a three-stage process: (1) Explicit Commonsense Knowledge Retrieval from external knowledge graphs, (2) By-Type Commonsense Knowledge Post-Processing to refine contextual relevance, and (3) Implicit Commonsense Knowledge Augmentation using a heterogeneous graph processed by a Graph Neural Network (GNN). These stages collectively enable nuanced, context-aware reasoning... | Shuo Yang, Caren Han, Siwen Luo, Eduard H. Hovy |  |

As NLP tasks become more complex and modularized, selecting the suitable LLM tier for each subtask is a key challenge to balance between cost and performance. To address the problem, we introduce LLM Automatic Transmission (LLM-AT) framework that automatically selects LLM tiers without training. LLM-AT consists of Starter, Generator, and Judge. The starter selects the initial LLM tier expected to solve the given question, the generator produces a response using the LLM of the selected tier, and the judge evaluates the validity of the response. If the response is invalid, LLM-AT iteratively upgrades to a higher-tier model, generates a new response, and re-evaluates until a valid response is obtained. Additionally, we propose accuracy estimator, which enables the suitable initial LLM tier selection without training. Given an input question, accuracy estimator estimates the expected accuracy of each LLM... | Injae Na, Keonwoong Noh, Woohwan Jung |  |

While LoRA ensures hardware efficiency, its low-rank weight updates limit adaptation performance. In this paper, we propose low-rank interconnected adaptation across layers (Lily), a novel PEFT method that introduces an interconnected framework with locally shared A and globally shared B experts. This structure eliminates redundant per-layer AB pairs, enabling higher-rank 𝛥 W with equal or fewer parameters. To enhance expressiveness, we use data-dependent routers to determine A-B interconnections, preventing B experts from converging to the same behavior and improving representational power across domains. Experiments across modalities, architectures, and model sizes demonstrate Lily’s superior performance and efficiency. | Yibo Zhong, Jinman Zhao, Yao Zhou |  |

Our benchmark contains 2366 questions of diverse complexity, dynamism, and topics, and includes over 35K annotated passages retrieved from both private document sets and the Web, to reflect real-world RAG use cases. This makes it an ideal test bed to evaluate an LLM’s ability to identify only the relevant information necessary to compose a response, or provide a deflective response when there is insufficient information. Evaluations of multiple state-of-the-art LLMs on GaRAGe show that the models tend to over-summarise rather than (a) ground their answers strictly on the annotated relevant passages (reaching at most a Relevance-Aware Factuality Score of 60%), or (b) deflect when no relevant grounding is available (reaching at most 31% true positive rate in... | IonutTeodor Sorodoc, Leonardo F.

However, learning effective difference representations is highly challenging due to distractors such as illumination and viewpoint changes. To address this, we propose a change-entity-guided disentanglement network that explicitly learns difference representations while mitigating the impact of distractors. Specifically, we first design a change entity retrieval module to identify key objects involved in the change from a textual perspective. Then, we introduce a difference representation enhancement module that strengthens the learned features, disentangling genuine differences from background variations. To further refine the generation process, we incorporate a gated Transformer decoder, which dynamically integrates both visual difference and textual change-entity information. Extensive experiments on CLEVR-Change, CLEVR-DC and Spot-the-Diff datasets demonstrate that our method... | Yi Li, Yunbin Tu, Liang Li, Li Su, Qingming Huang |  |

In the alignment process, reward models (RMs) act as a crucial proxy for human values to guide optimization. However, it remains unclear how to evaluate and select a reliable RM for preference alignment in RALMs. To this end, we propose RAG-RewardBench, the first benchmark for evaluating RMs in RAG settings. First, we design four crucial and challenging RAG-specific scenarios to assess RMs, including multi-hop reasoning, fine-grained citation, appropriate abstain, and conflict robustness. Then, we incorporate 18 RAG subsets, six retrievers, and 24 RALMs to increase the diversity of data sources. Finally, we adopt an LLM-as-a-judge approach to improve preference annotation efficiency and effectiveness, exhibiting a strong correlation with human annotations.... | Zhuoran Jin, Hongbang Yuan, Tianyi Men, Pengfei Cao, Yubo Chen, Jiexin Xu, Huaijun Li, Xiaojian Jiang, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao |  |

Existing methods either intervene LLMs only at inference without addressing their inherent limitations or overlook the potential for self-improvement. In this paper, we introduce GenDiE(Generate, Discriminate, Evolve), a novel self-evolving framework that enhances context faithfulness through fine-grained sentence-level optimization. GenDiE combines both generative and discriminative training, equipping LLMs with self-generation and self-scoring capabilities to facilitate iterative self-evolution. This supports both data construction for model alignment and score-guided search during inference. Furthermore, by treating each sentence in a response as an independent optimization unit, GenDiE effectively addresses the... | Kun Li, Tianhua Zhang, Yunxiang Li, Hongyin Luo, Abdalla Mohamed Salama Sayed Moustafa, Xixin Wu, James R.

Current paraphrase generators are typically evaluated using borrowed metrics from adjacent text-to-text tasks, like machine translation or text summarization. These metrics tend to have ties to the surface form of the reference text. This is not ideal for paraphrases as we typically want variation in the lexicon while persisting semantics. To address this problem, and inspired by learned similarity evaluation on plain text, we propose PAM, a Paraphrase AMR-Centric Evaluation Metric. This metric uses AMR graphs extracted from the input text, which consist of semantic structures agnostic to the text surface form, making the resulting evaluation metric more robust to variations in syntax or lexicon. Additionally, we evaluated PAM on different semantic textual similarity datasets and found that it improves the correlations with human semantic scores when compared to other AMR-based metrics. | Afonso Sousa, Henrique Lopes Cardoso |  |

However, existing MEL methods often rely on mention words as retrieval cues, which limits their ability to effectively utilize information from both images and text. This reliance causes MEL to struggle with accurately retrieving entities in certain scenarios, especially when the focus is on image objects or mention words are missing from the text. To solve these issues, we introduce a Visual Prompts guided Multimodal Entity Linking (VP-MEL) task. Given a text-image pair, VP-MEL aims to link a marked region (i.e., visual prompt) in an image to its corresponding entities in the knowledge base. To facilitate this task, we present a new dataset, VPWiki, specifically designed for VP-MEL. Furthermore, we propose a framework named IIER, which enhances visual feature... | Hongze Mi, Jinyuan Li, Zhangxuying Zhangxuying, Haoran Cheng, Jiahao Wang, Di Sun, Gang Pan |  |

In this paper, we emphasize methodological problems in current WSI evaluation. We propose an evaluation on a SemCor-derived dataset, respecting the original corpus polysemy and frequency distributions. We assess pre-trained embeddings and clustering algorithms across parts of speech, and propose and evaluate an LLM-based WSI method for English. We evaluate data augmentation sources (LLM-generated, corpus and lexicon), and semi-supervised scenarios using Wiktionary for data augmentation, must-link constraints, number of clusters per lemma.We find that no unsupervised method (whether ours or previous) surpasses the strong “one cluster per lemma” heuristic (1cpl).

One such field is journalism: LLMs are being used for summarization, generation and even fact-checking. However, in today’s political landscape, LLMs could accentuate tensions if they exhibit political bias. In this work, we evaluate the political bias of the most used 15 multilingual LLMs via the Political Compass Test. We test different scenarios, where we vary the language of the prompt, while also assigning a nationality to the model. We evaluate models on the 50 most populous countries and their official languages. Our results indicate that language has a strong influence on the political ideology displayed by a model. In addition, smaller models tend to display a more stable political ideology, i.e. ideology that is less affected by variations in the prompt. | Chadi Helwe, Oana Balalau, Davide Ceolin |  |

An Evaluation Benchmark for Large Audio-Language Models](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.884/) |  | 0 | Adversarial audio attacks pose a significant threat to the growing use of large audio-language models (LALMs) in voice-based human-machine interactions. While existing research focused on model-specific adversarial methods, real-world applications demand a more generalizable and universal approach to audio adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce the Chat-Audio Attacks (CAA) benchmark including four distinct types of audio attacks, which aims to explore the vulnerabilities of LALMs to these audio attacks in conversational scenarios. To evaluate the robustness of LALMs, we propose three evaluation strategies: Standard Evaluation, utilizing traditional metrics to quantify model performance under attacks; GPT-4o-Based Evaluation, which simulates real-world conversational complexities; and Human Evaluation, offering insights into user perception and trust. We evaluate six state-of-the-art LALMs with voice interaction capabilities, including Gemini-1.5-Pro, GPT-4o, and others,... | Wanqi Yang, Yanda Li, Meng Fang, Yunchao Wei, Ling Chen |  |

While researchers continue to advance the capabilities of SLMs through innovative training strategies and model compression techniques, the security risks of SLMs have received considerably less attention compared to large language models (LLMs). To fill this gap, we provide a comprehensive empirical study to evaluate the security performance of 13 state-of-the-art SLMs under various jailbreak attacks. Our experiments demonstrate that most SLMs are quite susceptible to existing jailbreak attacks, while some of them are even vulnerable to direct harmful prompts. To address the safety concerns, we evaluate several representative defense methods and demonstrate their effectiveness in enhancing the security of SLMs. We further analyze the potential security degradation caused by different SLM techniques including architecture... | Sibo Yi, Tianshuo Cong, Xinlei He, Qi Li, Jiaxing Song |  |

Therefore, this paper aims to extract clinical pathways from electronic medical records that encompass complete diagnostic and therapeutic logic, including temporal information, patient symptoms, diagnosis, and tests or treatments. To achieve this objective, we propose a novel clinical pathway representation: the clinical status pathway. We also design a LLM-based pipeline framework for extracting clinical status pathway from electronic medical records, with the core concept being to improve extraction accuracy by modeling the diagnostic and treatment processes. In our experiments, we apply this framework to construct a comprehensive breast cancer-specific clinical status pathway and evaluate its performance on medical question-answering and decision-support tasks, demonstrating... | Yifei Chen, Ruihui Hou, Jingping Liu, Tong Ruan |  |

We propose a transparent law reasoning schema enriched with hierarchical factum probandum, evidence, and implicit experience, enabling public scrutiny and preventing bias. Inspired by this schema, we introduce the challenging task, which takes a textual case description and outputs a hierarchical structure justifying the final decision. We also create the first crowd-sourced dataset for this task, enabling comprehensive evaluation. Simultaneously, we propose TL agent that employs a comprehensive suite of legal analysis tools to address the challenge task.

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) align with pre-trained vision encoders to enhance visual-language understanding, most existing methods rely on single-image analysis or rule-based heuristics to process multiple images, failing to fully leverage temporal information in multi-modal medical datasets. In this paper, we introduce \*\*Libra\*\*, a temporal-aware MLLM tailored for chest X-ray report generation. Libra combines a radiology-specific image encoder with a novel Temporal Alignment Connector (\*\*TAC\*\*), designed to accurately capture and integrate temporal differences between paired current and prior images. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-CXR dataset demonstrate that Libra establishes a new state-of-the-art benchmark among similarly scaled MLLMs, setting new standards in both clinical relevance and lexical accuracy.

This paper addresses bias and stereotype detection by exploring how jointly learning these tasks enhances model performance. We introduce StereoBias, a unique dataset labeled for bias and stereotype detection across five categories: religion, gender, socio-economic status, race, profession, and others, enabling a deeper study of their relationship. Our experiments compare encoder-only models and fine-tuned decoder-only models using QLoRA. While encoder-only models perform well, decoder-only models also show competitive results. Crucially, joint training on bias and stereotype detection significantly improves bias detection compared to training them separately. Additional experiments with sentiment analysis confirm that the improvements stem from the connection between bias and stereotypes, not multi-task learning alone. These findings highlight the value... | Aditya Tomar, V. Rudra Murthy, Pushpak Bhattacharyya |  |

However, publicly available corpora suitable for such analyses are scarce. The Project Gutenberg (PG) corpus presents a significant yet underutilized opportunity in this context, due to the absence of accurate temporal metadata. We take advantage of language models and information retrieval to explore four sources of information – Open Web, Wikipedia, Open Library API, and PG books texts – to add missing temporal metadata to the PG corpus. Through 20 experiments employing state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods, we estimate the production years of all PG books. We curate an enriched metadata repository for the PG corpus and propose a refined version for it, which includes 53,774 books with a total of 3.8 billion tokens in 11 languages, produced between 1600 and 2000.

In this paper, we introduce ExpliCa, a new dataset for evaluating LLMs in explicit causal reasoning. ExpliCa uniquely integrates both causal and temporal relations presented in different linguistic orders and explicitly expressed by linguistic connectives. The dataset is enriched with crowdsourced human acceptability ratings. We tested LLMs on ExpliCa through prompting and perplexity-based metrics. We assessed seven commercial and open-source LLMs, revealing that even top models struggle to reach 0.80 accuracy. Interestingly, models tend to confound temporal relations with causal ones, and their performance is also strongly influenced by the linguistic order of the events. Finally, perplexity-based scores and prompting performance are differently affected by model size. | Martina Miliani, Serena Auriemma, Alessandro Bondielli, Emmanuele Chersoni, Lucia C.

However, existing approaches often lack logical consistency, as they rely on static reward structures or ignore the intricate dependencies within multi-step reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose a method that integrates natural logic principles into reinforcement learning, enabling dynamic reward computation to guide entailment tree generation. Our approach ensures logical consistency across reasoning steps while improving interpretability and generalization. Experiments on EntailmentBank demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the effectiveness of natural logic in structured reasoning. | Jihao Shi, Xiao Ding, Kai Xiong, Hengwei Zhao, Bing Qin, Ting Liu |  |

Existing privacy attacks primarily focus on membership inference attacks (MIAs) or data extraction attacks, but reconstructing specific personally identifiable information (PII) in LLMs’ training data remains challenging. In this paper, we propose (Recollect and Rank), a novel two-step privacy stealing attack that enables attackers to reconstruct PII entities from scrubbed training data where the PII entities have been masked. In the first stage, we introduce a prompt paradigm named recollection, which instructs the LLM to repeat a masked text but fill in masks. Then we can use PII identifiers to extract recollected PII candidates. In the second stage, we design a new criterion to score each PII candidate and rank them. Motivated by membership inference, we leverage the reference model as a calibration to our criterion. Experiments across three popular PII... | Wenlong Meng, Guo Zhenyuan, Lenan Wu, Chen Gong, Wenyan Liu, Weixian Li, Chengkun Wei, Wenzhi Chen |  |

Drawing inspiration from butterfly metamorphosis—where structured developmental phases (Phase I: larval nutrient accumulation → Phase II: pupal transformation) enable adaptive evolution—we propose Nested-Refinement Metamorphosis (NeRM). Building on this principle, we introduce Metamorphosis on Prompts (MoP) to iteratively refine task descriptions (e.g. latency / bandwidth constraints) and Metamorphosis on Algorithms (MoA) to generate more effective solutions (e.g. appropriate network processing architecture). Their nested refinement ensures task-algorithm alignment, systematically improving both task descriptions and algorithmic solutions for more efficient algorithm design. To further enhance efficiency, we incorporate predictor-assisted code evaluation, mimicking natural selection by filtering out weak candidates early and reducing computational... | Shuhan Guo, Nan Yin, James Kwok, Quanming Yao |  |

Many benchmark has been proposed for researching multimodal knowledge editing. However, previous benchmarks focus on limited scenarios due to the lack of rigorous definition of multimodal knowledge. To better evaluate multimodal knowledge editing, we propose a decomposed definition of multimodal knowledge. Following the decomposed definition of multimodal knowledge, we introduce three scenarios and a novel requirement modality consistency. We construct MC-MKE, a fine-grained \*\*M\*\*ultimodal \*\*K\*\*nowledge \*\*E\*\*diting benchmark emphasizing \*\*M\*\*odality \*\*C\*\*onsistency through strict data selection.

Zeroth-Order (ZO) optimisation uses function evaluations instead of gradients, reducing memory usage, but suffers from slow convergence in high-dimensional models. As a result, ZO research in LLMs has mostly focused on classification, overlooking more complex generative tasks. In this paper, we introduce ZOPrO, a novel ZO algorithm designed for \*Preference Optimisation\* in LLMs. We begin by analysing the interplay between policy and reward models during traditional (first-order) Preference Optimisation, uncovering patterns in their relative updates. Guided by these insights, we adapt Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) with a targeted sampling strategy to accelerate convergence. Through experiments on summarisation, machine translation, and conversational assistants, we demonstrate that our method consistently enhances reward signals while... | Alessio Galatolo, Zhenbang Dai, Katie Winkle, Meriem Beloucif |  |

Although metaphor processing has gained significant attention in Natural Language Processing (NLP), previous research has been limited to single-dataset evaluations and specific task settings, often using artificially constructed data through lexical replacement. We address these limitations by conducting extensive experiments using diverse publicly available datasets with inference and metaphor annotations, focusing on Natural Language Inference (NLI) and Question Answering (QA) tasks. The results indicate that LLMs’ performance is more influenced by features like lexical overlap and sentence length than by metaphorical content, demonstrating that any alleged emergent abilities of LLMs to understand metaphorical language are the result of a combination of surface-level features, in-context learning,... | Elisa SanchezBayona, Rodrigo Agerri |  |

Existing MT error detection and quality estimation (QE) techniques do not address this practical scenario. We introduce AskQE, a question generation and answering framework designed to detect critical MT errors and provide actionable feedback, helping users decide whether to accept or reject MT outputs even without the knowledge of the target language. Using ContraTICO, a dataset of contrastive synthetic MT errors in the COVID-19 domain, we explore design choices for AskQE and develop an optimized version relying on LLaMA-3 70B and entailed facts to guide question generation. We evaluate the resulting system on the BioMQM dataset of naturally occurring MT errors, where AskQE has higher Kendall’s Tau correlation and decision accuracy with human ratings compared to other QE metrics. | Dayeon Ki, Kevin Duh, Marine Carpuat |  |

This paper addresses the challenge of evaluating personalized text generation by introducing ExPerT, an explainable reference-based evaluation framework. ExPerT leverages an LLM to extract atomic aspects and their evidences from the generated and reference texts, match the aspects, and evaluate their alignment based on content and writing style—two key attributes in personalized text generation. Additionally, ExPerT generates detailed, fine-grained explanations for every step of the evaluation process, enhancing transparency and interpretability. Our experiments demonstrate that ExPerT achieves a 7.2% relative improvement in alignment with human judgments compared to the state-of-the-art text generation evaluation methods. Furthermore, human evaluators rated... | Alireza Salemi, Julian Killingback, Hamed Zamani |  |

To tackle above limitations, we propose \*\*Associa\*\*, a graph-structured memory framework that mimics human cognitive processes. Associa comprises an event-centric memory graph and two collaborative components: \*\*Intuitive Association\*\*, which extracts evidence-rich subgraphs through Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree optimization, and \*\*Deliberating Recall\*\*, which iteratively refines queries for comprehensive evidence collection. Experiments show that Associa significantly outperforms existing methods in retrieval and QA (question and answering) tasks across long-term dialogue benchmarks, advancing the development of more human-like AI memory systems. | Yujie Zhang, Weikang Yuan, Zhuoren Jiang |  |

However, natural language is inherently redundant and unstructured, making it unsuitable for modeling high-order neighbors with LLMs. Specifically, (i) graph descriptions become verbose, overwhelming LLMs, and (ii) only relying on attribute embeddings limits LLM’s ability to capture the adequate graph structural information. These limitations make it difficult to model graphs both concisely and adequately using sole natural language with LLMs.Inspired by the observation that LLMs pre-trained on one language can achieve exceptional performance on another with minimal additional training, we propose Graph-Defined Language for Large Language Model (GDL4LLM).

However, existing real-task-based long-context evaluation benchmarks have a few major shortcomings. For instance, some Needle-in-a-Haystack-like benchmarks are too synthetic, and therefore do not represent the real world usage of LLMs. While some real-task-based benchmarks like LongBench avoid this problem, such benchmarks are often formed in a way where each data sample has a fixed sequence length, which not only makes them solely suitable for models with a certain range of context windows, but also lacks a proxy to know at what length the model/method-of-interest would fail. Last, most benchmarks tend to not provide proper metrics to separate long-context performance from the model’s baseline... | Van Yang, Hongye Jin, Shaochen Zhong, Song Jiang, Qifan Wang, Vipin Chaudhary, Xiaotian Han |  |

VTS is also critical to various downstream video understanding tasks. Traditional VTS methods using shallow features or unsupervised approaches struggle to accurately discern the nuances of topical transitions. Recently, supervised approaches have achieved superior performance on video action or scene segmentation over unsupervised approaches. In this work, we improve supervised VTS by thoroughly exploring \*\*multimodal fusion\*\* and \*\*multimodal coherence modeling\*\*. Specifically, (1) we enhance multimodal fusion by exploring different architectures using Cross-Attention and Mixture of Experts.

However, a significant disparity exists between benchmark performances and real-world applications. We attribute this gap primarily to current evaluation protocols and metrics, which inadequately capture the full spectrum of LLM capabilities, especially in complex reasoning tasks where both accuracy and consistency are essential. In this paper, we introduce \*\*G-Pass@\*\*k, a novel evaluation metric that continuously assesses model performance across multiple sampling attempts, quantifying both the model’s performance potential and its stability.

However, the annotation of instruction datasets has traditionally been expensive and laborious, often relying on manual annotations or costly proprietary LLMs. Recent works explore approaches to synthesize data with open-sourced LLMs but require high-quality human-crafted seed data. In this work, we introduce , an end-to-end framework to synthesize high-quality instruction data with open-sourced LLMs and sampled unlabeled documents, eliminating the necessity for seed data. Starting from diverse pre-screened documents, the framework synthesizes complex and diverse high-quality instruction and response pairs in different stages. We propose a tagging-based prompt method to generate diverse and complex seed data and a UCB-based approach to augment more instruction data with the seed data.

Though parallel and comparable corpora for Biomedical Text Simplification have been introduced, these conflate the many syntactic and lexical operations involved in simplification. To enable more targeted development and evaluation, we present a fine-grained lexical simplification task and dataset, Jargon Explanations for Biomedical Simplification (JEBS). The JEBS task involves identifying complex terms, classifying how to replace them, and generating replacement text. The JEBS dataset contains 21,595 replacements for 10,314 terms across 400 biomedical abstracts and their manually simplified versions. Additionally, we provide baseline results for a variety of rule-based and transformer-based systems for the three subtasks.

However, a rigorous and detailed comparison of the two spaces for this task is lacking. In this paper, through a simple integration of hyperbolic representations with an encoder-decoder model, we perform a controlled and comprehensive set of experiments to compare the capacity of hyperbolic space versus Euclidean space in multi-hop reasoning. Our results show that the former consistently outperforms the latter across a diverse set of datasets. In addition, through an ablation study, we show that a learnable curvature initialized with the delta hyperbolicity of the utilized data yields superior results to random initializations. Furthermore, our findings suggest that hyperbolic representations can be significantly more advantageous when the datasets exhibit a more hierarchical structure. | Simon Welz, Lucie Flek, Akbar Karimi |  |

However, these models still suffer from hallucinations and clinically significant errors, limiting their reliability in real-world applications. In this study, we propose Look & Mark (L&M), a novel grounding fixation strategy that integrates radiologist eye fixations (Look) and bounding box annotations (Mark) into the LLM prompting framework. Unlike conventional fine-tuning, L&M leverages in-context learning to achieve substantial performance gains without retraining. When evaluated across multiple domain-specific and general-purpose models, L&M demonstrates significant gains, including a 1.2% improvement in overall metrics (A.AVG) for CXR-LLaVA compared to baseline prompting and a remarkable 9.2% boost for LLaVA-Med.

While NLP research has investigated the impact of language evolution on model training and has proposed several solutions for it, its impact on model benchmarking remains under-explored. Yet, hate speech benchmarks play a crucial role to ensure model safety. In this paper, we empirically evaluate the robustness of 20 language models across two evolving hate speech experiments, and we show the temporal misalignment between static and time-sensitive evaluations. Our findings call for time-sensitive linguistic benchmarks in order to correctly and reliably evaluate language models in the hate speech domain. | Chiara Di Bonaventura, Barbara McGillivray, Yulan He, Albert MeroñoPeñuela |  |

We present Tag-Instruct, a novel framework that enhances instruction complexity through structured semantic compression and controlled difficulty augmentation. Unlike previous prompt-based methods operating on raw text, Tag-Instruct compresses instructions into a compact tag space and systematically enhances complexity through RL-guided tag expansion. Through extensive experiments, we show that Tag-Instruct outperforms existing instruction complexity augmentation approaches. Our analysis reveals that operating in tag space provides superior controllability and stability across different instruction synthesis frameworks. | He Zhu, Zhiwen Ruan, Junyou Su, Xingwei He, Yun Chen, Wenjia Zhang, Guanhua Chen |  |

However, code from real-world users is often poorly styled, containing various types of noise, such as structural inconsistencies, stylistic deviations and flawed test cases. To investigate this, we first simulate poorly styled code using eight types of code perturbations, and then demonstrate that the debugging performance of existing LLM-based methods significantly declines on such inputs. Furthermore, to address this, we propose a novel debugging method called Code-SPA, which aligns noisy code with the well-structured style familiar to LLMs, mitigating the impact of stylistic inconsistencies. Specifically, Code-SPA extracts the model’s preferred coding style from a reference snippet, then adjusts the input code by Concrete Syntax Tree (CST)-based transformations and LLM-assisted refinements before debugging. By aligning the code style preference, Code-SPA... | Tengfei Wen, Xuanang Chen, Ben He, Le Sun |  |

Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether state-of-the-art LLMs can infer the author of an anonymous research paper solely from the text, without any additional information. To investigate this novel challenge, which we define as Open-World Authorship Attribution, we introduce a benchmark comprising thousands of research papers across various fields to quantitatively assess model capabilities. Then, at the core of this paper, we tailor a two-stage framework to tackle this problem: candidate selection and authorship decision. Specifically, in the first stage, LLMs are prompted to generate multi-level key information, which are then used to identify potential candidates through Internet searches. In the second stage, we introduce key perspectives to guide LLMs in determining the most likely author from these candidates. Extensive experiments on our benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed... | Xinhao Tan, Songhua Liu, Xia Cong, Kunjun Li, Xinchao Wang |  |

Mitigating Name Bias in Text Embedding Similarity via Anonymization](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.914/) |  | 0 | Text-embedding models often exhibit biases arising from the data on which they are trained. In this paper, we examine a hitherto unexplored bias in text-embeddings: bias arising from the presence of names such as persons, locations, organizations etc. in the text. Our study shows how the presence of name-bias in text-embedding models can potentially lead to erroneous conclusions in the assessment of thematic similarity. Text-embeddings can mistakenly indicate similarity between texts based on names in the text, even when their actual semantic content has no similarity or indicate dissimilarity simply because of the names in the text even when the texts match semantically. We first demonstrate the presence of name bias in different text-embedding models and then propose text-anonymization during inference which involves removing references to names, while preserving the core theme of the text. The efficacy of the anonymization approach is demonstrated on three downstream NLP tasks... | Sahil Manchanda, Pannaga Shivaswamy |  |

Despite advancements, limited research has explored their numerical reasoning capabilities in these languages. To address this gap, we present BenNumEval (Bengali Numerical Evaluation), a benchmark designed to assess LLMs on numerical reasoning tasks in Bengali. It comprises six diverse tasks and a total of 3.2k samples curated from real-world problem-solving scenarios. Our extensive evaluations reveal that even with advanced prompting techniques such as Cross-Lingual Prompting (XLP) and Cross-Lingual Chain-of-Thought Prompting (XCoT), LLMs fall notably short of human-level performance, particularly when using Bengali Native Prompting (BNaP).

Given a user request, PeopleJoin agents must identify teammates who might be able to assist, converse with these teammates to gather information, and finally compile a useful answer or summary for the original user. PeopleJoin comprises two evaluation domains: PeopleJoin-QA, focused on questions about tabular data, and PeopleJoin-DocCreation, focused on document creation tasks. The two domains are adapted from existing NLP benchmarks for database question answering and multi-document summarization; here, however, the information needed to complete these tasks is distributed across synthetic “organizations” of 2–20 users, simulating natural multi-user collaboration scenarios. We implemented several popular LM agent architectures, evaluating their accuracy and efficiency at completing tasks, and highlight new research questions that can be studied using PeopleJoin. | Harsh Jhamtani, Jacob Andreas, Benjamin Van Durme |  |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise, their size and high inference costs limit deployment on resource-constrained devices. Small Language Models (SLMs) provide a more efficient alternative for edge devices, but bridging the recommendation performance gap between LLMs and SLMs remains challenging. Typical approaches like supervised fine-tuning or vanilla knowledge distillation (KD) often lead to suboptimal performance or even negative transfer. Our motivational experiments reveal key issues with vanilla KD methods: feature imitation suffers from redundancy and uneven recommendation ability across layers, while prediction mimicking faces conflicts caused by differing weight distributions of prediction heads. To address these challenges, we propose a simple yet effective framework, C2KD, to transfer task-relevant knowledge from two... | Xiao Chen, Changyi Ma, Wenqi Fan, Zhaoxiang Zhang, Qing Li |  |

While existing methods have been proposed to translate natural language descriptions into visualization queries, they focus solely on spoken languages, overlooking sign languages, which comprise about 200 variants used by 70 million Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) individuals. To fill this gap, this paper proposes Sign2Vis, a sign language interface that enables the DHH community to engage more fully with data analysis. We first construct a paired dataset that includes sign language pose videos and their corresponding visualization queries. Using this dataset, we evaluate a variety of models, including both pipeline-based and end-to-end approaches. Extensive experiments, along with a user study involving 15 participants, demonstrate the effectiveness of Sign2Vis. Finally, we share key insights from our evaluation and highlight the... | Yao Wan, Yang Wu, Zhen Li, Guobiao Zhang, Hongyu Zhang, Zhou Zhao, Hai Jin, April Wang |  |

In this work, we introduce Context-Prior Augmented Citation Generation task, requiring models to generate citations considering both external and internal knowledge while providing trustworthy references, with 5 evaluation metrics focusing on 3 aspects: answer helpfulness, citation faithfulness, and trustworthiness. We introduce RAEL, the paradigm for our task, and also design INTRALIGN, an integrated method containing customary data generation and an alignment algorithm. Our experimental results show that our method achieves a better cross-scenario performance with regard to other baselines. Our extended experiments further reveal that retrieval quality, question types, and model knowledge have considerable influence on the... | Jiajun Shen, Tong Zhou, Yubo Chen, Delai Qiu, Shengping Liu, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao |  |

Visual Language Action (VLA) models, pretrained on large-scale web datasets, have shown promise in decision-making tasks. However, previous work has primarily focused on action post-training, often neglecting enhancements to the foundation model itself. In response, we introduce Act from Visual Language Post-Training (ActVLP), a novel training paradigm. ActVLP distinctively enhances the foundation model prior to action-specific tuning by first post-training it on a curated set of environment-specific visual and linguistic tasks using self-supervised learning. This initial stage significantly improves the model’s capabilities in world knowledge, visual recognition, and spatial grounding. Subsequently, this strengthened VLM undergoes action post-training via imitation learning on trajectory datasets.Following this paradigm, we develop JARVIS-VLA, the first VLA model in Minecraft that can... | Muyao Li, Zihao Wang, Kaichen He, Xiaojian Ma, Yitao Liang |  |

Perceiving lengthy videos containing thousands of frames poses substantial computational burden. To mitigate this issue, this paper introduces Generative Frame Sampler (GenS), a plug-and-play module integrated with VideoLLMs to facilitate efficient lengthy video perception. Built upon a lightweight VideoLLM, GenS leverages its inherent vision-language capabilities to identify question-relevant frames. To facilitate effective retrieval, we construct GenS-Video-150K, a large-scale video instruction dataset with dense frame relevance annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GenS consistently boosts the performance of various VideoLLMs, including open-source models (Qwen2-VL-7B, Aria-25B, LLaVA-Video-7B/72B) and proprietary assistants (GPT-4o, Gemini). When equipped with GenS, open-source VideoLLMs achieve impressive state-of-the-art... | Linli Yao, Haoning Wu, Kun Ouyang, Yuanxing Zhang, Caiming Xiong, Bei Chen, Xu Sun, Junnan Li |  |

While there have already been a number of annotation campaigns, they have been based on heuristic guidelines, which have never been thoroughly discussed. Here, we present the first systematic analysis of a complex annotation task -detecting 22 persuasion techniques in memes-, for which we provided continuous expert oversight. The presence of an expert allowed us to critically analyze specific aspects of the annotation process. Among our findings, we show that inter-annotator agreement alone inadequately assessed annotation correctness. We thus define and track different error types, revealing that expert feedback shows varying effectiveness across error categories. This pattern suggests that distinct mechanisms underlie different kinds of misannotations. Based on our findings, we advocate for an expert oversight in annotation tasks and periodic quality audits.

Despite the recent traction of KD research, its effectiveness for smaller language models (LMs) and the mechanisms driving knowledge transfer remain underexplored. In this work, we present the first large-scale empirical and statistical analysis of KD across models ranging from 0.5B to 7B parameters on 14 complex reasoning tasks in a zero-shot setting. Our findings reveal that KD can improve the average performance of smaller models by up to 10%, with a peak task specific gain of 22%, while providing only marginal benefits (∼ 1.3%) for larger models. Surprisingly, teacher performance has a minimal impact on student outcomes, while teacher task expertise impacts KD effectiveness. A correlation study indicates that smaller LMs benefit more from KD, whereas larger LMs show diminished gains. Additionally, we uncover a misalignment between improvements in... | Suhas Kamasetty Ramesh, Ayan Sengupta, Tanmoy Chakraborty |  |

These challenges arise from the absence of uncertainty quantification and the inability of current models to adapt to diverse authorship tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce BEDAA, a Bayesian-Enhanced DeBERTa framework that integrates Bayesian reasoning with transformer-based language models to enable uncertainty-aware and interpretable authorship attribution. BEDAA achieves up to 19.69% improvement in F1-score across multiple authorship attribution tasks, including binary, multiclass, and dynamic authorship detection. By incorporating confidence ranking, uncertainty decomposition, and probabilistic reasoning, BEDAA improves robustness while offering transparent decision-making processes. Furthermore, BEDAA extends beyond traditional AA by... | Iqra Zahid, Youcheng Sun, Riza BatistaNavarro |  |

In this work, we perform a reproducibility study on 8 tasks and 29 datasets, testing 6 models. We find that many tasks rely heavily on surface-level keyword patterns rather than deeper semantic or contextual understanding. Moreover, we find that 96% of the datasets contain annotation issues, with 16.6% of the sampled wrong predictions of a zero-shot classifier being actually clear annotation mistakes, and 38.8% being ambiguous examples.These results call into question the reliability of current benchmarks to meaningfully compare models and highlight the need for improved annotation practices. We conclude by outlining actionable recommendations to enhance dataset quality and evaluation robustness. | Tom Calamai, Oana Balalau, Fabian M. Suchanek |  |

We find that 74% of ACL abstracts and 88% of news articles contain some form of anthropomorphic description of AI technology. Further, we train a regression classifier based on BERT, demonstrating that we can automatically label abstracts for their degree of anthropomorphism based on our corpus. We conclude by applying this labelling process to abstracts available in the entire history of the ACL Anthology and reporting on diachronic and inter-venue findings, showing that the degree of anthropomorphism is increasing at all examined venues over time. | Matthew Shardlow, Ashley Williams, Charlie Roadhouse, Filippos Ventirozos, Piotr Przybyla |  |

However, systematically evaluating how well these assistants apply personalization—adapting to individual user preferences while completing tasks—remains challenging. Existing personalization benchmarks focus on chit-chat, non-conversational tasks, or narrow domains, failing to capture the complexities of personalized task-oriented assistance. To address this, we introduce PersonaLens, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating personalization in task-oriented AI assistants. Our benchmark features diverse user profiles equipped with rich preferences and interaction histories, along with two specialized LLM-based agents: a user agent that engages in realistic task-oriented dialogues with AI assistants, and a judge agent that employs the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm to assess personalization, response quality, and task success. Through extensive experiments with current LLM assistants across diverse tasks, we reveal... | Zheng Zhao, Clara Vania, Subhradeep Kayal, Naila Khan, Shay B. Cohen, Emine Yilmaz |  |

However, the defect of recommendation algorithms may put users in very vulnerable positions under this paradigm. First, many sophisticated models are often designed with commercial objectives in mind, focusing on the platform’s benefits, which may hinder their ability to protect and capture users’ true interests. Second, these models are typically optimized using data from all users, which may overlook individual user’s preferences. Due to these shortcomings, users may experience several disadvantages under the traditional user-platform direct exposure paradigm, such as lack of control over the recommender system, potential manipulation by the platform, echo chamber effects, or lack of personalization for less active users due to the dominance of active users during collaborative learning. Therefore, there is an urgent... | Wujiang Xu, Yunxiao Shi, Zujie Liang, Xuying Ning, Kai Mei, Kun Wang, Xi Zhu, Min Xu, Yongfeng Zhang |  |

To verify LLM-generated contents and claims from other sources, traditional verification approaches often rely on holistic models that assign a single factuality label to complex claims, potentially obscuring nuanced errors. In this paper, we advocate for a shift towards fine-grained verification, where complex claims are broken down into smaller sub-claims for individual verification, allowing for more precise identification of inaccuracies, improved transparency, and reduced ambiguity in evidence retrieval. However, generating sub-claims poses challenges, such as maintaining context and ensuring semantic equivalence with respect to the original claim. We introduce \*\*FactLens\*\*, a benchmark for evaluating fine-grained fact verification, with metrics and automated evaluators... | Kushan Mitra, Dan Zhang, Sajjadur Rahman, Estevam Hruschka |  |

Human-annotated preference data is used for training to further improve LLMs’ performance, which is constrained by the upper limit of human performance. Therefore, Self-Rewarding method has been proposed, where LLMs generate training data by rewarding their own outputs. However, the existing self-rewarding paradigm is not effective in mathematical reasoning scenarios and may even lead to a decline in performance. In this work, we propose the Process-based Self-Rewarding pipeline for language models, which introduces long-thought reasoning, step-wise LLM-as-a-Judge, and step-wise preference optimization within the self-rewarding paradigm. Our new paradigm successfully enhances the performance of LLMs on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks through iterative Process-based Self-Rewarding, demonstrating the immense potential of... | Shimao Zhang, Xiao Liu, Xin Zhang, Junxiao Liu, Zheheng Luo, Shujian Huang, Yeyun Gong |  |

In XLT for token classification tasks, however, these strategies include label projection, the challenging step of mapping the labels from each token in the original sentence to its counterpart(s) in the translation. Although word aligners (WAs) are commonly used for label projection, the low-level design decisions for applying them to translation-based XLT have not been systematically investigated. Moreover, recent marker-based methods, which project labeled spans by inserting tags around them before (or after) translation, claim to outperform WAs in label projection for XLT. In this work, we revisit WAs for label projection, systematically investigating the effects of low-level design decisions on... | Benedikt Ebing, Goran Glavas |  |

Recent advancements in LLM-based moderation methods, e.g., LlamaGuard, have demonstrated remarkable promise in identifying safety risks associated with both inputs and outputs in human-AI interactions. However, integrating LLM-based safeguards into a chatbot system requires an additional inference stage involving a moderation LLM with billions of parameters, which significantly increases computational costs and reduces overall efficiency. In this paper, we demonstrate that simply learning a classification head on the last-layer hidden states of the dialogue model provides a strong capability to identify harmful contents. The classification head, referred to as ShieldHead, serves as an auxiliary branch paralleled with next-token-prediction LM head, enabling the detection of potential risks in past text... | Zitao Xuan, Xiaofeng Mao, Da Chen, Xin Zhang, Yuhan Dong, Jun Zhou |  |

Unlike traditional false content, LLM-generated misinformation can be self-reinforcing, highly plausible, and capable of rapid propagation across multiple languages, which traditional detection methods fail to mitigate effectively. This paper introduces a proactive defense paradigm, shifting from passive post hoc detection to anticipatory mitigation strategies. We propose a Three Pillars framework: (1) Knowledge Credibility, fortifying the integrity of training and deployed data; (2) Inference Reliability, embedding self-corrective mechanisms during reasoning; and (3) Input Robustness, enhancing the resilience of model interfaces against adversarial attacks. Through a comprehensive survey of existing techniques and a comparative meta-analysis, we demonstrate that proactive defense strategies offer up to 63% improvement... | Shuliang Liu, Hongyi Liu, Aiwei Liu, Bingchen Duan, Zheng Qi, Yibo Yan, He Geng, Peijie Jiang, Jia Liu, Xuming Hu |  |

In this paper, we attempt to analyze its lexicon using modern large language models (LLMs), based on surviving literary sources. We construct a structured dictionary of the language, grouped by synonyms and word origins. Subsequently, we use this dictionary to formulate hypotheses about the core principles of word formation and grammatical structure in Russenorsk and show which hypotheses generated by large language models correspond to the hypotheses previously proposed ones in the academic literature. We also develop a “reconstruction” translation agent that generates hypothetical Russenorsk renderings of contemporary Russian and Norwegian texts. | Alexey Tikhonov, Sergei Shteiner, Anna Bykova, Ivan P.

However, the scarcity of sufficiently challenging problems, particularly at the Olympiad level, hinders further advancements. In this work, we introduce PromptCoT, a novel approach for automatically generating high-quality Olympiad-level math problems. The proposed method synthesizes complex problems based on mathematical concepts and the rationale behind problem construction, emulating the thought processes of experienced problem designers. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that an optimal rationale should maximize both the likelihood of rationale generation given the associated concepts and the likelihood of problem generation conditioned on both the rationale and the concepts. Our method is evaluated on standard benchmarks including GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME2024, where it consistently outperforms existing... | Xueliang Zhao, Wei Wu, Jian Guan, Lingpeng Kong |  |

In this paper, we establish a surprising connection between speculative sampling and the concept of channel simulation from information theory, which aims at simulating a noisy channel using as few bits as possible. This connection allows us to provide an information-theoretic analysis of the speed up that can be achieved by speculative sampling. Leveraging this link, we derive an explicit relation between generation speed-up and the number of tokens k generated by the draft model for large k, which serves as an upper bound for all k. We also propose a novel speculative sampling method via exponential races called ERSS that matches state-of-the-art performance. | Szymon Kobus, Deniz Gündüz |  |

Although this approach may provide a reliable estimation of translation quality, it can lead to misleading values of latency metrics due to an inherent assumption that average latency values are good enough estimators of SimulST systems’ response time. However, our detailed analysis of latency evaluations for state-of-the-art SimulST systems demonstrates that latency distributions are often skewed and subject to extreme variations. As a result, the mean in latency metrics fails to capture these anomalies, potentially masking the lack of robustness in some systems and metrics. In this paper, a thorough analysis of the results of systems submitted to recent editions of the IWSLT simultaneous track is provided to support our hypothesis and... | Jorge IranzoSánchez, Javier IranzoSánchez, Adrià Giménez, Jorge Civera |  |

However, evaluating RPAs is challenging due to diverse task requirements and agent designs.This paper proposes an evidence-based, actionable, and generalizable evaluation design guideline for LLM-based RPA by systematically reviewing 1,676 papers published between Jan. 2021 and Dec. 2024.Our analysis identifies six agent attributes, seven task attributes, and seven evaluation metrics from existing literature.Based on these findings, we present an RPA evaluation design guideline to help researchers develop more systematic and consistent evaluation methods. | Chaoran Chen, Bingsheng Yao, Ruishi Zou, Wenyue Hua, Weimin Lyu, Toby JiaJun Li, Dakuo Wang |  |

A prominent case of such heterogeneous data is personal information: user devices log vast amounts of data every day, such as calendar entries, workout statistics, shopping records, streaming history, and more. Information needs range from simple look-ups to queries of analytical nature. The challenge is to provide humans with convenient access with small footprint, so that all personal data stays on the user devices. We present ReQAP, a novel method that creates an executable operator tree for a given question, via recursive decomposition. Operators are designed to enable seamless integration of structured and unstructured sources, and the execution of the operator tree yields a traceable answer. We further release the PerQA benchmark, with persona-based data and questions, covering a diverse spectrum of realistic user needs. | Philipp Christmann, Gerhard Weikum |  |

While prior research has extensively analyzed summarization models, little attention has been given to the role of document characteristics in influencing summarization performance.In this work, we explore two key research questions. First, do documents exhibit consistent summarization quality across multiple systems? If so, can we predict a document’s summarization performance without generating a summary? We answer both questions affirmatively and introduce PreSumm, a novel task in which a system predicts summarization performance based solely on the source document. Our analysis sheds light on common properties of documents with low PreSumm scores, revealing that they often suffer from coherence issues, complex content, or a lack of a clear main theme.In addition, we demonstrate PreSumm’s practical utility in two key applications:... | Steven Koniaev, Ori Ernst, Jackie CK Cheung |  |

However, current retrieval methods often retrieve these two types of knowledge in isolation without considering their mutual reinforcement and existing hybrid methods even bypass structural retrieval entirely. To fill this gap, we propose a Mixture of Structural-and-Textual Retrieval (MoR) to retrieve these two types of knowledge via a Planning-Reasoning-Organizing framework. In the Planning stage, MoR generates textual planning graphs delineating the logic for answering queries. Following planning graphs, in the Reasoning stage, MoR interweaves structural traversal and textual matching to obtain candidates from TG-KBs. In the Organizing stage, MoR further reranks fetched candidates based on their structural trajectory. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of MoR in harmonizing structural and textual retrieval with inspiring... | Yongjia Lei, Haoyu Han, Ryan A.

Precise Interpretations of Language Models for Fact Completion](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.942/) |  | 0 | Language models (LMs) can make a correct prediction based on many possible signals in a prompt, not all corresponding to recall of factual associations. However, current interpretations of LMs fail to take this into account. For example, given the query “Astrid Lindgren was born in” with the corresponding completion “Sweden”, no difference is made between whether the prediction was based on knowing where the author was born or assuming that a person with a Swedish-sounding name was born in Sweden. In this paper, we present a model-specific recipe - PrISM - for constructing datasets with examples of four different prediction scenarios: generic language modeling, guesswork, heuristics recall and exact fact recall. We apply two popular interpretability methods to the scenarios: causal tracing (CT) and information flow analysis. We find that both yield distinct results for each scenario. Results for exact fact recall and generic language modeling scenarios confirm previous conclusions... | Denitsa Saynova, Lovisa Hagström, Moa Johansson, Richard Johansson, Marco Kuhlmann |  |

Weight-only quantization is a promising method to address the memory-bound limitations. Previous studies have followed one of two approaches. Some have exclusively studied integer quantization while ignoring the Gaussian distribution nature of LLMs’ weights. Others have proposed non-uniform quantization but incurred additional I/O overhead due to lookup tables, e.g. NF4. In this work, we extend the IEEE 754 float-point standard to the ExMy quantization schema, which allocates x bit for the exponent and y bit for the mantissa to represent a number. In terms of runtime efficiency, we demonstrate that the conversion from ExMy to FP16 can be realized through register-level operations, which can get almost the same performance as INT5. In terms of quantization loss, we analyze that of different ExMy settings, where the... | Ke Yi, Jianwei Zhang, Zhiying Xu, Xinlong Yang, Yang Zhou, Minmin Sun, Zengke Liu, Tong Zhang, Junyang Lin, Jingren Zhou |  |

Existing work in LLM-based MMT typically mitigates this issue via scaling up training and computation budget, which raises a critical question: Is scaling up the training and computation budget truly necessary for high-quality MMT, or can a deeper understanding of CoM provide a more efficient solution? To explore this problem, we analyze the linguistic conflicts and synergy, the underlying mechanism of CoM during post-training phase. We identify an asymmetric phenomenon in linguistic conflicts and synergy: the dominance of conflicts and synergy varies in different translation directions, leading to sub-optimal adaptation in existing post-training methods. We further find that a significant bottleneck in MMT appears to lie in post-training rather than multilingual pre-training, suggesting the need for more effective... | Tong Zheng, Yan Wen, Huiwen Bao, Junfeng Guo, Heng Huang |  |

However, the noble goal of helping visual content creators by suggesting meaningful sequences of visual assets from a limited collection is challenging. It requires a nuanced understanding of visual assets and the integration of open-world knowledge to support creative exploration. Despite its importance, this task has yet to be explored fully in existing literature. To fill this gap, we propose Visual Story Ideation, a novel and underexplored task focused on the automated selection and arrangement of visual assets into coherent sequences that convey expressive storylines.We also present VISIAR, Visual Ideation through Sequence Integration and Asset Rearrangement, a robust framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), and a novel Story Graph mechanism.

To further investigate how transcripts impact volatility, we introduce DEC, a dataset featuring accurate volatility calculations enabled by the previously overlooked beforeAfterMarket attribute and dense ticker coverage. Unlike established benchmarks, where each ticker has only around two earnings, DEC provides 20 earnings records per ticker. Using DEC, we reveal that post-earnings volatility undergoes significant shifts, with each ticker displaying a distinct volatility distribution. To leverage historical post-earnings volatility and capture ticker-specific patterns, we propose two training-free baselines: Post-earnings Volatility (PEV) and Same-ticker Post-earnings Volatility (STPEV). These baselines surpass all transcripts-based models on DEC as well as on established benchmarks.... | Ding Yu, Zhuo Liu, Hangfeng He |  |

These instruments have taken the form of datasets, metrics, tools, and more. In this paper, we examine the extent to which such instruments meet the needs of practitioners tasked with evaluating LLM-based systems. Via semi-structured interviews with 12 such practitioners, we find that practitioners are often unable to use publicly available instruments for measuring representational harms. We identify two types of challenges. In some cases, instruments are not useful because they do not meaningfully measure what practitioners seek to measure or are otherwise misaligned with practitioner needs. In other cases, instruments-even useful instruments-are not used by practitioners due to practical and institutional barriers impeding their uptake. Drawing on measurement theory and pragmatic measurement, we provide recommendations... | Emma Harvey, Emily Sheng, Su Lin Blodgett, Alexandra Chouldechova, Jean GarciaGathright, Alexandra Olteanu, Hanna M.

As LLMs are increasingly used in multi-agent systems for societal simulations, their ability to model fundamental group psychological characteristics remains critical yet under-explored. In this study, we present a multi-agent framework that simulates belief congruence, a classical group psychology theory that plays a crucial role in shaping societal interactions and preferences. Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit amplified belief congruence compared to humans, across diverse contexts. We further investigate the implications of this behavior on two downstream tasks: (1) misinformation dissemination and (2) LLM learning, finding that belief congruence in LLMs increases misinformation dissemination and impedes learning. To mitigate these negative impacts, we propose strategies inspired by: (1) contact hypothesis, (2) accuracy nudges, and (3) global citizenship... | Angana Borah, Marwa Houalla, Rada Mihalcea |  |

Existing approaches primarily rely on fine-tuning-based methods, which can be categorized into gradient ascent-based (GA-based) and suppression-based methods. However, they often degrade model utility (the ability to respond to normal prompts). In this work, we aim to develop a general framework that enhances the utility of fine-tuning-based unlearning methods. To achieve this goal, we first investigate the common property between GA-based and suppression-based methods. We unveil that GA-based methods unlearn by distinguishing the target data (i.e., the data to be removed) and suppressing related generations—essentially the same strategy employed by suppression-based methods. Inspired by this finding, we introduce Gated Representation UNlearning (GRUN) which has two components: a soft gate function for distinguishing target data and a suppression module using Representation... | Jie Ren, Zhenwei Dai, Xianfeng Tang, Hui Liu, Jingying Zeng, Zhen Li, Rahul Goutam, Suhang Wang, Yue Xing, Qi He |  |

While open-ended question answering tasks are more challenging to evaluate, MCQA tasks are, in principle, easier to assess, as the model’s answer is thought to be simple to extract and is compared directly to a set of predefined choices. However, recent studies have started to question the reliability of MCQA evaluation, showing that multiple factors can significantly impact the reported performance of LLMs, especially when the model generates free-form text before selecting one of the answer choices. In this work, we shed light on the inconsistencies of MCQA evaluation strategies, which can lead to inaccurate and misleading model comparisons. We systematically analyze whether existing answer extraction methods are aligned with human judgment, and how they are influenced by answer constraints in the prompt across different domains. Our experiments demonstrate... | Francesco Maria Molfese, Luca Moroni, Luca Gioffrè, Alessandro Scirè, Simone Conia, Roberto Navigli |  |

The results provide an unclear picture of the current state of the art, with some finding near-human performance and others near-zero. To make sense of this landscape, we perform a survey of 16 recent studies aimed at measuring ToM in LMs and find that, while almost all perform checks for human identifiable issues, less than half do so for patterns only a machine might exploit. Among those that do perform such validation, which we call machine validation, none identify LMs to exceed human performance. We conclude that the datasets that show high LM performance on ToM tasks are easier than their peers, likely due to the presence of spurious patterns in the data, and we caution against building ToM benchmarks relying solely on human validation of the data. | Adil Soubki, Owen Rambow |  |

However, further pushing the compression ratio fails to deliver performance gains. In this work, we revisit these approaches by considering, additionally, adaptive KV methods that retain LLM accuracy with only a subset of KV states. This leads us to propose a method based on 2-bit KV cache quantization with adaptive KV policies. In addition, we take an algorithm and system co-design approach by developing hardware-friendly kernels to accelerate LLM inference while making MiniKV compatible with existing memory-efficient attention techniques such as FlashAttention, effectively translating algorithmic improvements into system performance gains. Experiments on a wide range of long context tasks show that MiniKV effectively achieves >80% KV cache compression while retaining accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods while... | Akshat Sharma, Hangliang Ding, Jianping Li, Neel Dani, Minjia Zhang |  |

However, most existing studies focus on a single domain, such as biomedicine. With the rise of interdisciplinary research, it is increasingly necessary to comprehend knowledge spanning multiple technical fields. To address this, we propose Sci-LoRA, a model that leverages a mixture of LoRAs fine-tuned on multiple scientific domains. In particular, Sci-LoRA dynamically generates and applies weights for each LoRA, enabling it to adjust the impact of different domains based on the input text, without requiring explicit domain labels. To balance domain-specific knowledge and generalization across various domains, Sci-LoRA integrates information at both the data and model levels. This dynamic fusion enhances the adaptability and performance across various domains. Experimental results across twelve domains on five public datasets show that Sci-LoRA significantly outperforms... | Ming Cheng, Jiaying Gong, Hoda Eldardiry |  |

We assess language models’ sensitivity to ambiguity by introducing an adversarial ambiguity dataset that includes syntactic, lexical, and phonological ambiguities along with adversarial variations (e.g., word-order changes, synonym replacements, and random-based alterations). Our findings show that direct prompting fails to robustly identify ambiguity, while linear probes trained on model representations can decode ambiguity with high accuracy, sometimes exceeding 90%. Our results offer insights into the prompting paradigm and how language models encode ambiguity at different layers. | Antonia Karamolegkou, Oliver Eberle, Phillip Rust, Carina Kauf, Anders Søgaard |  |

In this study, we demonstrate that intrinsic biases in VLM representations systematically “carry over” or propagate into zero-shot retrieval tasks, revealing how deeply rooted biases shape a model’s outputs. We introduce a controlled framework to measure this propagation by correlating (a) intrinsic measures of bias in the representational space with (b) extrinsic measures of bias in zero-shot text-to-image (TTI) and image-to-text (ITT) retrieval. Results show substantial correlations between intrinsic and extrinsic bias, with an average 𝜌 = 0.83 ± 0.10. This pattern is consistent across 114 analyses, both retrieval directions, six social groups, and three distinct VLMs. Notably, we find that larger/better-performing models exhibit greater bias propagation, a finding that raises concerns given the trend... | Kshitish Ghate, Tessa Charlesworth, Mona T.

However, the detailed reasoning process in CoT often incurs long generation times and high computational costs, partly due to the inclusion of unnecessary steps. To address this, we propose a method to identify critical reasoning steps using perplexity as a measure of their importance: a step is deemed critical if its removal causes a significant increase in perplexity. Our method enables models to focus solely on generating these critical steps. This can be achieved through two approaches: refining demonstration examples in few-shot CoT or fine-tuning the model using selected examples that include only critical steps. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method, which achieves a better balance between the reasoning accuracy and efficiency of CoT. | Yingqian Cui, Pengfei He, Jingying Zeng, Hui Liu, Xianfeng Tang, Zhenwei Dai, Yan Han, Chen Luo, Jing Huang, Zhen Li, Suhang Wang, Yue Xing, Jiliang Tang, Qi He |  |

An Empirical Study on Information-Seeking QA over Scientific Papers](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.957/) |  | 0 | This paper introduces MISS-QA, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the ability of models to interpret schematic diagrams within scientific literature. MISS-QA comprises 3,000 expert-annotated examples over 983 scientific papers. In this benchmark, models are tasked with interpreting schematic diagrams that illustrate research overviews and answering corresponding information-seeking questions based on the broader context of the paper. To ensure reliable and consistent evaluation, we propose an automated evaluating protocol powered by open-source LLMs trained on human-scored data. We assess the performance of 18 frontier multimodal foundation models, including o1, Claude-3.5, Llama-3.2-Vision, and Qwen2-VL. We reveal a significant performance gap between these models and human experts on MISS-QA. Our analysis of model performance on unanswerable questions and our detailed error analysis further highlight the strengths and limitations of current models, offering key... | Yilun Zhao, Chengye Wang, Chuhan Li, Arman Cohan |  |

MultiChallenge identifies four categories of challenges in multi-turn conversations that are not only common and realistic among current human-LLM interactions, but are also challenging to all current frontier LLMs. All 4 challenges require accurate instruction-following, context allocation, and in-context reasoning at the same time.We also develop LLM as judge with instance-level rubrics to facilitate an automatic evaluation method with fair agreement with experienced human raters. Despite achieving near perfect scores on existing multi-turn evaluation benchmarks, all frontier models have less than 50% accuracy on MultiChallenge, with the top-performing Claude 3.5 Sonnet (October 2024) achieving just a 41.4% average accuracy. | Kaustubh Deshpande, Ved Sirdeshmukh, Johannes Baptist Mols, Lifeng Jin, EdYeremai HernandezCardona, Dean Lee, Jeremy Kritz, Willow E.

Beyond this, PII may be added or removed from training datasets due to evolving dataset curation techniques, because they were newly scraped for retraining, or because they were included in a new downstream fine-tuning stage. We find that the amount and ease of PII memorization is a dynamic property of a model that evolves throughout training pipelines and depends on commonly altered design choices. We characterize three such novel phenomena: (1) similar-appearing PII seen later in training can elicit memorization of earlier-seen sequences in what we call assisted memorization, and this is a significant factor (in our settings, up to 1/3); (2) adding PII can increase memorization of other PII; and (3) removing PII can lead to other PII being memorized. | Jaydeep Borkar, Matthew Jagielski, Katherine Lee, Niloofar Mireshghallah, David A.

While they are effective for direct adversarial attacks, they fall short of broader safety challenges requiring nuanced, context-aware decision-making. To address this, we propose Reasoning-enhanced Fine-Tuning for interpretable LLM Safety (RATIONAL), a novel framework that trains models to engage in explicit safe reasoning before response. Fine-tuned models leverage the extensive pretraining knowledge in self-generated reasoning to bootstrap their own safety through structured reasoning, internalizing context-sensitive decision-making. Our findings suggest that safety extends beyond refusal, requiring context awareness for more robust, interpretable, and adaptive responses.

Context-dependent form-meaning systematicity in LLMs](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.961/) |  | 0 | We investigate static and contextualized embeddings for English pseudowords across a variety of Large Language Models (LLMs), to study (i) how these models represent semantic attributes of strings they encounter for the very first time and how (ii) these representations interact with sentence context. We zoom in on a key semantic attribute, valence, which plays an important role in theories of language processing, acquisition, and evolution. Across three experiments, we show that pseudoword valence is encoded in meaningful ways both in isolation and in context, and that, in some LLMs, pseudowords affect the representation of whole sentences similarly to words. This highlights how, at least for most LLMs we surveyed, pseudowords and words are not qualitatively different constructs. Our study confirms that LLMs capture systematic mappings between form and valence, and shows how different LLMs handle the contextualisation of pseudowords differently. Our findings provide a first... | Jaïr A Waal, Giovanni Cassani |  |

Questions remain about leveraging synthetic data for other use cases, such as adapting LLMs to specific domains. A key limitation of synthetic data is low diversity, which negatively impacts its downstream applicability for improving other models. To address this, we propose MetaSynth, a method for generating synthetic data that enhances diversity through meta-prompting, where a language model orchestrates multiple “expert” LLM agents to collaboratively generate data. Using only 25 million tokens of synthetic data generated with MetaSynth, we successfully adapt a well-trained LLM (Mistral-7B) to two specialized domains–Finance and Biomedicine–without compromising the capabilities of the resulting model in general tasks. In addition, we evaluate the diversity of our synthetic data using seven automated metrics, and find that it approaches the diversity of LLM... | Haris Riaz, Sourav Sanjukta Bhabesh, Vinayak Arannil, Miguel Ballesteros, Graham Horwood |  |

However, their vulnerability to adversarial tampering and manipulations remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce MVTamperBench, a benchmark that systematically evaluates MLLM robustness against five prevalent tampering techniques: rotation, masking, substitution, repetition, and dropping; based on real-world visual tampering scenarios such as surveillance interference, social media content edits, and misinformation injection. MVTamperBench comprises ~3.4K original videos, expanded into over ~17K tampered clips covering 19 distinct video manipulation tasks. This benchmark challenges models to detect manipulations in spatial and temporal coherence. We evaluate 45 recent MLLMs from 15+ model families.

To bridge this gap, we propose the Multimodal Inconsistency Reasoning (MMIR) benchmark to assess MLLMs’ ability to detect and reason about semantic mismatches in artifacts such as webpages, presentation slides, and posters. MMIR comprises 534 challenging samples, each containing synthetically injected errors across five reasoning-heavy categories: Factual Contradiction, Identity Misattribution, Contextual Mismatch, Quantitative Discrepancy, and Temporal/Spatial Incoherence. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art MLLMs, showing that models with dedicated multimodal reasoning capabilities, such as o1, substantially outperform their counterparts while open-source models remain particularly vulnerable to inconsistency errors.

While cross-modal entity linking is a fundamental skill needed for real-world applications such as multimodal code generation, fake news detection, or scene understanding, it has not been thoroughly studied in the literature. In this paper, we introduce a new task and benchmark to address this gap. Our benchmark, MATE, consists of 5.5k evaluation instances featuring visual scenes aligned with their textual representations. To evaluate cross-modal entity linking performance, we design a question-answering task that involves retrieving one attribute of an object in one modality based on a unique attribute of that object in another modality. We evaluate state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and humans on this task, and find that VLMs struggle significantly compared to humans, particularly as the number of objects in the scene increases.

Identity, one of the most divisive issues in modern politics, oftenincreases polarization. Yet, prior NLP research has mostly treated toxicity and polarization asseparate problems. In Indonesia, the world’s third-largest democracy, this dynamic threatens democratic discourse, particularly in online spaces. We argue that polarization and toxicity must be studied in relation to each other. To this end, we present a novel multi-label Indonesian dataset annotated for toxicity, polarization, and annotator demographic information. Benchmarking with BERT-base models and large language models (LLMs) reveals that polarization cues improve toxicity classification and vice versa. Including demographic context further enhances polarization classification performance. | Lucky Susanto, Musa Izzanardi Wijanarko, Prasetia Anugrah Pratama, Zilu Tang, Fariz Akyas, Traci Hong, Ika Karlina Idris, Alham Fikri Aji, Derry Tanti Wijaya |  |

Meanwhile, we introduce a novel multi-pass retrieval-citation method that generates high-quality citations.Our extensive evaluation highlights the challenges and opportunities of citation generation for medical tasks, while identifying important design choices that have a significant impact on the final citation quality. Our proposed method achieves superior citation precision and recall improvements compared to strong baseline methods, and we show that our evaluation results correlate well with annotation results from professional experts. | Xiao Wang, Mengjue Tan, Qiao Jin, Guangzhi Xiong, Yu Hu, Aidong Zhang, Zhiyong Lu, Minjia Zhang |  |

However, fairness concerns arise in many in-context classification tasks, especially when predictions involve sensitive attributes. To address this, we propose JUDGE—a simple yet effective framework for selecting fair and representative demonstrations that improve group fairness in In-Context Learning. JUDGE constructs the demonstration set iteratively using a greedy approach, guided by a small, carefully selected jury set. Our method remains robust across varying LLM architectures and datasets, ensuring consistent fairness improvements. We evaluate JUDGE on four datasets using four LLMs, comparing it against seven baselines. Results show that JUDGE consistently improves fairness metrics without compromising accuracy. | Sadaf Md.

Dynamic strategies are needed to combat homoglyphs as the Unicode library is ever-expanding and new substitution possibilities for Latin letters continuously emerge. The present study investigated two novel mitigation approaches that do not rely on strict mappings but instead harness the power of large language models to neutralize both known and unknown homoglyphs: (1) indirectly normalizing homoglyphs by replacing non-Latin characters with a delimiter and prompting large language models to “fill in the blanks” and (2) directly normalizing homoglyphs by using large language models to determine which characters should be replaced with Latin letters. We found that GPT-4o-mini constructed normalized text with an average cosine similarity score of 0.91 to the original tweets when applying our indirect method and 0.96 to the original tweets when applying our direct... | Portia Cooper, Eduardo Blanco, Mihai Surdeanu |  |

Politeness detection is a task that exemplifies this interest. While those techniques perform well on the task when applied to data from the same domain as the training data, they lack generalizability and thus fall short when applied to data from other domains. This is due to their reliance on discovering domain-specific word-level features. We introduce a method for improving the generalizability of explainable politeness models by relying on speech act patterns instead of words, leveraging speech act labels assigned by the GPT-4 model. This approach goes beyond the mere words and injects intent into politeness classification models, enhancing their generalizability. Results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy... | Ahmad Aljanaideh |  |

In this study, we systematically evaluate a range of Transformer-LMs to predict psychological variables across five major dimensions: affect, substance use, mental health, sociodemographics, and personality. Analyses span three temporal levels—short daily text responses about current affect, text aggregated over two-weeks, and user-level text collected over two years—allowing us to examine how each model’s strengths align with the underlying stability of different constructs. The findings show that mental health signals emerge as the most accurately predicted dimensions (r=0.6) across all temporal scales. At the daily scale, smaller models like DeBERTa and HaRT often performed better, whereas, at longer scales or with greater context, larger model like Llama3-8B performed the best. Also, aggregating text over the entire... | Khushboo Singh, Vasudha Varadarajan, Adithya V. Ganesan, August Håkan Nilsson, Nikita Soni, Syeda Mahwish, Pranav Chitale, Ryan L. Boyd, Lyle H.

To bridge this gap, we propose a new evaluation task for temporal reasoning in multi-session dialogues and introduce an approach to construct a new benchmark by augmenting dialogues from LoCoMo and creating multi-choice QAs. Furthermore, we present TReMu, a new framework aimed at enhancing the temporal reasoning capabilities of LLM-agents in this context. Specifically, the framework employs time-aware memorization through timeline summarization, generating retrievable memory by summarizing events in each dialogue session with their inferred dates. Additionally, we integrate neuro-symbolic temporal reasoning, where LLMs generate Python code to perform temporal calculations and select answers. Experimental evaluations on popular LLMs demonstrate that our benchmark is challenging, and the proposed framework significantly improves temporal... | Yubin Ge, Salvatore Romeo, Jason Cai, Raphael Shu, Yassine Benajiba, Monica Sunkara, Yi Zhang |  |

While this behavior helps prevent incorrect relation assignments, our analysis reveals that it also leads to significant information loss when reasoning is not explicitly included in the output. We systematically evaluate this trade-off across multiple prompts, datasets, and relation types, introducing the concept of Hobson’s choice to capture scenarios where models opt for safe but uninformative labels over hallucinated ones. Our findings suggest that conservative bias occurs twice as often as hallucination. To quantify this effect, we use SBERT and LLM prompts to capture the semantic similarity between conservative bias behaviors in constrained prompts and labels generated from semi-constrained and open-ended prompts. | Toyin Aguda, Erik Wilson, Allan Anzagira, Simerjot Kaur, Charese Smiley |  |

In this work, we study the conflict between biases of each component and their relationship to the overall bias of the RAG system, which we call bias conflict. Examining both gender and political biases as case studies, we show that bias conflict can be characterized through a linear relationship among components despite its complexity. Through fine-tuning, we demonstrate how to control the bias of the embedder while maintaining utility and reveal the importance of reverse-biasing the embedder to mitigate bias in the overall system, Additionally, we find that LLMs and tasks exhibit varying sensitivities to bias, a crucial factor to consider for debiasing. Our results underscore that a fair RAG system can be better achieved by carefully controlling the bias of the embedder rather than... | Taeyoun Kim, Jacob Mitchell Springer, Aditi Raghunathan, Maarten Sap |  |

It is important for Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to leverage both textual and visual information in performing tasks like social understanding and reasoning. However, while current LLMs have shown good social reasoning capabilities in textual context, whether they can effectively incorporate visual information in social comprehension remains under-explored. To narrow the gap, we first construct and propose a benchmark: V-Social, featuring well-aligned text and visual content, tailored to assess visual social commonsense for multimodal foundation models. Through experimenting with V-Social, we find that even the most advanced VLM, GPT-4o, often falls short in social commonsense reasoning. This highlights the critical need to enhance the social grounding of VLMs. One major obstacle for improving this is the lack of high-quality data with good reasoning process.

Most progress is made for English, given its abundance of high-quality pretraining data. For most other languages, however, such high quality pretraining data is unavailable. In this work, we study how to boost pretrained model performance in a target language with insufficient pretraining data for training a high performing language model by enlisting data from an auxiliary language for which high quality data is available. We study this by quantifying the performance gap between training with data in a data-rich auxiliary language compared with training in the target language, exploring the benefits of translation systems, studying the limitations of model scaling when data is limited in the target languages, and proposing new methods for upsampling data from the auxiliary language. Our results show that stronger auxiliary datasets result in performance gains without modification to... | Skyler Seto, Maartje ter Hoeve, Richard He Bai, Natalie Schluter, David Grangier |  |

However, performing complex analytical tasks with charts requires significant perceptual and cognitive effort. Chart Question Answering (CQA) systems automate this process by enabling models to interpret and reason with visual representations of data. However, existing benchmarks like ChartQA lack real-world diversity and have recently shown performance saturation with modern large vision-language models (LVLMs). To address these limitations, we introduce ChartQAPro, a new benchmark that includes 1,341 charts from 99 diverse sources, spanning various chart types—including infographics and dashboards—and featuring 1,948 questions in various types, such as multiple-choice, conversational, hypothetical, and unanswerable questions, to better reflect real-world challenges. Our evaluations with 21 models show a substantial performance drop for LVLMs on ChartQAPro; e.g., Claude... | Ahmed Masry, Mohammed Saidul Islam, Mahir Ahmed, Aayush Bajaj, Firoz Kabir, Aaryaman Kartha, Md.

However, adapting these LVLMs to egocentric scenarios remains challenging due to their third-person training bias. Existing methods that adapt LVLMs for first-person tasks often overlook critical agent-environment interactions, limiting their ability to perform egocentric reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose a novel zero-shot paradigm termed Front-Door Adjustments with Uncertainty Calibration (FRUIT) to enhance the egocentric reasoning abilities of LVLMs by simulating human causal reasoning. Specifically, the FRUIT operates in two stages: observation and understanding. Unlike conventional prompting techniques, we formalize egocentric reasoning using a structural causal model. Then, we ground interaction regions and expand them into hierarchical visual cues, augmented with corresponding captions, to form the initial observations. To reduce... | Shenshen Li, Wenxin Meng, Lei Wang, Hao Yang, Chong Peng, Peng Yan, Fumin Shen, Jingkuan Song, Heng Tao Shen, Xing Xu |  |

Rethinking LLM-based Query Expansion](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.980/) |  | 0 | Query expansion methods powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness in zero-shot retrieval tasks. These methods assume that LLMs can generate hypothetical documents that, when incorporated into a query vector, enhance the retrieval of real evidence. However, we challenge this assumption by investigating whether knowledge leakage in benchmarks contributes to the observed performance gains. Using fact verification as a testbed, we analyze whether the generated documents contain information entailed by ground-truth evidence and assess their impact on performance. Our findings indicate that, on average, performance improvements consistently occurred for claims whose generated documents included sentences entailed by gold evidence. This suggests that knowledge leakage may be present in fact-verification benchmarks, potentially inflating the perceived performance of LLM-based query expansion methods. | Yejun Yoon, Jaeyoon Jung, Seunghyun Yoon, Kunwoo Park |  |

An Embarrassingly Simple Probing Evaluation of Large Multimodal Models in Medical VQA](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.981/) |  | 0 | Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on existing medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) benchmarks. However, high reported accuracy does not necessarily reflect their true diagnostic reliability in clinical settings. This study reveals that state-of-the-art models perform worse than random guessing on medical diagnosis questions when subjected to simple Probing Evaluation for Medical Diagnosis (ProbMed). ProbMed challenges models through probing evaluation and procedural diagnosis. Particularly, probing evaluation features pairing ground-truth questions with adversarial counterparts that feature negated and hallucinated attributes, while procedural diagnosis requires reasoning across various dimensions for each image, including modality recognition, organ identification, clinical findings, abnormalities, and positional grounding. Our evaluation reveals that even top-performing models like GPT-4o, GPT-4V, and Gemini Pro perform worse than random... | Qianqi Yan, Xuehai He, Xiang Yue, Xin Eric Wang |  |

While large language models (LLMs) excel in many reasoning tasks, their ability to leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for text-to-SQL remains underexplored. We identify critical limitations: zero-shot CoT offers minimal gains, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) applied without CoT yields marginal improvements. We propose ExCoT-DPO, a novel framework that iteratively optimizes open-source LLMs by combining CoT reasoning with off-policy and on-policy DPO, relying solely on execution accuracy as feedback. This approach eliminates the need for reward models or human-annotated preferences. Our experimental results demonstrate significant performance gains: ExCoT-DPO improves execution accuracy on BIRD from 57.37% to 68.51% and on Spider from 78.81% to 86.59% for LLaMA-3 70B, with Qwen-2.5-Coder demonstrating similar improvements.

We explore whether LLMs demonstrate genuine reasoning capabilities across various domains when the underlying logical structure remains constant. We focus on two main questions (1) Can abstract logical problems alone accurately benchmark LLMs’ reasoning ability in real-world scenarios, disentangled from contextual support in practical settings? (2) Does fine-tuning LLMs on abstract logic problems generalize to contextualized logic problems and vice versa? To investigate these questions, we focus on standard propositional logic, specifically propositional deductive and abductive logic reasoning. We construct datasets for both reasoning types with four difficulty levels across 12 distinct domains based on the Wikipedia categorization in addition to those with purely abstract... | Wenyue Hua, Kaijie Zhu, Lingyao Li, Lizhou Fan, Mingyu Jin, Shuhang Lin, Haochen Xue, Zelong Li, Jindong Wang, Yongfeng Zhang |  |

While existing task vector-based merging methods show promise, they typically apply uniform coefficients across all parameters, overlooking varying parameter importance both within and across tasks. We present Sens-Merging, a sensitivity-guided coefficient adjustment method that enhances existing model merging techniques by operating at both task-specific and cross-task levels. Our method analyzes parameter sensitivity within individual tasks and evaluates cross-task transferability to determine optimal merging coefficients. Extensive experiments on Mistral 7B and LLaMA2 7B/13B models demonstrate that Sens-Merging significantly improves performance across general knowledge, mathematical reasoning, and code generation tasks.

We thus present EgoNormia \lVert 𝜖 \rVert, comprising 1,853 (200 for EgoNormia-verified) multiple choice questions (MCQs) grounded within ego-centric videos of human interactions, enabling the evaluation and improvement of normative reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs). spans seven norm categories: safety, privacy, proxemics, politeness, cooperation, coordination/proactivity, and communication/legibility. To compile this dataset at scale, we propose a novel pipeline to generate grounded MCQs from raw egocentric video. Our work demonstrates that current state-of-the-art VLMs lack robust grounded norm understanding, scoring a maximum of 54% on EgoNormia and 58% on EgoNormia-verified, with performance across norm categories indicating significant risks of safety and privacy when VLMs are used in real-world agents.

Traditional psycholinguistic evaluations often reflect statistical rules that may not accurately represent LLMs’ true linguistic competence. We introduce a neurolinguistic approach, utilizing a novel method that combines minimal pair and diagnostic probing to analyze activation patterns across model layers. This method allows for a detailed examination of how LLMs represent form and meaning, and whether these representations are consistent across languages. We found: (1) Psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic methods reveal that language performance and competence are distinct; (2) Direct probability measurement may not accurately assess linguistic competence; (3) Instruction tuning won’t change much competence but improve performance; (4) LLMs exhibit higher... | Linyang He, Ercong Nie, Helmut Schmid, Hinrich Schütze, Nima Mesgarani, Jonathan Brennan |  |

Based on more than 30,000 papers and 1,000 presentations from machine learning conferences, we examined and compared the words used in writing and speaking, representing the first large-scale study of how LLMs influence the two main modes of verbal communication and expression within the same group of people. Our empirical results show that LLM-style words such as significant have been used more frequently in abstracts and oral presentations. The implicit impact on human expression like writing and speaking is beginning to emerge and is likely to grow in the future. We take the first step in building an automated monitoring platform to record its longitudinal changes to call attention to the implicit influence and ripple effect of LLMs on human society. | Mingmeng Geng, Caixi Chen, Yanru Wu, Yao Wan, Pan Zhou, Dongping Chen |  |

Despite these advancements, current research predominantly focuses on English scenarios. In reality, there are over 7,000 languages worldwide, all of which demand access to comparable agentic services. Nevertheless, the development of language agents remains inadequate for meeting the diverse requirements of multilingual agentic applications. To fill this gap, we introduce X-WebAgentBench, a novel multilingual agent benchmark in an interactive web environment, which evaluates the planning and interaction performance of language agents across multiple languages, thereby contributing to the advancement of global agent intelligence. Additionally, we assess the performance of various LLMs and cross-lingual alignment methods, examining their effectiveness in enhancing agents.

However, evaluating their memory capabilities still remains challenges. Previous evaluations are commonly limited by the diversity of memory levels and interactive scenarios. They also lack comprehensive metrics to reflect the memory capabilities from multiple aspects. To address these problems, in this paper, we construct a more comprehensive dataset and benchmark to evaluate the memory capability of LLM-based agents. Our dataset incorporates factual memory and reflective memory as different levels, and proposes participation and observation as various interactive scenarios. Based on our dataset, we present a benchmark, named MemBench, to evaluate the memory capability of LLM-based agents from multiple aspects, including their effectiveness, efficiency, and capacity.

The LoRA merge technique, which integrates multiple LoRA modules trained on different tasks, has gained attention as an effective and efficient approach for adapting LLMs to target tasks. However, previous methods are limited in adaptability as they keep the LoRA parameters frozen. Additionally, the low-resource problem has been out of their scope. We propose a LoRA merge method that updates and prunes LoRA parameters through fine-tuning with minimal target task data, which allows finer-grained adjustments of LoRA parameters and enhancement of task adaptability. Extensive experiments have been conducted taking summarization as a benchmark task. Our datasets cover various domains and multiple languages of English and Japanese. The results confirm that the proposed method achieves significant and consistent improvements in task adaptability over the previous... | Ryota Miyano, Yuki Arase |  |

To enhance long-context capabilities, constructing high-quality training data with \*\*long-range dependencies\*\* is crucial. Existing methods to select long-context data often rely on sentence-level analysis,which can be greatly optimized in both performance and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel token-level framework, ​\*\*LongAttn\*\*​, which leverages the self-attention mechanism of LLMs to measure the \*\*long-range dependencies\*\* for the data. By calculating token-level dependency strength and distribution uniformity of token scores, LongAttn effectively quantifies ​\*\*long-range dependencies\*\*​, enabling more accurate and efficient data selection. We filter \*\*LongABC-32K\*\* from open-source long-context datasets (ArXiv, Book, and Code).

Identifying implied conditions and examining their influence on an outcome is challenging. We handle this by combining and augmenting annotations from two existing datasets consisting of goals and states, and explore the influence of conditions through our research questions and Condition-based Reasoning tasks. We examine open and closed LLMs of varying sizes and intent-alignment on our reasoning tasks and find that conditions are useful when not all context is available. Models differ widely in their ability to generate and identify outcome-variant conditions, which affects their performance on outcome validation, when conditions are used to replace missing context. Larger models like GPT-4o, are more cautious in such less constrained situations. | Sai P. Vallurupalli, Francis Ferraro |  |

CoQ answers the complex question step-by-step, through simpler subquestions (SQs) from which relevant knowledge is retrieved. By doing so, CoQ aims to improve the answer comprehensiveness and verifiability, at the expense of latency. Our first contribution is showing that the chaining often incurs harmful effects on both objectives, and SQs left unverified often fail to answer the given question. Second, we propose a better alternative to CoQ, union-of-query which adopts a factored approach to break the harmful chain. Finally, we propose to verify SQs before answers, by fine-tuning the SQ generator using verified SQs and introducing a selector verifying SQs in test time. Employing vicuna-13b, our approach, denoted by FaVe (short for Factored and Verified search), even outperforms ChatGPT baselines while maintaining efficiency. | Jihyuk Kim, Sungjin Lee, Seungwon Hwang, Yang Liu |  |

In this paper, we introduce UnrealLLM, a novel multi-agent framework that connects natural language descriptions with the professional PCG system (Unreal Engine 5) to automate scene generation. UnrealLLM constructs a comprehensive knowledge base to translate text into executable PCG blueprints and a diverse asset library that guarantees high-quality scene generation. Additionally, it also introduces a text-based blueprint system with a spline-based control mechanism for geometric arrangement, enabling natural language interaction and enhancing interactivity in 3D environments using UE5’s advanced capabilities.

Existing methods, such as PromptAgent, rely on a single static prompt, which struggles with disjoint cases in complex tasks. Although MoP uses multiple prompts, it fails to account for variations in task complexity. Inspired by programmatic control flow, we introduce a nested if-else structure to address both varying similarities and complexities across diverse cases. We propose Tree-of-Prompts (ToP), which implements this structure by recursively expanding child prompts from a parent prompt. Sibling prompts tackle disjoint cases while inheriting shared similarities from their parent, and handle cases more complex than the parent. Evaluated on Gorilla (understanding), MATH (reasoning), and a subset of BBH benchmarks, ToP outperforms PromptAgent and MoP, with improvements of 1.4% and 4.6% over PromptAgent and 3.2% and 4.5% over MoP, when tested with GPT-4o-mini and Llama 3.2-3B,... | Jihyuk Kim, Shubham Garg, Lahari Poddar, Seungwon Hwang, Chris Hench |  |

However, the substantial size of LLMs presents significant challenges in training or fine-tuning. While parameter-efficient approaches such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) have gained popularity, they often compromise performance compared to full-rank fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose Outlier-weighed Layerwise Sampling (OWS), a new memory-efficient fine-tuning approach, inspired by the layerwise outlier distribution of LLMs. Unlike LoRA, which adds extra adapters to all layers, OWS strategically assigns higher sampling probabilities to layers with more outliers, selectively sampling only a few layers and fine-tuning their pre-trained weights. To further increase the number of fine-tuned layers without a proportional rise in memory costs, we incorporate gradient low-rank projection, further boosting the approach’s performance.

To reduce the cost of auto-regressive decoding, Key-Value (KV) cache is used to store intermediate activations, which significantly lowers the computational overhead for token generation. However, the memory required for the KV cache grows rapidly, often exceeding the capacity of GPU memory. A cost-effective alternative is to offload KV cache to CPU memory, which alleviates GPU memory pressure, but shifts the bottleneck to the limited bandwidth of the PCIe connection between the CPU and GPU. Existing methods attempt to address these issues by overlapping GPU computation with I/O or employing CPU-GPU heterogeneous execution, but they are hindered by excessive data movement and dependence on CPU capabilities. Fully overlapping PCIe communication latency gets challenging as the size of the KV cache grows and/or the GPU compute capabilities increase.

However, these models often struggle with limited inference and reasoning capabilities, which restrict their performance on complex tasks and limit their practical applicability. Moreover, existing prompt optimization methods typically rely on extensive manual effort or the meta-cognitive abilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, making them less effective for LwLLMs.To address these challenges, we introduce DeBoP, a new Direct Behavior Optimization Paradigm, original from the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting technique. Unlike CoT Prompting, DeBoP is an automatic optimization method, which focuses on the optimization directly on the behavior of LwLLMs. In particular, DeBoP transforms the optimization of complex prompts into the optimization of discrete,... | Hongming Yang, Shi Lin, Jun Shao, Changting Lin, Donghai Zhu, Meng Han, Qinglei Kong |  |

Existing methods primarily rely on training classification models or using the confidence of the model’s answer to determine knowledge boundaries. However, training-based methods may have limited generalization, and our analysis reveals that LLMs struggle to reliably assess whether they possess the required information based on their answers, often biased by prior cognitive tendencies (e.g., tokens’ semantic preferences). To address this, we propose Debiased Historical In-Context Learning (DH-ICL) to identify knowledge boundaries in AR. DH-ICL aims to reframe this self-awareness metacognitive task as a structured pattern-learning problem by retrieving similar historical queries as high-confidence in-context examples to guide LLMs to identify knowledge boundaries. Furthermore, we introduce a historical bias... | Bo Lv, Nayu Liu, Yang Shen, Xin Liu, Ping Luo, Yue Yu |  |

CAT: Addressing Preference Traps in Unsupervised EAE](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.1000/) |  | 0 | Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved the performance of unsupervised Event Argument Extraction (EAE) tasks. However, LLMs’ inherent preferences severely hinder their effectiveness in EAE, leading to what we term preference traps, namely, the Prior Knowledge Trap, the Sycophancy Hallucination Trap, and the Output Contradiction Trap. Existing approaches often fall into these traps due to misalignments between their prior knowledge, instructions, or output constraints and LLMs’ preferences, which significantly limits further performance gains. To address this issue, we propose Choose-After-Think (CAT), an unsupervised EAE framework designed to handle these preference traps through targeted measures. CAT innovatively divides the EAE task into two phases: identification of event information (argument roles) (Think Phase) and selection of the final answers from a candidate set (Choose Phase). This two-phase approach reduces the impact of individual token probability... | Yunhao Wei, Kai Shuang, Zhiyi Li, Chenrui Mao |  |

When evaluating fully trained models designed for TAG predictions, they may perform significantly unsatisfactory on samples outside the In-Distribution (ID) data, which may raise serious security issues. To tackle it, Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detection is introduced to the TAGs field, which aims to utilize a detector to classify OOD and ID samples. Recent studies attempt to introduce extra OOD datasets to regularize the detection model. However, due to the vastness of the OOD data space, high-quality OOD samples for training the detector are scarce and difficult to obtain in the real world. Thus, we utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate the OOD training samples with high quality. There are two issues in this process: (1) LLMs tend to generate OOD-node samples significantly different from ID ones, with a limited learning value for OOD and ID relations. (2) Due to... | Xiangwei Lv, Mengze Li, Jingyuan Chen, Zhiang Dong, Sirui Han, Beishui Liao |  |

Existing methods are mainly categorized into transformer-based models and graph-based models. While transformer-based models capture global contextual information, they typically focus on individual entity pairs, making it challenging to capture complex interactions between multiple entity pairs. Graph-based models build document graphs using entities or sentences as nodes for reasoning but often lack explicit mechanisms to model fine-grained interactions between entity pairs, limiting their ability to handle complex relational reasoning tasks. Additionally, previous research has not considered predicting all possible relations in advance to assist with DocRE tasks. To address these issues, we propose a new framework namely \*\*GREP\*\* (\*\*g\*\*lobal \*\*r\*\*elations and \*\*e\*\*ntity \*\*p\*\*air reasoning) for DocRE tasks.

This empirical study investigates methods to reduce patch embeddings per page while minimizing performance degradation. We evaluate two token-reduction strategies: token pruning and token merging. Regarding token pruning, we surprisingly observe that a simple random strategy outperforms other sophisticated pruning methods, though still far from satisfactory. Further analysis reveals that pruning is inherently unsuitable for VDR as it requires removing certain page embeddings without query-specific information. Turning to token merging (more suitable for VDR), we search for the optimal combinations of merging strategy across three dimensions and develops Light-ColPali/ColQwen2. It maintains 98.2% of retrieval performance with only 11.8% of original memory usage, and preserves 94.6% effectiveness at 2% memory footprint.

In real-world scenarios, user instructions often contain soft constraints, which are semantically related and cannot be rule-based verified, posing challenges for LLMs. To enhance the soft constraint following ability of LLMs, we initially design a pipeline to construct datasets with high-quality outputs for instructions containing soft constraints automatically. Additionally, to fully utilize the positive and negative samples generated during the data construction process, we choose Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) as the training method. Furthermore, taking into account the difficulty of soft constraints indicated by the number of constraints, we design a curriculum learning training paradigm based on the constraint quantity. We experimentally evaluate the effectiveness of our methods in improving LLMs’ soft constraint following ability and analyze the factors driving the... | Qingyu Ren, Jie Zeng, Qianyu He, Jiaqing Liang, Yanghua Xiao, Weikang Zhou, Zeye Sun, Fei Yu |  |

However, if a task cannot be fully described in prompts, the models could fail to carry out the task. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method to contextualize a task toward a LLM. The method utilizes (1) open-ended zero-shot inference from the entire dataset, (2) aggregate the inference results, and (3) finally incorporate the aggregated meta-information for the actual task. We show the effectiveness in text clustering tasks, empowering LLMs to perform text-to-text-based clustering and leading to improvements on several datasets. Furthermore, we explore the generated class labels for clustering, showing how the LLM understands the task through data. | Hwiyeol Jo, Hyunwoo Lee, Kang Min Yoo, Taiwoo Park |  |

While modern LLMs excel at reasoning tasks, their ability to maintain stable and consistent rule abstraction under imperfect observations remains underexplored. To fill this gap, in this work, we introduce \*\*Robust Rule Induction\*\*, a task that evaluates LLMs’ capability in inferring rules from data that are fused with noisy examples. To address this task, we further propose Sample-steered Rule Refinement (SRR), a method enhancing reasoning stability via observation diversification and execution-guided feedback. Experiments across arithmetic, cryptography, and list functions reveal: (1) SRR outperforms other methods with minimal performance degradation under noise; (2) Despite slight accuracy variation, LLMs exhibit instability under noise (e.g., 0 accuracy change with only 70 consistent score);(3) Counterfactual task... | Chunyang Li, Weiqi Wang, Tianshi Zheng, Yangqiu Song |  |

This paper introduces LLMTaxo, a novel framework leveraging large language models for the automated construction of taxonomies of factual claims from social media by generating topics at multiple levels of granularity. The resulting hierarchical structure significantly reduces redundancy and improves information accessibility. We also propose dedicated taxonomy evaluation metrics to enable comprehensive assessment. Evaluations conducted on three diverse datasets demonstrate LLMTaxo’s effectiveness in producing clear, coherent, and comprehensive taxonomies. Among the evaluated models, GPT-4o mini consistently outperforms others across most metrics. The framework’s flexibility and low reliance on manual intervention underscore its potential for broad applicability. | Haiqi Zhang, Zhengyuan Zhu, Zeyu Zhang, Chengkai Li |  |

While model-driven approaches aim to enhance MLLM capabilities through diverse architectures, their performance gains have become increasingly marginal. In contrast, data-driven methods, which scale up image-text instruction datasets, have proven more effective but face challenges related to limited data diversity and complexity. The absence of high-quality instruction data remains a major bottleneck in MLLM development. To address this issue, we propose , a novel multimodal instruction data evolution framework. This framework iteratively enhances data quality through a refined combination of fine-grained perception, cognitive reasoning, and interaction evolution, generating a more complex and diverse image-text instruction dataset that significantly improves MLLM capabilities.

In this paper, we introduce SciVerse, a multi-modal scientific evaluation benchmark to thoroughly assess LMMs across 5,735 test instances in five distinct versions. We aim to investigate three key dimensions of LMMs: scientific knowledge comprehension, multi-modal content interpretation, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. To unveil whether LMMs possess sufficient scientific expertise, we first transform each problem into three versions containing different levels of knowledge required for solving, i.e., Knowledge-free, -lite, and -rich. Then, to explore how LMMs interpret multi-modal scientific content, we annotate another two versions, i.e., Vision-rich and -only, marking more question information from texts to diagrams. Comparing the results of different versions, SciVerse systematically examines the... | Ziyu Guo, Renrui Zhang, Hao Chen, Jialin Gao, Dongzhi Jiang, Jiaze Wang, PhengAnn Heng |  |

Correct recognition of homonym sense greatly relies on its surrounding context. This ambiguous nature makes homonyms an appropriate testbed for examining the contextualization capability of pre-trained (PLM) and large language models (LLMs). Considering the impact of part of speech (POS) on homonym disambiguation and the prevalence of English-focused studies in word embedding research, this study extends to Chinese and provides a comprehensive layer-wise analysis of homonym representations in both languages, spanning same and different POS categories, across four families of PLMs/LLMs (BERT, GPT-2, Llama 3, Qwen 2.5). Through the creation of a synthetic dataset and computation of disambiguation score (D-Score), we found that: (1) no universal layer depth excels in differentiating homonym representations; (2) bidirectional models produce better contextualized homonym representations compared... | Matthew KingHang Ma, Chenwei Xie, Wenbo Wang, William ShiYuan Wang |  |

Prior research has proposed a variety of datasets to assess the effectiveness of these model editing methods. However, most existing datasets only require models to output short phrases or sentences, overlooks the widespread existence of document level tasks in the real world, raising doubts about their practical usability. Aimed at addressing this limitation and promoting the application of model editing in real-world scenarios, we propose the task of document-level model editing. To tackle such challenges and enhance model capabilities in practical settings, we introduce DocMEdit, a dataset focused on document-level model editing, characterized by document-level inputs and outputs, extrapolative, and multiple facts within a single edit. We propose a series of evaluation metrics and experiments.

Existing knowledge editing methods for LLM detoxification face two major challenges. First, they often rely on entity-specific localization, making them ineffective against adversarial inputs without explicit entities. Second, these methods suffer from over-editing, where detoxified models reject legitimate queries, compromising overall performance. In this paper, we propose ToxEdit, a toxicity-aware knowledge editing approach that dynamically detects toxic activation patterns during forward propagation. It then routes computations through adaptive inter-layer pathways to mitigate toxicity effectively. This design ensures precise toxicity mitigation while preserving LLMs’ general capabilities. To more accurately assess over-editing, we also enhance the SafeEdit benchmark by incorporating instruction-following evaluation tasks.

Although long-term memory capability is crucial, recent studies have not thoroughly investigated the memory performance of large language models in long-term tasks. To address this gap, we introduce the Long-term Chronological Conversations (LOCCO) dataset and conduct a quantitative evaluation of the long-term memory capabilities of large language models. Experimental results demonstrate that large language models can retain past interaction information to a certain extent, but their memory decays over time. While rehearsal strategies can enhance memory persistence, excessive rehearsal is not an effective memory strategy for large models, unlike in smaller models. Additionally, the models exhibit memory preferences across different categories... | Zixi Jia, Qinghua Liu, Hexiao Li, Yuyan Chen, Jiqiang Liu |  |

We present grammar prompting, an explain-then-process paradigm: a large LLM first produces a concise explanation of the relevant syntactic phenomenon, then that explanation is fed back as additional context to the target model – either an LLM or a smaller language model (SLM) – before deciding which sentence of a minimal pair is grammatical. On the English BLiMP, Chinese SLING, and Russian RuBLiMP benchmarks, this simple prompt design yields substantial improvements over strong baselines across a wide range of syntactic phenomena. Feeding an LLM’s metalinguistic explanation back to the target model bridges the gap between knowing a rule and using it. On SLMs, grammar prompting alone trims the average LLM-SLM accuracy gap by 20%, and when paired with chain-of-thought, by 56% (13.0 pp → 5.8 pp), all at negligible cost.

Current LLM-based agents struggle with non-linear relationships, recursive dependencies, implicit data- and logic-dependent reasoning, and managing extensive context. In this paper, we introduce Data Interpreter, an LLM-based agent that addresses these challenges through hierarchical graph-based modeling to represent the complexity and a progressive strategy for step-by-step verification, refinement, and consistent context management. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of Data Interpreter. On InfiAgent-DABench, it boosts performance by 25% (from 75.9% to 94.9%), and on machine learning and open-ended tasks, it lifts accuracy from 88% to 95% and from 60% to 97%, respectively.

We focus on retrieval-based SD where the draft model retrieves the next tokens from a non-parametric datastore. Sparse retrieval (CITATION)REST], which operates on the surface form of strings, is currently the dominant paradigm due to its simplicity and scalability. However, its effectiveness is limited due to the usage of short contexts and exact string matching. Instead, we introduce Dense Retrieval for Speculative Decoding (DReSD), a novel framework that uses approximate nearest neighbour search with contextualised token embeddings to retrieve the most semantically relevant token sequences for SD. Extensive experiments show that DReSD achieves (on average) 87% higher acceptance rates, 65% longer accepted tokens and 19% faster generation... | Milan Gritta, Huiyin Xue, Gerasimos Lampouras |  |

We observe that popular metrics using the Decompose-Then-Verify framework, such as FActScore, can be manipulated by adding obvious or repetitive subclaims to artificially inflate scores. This observation motivates our new customizable plug-and-play subclaim selection component called Core, which filters down individual subclaims according to their uniqueness and informativeness. We show that many popular factual precision metrics augmented by Core are substantially more robust on a wide range of knowledge domains. We release an evaluation framework supporting easy and modular use of Core and various decomposition strategies, which we recommend adoption by the community. We also release an expansion of the FActScore biography dataset to facilitate further studies of decomposition-based factual precision evaluation. | Zhengping Jiang, Jingyu Zhang, Nathaniel Weir, Seth Ebner, Miriam Wanner, Kate Sanders, Daniel Khashabi, Anqi Liu, Benjamin Van Durme |  |

However, preferences are inherently diverse and complex, making it difficult for traditional reward models to capture their full range. While fine-grained preference data can help, collecting it is expensive and hard to scale. In this paper, we introduce Decomposed Reward Models (DRMs), a novel approach that extracts diverse human preferences from binary comparisons without requiring fine-grained annotations. Our key insight is to represent human preferences as vectors and analyze them using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). By constructing a dataset of embedding differences between preferred and rejected responses, DRMs identify orthogonal basis vectors that capture distinct aspects of preference. These decomposed rewards can be flexibly combined to align with different user needs, offering an interpretable and scalable alternative to traditional reward models.

A Knowledge Circuits Perspective on Continual Pre-Training](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.1021/) |  | 0 | Despite exceptional capabilities in knowledge-intensive tasks, Large Language Models (LLMs) face a critical gap in understanding how they internalize new knowledge, particularly how acquired knowledge becomes structurally embedded in their neural computations. We address this issue through the lens of knowledge circuit evolution, identifying computational subgraphs that facilitate knowledge storage and processing. Our systematic analysis of circuit evolution throughout continual pre-training reveals several key findings: (1) the acquisition of new knowledge is influenced by its relevance to pre-existing knowledge; (2) the evolution of knowledge circuits exhibits a distinct phase shift from formation to optimization; (3) the evolution of knowledge circuits follows a deep-to-shallow pattern. These insights not only advance our theoretical understanding of the mechanisms of new knowledge acquisition in LLMs, but also provide potential implications for improving continual pre-training... | Yixin Ou, Yunzhi Yao, Ningyu Zhang, Hui Jin, Jiacheng Sun, Shumin Deng, Zhenguo Li, Huajun Chen |  |

To overcome these limitations, we introduce TEMPTABQA-C, a synthetic dataset designed for systematic and controlled evaluations, alongside a symbolic intermediate representation that transforms tables into database schemas. This structured approach allows LLMs to generate and execute SQL queries, enhancing generalization and mitigating biases. By incorporating adaptive fewshot prompting with contextually tailored examples, our method achieves superior robustness, scalability, and performance. Experimental results consistently highlight improvements across key challenges, setting a new benchmark for robust temporal reasoning with LLMs. Code and TEMPTABQA-C... | Atharv Kulkarni, Kushagra Dixit, Vivek Srikumar, Dan Roth, Vivek Gupta |  |

However, their rapid evolution and widespread adoption have made it increasingly challenging to keep up with the latest advancements. To address this, we present a systematic and comprehensive survey to facilitate further research on TIU MLLMs. Initially, we outline the timeline, architecture, and pipeline of nearly all TIU MLLMs. Then, we review the performance of selected models on mainstream benchmarks. Finally, we explore promising directions, challenges, and limitations within the field. | Pei Fu, Tongkun Guan, Zining Wang, Zhentao Guo, Chen Duan, Hao Sun, Boming Chen, Qianyi Jiang, Jiayao Ma, Kai Zhou, Junfeng Luo |  |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising performance on video tasks due to their advanced visual comprehension capabilities, the substantial redundancy inherent in video data poses significant computational challenges. To address this issue, PruneVid (1) reduces intrinsic video redundancy by merging temporally static and spatially similar tokens, and (2) leverages LLMs’ inherent ability to selectively prune visual tokens irrelevant to specific queries, thereby improving model efficiency. We validate our method across multiple video benchmarks, demonstrating that PruneVid can prune over 80% of tokens while maintaining competitive performance when combined with different video LLMs. Our results highlight PruneVid’s superior effectiveness and efficiency compared to existing pruning methods. | Xiaohu Huang, Hao Zhou, Kai Han |  |

However, manual prompt engineering is both labor-intensive and domain-specific, necessitating the need for automated solutions. We introduce PromptWizard, a novel, fully automated framework for discrete prompt optimization, utilizing a self-evolving, self-adapting mechanism. Through a feedback-driven critique and synthesis process, PromptWizard achieves an effective balance between exploration and exploitation, iteratively refining both prompt instructions and in-context examples to generate human-readable, task-specific prompts.

However, their performance on numerical reasoning tasks, such as basic arithmetic, numerical retrieval, and magnitude comparison, remains surprisingly poor. This gap arises from their reliance on surface-level statistical patterns rather than understanding numbers as continuous magnitudes. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on either linguistic competence or structured mathematical problem-solving, neglecting fundamental numerical reasoning required in real-world scenarios.

However, existing approaches require fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive. This paper explores an alternative: prompting a fixed LLM with in-context examples. We observe that using randomly selected in-context examples hampers the LLM’s performance, resulting in sub-optimal generation quality. To address this, we propose a novel in-context learning framework: TabGen-ICL, to enhance the in-context learning ability of LLMs for tabular data generation. TabGen-ICL operates iteratively, retrieving a subset of real samples that represent the residual between currently generated samples and true data distributions. This approach serves two purposes: locally, it provides more effective in-context learning examples for the LLM in each iteration; globally, it progressively narrows the gap between generated and real data.

Occasionally they do! However, existing works primarily focus on ethical reviews, failing to capture the diversity of national values, which encompass broader policy, legal, and moral considerations. Furthermore, current benchmarks that rely on spectrum tests using manually designed questionnaires are not easily scalable. To address these limitations, we introduce NaVAB, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the alignment of LLMs with the values of five major nations: China, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. NaVAB implements a national value extraction pipeline to efficiently construct value assessment datasets. Specifically, we propose a modeling procedure with instruction tagging to process raw data sources, a screening process to filter value-related topics and a generation process with a Conflict Reduction mechanism to filter non-conflicting values.

However, the extent to which they can replicate human-like motivations remains an underexplored question. Existing benchmarks are constrained by simplistic scenarios and the absence of character identities, resulting in an information asymmetry with real-world situations. To address this gap, we propose MotiveBench, which consists of 200 rich contextual scenarios and 600 reasoning tasks covering multiple levels of motivation. Using MotiveBench, we conduct extensive experiments on seven popular model families, comparing different scales and versions within each family. The results show that even the most advanced LLMs still fall short in achieving human-like motivational reasoning.

However, it is computationally expensive, as sampling many of these (lengthy) paths is required to increase the chances that the correct answer emerges as the most frequent one. To address this, we introduce Confidence-Informed Self-Consistency (CISC). CISC performs a weighted majority vote based on confidence scores obtained directly from the model. By prioritizing high-confidence paths, it can identify the correct answer with a significantly smaller sample size. When tested on nine models and four datasets, CISC outperforms self-consistency in nearly all configurations, reducing the required number of reasoning paths by over 40% on average. In addition, we introduce the notion of within-question confidence evaluation, after showing that standard evaluation methods are poor predictors of success in distinguishing correct and incorrect... | Amir Taubenfeld, Tom Sheffer, Eran Ofek, Amir Feder, Ariel Goldstein, Zorik Gekhman, Gal Yona |  |

However, their impact on Large Language Models (LLMs) evaluation remains underexplored. Through systematic experiments with 28 LLMs on the MMLU benchmark, we examine how NA options affect model performance and confidence calibration. Our analysis reveals that NA options, when used as the correct answer, lead to a consistent 30-50% performance drop across models regardless of scale–suggesting that LLMs lack the meta-cognitive ability to systematically evaluate and reject all given options when none are correct. This degradation shows strong domain dependence, with minimal impact on mathematical reasoning (14.6% drop) but severe effects on tasks requiring uncertainty handling like business ethics (48.1% drop).

While a number of corpora annotated using theoretical frameworks of dialogue have been proposed, these typically focus on either utterance-level labeling of speaker intent, missing wider context, or the rhetorical structure of a dialogue, losing fine-grained intents captured in dialogue acts. Recently, the Dependency Dialogue Acts (DDA) framework has been proposed to for modeling both the fine-grained intents of each speaker and the structure of multi-party dialogues. However, there is not yet a corpus annotated with this framework available for the community to study.

With the development of large language models (LLMs), they stand out to be a promising tool for explainable mental health care applications. Nevertheless, existing approaches predominantly rely on subjective textual mental records, which can be distorted by inherent mental uncertainties, leading to inconsistent and unreliable predictions. To address these limitations, this paper introduces ProMind-LLM. We investigate an innovative approach integrating objective behavior data as complementary information alongside subjective mental records for robust mental health risk assessment. Specifically, ProMind-LLM incorporates a comprehensive pipeline that includes domain-specific pretraining to tailor the LLM for mental health contexts, a self-refine mechanism to optimize the processing of numerical behavioral data, and causal chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance the... | Xinzhe Zheng, Sijie Ji, Jiawei Sun, Renqi Chen, Wei Gao, Mani Srivastava |  |

This simplification could make LLMs’ responses biased to mostly preferred features, and would be exacerbated during the iterations of online preference learning steps. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework coined PFP (Preference Feature Preservation). The key idea of PFP is maintaining the distribution of human preference features and utilizing such rich signals throughout the online preference learning process. Specifically, PFP first extract preference features from offline pairwise human preference data and trains a feature classifier. Then, using trained classifier and the distribution preserving optimization, PFP maps appropriate preference features for a new input instruction during online learning. Lastly, PFP trains LLM using the existing preference learning method, by incorporating the preference feature... | Dongyoung Kim, Jinsung Yoon, Jinwoo Shin, Jaehyung Kim |  |

In this study, we identify notable redundancy across the layers of LLMs, where some layers contribute minimally to the overall network functionality. To quantify this, we introduce a metric called Block Influence (BI), which measures the importance of each layer based on the similarity between its input and output. Based on the observation of layer redundancy, we propose straightforward pruning methods for different tasks: ShortGPT for multiple-choice tasks and ShortGPT-gen for generative tasks. They prune redundant layers based on their BI scores. Our methods demonstrate superior performance over previous pruning methods. The ability to achieve better results through simple layer pruning, as opposed to more complex pruning techniques, suggests a high degree of redundancy across layers. We hope this work will contribute to future research for improving LLM efficiency. | Xin Men, Mingyu Xu, Qingyu Zhang, Qianhao Yuan, Bingning Wang, Hongyu Lin, Yaojie Lu, Xianpei Han, Weipeng Chen |  |

However, existing benchmarks lack the ability to automatically evaluate from users’ perspective, and also lack the explainability of the results of LLM agents’ code generation capabilities. Thus, we introduce ProjectEval, a new benchmark for LLM agents project-level code generation’s automated evaluation by simulating user interaction. ProjectEval is constructed by LLM with human reviewing. It has three different level inputs of natural languages or code skeletons. ProjectEval can evaluate the generated projects by user interaction simulation for execution, and by code similarity through existing objective indicators. Through ProjectEval, we find that systematic engineering project code, overall understanding of the project and comprehensive analysis capability are the keys for LLM agents to achieve practical projects. Our findings and benchmark provide valuable insights for developing more... | Kaiyuan Liu, Youcheng Pan, Yang Xiang, Daojing He, Jing Li, Yexing Du, Tianrun Gao |  |

However, while objects in natural scenes inevitably exhibit visual variations in position, scale, orientation, and context due to changes in viewpoint and environment, the robustness of LVLMs to these fundamental visual variations remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce V²R-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark framework for evaluating Visual Variation Robustness of LVLMs, which encompasses automated evaluation dataset generation and principled metrics for thorough robustness assessment. Through extensive evaluation of 13 LVLMs, we reveal a surprising vulnerability to visual variations, affecting even advanced models that excel at complex vision-language tasks yet significantly underperform on simple tasks like object recognition. Interestingly, these models exhibit a distinct visual position bias that contradicts theories of effective receptive fields and... | Zhiyuan Fan, Yumeng Wang, Sandeep Polisetty, Yi R. Fung |  |

To ensure privacy, researchers use differential privacy (DP) to provide protection by adding noise during LLM training. However, users may be hesitant to share complete data with LLMs. Researchers follow local DP to sanitize the text on the user side and feed non-sensitive text to LLMs. The sanitization usually uses a fixed non-sensitive token list or a fixed noise distribution, which induces the risk of being attacked or semantic distortion. We argue that the token’s protection level should be adaptively adjusted according to its semantic-based information to balance the privacy-utility trade-off. In this paper, we propose DYNTEXT, an LDP-based Dynamic Text sanitization for privacy-preserving LLM inference, which dynamically constructs semantic-aware adjacency lists of sensitive tokens to sample non-sensitive tokens for perturbation. Specifically, DYNTEXT first develops a semantic-based density modeling under DP to extract each... | Juhua Zhang, Zhiliang Tian, Minghang Zhu, Yiping Song, Taishu Sheng, Siyi Yang, Qiunan Du, Xinwang Liu, Minlie Huang, Dongsheng Li |  |

However, when MLLMs are transferred to the text image machine translation (TiMT) task, preliminary experiments reveal that MLLMs suffer from serious repetition and omission hallucinations. To alleviate these issues, this paper first designs an efficient MLLM named InImageTrans for TiMT and then proposes a simple and effective method named multi-conditional direct preference optimization (mcDPO) for advancing the TiMT. Particularly, the proposed mcDPO not only guides the MLLM in rejecting repetition output by creating text output preference pairs automatically, but also guides the MLLM in paying more attention to text information in images by creating image input preference pairs. Furthermore, we build a high-quality benchmark called MCiT for comprehensively evaluating the TiMT capabilities of InImageTrans. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly... | Fei Zuo, Kehai Chen, Yu Zhang, Zhengshan Xue, Min Zhang |  |

Multi-stage pretraining is a promising approach, but existing methods often lack quantitative criteria for data partitioning and instead rely on intuitive heuristics. In this paper, we propose the novel Four-quadRAnt Multi-stage prEtraining strategy (FRAME), guided by the established principle of organizing the pretraining process into four stages to achieve significant loss reductions four times. This principle is grounded in two key findings: first, training on high Perplexity (PPL) data followed by low PPL data, and second, training on low PPL difference (PD) data followed by high PD data, both causing the loss to drop significantly twice and performance enhancements. By partitioning data into four quadrants and strategically organizing them, FRAME achieves a remarkable 16.8% average improvement over... | Xuemiao Zhang, Feiyu Duan, Liangyu Xu, Yongwei Zhou, Sirui Wang, Rongxiang Weng, Jingang Wang, Xunliang Cai |  |

A large number of studies have explored integrating other modalities with LLMs, notably speech modality, which is naturally related to text. This paper surveys the integration of speech with LLMs, categorizing the methodologies into three primary approaches: text-based, latent-representation-based, and audio-token-based integration. We also demonstrate how these methods are applied across various speech-related applications and highlight the challenges in this field to offer inspiration for future research. | Zhengdong Yang, Shuichiro Shimizu, Yahan Yu, Chenhui Chu |  |

These difficulties arise due to the inherent sparsity of such data. Furthermore, LLMs often lack the ability to verify or ground their responses in authoritative sources, which can lead to plausible yet inaccurate outputs when addressing infrequent subject matter. Our work aims to investigate these phenomena by introducing KE-MHISTO, a multilingual benchmark for Entity Linking and Question Answering in the domain of historical music knowledge, available in both Italian and English. We demonstrate that KE-MHISTO provides significantly broader coverage of long-tail knowledge compared to existing alternatives. Moreover, it poses substantial challenges for state-of-the-art models. Our experiments reveal that smaller, multilingual models can achieve performance comparable to significantly larger counterparts,... | Arianna Graciotti, Leonardo Piano, Nicolas Lazzari, Enrico Daga, Rocco Tripodi, Valentina Presutti, Livio Pompianu |  |

Existing works mitigate this burden by offloading or compressing the KV cache. However, loading the entire cache incurs significant latency due to PCIe bandwidth bottlenecks in CPU-GPU communication, while aggressive compression causes notable performance degradation. We identify that certain layers in the LLM need to maintain global information and are unsuitable for selective loading. In contrast, other layers primarily focus on a few tokens with dominant activations that potentially incur substantial quantization error. This observation leads to a key insight that loading dominant tokens and quantizing all tokens can complement each other. Building on this insight, we propose a hybrid compression method, TailorKV, which seamlessly integrates quantization and offloading. TailorKV develops an inference framework along with a hardware-friendly implementation that leverages these... | Dingyu Yao, Bowen Shen, Zheng Lin, Wei Liu, Jian Luan, Bin Wang, Weiping Wang |  |

In contrast, group-agnostic debiasing has the potential to mitigate a variety of biases at once, but remains underexplored.In this work, we investigate the role of neutral words—the group-agnostic component—in enhancing the group-agnostic debiasing process. We first reveal that neutral words are essential for preserving semantic modeling, and we propose 𝜖-DPCE, a method that incorporates a neutral word semantics-based loss function to effectively alleviate the deterioration of the Language Modeling Score (LMS) during the debiasing process. Furthermore, by introducing the SCM-Projection method, we demonstrate that SCM-based debiasing eliminates stereotypes by indirectly disrupting the association between attribute... | Xinwei Guo, Jiashi Gao, Junlei Zhou, Jiaxin Zhang, Guanhua Chen, Xiangyu Zhao, Quanying Liu, Haiyan Wu, Xin Yao, Xuetao Wei |  |

However, in many real scenarios, the source tokens arrive in a streaming manner and simultaneous machine translation (SiMT) is required, then the efficiency and performance of decoder-only LLMs are significantly limited by their auto-regressive nature. To enable LLMs to achieve high-quality SiMT as efficiently as offline translation, we propose a novel paradigm that includes constructing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data for SiMT, along with new training and inference strategies. To replicate the token input/output stream in SiMT, the source and target tokens are rearranged into an interleaved sequence, separated by special tokens according to varying latency requirements. This enables powerful LLMs to learn read and write operations adaptively, based on varying... | Biao Fu, Minpeng Liao, Kai Fan, Chengxi Li, Liang Zhang, Yidong Chen, Xiaodong Shi |  |

However, despite the rich structural and textual information embedded in knowledge graphs (KGs), existing research of foundation model for KG has primarily focused on their structural aspects, with most efforts restricted to in-KG tasks (e.g., knowledge graph completion, KGC). This limitation has hindered progress in addressing more challenging out-of-KG tasks. In this paper, we introduce MERRY, a foundation model for general knowledge graph reasoning, and investigate its performance across two task categories: in-KG reasoning tasks (e.g., KGC) and out-of-KG tasks (e.g., KG question answering, KGQA). We not only utilize the structural information, but also the textual information in KGs. Specifically, we propose a multi-perspective Conditional Message Passing (CMP) encoding architecture to bridge the gap... | Yin Hua, Zhiqiang Liu, Mingyang Chen, Zheng Fang, Chi Man Wong, Lingxiao Li, ChiMan Vong, Huajun Chen, Wen Zhang |  |

Despite recent advancements in ST, the impact of the emotional content has been overlooked. First, we enhance the translation of emotional speech by adopting the GER paradigm: Finetuned an LLM to generate the translation based on the decoded N-best hypotheses. Moreover, we combine the emotion and sentiment labels into the LLM finetuning process to enable the model to consider the emotion content. In addition, we project the ST model’s latent representation into the LLM embedding space to further improve emotion recognition and translation. Experiments on an English-Chinese dataset show the effectiveness of the combination of GER, emotion and sentiment labels, and the projector for emotion-aware ST.

Unlike existing memory retrieval methods that rely solely on semantic similarity, we propose SynapticRAG, which uniquely combines temporal association triggers with biologically-inspired synaptic propagation mechanisms. Our approach uses temporal association triggers and synaptic-like stimulus propagation to identify relevant dialogue histories. A dynamic leaky integrate-and-fire mechanism then selects the most contextually appropriate memories. Experiments on four datasets of English, Chinese and Japanese show that compared to state-of-the-art memory retrieval methods, SynapticRAG achieves consistent improvements across multiple metrics up to 14.66% points.

However, such detailed responses are prone to hallucinations and factual inconsistencies, challenging their faithful evaluation. This work introduces HaluQuestQA, the first hallucination dataset with localized error annotations for human-written and model-generated LFQA answers. HaluQuestQA comprises 698 QA pairs with 1.8k span-level error annotations for five different error types by expert annotators, along with preference judgments. Using our collected data, we thoroughly analyze the shortcomings of long-form answers and find that they lack comprehensiveness and provide unhelpful references. We train an automatic feedback model on this dataset that predicts error spans with incomplete information and provides associated explanations. Finally, we propose a prompt-based approach, Error-Informed Refinement, that uses signals from the learned feedback model... | Rachneet Singh Sachdeva, Yixiao Song, Mohit Iyyer, Iryna Gurevych |  |

EMG tables contain extensive continuous numerical data, which current Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to interpret effectively. To address this issue, we propose EMGLLM, a data-to-text model specifically designed for medical examination tables. EMGLLM employs the EMG Alignment Encoder to simulate the process that doctors compare test values with reference values, aligning the data into word embeddings that reflect health degree. Additionally, we construct ETM, a dataset comprising 17,250 real cases and their corresponding diagnostic results, to support medical data-to-text tasks. Experimental results on ETM demonstrate that EMGLLM outperforms various baseline models in understanding EMG tables and generating high-quality diagnoses, which represents an effective paradigm for automatic diagnosis... | Zefei Long, Zhenbiao Cao, Wei Chen, Zhongyu Wei |  |

Existing speech-enabled LLMs often degrade conversational quality by modifying the LLM, thereby compromising its linguistic capabilities. In contrast, we propose LLMVoX, a lightweight 30M-parameter, LLM-agnostic, autoregressive streaming TTS system that generates high-quality speech with low latency, while fully preserving the capabilities of the base LLM. Our approach achieves a significantly lower Word Error Rate compared to speech-enabled LLMs, while operating at comparable latency. By decoupling speech synthesis from LLM processing via a multi-queue token streaming system, LLMVoX enables seamless, infinite-length dialogues. Its plug-and-play design also facilitates extension to various tasks with different backbones. Furthermore, LLMVoX generalizes to new languages with... | Sambal Shikhar, Mohammed Irfan Kurpath, Sahal Shaji Mullappilly, Jean Lahoud, Fahad Shahbaz Khan, Rao Muhammad Anwer, Salman H.

Although existing studies have focused on using Dialogue Act classification to capture the speaker’s intentions, few have explored the underlying power dynamics reflected by these dialogue acts. To this end, we present an online Dialogue Act Classification and Dynamic Power Analysis framework—Act2P, which is based on large language model. The framework combines the zero-shot learning capability of LLMs and introduces an online feedback classification method that allows for online classification with iterative feedback to previous stages, achieving efficient and accurate classification without the labeled data. Additionally, we also propose the PowerRank algorithm, which quantifies power dynamics through a graph-based structure.

However, their effectiveness for low-resource languages remains limited. In this study, we evaluate the performance of 55 publicly available LLMs on Maltese, a low-resource language, using a newly introduced benchmark covering 11 discriminative and generative tasks. Our experiments highlight that many models perform poorly, particularly on generative tasks, and that smaller fine-tuned models often perform better across all tasks. From our multidimensional analysis, we investigate various factors impacting performance. We conclude that prior exposure to Maltese during pre-training and instruction-tuning emerges as the most important factor. We also examine the trade-offs between fine-tuning and prompting, highlighting that while fine-tuning requires a higher initial... | Kurt Micallef, Claudia Borg |  |

In this work, we propose TRATES, a novel trait-specific and rubric-based cross-prompt AES framework that is generic yet specific to the underlying trait. The framework leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) that utilizes the trait grading rubrics to generate trait-specific features (represented by assessment questions), then assesses those features given an essay. The trait-specific features are eventually combined with generic writing-quality and prompt-specific features to train a simple classical regression model that predicts trait scores of essays from an unseen prompt. Experiments show that TRATES achieves a new state-of-the-art performance across all traits on a widely-used dataset, with the generated LLM-based features being the most significant. | Sohaila Eltanbouly, Salam Albatarni, Tamer Elsayed |  |

While existing semantic vector-based compression methods achieve promising performance, these methods fail to account for the intrinsic information density variations between context chunks, instead allocating soft tokens uniformly across context chunks. This uniform distribution inevitably diminishes allocation to information-critical regions. To address this, we propose Dynamic Allocation of Soft Tokens (DAST), a simple yet effective method that leverages the LLM’s intrinsic understanding of contextual relevance to guide compression. DAST combines perplexity-based local information with attention-driven global information to dynamically allocate soft tokens to the informative-rich chunks, enabling effective, context-aware compression. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DAST surpasses... | Shaoshen Chen, Yangning Li, Zishan Xu, Yongqin Zeng, Shunlong Wu, Xinshuo Hu, Zifei Shan, Xin Su, Jiwei Tang, Yinghui Li, HaiTao Zheng |  |

Previous methods focused on either graph structure learning or semantic reasoning, failing to integrate dual reasoning perspectives to handle different prediction scenarios. Moreover, they lack the capability to capture the inherent differences between historical and non-historical events, which limits their generalization across different temporal contexts. To this end, we propose a \*\*M\*\*ulti-\*\*E\*\*xpert \*\*S\*\*tructural-\*\*S\*\*emantic \*\*H\*\*ybrid (MESH) framework that employs three kinds of expert modules to integrate both structural and semantic information, guiding the reasoning process for different events.

In DPO, each preference pair, which serves as the foundation for learning, is typically constructed by first generating multiple responses to the same instruction and then annotating them to indicate the preferred choice. However, when the responses are highly similar, the weak preference signal can introduce annotation noise, which may hinder model optimization. Additionally, DPO suffers from the drawback of over-optimizing for verbose generation. A potential reason is the presence of length bias in preference datasets, which can lead to length exploitation. To address these issues, we propose a DPO-based \*\*m\*\*ulti-\*\*w\*\*eight \*\*p\*\*reference strength and length \*\*o\*\*ptimization (MWPO) method.

While MU has advanced significantly in unimodal (text or vision) settings, multimodal unlearning (MMU) remains underexplored due to the lack of open benchmarks for evaluating cross-modal data removal. To address this gap, we introduce CLEAR, the first open-source benchmark designed specifically for MMU. CLEAR contains 200 fictitious individuals and 3,700 images linked with corresponding question-answer pairs, enabling a thorough evaluation across modalities. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of 11 MU methods (e.g., SCRUB, gradient ascent, DPO) across four evaluation sets, demonstrating that jointly unlearning both modalities outperforms single-modality approaches.

Here, we examine the issue of reasoning from the perspective of claim verification. We propose a framework designed to break down any claim paired with evidence into atomic reasoning types that are necessary for verification. We use this framework to create RECV, the first claim verification benchmark, incorporating real-world claims, to assess the deductive and abductive reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The benchmark comprises of three datasets, covering reasoning problems of in creasing complexity. We evaluate three state of-the-art proprietary LLMs under multiple prompt settings. Our results show that while LLMs can address deductive reasoning prob lems, they consistently fail in cases of abductive reasoning.

We finetune six encoder models that have been pretrained with very different data (varying in size, language, and period) on a challenging event detection task in Early Modern Dutch archival texts. Each model is finetuned with 5 seeds on 15 different data splits, resulting in 450 finetuned models. We also pre-train a domain-specific Language Model on the target domain and fine-tune and evaluate it in the same way to provide an upper bound. Our experimental setup allows us to look at underresearched aspects of generalizability, namely i) shifts at multiple places in a modeling pipeline, ii) temporal and crosslingual shifts and iii) generalization over different initializations. The results show that none of the models reaches domain-specific model performance, demonstrating their incapacity to generalize. mBERT reaches highest F1 performance, and is relatively stable over different seeds and... | Stella Verkijk, Piek Vossen, Pia Sommerauer |  |

However, synthetic data generation via prompting LLMs remains challenging due to LLMs’ limited understanding of target data distributions and the complexity of prompt engineering, especially for structured formatted data. To address these issues, we introduce DiffLM, a controllable data synthesis framework based on variational autoencoder (VAE), which further (1) leverages diffusion models to reserve more information of original distribution and format structure in the learned latent distribution and (2) decouples the learning of target distribution knowledge from the LLM’s generative objectives via a plug-and-play latent feature injection module. As we observed significant discrepancies between the VAE’s latent representations and the real data distribution, the latent diffusion... | Ying Zhou, Xinyao Wang, Yulei Niu, Yaojie Shen, Lexin Tang, Fan Chen, Ben He, Le Sun, Longyin Wen |  |

While existing research predominantly focuses on performance gains driven by additional in-context examples, the impact on the trustworthiness of generated responses remains underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by investigating how increased examples influence predictive uncertainty—an essential aspect in trustworthiness. We begin by systematically quantifying uncertainty across different “shot” configurations in ICL, emphasizing the role of example quantity. Through uncertainty decomposition, we introduce a novel perspective on performance enhancement, focusing on epistemic uncertainty (EU). Our results reveal that additional examples reduce total uncertainty in both simple and complex tasks by injecting task-specific knowledge, thereby diminishing EU and enhancing performance. For complex tasks, these advantages emerge only after addressing the increased... | Yifei Wang, Yu Sheng, Linjing Li, Daniel Dajun Zeng |  |

This oversight leads to suboptimal user satisfaction and inefficient tool utilization, particularly when overlapping toolsets require nuanced selection based on contextual factors. To bridge this gap, we introduce ToolSpectrum, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs’ capabilities in personalized tool utilization. Specifically, we formalize two key dimensions of personalization, user profile and environmental factors, and analyze their individual and synergistic impacts on tool selection. Through extensive experiments on ToolSpectrum, we demonstrate that personalized tool selection significantly improves user experience across diverse scenarios.

However, handling complex instructions with multiple constraints remains challenging. Previous methods typically select preference pairs based on the number of constraints they satisfy, introducing noise where chosen examples may fail to follow some constraints and rejected examples may excel in certain respects over the chosen ones. To address the challenge of aligning with multiple preferences, we propose a simple yet effective method called Reverse Preference Optimization (RPO). It mitigates noise in preference pairs by dynamically reversing the constraints within the instruction to ensure the chosen response is perfect, alleviating the burden of extensive sampling and filtering to collect perfect responses. Besides, reversal also enlarges the gap between chosen and rejected responses, thereby clarifying the optimization direction and making it more robust to noise. We evaluate RPO on two... | Xiang Huang, TingEn Lin, Feiteng Fang, Yuchuan Wu, Hangyu Li, Yuzhong Qu, Fei Huang, Yongbin Li |  |

However, recent Large Language Model (LLM) based AVSR systems incur high computational costs due to the high temporal resolution of audio-visual speech processed by LLMs. In this work, we introduce an efficient multimodal speech LLM framework that minimizes token length while preserving essential linguistic content. Our approach employs an early AV-fusion module for streamlined feature integration, an audio-visual speech Q-Former that dynamically allocates tokens based on input duration, and a refined query allocation strategy with a speech rate predictor to adjust token allocation according to speaking speed of each audio sample. Extensive experiments on the LRS3 dataset show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with a WER of 0.72% while using only 3.5 tokens per second. Moreover, our approach not only reduces token usage by... | Jeong Hun Yeo, Hyeongseop Rha, Se Jin Park, Yong Man Ro |  |

DTS plays a crucial role in various NLP downstream tasks, but suffers from chronic problems: data shortage, labeling ambiguity, and incremental complexity of recently proposed solutions. On the other hand, Despite advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and reasoning strategies, these have rarely been applied to DTS. This paper introduces Def-DTS: Deductive Reasoning for Open-domain Dialogue Topic Segmentation, which utilizes LLM-based multi-step deductive reasoning to enhance DTS performance and enable case study using intermediate result. Our method employs a structured prompting approach for bidirectional context summarization, utterance intent classification, and deductive topic shift detection. In the intent classification process, we propose the generalizable intent list for domain-agnostic dialogue intent classification. Experiments in various dialogue settings demonstrate that Def-DTS... | Seungmin Lee, Yongsang Yoo, Minhwa Jung, Min Song |  |

One major threat is jailbreak attacks, where adversarial prompts bypass model safeguards to generate harmful or objectionable content. Researchers study jailbreak attacks to understand security and robustness of LLMs. However, existing jailbreak attack methods face two main challenges: (1) an excessive number of iterative queries, and (2) poor generalization across models. In addition, recent jailbreak evaluation datasets focus primarily on question-answering scenarios, lacking attention to text generation tasks that require accurate regeneration of toxic content.To tackle these challenges, we propose two contributions:(1) \*\*ICE\*\*, a novel black-box jailbreak method that employs \*\*I\*\*ntent \*\*C\*\*oncealment and div\*\*E\*\*rsion to effectively circumvent security constraints. \*\*ICE\*\* achieves high attack success rates (ASR) with a single query,... | Tiehan Cui, Yanxu Mao, Peipei Liu, Congying Liu, Datao You |  |

While this approach has proven effective, it inevitably increases substantial inference costs. Previous methods adopting token-level reduction without clear criteria result in poor performance compared to models trained with complete rationale. To address this challenge, we propose a novel sentence-level rationale reduction framework leveraging likelihood-based criteria, \*verbosity\*, to identify and remove redundant reasoning sentences. Unlike previous approaches, our method leverages \*verbosity\* to selectively remove redundant reasoning sentences while preserving reasoning capabilities. Our experimental results across various reasoning tasks demonstrate that our method improves performance by an average of 7.71% while reducing token generation by 19.87% compared to model trained with complete... | Joonwon Jang, Jaehee Kim, Wonbin Kweon, Seonghyeon Lee, Hwanjo Yu |  |

Although existing prompt optimization methods have discovered effective prompts, they often differ from sophisticated prompts carefully designed by human experts. Prompt design strategies, representing best practices for improving prompt performance, can be key to improving prompt optimization. Recently, a method termed the Autonomous Prompt Engineering Toolbox (APET) has incorporated various prompt design strategies into the prompt optimization process. In APET, the LLM is needed to implicitly select and apply the appropriate strategies because prompt design strategies can have negative effects. This implicit selection may be suboptimal due to the limited optimization capabilities of LLMs. This paper introduces Optimizing Prompts with sTrategy Selection (OPTS), which implements explicit selection mechanisms for prompt design. We propose three mechanisms, including a... | Rin Ashizawa, Yoichi Hirose, Nozomu Yoshinari, Kento Uchida, Shinichi Shirakawa |  |

Automatic story generation, a key advancement in artificial intelligence (AI), offers new possibilities for creating personalized content, exploring creative ideas, and enhancing interactive experiences. However, existing methods struggle to maintain narrative coherence and logical consistency. This disconnect compromises the overall storytelling experience, underscoring the need for substantial improvements. Inspired by human cognitive processes, we introduce Storyteller, a novel approach that systemically improves the coherence and consistency of automatically generated stories. Storyteller introduces a plot node structure based on linguistically grounded subject-verb-object (SVO) triplets, which capture essential story events and ensure a consistent logical flow. Unlike previous methods, Storyteller integrates two dynamic modules—the STORYLINE and narrative entity knowledge... | Jiaming Li, Yukun Chen, Ziqiang Liu, Minghuan Tan, Lei Zhang, Yunshui Li, Run Luo, Longze Chen, Jing Luo, Ahmadreza Argha, Hamid AlinejadRokny, Wei Zhou, Min Yang |  |

However, these individual LLMs show limitations in generalization and performance on complex tasks due to inherent training biases, model size constraints, and the quality or diversity of pre-training datasets. A promising direction is to efficiently harness the diverse capabilities of LLMs to overcome these individual limitations. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel LLM selection algorithm called SelectLLM, which efficiently directs input queries to the most suitable subset of LLMs from a large pool, ensuring that the selected models collectively provide accurate responses. SelectLLM employs a multi-label classifier and policy based on the classifier’s predictions and confidence scores in selecting an optimal, query-aware, and lightweight subset of LLMs. Our findings indicate that... | Kaushal Kumar Maurya, KV Aditya Srivatsa, Ekaterina Kochmar |  |

LLM APIs provide easy access to these models by streamlining deployment and usage. Combining LLMs with complementary strengths has been shown to yield substantial performance gains over a monolithic LLM. However, invoking a fixed set of LLM APIs for each query incurs higher API costs and increased inference latency. To address these limitations, we propose SkyLLM, a system composed of a set of estimators and an API selector, which federates multiple LLM APIs and dynamically assigns a non-empty subset of these APIs to each query prior to inference under cost and latency budgets. The selected subset consists of either a single LLM or multiple LLMs. A single LLM efficiently handles simple queries at low cost, whereas multiple LLMs are employed for more complex queries to overcome performance limitations. We evaluate SkyLLM against... | Heng Zhao, Yifei Zhu |  |

However, existing LLMs often fall short in adequately modeling underrepresented languages and cultures, such as Persian, limiting their applicability and acceptance. To address this, we construct diverse, high-quality datasets specifically tailored to Persian linguistic and cultural contexts, ensuring a more authentic and context-aware training process. Using these datasets, we develop Matina, a Persian-focused multi-expert model designed to embody Iranian cultural values and linguistic structures. Matina is trained by fine-tuning LLaMA3.1 8B-Instruct models across five domains: culinary, tourism, socio-culture, translation, and summarization. These experts are combined using a classifier to create a unified multi-expert system. By leveraging culturally aligned datasets, Matina... | Sara Bourbour Hosseinbeigi, Mohammad Ali Seif Kashani, Javad Seraj, Fatemeh Taherinezhad, Ali Nafisi, Fatemeh Nadi, Iman Barati, Hosein Hasani, Mostafa Amiri, Mostafa Masoudi |  |

While token-level models capture spatial and visual cues, entity-level models better represent logical dependencies and align with real-world use cases.We introduce PM3-KIE, a probabilistic multi-task meta-model that incorporates both fine-grained and coarse-grained models. It serves as a lightweight reasoning layer that jointly predicts entities and all appearances in a document. PM3-KIE incorporates domain-specific schema constraints to enforce logical consistency and integrates large language models for semantic validation, thereby reducing extraction errors.Experiments on two public datasets, DeepForm and FARA, show that PM3-KIE outperforms three state-of-the-art models and a stacked ensemble, achieving a statistically significant 2% improvement in F1 score. | Birgit Kirsch, Héctor AllendeCid, Stefan Rüping |  |

However, existing methods face a fundamental trade-off: they either rely on generic models with limited domain precision or require resource-intensive pipelines that depend on large labeled datasets and task-specific optimizations—such as custom hard-negative mining and denoising—resources rarely available in specialized domains.We propose TechniqueRAG, a domain-specific retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that bridges this gap by integrating off-the-shelf retrievers, instruction-tuned LLMs, and minimal text–technique pairs. Our approach addresses data scarcity by fine-tuning only the generation component on limited in-domain examples, circumventing the need for resource-intensive retrieval training. While conventional RAG mitigates hallucination by coupling retrieval and generation, its reliance on generic retrievers often introduces noisy candidates, limiting... | Ahmed Lekssays, Utsav Shukla, Husrev Taha Sencar, Md.

Recent studies have introduced Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task to enhance the models’ generalization abilities. However, these models perform forecasting via simultaneously learning two kinds of entangled knowledge in the TKG: (1) general patterns, i.e., invariant temporal structures shared across different scenarios; and (2) scenario information, i.e., factual knowledge engaged in specific scenario, such as entities and relations. As a result, the learning processes of these two kinds of knowledge may interfere with each other, which potentially impact the generalization abilities of the models. To enhance the generalization ability of LLMs on this task, in this paper, we propose a General-to-Specific learning framework (G2S) that disentangles the learning processes of the above two kinds of knowledge. In the general learning stage, we mask... | Long Bai, Zixuan Li, Xiaolong Jin, Jiafeng Guo, Xueqi Cheng, TatSeng Chua |  |

However, we argue that tokens serving different roles—specifically, reasoning tokens versus boilerplate tokens (e.g., those governing output format)—differ significantly in importance and learning complexity, necessitating their disentanglement and distinct treatment. To address this, we propose a novel Shuffle-Aware Discriminator (SHAD) for adaptive token discrimination. SHAD classifies tokens by exploiting predictability differences observed after shuffling input-output combinations across samples: boilerplate tokens, due to their repetitive nature among samples, maintain predictability, whereas reasoning tokens do not. Using SHAD, we propose the Reasoning-highlighted Fine-Tuning (RFT) method, which adaptively emphasizes reasoning tokens during fine-tuning, yielding notable performance gains over common Supervised... | Ziang Ye, Zhenru Zhang, Yang Zhang, Jianxin Ma, Junyang Lin, Fuli Feng |  |

Maintaining a balance between domain-specific enhancements and general model utility is a key challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach named APT (Weakness Case Acquisition and Iterative Preference Training) to enhance domain-specific performance with self-generated dis-preferred weakness data (bad cases and similar cases). APT uniquely focuses on training the model using only those samples where errors occur, alongside a small, similar set of samples retrieved for this purpose. This targeted training minimizes interference with the model’s existing knowledge base, effectively retaining generic capabilities. Experimental results on the LLama-2 and Mistral-V0.3 models across various benchmarks demonstrate that APT ensures no reduction in generic capacity and achieves superior performance on downstream tasks compared to various... | Jun Rao, Zepeng Lin, Xuebo Liu, Xiaopeng Ke, Lian Lian, Dong Jin, Shengjun Cheng, Jun Yu, Min Zhang |  |

Traditional EA methods typically embed entity information into vector space under the guidance of seed entity pairs, and align entities by calculating and comparing the similarity between entity embeddings. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), emerging methods are increasingly integrating LLMs with traditional methods to leverage external knowledge and improve EA accuracy. However, this integration also introduces additional computational complexity and operational overhead, and still requires seed pairs that are scarce and expensive to obtain. To address these challenges, we propose EasyEA, the first end-to-end EA framework based on LLMs that requires no training. EasyEA consists of three main stages: (1) Information Summarization, (2) Embedding and Feature Fusion, and (3) Candidate Selection. By automating the EA process, EasyEA significantly... | Jingwei Cheng, Chenglong Lu, Linyan Yang, Guoqing Chen, Fu Zhang |  |

As a multilabel classification task, the most commonly employed method involves introducing an adaptive threshold. Specifically, for an entity pair, if the scores of predicted relations exceed the threshold, the relations exist. However, we observe two phenomena that significantly weaken the model’s performance in DocRE: (1) as the label space (the number of relations) expands, the model’s performance gradually declines; (2) the model tends to prioritize predicting high-frequency relations in the long-tail problem. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative \*\*A\*\*daptive \*\*M\*\*ulti-\*\*T\*\*hreshold \*\*L\*\*oss (AMTL), which for the first time proposes to partition the label space into different sub-label spaces (thus reducing its overall size) and learn an adaptive threshold for each sub-label space.

Existing role-playing datasets mostly contribute to controlling role style and knowledge boundaries, but overlook role-playing in instruction-following scenarios. We introduce a fine-grained role-playing and instruction-following composite benchmark, named RoleMRC, including: (1) Multi-turn dialogues between ideal roles and humans, including free chats or discussions upon given passages; (2) Role-playing machine reading comprehension, involving response, refusal, and attempts according to passage answerability and role ability; (3) More complex scenarios with nested, multi-turn and prioritized instructions.

In pursuit of superhuman performance, LLMs have demonstrated significant potential in math and coding through self-improvement algorithms that rely on iterative training with self-generated data. This success stems from the clear reward signals in these environments, which provide a solid foundation for self-improvement. However, when it comes to general DA scenarios, two main challenges emerge: 1) ambiguous self-improvement reward signals and 2) lack of high-quality instruction fine-tuning datasets. This motivates this paper addresses how LLMs can adapt autonomously to new domains using only a large amount of unlabeled target corpora. Inspired by the human practice of self-reflection through open- and closed-book exercises to achieve domain generalization, we propose autonomous learning, which creates a self-improvement learning environment... | Ke Ji, Junying Chen, Anningzhe Gao, Wenya Xie, Xiang Wan, Benyou Wang |  |

We investigate the relationship between LLMs’ personality traits and risk-propensity, applying Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT) and the Big Five personality framework. We compare the behaviour of several LLMs to human baselines. Our findings show that the majority of the models investigated are risk-neutral rational agents, whilst displaying higher Conscientiousness and Agreeableness traits, coupled with lower Neuroticism. Interventions on Big Five traits, particularly Openness, influence the risk-propensity of several LLMs. Advanced models mirror human personality-risk patterns, suggesting that cognitive biases can be surfaced by optimal prompting. However, their distilled variants show no cognitive bias, suggesting limitations to knowledge transfer processes. Notably, Openness emerges as... | John Hartley, Conor Brian Hamill, Dale Seddon, Devesh Batra, Ramin Okhrati, Raad Khraishi |  |

Hate speech detection is commonly treated as a monolingual or multilingual sentence-level classification task. However, profane language tends to contain code-mixing, a combination of more than one language, which requires a more nuanced detection approach than binary classification. A general lack of available code-mixed datasets aggravates the problem. To address this issue, we propose five word-level annotated hate speech datasets, EN and DE from social networks, one subset of the DE-EN Offensive Content Detection Code-Switched Dataset, one DE-EN code-mixed German rap lyrics held-out test set, and a cross-domain held-out test set. We investigate the capacity of fine-tuned German-only, German-English bilingual, and German-English code-mixed token classification XLM-R models to generalize to code-mixed hate speech in German rap lyrics in zero-shot domain... | Karin Niederreiter, Dagmar Gromann |  |

Prior work has mainly focused on improving and evaluating the attribution quality of large language models (LLMs) in RAG, but this may come at the expense of inducing biases in the attribution of answers. We define and examine two aspects in the evaluation of LLMs in RAG pipelines, namely attribution sensitivity and bias with respect to authorship information. We explicitly inform an LLM about the authors of source documents, instruct it to attribute its answers, and analyze (i) how sensitive the LLM’s output is to the author of source documents, and (ii) whether the LLM exhibits a bias towards human-written or AI-generated source documents. We design an experimental setup in which we use counterfactual evaluation to study three LLMs in terms of their attribution sensitivity and bias in RAG pipelines.

While DPO has enabled significant progress in aligning English LLMs, multilingual preference alignment is hampered by data scarcity. To address this, we propose a novel approach that captures learned preferences from well-aligned English models by implicit rewards and transfers them to other languages through iterative training. Specifically, we derive an implicit reward model from the logits of an English DPO-aligned model and its corresponding reference model. This reward model is then leveraged to annotate preference relations in cross-lingual instruction-following pairs, using English instructions to evaluate multilingual responses. The annotated data is subsequently used for multilingual DPO fine-tuning, facilitating preference knowledge transfer from English to other languages.

In order to efficiently analyze the performance of models and diagnose failures in their answers, it is essential to develop an automated framework to systematically categorize and attribute errors. However, existing evaluation models lack error attribution capability. In this work, we establish a comprehensive Misattribution Framework with 6 primary and 15 secondary categories to facilitate in-depth analysis. Based on this framework, we present AttriData, a dataset specifically designed for error attribution, encompassing misattribution, along with the corresponding scores and feedback. We also propose MisAttributionLLM, a fine-tuned model on AttriData, which is the first general-purpose judge model capable of simultaneously generating score, misattribution, and feedback.

While large language models (LLMs) with in-context learning (ICL) capabilities have shown significant progress on various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, their few-shot performance on GEC remains suboptimal. This is mainly due to the challenge of retrieving suitable in-context demonstrations that capture error patterns instead of semantic similarity. In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs can inherently capture information related to grammatical errors through their internal states. From these states, we extract the Grammatical Error Representation (GER), an informative and semantically neutral encoding of grammatical errors. Our novel GER-based retrieval method significantly boosts performance in ICL settings on multilingual GEC datasets, improving the precision of correction. For high-resource languages, our results on 8B-sized open-source models match those of closed-source... | Guangyue Peng, Wei Li, Wen Luo, Houfeng Wang |  |

However, as the model’s capability improves, it is intuitive that its data preferences dynamically change, indicating the need for pretraining with different data at various training stages. To achieve it, we propose the Perplexity Difference (PD) based Preference Curriculum learning (PDPC) framework, which always perceives and uses the data preferred by LLMs to train and boost them. First, we introduce the PD metric to quantify the difference in how challenging a sample is for weak versus strong models. Samples with high PD are more challenging for weak models to learn and are more suitable to be arranged in the later stage of pretraining. Second, we propose the preference function to approximate and predict the data preference of the LLM at any training step, so as to complete the arrangement of the dataset offline and ensure continuous training without interruption.... | Xuemiao Zhang, Liangyu Xu, Feiyu Duan, Yongwei Zhou, Sirui Wang, Rongxiang Weng, Jingang Wang, Xunliang Cai |  |

This challenge remains relevant in the era of large language models (LLMs) and in-context learning (ICL); for example, ICL poses a new issue of interpreting which example in the few-shot examples contributed to identifying/solving the task. To this end, in this paper, we design synthetic diagnostic tasks of inductive reasoning, inspired by the generalization tests in linguistics; here, most in-context examples are ambiguous w.r.t. their underlying rule, and one critical example disambiguates the task demonstrated. The question is whether conventional input attribution (IA) methods can track such a reasoning process, i.e., identify the influential example, in ICL. Our experiments provide several practical findings; for example, a certain simple IA method works the best, and the larger the model, the generally harder it is to interpret the ICL with gradient-based IA methods. | Mengyu Ye, Tatsuki Kuribayashi, Goro Kobayashi, Jun Suzuki |  |

Obtaining such graphs defines the task of modal dependency parsing, which involves event and source identification along with the modal relations between them. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective solution based on biaffine attention that specifically optimizes against the domain-specific challenges of modal dependency parsing by integrating self-loop. We show that our approach, when coupled with data augmentation by leveraging the Large Language Models to translate annotations from one language to another, outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on English and Chinese datasets by 2% and 4% respectively. | Jayeol Chun, Nianwen Xue |  |

However, a holistic representation of an individual goes beyond surface-level facts or conversations to deeper thoughts and thinking. In this work, we introduce CharacterBot, a model designed to replicate both the linguistic patterns and distinctive thought patterns as manifested in the textual works of a character. Using Lu Xun, a renowned Chinese writer as a case study, we propose four training tasks derived from his 17 essay collections. These include a pre-training task focused on mastering external linguistic structures and knowledge, as well as three fine-tuning tasks: multiple-choice question answering, generative question answering, and style transfer, each aligning the LLM with Lu Xun’s internal ideation and writing style. To optimize learning across these... | Zixiao Wang, Duzhen Zhang, Ishita Agrawal, Shen Gao, Le Song, Xiuying Chen |  |

In pursuit of personalization, distilling key preference information from an individual’s historical data as instructional preference context to customize LLM generation has emerged as a promising direction. However, these methods face a fundamental limitation by overlooking the inter-user comparative analysis, which is essential for identifying the inter-user differences that truly shape preferences. To address this limitation, we propose Difference-aware Personalization Learning (DPL), a novel approach that emphasizes extracting inter-user differences to enhance LLM personalization. DPL strategically selects representative users for comparison and establishes a structured standard to extract meaningful, task-relevant differences for customizing LLM generation. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DPL... | Yilun Qiu, Xiaoyan Zhao, Yang Zhang, Yimeng Bai, Wenjie Wang, Hong Cheng, Fuli Feng, TatSeng Chua |  |

However, existing approaches primarily focus on text, with some recent advancements considering images, and they largely overlook videos, a rich source of multimodal knowledge capable of representing contextual details more effectively than any other modality. Also, while very recent studies explore the use of videos in response generation, they either predefine query-associated videos without retrieval or convert videos into textual descriptions, losing multimodal richness. To tackle these, we introduce VideoRAG, a novel framework that not only dynamically retrieves videos based on their relevance with queries but also utilizes both visual and textual information. The operation of VideoRAG is powered by recent Large Video Language Models (LVLMs), which enable the direct... | Soyeong Jeong, Kangsan Kim, Jinheon Baek, Sung Ju Hwang |  |

Previous works exhibit limited generalization ability in the target domain, demonstrating effective knowledge transfer only on seen slots while performing poorly on unseen slots. Although large language models (LLMs) can alleviate this issue to some extent, they underperform on seen slots compared to small models. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework that harnesses the power of a small model to augment the inferential capabilities of LLMs without additional training. Initially, we utilize target domain samples synthesized by LLMs as pre-calculated demonstrations, which are curated and chosen using confidence metrics derived from a small model. We further extract slot predictions from the small model to fully exploit its robust learning of familiar slots. Finally, during the inference process for test inputs, we integrate these... | Weizhen Li, Junbao Huang, Peijie Huang, Yuhong Xu, Jiekun Fan |  |

In particular, the variants (differences) at the word-level in manuscripts written in Biblical Hebrew are considered. A strong classifier (F1 value of 0.80) is trained to predict the category of difference between word pairs (‘plus/minus’, ‘inversion’, ‘morphological’, ‘lexical’ or ‘unclassifiable’) as present in collated (aligned) pairs of witnesses. The classifier is non-neural and makes use of the two words themselves as well as part-of-speech (POS) tags, hand-crafted rules per category and synthetically derived data. Other models experimented with include neural ones based on the state-of-the-art model for Modern Hebrew, DictaBERT. Other features whose relevance is tested are different types of morphological information pertaining to the word pairs and the Levenshtein distance between... | Iglika NikolovaStoupak, Maxime Amblard, Sophie RobertHayek, Frédérique Rey |  |

However, existing LLMs often produce simplistic and repetitive suggestions due to their limited ability in acquiring external knowledge for innovation. To address this problem, we introduce an enhanced planning and search methodology designed to boost the creative potential of LLM-based systems. Our approach involves an iterative process to purposely plan the retrieval of external knowledge, progressively enriching the idea generation with broader and deeper insights. Validation through automated and human assessments demonstrates that our framework substantially elevates the quality of generated ideas, particularly in novelty and diversity. The number of unique novel ideas produced by our framework is 3.4 times higher than without it. Moreover, our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art, generating at least 2.5 times more top-rated... | Xiang Hu, Hongyu Fu, Jinge Wang, Yifeng Wang, Zhikun Li, Renjun Xu, Yu Lu, Yaochu Jin, Lili Pan, Zhenzhong Lan |  |

Recent advances to that end include retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and knowledge graph-enhanced RAG (GraphRAG), whereas they are constrained by static knowledge bases and ineffective multimodal data integration. In response, we propose a Query-Driven Multimodal GraphRAG framework that dynamically constructs local knowledge graphs tailored to query semantics. Our approach 1) derives graph patterns from query semantics to guide knowledge extraction, 2) employs a multi-path retrieval strategy to pinpoint core knowledge, and 3) supplements missing multimodal information ad hoc. Experimental results on the MultimodalQA and WebQA datasets demonstrate that our framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised competitors, particularly excelling in cross-modal understanding of complex queries. | Chenyang Bu, Guojie Chang, Zihao Chen, CunYuan Dang, Zhize Wu, Yi He, Xindong Wu |  |

However, these models could offer biased, hallucinated, or non-factual responses camouflaged by their fluency and realistic appearance. Uncertainty estimation is the key method to address this challenge. While research efforts in uncertainty estimation are ramping up, there is a lack of comprehensive and dedicated surveys on LLM uncertainty estimation. This survey presents four major avenues of LLM uncertainty estimation. Furthermore, we perform extensive experimental evaluations across multiple methods and datasets. At last, we provide critical and promising future directions for LLM uncertainty estimation. | Zhiqiu Xia, Jinxuan Xu, Yuqian Zhang, Hang Liu |  |

In this context, evaluations are mostly based on single-value metrics such as QA accuracy. However, these metrics often fail to capture the nuanced retention of harmful knowledge components, making it difficult to assess the true effectiveness of unlearning. To address this issue, we propose UNCD (UNlearning evaluation using Cognitive Diagnosis), a novel framework that leverages Cognitive Diagnosis Modeling for fine-grained evaluation of LLM unlearning. Our dedicated benchmark, UNCD-Cyber, provides a detailed assessment of the removal of dangerous capabilities. Moreover, we introduce UNCD-Agent, which refines unlearning by diagnosing knowledge remnants and generating targeted unlearning data. Extensive experiments across eight unlearning methods and two base models demonstrate that UNCD not only... | Yicheng Lang, Kehan Guo, Yue Huang, Yujun Zhou, Haomin Zhuang, Tianyu Yang, Yao Su, Xiangliang Zhang |  |

Due to the sheer volume and rapid growth of medical literature and the high cost of curation, there is a critical need to investigate Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to identify, appraise, synthesize, summarize, and disseminate evidence in EBM. This survey presents an in-depth review of 129 research studies on leveraging NLP for EBM, illustrating its pivotal role in enhancing clinical decision-making processes. The paper systematically explores how NLP supports the five fundamental steps of EBM—Ask, Acquire, Appraise, Apply, and Assess. The review not only identifies current limitations within the field but also proposes directions for future research, emphasizing the potential for NLP to revolutionize EBM by refining evidence extraction, evidence synthesis, appraisal, summarization, enhancing data... | Zihan Xu, Haotian Ma, Yihao Ding, Gongbo Zhang, Chunhua Weng, Yifan Peng |  |

A Functional Analysis](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.1104/) |  | 0 | Compositionality is a key aspect of human intelligence, essential for reasoning and generalization. While transformer-based models have become the de facto standard for many language modeling tasks, little is known about how they represent compound words, and whether these representations are compositional. In this study, we test compositionality in Mistral, OpenAI Large, and Google embedding models, and compare them with BERT. First, we evaluate compositionality in the representations by examining six diverse models of compositionality (addition, multiplication, dilation, regression, etc.). We find that ridge regression, albeit linear, best accounts for compositionality. Surprisingly, we find that the classic vector addition model performs almost as well as any other model. Next, we verify that most embedding models are highly compositional, while BERT shows much poorer compositionality. We verify and visualize our findings with a synthetic dataset consisting of fully transparent... | Aishik Nagar, Ishaan Singh Rawal, Mansi Dhanania, Cheston Tan |  |

Retrievers have been introduced in knowledge-grounded dialog systems to improve knowledge acquisition. In knowledge-grounded dialog systems, when conditioning on a given context, there may be multiple relevant and correlated knowledge pieces. However, knowledge pieces are usually assumed to be conditionally independent in current retriever models. To address this issue, we propose Entriever, an energy-based retriever. The Entriever directly models the candidate retrieval results as a whole instead of modeling the knowledge pieces separately, with the relevance score defined by an energy function. We explore various architectures of energy functions and different training methods for Entriever, and show that Entriever substantially outperforms the strong cross-encoder baseline in knowledge retrieval tasks.... | Yucheng Cai, Ke Li, Yi Huang, Junlan Feng, Zhijian Ou |  |

Existing feature alignment methods, which aim to reduce the discrepancies between domains, are often susceptible to task interference during training. Additionally, data distribution alignment methods, which rely on existing data to synthesize new training samples, inherently introduce noise. To deal with these challenges, a new cross-domain rumor detection method, MONTROSE, is proposed. It combines LLM-driven Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) data synthesis to generate high-quality synthetic data for the target domain and a domain-sharpness-aware (DSAM) self-refinement approach to train rumor detection models with these synthetic data effectively. Experiments demonstrate the superior performance of MONTROSE in cross-domain rumor detection. | Shanshan Liu, Menglong Lu, Zhen Huang, Zejiang He, Liu Liu, Zhigang Sun, Dongsheng Li |  |

Existing tool learning studies primarily focus on the general-purpose tool-use capability, which addresses explicit user requirements in instructions. However, they overlook the importance of personalized tool-use capability, leading to an inability to handle implicit user preferences. To address the limitation, we first formulate the task of personalized tool learning, which integrates user’s interaction history towards personalized tool usage. To fill the gap of missing benchmarks, we construct PEToolBench, featuring diverse user preferences reflected in interaction history under three distinct personalized settings, and encompassing a wide range of tool-use scenarios. Moreover, we propose a framework PEToolLLaMA to adapt LLMs to the personalized tool learning task, which is trained through supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization.... | Qiancheng Xu, Yongqi Li, Heming Xia, Fan Liu, Min Yang, Wenjie Li |  |

However, challenges persist in achieving global understanding and aligning responses with human ethical and quality preferences. To address these issues, we propose GraphMPA, a comprehensive graph-based framework with mode-seeking preference alignment. Our approach constructs a hierarchical document graph using a general similarity measurement, mimicking human cognitive processes for information understanding and synthesis. Additionally, we introduce mode-seeking preference optimization to better align model outputs with human preferences through probability-matching constraints. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our GraphMPA. | Quanwei Tang, Sophia Yat Mei Lee, Junshuang Wu, Dong Zhang, Shoushan Li, Erik Cambria, Guodong Zhou |  |

Existing datasets for this task are derived from various computer science (CS) domains, whereas non-CS domains are completely ignored. In this paper, we introduce a novel evaluation benchmark for scientific NLI, called MisMatched. The new MisMatched benchmark covers three non-CS domains–Psychology, Engineering, and Public Health, and contains 2,700 human annotated sentence pairs. We establish strong baselines on MisMatched using both Pre-trained Small Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our best performing baseline shows a Macro F1 of only 78.17% illustrating the substantial headroom for future improvements. In addition to introducing the MisMatched benchmark, we show that incorporating sentence pairs having an implicit scientific NLI relation between them in model training improves their performance on... | Firoz Shaik, Mobashir Sadat, Nikita Gautam, Doina Caragea, Cornelia Caragea |  |

However, existing routing methods face practical limitations that hinder scalability in large-scale applications and struggle to keep up with the rapid growth of the large language model (LLM) ecosystem. To tackle these challenges, we propose TagRouter, a training-free model routing method designed to optimize the synergy among multiple LLMs for open-domain text generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that TagRouter outperforms 13 baseline methods, increasing the accept rate of system by 6.15% and reducing costs by 17.20%, achieving optimal cost-efficiency. Our findings provides the LLM community with an efficient and scalable solution for model ensembling, offering users an evolvable “super model.” | Zhou Chen, Zhiqiang Wei, Yuqi Bai, Xue Xiong, Jianmin Wu |  |

However, the precise conditions under which LLMs switch between reasoning and memorization during text generation remain unclear. In this work, we provide a mechanistic understanding of LLMs’ reasoning-memorization dynamics by identifying a set of linear features in the model’s residual stream that govern the balance between genuine reasoning and memory recall. These features not only distinguish reasoning tasks from memory-intensive ones but can also be manipulated to causally influence model performance on reasoning tasks. Additionally, we show that intervening in these reasoning features helps the model more accurately activate the most relevant problem-solving capabilities during answer generation. Our findings offer new insights into the underlying... | Yihuai Hong, Meng Cao, Dian Zhou, Lei Yu, Zhijing Jin |  |

Recently, process-level reward models (PRMs) were proposed to provide step-wise rewards that facilitate reinforcement learning and data production during training and guide LLMs toward correct steps during inference, thereby improving reasoning accuracy. However, existing benchmarks of PRMs are text-based and focus on error detection, neglecting other scenarios like reasoning search. To address this gap, we introduce MPBench, a comprehensive, multi-task, multimodal benchmark designed to systematically assess the effectiveness of PRMs in diverse scenarios. MPBench employs three evaluation paradigms, each targeting a specific role of PRMs in the reasoning process: (1) Step Correctness, which assesses the correctness of each intermediate reasoning step; (2) Answers Aggregation, which aggregates multiple solutions... | Xu Zhao Pan, Pengfei Zhou, Jiaxin Ai, Wangbo Zhao, Kai Wang, Xiaojiang Peng, Wenqi Shao, Hongxun Yao, Kaipeng Zhang |  |

Existing benchmarks for MLM agents in interactive environments are limited by their focus on a single environment, lack of detailed and generalized evaluation methods, and thecomplexities of constructing tasks and evaluators. To overcome these limitations, we introduce CRAB, the first cross-environment agent benchmark framework, incorporating a graph-based fine-grained evaluation method and an efficient task generation method. Our framework supports multiple devices and can be easily extended to any environment with a Python interface.

With the expansion of Large Language Models (LLMs) context windows, “novel” avenues emerge. This study aims to extend the boundaries of Natural Language Generation (NLG) evaluation by exploring LLMs’ capabilities in more challenging long-form fiction. We propose a new multi-level evaluation framework that incorporates ten metrics across the Macro, Meso, and Micro levels. An annotated fiction dataset, sourced from human authors, LLMs, and human-AI collaborations in both English and Chinese is then constructed. Human evaluation reveals notable disparities between LLM-generated and human-authored fictions, particularly the “high-starting, low-ending” pattern in LLM outputs. We further probe ten high-performing LLMs through different prompt templates, achieving moderate correlations by strategically utilizing diverse LLMs tailored to different levels, as an initial step towards better... | Wenqing Wang, Mingqi Gao, Xinyu Hu, Xiaojun Wan |  |

Previous studies have typically facilitated this transfer by translating and aligning labels or targets. However, these methods cannot effectively perform cross-lingual transfer of the complex reasoning processes in stance detection. To address this challenge, we propose a reinforcement learning framework using cross-lingual Chain-of-Thought (CoT) alignment, referred to as RCCA. Specifically, we adopt a cross-lingual CoT alignment strategy to obtain the high-quality CoTs generated from target language inputs. After that, we leverage reinforcement learning by sampling CoTs and assigning rewards according to predefined rules, aiming to enhance the model’s generalization capabilities in the target language. Experimental results on four multilingual datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms competitive methods. | Binghui Li, Minghui Zou, Xiaowang Zhang, Shizhan Chen, Zhiyong Feng |  |

Specifically, when instructions are subject to multiple constraints, some of which are somewhat ambiguous, LLMs often fail to produce answers that satisfy all constraints, limiting their effectiveness in various tasks. To address this challenge, we examine the different constraints in the instructions and discover that the difficulty of determining whether an answer meets a constraint varies widely, from extremely straightforward to exceptionally perplexing. Correspondingly, we propose to assign constraints to different constraint levels. Furthermore, inspired by chain-of-thought (CoT) and self-taught reasoner (STaR), we propose a two-stage method named CARE-STaR (Constraint-AwaRE STaR). Our method distinguishes constraints within instructions by generating different CoTs and guides LLMs to autonomously learn optimal answers by setting the positive rewards to the CoTs that... | Zhiliang Li, Bo Tang, Yijun Niu, Beihong Jin, Qiwen Shi, Yuchen Feng, Zhiyu Li, Jie Hu, Mingchuan Yang, Feiyu Xiong |  |

These words, often polyfunctional, give rise to nuanced and often quite disparate semantic/discourse effects,as exemplified by the diverse uses of the particle \*just\* (e.g., exclusive, temporal, emphatic). This work investigates the capacity of LLMs to distinguish the fine-grained senses of English \*just\*, a well-studied example in formal semantics, using data meticulously created and labeled by expert linguists. Our findings reveal that while LLMs exhibit some ability to differentiate between broader categories, they struggle to fully capture more subtle nuances, highlighting a gap in their understanding of discourse particles. | William Berkeley Sheffield, Kanishka Misra, Valentina Pyatkin, Ashwini Deo, Kyle Mahowald, Junyi Jessy Li |  |

Prior research has used structures such as trees or graphs to guide LLMs in searching for optimal solutions. These methods are time-consuming and require a strong reward model (RM) to support effective solution space exploration. Tournament-style approaches eliminate the reliance on RMs through comparative evaluation but suffer from transitivity dilemmas, leading to unstable ordering. To address these issues, we propose War of Thoughts (\*\*WoT\*\*), a novel post-hoc method that enhances reasoning without finetuning. WoT comprises two distinct stages: (1) \*Exploration\*, in which diverse and meaningful candidate solutions are generated through contrastive demonstrations and multi-granularity reasoning specifications; and (2) \*Competition\*, where these candidate solutions are subjected to multiple rounds of matchups... | Yibin Chen, Jinyi Liu, Yan Zheng, Yifu Yuan, Jianye Hao |  |

Enhancing Mental Disorder Detection via Selective Reasoning Distillation](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.1119/) |  | 0 | The detection of mental health problems from social media and the interpretation of these results have been extensively explored. Research has shown that incorporating clinical symptom information into a model enhances domain expertise, improving its detection and interpretation performance. While large language models (LLMs) are shown to be effective for generating explanatory rationales in mental health detection, their substantially big parameter size and high computational cost limit their practicality. Reasoning distillation transfers this ability to smaller language models (SLMs), but inconsistencies in the relevance and domain alignment of LLM-generated rationales pose a challenge. This paper investigates how rationale quality impacts SLM performance in mental health detection and explanation generation. We hypothesize that ensuring high-quality and domain-relevant rationales enhances the distillation. To this end, we propose a framework that selects rationales based on their... | Hoyun Song, Huije Lee, Jisu Shin, Sukmin Cho, Changgeon Ko, Jong C. Park |  |

However, existing research has overlooked the impact of hyperparameter choices, and also lacks a comprehensive evaluation of the out-of-domain table understanding ability and the general capabilities of these table LLMs. In this paper, we evaluate these abilities in existing table LLMs, and find significant declines in both out-of-domain table understanding and general capabilities as compared to their base models. Through systematic analysis, we show that hyperparameters, such as learning rate, can significantly influence both table-specific and general capabilities. Contrary to the previous table instruction-tuning work, we demonstrate that smaller learning rates and fewer training instances can enhance table understanding while preserving general capabilities.

In this work, we introduce a novel approach to interpret LLMs generation process through the lens of an explicit Bayesian framework by inferring latent topic variables via variational inference. Specifically, we leverage a variational autoencoder-based neural topic model to dynamically approximate the posterior distribution over the high-level latent topic variables at each generation step. By reconstructing the LLM’s next-token predictions through these latent topics and maintaining a regularized latent space, our method yields interpretable and diverse topic representations but also has the ability to effectively captures semantic shifts throughout the text. We validate our approach on multiple datasets, showing that our latent topics outperform state-of-the-art topic models on intrinsic measures of coherence and diversity. Furthermore, we demonstrate... | Raymond Li, Chuyuan Li, Gabriel Murray, Giuseppe Carenini |  |

We present a method that refines silver-standard ISCO labels by consolidating them with predictions from pre-fine-tuned models, using large language model (LLM) evaluations to resolve discrepancies. The refined labels are used in Multiple Negatives Ranking (MNR) training for SentenceBERT-based classification. This approach substantially improves performance, raising Top-1 accuracy on silver data from 37.2% to 58.3% and reaching up to 80% precision on held-out data—an over 30-point gain validated by both GPT and human raters. The model benefits from cross-lingual transfer, with particularly strong gains in French and Italian. These results demonstrate hat LLM-guided label refinement can substantially improve multilingual occupation classification in fine-grained taxonomies such as CH-ISCO with 670 classes. | AnnSophie Gnehm, Simon Clematide |  |

While several techniques exist for inference optimization, output compression remains relatively unexplored, with only a few preliminary efforts addressing this aspect. In this work, we first benchmark 12 decoder-only LLMs across 5 datasets, revealing that these models often produce responses that are substantially longer than necessary. We then conduct a comprehensive quality assessment of LLM responses, formally defining six information categories present in LLM responses. We show that LLMs often tend to include redundant or additional information besides the minimal answer. To address this issue of long responses by LLMs, we explore several simple and intuitive prompt-engineering strategies.Empirical evaluation shows that appropriate prompts targeting length reduction and controlling information... | Soham Poddar, Paramita Koley, Janardan Misra, Niloy Ganguly, Saptarshi Ghosh |  |

However, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks due to three key limitations: (1) the inefficiency and high cost of human annotation, (2) the vast diversity of potential adversarial attacks, and (3) the risk of feedback bias and reward hacking. To address these challenges, we introduce Adversarial Preference Learning (APL), an iterative adversarial training method incorporating three key innovations. First, a direct harmfulness metric based on the model’s intrinsic preference probabilities, eliminating reliance on external assessment. Second, a conditional generative attacker that synthesizes input-specific adversarial variations. Third, an iterative framework with automated closed-loop feedback, enabling continuous adaptation through vulnerability discovery and mitigation. Experiments on Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 demonstrate that APL significantly enhances... | Yuanfu Wang, Pengyu Wang, Chenyang Xi, Bo Tang, Junyi Zhu, Wenqiang Wei, Chen Chen, Chao Yang, Jingfeng Zhang, Chaochao Lu, Yijun Niu, Keming Mao, Zhiyu Li, Feiyu Xiong, Jie Hu, Mingchuan Yang |  |

However, MBA has been increasingly exploited by malware developers to evade detection and cause significant real-world problems. Traditional MBA deobfuscation methods often consider these expressions as part of a black box and overlook their internal semantic information. To bridge this gap, we propose a truth table, which is an automatically constructed semantic representation of an expression’s behavior that does not rely on external resources. The truth table is a mathematical form that represents the output of expression for all possible combinations of input. We also propose a general and extensible guided MBA deobfuscation framework (gMBA) that modifies a Transformer-based neural encoder-decoder Seq2Seq architecture to incorporate this semantic guidance. Experimental results and in-depth analysis show that integrating expression semantics... | Youjeong Noh, JoonYoung Paik, Jingun Kwon, EunSun Cho |  |

Despite the emergence of numerous DSE systems, their unified evaluation remains inadequate, significantly hindering the field’s advancement. This problem is largely attributed to existing benchmark paradigms, which exhibit fragmented and localized characteristics. To offer a thorough evaluation of DSE systems, we introduce a novel benchmark named READoc, which defines DSE as a realistic task of converting unstructured PDFs into semantically rich Markdown. The READoc dataset is derived from 3,576 diverse and real-world documents from arXiv, GitHub, and Zenodo. In addition, we develop a DSE Evaluation S3uite comprising Standardization, Segmentation and Scoring modules, to conduct a unified evaluation of state-of-the-art DSE approaches. By evaluating a range of pipeline tools, expert visual models, and general Vision-Language Models, we identify the gap between current work and the unified,... | Zichao Li, Aizier Abulaiti, Yaojie Lu, Xuanang Chen, Jia Zheng, Hongyu Lin, Xianpei Han, Shanshan Jiang, Bin Dong, Le Sun |  |

This paper introduces TicTac, a supervised fine-tuning model for automatic text dating. Unlike the existing models that always ignore the temporal relatedness of documents, TicTac has the ability to learn temporal semantic information, which is helpful for capturing the temporal implications over long-time span corpora. As a fine-tuning framework, TicTac employs a contrastive learning-based approach to model two types of temporal relations of diachronic documents. TicTac also adopts a metric learning approach, where the temporal distance between a historical text and its category label is estimated, which benefits to learn temporal semantic information on texts with temporal ordering. Experiments on two diachronic corpora show that our model effectively captures the temporal semantic... | Han Ren, Minna Peng |  |

Current approaches either assemble specialized expert models or directly generate page-level content autoregressively, facing integration overhead, efficiency bottlenecks, and layout structure degradation despite their decent performance. To address these limitations, we present Dolphin ( Document Image Parsing via Heterogeneous Anchor Prompting), a novel multimodal document image parsing model following an analyze-then-parse paradigm. In the first stage, Dolphin generates a sequence of layout elements in reading order. These heterogeneous elements, serving as anchors and coupled with task-specific prompts, are fed back to Dolphin for parallel content parsing in the second stage. To train Dolphin, we construct a large-scale dataset of over 30 million samples, covering multi-granularity parsing tasks. Through comprehensive evaluations on both prevalent... | Hao Feng, Shu Wei, Xiang Fei, Wei Shi, Yingdong Han, Lei Liao, Jinghui Lu, Binghong Wu, Qi Liu, Chunhui Lin, Jingqun Tang, Hao Liu, Can Huang |  |

Detecting and analyzing parody can be challenging and is often reliant on context, yet it plays a crucial role in understanding cultural values, promoting subcultures, and enhancing self-expression. However, the study of parody is hindered by limited available data and deficient diversity in current datasets. To bridge this gap, we built seven parody datasets from both English and Chinese corpora, with 14,755 annotated users and 21,210 annotated comments in total. To provide sufficient context information, we also collect replies and construct user-interaction graphs to provide richer contextual information, which is lacking in existing datasets. With these datasets, we test traditional methods and Large Language Models (LLMs) on three key tasks: (1) parody detection, (2) comment sentiment analysis with parody, and (3) user... | Yilun Zheng, Sha Li, Fangkun Wu, Yang Ziyi, Lin Hongchao, Zhichao Hu, Cai Xinjun, Ziming Wang, Jinxuan Chen, Sitao Luan, Jiahao Xu, Lihui Chen |  |

Utilizing the PhonologyBench benchmark, we assess tasks like rhyme word generation, g2p conversion, and syllable counting. Our evaluations across 12 LLMs reveal that while few-shot learning offers inconsistent gains, the introduction of a novel Pedagogically-motivated Participatory Chain-of-Thought (P-CoT) prompt, which is anchored in educational theories like scaffolding and discovery learning, consistently enhances performance. This method leverages structured guidance to activate latent phonological abilities, achieving up to 52% improvement and even surpassing human baselines in certain tasks. Future work could aim to optimize P-CoT prompts for specific models or explore their application across different linguistic domains. | Dongjun Jang, Youngchae Ahn, Hyopil Shin |  |

However, existing code benchmarks remain static, consisting of fixed datasets with predefined problems. This makes them vulnerable to memorization during training, where LLMs recall specific test cases instead of generalizing to new problems, leading to data contamination and unreliable evaluation results. To address these issues, we introduce DynaCode, a dynamic, complexity-aware benchmark that overcomes the limitations of static datasets. DynaCode evaluates LLMs systematically using a complexity-aware metric, incorporating both code complexity and call-graph structures. DynaCode achieves large-scale diversity, generating up to 189 million unique nested code problems across 4 units of code complexity and 16 types of call graphs. Results on 12 latest LLMs show an average performance drop of 16.8 to 45.7 compared to MBPP+, with performance progressively... | Wenhao Hu, Jinhao Duan, Chunchen Wei, Li Zhang, Yue Zhang, Kaidi Xu |  |

However, LLMs struggle to answer queries reliably when the provided context lacks information, often resorting to ungrounded speculation or internal knowledge. Groundedness – generating responses strictly supported by the context – is essential for ensuring factual consistency and trustworthiness. This study focuses on detecting whether a given query is grounded in a document provided in context before the costly answer generation by LLMs. Such a detection mechanism can significantly reduce both inference time and resource consumption. We show that lightweight, task-specific encoder models such as RoBERTa and NomicBERT, fine-tuned on curated datasets, can achieve accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Llama3 8B and GPT4o, in groundedness detection while reducing inference latency by orders of magnitude. | Istabrak Abbes, Gabriele Prato, Quentin Fournier, Fernando Rodriguez, Alaa Boukhary, Adam Elwood, Sarath Chandar |  |

While OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for English and other languages benefits from large datasets and well-established benchmarks, Arabic OCR faces unique challenges due to its cursive script, right-to-left text flow, and complex typographic and calligraphic features. We present KITAB-Bench, a comprehensive Arabic OCR benchmark that fills the gaps in current evaluation systems. Our benchmark comprises 8,809 samples across 9 major domains and 36 subdomains, encompassing diverse document types including handwritten text, structured tables, and specialized coverage of 21 chart types for business intelligence.

In this work, we examine the alignment of LLMs with human annotations in five offensive language datasets, comprising approximately 220K annotations. While demographic traits, particularly race, influence alignment, these effects vary across datasets and are often entangled with other factors. Confounders introduced in the annotation process—such as document difficulty, annotator sensitivity, and within-group agreement—account for more variation in alignment patterns than demographic traits. Alignment increases with annotator sensitivity and group agreement, and decreases with document difficulty. Our results underscore the importance of multi-dataset analyses and confounder-aware methodologies in developing robust measures of demographic bias. | Shayan Alipour, Indira Sen, Mattia Samory, Tanushree Mitra |  |

This trend threatens to exacerbate existing social inequalities and limits LLM applications, yet the research community lacks operationalized performance measurements in DA. We present a framework that comprehensively assesses LLMs’ DA modeling capabilities across four dimensions: fidelity, understanding, quality, and diglossia. We evaluate nine LLMs in eight DA varieties and provide practical recommendations. Our evaluation suggests that LLMs do not produce DA as well as they understand it, not because their DA fluency is poor, but because they are reluctant to generate DA. Further analysis suggests that current post-training can contribute to bias against DA, that few-shot examples can overcome this deficiency, and that otherwise no measurable features of input text correlate well with LLM DA performance. | Nathaniel Romney Robinson, Shahd Abdelmoneim, Kelly Marchisio, Sebastian Ruder |  |

This study answers an unexplored question about the impact of different question types on LLM accuracy on reasoning tasks. We investigate the performance of five LLMs on three different types of questions using quantitative and deductive reasoning tasks. The performance metrics include accuracy in the reasoning steps and choosing the final answer. Key Findings: (1) Significant differences exist in LLM performance across different question types. (2) Reasoning accuracy does not necessarily correlate with the final selection accuracy. (3) The number of options and the choice of words, influence LLM performance. | Seok Hwan Song, Mohna Chakraborty, Qi Li, Wallapak Tavanapong |  |

While prompt engineering has shown great promise, identifying optimal prompts remains a significant challenge, particularly for low-resource languages, which often face higher computational costs due to increased token generation and limited gold standard task data. In response, we propose MutantPrompt, a framework that leverages multi-armed bandit algorithms to efficiently identify optimal prompts tailored to low-resource languages. By framing prompt selection as an exploration-exploitation problem under a fixed computational budget, the framework dynamically balances exploring new prompts with exploiting known high-performing ones. We demonstrate the framework’s effectiveness across multiple low-resource Indic language tasks, including classification, question-answering and causal reasoning using three small... | Arijit Nag, Animesh Mukherjee, Niloy Ganguly, Soumen Chakrabarti |  |

While manual methods (e.g., “chain-of-thought,” “step-by-step” prompts) can be effective, they typically rely on intuition and do not automatically refine prompts over time. In contrast, automatic prompt optimization employing heuristic-based search algorithms can systematically explore and improve prompts with minimal human oversight. This survey proposes a comprehensive taxonomy of these methods, categorizing them by where optimization occurs, what is optimized, what criteria drive the optimization, which operators generate new prompts, and which iterative search algorithms are applied. We further highlight specialized datasets and tools that support and accelerate automated prompt refinement. We conclude by discussing key open challenges, pointing toward future... | Wendi Cui, Jiaxin Zhang, Zhuohang Li, Hao Sun, Damien Lopez, Kamalika Das, Bradley A. Malin, Kumar Sricharan |  |

However, their applicability is limited by challenges such as high computational costs and robustness issues. In this work, we identify and systematically evaluate a critical yet overlooked challenge: sycophancy, where agents reinforce each other’s responses instead of critically engaging with the debate. This behavior inflates computational costs by requiring additional debate rounds to reach consensus, limiting the efficiency of multi-agent LLM systems. Through experiments on six benchmark reasoning datasets across three models, we analyze the impact of sycophancy and its role in reducing the reliability of multi-agent debate. Motivated by our findings, we propose CONSENSAGENT, a novel framework that dynamically refines prompts based on agent interactions to mitigate sycophancy. CONSENSAGENT improves accuracy of the debate while maintaining... | Priya Pitre, Naren Ramakrishnan, Xuan Wang |  |

Given this problem has not yet been tractable, we suggest targeting a key failure mechanism: the failure of safety to generalize across semantically equivalent inputs. We further focus the target by requiring desirable tractability properties of attacks to study: explainability, transferability between models, and transferability between goals. We perform red-teaming within this framework by uncovering new vulnerabilities to multi-turn, multi-image, and translation-based attacks. These attacks are semantically equivalent by our design to their single-turn, single-image, or untranslated counterparts, enabling systematic comparisons; we show that the different structures yield different safety outcomes. We then demonstrate the potential for this framework to enable new defenses by proposing a Structure Rewriting Guardrail, which converts an input to a structure more conducive to safety assessment. This guardrail significantly improves... | Julius Broomfield, Tom Gibbs, George Ingebretsen, Ethan KosakHine, Tia Nasir, Jason Zhang, Reihaneh Iranmanesh, Sara Pieri, Reihaneh Rabbany, Kellin Pelrine |  |

Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a cornerstone for preference alignment but is constrained by reliance on fixed divergence measures and limited feature transformations. We introduce DPO-Kernels, an innovative enhancement of DPO that integrates kernel methods to overcome these challenges through four key contributions: (i) Kernelized Representations: These representations enhance divergence measures by using polynomial, RBF, Mahalanobis, and spectral kernels for richer feature transformations. Additionally, we introduce a hybrid loss that combines embedding-based loss with probability-based loss; (ii) Divergence Alternatives: Beyond Kullback–Leibler (KL), we incorporate Jensen-Shannon, Hellinger, Rényi, Bhattacharyya, Wasserstein, and other... | Amitava Das, Suranjana Trivedy, Danush Khanna, Yaswanth Narsupalli, Basab Ghosh, Rajarshi Roy, Gurpreet Singh, Vinija Jain, Vasu Sharma, Aishwarya Naresh Reganti, Aman Chadha |  |

If different systems produce different outcomes for the same content, it undermines consistency and predictability, leading to moderation decisions that appear arbitrary or unfair. Analyzing seven leading models—dedicated Moderation Endpoints (OpenAI, Mistral), frontier LLMs (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, Mistral Large, DeepSeek V3), and specialized content moderation APIs (Google Perspective API)—we demonstrate that moderation system choice fundamentally determines hate speech classification outcomes. Using a novel synthetic dataset of 1.3+ million sentences from a factorial design, we find identical content receives markedly different classification values across systems, with variations especially pronounced for specific demographic groups. Analysis across 125 distinct groups reveals these divergences... | Neil Fasching, Yphtach Lelkes |  |

To address this, we introduce a robust, efficient domain-agnostic generative model framework for multi-label text classification. Instead of treating labels as mere atomic symbols, our approach utilizes predefined label descriptions and is trained to generate these descriptions based on the input text. During inference, the generated descriptions are matched to the predefined labels using a finetuned sentence transformer. We integrate this with a dual-objective loss function, combining cross-entropy loss and cosine similarity of the generated sentences with the predefined target descriptions, ensuring both semantic alignment and accuracy. Our proposed model LAGAMC stands out for its parameter efficiency and versatility across diverse datasets, making it well-suited for practical applications.

Conventional statistical tokenizers often disrupt constituent boundaries within words, thereby corrupting semantic information. To address this drawback, we introduce morphological structure guidance to tokenization and propose a deep model to induce character-level structures of words. Specifically, the deep model jointly encodes internal structures and representations of words with a mechanism named MorphOverriding to ensure the indecomposability of morphemes. By training the model with self-supervised objectives, our method is capable of inducing character-level structures that align with morphological rules without annotated training data. Based on the induced structures, our algorithm tokenizes words through vocabulary matching in a top-down manner. Empirical results indicate that the proposed method effectively retains complete morphemes and outperforms widely... | Qingyang Zhu, Xiang Hu, Pengyu Ji, Wei Wu, Kewei Tu |  |

Each CausalLink test case creates a hypothetical environment in which the language models are instructed to apply interventions to entities whose interactions follow predefined causal relations generated from controllable causal graphs. Our evaluation framework isolates causal capabilities from the confounding effects of world knowledge and semantic cues. We evaluate a series of LLMs in a scenario featuring movements of geometric shapes and discover that models start to exhibit reliable reasoning on two or three variables at the 14-billion-parameter scale. However, the performance of state-of-the-art models such as GPT4o degrades below random chance as the number of variables increases. We identify and analyze several key failure modes. | Jinyue Feng, Frank Rudzicz |  |

This work introduces GIST, a large-scale multilingual AI terminology dataset containing 5K terms extracted from top AI conference papers spanning 2000 to 2023. The terms were translated into Arabic, Chinese, French, Japanese, and Russian using a hybrid framework that combines LLMs for extraction with human expertise for translation. The dataset’s quality was benchmarked against existing resources, demonstrating superior translation accuracy through crowdsourced evaluation. GIST was integrated into translation workflows using post-translation refinement methods that required no retraining, where LLM prompting consistently improved BLEU and COMET scores.

Existing efforts for tool utilization typically involve an LLM agent that contains instructions on using the description of the available tools to determine and call the tools required to solve the problem. Inference Scaling techniques, such as chain-of-thought and tree-of-thought reasoning, are commonly used but require significant computational overhead and rendering such methods impractical in real-world applications. In this work, we recognize and formalize the critical role of instructions provided in agent prompts and tool descriptions—collectively referred to as \*context\*—and show that incomplete \*context\* is one of the reasons for this computational overhead.To fill this efficiency gap, we propose an optimization framework that jointly refines both the instructions provided in the agent prompt and tool description, enhancing their interaction.... | Bin Wu, Edgar Meij, Emine Yilmaz |  |

However, as users interact with claims online, they often introduce edits, and it remains unclear whether current embedding models used in retrieval are robust to such edits. To investigate this, we introduce a perturbation framework that generates valid and natural claim variations, enabling us to assess the robustness of a wide-range of sentence embedding models in a multi-stage retrieval pipeline and evaluate the effectiveness of various mitigation approaches. Our evaluation reveals that standard embedding models exhibit notable performance drops on edited claims, while LLM-distilled embedding models offer improved robustness at a higher computational cost. Although a strong reranker helps to reduce the performance drop, it cannot fully compensate for first-stage retrieval gaps.

This is not true for languages such as Hebrew and Arabic, where morphology is encoded in root-template patterns, or Malay and Georgian, where split affixes are common. We present SPLINTER, a pre-processing step which rearranges text into a linear form that better represents such nonconcatenative morphologies, enabling meaningful contiguous segments to be found by the tokenizer. We demonstrate SPLINTER’s merit using both intrinsic measures evaluating token vocabularies in Hebrew, Arabic, and Malay; as well as on downstream tasks using BERT-architecture models trained for Hebrew. | Bar Gazit, Shaltiel Shmidman, Avi Shmidman, Yuval Pinter |  |

For these agents, grounding from language instructions to target elements remains a significant challenge due to reliance on HTML or AXTree inputs. In this paper, we introduce Aria-UI, a large multimodal model specifically designed for GUI grounding. Aria-UI adopts a pure-vision approach, eschewing reliance on auxiliary inputs. To adapt to heterogeneous planning instructions, we propose a scalable data pipeline that synthesizes diverse and high-quality instruction samples for grounding. To handle dynamic contexts in task performing, Aria-UI incorporates textual and text-image interleaved action histories, enabling robust context-aware reasoning for grounding. Aria-UI sets new state-of-the-art results across offline and online agent benchmarks, outperforming both vision-only and AXTree-reliant baselines.

However, there is limited understanding of how or why these methods make such decisions, or why certain content is moderated in the first place. To investigate the hidden mechanisms behind content moderation, we explore multiple directions: 1) training classifiers to reverse-engineer content moderation decisions across countries; 2) explaining content moderation decisions by analyzing Shapley values and LLM-guided explanations. Our primary focus is on content moderation decisions made across countries, using pre-existing corpora sampled from the Twitter Stream Grab. Our experiments reveal interesting patterns in censored posts, both across countries and over time. Through human evaluations of LLM-generated explanations across three LLMs, we assess the effectiveness of using LLMs in... | Neemesh Yadav, Jiarui Liu, Francesco Ortu, Roya Ensafi, Zhijing Jin, Rada Mihalcea |  |

Unilogit addresses the challenge of selectively forgetting specific information while maintaining overall model utility, a critical task in compliance with data privacy regulations like GDPR. Unlike prior methods that rely on static hyperparameters or starting model outputs, Unilogit dynamically adjusts target logits to achieve a uniform probability for the target token, leveraging the current model’s outputs for more accurate self-distillation targets. This approach not only eliminates the need for additional hyperparameters but also enhances the model’s ability to approximate the golden targets. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks and an in-house e-commerce dataset demonstrate Unilogit’s superior performance in balancing forget and retain objectives, outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as NPO and UnDIAL. Our analysis further reveals Unilogit’s robustness... | Stefan Vasilev, Christian Herold, Baohao Liao, Seyyed Hadi Hashemi, Shahram Khadivi, Christof Monz |  |

However, their performance in the domain of art, particularly culturally rich art forms, remains less explored. As a pearl of human wisdom and creativity, art encapsulates complex cultural narratives and symbolism. In this paper, we offer the Pun Rebus Art Dataset, a multimodal dataset for art understanding deeply rooted in traditional Chinese culture. We focus on three primary tasks: identifying salient visual elements, matching elements with their symbolic meanings, and explanations for the conveyed messages. Our evaluation reveals that state-of-the-art VLMs struggle with these tasks, often providing biased and hallucinated explanations and showing limited improvement through in-context learning. By releasing the Pun Rebus Art Dataset, we aim to facilitate the development of VLMs that can better understand and interpret culturally specific content, promoting greater... | Tuo Zhang, Tiantian Feng, Yibin Ni, Mengqin Cao, Ruying Liu, Kiana Avestimehr, Katharine Butler, Yanjun Weng, Mi Zhang, Shrikanth Narayanan, Salman Avestimehr |  |

However, Speculative Decoding entirely relies on the availability of efficient draft models, which are often lacking for many existing language models due to a stringent constraint of vocabulary compatibility. In this work we introduce FastDraft, a novel and efficient approach for pre-training and aligning a draft model to any large language model by incorporating efficient pre-training, followed by fine-tuning over synthetic datasets generated by the target model. We demonstrate FastDraft by training two highly parameter efficient drafts for the popular Phi-3-mini and Llama-3.1-8B models. Using FastDraft, we were able to produce a draft model with approximately 10 billion tokens on a single server with 8 Intel Gaudi 2 accelerators in under 24 hours. Our results show that the draft model achieves impressive results in key metrics of... | Ofir Zafrir, Igor Margulis, Dorin Shteyman, Shira Guskin, Guy Boudoukh |  |

Informed by the nature and linguistics of signed languages, our proposed method focuses on just the most relevant parts in a signing video: the face, hands and body posture of the signer. However, instead of using pose estimation coordinates from off-the-shelf pose tracking models, which have inconsistent performance for hands and faces, we propose to learn the complex handshapes and rich facial expressions of sign languages in a self-supervised fashion. Our approach is based on learning from individual frames (rather than video sequences) and is therefore much more efficient than prior work on sign language pre-training. Compared to a recent model trained on publicly avaiable data that established a new state of the art in sign language translation on the How2Sign dataset, our approach yields similar... | Shester Gueuwou, Xiaodan Du, Greg Shakhnarovich, Karen Livescu |  |

These agents autonomously interact with digital systems via GUIs, emulating human actions such as clicking, typing, and navigating visual elements across diverse platforms. Motivated by the growing interest and fundamental importance of GUI agents, we provide a comprehensive survey that categorizes their benchmarks, evaluation metrics, architectures, and training methods. We propose a unified framework that delineates their perception, reasoning, planning, and acting capabilities. Furthermore, we identify important open challenges and discuss key future directions. Finally, this work serves as a basis for practitioners and researchers to gain an intuitive understanding of current progress, techniques, benchmarks, and critical open problems that remain to be addressed. | Dang Nguyen, Jian Chen, Yu Wang, Gang Wu, Namyong Park, Zhengmian Hu, Hanjia Lyu, Junda Wu, Ryan Aponte, Yu Xia, Xintong Li, Jing Shi, Hongjie Chen, Viet Dac Lai, Zhouhang Xie, Sungchul Kim, Ruiyi Zhang, Tong Yu, Md.

However, to our knowledge, no study has been conducted to assess the ability of language models to validate existing or generated medical text for correctness and consistency. In this paper, we introduce MEDEC (https://github.com/abachaa/MEDEC), the first publicly available benchmark for medical error detection and correction in clinical notes, covering five types of errors (Diagnosis, Management, Treatment, Pharmacotherapy, and Causal Organism). MEDEC consists of 3,848 clinical texts, including 488 clinical notes from three US hospital systems that were not previously seen by any LLM. The dataset has been used in the MEDIQA-CORR 2024 shared task to evaluate seventeen participating systems.

Nonetheless, no publicly available synthetic dataset exists, posing a barrier to studying its role for generalization. To address this issue, we first reproduce and publicly release the synthetic data proposed by Wang et al. (2024) (Mistral-E5). Our synthetic data is high quality and leads to consistent improvements in performance. Next, we critically examine where exactly synthetic data improves model generalization. Our analysis reveals that benefits from synthetic data are sparse and highly localized to individual datasets. Moreover, we observe trade-offs between the performance on different categories and data that benefits one task, degrades performance on another. Our findings highlight the limitations of current synthetic data approaches for building general-purpose embedders and challenge the notion that training on synthetic data... | Jacob Mitchell Springer, Vaibhav Adlakha, Siva Reddy, Aditi Raghunathan, Marius Mosbach |  |

While LLMs have shown promise in argumentative tasks, their tendency to generate lengthy, potentially non-factual responses highlights the need for more controlled and evidence-based approaches. We introduce a reconstructed and manually curated dataset of argument and counter-argument pairs specifically designed to balance argumentative complexity with evaluative feasibility. We also propose a new LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation methodology that shows a stronger correlation with human judgments compared to traditional reference-based metrics. Our experimental results demonstrate that integrating dynamic external knowledge from the web significantly improves the quality of generated counter-arguments, particularly in terms of relatedness, persuasiveness, and factuality. The findings suggest that combining LLMs with real-time external... | Anar Yeginbergen, Maite Oronoz, Rodrigo Agerri |  |

Literature challenges lexical methods because narrative language focuses on immersive sensory details instead of abstractive description or exposition: writers are advised to \*show, don’t tell\*. We propose Retell, a simple, accessible topic modeling approach for literature. Here, we prompt resource-efficient, generative language models (LMs) to \*tell\* what passages \*show\*, thereby translating narratives’ surface forms into higher-level concepts and themes. By running LDA on LMs’ retellings of passages, we can obtain more precise and informative topics than by running LDA alone or by directly asking LMs to list topics. To investigate the potential of our method for cultural analytics, we compare our method’s outputs to expert-guided annotations in a case study on racial/cultural identity in high school English language arts books. | Li Lucy, Camilla Griffiths, Sarah Levine, Jennifer L.

However, identifying the most useful knowledge remains an open question. We introduce BottleHumor, a method inspired by the information bottleneck principle that elicits relevant world knowledge from vision and language models which is iteratively refined for generating an explanation of the humor in an unsupervised manner. Our experiments on three datasets confirm the advantage of our method over a range of baselines. Our method can further be adapted in the future for additional tasks that can benefit from eliciting and conditioning on relevant world knowledge and open new research avenues in this direction. | Eunjeong Hwang, Peter West, Vered Shwartz |  |

The effectiveness of LMs for highly specialized knowledge-intensive tasks in finance remains difficult to assess due to major gaps in the methodologies of existing evaluation frameworks, which have caused an erroneous belief in a far lower bound of LMs’ performance on common Finance NLP (FinNLP) tasks. To demonstrate the potential of LMs for these FinNLP tasks, we present the first holistic benchmarking suite for Financial Language Model Evaluation (FLaME). We are the first research paper to comprehensively study LMs against ‘reasoning-reinforced’ LMs, with an empirical study of 23 foundation LMs over 20 core NLP tasks in finance. We open-source our framework software along with all data and results. | Glenn Matlin, Mika Okamoto, Huzaifa Pardawala, Yang Yang, Sudheer Chava |  |

However, traditional RAG systems face critical limitations, including disrupted contextual integrity due to text chunking, and over-reliance on semantic similarity for retrieval. To address these issues, we propose CausalRAG, a novel framework that incorporates causal graphs into the retrieval process. By constructing and tracing causal relationships, CausalRAG preserves contextual continuity and improves retrieval precision, leading to more accurate and interpretable responses. We evaluate CausalRAG against regular RAG and graph-based RAG approaches, demonstrating its superiority across multiple metrics. Our findings suggest that grounding retrieval in causal reasoning provides a promising approach to knowledge-intensive tasks. | Nengbo Wang, Xiaotian Han, Jagdip Singh, Jing Ma, Vipin Chaudhary |  |

However, implementing this paradigm is challenging due to the resource-intensive process of creating high-quality policy-embedded chain-of-thought (CoT) datasets while ensuring reasoning remains accurate and free from hallucinations or policy conflicts. To tackle this, we propose AIDSAFE: Agentic Iterative Deliberation for Safety Reasoning, a novel data generation recipe that leverages multi-agent deliberation to iteratively expand reasoning on safety policies. A data refiner stage in AIDSAFE ensures high-quality outputs by eliminating repetitive, redundant, and deceptive thoughts. AIDSAFE-generated CoTs provide a strong foundation for supervised fine-tuning (SFT)-based safety training. Additionally, to address the need of preference data in alignment stages, such as DPO... | Tharindu Kumarage, Ninareh Mehrabi, Anil Ramakrishna, Xinyan Zhao, Richard S.

While previous research has improved this notion of calibration for low complexity learning-to-rank models, the larger data demands and parameter count specific to modern neural text rankers produce unique obstacles that hamper the efficacy of methods intended for the learning-to-rank setting.This paper proposes exploiting large language models (LLMs) to provide relevance and uncertainty signals for these neural text rankers to produce scale-calibrated scores through Monte Carlo sampling of natural language explanations (NLEs). Our approach transforms the neural ranking task from ranking textual query-document pairs to ranking corresponding synthesized NLEs.

While instruction-conditioning has become the dominant approach for embedding specialization, its direct application to low-capacity models imposes fundamental representational constraints that limit the performance gains derived from specialization. In this paper, we analyze these limitations and introduce the Mixture of Task Experts (MoTE) transformer block, which leverages task-specialized parameters trained with Task-Aware Contrastive Learning () to enhance the model’s ability to generate specialized embeddings. Empirical results show that MoTE achieves 64% higher performance gains in retrieval datasets (+3.27→ +5.21) and 43% higher performance gains across all datasets (+1.81→ 2.60). Critically, these gains are achieved without altering instructions, training data, inference time, or number of active parameters. | Miguel Romero Calvo, Shuoyang Ding, Corey D.

While large language models (LLMs) have made progress with their vast world knowledge, their limitations in perception, memory, and reliable reasoning still hinder LLM-based agents from achieving human-level performance in long-term tasks. Drawing inspiration from human cognitive-metacognitive collaboration, we propose Metagent-P, integrating the world knowledge of LLMs, the symbolic reasoning capabilities of cognitive architectures, and the self-reflection characteristic of metacognition to construct a “planning-verification-execution-reflection” framework. Metagent-P improves experience utilization through multimodal memory integration. It uses a neural-symbolic hierarchical representation structure to ensure the plan’s reasoning correctness in advance. Finally, it actively adapts the agent to dynamic environments through monitoring, evaluation, and... | Yanfang Zhou, Yuntao Liu, Xiaodong Li, Yongqiang Zhao, Xintong Wang, Jinlong Tian, Zhenyu Li, Xinhai Xu |  |

Query-driven Contrastive Summarization (QCS) is a methodology designed to address this issue by leveraging language-based item descriptions to clarify contrasts between them. However, existing state-of-the-art contrastive summarization methods such as STRUM-LLM fall short of this goal. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Q-STRUM Debate, a novel extension of STRUM-LLM that employs debate-style prompting to generate focused and contrastive summarizations of item aspects relevant to a query. Leveraging modern large language models (LLMs) as powerful tools for generating debates, Q-STRUM Debate provides enhanced contrastive summaries. Experiments across three datasets demonstrate that Q-STRUM Debate yields significant performance improvements over existing methods on key contrastive summarization criteria, thus introducing a novel and... | GeorgeKirollos Saad, Scott Sanner |  |

In this work, we investigate the abilities of such models to perform abstract multilingual reasoning through the lens of linguistic puzzles on extremely low-resource languages. As these translation tasks involve inductive and deductive reasoning from reference instances, we examine whether diverse auxiliary demonstrations can be automatically induced from seed exemplars, through analogical prompting. We employ a two-stage procedure, first generating analogical exemplars with a language model, and then applying them in-context along with provided target language exemplars. Our results on the modeLing dataset show that analogical prompting is effective in eliciting models’ knowledge of language grammar similarities, boosting the performance of GPT-4o by as much as 8.1% and Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct by... | Raghav Ramji, Keshav Ramji |  |

However, the true depth of their competencies and robustness in reasoning tasks remains an open question. To this end, in this paper, we focus on two popular reasoning tasks: arithmetic reasoning and code generation. Particularly, we introduce (i) a general ontology of perturbations for math and coding questions, (ii) a semi-automatic method to apply these perturbations, and (iii) two datasets, GSMore and HumanEval-Core, respectively, of perturbed math and coding problems to probe LLM capabilities in numeric reasoning and coding tasks.Through comprehensive evaluations of both closed-source and open-source LLMs, we show a significant performance drop across all the models against the perturbed questions, suggesting that the current LLMs lack robust problem solving skills and structured reasoning abilities in... | Pengfei Hong, Navonil Majumder, Deepanway Ghosal, Somak Aditya, Rada Mihalcea, Soujanya Poria |  |

Current methods always enhance classical Chinese understanding of pre-trained language models through corpus pre-training or semantic integration. However, they overlook the synergistic relationship between phonetic and glyph features within Chinese characters, which is a critical factor in deciphering characters’ semantics. In this paper, we propose RPGCM, a radical-level phonetics and glyph representation enhanced Chinese model, with powerful fine-grained semantic modeling capabilities. Our model establishes robust contextualized representations through: (1) rules-based radical decomposition and bype pair encoder (BPE) based radical aggregated for structural pattern recognition,... | Junyi Xiang, Maofu Liu |  |

Membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to infer whether a sample is included in a model’s training dataset, can serve as a foundation for broader privacy threats. Existing defenses designed for traditional classification models do not account for the sequential nature of text data. As a result, they either require significant computational resources or fail to effectively mitigate privacy risks in LLMs. In this work, we propose DuoLearn, a lightweight yet effective empirical privacy defense for protecting training data of language models by leveraging token-specific characteristics. By analyzing token dynamics during training, we propose a token selection strategy that categorizes tokens into hard tokens for learning and memorized tokens for unlearning. Subsequently, our training-phase defense optimizes a novel... | Toan Tran, Ruixuan Liu, Li Xiong |  |

In this paper, we challenge this optimism in regards to factuality evaluation.We re-evaluate five state-of-the-art factuality metrics on a collection of 11 datasets for summarization, retrieval-augmented generation, and question answering.We find that these evaluators are inconsistent with each other and often misestimate the factual accuracy of NLG systems, both of which can lead to a variety of pitfalls.We further show that these metrics exhibit biases against highly paraphrased outputs and outputs that draw upon faraway parts of the source documents.We urge users of factuality metrics to proceed with caution and manually validate the reliability of these metrics in their domain of interest. | Ameya Godbole, Robin Jia |  |

An eXhaustive Rubric for Table Evaluation](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.1176/) |  | 0 | Evaluating tables qualitatively and quantitatively poses a significant challenge, as standard metrics often overlook subtle structural and content-level discrepancies. To address this, we propose a rubric-based evaluation framework that integrates multi-level structural descriptors with fine-grained contextual signals, enabling more precise and consistent table comparison. Building on this, we introduce TabXEval, an eXhaustive and eXplainable two-phase evaluation framework. TabXEval first aligns reference and predicted tables structurally via TabAlign, then performs semantic and syntactic comparison using TabCompare, offering interpretable and granular feedback. We evaluate TabXEval on TabXBench, a diverse, multi-domain benchmark featuring realistic table perturbations and human annotations. A sensitivity-specificity analysis further demonstrates the robustness and explainability of TabXEval across varied table tasks.

Current slice discovery methods in computer vision rely on converting input images into sets of attributes and then testing hypotheses about configurations of these pre-computed attributes associated with elevated error patterns. However, such methods face several limitations: 1) they are restricted by the predefined attribute bank; 2) they lack the common sense reasoning and domain-specific knowledge often required for specialized fields radiology; 3) at best, they can only identify biases in image attributes while overlooking those introduced during preprocessing or data preparation. We hypothesize that bias-inducing variables leave traces in the form of language (logs), which can be captured as unstructured text. Thus, we introduce ladder, which leverages the reasoning capabilities and latent domain knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate hypotheses about these... | Shantanu Ghosh, Rayan Syed, Chenyu Wang, Vaibhav Choudhary, Binxu Li, Clare B.

However, traditional LLM fine-tuning approaches face significant challenges: they require large Floating Point(FP) computation, raising privacy concerns when handling sensitive data, and are impractical for resource-constrained edge devices. While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques reduce trainable parameters, their reliance on floating-point arithmetic creates fundamental incompatibilities with edge hardware. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for on-device LLM fine-tuning that eliminates the need for floating-point operations in both inference and training, named GSQ-Tuning. At its core is the Group-Shared Exponents Integer format, which efficiently represents model parameters in integer format using shared exponents among parameter groups. When combined with LoRA-like adapters, this enables fully integer-based fine-tuning that is both memory and compute efficient.

However, these recent efforts do not perform fine-grained evaluations under difficult settings where LLMs might fail. They typically report performance scores over the entire dataset. Through our benchmarking study, we show that LLMs show a significant performance drop for data points with high concentration of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words or with high novelty. Vocabulary adaptation is an intuitive solution to this vocabulary mismatch issue where the LLM vocabulary gets updated with certain expert domain (here, medical) words or subwords. An interesting finding from our study is that Llama-3.1, even with a vocabulary size of around 128K tokens, still faces _over-fragmentation_ issue with medical words. To that end, we show vocabulary adaptation helps improve the LLM summarization performance even in difficult settings.

One revision may contain many edits. Examination of the intentions behind edits provides valuable insights into an editor’s expertise, the dynamics of collaborative writing, and the evolution of a document. Current research on edit intentions lacks a comprehensive edit intention taxonomy (EIT) that spans multiple application domains. As a result, researchers often create new EITs tailored to specific needs, a process that is both time-consuming and costly. To address this gap, we propose UniT, a Unified edit intention Taxonomy that integrates existing EITs encompassing a wide range of edit intentions. We examine the lineage relationship and the construction of 24 EITs. They together have 232 categories across various domains. During the literature survey and integration process, we identify challenges such as one-to-many category matches, incomplete definitions, and varying hierarchical structures.

Clinical interviews for depression detection involve dialogues centered around multiple themes. Existing studies primarily design end-to-end neural network models to capture the hierarchical structure of clinical interview dialogues. However, these methods exhibit defects in modeling the thematic content of clinical interviews: 1) they fail to explicitly capture intra-theme and inter-theme correlation, and 2) they do not allow clinicians to intervene and focus on themes of interest. To address these issues, this paper introduces an interactive depression detection framework, namely Predicting Depression in Screening Interviews from Interactive Multi-Theme Collaboration (PDIMC). PDIMC leverages in-context learning techniques to identify themes in clinical interviews and then models both intra-theme and inter-theme correlation. Additionally, it employs AI-driven feedback to simulate the interests... | Xianbing Zhao, Yiqing Lyu, Di Wang, Buzhou Tang |  |

However, even minor variations in query phrasing, despite preserving the underlying semantic meaning, can significantly affect their performance. To address this, we focus on enhancing LLMs’ awareness of symmetry in query variations and propose syMmetry-ENhanceD (MEND) data augmentation, a data-centric approach that improves the model’s ability to extract useful information from context. Unlike existing methods that emphasize reasoning chain augmentation, our approach improves model robustness at the knowledge extraction stage through query augmentation, enabling more data-efficient training and stronger generalization to Out-of-Distribution (OOD) settings. Extensive experiments on both logical and arithmetic reasoning tasks show that MEND enhances reasoning performance across diverse query variations, providing new insights into improving LLM robustness through structured dataset... | Yihang Yao, Zhepeng Cen, Miao Li, William Han, Yuyou Zhang, Emerson Liu, Zuxin Liu, Chuang Gan, Ding Zhao |  |

However, programming and parallel optimization still require considerable trial and error from Triton developers. Despite advances in large language models (LLMs) for conventional code generation, these models struggle to generate accurate, performance-optimized Triton code, as they lack awareness of its specifications and the complexities of GPU programming. More critically, there is an urgent need for systematic evaluations tailored to Triton. In this work, we introduce TritonBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for Triton operator generation. TritonBench features two evaluation channels: a curated set of 184 real-world operators from GitHub and a collection of operators aligned with PyTorch interfaces. Unlike conventional code benchmarks prioritizing functional correctness, TritonBench also... | Jianling Li, Shangzhan Li, Zhenye Gao, Qi Shi, Yuxuan Li, Zefan Wang, Jiacheng Huang, WangHaojie WangHaojie, Jianrong Wang, Xu Han, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun |  |

To bridge this gap, we propose a hybrid neurosymbolic framework that unifies (1) distillation of implicit contextual knowledge (e.g., sarcasm, cultural references) from Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) and (2) infusion of explicit relational semantics through sub-graphs from Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show the superior performance of our approach, Knowledge-Infused Distilled Vision-Language Model (KID-VLM), over the state-of-the-art baselines across AUC and F1, with improvements of 0.5%, and 10.6%, respectively, in HatefulMemes Benchmark across variants. Further, KID-VLM demonstrates better generalizability and achieves the best performance across all baselines in the HarMeme Dataset with a... | Rahul Garg, Trilok Padhi, Hemang Jain, Ugur Kursuncu, Ponnurangam Kumaraguru |  |

While current models rely on static personality traits, real-world evidence shows personality evolves through environmental feedback. Recent work introduced dynamic personality traits but lacked natural selection processes and direct psychological metrics, failing to accurately capture authentic dynamic personality variations. To address these limitations, we propose an enhanced framework within the Prisoner’s Dilemma, a socially significant scenario. By using game payoffs as environmental feedback, we drive adaptive personality evolution and analyze correlations between personality metrics and behavior. Our framework reveals new behavioral patterns of agents and evaluates personality-behavior relationships, advancing agent-based social simulations and human-AI symbiosis research. | Weiqi Zeng, Bo Wang, Dongming Zhao, Zongfeng Qu, Ruifang He, Yuexian Hou, Qinghua Hu |  |

We present the first on synthetic data augmentation for project level proof oriented programming for both generation and repair. Our method addresses data scarcity by synthesizing basic proof-oriented programming problems for proficiency in that language; incorporating diverse coding data for reasoning capability elicitation and creating new proofs and repair data within existing repositories. This approach enables language models to both synthesize and repair proofs for function- and repository-level code. We show that our fine-tuned 14B parameter model, PoPilot, can exceed the performance of the models that... | Dylan Zhang, Justin Wang, Tianran Sun |  |

Traditionally, ASR models are evaluated using metrics like Word Error Rate (WER) and Character Error Rate (CER), which depend on ground truth labels. As a result of limited labeled data from diverse domains and testing conditions, the true generalization capabilities of these models beyond standard benchmarks remain unclear. Moreover, labeling data is both costly and time-consuming. To address this, we propose a novel label-free approach for approximating ASR performance metrics, eliminating the need for ground truth labels. Our method utilizes multimodal embeddings in a unified space for speech and transcription representations, combined with a high-quality proxy model to compute proxy metrics. These features are used to train a regression model to predict key ASR metrics like Word Error Rate (WER) and... | Abdul Waheed, Hanin Atwany, Rita Singh, Bhiksha Raj |  |

A Causal Perspective](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.1188/) |  | 0 | As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into critical applications, aligning their behavior with human values presents significant challenges. Current methods, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), typically focus on a limited set of coarse-grained values and are resource-intensive. Moreover, the correlations between these values remain implicit, leading to unclear explanations for value-steering outcomes. Our work argues that a latent causal value graph underlies the value dimensions of LLMs and that, despite alignment training, this structure remains significantly different from human value systems. We leverage these causal value graphs to guide two lightweight value-steering methods: role-based prompting and sparse autoencoder (SAE) steering, effectively mitigating unexpected side effects. Furthermore, SAE provides a more fine-grained approach to value steering. Experiments on Gemma-2B-IT and Llama3-8B-IT demonstrate the effectiveness and... | Yipeng Kang, Junqi Wang, Yexin Li, Mengmeng Wang, Wenming Tu, Quansen Wang, Hengli Li, Tingjun Wu, Xue Feng, Fangwei Zhong, Zilong Zheng |  |

Breaking Barriers in Semantic Role Labeling via Large Language Models](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.1189/) |  | 0 | Semantic role labeling (SRL) is a crucial task of natural language processing (NLP). Although generative decoder-based large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various NLP tasks, they still lag behind state-of-the-art encoder-decoder (BERT-like) models in SRL. In this work, we seek to bridge this gap by equipping LLMs for SRL with two mechanisms: (a) retrieval-augmented generation and (b) self-correction. The first mechanism enables LLMs to leverage external linguistic knowledge such as predicate and argument structure descriptions, while the second allows LLMs to identify and correct inconsistent SRL outputs. We conduct extensive experiments on three widely-used benchmarks of SRL (CPB1.0, CoNLL-2009, and CoNLL-2012). Results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both Chinese and English, marking the first successful application of LLMs to surpass encoder-decoder approaches in SRL. | Xinxin Li, Huiyao Chen, Chengjun Liu, Jing Li, Meishan Zhang, Jun Yu, Min Zhang |  |

These models transcend language and domain barriers, yet effectively measuring their performance remains a challenge. Traditional metrics like word error rate (WER) and character error rate (CER) are commonly used to evaluate ASR performance but often fail to reflect transcription quality in critical contexts, particularly when detecting fabricated outputs. This phenomenon, known as hallucination, is especially concerning in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, legal, and aviation, where errors can have severe consequences. In our work, we address this gap by investigating hallucination in ASR models. We examine how factors such as distribution shifts, model size, and model architecture influence the hallucination error rate (HER), a metric we introduce to quantify... | Hanin Atwany, Abdul Waheed, Rita Singh, Monojit Choudhury, Bhiksha Raj |  |

Inspired by cognitive theories, we propose M2PA, an open-world multi-memory planning agent. M2PA innovates by combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with human-like multi-memory systems, aiming to fully leverage the strengths of both while mitigating their respective limitations. By integrating the expansive world knowledge and language processing capabilities of LLMs with the perception and experience accumulation abilities of the human memory system, M2PA exhibits situation awareness, and experience generalization capabilities, as well as the potential for lifelong learning. In experiments, M2PA significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art agents across 50 Minecraft tasks in zero-shot learning.

While these efforts advance AI in mental health, achieving more realistic seeker simulation remains hindered by two key challenges: dynamic evolution and multi-session memory. Seekers’ mental states often fluctuate during counseling, which typically spans multiple sessions. To address this, we propose \*\*AnnaAgent\*\*, an emotional and cognitive dynamic agent system equipped with tertiary memory. AnnaAgent incorporates an emotion modulator and a complaint elicitor trained on real counseling dialogues, enabling dynamic control of the simulator’s configurations. Additionally, its tertiary memory mechanism effectively integrates short-term and long-term memory across sessions.

While knowledge and reasoning are well-explored, the factors enabling generalization to unseen instructions remain underexplored due to challenges in isolating instruction-following dynamics.In this work, we model instruction-following as a computational process and design controlled experiments inspired by the Turing-complete Markov algorithm to disentangle its dynamics. Our findings reveal that the ability to generalize to instructions with unseen semantics emerges only when training data is strategically diversified across rich semantics. This finding gives us the hammer that breaks down the wall separating training instructions from unseen ones encountered in the wild. For specialist models, a balanced mix of in-domain and diverse out-of-domain tasks enhances performance more effectively than simply increasing in-domain data. For generalist models, domain diversification consistently... | Dylan Zhang, Justin Wang, François Charton |  |

While test-time computation methods show promise, they suffer from high latency due to multiple computation rounds.To overcome this, we introduce ThinkCoder, a framework that combines thorough exploration with optimal refinement.The exploration phase diversifies the solution space by searching for potential solutions, followed by a refinement phase that enhances precision.This approach allows us to select the best solution through careful consideration before taking action, avoiding excessive trial and error.To further minimize test-time computation overhead, we introduce preference-driven optimization with Reinforced Self-Training (ReST), which uses exploration trajectories from ThinkCoder to guide LLM’s evolution.This approach enhances LLM’s exploration efficiency via preference learning, cutting costs while maintaining accuracy.ThinkCoder boosts the performance with a single LLM,... | Xiaoqing Zhang, Yuhan Liu, Flood Sung, Xiuying Chen, Shuo Shang, Rui Yan |  |

However, prior methods typically focus on either single-language editing or basic multilingual editing, failing to achieve true cross-linguistic knowledge synchronization. To address this, we present a simple and practical state-of-the-art (SOTA) recipe Cross-Lingual Knowledge Democracy Edit (X-KDE), designed to propagate knowledge from a dominant language to other languages effectively. Our X-KDE comprises two stages: (i) Cross-lingual Edition Instruction Tuning (XE-IT), which fine-tunes the model on a curated parallel dataset to modify in-scope knowledge while preserving unrelated information, and (ii) Target-language Preference Optimization (TL-PO), which applies advanced optimization techniques to ensure consistency across languages, fostering the transfer of updates.

However, long CoT does not inherently guarantee safe outputs, potentially leading to harmful consequences such as the introduction of security vulnerabilities in code or the spread of misinformation. Current research on large language model (LLM) safety usually focuses on short-answer responses, overlooking the long CoT style outputs of LRMs. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic study of LRM safety. First, we investigate safety evaluators calibrated against human annotations. Using our newly developed metrics, we thoroughly assess the safety of 13 state-of-the-art LRMs on StrongReject and WildJailbreak datasets. Our results show that LRMs are not safe compared to their reasoning advance. Further, we perform a fine-grained analysis of the reasoning trace and final answer.

Proficiency in ETR is a significant indicator that a large language model (LLM) truly understands the physical world. Previous question-answering datasets available for evaluating the ETR ability lack a systematic taxonomy and pay limited attention to compound questions. In this paper, we propose a unified taxonomy for event temporal questions and construct a comprehensive benchmark ETRQA, to evaluate the ETR abilities of LLMs based on this taxonomy. ETRQA not only inherits and expands the evaluation content of existing datasets but also contains multiple categories of compound questions. We evaluate two leading LLM series, Llama and Qwen, on ETRQA across various settings. Our experimental results indicate that large-scale LLMs exhibit certain ETR abilities. Yet they do not perform well in solving specific types of reasoning tasks,... | Sigang Luo, Yinan Liu, Dongying Lin, Yingying Zhai, Bin Wang, Xiaochun Yang, Junpeng Liu |  |

This paradox, in which error generation continues despite high-quality training data, calls for a deeper understanding of the underlying LLM mechanisms. To address it, we propose a novel concept: knowledge overshadowing, where model’s dominant knowledge can obscure less prominent knowledge during text generation, causing the model to fabricate inaccurate details. Building on this idea, we introduce a novel framework to quantify factual hallucinations by modeling knowledge overshadowing. Central to our approach is the log-linear law, which predicts that the rate of factual hallucination increases linearly with the logarithmic scale of (1) Knowledge Popularity, (2) Knowledge Length, and (3) Model Size. The law provides a means to preemptively quantify hallucinations, offering foresight into their occurrence even before model training... | Yuji Zhang, Sha Li, Cheng Qian, Jiateng Liu, Pengfei Yu, Chi Han, Yi R.

Prior methods focus on increasing the model size and training data size. However, large models are difficult to optimize efficiently even with distributed parallel training and translation capacity can interfere among languages. To address the challenge, we propose LegoMT2, an efficient training approach with an asymmetric multi-way model architecture for massive multilingual neural machine translation. LegoMT2 shards 435 languages into 8 language-centric groups and attributes one local encoder for each group’s languages and a mix encoder-decoder for all languages. LegoMT2 trains the model through local data parallel and asynchronous distributed updating of parameters. LegoMT2 is 16.2× faster than the distributed training method for M2M-100-12B (which only for 100 languages) while improving the translation performance by an average of 2.2 BLEU on Flores-101, especially performing better for low-resource... | Fei Yuan, Yinquan Lu, Lei Li, Jingjing Xu |  |

To preserve computing resources and accelerate inference speed, it is crucial to prune redundant parameters, especially for experienced users who often need expert models tailored to specific downstream scenarios. However, current pruning methods primarily focus on maintaining models’ general capabilities, either requiring extensive post-training or performing poorly due to coarse-grained pruning. In this work, we design a ̲Custom ̲Pruning method (Cus-Prun) to prune a large general model into a smaller lightweight expert model, which is positioned along the “language”, “domain” and “task” dimensions. By identifying and pruning irrelevant neurons of each dimension, Cus-Prun creates expert models without any post-training.

However, most prior research only focuses on LLM’s capability of textual plan generation. The potential of large-scale models in providing text-image plans remains understudied. Generating high-quality text-image plans faces two main challenges: ensuring consistent alignment between two modalities and keeping coherence among visual steps. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that generates and refines text-image plans step-by-step. At each iteration, our framework (1) drafts the next textual step based on the prediction history; (2) edits the last visual step to obtain the next one; (3) extracts PDDL-like visual information; and (4) refines the draft with the extracted visual information. The textual and visual step produced in stage (4) and (2) will then serve as inputs for the next iteration.

However, previous studies mostly assessed LLM performance on coreference resolution with nouns and third person pronouns. This study evaluates LLM performance on coreference resolution with indexical like I, you, here and tomorrow which come with unique challenges due to their linguistic properties. We present the first study examining how LLMs interpret indexicals in English, releasing the English Indexical Dataset with 1600 multiple-choice questions. We evaluate pioneering LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and DeepSeek V3. Our results reveal that LLMs exhibit an impressive performance with some indexicals (I), while struggling with others (you, here, tomorrow), and that syntactic cues (e.g. quotation) contribute to LLM performance with some indexicals, while they reduce performance with others.

However, the exact notion of salience that LLMs have internalized remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we introduce an explainable framework to systematically derive and investigate information salience in LLMs through their summarization behavior. Using length-controlled summarization as a behavioral probe into the content selection process, and tracing the answerability of Questions Under Discussion throughout, we derive a proxy for how models prioritize information. Our experiments on 13 models across four datasets reveal that LLMs have a nuanced, hierarchical notion of salience, generally consistent across model families and sizes. While models show highly consistent behavior and hence salience patterns, this notion of salience cannot be accessed through introspection, and only weakly correlates with human perceptions of information salience. | Jan Trienes, Jörg Schlötterer, Junyi Jessy Li, Christin Seifert |  |

While prior work has noted this performance gap, the behavioral factors driving the performance gap remain under-explored. This study proposes a comprehensive evaluation framework to quantify the behavior gap between AI agents and human experts, focusing on discrepancies in dialog acts, tool usage, and knowledge utilization. Our findings reveal that this behavior gap is a critical factor negatively impacting the performance of LLM agents. Notably, as task complexity increases, the behavior gap widens (correlation: 0.963), leading to a degradation of agent performance on complex task-oriented dialogs. For the most complex task in our study, even the GPT-4o-based agent exhibits low alignment with human behavior, with low F1 scores for dialog acts (0.464), excessive and often misaligned tool usage... | Avinash Baidya, Kamalika Das, Xiang Gao |  |

Humans solve this problem by also considering the different facets that define a task (e.g., counter-examples, explanations, analogies) and including them in the prompt. However, it is unclear whether existing algorithmic approaches, based on iteratively editing a given prompt or automatically selecting a few in-context examples, can cover the multiple facets required to solve a complex task. In this work, we view prompt optimization as that of learning multiple facets of a task from a set of training examples. We exploit structure in the prompt optimization problem and break down a prompt into loosely coupled semantic sections. The proposed algorithm, UniPrompt, (1) clusters the input space and uses clustered batches so that each batch likely corresponds to a different facet of the task, and... | Gurusha Juneja, Gautam Jajoo, Hua Li, Jian Jiao, Nagarajan Natarajan, Amit Sharma |  |

Existing methods for adapting LLMs to streaming rely either on expensive re-encoding or specialized architectures with limited scalability. This work identifies three key mismatches in adapting batch-oriented LLMs to streaming: (1) input-attention, (2) output-attention, and (3) position-ID mismatches. While it is commonly assumed that the latter two mismatches require frequent re-encoding, our analysis reveals that only the input-attention mismatch significantly impacts performance, indicating re-encoding outputs is largely unnecessary. To better understand this discrepancy with the common assumption,we provide the first comprehensive analysis of the impact of position encoding on LLMs in streaming, showing that preserving relative positions within source and target contexts is more critical than maintaining absolute order. Motivated by the above analysis, we introduce a group position encoding paradigm built on... | Junlong Tong, Jinlan Fu, Zixuan Lin, Yingqi Fan, Anhao Zhao, Hui Su, Xiaoyu Shen |  |

Building on alignment successes in Large Language Models (LLMs), this paper introduces YinYangAlign, a benchmarking framework designed to evaluate and optimize T2I systems across six inherently contradictory objectives. These objectives highlight core trade-offs, such as balancing faithfulness to prompts with artistic freedom and maintaining cultural sensitivity without compromising creativity. Alongside this benchmark, we propose the Contradictory Alignment Optimization (CAO) framework, an extension of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which employs multi-objective optimization techniques to address these competing goals.

However, their large size poses challenges for real-world applications where inference latency is a concern. To tackle this issue, we propose employing Early Exit (EE) strategies in VLMs. However, training exit classifiers in VLMs is challenging, particularly with limited labeled training data. To address this, we introduce FREE, an adversarial training approach within a GAN-based framework. Here, each exit consists of a transformer layer and a classifier. The transformer layer is adversarially trained to produce feature representations similar to the final layer, while a feature classifier serves as the discriminator. Our method focuses on performing input-adaptive inference that increases inference speed with minimal drop in performance.

To address this, we introduce TimeTravel, a benchmark of 10,250 expert-verified samples spanning 266 distinct cultures across 10 major historical regions. Designed for AI-driven analysis of manuscripts, artworks, inscriptions, and archaeological discoveries, TimeTravel provides a structured dataset and robust evaluation framework to assess AI models’ capabilities in classification, interpretation, and historical comprehension. By integrating AI with historical research, TimeTravel fosters AI-powered tools for historians, archaeologists, researchers, and cultural tourists to extract valuable insights while ensuring technology contributes meaningfully to historical discovery and cultural heritage... | Sara Ghaboura, Ketan Pravin More, Ritesh Thawkar, Wafa Al Ghallabi, Omkar Thawakar, Fahad Shahbaz Khan, Hisham Cholakkal, Salman H.

In this work, we demonstrate the existence of “pseudo forgetting”: the performance degradation in previous tasks is not attributed to a loss of capabilities, but rather to the failure of the instructions to activate the appropriate model capabilities. We show that the model’s performance on previous tasks can be restored through two simple interventions: (1) providing partial external correct rationale, and (2) appending semantically meaningless suffixes to the original instructions, to guide the generation of correct rationales. Through empirical analysis of the internal mechanisms governing rationale generation, we reveal that models exhibiting pseudo forgetting show reduced instruction dependence during rationale generation, leading to suboptimal activation of their inherent capabilities. Based on this insight, we propose... | Huashan Sun, Yizhe Yang, Yinghao Li, Jiawei Li, Yang Gao |  |

However, they struggle with Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT), which requires handling both cross-modal and cross-lingual challenges. Previous efforts to enhance DIMT capability through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on the DIMT dataset often result in the forgetting of the model’s existing monolingual abilities, such as OCR. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel fine-tuning paradigm, named Synchronously Self-Reviewing (SSR) its OCR proficiency, inspired by the concept “Bilingual Cognitive Advantage”. Specifically, SSR prompts the model to generate OCR text before producing translation text, which allows the model to leverage its strong monolingual OCR ability while learning to translate text across languages. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the proposed SSR learning helps mitigate catastrophic forgetting, improving the... | Yupu Liang, Yaping Zhang, Zhiyang Zhang, Zhiyuan Chen, Yang Zhao, Lu Xiang, Chengqing Zong, Yu Zhou |  |

Traditional methods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG fail to preserve temporal sequences, handle non-NL for context and entities extraction, and dynamically prioritize query-relevant context. To address these limitations, we propose HG-InsightLog, a novel framework that constructs a multi-entity temporal hypergraph representing log attribute-value pair as nodes and connecting them with hyperedges, capturing critical connections in the data. HG-InsightLog introduces a multi-step query personalization mechanism enhancing the Personalized PageRank algorithm to rank hyperedges based on query relevance and contextual centrality to priortize critical connections. Top ranked hyperedges are extracted... | Supriya Bajpai, Athira Gopal, Chandrakant Harjpal, Niraj Kumar |  |

Dialect-to-standard normalization attempts to tackle this issue by transforming dialectal text so that it can be used by standard-language tools downstream. In this study, we tackle this task by introducing a new normalization method that combines rule-based linguistically informed transformations and large language models (LLMs) with targeted few-shot prompting, without requiring any parallel data. We implement our method for Greek dialects and apply it on a dataset of regional proverbs, evaluating the outputs using human annotators. We then use this dataset to conduct downstream experiments, finding that previous results regarding these proverbs relied solely on superficial linguistic information, including orthographic artifacts, while new observations can still be made through the remaining semantics. | Antonios Dimakis, John Pavlopoulos, Antonios Anastasopoulos |  |

Unfortunately, previous studies on stance and dogmatism in user conversations have focused on training models using datasets annotated at the post level, treating each post as independent and randomly sampling posts from conversation threads. Hence, first, we build a dataset for studying user opinion fluctuations in 764 long multi-user Reddit conversation threads, called USDC. USDC contains annotations for 2 tasks: i) User Stance classification, which involves labeling a user’s stance in a post within a conversation on a five-point scale; ii) User Dogmatism classification, which involves labeling a user’s overall opinion in the conversation on a four-point scale. Besides being time-consuming and costly, manual annotations for USDC are challenging because:... | Mounika Marreddy, Subba Reddy Oota, Venkata Charan Chinni, Manish Gupta, Lucie Flek |  |

These strategies strengthen the learning mechanism of transformer-based large language models (LLMs). Building on prior research, in which inserting dummy tokens consecutively just before reasoning steps can enhance effectiveness, we introduce a novel approach termed Dynamic Inserting Tokens Training (DIT). Our method identifies positions within sequences where model confidence is lowest according to token log-likelihood. Strategically inserting [PAUSE] tokens on these positions bolsters the model’s predictive capabilities for subsequent tokens. Experimental results across diverse datasets and models, from the 2.7B model to the 8B model, demonstrate that DIT consistently outperforms traditional fine-tuning and previous token insertion methods. With this simple yet effective method, we achieve accuracy gains of up to 4.7%p on GSM8K, 3.23%p on AQUA-RAT, and... | Eunki Kim, Sangryul Kim, James Thorne |  |

While LLMs have been benchmarked for their pragmatic understanding, improving their performance remains underexplored. Existing methods rely on annotated labels but overlook the reasoning process humans naturally use to interpret implicit meaning. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel pragmatic dataset ImpliedMeaningPreference that includes explicit reasoning (‘thoughts’) for both correct and incorrect interpretations. Through preference-tuning and supervised fine-tuning, we demonstrate that thought-based learning significantly enhances LLMs’ pragmatic understanding, improving accuracy by 11.12% across model families. We further discuss a transfer-learning study where we evaluate the performance of thought-based training for the other tasks of pragmatics (presupposition, deixis) that are not seen during the training time and observe an improvement of 16.10%... | Settaluri Lakshmi Sravanthi, Kishan Maharaj, Sravani Gunnu, Abhijit Mishra, Pushpak Bhattacharyya |  |

In particular, the synthetic texts generated by LLMs may infringe the IP of the data being used to train the LLMs. To this end, it is imperative to be able to perform source attribution by identifying the data provider who contributed to the generation of a synthetic text by an LLM. In this paper, we show that this problem can be tackled by watermarking, i.e., by enabling an LLM to generate synthetic texts with embedded watermarks that contain information about their source(s). We identify the key properties of such watermarking frameworks (e.g., source attribution accuracy, robustness against adversaries), and propose a source attribution framework that satisfies these key properties due to our algorithmic designs. Our framework enables an LLM to learn an accurate mapping from the... | Xinyang Lu, Jingtan Wang, Zitong Zhao, Zhongxiang Dai, ChuanSheng Foo, SeeKiong Ng, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low |  |

Consequently, they are unable to contextualize the fragment embeddings well enough to be proficient with dense retrieval in domains like e-commerce and finance. Arithmetic inequality constraints (“laptop under 2 lb”) offer additional challenges. In response, we propose DeepQuant, a dense retrieval system built around a dense multi-vector index, but carefully engineered to elicit and exploit quantities and associated comparison intents. A novel component of our relevance score compares two quantities with compatible units, conditioned on a proposed comparison operator. The uncertain extractions of numerals, units and comparators are marginalized in a suitable manner. On two public and one proprietary e-commerce benchmark, DeepQuant is both faster and more accurate than popular PLMs. It also beats several competitive sparse and dense retrieval... | Prayas Agrawal, Nandeesh Kumar, Muthusamy Chelliah, Surender Kumar, Soumen Chakrabarti |  |

However, existing methods often introduce noise in the retrieval and reasoning pipeline, hindering LLMs’ ability to effectively integrate external knowledge for complex multi-hop question answering. To address this, we propose RefKG, a novel framework designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through reflective engagement with knowledge graphs. RefKG autonomously conduct retrieval and reflection on knowledge graphs. It consists of three modules: Query Decoupling, LLM-Driven Knowledge Graph Exploration, and Inference with Knowledge Reconstruction. We also introduce a multi-task tuning strategy that not only integrates external knowledge into LLMs but also trains them to leverage this knowledge for answering questions. This significantly improves their performance on knowledge-intensive tasks.

We test VLM performance across multiple 3D LLM benchmarks and, using this as a reference, propose principles for better assessing genuine 3D understanding. We also advocate explicitly separating 3D abilities from 1D or 2D aspects when evaluating 3D LLMs. | Jiahe Jin, Yanheng He, Mingyan Yang |  |

However, these models often generate outputs misaligned with human values, such as ethical norms and safety constraints, resulting in potentially harmful or inappropriate responses. While several techniques have been proposed to address this problem, they typically involve computationally intensive training procedures or introduce substantial inference-time latency. In this paper, we present DIESEL, a lightweight inference-guidance technique that can be seamlessly integrated into any autoregressive LLM to semantically filter undesirable content during generation. DIESEL guides generation by reranking token candidates according to their semantic similarity to predefined negative concepts in the latent space. It can serve either as a standalone safeguard or as an auxiliary defense... | Ben Ganon, Alon Zolfi, Omer Hofman, Inderjeet Singh, Hisashi Kojima, Yuval Elovici, Asaf Shabtai |  |

Potential challenges arise from their underexposure during pre-training and rigid text-to-structure transfer mechanisms. Unlike humans who seamlessly apply learned patterns across data modalities, LLMs struggle to infer implicit relationships embedded in tabular formats, especially in the absence of explicit structural guidance. To bridge this cognitive gap, we introduce Contrastive Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Experience (CoRE), a framework that builds experience memory representations and enhances generalization through contrastive In-Context Learning (ICL) to simulate human-like knowledge transfer. Experiments on Text-to-SQL and TableQA show CoRE significantly improves performance, achieving average gains of 3.44% and 4.24%, with up to 17.2% on challenging tasks.

In this work, we uncover the surprising phenomenon that the selective pruning of certain attention heads leads to improvements in reasoning performance, particularly on challenging tasks. Motivated by this observation, we propose SPRINT, a novel contrastive learning framework that dynamically selects the optimal head and layer to prune during inference. By aligning question embeddings with head embeddings, our approach identifies those pruned-head configurations that result in more accurate reasoning. Extensive experiments on the MATH dataset demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms traditional best-of-N and random head selection strategies on the MATH500 and GSM8K datasets. | Hieu Trung Nguyen, Bao Nguyen, Viet Anh Nguyen |  |

The key challenges lie in in-depth content generation, appropriate and expressive voice production. This paper proposed PodAgent, a comprehensive framework for creating audio programs. PodAgent 1) generates informative topic-discussion content by designing a Host-Guest-Writer multi-agent collaboration system, 2) builds a voice pool for suitable voice-role matching and 3) utilizes LLM-enhanced speech synthesis method to generate expressive conversational speech. Given the absence of standardized evaluation criteria for podcast-like audio generation, we developed comprehensive assessment guidelines to effectively evaluate the model’s performance. Experimental results demonstrate PodAgent’s effectiveness, significantly surpassing direct GPT-4 generation in topic-discussion dialogue content, achieving an 87.4% voice-matching accuracy, and producing more expressive speech through... | Yujia Xiao, Lei He, Haohan Guo, Fenglong Xie, Tan Lee |  |

However, existing datasets often suffer from three key issues: outdated and insufficient challenging content, neglecting human-like reasoning, and limited reliability due to single-LLM generation.To address these, we introduce STORM-BORN, an ultra-challenging dataset of mathematical derivations sourced from cutting-edge academic papers, which includes dense human-like approximations and heuristic cues.To ensure the reliability and quality, we propose a novel human-in-the-loop, multi-agent data generation framework, integrating reasoning-dense filters, multi-agent collaboration, and human mathematicians’ evaluations. We curated a set of 2,000 synthetic samples and deliberately selected the 100 most difficult problems.Even most advanced models like GPT-o1 solved fewer than 5% of them.

However, current models struggle to perceive detailed and complex instance motions. To address these challenges, we have made improvements from both data and model perspectives. In terms of data, we have meticulously curated iMOVE-IT, the first large-scale instance-motion-aware video instruction-tuning dataset. This dataset is enriched with comprehensive instance motion annotations and spatiotemporal mutual-supervision tasks, providing extensive training for the model’s instance-motion-awareness. Building on this foundation, we introduce iMOVE, an instance-motion-aware video foundation model that utilizes Event-aware Spatiotemporal Efficient Modeling to retain informative instance spatiotemporal motion details while maintaining computational efficiency. It also incorporates Relative Spatiotemporal... | Jiaze Li, Yaya Shi, Zongyang Ma, Haoran Xu, Yandong Bai, Huihui Xiao, Ruiwen Kang, Fan Yang, Tingting Gao, Di Zhang |  |

Another common assumption in cognitive science is that scene context fundamentally shapes our visual perception of objects and conceptual expectations. This paper contributes SceneGram, a dataset of human references to tangram shapes placed in different scene contexts, allowing for systematic analyses of the effect of scene context on conceptualization. Based on this data, we analyze references to tangram shapes generated by multimodal LLMs, showing that these models do not account for the richness and variability of conceptualizations found in human references. | Simeon Junker, Sina Zarrieß |  |

One key finding in psychology is that compared with irrelevant past experiences, recalling relevant ones can help humans better handle new tasks. Coincidentally, the NLP community has also recently found that self-generating relevant examples in the context can help large language models (LLMs) better solve a given problem than hand-crafted prompts. However, it is yet not clear whether relevance is the key factor eliciting such capability, i.e., can LLMs benefit more from self-generated relevant examples than irrelevant ones? In this work, we systematically explore whether LLMs can truly perform analogical reasoning on a diverse set of reasoning tasks. With extensive experiments and analysis, we show that self-generated random examples can surprisingly achieve comparable or even better performance on certain tasks, e.g., 4% performance boost on... | Chengwei Qin, Wenhan Xia, Tan Wang, Fangkai Jiao, Yuchen Hu, Bosheng Ding, Ruirui Chen, Shafiq Joty |  |

Previous works usually combine a range of augmentation strategies with contrastive learning to generate discriminative representations. However, these augmentation strategies could alter the original semantics of time series data, which could degrade the performance of representation learning. To solve this problem, this paper incorporates the large language model (LLM) agent to guide unsupervised time series representation learning and proposes a novel framework named Multi-Agent Collaboration for Time-series Representation Learning (MERIT). The core of our MERIT is to utilize three LLM agents to collaboratively generate positive views for time series data. In particular, we first design a retrieval agent to automatically identify the relevant time series data from a coarse candidate set.... | Shu Zhou, Yunyang Xuan, Yuxuan Ao, Xin Wang, Tao Fan, Hao Wang |  |

We introduce JsonTuning, a structure-to-structure approach that uses JSON structures to represent tasks. This method improves generalization by clarifying task elements and their relations, boosts robustness by minimizing ambiguity, and enhances controllability by allowing precise control over outputs. We conduct an extensive comparative analysis between JsonTuning and TextTuning using various language models and benchmarks. Our findings reveal that JsonTuning consistently surpasses TextTuning in terms of performance, robustness, and controllability across different scenarios. By overcoming the limitations of TextTuning, JsonTuning demonstrates significant potential for developing more effective and reliable LLMs... | Chang Gao, Wenxuan Zhang, Guizhen Chen, Wai Lam |  |

The key distinction lies in how visual tokens are processed. Decoder-only architectures apply self-attention and FFN operations on visual tokens, while cross-attention architectures skip these computations. To investigate whether redundancy exists in this computationally expensive process, we propose a training-free framework for analyzing trained MLLMs. It consists of Probe-Activated Dynamic FFN and Hollow Attention, which enable adjustable reductions in computations for visual tokens, as well as a Layer Ranking Algorithm that prioritizes layers for these reductions. Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial, structured, and clustered redundancy unique to decoder-only MLLMs, offering valuable... | Hongliang Li, Jiaxin Zhang, Wenhui Liao, Dezhi Peng, Kai Ding, Lianwen Jin |  |

However, existing methods often confuse tool utilization with knowledge reasoning, harming readability of model outputs and giving rise to hallucinatory tool invocations, which hinder the advancement of KGQA. To address this issue, we propose Memory-augmented Query Reconstruction for LLM-based Knowledge Graph Reasoning (MemQ) to decouple LLM from tool invocation tasks using LLM-built query memory. By establishing a memory module with explicit descriptions of query statements, the proposed MemQ facilitates the KGQA process with natural language reasoning and memory-augmented query reconstruction. Meanwhile, we design an effective and readable reasoning to enhance the LLM’s reasoning capability in KGQA. Experimental results that MemQ achieves state-of-the-art performance on widely used benchmarks WebQSP and CWQ. | Mufan Xu, Gewen Liang, Kehai Chen, Wei Wang, Xun Zhou, Muyun Yang, Tiejun Zhao, Min Zhang |  |

However, recent literature reveals that due to the conflicts between LLMs’ internal knowledge and the context knowledge of training data, vanilla SFT using the full QA training set is usually suboptimal. In this paper, we first design a query diversification strategy for robust conflict detection and then conduct a series of experiments to analyze the impact of knowledge conflict. We find that 1) training samples with varied conflicts contribute differently, where SFT on the data with large conflicts leads to catastrophic performance drops; 2) compared to directly filtering out the conflict data, appropriately applying the conflict data would be more beneficial. Motivated by this, we propose a simple-yet-effective Knowledge-aware Fine-tuning (namely KaFT) approach to effectively boost LLMs’ performance. The core of KaFT is to adapt the... | Qihuang Zhong, Liang Ding, Xiantao Cai, Juhua Liu, Bo Du, Dacheng Tao |  |

Although the task may not seem challenging for today’s language models, being straightforward for human dyads, we consider it to be a highly relevant probe of the pragmatic capabilities of MLLMs. Our results and analyses indeed suggest that basic pragmatic capabilities, such as context-dependent interpretation of color descriptions, still constitute major challenges for state-of-the-art MLLMs. | Simeon Junker, Manar Ali, Larissa Koch, Sina Zarrieß, Hendrik Buschmeier |  |

Although RLHF has shown promise, the training of reward models (RMs) still faces the challenge of reward hacking, motivating recent works to prevent RMs from finding shortcuts that bypass the intended optimization objectives by identifying simplistic patterns such as response length. Besides the issue of length bias, our work firstly reveals that prompt-template bias learned by RMs can also cause reward hacking when dealing with some marginal samples, resulting in LLMs preferring to generate responses in a specific format after RLHF fine-tuning, regardless of the format requested in the prompt. To this end, we propose a low-cost but effective method, namely Prompt Bias Calibration (PBC), to estimate the prompt-template bias term during reward modeling, which can be... | Chaojie Wang, Haonan Shi, Long Tian, Bo An, Shuicheng Yan |  |

Existing studies primarily focus on improving fusion strategies and modeling modality-to-label dependencies. However, they often overlook the impact of aleatoric uncertainty, which is the inherent noise in the multimodal data and hinders the effectiveness of modality fusion by introducing ambiguity into feature representations.To address this issue and effectively model aleatoric uncertainty, this paper proposes Latent emotional Distribution Decomposition with Uncertainty perception (LDDU) framework from a novel perspective of latent emotional space probabilistic modeling. Specifically, we introduce a contrastive disentangled distribution mechanism within the emotion space to model the multimodal data, allowing for the extraction of semantic features and uncertainty. Furthermore, we design an uncertainty-aware fusion multimodal method that accounts for... | Jingwang Huang, Jiang Zhong, Qin Lei, Gaojinpeng Gaojinpeng, Ymyang Ymyang, Sirui Wang, PeiguangLi PeiguangLi, Kaiwen Wei |  |

A Study on the Financial Bias in LLMs](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.1239/) |  | 0 | Large language models (LLMs) excel in natural language generation but also exhibit biases, particularly in gender, race, and religion, which can be amplified with widespread use. However, research on biases in specific domains, such as finance, remains limited. To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of 23 leading LLMs and found varying degrees of financial bias, including more pronounced biases in financial-specific LLMs (FinLLMs). In response, we propose the Financial Bias Indicators (FBI) framework, which includes components like the Bias Unveiler, Bias Detective, Bias Tracker, and Bias Antidote, designed to identify, detect, analyze, and mitigate financial biases. Our analysis explores the root causes of these biases and introduces a debiasing method based on financial causal knowledge, alongside three other debiasing techniques. For the most biased model, we successfully reduced bias by 68% according to key metrics.

In this paper, we investigate how well such large-scale models, trained on vast quantities of data, represent the semantic feature norms of concrete object concepts, e.g. a ROSE is red, smells sweet, and is a flower. More specifically, we use probing tasks to test which properties of objects these models are aware of. We evaluate image encoders trained on image data alone, as well as multimodally-trained image encoders and language-only models, on predicting an extended denser version of the classic McRae norms and the newer Binder dataset of attribute ratings. We find that multimodal image encoders slightly outperform language-only approaches, and that image-only encoders perform comparably to the language models, even on non-visual attributes that are classified as “encyclopedic” or “function”.

However, real-world scenarios often require fine-tuning these models on private data distributed across multiple devices. Federated Learning (FL) offers an appealing solution by preserving user privacy, as sensitive data remains on local devices during training. Nonetheless, integrating PEFT methods into FL introduces two main challenges: communication overhead and data heterogeneity. In this paper, we introduce FedTT and FedTT+, methods for adapting LLMs by integrating tensorized adapters into client-side models’ encoder/decoder blocks. FedTT is versatile and can be applied to both cross-silo FL and large-scale cross-device FL. FedTT+, an extension of FedTT tailored for cross-silo FL, enhances robustness against data heterogeneity by adaptively freezing portions of tensor factors, further reducing the number of trainable parameters.... | Sajjad Ghiasvand, Yifan Yang, Zhiyu Xue, Mahnoosh Alizadeh, Zheng Zhang, Ramtin Pedarsani |  |

Despite their impressive human-alignment, LLMs are often labeled as "\*just\* next-token predictors” that purportedly fall short of genuine cognition. We argue that these deflationary claims need further justification. Drawing on prominent cognitive and artificial intelligence research, we critically evaluate two forms of “Justaism” that dismiss LLM cognition by labeling LLMs as “just” simplistic entities without specifying or substantiating the critical capacities these models supposedly lack. Our analysis highlights the need for a more measured discussion of LLM cognition, to better inform future research and the development of artificial intelligence. | Zak Hussain, Rui Mata, Dirk U.

Distinct from question-driven over-refusal, this occurs in both retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and natural language processing (NLP) task completion (e.g. summarization, translation) where external content can unexpectedly trigger refusals. In this work, we present a novel two-stage evaluation framework named COVER, designed to quantify and analyze this behavior. Through a comprehensive empirical study on two public corpora, we show that over-refusal rates strongly depend on the task, system prompts, model family, and the number of retrieved documents. We observe that tasks such as translation and summarization yield disproportionately high over-refusal rates, while question-answering remains relatively robust, especially in newer models. Moreover, increasing the number of contextual... | Giovanni Sullutrone, Riccardo Amerigo Vigliermo, Sonia Bergamaschi, Luca Sala |  |

In response, various proposals have been made to automatically discriminate artificially generated from human-written texts, typically framing the problem as a binary classification problem. Early approaches evaluate an input document with a well-chosen detector LLM, assuming that low-perplexity scores reliably signal machine-made content. More recent systems instead consider two LLMs and compare their probability distributions over the document to further discriminate when perplexity alone cannot. However, using a fixed pair of models can induce brittleness in performance. We extend these approaches to the ensembling of several LLMs and derive a new, theoretically grounded approach to combine their respective strengths. Our experiments, using a variety of generator LLMs, suggest that... | Matthieu Dubois, François Yvon, Pablo Piantanida |  |

WhileLarge Language Models have shown promisein zero-shot IE, performance degrades significantly in unseen domains where label definitions differ. This paper introduces GUIDEX,a novel method that automatically definesdomain-specific schemas, infers guidelines,and generates synthetically labeled instances,allowing for better out-of-domain generalization. Fine-tuning Llama 3.1 with GUIDEXsets a new state-of-the-art across seven zeroshot Named Entity Recognition benchmarks.Models trained with GUIDEX gain up to 7 F1points over previous methods without humanlabeled data, and nearly 2 F1 points higherwhen combined with it.

At the same time, we know little about the extent to which these models actually reflect the demographic attributes and behaviors of certain groups or populations, with conflicting findings in empirical research. To shed light on this debate, we review 211 papers on the demographic representativeness of LLMs. We find that while 29% of the studies report positive conclusions on the representativeness of LLMs, 30% of these do not evaluate LLMs across multiple demographic categories or within demographic subcategories. Another 35% and 47% of the papers concluding positively fail to specify these subcategories altogether for gender and race, respectively. Of the articles that do report subcategories, fewer than half include marginalized groups in their study.

To this end, we propose a comprehensive framework for advancing multi-step visual reasoning in large multimodal models (LMMs) through three key contributions. First, we introduce a Visual Reasoning Chain Benchmark, the most comprehensive benchmark for multi-step visual reasoning, covering eight diverse categories and over 4k reasoning steps. This enables rigorous evaluation of LMMs’ ability to reason accurately and interpretably across multiple steps. Second, we propose a fine-grained reasoning metric that evaluates correctness and logical coherence at each step, providing deeper insights beyond traditional accuracy metrics. Third, we introduce LlamaV-o1, a state-of-the-art multimodal reasoning model trained using a multi-step curriculum learning approach. LlamaV-o1 is optimized for... | Omkar Thawakar, Dinura Dissanayake, Ketan Pravin More, Ritesh Thawkar, Ahmed Heakl, Noor Ahsan, Yuhao Li, Mohammed Zumri, Jean Lahoud, Rao Muhammad Anwer, Hisham Cholakkal, Ivan Laptev, Mubarak Shah, Fahad Shahbaz Khan, Salman H.

TempVS consists of three main tests (i.e., event relation inference, sentence ordering and image ordering), each accompanied with a basic grounding test. TempVS requires MLLMs to rely on both visual and linguistic modalities to understand the temporal order of events. We evaluate 38 state-of-the-art MLLMs, demonstrating that models struggle to solve TempVS, with a substantial performance gap compared to human capabilities. We also provide fine-grained insights that suggest promising directions for future research.

Existing approaches, such as Step-DPO, typically improve this by focusing on the first erroneous step in the reasoning chain. However, they overlook all other steps and rely heavily on humans or GPT-4 to identify erroneous steps. To address these issues, we propose Full-Step-DPO, a novel DPO framework tailored for mathematical reasoning. Instead of optimizing only the first erroneous step, it leverages step-wise rewards from the entire reasoning chain. This is achieved by training a self-supervised process reward model, which automatically scores each step, providing rewards while avoiding reliance on external signals. Furthermore, we introduce a novel step-wise DPO loss, which dynamically updates gradients based on these step-wise rewards. This endows stronger reasoning capabilities to language models.

A Dynamic Approach with LLM-based Manipulation Checks](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.1250/) |  | 0 | Emotions have been shown to play a role in argument convincingness, yet this aspect is underexplored in the natural language processing (NLP) community. Unlike prior studies that use static analyses, focus on a single text domain or language, or treat emotion as just one of many factors, we introduce a dynamic framework inspired by manipulation checks commonly used in psychology and social science; leveraging LLM-based manipulation checks, this framework examines the extent to which perceived emotional intensity influences perceived convincingness. Through human evaluation of arguments across different languages, text domains, and topics, we find that in over half of cases, human judgments of convincingness remain unchanged despite variations in perceived emotional intensity; when emotions do have an impact, they more often enhance rather than weaken convincingness.We further analyze whether 11 LLMs behave like humans in the same scenario, finding that while LLMs generally mirror... | Yanran Chen, Steffen Eger |  |

In this paper, we introduce Step COmpression for Process Estimation (SCOPE), a novel compression-based approach that significantly reduces annotation costs. We first translate natural language reasoning steps into code and normalize them through Abstract Syntax Tree, then merge equivalent steps to construct a prefix tree. Unlike simulation-based methods that waste numerous samples on estimation, SCOPE leverages a compression-based prefix tree where each root-to-leaf path serves as a training sample, reducing the complexity from O(NMK) to O(N) We construct a large-scale dataset containing 509K samples with only 5% of the computational resources required by previous methods.

By using constructions as fundamental units, this approach not only accommodates both the idiosyncrasies and the compositional nature of ESFL, but also bridges the gap between literal cues and intended meaning.The feasibility of this constructivist approach is demonstrated using real ESFL data, resulting in a gold-standard, medium-sized syntactico-semantic bank that covers a wide range of ESFL phenomena. | Wenxi Li, Xihao Wang, Weiwei Sun |  |

It delivers essential notifications about abnormal conditions of Aviation System components such as changes to facilities, hazards, service, procedure that are not known far enough in advance to be publicized through other means. NOTAM messages are short, contain acronyms, and look cryptic in most of the cases. Writing and understanding these messages put heavy cognitive load on its end users. In this work, we take up the task of translating NOTAMs into English natural language using LLMs. Since NOTAMs do not adhere to English grammar rules and have their own decoding rules, large language models (LLMs) cannot translate them without effective prompting. In this paper, we develop a framework to come up with effective prompts to achieve the translations. Our approach uses context-aware semantic prompting techniques, paired with domain-specific rules, to improve the accuracy... | Minal Nitin Dani, Aishwarya Maheswaran, Maunendra Sankar Desarkar |  |

User Identity Biases Chatbot Recommendations](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.1254/) |  | 0 | While personalized recommendations are often desired by users, it can be difficult in practice to distinguish cases of bias from cases of personalization: we find that models generate racially stereotypical recommendations regardless of whether the user revealed their identity intentionally through explicit indications or unintentionally through implicit cues. We demonstrate that when people use large language models (LLMs) to generate recommendations, the LLMs produce responses that reflect both what the user wants and who the user is. We argue that chatbots ought to transparently indicate when recommendations are influenced by a user’s revealed identity characteristics, but observe that they currently fail to do so. Our experiments show that even though a user’s revealed identity significantly influences model recommendations (p < 0.001), model responses obfuscate this fact in response to user queries. This bias and lack of transparency occurs consistently across multiple popular... | Anjali Kantharuban, Jeremiah Milbauer, Maarten Sap, Emma Strubell, Graham Neubig |  |

This clinical setting provides a framework to help operationalize narrative discourse analysis and an application-focused evaluation method for narrative understanding systems. In particular, we highlight the use of main concepts (MCs)—a list of statements that capture a story’s gist—for aphasic discourse analysis. We then propose automatically generating MCs from novel stories, which experts can edit manually, thus enabling wider adaptation of current assessment tools. We further develop a prompt ensemble method using large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate MCs for a novel story. We evaluate our method on an existing narrative summarization dataset to establish its intrinsic validity. We further apply it to a set of stories that have been annotated with MCs through extensive... | Ankita Gupta, Marisa Hudspeth, Polly Stokes, Jacquie Kurland, Brendan T. O'Connor |  |

A Survey on Modality Collapse in Vision-Language Models](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.1256/) |  | 0 | Vision-language models (VLMs) integrate textual and visual information, enabling the model to process visual inputs and leverage visual information to generate predictions. Such models are demanding for tasks such as visual question answering, image captioning, and visual grounding. However, some recent work found that VLMs often rely heavily on textual information, ignoring visual information, but are still able to achieve competitive performance in vision-language (VL) tasks. This survey reviews modality collapse analysis work to provide insights into the reason for this unintended behavior. It also reviews probing studies for fine-grained vision-language understanding, presenting current findings on information encoded in VL representations and highlighting potential directions for future research. | Mong Yuan Sim, Wei Emma Zhang, Xiang Dai, Biaoyan Fang |  |

BIStereo: A Benchmark to Measure Body Image Stereotypes in Language Models](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.1257/) |  | 0 | While a few high-quality bias benchmark datasets exist to address stereotypes in Language Models (LMs), a notable lack of focus remains on body image stereotypes. To bridge this gap, we propose BIStereo, a suite to uncover LMs’ biases towards people of certain physical appearance characteristics, namely, skin complexion, body shape, height, attire, and a miscellaneous category including hair texture, eye color, and more. Our dataset comprises 40k sentence pairs designed to assess LMs’ biased preference for certain body types. We further include 60k premise-hypothesis pairs designed to comprehensively assess LMs’ preference for fair skin tone. Additionally, we curate 553 tuples consisting of a body image descriptor, gender, and a stereotypical attribute, validated by a diverse pool of annotators for physical appearance stereotypes.We propose a metric, TriSentBias, that captures the biased preferences of LMs towards a certain body type over others.

Due to the limited context length of tool-using LLMs, adopting information retrieval (IR) models to select useful tools from large toolsets is a critical initial step. However, the performance of IR models in tool retrieval tasks remains underexplored and unclear. Most tool-use benchmarks simplify this step by manually pre-annotating a small set of relevant tools for each task, which is far from the real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose ToolRet, a heterogeneous tool retrieval benchmark comprising 7.6k diverse retrieval tasks, and a corpus of 43k tools, collected from existing datasets. We benchmark six types of models on ToolRet. Surprisingly, even the models with strong performance in conventional IR benchmarks, exhibit poor performance on ToolRet. This low retrieval quality degrades the task pass rate of tool-use LLMs. As a further... | Zhengliang Shi, Yuhan Wang, Lingyong Yan, Pengjie Ren, Shuaiqiang Wang, Dawei Yin, Zhaochun Ren |  |

While most of the efforts in CCA have been focused on elaborate characterization schemata to assign function or intent labels to individual citations, the citation context as the basis for such a classification has received rather limited attention. This relative neglect, however, has led to the prevalence of vague definitions and restrictive assumptions, limiting the citation context in its expressiveness. It is a common practice, for example, to restrict the context to the citing sentence. While this simple context conceptualization might be sufficient to assign intent or function classes, it fails to cover the rich information of scientific discourse. To address this concern, we analyze the context conceptualizations of previous works and, to our knowledge, construct the first comprehensive context definition based on the semantic properties of the citing text.... | Lasse M.

Among knowledge editing approaches, in-context editing (ICE) stands out for its ability to inject knowledge without modifying the model’s parameters. However, existing ICE approaches directly edit model context without isolating target knowledge from the reasoning path of model inference, resulting in unreliable and low-quality outputs, particularly in multi-hop tasks. To investigate this issue, we analyze the interaction between reasoning path planning and knowledge injection, showing that the reasoning ability of a LLM is usually coupled with its original knowledge, and directly replacing old knowledge with new one could simultaneously hurt the LLM’s performance in task reasoning. Based on these findings, we propose DecKER, a novel ICE framework that separates model reasoning from knowledge editing. Extensive experiments show that DecKER... | Changyue Wang, Weihang Su, Qingyao Ai, Yujia Zhou, Yiqun Liu |  |

However, the effectiveness of self-reflection remains insufficiently validated in the context of Small Language Models (SLMs), which exhibit limited semantic capacities. In particular, we demonstrate that the conventional self-reflection paradigm, such as Self-Refine, fails to deliver robust response refinement for models with parameter sizes of 10 billion or smaller, even when compared to generations elicited through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. To improve SLMs’ self-reflection, we redesign Self-Refine and introduce Entrospect (ENTROpy-aware IntroSPECTion), an information-theoretic framework based on prompt engineering.We evaluated Entrospect using accuracy and average time consumption metrics to comprehensively assess its precision and computational efficiency. Experiments conducted across four distinct SLMs and four baseline methods demonstrate that Entrospect achieves state-of-the-art performance on validation... | Tianqiang Yan, Ziqiao Lin, Lin Zhang, Zhenglong Sun, Yuan Gao |  |

We propose the novel task of few-shot transfer for KBQA with unanswerable questions. The state-of-the-art KBQA few-shot transfer model (FuSIC-KBQA) uses an iterative repair strategy that assumes that all questions are answerable. As a remedy, we present FUn-FuSIC – a novel solution for our task that extends FuSIC-KBQA with Feedback for Unanswerability (FUn), which is an iterative repair strategy for answerable as well as unanswerable questions. FUn uses feedback from a suite of strong and weak verifiers, and an adaptation of self-consistency for unanswerability for assessing answerability of questions. Our experiments show that FUn-FuSIC significantly outperforms suitable adaptations of multiple LLM-based and supervised SoTA models on our task, while establishing a new SoTA performance for answerable few-shot transfer as well.

However, this reliance on external sources exposes a security risk; attackers can inject poisoned documents into the knowledge base to steer the generation process toward harmful or misleading outputs. In this paper, we propose Gradient-based Masked Token Probability (GMTP), a novel defense method to detect and filter out adversarially crafted documents. Specifically, GMTP identifies high-impact tokens by examining gradients of the retriever’s similarity function. These key tokens are then masked, and their probabilities are checked via a Masked Language Model (MLM). Since injected tokens typically exhibit markedly low masked-token probabilities, this enables GMTP to easily detect malicious documents and achieve high-precision filtering. Experiments demonstrate that GMTP is able to eliminate over 90% of poisoned content while retaining... | San Kim, Jonghwi Kim, Yejin Jeon, Gary Geunbae Lee |  |

However, sLLMs often struggle to maintain topic consistency in task-oriented dialogue systems, which is critical for scenarios such as service chatbots. Specifically, it is important to ensure that the model denies off-topic or malicious inputs and adheres to its intended functionality so as to prevent potential misuse and uphold reliability. Towards this, existing activation engineering approaches have been proposed to manipulate internal activations during inference. While these methods are effective in certain scenarios, our preliminary experiments reveal their limitations in ensuring topic adherence. Therefore, to address this, we propose a novel approach termed Entropy-scaled Steering vectors for Topic Maintenance (EnSToM). EnSToM dynamically adjusts the steering intensity based on input uncertainty, which allows the model to... | Heejae Suh, Yejin Jeon, Deokhyung Kang, Taehee Park, Yejin Min, Gary Geunbae Lee |  |

However, most recent advancements focus on English, leaving a gap for multilingual support. This paper introduces MultiTEND, the first and largest multilingual benchmark for natural language to NoSQL query generation, covering six languages: English, German, French, Russian, Japanese and Mandarin Chinese.Using MultiTEND, we analyze challenges in translating natural language to NoSQL queries across diverse linguistic structures, including lexical and syntactic differences. Experiments show that performance accuracy in both English and non-English settings remains relatively low, with a 4%-6% gap across scenarios like fine-tuned SLM, zero-shot LLM, and RAG for LLM.To address the aforementioned challenges, we introduce MultiLink, a novel framework that bridges the multilingual input to NoSQL query... | Zhiqian Qin, Yuanfeng Song, Jinwei Lu, Yuanwei Song, Shuaimin Li, Chen Jason Zhang |  |

However, in many scenarios, high-quality CoT data is scarce or even unavailable. In such cases, STaR-like methods can help LLMs synthesize CoT based on user queries and response, but they inevitably suffer from the risk of compounding errors. In this work, we tackle an even more challenging scenario: tool learning in the absence of user queries. We design a data scaling method using back-translation, which establishes an inference cycle to synthesize both user queries and CoT data. To reudce the compounding error of inference time, we introduce two rule-based verifiers to assess the validity of the synthesized CoT data. In particular, the Cycle Verifier facilitates performance improvement by continuously accumulating new data over multiple iterations. Our approach achieves a 75.4% pass rate and a 79.6% win rate using small models (7B) in... | Xiaobo Liang, Wenjin Xie, Juntao Li, Wanfu Wang, Yibin Chen, Kehai Chen, Min Zhang |  |

We introduce an interactive evaluation pipeline to examine how LLMs incorporate different types of feedback in a collaborative setting, in which we obfuscate the input of static coding benchmarks so that the code model must interact with a simulated user. Across 10 models and 3 datasets, the relative rankings of models often permute greatly between static and interactive settings, despite models being fairly robust to feedback that contains errors. We also observe that similarly effective feedback types differ in terms of how models respond to higher- vs. lower-quality feedback. Moreover, feedback type impacts the degree to which the models make aesthetic or behavioral edits to their output. Our work aims to “re-evaluate” model coding capabilities through an interactive lens toward bridging the gap between existing... | Jane Pan, Ryan Shar, Jacob Pfau, Ameet Talwalkar, He He, Valerie Chen |  |

Yet, existing evaluation frameworks rely on traditional metrics for measuring key attributes such as coverage and faithfulness without verifying their applicability, and efforts to develop improved summarizers are still nascent. We address these gaps by (1) identifying reliable metrics for measuring perspective summary quality, and (2) investigating the efficacy of LLM-based methods beyond zero-shot inference. Namely, we build a test set for benchmarking metric reliability using human annotations and show that traditional metrics underperform compared to language model–based metrics, which prove to be strong evaluators. Using these metrics, we show that reranking-based methods yield strong results, and preference tuning with synthetically generated and reranking-labeled data further boosts performance.

Leveraging knowledge graphs (KGs) as external knowledge sources has emerged as a viable solution, but existing methods for LLM-based knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) are often limited by step-by-step decision-making on KGs, restricting the global planning and reasoning capabilities of LLMs, or they require fine-tuning or pre-training on specific KGs. To address these challenges, we propose Knowledge graph Assisted Reasoning Path Aggregation (KARPA), a novel framework that harnesses the global planning abilities of LLMs for efficient and accurate KG reasoning. KARPA operates in three steps: pre-planning relation paths using the LLM’s global planning capabilities, matching semantically relevant paths via an embedding model, and reasoning over these paths to generate answers.

When Large Language Models (LLMs) are used for toxicity detection, two key challenges emerge: 1) the absence of domain-specific toxicity knowledge leads to false negatives; 2) the excessive sensitivity of LLMs to toxic speech results in false positives, limiting freedom of speech. To address these issues, we propose a novel method called \*MetaTox\*, leveraging graph search on a meta-toxic knowledge graph to enhance hatred and toxicity detection. First, we construct a comprehensive meta-toxic knowledge graph by utilizing LLMs to extract toxic information through a three step pipeline. Second, we query the graph via retrieval and ranking processes to supplement accurate, relevant toxicity knowledge. Extensive experiments and case studies across multiple datasets demonstrate that our MetaTox boosts overall toxicity detection performance, particularly in out-of-domain settings.... | Yibo Zhao, Jiapeng Zhu, Can Xu, Yao Liu, Xiang Li |  |

However, pretrained LLMs often fail to capture the behavioral diversity of target populations due to the inherent variability across individuals and groups. To address this, we propose Mixture of Personas (MoP), a probabilistic prompting method that aligns LLM responses with the target population. MoP is a contextual mixture model, where each component is an LM agent characterized by a persona and an exemplar that represents the behaviors of subpopulation. The persona and the exemplar are randomly chosen according to the learned mixing weights to elicit diverse LLM responses during simulation. MoP is flexible, does not require model fine-tuning, and is transferable between base models. Experiments for synthetic data generation show that... | Ngoc Bui, Hieu Trung Nguyen, Shantanu Kumar, Julian Theodore, Weikang Qiu, Viet Anh Nguyen, Rex Ying |  |

Weight-only quantization reduces model size but suffers from performance degradation at lower bit widths. Moreover, standard finetuning is incompatible with quantized models, and alternative methods often fall short of full finetuning. In this paper, we propose ClusComp, a simple yet effective compression paradigm that clusters weight matrices into codebooks and finetunes them block-by-block. ClusComp (1) achieves superior performance in 2-4 bit quantization, (2) pushes compression to 1-bit while outperforming ultra-low-bit methods with minimal finetuning, and (3) enables efficient finetuning, even surpassing existing quantization-based approaches and rivaling full FP16 finetuning. Notably, ClusComp supports compression and finetuning of 70B LLMs on a single A6000-48GB GPU. | Baohao Liao, Christian Herold, Seyyed Hadi Hashemi, Stefan Vasilev, Shahram Khadivi, Christof Monz |  |

To make the process more explainable and grounded, we propose a domain-agnostic modular approach guided by review aspects (e.g., cleanliness for hotel reviews) which separates the tasks of aspect identification, opinion consolidation, and meta-review synthesis to enable greater transparency and ease of inspection. We conduct extensive experiments across datasets representing scientific research, business, and product domains. Results show that our approach generates more grounded summaries compared to strong baseline models, as verified through automated and human evaluations. Additionally, our modular approach, which incorporates reasoning based on review aspects, produces more informative intermediate outputs than other knowledge-agnostic decomposition approaches. Lastly, we provide empirical results to show that these intermediate outputs can support humans in summarizing... | Miao Li, Jey Han Lau, Eduard H. Hovy, Mirella Lapata |  |

While methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and enhance LLM performance by decomposing problems into intermediate steps, they also incur significant overhead in token usage, leading to increased costs. We find that the reasoning process of current LLMs is unnecessarily lengthy and it can be compressed by including a reasonable token budget in the prompt, but the choice of token budget plays a crucial role in the actual compression effectiveness. We then propose a token-budget-aware LLM reasoning framework that dynamically adjusts the number of reasoning tokens based on the reasoning complexity of each problem. Experiments show that our method effectively reduces token costs in CoT reasoning with only a slight performance reduction, offering a practical solution to balance efficiency and accuracy in LLM reasoning.

While various top-k attention mechanisms have been proposed to accelerate LLM inference by exploiting the inherent sparsity of attention, they often struggled to strike a balance between efficiency and accuracy. In this paper, we introduce HATA (Hash-Aware Top-k Attention), a novel approach that systematically integrates low-overhead learning-to-hash techniques into the Top-k attention process. Different from the existing top-k attention methods which are devoted to seeking an absolute estimation of qk score, typically with a great cost, HATA maps queries and keys into binary hash codes, and acquires the relative qk score order with a quite low cost, which is sufficient for realizing top-k attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HATA achieves up to 7.2× speedup... | Ping Gong, Jiawei Yi, Shengnan Wang, Juncheng Zhang, Zewen Jin, Ouxiang Zhou, Ruibo Liu, Guanbin Xu, Youhui Bai, Bowen Ye, Kun Yuan, Tong Yang, Gong Zhang, Renhai Chen, Feng Wu, Cheng Li |  |

For instance, LLMs are expected to selectively provide confidential information to authorized internal users, such as employees or trusted partners, while withholding it from external users, including the general public and unauthorized entities.Therefore, we propose a novel method termed ìn-context knowledge unlearning”, which enables the model to selectively forget information in test-time based on the query context.Our method fine-tunes pre-trained LLMs to enable prompt unlearning of target knowledge within the context, while preserving unrelated information. Experiments on TOFU, AGE and RWKU datasets using Llama2-7B/13B and Mistral-7B models demonstrate that our method achieves up to 95% forget accuracy while retaining 80% of unrelated knowledge, significantly outperforming baselines in both in-domain and out-of-domain... | Shota Takashiro, Takeshi Kojima, Andrew Gambardella, Qi Cao, Yusuke Iwasawa, Yutaka Matsuo |  |

Aside from the well-validated schema linking methods on PLMs and LLMs, we introduce the Linearly Incremental SQL Translator (LIST), a novel algorithmic toolkit designed to leverage the notable reasoning and tool interaction capabilities inherent in LLMs. LIST transforms complex SQL queries into grammatically verifiable sub-queries which are arranged sequentially to reflect single-hop reasoning steps, enhancing both the granularity and accuracy of database interactions. With in-context learning, our experiments demonstrated significant improvements, achieving notable performance of 60.56% and 56.32% on the BIRD dataset with GPT-4o and Llama-3-70B-Instruct. To the best of our knowledge, this achieves SOTA performance among non-schema linking methods, also surpassing a series of schema linking based approaches at a comparable or better cost. | Kaiyuan Guan, Ruoxin Li, Xudong Guo, Zhenning Huang, Xudong Weng, Hehuan Liu, Zheng Wei, Zang Li |  |

We present MAGI, the first framework that transforms the gold-standard Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) into automatic computational workflows through coordinated multi-agent collaboration. MAGI dynamically navigates clinical logic via four specialized agents: 1) an interview tree guided navigation agent adhering to the MINI’s branching structure, 2) an adaptive question agent blending diagnostic probing, explaining, and empathy, 3) a judgment agent validating whether the response from participants meet the node, and 4) a diagnosis Agent generating Psychometric Chain-of- Thought (PsyCoT) traces that explicitly map symptoms to clinical criteria.

Due to computational constraints during both training and inference, we focused on smaller models. To train TituLLMs, we collected a pretraining dataset of approximately ∼ 37 billion tokens. We extended the Llama-3.2 tokenizer to incorporate language- and culture-specific knowledge, which also enables faster training and inference. There was a lack of benchmarking datasets to benchmark LLMs for Bangla. To address this gap, we developed five benchmarking datasets. We benchmarked various LLMs, including TituLLMs, and demonstrated that TituLLMs outperforms its initial multilingual versions. However, this is not always the case, highlighting the complexities of language adaptation. Our work lays the groundwork for adapting existing multilingual open models to other low-resource languages. To facilitate broader adoption and further research, we have made the TituLLMs models... | Shahriar Kabir Nahin, Rabindra Nath Nandi, Sagor Sarker, Quazi Sarwar Muhtaseem, Md.

While vision-language large models (VLLMs) have demonstrated improvements across various tasks, their effectiveness in processing long-context vision inputs remains unclear. This paper introduces WikiMixQA, a benchmark comprising 1,000 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) designed to evaluate cross-modal reasoning over tables and charts extracted from 4,000 Wikipedia pages spanning seven distinct topics. Unlike existing benchmarks, WikiMixQA emphasizes complex reasoning by requiring models to synthesize information from multiple modalities. We evaluate 12 state-of-the-art vision-language models, revealing that while proprietary models achieve ~70% accuracy when provided with direct context, their performance deteriorates significantly when retrieval from long documents is required.

We derive the formulas necessary to enable GFD to operate across mismatched token spaces of different models by calculating likelihood at the byte level, thereby enabling seamless fusion and synchronous progression during the decoding process. GFD is plug-and-play bydesign, making it readily compatible with various auto-regressive models without the need for any re-training. GFD proves effective for general ASR and OCR tasks through intermediate and frequent interactions with LLMs, surpassing cascaded methods in English and Mandarin benchmarks. In addition, GFD transfers in-context learning abilities of LLMs and allows for adaptive ASR in instruction-aware andlong-context settings, yielding significant WER reductions of up to... | ChanJan Hsu, YiChang Chen, FengTing Liao, PeiChen Ho, YuHsiang Wang, PoChun Hsu, Dashan Shiu |  |

However, their efforts are limited to optimizing individual factors of evaluation prompts, such as evaluation criteria or output formats, neglecting the combinatorial impact of multiple factors, which leads to insufficient optimization of the evaluation pipeline. Nevertheless, identifying well-behaved prompting strategies for adjusting multiple factors requires extensive enumeration. To this end, we comprehensively integrate 8 key factors for evaluation prompts and propose a novel automatic prompting strategy optimization method called Heuristic Prompting Strategy Search (HPSS). Inspired by the genetic algorithm, HPSS conducts an iterative search to find well-behaved prompting strategies for LLM evaluators.... | Bosi Wen, Pei Ke, Yufei Sun, Cunxiang Wang, Xiaotao Gu, Jinfeng Zhou, Jie Tang, Hongning Wang, Minlie Huang |  |

It is crucial to know if these systems would be effective and adhere to known standards. We present a counsellor chatbot that focuses on motivating tobacco smokers to quit smoking. It uses a state-of-the-art LLM and a widely applied therapeutic approach called Motivational Interviewing (MI), and was evolved in collaboration with clinician-scientists with expertise in MI. We also describe and validate an automated assessment of both the chatbot’s adherence to MI and client responses. The chatbot was tested on 106 participants, and their confidence that they could succeed in quitting smoking was measured before the conversation and one week later. Participants’ confidence increased by an average of 1.7 on a 0-10 scale. The automated assessment of the chatbot showed adherence to MI standards in 98% of utterances, higher than human counsellors.

The existing research on event coreference resolution is mostly limited to news articles. In this paper, we present the first dataset for the legal domain, LegalCore, which has been annotated with comprehensive event and event coreference information. The legal contract documents we annotated in this dataset are several times longer than news articles, with an average length of around 25k tokens per document. The annotations show that legal documents have dense event mentions and feature both short-distance and super long-distance coreference links between event mentions. We further benchmark mainstream Large Language Models (LLMs) on this dataset for both event detection and event coreference resolution tasks, and find that this dataset poses significant challenges for state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs, which perform significantly worse than a... | Kangda Wei, Xi Shi, Jonathan Tong, Sai Ramana Reddy, Anandhavelu Natarajan, Rajiv Jain, Aparna Garimella, Ruihong Huang |  |

We attribute these errors to \*\*Spurious Beliefs\*\*, defined as propositions the model internally considers as true despite being factually false. To reduce reasoning errors, we propose a belief space rectification framework. Our method first identifies the beliefs invoked during inference via an explanation‐based approach with Forward‐Backward Beam Search (FBBS). We subsequently apply unlearning via gradient ascent to suppress spurious beliefs and enhance true ones, thereby effectively rectifying the model’s belief space. Experiments on three QA datasets and three LLMs show that our method significantly reduces erroneous reasoning and improves generalization. | Ayana Niwa, Masahiro Kaneko, Kentaro Inui |  |

In this paper, we present MemeDetoxNet, a robust framework designed to mitigate toxicity in memes by leveraging fine-tuned pre-trained models. Our approach utilizes the interpretability of CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training) to identify toxic elements within the visual and textual components of memes. Our objective is to automatically assess the immorality of toxic memes and transform them into morally acceptable alternatives by employing large language models (LLMs) to replace offensive text and blurring toxic regions in the image. As a result, we proposed MemeDetoxNet that has three main primitives: (1) detection of toxic memes, (2) localizing and highlighting toxic visual and textual attributes, and (3) manipulating the toxic content to create a morally acceptable alternative. Empirical evaluation on several publicly available meme datasets shows a reduction in... | Gitanjali Kumari, Jitendra Solanki, Asif Ekbal |  |

Detecting Deception in Negotiations using Counterfactual RL](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.1287/) |  | 0 | An increasingly common socio-technical problem is people being taken in by offers that sound “too good to be true”, where persuasion and trust shape decision-making. This paper investigates how AI can help detect these deceptive scenarios. We analyze how humans strategically deceive each other in Diplomacy, a board game that requires both natural language communication and strategic reasoning. This requires extracting logical forms representing proposals—agreements that players suggest during communication—and computing their relative rewards using agents’ value functions. Combined with text-based features, this can improve our deception detection. Our method detects human deception with a high precision when compared to a Large Language Model approach that flags many true messages as deceptive. Future human-AI interaction tools can build on our methods for deception detection by triggering friction to give users a chance of interrogating suspicious proposals. | Wichayaporn Wongkamjan, Yanze Wang, Feng Gu, Denis Peskoff, Jonathan K.

Existing variants for standard Multi-Head Attention (MHA), including SOTA methods like MLA, fail to maintain as strong performance under stringent Key-Value cache (KV cache) constraints. MFA enhances model capacity by efficiently scaling up both the number and dimension of attention heads through low-rank matrix factorization in the Query-Key (QK) circuit. Extending MFA, MFA-KR further reduces memory requirements by repurposing the key cache as value through value projection re-parameterization. MFA’s design enables strong model capacity when working under tight KV cache budget, while MFA-KR is suitable for even harsher KV cache limits with minor performance trade-off. Notably, in our extensive and large-scale experiments, the proposed architecture outperforms MLA and performs comparably to MHA, while reducing KV cache usage by up to 56% and 93.7%, respectively. | Jingcheng Hu, Houyi Li, Yinmin Zhang, Zili Wang, Shuigeng Zhou, Xiangyu Zhang, HeungYeung Shum |  |

However, we posit that typical reasoning traces contain many redundant tokens, incurring extraneous inference costs. Upon examination of the output distribution of current LLMs, we find evidence on their latent ability to reason more concisely, relative to their default behavior. To elicit this capability, we propose simple fine-tuning methods which leverage self-generated concise reasoning paths obtained by best-of-N sampling and few-shot conditioning, in task-specific settings. Our combined method achieves a 30% reduction in output tokens on average, across five model families on GSM8K and MATH, while maintaining average accuracy. By exploiting the fundamental stochasticity and in-context learning capabilities of LLMs, our self-training approach robustly elicits concise reasoning on a wide range of models, including those... | Tergel Munkhbat, Namgyu Ho, Seo Hyun Kim, Yongjin Yang, Yujin Kim, SeYoung Yun |  |

However these methods fell into the trap of local optimum reasoning, which means the model lacks a global perspective while solving problems. We propose a novel reasoning paradigm called Reason from Future(RFF), which generates reasoning paths by bidirectional reasoning that combines top-down planning with bottom-up reasoning accumulation. The essence of RFF lies in its reverse reasoning mechanism, which prioritizes core logical relationships and imposes goal-oriented constraints on intermediate steps, thereby reducing the searching space and mitigating error accumulation inherent in sequential forward reasoning.

This limitation has drawn interest in integrating neuro-symbolic approaches within the Automated Planning (AP) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) communities. However, identifying optimal AP deployment frameworks can be daunting and introduces new challenges. This paper aims to provide a timely survey of the current research with an in-depth analysis, positioning LLMs as tools for formalizing and refining planning specifications to support reliable off-the-shelf AP planners. By systematically reviewing the current state of research, we highlight methodologies, and identify critical challenges and future directions, hoping to contribute to the joint research on NLP and Automated Planning. | Marcus Tantakoun, Christian Muise, Xiaodan Zhu |  |

As mental health care increasingly adopts technologies like chatbots and large language models (LLMs), it is important to thoroughly understand how each session of PST is conducted before attempting to automate it. We developed a comprehensive framework for PST annotation using established PST Core Strategies and a set of novel Facilitative Strategies to analyze a corpus of real-world therapy transcripts to determine which strategies are most prevalent. Using various LLMs and transformer-based models, we found that GPT-4o outperformed all models, achieving the highest accuracy (0.76) in identifying all strategies.

We reframe self-consistency as a dynamic distributional alignment problem, revealing that decoding temperature not only governs sampling randomness but also actively shapes the latent answer distribution. Given that high temperatures require prohibitively large sample sizes to stabilize, while low temperatures risk amplifying biases, we propose a confidence-driven mechanism that dynamically calibrates temperature: sharpening the sampling distribution under uncertainty to align with high-probability modes, and promoting exploration when confidence is high. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks show this approach outperforms fixed-diversity baselines under limited samples, improving both average and best-case performance across varying initial temperatures without additional data or modules. This establishes self-consistency as a synchronization... | Yiwei Li, Ji Zhang, Shaoxiong Feng, Peiwen Yuan, Xinglin Wang, Jiayi Shi, Yueqi Zhang, Chuyi Tan, Boyuan Pan, Yao Hu, Kan Li |  |

However, LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, where carefully crafted prompts manipulate them into producing toxic content. One category of such attacks reformulates the task as an optimization problem, aiming to elicit affirmative responses from the LLM. However, these methods heavily rely on predefined objectionable behaviors, limiting their effectiveness and adaptability to diverse harmful queries. In this study, we first identify why the vanilla target loss is suboptimal and then propose enhancements to the loss objective. We introduce DSN (Don’t Say No) attack, which combines a cosine decay schedule method with refusal suppression to achieve higher success rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSN outperforms baseline attacks and achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates (ASR). DSN also shows strong universality and... | Yukai Zhou, Jian Lou, Zhijie Huang, Zhan Qin, Sibei Yang, Wenjie Wang |  |

The impact of lemma overlap, however, is debated, with recent work reporting accuracy drops from 0% to 30% between seen and unseen test lemmas. In this paper, we introduce a novel splitting algorithm designed to investigate predictors of accuracy on seen and unseen lemmas. We find only an 11% average drop from seen to unseen test lemmas, but show that the number of lemmas in train has a much stronger effect on accuracy on unseen than seen lemmas. We also show that the previously reported 30% drop is inflated due to the introduction of a near-30% drop in the number of training lemmas from the original splits to their novel splits. | Sarah Ruth Brogden Payne, Jordan Kodner |  |

Current instruction tuning primarily relies on teacher models or human intervention to generate and refine the instructions and responses for training, which are costly, non-sustainable, and may lack diversity. In this paper, we introduce Mosaic Instruction Tuning (Mosaic-IT), a human/model-free compositional data synthesis method that can efficiently create rich and diverse augmentations from existing instruction tuning data to enhance the LLMs. Mosaic-IT randomly concatenates multiple instruction data into one and trains the model to produce the corresponding responses with predefined higher-level meta-instructions to strengthen its multi-step instruction-following and format-following skills.

Despite their success, current unified multimodal medical LLMs face limitations in knowledge update costs, comprehensiveness, and flexibility. To address these challenges, we introduce the Modular Multi-Agent Framework for Multi-Modal Medical Diagnosis (MAM). Inspired by our empirical findings highlighting the benefits of role assignment and diagnostic discernment in LLMs, MAM decomposes the medical diagnostic process into specialized roles: a General Practitioner, Specialist Team, Radiologist, Medical Assistant, and Director, each embodied by an LLM-based agent.

Existing agent tuning approaches typically employ supervised finetuning on entire expert trajectories. However, behavior-cloning of full trajectories can introduce expert bias and weaken generalization to states not covered by the expert data. Additionally, critical steps—such as planning, complex reasoning for intermediate subtasks, and strategic decision-making—are essential to success in agent tasks, so learning these steps is the key to improving LLM agents. For more effective and efficient agent tuning, we propose ATLAS that identifies the critical steps in expert trajectories and finetunes LLMs solely on these steps with reduced costs. By steering the training’s focus to a few critical steps, our method mitigates the risk of overfitting entire trajectories and promotes generalization across different environments and tasks. In extensive experiments, an LLM... | Zhixun Chen, Ming Li, Yuxuan Huang, Yali Du, Meng Fang, Tianyi Zhou |  |

In this paper, we argue that sampling algorithms based on the posterior inference can effectively enforce a target constituency structure during generation. Our approach combines sequential Monte Carlo, which estimates the posterior distribution by sampling from a proposal distribution, with a syntactic tagger that ensures that each generated token aligns with the desired syntactic structure. Our experiments with GPT2 and Llama3-8B models show that with an appropriate proposal distribution, we can improve syntactic accuracy, increasing the F1 score from 12.31 (GPT2-large) and 35.33 (Llama3-8B) to about 93 in both cases without compromising the language model’s fluency. These results underscore both the complexity of syntactic control and the effectiveness of sampling algorithms, offering... | Vicky Xefteri, Tim Vieira, Ryan Cotterell, Afra Amini |  |

However, we uncover an interesting phenomenon, which we term the Small Model Learnability Gap: small models (3B parameters) do not consistently benefit from long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning or distillation from larger models. Instead, they perform better when fine-tuned on shorter, simpler reasoning chains that better align with their intrinsic learning capacity. To address this, we propose Mix Distillation, a simple yet effective strategy that balances reasoning complexity by combining long and short CoT examples or reasoning from both larger and smaller models. Our experiments demonstrate that Mix Distillation significantly improves small model reasoning performance compared to training on either data alone. These findings highlight the limitations of direct strong model distillation and underscore the importance of adapting reasoning... | Yuetai Li, Xiang Yue, Zhangchen Xu, Fengqing Jiang, Luyao Niu, Bill Yuchen Lin, Bhaskar Ramasubramanian, Radha Poovendran |  |

However, as base LLM models continue to improve, acquiring meaningful human feedback has become increasingly challenging and costly. In certain domains, base LLM agents may eventually exceed human capabilities, making traditional feedback-driven methods impractical. In this paper, we introduce a novel self-improvement paradigm that empowers LLM agents to autonomously enhance their performance without external human feedback. Our method, Juxtaposed Outcomes for Simulation Harvesting (JOSH), is a self-alignment algorithm that leverages a sparse reward simulation environment to extract ideal behaviors and further train the LLM on its own outputs. We present ToolWOZ, a sparse reward tool-calling simulation environment derived from MultiWOZ. We demonstrate that models trained with... | Barrett Martin Lattimer, Varun Prashant Gangal, Ryan McDonald, Yi Yang |  |

However, an overlooked challenge is AI-polished text, where human-written content undergoes subtle refinements using AI tools. This raises a critical question: should minimally polished text be classified as AI-generated? Such classification can lead to false plagiarism accusations and misleading claims about AI prevalence in online content. In this study, we systematically evaluate \*twelve\* state-of-the-art AI-text detectors using our \*\*AI-Polished-Text Evaluation (APT-Eval)\*\* dataset, which contains 15K samples refined at varying AI-involvement levels. Our findings reveal that detectors frequently flag even minimally polished text as AI-generated, struggle to differentiate between degrees of AI involvement, and exhibit biases against older and smaller models. These limitations highlight the urgent need for more nuanced detection methodologies. | Shoumik Saha, Soheil Feizi |  |

We start from the hypothesis that such divergences can be largely explained by genuine differences in how readers interpret and value literature, rather than by an intrinsic quality of the texts evaluated. Using five public datasets (1,471 stories, 101 annotators including critics, students, and lay readers), we (i) extract 17 reference-less textual features (e.g., coherence, emotional variance, average sentence length...); (ii) model individual reader preferences, deriving feature importance vectors that reflect their textual priorities; and (iii) analyze these vectors in a shared “preference space”. Reader vectors cluster into two profiles: _surface-focused readers_ (mainly non-experts), who prioritize readability and textual richness; and _holistic readers_ (mainly experts), who value... | Guillermo Marco, Julio Gonzalo, Víctor Fresno |  |

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been introduced as detectors for factual inconsistencies in summaries. However, LLM-based methods rely on reasoning capabilities and face challenges in terms of efficiency and explainability. We focus on decoupling LLMs’ information extraction and reasoning capabilities to address prominent challenges, and propose a novel framework, UIEFID (Universal Information Extraction-enhanced Factual Inconsistency Detection). Our idea is to define a self-adaptive structured schema to guide fine-tuned LLMs in extracting unified structured information from documents and summaries, ultimately detecting the origins of inconsistencies in extraction information. The evaluation on 5 open-source models shows that UIEFID not only enhances the detection accuracy on the AGGREFACT benchmark but also significantly reduces redundant reasoning. | Anguo Li, Lei Yu |  |

To this end, we introduce ELI-Why, a benchmark of 13.4K “Why” questions to evaluate the pedagogical capabilities of language models. We then conduct two extensive human studies to assess the utility of language model-generated explanatory answers (explanations) on our benchmark, tailored to three distinct educational grades: elementary, high-school and graduate school. In our first study, human raters assume the role of an “educator” to assess model explanations’ fit to different educational grades. We find that GPT-4-generated explanations match their intended educational background only 50% of the time, compared to 79% for lay human-curated explanations. In our second study, human raters assume the role of a learner to assess if an explanation fits their own informational needs.

Existing calibration methods mitigate bias by leveraging in-domain data, yet such data is often unavailable in real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose SDC (Synthetic Data Calibration), a simple-yet-effective approach that generates synthetic in-domain data from a few in-context demonstrations and utilizes it for calibration. By approximating the benefits of real in-domain data, SDC effectively reduces label bias without requiring access to actual domain-specific inputs. Experimental evaluations on 279 classification and multiple-choice tasks from the Super-NaturalInstructions benchmark. The results show that SDC significantly reduces label bias, achieving an average Bias Score reduction of 57.5%, and outperforming all competitive baselines. Moreover, when combined with Leave-One-Out Calibration... | Xiaoyue Wang, Xin Liu |  |

This enables efficient adaptation to diverse downstream tasks. However, the lack of interpretability in their underlying mechanisms limits the ability to effectively steer LLMs for specific applications. In this work, we investigate the intrinsic mechanisms of LLMs from a cognitive perspective using eye movement measures. Specifically, we analyze the layer-wise correlation between human cognitive indicators and LLM representations. Building on these insights, we propose a heuristic approach for selecting the optimal steering layer to modulate LLM semantics. To this end, we introduce an efficient selective layer intervention based on prominent parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, which conventionally adjust either all layers or only the final layer. Additionally, we present an implicit layer contrastive intervention during inference to steer LLMs away from toxic outputs.

Current end-to-end approaches, whether employing Large Language Models (LLMs) or complex neural network structures, struggle to effectively model the intricate latent relationships between aspects and opinions. Therefore, in this work, we propose Polarity-Aware Sentiment Triplet Extraction with LLM-as-a-judge (PASTEL), a novel pipeline that decomposes the ASTE task into structured subtasks. We employ finetuned LLMs to separately extract the aspect and opinion terms, incorporating a polarity-aware mechanism to enhance opinion extraction. After generating a candidate set through the Cartesian product of the extracted aspect and opinion-sentiment sets, we leverage an LLM-as-a-Judge to validate and prune these candidates. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that PASTEL... | Aaditya Bodke, Avinoor Singh Kohli, Hemant Subhash Pardeshi, Prathamesh Bhosale |  |

Existing methods depend on predefined refusal templates detectable in output tokens or manual review. We introduce \*\*COSMIC\*\* (Cosine Similarity Metrics for Inversion of Concepts), an automated framework for direction selection that optimally identifies steering directions and target layers using cosine similarity, entirely independent of output text. COSMIC achieves steering effectiveness comparable to prior work without any prior knowledge or assumptions of a model’s refusal behavior such as the use of certain refusal tokens. Additionally, COSMIC successfully identifies refusal directions in adversarial scenarios and models with weak safety alignment, demonstrating its robustness across diverse settings. | Vincent Siu, Nicholas Crispino, Zihao Yu, Sam Pan, Zhun Wang, Yang Liu, Dawn Song, Chenguang Wang |  |

However, most existing jailbreak strategies are single-turn with explicit malicious intent, failing to reflect the real-world scenario where interactions can be multi-turn and users can conceal their intents. Recent studies on Theory of Mind (ToM) reveal that LLMs often struggle to infer users’ latent intent in such scenarios. Building on these limitations, we propose a novel jailbreak attack, RED QUEEN ATTACK, which constructs a multi-turn scenario, concealing the malicious intent under the guise of preventing harm. We generate 56k multi-turn concealment data points across 40 scenarios and 14 harmful categories, evaluating four LLM families of different sizes. Results show all models are vulnerable to RED QUEEN ATTACK, reaching 87.6% attack success rate (ASR) on... | Yifan Jiang, Kriti Aggarwal, Tanmay Laud, Kashif Munir, Jay Pujara, Subhabrata Mukherjee |  |

New evaluation benchmarks are of increasing priority as the reasoning capabilities of LLMs are expanding at a rapid pace. In particular, while multi-document (MD) reasoning is an area of extreme relevance given LLM capabilities in handling longer-context inputs, few benchmarks exist to rigorously examine model behavior in this setting. Moreover, the multi-document setting is historically challenging for benchmark creation due to the expensive cost of annotating long inputs. In this work, we introduce MDBench, a new dataset for evaluating LLMs on the task of multi-document reasoning. Notably, MDBench is created through a novel synthetic generation process, allowing us to controllably and efficiently generate challenging document sets and the corresponding question-answer (QA) examples. Our novel technique operates on condensed structured... | Joseph J. Peper, Wenzhao Qiu, Ali Payani, Lu Wang |  |

We propose DiaLLM, the first medical LLM that integrates heterogeneous EHR data into clinically grounded dialogues, enabling clinical test recommendation, result interpretation, and diagnosis prediction to better align with real-world medical practice. To construct clinically grounded dialogues from EHR, we design a Clinical Test Reference (CTR) strategy that maps each clinical code to its corresponding description and classifies test results as “normal” or “abnormal”. Additionally, DiaLLM employs a reinforcement learning framework for evidence acquisition and automated diagnosis. To handle the large action space, we introduce a reject sampling strategy to reduce redundancy and improve exploration... | Weijieying Ren, Tianxiang Zhao, Lei Wang, Tianchun Wang, Vasant G.

While prior work focuses on mitigating hallucinations, we instead explore leveraging hallucination correction as a training objective to improve video-language alignment. We introduce HACA, a self-training framework learning to correct hallucinations in descriptions that do not align with the video content. By identifying and correcting inconsistencies, HACA enhances the model’s ability to align video and textual representations for spatio-temporal reasoning. Our experimental results show consistent gains in video-caption binding and text-to-video retrieval tasks, demonstrating that hallucination correction-inspired tasks serve as an effective strategy for improving vision and language alignment. | Lingjun Zhao, Mingyang Xie, Paola CascanteBonilla, Hal Daumé III, Kwonjoon Lee |  |

We focus on the quality estimator of IMPARA, an existing automatic GEC evaluation method, and construct that of IMPARA-GED using a pre-trained language model with enhanced GED capabilities. Experimental results on SEEDA, a meta-evaluation dataset for automatic GEC evaluation methods, demonstrate that IMPARA-GED achieves the highest correlation with human sentence-level evaluations. | Yusuke Sakai, Takumi Goto, Taro Watanabe |  |

Exploring Psychological Insights to Address Overconfidence in LLMs](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.1316/) |  | 0 | Psychology research has shown that humans are poor at estimating their performance on tasks, tending towards underconfidence on easy tasks and overconfidence on difficult tasks. We examine three LLMs, Llama-3-70B-instruct, Claude-3-Sonnet, and GPT-4o, on a range of QA tasks of varying difficulty, and show that models exhibit subtle differences from human patterns of overconfidence: less sensitive to task difficulty, and when prompted to answer based on different personas—e.g., expert vs layman, or different race, gender, and ages—the models will respond with stereotypically biased confidence estimations even though their underlying answer accuracy remains the same. Based on these observations, we propose Answer-Free Confidence Estimation (AFCE) to improve confidence calibration and LLM interpretability in these settings. AFCE is a self-assessment method that employs two stages of prompting, first eliciting only confidence scores on questions, then asking separately for the answer.... | Chenjun Xu, Bingbing Wen, Bin Han, Robert Wolfe, Lucy Lu Wang, Bill Howe |  |

Although some approaches have started to improve fairness recommendation in offline or static contexts, the issue of unfairness often exacerbates over time, leading to significant problems like the Matthew effect, filter bubbles, and echo chambers. To address these challenges, we proposed a novel framework, Hypergraph Contrastive Multi-Interest Learning for Fair Conversational Recommender System (HyFairCRS), aiming to promote multi-interest diversity fairness in dynamic and interactive Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs). HyFairCRS first captures a wide range of user interests by establishing diverse hypergraphs through contrastive learning.

Nevertheless, such approach leads to inferior performance in various NLP tasks when the model is not certain about testing questions. To this end, we propose a brand new training-free decoding strategy, dubbed as Cautious Next Token Prediction (CNTP). In the decoding process, if the model has comparatively high prediction entropy at a certain step, we sample multiple trials starting from the step independently and stop when encountering any punctuation. Then we select the trial with the lowest perplexity score viewed as the most probable and reliable trial path given the model’s capacity. The trial number is negatively correlated with the prediction confidence, i.e., the less confident the model is, the more trials it should sample.

This challenge is particularly pronounced in tasks involving multi-step processes, such as logical reasoning and multi-hop question answering, where understanding implicit relationships between entities and leveraging multi-hop connections in the given context are crucial. Graphs, as fundamental data structures, explicitly represent pairwise relationships between entities, thereby offering the potential to enhance LLMs’ reasoning capabilities. External graphs have proven effective in supporting LLMs across multiple tasks. However, in many reasoning tasks, no pre-existing graph structure is provided. Can we structure implicit knowledge derived from context into graphs to assist LLMs in reasoning?

However, existing MDS often struggle to (1) identify relevant medical knowledge and (2) generate personalized, medically accurate responses. To address these challenges, we propose MedRef, a novel MDS that incorporates knowledge refining and dynamic prompt adjustment. First, we employ a knowledge refining mechanism to filter out irrelevant medical data, improving predictions of critical medical entities in responses. Additionally, we design a comprehensive prompt structure that incorporates historical details and evident details. To enable real-time adaptability to diverse patient conditions, we implement two key modules, Triplet Filter and Demo Selector, providing appropriate knowledge and demonstrations equipped in the system prompt.Extensive experiments on MedDG and KaMed benchmarks show that MedRef outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in... | Hongda Sun, Jiaren Peng, Wenzhong Yang, Liang He, Bo Du, Rui Yan |  |

Despite numerous efforts, no single algorithm performs consistently well across different types of unseen text or guarantees effective generalization to new LLMs. Interpretability plays a crucial role in achieving this goal. In this study, we enhance ATD interpretability by using Sparse Autoencoders (SAE) to extract features from Gemma-2-2B’s residual stream. We identify both interpretable and efficient features, analyzing their semantics and relevance through domain- and model-specific statistics, a steering approach, and manual or LLM-based interpretation of obtained features. Our methods offer valuable insights into how texts from various models differ from human-written content. We show that modern LLMs have a distinct writing style, especially in information-dense domains, even though they can produce human-like outputs with personalized prompts.

Due to lack of gold-labeled data, techniques that create synthetic training data have become popular. We show that models trained on synthetic data tend tocorrect a limited range of grammar and spelling mistakes that involve character-level changes, but perform poorly on (more complex) phenomena that require word-level changes. We propose to address the performance gap on such errors by generating synthetic data through selective data augmentation via round-trip machine translation. We show that the proposed technique, SeLex-RT, is capable of generating mistakes that are similar to those observed with language learners. Using the approach with two types of state-of-the-art learning frameworks and two low-resource languages (Russian and Ukrainian), we achieve substantial improvements, compared to training on synthetic data produced with standard techniques.

Investigating LLM-Assisted Annotation for Subjective Tasks](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.1323/) |  | 0 | LLM use in annotation is becoming widespread, and given LLMs’ overall promising performance and speed, putting humans in the loop to simply “review” LLM annotations can be tempting. In subjective tasks with multiple plausible answers, this can impact both evaluation of LLM performance, and analysis using these labels in a social science task downstream. In a pre-registered experiment with 350 unique annotators and 7,000 annotations across 4 conditions, 2 models, and 2 datasets, we find that presenting crowdworkers with LLM-generated annotation suggestions did not make them faster annotators, but did improve their self-reported confidence in the task. More importantly, annotators strongly took the LLM suggestions, significantly changing the label distribution compared to the baseline. We show that when these labels created with LLM assistance are used to evaluate LLM performance, reported model performance significantly increases. We show how changes in label distributions as a result... | Hope Schroeder, Deb Roy, Jad Kabbara |  |

To that end, we present the results of a survey on the notion of ”intelligence” among researchers and its role in the research agenda. The survey elicited complete responses from 303 researchers from a variety of fields including NLP, Machine Learning (ML), Cognitive Science, Linguistics, and Neuroscience.We identify 3 criteria of intelligence that the community agrees on the most: generalization, adaptability, & reasoning.Our results suggests that the perception of the current NLP systems as ”intelligent” is a minority position (29%).Furthermore, only 16.2% of the respondents see developing intelligent systems as a research goal, and these respondents are more likely to consider the current systems intelligent. | Bertram Højer, Terne Sasha Thorn Jakobsen, Anna Rogers, Stefan Heinrich |  |

LEMONADE is based on a partially reannotated subset of the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED), which has documented global conflict events for over a decade.To address the challenge of aggregating multilingual sources for global event analysis, we introduce abstractive event extraction (AEE) and its subtask, abstractive entity linking (AEL). Unlike conventional span-based event extraction, our approach detects event arguments and entities through holistic document understanding and normalizes them across the multilingual dataset. We evaluate various large language models (LLMs) on these tasks, adapt existing zero-shot event extraction systems, and benchmark supervised models.

Existing methodologies and benchmarks primarily target entity substitutions, failing to capture the full breadth of complex real-world dynamics. In this paper, we introduce Knowledge Update Playground (KUP), an automatic pipeline for simulating realistic knowledge updates reflected in an evidence corpus. KUP’s evaluation framework includes direct and indirect probes to both test memorization of updated facts and reasoning over them, for any update learning methods. Next, we present a lightweight method called memory conditioned training (MCT), which conditions tokens in the update corpus on self-generated ”memory” tokens during training. Our strategy encourages LLMs to surface and reason over newly memorized knowledge at inference.

Existing automatic evaluation metrics like ROUGE and BLEU often show low correlation with human judgments. As large language models (LLMs) continue to evolve, researchers have explored their use as alternatives to human evaluators. Although single-agent approaches have shown potential, results indicate that further progress is required to close the gap between their performance and the quality of human assessments. Acknowledging that human evaluations involve multiple annotators, the multi-agent approach allows LLMs to collaborate, enhancing efficiency and effectiveness in handling complex tasks. In this paper, we present CourtEval, a novel Multi-Agent Evaluation Framework modeled after courtroom dynamics.

We use monolingual dictionary data for four new languages (Spanish, French, Portuguese, and German) and perform an in-depth empirical study to test the performance of pre-trained multilingual language models on definition modeling of monosemic words when finetuned on this data. Furthermore, we use a zero-shot approach to test the multilingual capabilities of two popular chat-based Large Language Models (LLMs) in the task. Results show that multilingual language models can perform on-pair with English but cannot leverage potential cross-lingual synergies, with LLMs generally offering better performance overall.

This study explores how bias shapes the perception of AI versus human generated content. Through three experiments involving text rephrasing, news article summarization, and persuasive writing, we investigated how human raters respond to labeled and unlabeled content. While the raters could not differentiate the two types of texts in the blind test, they overwhelmingly favored content labeled as “Human Generated,” over those labeled “AI Generated,” by a preference score of over 30%. We observed the same pattern even when the labels were deliberately swapped. This human bias against AI has broader societal and cognitive implications, as it undervalues AI performance. This study highlights the limitations of human judgment in interacting with AI and offers a foundation for improving human-AI collaboration, especially in creative fields. | Tiffany Zhu, Iain Weissburg, Kexun Zhang, William Yang Wang |  |

However, their resulting embeddings often have thousands of dimensions, leading to high storage costs and increased computational costs of embedding-based operations. In this paper, we investigate how post-hoc dimensionality reduction applied to the embeddings affects the performance of various tasks that leverage these embeddings, specifically classification, clustering, retrieval, and semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks. Our experiments show that even a naive dimensionality reduction, which keeps only the first 25% of the dimensions of the embeddings, results in a very slight performance degradation, indicating that these embeddings are highly redundant. Notably, for classification and clustering, even when embeddings are reduced to less than 0.5% of the original dimensionality the performance degradation is very small.... | Hayato Tsukagoshi, Ryohei Sasano |  |

We fine-tune OpenAI Whisper large-v2, a state-of-the-art speech recognition model, to recognize phrasal, lexical, and contrastive stress using a small, carefully annotated dataset. Our results show that Whisper can learn distinct, gender-specific stress patterns to achieve near-human and super-human accuracy in stress classification and transfer its learning from one type of stress to another, surpassing traditional machine learning models. Furthermore, we explore how acoustic context influences its performance and propose a novel black-box evaluation method for characterizing the decision boundaries used by Whisper for prosodic stress interpretation. These findings open new avenues for large-scale, automated prosody research. Models can be found at github.com/SSSohn/ProsodyBench. | Samuel S. Sohn, Sten Knutsen, Karin Stromswold |  |

Modeling Clients' Metacognition and Openness for LLM Therapist Evaluation](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.1332/) |  | 0 | Understanding clients’ thoughts and beliefs is fundamental in counseling, yet current evaluations of LLM therapists often fail to assess this ability. Existing evaluation methods rely on client simulators that clearly disclose internal states to the therapist, making it difficult to determine whether an LLM therapist can uncover unexpressed perspectives. To address this limitation, we introduce MindVoyager, a novel evaluation framework featuring a controllable and realistic client simulator which dynamically adapts itself based on the ongoing counseling session, offering a more realistic and challenging evaluation environment. We further introduce evaluation metrics that assess the exploration ability of LLM therapists by measuring their thorough understanding of client’s beliefs and thoughts. | Minju Kim, Dongje Yoo, Yeonjun Hwang, Minseok Kang, Namyoung Kim, Minju Gwak, Beongwoo Kwak, Hyungjoo Chae, Harim Kim, Yunjoong Lee, Min Hee Kim, Dayi Jung, KyongMee Chung, Jinyoung Yeo |  |

Detecting Out-of-Distribution Corpora Using GradNormIR](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.1334/) |  | 0 | Dense retrievers encode texts into embeddings to efficiently retrieve relevant documents from large databases in response to user queries. However, real-world corpora continually evolve, leading to a shift from the original training distribution of the retriever. Without timely updates or retraining, indexing newly emerging documents can degrade retrieval performance for future queries. Thus, identifying when a dense retriever requires an update is critical for maintaining robust retrieval systems. In this paper, we propose a novel task of predicting whether a corpus is out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to a dense retriever before indexing. Addressing this task allows us to proactively manage retriever updates, preventing potential retrieval failures. We introduce GradNormIR, an unsupervised approach that leverages gradient norms to detect OOD corpora effectively. Experiments on the BEIR benchmark demonstrate that GradNormIR enables timely updates of dense retrievers in evolving... | Dayoon Ko, Jinyoung Kim, Sohyeon Kim, Jinhyuk Kim, Jaehoon Lee, Seonghak Song, Minyoung Lee, Gunhee Kim |  |

However, datasets for training and evaluating AV models are primarily in English and primarily in a single domain. This precludes analysis of AV techniques for generalizability and can cause seemingly valid AV solutions to, in fact, rely on topic-based features rather than actual authorship features. To address this limitation, we introduce the Million Authors Corpus (), a novel dataset encompassing contributions from dozens of languages on Wikipedia. It includes only long and contiguous textual chunks taken from Wikipedia edits and links those texts to their authors. includes 60.08M textual chunks, contributed by 1.29M Wikipedia authors. It enables broad-scale cross-lingual and cross-domain AV evaluation to ensure accurate analysis of model capabilities that are not overly optimistic.

However, they still face significant challenges in certain scenarios, particularly when translating low-resource languages. A common approach to address this issue is to provide external knowledge, such as few-shot examples, to assist LLMs in translating specific source sentences. However, this method is fundamentally limited by the quality or quantity of relevant sources, which cannot always be guaranteed. To reduce LLMs’ reliance on external sources, we propose BridG MT, a method that combines Sentence Bridging, which generates a sequence of sentences as a bridge that gradually transition from easy-to-translate to more difficult, and Gradual MT, which sequentially translates these sentences using earlier translations as few-shot examples for subsequent ones. Experiments conducted on four LLMs across seven languages demonstrate that... | Seungwoo Choi, Gahyun Yoo, JayYoon Lee |  |

Although LLMs have been extensively explored in the context of world modeling, prior studies encountered several challenges, including evaluation randomness, dependence on indirect metrics, and a limited domain scope. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel benchmark, Text2World, based on planning domain definition language (PDDL), featuring hundreds of diverse domains and employing multi-criteria, execution-based metrics for a more robust evaluation. We benchmark current LLMs using Text2World and find that reasoning models trained with large-scale reinforcement learning outperform others. However, even the best-performing model still demonstrates limited capabilities in world modeling. Building on these insights, we examine several promising strategies to enhance the world modeling capabilities of LLMs, including test-time... | Mengkang Hu, Tianxing Chen, Yude Zou, Yuheng Lei, Qiguang Chen, Ming Li, Yao Mu, Hongyuan Zhang, Wenqi Shao, Ping Luo |  |

Through experiments with hypothetical job applications, we examined how these models’ evaluations are influenced by non-job-related information, including extracurricular activities and social media images. By analyzing models’ responses to Likert-scale questions across different competency dimensions, we found that AI models exhibit significant halo effects, particularly in image-based evaluations, while text-based assessments showed more resistance to bias. The findings demonstrate that supplementary multimodal information can substantially influence AI hiring decisions, highlighting potential risks in AI-based recruitment systems. | Kyusik Kim, Jeongwoo Ryu, Hyeonseok Jeon, Bongwon Suh |  |

This limitation makes it challenging to detect misinformation and ensure reliable decision-making. Existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for LLMs are primarily prompt-wise rather than response-wise, often requiring multiple response samples, which leads to inefficiency. Moreover, LLMs have been shown to be overconfident, particularly when using reasoning steps to derive their answers. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to quantify response-wise uncertainty by integrating LLMs’ inherent reasoning capabilities through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) into the UQ process. Our CoT-UQ framework captures critical information during inference by extracting keywords from each reasoning step and assessing their importance to the final answer. The uncertainty scores of keywords are then aggregated based on their significance to produce a final uncertainty... | Boxuan Zhang, Ruqi Zhang |  |

While previous research has primarily focused on refining instruction components and augmenting input data with in-context examples, our work investigates the potential benefits of optimizing the input data itself. We introduce a two-pronged strategy for input data optimization: content engineering and structural reformulation. Content engineering involves imputing missing values, removing irrelevant attributes, and enriching profiles by generating additional information inferred from existing attributes. Subsequent to content engineering, structural reformulation is applied to optimize the presentation of the modified content to LLMs, given their sensitivity to input format. Our findings suggest that these optimizations can significantly improve the performance of LLMs in various tasks, offering a promising avenue for future research... | Sam Lin, Wenyue Hua, Lingyao Li, Zhenting Wang, Yongfeng Zhang |  |

To address this gap, we introduce the Long Text Fairness Test (LTF-TEST), a framework that evaluates biases in LLMs through essay-style prompts. LTF-TEST covers 14 topics and 10 demographic axes, including gender and race, resulting in 11,948 samples. By assessing both model responses and the reasoning behind them, LTF-TEST uncovers subtle biases that are difficult to detect in simple responses. In our evaluation of five recent LLMs, including GPT-4o and LLaMA3, we identify two key patterns of bias. First, these models frequently favor certain demographic groups in their responses. Second, they show excessive sensitivity toward traditionally disadvantaged groups, often providing overly protective responses while neglecting others. To mitigate these biases, we propose... | Wonje Jeung, Dongjae Jeon, Ashkan Yousefpour, Jonghyun Choi |  |

Drawing on comparative psychology and cognitive science, we propose a two-stage framework that assesses \*\*perception\*\* (visual, spatial, temporal, quantitative, and motion) and \*\*prediction\*\* (mechanistic simulation, transitive inference, compositional inference) to provide an atomic evaluation of VLMs as WMs. Guided by this framework, we introduce \*\*WM-ABench\*\*, a large-scale benchmark comprising 23 fine-grained evaluation dimensions across 6 diverse simulated environments with controlled counterfactual simulations.... | Qiyue Gao, Xinyu Pi, Kevin Liu, Junrong Chen, Ruolan Yang, Xinqi Huang, Xinyu Fang, Lu Sun, Gautham Kishore, Bo Ai, Stone Tao, Mengyang Liu, Jiaxi Yang, ChaoJung Lai, Chuanyang Jin, Jiannan Xiang, Benhao Huang, Zeming Chen, David Danks, Hao Su, Tianmin Shu, Ziqiao Ma, Lianhui Qin, Zhiting Hu |  |

The moment users share information with these agents —such as large language models (LLMs)— their private information becomes vulnerable to exposure. In this paper, we characterize the notion of contextual privacy for user interactions with LLM-based Conversational Agents (LCAs). It aims to minimize privacy risks by ensuring that users (sender) disclose only information that is both relevant and necessary for achieving their intended goals when interacting with LCAs (untrusted receivers). Through a formative design user study, we observe how even “privacy-conscious” users inadvertently reveal sensitive information through indirect disclosures. Based on insights from this study, we propose a locally deployable framework that operates between users and LCAs, identifying and reformulating out-of-context information in user prompts.

However, their lack of emotion and fine-grained role awareness limits the model’s ability to provide personalized and diverse interactions further. Current methods face high costs in collecting high-quality annotated data for scenarios such as role-playing, and traditional human alignment methods are difficult to deploy due to the inherent diversity of model behavior in role-playing scenarios. Inspired by the alignment of models for safety behaviors through RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback), in this paper, we revisit model role-playing behavior from the perspective of persona alignment and propose a novel annotation-free framework named Persona-Aware Contrastive Learning (PCL) to align LLMs’ behavior during role-playing, enhancing the model’s role consistency. Specifically, we first design a role chain method to encourage the model to self-question based... | Ke Ji, Yixin Lian, Linxu Li, Jingsheng Gao, Weiyuan Li, Bin Dai |  |

However, such structured data is often communicated to humans in visually interpretable formats (e.g. charts and textual paragraphs), making it imperative that fact-checking models should be able to reason over multiple pieces of structured evidence presented across different modalities. In this paper, we propose Multi-Document Multi-Modal Table-based Fact Verification (M2-TabFact), a challenging fact verification task that requires jointly reasoning over visual and textual representations of structured data. We design an automatic data generation pipeline that converts existing tabular data into descriptive visual and textual evidence. We then use Large Language Models to generate complex claims that depend on multi-document, multi-modal evidence. In total, we create 8,856 pairs of complex claims and multi-modal evidence through this procedure and systematically evaluate... | Mingyang Zhou, Lingyu Zhang, Sophia Horng, Maximillian Chen, KungHsiang Huang, ShihFu Chang |  |

While it maintains the target model’s generation quality, this strict equivalence limits the speedup achievable by SD and prevents users from trading deviations from the target distribution in exchange for further inference speed gains. To address these limitations, we introduce Fuzzy Speculative Decoding (FSD) - a decoding algorithm that generalizes SD by accepting candidate tokens based on the divergences between the target and draft model distributions. By allowing for controlled divergence from the target model, FSD enables users to flexibly trade generation quality for inference speed. Across several benchmarks, our method is able to achieve significant runtime improvements of over 5 tokens per second faster than SD at only an approximate 2% absolute reduction in benchmark accuracy. In many cases, FSD is even able to match SD benchmark accuracy at over 2... | Maximilian Holsman, Yukun Huang, Bhuwan Dhingra |  |

Existing solutions rely on manual rewriting or labeled data for validation, making them inapplicable in true zero-shot settings. To address these challenges, we propose PLAY2PROMPT, an automated framework that systematically “plays” with each tool to explore its input-output behaviors. Through this iterative trial-and-error process, PLAY2PROMPT refines tool documentation and generates usage examples without any labeled data. These examples not only guide LLM inference but also serve as validation to further enhance tool utilization. Extensive experiments on real-world tasks demonstrate that PLAY2PROMPT significantly improves zero-shot tool performance across both open and closed models, offering a scalable and effective solution for domain-specific tool integration. | Wei Fang, Yang Zhang, Kaizhi Qian, James R.

With the growing popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs), there have been efforts to create LLM-based conversational tutors which can expand the benefits of one-to-one tutoring to everyone. However, current LLMs are trained primarily to be helpful assistants and lack crucial pedagogical skills. For example, they often quickly reveal the solution to the student and fail to plan for a richer multi-turn pedagogical interaction.To use LLMs in pedagogical settings, they need to be steered to use effective teaching strategies: a problem we introduce as Pedagogical Steering. We develop StratL, an algorithm to optimize LLM prompts and steer it to follow a predefined multi-turn tutoring plan represented as a transition graph.As a case study, we create a prototype tutor for high school math following Productive Failure (PF), an advanced and effective learning design.

However, LLMs often exhibit Out-of-Character (OOC) behavior, where generated responses deviate from an assigned persona, leading to inconsistencies that affect model reliability. Existing evaluation methods typically assign single scores to entire responses, struggling to capture subtle persona misalignment, particularly in long-form text generation. To address this limitation, we propose an atomic-level evaluation framework that quantifies persona fidelity at a finer granularity. Our three key metrics measure the degree of persona alignment and consistency within and across generations. Our approach enables a more precise and realistic assessment of persona fidelity by identifying subtle deviations that real users would encounter. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that our framework effectively detects persona inconsistencies that prior methods... | Jisu Shin, Juhyun Oh, Eunsu Kim, Hoyun Song, Alice Oh |  |

Specifically, we analyze how intermediate layer representations, when projected into the vocabulary space, favor certain languages during generation—termed as latent languages. We categorize non-English-centric models into two groups: CPMs, which are English-centric models with continued pre-training on its specialized language, and BLMs, which are pre-trained on a balanced mix of multiple languages from scratch. Our findings reveal that while English-centric models rely exclusively on English as their latent language, non-English-centric models activate multiple latent languages, dynamically selecting the most similar one based on both the source and target languages. This also influences responses to culture difference questions, reducing English-centric biases in non-English models.

However, most existing evaluation practices are not designed for LLM-generated topics and result in low inter-annotator agreement scores, hindering the reliable use of LLMs for the task. To address this, we introduce T5Score, an evaluation methodology that decomposes the quality of a topic set into quantifiable aspects, measurable through easy-to-perform annotation tasks. This framing enables a convenient, manual or automatic, evaluation procedure resulting in a strong inter-annotator agreement score.To substantiate our methodology and claims, we perform extensive experimentation on multiple datasets and report the results. | Itamar Trainin, Omri Abend |  |

To improve text reliability, Contrastive Decoding (CD) refines token selection by leveraging differences between an expert and base model, penalizing low-quality token choices. However, CD employs static weighting between models, making it sensitive to variations in model architecture and input characteristics, often resulting in suboptimal token selection and error propagation throughout generation. We propose Uncertainty-Aware Contrastive Decoding (UCD), a method that dynamically adjusts model contributions at each decoding step based on uncertainty. We introduce a cumulative energy function, where uncertainty is quantified as the negative log-sum-exp over logits, and decomposed into entropy and expected logit components. This energy serves as a dynamic confidence signal, guiding adaptive model weighting during generation. We... | Hakyung Lee, Subeen Park, Joowang Kim, Sungjun Lim, Kyungwoo Song |  |

However, existing approaches primarily rely on a single prompt to generate event arguments in a fixed, predetermined order. Such a rigid approach overlooks the complex structural and dynamic interdependencies among event arguments. In this work, we present GEMS, a multi-prompt learning framework that Generates Event arguments via Multi-perspective prompts and ontology Steering. Specifically, GEMS utilizes multiple unfilled prompts for each sentence, predicting event arguments in varying sequences to explicitly capture the interrelationships between arguments. These predictions are subsequently aggregated using a voting mechanism. Furthermore, an ontology-driven steering mechanism is proposed to ensure that the generated arguments are contextually appropriate and consistent with event-specific knowledge.

This raises a fundamental question: How do LLMs achieve such multilingual capabilities? Focusing on languages written in non-Roman scripts, we investigate the role of Romanization—the representation of non-Roman scripts using Roman characters—as a potential bridge in multilingual processing. Using mechanistic interpretability techniques, we analyze next-token generation and find that intermediate layers frequently represent target words in Romanized form before transitioning to native script, a phenomenon we term Latent Romanization. Further, through activation patching experiments, we demonstrate that LLMs encode semantic concepts similarly across native and Romanized scripts, suggesting a shared underlying representation. Additionally, for translation into non-Roman script languages, our findings reveal that when the target language is in Romanized... | Alan Saji, Jaavid Aktar Husain, Thanmay Jayakumar, Raj Dabre, Anoop Kunchukuttan, Ratish Puduppully |  |

Cross-language disparities in reasoning-based recommendations remain largely unexplored, with a lack of even descriptive analysis. This study is the first to address this gap. We test LLM’s applicability and capability in providing personalized advice across three key scenarios: university applications, travel, and relocation.We investigate multilingual bias in state-of-the-art LLMs by analyzing their responses to decision-making tasks across multiple languages. We quantify bias in model-generated scores and assess the impact of demographic factors and reasoning strategies (e.g., Chain-of-Thought prompting) on bias patterns.

However, multi-hop question answering (MHQA) over long contexts, which demands both robust knowledge-intensive reasoning and efficient processing of lengthy documents, remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches often struggle to balance these requirements, either neglecting explicit reasoning or incurring expensive computational costs due to full-attention mechanisms over long contexts. To address this, we propose \*\*Search-in-Context (SIC)\*\*, a novel framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with dynamic key-value (KV) retrieval to enable iterative, context-aware reasoning. SIC dynamically retrieves critical KV pairs (e.g., 4K tokens) at each step, prioritizing relevant evidence while mitigating the “lost in the middle” problem.

This approach leverages multi-turn interactions where the LLM interviewer actively provides feedback on responses and poses follow-up questions to the evaluated LLM. At the start of the interview, the LLM interviewer dynamically modifies datasets to generate initial questions, mitigating data contamination. We apply the LLM-as-an-Interviewer framework to evaluate six models on the reasoning, factuality and instruction-following tasks. Our results show that the framework effectively provides insights into LLM performance, including the quality of initial responses, adaptability to feedback, and ability to address follow-up queries like clarification or additional knowledge requests. The framework also addresses key limitations of conventional methods like LLM-as-a-Judge, including verbosity bias and inconsistency across runs.

Clearly defined intentions are essential for guiding both the supporter’s motivations and the overall emotional support process. In this paper, we propose the Intention-centered Emotional Support Conversation (IntentionESC) framework, which defines the possible intentions of supporters in emotional support conversations, identifies key emotional state aspects for inferring these intentions, and maps them to appropriate support strategies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in text generating, they fundamentally operate as probabilistic models trained on extensive datasets, lacking a true understanding of human thought processes and intentions. To address this limitation, we introduce the Intention CEntric Chain-of-Thought (ICECoT) mechanism. ICECoT enables LLMs to mimic human reasoning by analyzing... | Xinjie Zhang, Wenxuan Wang, Qin Jin |  |

However, one challenge is that texts sometimes contain covert contextual cues that are rich in affective semantics, which warrant higher-order reasoning abilities to infer emotional states, not simply the emotions conveyed. This study advances beyond surface-level perceptual features to investigate how large language models (LLMs) reason about others’ emotional states using contextual information, within a Theory-of-Mind (ToM) framework. Grounded in Cognitive Appraisal Theory, we curate a specialized ToM evaluation dataset to assess both forward reasoning—from context to emotion—and backward reasoning—from emotion to inferred context. We showed that LLMs can reason to a certain extent, although they are poor at associating situational outcomes and appraisals with specific emotions. Our work highlights the need for psychological theories in the... | Gerard Christopher Yeo, Kokil Jaidka |  |

Automatically generating the Impression from the Findings is crucial for reducing radiologists’ workload and improving diagnostic accuracy. Pretrained models that excel in common abstractive summarization problems encounter challenges when applied to specialized medical domains largely due to the complex terminology and the necessity for accurate clinical context. Such tasks in medical domains demand extracting core information, avoiding context shifts, and maintaining proper flow. Misuse of medical terms can lead to drastic clinical errors. To address these issues, we introduce a sequential transfer learning that ensures key content extraction and coherent summarization. Sequential transfer learning often faces challenges like initial parameter decay and knowledge loss, which we resolve with the Fisher matrix regularization. Using MIMIC-CXR and Open-I datasets, our model, CSTRL —... | Mst. Fahmida Sultana Naznin, Adnan Ibney Faruq, Mostafa Rifat Tazwar, Md Jobayer, Md. Mehedi Hasan Shawon, Md. Rakibul Hasan |  |

While prompt-based through prompt engineering is common, its effectiveness relies on the assumption that models inherently understand biases. Our study systematically analyzed this assumption using the BBQ and StereoSet benchmarks on both open-source models as well as commercial GPT model. Experimental results indicate that prompt-based is often superficial; for instance, the Llama2-7B-Chat model misclassified over 90% of unbiased content as biased, despite achieving high accuracy in identifying bias issues on the BBQ dataset. Additionally, specific evaluation and question settings in bias benchmarks often lead LLMs to choose “evasive answers”, disregarding the core of the question and the relevance of the response to the context. Moreover, the apparent success of previous methods may stem from flawed evaluation metrics. Our research highlights a potential “false prosperity” in prompt-base... | Xinyi Yang, Runzhe Zhan, Shu Yang, Junchao Wu, Lidia S. Chao, Derek F. Wong |  |

Recently, many existing approaches tackle this problem with Large Language Models (LLMs), leveraging their strong capability in understanding user queries and generating corresponding SQL code. Yet, the parametric knowledge in LLMs might be limited to covering all the diverse and domain-specific queries that require grounding in various database schemas, which makes generated SQLs less accurate oftentimes. To tackle this, we propose constructing the knowledge base for text-to-SQL, a foundational source of knowledge, from which we retrieve and generate the necessary knowledge for given queries. In particular, unlike existing approaches that either manually annotate knowledge or generate only a few pieces of knowledge for each query, our knowledge base is comprehensive, which is constructed based on a combination... | Jinheon Baek, Horst Samulowitz, Oktie Hassanzadeh, Dharmashankar Subramanian, Sola Shirai, Alfio Gliozzo, Debarun Bhattacharjya |  |

However, existing methods for Jupyter Notebooks mostly focus on generating descriptions from code snippets or table outputs independently. On the other side, descriptions should be personalized as users have different purposes in different scenarios while previous work ignored this situation during description generation. In this work, we formulate a new task, personalized description generation with code, tables,and user-written guidelines in Jupyter Notebooks. To evaluate this new task, we collect and propose a benchmark, namely NBDESCRIB: , containing code, tables, and user-written guidelines as inputs and personalized descriptions as targets. Extensive experiments show that while existing models of text generation are able to generate fluent and readable descriptions, they still struggle to produce... | Xuye Liu, Tengfei Ma, Yimu Wang, Fengjie Wang, Jian Zhao |  |

To reduce RAG overhead, from longer context, context compression is necessary. However, prior compression methods do not focus on filtering out non-evidential information, which limit the performance in LLM-based RAG. We thus propose Evidentiality-guided RAG, or ECoRAG framework. ECoRAG improves LLM performance by compressing retrieved documents based on evidentiality, ensuring whether answer generation is supported by the correct evidence. As an additional step, ECoRAG reflects whether the compressed content provides sufficient evidence, and if not, retrieves more until sufficient. Experiments show that ECoRAG improves LLM performance on ODQA tasks, outperforming existing compression methods. Furthermore, ECoRAG is highly cost-efficient, as it not only reduces latency but also minimizes token usage by... | Yeonseok Jeong, Jinsu Kim, Dohyeon Lee, Seungwon Hwang |  |

Recent advances in natural language processing, particularly large language models, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in text analysis and reasoning, offering promising solutions for automating compliance processes. This survey examines the current state of automated data compliance, analyzing key challenges and approaches across problem areas. We identify critical limitations in current datasets and techniques, including issues of adaptability, completeness, and trust. Looking ahead, we propose research directions to address these challenges, emphasizing standardized evaluation frameworks and balanced human-AI collaboration. | Jivitesh Jain, Nivedhitha Dhanasekaran, Mona T.

However, these metrics generate explanations without standardized criteria, and the overall quality of the generated explanations remains unverified. In this paper, we propose EXPERT, a reference-free evaluation metric that provides structured explanations based on three fundamental criteria: fluency, relevance, and descriptiveness. By constructing large-scale datasets of high-quality structured explanations, we develop a two-stage evaluation template to effectively supervise a vision-language model for both scoring and explanation generation. EXPERT achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets while providing significantly higher-quality explanations than existing metrics, as validated through comprehensive human evaluation.

In this position paper, we explore many lines of work in different communities in AI and cognitive science. Inspired by cognitive work, we view ToM tasks as a two-step process: (I) first, determining whether and how to invoke ToM, which includes setting the appropriate Depth of Mentalizing (DoM); and (II) second, applying correct inference given the appropriate DoM. We identify that many works about ToM in LLMs, such as benchmarks and add-on modules, tend to unjustly overlook the first step and focus exclusively on the second one, which can be framed as a logic-reasoning task. We support our distinction with empirical evidence about the difficulty of the different steps in existing benchmarks. We conclude with suggestions for improved evaluation of ToM capabilities, inspired by dynamic environments used in cognitive tasks in biological agents. | Eitan Wagner, Nitay Alon, Joseph M.

However, the extent to which this bias manifests in fact-oriented tasks, especially within retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks—where keyword extraction and factual accuracy take precedence over stylistic elements—remains unclear. Our study addresses this knowledge gap by simulating two critical phases of the RAG framework. In the first phase, LLMs evaluated human-authored and model-generated passages, emulating the pointwise reranking phase. The second phase involves conducting pairwise reading comprehension tests to simulate the generation phase. Contrary to previous findings indicating a self-preference in rating tasks, our results reveal no significant self-preference effect in RAG frameworks. Instead, we observe that factual accuracy significantly influences LLMs’ output, even in... | YenShan Chen, Jing Jin, PengTing Kuo, ChaoWei Huang, YunNung Chen |  |

Not knowing when two evaluations are comparable in this sense means we currently lack the ability to draw conclusions based on multiple independently conducted evaluations. It is hard to see how this issue can be fully addressed other than by the creation of a standard set of quality criterion names and definitions that the evaluations in use in NLP can be grounded in. Taking a descriptivist approach, the QCET Quality Criteria for Evaluation Taxonomy derives a standard set of 114 quality criterion names and definitions from three surveys of a combined total of 933 evaluation experiments in NLP, and structures them into a reference taxonomy. We present QCET and its uses in (i) establishing comparability of existing evaluations, (ii) guiding the design of new evaluations, and (iii) assessing regulation compliance. | Anya Belz, Simon Mille, Craig Thomson |  |

We have compiled skLEP to encompass nine diverse tasks that span token-level, sentence-pair, and document-level challenges, thereby offering a thorough assessment of model capabilities. To create this benchmark, we curated new, original datasets tailored for Slovak and meticulously translated established English NLU resources. Within this paper, we also present the first systematic and extensive evaluation of a wide array of Slovak-specific, multilingual, and English pre-trained language models using the skLEP tasks. Finally, we also release the complete benchmark data, an open-source toolkit facilitating both fine-tuning and evaluation of models, and a public leaderboard at https://github.com/slovak-nlp/sklep in the hopes of fostering reproducibility and drive future research in Slovak NLU. | Marek Suppa, Andrej Ridzik, Daniel Hládek, Tomas Javurek, Viktoria Ondrejova, Kristína Sásiková, Martin Tamajka, Marián Simko |  |

Studying NVC in general is challenging because of its high variance in interpretation among individuals and cultures, but mime—the theatrical technique of suggesting intent using only gesture, expression, and movement—is a subset of NVC with much lower human interpretation variance. As a gateway for evaluating vision-language models on their understanding of NVC, we propose Mime Identification-based Multimodal Evaluation (MIME), a gesture recognition task built upon a novel corpus of mimed activity comprising 86 unique gestures with a variety of perturbations applied to the avatar, background, and viewpoint for evaluating recognition robustness. We find that both open-weight and API-based vision-language models perform significantly worse than humans at identifying mimed gestures in MIME, motivating the need for increased research for instilling... | Hyundong Justin Cho, Spencer Lin, Tejas Srinivasan, Michael Saxon, Deuksin Kwon, Natali T.

However, limited research has explored which types of critiques are most effective for improving model responses or how to generate such critiques. To address this gap, we introduce Refinement-oriented Critique Optimization (RCO), a novel framework designed to train critic models using refinement signals. RCO uses a feedback loop where critiques, generated by the critic model, guide the actor model in refining its responses. The critique utility (CU) quantifies the effectiveness of these refinements, serving as the reward signal for training the critic model. By focusing on critiques that lead to better refinements, RCO eliminates the need for direct critique preference assessment, ensuring that critiques driving meaningful improvements are rewarded. We evaluate RCO across five tasks—dialog generation, summarization,... | Tianshu Yu, Chao Xiang, Mingchuan Yang, Pei Ke, Bosi Wen, Cunxiang Wang, Jiale Cheng, Li Zhang, Xinyu Mu, Chuxiong Sun, Minlie Huang |  |

Existing approaches transfer the soft prompt trained by combining all source tasks or a single “high-similar” source task one-time-only. However, we find that the optimal transfer performance often comes from a combination of source tasks, which is neither one nor all. Further, we find that the similarity between source and target tasks also changes dynamically during fine-tuning after transfering, making similarity calculation in the initiation stage inadequate. To address these issues, we propose a method called Dynamic Task Vector Grouping (DTVG), whose core ideas contain (1) measuring the task similarity with task vectors instead of soft prompt, (2) grouping the optimal source task combination based on two metrics: target similarity and knowledge consistency; (3) dynamically updating the combination in each iteration step. Extensive experiments on the 26 NLP... | Peiyi Zhang, Richong Zhang, Zhijie Nie, Ziqiao Wang |  |

However, they overlook the complexity of real-world scenarios. To quantify how existing benchmarks address practical applications, we introduce DICE-SCORE, a metric that evaluates the dispersion of tool-related information such as function name and parameter values throughout the dialogue. Analyzing existing benchmarks through DICE-SCORE reveals notably low scores, highlighting the need for more realistic scenarios. To address this gap, we present DICE-BENCH, a framework that constructs practical function-calling datasets by synthesizing conversations through a tool graph that maintains dependencies across rounds and a multi-agent system with distinct personas to enhance dialogue naturalness. The final dataset comprises 1,607 high-DICE-SCORE instances. Our experiments on 19 LLMs with DICE-BENCH show that significant advances are still required before such models can be deployed effectively in real-world settings.... | Kyochul Jang, Donghyeon Lee, Kyusik Kim, Dongseok Heo, Taewhoo Lee, Woojeong Kim, Bongwon Suh |  |

We propose Hash-RAG, a framework that integrates deep hashing techniques with systematic optimizations to address these limitations. Our queries directly learn binary hash codes from knowledgebase code, eliminating intermediate feature extraction steps, and significantly reducing storage and computational overhead. Building upon this hash-based efficient retrieval framework, we establish the foundation for fine-grained chunking. Consequently, we design a Prompt-Guided Chunk-to-Context (PGCC) module that leverages retrieved hash-indexed propositions and their original document segments through prompt engineering to enhance the LLM’s contextual awareness. Experimental evaluations on NQ, TriviaQA, and HotpotQA datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves a 90% reduction in retrieval time compared to conventional methods while maintaining... | Jinyu Guo, Xunlei Chen, Qiyang Xia, Zhaokun Wang, Jie Ou, Libo Qin, Shunyu Yao, Wenhong Tian |  |

Furthermore, adapting these systems to diverse constraints is challenging. To bridge this gap, we introduce TRIPS, a Text Revision agent via Iterative Planning and Searching, focusing on CTR. TRIPS utilizes a planner, a reviser (i.e., a large language model), and adaptable tools to generate revisions tailored to different scenarios. Specifically, we propose an iterative self-training alignment method to construct the planner, which generates tool usage and text revision plans. Furthermore, we propose Tool-Guided Monte Carlo Tree Search (TG-MCTS), a novel CTR algorithm that extends MCTS with tool-guided expansion and evaluation, enabling the search for optimal revision strategies across various scenarios. To evaluate TRIPS, we introduce ConsTRev, a dataset with multi-level constrained instructions for... | Hannan Cao, Hwee Tou Ng |  |

As the emphasis shifts toward enhancing reasoning during inference, MMRefine provides a framework that evaluates MLLMs’ abilities to detect and correct errors across six distinct scenarios beyond just comparing final accuracy before and after refinement. Furthermore, the benchmark analyzes the refinement performance by categorizing errors into six error types.Experiments with various open and closed MLLMs reveal bottlenecks and factors impeding refinement performance, highlighting areas for improvement in effective reasoning enhancement.

In this paper, we investigate the relationship between multiple PLs and English in the concept space of LLMs. We perform a few-shot translation task on 21 PL pairs using two Llama-based models. By decoding the embeddings of intermediate layers during this task, we observe that the concept space is closer to English (including PL keywords) and assigns high probabilities to English tokens in the second half of the intermediate layers. We analyze neuron activations for 11 PLs and English, finding that while language-specific neurons are primarily concentrated in the bottom layers, those exclusive to each PL tend to appear in the top layers. For PLs that are highly aligned with multiple other PLs, identifying language-specific neurons is not feasible. These PLs also tend to have a larger keyword set than other PLs and... | Amir Hossein Kargaran, Yihong Liu, François Yvon, Hinrich Schütze |  |

Structured matrix representations are a promising way for reducing the number of parameters of these models. However, it seems unrealistic to expect that weight matrices of pretrained models can be accurately represented by structured matrices without any fine-tuning.To overcome this issue, we utilize the fact that LLM output is invariant under certain orthogonal transformations of weight matrices.This insight can be leveraged to identify transformations that significantly improve the compressibility of weights within structured classes.The proposed approach is applicable to various types of structured matrices that support efficient projection operations.

Previously, their context window size imposed a limit on the number of examples that can be shown, making example selection techniques crucial for identifying the maximally effective set of examples. However, the recent advent of Long Context Language Models (LCLMs) has significantly increased the number of examples that can be included in context, raising an important question of whether ICL performance in a many-shot regime is still sensitive to the method of sample selection. To answer this, we revisit these approaches in the context of LCLMs through extensive experiments on 18 datasets spanning 4 tasks. Surprisingly, we observe that sophisticated example selection techniques do not yield significant improvements over a simple random sample selection method. Instead, we discover that the advent of LCLMs has fundamentally shifted the challenge of ICL... | Jinheon Baek, Sun Jae Lee, Prakhar Gupta, Geunseob Oh, Siddharth Dalmia, Prateek Kolhar |  |

Existing WAs are typically built by training large language models (LLMs) on domain-specific instruction data through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) only. However, SFT optimizes models to match a single reference, failing to capture the inherent flexibility of text editing, where multiple valid revisions exist. Therefore, solely relying on SFT limits WA performance. To address this limitation, we propose the Rationalize and Align framework, which enhances the WA performance with rationale (i.e., linguistic explanations) and alignment. Our framework automatically generates the rationale and preference data for writing tasks via distillation and self-training, eliminating the need for human annotation. These data are then leveraged to refine WA using a novel preference optimization method. Empirical results show that our framework significantly improves WA performance. Our WA outperforms both... | Hannan Cao, Hai Ye, Hwee Tou Ng |  |

To handle complex queries more effectively, researchers developed Adaptive-RAG (A-RAG) to enhance the generated quality through multiple interactions with external knowledge bases. Despite its effectiveness, A-RAG exacerbates the pre-existing efficiency challenges inherent in RAG, which are attributable to its reliance on multiple iterations of generation. Existing A-RAG approaches process all retrieved contents from scratch. However, they ignore the situation where there is a significant overlap in the content of the retrieval results across rounds. The overlapping content is redundantly represented, which leads to a large proportion of repeated computations, thus affecting the overall efficiency. To address this issue, this paper introduces a model-agnostic approach that can be generally applied to A-RAG methods, which is dedicated to reducing the redundant... | Jie Ou, Jinyu Guo, Shuaihong Jiang, Zhaokun Wang, Libo Qin, Shunyu Yao, Wenhong Tian |  |

However, their multilingual performance remains unclear and is under-evaluated for many other languages. Most benchmarks for multilinguality focus on classic NLP tasks or cover a minimal number of languages. We introduce MEXA, a method for assessing the multilingual capabilities of pre-trained English-centric LLMs using parallel sentences, which are available for more languages than existing downstream tasks. MEXA leverages that English-centric LLMs use English as a pivot language in their intermediate layers. MEXA computes the alignment between English and non-English languages using parallel sentences to evaluate the transfer of language understanding from English to other languages. This alignment can be used to estimate model performance in different languages. We conduct controlled experiments using various parallel datasets (FLORES-200 and Bible), models (Llama family, Gemma family,... | Amir Hossein Kargaran, Ali Modarressi, Nafiseh Nikeghbal, Jana Diesner, François Yvon, Hinrich Schütze |  |

However, this distributed architecture poses unprecedented challenges for model compression, as conventional quantization methods optimized for dense networks prove inadequate. This paper introduces a specialized quantization framework for MoE architectures, motivated by our discovery that weight matrices across expert networks exhibit distinctive channel-wise outlier distributions, necessitating a more nuanced compression approach. Through theoretical analysis incorporating Fisher Information matrices and condition number characteristics, we establish a fundamental relationship between layer functionality and quantization sensitivity, demonstrating that down-projection layers inherently demand higher precision compared to up-projection layers. Leveraging these insights, we develop an automated channel-wise quantization... | Zhanhao Xie, Yuexiao Ma, Xiawu Zheng, Fei Chao, Wanchen Sui, Yong Li, Shen Li, Rongrong Ji |  |

Existing approaches are mainly divided into Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) and Complex Query Answering (CQA). Both approaches have limitations: the first struggles to utilize KG context effectively when essential triplets related to the questions are missing in the given KGs, while the second depends on structured first-order logic queries. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework termed Aqua-QA. Aqua-QAapproximates query graphs from natural language questions, enabling reasoning over KGs. We evaluate Aqua-QA on challenging QA tasks where KGs are incomplete in the context of QA, and complex logical reasoning is required to answer natural language questions. Experimental results on these datasets demonstrate that Aqua-QA outperforms existing methods, showcasing its effectiveness in handling complex... | Hongjun Jeong, Minji Kim, Heesoo Jung, Ko Keun Kim, Hogun Park |  |

In e-commerce, customers increasingly seek LLM-based assistants to generate scripts and recommend products at each step, thereby facilitating convenient and efficient shopping experiences. However, this capability remains underexplored due to several challenges, including the inability of LLMs to simultaneously conduct script planning and product retrieval, difficulties in matching products caused by semantic discrepancies between planned actions and search queries, and a lack of methods and benchmark data for evaluation. In this paper, we step forward by formally defining the task of E-commerce Script Planning (EcomScript) as three sequential subtasks. We propose a novel framework that enables the scalable generation of product-enriched scripts by associating products with each step based on the semantic similarity... | Weiqi Wang, Limeng Cui, Xin Liu, Sreyashi Nag, Wenju Xu, Chen Luo, Sheikh Muhammad Sarwar, Yang Li, Hansu Gu, Hui Liu, Changlong Yu, Jiaxin Bai, Yifan Gao, Haiyang Zhang, Qi He, Shuiwang Ji, Yangqiu Song |  |

Despite advancements in graph learning methods, challenges still remain in explainability when graphs are associated with semantic features. In this paper, we present GraphNarrator, the first method designed to generate natural language explanations for Graph Neural Networks. GraphNarrator employs a generative language model that maps input-output pairs to explanations reflecting the model’s decision-making process. To address the lack of ground truth explanations to train the model, we propose first generating pseudo-labels that capture the model’s decisions from saliency-based explanations, then using Expert Iteration to iteratively train the pseudo-label generator based on training objectives on explanation quality. The high-quality pseudo-labels are finally utilized to train an end-to-end explanation... | Bo Pan, Zhen Xiong, Guanchen Wu, Zheng Zhang, Yifei Zhang, Yuntong Hu, Liang Zhao |  |

However, RMs are primarily trained and evaluated in English, and their capabilities in multilingual settings remain largely understudied. In this work, we conduct a systematic evaluation of several reward models in multilingual settings. We first construct the first-of-its-kind multilingual RM evaluation benchmark, M-RewardBench, consisting of 2.87k preference instances for 23 typologically diverse languages, that tests the chat, safety, reasoning, and translation capabilities of RMs. We then rigorously evaluate a wide range of reward models on M-RewardBench, offering fresh insights into their performance across diverse languages. We identify a significant gap in RMs’ performances between English and non-English languages and show that RM preferences can change substantially from one language to another. We also present... | Srishti Gureja, Lester James Validad Miranda, Shayekh Bin Islam, Rishabh Maheshwary, Drishti Sharma, Gusti Triandi Winata, Nathan Lambert, Sebastian Ruder, Sara Hooker, Marzieh Fadaee |  |

Thus, our work serves a three-fold purpose: First, we present the first taxonomy of human feedback consolidating the entire programming process, which promotes fine-grained evaluation. Second, we introduce ELABORATIONSET, a novel programming dataset specifically designed for human-LLM collaboration, meticulously annotated to enable large-scale simulated human feedback and facilitate cost-effective real human interaction studies. Third, we introduce ELABORATION, a novel benchmark to facilitate a thorough assessment of human-LLM competitive programming. With ELABORATION, we pinpoint strengthes and weaknesses of existing methods, thereby setting the foundation for furture improvement.... | Xinwei Yang, Zhaofeng Liu, Chen Huang, Jiashuai Zhang, Tong Zhang, Yifan Zhang, Wenqiang Lei |  |

Researchers have documented a sort of “bias” in the significant correlations between demographics (e.g., race, gender) in LLM prompts and responses, but it remains unclear how LLM fairness could be evaluated with more rigorous definitions, such as group fairness or fair representations. We analyze a variety of technical fairness frameworks and find inherent challenges in each that make the development of a fair LLM intractable. We show that each framework either does not logically extend to the general-purpose AI context or is infeasible in practice, primarily due to the large amounts of unstructured training data and the many potential combinations of human populations, use cases, and sensitive attributes. These inherent challenges would persist for general-purpose AI, including LLMs,... | Jacy Reese Anthis, Kristian Lum, Michael D. Ekstrand, Avi Feller, Chenhao Tan |  |

While SFT excels in efficiency and PO in effectiveness, they are often combined sequentially without integrating their optimization objectives. This approach ignores the opportunities to bridge their paradigm gap and take the strengths from both. In this paper, we interpret SFT and PO with two sub-processes — \*Preference Estimation\* and \*Transition Optimization\* — defined at token level within the Markov Decision Process (MDP). This modeling shows that SFT is only a special case of PO with inferior estimation and optimization. PO estimates the model’s preference by its entire generation, while SFT only scores model’s subsequent predicted tokens based on prior tokens from ground truth answer. These priors deviates from model’s distribution, hindering the preference estimation and transition optimization. Building on this view,... | Ermo Hua, Biqing Qi, Kaiyan Zhang, Kai Tian, Xingtai Lv, Ning Ding, Bowen Zhou |  |

We test whether these benchmarks are robust to lengthening the model outputs via a more realistic user prompt, in the commonly studied domain of gender-occupation bias, as a step towards measuring Realistic Use and Tangible Effects (i.e., RUTEd evaluations). From the current literature, we adapt three standard metrics of next-word prediction (neutrality, skew, and stereotype), and we develop analogous RUTEd evaluations in three contexts of real-world LLM use: children’s bedtime stories, user personas, and English language learning exercises. We find that standard bias metrics have no significant correlation with long-form output metrics. For example, selecting the least biased model based on the standard “trick tests” coincides with selecting the least biased model based on longer output no more than random chance. There may... | Kristian Lum, Jacy Reese Anthis, Kevin Robinson, Chirag Nagpal, Alexander Nicholas D'Amour |  |

Due to the limited input length, existing methods often adopt the sliding window strategy. Such a strategy, though effective, is inefficient as it involves repetitive and serialized processing, which usually re-evaluates relevant passages multiple times. As a result, it incurs redundant API costs, which are proportional to the number of inference tokens. The development of long-context LLMs enables the full ranking of all passages within a single inference, avoiding redundant API costs. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of long-context LLMs for ranking tasks in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. Surprisingly, our experiments reveal that full ranking with long-context LLMs can deliver superior performance in the supervised fine-tuning setting with a huge efficiency improvement. Furthermore, we identify two limitations of fine-tuning the full ranking model based on existing... | Wenhan Liu, Xinyu Ma, Yutao Zhu, Ziliang Zhao, Shuaiqiang Wang, Dawei Yin, Zhicheng Dou |  |

Traditionally, CXR report generation relies solely on data from a patient’s CXR exam, overlooking valuable information from patient electronic health records. Utilising the MIMIC-CXR and MIMIC-IV-ED datasets, we investigate the use of patient data from emergency department (ED) records — such as vital signs measured and medicines reconciled during an ED stay — for CXR report generation, with the aim of enhancing diagnostic accuracy. We also investigate conditioning CXR report generation on the clinical history section of radiology reports, which has been overlooked in the literature. We introduce a novel approach to transform these heterogeneous data sources into patient data embeddings that prompt a multimodal language model (CXRMate-ED). Our comprehensive evaluation indicates that using a broader set of patient data significantly... | Aaron Nicolson, Shengyao Zhuang, Jason Dowling, Bevan Koopman |  |

To bridge the gap, we introduce \*\*CLEME2.0\*\*, a reference-based metric describing four fundamental aspects of GEC systems: hit-correction, wrong-correction, under-correction, and over-correction. They collectively contribute to exposing critical qualities and locating drawbacks of GEC systems. Evaluating systems by combining these aspects also leads to superior human consistency over other reference-based and reference-less metrics. Extensive experiments on two human judgment datasets and six reference datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method, achieving a new state-of-the-art result.

This shift prompts the question: can LLMs interpret structured data directly in its unstructured form? We propose an automatic evaluation data generation method for assessing LLMs’ reasoning capabilities on structure-rich text to explore this. Our approach supports 8 structured languages and 29 tasks, generating data with adjustable complexity through controllable nesting and structural width. We introduce StrucText-Eval, a benchmark containing 5,800 pre-generated and annotated samples designed to evaluate how well LLMs understand and reason through structured text. StrucText-Eval is divided into two suites: a regular Test suite (3,712 samples) and a Test-Hard suite (2,088 samples), the latter emphasizing the gap between human and model performance on more complex tasks.

Prior work on hypothesis generation can be broadly categorized into theory-driven and data-driven approaches. While both have proven effective in generating novel and plausible hypotheses, it remains an open question whether they can complement each other. To address this, we develop the first method that combines literature-based insights with data to perform LLM-powered hypothesis generation. We apply our method on five different datasets and demonstrate that integrating literature and data outperforms other baselines (8.97% over few-shot, 15.75% over literature-based alone, and 3.37% over data-driven alone). Additionally, we conduct the first human evaluation to assess the utility of LLM-generated hypotheses in assisting human decision-making on two challenging tasks: deception detection and AI generated content detection. Our results show that human accuracy improves significantly by 7.44% and... | Haokun Liu, Yangqiaoyu Zhou, Mingxuan Li, Chenfei Yuan, Chenhao Tan |  |

While existing methods attempt to achieve this through either direct instruction-response synthesis or preferential response optimization, they often struggle with constraint understanding and adaptation. This limitation becomes particularly evident when handling fine-grained constraints, leading to either hallucination or brittle performance. We introduce Generative Adversarial Policy Optimization (GAPO), a novel framework that combines GAN-based training dynamics with an encoder-only reward model to progressively learn and adapt to increasingly complex constraints. GAPO leverages adversarial training to automatically generate training samples of varying difficulty while utilizing the encoder-only architecture to better capture prompt-response relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate GAPO’s superior performance across multiple... | Zhouhong Gu, Xingzhou Chen, Xiaoran Shi, Tao Wang, Suhang Zheng, Tianyu Li, Hongwei Feng, Yanghua Xiao |  |

In code generation, a key application of LLMs, manual annotation of code instruction data is costly. Recent methods, such as Code Evol-Instruct and OSS-Instruct, leverage LLMs to synthesize large-scale code instruction data, significantly improving LLM coding capabilities. However, these approaches face limitations due to unidirectional synthesis and randomness-driven generation, which restrict data quality and diversity. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Tree-of-Evolution (ToE), a novel framework that models code instruction synthesis process with a tree structure, exploring multiple evolutionary paths to alleviate the constraints of unidirectional generation. Additionally, we propose optimization-driven evolution, which refines each generation step based on the quality of the previous... | Ziyang Luo, Kaixin Li, Hongzhan Lin, Yuchen Tian, Mohan S.

In this paper, we delve into the validation and comparison of the ethical biases of LLMs concerning globally discussed and potentially sensitive topics, hypothesizing that these biases may arise from language-specific distinctions. Introducing the Multilingual Sensitive Questions & Answers Dataset (\*\*MSQAD\*\*), we collected news articles from Human Rights Watch covering 17 topics, and generated socially sensitive questions along with corresponding responses in multiple languages. We scrutinized the biases of these responses across languages and topics, employing two statistical hypothesis tests. The results showed that the null hypotheses were rejected in most cases, indicating biases arising from cross-language differences. It demonstrates that ethical biases in responses are widespread across various languages, and notably, these biases were prevalent... | Seunguk Yu, Juhwan Choi, YoungBin Kim |  |

Dense retrievers typically outperform sparse methods like BM25 by leveraging semantic embeddings in many tasks; however, they require labeled query-document pairs for fine-tuning, which poses a significant challenge in MHQA due to the complexity of the reasoning steps. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Retriever Supervision with Consistency and Relevance (ReSCORE), a novel method for training dense retrievers for MHQA without the need for labeled documents. ReSCORE leverages large language models to measure document-question relevance with answer consistency and utilizes this information to train a retriever within an iterative question-answering framework. Evaluated on three MHQA benchmarks, our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ReSCORE, with significant improvements in retrieval performance that consequently lead to state-of-the-art Exact Match... | Dosung Lee, Wonjun Oh, Boyoung Kim, Minyoung Kim, Joonsuk Park, Paul Hongsuck Seo |  |

However, existing automated fact-checking evaluation methods rely on static datasets and classification metrics, which fail to automatically evaluate the justification production and uncover the nuanced limitations of LLMs in fact-checking. In this work, we introduce FACT-AUDIT, an agent-driven framework that adaptively and dynamically assesses LLMs’ fact-checking capabilities. Leveraging importance sampling principles and multi-agent collaboration, FACT-AUDIT generates adaptive and scalable datasets, performs iterative model-centric evaluations, and updates assessments based on model-specific responses. By incorporating justification production alongside verdict prediction, this framework provides a comprehensive and evolving audit of LLMs’ factual reasoning capabilities, to investigate their trustworthiness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FACT-AUDIT effectively differentiates among... | Hongzhan Lin, Yang Deng, Yuxuan Gu, Wenxuan Zhang, Jing Ma, SeeKiong Ng, TatSeng Chua |  |

The trend is to build general models able to address any task. Even though transfer learning and multitask learning try to leverage the underlying task space, no well-founded tools are available to study its structure. This study proposes a theoretically grounded setup to define the notion of task and to compute the inclusion between two tasks from a statistical deficiency point of view. We propose a tractable proxy as information sufficiency to estimate the degree of inclusion between tasks, show its soundness on synthetic data, and use it to reconstruct empirically the classic NLP pipeline. | Loïc Fosse, Frédéric Béchet, Benoît Favre, Géraldine Damnati, Gwénolé Lecorvé, Maxime Darrin, Philippe Formont, Pablo Piantanida |  |

Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has been proposed as a solution, yet its application in federated learning is complicated by discordance in aggregation. Existing methods addressing this discordance often suffer from performance degradation at low ranks in heterogeneous data settings. In response, we introduce LoRA-A^2 (Low Rank Adaptation with Alternating freeze and Adaptive rank selection), which demonstrates robustness in challenging settings with low ranks and high data heterogeneity. Our experimental findings reveal that LoRA-A^2 maintains performance even under extreme heterogeneity and low rank conditions, achieving up to a 99.8% reduction in uploaded parameters compared to full fine-tuning without compromising performance. This adaptive mechanism boosts robustness and communication efficiency in federated fine-tuning,... | Jabin Koo, Minwoo Jang, Jungseul Ok |  |

To address this problem, we propose TrickCatcher, an LLM-powered approach to generating test cases for uncovering bugs in plausible programs. TrickCatcher operates in three stages: First, it uses an LLM to generate program variants based on the program under test (PUT) and its specification. Second, it employs an LLM to construct an input generator from the specification for producing test inputs. Finally, these inputs are executed on both the PUT and its program variants to detect inconsistencies in their outputs. We evaluate TrickCatcher on two datasets, TrickyBugs and EvalPlus, which include 366 human-written and 151 AI-generated plausible programs with tricky bugs. TrickCatcher achieves recall, precision, and F1 scores that are 1.80×, 2.65×, and 1.66× those of the state-of-the-art baselines, respectively.

We find that CoTs consist mainly of simple reasoning forms, with a small proportion (4.7%) of key reasoning steps that truly impact conclusions. However, previous distillation methods typically involve supervised fine-tuning student SLMs only on correct CoTs data produced by teacher LLMs, resulting in students struggling to learn the key, instead imitating the teacher’s reasoning forms and making errors or omissions in reasoning. To address these issues, drawing an analogy to human learning, where analyzing mistakes according to correct solutions often reveals the crucial steps leading to successes or failures, we propose mistakE-Driven key reasonIng step distillaTion (EDIT), a novel method that further aids SLMs learning key reasoning steps rather than mere... | Chengwei Dai, Kun Li, Wei Zhou, Songlin Hu |  |

This evolution has birthed a novel paradigm in NLP, i.e., human-model cooperation, that has yielded remarkable progress in numerous NLP tasks in recent years. In this paper, we take the first step to present a thorough review of human-model cooperation, exploring its principles, formalizations, and open challenges. In particular, we introduce a new taxonomy that provides a unified perspective to summarize existing approaches. Also, we discuss potential frontier areas and their corresponding challenges.

However, due to their semantic obscurity and expressive diversity, it is rather challenging to identify them. Existing methods mostly focus on superficial text features, ignoring the associations of hyperbole and metaphor as well as the effect of implicit emotion on perceiving these rhetorical devices. To implement these hypotheses, we propose an emotion-guided hyperbole and metaphor detection framework based on bidirectional dynamic interaction (EmoBi). Firstly, the emotion analysis module deeply mines the emotion connotations behind hyperbole and metaphor. Next, the emotion-based domain mapping module identifies the target and source domains to gain a deeper understanding of the implicit meanings of hyperbole and metaphor. Finally, the bidirectional dynamic interaction module enables the mutual promotion between hyperbole and metaphor.

It motivates researchers to introduce more examples to provide additional contextual information for the generation. However, existing methods show a significant limitation due to the problem of excessive growth in context length which causes a large hardware burden. Additionally, shallow-relevant examples selected by out-off-shelf tools hinder LLMs from capturing useful contextual information for generation. In this paper, to approach these limitations, we propose UniICL, a novel Unified ICL framework that unifies demonstration compression, demonstration selection, and final response generation. Furthermore, to avoid repeated compression of the same demonstration and boost inference efficiency, we design a tailored compression strategy that allows UniICL caching compression results into Demonstration Bank(DB).

We introduce BelarusianGLUE — a natural language understanding benchmark for Belarusian, an East Slavic language, with ≈15K instances in five tasks: sentiment analysis, linguistic acceptability, word in context, Winograd schema challenge, textual entailment. A systematic evaluation of BERT models and LLMs against this novel benchmark reveals that both types of models approach human-level performance on easier tasks, such as sentiment analysis, but there is a significant gap in performance between machine and human on a harder task — Winograd schema challenge. We find the optimal choice of model type to be task-specific: e.g. BERT models underperform on textual entailment task but are competitive for linguistic acceptability.

Covering three practical domains – airline baggage fees, NBA transactions, and tax regulations – RuleArena assesses LLMs’ proficiency in handling intricate natural language instructions that demand long-context understanding, logical reasoning, and accurate mathematical computation. Two key attributes distinguish RuleArena from traditional rule-based reasoning benchmarks: (1) it extends beyond standard first-order logic representations, and (2) it is grounded in authentic, practical scenarios, providing insights into the suitability and reliability of LLMs for real-world applications. Our findings reveal several notable limitations in LLMs: (1) they struggle to identify and apply the appropriate rules, frequently becoming confused by similar but distinct regulations, (2) they cannot consistently perform... | Ruiwen Zhou, Wenyue Hua, Liangming Pan, Sitao Cheng, Xiaobao Wu, En Yu, William Yang Wang |  |

Its design is consistent with the principles of rotary position embedding (RoPE) and aligns with human perception of relative distance, enabling robust performance in real-world settings with variable-length inputs.

However, existing methods often suffer from computational inefficiency and redundancy. First, they overlook the diversity of task difficulties, leading to unnecessarily extensive searches even for easy tasks. Second, they neglect the semantics of reasoning paths, resulting in redundant exploration of semantically identical paths. To address these limitations, we propose Semantic Exploration with Adaptive Gating (SEAG), a computationally efficient method. SEAG employs an adaptive gating mechanism that dynamically decides whether to conduct a tree search, based on the confidence level of answers from a preceding simple reasoning method. Furthermore, its tree-based exploration consolidates semantically identical reasoning steps, reducing redundant explorations while maintaining or even... | Sungjae Lee, Hyejin Park, Jaechang Kim, Jungseul Ok |  |

However, current benchmarks have issues like relying on bounding boxes, ignoring perspective substitutions, or allowing questions to be answered using only the model’s prior knowledge without image understanding. To address these issues, we introduce SpatialMQA, a human-annotated spatial relation reasoning benchmark based on COCO2017, which enables MLLMs to focus more on understanding images in the objective world. To ensure data quality, we design a well-tailored annotation procedure, resulting in SpatialMQA consisting of 5,392 samples. Based on this benchmark, a series of closed- and open-source MLLMs are implemented and the results indicate that the current state-of-the-art MLLM achieves only 48.14% accuracy, far below the human-level accuracy of 98.40%. Extensive experimental analyses are also conducted, suggesting the future research directions.

Recent efforts have been oriented at incorporating contextual representations in topic modeling and have been shown to outperform classical topic models. These approaches are typically slow, volatile, and require heavy preprocessing for optimal results. We present Semantic Signal Separation (S3), a theory-driven topic modeling approach in neural embedding spaces. S3 conceptualizes topics as independent axes of semantic space and uncovers these by decomposing contextualized document embeddings using Independent Component Analysis. Our approach provides diverse and highly coherent topics, requires no preprocessing, and is demonstrated to be the fastest contextual topic model, being, on average, 4.5x faster than the runner-up BERTopic. We offer an implementation of S3, and all contextual baselines, in the Turftopic Python package. | Márton Kardos, Jan Kostkan, Kenneth C. Enevoldsen, ArnaultQuentin Vermillet, Kristoffer L.

However, conventional task-specific adaptation approaches do not show simultaneous memory saving and inference speedup at deployment time. Practical compression techniques like quantization and pruning require dedicated hardware or kernel support to achieve measured inference speedup. We develop TrimLLM based on the layer-wise specialization phenomenon we empirically observed and verified on contemporary LLMs. TrimLLM reduces the depth of LLMs via progressive layer dropping. We show it retains LLMs’ capacity in specific domains and achieves inference speedup irrespective of hardware and deep learning frameworks. We evaluated TrimLLM on LLMs of various sizes for inference; models adapted on medical, legal, and financial datasets all demonstrate 2.1 - 5.7× inference speedup on consumer GPUs and up to 3.1× speedup... | Lanxiang Hu, Tajana Rosing, Hao Zhang |  |

The scale and versatility of such evaluations make the use of LLM-based judges a compelling solution for this challenge. Crucially, this approach requires first to validate the quality of the LLM judge itself. Previous work has focused on instance-based assessment of LLM judges, where a judge is evaluated over a set of responses, or response pairs, while being agnostic to their source systems. We argue that this setting overlooks critical factors affecting system-level ranking, such as a judge’s positive or negative bias towards certain systems. To address this gap, we conduct the first large-scale study of LLM judges as system rankers. System scores are generated by aggregating judgment scores over multiple system outputs, and the judge’s quality is assessed by comparing the resulting system ranking to a human-based... | Ariel Gera, Odellia Boni, Yotam Perlitz, Roy BarHaim, Lilach Eden, Asaf Yehudai |  |

However, many problems remain to be investigated for this direction. For the task of Relation Extraction (RE), we find that samples generated by directly prompting LLMs may easily have high structural similarities with each other. They tend to use a limited variety of phrasing while expressing the relation between a pair of entities. Therefore, in this paper, we study how to effectively improve the diversity of the training samples generated with LLMs for RE, while also maintaining their correctness. We first try to make the LLMs produce dissimilar samples by directly giving instructions in In-Context Learning (ICL) prompts. Then, we propose an approach to fine-tune LLMs for diversity training sample generation through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our experiments on commonly used RE datasets show that both attempts can improve the quality of... | Zexuan Li, Hongliang Dai, Piji Li |  |

Research in machine-generated text detection is however mostly focused on the English language and longer texts, such as news articles, scientific papers or student essays. Social-media texts are usually much shorter and often feature informal language, grammatical errors, or distinct linguistic items (e.g., emoticons, hashtags). There is a gap in studying the ability of existing methods in detection of such texts, reflected also in the lack of existing multilingual benchmark datasets. To fill this gap we propose the first multilingual (22 languages) and multi-platform (5 social media platforms) dataset for benchmarking machine-generated text detection in the social-media domain, called MultiSocial. It contains 472,097 texts, of which about 58k are human-written and approximately the same amount is generated by each of 7 multilingual LLMs. We use this... | Dominik Macko, Jakub Kopal, Róbert Móro, Ivan Srba |  |

Recent works utilize feedbacks generated from erroneous cases to guide the prompt optimization. During inference, they may further retrieve several semantically-related exemplars and concatenate them to the optimized prompts to improve the performance. However, those works only utilize the feedback at the current step, ignoring historical and unseleccted feedbacks which are potentially beneficial. Moreover, the selection of exemplars only considers the general semantic relationship and may not be optimal in terms of task performance and matching with the optimized prompt. In this work, we propose an Exemplar-Guided Reflection with Memory mechanism (ERM) to realize more efficient and accurate prompt optimization. Specifically, we design an exemplar-guided reflection mechanism where the feedback generation is additionally guided by the generated exemplars.

Previous research has shown that LLMs can be effectively misused for generating disinformation news articles following predefined narratives. Their capabilities to generate personalized (in various aspects) content have also been evaluated and mostly found usable. However, a combination of personalization and disinformation abilities of LLMs has not been comprehensively studied yet. Such a dangerous combination should trigger integrated safety filters of the LLMs, if there are some. This study fills this gap by evaluating vulnerabilities of recent open and closed LLMs, and their willingness to generate personalized disinformation news articles in English. We further explore whether the LLMs can reliably meta-evaluate the personalization quality and whether the personalization affects the... | Aneta Zugecova, Dominik Macko, Ivan Srba, Róbert Móro, Jakub Kopál, Katarina Marcincinova, Matús Mesarcík |  |

To address this, we introduce EscapeBench—a benchmark suite of room escape game environments designed to challenge agents with creative reasoning, unconventional tool use, and iterative problem-solving to uncover implicit goals. Our results show that current LM models, despite employing working memory and Chain-of-Thought reasoning, achieve only 15% average progress without hints, highlighting their limitations in creativity. To bridge this gap, we propose EscapeAgent, a framework designed to enhance creative reasoning through Foresight (innovative tool use) and Reflection (identifying unsolved tasks). Experiments show that EscapeAgent can execute action chains over 1,000 steps while maintaining logical coherence. It navigates and completes games with up to 40% fewer steps... | Cheng Qian, Peixuan Han, Qinyu Luo, Bingxiang He, Xiusi Chen, Yuji Zhang, Hongyi Du, Jiarui Yao, Xiaocheng Yang, Denghui Zhang, Yunzhu Li, Heng Ji |  |

However, existing open-source datasets in operations research domain lack detailed annotations of the modeling process, such as variable definitions, focusing solely on objective values, which hinders reinforcement learning applications. To address this, we release the StructuredOR dataset, annotated with comprehensive labels that capture the complete mathematical modeling process. We further propose BPP-Search, an algorithm that integrates reinforcement learning into a tree-of-thought structure using Beam search, a Process reward model, and a pairwise Preference algorithm. This approach enables efficient exploration of tree structures, avoiding exhaustive search while improving accuracy. Extensive experiments on StructuredOR, NL4OPT, and MAMO-ComplexLP datasets show that BPP-Search significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Most existing methods depend heavily on often unreliable translation tools to bridge the language gap. In this paper, we propose a new approach that leverages a large language model (LLM) to generate high-quality pseudo-labelled data in the target language without the need for translation tools. First, the framework trains an ABSA model to obtain predictions for unlabelled target language data. Next, LLM is prompted to generate natural sentences that better represent these noisy predictions than the original text. The ABSA model is then further fine-tuned on the resulting pseudo-labelled dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method across six languages and five backbone models, surpassing previous state-of-the-art translation-based approaches. The proposed framework also supports... | Jakub Smíd, Pavel Pribán, Pavel Král |  |

Achieving a very high level of proficiency for an LLM within a specific domain often requires extensive training with relevant corpora, which is typically accompanied by a sacrifice in performance in other domains. In this paper, we aim to “play the dealt cards well” and propose to fuse models that are already highly-specialized directly. The proposed fusing framework, , consists of different distinct specialists that are already sufficiently trained on different domains (we mainly focus on language, coding, and mathematics in this paper). A token-level gating mechanism is introduced to blend the specialists’ outputs. A two-stage training strategy accompanied by balanced sampling is designed to ensure stability.

Based on these insights, we propose HybGRAG for HQA, consisting of a retriever bank and a critic module, with the following advantages:1.

Current moderation efforts, reliant on classifiers trained with extensive human-annotated data, struggle with scalability and adapting to new forms of harm. To address these challenges, we propose a novel re-ranking approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) in zero-shot and few-shot settings. Our method dynamically assesses and re-ranks content sequences, effectively mitigating harmful content exposure without requiring extensive labeled data. Alongside traditional ranking metrics, we also introduce two new metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of re-ranking in reducing exposure to harmful content. Through experiments on three datasets, three models and across three configurations, we demonstrate that our LLM-based approach significantly outperforms existing proprietary... | Rajvardhan Oak, Muhammad Haroon, Claire Wonjeong Jo, Magdalena Wojcieszak, Anshuman Chhabra |  |

Manual clinical coding is labour-intensive and error-prone, which has motivated research towards full automation of the process. However, our analysis, based on US English electronic health records and automated coding research using these records, shows that widely used evaluation methods are not aligned with real clinical contexts. For example, evaluations that focus on the top 50 most common codes are an oversimplification, as there are thousands of codes used in practice. This position paper aims to align AI coding research more closely with practical challenges of clinical coding. Based on our analysis, we offer eight specific recommendations, suggesting ways to improve current evaluation methods. Additionally, we propose new AI-based methods beyond automated coding, suggesting alternative approaches to assist clinical coders in their workflows. | Yidong Gan, Maciej Rybinski, Ben Hachey, Jonathan K.

However, traditional data-driven approaches struggle to detect new memes due to their evolving nature and the lack of up-to-date annotated data. To address this issue, we propose MIND, a multi-agent framework for zero-shot harmful meme detection that does not rely on annotated data. MIND implements three key strategies: 1) We retrieve similar memes from an unannotated reference set to provide contextual information. 2) We propose a bi-directional insight derivation mechanism to extract a comprehensive understanding of similar memes. 3) We then employ a multi-agent debate mechanism to ensure robust decision-making through reasoned arbitration. Extensive experiments on three meme datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework not only outperforms existing zero-shot approaches but also shows strong generalization across different model architectures and... | Ziyan Liu, Chunxiao Fan, Haoran Lou, Yuexin Wu, Kaiwei Deng |  |

However, existing benchmarks are predominantly static, failing to capture the evolving nature of LLMs and knowledge, leading to inaccuracies and vulnerabilities such as contamination. In this paper, we introduce EvoWiki, an evolving dataset designed to reflect knowledge evolution by categorizing information into stable, evolved, and uncharted states. EvoWiki is fully auto-updatable, enabling precise evaluation of continuously changing knowledge and newly released LLMs. Through experiments with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Continual Learning (CL), we evaluate how effectively LLMs adapt to evolving knowledge. Our results indicate that current models often struggle with evolved knowledge, frequently providing outdated or incorrect responses. Moreover, the dataset highlights a synergistic effect between RAG and CL,... | Wei Tang, Yixin Cao, Yang Deng, Jiahao Ying, Bo Wang, Yizhe Yang, Yuyue Zhao, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang, YuGang Jiang, Yong Liao |  |

However, the problem of repetitions during the generation process continues to linger. Previous work has primarily focused on content repetition, which is merely a fraction of the broader repetition problem in code generation. A more prevalent and challenging problem is structural repetition. In structural repetition, the repeated code appears in various patterns but possesses a fixed structure, which can be inherently reflected in grammar. In this paper, we formally define structural repetition and propose an efficient decoding approach called RPG, which stands for Repetition Penalization based on Grammar, to alleviate the repetition problems in code generation for LLMs. Specifically, RPG first leverages grammar rules to identify repetition problems during code generation, and then strategically decays the likelihood of critical tokens that contribute to repetitions, thereby... | Yihong Dong, Yuchen Liu, Xue Jiang, Bin Gu, Zhi Jin, Ge Li |  |

With the rapid development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), it is essential to assess their ability to effectively comprehend these punchlines. However, existing benchmarks on punchline comprehension suffer from three major limitations: 1) language shortcuts that allow models to solely rely on text, 2) lack of question diversity, and 3) narrow focus on a specific domain of multimodal content (e.g., cartoon). To address these limitations, we introduce a multimodal \*\*Punch\*\*line comprehension \*\*Bench\*\*mark, named \*\*PunchBench\*\*, which is tailored for accurate and comprehensive evaluation of punchline comprehension. To enhance the evaluation accuracy, we generate synonymous and antonymous captions by modifying original captions, which mitigates the impact of shortcuts in the captions.

In this paper, we introduce ProcessBench for measuring the ability to identify erroneous steps in mathematical reasoning. It consists of 3,400 test cases, primarily focused on competition- and Olympiad-level math problems. Each test case contains a step-by-step solution with error location annotated by human experts. Models are required to identify the earliest step that contains an error, or conclude that all steps are correct. We conduct extensive evaluation on ProcessBench, involving two types of models: process reward models (PRMs) and critic models, where for the latter we prompt general language models to critique each solution step by step. We draw two main observations: (1) Existing PRMs typically fail to generalize to more challenging math problems beyond GSM8K and MATH.

Motivated by the observation that alignment training typically involves only small parameter changes without injecting new knowledge into models, we propose a straightforward method called ExPO (model extrapolation) to expedite LLMs’ alignment with human preferences. Given a partially-trained model and its initial SFT checkpoint, ExPO improves the implicit optimization objective of alignment training by simply amplifying the parameter change based on a first-order approximation, without any additional training overhead. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate that ExPO boosts a DPO model trained with only 20% steps to outperform the fully-trained one. Moreover, we show that ExPO notably improves existing open-source LLMs (ranging from 1.8B to 70B parameters) on the... | Chujie Zheng, Ziqi Wang, Heng Ji, Minlie Huang, Nanyun Peng |  |

Nevertheless, the gap between the distribution of current datasets from human annotations or model generations and the real-world data distribution heavily limits the capacities and potentials of models. As a result, we propose a new SFT technique, ATLANTIS, to bridge the gap. We adopt importance sampling to estimate the optimal data distribution in the real world from existing training datasets because the former is hard to sample from. Furthermore, we introduce an extra small model and reference model to estimate the sampling ratio through the probability gap between them. We evaluate our method with benchmarks in knowledge & understanding and preference aspects. The experiment results prove that ATLANTIS can bring consistent and significant improvements to models’ performance. What’s more, our method can be flexibly transferred among models with different... | Yi Liu, Guoyin Wang, Shicheng Li, Feifan Song, Xu Sun |  |

Despite advances in using Large Language Models (LLMs), challenges persist due to hallucination-models generating plausible yet inaccurate content. Addressing these challenges, we introduce MPVStance, a framework that incorporates Multi-Perspective Verification (MPV) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) across a structured five-step verification process. Our method enhances stance detection by rigorously validating each response from factual accuracy, logical consistency, contextual relevance, and other perspectives. Extensive testing on the SemEval-2016 and VAST datasets, including scenarios that challenge existing methods and comprehensive ablation studies, demonstrates that MPVStance significantly outperforms current models. It effectively mitigates hallucination issues and sets new benchmarks for reliability and accuracy in stance detection,... | Zhaodan Zhang, Zhao Zhang, Jin Zhang, Hui Xu, Xueqi Cheng |  |

Inspired by research that links task-personality alignment with improved development outcomes, we conduct an empirical study on personality-guided code generation using large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we investigate how emulating personality traits appropriate to the coding tasks affects LLM performance. We extensively evaluate this approach using seven widely adopted LLMs across four representative datasets. Our results show that personality guidance significantly enhances code generation accuracy, with improved pass rates in 23 out of 28 LLM-dataset combinations. Notably, in 11 cases, the improvement exceeds 5%, and in 5 instances, it surpasses 10%, with the highest gain reaching 12.9%. Additionally, personality guidance can be easily integrated with other prompting strategies to further... | Yaoqi Guo, Zhenpeng Chen, Jie M. Zhang, Yang Liu, Yun Ma |  |

However, existing mental health LLMs overlook a critical issue where they do not consider the fact that different psychological counselors exhibit different personal styles, including linguistic style and therapy techniques, etc. As a result, these LLMs fail to satisfy the individual needs of clients who seek different counseling styles. To help bridge this gap, we propose PsyDT, a novel framework using LLMs to construct the Digital Twin of Psychological counselor with personalized counseling style. Compared to the time-consuming and costly approach of collecting a large number of real-world counseling cases to create a specific counselor’s digital twin, our framework offers a faster and more cost-effective solution. To construct PsyDT, we utilize dynamic one-shot learning by using GPT-4 to capture counselor’s unique counseling style, mainly focusing on linguistic style and... | Haojie Xie, Yirong Chen, Xiaofen Xing, Jingkai Lin, Xiangmin Xu |  |

However, these models still face challenges on constrained writing tasks like poem generation under open-domain titles via direct generation.In response to this challenge, we introduce Block Inverse Prompting (BIPro) constrained generation framework. BIPro leverages two block inverse prompting methods, revise and rewrite. This inference scaling approach mimics the process of human text writing using block generative models. It significantly improves the zero-shot generation quality on the constrained generation task of open-domain traditional-form Chinese poem generation. Based on a less powerful block generative model GLM-10B-Chinese, poems composed via BIPro without priming or additional training outperform both much larger direct generative systems like GPT-4 or GLM-4 and domain-specific systems such... | Xu Zou |  |

However, existing document understanding benchmarks have been limited to handling only a small number of pages and fail to provide a comprehensive analysis of layout elements locating. In this paper, we first define three primary task categories: Long Document Understanding, numerical Reasoning, and cross-element Locating, and then propose a comprehensive benchmark—LongDocURL—integrating above three primary tasks and comprising 20 sub-tasks categorized based on different primary tasks and answer evidences. Furthermore, we develop a semi-automated construction pipeline and collect 2,325 high-quality question-answering pairs, covering more than 33,000 pages of documents, significantly outperforming existing benchmarks.

Recently, solutions have been proposed to safeguard client privacy by obfuscation techniques. However, the solutions incur notable decline in model utility and mainly focus on classification tasks, rendering them impractical for real-world applications. Moreover, recent studies reveal that these obfuscation, if not well designed, is susceptible to embedding inversion attacks (EIAs). In this paper, we devise ObfusLM, a privacy-preserving MLaaS framework for both classification and generation tasks. ObfusLM leverages a model obfuscation module to achieve privacy protection for both classification and generation tasks. Based on (k, 𝜖)-anonymity, ObfusLM includes novel obfuscation algorithms to reach provable security against EIAs. Extensive experiments show that ObfusLM outperforms existing works in... | Yu Lin, Ruining Yang, Yunlong Mao, Qizhi Zhang, Jue Hong, Quanwei Cai, Ye Wu, Huiqi Liu, Zhiyu Chen, Bing Duan, Sheng Zhong |  |

Such a cooperative system suffers from suboptimal equilibrium minima due to the dominance of one of the two modules, a phenomenon known as interlocking. While several contributions aimed at addressing interlocking, they only mitigate its effect, often by introducing feature-based heuristics, sampling, and ad-hoc regularizations. We present GenSPP, the first interlocking-free architecture for selective rationalization that does not require any learning overhead, as the above-mentioned. GenSPP avoids interlocking by performing disjoint training of the generator and predictor via genetic global search. Experiments on a synthetic and a real-world benchmark show that our model outperforms several state-of-the-art competitors. | Federico Ruggeri, Gaetano Signorelli |  |

This de-identification is often done by masking all mentions of personally identifiable information (PII), thereby making it more difficult to uncover the identity of the person(s) in question. To investigate the robustness of de-identification methods, we present a novel, RAG-inspired approach that attempts the reverse process of re-identification based on a database of documents representing background knowledge. Given a text in which personal identifiers have been masked, the re-identification proceeds in two steps. A retriever first selects from the background knowledge passages deemed relevant for the re-identification. Those passages are then provided to an infilling model which seeks to infer the original content of each text span. This process is repeated until all masked spans are replaced. We evaluate the re-identification on three datasets (Wikipedia biographies, court rulings and... | Lucas Georges Gabriel Charpentier, Pierre Lison |  |

While metric learning methods have shown promise, they rely on deterministic point embeddings that fail to capture the inherent uncertainty in the input data, in which user intentions may be imprecisely specified or open to multiple interpretations. We address this challenge by reformulating CIR through our proposed Composed Probabilistic Embedding (CoPE) framework, which represents both queries and targets as Gaussian distributions in latent space rather than fixed points. Through careful design of probabilistic distance metrics and hierarchical learning objectives, CoPE explicitly captures uncertainty at both instance and feature levels, enabling more flexible, nuanced, and robust matching that can handle polysemy and ambiguity in search intentions. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that CoPE effectively quantifies both quality... | Haomiao Tang, Jinpeng Wang, Yuang Peng, Guanghao Meng, Ruisheng Luo, Bin Chen, Long Chen, Yaowei Wang, Shutao Xia |  |

However, training models to handle long contexts presents significant challenges. These include the scarcity of high-quality natural long-context data, the potential for performance degradation on short-context tasks, and the reduced training efficiency associated with attention mechanisms. In this paper, we introduce Untie the Knots (UtK), a novel data augmentation strategy employed during the continue pre-training phase, designed to efficiently enable LLMs to gain long-context capabilities without the need to modify the existing data mixture. In particular, we chunk the documents, shuffle the chunks, and create a complex and knotted structure of long texts; LLMs are then trained to untie these knots and identify relevant segments within seemingly chaotic token sequences. This approach greatly improves the model’s performance by accurately attending to... | Junfeng Tian, Da Zheng, Yang Chen, Rui Wang, Colin Zhang, Debing Zhang |  |

To address this challenge, we propose APPL, A Prompt Programming Language that acts as a bridge between computer programs and LLMs, allowing seamless embedding of prompts into Python functions, and vice versa. APPL provides an intuitive and Python-native syntax, an efficient parallelized runtime with asynchronous semantics, and a tracing module supporting effective failure diagnosis and replaying without extra costs. We demonstrate that APPL programs are intuitive, concise, and efficient through representative scenarios including Chain-of-Thought with self-consistency (CoT-SC) and ReAct tool-use agent. We further use LLMs to judge the language design between APPL and previous work, where the results... | Honghua Dong, Qidong Su, Yubo Gao, Zhaoyu Li, Yangjun Ruan, Gennady Pekhimenko, Chris J.

We validate the framework by analyzing the performance of a set of LMs of different sizes, in both mono- and multilingual configuration, across tasks involving the generation, definition, and contextual usage of lexicalized words, neologisms, and nonce words. To support these evaluations, we developed a novel dataset of lexical entries for the Italian language, including curated definitions and usage examples sourced from various online platforms. The results highlight the robustness and effectiveness of our framework in evaluating multiple dimensions of LMs’ linguistic understanding and offer an insight, through the assessment of their linguistic creativity, on the lexical generalization abilities of LMs. | Cristiano Ciaccio, Alessio Miaschi, Felice Dell'Orletta |  |

MELLE autoregressively generates continuous mel-spectrogram frames directly from text condition, bypassing the need for vector quantization, which is typically designed for audio compression and sacrifices fidelity compared to continuous representations. Specifically, (i) instead of cross-entropy loss, we apply regression loss with a proposed spectrogram flux loss function to model the probability distribution of the continuous-valued tokens; (ii) we have incorporated variational inference into MELLE to facilitate sampling mechanisms, thereby enhancing the output diversity and model robustness. Experiments demonstrate that, compared to the two-stage codec language model VALL-E and its variants, the single-stage MELLE mitigates robustness issues by avoiding the inherent flaws of sampling vector-quantized codes, achieves superior performance across multiple metrics,... | Lingwei Meng, Long Zhou, Shujie Liu, Sanyuan Chen, Bing Han, Shujie Hu, Yanqing Liu, Jinyu Li, Sheng Zhao, Xixin Wu, Helen M.

In contrast, for information extraction (IE), pre-training data, such as BIO-tagged sequences, are hard to scale up. We show that IE models can act as free riders on LLM resources by reframing next-token prediction into extraction for tokens already present in the context. Specifically, our proposed next tokens extraction (NTE) paradigm learns a versatile IE model, Cuckoo, with 102.6M extractive data converted from LLM’s pre-training and post-training data. Under the few-shot setting, Cuckoo adapts effectively to traditional and complex instruction-following IE with better performance than existing pre-trained IE models. As a free rider, Cuckoo can naturally evolve with the ongoing advancements in LLM data preparation, benefiting from improvements in LLM training pipelines without additional manual effort. | Letian Peng, Zilong Wang, Feng Yao, Jingbo Shang |  |

However, applying LoRA in federated learning environments, where data is distributed across multiple clients, presents unique challenges. Existing methods rely on traditional federated averaging of LoRA adapters, resulting in inexact updates. To address this, we propose Federated Exact LoRA, or FedEx-LoRA, which adds a residual error term to the pre-trained frozen weight matrix. Our approach achieves exact updates with minimal computational and communication overhead, preserving LoRA’s efficiency. We evaluate the method on various models across arithmetic reasoning, commonsense reasoning, natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks, showing consistent performance gains over state-of-the-art methods across multiple settings. Through extensive analysis, we quantify that the deviations in updates from the ideal solution are significant, highlighting the need for... | Raghav Singhal, Kaustubh Ponkshe, Praneeth Vepakomma |  |

In this paper, we evaluate the social biases encoded by transformers trained with the masked language modeling objective using proposed proxy functions within an iterative masking experiment to measure the quality of transformer models’ predictions and assess the preference of MLMs towards disadvantaged and advantaged groups. We find that all models encode concerning social biases. We compare bias estimations with those produced by other evaluation methods using benchmark datasets and assess their alignment with human annotated biases. We extend previous work by evaluating social biases introduced after retraining an MLM under the masked language modeling objective and find proposed measures produce more accurate and sensitive... | Rahul Zalkikar, Kanchan Chandra |  |

In this paper, we develop a novel task for classifying language that contains explicit or implicit mentions of the author’s self beliefs. We contribute a set of 2,000 human-annotated self beliefs, 100,000 LLM-labeled examples, and 10,000 surveyed self belief paragraphs. We then evaluate several encoder-based classifiers and training routines for this task. Our trained model, SelfAwareNet, achieved an AUC of 0.944, outperforming 0.839 from OpenAI’s state-of-the-art GPT-4o model. Using this model we derive data-driven categories of self beliefs and demonstrate their ability to predict valence, depression, anxiety, and stress. We release the resulting self belief classification model and annotated datasets for use in future research. | Siddharth Mangalik, Adithya V. Ganesan, Abigail B. Wheeler, Nicholas Kerry, Jeremy D. W.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities in topic discovery, their direct application to topic modeling suffers from issues such as incomplete topic coverage, misalignment of topics, and inefficiency. To address these limitations, we propose LLM-ITL, a novel LLM-in-the-loop framework that integrates LLMs with Neural Topic Models (NTMs). In LLM-ITL, global topics and document representations are learned through the NTM. Meanwhile, an LLM refines these topics using an Optimal Transport (OT)-based alignment objective, where the refinement is dynamically adjusted based on the LLM’s confidence in suggesting topical words for each set of input words. With the flexibility of being integrated into many existing NTMs, the proposed approach enhances the interpretability of topics while preserving the efficiency of NTMs in... | Xiaohao Yang, He Zhao, Weijie Xu, Yuanyuan Qi, Jueqing Lu, Dinh Phung, Lan Du |  |

However, measuring hallucination can be challenging, as having humans verify model generations on-the-fly is both expensive and time-consuming. In this work, we release HALoGEN, a comprehensive hallucination benchmark consisting of: (1) 10,923 prompts for generative models spanning nine domains including programming, scientific attribution, and summarization, and (2) automatic high-precision verifiers for each use case that decompose LLM generations into atomic units, and verify each unit against a high-quality knowledge source. We use this framework to evaluate ~150,000 generations from 14 language models, finding that even the best-performing models are riddled with hallucinations (sometimes up to 86% of generated atomic facts depending on the domain).... | Abhilasha Ravichander, Shrusti Ghela, David Wadden, Yejin Choi |  |

However, LLM-generated pseudo labels alone demonstrate poor performance compared to traditional detection methods, making their effective integration non-trivial. In this paper, we propose Global Label Propagation Network with LLM-based Pseudo Labeling (GLPN-LLM) for multimodal fake news detection, which integrates LLM capabilities via label propagation techniques. The global label propagation can utilize LLM-generated pseudo labels, enhancing prediction accuracy by propagating label information among all samples. For label propagation, a mask-based mechanism is designed to prevent label leakage during training by ensuring that training nodes do not propagate their own labels back to themselves. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that by synergizing LLMs with label propagation, our model achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines. | Shuguo Hu, Jun Hu, Huaiwen Zhang |  |

Guiding Language Model Extraction with Locality Reinforced Distillation](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.73/) |  | 0 | Model extraction attacks (MEAs) on large language models (LLMs) have received increasing attention in recent research. However, existing attack methods typically adapt the extraction strategies originally developed for deep neural networks (DNNs). They neglect the underlying inconsistency between the training tasks of MEA and LLM alignment, leading to suboptimal attack performance. To tackle this issue, we propose Locality Reinforced Distillation (LoRD), a novel model extraction algorithm specifically designed for LLMs. In particular, LoRD employs a newly defined policy-gradient-style training task that utilizes the responses of victim model as the signal to guide the crafting of preference for the local model. Theoretical analyses demonstrate that I) The convergence procedure of LoRD in model extraction is consistent with the alignment procedure of LLMs, and II) LoRD can reduce query complexity while mitigating watermark protection through our exploration-based stealing.

Prior research has exposed VLMs’ vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, where carefully crafted inputs can lead the model to produce content that violates ethical and legal standards. However, current jailbreak methods often fail against cutting-edge models such as GPT-4o. We attribute this to the over-exposure of harmful content and the absence of stealthy malicious guidance. In this work, we introduce a novel jailbreak framework: Multi-Modal Linkage (MML) Attack. Drawing inspiration from cryptography, MML employs an encryption-decryption process across text and image modalities to mitigate the over-exposure of malicious information. To covertly align the model’s output with harmful objectives, MML leverages a technique we term evil alignment, framing the attack within the narrative context of a video game development scenario.

Through systematic evaluation across arithmetic, domain-specific knowledge, and high-stakes medical decision tasks, we demonstrate that post-training aligned models often default to selecting invalid options, while base models exhibit improved refusal capabilities that scale with model size. Our analysis reveals that alignment techniques, though intended to enhance helpfulness, can inadvertently impair models’ reflective judgment–the ability to override default behaviors when faced with invalid options. We additionally conduct a parallel human study showing similar instruction-following biases, with implications for how these biases may propagate through human feedback datasets used in alignment. We provide extensive ablation studies examining the impact of model size, training... | Gracjan Góral, Emilia Wisnios, Piotr Sankowski, Pawel Budzianowski |  |

Selective SSMs are viewed as dual models, in which one trains in parallel on the entire sequence via an IO-aware parallel scan, and deploys in an autoregressive manner. We add a third view and show that such models can be viewed as attention-driven models. This new perspective enables us to empirically and theoretically compare the underlying mechanisms to that of the attention in transformers and allows us to peer inside the inner workings of the Mamba model with explainability methods. Our code is publicly available. | Ameen Ali, Itamar Zimerman, Lior Wolf |  |

Despite the overall superiority of the Decoder architecture, the gradually increasing Key-Value (KV) cache during inference has emerged as a primary efficiency bottleneck, both in aspects of memory consumption and data transfer bandwidth limitations. To address these challenges, we propose a paradigm called KV-Latent. By down-sampling the Key-Value vector dimensions into a latent space, we can significantly reduce the KV Cache footprint and improve inference speed, only with a small amount of extra training, less than 1% of pre-training takes. Besides, we enhanced the stability of Rotary Positional Embedding applied on lower-dimensional vectors by modifying its frequency sampling mechanism, avoiding noise introduced by higher frequencies while retaining position attenuation. Our experiments, including both models with Grouped Query Attention and those without,... | Luohe Shi, Zuchao Li, Lefei Zhang, Baoyuan Qi, Liu Guoming, Hai Zhao |  |

We propose LeanCode for code simplification to reduce training and prediction time, leveraging code contexts in utilizing attention scores to represent the tokens’ importance. We advocate for the selective removal of tokens based on the average context-aware attention scores rather than average scores across all inputs. LeanCode uses the attention scores of ‘CLS’ tokens within the encoder for classification tasks, such as code search. It also employs the encoder-decoder attention scores to determine token significance for sequence-to-sequence tasks like code summarization. Our evaluation shows LeanCode‘s superiority over the SOTAs DietCode and SlimCode, with improvements of 60% and 16% for code search, and 29% and 27% for code summarization, respectively. | Yan Wang, Ling Ding, Tien N.

Despite its fundamental significance, this ability remains underexplored due to the complexity of modeling infinite possible changes in an event and their associated distributions, coupled with the lack of benchmark data with situational transitions.

While prior studies demonstrate the promise of LLMs as error detectors, they overlook the presence of multiple valid solutions for a single MWP. Our preliminary analysis reveals a significant performance gap between conventional and alternative solutions in MWPs, a phenomenon we term conformity bias in this work. To mitigate this bias, we introduce the Ask-Before-Detect (AskBD) framework, which generates adaptive reference solutions using LLMs to enhance error detection. Experiments on 200 examples of GSM8K show that AskBD effectively mitigates bias and improves performance, especially when combined with reasoning-enhancing techniques like chain-of-thought prompting. | Hang Li, Tianlong Xu, Kaiqi Yang, Yucheng Chu, Yanling Chen, Yichi Song, Qingsong Wen, Hui Liu |  |

This suggests that recent popular false information from such sources can be easily identified due to its likely presence in pre-training/retrieval corpora or the emergence of salient, yet shallow, patterns in these datasets. Instead, we argue that a proper factuality evaluation dataset should test a model’s ability to reason about current events by retrieving and reading related evidence. To this end, we develop a novel pipeline that leverages natural language feedback from a RAG-based detector to iteratively modify real-time news into deceptive variants that challenge LLMs. Our iterative rewrite decreases the binary classification ROC-AUC by an absolute 17.5 percent for a strong RAG-based GPT-4o detector.

However, current training recipes often relying on datasets dominated by short annotations with minimal rationales. In this work, we show that training VLM on short answers leads to poor generalization on reasoning tasks that require more detailed explanations. To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage post-training strategy that extends the usage of short answer data for enhanced CoT reasoning. First, we augment short answers with CoT reasoning generated by GPT-4o, enhancing the VLM’s CoT capabilities through fine-tuning. Second, we leverage short answers as outcome rewards for reinforcement learning. Specifically, short answers are used as correctness indicators to construct positive (correct) and negative (incorrect) pairs from model-generated reasoning chains. These pairs are then used to calibrate the model’s reasoning via Direct Preference... | Ruohong Zhang, Bowen Zhang, Yanghao Li, Haotian Zhang, Zhiqing Sun, Zhe Gan, Yinfei Yang, Ruoming Pang, Yiming Yang |  |

We find that LLMs’ first-name gender representations correlate with real-world gender statistics associated with the name, and are influenced by the co-occurrence of stereotypically feminine or masculine occupations. Additionally, we study the influence of first-name gender representations on LLMs in a downstream occupation prediction task and their potential as an internal metric to identify extrinsic model biases. While feminine first-name embeddings often raise the probabilities for female-dominated jobs (and vice versa for male-dominated jobs), reliably using these internal gender representations for bias detection remains challenging. | Haozhe An, Connor Baumler, Abhilasha Sancheti, Rachel Rudinger |  |

However, the existing LLM inference pipeline operates as an opaque process without explicit separation between knowledge retrieval and reasoning steps, making the model’s decision-making process unclear and disorganized. Recent research has shown that this ambiguity will lead to issues such as knowledge forgetting, which significantly impact the reliability of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel language model inference paradigm that decomposes the complex inference process into two distinct and clear actions: (1) memory recall: which retrieves relevant knowledge in LLM, and (2) reasoning: which performs reasoning steps based on the recalled knowledge. To facilitate this decomposition, we introduce two special tokens memory and reason, guiding the model to distinguish between steps that require knowledge retrieval and those that... | Mingyu Jin, Weidi Luo, Sitao Cheng, Xinyi Wang, Wenyue Hua, Ruixiang Tang, William Yang Wang, Yongfeng Zhang |  |

However, current AM methods often focus on extracting attributes from unimodal text, underutilizing multimodal data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Multimodal Self-Correction Instruction Tuning (MSIT) to mine new potential attributes from both images and text with Multimodal Large Language Models. The tuning process involves two datasets: Attribute Generation Tuning Data (AGTD) and Chain-of-Thought Tuning Data (CTTD). AGTD is constructed utilizing in-context learning with a small set of seed attributes, aiding the MLLM in accurately extracting attribute-value pairs from multimodal information. To introduce explicit reasoning and improve the extraction in accuracy, we construct CTTD, which incorporates a structured 5-step reasoning process for self-correction. Finally, we employ a 3-stage inference process to filter out redundant... | Jiaqi Li, Yanming Li, Xiaoli Shen, Chuanyi Zhang, Guilin Qi, Sheng Bi |  |

Feature attribution methods aim to explain these predictions by identifying the contribution of each input feature. Faithfulness, often evaluated using the area over the perturbation curve (AOPC), reflects feature attributions’ accuracy in describing the internal mechanisms of deep neural networks. However, many studies rely on AOPC to compare faithfulness across different models, which we show can lead to false conclusions about models’ faithfulness. Specifically, we find that AOPC is sensitive to variations in the model, resulting in unreliable cross-model comparisons. Moreover, AOPC scores are difficult to interpret in isolation without knowing the model-specific lower and upper limits. To address these issues, we propose a normalization approach, Normalized AOPC (NAOPC), enabling consistent cross-model evaluations and more meaningful interpretation of individual scores. Our experiments demonstrate that this... | Joakim Edin, Andreas Geert Motzfeldt, Casper L. Christensen, Tuukka Ruotsalo, Lars Maaløe, Maria Maistro |  |

Despite recent progress in zero-shot VC, there remains considerable potential for improvements in speaker similarity and speech naturalness. Moreover, existing zero-shot VC systems struggle to fully reproduce paralinguistic information in highly expressive speech, such as breathing, crying, and emotional nuances, limiting their practical applicability. To address these issues, we propose Takin-VC, a novel expressive zero-shot VC framework via adaptive hybrid content encoding and memory-augmented context-aware timbre modeling. Specifically, we introduce an innovative hybrid content encoder that incorporates an adaptive fusion module, capable of effectively integrating quantized features of the pre-trained WavLM and HybridFormer in an implicit manner, so as to extract... | Yuguang Yang, Yu Pan, Jixun Yao, Xiang Zhang, Jianhao Ye, Hongbin Zhou, Lei Xie, Lei Ma, Jianjun Zhao |  |

However, this places a significant burden on token representations to encode all language-specific information, which may hinder language neutrality. To address this limitation, we propose Language-Script Aware Multilingual Pretraining (LangSAMP), a method that incorporates both language and script embeddings to enhance representation learning. Specifically, we integrate these embeddings into the output of the Transformer blocks before passing the final representations to the language modeling head for prediction. We apply LangSAMP to the continual pretraining of XLM-R on a highly multilingual corpus covering more than 500 languages. The resulting model consistently outperforms the baseline in zero-shot crosslingual transfer across diverse downstream tasks. Extensive analysis reveals that language and script embeddings capture language- and... | Yihong Liu, Haotian Ye, Chunlan Ma, Mingyang Wang, Hinrich Schütze |  |

To address these challenges, we propose RelationalCoder, which uniformly converts semi-structured tables into relational data, enabling smooth integration with the rich ecosystem of data processing and analytics tools. By leveraging SQL code, RelationalCoder prevents schema errors and markedly improves normalization quality across multiple relational tables.To address the challenge of large tables, we propose a new technique called Loop Reference Decoding (LRD): it identifies expandable groups—repeating regions of similar structure and semantics—and replicates each group using a concise loop over its repetitive region by referencing cell addresses, rather than regenerating each individual cell. This design substantially reduces output length from 𝒪(N × M)—proportional to the table’s height (N) and width (M)—to approximately 𝒪(K), where K is... | Haoyu Dong, Yue Hu, Huailiang Peng, Yanan Cao |  |

This study investigates the algorithmic fidelity of LLMs, i.e., the ability to replicate the socio-cultural context and nuanced opinions of human participants. Using open-ended survey data from the German Longitudinal Election Studies (GLES), we prompt different LLMs to generate synthetic public opinions reflective of German subpopulations by incorporating demographic features into the persona prompts. Our results show that Llama performs better than other LLMs at representing subpopulations, particularly when there is lower opinion diversity within those groups. Our findings further reveal that the LLM performs better for supporters of left-leaning parties like The Greens and The Left compared to other parties, and matches the least with the right-party AfD. Additionally, the inclusion or exclusion of specific variables in the prompts can significantly impact the models’... | Bolei Ma, Berk Yoztyurk, AnnaCarolina Haensch, Xinpeng Wang, Markus Herklotz, Frauke Kreuter, Barbara Plank, Matthias Aßenmacher |  |

However, existing benchmarks for video understanding often treat these properties separately or narrowly focus on specific aspects, overlooking the holistic nature of video content. To address this, we introduce TUNA, a temporal-oriented benchmark for fine-grained understanding on dense dynamic videos, with two complementary tasks: captioning and QA. Our TUNA features diverse video scenarios and dynamics, assisted by interpretable and robust evaluation criteria. We evaluate several leading models on our benchmark, providing fine-grained performance assessments across various dimensions. This evaluation reveals key challenges in video temporal understanding, such as limited action description, inadequate multi-subject understanding, and insensitivity to camera motion, offering valuable insights for improving video understanding... | Fanheng Kong, Jingyuan Zhang, Hongzhi Zhang, Shi Feng, Daling Wang, Linhao Yu, Xingguang Ji, Yu Tian, Victoria W., Fuzheng Zhang |  |

Existing prompt refinement methods, while effective, often suffer from semantic inconsistencies between refined and original prompts, and fail to maintain users’ real intent. To address these challenges, we propose a self-instructed in-context learning framework that generates reliable derived prompts, keeping semantic consistency with the original prompts. Specifically, our framework incorporates a reinforcement learning mechanism, enabling direct interaction with the response model during prompt generation to better align with human preferences. We then formulate the querying as an in-context learning task, combining responses from LLMs with derived prompts to create a contextual demonstration for the original prompt. This approach effectively enhances alignment, reduces semantic discrepancies, and activates the LLM’s in-context learning... | Zhuo Li, Yuhao Du, Jinpeng Hu, Xiang Wan, Anningzhe Gao |  |

However, due to the simplicity and convenience of providing feedback, users typically offer only basic binary signals, such as ‘thumbs-up’ or ‘thumbs-down’. Most existing alignment research, on the other hand, relies on preference-based approaches that require both positive and negative responses as a pair. We propose Binary Classifier Optimization (BCO), a technique that effectively aligns LLMs using only binary feedback. BCO trains a binary classifier, where the logit serves as an implicit reward, effectively minimizing the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) loss. We demonstrate that the binary cross-entropy loss employed in classifier training acts as an upper bound for the DPO loss. Additionally, a novel reward shift technique further minimizes the gap between the losses. We validate our methodology in two settings: first, on a paired preference dataset,... | Seungjae Jung, Gunsoo Han, Daniel Wontae Nam, KyoungWoon On |  |

It differs from existing TSQA benchmarks by avoiding web-searchable queries grounded in the real world. We present a series of time-sensitive event scenarios based on synthetically generated facts. It requires large language models (LLMs) to engage in genuine temporal reasoning without depending on the factual knowledge acquired during the pre-training phase. Our data generation framework enables on-demand generation of new samples, mitigating the risk of data leakage. We designed three types of time-sensitive questions to test LLMs’ temporal reasoning abilities over sequential and parallel event occurrences. Our evaluation of five LLMs on synthetic fact-based TSQA reveals mixed results: while they perform well on simpler subsets, their overall performance remains inferior as compared to real world fact-based TSQA. Error analysis indicates that LLMs face difficulties... | Md Nayem Uddin, Amir Saeidi, Divij Handa, Agastya Seth, Tran Cao Son, Eduardo Blanco, Steven R. Corman, Chitta Baral |  |

Despite the promising performance of large language models in general summarization, their application to nuanced aspect-based summaries remains under-explored. ReflectASP eases the exploration of open-aspect-based summarization (OABS), overcoming the limitations of current datasets and comes with ample human annotations. We benchmarked different types of zero-shot summarization methods and proposed two refinement methods to improve summaries, supported by both automatic and human manual evaluations. Additionally, we analyzed suggestions and revisions made during the refinement process, offering a fine-grained study of the editing strategies employed by these methods. We make our models, dataset, and all human evaluation results available at... | Yang Zhong, Diane J. Litman |  |

Particularly in low-andmiddle-income countries (LMICs) facing acute physician shortages and lack of specialists, LLMs offer a potentially scalable pathway to enhance healthcare access and reduce costs. However, their effectiveness in the Global South, especially across the African continent, remains to be established. In this work, we introduce AfriMed-QA , the first largescale Pan-African English multi-specialty medical Question-Answering (QA) dataset, 15,000 questions (open and closed-ended) sourced from over 60 medical schools across 16 countries, covering 32 medical specialties.

However, as LLMs advance, the risk of harmful outputs increases due to incorrect or malicious prompts. While current methods effectively address jailbreak risks, they share common limitations: 1) Judging harmful outputs from the prefill-level lacks utilization of the model’s decoding outputs, leading to relatively lower effectiveness and robustness. 2) Rejecting potentially harmful outputs based on a single evaluation can significantly impair the model’s helpfulness. To address the above issues, we examine LLMs’ capability to recognize harmful outputs, revealing and quantifying their proficiency in assessing the danger of previous tokens. Motivated by pilot experiment results, we design a robust defense mechanism at the decoding level. Our novel decoder-oriented, step-by-step defense architecture corrects the outputs of harmful queries directly rather than rejecting them outright.

While existing audio spatialization methods can generally map any available monaural audio to binaural audio signals, they often lack the flexible and interactive control needed in complex multi-object user-interactive environments. To address this, we propose a Text-guided Audio Spatialization (TAS) framework that utilizes diverse text prompts and evaluates our model from unified generation and comprehension perspectives. Due to the limited availability of high-quality, large-scale stereo data, we construct the SpatialTAS dataset, which encompasses 376,000 simulated binaural audio samples to facilitate the training of our model. Our model learns binaural differences guided by 3D spatial location and relative position prompts, enhanced with flipped-channel audio. Experimental results show that our model can generate high quality... | Tianrui Pan, Jie Liu, Zewen Huang, Jie Tang, Gangshan Wu |  |

This trend has spurred active research into quantization-aware PEFT techniques, aimed at maintaining model accuracy while minimizing memory overhead during both inference and training. Previous quantization-aware PEFT methods typically apply post-training quantiation (PTQ) to pre-trained LLMs, followed by PEFT to recover accuracy loss. Meanwhile, this approach has limitations in recovering the accuracy loss. In this paper, we propose L4Q, a method that integrates Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) with LoRA. By employing a memory-optimized layer design, L4Q significantly reduces QAT’s memory overhead, making its training cost comparable to LoRA, while preserving the... | Hyesung Jeon, Yulhwa Kim, JaeJoon Kim |  |

One practical objective for Arabic LLMs is to utilize Arabic-specific vocabulary in the tokenizer to accelerate decoding. However, using a different vocabulary often leads to degradation of the model’s learned knowledge, since many words become out-of-vocabulary (OOV) at the beginning of training. Inspired by the vocabulary learning during Second Language (Arabic) Acquisition for humans, the released AraLLaMA employs progressive vocabulary expansion, which is implemented by a modified BPE algorithm that progressively extends the Arabic subwords in its dynamic vocabulary during training, thereby balancing the OOV ratio at every stage. The ablation study demonstrated the effectiveness... | Jianqing Zhu, Huang Huang, Zhihang Lin, Juhao Liang, Zhengyang Tang, Khalid Almubarak, Mosen Alharthi, Bang An, Juncai He, Xiangbo Wu, Fei Yu, Junying Chen, Zhuoheng Ma, Yuhao Du, He Zhang, Saied Alshahrani, Emad A.

An Empirical Study of Long-Context Vulnerabilities in LLMs](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.101/) |  | 0 | We investigate long-context vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) through Many-Shot Jailbreaking (MSJ). Our experiments utilize context length of up to 128K tokens. Through comprehensive analysis with various many-shot attack settings with different instruction styles, shot density, topic, and format, we reveal that context length is the primary factor determining attack effectiveness. Critically, we find that successful attacks do not require carefully crafted harmful content. Even repetitive shots or random dummy text can circumvent model safety measures, suggesting fundamental limitations in long-context processing capabilities of LLMs. The safety behavior of well-aligned models becomes increasingly inconsistent with longer contexts. These findings highlight significant safety gaps in context expansion capabilities of LLMs, emphasizing the need for new safety mechanisms. | Sangyeop Kim, Yohan Lee, Yongwoo Song, Kimin Lee |  |

MMERC requires addressing emotional causes: contextual factors that influence emotions, alongside emotional evidence directly expressed in the target utterance. Existing methods primarily model general conversational dependencies, such as sequential utterance relationships or inter-speaker dynamics, but fall short in capturing diverse and detailed emotional causes, including emotional contagion, influences from others, and self-referenced or externally introduced events. To address these limitations, we propose the Evidence-Cause Attention Network for Multi-Modal Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ECERC). ECERC integrates emotional evidence with contextual causes through five stages: Evidence Gating extracts and refines emotional evidence across modalities; Cause Encoding captures causes from conversational... | Tao Zhang, Zhenhua Tan |  |

However, the complexity of compilation instruction search and error resolution makes automatic compilation challenging. Inspired by the success of LLM-based agents in various fields, we propose CompileAgent, the first LLM-based agent framework dedicated to repo-level compilation. CompileAgent integrates five tools and a flow-based agent strategy, enabling interaction with software artifacts for compilation instruction search and error resolution. To measure the effectiveness of our method, we design a public repo-level benchmark CompileAgentBench, and we also design two baselines for comparison by combining two compilation-friendly schemes. The performance on this benchmark shows that our method significantly improves the compilation success rate, ranging from 10% to 71%.

LLMs have also been used to label data, but recent work has shown that models perform poorly when prompted with sociodemographic attributes, suggesting limited inherent sociodemographic knowledge. Here, we ask whether LLMs can be trained to be accurate sociodemographic models of annotator variation. Using a curated dataset of five tasks with standardized sociodemographics, we show that models do improve in sociodemographic prompting when trained but that this performance gain is largely due to models learning annotator-specific behaviour rather than sociodemographic behaviours. Across all tasks, our results suggest that models learn little meaningful connection between sociodemographics and annotation, raising doubts about the current use of LLMs for simulating sociodemographic variation and behaviour. | Matthias Orlikowski, Jiaxin Pei, Paul Röttger, Philipp Cimiano, David Jurgens, Dirk Hovy |  |

Despite the pioneering research on task-level forgetting in LLM fine-tuning, there is scant focus on forgetting during pre-training. We systematically explored the existence and measurement of forgetting in pre-training, questioning traditional metrics such as perplexity (PPL) and introducing new metrics to better detect entity memory retention. Based on our revised assessment of forgetting metrics, we explored low-cost, straightforward methods to mitigate forgetting during the pre-training phase. In addition, we carefully analyzed the learning curves, offering insights into the dynamics of forgetting. Extensive evaluations and analyses on forgetting of pre-training could facilitate future research on LLMs. | Chonghua Liao, Ruobing Xie, Xingwu Sun, Haowen Sun, Zhanhui Kang |  |

While many studies have examined these biases, little work has explored their robustness during interactions. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach where two instances of an LLM engage in self-debate, arguing opposing viewpoints to persuade a neutral version of the model. Through this, we evaluate how firmly biases hold and whether models are susceptible to reinforcing misinformation or shifting to harmful viewpoints. Our experiments span multiple LLMs of varying sizes, origins, and languages, providing deeper insights into bias persistence and flexibility across linguistic and cultural contexts. | Virgile Rennard, Christos Xypolopoulos, Michalis Vazirgiannis |  |

Android agents, in particular, have been a frequently-mentioned interaction method. However, existing studies for training and evaluating Android agents lack systematic research on both open-source and closed-source models. In this work, we propose AndroidLab as a systematic Android agent framework. It includes an operation environment with different modalities, action space, and a reproducible benchmark. It supports both large language models (LLMs) and multimodal models (LMMs) in the same action space. AndroidLab benchmark includes predefined Android virtual devices and 138 tasks across nine apps built on these devices. By using the AndroidLab environment, we develop an Android Instruction dataset and train six open-source LLMs and LMMs, lifting the average success rates from 4.59% to 21.50% for LLMs and from 1.93% to 13.28% for LMMs. AndroidLab is open-sourced and publicly available at... | Yifan Xu, Xiao Liu, Xueqiao Sun, Siyi Cheng, Hao Yu, Hanyu Lai, Shudan Zhang, Dan Zhang, Jie Tang, Yuxiao Dong |  |

As such, they are subject to curse of multilinguality, a loss of monolingual representational accuracy due to parameter sharing. Another limitation of MSEs is the trade-off between different task performance: cross-lingual alignment training distorts the optimal monolingual structure of semantic spaces of individual languages, harming the utility of sentence embeddings in monolingual tasks; cross-lingual tasks, such as cross-lingual semantic similarity and zero-shot transfer for sentence classification, may also require conflicting cross-lingual alignment strategies. In this work, we address both issues by means of modular training of sentence encoders. We first train language-specific monolingual modules to mitigate negative interference between languages (i.e., the curse). We then align all non-English sentence... | Yongxin Huang, Kexin Wang, Goran Glavas, Iryna Gurevych |  |

The central challenge in MSA is multimodal fusion, which is predominantly addressed by Multimodal Transformers (MulTs). Although act as the paradigm, MulTs suffer from efficiency concerns. In this work, from the perspective of efficiency optimization, we propose and prove that MulTs are hierarchical modal-wise heterogeneous graphs (HMHGs), and we introduce the graph-structured representation pattern of MulTs. Based on this pattern, we propose an Interlaced Mask (IM) mechanism to design the Graph-Structured and Interlaced-Masked Multimodal Transformer (GsiT). It is formally equivalent to MulTs which achieves an efficient weight-sharing mechanism without information disorder through IM, enabling All-Modal-In-One fusion with only 1/3 of the parameters of pure MulTs.

Systematic Evaluation and Rethinking](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.110/) |  | 0 | Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in text generation within current NLP research. However, the lack of factual accuracy is still a dark cloud hanging over the LLM skyscraper. Structural knowledge prompting (SKP) is a prominent paradigm to integrate external knowledge into LLMs by incorporating structural representations, achieving state-of-the-art results in many knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing methods often focus on specific problems, lacking a comprehensive exploration of the generalization and capability boundaries of SKP. This paper aims to evaluate and rethink the generalization capability of the SKP paradigm from four perspectives including Granularity, Transferability, Scalability, and Universality. To provide a thorough evaluation, we introduce a novel multi-granular, multi-level benchmark called SUBARU, consisting of 9 different tasks with varying levels of granularity and difficulty.

With Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) like BERT and DeBERTa now well established, significant progress has been made in understanding contextual semantics. Nevertheless, how well these models inherently disambiguate word senses remains uncertain. In this work, we evaluate several encoder-only PLMs across two popular inventories (i.e. WordNet and the Oxford Dictionary of English) by analyzing their ability to separate word senses without any task-specific fine-tuning. We compute centroids of word senses and measure similarity to assess performance across different layers. Our results show that DeBERTa-v3 delivers the best performance on the task, with the middle layers (specifically the 7th and 8th layers) achieving the highest accuracy, outperforming the output layer by approximately 15 percentage points.

In this paper, we move beyond attacking LLMs and instead examine backdoor attacks through the novel lens of natural language explanations. Specifically, we leverage LLMs’ generative capabilities to produce human-readable explanations for their decisions, enabling direct comparisons between explanations for clean and poisoned samples. Our results show that backdoored models produce coherent explanations for clean inputs but diverse and logically flawed explanations for poisoned data, a pattern consistent across classification and generation tasks for different backdoor attacks. Further analysis reveals key insights into the explanation generation process. At the token level, explanation tokens associated with poisoned samples only appear in the final few transformer layers. At the sentence level, attention dynamics indicate that... | Huaizhi Ge, Yiming Li, Qifan Wang, Yongfeng Zhang, Ruixiang Tang |  |

However, due to systematic biases in evaluation datasets, the real-world effectiveness of these models remains unclear, particularly across geographies. We introduce HateDay, the first global hate speech dataset representative of social media settings, constructed from a random sample of all tweets posted on September 21, 2022 and covering eight languages and four English-speaking countries. Using HateDay, we uncover substantial variation in the prevalence and composition of hate speech across languages and regions. We show that evaluations on academic datasets greatly overestimate real-world detection performance, which we find is very low, especially for non-European languages.

While prior works typically focuses on optimizing model efficiency or improving performance without considering resource constraints, we instead identify optimal model configuration under fixed inference compute budgets. We conduct large-scale training sweeps and careful parametric modeling of task performance to identify the inference compute-optimal frontier. Our experiments reveal how task performance depends on scaling factors and finetuning data size, as well as how changes in data size shift the compute-optimal frontier. These findings translate to practical tips for selecting these scaling factors. | Peiqi Wang, ShengYun Peng, Xuewen Zhang, Hanchao Yu, Yibo Yang, Lifu Huang, Fujun Liu, Qifan Wang |  |

Typically alignment requires fine-tuning a model, which is computationally expensive, and sizable language data, which often may not be available. A data-efficient alternative to fine-tuning is model interventions — a method for manipulating model activations to steer generation into the desired direction. We analyze the effect of a popular intervention (finding experts) on the alignment of cross-lingual representations in mLLMs. We identify the neurons to manipulate for a given language and introspect the embedding space of mLLMs pre- and post-manipulation. We show that modifying the mLLM’s activations changes its embedding space such that cross-lingual alignment is enhanced. Further, we show that the changes to the embedding space translate into improved downstream performance on retrieval tasks, with up to 2x... | Anirudh Sundar, Sinead Williamson, Katherine Metcalf, BarryJohn Theobald, Skyler Seto, Masha Fedzechkina |  |

This study investigates how search engines like Google selectively promotes or suppresses certain hashtags and subreddits, impacting the information users encounter. By comparing search engine results with nonsampled data from Reddit and Twitter/X, we reveal systematic biases in content visibility. Google’s algorithms tend to suppress subreddits and hashtags related to sexually explicit material, conspiracy theories, advertisements, and cryptocurrencies, while promoting content associated with higher engagement. These findings suggest that Google’s gatekeeping practices influence public discourse by curating the social media narratives available to users. | Amrit Poudel, Yifan Ding, Tim Weninger, Jürgen Pfeffer |  |

We introduce forePLay, a novel Polish-language dataset for erotic content detection, comprising over 24,000 annotated sentences. The dataset features a multidimensional taxonomy that captures ambiguity, violence, and socially unacceptable behaviors. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that specialized Polish language models achieve superior performance compared to multilingual alternatives, with transformer-based architectures showing particular strength in handling imbalanced categories. The dataset and accompanying analysis establish essential frameworks for developing linguistically-aware content moderation systems, while highlighting critical considerations for extending such capabilities to morphologically complex languages. | Anna Kolos, Katarzyna Lorenc, Emilia Wisnios, Agnieszka Karlinska |  |

While large conversational models may be tricked into answering psychometric questionnaires, the latent psychological constructs of thousands of simpler transformers, trained for other tasks, cannot be assessed because appropriate psychometric methods are currently lacking. Here, we show how standard psychological questionnaires can be reformulated into natural language inference prompts, and we provide a code library to support the psychometric assessment of arbitrary models. We demonstrate, using a sample of 88 publicly available models, the existence of human-like mental health-related constructs—including anxiety, depression, and the sense of coherence—which conform with standard theories in human psychology and show similar correlations and mitigation strategies.

In this paper, we revisit this insight in light of recent multilingual MT models and large language models (LLMs) applied to machine translation. Somewhat surprisingly, we show through controlled experiments that these models are far more robust to many kinds of noise than previous models, even when they perform similarly on clean data. This is notable because, even though LLMs have more parameters and more complex training processes than past models, none of the open ones we consider use any techniques specifically designed to encourage robustness. Next, we show that similar trends hold for social media translation experiments – LLMs are more robust to social media text. We include an analysis of the circumstances in which source correction techniques... | Ben Peters, André F. T. Martins |  |

This limits their suitability for long token horizon training, such as 15T tokens for Llama 3.1. In this paper, we show how to achieve better trade-offs between accuracy and data quantity by a combination of classifier ensembling, synthetic data rephrasing, and reduced reliance on heuristic filters. When training 8B parameter models for 1T tokens, using a high-quality subset of our data improves MMLU by 5.6 over DCLM, demonstrating the efficacy of our methods for boosting accuracies over a relatively short token horizon. Furthermore, our full 6.3T token dataset matches DCLM on MMLU, but contains four times more unique real tokens than DCLM. This unlocks state-of-the-art training over a long token horizon: an 8B parameter model trained for 15T tokens, of which 7.2T came from our dataset, is better than the... | Dan Su, Kezhi Kong, Ying Lin, Joseph Jennings, Brandon Norick, Markus Kliegl, Mostofa Patwary, Mohammad Shoeybi, Bryan Catanzaro |  |

However, current methods often scale poorly, rely on opaque similarity metrics, and struggle in multilingual settings. In this work, we present a novel, scalable, interpretable, hierarchical, and multilingual approach to clustering news articles and social media data. To do this, we first train multilingual Matryoshka embeddings that can determine story similarity at varying levels of granularity based on which subset of the dimensions of the embeddings is examined. This embedding model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SemEval 2022 Task 8 test dataset (Pearson 𝜌 = 0.816). Once trained, we develop an efficient hierarchical clustering algorithm that leverages the hierarchical nature of Matryoshka embeddings to identify unique news stories, narratives, and themes. We conclude by illustrating how our approach can identify and cluster stories, narratives, and overarching... | Hans William Alexander Hanley, Zakir Durumeric |  |

We propose a novel framework for implicit knowledge editing and controlled text generation by fine-tuning LLMs with a prototype-based contrastive perplexity objective. Central to our method is the construction of hard negatives—toxic outputs that are generated through adversarial paraphrasing to be semantically similar and model probability to their non-toxic counterparts. By training on these challenging and realistic pairs, our approach ensures robust and stable contrastive optimization. Experimental results in the domain of detoxification demonstrate that our method significantly reduces toxic generation while maintaining strong performance on downstream tasks such as commonsense reasoning and reading comprehension. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of exploiting hard negatives for attribute-aware fine-tuning. | Tassilo Klein, Moin Nabi |  |

Despite this progress, the field currently encounters two main challenges: (1) the lack of a comprehensive LLM agent framework adaptable to a variety of financial tasks, and (2) the absence of standardized benchmarks and consistent datasets for assessing agent performance. To tackle these issues, we introduce InvestorBench, the first benchmark specifically designed for evaluating LLM-based agents in diverse financial decision-making contexts. InvestorBench enhances the versatility of LLM-enabled agents by providing a comprehensive suite of tasks applicable to different financial products, including single equities like stocks and cryptocurrencies, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Additionally, we assess the reasoning and decision-making capabilities of our agent framework using thirteen different LLMs as backbone models, across various market environments and... | Haohang Li, Yupeng Cao, Yangyang Yu, Shashidhar Reddy Javaji, Zhiyang Deng, Yueru He, Yuechen Jiang, Zining Zhu, K.

Despite being the workhorse of numerous production pipelines, there have been limited Pareto improvements to BERT since its release. In this paper, we introduce ModernBERT, bringing modern model optimizations to encoder-only models and representing a major Pareto improvement over older encoders. Trained on 2 trillion tokens with a native 8192 sequence length, ModernBERT models exhibit state-of-the-art results on a large pool of evaluations encompassing diverse classification tasks and both single and multi-vector retrieval on different domains (including code). In addition to strong downstream performance, ModernBERT is also the most speed and memory efficient encoder and is designed for inference on common GPUs. | Benjamin Warner, Antoine Chaffin, Benjamin Clavié, Orion Weller, Oskar Hallström, Said Taghadouini, Alexis Gallagher, Raja Biswas, Faisal Ladhak, Tom Aarsen, Griffin Thomas Adams, Jeremy Howard, Iacopo Poli |  |

While previous studies primarily focus on binary gender distinctions, we introduce the Gender Inclusivity Fairness Index (GIFI), a novel and comprehensive metric that quantifies the diverse gender inclusivity of LLMs. GIFI consists of a wide range of evaluations at different levels, from simply probing the model with respect to provided gender pronouns to testing various aspects of model generation and cognitive behaviors under different gender assumptions, revealing biases associated with varying gender identifiers. We conduct extensive evaluations with GIFI on 22 prominent open-source and proprietary LLMs of varying sizes and capabilities, discovering significant variations in LLMs’ gender inclusivity. Our study highlights the importance of improving LLMs’ inclusivity, providing a critical benchmark for future advancements... | Zhengyang Shan, Emily Diana, Jiawei Zhou |  |

It’s well-established that ICL heavily relies on selecting effective demonstrations to achieve outputs that better align with the expected results. As for demonstration selection, previous approaches have typically relied on intuitive metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of demonstrations, which often results in limited robustness and poor cross-model generalization capabilities. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel method, \*\*D\*\*emonstration \*\*Va\*\*lidation (\*\*D.Va\*\*), which integrates a demonstration validation perspective into this field. By introducing the demonstration validation mechanism, our method effectively identifies demonstrations that are both effective and highly generalizable. \*\*D.Va\*\* surpasses all existing retrieval-based in-context learning techniques across both natural language understanding (NLU)... | Qi Zhang, Zhiqing Xiao, Ruixuan Xiao, Lirong Gao, Junbo Zhao |  |

Do unified models truly achieve cross-modal coherence, or is this coherence merely perceived? To explore this, we introduce ACON, a dataset of 1,000 images (500 newly contributed) paired with captions, editing instructions, and Q&A pairs to evaluate cross-modal transfers rigorously. Using three consistency criteria—cyclic consistency, forward equivariance, and conjugated equivariance—our experiments reveal that any-to-any models do not consistently demonstrate greater cross-modal consistency than specialized models in pointwise evaluations such as cyclic consistency. However, equivariance evaluations uncover weak but observable consistency through structured analyses of the intermediate latent space enabled by multiple editing operations.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this issue by incorporating external, real-time information retrieval to ground LLM responses. However, the existing RAG systems frequently struggle with the quality of retrieval documents, as irrelevant or noisy documents degrade performance, increase computational overhead, and undermine response reliability. To tackle this problem, we propose Multi-Agent Filtering Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MAIN-RAG), a training-free RAG framework that leverages multiple LLM agents to collaboratively filter and score retrieved documents. Specifically, MAIN-RAG introduces an adaptive filtering mechanism that dynamically adjusts the relevance filtering threshold based on score distributions, effectively minimizing noise while maintaining high recall of relevant documents.

Recent learning-based demonstration selection methods have proven beneficial to ICL by choosing more useful exemplars. While these methods generally assume they learn better similarity measurements between exemplars and test cases from the proxy task, what kinds of similarities are captured by them and are vital to performing ICL still need to be explored. To dive into this question, we analyze the working mechanism of learning-based demonstration selection methods and empirically identify two essential factors of their similarity measurements: 1) Integrating task-agnostic similarities of different levels between the input of exemplars and test cases; 2) Incorporating task-specific similarity between the output of exemplars and test cases. We validate these two findings through extensive quantitative analysis across ten datasets and various LLMs.... | Hui Liu, Wenya Wang, Hao Sun, Chris Xing Tian, Chenqi Kong, Xin Dong, Haoliang Li |  |

Existing methods attempt to address these by constraining the search space and adopting greedy, incremental improvements, but they often fail to fully leverage historical gradient information. In this paper, we model the prompt optimization problem by the probability distribution of the prompt and present a novel approach that integrates greedy strategies into optimization with continuous representations. This approach can exploit historical gradient information to address the instability caused by rounding in existing methods. Our study indicates that using continuous representations can improve prompt optimization performance on both text classification and attack tasks, as well as models, including GPT-2, OPT, Vicuna, and... | Yangkun Wang, Zihan Wang, Jingbo Shang |  |

Techniques like in-context learning and fine-tuning have improved overall summary quality orthogonally, without considering the above issue. Conversely, methods aimed at improving faithfulness and informativeness, such as model reasoning and self improvement, have not been systematically evaluated in the clinical domain. We address this gap by first performing a comprehensive benchmark and study of six advanced abstractive summarization methods across three datasets using five reference-based and reference-free metrics, with the latter specifically assessing faithfulness and informativeness. Based on its findings we then develop uMedSum, a modular hybrid framework introducing novel approaches for sequential confabulation removal and key information addition.

Traditional speech models generally depend on a large amount of labeled training data, which is scarce for low-resource languages. This paper presents GigaSpeech 2, a large-scale, multi-domain, multilingual speech recognition corpus. It is designed for low-resource languages and does not rely on paired speech and text data. GigaSpeech 2 comprises about 30,000 hours of automatically transcribed speech, including Thai, Indonesian, and Vietnamese, gathered from unlabeled YouTube videos. We also introduce an automated pipeline for data crawling, transcription, and label refinement. Specifically, this pipeline involves Whisper for initial transcription, MMS for forced alignment, and multi-dimensional filtering for data quality assurance. A modified Noisy Student Training is developed to further refine flawed pseudo labels iteratively, thereby enhancing model performance.

Researchers have analyzed users’ past messages to track the evolution of sentiments and reconstruct sentiment dynamics. However, predicting the imminent sentiment response of users to ongoing events remains understudied. In this paper, we address the problem of sentiment forecasting on social media to predict users’ future sentiment based on event developments. We extract sentiment-related features to enhance modeling and propose a multi-perspective role-playing framework to simulate human response processes. Our preliminary results show significant improvements in sentiment forecasting at both microscopic and macroscopic levels. | Fanhang Man, Huandong Wang, Jianjie Fang, Zhaoyi Deng, Baining Zhao, Xinlei Chen, Yong Li |  |

However, existing methods encounter two significant challenges: reliance on extensive manually annotated datasets and limited generalization capability to unseen examples. To tackle these issues, we propose Targeted Synthetic Data Generation (Targa), a practical framework that dynamically generates high-relevance synthetic data without manual annotation. Starting from the pertinent entity and relation of a given question, we probe for the potential relevant queries through layer-wise expansion and cross-layer combination. Then, we generate corresponding natural language questions for these constructed queries to jointly serve as the synthetic demonstration for in-context learning. Experiments on multiple knowledge-based question answering (KBQA) datasets demonstrate that Targa, using only a 7B-parameter model, substantially outperforms existing... | Xiang Huang, Jiayu Shen, Shanshan Huang, Sitao Cheng, Xiaxia Wang, Yuzhong Qu |  |

Despite their potential, LLMs have yet to be widely used as agents on real mobile devices. The main challenge is the need for high-quality data sources. Time constraints and labor intensity often hinder human annotation. On the other hand, existing LLMs exhibit inadequate completion rates and need a robust data filtration strategy. Given these challenges, we develop a framework called AndroidGen to enhance the capabilities of LLM-based agents under data scarcity. In addition, we leverage AndroidGen to collect trajectories given human tasks and train open-source LLMs on these trajectories to develop an open-source mobile agent without manually labeled trajectories. We extensively evaluate AndroidGen with AndroidWorld, AitW, and various popular applications, demonstrating its improvements and revealing potential areas for future improvement.

However, existing methods mostly adopt an aggressive strategy by prompting LLM to determine a single gold label for each unlabeled sample. Due to the inherent uncertainty within LLMs, they often produce incorrect labels for difficult samples, severely compromising the data quality for downstream applications. Motivated by ambiguity aversion in human behaviors, we propose a novel candidate annotation paradigm wherein large language models are encouraged to output all possible labels when incurring uncertainty. To ensure unique labels are provided for downstream tasks, we develop a teacher-student framework CanDist that distills candidate annotations with a Small Language Model (SLM). We further provide a rigorous justification demonstrating that distilling candidate annotations from the teacher LLM offers superior... | Mingxuan Xia, Haobo Wang, Yixuan Li, Zewei Yu, Jindong Wang, Junbo Zhao, Runze Wu |  |

However, with the exhaustion of high-quality internet corpora and increasing computational demands, the sustainability of pre-training scaling needs to be addressed. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of post-training scaling, an emergent paradigm aiming to relieve the limitations of traditional pre-training by focusing on the alignment phase, which traditionally accounts for a minor fraction of the total training computation. Our survey categorizes post-training scaling into three key methodologies: Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT), Reinforcement Learning from Feedback (RLxF), and Test-time Compute (TTC).

A circuit is a minimal subgraph of a model’s computation graph that executes a specific task. We identify a gap in existing circuit discovery methods: they assume circuits are position-invariant, treating model components as equally relevant across input positions. This limits their ability to capture cross-positional interactions or mechanisms that vary across positions. To address this gap, we propose two improvements to incorporate positionality into circuits, even on tasks containing variable-length examples. First, we extend edge attribution patching, a gradient-based method for circuit discovery, to differentiate between token positions. Second, we introduce the concept of a dataset schema, which defines token spans with similar semantics across examples, enabling position-aware circuit discovery in datasets with variable length examples. We additionally develop an automated pipeline... | Tal Haklay, Hadas Orgad, David Bau, Aaron Mueller, Yonatan Belinkov |  |

Nevertheless, traditional multimodel fusion approaches, which are mainly designed for triple facts under either entity-centric or relation-guided fusion schemes, fail to integrate the multimodal information with the rich context of the hyper-relational fact consisting of multiple entities and relations. Against this background, we propose \*\*HyperFM\*\*, a \*\*Hyper\*\*-relational \*\*F\*\*act-centric \*\*M\*\*ultimodal Fusion technique.

Existing efforts mitigate these issues by adding multilingual training data, but do so in a largely ad-hoc manner, lacking insight into how different training mixes tip the scale for different groups of languages. In this work, we present a comprehensive investigation into the training strategies for massively multilingual LVLMs. First, we conduct a series of multi-stage experiments spanning 13 downstream vision-language tasks and 43 languages, systematically examining: (1) the number of training languages that can be included without degrading English performance and (2) optimal language distributions of pre-training as well as (3) instruction-tuning data. Further, we (4) investigate how to improve multilingual text-in-image understanding, and introduce a new benchmark for the... | Gregor Geigle, Florian Schneider, Carolin Holtermann, Chris Biemann, Radu Timofte, Anne Lauscher, Goran Glavas |  |

This work enhances such models by improving their inference and evaluation capabilities with minimal or no additional training. Focusing on molecule caption generation, we explore post-training synergies between alignment fine-tuning and model merging in a cross-modal setup. We reveal intriguing insights into the behaviour and suitability of such methods while significantly surpassing state-of-the-art models. Moreover, we propose a novel atomic-level evaluation method leveraging off-the-shelf Natural Language Inference (NLI) models for use in the unseen chemical domain. Our experiments demonstrate that our evaluation operates at the right level of granularity, effectively handling multiple content units and subsentence reasoning, while widely adopted NLI methods consistently misalign with assessment criteria. | Dimitris Gkoumas, Maria Liakata |  |

While watermarks already exist for LLMs, they often lack flexibility and struggle with attacks such as paraphrasing. To address these issues, we propose a multi-feature method for generating watermarks that combines multiple distinct watermark features into an ensemble watermark. Concretely, we combine acrostica and sensorimotor norms with the established red-green watermark to achieve a 98% detection rate. After a paraphrasing attack, the performance remains high with 95% detection rate. In comparison, the red-green feature alone as a baseline achieves a detection rate of 49% after paraphrasing. The evaluation of all feature combinations reveals that the ensemble of all three consistently has the highest detection rate across several LLMs and watermark strength settings. Due to the flexibility of combining features in the ensemble,... | Georg Niess, Roman Kern |  |

In contrast, here we exploit the capabilities of MLLMs in following non-textual instruction, i.e., an adversarial image or audio, namely Con Instruction. It is a novel gray-box attack method that generates adversarial images or audio to convey specific harmful instructions to MLLMs. We also find that combining our adversarial examples with certain non-empty text inputs amplifies attack success, while appending these after malicious text has limited effects. To evaluate whether an attack is successful, we introduce a new attack response categorization (ARC) that considers the response quality and relevancy concerning the malicious instruction. The results show that Con Instruction effectively bypasses the safety mechanisms in various visual and audio-language models, including... | Jiahui Geng, Thy Thy Tran, Preslav Nakov, Iryna Gurevych |  |

Existing methods for fine-tuning LLM-as-a-judge use cross-entropy (CE) loss, which neglects the numeric nature of score prediction. Recent work addresses numerical prediction limitations of LLM fine-tuning through regression-aware fine-tuning but does not consider chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for score prediction. In this paper, we introduce TRACT (Two-stage Regression-Aware fine-tuning with CoT), which combines CoT reasoning with regression-aware training. TRACT uses a two-stage process: first, it fine-tunes the seed LLM to generate CoTs, which serve as the training data for the second stage; next, it uses these self-generated CoTs to retrain the seed LLM. The fine-tuning objective of TRACT applies CE loss for CoT reasoning and regression-aware loss for the score.

However, existing dynamic RAG methods face significant limitations in two key aspects: 1) Lack of an effective mechanism to control retrieval triggers, and 2) Lack of effective scrutiny of retrieval content. To address these limitations, we propose an innovative dynamic RAG method, DioR (Adaptive Cognitive Detection and Contextual Retrieval Optimization), which consists of two main components: adaptive cognitive detection and contextual retrieval optimization, specifically designed to determine when retrieval is needed and what to retrieve for LLMs is useful. Experimental results demonstrate that DioR achieves superior performance on all tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our work. | Hanghui Guo, Jia Zhu, Shimin Di, Weijie Shi, Zhangze Chen, Jiajie Xu |  |

However, high estimated probability does not always lead to high translation quality. Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding offers an alternative by seeking hypotheses with the highest expected utility.Inspired by Quality Estimation (QE) reranking which uses the QE model as a ranker, we propose source-based MBR (sMBR) decoding, a novel approach that utilizes quasi-sources (generated via paraphrasing or back-translation) as “support hypotheses” and a reference-free quality estimation metric as the utility function, marking the first work to solely use sources in MBR decoding. Experiments show that sMBR outperforms QE reranking and the standard MBR decoding. Our findings suggest that sMBR is a promising approach for NMT decoding. | Boxuan Lyu, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Kotaro Funakoshi, Manabu Okumura |  |

However, progress has been hindered by a lack of reliable evaluation datasets. To address this, we present ToolHop, a dataset comprising 995 user queries and 3,912 associated tools, specifically designed for rigorous evaluation of multi-hop tool use. ToolHop ensures diverse queries, meaningful interdependencies, locally executable tools, detailed feedback, and verifiable answers through a novel query-driven data construction approach that includes tool creation, document refinement, and code generation. We evaluate 14 LLMs across five model families (i.e., LLaMA3.1, Qwen2.5, Gemini1.5, Claude3.5, and GPT), uncovering significant challenges in handling multi-hop tool-use scenarios. The leading model, GPT-4o, achieves an accuracy of 49.04%, underscoring substantial room for improvement.

Recent studies show that reasoning abilities contribute significantly to model safety, while integrating Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures can further enhance alignment.In this work, we address a fundamental question:How to effectively incorporate reasoning abilitiesand MoE architectures into self-alignment processin LLMs?We propose Mixture of insighTful Experts (MoTE), a novel framework that synergistically combines reasoning chains and expert mixtures to improve self-alignments.From a data perspective, MoTE employs a structured reasoning chain comprising four key stages: Question Analysis, Answer Guidance, Safe Answer, and Safety Checking. This approach enhances safety through multi-step reasoning and proves effective even for smaller and less powerful LLMs (e.g., 7B models). From an architectural perspective, MoTE adopts a multi-LoRA... | Zhili Liu, Yunhao Gou, Kai Chen, Lanqing Hong, Jiahui Gao, Fei Mi, Yu Zhang, Zhenguo Li, Xin Jiang, Qun Liu, James T. Kwok |  |

Despite their effectiveness, existing approaches typically assume that users’ query fully captures their real motivation. However, our analysis of a real-world e-commerce platform reveals that users often engage in relevant consultations before searching, indicating they refine intents through consultations based on motivation and need. The implied motivation in consultations is a key enhancing factor for personalized search. This unexplored area comes with new challenges including aligning contextual motivations with concise queries, bridging the category-text gap, and filtering noise within sequence history. To address these, we propose a Motivation-Aware Personalized Search (MAPS) method. It embeds queries and consultations into a unified semantic space via LLMs, utilizes a Mixture of Attention Experts (MoAE) to prioritize critical semantics, and introduces dual alignment:... | Weicong Qin, Yi Xu, Weijie Yu, Chenglei Shen, Ming He, Jianping Fan, Xiao Zhang, Jun Xu |  |

However, when it comes to logical reasoning tasks, significant challenges remain in both efficacy and efficiency. This is rooted in the fact that these systems fail to fully leverage the inherent structure of logical tasks throughout the reasoning processes, including decomposition, search, and resolution. To address this, this paper proposes a logic-complete reasoning framework, Aristotle. The framework consists of three key components: Logical Decomposer, Logical Search Router, and Logical Resolver, in which symbolic expressions and logical rules are comprehensively integrated into the entire reasoning process, significantly alleviating the bottlenecks of logical reasoning, i.e., reducing sub-task complexity, minimizing search errors, and resolving logical contradictions. Experimental results demonstrate that Aristotle consistently outperforms... | Jundong Xu, Hao Fei, Meng Luo, Qian Liu, Liangming Pan, William Yang Wang, Preslav Nakov, MongLi Lee, Wynne Hsu |  |

Continual training with long-context data becomes the de-facto method to equip LLMs with the ability to process long inputs. However, it still remains an open challenge to measure the quality of long-context training data. To address this issue, we propose a Long-context data selection framework with Attention-based Dependency Measurement (LADM), which can efficiently identify high-quality long-context data from a large-scale, multi-domain pre-training corpus. LADM leverages the retrieval capabilities of the attention mechanism to capture contextual dependencies, ensuring a comprehensive quality measurement of long-context data. Experimental results show that our LADM framework significantly boosts the performance of LLMs on multiple long-context tasks with only 1B tokens for continual training. | Jianghao Chen, Junhong Wu, Yangyifan Xu, Jiajun Zhang |  |

While the existing MGT detectors achieve strong performance, they remain vulnerable to simple perturbations and adversarial attacks. To build an effective defense against malicious perturbations, we view MGT detection from a threat modeling perspective, that is, analyzing the model’s vulnerability from an adversary’s point of view and exploring effective mitigations. To this end, we introduce an adversarial framework for training a robust MGT detector, named GREedy Adversary PromoTed DefendER (GREATER). The GREATER consists of two key components: an adversary GREATER-A and a detector GREATER-D. The GREATER-D learns to defend against the adversarial attack from GREATER-A and generalizes the defense to other attacks. GREATER-A identifies and perturbs the critical tokens in embedding space, along with greedy search and pruning to generate stealthy and disruptive adversarial examples.

In this paper, we present CLCA, a novel framework for enhancing LLM alignment with cultural values based on cultural learning. The framework leverages simulated social interactions to generate conversations in which LLMs engage in role-playing within culturally adapted social scenarios, capturing implicit cultural norms for model fine-tuning. CLCA improves cultural value alignment across various model architectures measured using World Value Survey data, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Our results provide early evidence that understanding intent and social interactions can enhance cultural value adaptation in LLMs, highlighting the promise of training approaches based on cultural learning. | Chen Cecilia Liu, Anna Korhonen, Iryna Gurevych |  |

Automatic subtitling (AS) systems are essential for alleviating the substantial workload of human transcribers and translators. However, existing AS corpora and the primary metric SubER focus on European languages. This paper introduces A-TASC, an Asian TED-based automatic subtitling corpus derived from English TED Talks, comprising nearly 800 hours of audio segments, aligned English transcripts, and subtitles in Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese. We then present SacreSubER, a modification of SubER, to enable the reliable evaluation of subtitle quality for languages without explicit word boundaries. Experimental results, using both end-to-end systems and pipeline approaches built on strong ASR and LLM components, validate the quality of the proposed corpus... | Yuhan Zhou, Naoki Yoshinaga |  |

We introduce a novel approach, Decoupled Refusal Training (DeRTa), designed to empower LLMs to refuse compliance to harmful prompts at any response position, significantly enhancing their safety capabilities. DeRTa incorporates two novel components: (1) Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) with Harmful Response Prefix, which trains models to recognize and avoid unsafe content by appending a segment of harmful response to the beginning of a safe response, and (2) Reinforced Transition Optimization (RTO), which equips models with the ability to transition from potential harm to safety refusal consistently throughout the harmful response sequence.

Previous studies typically focus on prompt engineering to elicit sentence embeddings from LLMs by prompting the model to encode sentence information into the embedding of the last token.However, LLMs are mostly decoder-only models with causal attention and the earlier tokens in the sentence cannot attend to the latter tokens, resulting in biased encoding of sentence information and cascading effects on the final decoded token.To this end, we propose a novel Token Prepending (TP) technique that prepends each layer’s decoded sentence embedding to the beginning of the sentence in the next layer’s input, allowing earlier tokens to attend to the complete sentence information under the causal attention mechanism.The proposed TP technique is a plug-and-play and training-free technique, which means it can be seamlessly integrated... | Yuchen Fu, Zifeng Cheng, Zhiwei Jiang, Zhonghui Wang, Yafeng Yin, Zhengliang Li, Qing Gu |  |

However, when the question is poorly posed, answerers (whether human or computer) may struggle to answer the question in a way that satisfies the asker, despite possibly knowing everything necessary to address the asker’s latent information need. Using Reddit question-answer interactions from r/NoStupidQuestions, we develop a computational framework grounded in linguistic theory to study poorly-posedness of questions by generating spaces of potential interpretations of questions and computing distributions over these spaces based on interpretations chosen by both human answerers in the Reddit question thread, as well as by a suite of large language models. Both humans and models struggle to converge on dominant interpretations when faced with poorly-posed questions, but employ different strategies: humans focus on specific interpretations through question negotiation, while models attempt comprehensive coverage by... | Neha Srikanth, Rachel Rudinger, Jordan Lee BoydGraber |  |

We study failures of grounding in the Ubuntu IRC dataset, where participants use text-only communication to resolve technical issues. We find that disruptions in conversational flow often stem from a misalignment in common ground, driven by a divergence in beliefs and assumptions held by participants. These disruptions, which we call conversational friction, significantly correlate with task success. While LLMs can identify overt cases of conversational friction, they struggle with subtler and more context-dependent instances that require pragmatic or domain-specific reasoning. | Rupak Sarkar, Neha Srikanth, Taylor Pellegrin, Rachel Rudinger, Claire Bonial, Philip Resnik |  |

Due to its transparency, Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) is widely used to measure the performance of these models through accuracy. However, existing MCQA benchmarks fail to capture the full reasoning capabilities of VLMs due to selection bias, when models disproportionately favor certain answer options based on positional patterns observed during training. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis of several VLM architectures across major datasets designed to assess complex video-focused reasoning. We identify where the bias is most pronounced and demonstrate to what extent model responses reflect genuine understanding of video content and related questions, as opposed to reliance on arbitrary patterns or superficial cues, such as answer position. By decomposing the MCQA task and adapting fairness bias metrics to VLMs, we introduce a post-processing calibration technique BOLD to balance this... | Olga Loginova, Oleksandr Bezrukov, Ravi Shekhar, Alexey Kravets |  |

However, if these rewards are inherently imperfect, exhibiting various biases, they can adversely affect the alignment of large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we collectively define the various biases present in rewards as the problem of reward unfairness. We propose a bias-agnostic method to address the issue of reward fairness from a resource allocation perspective, without specifically designing for each type of bias, yet effectively mitigating them. Specifically, we model preference learning as a resource allocation problem, treating rewards as resources to be allocated while considering the trade-off between utility and fairness in their distribution. We propose two methods, Fairness Regularization and Fairness Coefficient, to achieve fairness in rewards. We apply our methods in both verification and reinforcement learning scenarios to obtain a... | Sheng Ouyang, Yulan Hu, Ge Chen, Qingyang Li, Fuzheng Zhang, Yong Liu |  |

While adaptive optimizers like AdamW help address gradient variations, they still struggle with efficient and effective parameter-wise learning rate estimation, resulting in training instability, slow convergence, and poor compatibility with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques. This work introduces Scaling with Gradient Grouping (SGG), an optimizer wrapper that improves adaptive learning rate estimation by dynamic grouping and group-specific scaling. SGG first groups gradient statistics in each layer into clusters and then applies cluster-specific scaling to calibrate learning rates for each parameter, thus imposing collective group-wise constraints while maintaining precise per-parameter adaptation. Experiments on diverse (M)LLM benchmarks show that SGG integrates seamlessly with existing optimizers, and offers consistent gains and faster convergence over... | Siyuan Li, Juanxi Tian, Zedong Wang, Xin Jin, Zicheng Liu, Wentao Zhang, Dan Xu |  |

With the increasing workload, the unintended use of ‘quick’ heuristics, referred to as lazy thinking, has emerged as a recurring issue compromising review quality. Automated methods to detect such heuristics can help improve the peer-reviewing process. However, there is limited NLP research on this issue, and no real-world dataset exists to support the development of detection tools. This work introduces LazyReview, a dataset of peer-review sentences annotated with fine-grained lazy thinking categories. Our analysis reveals that Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to detect these instances in a zero-shot setting. However, instruction-based fine-tuning on our dataset significantly boosts performance by 10-20 performance points, highlighting the importance of high-quality training data. Furthermore, a controlled experiment demonstrates that reviews revised with lazy thinking feedback are more comprehensive and... | Sukannya Purkayastha, Zhuang Li, Anne Lauscher, Lizhen Qu, Iryna Gurevych |  |

In the NLP literature, some assumptions about these dialects are widely adopted (e.g., “Arabic dialects can be grouped into distinguishable regional dialects”) and are manifested in different computational tasks such as Arabic Dialect Identification (ADI). However, these assumptions are not quantitatively verified. We identify four of these assumptions and examine them by extending and analyzing a multi-label dataset, where the validity of each sentence in 11 different country-level dialects is manually assessed by speakers of these dialects. Our analysis indicates that the four assumptions oversimplify reality, and some of them are not always accurate. This in turn might be hindering further progress in different Arabic NLP tasks. | Amr Keleg, Sharon Goldwater, Walid Magdy |  |

Many complex scientific research questions have multiple plausible answers, each supported by evidence of varying strength. However, existing language models lack the capability to quantitatively and faithfully compare answer plausibility in terms of supporting evidence. To address this, we introduce Retrieve to Explain (R2E), a retrieval-based model that scores and ranks all possible answers to a research question based on evidence retrieved from a document corpus. The architecture represents each answer only in terms of its supporting evidence, with the answer itself masked. This allows us to extend feature attribution methods such as Shapley values, to transparently attribute answer scores to supporting evidence at inference time. The architecture also allows incorporation of new evidence without retraining, including non-textual data modalities templated into natural... | Ravi Patel, Angus Brayne, Rogier Hintzen, Daniel Jaroslawicz, Georgiana Neculae, Dane S.

Improving Personalization in Preference Tuning via Inferred User Personas](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.168/) |  | 0 | LLMs are aligned to follow input instructions by learning which of two responses users prefer for a prompt. However, such preference data do not convey \*why\* users prefer responses that are chosen or rejected, so LLMs trained on these datasets cannot tailor responses to varied user needs. To surface these parameters of personalization, we apply \*abductive reasoning\* to preference data, inferring needs and interests of users, i.e., personas, that may prefer either response. We test this idea in two steps: \*\*Persona Inference (PI)\*\*—abductively inferring personas of users who prefer chosen or rejected outputs—and \*\*Persona Tailoring (PT)\*\*—training models to tailor outputs to personas from PI. We show: 1) LLMs infer personas accurately explaining why different users may prefer \*both\* chosen or rejected outputs; 2) Training on preference data augmented with PI personas via PT boosts personalization and generalizes to supporting user-written personas; and 3) Rejected... | Nishant Balepur, Vishakh Padmakumar, Fumeng Yang, Shi Feng, Rachel Rudinger, Jordan Lee BoydGraber |  |

A) Forced B) Flawed C) Fixable D) All of the Above](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.169/) |  | 0 | Multiple choice question answering (MCQA) is popular for LLM evaluation due to its simplicity and human-like testing, but we argue for its reform. We first reveal flaws in MCQA’s format, as it struggles to: 1) test generation/subjectivity; 2) match LLM use cases; and 3) fully test knowledge. We instead advocate for generative formats based on human testing—where LLMs construct and explain answers—better capturing user needs and knowledge while remaining easy to score. We then show even when MCQA is a useful format, its datasets suffer from: leakage; unanswerability; shortcuts; and saturation. In each issue, we give fixes from education, like rubrics to guide MCQ writing; scoring methods to bridle guessing; and Item Response Theory to build harder MCQs. Lastly, we discuss LLM errors in MCQA—robustness, biases, and unfaithful explanations—showing how our prior solutions better measure or address these issues. While we do not need to desert MCQA, we encourage more efforts in refining the... | Nishant Balepur, Rachel Rudinger, Jordan Lee BoydGraber |  |

Traditional fake news detection methods relying on linguistic cues have also become less effective. Moreover, current detectors primarily focus on binary classification and English texts, often overlooking the distinction between machine-generated true vs. fake news and the detection in low-resource languages. To this end, we updated the detection schema to include machine-generated news focusing on Urdu. We further propose a conjoint detection strategy to improve the accuracy and robustness. Experiments show its effectiveness across four datasets in various settings. | Muhammad Zain Ali, Yuxia Wang, Bernhard Pfahringer, Tony C. Smith |  |

This challenge often results in local optima or poor convergence. Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) have been proven to effectively explore the solution space of neural networks by maintaining population diversity. Inspired by this, we innovatively combine the global search capabilities of EA with the local optimization of DRL to achieve a balance between exploration and exploitation. Nevertheless, the inherent flexibility of natural language in dialogue tasks complicates this direct integration, leading to prolonged evolutionary times. Thus, we further propose an elite individual injection mechanism to enhance EA’s search efficiency by adaptively introducing best-performing individuals into the population.

However, their role remains ambiguous in the Large Language Models (LLMs) era. Initial attempts to integrate structured representation into LLMs via a zero-shot setting yielded inferior performance. We hypothesize that such a decline stems from the structure information being passed into LLMs in a code format unfamiliar to LLMs’ training corpora. Consequently, we propose SR-LLM, an innovative framework with two settings to explore a superior way of integrating structured representation with LLMs from training-free and training-dependent perspectives. The former integrates structural information through natural language descriptions in LLM prompts, whereas its counterpart augments the model’s inference capability through fine-tuning on linguistically described structured representations. Performance improvements were observed in widely downstream... | Jiahuan Zhang, Tianheng Wang, Ziyi Huang, Yulong Wu, Hanqing Wu, DongbaiChen DongbaiChen, Linfeng Song, Yue Zhang, Guozheng Rao, Kaicheng Yu |  |

Effective learning on TAGs requires leveraging both textual node features and structural graph information. While language models (LMs) excel at processing text and graph neural networks (GNNs) effectively capture relational structures, their direct integration is computationally prohibitive due to the high cost of text and graph representation learning. Existing approaches address this challenge by adopting a two-step pipeline where LMs generate fixed node embeddings, which are then used for GNN training. However, this method neglects the interaction between textual and structural information, leading to suboptimal learning outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose SKETCH (Semantic Knowledge and Structure Enrichment), a novel framework that decouples node aggregation from graph convolution and integrates it into the text... | Chuang Zhou, Zhu Wang, Shengyuan Chen, Jiahe Du, Qiyuan Zheng, Zhaozhuo Xu, Xiao Huang |  |

Previous studies usually focus on prompt engineering to guide LLMs to encode the core semantic information of the sentence into the embedding of the last token. However, the last token in these methods still encodes an excess of non-essential information, such as stop words, limiting its encoding capacity. To this end, we propose a Contrastive Prompting (CP) technique that introduces an extra auxiliary prompt to elicit better sentence embedding. By contrasting with the auxiliary prompt, CP can steer existing prompts to encode the core semantics of the sentence, rather than non-essential information. CP is a plug-and-play inference-time intervention method that can be combined with various prompt-based methods. Extensive experiments on Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) tasks and downstream classification tasks demonstrate that our method can... | Zifeng Cheng, Zhonghui Wang, Yuchen Fu, Zhiwei Jiang, Yafeng Yin, Cong Wang, Qing Gu |  |

Despite their success, a persistent challenge is hallucination—where generated text fails to accurately reflect visual content—undermining both accuracy and reliability. Existing methods focus on alignment training or decoding refinements but primarily address symptoms at the generation stage without probing the underlying causes. In this work, we investigate the internal mechanisms driving hallucination in LVLMs, with an emphasis on the multi-head attention module. Specifically, we introduce Vision-aware Head Divergence (VHD), a metric that quantifies the sensitivity of attention head outputs to visual context. Based on this, our findings reveal the presence of vision-aware attention heads that are more attuned to visual information; however, the model’s overreliance on its prior language patterns is closely... | Jinghan He, Kuan Zhu, Haiyun Guo, Junfeng Fang, Zhenglin Hua, Yuheng Jia, Ming Tang, TatSeng Chua, Jinqiao Wang |  |

To address these challenges, we propose LongRefiner, an efficient plug-and-play refiner that leverages the inherent structural characteristics of long documents. LongRefiner employs dual-level query analysis, hierarchical document structuring, and adaptive refinement through multi-task learning on a single foundation model. Experiments on seven QA datasets demonstrate that LongRefiner achieves competitive performance in various scenarios while using 10x fewer computational costs and latency compared to the best baseline. Further analysis validates that LongRefiner is scalable, efficient, and effective, providing practical insights for real-world long-text RAG applications.

Assessing moral values encoded in these models via direct prompting is challenging due to potential leakage of human norms into model training data, and their sensitivity to prompt formulation. Instead, we propose to use word associations, which have been shown to reflect moral reasoning in humans, as low-level underlying representations to obtain a more robust picture of LLMs’ moral reasoning. We study moral differences in associations from western English-speaking communities and LLMs trained predominantly on English data. First, we create a large dataset of LLM-generated word associations, resembling an existing data set of human word associations. Next, we propose a novel method to propagate moral values based on seed words derived from Moral Foundation Theory through the human and LLM-generated association graphs. Finally, we compare the resulting moral... | Chaoyi Xiang, Chunhua Liu, Simon De Deyne, Lea Frermann |  |

To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework, TEACH (conTrastive knowlEdge Adaptive distillation with enhanCed Historical interpretability), which focuses on classical Chinese understanding by integrating word sense disambiguation with sentence translation. This integration leverages a confidence-annotated knowledge base and a step-by-step Chain-of-Thought prompting mechanism to minimize hallucinations and improve semantic analysis. Moreover, TEACH employs contrastive distillation learning to efficiently transfer capabilities from larger models to smaller ones (e.g., Qwen2-1.5B), addressing overly liberal translations.... | Yuting Wei, Qi Meng, Yuanxing Xu, Bin Wu |  |

However, its informative inputs and complex paradigms often lead to a greater variety of errors. Consequently, achieving automated on-policy assessment and error-oriented correction remain unresolved issues. In this paper, we propose RAG-Critic, a novel framework that leverages a critic-guided agentic workflow to improve RAG capabilities autonomously. Specifically, we initially design a data-driven error mining pipeline to establish a hierarchical RAG error system. Based on this system, we progressively align an error-critic model using a coarse-to-fine training objective, which automatically provides fine-grained error feedback. Finally, we design a critic-guided agentic RAG workflow that customizes executor-based solution flows based on the error-critic model’s feedback, facilitating an error-driven self-correction process.... | Guanting Dong, Jiajie Jin, Xiaoxi Li, Yutao Zhu, Zhicheng Dou, JiRong Wen |  |

In this paper, we propose AR-MCTS, a universal framework designed to progressively improve the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs through Active Retrieval (AR) and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). AR-MCTS follows the MCTS algorithm and heuristically integrates an active retrieval mechanism during the expansion stage to automatically acquire high-quality step-wise reasoning annotations. Moreover, we further introduce curriculum training objectives to progressively align with a process reward model, ultimately achieving process-level multimodal reasoning verification. Experimental results across three complex multimodal reasoning benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of AR-MCTS. Further analysis demonstrates that it can optimize sampling diversity and accuracy, yielding reliable... | Guanting Dong, Chenghao Zhang, Mengjie Deng, Yutao Zhu, Zhicheng Dou, JiRong Wen |  |

Previous work applying KD in the field of large language models (LLMs) typically focused on the post-training phase, where the student LLM learns directly from instructions and corresponding responses generated by the teacher model. In this paper, we extend KD to the pre-training phase of LLMs, named pre-training distillation (PD). We first conduct a preliminary experiment using GLM-4-9B as the teacher LLM to distill a 1.9B parameter student LLM, validating the effectiveness of PD. Considering the key impact factors of distillation, we systematically explore the design space of pre-training distillation across four aspects: logits processing, loss selection, scaling law, and offline or online logits. We conduct extensive experiments to explore the design space of pre-training distillation and find better configurations and interesting conclusions, such as larger student LLMs... | Hao Peng, Xin Lv, Yushi Bai, Zijun Yao, Jiajie Zhang, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li |  |

Existing research addresses such ambiguities primarily by rephrasing questions. These approaches neglect the inherently interactive nature of user interactions with VLMs, where ambiguities can be clarified through user feedback. However, research on interactive clarification faces two major challenges: (1) Benchmarks are absent to assess VLMs’ capacity for resolving ambiguities through interaction; (2) VLMs are trained to prefer answering rather than asking, preventing them from seeking clarification. To overcome these challenges, we introduce ClearVQA benchmark, which targets three common categories of ambiguity in VQA context, and encompasses various VQA scenarios. Furthermore, we propose an automated pipeline to generate ambiguity-clarification question pairs, enabling VLMs to ask reasonable clarification questions and generate more... | Pu Jian, Donglei Yu, Wen Yang, Shuo Ren, Jiajun Zhang |  |

LongBench v2 consists of 503 challenging multiple-choice questions, with contexts ranging from 8k to 2M words, across six major task categories: single-document QA, multi-document QA, long in-context learning, long-dialogue history understanding, code repository understanding, and long structured data understanding. To ensure the breadth and the practicality, we collect data from nearly 100 highly educated individuals with diverse professional backgrounds. We employ both automated and manual review processes to maintain high quality and difficulty, resulting in human experts achieving only 53.7% accuracy under a 15-minute time constraint. Our evaluation reveals that the best-performing model, when directly answers the questions, achieves only 50.1% accuracy. In contrast, the o1-preview model,... | Yushi Bai, Shangqing Tu, Jiajie Zhang, Hao Peng, Xiaozhi Wang, Xin Lv, Shulin Cao, Jiazheng Xu, Lei Hou, Yuxiao Dong, Jie Tang, Juanzi Li |  |

Strategy planning is the key to guiding both participants towards a consensus. Most LLMs-based methods use stimulus prompts or external strategy planners for strategy planning. However, stimulus prompts fail to teach LLMs to plan dialogue strategies explicitly. Moreover, training external strategy planners doesn’t fully account for adversarial interactions, thereby limiting their effectiveness against tough resisters. In this paper, to mitigate the above issues, we propose GAIA, a Game-based Adversarial self-play InterActive training paradigm, which constructs an adversarial two-player (a persuader and a resister) zero-sum game and guides the game to approximate Nash Equilibrium (NE) via reinforcement learning (RL) for the non-collaborative dialogues. First, we design a Chain-of-Mind prompt to reason the resister’s dialogue act step-by-step to... | Haiyang Wang, Zhiliang Tian, Yuchen Pan, Xin Song, Xin Niu, Minlie Huang, Bin Zhou |  |

Prior research has shown that a single LLM’s concept representations can be captured as steering vectors (SVs), enabling the control of LLM behavior (e.g., towards generating harmful content). Our work takes a novel approach by exploring the intricate relationships between concept representations across different LLMs, drawing an intriguing parallel to Plato’s Allegory of the Cave. In particular, we introduce a linear transformation method to bridge these representations and present three key findings: 1) Concept representations across different LLMs can be effectively aligned using simple linear transformations, enabling efficient cross-model transfer and behavioral control via SVs. 2) This linear transformation generalizes across concepts, facilitating alignment and control of SVs representing different concepts across LLMs. 3) A weak-to-strong transferability exists between LLM concept... | Youcheng Huang, Chen Huang, Duanyu Feng, Wenqiang Lei, Jiancheng Lv |  |

While existing approaches attempt to hide the communication costs in computation through token-level pipelining within MoE layers, their effectiveness is limited by the insufficient computation. We present FoldMoE, a high-performance MoE training system that enables token-level overlapping across entire Transformer blocks through novel attention-MoE pipelining. We propose an efficient pipeline schedule, and a novel token buffering design to decouple attention and MoE layer partitioning, along with a time-uniform micro-batching strategy for enhanced efficiency. Evaluations on GPT-MoE models with sequences up to 32K tokens show that FoldMoE achieves up to 1.49x and 2.72x speedup over state-of-the-art token-level overlapping and non-overlapping baselines respectively. | Guichao Zhu, Lintian Lei, Yuhao Qing, Yichao Fu, Fanxin Li, Dong Huang, Zekai Sun, Heming Cui |  |

In principle, reinforcement learning (RL) with appropriate reward signals can further enhance models’ capacities. However, how to obtain reliable rewards in long-context scenarios remains unexplored. To this end, we propose LongReward, a novel method that utilizes an off-the-shelf LLM to provide rewards for long-context model responses from four human-valued dimensions: helpfulness, logicality, faithfulness, and completeness, each with a carefully designed assessment pipeline. By combining LongReward and offline RL algorithm DPO, we are able to effectively improve long-context SFT models. Our experiments indicate that LongReward not only significantly improves models’ long-context performance but also... | Jiajie Zhang, Zhongni Hou, Xin Lv, Shulin Cao, Zhenyu Hou, Yilin Niu, Lei Hou, Yuxiao Dong, Ling Feng, Juanzi Li |  |

Existing works neglect to measure the generalization of their methods to other prompt styles and different sizes of LLMs. To address this, we define a controlled experimental setting covering 12 LLMs and four prompt styles. We additionally investigate if incorporating the response agreement of multiple LLMs and an appropriate loss function can improve calibration performance. Concretely, we build Calib-n, a novel framework that trains an auxiliary model for confidence estimation that aggregates responses from multiple LLMs to capture inter-model agreement. To optimize calibration, we integrate focal and AUC surrogate losses alongside binary cross-entropy. Experiments across four datasets demonstrate that both response agreement and focal loss improve calibration from baselines. We find that few-shot prompts are the most effective for... | Yuxi Xia, Pedro Henrique Luz de Araujo, Klim Zaporojets, Benjamin Roth |  |

Drafting these claims is a complex and time-consuming process that usually requires the expertise of skilled patent attorneys, which can form a large access barrier for many small enterprises. To solve these challenges, researchers have investigated large language models (LLMs) for automating patent claim generation. However, existing studies highlight inconsistencies between automated evaluation metrics and human expert assessments. To bridge this gap, we introduce Patent-CE, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating patent claims. Patent-CE includes comparative claim evaluations annotated by patent experts, focusing on five key criteria: feature completeness, conceptual clarity, terminology consistency, logical linkage, and overall quality. Additionally, we propose PatClaimEval, a novel multi-dimensional evaluation method specifically designed for patent claims. Our experiments... | Lekang Jiang, Pascal A. Scherz, Stefan Goetz |  |

Previous approaches have focused on generating multiple independent CoTs, combining them through ensembling or other post-hoc strategies to enhance reasoning. In this work, we introduce a novel approach where LLMs are fine-tuned to generate a sequence of Diverse Chains of Thought (DCoT) within a single inference step, which is fundamentally different from prior work that primarily operate on parallel CoT generations. DCoT allows LLMs to gain the ability to perform within-inference refinement of reasoning chains without requiring external feedback. Through a rigorous set of experiments spanning a wide range of tasks that require various reasoning types, we show that fine-tuning on DCoT improves performance over the CoT baseline across model families and scales (1.3B to 70B).

However, most current evaluations rely on public benchmarks, which are prone to data contamination issues that significantly compromise fairness. Previous researches have focused on constructing dynamic benchmarks to address contamination. However, continuously building new benchmarks is costly and cyclical.In this work, we aim to tackle contamination by analyzing the mechanisms of contaminated models themselves. Through our experiments, we discover that the overestimation of contaminated models is likely due to parameters acquiring shortcut solutions in training. We further propose a novel method for identifying shortcut neurons through \*\*comparative and causal analysis\*\*.Building on this, we introduce an evaluation method called \*\*shortcut neuron patching\*\* to suppress shortcut neurons. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating contamination. Additionally,... | Kejian Zhu, Shangqing Tu, Zhuoran Jin, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li, Jun Zhao |  |

Evaluating and Improving the Naturalness of Multilingual LLMs](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.193/) |  | 0 | Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly designed with English as the primary language, and even the few that are multilingual tend to exhibit strong English-centric biases. Much like speakers who might produce awkward expressions when learning a second language, LLMs often generate unnatural outputs in non-English languages, reflecting English-centric patterns in both vocabulary and grammar. Despite the importance of this issue, the naturalness of multilingual LLM outputs has received limited attention. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing novel automatic corpus-level metrics to assess the lexical and syntactic naturalness of LLM outputs in a multilingual context. Using our new metrics, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on a curated benchmark in French and Chinese, revealing a tendency towards English-influenced patterns. To mitigate this issue, we also propose a simple and effective alignment method to improve the naturalness of an LLM in a target language... | Yanzhu Guo, Simone Conia, Zelin Zhou, Min Li, Saloni Potdar, Henry Xiao |  |

This limitation hinders LLMs’ ability to predict precise character positions, which is crucial in tasks like Chinese Spelling Correction (CSC) where identifying the positions of misspelled characters accelerates correction processes. We propose Token Internal Position Awareness (TIPA), a method that significantly improves models’ ability to capture character positions within tokens by training them on reverse character prediction tasks using the tokenizer’s vocabulary. Experiments demonstrate that TIPA enhances position prediction accuracy in LLMs, enabling more precise identification of target characters in original text. Furthermore, when applied to downstream tasks that do not require exact position prediction, TIPA still boosts performance in tasks needing character-level information, validating its... | Zhu Xu, Zhiqiang Zhao, Zihan Zhang, Yuchi Liu, Quanwei Shen, Fei Liu, Yu Kuang, Jian He, Conglin Liu |  |

Studying this bias in large language models (LLMs) is crucial, as LLMs are increasingly used in various information-seeking and decision-making tasks as conversation partners to improve productivity. Thus, conformity to incorrect responses can compromise their effectiveness. In this paper, we adapt psychological experiments to examine the extent of conformity in state-of-the-art LLMs. Our findings reveal that all models tested exhibit varying levels of conformity toward the majority, regardless of their initial choice or correctness, across different knowledge domains. Notably, we are the first to show that LLMs are more likely to conform when they are more uncertain in their own prediction. We further explore factors that influence conformity, such as training paradigms and input characteristics, finding that instruction-tuned models are less susceptible to conformity, while... | Xiaochen Zhu, Caiqi Zhang, Tom Stafford, Nigel Collier, Andreas Vlachos |  |

However, the internal mechanisms behind ICL remain under-explored, particularly the mappings between inputs and labels. In this work, we reverse-engineer ICL by examining input-label mappings: what they are within LLMs, where they function, and how LLMs utilize them. (1) what: We discover input-label mappings stored within a few specific layers in the form of principal components (PCs), which capture human-interpretable and task-related words. (2) where: We propose a PC patching approach to identify the modules where input-label mappings function. Specifically, PC patching automatically crafts counterfactual representations using identified semantic PCs, rather than manually designing counterfactual text, to suppress the behavior related to LLM capability for ICL-related modules. Utilizing PC patching, we identify LLMs apply input-label mappings... | Chenghao Sun, Zhen Huang, Yonggang Zhang, Le Lu, Houqiang Li, Xinmei Tian, Xu Shen, Jieping Ye |  |

To address these limitations, we developed a novel method called set encoding. This method allows multiple pieces of text to be encoded in the same position, thereby eliminating positional bias entirely. Another promising use case for set encoding is to increase the size of the input an LLM can handle. Our experiments demonstrate that set encoding allows an LLM to solve tasks with far more tokens than without set encoding. To our knowledge, set encoding is the first technique to effectively extend an LLM’s context window without requiring any additional training. | Lukas Kinder, Lukas Edman, Alexander Fraser, Tobias Käfer |  |

While state-of-the-art speculative sampling methods use only a single layer and a language modeling (LM) head as the draft model to achieve impressive layer compression, their efficiency gains are substantially reduced for large-vocabulary LLMs, such as Llama-3-8B with a vocabulary of 128k tokens. To address this, we present FR-Spec, a frequency-ranked speculative sampling framework that optimizes draft candidate selection through vocabulary space compression. By constraining the draft search to a frequency-prioritized token subset, our method reduces LM Head computation overhead by 75% while ensuring the equivalence of the final output distribution.

In this paper, we propose VReST, a novel training-free approach that enhances Reasoning in LVLMs through Monte Carlo Tree Search and Self-Reward mechanisms. VReST meticulously traverses the reasoning landscape by establishing a search tree, where each node encapsulates a reasoning step, and each path delineates a comprehensive reasoning sequence. Our innovative multimodal Self-Reward mechanism assesses the quality of reasoning steps by integrating the utility of sub-questions, answer correctness, and the relevance of vision-language clues, all without the need for additional models. VReST surpasses current prompting methods and secures state-of-the-art performance across three multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

However, research in applied history suggests that people have difficulty finding appropriate analogies. And previous studies in the AI community have also overlooked historical analogies. To fill this gap, in this paper, we focus on the historical analogy acquisition task, which aims to acquire analogous historical events for a given event. We explore retrieval and generation methods for acquiring historical analogies based on different large language models (LLMs). Furthermore, we propose a self-reflection method to mitigate hallucinations and stereotypes when LLMs generate historical analogies. Through human evaluations and our specially designed automatic multi-dimensional assessment, we find that LLMs generally have a good potential for historical analogies.

A prevalent strategy to mitigate these issues is the use of reflection, which refines responses through an iterative process. However, while promising, reflection heavily relies on high-quality external feedback and requires iterative multi-agent inference processes, thus hindering its practical application. In this paper, we propose Meta-Reflection, a novel feedback-free reflection mechanism that necessitates only a single inference pass without external feedback. Motivated by the human ability to remember and retrieve reflections from past experiences when encountering similar problems, Meta-Reflection integrates reflective insights into a codebook, allowing the historical insights to be stored, retrieved, and used to guide LLMs in problem-solving.

This paper investigates the role of grammar books in translating extremely low-resource languages by decomposing it into two key steps: grammar rule retrieval and application. To facilitate the study, we introduce ZhuangRules, a modularized dataset of grammar rules and their corresponding test sentences. Our analysis reveals that rule retrieval constitutes a primary bottleneck in grammar-based translation. Moreover, although LLMs can apply simple rules for translation when explicitly provided, they encounter difficulties in handling more complex rules. To address these challenges, we propose representing grammar rules as code functions, considering their similarities in structure and the benefit of code in facilitating LLM reasoning. Our experiments show that using code rules significantly boosts... | Chen Zhang, Jiuheng Lin, Xiao Liu, Zekai Zhang, Yansong Feng |  |

Critique: A Decomposition of Self-Correction Capability for LLMs](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.203/) |  | 0 | Large Language Models (LLMs) can correct their self-generated responses, but a decline in accuracy after self-correction is also witnessed. To have a deeper understanding of self-correction, we endeavor to decompose, evaluate, and analyze the self-correction behaviors of LLMs. By enumerating and analyzing answer correctness before and after self-correction, we decompose the self-correction capability into confidence (being confident to correct answers) and critique (turning wrong answers to correct) capabilities, and propose two metrics from a probabilistic perspective to measure these 2 capabilities, along with another metric for overall self-correction capability evaluation. Based on our decomposition and evaluation metrics, we conduct extensive experiments and draw some empirical conclusions. For example, we find different models can exhibit distinct behaviors: some models are confident while others are more critical. We also find the trade-off between the two capabilities (i.e.... | Zhe Yang, Yichang Zhang, Yudong Wang, Ziyao Xu, Junyang Lin, Zhifang Sui |  |

It is a critical and challenging task even for legal practitioners, as it requires meticulous and professional annotations and summarizations by legal experts, which are admittedly time-consuming and expensive to collect at scale. To alleviate the burden on legal experts, we propose a method for automated legal interpretation. Specifically, by emulating doctrinal legal research, we introduce a novel framework, \*\*ATRIE\*\*, to address Legal Concept Interpretation, a typical task in legal interpretation. \*\*ATRIE\*\* utilizes large language models (LLMs) to \*\*A\*\*u\*\*T\*\*omatically \*\*R\*\*etrieve concept-related information, \*\*I\*\*nterpret legal concepts, and \*\*E\*\*valuate generated interpretations, eliminating dependence on legal experts.

Despite these advancements achieved, LVLMs still suffer from the hallucination problem, e.g., they tend to produce content that does not exist in the input images. Our investigation suggests that such hallucinations often stem from the deficiencies in fine-grained comprehension on the visual aspect, particularly when visual scenes exhibit appearance or semantic similarities (e.g., bicycle vs. motorcycles, baseball bat vs. baseball). In this work, we show such hallucination is naturally mitigated via a novel method called visual evidence prompting, utilizing small visual models to complement the LVLMs. While traditional visual models are not adept at interacting with humans, they excel at perceiving the fine-grained image contents. By symbolizing the professional outputs of domain-expert models as prompts, the LVLM... | Wei Li, Zhen Huang, Houqiang Li, Le Lu, Yang Lu, Xinmei Tian, Xu Shen, Jieping Ye |  |

In new domains or languages, the inefficiency of the tokenizer will slow down the training and generation of LLM. The mismatch in vocabulary also hinders deep knowledge transfer between LLMs like token-level distillation. To mitigate this gap, we propose an efficient method named \*\*TokAlign\*\* to replace the vocabulary of LLM from the token co-occurrences view, and further transfer the token-level knowledge between models. It first aligns the source vocabulary to the target one by learning a one-to-one mapping matrix for token IDs. Model parameters, including embeddings, are rearranged and progressively fine-tuned for the new vocabulary. Our method significantly improves multilingual text compression rates and vocabulary initialization for LLMs, decreasing the perplexity from 3.4e2 of strong baseline methods to 1.2e2 after initialization.

However, a critical challenge arises in continuous language models editing — a significant performance decline both in knowledge update and retention when the number of edits increases. By dissecting the perturbation weight of language model in continuous KE, we uncover that disentangled and sparsified knowledge representation can significantly alleviate the performance decline. Building on these insights, we introduce AdaEdit, a novel knowledge editing method. Extensive empirical evaluations on multiple LLMs demonstrate that our proposed methods can enhance the performance of edited LLMs in large-size continuous editing regimes, outperforming existing ones without substantially compromising the general abilities of these models. | Qi Li, Xiaowen Chu |  |

One factor that has been overlooked in cognitive modeling is the granularity of subword tokens, which explicitly encodes information about word length and frequency, and ultimately influences the quality of vector representations that are learned. This paper presents experiments that manipulate the token granularity and evaluate its impact on the ability of surprisal to account for processing difficulty of naturalistic text and garden-path constructions. Experiments with naturalistic reading times reveal a substantial influence of token granularity on surprisal, with tokens defined by a vocabulary size of 8,000 resulting in surprisal that is most predictive. In contrast, on garden-path constructions, language models trained on coarser-grained tokens generally assigned higher... | ByungDoh Oh, William Schuler |  |

Token-level diffusion doesn’t model word-order dependencies explicitly and operates on short, fixed output windows, while passage-level diffusion struggles with learning robust representations for long-form text. To address these challenges, we propose Segment-Level Diffusion (SLD), a framework that enhances diffusion-based text generation through text segmentation, robust representation training with adversarial and contrastive learning, and improved latent-space guidance. By segmenting long-form outputs into multiple latent representations and decoding them with an autoregressive decoder, SLD simplifies diffusion predictions and improves scalability. Experiments on four datasets demonstrate that, when compared to other diffusion and autoregressive baselines SLD achieves competitive or superior fluency, coherence, and contextual compatibility in... | Xiaochen Zhu, Georgi Karadzhov, Chenxi Whitehouse, Andreas Vlachos |  |

Previous works on multi-hop QA employ specific methods from different modeling perspectives based on large language models (LLMs), regardless of the question types. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth analysis of public multi-hop QA benchmarks, dividing the questions into four types and evaluating five types of cutting-edge methods for multi-hop QA: Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Single-step, Iterative-step, Sub-step, and Adaptive-step. We find that different types of multi-hop questions have varying degrees of sensitivity to different types of methods. Thus, we propose a Bi-levEL muLti-agEnt reasoning (BELLE) framework to address multi-hop QA by specifically focusing on the correspondence between question types and methods, where each type of method is regarded as an ”operator” by prompting LLMs differently. The first level of BELLE... | Taolin Zhang, Dongyang Li, Qizhou Chen, Chengyu Wang, Xiaofeng He |  |

However, existing PRMs primarily rely on heuristic approaches, which struggle with cross-domain generalization. While LLM-as-judge has been proposed to provide generalized rewards, current research has focused mainly on feedback results, overlooking the meaningful guidance embedded within the text. Additionally, static and coarse-grained evaluation criteria struggle to adapt to complex process supervision. To tackle these challenges, we propose Dynamic and Generalizable Process Reward Modeling (DG-PRM), which features a reward tree to capture and store fine-grained, multi-dimensional reward criteria. DG-PRM dynamically selects reward signals for step-wise reward scoring. To handle multifaceted reward signals, we pioneeringly adopt Pareto dominance estimation to identify discriminative positive and negative pairs.

Existing benchmarks for assessing mLLMs on harmful meme understanding rely on accuracy-based, model-agnostic evaluations using static datasets. These benchmarks are limited in their ability to provide up-to-date and thorough assessments, as online memes evolve dynamically. To address this, we propose AdamMeme, a flexible, agent-based evaluation framework that adaptively probes the reasoning capabilities of mLLMs in deciphering meme harmfulness. Through multi-agent collaboration, AdamMeme provides comprehensive evaluations by iteratively updating the meme data with challenging samples, thereby exposing specific limitations in how mLLMs interpret harmfulness. Extensive experiments show that our framework systematically reveals the varying performance of different target mLLMs, offering in-depth, fine-grained analyses of... | Zixin Chen, Hongzhan Lin, Kaixin Li, Ziyang Luo, Zhen Ye, Guang Chen, Zhiyong Huang, Jing Ma |  |

In this work, we introduce the text-image interleaved retrieval (TIIR) task, where the query and document are interleaved text-image sequences, and the model is required to understand the semantics from the interleaved context for effective retrieval. We construct a TIIR benchmark based on naturally interleaved wikiHow tutorials, where a specific pipeline is designed to generate interleaved queries. To explore the task, we adapt several off-the-shelf retrievers and build a dense baseline by interleaved multimodal large language model (MLLM). We then propose a novel Matryoshka Multimodal Embedder (MME), which compresses the number of visual tokens at different granularity, to address the challenge of excessive visual tokens in MLLM-based TIIR models. Experiments demonstrate that simple adaption of... | Xin Zhang, Ziqi Dai, Yongqi Li, Yanzhao Zhang, Dingkun Long, Pengjun Xie, Meishan Zhang, Jun Yu, Wenjie Li, Min Zhang |  |

Current state-of-the-art methods typically combine self-training mechanism with contrastive learning paradigm, in order to develop discriminative entity clusters for cross-lingual adaptation. Despite the promise, we identify that these methods neglect two key problems: distribution skewness and pseudo-label bias, leading to indistinguishable entity clusters with small margins. To this end, we propose a novel framework, MARAL, which optimizes an adaptively reweighted contrastive loss to handle the class skewness and theoretically guarantees the optimal feature arrangement with maximum margin. To further mitigate the adverse effects of unreliable pseudo-labels, MARAL integrates a progressive cross-lingual adaptation strategy, which first selects reliable samples as anchors and then refines the remaining... | Guangcheng Zhu, Ruixuan Xiao, Haobo Wang, Zhen Zhu, Gengyu Lyu, Junbo Zhao |  |

Researchers typically employ process-supervised reward models (PRMs) to guide the reasoning process, effectively improving the models’ reasoning abilities. However, existing methods for constructing process supervision training data, such as manual annotation and per-step Monte Carlo estimation, are often costly or suffer from poor quality. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a framework called EpicPRM (Efficient, Precise, Cheap), which annotates each intermediate reasoning step based on its quantified contribution and uses an adaptive binary search algorithm to enhance both annotation precision and efficiency. Using this approach, we efficiently construct a high-quality process supervision training dataset named Epic50k, consisting of 50k annotated intermediate steps.

However, the inherent gap between user queries and relevant documents hinders precise matching. We introduce QAEncoder, a training-free approach to bridge this gap. Specifically, QAEncoder estimates the expectation of potential queries in the embedding space as a robust surrogate for the document embedding, and attaches document fingerprints to effectively distinguish these embeddings. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets, languages, and embedding models confirmed QAEncoder’s alignment capability, which offers a simple-yet-effective solution with zero additional index storage, retrieval latency, training costs, or catastrophic forgetting and hallucination issues.

This paper introduces the Chat Game Engine (ChatGE) powered by LLM, which allows everyone to develop a custom game using natural language through Human-LLM interaction. To enable an LLM to function as a ChatGE, we instruct it to perform the following processes in each turn: (1) Pscript: configure the game script segment based on the user’s input; (2) Pcode: generate the corresponding code snippet based on the game script segment; (3) Putter: interact with the user, including guidance and feedback. We propose a data synthesis pipeline based on LLM to generate game script-code pairs and interactions from a few manually crafted seed data. We propose a three-stage training strategy following curriculum learning principles to transfer the dialogue-based LLM to our ChatGE smoothly. We construct a ChatGE for poker... | Jiale Hong, Hongqiu Wu, Hai Zhao |  |

An Information-Theoretic Analysis of L1-Dependent Biases](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.219/) |  | 0 | This study evaluates Large Language Models’ (LLMs) ability to simulate non-native-like English use observed in human second language (L2) learners interfered with by their native first language (L1). In dialogue-based interviews, we prompt LLMs to mimic L2 English learners with specific L1s (e.g., Japanese, Thai, Urdu) across seven languages, comparing their outputs to real L2 learner data. Our analysis examines L1-driven linguistic biases, such as reference word usage and avoidance behaviors, using information-theoretic and distributional density measures. Results show that modern LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5, LLAMA3, DeepseekV3, GPT 4o) replicate L1-dependent patterns observed in human L2 data, with distinct influences from various languages (e.g., Japanese, Korean, and Mandarin significantly affect tense agreement, and Urdu influences noun-verb collocations). Our results reveal LLMs’ potential for L2 dialogue generation and evaluation for future educational applications. | Rena Wei Gao, Xuetong Wu, Tatsuki Kuribayashi, Mingrui Ye, Siya Qi, Carsten Roever, Yuanxing Liu, Zheng Yuan, Jey Han Lau |  |

However, previous research in the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) field has not sufficiently addressed tasks related to the design of complex engineering solutions. To fill this gap, we introduce a new benchmark, SolutionBench, to evaluate a system’s ability to generate complete and feasible solutions for engineering problems with multiple complex constraints. To further advance the design of complex engineering solutions, we propose a novel system, SolutionRAG, that leverages the tree-based exploration and bi-point thinking mechanism to generate reliable solutions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SolutionRAG achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the SolutionBench, highlighting its potential to enhance the automation and reliability of complex engineering solution design in real-world applications. | Zhuoqun Li, Haiyang Yu, Xuanang Chen, Hongyu Lin, Yaojie Lu, Fei Huang, Xianpei Han, Yongbin Li, Le Sun |  |

Traditional methodologies often entail high costs and limited scalability, while current automated methods such as opinion synthesis exhibit severe biases and lack traceability. In this paper, we introduce SurveyPilot, a novel finite-state orchestrated agentic framework that automates the collection and analysis of human opinions from social media platforms. SurveyPilot addresses the limitations of pioneering approaches by (i) providing transparency and traceability in each state of opinion collection and (ii) incorporating several techniques for mitigating biases, notably with a novel genetic algorithm for improving result diversity. Our extensive experiments reveal that SurveyPilot achieves a close alignment with authentic survey results across multiple domains, observing average relative improvements of 68,98% and 51,37% when comparing to opinion synthesis and... | Viet Thanh Pham, Lizhen Qu, Zhuang Li, Suraj Sharma, Gholamreza Haffari |  |

To address these issues, we propose a vision-language model named Sophia for long video understanding, which can efficiently handle hour-scale long videos. First, we employ a Shot-adaptive Frame Pruning technique, which naturally segments long videos into multiple camera shots, to more sharply identify and focus on the frames relevant to the query. Additionally, we introduce a Hierarchical Attention mechanism to effectively model the long-term temporal dependencies between video frames, which achieves a time and space complexity of O(N) w.r.t. the input sequence length N while theoretically maintaining the global modeling efficiency. Experimentally, our Sophia exhibits competitive performance compared to existing video understanding... | Daoze Zhang, Yuze Zhao, Jintao Huang, Yingda Chen |  |

Currently, static benchmarks suffer from inflexibility and unreliability, leading users to prefer human voting platforms like Chatbot Arena. However, human evaluations require significant manual effort. Therefore, we propose Auto-Arena, an innovative framework that automates the entire evaluation process using LLM-powered agents. Firstly, an LLM examiner generates questions. Then, two LLM candidates engage in a multi-round peer battle based on the questions, aiming at revealing their true performance differences. Finally, a committee of LLM judges collaboratively discusses and decides the winner, reducing bias and enhancing fairness. During the peer battles, we observe intriguing scenarios where the LLM candidates display competitive behaviors and learn from the opponents. In our extensive experiments involving 15 recent LLMs, Auto-Arena shows a 92.14%... | Ruochen Zhao, Wenxuan Zhang, Yew Ken Chia, Weiwen Xu, Deli Zhao, Lidong Bing |  |

While prior research has focused on basic-level categories, this study is the first attempt to examine the organization of categories by analyzing exemplars produced at the subordinate level. We present a new Italian psycholinguistic dataset of human-generated exemplars for 187 concrete words. We then leverage these data to evaluate whether textual and vision LLMs produce meaningful exemplars that align with human category organization across three key tasks: exemplar generation, category induction, and typicality judgment. Our findings show a low alignment between humans and LLMs, consistent with previous studies. However, their performance varies notably across different semantic domains. Ultimately, this study highlights both the promises and the constraints of using AI-generated exemplars to support psychological and linguistic research. | Andrea Pedrotti, Giulia Rambelli, Caterina Villani, Marianna Bolognesi |  |

Several existing sub 2-bit post-training quantization (PTQ) methods utilize a mix-precision scheme by leveraging an unstructured fine-grained mask to explicitly distinguish salient weights, while which introduces an extra 1-bit or more per weight. To explore the real limit of PTQ, we propose an extremely low-bit PTQ method called PTQ1.61, which enables weight quantization to 1.61-bit for the first time. Specifically, we first introduce a one-dimensional structured mask with negligibly additional 0.0002-bit per weight based on input activations from the perspective of reducing the upper bound of quantization error to allocate corresponding salient weight channels to 4-bit. For non-salient channels binarization, an efficient block-wise scaling factors optimization framework is then presented to take implicit row-wise correlations and angular biases into account.... | Jiaqi Zhao, Miao Zhang, Ming Wang, Yuzhang Shang, Kaihao Zhang, Weili Guan, Yaowei Wang, Min Zhang |  |

ProtoLens uses a Prototype-aware Span Extraction module to identify relevant text spans associated with learned prototypes and a Prototype Alignment mechanism to ensure prototypes are semantically meaningful throughout training. By aligning the prototype embeddings with human-understandable examples, ProtoLens provides interpretable predictions while maintaining competitive accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ProtoLens outperforms both prototype-based and non-interpretable baselines on multiple text classification benchmarks.

Due to varying information densities across languages, target speech often mismatches the source speech duration, causing audio-video synchronization issues that significantly impact viewer experience. In this study, we approach duration alignment in LLM-based video dubbing machine translation as a preference optimization problem. We propose the Segment Supervised Preference Optimization (SSPO) method, which employs a segment-wise sampling strategy and fine-grained loss to mitigate duration mismatches between source and target lines. Experimental results demonstrate that SSPO achieves superior performance in duration alignment tasks. | Chaoqun Cui, Liangbin Huang, Shijing Wang, Zhe Tong, Zhaolong Huang, Xiao Zeng, Xiaofeng Liu |  |

In this paper, we leverage Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) within the LLaMA Scope to uncover sparse, interpretable latents that govern RAG behaviors. Through systematic analysis of SAE activations, we identify specific latents associated with two fundamental RAG decisions: (1) context versus memory prioritization, and (2) response generation versus query rejection. Intervention experiments demonstrate that these latents enable precise control over model behavior and maintain generalizability across various experimental settings. Mechanistic analysis reveals that manipulating these latents influences model behavior by reconfiguring attention patterns of retrieval heads. Our findings establish SAEs as a principled tool for understanding and controlling RAG behaviors, demonstrating capabilities in precise behavior steering without... | Chunlei Xin, Shuheng Zhou, Huijia Zhu, Weiqiang Wang, Xuanang Chen, Xinyan Guan, Yaojie Lu, Hongyu Lin, Xianpei Han, Le Sun |  |

However, these methods often face challenges such as superposition and layer-wise activation variance, which limit their reliability. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) offer a more nuanced analysis by decomposing the activations of LLMs into a sparse linear combination of SAE features. We introduce a novel metric to assess the monolinguality of features obtained from SAEs, discovering that some features are strongly related to specific languages. Additionally, we show that ablating these SAE features only significantly reduces abilities in one language of LLMs, leaving others almost unaffected. Interestingly, we find some languages have multiple synergistic SAE features, and ablating them together yields greater improvement than ablating individually. Moreover, we leverage these SAE-derived language-specific features to enhance steering... | Boyi Deng, Yu Wan, Baosong Yang, Yidan Zhang, Fuli Feng |  |

However, the incorporation of external and unverified knowledge increases the vulnerability of LLMs because attackers can perform attack tasks by manipulating knowledge. In this paper, we introduce a benchmark named SafeRAG designed to evaluate the RAG security. First, we classify attack tasks into silver noise, inter-context conflict, soft ad, and white Denial-of-Service. Next, we construct RAG security evaluation dataset (i.e., SafeRAG dataset) primarily manually for each task. We then utilize the SafeRAG dataset to simulate various attack scenarios that RAG may encounter. Experiments conducted on 14 representative RAG components demonstrate that RAG exhibits significant vulnerability to all attack tasks and even the most apparent attack task can easily bypass existing... | Xun Liang, Simin Niu, Zhiyu Li, Sensen Zhang, Hanyu Wang, Feiyu Xiong, Jason Zhaoxin Fan, Bo Tang, Jihao Zhao, Jiawei Yang, Shichao Song, Mengwei Wang |  |

Graph neural networks mainly depend on structural information, often overlooking semantic understanding and requiring high computational costs. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) support zero-shot reasoning but lack sufficient capabilities to grasp the laws of historical event development. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a training-free Analogical Replay (AnRe) reasoning framework. Our approach retrieves similar events for queries through semantic-driven clustering and builds comprehensive historical contexts using a dual history extraction module that integrates long-term and short-term history. It then uses LLMs to generate analogical reasoning examples as contextual inputs, enabling the model to deeply understand historical patterns of similar events and improve its ability to predict unknown ones. Our experiments on four benchmarks show that AnRe significantly... | Guo Tang, Zheng Chu, Wenxiang Zheng, Junjia Xiang, Yizhuo Li, Weihao Zhang, Ming Liu, Bing Qin |  |

While successors like QwQ, Deepseek-R1 (R1) and LIMO replicate these advancements, whether these models truly possess test-time scaling capabilities remains underexplored. This study found that longer CoTs of these o1-like models do not consistently enhance accuracy; in fact, correct solutions are often shorter than incorrect ones for the same questions. Further investigation shows this phenomenon is closely related to models’ self-revision capabilities - longer CoTs contain more self-revisions, which often lead to performance degradation. We then compare sequential and parallel scaling strategies on QwQ, R1 and LIMO, finding that parallel scaling achieves better coverage and scalability. Based on these insights, we propose “Shortest Majority Vote”, a method that combines parallel scaling... | Zhiyuan Zeng, Qinyuan Cheng, Zhangyue Yin, Yunhua Zhou, Xipeng Qiu |  |

Existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) SED models predominantly rely on graph neural networks (GNNs), which involve complex graph construction and time-consuming training processes, limiting their practicality in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we rethink the key challenge in SED: the informal and noisy nature of short texts on social media platforms, which impacts clustering accuracy. We propose a novel framework, LLM-enhanced Social Event Detection (LSED), which leverages the rich background knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to address this challenge. Specifically, LSED utilizes LLMs to formalize and disambiguate short texts by completing abbreviations and summarizing informal expressions.

Concurrently, the safety of such generative models has become an area of growing concern. This work introduces a novel type of jailbreak, which triggers T2I models to generate the image with visual text, where the image and the text, although considered to be safe in isolation, combine to form unsafe content. To systematically explore this phenomenon, we propose a dataset to evaluate the current diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models under such jailbreak. We benchmark nine representative T2I models, including two closed-source commercial models. Experimental results reveal a concerning tendency to produce unsafe content: all tested models suffer from such type of jailbreak, with rates of unsafe generation ranging from around 10% to 70% where DALL·E 3 demonstrates almost the highest unsafety.

Arithmetic tasks provide a controlled framework to explore these capabilities, yet performance anomalies persist, such as inconsistent effectiveness in multiplication and erratic generalization in modular addition (e.g., modulo 100 vs. 101). This paper develops a unified theoretical framework for understanding the generalization behaviors of transformers in arithmetic tasks, focusing on length generalization. Through detailed analysis of addition, multiplication, and modular operations, we reveal that translation invariance in addition aligns with relative positional encoding for robust generalization, while base mismatch in modular operations disrupts this alignment. Experiments across GPT-family models validate our framework, confirming its ability to predict generalization behaviors.

However, existing work on coherence modeling has paid little attention to discourse relations. In this paper, we provide empirical evidence to demonstrate that relation features are correlated with text coherence. Then, we investigate a novel fusion model that uses position-aware attention and a visible matrix to combine text- and relation-based features for coherence assessment. Experimental results on two benchmarks show that our approaches can significantly improve baselines, demonstrating the importance of relation features for coherence modeling. | Wei Liu, Michael Strube |  |

However, they overlook that the direct generation of harmful content from scratch is more difficult than inducing LLM to calibrate benign content into harmful forms.In our study, we introduce a novel attack framework that exploits AdVersArial meTAphoR (AVATAR) to induce the LLM to calibrate malicious metaphors for jailbreaking.Specifically, to answer harmful queries, AVATAR adaptively identifies a set of benign but logically related metaphors as the initial seed.Then, driven by these metaphors, the target LLM is induced to reason and calibrate about the metaphorical content, thus jailbroken by either directly outputting harmful responses or calibrating residuals between metaphorical and professional harmful content.Experimental results demonstrate that AVATAR can effectively and transferably jailbreak LLMs and achieve a state-of-the-art attack success rate across... | Yu Yan, Sheng Sun, Zenghao Duan, Teli Liu, Min Liu, Zhiyi Yin, LeiJingyu LeiJingyu, Qi Li |  |

To further enhance the performance of non-dominant languages, we propose ShifCon, a Shift-based multilingual Contrastive framework that aligns the internal forward process of other languages toward that of the dominant one. Specifically, it shifts the representations of non-dominant languages into the dominant language subspace, allowing them to access relatively rich information encoded in the model parameters. The enriched representations are then shifted back into their original language subspace before generation. Moreover, we introduce a subspace distance metric to pinpoint the optimal layer area for shifting representations and employ multilingual contrastive learning to further enhance the... | Hengyuan Zhang, Chenming Shang, Sizhe Wang, Dongdong Zhang, Yiyao Yu, Feng Yao, Renliang Sun, Yujiu Yang, Furu Wei |  |

However, existing watermark methods often struggle with a fundamental dilemma: improving watermark effectiveness (the detectability of the watermark) often comes at the cost of reduced text quality. This trade-off limits their practical application. To address this challenge, we first formalize the problem within a multi-objective trade-off analysis framework. Within this framework, we identify a key factor that influences the dilemma. Unlike existing methods, where watermark strength is typically treated as a fixed hyperparameter, our theoretical insights lead to the development of MorphMark—a method that adaptively adjusts the watermark strength in response to changes in the identified factor, thereby achieving an effective resolution of the dilemma. In addition, MorphMark also prioritizes flexibility since it... | Zongqi Wang, Tianle Gu, Baoyuan Wu, Yujiu Yang |  |

A Comprehensive Study of Gist Token-based Context Compression](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.241/) |  | 0 | In this work, we provide an empirical investigation of gist-based context compression methods to improve context processing in large language models. We focus on two key questions: (1) How well can these methods replace full attention models? and (2) What potential failure patterns arise due to compression? Through extensive experiments, we show that while gist-based compression can achieve only slight performance loss on tasks like retrieval-augmented generation and long-document QA, it faces challenges in tasks like synthetic recall. Furthermore, we identify three key failure patterns: lost by the boundary, lost if surprise, and lost along the way. To mitigate these issues, we propose two effective strategies: fine-grained autoencoding, which enhances the reconstruction of original token information, and segment-wise token importance estimation, which adjusts optimization based on token dependencies. Our work provides valuable insights into the understanding of gist token-based... | Chenlong Deng, Zhisong Zhang, Kelong Mao, Shuaiyi Li, Xinting Huang, Dong Yu, Zhicheng Dou |  |

An emerging line of work demonstrates success in using the LLM as a formalizer to generate a formal representation of the planning domain in some language, such as Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). This formal representation can be deterministically solved to find a plan. We systematically evaluate this methodology while bridging some major gaps. While previous work only generates a partial PDDL representation, given templated, and therefore unrealistic environment descriptions, we generate the complete representation given descriptions of various naturalness levels. Among an array of observations critical to improve LLMs’ formal planning abilities, we note that most large enough models can effectively formalize descriptions as PDDL, outperforming those directly generating plans, while being robust to lexical perturbation. As the descriptions become more... | Cassie Huang, Li Zhang |  |

Despite the widespread use of JSON in integrating language models with programs, there is a lack of comprehensive analysis and benchmarking of these capabilities. We explore various aspects of JSON generation, such as structure understanding, escaping, and natural language description, to determine how to assess and enable LLMs to generate valid responses. Building upon this, we propose SchemaBench features around 40K different JSON schemas to obtain and assess models’ abilities in generating valid JSON. We find that the latest LLMs are still struggling to generate a valid JSON string. Moreover, we demonstrate that incorporating reinforcement learning with a Fine-grained Schema Validator can further enhance models’ understanding of JSON schema, leading to improved performance. Our models demonstrate significant improvement in... | Yaxi Lu, Haolun Li, Xin Cong, Zhong Zhang, Yesai Wu, Yankai Lin, Zhiyuan Liu, Fangming Liu, Maosong Sun |  |

However, existing methods encounter two primary challenges: limited data diversity and high data noise. Current approaches often neglect fine-grained knowledge, such as entities and quantities, leading to insufficient diversity. Besides, unsupervised data frequently lacks discriminative information, and the generated synthetic samples may introduce noise. In this paper, we propose a pipeline-based data augmentation method via LLMs and introduce the Gaussian-decayed gradient-assisted Contrastive Sentence Embedding (GCSE) model to enhance unsupervised sentence embeddings. To tackle the issue of low data diversity, our pipeline utilizes knowledge graphs (KGs) to extract entities and quantities, enabling LLMs to generate more diverse samples. To address high data noise, the GCSE model uses a Gaussian-decayed function to limit the impact of... | Peichao Lai, Zhengfeng Zhang, Wentao Zhang, Fangcheng Fu, Bin Cui |  |

Although recent work on safety training with modules such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to resist jailbreaks shows promise, these approaches can inadvertently degrade a model’s general utility. In this paper, we propose a novel plug-and-play method that mitigates the impact of safety training on model utility by explicitly locating and leveraging safety-critical singular vectors, which only contribute to safety, within the model’s parameter space. We quantify the safety-criticality of each singular vector as the difference of their importance for safety and utility measured by a corresponding low-rank projection. The top scored singular vectors are located as safety-critical and are used to initialize the LoRA modules within existing safety training methods in a plug-and-play manner,... | Peijian Gu, Quan Wang, Zhendong Mao |  |

To address this, current methods often design various data flywheels to collect complex code instructions, enabling models to handle more intricate tasks. However, these approaches typically rely on off-the-shelf datasets and data augmentation from a limited set of proprietary LLMs (e.g., Claude, GPT4, and so on), which restricts the diversity of the constructed data and makes it prone to systemic biases. In this paper, we propose \*\*WarriorCoder\*\*, a novel paradigm learns from expert battles to address these limitations. Specifically, we create an arena where leading expert code LLMs challenge each other, with evaluations conducted by impartial judges. This competitive framework generates novel training data from scratch, leveraging the strengths of all participants.... | Huawen Feng, Pu Zhao, Qingfeng Sun, Can Xu, Fangkai Yang, Lu Wang, Qianli Ma, Qingwei Lin, Saravan Rajmohan, Dongmei Zhang, Qi Zhang |  |

However, compared to traditional coarse-grained emotion classification, two difficulties arise as the granularity of emotions becomes finer, i.e., the presence of closely confusable emotions which are hard to distinguish, and the biased performance caused by long-tailed emotions. Although addressing both difficulties is vital to FEC, previous studies have predominantly focused on dealing with only one of them. In this paper, we propose TACO, a novel triple-view framework that treats FEC as an instance-label (i.e., utterance-emotion) joint embedding learning problem to tackle both difficulties concurrently by considering three complementary views. Specifically, we design a clustering-guided contrastive loss, which incorporates clustering techniques to guide the contrastive learning... | Junqing Gong, Binhan Yang, Wei Shen |  |

However, distillation can lead to model homogenization, reducing diversity among models and impairing their ability to robustly handle complex or novel tasks. These limitations underscore the need to systematically quantify the distillation process and its impact. In this work, we propose a framework to evaluate and quantify model distillation. Our method addresses two key aspects: (1) Identifying identity cognition contradictions to assess discrepancies in how models perceive and represent identity-related information, and (2) Analyzing multi-granularity response similarities across models to measure the extent of homogenization. Experimental results demonstrate two key insights: (1) Well-known closed-source and open-source LLMs usually exhibit high distillation degrees, except for Claude, Doubao, and Gemini. (2) Base LLMs show higher... | Sunbowen Lee, Junting Zhou, Chang Ao, Kaige Li, Xeron Du, Sirui He, Haihong Wu, Tianci Liu, Jiaheng Liu, Hamid AlinejadRokny, Min Yang, Yitao Liang, Zhoufutu Wen, Shiwen Ni |  |

Specifically, LBL for MoEs is defined as NE ∑i=1NE fipi, where NE is the total number of experts, fi represents the frequency of expert i being selected, and pi denotes the average gating score of the expert i. Existing MoE training frameworks usually employ the parallel training strategy so that fi and the LBL are calculated within a micro-batch and averaged across parallel groups.However, a micro-batch for training billion-scale LLMs typically contains very few sequences, leading to the micro-batch LBL being almost at the sequence level, and the router is pushed to distribute the token evenly within each sequence.Under this strict constraint, even tokens from a domain-specific sequence (e.g., code) are uniformly routed to all experts, thereby inhibiting expert specialization.In this work, we propose calculating LBL using a global-batch to loose this constraint.

While recent research has extended RAG models to complex noisy scenarios, these explorations often confine themselves to limited noise types and presuppose that noise is inherently detrimental to LLMs, potentially deviating from real-world retrieval environments and restricting practical applicability. In this paper, we define seven distinct noise types from a linguistic perspective and establish a Noise RAG Benchmark (NoiserBench), a comprehensive evaluation framework encompassing multiple datasets and reasoning tasks. Through empirical evaluation of eight representative LLMs with diverse architectures and scales, we reveal that these noises can be further categorized into two practical groups: noise that is beneficial to LLMs (aka beneficial noise) and noise that is harmful to LLMs (aka harmful noise). While harmful noise generally impairs performance,... | Jinyang Wu, Shuai Zhang, Feihu Che, Mingkuan Feng, Pengpeng Shao, Jianhua Tao |  |

Existing attacks on LLM reasoning are constrained by specific settings or lack of imperceptibility, limiting their feasibility and generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose the Stepwise rEasoning Error Disruption (SEED) attack, which subtly injects errors into prior reasoning steps to mislead the model into producing incorrect subsequent reasoning and final answers. Unlike previous methods, SEED is compatible with zero-shot and few-shot settings, maintains the natural reasoning flow, and ensures covert execution without modifying the instruction. Extensive experiments on four datasets across four different models demonstrate SEED’s effectiveness, revealing the vulnerabilities of LLMs to disruptions in reasoning processes.

However, its reliability is compromised by the CoT reasoning’s inability to capture comprehensive and deeper details, often leading to incomplete outcomes. Existing methods mainly rely on majority voting or criteria expansion, which is insufficient to address the limitation in CoT. We propose Crowd-based Comparative Evaluation, which introduces additional crowd responses to compare with the candidate responses, thereby exposing deeper and more comprehensive details within the candidate responses. This process effectively guides LLM-as-a-Judge to provide a more detailed CoT judgment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enhances evaluation reliability, achieving an average accuracy gain of 6.7% across five benchmarks. Moreover, our method produces higher-quality CoTs that facilitate judge distillation and exhibit superior performance in rejection sampling... | Qiyuan Zhang, Yufei Wang, Yuxin Jiang, Liangyou Li, Chuhan Wu, Yasheng Wang, Xin Jiang, Lifeng Shang, Ruiming Tang, Fuyuan Lyu, Chen Ma |  |

While previous studies point out this cross-lingual inconsistency issue, the underlying causes remain unexplored. In this work, we use mechanistic interpretability methods to investigate cross-lingual inconsistencies in MLMs. We find that MLMs encode knowledge in a language-independent concept space through most layers, and only transition to language-specific spaces in the final layers. Failures during the language transition often result in incorrect predictions in the target language, even when the answers are correct in other languages. To mitigate this inconsistency issue, we propose a linear shortcut method that bypasses computations in the final layers, enhancing both prediction accuracy and cross-lingual consistency. Our findings shed light on the internal mechanisms of MLMs and provide a... | Mingyang Wang, Heike Adel, Lukas Lange, Yihong Liu, Ercong Nie, Jannik Strötgen, Hinrich Schütze |  |

We find that existing decomposition policies, typically hand-crafted demonstrations, do not align well with downstream verifiers in terms of atomicity—a novel metric quantifying information density—leading to suboptimal verification results. We formulate finding the optimal decomposition policy for optimal verification as a bilevel optimization problem. To approximate a solution for this strongly NP-hard problem, we propose dynamic decomposition, a reinforcement learning framework that leverages verifier feedback to learn a policy for dynamically decomposing claims to verifier-preferred atomicity. Experimental results show that dynamic decomposition outperforms existing decomposition policies, improving verification confidence by 0.07 and accuracy by 0.12 (on a 0-1... | Yining Lu, Noah Ziems, Hy Dang, Meng Jiang |  |

One promising solution, called offsite-tuning (OT), is proposed to address these challenges, where a weaker emulator is compressed from the original model and further fine-tuned with adapter to enhance privacy. However, the existing OT-based methods require high computational costs and lack theoretical analysis. This paper introduces a novel OT approach based on gradient-preserving compression. By analyzing the OT problem through the lens of optimization, we propose a method that selectively applies compression techniques such as rank compression and channel pruning, preserving the gradients of fine-tuned adapters while ensuring privacy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses existing OT methods, both in terms of privacy protection and... | Kai Yao, Zhaorui Tan, Penglei Gao, Lichun Li, Kaixin Wu, Yinggui Wang, Yuan Zhao, Yixin Ji, Jianke Zhu, Wei Wang |  |

This highlights the critical need to understand the knowledge boundary of LLMs, a concept that remains inadequately defined in existing research. In this survey, we propose a comprehensive definition of the LLM knowledge boundary and introduce a formalized taxonomy categorizing knowledge into four distinct types. Using this foundation, we systematically review the field through three key lenses: the motivation for studying LLM knowledge boundaries, methods for identifying these boundaries, and strategies for mitigating the challenges they present. Finally, we discuss open challenges and potential research directions in this area. We aim for this survey to offer the community a comprehensive overview, facilitate access to key... | Moxin Li, Yong Zhao, Wenxuan Zhang, Shuaiyi Li, Wenya Xie, SeeKiong Ng, TatSeng Chua, Yang Deng |  |

During our re-implementation of this model, we noticed that in multimodal tasks requiring visual input (e.g., geometry problems), Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) struggle to maintain focus on the visual information, in other words, MLLMs suffer from a gradual decline in attention to visual information as reasoning progresses, causing text-over-relied outputs. To investigate this, we ablate image inputs during long-chain reasoning. Concretely, we truncate the reasoning process midway, then re-complete the reasoning process with the input image removed. We observe only a ~2 accuracy drop on MathVista’s test-hard subset, revealing the model’s textual outputs dominate the following reasoning process. Motivated by this, we propose Take-along Visual Conditioning (TVC), a strategy that shifts... | HaiLong Sun, Zhun Sun, Houwen Peng, HanJia Ye |  |

This paper initially introduces a dual-metric evaluation method, comprising Boundary Clarity and Chunk Stickiness, to enable the direct quantification of chunking quality. Leveraging this assessment method, we highlight the inherent limitations of traditional and semantic chunking in handling complex contextual nuances, thereby substantiating the necessity of integrating LLMs into chunking process. To address the inherent trade-off between computational efficiency and chunking precision in LLM-based approaches, we devise the granularity-aware Mixture-of-Chunkers (MoC) framework, which consists of a three-stage processing mechanism. Notably, our objective is to guide the chunker towards generating a structured list of chunking regular expressions, which are subsequently employed to extract chunks from the... | Jihao Zhao, Zhiyuan Ji, Zhaoxin Fan, Hanyu Wang, Simin Niu, Bo Tang, Feiyu Xiong, Zhiyu Li |  |

This bias reduces the accuracy and reliability of LLM outputs, limiting their usefulness in decision-critical applications. While prior work has focused on adjusting model inputs or outputs to mitigate this issue, our work takes a fundamentally different approach by identifying and removing the internal sources of bias. We introduce two methods: Bias Node Pruning (BNP), which prunes parameters that contribute to selection bias, and Auxiliary Option Injection (AOI), which introduces an additional answer choice to reduce bias in both white-box and black-box settings. To address the shortcomings of existing evaluation metrics, we propose Choice Kullback-Leibler Divergence (CKLD), a new metric that captures distributional imbalances in model predictions.

It is usually implemented by first identifying the causal terms and then modifying these terms to create counterfactual candidates. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has effectively facilitated the task of counterfactual data augmentation. However, existing LLM-based approaches still face some challenges in 1) accurately extracting the task-specific causal terms, and 2) the quality of LLM-generated counterfacts. To address the issues, we propose a dually self-improved counterfactual data augmentation method using LLM for the Natural Language Inference (NLI) task. On the one hand, we design a self-improved strategy employing the attention distribution of the task model to identify the task-specific causal terms, which is lightweight and task-specific. On the other hand, a second self-improved... | Luhao Zhang, Xinyu Zhang, Linmei Hu, Dandan Song, Liqiang Nie |  |

Large language models (LLMs) struggle to evaluate the correctness of non-parametric knowledge retrieved externally when it differs from internal memorization, leading to knowledge conflicts during response generation. To this end, we introduce the \*\*R\*\*etrieval \*\*P\*\*reference \*\*O\*\*ptimization (RPO), a lightweight and effective alignment method to adaptively leverage multi-source knowledge based on retrieval relevance. An implicit representation of retrieval relevance is derived and incorporated into the reward model to integrate retrieval evaluation and response generation into a single model, solving the problem that previous methods necessitate the additional procedure to assess the retrieval quality. Notably, RPO is a RAG-dedicated alignment approach that quantifies the awareness of... | ShiQi Yan, Quan Liu, ZhenHua Ling |  |

Iterative interaction with the environment and feedback is often required to achieve success, making effective feedback utilization a critical topic. Existing approaches either struggle with length generalization or rely on naive retries without leveraging prior information. In this paper, we introduce FTTT, a novel paradigm that formulates feedback utilization as an optimization problem at test time. Additionally, we propose a learnable test-time optimizer, OpTune, to effectively exploit feedback. Experiments on two LLMs across four reasoning datasets demonstrate that FTTT and OpTune achieve superior scalability and performance. | Yanyang Li, Michael R. Lyu, Liwei Wang |  |

The success of LCMs is founded on the hypothesis that the model demonstrates strong fidelity, enabling it to respond based on the provided long context rather than relying solely on the intrinsic knowledge acquired during pre-training. Yet, in this paper, we find that open-sourced LCMs are not as faithful as expected. We introduce L-CiteEval, an out-of-the-box suite that can assess both generation quality and fidelity in long-context understanding tasks. It covers 11 tasks with context lengths ranging from 8K to 48K and a corresponding automatic evaluation pipeline. Evaluation of 11 cutting-edge closed-source and open-source LCMs indicates that, while there are minor differences in their generation, open-source models significantly lag behind closed-source counterparts in terms of fidelity. Furthermore, we analyze the benefits of citation generation... | Zecheng Tang, Keyan Zhou, Juntao Li, Baibei Ji, Jianye Hou, Min Zhang |  |

However, clinical trials are resource-intensive, time-consuming and expensive to conduct, where errors in trial design, reduced efficacy, and safety events can result in significant delays, financial losses, and damage to reputation. These risks underline the importance of informed and strategic decisions in trial design to mitigate these risks and improve the chances of a successful trial. Identifying similar historical trials is critical as these trials can provide an important reference for potential pitfalls and challenges including serious adverse events, dosage inaccuracies, recruitment difficulties, patient adherence issues, etc. Addressing these challenges in trial design can lead to development of more effective study protocols with optimized patient safety and trial efficiency.

That is, language, though seemingly high-dimensional, can be explained using relatively few degrees of freedom. An open question is whether contemporary language models (LMs) reflect the intrinsic simplicity of language that is enabled by compositionality. We take a geometric view of this problem by relating the degree of compositionality in a dataset to the intrinsic dimension (ID) of its representations under an LM, a measure of feature complexity. We find not only that the degree of dataset compositionality is reflected in representations’ ID, but that the relationship between compositionality and geometric complexity arises due to learned linguistic features over training. Finally, our analyses reveal a striking contrast between nonlinear and linear dimensionality, showing they respectively encode semantic and superficial aspects of linguistic... | Jin Hwa Lee, Thomas Jiralerspong, Lei Yu, Yoshua Bengio, Emily Cheng |  |

The Problem with Multiple-Choice Questions in Medicine](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.266/) |  | 0 | Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT demonstrate significant potential in the medical domain and are often evaluated using multiple-choice questions (MCQs) modeled on exams like the USMLE. However, such benchmarks may overestimate true clinical understanding by rewarding pattern recognition and test-taking heuristics. To investigate this, we created a fictional medical benchmark centered on an imaginary organ, the Glianorex, allowing us to separate memorized knowledge from reasoning ability. We generated textbooks and MCQs in English and French using leading LLMs, then evaluated proprietary, open-source, and domain-specific models in a zero-shot setting. Despite the fictional content, models achieved an average score of 64%, while physicians scored only 27%. Fine-tuned medical models outperformed base models in English but not in French. Ablation and interpretability analyses revealed that models frequently relied on shallow cues, test-taking strategies, and hallucinated... | Maxime Griot, Jean Vanderdonckt, Demet Yüksel, Coralie Hemptinne |  |

We hire annotators to read 300 non-fiction English articles, label them as either human-written or AI-generated, and provide paragraph-length explanations for their decisions. Our experiments show that annotators who frequently use LLMs for writing tasks excel at detecting AI-generated text, even without any specialized training or feedback. In fact, the majority vote among five such “expert” annotators misclassifies only 1 of 300 articles, significantly outperforming most commercial and open-source detectors we evaluated even in the presence of evasion tactics like paraphrasing and humanization. Qualitative analysis of the experts’ free-form explanations shows that while they rely heavily on specific lexical clues (‘AI vocabulary’), they also pick up on more complex phenomena within the text (e.g., formality, originality, clarity) that are challenging to assess for automatic... | Jenna Russell, Marzena Karpinska, Mohit Iyyer |  |

In this paper, we explore the key bottlenecks and designs during pre-training, and make the following contributions: (1) a comprehensive investigation into the factors contributing to training instability; (2) a robust optimization approach designed to mitigate training instability effectively; (3) an elaborate data pipeline that integrates data synthesis, data curriculum, and data selection. By integrating the above techniques, we create a rather low-cost training recipe and use it to pre-train YuLan-Mini, a fully-open base model with 2.4B parameters on 1.08T tokens. Remarkably, YuLan-Mini achieves top-tier performance among models of similar parameter scale, with comparable performance to industry-leading models that require significantly more data. To facilitate reproduction, we release the... | Yiwen Hu, Huatong Song, Jie Chen, Jia Deng, Jiapeng Wang, Kun Zhou, Yutao Zhu, Jinhao Jiang, Zican Dong, Yang Lu, Xu Miao, Xin Zhao, JiRong Wen |  |

We investigate the interplay and divergence among various metrics for assessing intrinsic difficulty, including annotator dissensus, training dynamics, and model confidence. Through a comprehensive analysis using 29 models on three datasets, we reveal that while correlations exist among these metrics, their relationships are neither linear nor monotonic. By disentangling these dimensions of uncertainty, we aim to refine our understanding of data complexity and its implications for evaluating and improving NLP models. | Timothee Mickus, Aman Sinha, Raúl Vázquez |  |

Most existing approaches to address these disparities rely on pretraining or fine-tuning, which are resource-intensive. To overcome these limitations without incurring significant costs, we propose Inference-Time Cross-Lingual Intervention (INCLINE), a novel framework that enhances LLM performance on low-performing (source) languages by aligning their internal representations with those of high-performing (target) languages during inference. INCLINE initially learns alignment matrices using parallel sentences from source and target languages through a Least-Squares optimization, and then applies these matrices during inference to transform the low-performing language representations toward the high-performing language space. Extensive experiments on nine benchmarks with five LLMs demonstrate that INCLINE significantly... | Weixuan Wang, Minghao Wu, Barry Haddow, Alexandra Birch |  |

In contrast, small language models (SLMs) are computationally efficient but often lack the broad generalization capacity of LLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose PiFi, a novel framework that combines the strengths of both LLMs and SLMs to achieve high performance while maintaining efficiency. PiFi integrates a single frozen layer from an LLM into a SLM and fine-tunes the combined model for specific tasks, boosting performance without a significant increase in computational cost. We show that PiFi delivers consistent performance improvements across a range of natural language processing tasks, including both natural language understanding and generation. Moreover, our findings demonstrate PiFi’s ability to effectively leverage LLM knowledge, enhancing generalization to... | Kyeonghyun Kim, Jinhee Jang, Juhwan Choi, Yoonji Lee, Kyohoon Jin, YoungBin Kim |  |

A Theory-Grounded, Expert-Annotated Interview Corpus for Demystifying Mental-Health Stigma](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.272/) |  | 0 | Mental-health stigma remains a pervasive social problem that hampers treatment-seeking and recovery. Existing resources for training neural models to finely classify such stigma are limited, relying primarily on social-media or synthetic data without theoretical underpinnings. To remedy this gap, we present an expert-annotated, theory-informed corpus of human-chatbot interviews, comprising 4,141 snippets from 684 participants with documented socio-cultural backgrounds. Our experiments benchmark state-of-the-art neural models and empirically unpack the challenges of stigma detection. This dataset can facilitate research on computationally detecting, neutralizing, and counteracting mental-health stigma.

However, existing ML-ATR schemes suffer from inconsistencies for instance similarity matching across languages. To address the inconsistency issue in multilingual audio-text retrieval, we first identify two intuitive factors that contribute to inconsistency: misalignment between audio and multilingual text embeddings, and error propagation in model optimization. By systematically analyzing these factors, we derive theoretical weight error upper bounds for quantifying their effects and find that the main source of inconsistency is the data distribution error during training. This finding motivates our solution to reduce data distribution errors.We propose a consistent ML-ATR scheme using 1-to-k contrastive learning and audio-English co-anchor contrastive learning, aiming to mitigate the negative impact of data distribution error on recall and... | Yuguo Yin, Yuxin Xie, Wenyuan Yang, Dongchao Yang, Jinghan Ru, Xianwei Zhuang, Liming Liang, Yuexian Zou |  |

This paper studies the generalizable first-order logical reasoning ability of transformers with their \*parameterized\* knowledge and how to improve it. Transformers’ capability of first-order reasoning is further captured by whether they can conduct first-order logical entailment, which is quantitatively measured by their performance in answering knowledge graph queries. We establish the connections between (1) two types of distribution shifts studied in out-of-distribution generalization and (2) unseen knowledge and query settings discussed in the task of knowledge graph query answering, which makes it possible to characterize the fine-grained generalizability. Results on our comprehensive dataset showed that transformers \*\*outperform\*\* previous methods designed particularly for this task and provided detailed empirical evidence about the impact of the input query... | Tianshi Zheng, Jiazheng Wang, Zihao Wang, Jiaxin Bai, Hang Yin, Zheye Deng, Yangqiu Song, Jianxin Li |  |

We propose Agentic Long-Context Understanding (AgenticLU), a framework designed to enhance an LLM’s understanding of such queries by integrating targeted self-clarification with contextual grounding within an agentic workflow. At the core of AgenticLU is Chain-of-Clarifications (CoC), where models refine their understanding through self-generated clarification questions and corresponding contextual groundings. By scaling inference as a tree search where each node represents a CoC step, we achieve 97.8% answer recall on NarrativeQA with a search depth of up to three and a branching factor of eight. To amortize the high cost of this search process to training, we leverage the preference pairs for each step obtained by the CoC workflow and perform two-stage model finetuning: (1) supervised finetuning to learn... | Yufan Zhuang, Xiaodong Yu, Jialian Wu, Ximeng Sun, Ze Wang, Jiang Liu, Yusheng Su, Jingbo Shang, Zicheng Liu, Emad Barsoum |  |

Our research investigates the relationship between the uncertainty in training dynamics and the emergence of hallucinations. Using models from the Pythia suite and several hallucination detection metrics, we analyze hallucination trends and identify significant variance during training. To address this, we propose Sensitivity Dropout (SenD), a novel training protocol designed to reduce hallucination variance during training by deterministically dropping embedding indices with significant variability. In addition, we develop an unsupervised hallucination detection metric, Efficient EigenScore (EES), which approximates the traditional EigenScore in 2x speed. This metric is integrated into our training protocol, allowing SenD to be both computationally scalable and effective at reducing hallucination... | Shahrad Mohammadzadeh, Juan David Guerra, Marco Bonizzato, Reihaneh Rabbany, Golnoosh Farnadi |  |

Despite their utility in advancing digital automation, the development of such agents faces a critical bottleneck: collecting high-quality trajectory data for training. Common practices for collecting such data rely on human supervision or synthetic data generation through executing pre-defined tasks, which are either resource-intensive or unable to guarantee data quality. Further, these approaches exhibit significant gaps between the generated data and online environments, alongside limited data diversity. To address this issue, we introduce OS-Genesis, a novel GUI data synthesis pipeline that overcomes the challenges above. Unlike prior methods that rely on preset tasks, OS-Genesis reverse engineers the GUI trajectory construction process. Agents first perceive environments and perform step-level interactions, then retrospectively derive... | Qiushi Sun, Kanzhi Cheng, Zichen Ding, Chuanyang Jin, Yian Wang, Fangzhi Xu, Zhenyu Wu, Chengyou Jia, Liheng Chen, Zhoumianze Liu, Ben Kao, Guohao Li, Junxian He, Yu Qiao, Zhiyong Wu |  |

However, existing designs suffers in performance due to misalignment between training and inference. Recent methods have tried to solve this issue by adopting a multi-step training strategy, but the complex inputs of different training steps make it harder for the draft model to converge. To address this, we propose CORAL, a novel framework that improves both accuracy and efficiency in speculative drafting. CORAL introduces Cross-Step Representation Alignment, a method that enhances consistency across multiple training steps, significantly improving speculative drafting performance. Additionally, we identify the LM head as a major bottleneck in the inference speed of the draft model. We introduce a weight-grouping mechanism that selectively activates a subset of LM head parameters during inference, substantially reducing the latency of... | Yepeng Weng, Dianwen Mei, Huishi Qiu, Xujie Chen, Li Liu, Jiang Tian, Zhongchao Shi |  |

Evaluating such explanations is very difficult, as it includes not only the quality of the induced space of possible concepts but also how effectively the chosen concepts are communicated to users. Existing evaluation metrics often focus solely on the former, neglecting the latter.We introduce an evaluation framework for measuring concept explanations via automated simulatability: a simulator’s ability to predict the explained model’s outputs based on the provided explanations. This approach accounts for both the concept space and its interpretation in an end-to-end evaluation. Human studies for simulatability are notoriously difficult to enact, particularly at the scale of a wide, comprehensive empirical evaluation (which is the subject of this work). We propose using large language models (LLMs) as simulators to approximate the evaluation and report various analyses to make such... | Antonin Poché, Alon Jacovi, Agustin Martin Picard, Victor Boutin, Fanny Jourdan |  |

Can these goals be decoded from their eye movements over the text? In this work, we examine for the first time whether it is possible to distinguish between two types of common reading goals: information seeking and ordinary reading for comprehension. Using large-scale eye tracking data, we address this task with a wide range of models that cover different architectural and data representation strategies, and further introduce a new model ensemble. We find that transformer-based models with scanpath representations coupled with language modeling solve it most successfully, and that accurate predictions can be made in real time, shortly after the participant started reading the text. We further introduce a new method for model performance analysis based on mixed effect modeling. Combining this method with rich textual annotations reveals key properties of textual items and participants that contribute to... | Omer Shubi, Cfir Avraham Hadar, Yevgeni Berzak |  |

It is little surprise that computational methods that estimate them do so using parallel visual and semantic spaces, such as collections of image-caption pairs or multi-modal models. In this paper, we work on the supposition that text itself in an image-caption dataset offers sufficient signals to accurately estimate these properties. We hypothesize, in particular, that the peakedness of the neighborhood of a word in the semantic embedding space reflects its degree of imageability and concreteness. We then propose an unsupervised, distribution-free measure, which we call Neighborhood Stability Measure (NSM), that quantifies the sharpness of peaks. Extensive experiments show that NSM correlates more strongly with ground-truth ratings than existing unsupervised methods, and is a strong predictor of these properties... | Si Wu, Sebastian Bruch |  |

MLLMs suffer from two key issues: misinterpreting UI components and outdated knowledge. Traditional fine-tuning methods are costly for app-specific knowledge updates. We propose GUI-explorer, a training-free GUI agent that incorporates two fundamental mechanisms: (1) Autonomous Exploration of Function-aware Trajectory. To comprehensively cover all application functionalities, we design a Function-aware Task Goal Generator that automatically constructs exploration goals by analyzing GUI structural information (e.g., screenshots and activity hierarchies). This enables systematic exploration to collect diverse trajectories. (2) Unsupervised Mining of Transition-aware Knowledge. To establish precise screen-operation logic, we develop a Transition-aware Knowledge Extractor that extracts effective screen-operation logic through unsupervised analysis the state transition of structured interaction triples (observation, action,... | Bin Xie, Rui Shao, Gongwei Chen, Kaiwen Zhou, Yinchuan Li, Jie Liu, Min Zhang, Liqiang Nie |  |

To recover model performance after pruning, post-training is commonly employed to mitigate the resulting performance degradation. While post-training benefits from larger datasets, once the dataset size is already substantial, increasing the training data provides only limited performance gains. To balance post-training cost and model performance, it is necessary to explore the optimal amount of post-training data. Through extensive experiments on the Llama-3 and Qwen-2.5 series models, pruned using various common pruning methods, we uncover the scaling Law for Post-training after model Pruning, referred to as the P2 Law. This law identifies four key factors for predicting the pruned model’s post-training loss: the model size before pruning, the number of post-training tokens, the pruning rate, and the model’s loss before pruning. Moreover, P2 Law can generalize to... | Xiaodong Chen, Yuxuan Hu, Xiaokang Zhang, Yanling Wang, Cuiping Li, Hong Chen, Jing Zhang |  |

Happen: Finding Emergent Dog Whistles Through Common Habitats](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.284/) |  | 0 | Dog whistles are coded expressions with dual meanings: one intended for the general public (outgroup) and another that conveys a specific message to an intended audience (ingroup). Often, these expressions are used to convey controversial political opinions while maintaining plausible deniability and slip by content moderation filters. Identification of dog whistles relies on curated lexicons, which have trouble keeping up to date. We introduce FETCH!, a task for finding novel dog whistles in massive social media corpora. We find that state-of-the-art systems fail to achieve meaningful results across three distinct social media case studies. We present EarShot, a strong baseline system that combines the strengths of vector databases and Large Language Models (LLMs) to efficiently and effectively identify new dog whistles. | Kuleen Sasse, Carlos Alejandro Aguirre, Isabel Cachola, Sharon Levy, Mark Dredze |  |

It plays a crucial role in aligning RLHF with human preferences. Although the current RM training paradigm concatenates the context and response while amplifying the reward difference between good and bad response pairs, we demonstrate that the RM faces two significant issues: i) it often allocates only a small proportion of attention to the context, and ii) it frequently ignores segments of the context that are relevant for evaluating the response quality. These issues undermine the RM’s effectiveness in modeling human preferences. To further address these challenges, we propose AttnRM, a novel optimization framework that enables the RM to concentrate on crucial segments of the context. Experimental results demonstrate that AttnRM significantly improves preference modeling by increasing attention to relevant information within the... | Shihan Dou, Jiayi Chen, Chenhao Huang, Feng Chen, Wei Chengzhi, Huiyuan Zheng, Shichun Liu, Yan Liu, Chenxiao Liu, Chao Xin, Lin Yan, Zongzhang Zhang, Tao Gui, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang |  |

To address this, we propose the Entailment-Preserving FOL representations (EPF) task and introduce reference-free evaluation metrics for EPF (Entailment-Preserving Rate (EPR) family). In EPF, one should generate FOL representations from multi-premise NL entailment data (e.g., EntailmentBank) so that the automatic prover’s result preserves the entailment labels. Furthermore, we propose a training method specialized for the task, iterative learning-to-rank, which trains an NL-to-FOL translator by using the natural language entailment labels as verifiable rewards. Our method achieves a 1.8–2.7% improvement in EPR and a 17.4–20.6% increase in EPR@16 compared to diverse baselines in three datasets. Further analyses reveal that iterative learning-to-rank effectively suppresses the arbitrariness of FOL representation by reducing the diversity... | Jinu Lee, Qi Liu, Runzhi Ma, Vincent Han, Ziqi Wang, Heng Ji, Julia Hockenmaier |  |

Existing approaches often rely on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LoRA framework to preserve previous instruction alignments. However, these methods are prone to Catastrophic Forgetting (CF), as they aggregate all LoRA blocks via simple summation, which compromises performance over time. In this paper, we identify a critical parameter inefficiency in the MoELoRA framework within the MCIT context. Based on this insight, we propose BranchLoRA, an asymmetric framework to enhance both efficiency and performance. To mitigate CF, we introduce a flexible tuning-freezing mechanism within BranchLoRA, enabling branches to specialize in intra-task knowledge while fostering inter-task collaboration. Moreover, we incrementally incorporate task-specific routers to ensure an optimal branch distribution over time, rather than favoring... | Duzhen Zhang, Yong Ren, ZhongZhi Li, Yahan Yu, Jiahua Dong, Chenxing Li, Zhilong Ji, Jinfeng Bai |  |

These descriptions are derived using inputs that activate the feature, which may be a dimension or a direction in the model’s representation space. However, identifying activating inputs is costly, and the mechanistic role of a feature in model behavior is determined both by how inputs cause a feature to activate and by how feature activation affects outputs. Using steering evaluations, we reveal that current pipelines provide descriptions that fail to capture the causal effect of the feature on outputs. To fix this, we propose efficient, output-centric methods for automatically generating feature descriptions. These methods use the tokens weighted higher after feature stimulation or the highest weight tokens after applying the vocabulary “unembedding” head directly to the feature.

In this paper, we comprehensively study its key designs to balance the new abilities while retaining the original abilities, and present an effective CPT method that can greatly improve the Chinese language ability and scientific reasoning ability of LLMs. To achieve it, we design specific data mixture and curriculum strategies based on existing datasets and synthetic high-quality data. Concretely, we synthesize multidisciplinary scientific QA pairs based on related web pages to guarantee the data quality, and also devise the performance tracking and data mixture adjustment strategy to ensure the training stability. For the detailed designs, we conduct preliminary studies on a relatively small model, and summarize the findings to help optimize our CPT method.

The previous methods achieve high attack performance while being too cumbersome and time-consuming. Also, they have concentrated solely on optimization algorithms, overlooking the crucial role of the prompt. To this end, we propose a method called POUGH that incorporates an efficient optimization algorithm and two semantics-guided prompt organization strategies. Specifically, our method starts with a sampling strategy to select representative prompts from a candidate pool, followed by a ranking strategy that prioritizes them. Given the sequentially ranked prompts, our method employs an iterative optimization algorithm to generate a fixed suffix that can concatenate to arbitrary user prompts for universal goal hijacking. Experiments conducted on four popular LLMs and ten types of target responses verified the effectiveness. | Yihao Huang, Chong Wang, Xiaojun Jia, Qing Guo, Felix JuefeiXu, Jian Zhang, Yang Liu, Geguang Pu |  |

However, this comes at the cost of generating thousands of visual tokens for a single document image, leading to excessive GPU memory and slower inference times, particularly in multi-page document comprehension. In this work, to address these challenges, we propose a High-resolution DocCompressor module to compress each high-resolution document image into 324 tokens, guided by low-resolution global visual features. With this compression module, to strengthen multi-page document comprehension ability and balance both token efficiency and question-answering performance, we develop the DocOwl2 under a three-stage training framework: Single-image Pretraining, Multi-image Continue-pretraining, and Multi-task Finetuning.

However, there is limited conceptual consensus on what exactly quantifies natural language prompts. We attempt to address this question by conducting a meta-analysis surveying 150+ prompting-related papers from leading NLP and AI conferences (2022–2024), and blogs. We propose a property- and human-centric framework for evaluating prompt quality, encompassing 21 properties categorized into six dimensions. We then examine how existing studies assess their impact on LLMs, revealing their imbalanced support across models and tasks, and substantial research gaps. Further, we analyze correlations among properties in high-quality natural language prompts, deriving prompting recommendations. Finally, we explore multi-property prompt enhancements in reasoning tasks, observing that single-property enhancements often have the greatest... | Do Xuan Long, Duy Dinh, NgocHai Nguyen, Kenji Kawaguchi, Nancy F.

The traditional setting limits each participant to one message at a time and requires constant human participation. This fails to reflect a natural conversational style and hinders the evaluation of dialogue agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex and prolonged interactions. This paper proposes X-Turing, which enhances the original test with a burst dialogue pattern, allowing more dynamic exchanges using consecutive messages. It further reduces human workload by iteratively generating dialogues that simulate the long-term interaction between the agent and a human to compose the majority of the test process. With the pseudo-dialogue history, the agent then engages in a shorter dialogue with a real human, which is paired with a human-human conversation on the same topic to be judged using questionnaires. We introduce the X-Turn Pass-Rate metric to assess the human... | Weiqi Wu, Hongqiu Wu, Hai Zhao |  |

Understanding Multilingual Moral Reasoning as a Computational Pipeline with UniMoral](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.294/) |  | 0 | Moral reasoning is a complex cognitive process shaped by individual experiences and cultural contexts and presents unique challenges for computational analysis. While natural language processing (NLP) offers promising tools for studying this phenomenon, current research lacks cohesion, employing discordant datasets and tasks that examine isolated aspects of moral reasoning. We bridge this gap with UniMoral, a unified dataset integrating psychologically grounded and social-media-derived moral dilemmas annotated with labels for action choices, ethical principles, contributing factors, and consequences, alongside annotators’ moral and cultural profiles. Recognizing the cultural relativity of moral reasoning, UniMoral spans six languages, Arabic, Chinese, English, Hindi, Russian, and Spanish, capturing diverse socio-cultural contexts. We demonstrate UniMoral’s utility through a benchmark evaluations of three large language models (LLMs) across four tasks: action prediction, moral typology... | Shivani Kumar, David Jurgens |  |

While some prior works have explored this issue in the context of LLMs, it presents a unique challenge for MLLMs due to the entangled nature of knowledge across modalities, making comprehensive unlearning more difficult. To address this challenge, we propose Modality Aware Neuron Unlearning (MANU), a novel unlearning framework for MLLMs designed to selectively clip neurons based on their relative importance to the targeted forget data, curated for different modalities. Specifically, MANU consists of two stages: important neuron selection and selective pruning. The first stage identifies and collects the most influential neurons across modalities relative to the targeted forget knowledge, while the second stage is dedicated to pruning those selected... | Zheyuan Liu, Guangyao Dou, Xiangchi Yuan, Chunhui Zhang, Zhaoxuan Tan, Meng Jiang |  |

Nutrition Question Answering (QA) has emerged as a popular method for addressing this problem. However, current research faces two critical limitations. On one hand, the absence of datasets involving user-specific medical information severely limits personalization. This challenge is further compounded by the wide variability in individual health needs. On the other hand, while large language models (LLMs), a popular solution for this task, demonstrate strong reasoning abilities, they struggle with the domain-specific complexities of personalized healthy dietary reasoning, and existing benchmarks fail to capture these challenges. To address these gaps, we introduce the Nutritional Graph Question Answering (NGQA) benchmark, the first graph question answering dataset designed for personalized nutritional health reasoning.

However, this paradigm disrupts the subsequent tokens prediction, degrading model performance and linguistic coherence. Moreover, existing evaluation metrics overemphasize contextual forgetting while inadequately assessing response fluency and relevance. To address these challenges, we propose ReLearn, a data augmentation and fine-tuning pipeline for effective unlearning, along with a comprehensive evaluation framework. This framework introduces Knowledge Forgetting Ratio (KFR) and Knowledge Retention Ratio (KRR) to measure knowledge-level preservation, and Linguistic Score (LS) to evaluate generation quality. Our experiments show that ReLearn successfully achieves targeted forgetting while preserving high-quality outputs. Through mechanistic analysis, we further demonstrate how reverse optimization disrupts coherent text generation, while ReLearn preserves... | Haoming Xu, Ningyuan Zhao, Liming Yang, Sendong Zhao, Shumin Deng, Mengru Wang, Bryan Hooi, Nay Oo, Huajun Chen, Ningyu Zhang |  |

We address this challenge by formally introducing domain adaptation for low-resource topic modeling, where a high-resource source domain informs a low-resource target domain without overwhelming it with irrelevant content. We establish a finite-sample generalization bound showing that effective knowledge transfer depends on robust performance in both domains, minimizing latent-space discrepancy, and preventing overfitting to the data. Guided by these insights, we propose DALTA (Domain-Aligned Latent Topic Adaptation), a new framework that employs a shared encoder for domain-invariant features, specialized decoders for domain-specific nuances, and adversarial alignment to selectively transfer relevant information. Experiments on diverse low-resource... | Pritom Saha Akash, Kevin ChenChuan Chang |  |

To improve LLMs’ factual expressions, we propose the UAlign framework, which leverages Uncertainty estimations to represent knowledge boundaries, and then explicitly incorporates these representations as input features into prompts for LLMs to Align with factual knowledge. First, we prepare the dataset on knowledge question-answering (QA) samples by calculating two uncertainty estimations, including confidence score and semantic entropy, to represent the knowledge boundaries for LLMs. Subsequently, using the prepared dataset, we train a reward model that incorporates uncertainty estimations and then employ the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm for factuality alignment on LLMs. Experimental results indicate that, by integrating uncertainty... | Boyang Xue, Fei Mi, Qi Zhu, Hongru Wang, Rui Wang, Sheng Wang, Erxin Yu, Xuming Hu, KamFai Wong |  |

With the observation that the reasoning path can be easily compressed under easy tasks but struggle on hard tasks, we explore the feasibility of elastically controlling the length of reasoning paths with only one model, thereby reducing the inference overhead of reasoning models dynamically based on task difficulty. We introduce a new tuning and inference strategy named CoT-Valve, designed to allow models to generate reasoning chains of varying lengths. To achieve this, we propose to identify a direction in the parameter space that, when manipulated, can effectively control the length of generated CoT. Moreover, we show that this property is valuable for compressing the reasoning chain. We construct datasets with chains from long to short for the same questions and explore two enhanced strategies for CoT-Valve: (1) a precise... | Xinyin Ma, Guangnian Wan, Runpeng Yu, Gongfan Fang, Xinchao Wang |  |

Current research primarily focuses on incorporating up-to-date information, yet the impact of outdated information coexisting in retrieval sources remains inadequately addressed. To bridge this gap, we introduce HoH, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the impact of outdated information on RAG. Our benchmark leverages token-level diff algorithms combined with LLM pipelines to efficiently create a large-scale QA dataset that accurately captures the evolution of temporal knowledge in real-world facts.Through comprehensive experiments, we reveal that outdated information significantly degrades RAG performance in two critical ways: (1) it substantially reduces response accuracy by distracting models from correct... | Jie Ouyang, Tingyue Pan, Mingyue Cheng, Ruiran Yan, Yucong Luo, Jiaying Lin, Qi Liu |  |

However, their outputs often lack reliability, making uncertainty estimation crucial. Existing uncertainty estimation methods primarily focus on final-step outputs, which fail to account for cumulative uncertainty over the multi-step decision-making process and the dynamic interactions between agents and their environments. To address these limitations, we propose SAUP (Situation Awareness Uncertainty Propagation), a novel framework that propagates uncertainty through each step of an LLM-based agent’s reasoning process. SAUP incorporates situational awareness by assigning situational weights to each step’s uncertainty during the propagation. Our method, compatible with various one-step uncertainty estimation techniques, provides a comprehensive and accurate uncertainty measure. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SAUP... | Qiwei Zhao, Dong Li, Yanchi Liu, Wei Cheng, Yiyou Sun, Mika Oishi, Takao Osaki, Katsushi Matsuda, Huaxiu Yao, Chen Zhao, Haifeng Chen, Xujiang Zhao |  |

Through an analysis spanning model scales, architectures, and training checkpoints, we show that attention heads evolve to implement multi-resolution processing analogous to wavelet transforms. We demonstrate that this scale-invariant behavior is unique to RoPE, emerges through distinct evolutionary phases during training, and statistically adheres to the fundamental uncertainty principle. Our findings suggest that the effectiveness of modern Transformers stems from their remarkable ability to spontaneously develop optimal, multi-resolution decompositions to address inherent architectural constraints. | Valeria Ruscio, Umberto Nanni, Fabrizio Silvestri |  |

Testing the Limits of Factuality-Encoding Capabilities in LLMs](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.304/) |  | 0 | Factual hallucinations are a major challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). They undermine reliability and user trust by generating inaccurate or fabricated content. Recent studies suggest that when generating false statements, the internal states of LLMs encode information about truthfulness. However, these studies often rely on synthetic datasets that lack realism, which limits generalization when evaluating the factual accuracy of text generated by the model itself. In this paper, we challenge the findings of previous work by investigating truthfulness encoding capabilities, leading to the generation of a more realistic and challenging dataset. Specifically, we extend previous work by introducing: (1) a strategy for sampling plausible true-false factoid sentences from tabular data and (2) a procedure for generating realistic, LLM-dependent true-false datasets from Question Answering collections. Our analysis of two open-source LLMs reveals that while the findings from previous... | Giovanni Servedio, Alessandro De Bellis, Dario Di Palma, Vito Walter Anelli, Tommaso Di Noia |  |

However, these models often inherit biased knowledge, resulting in unfair decisions in sensitive applications. It is challenging to remove this biased knowledge without compromising reasoning abilities due to the entangled nature of the learned knowledge within LLMs. To solve this problem, existing approaches have attempted to mitigate the bias using techniques such as fine-tuning with unbiased datasets, model merging, and gradient ascent. While these methods have experimentally proven effective, they can still be sub-optimum in fully disentangling biases from reasoning. To address this gap, we propose Selective Disentanglement Unlearning (SDU), a novel unlearning framework that selectively removes biased knowledge while preserving reasoning capabilities. SDU operates in three stages:... | Zheyuan Liu, Suraj Maharjan, Fanyou Wu, Rahil Parikh, Belhassen Bayar, Srinivasan H. Sengamedu, Meng Jiang |  |

However, we still have a limited understanding of how these models capture sentiment-related information. This study probes the hidden layers of LLaMA models to pinpoint where sentiment features are most represented and to assess how this affects sentiment analysis.Using probe classifiers, we analyze sentiment encoding across layers and scales, identifying the layers and pooling methods that best capture sentiment signals. Our results show that sentiment information is most concentrated in mid-layers for binary polarity tasks, with detection accuracy increasing up to 14% over prompting techniques. Additionally, we find that in decoder-only models, the last token is not consistently the most informative for sentiment encoding. Finally, this approach enables sentiment tasks to be performed with memory... | Dario Di Palma, Alessandro De Bellis, Giovanni Servedio, Vito Walter Anelli, Fedelucio Narducci, Tommaso Di Noia |  |

Current GEC methods primarily rely on grammatical labels for syntactic information, often overlooking the inherent usage patterns of language. In this work, we explore the potential of construction grammar (CxG) to improve GEC by leveraging constructions to capture underlying language patterns and guide corrections. We first establish a comprehensive construction inventory from corpora. Next, we introduce a construction prediction model that identifies potential constructions in ungrammatical sentences using a noise-tolerant language model. Finally, we train a CxGGEC model on construction-masked parallel data, which performs GEC by decoding construction tokens into their original forms and correcting erroneous tokens. Extensive experiments on English and Chinese GEC benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. | Yayu Cao, Tianxiang Wang, Lvxiaowei Xu, Zhenyao Wang, Ming Cai |  |

Inspired by natural language processing, mainstream code generation approaches represent code as a linear sequence of tokens. In this paper, we propose to represent code snippets as two-dimensional entities, where both code lines and tokens within lines are explicitly modeled. This representation allows us to capture the hierarchical and spatial structure of code, especially the dependencies between code lines. Our method CoDE introduces a dependency encoding approach that leverages dictionary learning to perform semantic matching between code lines. As such, it avoids the reliance on strict position indices, leading to better generalization to code with diverse context and lengths. We thoroughly evaluate CoDE based on four categories of tasks. The experimental results showcase its generalizability, context understanding and retrieval, as well as... | Xiangyu Zhang, Yu Zhou, Guang Yang, Wei Cheng, Taolue Chen |  |

Although current classification-based methods, such as SAPLMA, are highly efficient in mitigating hallucinations, they struggle when non-factual information arises in the early or mid-sequence of outputs, reducing their reliability. To address these issues, we propose Hallucination Detection-Neural Differential Equations (HD-NDEs), a novel method that systematically assesses the truthfulness of statements by capturing the full dynamics of LLMs within their latent space. Our approaches apply neural differential equations (Neural DEs) to model the dynamic system in the latent space of LLMs. Then, the sequence in the latent space is mapped to the classification space for truth assessment. The extensive experiments across five datasets and six widely used LLMs demonstrate... | Qing Li, Jiahui Geng, Zongxiong Chen, Derui Zhu, Yuxia Wang, Congbo Ma, Chenyang Lyu, Fakhri Karray |  |

This paper introduces VISTA, a dataset specifically designed for video-to-text summarization in scientific domains. VISTA contains 18,599 recorded AI conference presentations paired with their corresponding paper abstracts. We benchmark the performance of state-of-the-art large models and apply a plan-based framework to better capture the structured nature of abstracts. Both human and automated evaluations confirm that explicit planning enhances summary quality and factual consistency. However, a considerable gap remains between models and human performance, highlighting the challenges of our dataset. This study aims to pave the way for future research on scientific video-to-text summarization. | Dongqi Liu, Chenxi Whitehouse, Xi Yu, Louis Mahon, Rohit Saxena, Zheng Zhao, Yifu Qiu, Mirella Lapata, Vera Demberg |  |

While retrieval augmented generation (RAG) shows great promise in large language model (LLM) based automated question answering, previous works often isolate neural and symbolic retrieval despite their complementary strengths. Moreover, conventional single-view chunking neglects the rich structure and layout of PDFs, e.g., sections and tables. In this work, we propose NeuSym-RAG, a hybrid neural symbolic retrieval framework which combines both paradigms in an interactive process. By leveraging multi-view chunking and schema-based parsing, NeuSym-RAG organizes semi-structured PDF content into both the relational database and vectorstore, enabling LLM agents to iteratively gather context until sufficient to generate answers. Experiments on three full PDF-based QA datasets, including a self-annotated one AirQA-Real, show that NeuSym-RAG stably defeats both the... | Ruisheng Cao, Hanchong Zhang, Tiancheng Huang, Zhangyi Kang, Yuxin Zhang, Liangtai Sun, Hanqi Li, Yuxun Miao, Shuai Fan, Lu Chen, Kai Yu |  |

However, this process is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and costly, especially when a contract faces multiple rounds of review. To accelerate the contract review and promote the completion of transactions, this paper introduces a novel benchmark of legal provision recommendation and conflict detection for contract auto-reviewing (ProvBench), which aims to recommend the legal provisions related to contract clauses and detect possible legal conflicts. Specifically, we construct the first Legal Provision Recommendation Dataset: ProvData, which covers 8 common contract types. In addition, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate ProvBench on various state-of-the-art models. Experimental results validate the feasibility of ProvBench and demonstrate the effectiveness of ProvData. Finally, we identify potential challenges in the ProvBench and advocate for further investigation. | Xiuxuan Shen, Zhongyuan Jiang, Junsan Zhang, Junxiao Han, Yao Wan, Chengjie Guo, Bingcheng Liu, Jie Wu, Renxiang Li, Philip S.

Without requiring complex designs such as duration model, text encoder, and phoneme alignment, the text input is simply padded with filler tokens to the same length as input speech, and then the denoising is performed for speech generation, which was originally proved feasible by E2 TTS. However, the original design of E2 TTS makes it hard to follow due to its slow convergence and low robustness. To address these issues, we first model the input with ConvNeXt to refine the text representation, making it easy to align with the speech. We further propose an inference-time Sway Sampling strategy, which significantly improves our model’s performance and efficiency. This sampling strategy for flow step can be easily applied to existing flow matching based models without retraining. Our design allows faster training and achieves an inference RTF of 0.15,... | Yushen Chen, Zhikang Niu, Ziyang Ma, Keqi Deng, Chunhui Wang, Jian Zhao, Kai Yu, Xie Chen |  |

However, traditional metrics like F1 and ROUGE, which rely on token overlaps to measure quality, significantly overlook the importance of medical terminology. While human evaluation tends to be more reliable, it can be very costly and may as well suffer from inaccuracies due to limits in human expertise and motivation. Although there are some evaluation methods based on LLMs, their usability in the medical field is limited due to their proprietary nature or lack of expertise. To tackle these challenges, we present AutoMedEval, an open-sourced automatic evaluation model with 13B parameters specifically engineered to measure the question-answering proficiency of medical LLMs. The overarching objective of AutoMedEval is to assess the quality of responses produced by diverse models, aspiring to significantly reduce the... | Xiechi Zhang, Zetian Ouyang, Linlin Wang, Gerard de Melo, Zhu Cao, Xiaoling Wang, Ya Zhang, Yanfeng Wang, Liang He |  |

However, these methods rely heavily on the quality of candidate responses and are unable to produce correct answers when all candidates are incorrect. In this paper, we propose a novel inference scaling strategy, CoT-based Synthesizer, which leverages CoT reasoning to synthesize superior answers by analyzing complementary information from multiple candidate responses, even when all candidates are flawed. To support a lightweight and cost-effective implementation, we introduce an automated data generation pipeline that creates diverse training data. This enables smaller LLMs trained on this data to improve the inference accuracy of larger models, including API-based LLMs. Experimental results across four benchmark datasets with seven policy models demonstrate that our method significantly enhances performance, with gains of 11.8%... | Bohan Zhang, Xiaokang Zhang, Jing Zhang, Jifan Yu, Sijia Luo, Jie Tang |  |

While existing watermarking detection techniques primarily focus on classifying entire documents as watermarked or not, they often neglect the common scenario of identifying individual watermark segments within longer, mixed-source documents. Drawing inspiration from plagiarism detection systems, we propose two novel methods for partial watermark detection. First, we develop a geometry cover detection framework aimed at determining whether there is a watermark segment in long text. Second, we introduce an adaptive online learning algorithm to pinpoint the precise location of watermark segments within the text. Evaluated on three popular watermarking techniques (KGW-Watermark, Unigram-Watermark, and Gumbel-Watermark), our approach achieves high accuracy, significantly outperforming baseline methods. Moreover, our framework is... | Xuandong Zhao, Chenwen Liao, Yuxiang Wang, Lei Li |  |

While benchmarks, including those designed for multiple languages, are often used as proxies to evaluate the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), they tend to overlook the nuances of within-language variation and thus fail to model the experience of speakers of non-standard dialects. Focusing on African American Vernacular English (AAVE), we present the first study aimed at objectively assessing the fairness and robustness of LLMs in handling dialects across canonical reasoning tasks, including algorithm, math, logic, and integrated reasoning. We introduce \*\*ReDial\*\* (\*\*Re\*\*asoning with \*\*Dial\*\*ect Queries), a benchmark containing 1.2K+ parallel query pairs in Standardized English and AAVE.

Traditional OpenRE methods typically assume that the unlabeled data consists solely of novel relations or is pre-divided into known and novel instances. However, in real-world scenarios, novel relations are arbitrarily distributed. In this paper, we propose a generalized OpenRE setting that considers unlabeled data as a mixture of both known and novel instances. To address this, we propose MixORE, a two-phase framework that integrates relation classification and clustering to jointly learn known and novel relations. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that MixORE consistently outperforms competitive baselines in known relation classification and novel relation clustering. Our findings contribute to the advancement of generalized OpenRE research and real-world applications. | Qing Wang, Yuepei Li, Qiao Qiao, Kang Zhou, Qi Li |  |

Bringing Uncertainty Back Home](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.319/) |  | 0 | Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) improves correctness of Question Answering (QA) and addresses hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs), yet greatly increase computational costs. Besides, RAG is not always needed as may introduce irrelevant information. Recent adaptive retrieval methods integrate LLMs’ intrinsic knowledge with external information appealing to LLM self-knowledge, but they often neglect efficiency evaluations and comparisons with uncertainty estimation techniques. We bridge this gap by conducting a comprehensive analysis of 35 adaptive retrieval methods, including 8 recent approaches and 27 uncertainty estimation techniques, across 6 datasets using 10 metrics for QA performance, self-knowledge, and efficiency. Our findings show that uncertainty estimation techniques often outperform complex pipelines in terms of efficiency and self-knowledge, while maintaining comparable QA performance. | Viktor Moskvoretskii, Maria Marina, Mikhail Salnikov, Nikolay Ivanov, Sergey Pletenev, Daria Galimzianova, Nikita Krayko, Vasily Konovalov, Irina Nikishina, Alexander Panchenko |  |

While prior works have focused on developing effective data generation methods, they lack systematic comparison of different LMs as data generators in a unified setting. To address this gap, we propose AgoraBench, a benchmark that provides standardized settings and metrics to evaluate LMs’ data generation abilities. Through synthesizing 1.26 million training instances using 6 LMs and training 99 student models, we uncover key insights about LMs’ data generation capabilities. First, we observe that LMs exhibit distinct strengths. For instance, GPT-4o excels at generating new problems, while Claude-3.5-Sonnet performs better at enhancing existing ones. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that an LM’s data generation ability doesn’t necessarily correlate with its problem-solving ability.... | Seungone Kim, Juyoung Suk, Xiang Yue, Vijay Viswanathan, Seongyun Lee, Yizhong Wang, Kiril Gashteovski, Carolin Lawrence, Sean Welleck, Graham Neubig |  |

Among these reasoning tasks, graph problems stand out due to their complexity and unique structural characteristics, attracting considerable attention from researchers. Previous studies have explored LLMs’ graph reasoning abilities through various techniques, such as different encoding methods for graph structures and the use of carefully designed prompts. However, a critical factor has been mostly overlooked: the prompt sequential order in which graph descriptions are presented to the models. In this study, we present the first comprehensive analysis of how the order of graph descriptions impacts LLM performance. Specifically, we comprehensively evaluate four graph description orders across six graph problems using six mainstream LLMs. The results reveal that: (1) ordered graph descriptions significantly improve LLMs’ comprehension of graph... | Yuyao Ge, Shenghua Liu, Baolong Bi, Yiwei Wang, Lingrui Mei, Wenjie Feng, Lizhe Chen, Xueqi Cheng |  |

We introduce Learning2Rewrite, a novel framework to detect LLM-generated text with exceptional generalization to unseen domains. Capitalized on the finding that LLMs inherently modify LLM-generated content less than human-written text when rewriting, we train an LLM to amplify this disparity, yielding a more distinguishable and generalizable edit distance across diverse text distributions. Extensive experiments on data from 21 independent domains and four major LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini, and Llama-3) demonstrate that our detector outperforms state-of-the-art detection methods by up to 23.04% in AUROC for in-distribution tests, 35.10% for out-of-distribution tests, and 48.66% under adversarial attacks. Our unique training objective ensures better generalizability compared to directly training for classification, even when leveraging the same... | Wei Hao, Ran Li, Weiliang Zhao, Junfeng Yang, Chengzhi Mao |  |

To address these issues, we propose an automatic framework, named AutoCaption, which leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to construct numerous and diverse descriptive sentences (i.e., key points) that thoroughly represent video content in an iterative way. This iterative captioning strategy enables the continuous enhancement of video details such as actions, objects’ attributes, environment details, etc. We apply AutoCaption to curate MCTS-VCB, a fine-grained video caption benchmark covering video details, thereby enabling a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs on the video captioning task.

Recent studies have shown that a small subset of weights significantly impacts performance. Based on this observation, we introduce a novel PEFT method, called Gaussian noise Injected Fine Tuning of Salient Weights (GIFT-SW). Our method updates only salient columns, while injecting Gaussian noise into non-salient ones. To identify these columns, we developed a generalized sensitivity metric that extends and unifies metrics from previous studies. Experiments with LLaMA models demonstrate that GIFT-SW outperforms full fine-tuning and modern PEFT methods under the same computational budget. Moreover, GIFT-SW offers practical advantages to recover performance of models subjected to mixed-precision quantization with keeping salient weights in full precision. | Maxim Zhelnin, Viktor Moskvoretskii, Egor Shvetsov, Mariya Krylova, Egor Venediktov, Aleksandr Zuev, Evgeny Burnaev |  |

While quantization offers a pathway to efficiency, existing methods struggle to balance performance and overhead, either incurring high computational/memory costs or failing to address activation outliers—a critical bottleneck in quantized fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose the Outlier Spatial Stability Hypothesis (__OSSH__): _During fine-tuning, certain activation outlier channels retain stable spatial positions across training iterations._ Building on OSSH, we propose __Quaff__, a Quantized parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework for LLMs, optimizing low-precision activation representations through targeted momentum scaling.

Multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) is widely used to assess the understanding capability of LMMs, but it does not guarantee that LMMs truly comprehend the answer. UPD assesses the LMM’s ability to withhold answers when encountering unsolvable problems of MCQA, verifying whether the model truly understands the answer. UPD encompasses three problems: Absent Answer Detection (AAD), Incompatible Answer Set Detection (IASD), and Incompatible Visual Question Detection (IVQD), covering unsolvable cases like answer-lacking or incompatible choices and image-question mismatches. For the evaluation, we introduce the MM-UPD Bench, a benchmark for assessing performance across various ability dimensions. Our experiments reveal that even most LMMs, which demonstrate adequate performance on existing benchmarks, struggle significantly... | Atsuyuki Miyai, Jingkang Yang, Jingyang Zhang, Yifei Ming, Qing Yu, Go Irie, Yixuan Li, Hai Helen Li, Ziwei Liu, Kiyoharu Aizawa |  |

However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on basic abilities using nonverbal methods, such as yes-no and multiple-choice questions. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing AlignMMBench, which provides more nuanced evaluations of alignment capabilities and is the first benchmark specifically designed for Chinese visual contexts. This benchmark is meticulously curated from real-world scenarios and internet sources, encompassing thirteen specific tasks across three categories, and includes both single-turn and multi-turn dialogue scenarios. Incorporating a prompt rewrite strategy, AlignMMBench encompasses 1,054 images and 4,978 question-answer pairs. To facilitate the evaluation pipeline, we develop CritiqueVLM, a rule-calibrated evaluator that exceeds GPT-4’s evaluation ability. Additionally, we measure the “alignment score”, a... | Yuhang Wu, Wenmeng Yu, Yean Cheng, Yan Wang, Xiaohan Zhang, Jiazheng Xu, Ming Ding, Yuxiao Dong |  |

While bias in models are well-documented, less is known about how these biases influence human decisions. This paper presents two interactive experiments investigating the effects of partisan bias in LLMs on political opinions and decision-making. Participants interacted freely with either a biased liberal, biased conservative, or unbiased control model while completing these tasks. We found that participants exposed to partisan biased models were significantly more likely to adopt opinions and make decisions which matched the LLM’s bias. Even more surprising, this influence was seen when the model bias and personal political partisanship of the participant were opposite. However, we also discovered that prior knowledge of AI was weakly correlated with a reduction of the impact of the bias, highlighting the... | Jillian Fisher, Shangbin Feng, Robert Aron, Thomas Richardson, Yejin Choi, Daniel W.

However, prior works have largely neglected this crucial dimension, treating legal adaptation as a static problem rather than a continuous process. To address this gap, we pioneer LexTempus, a dynamic mixture of experts model that explicitly models the temporal evolution of legal language in a parameter-efficient online learning framework. LexTempus starts with a single lightweight adapter expert and dynamically expands by adding new experts as significant deviations in the data distribution are detected. This self-expansion strategy allows LexTempus to adapt to new information without forgetting past knowledge, thereby improving temporal generalization. We use a a non-parametric similarity-based router to merge relevant experts into a unified expert for each test instance, ensuring efficient inference without additional overhead. We validate the... | T. Y. S. S. Santosh, TuanQuang Vuong |  |

To address this issue we present the Canceling Attitudes Detection (CADE) dataset, an annotated corpus of canceling incidents aimed at exploring the factors of disagreements in evaluating people’s canceling attitudes on social media. Specifically, we study the impact of annotators’ morality in their perception of canceling, showing that morality is an independent axis for the explanation of disagreement on this phenomenon. Annotator’s judgments heavily depend on the type of controversial events and involved celebrities. This shows the need to develop more event-centric datasets to better understand how harms are perpetrated in social media and to develop more aware technologies for their detection. | Soda Marem Lo, Oscar Araque, Rajesh Sharma, Marco Antonio Stranisci |  |

Actually, in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) design stages, generating floor plans is a complex task requiring domain expertise and alignment with user requirements. However, existing evaluation methods for floor plan generation rely mainly on statistical metrics like FID, GED, and PSNR, which often fail to evaluate using domain knowledge. As a result, even high-performing models on these metrics struggle to generate viable floor plans in practice. To address this, (1) we propose ArchiMetricsNet, the first floor plan dataset that includes functionality, flow, and overall evaluation scores, along with detailed textual analyses. We trained FloorPlan-MPS (Multi-dimensional Preference Score) on it. (2) We develope FloorPlan-LLaMa, a floor plan generation model based on autoregressive framework.

While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance in text-based theorem reasoning, their ability to generate coherent and pedagogically meaningful visual explanations remains an open challenge. In this work, we introduce TheoremExplainAgent, an agentic approach for generating long-form theorem explanation videos (over 5 minutes) using Manim animations. To systematically evaluate multimodal theorem explanations, we propose TheoremExplainBench, a benchmark covering 240 theorems across multiple STEM disciplines, along with 5 automated evaluation metrics. Our results reveal that agentic planning is essential for generating detailed long-form videos, and the o3-mini agent achieves a success rate of 93.8% and an overall score of 0.77.

Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) highlights an important shift from the “System 1” way of quick reactions to the “System 2” style of reflection-and-correction problem solving. However, current benchmarks heavily rely on the final-answer accuracy, leaving much of a model’s intermediate reasoning steps unexamined. This fails to assess the model’s ability to reflect and rectify mistakes within the reasoning process. To bridge this gap, we introduce FINEREASON, a logic-puzzle benchmark for systematic evaluation of LLMs’ reasoning capabilities. Each puzzle can be decomposed into atomic steps, making it ideal for rigorous validation of intermediate correctness. Building on this, we introduce two tasks: state checking and state transition, for a comprehensive evaluation of how models assess the current situation and plan the next move.

Our approach embeds sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., cipher decoding, riddles, code execution) into the model’s prompt to indirectly generate prohibited inputs. To systematically assess the effectiveness of these attacks, we introduce the PHRYGE benchmark. We demonstrate that our techniques successfully circumvent safeguards in six state-of-the-art language models, including GPT-4o and LLaMA 3.2. Our findings highlight critical weaknesses in current LLM safety alignment and underscore the urgent need for more sophisticated defence strategies. | Sergey Berezin, Reza Farahbakhsh, Noël Crespi |  |

In this work, we analyse and identify the limitations of these metrics and explore alternative evaluation methods that better align with human judgments. We first conduct a manual annotation study to assess the quality of different revisions. Then, we investigate reference-free evaluation metrics from related NLP domains. Additionally, we examine LLM-as-a-judge approaches, analysing their ability to assess revisions with and without a gold reference. Our results show that LLMs effectively assess instruction-following but struggle with correctness, while domain-specific metrics provide complementary insights. We find that a hybrid approach combining LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and task-specific metrics offers the most reliable assessment of revision. | Léane Jourdan, Nicolas Hernandez, Florian Boudin, Richard Dufour |  |

Yet, efforts in this space often require sorting people into fixed buckets of pre-specified diversity-defining dimensions (e.g., demographics), risking smoothing out individualistic variations or even stereotyping. To achieve an authentic representation of diversity that respects individuality, we propose individualistic alignment. While individualistic alignment can take various forms, in this paper, we introduce IndieValueCatalog, a dataset transformed from the influential World Values Survey (WVS), to study language models (LMs) on the specific challenge of individualistic value reasoning. Given a sample of an individual’s value-expressing statements, models are tasked with predicting their value judgments in novel cases. With IndieValueCatalog, we reveal critical limitations in frontier LMs’ abilities to predict individualistic values with accuracies only ranging... | Liwei Jiang, Taylor Sorensen, Sydney Levine, Yejin Choi |  |

For Slavic languages, the development of such algorithms is complicated by the rich derivational capabilities of these languages. Previous research has shown that, on average, these algorithms have already reached expert-level quality. However, a key unresolved issue is the significant decline in performance when segmenting words containing roots not present in the training data. This problem can be partially addressed by using pre-trained language models to better account for word semantics. In this work, we explored the possibility of fine-tuning BERT-like models for morpheme segmentation using data from Belarusian, Czech, and Russian. We found that for Czech and Russian, our models outperform all previously proposed approaches, achieving word-level accuracy of 92.5-95.1%. For Belarusian, this task was addressed for the first time.

Speculative decoding represents a lossless approach to accelerate inference through a guess-and-verify paradigm. Some methods rely on additional architectures to guess draft tokens, which need extra training before use. Alternatively, retrieval-based train-free techniques build libraries from pre-existing corpora or by n-gram generation. However, they face challenges like large storage requirements, time-consuming retrieval, and limited adaptability. Observing that candidate tokens generated during the decoding process are likely to reoccur in future sequences, we propose Token Recycling. This approach stores candidate tokens in an adjacency matrix and employs a breadth-first-search (BFS)-like algorithm to construct a draft tree, which is then validated through tree attention. New candidate tokens from the decoding process are then used to update the matrix. Token Recycling requires <2MB of... | Xianzhen Luo, Yixuan Wang, Qingfu Zhu, Zhiming Zhang, Xuanyu Zhang, Qing Yang, Dongliang Xu |  |

Existing work finds that the capability of long CoT reasoning can be efficiently elicited by tuning on only a few examples and can easily transfer to other tasks. This motivates us to investigate whether long CoT reasoning is a general capability for LLMs. In this work, we conduct an empirical analysis for this question from the perspective of representation. We find that LLMs do encode long CoT reasoning as a general capability, with a clear distinction from vanilla CoTs. Furthermore, domain-specific representations are also required for the effective transfer of long CoT reasoning. Inspired by these findings, we propose GLORE, a novel representation engineering method to unleash the general long CoT reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of GLORE in both in-domain and cross-domain... | Xinyu Tang, Xiaolei Wang, Zhihao Lv, Yingqian Min, Xin Zhao, Binbin Hu, Ziqi Liu, Zhiqiang Zhang |  |

However, LLMs often generate unfaithful explanations, partly because they do not consistently adhere closely to the provided context. Existing approaches to this problem either rely on superficial calibration methods, such as decomposed Chain-of-Thought prompting, or require costly retraining to improve model faithfulness. In this work, we propose a probabilistic inference paradigm that leverages task-specific and lookahead rewards to ensure that LLM-generated rationales are more faithful to model decisions and align better with input context. These rewards are derived from a domain-specific proposal distribution, allowing for optimized sequential Monte Carlo approximations. Our evaluations across three different reasoning tasks show that this method, which allows for controllable generation during inference, improves... | Jiazheng Li, Hanqi Yan, Yulan He |  |

However, we contend that in a range of important settings, group difference awareness matters. For example, differentiating between groups may be necessary in legal contexts (e.g., the U.S. compulsory draft applies to men but not women) and harm assessments (e.g., referring to girls as “terrorists” may be less harmful than referring to Muslim people as such). Thus, in contrast to most fairness work, we study fairness through the perspective of treating people differently — when it is contextually appropriate to. We first introduce an important distinction between descriptive (fact-based), normative (value-based), and correlation (association-based) benchmarks. This distinction is significant because each category requires separate interpretation and mitigation tailored to its specific characteristics. Then, we present a benchmark... | Angelina Wang, Michelle Phan, Daniel E. Ho, Sanmi Koyejo |  |

Model merging, which integrates multiple expert models into a single multi-task model, introduces a novel risk of unauthorized use of LLMs due to its efficient merging process. While fingerprinting techniques have been proposed for verifying model ownership, their resistance to model merging remains unexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel fingerprinting method, MergePrint, which embeds robust fingerprints capable of surviving model merging. MergePrint enables black-box ownership verification, where owners only need to check if a model produces target outputs for specific fingerprint inputs, without accessing model weights or intermediate outputs. By optimizing against a pseudo-merged model that simulates merged behavior, MergePrint ensures fingerprints that remain detectable after merging. Additionally, to minimize performance degradation,... | Shojiro Yamabe, Futa Kai Waseda, Tsubasa Takahashi, Koki Wataoka |  |

Prior research tackles this challenge by generating multiple candidate solutions and validating them with LLM-generated unit tests. The execution results of unit tests serve as reward signals to identify correct solutions. As LLMs always confidently make mistakes, these unit tests are not reliable, thereby diminishing the quality of reward signals. Motivated by the observation that scaling the number of solutions improves LLM performance, we explore the impact of scaling unit tests to enhance reward signal quality. Our pioneer experiment reveals a positive correlation between the number of unit tests and reward signal quality, with greater benefits observed in more challenging problems. Based on these insights, we propose CodeRM-8B, a lightweight yet effective unit test generator that enables efficient and high-quality unit test... | Zeyao Ma, Xiaokang Zhang, Jing Zhang, Jifan Yu, Sijia Luo, Jie Tang |  |

Existing conversational search systems are usually built with two different models. This separation restricts the system from leveraging the intrinsic knowledge of the models simultaneously, which cannot ensure the effectiveness of retrieval benefiting the generation. The existing studies for developing unified models cannot fully address the aspects of understanding conversational context, managing retrieval independently, and generating responses. In this paper, we explore how to unify dense retrieval and response generation for large language models in conversation. We conduct joint fine-tuning with different objectives and design two mechanisms to reduce the inconsistency risks while mitigating data discrepancy. The evaluations on five conversational search datasets demonstrate that our unified model can mutually... | Fengran Mo, Yifan Gao, Chuan Meng, Xin Liu, Zhuofeng Wu, Kelong Mao, Zhengyang Wang, Pei Chen, Zheng Li, Xian Li, Bing Yin, Meng Jiang |  |

Previous research has indicated that major life events can greatly impact individuals’ mental health. However, due to the complexity and ambiguity nature of life events, shedding its light on social media data is quite challenging. In this paper, we are dedicated to uncovering life events mentioned in posts on social media. We hereby provide a carefully-annotated social media event dataset, PsyEvent, which encompasses 12 major life event categories that are likely to occur in everyday life. This dataset is human-annotated under iterative procedure and boasts a high level of quality. Furthermore, by applying the life events extracted from posts to downstream tasks such as early risk detection of depression and suicide risk prediction, we have observed a considerable improvement in performance. This suggests that extracting life events from social media can be beneficial for the analysis of... | Minghao Lv, Siyuan Chen, Haoan Jin, Minghao Yuan, Qianqian Ju, Yujia Peng, Kenny Q.

Prior zero-shot TTS models only mimic the speaker’s voice without further control and adjustment capabilities while prior controllable TTS models cannot perform speaker-specific voice generation. Therefore, ControlSpeech focuses on a more challenging task—a TTS system with controllable timbre, content, and style at the same time. ControlSpeech takes speech prompts, content prompts, and style prompts as inputs and utilizes bidirectional attention and mask-based parallel decoding to capture codec representations corresponding to timbre, content, and style in a discrete decoupling codec space. Moreover, we analyze the many-to-many issue in textual style control and propose the Style Mixture Semantic Density (SMSD) module, which is based on Gaussian mixture density networks, to resolve this problem.

To address this limitation, we propose a simple, efficient, and plug-in approach, Position ID Compression (PIC), to unlock the long-form text generation potential of LLMs. The idea is straightforward: by compressing the position ids of the context, we provoke and guide LLMs to generate coherent and longer output. Specifically, we find that directly reducing the position ids by a fixed ratio significantly impacts the generation quality. To mitigate this, we propose two variants of PIC: NTK-aware PIC and Dynamic PIC. Without additional training, both methods enable LLMs to extend their generation length by approximately 1.5 times without compromising generation quality. Furthermore, by integrating supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with PIC, we... | Haoran Que, Wenge Rong |  |

Since inaccurate or incomplete claims compromise fact-checking results, ensuring claim quality is critical. However, the lack of a standardized evaluation framework impedes assessment and comparison of claim extraction methods. To address this gap, we propose a framework for evaluating claim extraction in the context of fact-checking along with automated, scalable, and replicable methods for applying this framework, including novel approaches for measuring coverage and decontextualization. We also introduce Claimify, an LLM-based claim extraction method, and demonstrate that it outperforms existing methods under our evaluation framework. A key feature of Claimify is its ability to handle ambiguity and extract claims only when there is high confidence in the correct interpretation of the source text. | Dasha Metropolitansky, Jonathan Larson |  |

We, therefore, introduce the concept of Intent Hallucination, a phenomenon where LLMs either omit (failing to address certain parts) or misinterpret (responding to invented query parts) elements of the given query, leading to responses misaligned with the original query. To systematically evaluate intent hallucination, we introduce FAITHQA, a novel benchmark for intent hallucination that contains 20,068 problems, covering both query-only and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) setups with varying topics and difficulty. FAITHQA is the first hallucination benchmark that goes beyond factual verification, tailored to identify the fundamental cause of intent hallucination. By evaluating various LLMs on FAITHQA, we find that (1) intent hallucination is a common issue even for... | Yijie Hao, Haofei Yu, Jiaxuan You |  |

This paper focuses on compositional SLMs that are based on constituency parse trees and contain explicit bottom-up composition of constituent representations. We identify key aspects of design choices in existing compositional SLMs and propose a unified framework encompassing both existing models and novel variants. We conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of all the variants in our framework across language modeling, syntactic generalization, summarization, and inference efficiency. Based on the experimental results, we make multiple recommendations on the design of compositional SLMs. Our code is released at https://github.com/zhaoyd1/compositional_SLMs. | Yida Zhao, Hao Xve, Xiang Hu, Kewei Tu |  |

However, in the field of machine translation (MT) evaluation, current LLM-as-a-judge methods fall short of learned automatic metrics. In this paper, we propose Multidimensional Multi-Agent Debate (M-MAD), a systematic LLM-based multi-agent framework for advanced LLM-as-a-judge MT evaluation. Our findings demonstrate that M-MAD achieves significant advancements by (1) decoupling heuristic MQM criteria into distinct evaluation dimensions for fine-grained assessments; (2) employing multi-agent debates to harness the collaborative reasoning capabilities of LLMs; (3) synthesizing dimension-specific results into a final evaluation judgment to ensure robust and reliable outcomes. Comprehensive experiments show that M-MAD not only outperforms all existing LLM-as-a-judge methods but also competes with state-of-the-art reference-based... | Zhaopeng Feng, Jiayuan Su, Jiamei Zheng, Jiahan Ren, Yan Zhang, Jian Wu, Hongwei Wang, Zuozhu Liu |  |

Despite achievements in sub-tasks such as lyric generation, lyric-to-melody, and melody-to-lyric, etc, a unified model for song composition has not yet been achieved. In this paper, we introduce SongComposer, a pioneering step towards a unified song composition model that can readily create symbolic lyrics and melodies following instructions. SongComposer is a music-specialized large language model (LLM) that, for the first time, integrates the capability of simultaneously composing lyrics and melodies into LLMs by leveraging three key innovations: 1) a flexible tuple format for word-level alignment of lyrics and melodies, 2) an extended tokenizer vocabulary for song notes, with scalar initialization based on musical knowledge to capture rhythm, and 3) a multi-stage... | Shuangrui Ding, Zihan Liu, Xiaoyi Dong, Pan Zhang, Rui Qian, Junhao Huang, Conghui He, Dahua Lin, Jiaqi Wang |  |

Existing solutions primarily adopt two paradigms: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). While these approaches have advanced the field, they suffer from two critical limitations: (1) the entanglement of content semantics and stylistic patterns in historical texts impedes accurate modeling of user-specific writing preferences; and (2) scalability challenges arising from both RAG’s inference latency by retrieval operations and PEFT’s parameter storage requirements for per user model. To overcome these limitations, we propose StyleVector, a training-free framework that disentangles and represents personalized writing style as a vector in LLM’s activation space, enabling style-steered generation during inference without requiring costly retrieval or parameter storage.... | Jinghao Zhang, Yuting Liu, Wenjie Wang, Qiang Liu, Shu Wu, Liang Wang, TatSeng Chua |  |

However, fine-tuning these models remains challenging due to the scarcity of annotated query-document pairs. Existing distillation-based approaches suffer from training-inference misalignment and fail to capture interdependencies among candidate documents. To overcome these limitations, we reframe the reranking process as an attention-mask problem and propose Gumbel Reranking, an end-to-end training framework for rerankers aimed at minimizing the training-inference gap. In our approach, reranker optimization is reformulated as learning a stochastic, document-wise Top-k attention mask using the Gumbel Trick and Relaxed Top-k Sampling. This formulation enables end-to-end optimization by minimizing the overall language loss. Experiments across various settings consistently demonstrate performance gains, including a 10.4% improvement in recall on HotpotQA for distinguishing indirectly relevant documents. | Siyuan Huang, Zhiyuan Ma, Jintao Du, Changhua Meng, Weiqiang Wang, Jingwen Leng, Minyi Guo, Zhouhan Lin |  |

However, collecting human preferences is expensive and time-consuming, with highly variable annotation quality. An appealing alternative is to distill preferences from LMs as a source of synthetic annotations, offering a cost-effective and scalable alternative, albeit susceptible to other biases and errors. In this work, we introduce HyPER, a Hybrid Preference routER that defers an annotation to either humans or LMs, achieving better annotation quality while reducing the cost of human-only annotation. We formulate this as an optimization problem: given a preference dataset and an evaluation metric, we (1) train a performance prediction model (PPM) to predict a reward model’s (RM) performance on an arbitrary combination of human and LM annotations and (2) employ a routing strategy that selects a combination that maximizes predicted performance.

Nearly all existing evaluation methods for ODED usually first construct evaluation benchmarks with limited labels and domain coverage, and then evaluate ODED methods using metrics based on token-level label matching rules. However, this kind of evaluation framework faces two issues: (1) The limited evaluation benchmarks lack representatives of the real world, making it difficult to accurately reflect the performance of various ODED methods in real-world scenarios; (2) Evaluation metrics based on token-level matching rules fail to capture semantic similarity between predictions and golden labels. To address these two problems above, we propose a scalable and reliable Semantic-level Evaluation framework for Open domain Event detection (SEOE) by constructing a more representative evaluation... | YiFan Lu, XianLing Mao, Tian Lan, Tong Zhang, YuShi Zhu, Heyan Huang |  |

We detail our treebank development process, including data collection, pre-processing, manual annotation, and quality assurance procedures. We provide baseline evaluations using multiple transformer-based models to assess the performance of state-of-the-art dependency parsers on Tagalog. We also highlight challenges in the syntactic analysis of Tagalog given its distinctive grammatical properties, and discuss its implications for the annotation of this treebank. We anticipate that UD-NewsCrawl and our baseline model implementations will serve as valuable resources for advancing computational linguistics research in underrepresented languages like Tagalog. | Angelina Aspra Aquino, Lester James Validad Miranda, Elsie Marie T.

However, large-scale RAG systems consume significant computational resources and are prone to generating “hallucinated” content from Humans. In this work, we introduce DRAG, a novel framework for distilling RAG knowledge from large-scale Language Models (LLMs) into small LMs (SLMs). Our approach leverages evidence- and knowledge graph–based distillation, ensuring that the distilled model retains critical factual knowledge while significantly reducing model size and computational cost. By aligning the smaller model’s predictions with a structured knowledge graph and ranked evidence, DRAG effectively mitigates hallucinations and improves factual accuracy. We further present a case demonstrating how our framework mitigates user privacy risks and introduce a corresponding benchmark. Experimental evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate... | Jennifer Chen, Aidar Myrzakhan, Yaxin Luo, Hassaan Muhammad Khan, Sondos Mahmoud Bsharat, Zhiqiang Shen |  |

However, as these systems become increasingly integrated into critical applications, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, misinformation propagation, and unintended behaviors have raised significant concerns. To address this challenge, we introduce G-Safeguard, a topology-guided security lens and treatment for robust LLM-MAS, which leverages graph neural networks to detect anomalies on the multi-agent utterance graph and employ topological intervention for attack remediation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that G-Safeguard: (I) exhibits significant effectiveness under various attack strategies, recovering over 40% of the performance for prompt injection; (II) is highly adaptable to diverse LLM backbones and large-scale MAS; (III) can seamlessly combine with mainstream MAS with... | Shilong Wang, Guibin Zhang, Miao Yu, Guancheng Wan, Fanci Meng, Chongye Guo, Kun Wang, Yang Wang |  |

While LLM alignment studies cover many areas, one important yet underexplored area is how LLMs make judgments about obligations. This work reveals a strong tendency in LLMs to judge non-obligatory contexts as obligations when prompts are augmented with modal expressions such as must or ought to. We introduce this phenomenon as Deontological Keyword Bias (DKB). We find that LLMs judge over 90% of commonsense scenarios as obligations when modal expressions are present. This tendency is consist across various LLM families, question types, and answer formats. To mitigate DKB, we propose a judgment strategy that integrates few-shot examples with reasoning prompts. This study sheds light on how modal expressions, as a form of linguistic framing, influence the normative decisions of LLMs and underscores the importance of addressing such biases... | Bumjin Park, Leejinsil Leejinsil, Jaesik Choi |  |

However, existing methods often struggle with logical errors when conducting complex legal reasoning. We propose LegalReasoner, which enhances LJP reliability through step-wise verification and correction of the reasoning process. Specifically, it first identifies dispute points to decompose complex cases, and then conducts step-wise reasoning while employing a process verifier to validate each step’s logic from correctness, progressiveness, and potential perspectives. When errors are detected, expert-designed attribution and resolution strategies are applied for correction. To fine-tune LegalReasoner, we release the LegalHK dataset, containing 58,130 Hong Kong court cases with detailed annotations of dispute points, step-by-step reasoning chains, and... | Weijie Shi, Han Zhu, Jiaming Ji, Mengze Li, Jipeng Zhang, Ruiyuan Zhang, Jia Zhu, Jiajie Xu, Sirui Han, Yike Guo |  |

While large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance on idiomaticity detection benchmarks, this success may be driven by reasoning shortcuts present in existing datasets. To address this, we introduce a novel, controlled contrastive dataset (DICE) specifically designed to assess whether LLMs can effectively leverage context to disambiguate idiomatic meanings. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of collocational frequency and sentence probability—proxies for human processing known to affect idiom resolution—on model performance. Our results show that LLMs frequently fail to resolve idiomaticity when it depends on contextual understanding, performing better on sentences deemed more likely by the model. Additionally, idiom frequency influences performance but does not guarantee accurate interpretation. Our findings emphasize the limitations of current models... | Maggie Mi, Aline Villavicencio, Nafise Sadat Moosavi |  |

However, interpreting charts with textual descriptions often leads to information loss, as it fails to fully capture the dense information embedded in charts. In contrast, parsing charts into code provides lossless representations that can effectively contain all critical details. Although existing open-source MLLMs have achieved success in chart understanding tasks, they still face two major challenges when applied to chart-to-code tasks: (1) Low executability and poor restoration of chart details in the generated code and (2) Lack of large-scale and diverse training data. To address these challenges, we propose ChartCoder, the first dedicated chart-to-code MLLM, which leverages Code LLMs as the language backbone to enhance the executability of the generated code. Furthermore, we introduce Chart2Code-160k, the first large-scale and diverse dataset for chart-to-code... | Xuanle Zhao, Xianzhen Luo, Qi Shi, Chi Chen, Shuo Wang, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun |  |

In several languages, animacy imposes hard constraints on grammar. While it has been argued that these constraints may emerge from universal soft tendencies, it has been difficult to provide empirical evidence for this conjecture due to the lack of data annotated with animacy classes. In this work, we first propose a method to reliably classify animacy classes of nominals in 11 languages from 5 families, leveraging multilingual large language models (LLMs) and word sense disambiguation datasets. Then, through this newly acquired data, we verify that animacy displays consistent cross-linguistic tendencies in terms of preferred morphosyntactic constructions, although not always in line with received wisdom: animacy in nouns correlates with the alignment role of agent, early positions in a clause, and syntactic pivot (e.g., for relativisation), but not necessarily with... | Nina Gregorio, Matteo Gay, Sharon Goldwater, Edoardo M.

Prior work in the field primarily focuses on bilingual lexical induction, which deals with word alignments using mapping-based or corpora-based approaches. However, these approaches do not cater to domain-specific lexicon generation that consists of domain-specific terminology. This task becomes particularly important in specialized medical, engineering, and other technical domains, owing to the highly infrequent usage of the terms and scarcity of data involving domain-specific terms especially for low-resource languages. We propose a new model to generate dictionary words for 6 Indian languages in the multi-domain setting. Our model consists of domain-specific and domain-generic layers that encode information, and these layers are invoked via a learnable routing technique.

We first establish a reliable evaluation protocol to guide model development—instead of perplexity or simple needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) tests, we use a broad set of long-context downstream tasks, and we evaluate models after SFT as this better reveals long-context abilities. Supported by our robust evaluations, we run thorough experiments to decide the data mix for continued pre-training, the instruction tuning dataset, and many other design choices such as position extrapolation. We find that (1) code repositories and books are excellent sources of long data, but it is crucial to combine them with high-quality short-context data; (2) training with a sequence length beyond the evaluation length boosts long-context performance; (3) for SFT, using only short instruction datasets yields strong performance on long-context tasks. Our final model,... | Tianyu Gao, Alexander Wettig, Howard Yen, Danqi Chen |  |

While data augmentation is promising to enhance mathematical problem-solving ability, current approaches are predominantly limited to instance-level modifications—such as rephrasing or generating syntactic variations—which fail to capture and leverage the intrinsic relational structures inherent in mathematical knowledge. Inspired by human learning processes, where mathematical proficiency develops through systematic exposure to interconnected concepts, we introduce MathFusion, a novel framework that enhances mathematical reasoning through cross-problem instruction synthesis. MathFusion implements this through three fusion strategies: (1) sequential fusion, which chains related problems to model solution dependencies; (2) parallel fusion, which combines analogous problems to reinforce conceptual understanding; and (3) conditional fusion, which creates context-aware selective problems to enhance... | Qizhi Pei, Lijun Wu, Zhuoshi Pan, Yu Li, Honglin Lin, Chenlin Ming, Xin Gao, Conghui He, Rui Yan |  |

These mechanisms provide insights into underlying argument structures and guide the assessment of natural language arguments. Research on argumentation scheme mining, however, has always been limited by the scarcity of large enough publicly available corpora containing scheme annotations. In this paper, we present the first state-of-the-art results for mining argumentation schemes in natural language dialogue. For this purpose, we create QT-Schemes, a new corpus of 441 arguments annotated with 24 argumentation schemes. Using this corpus, we leverage the capabilities of LLMs and Transformer-based models, pre-training them on a large corpus containing textbook-like argumentation schemes and validating their applicability in real-world scenarios. | Ramon RuizDolz, Zlata Kikteva, John Lawrence |  |

With the evolution of multi-modal large language models ((M)LLMs), this dream is closer to reality, as (M)LLM-based Agents using computers, mobile phones and web browsers by operating within the environments and interfaces (e.g., Graphical User Interface (GUI) and Command Line Interface (CLI)) provided by operating systems (OS) to automate tasks have significantly advanced. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on these advanced agents, designated as OS Agents. We begin by elucidating the fundamentals of OS Agents, exploring their key components and capabilities. We then examine methodologies for constructing OS Agents, focusing on domain-specific foundation models and agent frameworks. A detailed review of evaluation metrics and benchmarks highlights how OS Agents are assessed across diverse platforms and tasks.

We believe addressing these issues will make these datasets more useful as evaluation sets, and improve downstream models. We divide these quality issues into two categories: micro-level and macro-level. We find that macro-level issues are more prevalent in less institutionalized, often under-resourced languages. We provide a case analysis of Taiwanese Southern Min (nan_tw) that highlights the need for proactive language planning (e.g. orthography prescriptions, dialect boundary definition) and enhanced data quality control in the process of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) dataset creation. We conclude by proposing guidelines and recommendations to mitigate these issues in future dataset development, emphasizing the importance of sociolinguistic awareness in creating robust... | Mingfei Lau, Qian Chen, Yeming Fang, Tingting Xu, Tongzhou Chen, Pavel Golik |  |

While degradation is inevitable, it can be mitigated through strategic prompting techniques. These findings contribute to discussions on the long-term effects of AI-mediated information propagation, raising important questions about the reliability of LLM-generated content in iterative workflows. | Amr Mohamed, Mingmeng Geng, Michalis Vazirgiannis, Guokan Shang |  |

Despite the extensive knowledge that vision-language models (VLMs) possess, it remains largely unexplored whether they are capable of performing this fundamental task. To address this, we introduce VLM2-Bench, a benchmark designed to assess whether VLMs can Visually Link Matching cues, with 9 subtasks and over 3,000 test cases. Comprehensive evaluation across twelve VLMs, along with further analysis of various language-side and vision-side prompting methods, leads to a total of eight key findings. We identify critical challenges in models’ ability to link visual cues, highlighting a significant performance gap. Based on these insights, we advocate for (i) enhancing core visual capabilities to improve adaptability and reduce reliance on prior knowledge, (ii) establishing clearer principles for integrating... | Jianshu Zhang, Dongyu Yao, Renjie Pi, Paul Pu Liang, Yi R.

However, evaluating these models often demands sampling hundreds or thousands of images or videos, making the process computationally expensive, especially for diffusion-based models with inherently slow sampling. Moreover, existing evaluation methods rely on rigid pipelines that overlook specific user needs and provide numerical results without clear explanations. In contrast, humans can quickly form impressions of a model’s capabilities by observing only a few samples. To mimic this, we propose the Evaluation Agent framework, which employs human-like strategies for efficient, dynamic, multi-round evaluations using only a few samples per round, while offering detailed, user-tailored analyses. It offers four key advantages: 1) efficiency, 2) promptable evaluation tailored to diverse user needs, 3) explainability beyond single numerical scores, and 4)... | Fan Zhang, Shulin Tian, Ziqi Huang, Yu Qiao, Ziwei Liu |  |

Yet the effectiveness of LLM-based approaches in real-world applications remains under explored. This study measures the knowledge users acquire with topic models—including traditional, unsupervised and supervised LLM- based approaches—on two datasets. While LLM-based methods generate more human- readable topics and show higher average win probabilities than traditional models for data exploration, they produce overly generic topics for domain-specific datasets that do not easily allow users to learn much about the documents. Adding human supervision to LLM-based topic models improves data exploration by addressing hallucination and genericity but requires more human efforts. In contrast, traditional models like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) remain effective for exploration but are less user-friendly.

Despite significant efforts in evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), active perception has been largely overlooked. To address this gap, we propose a novel benchmark named ActiView to evaluate active perception in MLLMs. We focus on a specialized form of Visual Question Answering (VQA) that eases and quantifies the evaluation yet challenging for existing MLLMs. Meanwhile, intermediate reasoning behaviors of models are also discussed. Given an image, we restrict the perceptual field of a model, requiring it to actively zoom or shift its perceptual field based on reasoning to answer the question successfully. We conduct extensive evaluation over 30 models, including proprietary and open-source models, and observe that restricted perceptual fields play a significant role in enabling active perception.... | Ziyue Wang, Chi Chen, Fuwen Luo, Yurui Dong, Yuanchi Zhang, Yuzhuang Xu, Xiaolong Wang, Peng Li, Yang Liu |  |

We investigate whether LLMs use ICL to perform structured reasoning in ways that are consistent with a Bayesian framework or rely on pattern matching. Using a controlled setting of biased coin flips, we find that: (1) LLMs often possess biased priors, causing initial divergence in zero-shot settings, (2) in-context evidence outweighs explicit bias instructions, (3) LLMs broadly follow Bayesian posterior updates, with deviations primarily due to miscalibrated priors rather than flawed updates, and (4) attention magnitude has negligible effect on Bayesian inference. With sufficient demonstrations of biased coin flips via ICL, LLMs update their priors in a Bayesian manner.

To track progress, robust benchmarks are required to evaluate their capabilities beyond superficial pattern recognition. However, current LLM reasoning benchmarks often face challenges such as insufficient interpretability, performance saturation or data contamination. To address these challenges, we introduce GAMEBoT, a gaming arena designed for rigorous and transparent assessment of LLM reasoning capabilities. GAMEBoT decompose complex reasoning in games into predefined modular subproblems. This decomposition allows us to design a suite of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts infused with domain knowledge to guide LLMs in addressing these subproblems before action selection. Furthermore, we develop a suite of rule-based algorithms to generate ground truth for these subproblems, enabling rigorous validation of the LLMs’ intermediate reasoning steps. This approach facilitates... | Wenye Lin, Jonathan Roberts, Yunhan Yang, Samuel Albanie, Zongqing Lu, Kai Han |  |

We first fully analyze this phenomenon on eight LLM-based embedders and show that this phenomenon is universal and is not affected by model architecture, training strategy, and embedding method. With a deeper analysis, we find that the main change in embedding space between these embedders and their LLM backbones is in the first principal component. By adjusting the first principal component, we can align text embedding with the key tokens. Finally, we give several examples to demonstrate the vast application potential of this finding: (1) we propose a simple and practical sparse retrieval method based on the aligned tokens, which can achieve 80%... | Zhijie Nie, Richong Zhang, Zhanyu Wu |  |

Commonsense reasoning is shaped by geographical and cultural contexts, and existing English datasets fail to capture the diversity of the Arab world. To address this, we introduce , a commonsense reasoning dataset in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), covering cultures of 13 countries across the Gulf, Levant, North Africa, and the Nile Valley. The dataset was built from scratch by engaging native speakers to write and validate culturally relevant questions for their respective countries. spans 12 daily life domains with 54 fine-grained subtopics, reflecting various aspects of social norms, traditions, and everyday experiences.

To address this issue, we propose AXIS, a novel LLM-based agents framework that prioritize actions through application programming interfaces (APIs) over UI actions. This framework also facilitates the creation and expansion of APIs through automated exploration of applications. Our experiments on Microsoft Word demonstrate that AXIS reduces task completion time by 65%-70% and cognitive workload by 38%-53%, while maintaining accuracy of 97%-98% compared to humans.

However, their applicability to low-resource languages remains limited due to lack of both labeled data for fine-tuning, and unlabeled text for pre-training. In this paper, we propose TransFusion, a framework in which models are fine-tuned to use English translations of low-resource language data, enabling more precise predictions through annotation fusion. Based on TransFusion, we introduce GoLLIE-TF, a cross-lingual instruction-tuned LLM for IE tasks, designed to close the performance gap between high and low-resource languages. Our experiments across twelve multilingual IE datasets spanning 50 languages demonstrate that GoLLIE-TF achieves better cross-lingual transfer over the base model. In addition, we show that TransFusion significantly improves... | Yang Chen, Vedaant Shah, Alan Ritter |  |

Existing methods that rely on semantic similarity often fail to capture the nuanced oppositional dynamics essential for these applications. Motivated by these limitations, we introduce a novel task, Conditional Dichotomy Quantification (ConDQ), which formalizes the direct measurement of conditional dichotomy and provides carefully constructed datasets covering debate, defeasible natural language inference, and causal reasoning scenarios. To address this task, we develop the Dichotomy-oriented Geometric Embedding (DoGE) framework, which leverages complex-valued embeddings and a dichotomous objective to model and quantify these oppositional relationships effectively. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and versatility of DoGE, demonstrating its potential in understanding and quantifying conditional... | Shaobo Cui, Wenqing Liu, Yiyang Feng, Jiawei Zhou, Boi Faltings |  |

However, existing preference learning methods rely heavily on curated data from humans or advanced LLMs, which is costly and difficult to scale. In this work, we present PUGC, a novel framework that leverages implicit human Preferences in unlabeled User-Generated Content (UGC) to generate preference data. Although UGC is not explicitly created to guide LLMs in generating human-preferred responses, it often reflects valuable insights and implicit preferences from its creators that has the potential to address readers’ questions. PUGC transforms UGC into user queries and generates responses from the policy model. The UGC is then leveraged as a reference text for response scoring, aligning the model with these implicit preferences. This approach improves the quality of preference data while enabling scalable, domain-specific... | Zhaoxuan Tan, Zheng Li, Tianyi Liu, Haodong Wang, Hyokun Yun, Ming Zeng, Pei Chen, Zhihan Zhang, Yifan Gao, Ruijie Wang, Priyanka Nigam, Bing Yin, Meng Jiang |  |

To tackle this task, we first collect a new dedicated Complex VQA dataset named CVQA and then propose VQAGuider, an innovative framework planning a few atomic visual recognition tools by video-related API matching. VQAGuider facilitates a deep engagement with video content and precise responses to complex video-related questions by MLLMs, which is beyond aligning visual and language features for simple VQA tasks. Our experiments demonstrate VQAGuider is capable of navigating the complex VQA tasks by... | Yuyan Chen, Jiyuan Jia, Jiaxin Lu, Siyue Li, Yu Guan, Ming Yang, Qingpei Guo |  |

Existing approaches adapt LLMs by traversing relational links between entities in a database and converting the structured data into flat text documents, but this text-based serialization disregards critical relational structures, introduces redundancy, and often exceeds standard LLM context lengths. We introduce Rel-LLM, a novel architecture that employs a graph neural network (GNN) based encoder to create structured relational prompts for LLMs within a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework. Unlike traditional text-based serialization approaches, our method preserves the inherent relational structure of databases while enabling LLMs to effectively process and reason over complex entity relationships. Specifically, the GNN encoder extracts a local subgraph around an entity to build feature representations... | Fang Wu, Vijay Prakash Dwivedi, Jure Leskovec |  |

We find that spatial relations are generally rare in widely used VL datasets, with only a few being well represented, while most form a long tail of underrepresented relations. This gap leaves VLMs ill-equipped to handle diverse spatial relationships. To bridge it, we construct a synthetic VQA dataset focused on spatial reasoning generated from hyper-detailed image descriptions in Localized Narratives, DOCCI, and PixMo-Cap. Our dataset consists of 455k samples containing 3.4 million QA pairs. Trained on this dataset, our Spatial-Reasoning Enhanced (SpaRE) VLMs show strong improvements on spatial reasoning benchmarks, achieving up to a 49% performance gain on the What’s Up benchmark, while maintaining strong results on general tasks. Our work narrows the gap... | Michael Ogezi, Freda Shi |  |

Recent efforts to address this with end-to-end Speech Large Language Models (speech-in, text-out) trained with supervised finetuning (SFT) have led to models “forgetting” capabilities from text-only LLMs. Our work proposes an alternative paradigm for training Speech LLMs without instruction data, using the response of a text-only LLM to transcripts as self-supervision. Importantly, this process can be performed without annotated responses. We show that our Distilled Voice Assistant (DiVA) generalizes to Spoken Question Answering, Classification, and Translation. Furthermore, DiVA better matches user preferences, achieving a 72% win rate compared with state-of-the-art models like Qwen 2 Audio, despite using >100x less training compute. | William Barr Held, Yanzhe Zhang, Weiyan Shi, Minzhi Li, Michael J.

However, many large language models (LLMs) struggle to interpret and apply metaphors in multi-agent language games, hindering their ability to engage in covert communication and semantic evasion, which are crucial for strategic communication. To address this challenge, we introduce CoMet, a framework that enables LLM-based agents to engage in metaphor processing. CoMet combines a hypothesis-based metaphor reasoner with a metaphor generator that improves through self-reflection and knowledge integration. This enhances the agents’ ability to interpret and apply metaphors, improving the strategic and nuanced quality of their interactions. We evaluate CoMet on two multi-agent language games—Undercover and Adversarial Taboo—which emphasize “covert communication” and “semantic evasion”. Experimental results demonstrate that CoMet significantly... | Shuhang Xu, Fangwei Zhong |  |

In this work, we introduce an uncertainty-aware framework designed to enhance the accuracy of LLM responses by systematically incorporating model confidence at critical decision points. We propose an approach that encourages multi-step reasoning in LLMs and quantify the confidence of intermediate answers such as numerical results in mathematical reasoning and proper nouns in open-domain generation. Then, the overall confidence of each reasoning chain is evaluated based on confidence of these critical intermediate steps. Finally, we aggregate the answer of generated response paths in a way that reflects the reliability of each generated content (as opposed to self-consistency in which each generated chain contributes equally to majority voting).

In response, a viable solution is to inject imperceptible identifiers into LLMs, known as watermarks. Our research extends the existing watermarking methods by proposing the novel Sampling One Then Accepting (STA-1) method. STA-1 is an unbiased watermark that preserves the original token distribution in expectation and has a lower risk of producing unsatisfactory outputs in low-entropy scenarios compared to existing unbiased watermarks. In watermark detection, STA-1 does not require prompts or a white-box LLM, provides statistical guarantees, demonstrates high efficiency in detection time, and remains robust against various watermarking attacks. Experimental results on low-entropy and high-entropy datasets demonstrate that STA-1 achieves the above properties simultaneously, making it a desirable solution for watermarking... | Minjia Mao, Dongjun Wei, Zeyu Chen, Xiao Fang, Michael Chau |  |

We study the data strategies for a two-stage training framework: in the first stage, which focuses on learning to decode document identifiers from queries, we investigate LLM-generated queries across multiple granularity (e.g. chunks, sentences) and domain-relevant search constraints that can better capture nuanced relevancy signals. In the second stage, which aims to refine document ranking through preference learning, we explore the strategies for mining hard negatives based on the initial model’s predictions. Experiments on public datasets over diverse domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our synthetic data generation and hard negative sampling approach. | Haoyang Wen, Jiang Guo, Yi Zhang, Jiarong Jiang, Zhiguo Wang |  |

In light of this, we hypothesize that model performance and behaviors can be further enhanced and controlled by modulating the contributions of these sub-updates based on their relevance to the input or target output style, and propose LLMBraces, a novel and efficient method that computes relevance scores associated with value vectors in FFN layers and leverages these scores to dynamically adjust the contribution of sub-updates. By optimizing sub-update contributions, LLMBraces refines the prediction process, leading to more accurate and reliable outputs, much like a ‘brace’ providing support and stability. Moreover, LLMBraces can be... | Ying Shen, Lifu Huang |  |

Current benchmarks lack comprehensive assessment of LLMs in complex conversational scenarios. CONFETTI addresses this gap through 109 human-simulated conversations, comprising 313 user turns and covering 86 APIs. These conversations explicitly target various conversational complexities, such as follow-ups, goal correction and switching, ambiguous and implicit goals. We perform off-policy turn-level evaluation using this benchmark targeting function-calling. Our benchmark also incorporates dialog act annotations to assess agent responses. We evaluate a series of state-of-the-art LLMs and analyze their performance with respect to the number of available APIs, conversation lengths, and chained function calling. Our results reveal that while some models are... | Tamer Alkhouli, Katerina Margatina, James Gung, Raphael Shu, Claudia Zaghi, Monica Sunkara, Yi Zhang |  |

But what if someone is unsure about their own beliefs? How can we quantify this uncertainty? We propose a new suite of tasks, challenging language models (LMs) to model the uncertainty of participants in a dialogue. We design these tasks around conversation forecasting, where the goal is to predict the probability of an unobserved conversation outcome. Uniquely, we view conversation agents themselves as forecasters, asking an LM to predict the uncertainty of an individual from their language use. We experiment with scaling methods, bagging, and demographic context for this regression task, conducting experiments on three dialogue corpora (social, negotiation, task-oriented) with eight LMs. While LMs can explain up to 7% variance in the uncertainty of others, we highlight the difficulty of the tasks and room for future work, especially in tasks that require explicit shifts in... | Anthony B.

However, existing literature lacks a comprehensive examination of this area. This survey aims to fill this gap by thoroughly reviewing uncertainty in causality. We first introduce a novel trichotomy, categorizing causal uncertainty into aleatoric (inherent randomness in causal data), epistemic (causal model limitations), and ontological (existence of causal links) uncertainty. We then survey methods for quantifying uncertainty in causal analysis and highlight the complementary relationship between causal uncertainty and causal strength. Furthermore, we examine the challenges that large language models (LLMs) face in handling causal uncertainty, such as hallucinations and inconsistencies, and propose key traits for an optimal causal LLM. Our paper reviews current approaches and outlines future research... | Shaobo Cui, Luca Mouchel, Boi Faltings |  |

Inducing Persona-Guided Prompts for Personalized Reward Models in LLMs](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.397/) |  | 0 | Recent calls for pluralistic alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) encourage adapting models to diverse user preferences. However, most prior work on personalized reward models heavily rely on additional identity information, such as demographic details or a predefined set of preference categories. To this end, we introduce SynthesizeMe, an approach to inducing synthetic user personas from user interactions for personalized reward modeling. SynthesizeMe first generates and verifies reasoning to explain user preferences, then induces synthetic user personas from that reasoning, and finally filters to informative prior user interactions in order to build personalized prompts for a particular user. We show that using SynthesizeMe induced prompts improves personalized LLM-as-a-judge accuracy by 4.4% on Chatbot Arena. Combining SynthesizeMe derived prompts with a reward model achieves top performance on PersonalRewardBench: a new curation of user-stratified interactions with chatbots... | Michael J.

We develop a computational approach to measure metaphorical language, focusing on immigration discourse on social media. Grounded in qualitative social science research, we identify seven concepts evoked in immigration discourse (e.g. water or vermin). We propose and evaluate a novel technique that leverages both word-level and document-level signals to measure metaphor with respect to these concepts. We then study the relationship between metaphor, political ideology, and user engagement in 400K US tweets about immigration. While conservatives tend to use dehumanizing metaphors more than liberals, this effect varies widely across concepts. Moreover, creature-related metaphor is associated with more retweets, especially for liberal authors. Our work highlights the potential for computational methods to complement qualitative approaches in understanding... | Julia Mendelsohn, Ceren Budak |  |

These LLMs demonstrate strong problem-solving capabilities and adaptability to multifaceted scenarios. However, their use as agents also introduces significant risks, including task-specific risks, which are identified by the agent administrator based on the specific task requirements and constraints, and systemic risks, which stem from vulnerabilities in their design or interactions, potentially compromising confidentiality, integrity, or availability (CIA) of information and triggering security risks. Existing defense agencies fail to adaptively and effectively mitigate these risks. In this paper, we propose AGrail, a lifelong agent guardrail to enhance LLM agent safety, which features adaptive safety check generation, effective safety check optimization, and tool compatibility & flexibility.

Towards this goal, we train a factuality evaluator, FenCE, that provides LM generators with claim-level factuality feedback. In particular, we train FenCE to (1) generate textual critiques along with scores and (2) make claim-level judgment based on diverse source documents obtained by various tools, via data augmentation on a combination of public judgment datasets. We then present a framework that leverages FenCE to improve the factuality of LM generators by constructing training data. Specifically, we generate a set of candidate responses, ask FenCE to revise and score each response without introducing lesser-known facts, and train the generator by preferring highly scored revised responses. Experiments show that our data augmentation methods improve the evaluator’s accuracy by 2.9% on LLM-AggreFact. With FenCE, we improve... | Yiqing Xie, Wenxuan Zhou, Pradyot Prakash, Di Jin, Yuning Mao, Quintin Fettes, Arya Talebzadeh, Sinong Wang, Han Fang, Carolyn P. Rosé, Daniel Fried, Hejia Zhang |  |

The legal import of a term may depend on omissions, cross-references, or silence, Further, legal text is often susceptible to multiple valid, conflicting interpretations; as the saying goes: a good lawyer’s answer to any question is “it depends.”This work introduces a new, hand-coded dataset for the interpretation of privacy policies. It includes privacy policies from 149 firms, including materials incorporated by reference. The policies are annotated across 64 dimension that reflect the applicable legal rules and contested terms from EU and US privacy regulation and litigation. Our annotation methodology is designed to capture the capture core challenges peculiar to legal language, including indeterminacy, interdependence between clauses, meaningful silence, and the implications of legal defaults. We present a set of baseline results for the dataset using current large language models. | Florencia MarottaWurgler, David Stein |  |

They struggle to activate complex reasoning behaviours, delivering step-wise explanation, questioning and reflection, particularly in multilingual settings where high-quality supervision across languages is lacking. Recent works have introduced eclectic strategies to enhance MLLMs’ reasoning; however, they remain related to a single language.To make MLLMs’ reasoning capabilities aligned among languages and improve modality performances, we propose R2-MultiOmnia, a modular approach that instructs the models to abstract key elements of the reasoning process and then refine reasoning trajectories via self-correction. Specifically, we instruct the models producing multimodal synthetic resources by bridging... | Leonardo Ranaldi, Federico Ranaldi, Giulia Pucci |  |

In this paper, we try to answer two questions: 1. What makes garden-path sentences hard to understand for humans? 2. Do the same reasons make garden-path sentences hard for LLMs as well? Based on psycholinguistic research, we formulate hypotheses on why garden-path sentences are hard, and test these hypotheses on human participants and a large suite of LLMs using comprehension questions. Our findings reveal that both LLMs and humans struggle with specific syntactic complexities, with some models showing high correlation with human comprehension. To complement our findings, we test LLM comprehension of garden-path constructions with paraphrasing and text-to-image generation tasks, and find that the results mirror the sentence comprehension question results, further validating our findings on LLM understanding of these... | Samuel Joseph Amouyal, Aya MeltzerAsscher, Jonathan Berant |  |

This paper introduces a novel methodology for efficiently identifying inherent cross-lingual weaknesses in LLMs. Our approach leverages beam search and LLM-based simulation to generate bilingual question pairs that expose performance discrepancies between English and target languages. We construct a new dataset of over 6,000 bilingual pairs across 16 languages using this methodology, demonstrating its effectiveness in revealing weaknesses even in state-of-the-art models. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our method precisely and cost-effectively pinpoints cross-lingual weaknesses, consistently revealing over 50% accuracy drops in target languages across a wide range of models. Moreover, further experiments investigate the relationship between linguistic similarity and cross-lingual weaknesses, revealing that... | Zixiang Xu, Yanbo Wang, Yue Huang, Xiuying Chen, Jieyu Zhao, Meng Jiang, Xiangliang Zhang |  |

Surprisingly, previous works indicate a counterintuitive phenomenon that using textual unlearning to align MLLMs achieves comparable safety performances with MLLMs aligned with image-text pairs. To explain such a phenomenon, we discover a Visual Safety Information Leakage (VSIL) problem in existing multimodal safety benchmarks, i.e., the potentially risky content in the image has been revealed in the textual query. Thus, MLLMs can easily refuse these sensitive image-text pairs according to textual queries only, leading to unreliable cross-modality safety evaluation of MLLMs. We also conduct a further comparison experiment between textual alignment and multimodal alignment to highlight this drawback. To this end, we construct Visual Leakless Safety Bench (VLSBench) with 2.2k image-text pairs through an automated data pipeline. Experimental results indicate... | Xuhao Hu, Dongrui Liu, Hao Li, Xuanjing Huang, Jing Shao |  |

Humans easily ace these questions (scoring on average 98%), while the best-performing system scores around 56%. To facilitate progress toward addressing this challenging and aspirational use case for general AI assistants, we release 350 questions through a public leaderboard, retain the answers to 250 of them, and have the rest as a private test set. | Sky CHWang, Darshan Girish Deshpande, Smaranda Muresan, Anand Kannappan, Rebecca Qian |  |

We introduce “Data Laundering,” a process that enables the covert transfer of benchmark-specific knowledge through seemingly legitimate intermediate training steps. Through extensive experiments with a 2-layer BERT student model, we show how this approach can achieve substantial improvements in benchmark accuracy (up to 75% on GPQA) without developing genuine reasoning capabilities. Notably, this method can be exploited intentionally or even unintentionally, as researchers may inadvertently adopt this method and inflate scores without realising the implications. While our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique, we present them as a cautionary tale highlighting the urgent need for more robust evaluation methods in AI.

However, there are public concerns about the potential of this platform to promote and amplify harmful content. This study presents the first systematic analysis of conspiracy theories on TikTok. By leveraging the official TikTok Research API we collect a longitudinal dataset of 1.5M videos shared in the U.S. over three years. We estimate a lower bound on the prevalence of conspiratorial videos (up to 1000 new videos per month) and evaluate the effects of TikTok’s Creativity Program for monetization, observing an overall increase in video duration regardless of content. Lastly, we evaluate the capabilities of state-of-the-art open-weight Large Language Models to identify conspiracy theories from audio transcriptions of videos. While these models achieve high precision in detecting harmful content (up to 96%), their overall performance remains comparable to fine-tuned traditional models such as... | Francesco Corso, Francesco Pierri, Gianmarco De Francisci Morales |  |

While current approaches struggle with scalability and integration of episodic memory, which is particularly limited for medium-sized LMs (7B parameters), larger LMs (70-405B) offer untapped potential through their hierarchical representations and extensive pre-trained knowledge. Therefore, to unlock larger LMs’ potential for grounding, we present a scalable weak-to-strong episodic learning framework that efficiently transfers episodic behaviors from smaller to larger LMs. It uses Monte Carlo tree search for structured experience collection with a novel distillation method that preserves LM capabilities while incorporating episodic memory. This enables larger LMs to leverage their inherent advantages for improved physical planning. Experiments show our solution outperforms top proprietary LMs by 3.45% across diverse planning and... | Chunhui Zhang, Sirui Wang, Zhongyu Ouyang, Xiangchi Yuan, Soroush Vosoughi |  |

This includes unauthorized accesses to internal prompts and retrieval of personally identifiable information (PII) (e.g., in Retrieval-Augmented Generation based agentic applications). We examine these vulnerabilities in a question-answering (QA) setting where LLMs use retrieved documents or training knowledge as few-shot prompts. Although these documents remain confidential under normal use, adversaries can manipulate input queries to extract private content. In this paper, we propose a novel attack method by exploiting the model’s lower-ranked output tokens to leak sensitive information. We systematically evaluate our method, demonstrating its effectiveness in both the agentic application privacy extraction setting and the direct training data extraction. These findings reveal critical privacy risks in LLMs and emphasize the urgent need... | Yuan Zhou, Zhuo Zhang, Xiangyu Zhang |  |

Despite such visual inputs becoming more integrated into agentic applications, what types of risks and attacks exist around them still remain unclear. In this work, we demonstrate that VLM agents can be easily attacked by a set of carefully designed adversarial pop-ups, which human users would typically recognize and ignore. This distraction leads agents to click these pop-ups instead of performing their tasks as usual. Integrating these pop-ups into existing agent testing environments like OSWorld and VisualWebArena leads to an attack success rate (the frequency of the agent clicking the pop-ups) of 86% on average and decreases the task success rate by 47%. Basic defense techniques, such as asking the agent to ignore... | Yanzhe Zhang, Tao Yu, Diyi Yang |  |

To address this problem, we propose Augmentation framework for Social Event Detection (SED-Aug), a plug-and-play dual augmentation framework, which combines explicit text-based and implicit feature-space augmentation to enhance data diversity and model robustness. The explicit augmentation utilizes LLMs to enhance textual information through five diverse generation strategies. For implicit augmentation, we design five novel perturbation techniques that operate in the feature space on structural fused embeddings. These perturbations are crafted to keep the semantic and relational properties of the embeddings and make them more diverse. Specifically, SED-Aug outperforms the best baseline model by approximately 17.67% on the Twitter2012 dataset and by about 15.57% on the Twitter2018 dataset in terms of the average F1... | Congbo Ma, Yuxia Wang, Jia Wu, Jian Yang, Jing Du, Zitai Qiu, Qing Li, Hu Wang, Preslav Nakov |  |

External memory mechanisms have been proposed to address this limitation, enabling LLMs to maintain conversational continuity. However, existing approaches struggle with two key challenges. First, rigid memory granularity fails to capture the natural semantic structure of conversations, leading to fragmented and incomplete representations. Second, fixed retrieval mechanisms cannot adapt to diverse dialogue contexts and user interaction patterns. In this work, we propose Reflective Memory Management (RMM), a novel mechanism for long-term dialogue agents, integrating forward- and backward-looking reflections: (1) Prospective Reflection, which dynamically summarizes interactions across granularities—utterances, turns, and sessions—into... | Zhen Tan, Jun Yan, IHung Hsu, Rujun Han, Zifeng Wang, Long T.

We argue that, compared with grafting the sophisticated methods from other languages, focusing on classical Chinese’s inimitable source of __Ancient Literature__ could provide us with extra and comprehensive semantics in event extraction. Motivated by this, we propose a Literary Vision-Language Model (VLM) for classical Chinese event extraction, integrating with literature annotations, historical background and character glyph to capture the inner- and outer-context information from the sequence. Extensive experiments build a new state-of-the-art performance in the GuwenEE, CHED datasets, which underscores the effectiveness of our proposed VLM, and more importantly, these unique features can be obtained precisely at nearly zero cost. | Xiaoyi Bao, Zhongqing Wang, Jinghang Gu, ChuRen Huang |  |

In this paper, we introduce UAEval4RAG, a comprehensive evaluation framework designed to evaluate whether RAG systems effectively handle unanswerable queries specific to a given knowledge base. We first define a taxonomy with six unanswerable categories, and UAEval4RAG automatically synthesizes diverse and challenging queries for any given knowledge base and evaluate the RAG systems with unanswered ratio and acceptable ratio metrics. We also conduct experiments with various RAG components and prompting strategies across four datasets, which reveals that due to varying knowledge distribution across datasets, no single configuration consistently delivers optimal performance on both answerable and unanswerable requests across different knowledge bases. Our findings highlight the critical role of... | Xiangyu Peng, Prafulla Kumar Choubey, Caiming Xiong, ChienSheng Wu |  |

Particularly, in social science, this process usually relies on multiple rounds of manual annotation, domain expert discussion, and rule-based refinement. In this paper, we introduce SCALE, a novel multi-agent framework that effectively ̲Simulates ̲Content ̲Analysis via ̲Large language model (LLM) ag ̲Ents. SCALE imitates key phases of content analysis, including text coding, collaborative discussion, and dynamic codebook evolution, capturing the reflective depth and adaptive discussions of human researchers. Furthermore, by integrating diverse modes of human intervention, SCALE is augmented with expert input to further enhance its performance. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that SCALE achieves human-approximated performance across various complex content analysis tasks, offering an innovative potential for future social science research. | Chengshuai Zhao, Zhen Tan, ChauWai Wong, Xinyan Zhao, Tianlong Chen, Huan Liu |  |

Previous approaches to learning from errors synthesize training data by solely extrapolating from isolated bad cases, thereby failing to generalize the extensive patterns inherent within these cases. This paper presents Self-Error-Instruct (SEI), a framework that addresses these model weaknesses and synthesizes more generalized targeted training data. Specifically, we explore a target model on two mathematical datasets, GSM8K and MATH, to pinpoint bad cases. Then, we generate error keyphrases for these cases based on the instructor model’s (GPT-4o) analysis and identify error types by clustering these keyphrases. Next, we sample a few bad cases during each generation for each identified error type and input them into the instructor model, which synthesizes additional training data using a self-instruct approach. This new data is... | Erxin Yu, Jing Li, Ming Liao, Qi Zhu, Boyang Xue, Minghui Xu, Baojun Wang, Lanqing Hong, Fei Mi, Lifeng Shang |  |

However, evaluating the effectiveness of RAG systems in specialized scenarios remains challenging due to the high costs of data construction and the lack of suitable evaluation metrics. This paper introduces RAGEval, a framework designed to assess RAG systems across diverse scenarios by generating high-quality documents, questions, answers, and references through a schema-based pipeline. With a focus on factual accuracy, we propose three novel metrics—Completeness, Hallucination, and Irrelevance—to evaluate LLM-generated responses rigorously. Experimental results show that RAGEval outperforms zero-shot and one-shot methods in terms of clarity, safety, conformity, and richness of generated samples. Furthermore, the use of LLMs for scoring the proposed metrics demonstrates a high level of consistency with human evaluations. RAGEval establishes a new... | Kunlun Zhu, Yifan Luo, Dingling Xu, Yukun Yan, Zhenghao Liu, Shi Yu, Ruobing Wang, Shuo Wang, Yishan Li, Nan Zhang, Xu Han, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun |  |

To enable fine-grained evaluation, each example includes expert-annotated supporting evidence.We assess the performance of 21 state-of-the-art multimodal foundation models, including o4-mini, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Llama-3.2-Vision, and Qwen2.5-VL. Our experiment reveals a substantial performance gap between these models and human experts on SciVer.Through an in-depth analysis of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and human-conducted error evaluations, we identify critical limitations in current open-source models, offering key insights to advance models’ comprehension and reasoning in multimodal scientific literature tasks. | Chengye Wang, Yifei Shen, Zexi Kuang, Arman Cohan, Yilun Zhao |  |

In this paper, we introduce MultiAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based multi-agent systems across diverse, interactive scenarios. Our framework measures not only task completion but also the quality of collaboration and competition using novel, milestone-based key performance indicators. Moreover, we evaluate various coordination protocols (including star, chain, tree, and graph topologies) and innovative strategies such as group discussion and cognitive planning. Notably, cognitive planning improves milestone achievement rates by 3%. Code and dataset will be made publicly available.

However, their effectiveness is highly dependent on available pre-training resources, which is particularly challenging for low-resource languages such as Sinhala. Furthermore, the scarcity of benchmarks to evaluate LMs is also a major concern for low-resource languages. In this paper, we address these two challenges for Sinhala by (i) collecting the largest monolingual corpus for Sinhala, (ii) training multiple LMs on this corpus and (iii) compiling the first Sinhala NLP benchmark (Sinhala-GLUE) and evaluating LMs on it. We show the Sinhala LMs trained in this paper outperform the popular multilingual LMs, such as XLM-R and existing Sinhala LMs in downstream NLP tasks. All the trained LMs are publicly available. We also make Sinhala-GLUE publicly available as a public leaderboard, and we hope that it will enable further advancements in developing and evaluating LMs for... | Tharindu Ranasinghe, Hansi Hettiarachchi, Nadeesha Chathurangi Naradde Vidana Pathirana, Damith Premasiri, Lasitha Uyangodage, Isuri Anuradha Nanomi Arachchige, Alistair Plum, Paul Rayson, Ruslan Mitkov |  |

Using a corpus of literature reviews written by L2 graduate students and assessed by human experts against 9 analytic criteria, we prompt several popular LLMs to perform the same task under various conditions. To evaluate the quality of feedback comments, we apply a novel feedback comment quality evaluation framework. This framework is interpretable, cost-efficient, scalable, and reproducible, compared to existing methods that rely on manual judgments. We find that LLMs can generate reasonably good and generally reliable multi-dimensional analytic assessments. We release our corpus and code for reproducibility. | Zhengxiang Wang, Veronika Makarova, Zhi Li, Jordan Kodner, Owen Rambow |  |

Despite these strides, sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs–a key subset of the LLM family–have remained unexplored in the context of unlearning. As MoE LLMs are celebrated for their exceptional performance, we ask:How can unlearning be performed effectively and efficiently on MoE LLMs? Our pilot study shows that the dynamic routing nature of MoE LLMs introduces unique challenges, leading to excessive forgetting, uncontrolled knowledge erasure and substantial utility drops when existing unlearning methods are applied. To address this, we propose a novel Selected-Expert Unlearning Framework (SEUF). Through expert attribution, unlearning is concentrated on the most actively engaged experts for the specified knowledge. Concurrently, an anchor loss is applied to the router to stabilize the active state of this... | Haomin Zhuang, Yihua Zhang, Kehan Guo, Jinghan Jia, Gaowen Liu, Sijia Liu, Xiangliang Zhang |  |

Despite recent advances in language technologies, including large language models, evaluating their ability to handle pragmatic phenomena such as implicatures and references remains challenging. To advance pragmatic abilities in models, it is essential to understand current evaluation trends and identify existing limitations. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of resources designed for evaluating pragmatic capabilities in NLP, categorizing datasets by the pragmatic phenomena they address. We analyze task designs, data collection methods, evaluation approaches, and their relevance to real-world applications. By examining these resources in the context of modern language models, we highlight emerging trends, challenges, and gaps in existing benchmarks.

This study addresses this gap by introducing COSMMIC, a pioneering comment-sensitive multimodal, multilingual dataset featuring nine major Indian languages. COSMMIC comprises 4,959 article-image pairs and 24,484 reader comments, with ground-truth summaries available in all included languages. Our approach enhances summaries by integrating reader insights and feedback. We explore summarization and headline generation across four configurations: (1) using article text alone, (2) incorporating user comments, (3) utilizing images, and (4) combining text, comments, and images.

This has driven research into Large Audio Models (LAMs) to power voice-native experiences. However, aligning LAM development with user goals requires a clear understanding of user needs and preferences to establish reliable progress metrics. This study addresses these challenges by introducing an interactive approach to evaluate LAMs and collecting 7,500 LAM interactions from 484 participants. Through topic modeling of user queries, we identify primary use cases for audio interfaces. We then analyze user preference rankings and qualitative feedback to determine which models best align with user needs. Finally, we evaluate how static benchmarks predict interactive performance - our analysis reveals no individual benchmark strongly correlates with interactive results (𝜏 ≤ 0.33 for all benchmarks).

To remove any prior knowledge of Manchu encoded in the LLM parameters and single out the effect of ICL, we also experiment with an enciphered version of Manchu texts.Our results indicate that high-quality dictionaries and good parallel examples are very helpful, while grammars... | Renhao Pei, Yihong Liu, Peiqin Lin, François Yvon, Hinrich Schütze |  |

Traditional evaluation paradigms, reliant on static datasets and closed-world assumptions, fail to account the BDC risk in large-scale pre-training of current LLMs. This paper introduces TripleFact, a novel evaluation framework for fake news detection task, which designed to mitigate BDC risk while prioritizing real-world applicability. TripleFact integrates three components: (1) Human-Adversarial Preference Testing (HAPT) to assess robustness against human-crafted misinformation, (2) Real-Time Web Agent with Asynchronous Validation (RTW-AV) to evaluate temporal generalization using dynamically sourced claims, and (3) Entity-Controlled Virtual Environment (ECVE) to eliminate entity-specific biases.

We propose the task of anaphora accessibility as a diagnostic for assessing discourse understanding, and to this end, present an evaluation dataset inspired by theoretical research in dynamic semantics. We evaluate human and LLM performance on our dataset and find that LLMs and humans align on some tasks and diverge on others. Such divergence can be explained by LLMs’ reliance on specific lexical items during language comprehension, in contrast to human sensitivity to structural abstractions. | Xiaomeng Zhu, Zhenghao Zhou, Simon Charlow, Robert Frank |  |

Even on tasks where they appear to perform well, their performance often depends on shortcuts, rather than on genuine reasoning abilities, leading them to collapse on out-of-distribution (OOD) examples. Post-training strategies based on reinforcement learning and chain-of-thought prompting have recently been hailed as a step change. However, little is known about the potential of the resulting “Large Reasoning Models” (LRMs) beyond maths and programming-based problem solving, where genuine OOD problems can be sparse. In this paper, we focus on tasks that require systematic relational composition for qualitative spatial and temporal reasoning. The setting allows fine control over problem difficulty to precisely measure OOD generalization. We find that, zero-shot LRMs generally outperform their LLM counterparts in single-path reasoning tasks but struggle in the multi-path setting.

Recent work has shown that guiding models with intermediate steps—such as keywords, outlines, or reasoning chains—can significantly improve performance, coherence, and interpretability. However, these methods often depend on predefined intermediate formats and annotated data, limiting their scalability and generalizability. In this work, we introduce a task-agnostic framework that enables models to generate intermediate “warmup” sequences. These warmup sequences, serving as an initial state for subsequent generation, are optimized to enhance the probability of generating the target sequence without relying on external supervision or human-designed structures. Drawing inspiration from reinforcement learning principles, our method iteratively refines these intermediate steps to maximize their contribution to the final output, similar to... | Senyu Li, Zipeng Sun, Jiayi Wang, Xue Liu, Pontus Stenetorp, Siva Reddy, David Ifeoluwa Adelani |  |

As a powerful means of communication, it reflects identities, cultures, traditions, and societies more broadly. Therefore, data in a given language should be regarded as more than just a collection of tokens. Rigorous data collection and labeling practices are essential for developing more human-centered and socially aware technologies. Although there has been growing interest in under-resourced languages within the NLP community, work in this area faces unique challenges, such as data scarcity and limited access to qualified annotators.In this paper, we collect feedback from individuals directly involved in and impacted by NLP artefacts for medium- and low-resource languages. We conduct both quantitative and qualitative analyses of their responses and highlight key issues related to: (1) data quality, including linguistic and cultural appropriateness; and (2) the ethics of common... | Nedjma Ousidhoum, Meriem Beloucif, Saif M.

Although emotion recognition–an umbrella term for several NLP tasks–impacts various applications within NLP and beyond, most work in this area has focused on high-resource languages. This has led to significant disparities in research efforts and proposed solutions, particularly for under-resourced languages, which often lack high-quality annotated datasets.In this paper, we present BRIGHTER–a collection of multi-labeled, emotion-annotated datasets in 28 different languages and across several domains. BRIGHTER primarily covers low-resource languages from Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America, with instances labeled by fluent speakers. We highlight the challenges related to the data collection and annotation processes, and then report experimental results for monolingual and crosslingual multi-label emotion identification, as well as emotion intensity recognition.

A granular, skill-specific understanding of model capabilities can empower researchers to make informed model development plans. In this paper, we introduce SkillVerse, an unsupervised tree-structured diagnosis framework for understanding model proficiency in specific abilities. With LLM as a judge, SkillVerse first critiques the model responses, and then organizes them into a hierarchical structure termed dendrogram. Given proficiency at arbitrary levels of granularity, SkillVerse is flexible to produce insights of behaviors of modern large models. We also demonstrate its efficacy in two downstream tasks: 1) improving model in-context learning by 25% using a tree-search algorithm to select more informative few-shot demonstrations, and 2) accurately predicting new model weaknesses with a 55% success rate, 22% higher than without SkillVerse. | Yufei Tian, Jiao Sun, Nanyun Peng, Zizhao Zhang |  |

Despite decades of research on knowledge graphs and knowledge base question answering, leading LLM frameworks (Langchain and LlamaIndex) have only minimal support for retrieval from modern encyclopedic knowledge graphs like Wikidata. In this paper, we analyze the root cause and suggest that modern RDF knowledge graphs (Wikidata, Freebase) are less efficient for LLMs due to overly large schemas that far exceed the typical LLM context window, use of resource identifiers, overlapping and ambiguous relation types and lack of normalization. As a solution, we propose property graph views on top of the underlying RDF graph that can be efficiently queried by LLMs using Cypher. We instantiated this idea on Wikidata and introduced CypherBench, the first benchmark with 11 large-scale,... | Yanlin Feng, Simone Papicchio, Sajjadur Rahman |  |

To investigate the use of personal perspective in empathy prediction, we collected a dataset, EmpathyFromPerspectives, where a user rates their empathy towards a story by a person with a different perspective on a prompted topic. We observed in the dataset that user perspective can be important for empathy prediction and developed a model, PPEP, that uses a rater’s perspective as context for predicting the rater’s empathy towards a story. Experiments comparing PPEP with baseline models show that use of personal perspective significantly improves performance. A user study indicated that human empathy ratings of stories generally agreed with PPEP’s relative empathy rankings. | Francine Chen, Scott A.

Leveraging adaptive RAG for interpretable mental health screening through psychometric practice](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.440/) |  | 0 | In psychological practice, standardized questionnaires serve as essential tools for assessing mental health through structured, clinically-validated questions (i.e., items). While social media platforms offer rich data for mental health screening, computational approaches often bypass these established clinical assessment tools in favor of black-box classification. We propose a novel questionnaire-guided screening framework that bridges psychological practice and computational methods through adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (aRAG). Our approach links unstructured social media content and standardized clinical assessments by retrieving relevant posts for each questionnaire item and using Large Language Models (LLMs) to complete validated psychological instruments. Our findings demonstrate two key advantages of questionnaire-guided screening: First, when completing the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), our approach matches or outperforms state-of-the-art performance on... | Federico Ravenda, Seyed Ali Bahrainian, Andrea Raballo, Antonietta Mira, Noriko Kando |  |

This paper explores how LLMs can transition to interactive, question-driven learning through student-teacher dialogues. We introduce INTERACT (INTERactive learning for Adaptive Concept Transfer), a framework in which a “student” LLM engages a “teacher” LLM through iterative inquiries to acquire knowledge across 1,347 contexts, including song lyrics, news articles, movie plots, academic papers, and images. Our experiments show that across a wide range of scenarios and LLM architectures, interactive learning consistently enhances performance, achieving up to a 25% improvement, with ‘cold-start’ student models matching static learning baselines in as few as five dialogue turns. Interactive setups can also mitigate the disadvantages of weaker teachers, showcasing the robustness of question-driven learning. | Aum Kendapadi, Kerem Zaman, Rakesh R.

Rapid development of state-of-the-art models induce benchmark saturation, while creating more challenging datasets is labor-intensive. Inspired by the recent developments in mechanistic interpretability, we introduce circuit stability as a new way to assess model performance. Circuit stability refers to a model’s ability to apply a consistent reasoning process–its circuit–across various inputs. We mathematically formalize circuit stability and circuit equivalence. Then, through three case studies, we empirically show that circuit stability and the lack thereof can characterize and predict different aspects of generalization. Our proposed methods offer a step towards rigorously relating the generality of models to their interpretability. | Alan Sun |  |

The comparison is based on a formal syntactic theory. We use Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) to analyze the grammatical structure of the texts. We then investigate and illustrate the differences in the distributions of HPSG grammar types, revealing systematic distinctions between human and LLM-generated writing.

We propose using linear classifying probes, trained by leveraging differences between contrasting pairs of prompts, to directly access LLMs’ latent knowledge and extract more accurate preferences. Through extensive experiments using models of varying size from four different families and six diverse datasets assessing text quality evaluation and common sense reasoning, we demonstrate that both supervised and unsupervised probing approaches consistently outperform traditional generation-based judgement while maintaining similar computational costs. These probes generalise under domain shifts and can even outperform finetuned evaluators with the same training data size. Our results suggest linear probing offers an accurate, robust and computationally efficient approach for LLM-as-judge tasks while providing interpretable insights into... | Sharan Maiya, Yinhong Liu, Ramit Debnath, Anna Korhonen |  |

Benchmarking and Mitigating Language Agency Social Biases in LLMs](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.445/) |  | 0 | Social biases can manifest in language agency. However, very limited research has investigated such biases in Large Language Model (LLM)-generated content. In addition, previous works often rely on string-matching techniques to identify agentic and communal words within texts, falling short of accurately classifying language agency. We introduce the \*\*Language Agency Bias Evaluation (LABE)\*\* benchmark, which comprehensively evaluates biases in LLMs by analyzing agency levels attributed to different demographic groups in model generations. LABE tests for gender, racial, and intersectional language agency biases in LLMs on 3 text generation tasks: biographies, professor reviews, and reference letters. Using LABE, we unveil language agency social biases in 3 recent LLMs: ChatGPT, Llama3, and Mistral. We observe that: (1) LLM generations tend to demonstrate greater gender bias than human-written texts; (2) Models demonstrate remarkably higher levels of intersectional bias than the... | Yixin Wan, KaiWei Chang |  |

However, verifying these statements remains challenging due to their complex, diversified language and the sheer number of statements that must be reviewed. The development of NLP tools to assist in this task is also difficult due to a scarcity of annotated data. Furthermore, as modern slavery transparency legislation has been introduced in several countries, the generalizability of such tools across legal jurisdictions must be studied. To address these challenges, we work with domain experts to make two key contributions. First, we present AIMS.uk and AIMS.ca, newly annotated datasets from the UK and Canada to enable cross-jurisdictional evaluation. Second, we introduce AIMSCheck, an end-to-end framework for compliance validation. AIMSCheck decomposes the compliance assessment task into three levels, enhancing... | Adriana Eufrosina Bora, Akshatha Arodi, Duoyi Zhang, Jordan Bannister, Mirko Bronzi, Arsène Fansi Tchango, Md.

Since they often serve as the first step in these systems, their robustness is critical to avoid downstream failures. In this work, we repurpose a relation extraction dataset (e.g., Re-DocRED) to design controlled experiments that quantify the impact of heuristic biases, such as a preference for shorter documents, on retrievers like Dragon+ and Contriever. We uncover major vulnerabilities, showing retrievers favor shorter documents, early positions, repeated entities, and literal matches, all while ignoring the answer’s presence! Notably, when multiple biases combine, models exhibit catastrophic performance degradation, selecting the answer-containing document in less than 10% of cases over a synthetic biased document without the answer. Furthermore, we show that these biases have direct consequences for downstream applications like RAG, where... | Mohsen Fayyaz, Ali Modarressi, Hinrich Schütze, Nanyun Peng |  |

However, recent studies have found that LMs often struggle to fully comprehend and utilize key evidence from the context, especially when it contains noise and irrelevant information—an issue common in real-world scenarios.To address this, we propose SelfElicit, an inference-time approach that helps LMs focus on key contextual evidence through self-guided explicit highlighting.By leveraging the inherent evidence-finding capabilities of LMs using the attention scores of deeper layers, our method automatically identifies and emphasizes key evidence within the input context, facilitating more accurate and grounded responses without additional training or iterative prompting.We demonstrate that SelfElicit brings consistent and significant improvement on multiple evidence-based QA tasks for various LM... | Zhining Liu, Rana Ali Amjad, Ravinarayana Adkathimar, Tianxin Wei, Hanghang Tong |  |

However, significant biases remain when generating images with more than one person. To systematically evaluate this, we propose the \*\*Paired Stereotype Test (PST)\*\* framework, which queries T2I models to depict two individuals assigned with male-stereotyped and female-stereotyped social identities, respectively (e.g. “a CEO” and “an Assistant”). This contrastive setting often triggers T2I models to generate gender-stereotyped images. Using PST, we evaluate two aspects of gender biases – the well-known \*\*bias in gendered occupation\*\* and a novel aspect: \*\*bias in organizational power\*\*. Experiments show that \*\*over 74% images generated by DALLE-3 display gender-occupational biases\*\*. Additionally, compared to single-person settings, DALLE-3 is more likely to perpetuate male-associated stereotypes under PST. We further propose... | Yixin Wan, KaiWei Chang |  |

This reliance hinders generalization on minority examples, where such correlations do not hold. Existing shortcut mitigation approaches are model-specific, difficult to tune, computationally expensive, and fail to improve learned representations. To address these issues, we propose InterpoLated Learning (InterpoLL) which interpolates the representations of majority examples to include features from intra-class minority examples with shortcut-mitigating patterns. This weakens shortcut influence, enabling models to acquire features predictive across both minority and majority examples. Experimental results on multiple natural language understanding tasks demonstrate that InterpoLL improves minority generalization over both ERM and state-of-the-art mitigation... | Michalis Korakakis, Andreas Vlachos, Adrian Weller |  |

For the first time, this paper presents an iterative algorithm inspired by human phonetic discovery, which is based on minimal pairs that determine phonemes by distinguishing different words in human language, and is able to produce a complete alphabet of distinct canine phoneme-like units. In addition, the algorithm produces a number of canine repeated acoustic units, which may correspond to specific environments and activities of a dog, composed exclusively of the canine phoneme-like units in the alphabet. The framework outlined in this paper is expected to function not only on canines but other animal species. | Theron S. Wang, Xingyuan Li, Hridayesh Lekhak, Tuan Minh Dang, Mengyue Wu, Kenny Q.

DavIR generalizes Reducible Holdout Loss to core-set selection problem of causal language modeling, and quantifies the learnability of a given datum with respect to a pre-trained LLM based on relative reduction in loss during fine-tuning, a metric we show to be closely related to the implicit reward model described in Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We show that 6% of Alpaca dataset selected with DavIR can steer both the LLaMA and Gemma model family to produce superior performance compared to the same models trained on the full 52K dataset. We also show that Alpaca dataset compressed with DavIR can be combined with GSM8K dataset to effectively balance open-domain freeform QA and mathematical reasoning capabilities. Finally, we apply the DavIR objective to DPO and develop a normalized DavIR-DPO objective which improves alignment performance of Zephyr-7B-SFT model by 8% (relative) on... | Haotian Zhou, Tingkai Liu, Qianli Ma, Yufeng Zhang, Jianbo Yuan, Pengfei Liu, Yang You, Hongxia Yang |  |

BLT encodes bytes into dynamically sized patches, which serve as the primary units of computation. Patches are segmented based on the entropy of the next byte, allocating more compute and model capacity where increased data complexity demands it. We present the first FLOP controlled scaling study of byte-level models – up to 8B parameters and 4T training bytes – demonstrating the feasibility of scaling models trained on raw bytes without a fixed vocabulary. Both training and inference efficiency improve due to dynamically selecting long patches when data is predictable, along with qualitative improvements on reasoning and long tail generalization. For fixed inference costs, BLT shows significantly better scaling than tokenization-based models, by... | Artidoro Pagnoni, Ramakanth Pasunuru, Pedro Rodríguez, John Nguyen, Benjamin Muller, Margaret Li, Chunting Zhou, Lili Yu, Jason E.

However, adversarial attacks continue to pose a critical challenge to system built using these models, as they can be exploited with carefully crafted adversarial texts. Inspired by the ability of diffusion models to predict and reduce noise in computer vision, we propose a novel and flexible adversarial defense method for language classification tasks, DiffuseDef, which incorporates a diffusion layer as a denoiser between the encoder and the classifier. The diffusion layer is trained on top of the existing classifier, ensuring seamless integration with any model in a plug-and-play manner. During inference, the adversarial hidden state is first combined with sampled noise, then denoised iteratively and finally ensembled to produce a robust text representation. By integrating adversarial training, denoising, and ensembling techniques, we show that DiffuseDef improves... | Zhenhao Li, Huichi Zhou, Marek Rei, Lucia Specia |  |

Clustering of captured cells/spots in the spatial transcriptomic data is crucial for understanding tissue niches and uncovering disease-related changes.Current methods to cluster spatial transcriptomic data encounter obstacles, including inefficiency in handling multi-replicate data, lack of prior knowledge incorporation, and producing uninterpretable cluster labels.We introduce a novel approach, LLMiniST, to identify spatial niche using a zero-shot large language models (LLMs) by transforming spatial transcriptomic data into spatial context prompts, leveraging gene expression of neighboring cells/spots, cell type composition, tissue information, and external knowledge. The model was further enhanced using a two-stage fine-tuning strategy for improved generalizability.

While toxic language detection has been under-explored in Persian, the current work compares different methods for this task, including fine-tuning, data enrichment, zero-shot and few-shot learning, and cross-lingual transfer learning. What is especially compelling is the impact of cultural context on transfer learning for this task: We show that the language of a country with cultural similarities to Persian yields better results in transfer learning. Conversely, the improvement is lower when the language comes from a culturally distinct country. | Zahra Bokaei, Walid Magdy, Bonnie Webber |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce Bitnet.cpp, an inference system optimized for BitNet b1.58 and ternary LLMs. Given that mixed-precision matrix multiplication (mpGEMM) constitutes the bulk of inference time in ternary LLMs, Bitnet.cpp incorporates a novel mpGEMM library to facilitate sub-2-bits-per-weight, efficient and lossless inference. The library features two core solutions: Ternary Lookup Table (TL), which addresses spatial inefficiencies of previous bit-wise methods, and Int2 with a Scale (I2_S), which ensures lossless edge inference, both enabling high-speed inference. Our experiments show that Bitnet.cpp achieves up to a 6.25x increase in speed over full-precision baselines and up to 2.32x over low-bit baselines, setting new benchmarks in the field.... | Jinheng Wang, Hansong Zhou, Ting Song, Shijie Cao, Yan Xia, Ting Cao, Jianyu Wei, Shuming Ma, Hongyu Wang, Furu Wei |  |

This work examines undersampling methods to mitigate such bias in Small and Large Language Model (SLMs and LLMs) classifiers. Based on the limitations found in existing solutions, we propose two novel undersampling methods inspired by state-of-the-art Instance Selection techniques, relying on calibrated confidences and semantic difficulty estimates. We compare them against 19 baselines across 13 datasets, evaluating: (i) effectiveness, (ii) class imbalance bias, (iii) efficiency, (iv) scalability, and (v) consistency. Results show our methods uniquely reduce classifier bias (up to 56%) across all datasets without effectiveness loss while improving efficiency (1.6x speedup), scalability and reducing carbon emissions (up to 50%). | Guilherme Fonseca, Washington Cunha, Gabriel Prenassi, Marcos André Gonçalves, Leonardo Chaves Dutra da Rocha |  |

However, the substantial memory requirements associated with fine-tuning pose a significant barrier to extending the applicability of LLMs. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning can be a promising approach by reducing trainable parameters, intermediate activations still need to be cached to compute gradients during the backward pass, thereby limiting overall memory efficiency. In this work, we propose Saliency-Guided Gradient Flow (SAGE), a memory-efficient fine-tuning method designed to minimize the memory specifically associated with cached intermediate activations. The key strategy is to selectively cache activations based on their saliency during the forward pass and then use these activations for the backward pass. This process transforms the dense backward pass into a sparse one, thereby enhancing memory efficiency. To verify whether SAGE can serve as an... | Yeachan Kim, SangKeun Lee |  |

Existing methods primarily rely on inference-time interventions, which are limited in attention adaptation or require additional supervision. To address this, we propose A3Tune, a novel fine-tuning framework for Automatic Attention Alignment Tuning. ATune leverages zero-shot weak labels from SAM, refines them into prompt-aware labels using BioMedCLIP, and then selectively modifies visually-critical attention heads to improve alignment while minimizing interference. Additionally, we introduce a A3MoE module, enabling adaptive parameter selection for attention tuning across diverse prompts and images. Extensive experiments on medical VQA and report generation benchmarks show that A3Tune outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving enhanced attention distributions and performance in Med-LVLMs. | Aofei Chang, Le Huang, Alex James Boyd, Parminder Bhatia, Taha A.

This has led to the development of various personalized approaches aimed at adapting large language models (LLMs) to generate customized outputs aligned with user preferences. Some of them involve fine-tuning a unique personalized LLM for each user, which is too expensive for widespread application. Alternative approaches introduce personalization information in a plug-and-play manner by retrieving the user’s relevant historical texts as demonstrations. However, this retrieval-based strategy may break the continuity of the user history and fail to capture the user’s overall styles and patterns, hence leading to sub-optimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel personalized LLM model, PPlug. It constructs a user-specific embedding for each individual by modeling all her historical contexts... | Jiongnan Liu, Yutao Zhu, Shuting Wang, Xiaochi Wei, Erxue Min, Yu Lu, Shuaiqiang Wang, Dawei Yin, Zhicheng Dou |  |

This study proposes a method for integrating the developmental characteristics of working memory during the critical period, a stage when human language acquisition is particularly efficient, into the training process of language models. The proposed method introduces a mechanism that initially constrains working memory during the early stages of training and gradually relaxes this constraint in an exponential manner as learning progresses. Targeted syntactic evaluation shows that the proposed method outperforms conventional methods without memory constraints or with static memory constraints. These findings not only provide new directions for designing data-efficient language models but also offer indirect evidence supporting the role of the developmental characteristics of working memory as the underlying mechanism of the critical period in language acquisition. | Masato Mita, Ryo Yoshida, Yohei Oseki |  |

While recent LLM-based methods excel at identifying commonly known causal relations, they fail to uncover novel relations. We introduce IRIS (Iterative Retrieval and Integrated System for Real-Time Causal Discovery), a novel framework that addresses these limitations. Starting with a set of initial variables, IRIS automatically collects relevant documents, extracts variables, and uncovers causal relations. Our hybrid causal discovery method combines statistical algorithms and LLM-based methods to discover known and novel causal relations. In addition to causal discovery on initial variables, the missing variable proposal component of IRIS identifies and incorporates missing variables to expand the causal graphs. Our approach enables real-time causal... | Tao Feng, Lizhen Qu, Niket Tandon, Gholamreza Haffari |  |

However, current large-scale benchmarks for these tasks often exclude evaluations of low-resource languages and rely on translations from English benchmarks, thereby predominantly reflecting Western-centric concepts. In this paper, we introduce “INJONGO” - a multicultural, open-source benchmark dataset for 16 African languages with utterances generated by native speakers across diverse domains, including banking, travel, home, and dining. Through extensive experiments, we benchmark fine-tuning multilingual transformer models and prompting large language models (LLMs), and show the advantage of leveraging African-cultural utterances over Western-centric utterances for improving cross-lingual transfer from the English language. Experimental results reveal that current LLMs struggle with the slot-filling task, with GPT-4o achieving an average performance of 26 F1. In contrast, intent detection performance... | Hao Yu, Jesujoba Oluwadara Alabi, Andiswa Bukula, Jian Yun Zhuang, EnShiun Annie Lee, Tadesse Kebede Guge, Israel Abebe Azime, Happy Buzaaba, Blessing Kudzaishe Sibanda, Godson Koffi Kalipe, Jonathan Mukiibi, Salomon Kabongo Kabenamualu, Mmasibidi Setaka, Lolwethu Ndolela, Nkiruka Odu, Rooweither Mabuya, Shamsuddeen Hassan Muhammad, Salomey Osei, Sokhar Samb, Dietrich Klakow, David Ifeoluwa Adelani |  |

For information-seeking tasks, full context perception is often unnecessary, as a query’s information needs can dynamically range from localized details to a global perspective, depending on its complexity. However, existing methods struggle to adapt effectively to this dynamic information needs.In the paper, we propose a method for processing long-context information-seeking tasks via query-guided ACtivation REfilling (ACRE). ACRE constructs a Bi-layer KV Cache for long contexts, where the layer-1 (L1) cache compactly captures global information, and the layer-2 (L2) cache provides detailed, localized information. ACRE establishes a proxying relationship between the two caches, allowing the input query to attend to the L1 cache and dynamically... | Hongjin Qian, Zheng Liu, Peitian Zhang, Zhicheng Dou, Defu Lian |  |

While various methods have been proposed to enhance data efficiency, limited research has addressed the inherent conflicts between these approaches to achieve optimal data selection for LM pretraining. To tackle this problem, we propose a multi-actor collaborative data selection mechanism. Each data selection method independently prioritizes data based on its specific criterion and updates its prioritization rules using the current state of the model, functioning as an independent actor for data selection. Additionally, a console is designed to adjust the impacts of different actors at various stages and dynamically integrate information from all actors throughout the LM pretraining process. We conduct extensive empirical studies to evaluate our multi-actor framework. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves data efficiency, accelerates convergence in LM... | Tianyi Bai, Ling Yang, Zhen Hao Wong, Fupeng Sun, Xinlin Zhuang, Jiahui Peng, Chi Zhang, Lijun Wu, Jiantao Qiu, Wentao Zhang, Binhang Yuan, Conghui He |  |

Many parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods have emerged to address this challenge. However, they lack flexibility, like LoRA requires manually selecting trainable parameters and rank size, (IA)3 can only scale the activations along columns, yielding inferior results due to less precise fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose a novel method named AdaDHP with fewer parameters and finer granularity, which can adaptively select important parameters for each task. Specifically, we introduce two trainable vectors for each parameter and fine-tune the parameters through Hadamard product along both rows and columns. This significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters, with our parameter count capped at the lower limit of LoRA. Moreover, we design an adaptive parameter selection strategy to select important parameters for... | Han Liu, Changya Li, Xiaotong Zhang, Feng Zhang, Fenglong Ma, Wei Wang, Hong Yu |  |

Inspired by existing methods that design the interaction strategy between LLMs and KG, we propose an autonomous LLM-based agent framework, called KG-Agent, which enables a small LLM to actively make decisions until finishing the reasoning process over KGs. In KG-Agent, we integrate the LLM, multifunctional toolbox, KG-based executor, and knowledge memory, and develop an iteration mechanism that autonomously selects the tool and then updates the memory for reasoning over KG. To guarantee the effectiveness, we leverage program language to formulate the multi-hop reasoning process over the KG and synthesize a code-based instruction dataset to fine-tune the base LLM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that only using 10K samples for tuning LLaMA2-7B can outperform competitive methods using larger LLMs or more data, on both in-domain and out-domain... | Jinhao Jiang, Kun Zhou, Xin Zhao, Yang Song, Chen Zhu, Hengshu Zhu, JiRong Wen |  |

However, on datasets exhibiting spurious correlations, we observed that PEFT slows down the model’s convergence on unbiased examples, while the convergence on biased examples remains fast. This leads to the model’s overfitting on biased examples, causing significant performance degradation in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Traditional debiasing methods mitigate this issue by emphasizing unbiased examples during training but often come at the cost of in-distribution (ID) performance drops. To address this trade-off issue, we propose a curriculum debiasing framework that presents examples in a biased-to-unbiased order. Our framework initially limits the model’s exposure to unbiased examples, which are harder to learn, allowing it to first establish a foundation on easier-to-converge biased examples. As training progresses, we gradually... | Mingyu Lee, Yeachan Kim, WingLam Mok, SangKeun Lee |  |

ContextualJudgeBench for Evaluating LLM-based Judges in Contextual Settings](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.470/) |  | 0 | The large language model (LLM)-as-judge paradigm has been used to meet the demand for a cheap, reliable, and fast evaluation of model outputs during AI system development and post-deployment monitoring. While judge models—LLMs finetuned to specialize in assessing and critiquing model outputs—have been touted as general purpose evaluators, they are typically evaluated only on non-contextual scenarios, such as instruction following. The omission of contextual settings—those where external information is used as context to generate an output—is surprising given the increasing prevalence of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and summarization use cases. Contextual assessment is uniquely challenging, as evaluation often depends on practitioner priorities, leading to conditional evaluation criteria (e.g., comparing responses based on factuality and then considering completeness if they are equally factual). To address the gap, we propose ContextualJudgeBench, a judge benchmark with 2,000... | Austin Xu, Srijan Bansal, Yifei Ming, Semih Yavuz, Shafiq Joty |  |

Using newly available open-source LLMs, OLMo and BLOOM, which provide access to their pre-training corpora, we investigate how LLMs address causal discovery through three research questions. We examine: (i) the impact of memorization for accurate causal relation prediction, (ii) the influence of incorrect causal relations in pre-training data, and (iii) the contextual nuances that influence LLMs’ understanding of causal relations. Our findings indicate that while LLMs are effective in recognizing causal relations that occur frequently in pre-training data, their ability to generalize to new or rare causal relations is limited. Moreover, the presence of incorrect causal relations significantly undermines the confidence of LLMs in corresponding correct causal relations, and the contextual information critically affects the outcomes of LLMs to discern causal connections between random variables. | Tao Feng, Lizhen Qu, Niket Tandon, Zhuang Li, Xiaoxi Kang, Gholamreza Haffari |  |

However, evaluations often remain limited to functional tasks, neglecting abstract dimensions such as personality traits and human values. To address this gap, we introduce Value-Spectrum, a novel Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark aimed at assessing VLMs based on Schwartz’s value dimensions that capture core human values guiding people’s preferences and actions. We design a VLM agent pipeline to simulate video browsing and construct a vector database comprising over 50,000 short videos from TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram Reels. These videos span multiple months and cover diverse topics, including family, health, hobbies, society, technology, etc. Benchmarking on Value-Spectrum highlights notable variations in how VLMs handle value-oriented content.

Existing methods often struggle to capture both the long-term changes and short-term variability of relations, which are crucial for accurate prediction. In this paper, we propose a novel method called TeRDy for temporal knowledge graph completion. TeRDy captures temporal relational dynamics by utilizing time-invariant embeddings, along with long-term temporally dynamic embeddings (e.g., enduring political alliances) and short-term temporally dynamic embeddings (e.g., transient political events). These two types of embeddings are derived from low- and high-frequency components via frequency decomposition.

However, these methods frequently produce excessive fragmentation and semantic loss, failing to maintain the structural and semantic integrity of material concepts. To address this issue, we propose MATTER, a novel tokenization approach that integrates material knowledge into tokenization. Based on MatDetector trained on our materials knowledge base and re-ranking method prioritizing material terms in token merging, MATTER maintains the structural integrity of identified materials concepts and prevents fragmentation during tokenization, ensuring their semantic meaning remains intact. The experimental results demonstrate that MATTER outperforms existing tokenization methods, achieving an average performance gain of 4% and 2% in the generation and classification tasks, respectively. These results... | Yerim Oh, JunHyung Park, Junho Kim, SungHo Kim, SangKeun Lee |  |

Existing methods to evaluate privacy leakage in LLMs often use memorized prefixes or simple instructions to extract data, both of which well-alignment models can easily block. Meanwhile, Jailbreak attacks bypass LLM safety mechanisms to generate harmful content, but their role in privacy scenarios remains underexplored. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of jailbreak attacks in extracting sensitive information, bridging privacy leakage and jailbreak attacks in LLMs. Moreover, we propose PIG, a novel framework targeting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and addressing the limitations of current jailbreak methods. Specifically, PIG identifies PII entities and their types in privacy queries, uses in-context learning to build a privacy context, and iteratively updates it with three gradient-based strategies to elicit target PII. We evaluate PIG and existing jailbreak methods using two... | Yidan Wang, Yanan Cao, Yubing Ren, Fang Fang, Zheng Lin, Binxing Fang |  |

In this work, we innovatively focus on attacking pragmatic systems that have constrains such as limited token bandwidth, latency between message delivery, and defense mechanisms. We design a permutation-invariant adversarial attack that optimizes prompt distribution across latency and bandwidth-constraint network topologies to bypass distributed safety mechanisms within the system. Formulating the attack path as a problem of maximum-flow minimum-cost, coupled with the novel Permutation-Invariant Evasion Loss (PIEL), we leverage graph-based optimization to maximize attack success rate while minimizing detection risk. Evaluating across models including Llama, Mistral, Gemma, DeepSeek and other variants on various datasets like JailBreakBench... | Rana Muhammad Shahroz, Zhen Tan, Sukwon Yun, Charles Fleming, Tianlong Chen |  |

Although LLM-based evaluation methods exhibit robust performance, the inherent stochastic nature of the LLM generation process introduces a degree of uncertainty in alignment with human preferences. To address this limitation, we propose Semantic-Eval, the first training-free framework designed to assess LLM-generated text based on semantic understanding. This framework computes semantic similarity between pairwise texts to evaluate the interdependence of semantic units, integrating a graph-based weighting mechanism to account for the differential contributions of individual sentences. A pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) model is also incorporated to mitigate potential semantic relationship biases. We evaluate Semantic-Eval across eight datasets that encompass four common NLP tasks. The experimental results indicate that... | Shusheng Li, Jiale Li, Yifei Qu, Xinwei Shi, Yanliang Guo, Ziyi He, Yubo Wang, Wenjun Tan |  |

Which features of the formal language impart an inductive bias that leads to effective transfer? Drawing on insights from linguistics and complexity theory, we hypothesize that effective transfer occurs when two conditions are met: the formal language should capture the dependency structures present in natural language, and it should remain within the computational limitations of the model architecture. We experiment with pre-pretraining (training on formal language before natural languages) on transformers and find that formal languages capturing hierarchical dependencies indeed enable language models to achieve lower loss on natural language and better linguistic generalization compared to other formal languages. We also find modest support for the hypothesis that the formal language should fall within the computational limitations of the architecture. Strikingly, pre-pretraining... | Michael Y.

While substantial efforts have been made to enhance the utilization of both forms of knowledge, situations in which models lack relevant information remain underexplored. To investigate this challenge, we first present a controlled testbed featuring four distinct knowledge access scenarios, including the aforementioned edge case, revealing that conventional LLM usage exhibits insufficient robustness in handling all instances. Addressing this limitation, we propose Contrastive Decoding with Abstention (CDA), a novel training-free decoding method that allows LLMs to generate responses when relevant knowledge is available and to abstain otherwise. CDA estimates the relevance of both knowledge sources for a given input, adaptively deciding which type of information to prioritize and which to exclude.

However, the rise of large language models (LLMs) brings potential risks of evidence pollution to confuse detectors. This paper explores potential manipulation scenarios including basic pollution, and rephrasing or generating evidence by LLMs. To mitigate the negative impact, we propose three defense strategies from the data and model sides, including machine-generated text detection, a mixture of experts, and parameter updating. Extensive experiments on four malicious social text detection tasks with ten datasets illustrate that evidence pollution significantly compromises detectors, where the generating strategy causes up to a 14.4% performance drop. Meanwhile, the defense strategies could mitigate evidence pollution, but they faced limitations for practical employment. Further analysis illustrates that polluted evidence (i) is of high quality, evaluated by metrics and humans; (ii) would... | Herun Wan, Minnan Luo, Zhixiong Su, Guang Dai, Xiang Zhao |  |

In social science, this theory is typically studied based on simple simulation experiments or real-world human studies, both of which either lack realism or are too expensive to control. In artificial intelligence, recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities in simulating human behaviors. Inspired by these insights, we adopt an interdisciplinary research perspective and propose using LLM-based agents to study Homans’ SET. Specifically, we construct a virtual society composed of three LLM agents and have them engage in a social exchange game to observe their behaviors. Through extensive experiments, we found that Homans’ SET is well validated in our agent society, demonstrating the consistency between the agent and human behaviors. Building on this foundation, we intentionally... | Lei Wang, Zheqing Zhang, Xu Chen |  |

Various strategies have been developed to enhance the end-to-end inference speed for LLMs, one of which is speculative decoding. This technique involves running a smaller LLM (draft model) for inference over a defined window size, denoted as 𝛾, while simultaneously being validated by the larger LLM (target model). Choosing the optimal 𝛾 value and the draft model is essential for unlocking the potential of speculative decoding. But it is difficult to do due to the complicated influence from various factors, including the nature of the task, the hardware in use, and the combination of the large and small models. This paper introduces \*on-the-fly adaption of speculative decoding\*, a solution that dynamically adapts the choices to maximize the efficiency of speculative decoding for LLM inferences.

However, computational psycholinguistic research has also established that syntactic structures provide compelling explanations for human sentence processing that token-level factors cannot fully account for. In this paper, we investigate whether the attention mechanism of Transformer Grammar (TG), which uniquely operates on syntactic structures as representational units, can serve as a cognitive model of human memory retrieval, using Normalized Attention Entropy (NAE) as a linking hypothesis between models and humans. Our experiments demonstrate that TG’s attention achieves superior predictive power for self-paced reading times compared to vanilla Transformer’s, with further analyses revealing independent contributions from both models. These findings suggest... | Ryo Yoshida, Shinnosuke Isono, Kohei Kajikawa, Taiga Someya, Yushi Sugimoto, Yohei Oseki |  |

However, people with diversified backgrounds have different cognition even in the same situation. Consequently, they may have personalized expectations for VLM assistants. This highlights the urgent need to align VLM assistants with personalized situated cognition for real-world assistance. To study this problem, we first simplify it by characterizing individuals based on the sociological concept of Role-Set. Then, we propose to evaluate the individuals’ actions to examine whether the personalized alignment is achieved. Further, we construct a benchmark named PCogAlignBench, which includes 18k instances and 20 individuals with different Role-Sets. Finally, we present a framework called PCogAlign, which constructs a cognition-aware and action-based reward model for personalized alignment.

The most commonly used method of context modeling is full self-attention, as seen in standard decoder-only Transformers. Although powerful, this method can be inefficient for long sequences and may overlook inherent input structures. To address these problems, an alternative approach is parallel context encoding, which splits the context into sub-pieces and encodes them parallelly. Because parallel patterns are not encountered during training, naively applying parallel encoding leads to performance degradation. However, the underlying reasons and potential mitigations are unclear. In this work, we provide a detailed analysis of this issue and identify that unusually high attention entropy can be a key factor. Furthermore, we adopt two straightforward methods to reduce attention entropy by incorporating attention sinks and selective... | Zhisong Zhang, Yan Wang, Xinting Huang, Tianqing Fang, Hongming Zhang, Chenlong Deng, Shuaiyi Li, Dong Yu |  |

A well-designed draft model and an effective draft candidate tree construction method are key to enhancing the acceleration effect of SD. In this paper, we first propose the Effective Draft Decoder (EDD), which treats the LLM as a powerful encoder and generates more accurate draft tokens by leveraging the encoding results as soft prompts. Furthermore, we use KL divergence instead of the standard cross-entropy loss to better align the draft model’s output with the LLM. Next, we introduce the Pruned Candidate Tree (PCT) algorithm to construct a more efficient candidate tree. Specifically, we found that the confidence scores predicted by the draft model are well-calibrated with the acceptance probability of draft tokens. Therefore, PCT estimates the expected time gain for each node in the candidate tree based on confidence scores and retains only the nodes that contribute... | Huanran Zheng, Xiaoling Wang |  |

However, annotating such fine-grained labels and training domain-specific models is costly. Existing works typically train a unified model across multiple domains, but such approaches lack adaptation and scalability since not all training data benefits target domains and scaling trained models remains challenging. We propose the SaM framework, which dynamically Selects and Merges expert models at inference time. Specifically, for a target domain, we select domain-specific experts pre-trained on existing domains based on (i) domain similarity to the target domain and (ii) performance on sampled instances, respectively. The experts are then merged to create task-specific models optimized for the target domain. By dynamically merging experts beneficial to target domains, we improve generalization across various domains without... | Zhuojun Ding, Wei Wei, Chenghao Fan |  |

A major challenge in student simulation is modeling the diverse learning patterns of students at various cognitive levels. However, current LLMs, typically trained as “helpful assistants”, target at generating perfect responses. As a result, they struggle to simulate students with diverse cognitive abilities, as they often produce overly advanced answers, missing the natural imperfections that characterize student learning and resulting in unrealistic simulations. To address this issue, we propose a training-free framework for student simulation. We begin by constructing a cognitive prototype for each student using a knowledge graph, which captures their understanding of concepts from past learning records. This prototype is then mapped to new tasks to predict student performance. Next, we simulate student solutions based on these predictions and... | Tao Wu, Jingyuan Chen, Wang Lin, Mengze Li, Yumeng Zhu, Ang Li, Kun Kuang, Fei Wu |  |

In practical design workflows, designers often engage in time-consuming reviews and refinements of these prototypes by comparing them with reference images. To bridge this gap, we introduce the CAD review task to automatically detect and correct potential errors, ensuring consistency between the constructed 3D objects and reference images. However, recent advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle to recognize multiple geometric components and perform spatial geometric operations within the CAD program, leading to inaccurate reviews. In this paper, we propose the CAD program repairer (ReCAD) framework to effectively detect program errors and provide helpful feedback on error correction. Additionally, we create a dataset, CADReview, consisting of over 20K program-image pairs, with diverse errors for the CAD review task.

This challenge has spurred efforts in attributed text generation, which prompts LLMs to generate content with supporting evidence. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, called Think&Cite, and formulate attributed text generation as a multi-step reasoning problem integrated with search. Specifically, we propose Self-Guided Monte Carlo Tree Search (SG-MCTS), which capitalizes on the self-reflection capability of LLMs to reason about the intermediate states of MCTS for guiding the tree expansion process. To provide reliable and comprehensive feedback, we introduce Progress Reward Modeling to measure the progress of tree search from the root to the current state from two aspects, i.e., generation and attribution progress. We conduct extensive experiments on three datasets and the results show that our approach significantly outperforms... | Junyi Li, Hwee Tou Ng |  |

This study evaluates six leading LLMs—GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Mistral, and LLaMA 2—on rationality, stability, and ethical fairness through reasoning tests, legal challenges, and bias-sensitive scenarios. Results reveal significant inconsistencies, highlighting trade-offs between model scale, architecture, and logical coherence.

KoGEM consists of 1.5k multiple-choice QA pairs covering five main categories and 16 subcategories. The zero-shot evaluation of 27 LLMs of various sizes and types reveals that while LLMs perform remarkably well on straightforward tasks requiring primarily definitional knowledge, they struggle with tasks that demand the integration of real-world experiential knowledge, such as phonological rules and pronunciation. Furthermore, our in-depth analysis suggests that incorporating such experiential knowledge could enhance the linguistic competence of LLMs. With KoGEM, we not only highlight the limitations of current LLMs in linguistic competence but also uncover hidden facets of LLMs in linguistic competence, paving the way for enhancing comprehensive language understanding.

However, many existing speech deepfake datasets are limited in scale and diversity, making it challenging to train models that can generalize well to unseen deepfakes. To address these gaps, we introduce SpeechFake, a large-scale dataset designed specifically for speech deepfake detection. SpeechFake includes over 3 million deepfake samples, totaling more than 3,000 hours of audio, generated using 40 different speech synthesis tools. The dataset encompasses a wide range of generation techniques, including text-to-speech, voice conversion, and neural vocoder, incorporating the latest cutting-edge methods.

Previous work has proposed numerous methods to enhance code generation performance, including integrating feedback from the compiler. Inspired by this, we present ReflectionCoder, a novel approach that effectively leverages reflection sequences constructed by integrating compiler feedback to improve one-off code generation performance. Furthermore, we propose reflection self-distillation and dynamically masked distillation to effectively utilize these reflection sequences. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks, i.e., HumanEval (+), MBPP (+), and MultiPl-E, demonstrate that models fine-tuned with our method achieve state-of-the-art performance. Beyond the code domain, we believe this approach can benefit other domains that focus on final results and require long reasoning paths.

While SFT can bridge the gap between LLM outputs and human behavioral patterns, its reliance on massive authentic data imposes substantial collection costs and privacy risks. We propose \*\*InvestAlign\*\*, a novel framework that constructs high-quality SFT datasets by leveraging theoretical solutions to similar and simple optimal investment problems rather than the complex scenarios. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that training LLMs with \*\*InvestAlign\*\*-generated data achieves faster parameter convergence than using real-user data, suggesting superior learning efficiency.

In scenarios where bilingual data is limited, this issue is further exacerbated. To address this, we propose kNN-LM-NMT, a method that leverages semantically similar target language sentences in the kNN framework. Our approach generates a probability distribution over these sentences during decoding, and this distribution is then interpolated with the NMT model’s distribution. Additionally, we introduce an n-gram-based approach to focus on similar fragments, enabling the model to avoid the noise introduced by the non-similar parts. To enhance accuracy, we further incorporate cross-lingual retrieval similarity to refine the kNN probability distribution. Extensive experiments on multi-domain datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements in both high-resource and low-resource scenarios.

The key challenge of GR lies in creating effective yet discrete DocIDs that preserve semantic relevance for similar documents while differentiating dissimilar ones. However, existing methods generate DocIDs solely based on the textual content of documents, which may result in DocIDs with weak semantic connections for similar documents due to variations in expression. Therefore, we propose using queries as a bridge to connect documents with varying relevance levels for learning improved DocIDs. In this paper, we propose \*\*M\*\*ulti-l\*\*E\*\*vel \*\*R\*\*elevance document identifier learning for \*\*G\*\*enerative r\*\*E\*\*trieval (MERGE), a novel approach that utilizes multi-level document relevance to learn high-quality DocIDs.

However, they face challenges in managing their significant memory requirements. Although quantization-aware training (QAT) offers a solution by reducing memory consumption through low-bit representations with minimal accuracy loss, it is impractical due to substantial training resources. To address this, we propose Efficient Quantization-Aware Training (EfficientQAT), a more feasible QAT algorithm. EfficientQAT involves two consecutive phases: Block-wise training of all parameters (Block-AP) and end-to-end training of quantization parameters (E2E-QP). To the best of our knowledge, Block-AP is the first method to enable direct training of all parameters in a block-wise manner, reducing accuracy loss in low-bit scenarios by enhancing the solution space during optimization. E2E-QP then trains only the quantization parameters (step sizes) end-to-end, further improving the... | Mengzhao Chen, Wenqi Shao, Peng Xu, Jiahao Wang, Peng Gao, Kaipeng Zhang, Ping Luo |  |

One natural hypothesis is that the CLIP vision encoder does not embed essential information for these tasks. However, we find that this is not always the case: The encoder gathers query-relevant visual information, while CLIP fails to extract it. In particular, we show that another branch of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Generative Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), achieve significantly higher accuracy than CLIP in many of these tasks using the \*same\* vision encoder and weights, indicating that these Generative MLLMs \*perceive more\*—as they extract and utilize visual information more effectively.

However, their performance on videos involving human actions is still limited by the lack of high-quality data. To address this, we introduce a two-stage data annotation pipeline. First, we design strategies to accumulate videos featuring clear human actions from the Internet. Second, videos are annotated in a standardized caption format that uses human attributes to distinguish individuals and chronologically details their actions and interactions. Through this pipeline, we curate two datasets, namely HAICTrain and HAICBench. \*\*HAICTrain\*\* comprises 126K video-caption pairs generated by Gemini-Pro and verified for training purposes.

However, prior research indicates that many of the weights in these matrices are redundant, leading to inefficiencies in parameter utilization. To address this limitation, we introduce Dense Low-Rank Adaptation (DenseLoRA), a novel approach that enhances parameter efficiency while achieving superior performance compared to LoRA. DenseLoRA builds upon the concept of representation fine-tuning, incorporating a single Encoder-Decoder to refine and compress hidden representations across all adaptation layers before applying adaptation. Instead of relying on two redundant low-rank matrices as in LoRA, DenseLoRA adapts LLMs through a dense low-rank matrix, improving parameter utilization and adaptation efficiency. We evaluate DenseLoRA on various benchmarks, showing that it achieves 83.8%... | Lin Mu, Xiaoyu Wang, Li Ni, Yang Li, Zhize Wu, Peiquan Jin, Yiwen Zhang |  |

Despite the growing interest in the development of personalized assistants, the lack of an open-source conversational dataset tailored for personalization remains a significant obstacle for researchers in the field. To address this research gap, we introduce HiCUPID, a new benchmark to probe and unleash the potential of LLMs to deliver personalized responses. Alongside a conversational dataset, HiCUPID provides a Llama-3.2-based automated evaluation model whose assessment closely mirrors human preferences. We release our dataset, evaluation model, and code at https://github.com/12kimih/HiCUPID. | Jisoo Mok, Ikhwan Kim, Sangkwon Park, Sungroh Yoon |  |

This paper further explores \*\*Degenerate Knowledge Neurons\*\* (DKNs), where distinct sets of neurons can store identical facts, but unlike simple redundancy, they also participate in storing other different facts. Despite the novelty and unique properties of this concept, it has not been rigorously defined and systematically studied. Our contributions are: (1) We pioneer the study of structures in knowledge neurons by analyzing weight connection patterns, providing a comprehensive definition of DKNs from both functional and structural aspects. (2) Based on this definition, we develop the \*\*Neuronal Topology Clustering\*\* method, leading to a more accurate DKN identification.

They tend to over-rely on external knowledge, making them vulnerable to misleading and unhelpful contexts. To address this, we propose the concept of context-robust LLMs, which can effectively balance internal knowledge with external context, similar to human cognitive processes. Specifically, context-robust LLMs should rely on external context only when lacking internal knowledge, identify contradictions between internal and external knowledge, and disregard unhelpful contexts. To achieve this goal, we introduce Grft, a lightweight and plug-and-play gated representation fine-tuning approach. Grft consists of two key components: a gating mechanism to detect and filter problematic inputs, and low-rank representation adapters to adjust hidden representations. By training a lightweight intervention function with only... | Shenglai Zeng, Pengfei He, Kai Guo, Tianqi Zheng, Hanqing Lu, Yue Xing, Hui Liu |  |

This paper investigates data-centric interpretability in language models, focusing on the next-word prediction task. Using representer theorem, we identify two types of support samples—those that either promote or deter specific predictions. Our findings reveal that being a support sample is an intrinsic property, predictable even before training begins. Additionally, while non-support samples are less influential in direct predictions, they play a critical role in preventing overfitting and shaping generalization and representation learning. Notably, the importance of non-support samples increases in deeper layers, suggesting their significant role in intermediate representation formation.These insights shed light on the interplay between data and model decisions, offering a new dimension to understanding language model behavior and... | Yuqian Li, Yupei Du, Yufang Liu, Feifei Feng, Mou Xiao Feng, Yuanbin Wu |  |

However, traditional search engines may retrieve shallow content, limiting the ability of LLMs to handle complex, multi-layered information. To address this, we introduce WebWalkerQA, a benchmark designed to assess the ability of LLMs to perform web traversal. It evaluates the capacity of LLMs to traverse a website’s subpages to extract high-quality data systematically. We propose WebWalker, which is a multi-agent framework that mimics human-like web navigation through an explore-critic paradigm. Extensive experimental results show that WebWalkerQA is challenging and demonstrates the effectiveness of RAG combined with WebWalker, through this horizontal and vertical integration in real-world scenarios. | Jialong Wu, Wenbiao Yin, Yong Jiang, Zhenglin Wang, Zekun Xi, Runnan Fang, Linhai Zhang, Yulan He, Deyu Zhou, Pengjun Xie, Fei Huang |  |

Mainstream watermarking schemes for LLMs fall into two categories: logits-based and sampling-based. However, current schemes entail trade-offs among robustness, text quality, and security. To mitigate this, we integrate logits-based and sampling-based schemes, harnessing their respective strengths to achieve synergy. In this paper, we propose a versatile symbiotic watermarking framework with three strategies: serial, parallel, and hybrid. The hybrid framework adaptively embeds watermarks using token entropy and semantic entropy, optimizing the balance between detectability, robustness, text quality, and security. Furthermore, we validate our approach through comprehensive experiments on various datasets and models. Experimental results indicate that our method outperforms existing baselines and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.... | Yidan Wang, Yubing Ren, Yanan Cao, Binxing Fang |  |

To improve annotation quality, we propose LLM-aided rejection and verification, eliminating invalid annotations without human labor.We construct a high-quality AutoGUI-704k dataset using the proposed pipeline, featuring diverse and detailed functionality annotations that are hardly provided by previous datasets.Human evaluation shows that we achieve annotation... | Hongxin Li, Jingfan Chen, Jingran Su, Yuntao Chen, Qing Li, Zhaoxiang Zhang |  |

Prior work has demonstrated that pretrained language models (PLMs) can effectively mine lexical relations between word pairs. However, they overlook the potential of graph structures composed of lexical relations, which can be integrated with the semantic knowledge of PLMs. In this work, we propose a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method through graph context, which integrates graph features and semantic representations for lexical relation classification (LRC) and lexical entailment (LE) tasks. Our experiments show that graph features can help PLMs better understand more complex lexical relations, establishing a new state-of-the-art for LRC and LE. Finally, we perform an error analysis, identifying the bottlenecks of language models in lexical relation mining tasks and providing insights for future improvements. | Jingwen Sun, Zhiyi Tian, Yu He, Jingwei Sun, Guangzhong Sun |  |

However, their reliance on external data raises critical concerns about unauthorized collection and usage of personal information. To ensure compliance with data protection regulations like GDPR and detect improper use of data, we propose the Shadow RAG Auditing Data Provenance (S-RAG) framework. S-RAG enables users to determine whether their textual data has been utilized in RAG systems, even in black-box settings with no prior system knowledge. It is effective across open-source and closed-source RAG systems and resilient to defense strategies. Experiments demonstrate that S-RAG achieves an improvement in Accuracy by 19.9% (compared to the best baseline), while maintaining strong performance under adversarial defenses. Furthermore, we analyze how the auditor’s knowledge of the target system... | Zhirui Zeng, Jiamou Liu, MengFen Chiang, Jialing He, Zijian Zhang |  |

Compared with traditional automatic and manual evaluation, LLM evaluators exhibit better interpretability and efficiency. Despite this, existing LLM evaluators suffer from limited use scenarios and poor flexibility. To mitigate these issues, we propose Praetor, a fine-grained generative LLM evaluator with instance-level customazable evaluation criteria. To train Praetor, we curate a large-scale dataset guided with a hierarchical guideline covering a wide range of tasks and instance-level evaluation criteria. We train Praetor on this dataset in a multi-task learning fashion, which enables to evaluate LLMs in either pointwise grading or pairwise comparison way and support two languages simultaneously with a high flexibility of setting evaluation criteria. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Praetor outperforms previous LLM evaluators and instruction-tuned LLMs on... | Yongqi Leng, Renren Jin, Yue Chen, Zhuowen Han, Ling Shi, Jianxiang Peng, Lei Yang, Juesi Xiao, Deyi Xiong |  |

While pre-trained neural language models (LMs) fine-tuned on AD transcripts perform well, little research has explored the effects of the gender of the speakers represented by these transcripts. This work addresses gender confounding in dementia detection and proposes two methods: the Extended Confounding Filter and the Dual Filter, which isolate and ablate weights associated with gender. We evaluate these methods on dementia datasets with first-person narratives from patients with cognitive impairment and healthy controls. Our results show transformer models tend to overfit to training data distributions. Disrupting gender-related weights results in a deconfounded dementia classifier, with the trade-off of slightly reduced dementia detection performance. | Zhecheng Sheng, Xiruo Ding, Brian Hur, Changye Li, Trevor Cohen, Serguei V.

To bridge this gap, we propose MCS-Bench, the first-of-its-kind multimodal benchmark specifically designed for CCS across multiple subdomains. MCS-Bench spans seven core subdomains (Ancient Chinese Text, Calligraphy, Painting, Oracle Bone Script, Seal, Cultural Relic, and Illustration), with a total of 45 meticulously designed tasks. Through extensive evaluation of 37 representative MLLMs, we observe that even the top-performing model (InternVL2.5-78B) achieves an average score below 50, indicating substantial room for improvement. Our analysis reveals significant performance variations across different tasks and identifies critical challenges in areas such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and... | Yang Liu, Jiahuan Cao, Hiuyi Cheng, Yongxin Shi, Kai Ding, Lianwen Jin |  |

Previous studies primarily utilize MLP neurons as units of analysis; however, neurons suffer from polysemanticity, leading to limited knowledge expression and poor interpretability. We first conduct preliminary experiments to validate that SAE can effectively decompose neurons into features. With this established, our core findings reveal three key advantages of features over neurons: (1) Features exhibit stronger influence on knowledge expression and superior interpretability. (2) Features demonstrate enhanced monosemanticity, showing distinct activation patterns between related and unrelated facts. (3) Feature-based method demonstrates superior performance over neuron-based approaches in erasing privacy-sensitive information from LMs. Additionally, we propose FeatureEdit, the first feature-based editing method.

While there are methods capable of generating synthetic instructions at scale, they either suffer from limited grounding sources, leading to a narrow distribution, or rely on trivial extensions that fail to produce meaningful trajectories in terms of complexity. In contrast, instructions that benefit efficient alignment are typically crafted with cognitive insights and grounded in real-world use cases. In this paper, we synthesize such instructions using attributed grounding, which involves 1) a top-down attribution process that grounds a selective set of real instructions to situated users, and 2) a bottom-up synthesis process that leverages web documents to first generate a situation, then a meaningful instruction. This framework allows us to harvest diverse and complex instructions at scale, utilizing the vast range of web documents. Specifically, we... | Chiwei Zhu, Benfeng Xu, Xiaorui Wang, Zhendong Mao |  |

However, their reliability and trustworthiness are still in doubt, especially for concerns regarding individuals’ data privacy. Great efforts have been made on privacy by building various evaluation benchmarks to study LLMs’ privacy awareness and robustness from their generated outputs to their hidden representations. Unfortunately, most of these works adopt a narrow formulation of privacy and only investigate personally identifiable information (PII). In this paper, we follow the merit of the Contextual Integrity (CI) theory, which posits that privacy evaluation should not only cover the transmitted attributes but also encompass the whole relevant social context through private information flows. We present PrivaCI-Bench, a comprehensive contextual privacy evaluation benchmark targeted at legal compliance to cover well-annotated privacy and safety... | Haoran Li, Wenbin Hu, Huihao Jing, Yulin Chen, Qi Hu, Sirui Han, Tianshu Chu, Peizhao Hu, Yangqiu Song |  |

Existing studies benchmark carbon emissions but lack a standardized basis for comparison across different model configurations. To address this, we introduce the concept of functional unit (FU) as a standardized basis and develop FUEL, the first FU-based framework for evaluating LLM serving’s environmental impact. Through three case studies, we uncover key insights and trade-offs in reducing carbon emissions by optimizing model size, quantization strategy, and hardware choice, paving the way for more sustainable LLM serving.

This not only allows the acquisition of experience without extensive costs of previous methods, but also offers a novel path for the generalization of LLMs.Experimental results on 13 datasets demonstrate that our framework effectively improves the performance of LLMs. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of each module in the framework. | Jinglong Gao, Xiao Ding, Lingxiao Zou, Bibo Cai, Bing Qin, Ting Liu |  |

One of the challenges of model fusion is high computational load, specifically in fine-tuning or aligning vocabularies. To address this, we propose Cool-Fusion, a simple yet effective approach that fuses the knowledge of source LLMs, which does not require training. Unlike ensemble methods, Cool-Fusion is applicable to any set of source LLMs that have different vocabularies. To overcome the vocabulary discrepancies among LLMs, we ensemble LLMs on text level, allowing them to rerank the generated texts by each other with different granularities. Extensive experiments have been conducted across a variety of benchmark datasets. On GSM8K, Cool-Fusion increases accuracy from three strong source LLMs by a significant margin of 17.4%. | Cong Liu, Xiaojun Quan, Yan Pan, Weigang Wu, Xu Chen, Liang Lin |  |

In general, the attention scores are determined simply by the key-query products. However, this work’s occasional trial (combining DAPE and NoPE) of including additional MLPs on attention scores without position encoding indicates that the classical key-query multiplication may limit the performance of Transformers. In this work, we conceptualize attention as a feature map and apply the convolution operator (for neighboring attention scores across different heads) to mimic the processing methods in computer vision. Specifically, \*\*the main contribution of this paper is identifying and interpreting the Transformer length extrapolation problem as a result of the limited expressiveness of the naive query and key dot product, and we successfully translate the length extrapolation issue into a well-understood feature map processing problem\*\*, which is called... | Chuanyang Zheng, Yihang Gao, Han Shi, Jing Xiong, Jiankai Sun, Jingyao Li, Minbin Huang, Xiaozhe Ren, Michael Ng, Xin Jiang, Zhenguo Li, Yu Li |  |

While existing methods have constructed data for complex instruction alignment, they all rely on a more advanced model, especially GPT-4, limiting their application. In this paper, we propose a Multi-granularity Self-Contrastive Training (MuSC) framework, to improve the complex instruction alignment without relying on a stronger model. Our method is conducted on both coarse and fine granularity. On coarse-granularity, we construct constraint-aware preference data based on instruction decomposition and recombination. On fine-granularity, we perform token-aware preference optimization with dynamic token-level supervision. Our method is evaluated on open-sourced models, and experiment results show our method achieves significant improvement on both complex and general instruction-following benchmarks, surpassing previous self-alignment methods. | Hui Huang, Jiaheng Liu, Yancheng He, Shilong Li, Bing Xu, Conghui Zhu, Muyun Yang, Tiejun Zhao |  |

However, this often leads to degraded performance on short-text tasks, while the reasons for this degradation remain insufficiently explored. In this work, we identify two primary factors contributing to this issue: distribution drift in hidden states and attention scores, and catastrophic forgetting during continual pre-training. To address these challenges, we propose Long Context Pre-training with Restoration Distillation (LongReD), a novel approach designed to mitigate short-text performance degradation through minimizing the distribution discrepancy between the extended and original models. Besides training on long texts, LongReD distills the hidden state of selected layers from the original model on short texts. Additionally, LongReD also introduces a short-to-long distillation, aligning the output distribution on short texts with that on... | Zican Dong, Junyi Li, Jinhao Jiang, Mingyu Xu, Xin Zhao, Bingning Wang, Weipeng Chen |  |

Current approaches, including sequence parallelism strategies and compute reduction through approximate attention mechanisms, still fall short of delivering optimal inference efficiency. This hinders scaling the inputs to longer sequences and processing long-context queries in a timely manner. To address this, we introduce APB, an efficient long-context inference framework that leverages multi-host approximate attention to enhance prefill speed by reducing compute and enhancing parallelism simultaneously. APB introduces a communication mechanism for essential key-value pairs within a sequence parallelism framework, enabling a faster inference speed while maintaining task performance. We implement APB by incorporating a tailored FlashAttn kernel alongside optimized distribution strategies, supporting diverse models and parallelism... | Yuxiang Huang, Mingye Li, Xu Han, Chaojun Xiao, Weilin Zhao, Sun Ao, Hao Zhou, Jie Zhou, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun |  |

However, minor language news recommendation platforms suffer from limited interactions due to a small user base. A natural solution is to apply well-established English recommender systems to minor language news recommendation, but the linguistic gap can lead to inaccurate modeling of minor language news content. Therefore, enabling few-shot minor language news recommender systems to capture both content information and preference patterns remains a challenge. Based on the observation that preference patterns are similar across languages, we propose a minor language news recommendation model by cross-lingual preference pattern transfer, named PPT. Our model adopts the widely used two-tower architecture and employs the large language model as the backbone of the news encoder. Through cross-lingual alignment, the strong English capability of the news encoder is... | Yiyang Zhang, Nan Chen |  |

However, the current study points out that there is a preference gap between retrievers and LLMs in the RAG framework, which limit the further improvement of system performance. Some highly relevant passages may interfere with LLM reasoning because they contain complex or contradictory information; while some indirectly related or even inaccurate content may help LLM generate more accurate answers by providing suggestive information or logical clues. To solve this, we propose \*\*GainRAG\*\*, a novel approach that aligns the retriever’s and LLM’s preferences by defining a new metric, “gain’’, which measure how well an input passage contributes to correct outputs.We then propose a method to estimate these gain signals and train a middleware that... | Yi Jiang, Sendong Zhao, Jianbo Li, Haochun Wang, Bing Qin |  |

This limitation stems from their reliance on probability-based metrics that are inherently sensitive to temperature scaling. Through empirical and theoretical analysis, we make two key discoveries: (1) the pre-softmax logits exhibit a clear statistical separation between informative tokens and noise, and (2) we prove the mathematical equivalence of min-p and top-(1-p) under uniform distribution over logits. These findings motivate the design of top-n𝜎, a novel sampling method that identifies informative tokens by eliminating noise directly in logit space.Unlike existing methods that become unstable at high temperatures, top-n𝜎 achieves temperature-invariant token selection while... | Chenxia Tang, Jianchun Liu, Hongli Xu, Liusheng Huang |  |

Despite the numerous efforts in this area, the optimization for the decoding phase is generally ignored. However, we believe such optimization is crucial, especially for long-output generation tasks based on the following two observations: (i) Excessive compression during the prefill phase, which requires specific full context impairs the comprehension of the reasoning task; (ii) Deviation of heavy hitters occurs in the reasoning tasks with long outputs. Therefore, SCOPE, a simple yet efficient framework that separately performs KV cache optimization during the prefill and decoding phases, is introduced. Specifically, the KV cache during the prefill phase is preserved to maintain the essential information, while a novel strategy based on sliding is proposed to select essential heavy hitters for the decoding phase. Memory usage and memory transfer are further optimized using adaptive and discontinuous... | Jialong Wu, Zhenglin Wang, Linhai Zhang, Yilong Lai, Yulan He, Deyu Zhou |  |

In our work, we propose Minion to address these challenges. Firstly, we leverage the General Orthogonal Frame (GOF) structure, based on the concept of Neural Collapse, to create robust class prototypes with clear separation, even between analogous classes. Secondly, we utilize label description representations as global class representatives within the fast-slow contrastive learning paradigm. These representations consistently encapsulate the essential attributes of each relation, acting as global information that helps mitigate overfitting and reduces representation bias caused by the limited local few-shot examples within a class. Extensive experiments on well-known FCRE benchmarks show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art... | Thanh Duc Pham, Nam Le Hai, Linh Ngo Van, Nguyen Thi Ngoc Diep, Sang Dinh, Thien Huu Nguyen |  |

Existing approaches, such as quantization, have demonstrated promising results in reducing memory usage. However, current quantization methods cannot take both effectiveness and efficiency into account. In this paper, we propose MoQAE, a novel mixed-precision quantization method via mixture of quantization-aware experts. First, we view different quantization bit-width configurations as experts and use the traditional mixture of experts (MoE) method to select the optimal configuration. To avoid the inefficiency caused by inputting tokens one by one into the router in the traditional MoE method, we input the tokens into the router chunk by chunk. Second, we design a lightweight router-only fine-tuning process to train MoQAE with a comprehensive loss to learn the trade-off between model accuracy and memory usage.

Existing privacy protection methods for LLMs suffer from either insufficient privacy protection with performance degradation, or large inference time overhead. To address these limitations, we propose PrivacyRestore, a plug-and-play method to protect the privacy of user inputs during LLM inference for the client-server scenario. The server first trains restoration vectors for each privacy span type offline and then releases them to the clients. During inference, the client aggregates restoration vectors of all privacy spans in the user query into a meta restoration vector, which is later sent to the server to restore information. Before transmission, the client removes all privacy spans in the user query and applies d𝜒-privacy mechanism to the meta vector for privacy protection.

Current data selection methods, such as natural language quality assessments, diversity-based filters, and classifier-based approaches, are limited by single-dimensional evaluation or redundancy-focused strategies. To address these gaps, we propose four dimensions to evaluate data quality: professionalism, readability, reasoning, and cleanliness. We further introduce Meta-rater, a multi-dimensional data selection method that integrates these dimensions with existing quality metrics through learned optimal weightings. Meta-rater employs proxy models to train a regression model that predicts validation loss, enabling the identification of optimal combinations of quality scores.

A Self-Adaptive Framework for Evaluating LLMs in Domain-Specific Knowledge and Reasoning](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.534/) |  | 0 | The evaluation of large language models (LLMs) has traditionally relied on static benchmarks, a paradigm that poses two major limitations: (1) predefined test sets lack adaptability to diverse application domains, and (2) standardized evaluation protocols often fail to capture fine-grained assessments of domain-specific knowledge and contextual reasoning abilities. To overcome these challenges, we propose GuessArena, an adaptive evaluation framework grounded in adversarial game-based interactions. Inspired by the interactive structure of the Guess Who I Am? game, our framework seamlessly integrates dynamic domain knowledge modeling with progressive reasoning assessment to improve evaluation fidelity. Empirical studies across five vertical domains-finance, healthcare, manufacturing, information technology, and education-demonstrate that GuessArena effectively distinguishes LLMs in terms of domain knowledge coverage and reasoning chain completeness. Compared to conventional benchmarks,... | Qingchen Yu, Zifan Zheng, Ding Chen, Simin Niu, Bo Tang, Feiyu Xiong, Zhiyu Li |  |

Yet, reliable evaluation of LLMs is challenging due to the inaccuracy of standard metrics in human perception of text quality and the inefficiency in sampling informative test examples for human evaluation. This paper presents a sample-efficient human evaluation method for LLMs based on the principle of MAximum Discrepancy (MAD) competition. MAD automatically selects a small set of informative input instructions, each of which maximizes the discrepancy of two LLMs’ reponses, which are subsequently subject to three-alternative forced choice by human subjects. The pairwise comparison results of multiple LLMs are then aggregated into a global ranking using the Elo rating system. We compare eight representative LLMs in terms of four skills: knowledge understanding, mathematical reasoning, writing, and coding. Experimental results show that the proposed method reliably achieves the “golden” ranking of LLMs with... | Kehua Feng, Keyan Ding, Hongzhi Tan, Kede Ma, Zhihua Wang, Shuangquan Guo, Yuzhou Cheng, Ge Sun, Guozhou Zheng, Qiang Zhang, Huajun Chen |  |

Recursive summarization constructs a hierarchical summary tree by clustering text chunks, integrating information from multiple parts of a document to provide evidence for abstractive questions involving multi-step reasoning. However, summary trees often contain a large number of redundant summary nodes, which not only increase construction time but may also negatively impact question answering. Moreover, recursive summarization is not suitable for all types of questions. We introduce DTCRS, a method that dynamically generates summary trees based on document structure and query semantics. DTCRS determines whether a summary tree is necessary by analyzing the question type. It then decomposes the question and uses the embeddings of sub-questions as initial cluster centers, reducing redundant summaries while improving the relevance between... | Guanran Luo, Zhongquan Jian, Wentao Qiu, Meihong Wang, Qingqiang Wu |  |

However, existing CL-based TKGR methods still face two key limitations: (1) They usually one-sidedly reorganize individual historical facts, while overlooking the historical context essential for accurately understanding the historical semantics of these facts; (2) They preserve historical knowledge by simply replaying historical facts, while ignoring the potential conflicts between historical and emerging facts. In this paper, we propose a Deep Generative Adaptive Replay (DGAR) method, which can generate and adaptively replay historical entity distribution representations from the whole historical context. To address the first challenge, historical context prompts as sampling units are built to preserve the whole historical context information. To overcome the second... | Zhiyu Zhang, Wei Chen, Youfang Lin, Huaiyu Wan |  |

However, their application in open-ended, knowledge-intensive, complex reasoning scenarios is still limited. Reasoning-oriented methods struggle to generalize to open-ended scenarios due to implicit assumptions of complete world knowledge. Meanwhile, knowledge-augmented reasoning (KAR) methods fails to address two core challenges: 1) error propagation, where errors in early steps cascade through the chain, and 2) verification bottleneck, where the explore–exploit trade-off arises in multi-branch decision processes. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ARise, a novel framework that integrates risk assessment of intermediate reasoning states with dynamic retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) within a Monte Carlo tree search paradigm. This approach enables effective construction and optimization of reasoning... | Yize Zhang, Tianshu Wang, Sirui Chen, Kun Wang, Xingyu Zeng, Hongyu Lin, Xianpei Han, Le Sun, Chaochao Lu |  |

Accurately predicting the specific mechanisms underlying DDIs (named DDI events or DDIEs) is critical for the safe clinical use of drugs. DDIEs are typically represented as textual descriptions. However, most computational methods focus more on predicting the DDIE class label over generating human-readable natural language increasing clinicians’ interpretation costs. Furthermore, current methods overlook the fact that each drug assumes distinct biological functions in a DDI, which, when used as input context, can enhance the understanding of the DDIE process and benefit DDIE generation by the language model (LM). In this work, we propose a novel pairwise knowledge-augmented generative method (termed PKAG-DDI) for DDIE text generation. It consists of a pairwise knowledge selector efficiently injecting structural information between drugs bidirectionally and simultaneously to select pairwise... | Ziyan Wang, Zhankun Xiong, Feng Huang, Wen Zhang |  |

While large language models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning abilities, their clinical use is limited by high computational costs and restricted multimodal reasoning ability. Small language models (SLMs) are efficient but lack advanced reasoning for integrating multimodal medical data. In addition, both LLMs and SLMs lack domain knowledge for trustworthy reasoning. Therefore, we propose ClinRaGen, enhancing SLMs by leveraging LLM-derived reasoning ability via rationale distillation and domain knowledge injection for trustworthy multimodal rationale generation. Key innovations include a sequential rationale distillation framework that equips SLMs with LLM-comparable multimodal reasoning abilities, and a knowledge-augmented attention mechanism that jointly unifies multimodal representation from time series and textual data in the same encoding... | Shuai Niu, Jing Ma, Hongzhan Lin, Liang Bai, Zhihua Wang, Richard Yi Da Xu, Yunya Song, Xian Yang |  |

Consequently, many users seek pre-trained text encoders from model plugin-sharing platforms like Civitai and Hugging Face, which introduces an underexplored threat: the potential for adversaries to embed Trojans within these plugins. Existing Trojan attacks often require extensive training data and suffer from poor generalization across different triggers, limiting their effectiveness and scalability. To the best of our knowledge, this paper introduces the first \*\*T\*\*ext-encoder \*\*W\*\*eight-editing method for \*\*I\*\*nserting \*\*S\*\*ecret \*\*T\*\*rojans (\*\*TWIST\*\*).

Common preference alignment methods like DPO excel in static settings, but struggle in dynamic collaborative tasks where the explicit signals of interlocutor beliefs are sparse and skewed. We propose the Frictional Agent Alignment Framework (FAAF), to generate precise, context-aware “friction” that prompts for deliberation and re-examination of existing evidence. FAAF’s two-player objective decouples from data skew: a frictive-state policy identifies belief misalignments, while an intervention policy crafts collaborator-preferred responses. We derive an analytical solution to this objective, enabling training a single policy via a simple supervised loss. Experiments on three benchmarks show FAAF outperforms competitors in producing concise, interpretable friction and in OOD generalization. By aligning LLMs to act as adaptive “thought partners”—not passive responders—FAAF... | Abhijnan Nath, Carine Graff, Andrei Bachinin, Nikhil Krishnaswamy |  |

Powerformer incorporates three key techniques to optimize encrypted computations:1. A novel distillation technique that replaces softmax and layer normalization (LN) with computationally efficient power and linear functions, ensuring no performance degradation while enabling seamless encrypted computation.2. A pseudo-sign composite approximation method that accurately approximates GELU and tanh functions with minimal computational overhead.3. A homomorphic matrix multiplication algorithm specifically optimized for Transformer models, enhancing efficiency in encrypted environments.By integrating these techniques, Powerformer based on the BERT-base model achieves a 45% reduction in computation time compared to the state-of-the-art HE-based PPLM without any loss in accuracy. | Dongjin Park, Eunsang Lee, JoonWoo Lee |  |

Measuring and Mitigating AI Safety Risks in Role-Play Fine-Tuning of LLMs](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.544/) |  | 0 | Role-playing enables large language models (LLMs) to engage users in immersive and personalized interactions, but it also introduces significant safety risks. Existing role-play fine-tuning techniques improve role adaptability but may degrade safety performance, particularly for villainous characters. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive assessment of role-play fine-tuning risks by training 95 role-specific LLMs using RoleBench. Our experiments reveal that role-play fine-tuning leads to a noticeable decline in safety performance, with safety risks varying based on character traits. To tackle this challenge, we propose Safety-Aware Role-Play Fine-Tuning (SaRFT), a novel method designed to balance role-playing capabilities and safety. Extensive experiments on LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct, Gemma-2-9B-it, and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct demonstrate that SaRFT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under both LoRA and full-parameter fine-tuning settings.

In this work, to address these issues, we propose a multi-modal prompt learning paradigm to effectively adapt pre-trained GNN to downstream tasks and data, given only a few semantically labeled samples, each with extremely weak text supervision. Our new paradigm embeds the graphs directly in the same space as the Large Language Models (LLMs) by learning both graph prompts and text prompts simultaneously. We demonstrate the superior performance of our paradigm in few-shot, multi-task-level, and cross-domain settings. Moreover, we build the first CLIP-style zero-shot classification prototype that can generalize... | Zihao Li, Lecheng Zheng, Bowen Jin, Dongqi Fu, Baoyu Jing, Yikun Ban, Jingrui He, Jiawei Han |  |

This paper begins with understanding interactive drama from two aspects: Immersion—the player’s feeling of being present in the story—and Agency—the player’s ability to influence the story world. Both are crucial to creating an enjoyable interactive experience, while they have been underexplored in previous work. To enhance these two aspects, we first propose Playwriting-guided Generation, a novel method that helps LLMs craft dramatic stories with substantially improved structures and narrative quality. Additionally, we introduce Plot-based Reflection for LLM agents to refine their reactions to align with the player’s intentions. Our evaluation relies on human judgment to assess the gains of our methods in terms of immersion and agency. | Hongqiu Wu, Weiqi Wu, Tianyang Xu, Jiameng Zhang, Hai Zhao |  |

Phrase grounding between images and their captions is a well-established task. In contrast, for real-world applications, it is essential to integrate textual and multimodal reference resolution to unravel the reference relations within dialogue, especially in handling ambiguities caused by pronouns and ellipses. This paper presents a framework that unifies textual and multimodal reference resolution by mapping mention embeddings to object embeddings and selecting mentions or objects based on their similarity. Our experiments show that learning textual reference resolution, such as coreference resolution and predicate-argument structure analysis, positively affects performance in multimodal reference resolution. In particular, our model with coreference resolution performs better in pronoun phrase grounding than representative models for this... | Shun Inadumi, Nobuhiro Ueda, Koichiro Yoshino |  |

Recent works have built upon retrieved-augmented generation to improve factuality through iterative prompting but these methods are limited by the traditional RAG design. To address these challenges, we introduce Ewe (Explicit Working Memory), a novel approach that enhances factuality in long-form text generation by integrating a working memory that receives real-time feedback from external resources. The memory is refreshed based on online fact-checking and retrieval feedback, allowing Ewe to rectify false claims during the generation process and ensure more accurate and reliable outputs. Our experiments demonstrate that Ewe outperforms strong baselines on four fact-seeking long-form generation datasets, increasing the factuality metric, VeriScore, by 2 to 6 points absolute without sacrificing the helpfulness of the responses. Further analysis reveals that the design of rules for memory... | Mingda Chen, Yang Li, Karthik Padthe, Rulin Shao, Alicia Yi Sun, Luke Zettlemoyer, Gargi Ghosh, Wentau Yih |  |

However, effectively aligning LLMs with diverse human preferences remains a significant challenge, particularly when they are conflict. To address this issue, we frame human value alignment as a multi-objective optimization problem, aiming to maximize a set of potentially conflicting objectives. We introduce Gradient-Adaptive Policy Optimization (GAPO), a novel fine-tuning paradigm that employs multiple-gradient descent to align LLMs with diverse preference distributions. GAPO adaptively rescales the gradients for each objective to determine an update direction that optimally balances the trade-offs between objectives. Additionally, we introduce P-GAPO, which incorporates user preferences across different objectives and achieves Pareto solutions that better align with the user’s specific needs. | Chengao Li, Hanyu Zhang, Yunkun Xu, Hongyan Xue, Xiang Ao, Qing He |  |

However, recent methods focus on search accuracy while overlooking computational efficiency. The challenges of accelerating the ToT lie in the frequent switching of reasoning focus, and the redundant exploration of suboptimal solutions. To alleviate this dilemma, we propose Dynamic Parallel Tree Search (DPTS), a novel parallelism framework that aims to dynamically optimize the reasoning path in inference. It includes the Parallelism Streamline in the generation phase to build up a flexible and adaptive parallelism with arbitrary paths by cache management and alignment. Meanwhile, the Search and Transition Mechanism filters potential candidates to dynamically maintain the reasoning focus on more possible solutions with less redundancy. Experiments on Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3 on math and code datasets show that DPTS significantly improves efficiency by 2-4× on average... | Yifu Ding, Wentao Jiang, Shunyu Liu, Yongcheng Jing, Jinyang Guo, Yingjie Wang, Jing Zhang, Zengmao Wang, Ziwei Liu, Bo Du, Xianglong Liu, Dacheng Tao |  |

Existing methods primarily parse LR(1) grammars into a pushdown automaton (PDA), leading to runtime execution overhead for context-dependent token processing, especially inefficient under large inference batches.To address these issues, we propose Pre3 that exploits deterministic pushdown automata (DPDA) to optimize the constrained LLM decoding efficiency.First, by \*\*pre\*\*computing \*\*pre\*\*fix-conditioned edges during the \*\*pre\*\*processing, Pre3 enables ahead-of-time edge analysis and thus makes parallel transition processing possible.Futher, leveraging the prefix-conditioned edges, Pre3 introduces a novel approach that transforms LR(1) transition graphs into DPDA, eliminating the need for runtime path exploration and achieving edge transitions with minimal overhead.Pre3 can be seamlessly integrated into standard LLM... | Junyi Chen, Shihao Bai, Zaijun Wang, Siyu Wu, Chuheng Du, Hailong Yang, Ruihao Gong, Shengzhong Liu, Fan Wu, Guihai Chen |  |

Alignment, the process of fine-tuning LLMs to better align with desired behaviors, is recognized as an effective approach to mitigate gender biases. Although proprietary LLMs have made significant strides in mitigating gender bias, their alignment datasets are not publicly available. The commonly used and publicly available alignment dataset, HH-RLHF, still exhibits gender bias to some extent. There is a lack of publicly available alignment datasets specifically designed to address gender bias. Hence, we developed a new dataset named GenderAlign, aiming at mitigating a comprehensive set of gender biases in LLMs. This dataset comprises 8k single-turn dialogues, each paired with a “chosen” and a “rejected” response. Compared to the “rejected” responses, the “chosen” responses demonstrate lower levels of gender bias and higher quality.

While encoding proteins themselves is essential, PPI networks can also provide rich prior knowledge for these predictive tasks. However, existing methods oversimplify the problem of PPI prediction in a semi-supervised manner when utilizing PPI networks, limiting their practical application. Furthermore, how to effectively use the rich prior knowledge of PPI networks for novel proteins not present in the network remains an unexplored issue. Additionally, due to inflexible architectures, most of existing methods cannot handle complexes containing an flexible number of proteins. To overcome these limitations, we introduce LLaPA (Large Language and Protein Assistant), a multimodal large language model that integrates proteins and PPI networks. LLaPA offers a more rational approach to utilizing PPI networks for PPI... | Peng Zhou, Pengsen Ma, Jianmin Wang, Xibao Cai, Haitao Huang, Wei Liu, Longyue Wang, Lai Hou Tim, Xiangxiang Zeng |  |

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown strong multi-lingual abilities, giving them the potential to perform M2MS in real applications. This work presents a systematic empirical study on LLMs’ M2MS ability. Specifically, we first reorganize M2MS data based on eight previous domain-specific datasets. The reorganized data contains 47.8K samples spanning five domains and six languages, which could be used to train and evaluate LLMs. Then, we benchmark 18 LLMs in a zero-shot manner and an instruction-tuning manner. Fine-tuned traditional models (e.g., mBART) are also conducted for comparisons. Our experiments reveal that, zero-shot LLMs achieve competitive results with fine-tuned traditional models. After instruct-tuning, open-source LLMs can significantly improve their M2MS ability, and outperform zero-shot LLMs (including GPT-4) in terms of... | Jiaan Wang, Fandong Meng, Zengkui Sun, Yunlong Liang, Yuxuan Cao, Jiarong Xu, Haoxiang Shi, Jie Zhou |  |

In this regard, current studies mainly concentrate on leveraging various translation knowledge into ST models. However, these methods often struggle with interference from irrelevant noise and can not fully utilize the translation knowledge. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel Locate-and-Focus method for terminology translation. It first effectively locates the speech clips containing terminologies within the utterance to construct translation knowledge, minimizing irrelevant information for the ST model. Subsequently, it associates the translation knowledge with the utterance and hypothesis from both audio and textual modalities, allowing the ST model to better focus on translation knowledge during translation. Experimental results across various datasets demonstrate that our method effectively... | Suhang Wu, Jialong Tang, Chengyi Yang, Pei Zhang, Baosong Yang, Junhui Li, Junfeng Yao, Min Zhang, Jinsong Su |  |

Previous studies have made notable progress in benchmarking the instruction following capabilities of LLMs in general domains, with a primary focus on their inherent commonsense knowledge. Recently, LLMs have been increasingly deployed as domain-oriented agents, which rely on domain-oriented guidelines that may conflict with their commonsense knowledge. These guidelines exhibit two key characteristics: they consist of a wide range of domain-oriented rules and are subject to frequent updates. Despite these challenges, the absence of comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating the domain-oriented guideline following capabilities of LLMs presents a significant obstacle to their effective assessment and further development.

However, existing approaches to RAG fall short by neglecting system state variables, which are crucial for ensuring adaptive control, retrieval halting, and system convergence. In this paper, we introduce the Turing-Complete-RAG (TC-RAG) through rigorous proof, a novel framework that addresses these challenges by incorporating a Turing Complete System to manage state variables, thereby enabling more efficient and accurate knowledge retrieval. By leveraging a memory stack system with adaptive retrieval, reasoning, and planning capabilities, TC-RAG not only ensures the controlled halting of retrieval processes but also mitigates the accumulation of erroneous knowledge via Push and Pop actions.

However, due to the inherently lengthy nature of long-text data, existing LCU benchmarks for LLMs often result in prohibitively high evaluation costs, like testing time and inference expenses. Through extensive experimentation, we discover that existing LCU benchmarks exhibit significant redundancy, which means the inefficiency in evaluation. In this paper, we propose a concise data compression method tailored for long-text data with sparse information characteristics. By pruning the well-known LCU benchmark LongBench, we create MiniLongBench. This benchmark includes only 237 test samples across six major task categories and 21 distinct tasks. Through empirical analysis of over 60 LLMs, MiniLongBench achieves an average evaluation cost reduced to only 4.5% of the original while maintaining an average rank correlation coefficient of 0.97 with LongBench results.

To improve the robustness of such systems against noisy retrievals, Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning (RAFT) has emerged as a widely adopted method. However, RAFT conditions models to generate answers even in the absence of reliable knowledge. This behavior undermines their reliability in high-stakes domains, where acknowledging uncertainty is critical. To address this issue, we propose Divide-Then-Align (DTA), a post-training approach designed to endow RAG systems with the ability to respond with “I don’t know” when the query is out of the knowledge boundary of both the retrieved passages and the model’s internal knowledge. DTA divides data samples into four knowledge quadrants and constructs tailored preference data for each quadrant, resulting in a curated dataset... | Xin Sun, Jianan Xie, Zhongqi Chen, Qiang Liu, Shu Wu, Yuehe Chen, Bowen Song, Zilei Wang, Weiqiang Wang, Liang Wang |  |

To achieve intelligent exploit generation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark using Binary Exploitation (pwn) challenges in Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions and investigate the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in AEG based on the benchmark. To improve the performance of AEG, we propose PwnGPT, an LLM-based automatic exploit generation framework that automatically solves pwn challenges. The structural design of PwnGPT is divided into three main components: analysis, generation, and verification modules. With the help of a modular approach and structured problem inputs, PwnGPT can solve challenges that LLMs cannot directly solve. We evaluate PwnGPT on our benchmark and analyze the outputs of each module. Experimental... | Wanzong Peng, Lin Ye, Xuetao Du, Hongli Zhang, Dongyang Zhan, Yunting Zhang, Yicheng Guo, Chen Zhang |  |

To address this need for Vietnamese, we present the first Vietnamese Multitask Language Understanding (VMLU) Benchmarks. The VMLU benchmarks consist of four datasets that assess different capabilities of LLMs, including general knowledge, reading comprehension, reasoning, and conversational skills. This paper also provides an insightful overview of the current state of some dominant LLMs, such as Llama-3, Qwen2.5, and GPT-4, highlighting their performances and limitations when measured against these benchmarks. Furthermore, we provide insights into how prompt design can influence VMLU’s evaluation outcomes, as well as suggest that open-source LLMs can serve as effective, cost-efficient evaluators within the Vietnamese context. By offering a comprehensive and accessible benchmarking framework, the VMLU Benchmarks aim to foster the development... | Cuc Thi Bui, Nguyen Truong Son, Trang Van Truong, Viet Lam Phung, Pham Nhut Huy, Hoang Anh Le, Quoc Huu Van, Phong NguyenThuan Do, Van Le Tran Truc, Duc Thanh Chau, LeMinh Nguyen |  |

However, it suffers from quadratic computational complexity and linear memory complexity. RNN-based LLMs have been proposed as alternatives. Yet, RNN models struggle in long-context scenarios, making it challenging to replace self-attention with RNNs. We identify the state size as a critical bottleneck, which is significantly smaller than that of Transformers with a basic context length of 2k. However, simply increasing the state size significantly raises the number of parameters and lowers training efficiency. In this paper, we propose an efficient scaling method to scale the state size of RNN models to match the 2k context length of Transformers, with small parameters overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that scaling the state size significantly enhances long-context understanding. Retrieval performance scales almost linearly with state size, with a 454M model... | Kai Liu, Jianfei Gao, Kai Chen |  |

Discrete diffusion models apply token corruption independently using categorical distributions, allowing for different diffusion progress across tokens but lacking fine-grained control. Continuous diffusion models map tokens to continuous spaces and apply fine-grained noise, but the diffusion progress is uniform across tokens, limiting their ability to capture semantic nuances. To address these limitations, we propose Non-simultaneous Continuous Diffusion Models (NeoDiff), a novel diffusion model that integrates the strengths of both discrete and continuous approaches. NeoDiff introduces a Poisson diffusion process for the forward process, enabling a flexible and fine-grained noising paradigm, and employs a time predictor for the reverse process to adaptively modulate the denoising progress based on token semantics.... | Bocheng Li, Zhujin Gao, Linli Xu |  |

In contrast, smaller LMs are more accessible and sustainable, but their individual capabilities often fall short in generating high-quality, diverse, and reliable data. Inspired by collaborative human processes (e.g., peer review), we propose a multiple small LMs involved framework, GRA, that aggregates specialized roles across small LMs to iterative refinement and quality control typically achieved by a single large LM. In this collaborative framework, multiple small LMs assume distinct roles—Generator, Reviewer, and Adjudicator—to simulate a peer-review-inspired data synthesis pipeline. The Generator proposes initial data samples, the Reviewer critiques their quality and diversity, and the... | Xin Gao, Qizhi Pei, Zinan Tang, Yu Li, Honglin Lin, Jiang Wu, Lijun Wu, Conghui He |  |

To advance Spatial Artificial Intelligence, we pioneer a psychometric framework defining five Basic Spatial Abilities (BSAs) in Visual Language Models (VLMs): Spatial Perception, Spatial Relation, Spatial Orientation, Mental Rotation, and Spatial Visualization. Benchmarking 13 mainstream VLMs through nine validated psychometric experiments reveals significant gaps versus humans, with three key findings: 1) VLMs mirror human hierarchies (strongest in 2D orientation, weakest in 3D rotation) with independent BSAs; 2) Many smaller models surpass larger counterparts, with Qwen leading and InternVL2 lagging; 3) Interventions like CoT and few-shot training show limits from architectural constraints, while ToT demonstrates the most effective enhancement. Identified barriers include weak geometry encoding and missing dynamic simulation. By linking Psychometrics to VLMs, we provide a... | Wenrui Xu, Dalin Lyu, Weihang Wang, Jie Feng, Chen Gao, Yong Li |  |

To address this gap, we develop SPHERE (Spatial Perception and Hierarchical Evaluation of REasoning), a hierarchical evaluation framework supported by a new human-annotated dataset. SPHERE systematically probes models across increasing levels of complexity, from fundamental skills to multi-skill integration and high-level reasoning that combines spatial, visual, and logical understanding. Benchmark evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals significant deficiencies, especially in reasoning about distance and proximity, understanding both egocentric and allocentric perspectives, and applying spatial logic in physical contexts. These findings expose critical blind spots in existing models and underscore the need for more advanced spatial reasoning... | Wenyu Zhang, Wei En Ng, Lixin Ma, Yuwen Wang, Junqi Zhao, Allison Koenecke, Boyang Li, Lu Wang |  |

However, it has also given rise to trust issues regarding model consistency between users and third-party service providers. Specifically, service providers can effortlessly degrade a model’s parameter scale or precision for more margin profits, and although users may perceptibly experience differences in text quality, they often lack a reliable method for concrete monitoring. To address this problem, we propose a paradigm for model consistency monitoring on the user side. It constructs metrics based on the logits produced by LLMs to differentiate sequences generated by degraded models. Furthermore, by leveraging model offloading techniques, we demonstrate that the proposed method is implementable on consumer-grade devices. Metric evaluations... | Qijun Miao, Zhixuan Fang |  |

One Step Is Enough!](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.570/) |  | 0 | Large language models (LLMs) excel in various tasks but remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, where adversaries manipulate prompts to generate harmful outputs. Examining jailbreak prompts helps uncover the shortcomings of LLMs. However, current jailbreak methods and the target model’s defenses are engaged in an independent and adversarial process, resulting in the need for frequent attack iterations and redesigning attacks for different models. To address these gaps, we propose a Reverse Embedded Defense Attack (REDA) mechanism that disguises the attack intention as the “defense”. intention against harmful content. Specifically, REDA starts from the target response, guiding the model to embed harmful content within its defensive measures, thereby relegating harmful content to a secondary role and making the model believe it is performing a defensive task. The attacking model considers that it is guiding the target model to deal with harmful content, while the target model thinks it... | Weixiong Zheng, Peijian Zeng, Yiwei Li, Hongyan Wu, Nankai Lin, Junhao Chen, Aimin Yang, Yongmei Zhou |  |

However, existing methods lack effective control mechanisms for integrating internal and external knowledge. Inspired by human cognitive processes, we propose Parenting, a novel framework that decouples, identifies, and purposefully optimizes parameter subspaces related to adherence and robustness. Specifically, Parenting utilizes a key parameter mining method that combines forward and backward propagation signals to localize subspaces representing different capabilities. Then, Parenting employs a type-tailored tuning strategy, applying specific and appropriate optimizations to different subspaces, aiming to achieve a balanced enhancement of both adherence and robustness.

PaSa can autonomously make a series of decisions, including invoking search tools, reading papers, and selecting relevant references, to ultimately obtain comprehensive and accurate results for complex scholar queries. We optimize PaSa using reinforcement learning with a synthetic dataset, AutoScholarQuery, which includes 35k fine-grained academic queries and corresponding papers sourced from top-tier AI conference publications. Additionally, we develop RealScholarQuery, a benchmark collecting real-world academic queries to assess PaSa performance in more realistic scenarios. Despite being trained on synthetic data, PaSa significantly outperforms existing baselines on RealScholarQuery, including Google, Google Scholar, Google with GPT-4o for paraphrased queries, ChatGPT (search-enabled GPT-4o), GPT-o1, and PaSa-GPT-4o (PaSa implemented by prompting GPT-4o).

Our experiments encompass encoders with diverse training regimes and pretraining domains, as well as various pooling strategies applied to multi-sentence input tasks (including sentence ordering, sentiment classification, and natural language inference) requiring coarse-to-fine-grained reasoning. We find that ”less mature” representations (e.g., mean-pooled representations from BERT’s first or last layer, or representations from encoders with limited fine-tuning) exhibit greater generalizability and adaptability to downstream tasks compared to representations from extensively fine-tuned models (e.g., SBERT or SimCSE). These findings are consistent across different pretraining seed initializations... | Abhilasha Sancheti, David Dale, Artyom Kozhevnikov, Maha Elbayad |  |

However, efficient processing of long contexts using LLMs remains a significant challenge. We introduce \*\*EpMAN\*\* – a method for processing long contexts in an episodic memory module while holistically attending to semantically-relevant context chunks. Output from episodic attention is then used to reweigh the decoder’s self-attention to the stored KV cache of the context during training and generation. When an LLM decoder is trained using \*\*EpMAN\*\*, its performance on multiple challenging single-hop long-context recall and question-answering benchmarks is found to be stronger and more robust across the range from 16k to 256k tokens than baseline decoders trained with self-attention, and popular retrieval-augmented generation frameworks. | Subhajit Chaudhury, Payel Das, Sarathkrishna Swaminathan, Georgios Kollias, Elliot Nelson, Khushbu Pahwa, Tejaswini Pedapati, Igor Melnyk, Matthew Riemer |  |

UoRA achieves state-of-the-art efficiency by leveraging a low-rank approximation method that reduces the number of trainable parameters without compromising performance. Unlike existing methods such as LoRA and VeRA, UoRA employs a re-parametrization mechanism that eliminates the need to adapt frozen projection matrices while maintaining shared projection layers across the model. This results in halving the trainable parameters compared to LoRA and outperforming VeRA in computation and storage efficiency. Comprehensive experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate UoRA’s superiority in achieving competitive fine-tuning performance with minimal computational overhead. We demonstrate its performance on GLUE and E2E benchmarks and is effectiveness in instruction-tuning large language models and image classification models.

However, existing benchmarks lack comprehensive evaluations, particularly in multi-level reasoning, making it challenging to identify model limitations. To address this issue, we introduce Agri-CM3, an expert-validated benchmark assessing MLLMs’ understanding and reasoning in agricultural management. It includes 3,939 images and 15,901 multi-level multiple-choice questions with detailed explanations. Evaluations of 45 MLLMs reveal significant gaps. Even GPT-4o achieves only 63.64% accuracy, falling short in fine-grained reasoning tasks. Analysis across three reasoning levels and seven compositional abilities highlights key challenges in accuracy and cognitive understanding.

In high-stakes domains, it is crucial to understand where and how the content is created. To address this, we introduce the Text pROVEnance (TROVE) challenge, designed to trace each sentence of a target text back to specific source sentences within potentially lengthy or multi-document inputs. Beyond identifying sources, TROVE annotates the fine-grained relationships (quotation, compression, inference, and others), providing a deep understanding of how each target sentence is formed.To benchmark TROVE, we construct our dataset by leveraging three public datasets covering 11 diverse scenarios (e.g., QA and summarization) in English and Chinese, spanning source texts of varying lengths (0–5k, 5–10k, 10k+), emphasizing the multi-document and long-document settings essential for provenance.

To fill this gap, we perform the first study of textual multilingual long-form QA by creating CaLMQA, a dataset of \*\*51.7K\*\* culturally specific questions across \*\*23\*\* different languages. We define culturally specific questions as those that refer to concepts unique to one or a few cultures, or have different answers depending on the cultural or regional context. We obtain these questions by crawling naturally-occurring questions from community web forums in high-resource languages, and by hiring native speakers to write questions in under-resourced, rarely-studied languages such as Fijian and Kirundi. Our data collection methodologies are translation-free, enabling the collection of culturally unique questions like “Kuber iki umwami wa mbere w’uburundi yitwa Ntare?” (Kirundi; English... | Shane Arora, Marzena Karpinska, HungTing Chen, Ipsita Bhattacharjee, Mohit Iyyer, Eunsol Choi |  |

Embedding dimensions depend on application scenarios. Requiring a new dimension means training a new KGE model from scratch, increasing cost and limiting efficiency and flexibility. In this work, we propose a novel KGE training framework MED. It allows one training to obtain a croppable KGE model for multiple scenarios with different dimensional needs. Sub-models of required dimensions can be directly cropped and used without extra training. In MED, we propose a mutual learning mechanism to improve the low-dimensional sub-models and make high-dimensional sub-models retain the low-dimensional sub-models’ capacity, an evolutionary improvement mechanism to promote the high-dimensional sub-models to master the triple that the low-dimensional sub-models can not, and a dynamic loss weight to adaptively balance the multiple losses.

Recent approaches suffer from insufficient and repetitive knowledge retrieval, tedious and time-consuming query parsing, and monotonous knowledge utilization. To this end, we develop a Hypothesis Knowledge Graph Enhanced (HyKGE) framework, which leverages LLMs’ powerful reasoning capacity to compensate for the incompleteness of user queries, optimizes the interaction process with LLMs, and provides diverse retrieved knowledge. Specifically, HyKGE explores the zero-shot capability and the rich knowledge of LLMs with Hypothesis Outputs to extend feasible exploration directions in the KGs, as well as the carefully curated prompt to enhance the density and efficiency of LLMs’ responses. Furthermore, we introduce the HO Fragment Granularity-aware Rerank Module to filter out noise while ensuring the balance between... | Xinke Jiang, Ruizhe Zhang, Yongxin Xu, Rihong Qiu, Yue Fang, Zhiyuan Wang, Jinyi Tang, Hongxin Ding, Xu Chu, Junfeng Zhao, Yasha Wang |  |

Meanwhile, extending the context window in LLMs through post-pretraining is highly resource-intensive.To address this, we introduce LongRecipe, an efficient training strategy for extending the context window of LLMs, including impactful token analysis, position index transformation, and training optimization strategies. It simulates long-sequence inputs while maintaining training efficiency and significantly improves the model’s understanding of long-range dependencies. Experiments on three types of LLMs show that LongRecipe can utilize long sequences while requiring only 30% of the target context window size, and reduces computational training resource over 85% compared to full sequence training. Furthermore, LongRecipe also preserves the original LLM’s... | Zhiyuan Hu, Yuliang Liu, Jinman Zhao, Suyuchen Wang, WangYan WangYan, Wei Shen, Qing Gu, Anh Tuan Luu, SeeKiong Ng, Zhiwei Jiang, Bryan Hooi |  |

Nevertheless, while LoRA improves efficiency, there remains room for improvement in accuracy. Herein, we adopt a novel perspective to assess the characteristics of LoRA ranks. The results reveal that different ranks within the LoRA modules not only exhibit varying levels of importance but also evolve dynamically throughout the fine-tuning process, which may limit the performance of LoRA. Based on these findings, we propose BeamLoRA, which conceptualizes each LoRA module as a beam where each rank naturally corresponds to a potential sub-solution, and the fine-tuning process becomes a search for the optimal sub-solution combination. BeamLoRA dynamically eliminates underperforming sub-solutions while expanding the parameter space for promising ones, enhancing performance with a fixed rank.

Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) have demonstrated strong reasoning abilities in STEM tasks (e.g. mathematics and coding), they still struggle to generate creative expressions such as resonant jokes and insightful satire. Moreover, existing benchmarks are constrained by their limited modalities and insufficient categories, hindering the exploration of comprehensive creativity in video-based Comment Art creation. To address these limitations, we introduce \*\*GODBench\*\*, a novel benchmark that integrates video and text modalities to systematically evaluate MLLMs’ abilities to compose Comment Art.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), a promising approach, can conveniently integrate specialized knowledge into LLMs. In practice, there are diverse legal knowledge retrieval demands (e.g. law articles and similar cases). However, existing retrieval methods are either designed for general domains, struggling with legal knowledge, or tailored for specific legal tasks, unable to handle diverse legal knowledge types. Therefore, we propose a novel \*\*Uni\*\*fied \*\*L\*\*egal \*\*R\*\*etriever (UniLR) capable of performing multiple legal retrieval tasks for LLMs. Specifically, we introduce attention supervision to guide the retriever in focusing on key elements during knowledge encoding.

Value systems, such as Schwartz’s Theory of Basic Human Values, delineate the hierarchy and interplay among these values, enabling cross-disciplinary investigations into decision-making and societal dynamics. Recently, the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised concerns regarding their elusive intrinsic values. Despite growing efforts in evaluating, understanding, and aligning LLM values, a psychologically grounded LLM value system remains underexplored. This study addresses the gap by introducing the Generative Psycho-Lexical Approach (GPLA), a scalable, adaptable, and theoretically informed method for constructing value systems. Leveraging GPLA, we propose a psychologically grounded five-factor value system tailored for LLMs. For systematic validation, we present three benchmarking tasks that integrate psychological principles with cutting-edge AI priorities.

However, current role-playing training has two significant issues: (I) Using a predefined role profile to prompt dialogue training for specific scenarios usually leads to biases and even conflicts between the dialogue and the profile, resulting in training biases. (II) Models learn to imitate the role based solely on the profile, neglecting profile-dialogue alignment at the sentence level. To overcome the aforementioned hurdles, we propose a novel framework \*\*Beyond Dialogue\*\*, which introduces “beyond dialogue” tasks to align dialogue with profile traits for each scenario, eliminating biases during training. Furthermore, the framework achieves a sentence-level fine-grained alignment between profile and dialogue through an innovative prompting mechanism that generates reasoning data for training.

In this paper, we address this challenge by leveraging automated large-scale test-case synthesis to enhance code model training. Specifically, we design a pipeline that generates extensive (question, test-cases) pairs from existing code data. Using these test cases, we construct preference pairs based on pass rates over sampled programs to train reward models with Bradley-Terry loss. It shows an average of 10-point improvement for Llama-3.1-8B-Ins and 5-point improvement for Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Ins through best-of-32 sampling, making the 7B model on par with 236B DeepSeek-V2.5.

Yet, there remains no established metric to quantify this capability. In this work, we introduce a quantitative metric, Information Emergence (IE), designed to measure LLMs’ ability to extract semantics from input tokens. We formalize “semantics” as the meaningful information abstracted from a sequence of tokens and quantify this by comparing the entropy reduction observed for a sequence of tokens (macro-level) and individual tokens (micro-level). To achieve this, we design a lightweight estimator to compute the mutual information at each transformer layer, which is agnostic to different tasks and language model architectures. We apply IE in both synthetic in-context learning (ICL) scenarios and natural sentence contexts. Experiments demonstrate informativeness and patterns about semantics. While some of these patterns confirm the conventional prior linguistic knowledge, the... | Hang Chen, Xinyu Yang, Jiaying Zhu, Wenya Wang |  |

However, existing debate-based approaches remain limited in effectiveness in structured and detailed domains represented by code generation due to several reasons: 1) Reliance on different instances of the same LLM for debate, neglecting the potential benefits of integrating diverse models with varied internal knowledge for more comprehensive code generation, 2) under-utilization of test cases, and 3) reliance on third-party LLM moderators for result consolidation and decision-making, probably introducing hallucinations and judgment errors. To address these challenges, we propose DebateCoder to collect intelligence of LLMs via test case-driven debate for code generation. In DebateCoder, test cases serve as a medium for models to analyze code and identify bugs, while opposing models generate test cases... | Jizheng Chen, Kounianhua Du, Xinyi Dai, Weiming Zhang, Xihuai Wang, Yasheng Wang, Ruiming Tang, Weinan Zhang, Yong Yu |  |

Interestingly, we discover a counter-intuitive trade-off phenomenon that enhancing an LLM’s privacy awareness through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods significantly decreases its fairness awareness with thousands of samples. To address this issue, inspired by the information theory, we introduce a training-free method to Suppress the Privacy and faIrness coupled Neurons (SPIN), which theoretically and empirically decrease the mutual information between fairness and privacy awareness. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SPIN eliminates the trade-off phenomenon and significantly improves LLMs’ fairness and privacy awareness simultaneously without compromising general capabilities, e.g., improving Qwen-2-7B-Instruct’s fairness awareness by 12.2% and privacy awareness by 14.0%.More crucially, SPIN remains robust and effective with limited annotated data or even when only malicious... | Chen Qian, Dongrui Liu, Jie Zhang, Yong Liu, Jing Shao |  |

We attribute this challenge to the uneven memory performance of LLMs across different positions in graph description sequences, known as ”Positional bias”. To address this, we propose GraphInsight, a novel framework aimed at improving LLMs’ comprehension of both macro- and micro-level graphical information. GraphInsight is grounded in two key strategies: 1) placing critical graphical information in positions where LLMs exhibit stronger memory performance, and 2) investigating a lightweight external knowledge base for regions with weaker memory performance, inspired by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Moreover, GraphInsight explores integrating these two strategies into LLM agent processes for composite graph tasks that require multi-step... | Yukun Cao, Shuo Han, Zengyi Gao, Zezhong Ding, Xike Xie, S.

Automated, state-of-the-art text-dependent methods still involve substantial pre-training annotation labor and may not generalize to multiple languages. Hallucination of speech amid silence or non-speech noise can also plague these methods, which fall short in real-time applications due to post hoc whole-phrase evaluation. This paper introduces Phonotomizer, a compact, unsupervised, online training approach to automatic, multilingual phonetic segmentation, a critical first stage in transcription. Unlike prior approaches, Phonotomizer trains on raw sound files alone and can modulate computational exactness. Preliminary evaluations on Irish and Twi, two underrepresented languages, exhibit segmentation comparable to current forced alignment technology, reducing acoustic model size and minimizing training epochs. | Michael S.

Although existing datasets collect opinions from multiple annotators to model subjectivity, most existing computational methods fail to consider multi-perspective evaluation. To address this issue, we propose MPAQ, a multi-persona framework for argument quality assessment that simulates diverse evaluator perspectives through large language models. It first dynamically generates targeted personas tailored to an input argument, then simulates each persona’s reasoning process to evaluate the argument quality from multiple perspectives. To effectively generate fine-grained quality scores, we develop a coarse-to-fine scoring strategy that first generates a coarse-grained integer score and then refines it into a fine-grained decimal score.

However, to mitigate hallucinations in CoT that are notoriously difficult to detect, current methods such as process reward models (PRMs) or self-consistency operate as opaque boxes and do not provide checkable evidence for their judgments, possibly limiting their effectiveness. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from the idea that “the gold standard for supporting a mathematical claim is to provide a proof”. We propose a retrospective, step-aware formal verification framework Safe. Rather than assigning arbitrary scores, we strive to articulate mathematical claims in formal mathematical language Lean 4 at each reasoning step and provide formal proofs to identify hallucinations. We evaluate our framework Safe across multiple language models and various mathematical datasets, demonstrating a significant performance improvement while offering... | Chengwu Liu, Ye Yuan, Yichun Yin, Yan Xu, Xin Xu, Zaoyu Chen, Yasheng Wang, Lifeng Shang, Qun Liu, Ming Zhang |  |

This paper presents a novel retrieval-based speculative decoding method that adapts the suffix automaton (SAM) for efficient and accurate draft generation by utilizing the generating text sequence and static text corpus. Unlike existing n-gram matching methods, SAM-Decoding finds the exact longest suffix match, achieving an average time complexity of O(1) per generation step of SAM update and suffix retrieval.It can also integrate with existing methods, adaptively selecting a draft generation strategy based on match length to generalize to broader domains. Extensive experiments on Spec-Bench show that our method is 18% faster than other retrieval-based SD methods.... | Yuxuan Hu, Ke Wang, Xiaokang Zhang, Fanjin Zhang, Cuiping Li, Hong Chen, Jing Zhang |  |

Current psychological LLMs are constrained by passive response mechanisms, limiting their capacity to deploy proactive strategies for psychological counseling. To bridge this gap, we first develop the ProPsyC (Proactive Psychological Conversation) dataset, a multi-turn conversation dataset with interpretive labels including strategy decision logic and reaction attribution. Based on ProPsyC, we propose PsyAdvisor by supervised fine-tuning, a plug-and-play proactive questioning strategy planner that empowers psychological LLMs to initiate well-timed questioning through strategic prompting. Experimental results demonstrate that psychological LLMs integrated with PsyAdvisor substantially improve proactive questioning capacity, conversation depth, and response quality.Furthermore, PsyAdvisor shows promising potential in assisting novice counselors by providing strategy... | Yuxin Hu, Danni Liu, Bo Liu, Yida Chen, Jiuxin Cao, Yan Liu |  |

While recent studies have explored integrating LLMs into smart home systems, they primarily focus on handling straightforward, valid single-device operation instructions. However, real-world scenarios are far more complex and often involve users issuing invalid instructions or controlling multiple devices simultaneously. These have two main challenges: LLMs must accurately identify and rectify errors in user instructions and execute multiple user instructions perfectly. To address these challenges and advance the development of LLM-based smart home assistants, we introduce HomeBench, the first smart home dataset with valid and invalid instructions across single and multiple devices in this paper. We have experimental results on 13 distinct... | Silin Li, Yuhang Guo, Jiashu Yao, Zeming Liu, Haifeng Wang |  |

To address these limitations, this paper leverages preference alignment techniques, which enable targeted construction of out-of-pretraining-distribution data to enhance performance. We introduce a new dataset, named the Intelligibility Preference Speech Dataset (INTP), and extend the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) framework to accommodate diverse TTS architectures. After INTP alignment, in addition to intelligibility, we observe overall improvements including naturalness, similarity, and audio quality for multiple TTS models across diverse domains. Based on that, we also verify the weak-to-strong generalization ability of INTP for more intelligible models such as CosyVoice 2 and Ints. Moreover, we showcase the potential for further... | Xueyao Zhang, Yuancheng Wang, Chaoren Wang, Ziniu Li, Zhuo Chen, Zhizheng Wu |  |

A key approach is self-training, where LLMs are iteratively trained on self-generated correct code snippets. In this case, the self-generated codes are drawn from a conditional distribution, conditioned on a specific seed description. However, the seed description is not the only valid representation that aligns with its intended meaning. With all valid descriptions and codes forming a joint space, codes drawn from the conditional distribution would lead to an underrepresentation of the full description-code space. As such, we propose Gibbs Fine-Tuning (GiFT), a novel self-training method inspired by Gibbs sampling. GiFT allows self-generated data to be drawn from the marginal distribution of the joint space, thereby mitigating the biases inherent in conditional sampling. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating the potential benefits of fine-tuning LLMs with code derived from... | Haochen Li, Wanjin Feng, Xin Zhou, Zhiqi Shen |  |

Recent advances in CBMs have used Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate candidate concepts. However, a critical question remains: What is the optimal number of concepts to use? Current concept banks suffer from redundancy or insufficient coverage. To address this issue, we introduce a dynamic, agent-based approach that adjusts the concept bank in response to environmental feedback, optimizing the number of concepts for sufficiency yet concise coverage. Moreover, we propose Conditional Concept Bottleneck Models (CoCoBMs) to overcome the limitations in traditional CBMs’ concept scoring mechanisms. It enhances the accuracy of assessing each concept’s contribution to classification tasks and feature an editable matrix that allows LLMs to correct concept scores that conflict with their internal knowledge. Our evaluations across 6 datasets show that our... | Yiwen Jiang, Deval Mehta, Wei Feng, Zongyuan Ge |  |

As a result, developing effective detectors to mitigate these risks has become a critical priority. However, most existing detection methods focus excessively on detection accuracy, often neglecting the societal risks posed by high false positive rates (FPRs). This paper addresses this issue by leveraging Conformal Prediction (CP), which effectively constrains the upper bound of FPRs. While directly applying CP constrains FPRs, it also leads to a significant reduction in detection performance. To overcome this trade-off, this paper proposes a Zero-Shot Machine-Generated Text Detection Framework via Multiscaled Conformal Prediction (MCP), which both enforces the FPR constraint and improves detection performance. This paper also introduces RealDet, a high-quality dataset that spans a wide range of domains, ensuring realistic calibration and enabling... | Xiaowei Zhu, Yubing Ren, Yanan Cao, Xixun Lin, Fang Fang, Yangxi Li |  |

However, the consistency of embedding differences before and after transformation remains unaddressed, risking the loss of valuable inductive bias inherent in the embeddings. This inconsistency stems from two problems. First, transformation representations are specified for relations in a disconnected manner, allowing dissimilar transformations and corresponding entity embeddings for similar relations. Second, a generalized plug-in approach as a SFBR (Semantic Filter Based on Relations) disrupts this consistency through excessive concentration of entity embeddings under entity-based regularization, generating indistinguishable score distributions among relations. In this paper, we introduce a plug-in KGE method, Relation-Semantics Consistent Filter (RSCF). Its entity transformation has three features for enhancing semantic consistency: 1) shared affine transformation of... | Junsik Kim, Jinwook Park, Kangil Kim |  |

While previous research has predominantly concentrated on their ability to portray specified characters, we argue from a user-centered perspective that RPAs’ capability to advance the plot requires substantial improvements to deliver more engaging interaction. To bridge this gap, we propose RolePlot, a role-playing framework specifically designed to evaluate and enhance the plot-progression capabilities of RPAs. RolePlot begins by constructing a plot-progression dataset extended from human-written literary scripts and specially designed synthetic data, followed by narrative theory-driven manual annotation and automated labeling validated through human verification. We then exploit the over-parameterized embedding space of LLMs to detect a “trigger subspace” that identifies dialogue segments catalyzing plot transitions. When user’s inputs align with this subspace, we explicitly prompt... | Pinyi Zhang, Siyu An, Lingfeng Qiao, Yifei Yu, Jingyang Chen, Jie Wang, Di Yin, Xing Sun, Kai Zhang |  |

Compared to conventional independent chain sampling strategies with outcome supervision, tree search enables better exploration of the reasoning space and provides dense, on-policy process rewards during RL training but remains under-explored in On-Policy LLM RL. We propose TreeRL, a reinforcement learning framework that directly incorporates on-policy tree search for RL training. Our approach includes intermediate supervision and eliminates the need for separate reward model training. Existing approaches typically train a separate process reward model, which can suffer from distribution mismatch and reward hacking. We also introduce a cost-effective tree search approach that achieves higher search efficiency under the same generation token budget by strategically branching from high-uncertainty intermediate steps rather than using random branching.

CoALM: A Unified Conversational Agentic Language Model](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.605/) |  | 0 | Large Language Models (LLMs) with API-calling capabilities enabled building effective Language Agents (LA), while also revolutionizing the conventional task-oriented dialogue (TOD) paradigm. However, current approaches face a critical dilemma: TOD systems are often trained on a limited set of target APIs, requiring new data to maintain their quality when interfacing with new services, while LAs are not trained to maintain user intent over multi-turn conversations. Because both robust multi-turn management and advanced function calling are crucial for effective conversational agents, we evaluate these skills on three popular benchmarks: MultiWOZ 2.4 (TOD), BFCL V3 (LA), and API-Bank (LA)—and our analyses reveal that specialized approaches excel in one domain but underperform in the other. To bridge this chasm, we introduce \*\*CoALM\*\* (\*\*C\*\*onversational \*\*A\*\*gentic \*\*L\*\*anguage \*\*M\*\*odel), a unified approach that integrates both conversational and agentic... | Emre Can Acikgoz, Jeremiah Greer, Akul Datta, Ze Yang, William Zeng, Oussama Elachqar, Emmanouil Koukoumidis, Dilek HakkaniTür, Gokhan Tur |  |

To address these challenges, we introduce M4Doc, a novel single-to-mix Modality alignment framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). M4Doc aligns an imageonly encoder with the multimodal representations of an MLLM, pre-trained on large-scale document image datasets. This alignment enables a lightweight DIMT model to learn crucial visual-textual correlations during training. During inference, M4Doc bypasses the MLLM, maintaining computational efficiency while benefiting from its multimodal knowledge. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in translation quality, especially in cross-domain generalization and challenging document image scenarios. The code will be released upon acceptance. | Yupu Liang, Yaping Zhang, Zhiyang Zhang, Yang Zhao, Lu Xiang, Chengqing Zong, Yu Zhou |  |

Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has proven effective in aligning LLM behavior with human preferences across various agent tasks. However, standard DPO focuses solely on individual turns, which limits its effectiveness in multi-turn social interactions. Several DPO-based multi-turn alignment methods with session-level data have shown potential in addressing this problem. While these methods consider multiple turns across entire sessions, they are often overly coarse-grained, introducing training noise, and lack robust theoretical support. To resolve these limitations, we propose Segment-Level Direct Preference Optimization (SDPO), which dynamically select key segments within interactions to optimize multi-turn agent behavior. SDPO minimizes training noise and is grounded in a rigorous theoretical framework.

Crowdsourced data collection methods require strict worker training, and data from real-world counseling environments may raise privacy and ethical concerns. While recent studies have explored using large language models (LLMs) to augment psychological counseling dialogue datasets, the resulting data often suffers from limited diversity and authenticity. To address these limitations, this study adopts a role-playing approach where trained counselors simulate counselor-client interactions, ensuring high-quality dialogues while mitigating privacy risks. Using this method, we construct KokoroChat, a Japanese psychological counseling dialogue dataset comprising 6,589 long-form dialogues, each accompanied by comprehensive client feedback. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning open-source LLMs with KokoroChat improves both the quality of generated counseling responses and... | Zhiyang Qi, Takumasa Kaneko, Keiko Takamizo, Mariko Ukiyo, Michimasa Inaba |  |

Recently, researchers have begun using LLMs to automate survey generation for better efficiency. However, the quality gap between LLM-generated surveys and those written by human remains significant, particularly in terms of outline quality and citation accuracy. To close these gaps, we introduce SURVEYFORGE, which first generates the outline by analyzing the logical structure of human-written outlines and referring to the retrieved domain-related articles. Subsequently, leveraging high-quality papers retrieved from memory by our scholar navigation agent, SURVEYFORGE can automatically generate and refine the content of the generated article. Moreover, to achieve a comprehensive evaluation, we construct SurveyBench, which includes 100 human-written survey papers for win-rate comparison and assesses AI-generated survey papers across three dimensions: reference, outline,... | Xiangchao Yan, Shiyang Feng, Jiakang Yuan, Renqiu Xia, Bin Wang, Lei Bai, Bo Zhang |  |

While most existing research has focused on English-centric translation directions, the exploration of many-to-many translation is still limited by the scarcity of parallel data. To address this, we propose a three-stage curriculum learning strategy that leverages the machine translation capabilities of large language models and adapts them to S2TT tasks, enabling effective learning in low-resource settings. We trained MLLMs with varying parameter sizes (3B, 7B, and 32B) and evaluated the proposed strategy using the FLEURS and CoVoST-2 datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed strategy achieves state-of-the-art average performance in 15×14 language pairs, requiring fewer than 10 hours of speech data per language to achieve competitive results.

AbGen consists of 2,000 expert-annotated examples derived from 677 NLP papers. In this benchmark, LLMs are tasked with generating detailed ablation study designs for a specified module or process based on the given research context. Our evaluation of leading LLMs, such as GPT-4o and Llama-3.1, highlights a significant performance gap between these models and human experts in terms of the importance, faithfulness, and soundness of the ablation study designs. Moreover, we demonstrate that current automated evaluation methods are not reliable for our task, as they show a significant discrepancy when compared to human assessment. To better investigate this, we develop AbGen-Eval, a meta-evaluation benchmark designed to assess the reliability of commonly used automated evaluation systems in measuring LLM performance on our task.

The rapid growth has inevitably led to significant redundancy among benchmarks. Therefore, it is crucial to take a step back and critically assess the current state of redundancy and propose targeted principles for constructing effective MLLM benchmarks. In this paper, we focus on redundancy from three key perspectives: 1) Redundancy of benchmark capability dimensions, 2) Redundancy in the number of test questions, and 3) Cross-benchmark redundancy within specific domains. Through the comprehensive analysis over hundreds of MLLMs’ performance across more than 20 benchmarks, we aim to quantitatively measure the level of redundancy lies in existing MLLM evaluations, provide valuable insights to guide the future development of MLLM benchmarks, and offer strategies to refine and address redundancy issues... | Zicheng Zhang, Xiangyu Zhao, Xinyu Fang, Chunyi Li, Xiaohong Liu, Xiongkuo Min, Haodong Duan, Kai Chen, Guangtao Zhai |  |

However, existing RAG frameworks are primarily designed for text-based LLMs and rely on Automatic Speech Recognition to process speech input, which discards crucial audio information, risks transcription errors, and increases computational overhead. Therefore, we introduce WavRAG, the first retrieval augmented generation framework with native, end-to-end audio support. WavRAG offers two key features: 1) Bypassing ASR, WavRAG directly processes raw audio for both embedding and retrieval. 2) WavRAG integrates audio and text into a unified knowledge representation. Specifically, we propose the WavRetriever to facilitate the retrieval from a text-audio hybrid knowledge base, and further enhance the in-context capabilities of spoken dialogue models through the integration of chain-of-thought reasoning.

However, developing robust ASR models for young children’s speech remains challenging due to differences in pronunciation, tone, and pace compared to adult speech. In this paper, we introduce a new Mandarin speech dataset focused on children aged 3 to 5, addressing the scarcity of resources in this area. The dataset comprises 41.25 hours of speech with carefully crafted manual transcriptions, collected from 397 speakers across various provinces in China, with balanced gender representation. We provide a comprehensive analysis of speaker demographics, speech duration distribution and geographic coverage. Additionally, we evaluate ASR performance on models trained from scratch, such as Conformer, as well as fine-tuned pre-trained models like HuBERT and Whisper, where fine-tuning demonstrates significant performance... | Jiaming Zhou, Shiyao Wang, Shiwan Zhao, Jiabei He, Haoqin Sun, Hui Wang, Cheng Liu, Aobo Kong, Yujie Guo, Xi Yang, Yequan Wang, Yonghua Lin, Yong Qin |  |

Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) further enhances this process by constructing preference pairs of chosen and rejected responses. In this work, we aim to scale up the number of on-policy samples via repeated random sampling to improve alignment performance. Conventional practice selects the sample with the highest reward as chosen and the lowest as rejected for DPO. However, our experiments reveal that this strategy leads to a decline in performance as the sample size increases. To address this, we investigate preference data construction through the lens of underlying normal distribution of sample rewards. We categorize the reward space into seven representative points and systematically explore all 21 (C72) pairwise combinations.

However, these models also present significant risks of generating harmful protein sequences, such as those that enhance viral transmissibility or evade immune responses. These concerns underscore critical biosafety and ethical challenges. To address these issues, we propose a Knowledge-guided Preference Optimization (KPO) framework that integrates prior knowledge via a Protein Safety Knowledge Graph. This framework utilizes an efficient graph pruning strategy to identify preferred sequences and employs reinforcement learning to minimize the risk of generating harmful proteins. Experimental results demonstrate that KPO effectively reduces the likelihood of producing hazardous sequences while maintaining high functionality, offering a robust safety assurance framework for applying generative models in biotechnology. | Yuhao Wang, Keyan Ding, Kehua Feng, Zeyuan Wang, Ming Qin, Xiaotong Li, Qiang Zhang, Huajun Chen |  |

Existing methods are based on the assumption that different nodes exhibit varying degrees of influence on predictions. They define nodes with high predictive influence as important nodes and target them for attacks. If the model treats nodes’ predictive influence more uniformly, attackers will find it harder to target high predictive influence nodes. In this paper, we propose Similarizing the predictive Influence of Nodes with Contrastive Learning (SINCon), a defense mechanism that encourages the model to learn graph representations where nodes with varying importance have a more uniform influence on... | Mingqing Zhang, Qiang Liu, Xiang Tao, Shu Wu, Liang Wang |  |

While channel-wise operations and adaptive gradient scaling are recognized causes, practical mitigation remains challenging. We introduce \*\*Outlier-Safe Pre-Training (OSP)\*\*, a practical guideline that proactively prevents outlier formation, rather than relying on post-hoc mitigation. OSP combines three key innovations: (1) the Muon optimizer, eliminating privileged bases while maintaining training efficiency, (2) Single-Scale RMSNorm, preventing channel-wise amplification, and (3) a learnable embedding projection, redistributing activation magnitudes. We validate OSP by training a 1.4B-parameter model on 1 trillion tokens, which is the first production-scale LLM trained without such outliers. Under aggressive 4-bit quantization, our OSP model achieves a 35.7 average score across 10 benchmarks (versus 26.5 for an Adam-trained model),... | Jungwoo Park, Taewhoo Lee, Chanwoong Yoon, Hyeon Hwang, Jaewoo Kang |  |

However, traditional approaches adopt a “flood irrigation” methodology that indiscriminately injects gold trajectories, external feedback, and domain knowledge into agent models. This practice overlooks the fundamental human cognitive principle of self-awareness - the ability to dynamically assess situational demands and strategically employ resources during decision-making. We propose Agentic Knowledgeable Self-awareness to address this gap, a novel paradigm enabling LLM-based agents to autonomously regulate knowledge utilization. Specifically, we propose KnowSelf, a data-centric approach that applies agents with knowledgeable self-awareness like humans. Concretely, we devise a heuristic situation judgement criterion to mark special tokens on the agent’s self-explored trajectories for collecting training data.

However, the field faces challenges in developing task-agnostic, reliable, and explainable evaluation metrics. This paper introduces CIGEval, a unified agentic framework for comprehensive evaluation of conditional image generation tasks. CIGEval utilizes large multimodal models (LMMs) as its core, integrating a multi-functional toolbox and establishing a fine-grained evaluation framework. Additionally, we synthesize evaluation trajectories for fine-tuning, empowering smaller LMMs to autonomously select appropriate tools and conduct nuanced analyses based on tool outputs. Experiments across seven prominent conditional image generation tasks demonstrate that CIGEval (GPT-4o version) achieves a high correlation of 0.4625 with human assessments, closely matching the inter-annotator correlation of 0.47. Notably, when implemented with 7B open-source LMMs using only 2.3K training... | Jifang Wang, Yangxue Yangxue, Longyue Wang, Zhenran Xu, Yiyu Wang, Yaowei Wang, Weihua Luo, Kaifu Zhang, Baotian Hu, Min Zhang |  |

Recent research suggests continuous program refinements through visible tests to improve code generation accuracy in LLMs. However, these methods suffer from LLMs’ inefficiency and limited reasoning capacity. In this work, we propose an LLM programming workflow (LPW) designed to improve both initial code generation and subsequent refinements within a structured two-phase workflow. Specifically, the solution generation phase formulates a solution plan, which is then verified through visible tests to specify the intended natural language solution. Subsequently, the code implementation phase drafts an initial code according to the solution plan and its verification. If the generated code fails the visible tests, the plan verification serves as the intended solution to consistently inform the refinement process for correcting bugs.

An Empirical Study Over Open-ended Question Answering](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.622/) |  | 0 | Recent works integrating Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have shown promising improvements in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on closed-ended tasks, leaving a gap in evaluating performance on more complex, real-world scenarios. This limitation also hinders a thorough assessment of KGs’ potential to reduce hallucinations in LLMs. To address this, we introduce OKGQA, a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs augmented with KGs in open-ended, real-world question answering settings. OKGQA reflects practical complexities through diverse question types and incorporates metrics to quantify both hallucination rates and reasoning improvements in LLM+KG models. To consider the scenarios in which KGs may contain varying levels of errors, we propose a benchmark variant, OKGQA-P, to assess model performance when the semantics and structure of KGs are deliberately perturbed and contaminated. In this paper, we... | Yuan Sui, Yufei He, Zifeng Ding, Bryan Hooi |  |

This process necessitates training an aligned version for every base model, resulting in significant computational overhead. In this work, we propose NUDGING, a simple, training-free algorithm that aligns any base model at inference time using a small aligned model. NUDGING is motivated by recent findings that alignment primarily alters the model’s behavior on a small subset of stylistic tokens (e.g., discourse markers). We find that base models are significantly more uncertain when generating these tokens. Building on this insight, NUDGING employs a small aligned model to generate nudging tokens to guide the base model’s output during decoding when the base model’s uncertainty is high, with only a minor additional inference overhead. We evaluate NUDGING across 3 model families on a diverse range of open-instruction tasks. Without any training, nudging a large base model with a 7×-14×... | Yu Fei, Yasaman Razeghi, Sameer Singh |  |

Within such systems, repetitive transformations can lead to stable configurations, known as attractors, including fixed points and limit cycles. Applying this perspective to large language models (LLMs), which iteratively map input text to output text, provides a principled approach to characterizing long-term behaviors. Successive paraphrasing serves as a compelling testbed for exploring such dynamics, as paraphrases re-express the same underlying meaning with linguistic variation. Although LLMs are expected to explore a diverse set of paraphrases in the text space, our study reveals that successive paraphrasing converges to stable periodic states, such as 2-period attractor cycles, limiting linguistic diversity. This phenomenon is attributed to the self-reinforcing nature of LLMs, as they iteratively favour and amplify certain textual forms over others. This pattern persists with... | Zhilin Wang, Yafu Li, Jianhao Yan, Yu Cheng, Yue Zhang |  |

However, the precise definition of style and the relationship between style, data quality, and LLM performance remains unclear. This research identifies two key stylistic elements in responses: linguistic form and instructional surprisal. We find that, among training data of comparable quality, higher consistency in these response elements leads to better LLM performance. Inspired by this, we introduce Style Consistency-Aware Response Ranking (SCAR), which automatically prioritizes instruction-response pairs in the training set based on their response stylistic consistency. By selecting the most style-consistent examples, using 0.7% of the full dataset in certain cases, the fine-tuned LLMs can match or even surpass the... | Zhuang Li, Yuncheng Hua, ThuyTrang Vu, Haolan Zhan, Lizhen Qu, Gholamreza Haffari |  |

However, it carries the risk of catastrophic forgetting during sequential training, the parametric knowledge or the ability learned in previous stages may be overwhelmed by incoming training data. This paper finds that LLMs can restore some original knowledge by regularly resetting partial parameters. Inspired by this, we introduce Half Fine-Tuning (HFT) for LLMs, as a substitute for full fine-tuning (FFT), to mitigate the forgetting issues, where half of the parameters are selected to learn new tasks. In contrast, the other half are frozen to retain previous knowledge. We provide a feasibility analysis from the optimization perspective and interpret the parameter selection operation as a regularization term. HFT could be seamlessly integrated into existing fine-tuning frameworks... | Tingfeng Hui, Zhenyu Zhang, Shuohuan Wang, Weiran Xu, Yu Sun, Hua Wu |  |

However, answering commonsense questions correctly requires not only knowledge but also reasoning—even for seemingly simple questions. We demonstrate that such hidden reasoning attributes in commonsense questions can lead evaluation accuracy differences of up to 24.8% across different difficulty levels in the same benchmark. Current benchmarks overlook these hidden reasoning attributes, making it difficult to assess a model’s specific levels of commonsense knowledge and reasoning ability. To address this issue, we introduce ReComSBench, a novel framework that reveals hidden reasoning attributes behind commonsense questions by leveraging the knowledge generated during the reasoning process. Additionally, ReComSBench proposes three new metrics for decoupled evaluation: Knowledge Balanced Accuracy, Marginal Sampling Gain, and Knowledge Coverage Ratio. Experiments show that... | Huijun Lian, Zekai Sun, Keqi Chen, Yingming Gao, Ya Li |  |

Traditional generation methods focus primarily on textual quality, but they often overlook educational objectives. Moreover, these methods address only single-dimensional, simple question generation, failing to meet complex, multifaceted educational requirements. To address these challenges, we constructed and annotated EduMath, a dataset of 16k mathematical questions with multi-dimensional educational objectives. Based on this dataset, we developed EQGEVAL, which incorporates three evaluation dimensions and is designed to assess the ability of models to generate educational questions. Drawing inspiration from teachers’ problem design processes, we propose the Educational Question Planning with self-Reflection (EQPR) method for educational mathematical question generation, following a “plan-evaluate-optimize” approach.

However, LLMs still encounter challenges in effectively utilizing the knowledge from retrieved documents, often being misled by irrelevant or noisy information. To address this issue, we introduce RankCoT, a knowledge refinement method that incorporates reranking signals in generating CoT-based summarization for knowledge refinement based on given query and all retrieval documents. During training, RankCoT prompts the LLM to generate Chain-of-Thought (CoT) candidates based on the query and individual documents. It then fine-tunes the LLM to directly reproduce the best CoT from these candidate outputs based on all retrieved documents, which requires LLM to filter out irrelevant documents during generating CoT-style summarization. Additionally, RankCoT incorporates a self-reflection mechanism that further refines the CoT outputs, resulting in higher-quality... | Mingyan Wu, Zhenghao Liu, Yukun Yan, Xinze Li, Shi Yu, Zheni Zeng, Yu Gu, Ge Yu |  |

However, translationese—characterized by overly literal and unnatural translations—remains a persistent challenge in LLM-based translation systems. Despite their pre-training on vast corpora of natural utterances, LLMs exhibit translationese errors and generate unexpected unnatural translations, stemming from biases introduced during supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In this work, we systematically evaluate the prevalence of translationese in LLM-generated translations and investigate its roots during supervised training. We introduce methods to mitigate these biases, including polishing golden references and filtering unnatural training instances. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that these approaches significantly reduce translationese while improving translation naturalness, validated by human evaluations and automatic metrics.

While KV Cache can significantly reduce recomputation during inference, it also introduces additional memory overhead. KV Cache quantization presents a promising solution, striking a good balance between memory usage and accuracy. Previous research has shown that the Keys are distributed by channel, while the Values are distributed by token. Consequently, the common practice is to apply channel-wise quantization to the Keys and token-wise quantization to the Values. However, our further investigation reveals that a small subset of unusual tokens exhibit unique characteristics that deviate from this pattern, which can substantially impact quantization accuracy. To address this, we develop a simple yet effective method to identify these tokens accurately during the decoding process and exclude them from quantization as outlier tokens, significantly... | Yi Su, Yuechi Zhou, Quantong Qiu, Juntao Li, Qingrong Xia, Ping Li, Xinyu Duan, Zhefeng Wang, Min Zhang |  |

In this paper, we study if large language models (LLMs) can generate accurate definitions for these buzzwords based on UGC as examples. Our work serves a threefold contribution. First, we introduce CHEER, the first dataset of Chinese internet buzzwords, each annotated with a definition and relevant UGC. Second, we propose a novel method, called RESS, to effectively steer the comprehending process of LLMs to produce more accurate buzzword definitions, mirroring the skills of human language learning. Third, with CHEER, we benchmark the strengths and weaknesses of various off-the-shelf definition generation methods and our RESS. Our benchmark demonstrates the effectiveness of RESS while revealing a crucial shared challenge: comprehending unseen buzzwords and leveraging sufficient, high-quality UGC to facilitate this comprehension.

In this work, we propose EAC-MoE, an Expert-Selection Aware Compressor for MoE-LLMs, which deeply aligns with the characteristics of MoE from the perspectives of quantization and pruning, and introduces two modules to address these two challenges respectively: (1) The expert selection bias caused by low-bit quantization is a major factor contributing to the performance degradation in MoE-LLMs. Based on this, we propose Quantization with Expert-Selection Calibration (QESC), which mitigates the expert selection bias by calibrating the routers within the MoE; (2) There are always certain experts that are not crucial for the corresponding tasks, yet causing inference latency. Therefore, we propose... | Yuanteng Chen, Yuantian Shao, Peisong Wang, Jian Cheng |  |

In this work, we explore a novel perspective on hallucination mitigation by examining the intermediate activations of LVLMs during generation. Our investigation reveals that hallucinated content manifests as distinct, identifiable patterns in the model’s hidden state space. Motivated by this finding, we propose Activation Steering Decoding (ASD), a training-free approach that mitigates hallucination through targeted intervention in the model’s intermediate activations. ASD operates by first identifying directional patterns of hallucination in the activation space using a small calibration set, then employing a contrast decoding mechanism that computes the difference between positive and negative steering predictions. This approach effectively suppresses hallucination patterns... | Jingran Su, Jingfan Chen, Hongxin Li, Yuntao Chen, Li Qing, Zhaoxiang Zhang |  |

This inspired researchers to investigate self-training methods to mitigate the extensive reliance on human annotations. However, the current success of self-training has been primarily observed in natural language scenarios, rather than in the increasingly important neural-symbolic scenarios. To this end, we propose an environment-guided neural-symbolic self-training framework named ENVISIONS. It aims to overcome two main challenges: (1) the scarcity of symbolic data, and (2) the limited proficiency of LLMs in processing symbolic language. Extensive evaluations conducted on three distinct domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Additionally, we have conducted a comprehensive analysis to uncover the factors contributing to ENVISIONS’s success, thereby... | Fangzhi Xu, Qiushi Sun, Kanzhi Cheng, Jun Liu, Yu Qiao, Zhiyong Wu |  |

However, there remain challenges in visual localization in medical images, which is crucial for abnormality detection and interpretation. To address these issues, we propose a novel UMed-LVLM designed to unveil medical abnormalities. Specifically, we collect a Medical Abnormalities Unveiling (MAU) dataset and propose a two-stage training method for UMed-LVLM training. To collect MAU dataset, we propose a prompt method utilizing the GPT-4V to generate diagnoses based on identified abnormal areas in medical images. Moreover, the two-stage training method includes Abnormal-Aware Instruction Tuning and Abnormal-Aware Rewarding, comprising Relevance Reward, Abnormal Localization Reward and Vision Relevance Reward.

However, existing methods transforming LLMs from dense to MoE face significant data requirements and typically rely on large-scale post-training. In this paper, we propose Upcycling Instruction Tuning (UpIT), a data-efficient approach for tuning a dense pre-trained model into a MoE instruction model. Specifically, we first point out that intermediate checkpoints during instruction tuning of the dense model are naturally suitable for specialized experts, and then propose an expert expansion stage to flexibly achieve models with flexible numbers of experts, where genetic algorithm and parameter merging are introduced to ensure sufficient diversity of new extended experts. To ensure that each specialized expert in the MoE model works as expected, we select a small amount of seed data that each expert excels to pre-optimize the... | Tingfeng Hui, Zhenyu Zhang, Shuohuan Wang, Yu Sun, Hua Wu, Sen Su |  |

Traditional approaches rely heavily on historical observations as spatio-temporal contexts for decision making, leading to significant storage and computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce MapNav, a novel end-to-end VLN model that leverages Annotated Semantic Map (ASM) to replace historical frames. Specifically, our approach constructs a top-down semantic map at the start of each episode and update it at each timestep, allowing for precise object mapping and structured navigation information. Then, we enhance this map with explicit textual labels for key regions, transforming abstract semantics into clear navigation cues and generate our ASM. MapNav agent using the constructed ASM as input, and use the powerful end-to-end capabilities of VLM to empower VLN.

Current research suggests that multi-task training outperforms single-task as different tasks can benefit each other, but they often overlook the internal relationships within these tasks. To analyze this phenomenon, we attempted to employ \*\*compositional generalization\*\* (CG), which refers to the models’ ability to understand novel combinations by recombining learned elements, as a guiding framework. Since medical images can be precisely defined by \*\*M\*\*odality, \*\*A\*\*natomical area, and \*\*T\*\*ask, naturally providing an environment for exploring CG, we assembled 106 medical datasets to create \*\*Med-MAT\*\* for comprehensive experiments.

Most existing approaches to address these rely on pretraining or fine-tuning, which are resource-intensive. In this paper, inspired by observing the disparities in cross-modal attention patterns across languages, we propose Cross-Lingual Attention Intervention for Mitigating multilingual object hallucination (CLAIM) in LVLMs, a novel near training-free method by aligning attention patterns. CLAIM first identifies language-specific cross-modal attention heads, then estimates language shift vectors from English to the target language, and finally intervenes in the attention outputs during inference to facilitate cross-lingual visual perception capability alignment.

However, training such assistants is hindered mainly due to the lack of reliable and large-scale datasets. Prior human-annotated CPS datasets are extremely small in size and lack integration with real-world product search systems. We propose a novel approach, TRACER, which leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate realistic and natural conversations for different shopping domains. TRACER’s novelty lies in grounding the generation to dialogue plans, which are product search trajectories predicted from a decision tree model, that guarantees relevant product discovery in the shortest number of search conditions.

However, most previous existing methods mainly view each programming language in isolation and ignore the knowledge transfer among different programming languages. To bridge the gap among different programming languages, we introduce a novel multi-agent collaboration framework to enhance multilingual instruction tuning for code LLMs, where multiple language-specific intelligent agent components with generation memory work together to transfer knowledge from one language to another efficiently and effectively. Specifically, we first generate the language-specific instruction data from the code snippets and then provide the generated data as the seed data for language-specific agents.

Recent efforts leverage Vision Language Models (VLMs) as direct controllers, frequently pausing the game to analyze screens and plan action through language reasoning. However, this inefficient paradigm fundamentally restricts agents to basic and non-fluent interactions: relying on isolated VLM reasoning for each action makes it impossible to handle tasks requiring high reactivity (e.g., FPS shooting) or dynamic adaptability (e.g., ACT combat). To handle this, we propose a paradigm shift in gameplay agent design: instead of direct control, VLM serves as a developer, creating specialized execution modules tailored for tasks like shooting and combat. These modules handle real-time game interactions, elevating VLM to a high-level developer. Building upon this paradigm, we introduce GameSense, a gameplay agent framework where VLM... | Wenxuan Lu, Jiangyang He, Zhanqiu Zhang, Steven Y. Guo, Tianning Zang |  |

However, current post-training techniques rely heavily on supervisory signals, such as outcome supervision or auxiliary reward models, which face the problem of scalability and high annotation costs. This motivates us to enhance LLM reasoning without the need for external supervision. Given the input query, the LLM seeks the globally optimal response by stepwise sampling and self-rewarding, and optimizes itself with the collected responses. Genius offers some technical solutions to address the following key challenges. To tackle the problem of how to determine the steps in the response via self-rewarding, Genius introduces a stepwise foresight re-sampling strategy to sample and estimate the step value by simulating future outcomes.

This paper further advances this line of research by considering the uncertainty in the knowledge. The uncertain nature of knowledge is widely observed in the real world, but does not align seamlessly with the first-order logic underpinning existing studies. To bridge this gap, we study the setting of soft queries on uncertain knowledge, which is motivated by the establishment of soft constraint programming. We further propose an ML-based approach with both forward inference and backward calibration to answer soft queries on large-scale, incomplete, and uncertain knowledge graphs. Theoretical discussions reveal that our method ensures there are no catastrophic cascading errors in our forward inference algorithm while maintaining the same complexity as state-of-the-art inference algorithms for first-order queries.

A mainstream knowledge editing method usually freezes LLM’s original parameters and adds extra trainable modules for new knowledge management, reducing interference with old knowledge. Although these approaches have achieved some success, our experiments show that, after extensive editing, the model’s knowledge understanding and memory capacity significantly degrade, particularly concerning early edited knowledge. The root cause is that subsequent edits interfere with the previously edited knowledge, and we refer to this phenomenon as knowledge coupling. To address this issue, we propose the Knowledge Decoupling Editing (KDE) method. Specifically, KDE stores the basis vectors of the representation space of past edits in a knowledge cache. It projects the gradient of the current edit onto a... | Haoyu Xu, Pengxiang Lan, Enneng Yang, Guibing Guo, Jianzhe Zhao, Linying Jiang, Xingwei Wang |  |

While previous search-based strategies address the short-sightedness of auto-regressive generation, the vast search space leads to excessive exploration and insufficient exploitation. To strike an efficient balance to derive the optimal step, we frame the decoding strategy as foresight sampling, leveraging simulated future steps to obtain globally optimal step estimation. Built on it, we propose a novel decoding strategy, named 𝜙-Decoding. To provide a precise and expressive estimation of step value, 𝜙-Decoding approximates two distributions via foresight and clustering. Sampling from the joint distribution, the optimal steps can be selected for exploitation. To support adaptive computation allocation, we propose in-width and in-depth pruning strategies, featuring a light-weight solution to achieve inference efficiency.

However, the robustness of watermark radioactivity against adversarial actors remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate whether student models can acquire the capabilities of teacher models through knowledge distillation while avoiding watermark inheritance. We propose two categories of watermark removal approaches: pre-distillation removal through untargeted and targeted training data paraphrasing (UP and TP), and post-distillation removal through inference-time watermark neutralization (WN).

However, existing benchmarks for reward models show a weak correlation with the performance of optimized policies, suggesting that they fail to accurately assess the true capabilities of RMs. To bridge this gap, we explore several evaluation designs through the lens of reward overoptimization, i.e., a phenomenon that captures both how well the reward model aligns with human preferences and the dynamics of the learning signal it provides to the policy. The results highlight three key findings on how to construct a reliable benchmark: (i) it is important to minimize differences between chosen and rejected responses beyond correctness, (ii) evaluating reward models requires multiple comparisons across a wide range of chosen and rejected responses, and (iii) given that reward models encounter responses with diverse representations, responses should... | Sunghwan Kim, Dongjin Kang, Taeyoon Kwon, Hyungjoo Chae, Dongha Lee, Jinyoung Yeo |  |

This paper proposes a novel method for inducing lexicons of in-group language, which incorporates its socio-temporal context. Existing methods for lexicon induction do not capture the evolving nature of in-group language, nor the social structure of the community. Using dynamic word and user embeddings trained on conversations from online anti-women communities, our approach outperforms prior methods for lexicon induction. We develop a test set for the task of lexicon induction and a new lexicon of manosphere language, validated by human experts, which quantifies the relevance of each term to a specific sub-community at a given point in time. Finally, we present novel insights on in-group language which illustrate the utility of this approach. | Christine de Kock |  |

However, many LM-based SE approaches primarily focus on semantic information, often neglecting the critical role of acoustic information, which leads to acoustic inconsistency after enhancement and limited generalization across diverse SE tasks. In this paper, we introduce LLaSE-G1, a LLaMA-based language model that incentivizes generalization capabilities for speech enhancement. LLaSE-G1 offers the following key contributions: First, to mitigate acoustic inconsistency, LLaSE-G1 employs continuous representations from WavLM as input and predicts speech tokens from X-Codec2, maximizing acoustic preservation. Second, to promote generalization capability, LLaSE-G1 introduces dual-channel inputs and outputs, unifying multiple SE tasks without requiring task-specific IDs. Third, LLaSE-G1... | Boyi Kang, Xinfa Zhu, Zihan Zhang, Zhen Ye, Mingshuai Liu, Ziqian Wang, Yike Zhu, Guobin Ma, Jun Chen, Longshuai Xiao, Chao Weng, Wei Xue, Lei Xie |  |

In multimodal scenarios, attention heads exhibit varying preferences for different modalities, resulting in significant disparities in modality importance across attention heads. Traditional KV cache eviction methods, which are tailored for unimodal settings, fail to capture modality-specific information, thereby yielding suboptimal performance. MadaKV addresses these challenges through two key components: modality preference adaptation and hierarchical compression compensation. By dynamically sensing modality information within attention heads and adaptively retaining critical tokens, MadaKV achieves substantial reductions in KV cache memory footprint and model inference decoding latency (1.3 to 1.5 times improvement) while maintaining high accuracy across various multimodal long-context... | Kunxi Li, Zhonghua Jiang, Zhouzhou Shen, Zhaode Wang, Chengfei Lv, Shengyu Zhang, Fan Wu, Fei Wu |  |

However, their performance is hindered by noisy reference documents, which often distract from essential information. Despite fine-tuning efforts, Transformer-based architectures struggle to prioritize relevant content. This is evidenced by their tendency to allocate disproportionate attention to irrelevant or later-positioned documents. Recent work proposes the differential attention mechanism to address this issue, but this mechanism is limited by an unsuitable common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) and high computational costs. Inspired by the operational amplifier (OpAmp), we propose the OpAmp adaptation to address these challenges, which is implemented with adapters efficiently. By integrating the adapter into pre-trained Transformer blocks, our approach enhances focus on the golden context without... | Haoyuan Wu, Rui Ming, Haisheng Zheng, Zhuolun He, Bei Yu |  |

A crucial element of these models is the discrete acoustic codecs, which serve as an intermediate representation replacing the mel-spectrogram. However, there exist several gaps between discrete codecs and downstream speech language models. Specifically, 1) Due to the reconstruction paradigm of the Codec model and the structure of residual vector quantization, the initial channel of the codebooks contains excessive information, making it challenging to directly generate acoustic tokens from weakly supervised signals such as text in downstream tasks. 2) Achieving good reconstruction performance requires the utilization of numerous codebooks, which increases the burden on downstream speech language models. Consequently, leveraging the characteristics of speech language models, we propose... | Shengpeng Ji, Minghui Fang, Jialong Zuo, Ziyue Jiang, Dingdong Wang, Hanting Wang, Hai Huang, Zhou Zhao |  |

While existing research expands LLMs access to diverse tools (e.g., program interpreters, search engines, calculators), the necessity of using these tools is often overlooked, leading to indiscriminate tool invocation. This naive approach raises two key issues: increased latency due to unnecessary tool calls, and potential errors resulting from faulty interactions with external tools. In this paper, we introduce meta-cognition as a proxy for LLMs self-assessment of their capabilities, reflecting the model’s awareness of its own limitations. Based on this, we propose MeCo, an adaptive decision-making strategy for external tool use. MeCo quantifies metacognitive scores by capturing high-level cognitive signals in the representation space, guiding when to invoke... | Wenjun Li, Dexun Li, Kuicai Dong, Cong Zhang, Hao Zhang, Weiwen Liu, Yasheng Wang, Ruiming Tang, Yong Liu |  |

However, the open-source nature of these benchmarks and the broad sources of training data for LLMs have inevitably led to benchmark contamination, resulting in unreliable evaluation. To alleviate this issue, we propose the contamination-free MCQ benchmark called MMLU-CF, which reassesses LLMs’ understanding of world knowledge by averting both unintentional and malicious data contamination. To mitigate unintentional data contamination, we source questions from a broader domain of over 200 billion webpages and apply three specifically designed decontamination rules. To prevent malicious data contamination, we divide the benchmark into validation and test sets with similar difficulty and subject distributions. The test set remains closed-source to ensure reliable results,... | Qihao Zhao, Yangyu Huang, Tengchao Lv, Lei Cui, Qinzheng Sun, Shaoguang Mao, Xin Zhang, Ying Xin, Qiufeng Yin, Scarlett Li, Furu Wei |  |

In this paper, we discover that code-switching in red-teaming queries can effectively elicit undesirable behaviors of LLMs, which are common practices in natural language. We introduce a simple yet effective framework, CSRT, to synthesize code-switching red-teaming queries and investigate the safety and multilingual understanding of LLMs comprehensively. Through extensive experiments with ten state-of-the-art LLMs and code-switching queries combining up to 10 languages, we demonstrate that the CSRT significantly outperforms existing multilingual red-teaming techniques, achieving 46.7% more attacks than standard attacks in English and being effective in conventional safety domains. We also examine the multilingual ability of those LLMs to generate and understand code-switching texts. Additionally, we validate the extensibility of the CSRT by generating code-switching attack... | Haneul Yoo, Yongjin Yang, Hwaran Lee |  |

However, access to extensive, diverse, and high-quality reasoning datasets remains a significant challenge, particularly for the open-source community. In this paper, we propose ScaleQuest, a novel, scalable, and cost-effective data synthesis method that enables the generation of large-scale mathematical reasoning datasets using lightweight 7B-scale models. ScaleQuest introduces a two-stage question-tuning process comprising Question Fine-Tuning (QFT) and Question Preference Optimization (QPO) to unlock the question generation capabilities of problem-solving models. By generating diverse questions from scratch – without relying on powerful proprietary models or seed data – we produce a dataset of 1 million problem-solution pairs.

However, previous AES models were trained on essays and scores irrelevant to the practical scenarios of EFL writing education and usually provided a single holistic score due to the lack of appropriate datasets. In this paper, we release DREsS, a large-scale, standard dataset for rubric-based automated essay scoring with 48.9K samples in total. DREsS comprises three sub-datasets: DREsS_New, DREsS_Std., and DREsS_CASE. We collect DREsS_New, a real-classroom dataset with 2.3K essays authored by EFL undergraduate students and scored by English education experts. We also standardize existing rubric-based essay scoring datasets as DREsS_Std. We suggest CASE, a corruption-based augmentation strategy for essays, which generates 40.1K synthetic samples of DREsS_CASE and improves the baseline results by 45.44%.

The core idea of dense retrieval is to align document embeddings with their corresponding query embeddings by maximizing their dot product. The current training data is quite sparse, with each document typically associated with only one or a few labeled queries. However, a single document can be retrieved by multiple different queries. Aligning a document with just one or a limited number of labeled queries results in a loss of its semantic information. In this paper, we propose a training-free Potential Query Retrieval (PQR) framework to address this issue. Specifically, we use a Gaussian mixture distribution to model all potential queries for a document, aiming to capture its comprehensive semantic information. To obtain this distribution, we introduce three sampling strategies to sample a large number of potential queries for each document and encode them into a semantic space. Using these sampled... | Junfeng Kang, Rui Li, Qi Liu, Yanjiang Chen, Zheng Zhang, Junzhe Jiang, Heng Yu, Yu Su |  |

We analyze the parameter spaces of three MLLMs to study how their representations evolve during pre-training, observing patterns consistent with compression: models initially form language-specific representations, which gradually converge into cross-lingual abstractions as training progresses. Through probing experiments, we observe a clear transition from uniform language identification capabilities across layers to more specialized layer functions. For deeper analysis, we focus on neurons that encode distinct semantic concepts. By tracing their development during pre-training, we show how they gradually align across languages. Notably, we identify specific neurons that emerge as increasingly reliable predictors for the same concepts across languages. This alignment manifests concretely in generation:... | Frederick Riemenschneider, Anette Frank |  |

However, in practical development, acquiring domain-specific knowledge often requires a significant amount of professional expert manpower. Moreover, even when domain-specific data is available, the lack of a unified methodology for benchmark dataset establishment often results in uneven data distribution. This imbalance can lead to an inaccurate assessment of the true model capabilities during the evaluation of domain-specific LLMs. To address these challenges, we introduce \*\*SDBench\*\*, a generic framework for generating evaluation datasets for domain-specific LLMs. This method is also applicable for establishing the LLM instruction datasets. It significantly reduces the reliance on expert manpower while ensuring that the collected data is uniformly distributed. To validate the effectiveness of this framework, we also present the... | Cheng Guo, Hu Kai, Shuxian Liang, Yiyang Jiang, Yi Gao, XianSheng Hua, Wei Dong |  |

However, current LLMs are limited to text-based communication, hindering their ability to interact with diverse forms of information in clinical environments. Despite clinical agents succeeding in diverse signal interaction, they are oriented to a single clinical scenario and hence fail for broader applications. To evaluate clinical agents holistically, we propose ClinicalAgent Bench (CAB), a comprehensive medical agent benchmark consisting of 18 tasks across five key realistic clinical dimensions. Building on this, we introduce ReflectTool, a novel framework that excels at utilizing domain-specific tools within two stages. The first optimization stage progressively enlarges a long-term memory by saving successful solving processes and tool-wise experience of agents in a tiny pre-defined training set.

We address this gap with Mystery-Zebra. This robust two-part benchmark (4,290 puzzles) challenges the logic abstraction abilities of LLMs in two setups: (1) a lexical obfuscation setup tests the dependence of LLMs on lexical content based on two canonical grid puzzles widely spread on the Internet; (2) a set of new grid puzzles in 42 different sizes and 12 difficulty levels tests how the formal difficulty degree of a puzzle affects LLMs.We test open and closed-weight LLMs on both parts of the benchmark. The results on part two suggest that model sizes up to 70B parameters have only a minor influence when solving newly generated puzzles, while performance mainly relates to the number of items in the puzzle. The results on the first part of the benchmark suggest that the applied obfuscation strategies... | Henrike Beyer, Chris Reed |  |

We propose ChainEdit, a framework that synergizes knowledge graph-derived logical rules with LLM logical reasoning capabilities to enable systematic chain updates. By automatically extracting logical patterns from structured knowledge bases and aligning them with LLMs’ internal logics, ChainEdit dynamically generates and edits logically connected knowledge clusters. Experiments demonstrate an improvement of more than 30% in logical generalization over baselines while preserving editing reliability and specificity. We further address evaluation biases in existing benchmarks through knowledge-aware protocols that disentangle external dependencies. This work establishes new state-of-the-art performance on ripple effect while ensuring internal logical consistency after knowledge editing. | Zilu Dong, Xiangqing Shen, Zinong Yang, Rui Xia |  |

However, it is infeasible to collect all possible instruction datasets simultaneously in real-world scenarios. Thus, enabling MLLM with continual instruction tuning is essential for maintaining their adaptability. However, existing methods often trade off memory efficiency for performance gains, significantly compromising overall efficiency. In this paper, we propose a task-specific expansion and task-general fusion framework based on the variations in Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) similarity across different model layers when trained on diverse datasets. Furthermore, we analyze the information leakage present in the existing benchmark and propose a new and more challenging benchmark to rationally evaluate the performance of different methods.

To this end, we propose a two-stage framework to learn and apply quantized codes for each entity, aiming for the seamless integration of KGs with LLMs. Firstly, a self-supervised quantized representation (SSQR) method is proposed to compress both KG structural and semantic knowledge into discrete codes (i.e., tokens) that align the format of language sentences. We further design KG instruction-following data by viewing these learned codes as features to directly input to LLMs, thereby achieving seamless integration. The experiment results demonstrate that SSQR outperforms existing unsupervised quantized methods, producing more distinguishable codes. Moreover, the fine-tuned LLaMA2 and LLaMA3.1 also have superior performance on KG link... | Qika Lin, Tianzhe Zhao, Kai He, Zhen Peng, Fangzhi Xu, Ling Huang, Jingying Ma, Mengling Feng |  |

However, there is limited mechanistic understanding of the algorithms that Transformer+CoT can learn. Our key contributions are: (1) We evaluate the state tracking capabilities of Transformer+CoT and its variants, confirming the effectiveness of CoT. (2) Next, we identify the circuit (a subset of model components, responsible for tracking the world state), indicating that late-layer MLP neurons play a key role. We propose two metrics, compression and distinction, and show that the neuron sets for each state achieve nearly 100% accuracy, providing evidence of an implicit finite state automaton (FSA) embedded within the model.

To address this issue, one straightforward solution is to introduce task-specific LoRA as domain experts, leveraging the modeling of multiple capabilities of experts and thus enhancing the general capability of multi-task learning.Although promising, these additional components often add complexity to the training and inference process, contravening the efficiency that PEFT is designed to deliver. Considering this, we introduce an innovative PEFT method, \*\*TeamLoRA\*\*, consisting of a collaboration and competition module for LoRA experts, thus achieving the right balance of effectiveness and efficiency:\*\*(i)\*\* For \*collaboration\*, we introduce a novel knowledge sharing and organization mechanism designed to optimize hierarchical learning while... | Tianwei Lin, Jiang Liu, Wenqiao Zhang, Yang Dai, Haoyuan Li, Zhelun Yu, Wanggui He, Juncheng Li, Jiannan Guo, Hao Jiang, Siliang Tang, Yueting Zhuang |  |

We hence propose CRiskEval, a Chinese dataset meticulously designed for gauging the risk proclivities inherent in LLMs such as resource acquisition and malicious coordination, as part of efforts for proactive preparedness. To curate CRiskEval, we define a new risk taxonomy with 7 types of frontier risks and 4 safety levels, including extremely hazardous,moderately hazardous, neutral and safe. We follow the philosophy of tendency evaluation to empirically measure the stated ”desire” of LLMs via fine-grained multiple-choice question answering. The dataset consists of 14,888 questions that simulate scenarios related to predefined 7 types of frontier risks.

Despite these reductions, the massive number of parameters in MoEs still makes them expensive to serve. Conventionally, unstructured or structured pruning has been considered to reduce number of parameters. Our key contribution is exploring the interpolation between structured and unstructured pruning, to propose a novel structured-then-unstructured (STUN) approach outperforming both of structured or unstructured pruning, especially for MoEs. In the first stage, we show a scalable expert pruning with O(1) forward pass, unlike existing work requiring O(kn⁄√n) forward passes for n experts that cannot scale for recent MoEs with hundreds of experts. We then show our expert-pruned MoEs are robust to unstructured pruning to follow.

Adversaries can inject malicious commands through compromised tools, manipulating LLMs to send sensitive information to these tools, which leads to potential privacy breaches. However, existing attack approaches are black-box oriented and rely on static commands that cannot adapt flexibly to the changes in user queries and the invocation chain of tools. It makes malicious commands more likely to be detected by LLM and leads to attack failure. In this paper, we propose AutoCMD, a dynamic attack comment generation approach for information theft attacks in LLM tool-learning systems. Inspired by the concept of mimicking the familiar, AutoCMD is capable of inferring the information utilized by upstream tools in the toolchain through learning on open-source systems and reinforcement with target system examples, thereby generating more targeted commands for information theft.

While recent methods utilizing consistency-based distillation aim to achieve few-step or single-step inference, their one-step performance is constrained by curved trajectories, preventing them from surpassing traditional diffusion models. In this work, we introduce FlashAudio with rectified flows to learn straight flow for fast simulation. To alleviate the inefficient timesteps allocation and suboptimal distribution of noise, FlashAudio optimizes the time distribution of rectified flow with Bifocal Samplers and proposes immiscible flow to minimize the total distance of data-noise pairs in a batch vias assignment.

Existing studies have explored the role of LLMs in combating misinformation, but there is still a lack of fine-grained analysis on the specific aspects and extent to which LLMs are influenced by misinformation. To bridge this gap, we present MisBench, the current largest and most comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs’ behavior and knowledge preference toward misinformation. MisBench consists of 10,346,712 pieces of misinformation, which uniquely considers both knowledge-based conflicts and stylistic variations in misinformation. Empirical results reveal that while LLMs demonstrate comparable abilities in discerning misinformation, they still remain susceptible to knowledge conflicts and stylistic variations. Based on these findings, we further propose a novel approach called Reconstruct to Discriminate (RtD) to strengthen... | Miao Peng, Nuo Chen, Jianheng Tang, Jia Li |  |

Recent code language models have scaled to billions of parameters, but model source code solely as text tokens while ignoring any other structural information. Conversely, models that do encode structural information of code make modifications to the Transformer architecture, limiting their scale and compatibility with pretrained LLMs. In this work, we take the best of both worlds with GALLa - Graph Aligned Large Language Models. GALLa utilizes graph neural networks and cross-modal alignment technologies to inject the structural information of code into LLMs as an auxiliary task during finetuning. This framework is both model-agnostic and task-agnostic, as it can be applied to any code LLM for any code downstream task, and requires the structural graph data only at training time from a corpus unrelated to the finetuning... | Ziyin Zhang, Hang Yu, Sage Lee, Peng Di, Jianguo Li, Rui Wang |  |

While conventional CSC focuses on character substitution errors caused by mistyping, two other common types of character errors, missing and redundant characters, have received less attention. These errors are often excluded from CSC datasets during the annotation process or ignored during evaluation, even when they have been annotated. This issue limits the practicality of the CSC task. To address this issue, we introduce the task of General Chinese Character Error Correction (C2EC), which focuses on all three types of character errors. We construct a high-quality C2EC benchmark by combining and manually verifying data from CCTC and Lemon datasets. We extend the training-free prompt-free CSC method to C2EC by using Levenshtein distance for handling length changes and leveraging an additional prompt-based large language model (LLM) to improve performance.

In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Self-Contrastive Rewarding (HSCR), a novel approach that addresses two critical challenges in Med-VLM alignment: 1) Cost-effective generation of high-quality preference data; 2) Capturing nuanced and context-aware preferences for improved alignment. HSCR first leverages the inherent capability of Med-VLMs to generate dispreferred responses with higher sampling probability. By analyzing output logit shifts after visual token dropout, we identify modality-coupled tokens that induce misalignment and derive an implicit alignment reward function. This function guides token replacement with hallucinated ones during decoding, producing high-quality dispreferred data. Furthermore, HSCR introduces a multi-level preference optimization... | Songtao Jiang, Yan Zhang, Yeying Jin, Zhihang Tang, Yangyang Wu, Yang Feng, Jian Wu, Zuozhu Liu |  |

However, their reasoning capabilities remain constrained by existing instruction-tuning datasets, which were predominately repurposed from academic datasets such as VQA, AI2D, and ChartQA. These datasets target simplistic tasks, and only provide phrase-level answers without any intermediate rationales.To address these challenges, we introduce a scalable and cost-effective method to construct a large-scale multimodal instruction-tuning dataset with rich intermediate rationales designed to elicit CoT reasoning. Using only open models, we create a dataset containing 12M instruction-response pairs to cover diverse reasoning-intensive tasks.Experiments demonstrate that training MLLMs on our dataset not only significantly improves reasoning capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as MathVerse (+8.1%), MMMU-Pro (+7%), and MuirBench (+13.3%), but... | Jiawei Guo, Tianyu Zheng, Yizhi Li, Yuelin Bai, Bo Li, Yubo Wang, King Zhu, Graham Neubig, Wenhu Chen, Xiang Yue |  |

SIFT-50M is built from publicly available speech corpora, which collectively contain 14K hours of speech, and leverages LLMs along with off-the-shelf expert models. The dataset spans five languages, encompassing a diverse range of speech understanding as well as controllable speech generation instructions. Using SIFT-50M, we train SIFT-LLM, which outperforms existing speech-text LLMs on instruction-following benchmarks while achieving competitive performance on foundational speech tasks. To support further research, we also introduce EvalSIFT, a benchmark dataset specifically designed to evaluate the instruction-following capabilities of speech-text LLMs. | Prabhat Pandey, Rupak Vignesh Swaminathan, K.

However, natural human interaction often relies on speech, highlighting the need for voice-based models. In this context, Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs)—foundation models designed to understand and generate speech—emerge as a promising solution for end-to-end speech interaction. This survey offers a comprehensive overview of recent approaches to building SpeechLMs, outlining their core architectural components, training methodologies, evaluation strategies, and the challenges and potential directions for future research in this rapidly advancing field.

Existing works mostly often focus on retrieving entire cases rather than precise, paragraph-level information. Moreover, multilingual legal practice necessitates cross-lingual retrieval, most works have been limited to monolingual settings. To address these gaps, we introduce LexCLiPR, a cross-lingual dataset for paragraph-level retrieval from European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) judgments, leveraging multilingual case law guides and distant supervision to curate our dataset. We evaluate retrieval models in a zero-shot setting, revealing the limitations of pre-trained multilingual models for cross-lingual tasks in low-resource languages and the importance of retrieval based post-training strategies. In fine-tuning settings, we observe that two-tower models excel in cross-lingual retrieval, while siamese architectures are... | Rohit Upadhya, T. Y. S. S. Santosh |  |

As a result, these attacks are less effective against practical scenarios involving black-box feedback APIs, limited queries, or multiple task types. To bridge this gap, we propose Cluster and Ensemble Mutil-task Text Adversarial Attack (CEMA), an effective black-box attack that exploits the transferability of adversarial texts across different tasks. CEMA simplifies complex multi-task scenarios by using a deep-level substitute model trained in a plug-and-play manner for text classification, enabling attacks without mimicking the victim model. This approach requires only a few queries for training, converting multi-task attacks into classification attacks and allowing attacks across various tasks. CEMA generates multiple adversarial candidates using different text classification methods and selects the one that most effectively... | Wenqiang Wang, Yan Xiao, Hao Lin, Yangshijie Zhang, Xiaochun Cao |  |

Speculative decoding has emerged as a promising solution, but existing approaches face key limitations: training-based methods require a draft model that is challenging to obtain and lacks generalizability, while training-free methods offer limited speedup gains. In this work, we present Spectra, a novel framework for accelerating LLM inference without the need for additional training or modification to the original LLM. Spectra introduces two new techniques for efficiently utilizing internal and external speculation, each outperforming corresponding state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods independently. When combined, these techniques achieve up to a 4.08x speedup across various benchmarks and LLM architectures, significantly surpassing existing training-free approaches. The implementation of Spectra is publicly available. | NguyenKhang Le, Truong Dinh Do, LeMinh Nguyen |  |

This task is challenging as different elements within a quadruple may manifest in different utterances, requiring precise handling of associations at both the utterance and word levels. However, most existing methods tackling it predominantly leverage predefined dialogue structure (e.g., reply) and word semantics, resulting in a surficial understanding of the deep sentiment association between utterances and words. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-level Association Refinement Network (MARN) designed to achieve more accurate and comprehensive sentiment associations between utterances and words. Specifically, for utterances, we dynamically capture their associations with enriched semantic features through a holistic understanding of the dialogue, aligning them more closely with sentiment associations within elements in... | Zeliang Tong, Wei Wei, Xiaoye Qu, Rikui Huang, Zhixin Chen, Xingyu Yan |  |

Existing methods based on visual features struggle to identify fraudulent document images due to the lack of visual clues on the tampering region. This paper proposes CSIAD (Cross-Sample Image Anomaly Detection) by leveraging LLMs to identify logical inconsistencies in similar images. This novel framework accurately detects forged images with slight tampering traces and explains anomaly detection results. Furthermore, we introduce CrossCred, a new benchmark of real-world fraudulent images with fine-grained manual annotations. Experiments demonstrate that CSIAD outperforms state-of-the-art image fraud detection methods by 79.6% (F1) on CrossCred and deployed industrial solutions by 21.7% (F1) on business data.

Understanding the Interaction between Attention Heads From A Game Theory Perspective](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.688/) |  | 0 | Despite the remarkable success of attention-based large language models (LLMs), the precise interaction mechanisms between attention heads remain poorly understood. In contrast to prevalent methods that focus on individual head contributions, we rigorously analyze the intricate interplay among attention heads through a novel framework based on the Harsanyi dividend, a concept from cooperative game theory. Our analysis reveals that significant positive Harsanyi dividends are sparsely distributed across head combinations, indicating that most heads do not contribute cooperatively. Moreover, certain head combinations exhibit negative dividends, indicating implicit competitive relationships. To further optimize the interactions among attention heads, we propose a training-free Game-theoretic Attention Calibration (GAC) method. Specifically, GAC selectively retains heads demonstrating significant cooperative gains and applies fine-grained distributional adjustments to the remaining heads.... | Xiaoye Qu, Zengqi Yu, Dongrui Liu, Wei Wei, Daizong Liu, Jianfeng Dong, Yu Cheng |  |

However, in the multimodal (MM) domain, there is still a lack of a strong MM-Verifier. In this paper, we introduce MM-Verifier and MM-Reasoner to enhance multimodal reasoning through longer inference and more robust verification. First, we propose a two-step MM verification data synthesis method, which combines a simulation-based tree search with verification and uses rejection sampling to generate high-quality Chain-of-Thought (COT) data. This data is then used to fine-tune the verification model, MM-Verifier. Additionally, we present a more efficient method for synthesizing MMCOT data, bridging the gap between text-based and multimodal reasoning. The synthesized data is used to fine-tune MM-Reasoner. Our MM-Verifier outperforms all larger models on the MathCheck, MathVista, and MathVerse... | Linzhuang Sun, Hao Liang, Jingxuan Wei, Bihui Yu, Tianpeng Li, Fan Yang, Zenan Zhou, Wentao Zhang |  |

This work addresses the extraction of human traveling trajectories from travelogues. Previous work treated each trajectory as a sequence of visited locations, although locations with different granularity levels, e.g., “Kyoto City” and “Kyoto Station,” should not be lined up in a sequence. In this work, we propose to represent the trajectory as a graph that can capture the hierarchy as well as the visiting order, and construct a benchmark dataset for the trajectory extraction. The experiments using this dataset show that even naive baseline systems can accurately predict visited locations and the visiting order between them, while it is more challenging to predict the hierarchical relations. | Aitaro Yamamoto, Hiroyuki Otomo, Hiroki Ouchi, Shohei Higashiyama, Hiroki Teranishi, Hiroyuki Shindo, Taro Watanabe |  |

While previous works focus on representation learning to encode ACs and AC pairs, they fail to explicitly model the underlying reasoning patterns of AM, resulting in limited interpretability. This paper proposes a novel ̲First- ̲Order ̲Logic reasoning framework for ̲AM (FOL-AM), designed to explicitly capture logical reasoning paths within argumentative texts. By interpreting multiple AM subtasks as a unified relation query task modeled using FOL rules, FOL-AM facilitates multi-hop relational reasoning and enhances interpretability. The framework supports two flexible implementations: a fine-tuned approach to leverage task-specific learning, and a prompt-based method utilizing large language models to harness their generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments on two AM benchmarks demonstrate that FOL-AM outperforms... | Yang Sun, Guanrong Chen, Hamid AlinejadRokny, Jianzhu Bao, Yuqi Huang, Bin Liang, KamFai Wong, Min Yang, Ruifeng Xu |  |

Nevertheless, for broader applications, the robustness of their temporal analysis capability needs to be thoroughly investigated yet predominantly ignored. Motivated by this, we propose a novel temporal robustness benchmark (TemRobBench), which introduces temporal inconsistency perturbations separately at the visual and textual modalities to assess the robustness of models. We evaluate 16 mainstream LMMs and find that they exhibit over-reliance on prior knowledge and textual context in adversarial environments, while ignoring the actual temporal dynamics in the video. To mitigate this issue, we design panoramic direct preference optimization (PanoDPO), which encourages LMMs to incorporate both visual and linguistic feature preferences simultaneously. Experimental results show that PanoDPO can effectively enhance the model’s robustness and reliability in temporal... | Jiafeng Liang, Shixin Jiang, Xuan Dong, Ning Wang, Zheng Chu, Hui Su, Jinlan Fu, Ming Liu, SeeKiong Ng, Bing Qin |  |

Existing query augmentation methods improve RAG’s performance in handling complex queries but face two key challenges: (1) the separation of query augmentation and encoding tasks, which hinders information sharing and introduces cumulative errors, and (2) the difficulty of selecting the optimal augmentation strategy for different scenarios. In this work, we propose UniRAG, a unified framework for query understanding in RAG. UniRAG employs a decoder-only LLM to jointly perform query augmentation and encoding, eliminating task separation. To facilitate adaptive query augmentation, we categorize existing techniques into query paraphrasing, query expansion, and query abstraction. Our model learns to select the optimal augmentation strategy based on user queries, leveraging retrieval and... | Rui Li, Liyang He, Qi Liu, Zheng Zhang, Heng Yu, Yuyang Ye, Linbo Zhu, Yu Su |  |

Moreover, current LLM agents are not designed to continually learn from past experiences during inference time, which could be crucial for them to gain these environment-specific experiences. To address this, we propose Contextual Experience Replay (CER), a training-free framework to enable efficient self-improvement for language agents in their context window. Specifically, CER accumulates and synthesizes past experiences into a dynamic memory buffer. These experiences encompass environment dynamics and common decision-making patterns, allowing the agents to retrieve and augment themselves with relevant knowledge in new tasks, enhancing their adaptability in complex environments. We evaluate CER on the challenging WebArena and VisualWebArena benchmarks. On VisualWebArena, CER surpasses... | Yitao Liu, Chenglei Si, Karthik R. Narasimhan, Shunyu Yao |  |

Visual Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong scene understanding and planning capabilities but lack the ability to generate actionable policies tailored to specific robotic embodiments. To address this, Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged, yet they face challenges in long-horizon spatial reasoning and grounded task planning. In this work, we propose the Embodied Multimodal Action Model with Grounded Chain of Thought and Look-ahead Spatial Reasoning, EMMA-X. EMMA-X leverages our constructed hierarchical embodiment dataset based on BridgeV2, containing 60,000 robot manipulation trajectories auto-annotated with grounded task reasoning and spatial guidance.

However, current argument relations remain relatively simplistic and foundational, struggling to capture the full scope of argument information. To address this limitation, we propose a systematic framework comprising 14 fine-grained relation types from the perspectives of vertical argument relations and horizontal discourse relations, thereby capturing the intricate interplay between argument components for a thorough understanding of argument structure. On this basis, we conducted extensive experiments on three tasks: argument component prediction, relation prediction, and automated essay grading. Additionally, we explored the impact of writing quality on argument component prediction and relation prediction, as well as the connections between discourse relations and argumentative features. The findings highlight the importance... | Yupei Ren, Xinyi Zhou, Ning Zhang, Shangqing Zhao, Man Lan, Xiaopeng Bai |  |

Although existing web agents are mostly equipped with visual perception, planning, and memory abilities, their reasoning process are still deviate from human cognition. In this work, we study the human thought pattern to empower agent with more human-like abilities in web navigation. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel multimodal web agent framework called WebExperT, which is designed to emulate the human planning process of “thinking fast and slow” to effectively decompose complex user instructions. Furthermore, WebExperT leverages experiential learning by reflecting from failure for continuously refining planning and decision-making outcomes. Experimental results on the Mind2Web benchmark demonstrate the superiority of WebExperT in both supervised and... | Haohao Luo, Jiayi Kuang, Wei Liu, Ying Shen, Jian Luan, Yang Deng |  |

However, existing evaluation methods often focus on single-language scenarios, overlooking the challenges and differences present in multilingual and cross-lingual contexts. To address this gap, we introduce MaXIFE: a comprehensive evaluation benchmark designed to assess instruction-following capabilities across 23 different languages with 1667 verifiable instruction tasks. MaXIFE integrates both Rule-Based Evaluation and Model-Based Evaluation, ensuring a balance of efficiency and accuracy. We applied MaXIFE to evaluate several leading commercial LLMs, establishing baseline results for future comparisons. By providing a standardized tool for multilingual instruction-following evaluation, MaXIFE aims to advance research and development in natural language processing. | Yile Liu, Ziwei Ma, Xiu Jiang, Jinglu Hu, ChangJing ChangJing, Liang Li |  |

In this work, we introduce \*\*MCLM\*\*, a multilingual math benchmark featuring competition-level problems in 55 languages. We then compare three test-time scaling methods—Outcome Reward Modeling, Process Reward Modeling, and Budget Forcing. Our findings indicate that although “thinking LLMs” have recently garnered significant attention, their performance is comparable to traditional scaling methods like best-of-N once constrained to similar levels of inference FLOPs. More importantly, all tested methods fail to generalize robustly across languages, achieving only modest gains that are smaller than those observed in English, with no improvements in variance or consistency. To foster further research, we release MCLM and MR1-1.5B (a multilingual LLM with reasoning capabilities) and our evaluation results. | Guijin Son, Jiwoo Hong, Hyunwoo Ko, James Thorne |  |

However, there is a lack of work evaluating MLLM for higher-order perception and understanding of Chinese visual content. To address this, we introduce the CII-Bench, which aims to assess MLLMs’ such capabilities for Chinese images. To ensure the authenticity of the Chinese context, images in CII-Bench are sourced from the Chinese Internet and manually reviewed, with corresponding answers also manually crafted. Additionally, CII-Bench incorporates images that represent Chinese traditional culture, such as famous Chinese traditional paintings, which can deeply reflect the model’s understanding of Chinese traditional culture. Through experiments on multiple MLLMs using CII-Bench, significant findings emerged. There is a large gap between MLLMs and humans in performance. The highest MLLM accuracy is 64.4%, while the human average is 78.2% and the peak is... | Chenhao Zhang, Xi Feng, Yuelin Bai, Xeron Du, Jinchang Hou, Kaixin Deng, Guangzeng Han, Qinrui Li, Bingli Wang, Jiaheng Liu, Xingwei Qu, Yifei Zhang, Qixuan Zhao, Yiming Liang, Ziqiang Liu, Feiteng Fang, Min Yang, Wenhao Huang, Chenghua Lin, Ge Zhang, Shiwen Ni |  |

To address these, we introduce MSumBench, which provides a multi-dimensional, multi-domain evaluation of summarization in English and Chinese. It also incorporates specialized assessment criteria for each domain and leverages a multi-agent debate system to enhance annotation quality. By evaluating eight modern summarization models, we discover distinct performance patterns across domains and languages.

Existing methods typically apply the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and inputs. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the inherent diversity of attention patterns within LLMs — the intrinsic attention clustering. To address this, we propose ClusterAttn, a training-free sparse attention method that provides an efficient prompt cache compression scheme under intrinsic attention clustering for efficient LLM inference.Our findings show that attention heads consistently focus on specific clusters of the prompt during decoding, a pattern detectable from an observation window at the prompt’s end. ClusterAttn adaptively fits these clusters utilizing a density-based attention clustering algorithm, thus compressing the KV cache of the prompt.

Most MSD researches explore the incongruity of text-image pairs as sarcasm information through consistency preference methods. However, these methods prioritize consistency over incongruity and blur incongruity information under their global feature aggregation mechanisms, leading to incongruity distortions and model misinterpretations. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a pioneering inconsistency preference method called incongruity-aware tension field network (ITFNet) for multi-modal sarcasm detection tasks. Specifically, ITFNet extracts effective text-image feature pairs in fact and sentiment perspectives. It then constructs a fact/sentiment tension field with discrepancy metrics to capture the contextual tone and polarized incongruity after the iterative learning of tension intensity, effectively highlighting incongruity information during... | Jiecheng Zhang, C.

To address this, we introduce and open-source a large-scale (10,600 samples) instruction-following (IFT) dataset, covering key institutional and cultural knowledge relevant to Kazakhstan. Our dataset enhances LLMs’ understanding of procedural, legal, and structural governance topics. We employ LLM-assisted data generation, comparing open-weight and closed-weight models for dataset construction, and select GPT-4o as the backbone. Each entity of our dataset undergoes full manual verification to ensure high quality. We also show that fine-tuning Qwen, Falcon, and Gemma on our dataset leads to consistent performance improvements in both multiple-choice and generative tasks, demonstrating the potential of LLM-assisted instruction tuning for low-resource languages. | Nurkhan Laiyk, Daniil Orel, Rituraj Joshi, Maiya Goloburda, Yuxia Wang, Preslav Nakov, Fajri Koto |  |

However, the privacy risks associated with this framework, particularly due to the potential inclusion of sensitive data in training datasets, remain unexplored. This paper identifies a novel and realistic attack surface: the privacy leakage from training data in decentralized training, and proposes activation inversion attack (AIA) for the first time. AIA first constructs a shadow dataset comprising text labels and corresponding activations using public datasets. Leveraging this dataset, an attack model can be trained to reconstruct the training data from activations in victim decentralized training. We conduct extensive experiments on various LLMs and publicly available datasets to demonstrate the susceptibility of decentralized training to AIA.

In recent active learning frameworks, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been employed not only for selection but also for generating entirely new data instances and providing more cost-effective annotations. Motivated by the increasing importance of high-quality data and efficient model training in the era of LLMs, we present a comprehensive survey on LLM-based Active Learning. We introduce an intuitive taxonomy that categorizes these techniques and discuss the transformative roles LLMs can play in the active learning loop. We further examine the impact of AL on LLM learning paradigms and its applications across various domains. Finally, we identify open challenges and propose future research directions.

However, achieving low latency and natural interactions in full-duplex dialogue systems remains a significant challenge, especially considering human conversation dynamics such as interruptions, backchannels, and overlapping speech. In this paper, we introduce a novel End-to-End GPT-based model OmniFlatten for full-duplex conversation, capable of effectively modeling the complex behaviors inherent to natural conversations with low latency. To achieve full-duplex conversation capabilities, we propose a multi-stage post-training scheme that progressively adapts a text large language model (LLM) backbone into a speech-text dialogue LLM, capable of generating text and speech in real time, without modifying the architecture of the backbone LLM. The training process comprises three stages:... | Qinglin Zhang, Luyao Cheng, Chong Deng, Qian Chen, Wen Wang, Siqi Zheng, Jiaqing Liu, Hai Yu, ChaoHong Tan, Zhihao Du, Shiliang Zhang |  |

Building on this, continual DAP has been explored to develop pre-trained models capable of incrementally incorporating different domain datasets. However, existing continual DAP methods face several limitations: (1) high computational cost and GPU memory usage during training; (2) sensitivity to incremental data order; and (3) providing a single, generalized model for all end tasks, which contradicts the essence of DAP. In this paper, we propose DoMIX, a novel approach that addresses these challenges by leveraging LoRA modules, a representative parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. Our approach enables efficient and parallel domain-adaptive pre-training that is robust to domain order and effectively utilizes accumulated knowledge to provide tailored pre-trained models for specific tasks.We also demonstrate that our method can be extended beyond the DAP... | Dohoon Kim, Donghun Kang, Taesup Moon |  |

While preference alignment methods have proven effective in general domains, acquiring high-quality preference data for pathology remains challenging due to limited expert resources and domain complexity. In this paper, we propose EAGLE (Expert-guided self-enhancement for preference Alignment in patholoGy Large vision-languagE model), a novel framework that systematically integrates medical expertise into preference alignment. EAGLE consists of three key stages: initialization through supervised fine-tuning, self-preference creation leveraging expert prompting and medical entity recognition, and iterative preference following-tuning.

CoT-ICL Lab allows fine grained control over the complexity of in-context examples by decoupling (1) the causal structure involved in chain token generation from (2) the underlying token processing functions. We train decoder-only transformers (up to 700M parameters) on these datasets and show that CoT accelerates the accuracy transition to higher values across model sizes. In particular, we find that model depth is crucial for leveraging CoT with limited in-context examples, while more examples help shallow models match deeper model performance. Additionally, limiting the diversity of token processing functions throughout training improves causal structure learning via ICL. We also interpret these transitions by analyzing transformer embeddings and attention maps. Overall, CoT-ICL Lab serves as a... | Vignesh Kothapalli, Hamed Firooz, Maziar Sanjabi |  |

While fine-tuning techniques like low-rank adaptation (LoRA) aim to address this, they can suffer from overfitting. We propose flexible low-rank adaptation (Flexora), a novel method that automatically selects the most critical layers for fine-tuning to optimize performance across diverse downstream tasks. Flexora formulates layer selection as a hyperparameter optimization problem, employs unrolled differentiation for efficient solving, and identifies the most impactful layers based on optimized hyperparameters. Extensive experiments across various pre-trained models and natural language tasks demonstrate that Flexora consistently outperforms existing baselines. We provide theoretical insights and comprehensive ablation studies to elucidate the effectiveness of Flexora. Therefore, Flexora offers a robust solution to enhance LoRA... | Chenxing Wei, Yao Shu, Ying Tiffany He, Fei Yu |  |

Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in mathematical reasoning, their performance in formal theorem proving remains constrained by the scarcity of high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data. To address this limitation, we propose a \*\*Q\*\*uality-\*\*D\*\*riven \*\*T\*\*heorem \*\*S\*\*ynthesis method (QDTSynth) in Lean4. During the statement synthesis, we enhance Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with an adaptive adjustment mechanism that dynamically optimizes the search strategy based on the synthesis of statements. In addition, we propose diversity screening and the self-assessment method to select theorems that exhibit both diversity and high quality from the initially synthetic statements, enabling the synthesis of a high-quality Lean4 theorem dataset.

To bridge this gap, we introduce Reasoning Segmentation via Visual Prompting (RSVP), a novel framework that unifies multi-step multimodal reasoning with grounded visual understanding. RSVP is a two-stage structuralized framework that integrates reasoning-driven localization with segmentation refinement. In the reasoning stage, RSVP employs multimodal chain-of-thought visual prompts to help MLLMs understand queries and infer targets, generating interpretable region proposals that enhance visual grounding. In segmentation stage, RSVP refines these proposals with a Vision-Language Segmentation Module (VLSM), seamlessly integrates textual and visual cues to produce precise segmentation masks.

Traditional rule-based metrics, such as accuracy and relaxed-accuracy, struggle with open-ended and unstructured responses. LLM-based evaluation methods offer greater flexibility but suffer from sensitivity to instructions, robustness issues, and high computational costs. To overcome these challenges, we introduce QAEval, a hybrid framework combining rule-based reliability with LLM-based adaptability. QAEval utilizes two high-quality datasets: QAExtract for short-answer extraction and QAScore for scoring model training. By integrating a Mixture of Evaluators model with Dynamic Load Balancing Optimization, QAEval enables accurate, cost-effective QA evaluation. Experimental results show it outperforms models like GPT-4o and Claude-3, achieving 92.3% accuracy with only 0.6B parameters. | Tan Yue, Rui Mao, Xuzhao Shi, Shuo Zhan, Zuhao Yang, Dongyan Zhao |  |

Existing bias mitigation strategies, such as retraining, post-hoc adjustment, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) are primarily effective for simple classification biases, such as stereotypes, but fail to adequately address prediction propensity and discriminative ability biases. In this paper, we analyze these two bias phenomena and observe their progressive accumulation from intermediate to deeper layers within LLMs. To mitigate this issue, we propose a bias-aware optimization framework that incorporates two distinct label balance constraints with a PEFT strategy targeting an intermediate layer. Our approach adjusts less than 1% of the model’s parameters while effectively curbing bias amplification in deeper layers. Extensive experiments conducted across 12 datasets and 5 LLMs demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms or matches the... | Daiying Zhao, Xinyu Yang, Hang Chen |  |

This work presents the first comprehensive study of over 60 SLMs such as Microsoft Phi and Google Gemma that are publicly accessible. Our findings show that state-of-the-art SLMs outperform 7B models in general tasks, proving their practical viability. However, SLMs’ in-context learning capabilities remain limited, and their efficiency has significant optimization potential. We identify key SLM optimization opportunities, including dynamic task-specific routing, model-hardware co-design, and vocabulary/KV cache compression. Overall, we expect the work to reveal an all-sided landscape of SLMs, benefiting the research community across algorithm, model, system, and hardware levels. | Zhenyan Lu, Xiang Li, Dongqi Cai, Rongjie Yi, Fangming Liu, Wei Liu, Jian Luan, Xiwen Zhang, Nicholas D.

To enhance user experience, base models require periodic updates. However, once updated, PEFT modules fine-tuned on previous versions often suffer substantial performance degradation on newer versions. Re-tuning these numerous modules to restore performance would incur significant computational costs. Through a comprehensive analysis of the changes that occur during base model updates, we uncover an interesting phenomenon: continual training primarily affects task-specific knowledge stored in Feed-Forward Networks (FFN), while having less impact on the task-specific pattern in the Attention mechanism. Based on these findings, we introduce Trans-PEFT, a novel approach that enhances the PEFT module by focusing on the task-specific pattern while reducing its dependence on certain knowledge in the base model.... | Naibin Gu, Peng Fu, Xiyu Liu, Ke Ma, Zheng Lin, Weiping Wang |  |

However, a comprehensive study to test the ability of VLMs to evaluate and reason over handwritten content remains absent. To address this gap, we introduce FERMAT, a benchmark designed to assess VLMs’ ability to detect, localize and correct errors in handwritten mathematical content. FERMAT spans four key error dimensions - computational, conceptual, notational, and presentation - and comprises over 2,200 handwritten math solutions derived from 609 manually curated problems from grades 7-12 with intentionally introduced perturbations. Using FERMAT we benchmark nine VLMs across three tasks: error detection, localization, and correction. Our results reveal significant shortcomings in current VLMs in reasoning over handwritten text, with Gemini-1.5-Pro achieving the highest error correction rate (77%).

Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) offers efficiency but constrains the model’s ability to learn new tasks and transfer knowledge due to its low-rank nature and reliance on explicit parameter constraints. We propose GORP ( ̲Gradient L ̲Ow ̲Rank ̲Projection) for Continual Learning, a novel training strategy that overcomes these limitations by synergistically combining full and low-rank parameters and jointly updating within a unified low-rank gradient subspace. GORP expands the optimization space while preserving efficiency and mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments on continual learning benchmarks demonstrate GORP’s superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

While calibration has been extensively studied in models trained from scratch, the impact of LLMs’ prior knowledge on calibration during fine-tuning remains understudied. Our research reveals that LLMs’ prior knowledge causes potential poor calibration due to the ubiquitous presence of known data in real-world fine-tuning, which appears harmful for calibration. Specifically, data aligned with LLMs’ prior knowledge would induce overconfidence, while new knowledge improves calibration. Our findings expose a tension: LLMs’ encyclopedic knowledge, while enabling task versatility, undermines calibration through unavoidable knowledge overlaps. To address this, we propose CogCalib, a cognition-aware framework that applies targeted learning strategies according to the model’s prior knowledge. Experiments across 7 tasks using 3 LLM families prove that... | Ziming Wang, Zeyu Shi, Haoyi Zhou, Shiqi Gao, Qingyun Sun, Jianxin Li |  |

To analyze these reports, NLP approaches can efficiently extract ESG insights at scale. However, even the most advanced NLP methods lack robustness against ESG content that is greenwashed – i.e. sustainability claims that are misleading, exaggerated, and fabricated. Accordingly, existing NLP approaches often extract insights that reflect misleading or exaggerated sustainability claims rather than objective ESG performance. To tackle this issue, we introduce A3CG - Aspect-Action Analysis with Cross-Category Generalization, as a novel dataset to improve the robustness of ESG analysis amid the prevalence of greenwashing. By explicitly linking sustainability aspects with their associated actions, A3CG facilitates a more fine-grained and transparent evaluation of sustainability claims, ensuring that insights are grounded in verifiable actions rather than vague or misleading... | Keane Ong, Rui Mao, Deeksha Varshney, Erik Cambria, Gianmarco Mengaldo |  |

While existing research primarily focuses on post-hoc alignment techniques, the underlying safety mechanisms within LVLMs remain largely unexplored. In this work , we investigate whether LVLMs inherently encode safety-relevant signals within their internal activations during inference. Our findings reveal that LVLMs exhibit distinct activation patterns when processing unsafe prompts, which can be leveraged to detect and mitigate adversarial inputs without requiring extensive fine-tuning. Building on this insight, we introduce HiddenDetect, a novel tuning-free framework that harnesses internal model activations to enhance safety. Experimental results show that HiddenDetect surpasses state-of-the-art methods in detecting jailbreak attacks against LVLMs. By utilizing intrinsic safety-aware... | Yilei Jiang, Xinyan Gao, Tianshuo Peng, Yingshui Tan, Xiaoyong Zhu, Bo Zheng, Xiangyu Yue |  |

However, this process traditionally relies on professionals who must be both legal experts and skilled translators—creating bottlenecks and impacting effective access to justice. To address this challenge, we introduce SwiLTra-Bench, a comprehensive multilingual benchmark of over 180K aligned Swiss legal translation pairs comprising laws, headnotes, and press releases across all Swiss languages along with English, designed to evaluate LLM-based translation systems. Our systematic evaluation reveals that frontier models achieve superior translation performance across all document types, while specialized translation systems excel specifically in laws but under-perform in headnotes. Through rigorous testing and human expert validation, we demonstrate that while fine-tuning open SLMs significantly improves their translation quality,... | Joel Niklaus, Jakob Merane, Luka Nenadic, Sina Ahmadi, Yingqiang Gao, Cyrill A.

In this paper, we build on this idea by extending the refinement from sentence-level to document-level translation, specifically focusing on document-to-document (Doc2Doc) translation refinement. Since sentence-to-sentence (Sent2Sent) and Doc2Doc translation address different aspects of the translation process, we propose fine-tuning LLMs for translation refinement using two intermediate translations, combining the strengths of both Sent2Sent and Doc2Doc. Additionally, recognizing that the quality of intermediate translations varies, we introduce an enhanced fine-tuning method with quality awareness that assigns lower weights to easier translations and higher weights to more difficult ones, enabling the model to focus on challenging translation cases. Experimental results across ten translation tasks with LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct and Mistral-Nemo-Instruct demonstrate the... | Yichen Dong, Xinglin Lyu, Junhui Li, Daimeng Wei, Min Zhang, Shimin Tao, Hao Yang |  |

Recent advances in mechanistic interpretability have made progress in identifying circuits, the minimal computational subgraphs responsible for a model’s behavior on specific tasks. However, most studies focus on identifying circuits for individual tasks without investigating how functionally similar circuits relate to each other. To address this gap, we study the modularity of neural networks by analyzing circuits for highly compositional subtasks within a transformer-based language model. Specifically, given a probabilistic context-free grammar, we identify and compare circuits responsible for ten modular string-edit operations. Our results indicate that functionally similar circuits exhibit both notable node overlap and cross-task faithfulness. Moreover, we... | Philipp Mondorf, Sondre Wold, Barbara Plank |  |

This paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) manage common ground in cases where they (don’t) possess knowledge, focusing on facts in the political domain where the risk of misinformation and grounding failure is high. We examine LLMs’ ability to answer direct knowledge questions and loaded questions that presuppose misinformation.We evaluate whether loaded questions lead LLMs to engage in active grounding and correct false user beliefs, in connection to their level of knowledge and their political bias.Our findings highlight significant challenges in LLMs’ ability to engage in grounding and reject false user beliefs, raising concerns about their role in mitigating misinformation in political discourse. | Clara Lachenmaier, Judith Sieker, Sina Zarrieß |  |

These errors are fatal in some specialized domains such as medicine. Existing fact-checking with grounding documents methods face two main challenges: (1) they struggle to understand complex multihop relations in long documents, often overlooking subtle factual errors; (2) most specialized methods rely on pairwise comparisons, requiring multiple model calls, leading to high resource and computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose GraphCheck, a fact-checking framework that uses extracted knowledge graphs to enhance text representation. Graph Neural Networks further process these graphs as a soft prompt, enabling LLMs to incorporate structured knowledge more effectively. Enhanced with graph-based reasoning, GraphCheck captures multihop reasoning chains that are often overlooked by existing methods, enabling precise and efficient fact-checking in a... | Yingjian Chen, Haoran Liu, Yinhong Liu, Jinxiang Xie, Rui Yang, Han Yuan, Yanran Fu, Peng Yuan Zhou, Qingyu Chen, James Caverlee, Irene Li |  |

While existing optimization methods are effective in optimizing short prompts, they struggle with longer, more complex ones, often risking information loss and being sensitive to small perturbations. To address these challenges, we propose SCULPT (Systematic Tuning of Long Prompts), a framework that treats prompt optimization as a hierarchical tree refinement problem. SCULPT represents prompts as tree structures, enabling targeted modifications while preserving contextual integrity. It employs a Critic-Actor framework that generates reflections and applies actions to refine the prompt. Evaluations demonstrate SCULPT’s effectiveness on long prompts, its robustness to adversarial perturbations, and its ability to generate high-performing prompts even without any initial human-written prompt. Compared to existing state of the art methods, SCULPT consistently improves LLM... | Shanu Kumar, Akhila Yesantarao Venkata, Shubhanshu Khandelwal, Bishal Santra, Parag Agrawal, Manish Gupta |  |

Distinct from traditional RP models that employ only several preset roles, Crab enables dynamic configuration of desired roles, thereby enhancing related flexibility and adaptability. To effectively train RP-LLMs, we curated the largest RP training dataset. The dataset provides a detailed role overview for each dialogue, including character profile, conversation scenario, and tagged topic, capturing a broad range of role-based behaviors, emotions, and interactions. We also noticed that current benchmarks lack both proper evaluation standards and methods. Thus, to validate RP-LLMs’ effectiveness, we introduced a new benchmark containing an evaluation standard, a test dataset with manual annotations, and a reward model RoleRM designed to... | Kai He, Yucheng Huang, Wenqing Wang, Delong Ran, Dongming Sheng, Junxuan Huang, Qika Lin, Jiaxing Xu, Wenqiang Liu, Mengling Feng |  |

Fundamentally, the safety of large language models is closely linked to the accuracy, comprehensiveness, and clarity of their understanding of safety knowledge, particularly in domains such as law, policy and ethics. This factuality ability is crucial in determining whether these models can be deployed and applied safely and compliantly within specific regions. To address these challenges and better evaluate the factuality ability of LLMs to answer short question, we introduce the Chinese SafetyQA benchmark. Chinese SafetyQA has several properties (i.e., Chinese, Diverse, High-quality, Static, Easy-to-evaluate, safety-related, harmless). Based on Chinese SafetyQA, we perform a comprehensive evaluation on the factuality abilities of existing LLMs and analyze how these capabilities relate to LLM abilities, e.g., RAG ability and robustness against attacks. | Yingshui Tan, Boren Zheng, Baihui Zheng, Kerui Cao, Huiyun Jing, Jincheng Wei, Jiaheng Liu, Yancheng He, Wenbo Su, Xiaoyong Zhu, Bo Zheng, Kaifu Zhang |  |

Although safety alignment datasets have been introduced to mitigate such risks through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these datasets often lack comprehensive risk coverage. Most existing datasets focus primarily on lexical diversity while neglecting other critical dimensions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel analysis framework to systematically measure the risk coverage of alignment datasets across three essential dimensions: Lexical Diversity, Malicious Intent, and Jailbreak Tactics. We further introduce TRIDENT, an automated pipeline that leverages persona-based, zero-shot LLM generation to produce diverse and comprehensive instructions spanning these dimensions. Each harmful instruction is paired with an ethically aligned response, resulting in two datasets: TRIDENT-Core, comprising 26,311... | Xiaorui Wu, Xiaofeng Mao, Fei Li, Xin Zhang, Xuanhong Li, Chong Teng, Donghong Ji, Zhuang Li |  |

However, it often suffers from an overemphasis on English performance, a phenomenon that is especially pronounced in data-constrained environments. To overcome these challenges, we propose Cross-Lingual Optimization (CLO) that efficiently transfers an English-centric LLM to a target language while preserving its English capabilities. CLO utilizes publicly available English SFT data and a translation model to enable cross-lingual transfer. We conduct experiments using five models on six languages, each possessing varying levels of resource. Our results show that CLO consistently outperforms SFT in both acquiring target language proficiency and maintaining English performance. Remarkably, in low-resource languages, CLO with only 3,200 samples surpasses SFT with 6,400 samples, demonstrating that CLO can achieve better performance with less data.

Traditional solutions utilize a single-tower or dual-tower framework to explicitly compute the score between queries and candidates, which is challenged by training cost and inference latency with large-scale data. Inspired by the remarkable performance and efficiency of generative models, we propose a generative cross-modal retrieval framework (CART) based on coarse-to-fine semantic modeling, which assigns identifiers to each candidate and treats the generating identifier as the retrieval target. Specifically, we explore an effective coarse-to-fine scheme, combining K-Means and RQ-VAE to discretize multimodal data into token sequences that support autoregressive generation. Further, considering the lack of explicit interaction between queries and candidates, we propose a feature fusion strategy to align their semantics.

MMMU-Pro rigorously assesses multimodal models’ true understanding and reasoning capabilities through a three-step process based on MMMU: (1) filtering out questions answerable by text-only models, (2) augmenting candidate options, and (3) introducing a vision-only input setting where questions are embedded within images. This setting challenges AI to truly “see” and “read” simultaneously, testing a core human cognitive skill of seamlessly integrating visual and textual information. Results show that model performance is substantially lower on MMMU-Pro than on MMMU, ranging from 16.8% to 26.9% across models. We explore the impact of OCR prompts and Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning, finding that OCR prompts have minimal effect while CoT generally improves performance.

However, most RM research is centered on English and relies heavily on synthetic resources, which leads to limited and less reliable datasets and benchmarks for Chinese. To address this gap, we introduce CheemsBench, a fully human-annotated RM evaluation benchmark within Chinese contexts, and CheemsPreference, a large-scale and diverse preference dataset annotated through human-machine collaboration to support Chinese RM training. We systematically evaluate open-source discriminative and generative RMs on CheemsBench and observe significant limitations in their ability to capture human preferences in Chinese scenarios. Additionally, based on CheemsPreference, we construct an RM that achieves state-of-the-art performance on CheemsBench, demonstrating the necessity of human supervision in RM training. Our findings reveal that scaled AI-generated data struggles to fully capture human... | Xueru Wen, Jie Lou, Zichao Li, Yaojie Lu, XingYu, Yuqiu Ji, Guohai Xu, Hongyu Lin, Ben He, Xianpei Han, Le Sun, Debing Zhang |  |

Aligned Large Language Models' Safety Mechanisms Tend to Be Anchored in The Template Region](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.738/) |  | 0 | The safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) remains vulnerable, as their initial behavior can be easily jailbroken by even relatively simple attacks. Since infilling a fixed template between the input instruction and initial model output is a common practice for existing LLMs, we hypothesize that this template is a key factor behind their vulnerabilities: LLMs’ safety-related decision-making overly relies on the aggregated information from the template region, which largely influences these models’ safety behavior. We refer to this issue as template-anchored safety alignment. In this paper, we conduct extensive experiments and verify that template-anchored safety alignment is widespread across various aligned LLMs. Our mechanistic analyses demonstrate how it leads to models’ susceptibility when encountering inference-time jailbreak attacks. Furthermore, we show that detaching safety mechanisms from the template region is promising in mitigating vulnerabilities to jailbreak... | Chak Tou Leong, Qingyu Yin, Jian Wang, Wenjie Li |  |

The textual modality, inherited from LLMs, enables instruction following and in-context learning, while the visual modality boosts downstream task performance through rich semantic content, spatial information, and grounding capabilities. These modalities work synergistically across various visual tasks. Our research reveals a persistent imbalance between these modalities, with text often dominating output generation during visual instruction tuning, regardless of using full or parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). We found that re-balancing these modalities can significantly reduce trainable parameters, inspiring further optimization of visual instruction tuning. To this end, we introduce Modality Linear Representation-Steering (MoReS), which re-balances intrinsic modalities by steering visual representations through linear transformations in the... | Jinhe Bi, Yujun Wang, Haokun Chen, Xun Xiao, Artur Hecker, Volker Tresp, Yunpu Ma |  |

However, processing a large number of passages within in-context for retrieval is computationally expensive, and handling their representations during inference further exacerbates the processing time; thus, we aim to make LCLM retrieval more efficient and potentially more effective with passage compression. Specifically, we propose a new compression approach tailored for LCLM retrieval, which is trained to maximize the retrieval performance while minimizing the length of the compressed passages. To accomplish this, we generate the synthetic data, where compressed passages are automatically created and labeled as chosen or rejected according to their retrieval success for a given... | Minju Seo, Jinheon Baek, Seongyun Lee, Sung Ju Hwang |  |

However, in knowledge graph question answering tasks (KGQA), there remains the issue of answering questions that require multi-hop reasoning. Existing methods rely on entity vector matching, but the purpose of the question is abstract and difficult to match with specific entities. As a result, it is difficult to establish reasoning paths to the purpose, which leads to information loss and redundancy. To address this issue, inspired by human reverse thinking, we propose Ontology-Guided Reverse Thinking (ORT), a novel framework that constructs reasoning paths from purposes back to conditions. ORT operates in three key phases: (1) using LLM to extract purpose labels and condition labels, (2) constructing label reasoning paths based on the KG ontology, and (3) using the label reasoning paths to guide knowledge retrieval. Experiments on the WebQSP and CWQ datasets show that ORT achieves... | Runxuan Liu, Luobei Luobei, Jiaqi Li, Baoxin Wang, Ming Liu, Dayong Wu, Shijin Wang, Bing Qin |  |

However, they often generate hallucinations due to limited medical knowledge. Incorporating external knowledge is therefore critical, which necessitates multi-source knowledge acquisition. We address this challenge by framing it as a source planning problem, which is to formulate context-appropriate queries tailored to the attributes of diverse sources. Existing approaches either overlook source planning or fail to achieve it effectively due to misalignment between the model’s expectation of the sources and their actual content. To bridge this gap, we present MedOmniKB, a repository comprising multigenre and multi-structured medical knowledge sources. Leveraging these sources, we propose the Source Planning Optimisation method, which enhances multi-source utilisation. Our approach... | Zhe Chen, Yusheng Liao, Shuyang Jiang, Pingjie Wang, Yiqiu Guo, Yanfeng Wang, Yu Wang |  |

To overcome the limitation of existing datasets, we propose an automatic data collection pipeline that allows us to collect and annotate over 210 hours of human conversation videos. From this, we construct a Multi-Modal Face-to-Face (MM-F2F) human conversation dataset, including over 1.5M words and corresponding turn-taking and backchannel annotations from approximately 20M frames. Additionally, we present an end-to-end framework that predicts the probability of turn-taking and backchannel actions from multi-modal signals. The proposed model emphasizes the interrelation between modalities and supports any combination of text, audio, and video inputs, making it adaptable to a variety of realistic scenarios. Our experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on turn-taking and backchannel... | Yuxin Lin, Yinglin Zheng, Ming Zeng, Wangzheng Shi |  |

The proposed formulation quantifies meaning counts as contextual diversity, which is based on the directions of contextualized word vectors obtained from a Language Model (LM). This formulation gives a new interpretation to the law and also enables us to examine it for a wider variety of words and corpora than previous studies have explored. In addition, this paper shows that the law becomes unobservable when the size of the LM used is small and that autoregressive LMs require much more parameters than masked LMs to be able to observe the law. | Ryo Nagata, Kumiko TanakaIshii |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce QAEdit, a new benchmark aligned with widely used question answering (QA) datasets, and WILD, a task-agnostic evaluation framework designed to better reflect real-world usage of model editing. Our single editing experiments show that current editing methods perform substantially worse than previously reported (38.5% vs. 96.8%). We demonstrate that it stems from issues in the synthetic evaluation practices of prior work. Among them, the most severe is the use of teacher forcing during testing, which leaks both content and length of the ground truth, leading to overestimated performance. Furthermore, we simulate practical deployment by sequential editing, revealing that current approaches fail drastically with only 1000 edits. This work calls for a shift in model editing research toward rigorous evaluation and the... | Wanli Yang, Fei Sun, Jiajun Tan, Xinyu Ma, Qi Cao, Dawei Yin, Huawei Shen, Xueqi Cheng |  |

Existing attribution methods associate entire sentences with source documents, which can be overwhelming for users seeking to fact-check specific claims. In contrast, existing sub-sentence attribution methods may be more precise but fail to align with users’ interests. In light of these limitations, we introduce Localized Attribution Queries (LAQuer), a new task that localizes selected spans of generated output to their corresponding source spans, allowing fine-grained and user-directed attribution. We compare two approaches for the LAQuer task, including prompting large language models (LLMs) and leveraging LLM internal representations. We then explore a modeling framework that extends existing attributed text generation methods to LAQuer. We evaluate this framework across two grounded text generation tasks: Multi-document Summarization (MDS)... | Eran Hirsch, Aviv Slobodkin, David Wan, Elias StengelEskin, Mohit Bansal, Ido Dagan |  |

However, they still struggle with complex real-world scenarios like business negotiations, which require strategic reasoning—an ability to navigate dynamic environments and align long-term goals amidst uncertainty.Existing methods for strategic reasoning face challenges in adaptability, scalability, and transferring strategies to new contexts.To address these issues, we propose explicit policy optimization (\*EPO\*) for strategic reasoning, featuring an LLM that provides strategies in open-ended action space and can be plugged into arbitrary LLM agents to motivate goal-directed behavior.To improve adaptability and policy transferability, we train the strategic reasoning model via multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL), utilizing process rewards and iterative self-play.Experiments across social and physical domains demonstrate... | Xiaoqian Liu, Ke Wang, Yongbin Li, Yuchuan Wu, Wentao Ma, Aobo Kong, Fei Huang, Jianbin Jiao, Junge Zhang |  |

However, existing methods show little improvement in performance compared to randomly chosen demonstrations, and significant performance drops when smaller LLMs (e.g., Llama 3.1-8B) are used. This indicates that these methods heavily rely on the intrinsic capabilities of hyper-scaled LLMs, rather than effectively retrieving useful demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for effectively retrieving demonstrations and generating SQL queries. We construct a Deep Contextual Schema Link Graph, which contains key information and semantic relationship between a question and its database schema items. This graph-based structure enables effective representation of Text-to-SQL samples and retrieval of useful demonstrations for in-context learning. Experimental results on the Spider benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our... | Jihyung Lee, JinSeop Lee, Jaehoon Lee, YunSeok Choi, JeeHyong Lee |  |

An image restoration model is trained on this synthetic data, using multi-directional patch extraction and fusion to process large images. Second, a ByT5 post-OCR model, fine-tuned on synthetic historical text pairs, addresses remaining OCR errors.Detailed experiments on 13,831 pages of real historical documents in English, French, and Spanish show that the PreP-OCR pipeline reduces character error rates by 63.9-70.3% compared to OCR on raw images. Our pipeline demonstrates the potential of integrating image restoration with linguistic error correction for... | Shuhao Guan, Moule Lin, Cheng Xu, Xinyi Liu, Jinman Zhao, Jiexin Fan, Qi Xu, Derek Greene |  |

By introducing external knowledge stored in knowledge graphs (KGs), existing methods use paths as the medium to represent the graph information that send into LLMs. However, paths only contain limited graph structure information and are unorganized with redundant sequentially appeared keywords, which are difficult for LLMs to digest. We aim to find a suitable medium that captures the essence of structure knowledge in KGs. Inspired by the Neural Message Passing in Graph Neural Networks, we propose Language Message Passing (LMP) that first learns a concise facts graph by iteratively aggregates neighbor entities and transforms them into semantic facts, and then we performs Topological Readout that encodes the graph structure information into multi-level lists of texts to augment LLMs. Our method serves as a brand-new innovative framework that brings a new perspective into KG-enhanced LLMs, and... | Junhong Wan, Tao Yu, Kunyu Jiang, Yao Fu, Weihao Jiang, Jiang Zhu |  |

While deep collaborative filtering approaches using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at capturing user-item relationships, their effectiveness is limited when handling sparse data or zero-shot scenarios, primarily due to constraints in ID-based embedding functions. To address these challenges, we propose a model-agnostic recommendation instruction-tuning paradigm that seamlessly integrates large language models with collaborative filtering. Our proposed Recommendation Language Model (RecLM) enhances the capture of user preference diversity through a carefully designed reinforcement learning reward function that facilitates self-augmentation of language models. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate significant advantages of our approach across various settings, and its plug-and-play compatibility with state-of-the-art recommender systems results in notable performance... | Yangqin Jiang, Yuhao Yang, Lianghao Xia, Da Luo, Kangyi Lin, Chao Huang |  |

In few-shot aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), previous efforts have explored data augmentation techniques, which prompt LLMs to generate new samples by modifying existing ones. However, these methods fail to produce adequately diverse data, impairing their effectiveness. Besides, some studies apply in-context learning for ABSA by using specific instructions and a few selected examples as prompts. Though promising, LLMs often yield labels that deviate from task requirements. To overcome these limitations, we propose DS2-ABSA, a dual-stream data synthesis framework targeted for few-shot ABSA. It leverages LLMs to synthesize data from two complementary perspectives: key-point-driven and instance-driven, which effectively generate diverse and high-quality ABSA samples in low-resource settings. Furthermore, a label refinement module is integrated to... | Hongling Xu, Yice Zhang, Qianlong Wang, Ruifeng Xu |  |

MISP-Meeting integrates information from speech, vision, and text modalities to facilitate automatic meeting transcription and summarization (AMTS). Challenging conditions in human meetings, including far-field speech recognition, audio-visual understanding, and long-term summarization, have been carefully evaluated. We benchmark state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) and large language models (LLMs) on this dataset, enhanced with multimodal cues. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating multimodal cues, such as lip movements and visual focus of attention, significantly enhances transcription accuracy, reducing the character error rate (CER) from 36.60% to 20.27% via guided source separation (GSS), fine-tuning, and audio-visual fusion. Furthermore, our summarization analysis reveals a direct correlation between ASR quality and summary coherence, underscoring... | HangChen HangChen, ChaoHan Huck Yang, JiaChen Gu, Sabato Marco Siniscalchi, Jun Du |  |

Prior works have utilized this capability to improve smaller and cheaper LMs (say, with 7B parameters). However, various practical constraints, such as copyright and legal issues, owing to lack of transparency in the pre-training data of large (often closed) models, prevent their use in commercial settings. Little focus has been given to improving the innate reasoning ability of smaller models without distilling information from larger LLMs. To address this, we propose COLLATE, a trainable framework that tunes a (small) LLM to generate those outputs from a pool of diverse rationales that selectively improves the downstream task. COLLATE enforces multiple instances of the same LLM to exhibit distinct behavior and employs them to generate rationales to obtain diverse outputs. The LLM is then tuned via preference optimization to choose the candidate rationale which... | Sohan Patnaik, Milan Aggarwal, Sumit Bhatia, Balaji Krishnamurthy |  |

To address these challenges, we propose MolRAG, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework integrating Chain-of-Thought reasoning for molecular property prediction. MolRAG operates by retrieving structurally analogous molecules as contextual references to guide stepwise knowledge reasoning through chemical structure-property relationships. This dual mechanism synergizes molecular similarity analysis with structured inference, while generating human-interpretable rationales grounded in domain knowledge. Experimental results show MolRAG outperforms pre-trained LLMs on four datasets, and even matches supervised methods, achieving performance gains of 1.1%–45.7% over direct prediction approaches, demonstrating versatile effectiveness.

Single LLMs were used initially, however, recent work suggests using multiple LLMs as judges yields improved performance. An important step in exploiting multiple judgements is the combination stage, aggregation. Existing methods in NLP either assign equal weight to all LLM judgments or are designed for specific tasks such as hallucination detection. This work focuses on aggregating predictions from multiple systems where no reference labels are available. A new method called SkillAggregation is proposed, which learns to combine estimates from LLM judges without needing additional data or ground truth. It extends the Crowdlayer aggregation method, developed for image classification, to exploit the judge estimates during inference. The approach is compared to a range of standard aggregation methods on HaluEval-Dialogue, TruthfulQA and Chatbot Arena tasks.... | Guangzhi Sun, Anmol Kagrecha, Potsawee Manakul, Philip C.

Current LLM routing methods effectively reduce overhead in single-agent scenarios by customizing LLM selection for each query, but they overlook the critical decisions regarding collaboration modes and agent roles in MAS. In response to this challenge, we first introduce the problem of Multi-Agent System Routing (MASR), which integrates all components of MAS into a unified routing framework. Toward this goal, we propose MasRouter, the first high-performing, cost-effective, and inductive MASR solution. MasRouter employs collaboration mode determination, role allocation, and LLM routing through a cascaded controller network, progressively constructing a MAS that balances effectiveness and efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MasRouter is (1) high-performing,... | Yanwei Yue, Guibin Zhang, Boyang Liu, Guancheng Wan, Kun Wang, Dawei Cheng, Yiyan Qi |  |

However, these systems often face the false negative issue, where items that a user might like are incorrectly labeled as negative during training, leading to suboptimal recommendations. Expanding the label set through data augmentation presents an intuitive solution but faces the challenge of balancing two key aspects: ensuring semantic relevance and preserving the collaborative information inherent in CRS datasets. To address these issues, we propose a novel data augmentation framework that first leverages an LLM-based semantic retriever to identify diverse and semantically relevant items, which are then filtered by a relevance scorer to remove noisy candidates. Building on this, we introduce a two-stage training strategy balancing semantic relevance and collaborative information. Extensive... | Haozhe Xu, Xiaohua Wang, Changze Lv, Xiaoqing Zheng |  |

Existing efficient evaluation methods estimate the performance of target models by testing them on a small, static coreset derived from the publicly available evaluation results of source models, which are separate from the target models. However, these approaches rely on the assumption that target models have high prediction consistency with source models, which doesn’t generalize well in practice. To fill this gap, we propose TailoredBench, a method that conducts customized evaluation tailored to each target model. Specifically, a Global-coreset is first constructed as a probe to identify the most consistent source models for each target model with an adaptive source model selection strategy. Afterwards, a scalable K-Medoids clustering algorithm is proposed to extend the Global-coreset to a tailored Native-coreset for each target model.

Integrating external knowledge resources, particularly knowledge graphs (KGs), provides a transparent and updatable foundation for more reliable reasoning. Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA), which queries and reasons over KGs, is central to this effort, especially for complex, multi-hop queries. However, multi-hop reasoning poses two key challenges: (1) maintaining coherent reasoning paths, and (2) avoiding prematurely discarding critical multi-hop connections. To address these issues, we introduce iQUEST, a question-guided KBQA framework that iteratively decomposes complex queries into simpler sub-questions, ensuring a structured and focused reasoning trajectory. Additionally, we integrate a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to look ahead and incorporate 2-hop neighbor information at each reasoning step. This dual approach... | Shuai Wang, Yinan Yu |  |

However, selecting the optimal LLM to respond to a user query often necessitates a delicate balance between performance and cost. While powerful models deliver better results, they come at a high cost, whereas smaller models are more cost-effective but less capable. To address this trade-off, we propose IRT-Router, a multi-LLM routing framework that efficiently routes user queries to the most suitable LLM. Inspired by Item Response Theory (IRT), a psychological measurement methodology, IRT-Router explicitly models the relationship between LLM capabilities and user query attributes. This not only enables accurate prediction of response performance but also provides interpretable insights, such as LLM abilities and query difficulty. Additionally, we design an online query warm-up technique based on semantic similarity, further enhancing the online generalization... | Wei Song, Zhenya Huang, Cheng Cheng, Weibo Gao, Bihan Xu, Guanhao Zhao, Fei Wang, Runze Wu |  |

However, effectively fine-tuning LLMs for MT is challenging due to parameter interference, which arises from the conflicting demands of different language pairs and the risk of overwriting pre-trained knowledge. To address this issue, we propose MLAS-LoRA, a novel multiple language-aware LoRA knowledge transfer framework. MLAS-LoRA efficiently adapts LLMs to MT by selectively transferring knowledge from a large teacher to a small student model. Our approach first evaluates the awareness of neurons and extracts linguistic knowledge in the teacher model to both the general MT task and specific language pairs.We then propose a multiple language-specific LoRA architecture to inject the extracted knowledge into the student model. During fine-tuning, only the parameters of the relevant language-general and... | Tianyu Dong, Bo Li, Jinsong Liu, Shaolin Zhu, Deyi Xiong |  |

However, existing repository-level code completion benchmarks usually focus on a limited number of languages (<5), which cannot evaluate the general code intelligence abilities across different languages for existing code Large Language Models (LLMs). Besides, the existing benchmarks usually report overall average scores of different languages, where the fine-grained abilities in different completion scenarios are ignored. Therefore, to facilitate the research of code LLMs in multilingual scenarios, we propose a massively multilingual repository-level code completion benchmark covering 18 programming languages (called M2RC-EVAL), and two types of fine-grained annotations (i.e., bucket-level and semantic-level) on different completion scenarios are provided, where we obtain these annotations based on the parsed abstract syntax tree.

Dual Encoders address this by embedding mentions and label candidates in a shared embedding space and applying a similarity metric to predict the correct label. In this work, we focus on evaluating key design decisions for Dual Encoder-based ED, such as its loss function, similarity metric, label verbalization format, and negative sampling strategy. We present the resulting model VerbalizED, a document-level Dual Encoder model that includes contextual label verbalizations and efficient hard negative sampling. Additionally, we explore an iterative prediction variant that aims to improve the disambiguation of challenging data points. To support our analysis, we first conduct comprehensive ablation experiments on specific design decisions using AIDA-Yago, followed by large-scale, multi-domain evaluation on the ZELDA benchmark. | Susanna Rücker, Alan Akbik |  |

A Study of Argument Relevance in Comparative Question Answering](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.765/) |  | 0 | Comparative Question Answering (CQA) lies at the intersection of Question Answering, Argument Mining, and Summarization. It poses unique challenges due to the inherently subjective nature of many questions and the need to integrate diverse perspectives. Although the CQA task can be addressed using recently emerged instruction-following Large Language Models (LLMs), challenges such as hallucinations in their outputs and the lack of transparent argument provenance remain significant limitations.To address these challenges, we construct a manually curated dataset comprising arguments annotated with their relevance. These arguments are further used to answer comparative questions, enabling precise traceability and faithfulness. Furthermore, we define explicit criteria for an “ideal” comparison and introduce a benchmark for evaluating the outputs of various Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models with respect to argument relevance.

Existing methods either lack fine-grained control, require extensive computation, or introduce significant latency. We propose Style Arithmetic (SA), a novel parameter-space approach that first extracts style-specific representations by analyzing parameter differences between models trained on contrasting styles, then incorporates these representations into a base model with precise control over style intensity. Our experiments show that SA achieves three key capabilities: controllability for precise adjustment of styles, transferability for effective style transfer across tasks, and composability for simultaneous control of multiple style dimensions. Compared to alternative methods, SA offers superior effectiveness while achieving optimal computational efficiency. Our approach opens new possibilities for flexible and efficient style control in... | Weiqi Wang, Wengang Zhou, Zongmeng Zhang, Jie Zhao, Houqiang Li |  |

Our approach applies mask matrix to the activations for each expert, constrained by L0 regularization to minimize the number of activated parameters. Starting with all parameters active, the model is progressively sparsified during training, ensuring minimal performance loss. This approach proves more efficient than one-shot sparsification techniques, which typically require significant resources for performance recovery. Moreover, our approach automatically identifies shared, token-specific, and inactive experts, allowing for more efficient allocation of computational resources. Through extensive experiments, we achieve up to 97% performance retention on downstream tasks with only 50% of the feed-forward parameters activated in dense models. Beyond enhancing inference efficiency, this strategy of sharing computational units among... | Peiyu Liu, Tianwen Wei, Bo Zhu, Xin Zhao, Shuicheng Yan |  |

However, it is unclear how well these models perform on tasks that require a combination of these skills. In this paper, we curate a novel program synthesis benchmark based on the real-world tasks in the XLogoOnline visual programming environment. Each task requires a combination of different skills such as spatial planning, basic programming, and logical reasoning. Our evaluation shows that current state-of-the-art models like GPT-4V and Llama3-70B struggle to solve these tasks, achieving only 20% and 2.35% success rates, respectively. Next, we develop a fine-tuning pipeline to boost the performance of models by leveraging a large-scale synthetic training dataset with over 80,000 tasks. Moreover, we showcase how emulator-driven feedback can be used to design a curriculum over... | Chao Wen, Jacqueline Staub, Adish Singla |  |

To address this, we propose Debate-Augmented RAG (DRAG), a training-free framework that integrates Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) mechanisms into both retrieval and generation stages. In retrieval, DRAG employs structured debates among proponents, opponents, and judges to refine retrieval quality and ensure factual reliability. In generation, DRAG introduces asymmetric information roles and adversarial debates, enhancing reasoning robustness and mitigating factual inconsistencies. Evaluations across multiple tasks demonstrate that DRAG improves retrieval reliability, reduces RAG-induced hallucinations, and significantly enhances overall factual accuracy.

However, existing training methods like supervised fine-tuning face key limitations: they do not effectively teach models to prioritize correct over incorrect solutions in ambiguous situations, nor do they effectively optimize the runtime efficiency of the generated code. To address these challenges, we propose CodeDPO, a framework that integrates preference learning into code generation to improve two key code preference factors: code correctness and efficiency. CodeDPO employs a novel dataset construction method, utilizing a self-generation-and-validation mechanism that simultaneously generates and evaluates code and test cases. The underlying assumption is that test cases executable by multiple code snippets provide more reliable validation, and code that passes more tests is more likely to be correct. Through this self-validation process, our PageRank-inspired algorithm iteratively updates the ranking... | Kechi Zhang, Ge Li, Yihong Dong, Jingjing Xu, Jun Zhang, Jing Su, Yongfei Liu, Zhi Jin |  |

We design a scalable human evaluation protocol and a corresponding automated approximation that reflect practitioners’ real-world usage of models. Annotators—or an LLM-based proxy—review text items assigned to a topic or cluster, infer a category for the group, then apply that category to other documents. Using this protocol, we collect extensive crowdworker annotations of outputs from a diverse set of topic models on two datasets. We then use these annotations to validate automated proxies, finding that the best LLM proxy is statistically indistinguishable from a human annotator and can therefore serve as a reasonable substitute in automated evaluations. | Alexander Miserlis Hoyle, Lorena CalvoBartolomé, Jordan Lee BoydGraber, Philip Resnik |  |

Prior efforts focus on agent societies created from scratch, assigning agents with newly defined personas. However, simulating established fictional worlds and characters remain largely underexplored, despite its significant practical value. In this paper, we introduce BookWorld, a comprehensive system for constructing and simulating book-based multi-agent societies. BookWorld’s design covers comprehensive real-world intricacies, including diverse and dynamic characters, fictional worldviews, geographical constraints and changes, e.t.c. BookWorld enables diverse applications including story generation, interactive games and social simulation, offering novel ways to extend and explore beloved fictional works. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that BookWorld generates creative, high-quality stories while maintaining fidelity to the source books, surpassing previous... | Yiting Ran, Xintao Wang, Tian Qiu, Jiaqing Liang, Yanghua Xiao, Deqing Yang |  |

While existing methods using embeddings from a diachronic corpus pair estimate the degree of change for target words, they offer limited insight into changes at the level of individual usage instances. To address this, we apply Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) to sets of contextualized word embeddings, capturing semantic change through the excess and deficit in the alignment between usage instances. In particular, we propose Sense Usage Shift (SUS), a measure that quantifies changes in the usage frequency of a word sense at each usage instance. By leveraging SUS, we demonstrate that several challenges in semantic change detection can be addressed in a unified manner, including quantifying instance-level semantic change and word-level tasks such as measuring the magnitude of semantic change and the broadening or narrowing of meaning. | Ryo Kishino, Hiroaki Yamagiwa, Ryo Nagata, Sho Yokoi, Hidetoshi Shimodaira |  |

However, existing reward models primarily focus on human preferences, neglecting verifiable correctness signals which have shown strong potential in training LLMs. In this paper, we propose agentic reward modeling, a reward system that combines reward models with verifiable correctness signals from different aspects to provide reliable rewards. We empirically implement a reward agent, named RewardAgent, that combines human preference rewards with two verifiable signals: factuality and instruction following, to provide more reliable rewards. We conduct comprehensive experiments on existing reward model benchmarks and inference-time best-of-n searches on real-world downstream tasks. RewardAgent significantly outperforms vanilla reward models, demonstrating its effectiveness. We further construct training preference pairs using RewardAgent and train an LLM with the DPO... | Hao Peng, Yunjia Qi, Xiaozhi Wang, Zijun Yao, Bin Xu, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li |  |

As their primary interface, multi-model query languages (MMQLs) often exhibit complex grammars, highlighting the need for effective Text-to-MMQL translation methods. Despite advances in natural language translation, no effective solutions for Text-to-MMQL exist. To address this gap, we formally define the Text-to-MMQL task and present the first Text-to-MMQL dataset involving three representative MMQLs. We propose an adaptive Text-to-MMQL framework that includes both a schema embedding module for capturing multi-model schema information and an MMQL representation strategy to generate concise intermediate query formats with error correction in generated queries. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves over a 9% accuracy improvement over our adapted baseline methods. | Gengyuan Shi, Chaokun Wang, Yabin Liu, Jiawei Ren |  |

Designed with these constraints in mind, Knowledge Editing (KE) approaches propose to alter specific facts in pretrained models. However, they have been shown to suffer from several limitations, including their lack of contextual robustness and their failure to generalize to logical implications related to the fact. To overcome these issues, we propose SAKE, a steering activation method that models a fact to be edited as a distribution rather than a single prompt. Leveraging Optimal Transport, SAKE alters the LLM behavior over a whole fact-related distribution, defined as paraphrases and logical implications. Several numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this method: SAKE is thus able to perform more robust edits than its existing counterparts. | Marco Scialanga, Thibault Laugel, Vincent Grari, Marcin Detyniecki |  |

However, effective cross-lingual transfer is hindered by LLM performance gaps across languages and the scarcity of fine-tuning data in many languages. Through analysis of LLM internal representations from over 1,000+ language pairs, we discover that middle layers exhibit the strongest potential for cross-lingual alignment. Building on this finding, we propose a middle-layer alignment objective integrated into task-specific training. Our experiments on slot filling, machine translation, and structured text generation show consistent improvements in cross-lingual transfer, especially to lower-resource languages. The method is robust to the choice of alignment languages and generalizes to languages unseen during alignment. Furthermore, we show that separately trained alignment modules can... | Danni Liu, Jan Niehues |  |

Given two alternative model responses to the same input, a human or AI annotator selects the “better” response. This approach can provide feedback for domains where other hard-coded metrics are difficult to obtain (e.g., chat response quality), thereby helping model evaluation or training. However, for some domains high-quality pairwise comparisons can be tricky to obtain - from AI and humans. For example, for responses with many factual statements, annotators may disproportionately weigh writing quality rather than underlying facts. In this work, we explore augmenting standard AI annotator systems with additional tools to improve performance on three challenging response domains: long-form factual, math and code tasks. We propose a tool-using agentic system to provide higher quality feedback on these domains. Our system uses web-search and code execution to... | Arduin Findeis, Floris Weers, Guoli Yin, Ke Ye, Ruoming Pang, Tom Gunter |  |

Knowledge editing offers an efficient alternative to retraining, enabling targeted modifications by updating specific model parameters. However, existing methods primarily focus on individual models, posing challenges in efficiently updating multiple models and adapting to new models. To address this, we propose OnceEdit, a novel ensemble-based approach that employs a plug-in model as the editing module, enabling stable knowledge updates across multiple models. Building on the model ensemble, OnceEdit introduces two key mechanisms to enhance its effectiveness. First, we introduce a dynamic weight mechanism through a weight token for distinguishing between edit-related and non-edit-related instances, ensuring the appropriate utilization of knowledge from integrated models. Second, we incorporate an ensemble enhancement mechanism to mitigate the excessive... | Weitao Ma, Xiyuan Du, Xiaocheng Feng, Lei Huang, Yichong Huang, Huiyi Zhang, Xiaoliang Yang, Baohang Li, Xiachong Feng, Ting Liu, Bing Qin |  |

While existing research primarily focuses on improving their accuracy, the efficiency remains underexplored. Given the real-time demands of many applications and the high inference overhead of VLMs, efficiency robustness is a critical issue. However, previous studies evaluate efficiency robustness under unrealistic assumptions, requiring access to the model architecture and parameters—an impractical scenario in ML-as-a-service settings, where VLMs are deployed via inference APIs. To address this gap, we propose VLMInferSlow, a novel approach for evaluating VLM efficiency robustness in a realistic black-box setting. VLMInferSlow incorporates fine-grained efficiency modeling tailored to VLM inference and leverages zero-order optimization to search for adversarial examples. Experimental results show that VLMInferSlow generates adversarial images with imperceptible perturbations, increasing the... | Xiasi Wang, Tianliang Yao, Simin Chen, Runqi Wang, Lei Ye, Kuofeng Gao, Yi Huang, Yuan Yao |  |

LLM annotations are widely used, not only in NLP research but also in fields like medicine, psychology, and social science. Despite their role in shaping study results and insights, there is no standard or rigorous procedure to determine whether LLMs can replace human annotators. In this paper, we propose a novel statistical procedure, the Alternative Annotator Test (alt-test), that requires only a modest subset of annotated examples to justify using LLM annotations. Additionally, we introduce a versatile and interpretable measure for comparing LLM annotators and judges. To demonstrate our procedure, we curated a diverse collection of ten datasets, consisting of language and vision-language tasks, and conducted experiments with six LLMs and four prompting techniques. Our results show that LLMs can sometimes... | Nitay Calderon, Roi Reichart, Rotem Dror |  |

This mapping is based on a simple and effective strategy that allows for temporal and location alignment even in the absence of location mention in the text. A set of multimodal experiments have been conducted relying on transformers and LLMs to improve overall performances while ensuring model generalizability. Our results show that modality fusion outperforms text-only models. | Romain Meunier, Farah Benamara, Véronique Moriceau, Zhongzheng Qiao, Savitha Ramasamy |  |

To address this problem, weak-to-strong generalization aims to elicit the capabilities of strong models through weak supervisors and ensure that the behavior of strong models aligns with the intentions of weak supervisors without unsafe behaviors such as deception. Although weak-to-strong generalization exhibiting certain generalization capabilities, strong models exhibit significant overfitting in weak-to-strong generalization: Due to the strong fit ability of strong models, erroneous labels from weak supervisors may lead to overfitting in strong models. In addition, simply filtering out incorrect labels may lead to a degeneration in question quality, resulting in a weak generalization ability of strong models on hard questions. To mitigate overfitting in weak-to-strong generalization, we propose a two-stage framework that simultaneously improves the... | Junhao Shi, Qinyuan Cheng, Zhaoye Fei, Yining Zheng, Qipeng Guo, Xipeng Qiu |  |

Nevertheless, LLMs struggle to reason with complex and implicit commonsense knowledge that is derived from simple ones (such as understanding the long-term effects of certain events), an aspect humans tend to focus on more. Existing works focus on complex tasks like math and code, while complex commonsense reasoning remains underexplored due to its uncertainty and lack of structure. To fill this gap and align with real-world concerns, we propose a benchmark Com2 focusing on complex commonsense reasoning. We first incorporate causal event graphs to serve as structured complex commonsense. Then we adopt causal theory (e.g., intervention) to modify the causal event graphs and obtain different scenarios that meet human concerns. Finally, an LLM is employed to synthesize examples with slow... | Kai Xiong, Xiao Ding, Yixin Cao, Yuxiong Yan, Li Du, Yufei Zhang, Jinglong Gao, Jiaqian Liu, Bing Qin, Ting Liu |  |

Nevertheless, with the advent of neural networks, lexicalized structures have generally been neglected in favor of unlexicalized, span-based methods. In this paper, we revisit lexicalized parsing and propose a novel latent lexicalization framework that dynamically infers lexical heads during training without relying on predefined head-finding rules. Our method enables the model to learn lexical dependencies directly from data, offering greater adaptability across languages and datasets. Experiments on multiple treebanks demonstrate state-of-the-art or comparable performance. We also analyze the learned dependency structures, headword preferences, and linguistic biases. | Yang Hou, Zhenghua Li |  |

Current studies personalize emotion analysis by focusing on the author but neglect the impact of the intended reader on implicit emotional feedback. In this paper, we introduce Personalized IEA (PIEA) and present the RAPPIE model, which addresses subjective variability by incorporating reader feedback. In particular, (1) we create reader agents based on large language models to simulate reader feedback, overcoming the issue of “spiral of silence effect” and data incompleteness of real reader reaction. (2) We develop a role-aware multi-view graph learning to model the emotion interactive propagation process in scenarios with sparse reader information. (3) We construct two new PIEA datasets covering English and Chinese social media with detailed user metadata, addressing the text-centric limitation of existing datasets.

Previous studies often neglect the critical aspect of utilizing knowledge from various sources. To address this gap, we introduce EvolveBench, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates temporal competence along five key dimensions: Cognition, which examines the ability to recall and contextualize historical facts. Awareness, which tests LLMs’ awareness of temporal misalignment between external inputs and the temporal context of a query. Trustworthiness, which assesses whether models can identify and appropriately refuse queries based on invalid timestamps. Understanding, which focuses on interpreting both explicit dates and implicit historical markers. Finally, reasoning evaluates the capacity to analyze temporal relationships and draw accurate inferences.

Since (Petroni et al., 2019), analyzing this knowledge has gained attention. However, most approaches investigate one question at a time via modest-sized pre-defined samples, introducing an “availability bias” (Tverski and Kahnemann, 1973) that prevents the analysis of knowledge (or beliefs) of LLMs beyond the experimenter’s predisposition.To address this challenge, we propose a novel methodology to comprehensively materialize an LLM’s factual knowledge through recursive querying and result consolidation. Our approach is a milestone for LLM research, for the first time providing constructive insights into the scope and structure of LLM knowledge (or beliefs).As a prototype, we extract a knowledge base (KB) comprising 101 million relational triples for over 2.9 million entities from... | Yujia Hu, TuanPhong Nguyen, Shrestha Ghosh, Simon Razniewski |  |

Most prior work focuses on preserving the source’s prosody, while fine-grained timbre information may leak through prosody, and transferring target prosody to synthesized speech is rarely studied. In light of this, we propose R-VC, a rhythm-controllable and efficient zero-shot voice conversion model. R-VC employs data perturbation techniques and discretize source speech into Hubert content tokens, eliminating much content-irrelevant information. By leveraging a Mask Generative Transformer for in-context duration modeling, our model adapts the linguistic content duration to the desired target speaking style, facilitating the transfer of the target speaker’s rhythm. Furthermore, R-VC introduces a powerful Diffusion Transformer (DiT) with shortcut flow matching during training, conditioning the network not only on the current noise level but also on... | Jialong Zuo, Shengpeng Ji, Minghui Fang, Mingze Li, Ziyue Jiang, Xize Cheng, Xiaoda Yang, Feiyang Chen, Xinyu Duan, Zhou Zhao |  |

Specifically, LMs assign significantly higher logits (or probabilities) to any tokens that have previously appeared in the context prompt, even for random tokens. This suggests that contextual entrainment is a mechanistic phenomenon, occurring independently of the relevance or semantic relation of the tokens to the question or the rest of the sentence. We find statistically significant evidence that the magnitude of contextual entrainment is influenced by semantic factors. Counterfactual prompts have a greater effect compared to factual ones, suggesting that while contextual entrainment is a mechanistic phenomenon, it is modulated by semantic factors.We hypothesise that there is a circuit of attention heads — the \*entrainment heads\*... | Jingcheng Niu, Xingdi Yuan, Tong Wang, Hamidreza Saghir, Amir H.

Existing approaches rely on manually designed heuristics, the perplexity of existing models, training classifiers, orcareful prompt engineering, which require significant expert experience and human annotation effort while introduce biases. We introduce CritiQ, a novel data selection method that automatically mines criteria from human preferences for data quality with only ~30 human-annotated pairs and performs efficient data selection. The main component, CritiQ Flow, employs a manager agent to evolve quality criteria and worker agents to make pairwise judgments. We build a knowledge base that extracts quality criteria from previous work to boost CritiQ Flow. Compared to perplexity- and classifier-based methods, verbal criteria are more interpretable and have greater reusable value. After deriving the criteria, we train the CritiQ Scorer to give quality scores and perform efficient data selection.

While prior work has shown the effectiveness of MBR decoding through empirical evaluation, few studies have analytically investigated why the method is effective. As a result of our analysis, we show that, given the size n of the reference hypothesis set used in computation, MBR decoding approaches the optimal solution with high probability at a rate of 𝒪(n-1⁄2), under certain assumptions, even though the language space 𝒴 is significantly larger \|𝒴\| ≫ n.This result helps to theoretically explain the strong performance observed in several prior empirical studies on MBR decoding. In addition, we provide the performance gap for maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) decoding and compare it to MBR decoding. The result of this paper indicates that MBR decoding tends to converge to the optimal solution faster than MAP decoding in several cases. | Yuki Ichihara, Yuu Jinnai, Kaito Ariu, Tetsuro Morimura, Eiji Uchibe |  |

This shift reduces the efficacy of the RM, which in turn negatively impacts the performance of the policy model (PM). To address this challenge, we propose Mutual-Taught, a self-training method that iteratively improves both the PM and RM without requiring additional human annotation. Our approach mirrors the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. In the E-step, the PM is updated using feedback from the current RM, guiding the PM toward a better approximation of the latent optimal preference distribution.In the M-step, we update the RM by constructing training data from the outputs of the PM before and after the E-step update. This process ensures that the RM adapts to the evolving policy distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that this iterative approach leads to consistent improvements in... | Tianyuan Shi, Canbin Huang, Fanqi Wan, Longguang Zhong, Ziyi Yang, Weizhou Shen, Xiaojun Quan, Ming Yan |  |

However, these capabilities often fail to effectively extend to low-resource languages, particularly those utilizing non-Latin scripts. While transliterating low-resource languages into Latin script presents a natural solution, there currently lacks a comprehensive framework for integrating transliteration into LLMs training and deployment. Taking a pragmatic approach, this paper innovatively combines character transliteration with Huffman coding to design a complete transliteration framework. Our proposed framework offers the following advantages: 1) Compression: Reduces storage requirements for low-resource language content, achieving up to 50% reduction in file size and 50-80% reduction in token count. 2) Accuracy: Guarantees 100% lossless conversion from transliterated text back to the source language. 3) Efficiency:... | Wenhao Zhuang, Yuan Sun, Xiaobing Zhao |  |

While various bias evaluation methods have been proposed, these assessments show unexpected instability when input texts undergo minor stylistic changes. This paper conducts a comprehensive analysis of how different style transformations impact bias evaluation results across multiple language models and bias types using causal inference techniques. Our findings reveal that formality transformations significantly affect bias scores, with informal style showing substantial bias reductions (up to 8.33% in LLaMA-2-13B). We identify appearance bias, sexual orientation bias, and religious bias as most susceptible to style changes, with variations exceeding 20%. Larger models demonstrate greater sensitivity to stylistic variations, with bias measurements fluctuating up to 3.1% more than in smaller models. These results highlight critical limitations in current... | Jiaxu Zhao, Meng Fang, Kun Zhang, Mykola Pechenizkiy |  |

In order to understand and later reproduce this dynamic and complex task automatically, we need specialized datasets and tools for analysis, monitoring, and evaluation, such as parallel speech corpora, and tools for their automatic annotation. Existing parallel corpora of translated texts and associated alignment algorithms hardly fill this gap, as they fail to model long-range interactions between speech segments or specific types of divergences (e.g. shortening, simplification, functional generalization) between the original and interpreted speeches. In this work, we develop and explore MockConf, a student interpretation dataset that was collected from Mock Conferences run as part of the students’ curriculum. This dataset contains 7 hours of recordings in 5 European languages, transcribed and aligned at the level of spans and words. We... | Dávid Javorský, Ondrej Bojar, François Yvon |  |

Cross-lingual KE, which requires knowledge edited in one language to generalize across diverse languages while preserving unrelated knowledge, remains underexplored. To address this, we systematically evaluate IKE under zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot setups, including tailored metric-specific demonstrations. Our findings reveal that model scale and demonstration alignment critically govern cross-lingual editing efficacy, with larger models and tailored demonstrations significantly improving performance. Linguistic properties, particularly script type, strongly influence outcomes, with non-Latin languages underperforming due to issues like language confusion. | Ercong Nie, Bo Shao, Mingyang Wang, Zifeng Ding, Helmut Schmid, Hinrich Schütze |  |

A Systematic Study of Long Story Evaluation](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.799/) |  | 0 | In this work, we conduct systematic research in a challenging area: the automatic evaluation of book-length stories (>100K tokens). Our study focuses on two key questions: (1) understanding which evaluation aspects matter most to readers, and (2) exploring effective methods for evaluating lengthy stories. We introduce the first large-scale benchmark, \*\*LongStoryEval\*\*, comprising 600 newly published books with an average length of 121K tokens (maximum 397K). Each book includes its average rating and multiple reader reviews, presented as critiques organized by evaluation aspects. By analyzing all user-mentioned aspects, we propose an \*evaluation criteria structure\* and conduct experiments to identify the most significant aspects among the 8 top-level criteria. For evaluation methods, we compare the effectiveness of three types: \*aggregation-based\*, \*incremental-updated\*, and \*summary-based\* evaluations. Our findings reveal that aggregation- and summary-based evaluations... | Dingyi Yang, Qin Jin |  |

Recent advances in parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have highlighted the effectiveness of adapting population-level LLMs to personalized LLMs by fine-tuning user-specific parameters with user history. However, user data is typically sparse, making it challenging to adapt LLMs to specific user patterns. To address this challenge, we propose PROgressive PERsonalization (PROPER), a novel progressive learning framework inspired by meso-level theory in social science. PROPER bridges population-level and user-level models by grouping users based on preferences and adapting LLMs in stages. It combines a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure with Low Ranked Adaptation (LoRA), using a user-aware router to assign users to appropriate groups automatically. Additionally, a LoRA-aware router is proposed to facilitate the integration of individual user LoRAs with the group-level LoRA. Experimental... | Linhai Zhang, Jialong Wu, Deyu Zhou, Yulan He |  |

Our approach consists of four key contributions. First, we investigate the role of dynamic clustering and the integration of various ME references, including event attributions extracted by language models (LMs), in enhancing event-centric clustering. Second, we propose a data-sharpening framework that optimizes the balance between information volume and entropy in input texts, thereby optimizing generated summaries on multiple indicators. Third, we fine-tune LMs with local news articles for cross-lingual temporal question-answering and text summarization, achieving notable improvements in capturing localized contexts. Lastly, we present the first cross-lingual dataset and comprehensive evaluation metrics tailored for the event-centric news cluster summarization pipeline. Our findings enhance the understanding of news... | Longyin Zhang, Bowei Zou, AiTi Aw |  |

Prior work on estimating model confidence tends to focus on the overall response for training and calibration, but fails to assess confidence in each reasoning step, leading to undesirable hallucination snowballing. In this work, we present MMBoundary, a novel framework that advances the knowledge boundary awareness of MLLMs through reasoning step confidence calibration. To achieve this, we propose to incorporate complementary textual and cross-modal self-rewarding signals to estimate confidence at each step of the MLLM reasoning process. In addition to supervised fine-tuning MLLM on this set of self-rewarding confidence estimation signal for initial confidence expression warm-up, we introduce a... | Zhitao He, Sandeep Polisetty, Zhiyuan Fan, Yuchen Huang, Shujin Wu, Yi R.

However, existing benchmarks seldom focus on instruction-following in long-context scenarios or stability on different inputs. To bridge this gap, we introduce LIFBench, a scalable dataset designed to evaluate LLMs’ instruction-following capabilities and stability across long contexts. LIFBench comprises three long-context scenarios and eleven diverse tasks, featuring 2,766 instructions generated through an automated expansion method across three dimensions: length, expression, and variables. For evaluation, we propose LIFEval, a rubric-based assessment method that enables precise, automated scoring of complex LLM responses without reliance on LLM-assisted assessments or human judgment. This method allows for a comprehensive analysis of model performance and stability from multiple perspectives.... | Xiaodong Wu, Minhao Wang, Yichen Liu, Xiaoming Shi, He Yan, Xiangju Li, Junmin Zhu, Wei Zhang |  |

To address this challenge, we introduce NOVA, a novel framework designed to identify high-quality data that aligns well with the LLM’s learned knowledge to reduce hallucinations. NOVA includes Internal Consistency Probing (ICP) and Semantic Equivalence Identification (SEI) to measure how familiar the LLM is with instruction data. Specifically, ICP evaluates the LLM’s understanding of the given instruction by calculating the tailored consistency among multiple self-generated responses. SEI further assesses the familiarity of the LLM with the target response by comparing it to the generated responses, using the proposed semantic clustering and well-designed voting strategy. Finally, to ensure the quality of selected samples, we introduce an expert-aligned reward model, considering characteristics beyond just familiarity. By considering data quality and avoiding... | Shuzheng Si, Haozhe Zhao, Gang Chen, Cheng Gao, Yuzhuo Bai, Zhitong Wang, Kaikai An, Kangyang Luo, Chen Qian, Fanchao Qi, Baobao Chang, Maosong Sun |  |

While multi-turn human jailbreaks have been shown to yield high attack success rates (ASRs), they demand considerable human effort and time. Our proposed Multi-turn-to-Single-turn (M2S) methods—Hyphenize, Numberize, and Pythonize—systematically reformat multi-turn dialogues into structured single-turn prompts. Despite eliminating iterative back-and-forth interactions, these reformatted prompts preserve and often enhance adversarial potency: in extensive evaluations on the Multi-turn Human Jailbreak (MHJ) dataset, M2S methods yield ASRs ranging from 70.6 % to 95.9 % across various state-of-the-art LLMs. Remarkably, our single-turn prompts outperform the original multi-turn attacks by up to 17.5 % in absolute ASR, while reducing token usage by more than half on... | Junwoo Ha, Hyunjun Kim, Sangyoon Yu, Haon Park, Ashkan Yousefpour, Yuna Park, Suhyun Kim |  |

However, current methods for cross-domain misinformation detection rely on effort- and resource-intensive fine-tuning and complex model structures. With the outstanding performance of LLMs, many studies have employed them for misinformation detection. Unfortunately, they focus on in-domain tasks and do not incorporate significant sentiment and emotion features (which we jointly call affect). In this paper, we propose RAEmoLLM, the first retrieval augmented (RAG) LLMs framework to address cross-domain misinformation detection using in-context learning based on affective information. RAEmoLLM includes three modules. (1) In the index construction module, we apply an emotional LLM to obtain affective embeddings from all domains to construct a retrieval database. (2) The retrieval module uses the database to recommend top K examples (text-label pairs) from source... | Zhiwei Liu, Kailai Yang, Qianqian Xie, Christine de Kock, Sophia Ananiadou, Eduard H.

Advanced end-to-end methods require both tasks to share the same intermediate features that serve as event queries, thereby enabling the mutual promotion of two tasks. However, relying on shared queries limits the model’s ability to extract task-specific information, as event semantic perception and localization demand distinct perspectives on video understanding. To address this, we propose a decomposed dense video captioning framework that derives localization and captioning queries from event queries, enabling task-specific representations while maintaining inter-task collaboration. Considering the roles of different queries, we design a contrastive semantic optimization strategy that guides localization queries to focus on event-level visual features and captioning queries to align with textual semantics. Besides, only localization information is considered in... | Zhiyue Liu, Xinru Zhang, Jinyuan Liu |  |

However, when applied to pairwise comparisons of candidate responses, LLM-based evaluators often exhibit selection bias. Specifically, their judgments may become inconsistent when the option positions or ID tokens are swapped, compromising the effectiveness and fairness of the evaluation result. To address this challenge, we introduce CalibraEval, a novel label-free method for mitigating selection bias during inference. Specifically, CalibraEval reformulates debiasing as an optimization task aimed at adjusting observed prediction distributions to align with unbiased prediction distributions. To solve this optimization problem, we propose a non-parametric order-preserving algorithm (NOA). This algorithm leverages the partial order relationships between... | Haitao Li, Junjie Chen, Qingyao Ai, Zhumin Chu, Yujia Zhou, Qian Dong, Yiqun Liu |  |

While automated systems for sexism detection have been developed, they still face two key challenges: data sparsity and the nuanced nature of sexist language. Even in large, well-curated datasets like the Explainable Detection of Online Sexism (EDOS), severe class imbalance hinders model generalization. Additionally, the overlapping and ambiguous boundaries of fine-grained categories introduce substantial annotator disagreement, reflecting the difficulty of interpreting nuanced expressions of sexism. To address these challenges, we propose two prompt-based data augmentation techniques: Definition-based Data Augmentation (DDA), which leverages category-specific definitions to generate semantically-aligned synthetic examples, and Contextual Semantic Expansion (CSE), which targets systematic model errors by enriching examples with task-specific... | Sahrish Khan, Arshad Jhumka, Gabriele Pergola |  |

In this paper, we introduce Private Memorization Editing (PME), an approach for preventing private data leakage that turns an apparent limitation, that is, the LLMs’ memorization ability, into a powerful privacy defense strategy. While attacks against LLMs have been performed exploiting previous knowledge regarding their training data, our approach aims to exploit the same kind of knowledge in order to make a model more robust. We detect a memorized PII and then mitigate the memorization of PII by editing a model knowledge of its training data. We verify that our procedure does not affect the underlying language model while making it more robust against privacy Training Data Extraction attacks. We demonstrate that PME can effectively reduce the number of leaked PII in a number of... | Elena Sofia Ruzzetti, Giancarlo A. Xompero, Davide Venditti, Fabio Massimo Zanzotto |  |

However, current evaluations overlook physics-based reasoning - a complex task requiring physics theorems and constraints. We present PhysReason, a 1,200-problem benchmark comprising knowledge-based (25%) and reasoning-based (75%) problems, where the latter are divided into three difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard). Notably, problems require an average of 8.1 solution steps, with hard requiring 15.6, reflecting the complexity of physics-based reasoning. We propose the Physics Solution Auto Scoring Framework, incorporating efficient answer-level and comprehensive step-level evaluations. Top-performing models like Deepseek-R1, Gemini-2.0-Flash-Thinking, and o3-mini-high achieve less than 60% on answer-level evaluation, with performance dropping from knowledge questions (75.11%) to hard problems (31.95%).

Temporal Heads: Where Language Models Recall Time-specific Information](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.812/) |  | 0 | While the ability of language models to elicit facts has been widely investigated, how they handle temporally changing facts remains underexplored. We discover Temporal Heads, specific attention heads that primarily handle temporal knowledge, through circuit analysis. We confirm that these heads are present across multiple models, though their specific locations may vary, and their responses differ depending on the type of knowledge and its corresponding years. Disabling these heads degrades the model’s ability to recall time-specific knowledge while maintaining its general capabilities without compromising time-invariant and question-answering performances. Moreover, the heads are activated not only numeric conditions (“In 2004”) but also textual aliases (“In the year ...”), indicating that they encode a temporal dimension beyond simple numerical representation. Furthermore, we expand the potential of our findings by demonstrating how temporal knowledge can be edited by adjusting the... | Yein Park, Chanwoong Yoon, Jungwoo Park, Minbyul Jeong, Jaewoo Kang |  |

In general, previous efforts resort to either sampling training data from different domains with static proportions or dynamically adjusting these proportions during training to optimise pretraining performance. However, few methods addressed the complexities of domain-adaptive continual pre-training. To fill this gap, we propose Velocitune, a novel framework that dynamically assesses learning velocity and adjusts data proportions accordingly, favouring slower learning domains while de-emphasising faster learning ones, which is guided by a scaling law to estimate the desired learning goal for each domain with a less associated cost. To evaluate the effectiveness of Velocitune, we conduct experiments on a dataset focused on reasoning tasks with CodeLlama, as well as on a corpus of system commands using Llama3 and Mistral.

This study identifies the limitations of LLMs in detecting implicit hate speech, particularly when disguised as seemingly harmless expressions in a rhetorical device. To address this challenge, we employ a Jailbreaking strategy and Energy-based Constrained Decoding techniques, and design a small model for measuring the energy of metaphorical rhetoric. This approach can lead to LLMs generating metaphorical implicit hate speech. Our research reveals that advanced LLMs, like GPT-4o, frequently misinterpret metaphorical implicit hate speech, and fail to prevent its propagation effectively. Even specialized models, like ShieldGemma and LlamaGuard, demonstrate inadequacies in blocking such content, often misclassifying it as harmless speech. This work points out the vulnerability of current LLMs to implicit... | Jingjie Zeng, Liang Yang, Zekun Wang, Yuanyuan Sun, Hongfei Lin |  |

Existing model editing methods, especially those that alter model parameters, typically focus on single-round editing and often face significant challenges in sequential model editing-most notably issues of model forgetting and failure. To address these challenges, we introduce a new model editing method, namely Neuron-level Sequential Editing (NSE), tailored for supporting sequential model editing. Specifically, we optimize the target layer’s hidden states using the model’s original weights to prevent model failure. Furthermore, we iteratively select neurons in multiple layers for editing based on their activation values to mitigate model forgetting.

During instruction-tuning, SIMoE automatically identifies multiple specialized experts under a specified sparsity constraint, with each expert representing a structurally sparse subset of the seed LLM’s parameters that correspond to domain-specific knowledge within the data. SIMoE simultaneously learns an input-dependent expert merging strategy via a router network, leveraging rich cross-expert knowledge for superior downstream generalization that surpasses existing baselines. Empirically, SIMoE consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance on common instruction-tuning benchmarks while maintaining an optimal performance-compute trade-off compared to all baselines. | Shengzhuang Chen, Ying Wei, Jonathan Richard Schwarz |  |

While large language models (LLMs) have been extended to handle the speech modality, streaming remains challenging as speech is pre-pended as a prompt for the entire generation process. To unlock LLM streaming capability, this paper proposes SimulS2S-LLM, which trains speech LLMs offline and employs a test-time policy to guide simultaneous inference. SimulS2S-LLM alleviates the mismatch between training and inference by extracting boundary-aware speech prompts that allows it to be better matched with text input data. SimulS2S-LLM achieves simultaneous speech-to-speech translation (Simul-S2ST) by predicting discrete output speech tokens and then synthesising output speech using a pre-trained vocoder. An incremental beam search is designed to expand the search space of speech token prediction without increasing latency. Experiments on the CVSS... | Keqi Deng, Wenxi Chen, Xie Chen, Philip C.

While these models require comprehensive world knowledge for meaningful and reliable human interactions, existing question-answering (QA) benchmarks fall short in evaluating SLMs’ knowledge understanding due to their inability to support end-to-end speech evaluation and account for varied input audio conditions. To address these limitations, we present VoxEval, a novel SpeechQA benchmark that assesses SLMs’ knowledge understanding through pure speech interactions. Our benchmark uniquely maintains speech format for both inputs and outputs, evaluates model robustness across diverse input audio conditions, and pioneers the assessment of complex tasks like mathematical reasoning in spoken format. Through systematic evaluation, we demonstrate that current SLMs exhibit poor performance on VoxEval, show sensitivity to varying audio conditions, and possess... | Wenqian Cui, Xiaoqi Jiao, Ziqiao Meng, Irwin King |  |

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers an effective solution by incorporating external knowledge, but existing methods still face several limitations: additional deployment costs of separate retrievers, redundant input tokens from retrieved text chunks, and the lack of joint optimization of retrieval and generation. To address these issues, we propose RetroLLM, a unified framework that integrates retrieval and generation into a single, auto-regressive process, enabling LLMs to directly generate fine-grained evidence from the corpus with constrained decoding. Moreover, to mitigate false pruning in the process of constrained evidence generation, we introduce (1) hierarchical FM-Index constraints, which generate corpus-constrained clues to identify a subset of relevant documents before evidence generation, reducing irrelevant decoding space; and (2) a forward-looking... | Xiaoxi Li, Jiajie Jin, Yujia Zhou, Yongkang Wu, Zhonghua Li, Ye Qi, Zhicheng Dou |  |

However, existing methods often involve many different design choices, which have not been systematically studied. This limits future developments. In this work, we decompose data pruning into two key components: data representation and selection algorithm, and systematically analyze their influence on selected instances. Our theoretical and empirical results highlight the crucial role of representations: better representations, e.g., training gradients, generally lead to better selected instances, regardless of the chosen selection algorithm. Furthermore, different selection algorithms excel in different settings, and none consistently outperform the others. Moreover, the selection algorithms do not always align with their intended objectives: for example, algorithms designed for the same objective can select drastically different instances, highlighting the need for... | Yupei Du, Yingjin Song, Hugh Mee Wong, Daniil Ignatev, Albert Gatt, Dong Nguyen |  |

These methods typically use response-level human or model feedback for alignment. Recent works indicate that finer sentence or span-level labels provide more accurate and interpretable feedback for LLM optimization. In this work, we propose FRACTAL, a suite of models to disaggregate response-level labels into sentence-level (pseudo-)labels through Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) and Learning from Label Proportions (LLP) formulations, novel usage of prior information, and maximum likelihood calibration. We perform close to 2000 experiments across 6 datasets and 4 tasks that show that FRACTAL can reach up to 93% of the performance of the fully supervised baseline while requiring only around 10% of the gold labels. Furthermore, in a downstream eval, employing step-level pseudo scores in RLHF for a math reasoning task leads to 5% absolute improvement in... | Yukti Makhija, Priyanka Agrawal, Rishi Saket, Aravindan Raghuveer |  |

In parallel, each agent also acquires knowledge of others, defined as a structured description of how other agents approach their tasks based on the agent’s own task resolution. (2) Each agent updates its knowledge and refines its task through interactions with others.

This work conducts a systematic investigation of LLMs’ ability to perform logical reasoning in natural language. We introduce a controlled dataset of hypothetical and disjunctive syllogisms in propositional and modal logic and use it as the testbed for understanding LLM performance. Our results lead to novel insights in predicting LLM behaviors: in addition to the probability of input, logical forms should be considered as important factors.

Existing length control methods involve fine-tuning the parameters of LLMs, which is inefficient and suboptimal for practical use. In this paper, we propose a novel iterative sampling framework for text length control, integrating the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with an importance sampling acceleration strategy. This framework efficiently and reliably regulates LLMs to generate length-constrained text without modifying the underlying parameters, thereby preserving the original capabilities of LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves almost 100% success rates of length control on Llama3.1 for tasks such as length-controlled abstractive summarization and length-constrained instruction following, with minimal additional... | Yuxuan Gu, Wenjie Wang, Xiaocheng Feng, Weihong Zhong, Kun Zhu, Lei Huang, Ting Liu, Bing Qin, TatSeng Chua |  |

In this work, we identify a salient correlation between LFQA faithfulness and retrieval heads, a set of attention heads responsible for retrieving contextual information. Leveraging this insight, we propose RHIO, a framework designed to teach LLMs to explicitly discriminate between faithful and unfaithful generations. RHIO first augments unfaithful samples that simulate realistic model-intrinsic errors by selectively masking retrieval heads. Then, these samples are incorporated into joint training, enabling the model to distinguish unfaithful outputs from faithful ones conditioned on control tokens. Furthermore, these control tokens are leveraged to self-induce contrastive outputs, amplifying their difference through contrastive decoding. Additionally, to facilitate the... | Lei Huang, Xiaocheng Feng, Weitao Ma, Yuchun Fan, Xiachong Feng, Yangfan Ye, Weihong Zhong, Yuxuan Gu, Baoxin Wang, Dayong Wu, Guoping Hu, Bing Qin |  |

Recent instruction expansion methods have demonstrated their capability to improve the quality and quantity of existing datasets, by prompting high-performance LLM to generate multiple new instructions from the original ones. However, existing methods focus on constructing multi-perspective prompts (e.g., increasing complexity or difficulty) to expand instructions, overlooking the “Fixed Thinking Pattern” issue of LLMs. This issue arises when repeatedly using the same set of prompts, causing LLMs to rely on a limited set of certain expressions to expand all instructions, potentially compromising the diversity of the final expanded dataset. This paper theoretically analyzes the causes of the “Fixed Thinking Pattern”, and corroborates this phenomenon through multi-faceted empirical research. Furthermore, we propose a novel method based on dynamic prompt updating:... | Wenxuan Lu, Wei Liu, Jian Luan, Bin Wang, Songhao Jiang, Tianning Zang |  |

However, LLMs sometimes produce false or misleading responses, also known as hallucinations”. Therefore, grounding the generated answers in contextually provided information—i.e., providing evidence for the generated text—is paramount for LLMs’ trustworthiness. Providing this information is the task of context attribution. In this paper, we systematically study LLM-based approaches for this task, namely we investigate (i) zero-shot inference, (ii) LLM ensembling, and (iii) fine-tuning of small LMs on synthetic data generated by larger LLMs. Our key contribution is SynQA: a novel generative strategy for synthesizing context attribution data. Given selected context sentences, an LLM generates QA pairs that are supported by these sentences. This leverages LLMs’ natural strengths in text generation while ensuring clear attribution paths in the synthetic training data. We show that the attribution data... | Gorjan Radevski, Kiril Gashteovski, Shahbaz Syed, Christopher Malon, Sebastien Nicolas, ChiaChien Hung, Timo Sztyler, Verena Heußer, Wiem Ben Rim, Masafumi Enomoto, Kunihiro Takeoka, Masafumi Oyamada, Goran Glavas, Carolin Lawrence |  |

Existing researches have gone through a paradigm shift from traditional bottom-up IE (Information Extraction) to top-down LLMs-based question answering with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). Furthermore, these methods mainly adopt end-to-end models or use multi-stage pipelines to extract text content based on static table structures. However, they neglect to deal with precise inner-document evidence extraction and dynamic information such as multiple entities and events, which can not be defined in static table head format and are very common in natural texts.To address this issue, we propose a two-stage dynamic content extraction agent framework called TST (Text-Schema-Table), which uses type recognition methods to extract context evidences with the conduction of domain schema... | Peiwen Jiang, Haitong Jiang, Ruhui Ma, Yvonne Jie Chen, Jinhua Cheng |  |

We present EventRAG, a novel framework that enhances text generation through structured event representations. We first construct an Event Knowledge Graph by extracting events and merging semantically equivalent nodes across documents, while expanding under-connected relationships. We then employ an iterative retrieval and inference strategy that explicitly captures temporal dependencies and logical relationships across events. Experiments on UltraDomain and MultiHopRAG benchmarks show EventRAG’s superiority over baseline RAG systems, with substantial gains in generation effectiveness, logical consistency, and multi-hop reasoning accuracy. Our work advances RAG systems by integrating structured event semantics with iterative inference, particularly benefiting scenarios requiring temporal and logical... | Zairun Yang, Yilin Wang, Zhengyan Shi, Yuan Yao, Lei Liang, Keyan Ding, Emine Yilmaz, Huajun Chen, Qiang Zhang |  |

A key issue is that presently LLMs learn in a data-driven schema, while the instructions about these complex tasks are both scarce and hard to collect or construct. On the contrary, a prominent phenomenon is that LLMs can learn rather fast on simpler tasks with adequate prior knowledge captured during pretraining stage. Thus, if the prerequisite and mechanism of such rapid generalization could be elucidated, it could enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the LLM’s ability to learn complex tasks. Thus, in this paper, we employ a gradient-based method, to dissect the process that the SFT process adapts LLMs to downstream tasks via the perspective of attention patterns. We find that: (1) LLMs selectively activate task-specific attention heads during SFT; (2) activation patterns for complex tasks are combinations of basic task patterns; and (3) changes in a few parameters can significantly impact activation patterns after... | Yang Zhao, Li Du, Xiao Ding, Kai Xiong, Ting Liu, Bing Qin |  |

However, ensuring the safety of these models remains a significant challenge, particularly in accurately identifying whether multimodal content is safe or unsafe—a capability we term safety awareness. In this paper, we introduce MMSafeAware, the first comprehensive multimodal safety awareness benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs across 29 safety scenarios with 1,500 carefully curated image-prompt pairs. MMSafeAware includes both unsafe and over-safety subsets to assess models’ abilities to correctly identify unsafe content and avoid over-sensitivity that can hinder helpfulness. Evaluating nine widely used MLLMs using MMSafeAware reveals that current models are not sufficiently safe and often overly sensitive; for example, GPT-4V misclassifies 36.1% of unsafe inputs as safe and 59.9% of benign inputs as unsafe. We further explore... | Wenxuan Wang, Xiaoyuan Liu, Kuiyi Gao, Jentse Huang, Youliang Yuan, Pinjia He, Shuai Wang, Zhaopeng Tu |  |

Current error-handling works are performed in a passive manner, with explicit error-handling instructions. However, in real-world scenarios, explicit error-handling instructions are usually unavailable. In this paper, our work identifies this challenge as how to conduct proactive error handling without explicit error handling instructions. To promote further research, this work introduces a new benchmark, termed Mis-prompt, consisting of four evaluation tasks, an error category taxonomy, and a new evaluation dataset. Furthermore, this work analyzes current LLMs’ performance on the benchmark, and the experimental results reveal that current LLMs show poor performance on proactive error handling, and SFT on error handling instances improves LLMs’ proactive error handling capabilities. The dataset will be publicly available. | Jiayi Zeng, Yizhe Feng, Mengliang He, Wenhui Lei, Wei Zhang, Zeming Liu, Xiaoming Shi, Aimin Zhou |  |

Existing benchmarks, such as TravelPlanner and TravelPlanner+, rely on semi-synthetic data as well ignoring several key components of travel planning, limiting their real-world applicability. Therefore, we introduce TripCraft, a spatio-temporally coherent travel planning dataset incorporating real-world constraints, including public transit schedules, public events, varied attraction categories, and user personas for enhanced personalization. Our dataset enables more detailed trip itinerary generation (including duration spent at each point of interest based on users’ persona, transit between two points of interest, etc.) while ensuring spatio-temporal consistency. Further, we propose novel evaluation metrics (temporal meal score, attraction score, spatial score, ordering score, and persona score) to assess... | Soumyabrata Chaudhuri, Pranav Purkar, Ritwik Raghav, Shubhojit Mallick, Manish Gupta, Abhik Jana, Shreya Ghosh |  |

Current defense methods, like adding noise to activations or gradients, often sacrifice task-specific model performance under strict privacy constraints. This paper introduces DualGuard, a bidirectional defense mechanism against DRAs for split-based LLM-FT. DualGuard proposes a local warm-up parameter space transformation to alter client-side model parameters before training, using multi-task learning to strike a balance between privacy protection and model performance. Additionally, a global fine-tuning parameter space retention strategy prevents the model from reverting to vulnerable states during formal fine-tuning. Experiments show that DualGuard outperforms current defense methods against various DRAs,... | Zihan Liu, Yizhen Wang, Rui Wang, Sai Wu |  |

Unlike standard video captioning, it involves not only describing key visual details but also inferring plots that unfold across multiple movie shots, presenting distinct and complex challenges. To advance this field, we introduce Movie101v2, a large-scale, bilingual dataset with enhanced data quality specifically designed for movie narration. Revisiting the task, we propose breaking down the ultimate goal of automatic movie narration into three progressive stages, offering a clear roadmap with corresponding evaluation metrics. Based on our new benchmark, we baseline a range of large vision-language models and conduct an in-depth analysis of the challenges in movie narration generation. Our findings highlight that achieving applicable movie narration generation is a fascinating goal that requires significant research. | Zihao Yue, Yepeng Zhang, Ziheng Wang, Qin Jin |  |

Automatic Benchmarking using Knowledge Graphs](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.837/) |  | 0 | Attributed Question Answering (AQA) has attracted wide attention, but there are still several limitations in evaluating the attributions, including lacking fine-grained attribution categories, relying on manual annotations, and failing to compare attributions with only subtle differences. To bridge these gaps, we introduce Complex Attributed Question Answering (CAQA), a large-scale benchmark containing comprehensive attribution categories, automatically generated using Knowledge Graphs (KGs), and complex attribution scenarios. We have conducted extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of CAQA, including the benchmarking of 25 automatic evaluators, their comparison with human evaluators, the testing of LLM evaluators fine-tuned by CAQA and so on. These experiments also lead to a series of important findings that can benefit the future research of AQA. | Nan Hu, Jiaoyan Chen, Yike Wu, Guilin Qi, Hongru Wang, Sheng Bi, Yongrui Chen, Tongtong Wu, Jeff Z.

However, existing benchmarks rely on human or machine annotations that are vulnerable to value-related biases. Furthermore, the tested scenarios often diverge from real-world contexts in which models are commonly used to generate text and express values. To address these issues, we propose the Value Portrait benchmark, a reliable framework for evaluating LLMs’ value orientations with two key characteristics. First, the benchmark consists of items that capture real-life user-LLM interactions, enhancing the relevance of assessment results to real-world LLM usage. Second, each item is rated by human subjects based on its similarity to their own thoughts, and correlations between these ratings and the subjects’ actual value scores are derived. This psychometrically validated approach ensures that items strongly correlated with... | Jongwook Han, Dongmin Choi, Woojung Song, EunJu Lee, Yohan Jo |  |

However, current benchmarks lack a dedicated evaluation framework for this capability. To fill this gap, we introduce FEA-Bench, a benchmark designed to assess the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform incremental development within code repositories. We collect pull requests from 83 GitHub repositories and use rule-based and intent-based filtering to construct task instances focused on new feature development. Each task instance containing code changes is paired with relevant unit test files to ensure that the solution can be verified. The feature implementation requires LLMs to simultaneously possess code completion capabilities for new components and code editing abilities for other relevant parts in the code repository, providing a more comprehensive evaluation method of LLMs’ automated software engineering capabilities.Experimental results show that LLMs... | Wei Li, Xin Zhang, Zhongxin Guo, Shaoguang Mao, Wen Luo, Guangyue Peng, Yangyu Huang, Houfeng Wang, Scarlett Li |  |

Identify and Solve the Uncertainty](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.840/) |  | 0 | Despite the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various domains, they frequently exhibit overconfidence when encountering uncertain scenarios, yet existing solutions primarily rely on evasive responses (e.g., “I don’t know”) overlooks the opportunity of identifying and addressing the uncertainty to generate more satisfactory responses. To systematically investigate and improve LLMs’ ability of recognizing and addressing the source of uncertainty, we introduce ConfuseBench, a benchmark mainly focus on three types of uncertainty: document scarcity, limited capability, and query ambiguity. Experiments with ConfuseBench reveal that current LLMs struggle to accurately identify the root cause of uncertainty and solve it. They prefer to attribute uncertainty to query ambiguity while overlooking capability limitations, especially for those weaker models. To tackle this challenge, we first generate context-aware inquiries that highlight the confusing aspect of the... | Jingyu Liu, JingquanPeng JingquanPeng, Xiaopeng Wu, Xubin Li, Tiezheng Ge, Bo Zheng, Yong Liu |  |

While in-context editing (ICE) is currently the most effective method for knowledge editing (KE), it is constrained by the black-box modeling of LLMs and thus lacks interpretability. Our work aims to elucidate the superior performance of ICE in KE by analyzing the impacts of in-context new knowledge on token-wise distributions. We observe that despite a significant boost in logits of the new knowledge, the performance of ICE is still hindered by stubborn knowledge. We propose a novel approach termed Decoding by Contrasting Knowledge (DeCK). DeCK derives the distribution of the next token by contrasting the logits obtained from the newly edited knowledge guided by ICE with those from the unedited parametric knowledge. Our experiments demonstrate that DeCK enhances the confidence of LLMs in edited facts. For instance, it improves the performance of LLaMA3-8B-instruct on MQuAKE by up to 219%, demonstrating its... | Baolong Bi, Shenghua Liu, Lingrui Mei, Yiwei Wang, Junfeng Fang, Pengliang Ji, Xueqi Cheng |  |

In this work, we introduce a novel dataset, ImpliHateVid, specifically curated for implicit hate speech detection in videos. ImpliHateVid consists of 2,009 videos comprising 509 implicit hate videos, 500 explicit hate videos, and 1,000 non-hate videos, making it one of the first large-scale video datasets dedicated to implicit hate detection. We also propose a novel two-stage contrastive learning framework for hate speech detection in videos. In the first stage, we train modality-specific encoders for audio, text, and image using contrastive loss by concatenating features from the three encoders. In the second stage, we train cross-encoders using contrastive learning to refine multimodal representations. Additionally, we incorporate sentiment, emotion, and caption-based features to enhance implicit hate detection.

However, explanations generated via CoT are susceptible to content biases that negatively affect their robustness and faithfulness. To mitigate existing limitations, recent work has proposed using logical formalisms coupled with external symbolic solvers. However, fully symbolic approaches possess the bottleneck of requiring a complete translation from natural language to formal languages, a process that affects efficiency and flexibility. To achieve a trade-off, this paper investigates methods to disentangle content from logical reasoning without a complete formalisation. In particular, we present QuaSAR (for Quasi-Symbolic Abstract Reasoning), a variation of CoT that guides LLMs to operate at a higher level of abstraction via quasi-symbolic explanations. Our framework leverages the capability of LLMs to formalise only... | Leonardo Ranaldi, Marco Valentino, André Freitas |  |

Specialized non-LLM NLP-based solutions typically involve training models using both textual and geometric information to label sequences/tokens as named entities or answers to specific questions. However, these approaches lack reasoning, are not able to infer values not explicitly present in documents, and do not generalize well to new formats. Generative LLMs-based approaches proposed recently are capable of reasoning, but struggle to comprehend clues from document layout especially in previously unseen document formats, and do not show competitive performance in heterogeneous VRD benchmark datasets. In this paper, we propose BLOCKIE, a novel LLM-based approach that organizes VRDs into localized, reusable semantic textual segments called semantic blocks, which are processed independently.

While equipping LLMs with external tools to build LLM-based agents can enhance their capabilities, existing approaches lack the flexibility to address diverse and ever-evolving user queries in open domains. Currently, there is also no existing dataset that evaluates LLMs on open-domain knowledge that requires tools to solve. To this end, we introduce OpenAct benchmark to evaluate the open-domain task-solving capability, which is built on human expert consultation and repositories in GitHub. It comprises 339 questions spanning 7 diverse domains that need to be solved with domain-specific methods. In our experiments, even state-of-the-art LLMs and LLM-based agents demonstrate unsatisfactory success rates, underscoring the need for a novel approach.Furthermore, we present OpenAgent, a novel LLM-based agent system... | Bohan Lyu, Xin Cong, Heyang Yu, Pan Yang, Cheng Qian, Zihe Wang, Yujia Qin, Yining Ye, Yaxi Lu, Chen Qian, Zhong Zhang, Yukun Yan, Yankai Lin, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun |  |

Most research on Large Language Model (LLM)-based simulated patients focuses on improving data retrieval accuracy or adjusting prompts through human feedback. However, this focus has overlooked the critical need for patient agents to learn a standardized presentation pattern that transforms data into human-like patient responses through unsupervised simulations. To address this gap, we propose EvoPatient, a novel simulated patient framework in which a patient agent and doctor agents simulate the diagnostic process through multi-turn dialogues, simultaneously gathering experience to improve the quality of both questions and answers, ultimately enabling human doctor training.

Comparing Data Collection Strategies for Emotion-labeled Multimodal Social Media Posts](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.847/) |  | 0 | Accurate modeling of subjective phenomena such as emotion expression requires data annotated with authors’ intentions. Commonly such data is collected by asking study participants to donate and label genuine content produced in the real world, or create content fitting particu- lar labels during the study. Asking participants to create content is often simpler to implement and presents fewer risks to participant privacy than data donation. However, it is unclear if and how study-created content may differ from genuine content, and how differences may impact models. We collect study-created and genuine multimodal social media posts labeled for emotion and compare them on several dimen- sions, including model performance. We find that compared to genuine posts, study-created posts are longer, rely more on their text and less on their images for emotion expression, and focus more on emotion-prototypical events. The samples of participants willing to donate versus create posts are... | Christopher Bagdon, Aidan Combs, Carina Silberer, Roman Klinger |  |

It is therefore important to acknowledge label variations to not under-represent members of a society. Two research directions developed out of this observation in the context of using large language models (LLM) for data annotations, namely (1) studying biases and inherent knowledge of LLMs and (2) injecting diversity in the output by manipulating the prompt with demographic information. We combine these two strands of research and ask the question to which demographics an LLM resorts to when no demographics is given. To answer this question, we evaluate which attributes of human annotators LLMs inherently mimic. Furthermore, we compare non-demographic conditioned prompts and placebo-conditioned prompts (e.g., “you are an annotator who lives... | Johannes Schäfer, Aidan Combs, Christopher Bagdon, Jiahui Li, Nadine Probol, Lynn Greschner, Sean Papay, Yarik Menchaca Resendiz, Aswathy Velutharambath, Amelie Wührl, Sabine Weber, Roman Klinger |  |

Evaluating Large Language Models from a Code Security Perspective](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.849/) |  | 0 | Code security and usability are both essential for various coding assistant applications driven by large language models (LLMs). Current code security benchmarks focus solely on single evaluation task and paradigm, such as code completion and generation, lacking comprehensive assessment across dimensions like secure code generation, vulnerability repair and discrimination. In this paper, we first propose CoV-Eval, a multi-task benchmark covering various tasks such as code completion, vulnerability repair, vulnerability detection and classification, for comprehensive evaluation of LLM code security. Besides, we developed VC-Judge, an improved judgment model that aligns closely with human experts and can review LLM-generated programs for vulnerabilities in a more efficient and reliable way. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 20 proprietary and open-source LLMs. Overall, while most LLMs identify vulnerable codes well, they still tend to generate insecure codes and struggle with... | Yutao Mou, Xiao Deng, Yuxiao Luo, Shikun Zhang, Wei Ye |  |

Existing methods mainly focus on end-to-end training to reinforce adherence to length constraints. However, the lack of decomposition and targeted enhancement of LCTG sub-abilities restricts further progress. To bridge this gap, we conduct a bottom-up decomposition of LCTG sub-abilities with human patterns as reference and perform a detailed error analysis. On this basis, we propose MarkerGen, a simple-yet-effective plug-and-play approach that: (1) mitigates LLM fundamental deficiencies via external tool integration; (2) conducts explicit length modeling with dynamically inserted markers; (3) employs a three-stage generation scheme to better align length constraints while maintaining content quality.

Existing defenses, including post-training alignment and prompt engineering, rely on training on safety-annotated datasets and safe prompt templates, struggling with adaptability to out-of-distribution (OOD) attacks. Steering internal representations of LLMs provides real-time adjustments to defend against OOD attacks. However, it struggles with maintaining model utility, since modifying the representation disrupts the forward pass of inference. It barely considers the competitive objectives of helpfulness and harmlessness in LLMs. We argue that adversarial game-based approaches promise a solution for conflicts between the two objectives. In this paper, we propose \*\*A\*\*dversarial \*\*G\*\*ame \*\*D\*\*efense (AGD), an adversarial game-based defense method that dynamically adjusts LLMs’ internal representations to achieve a balanced trade-off between helpfulness and... | Shilong Pan, Zhiliang Tian, Zhen Huang, Wanlong Yu, Zhihua Wen, Xinwang Liu, Kai Lu, Minlie Huang, Dongsheng Li |  |

This is probably because there is no rational explanation for whether the comprehension process of LLMs is aligned with that of experts. In this paper, we propose SCOP to carefully examine how LLMs perform during the comprehension process from a cognitive view. Specifically, it is equipped with a systematical definition of five requisite skills during the comprehension process, a strict framework to construct testing data for these skills, and a detailed analysis of advanced open-sourced and closed-sourced LLMs using the testing data. With SCOP, we find that it is still challenging for LLMs to perform an expert-level comprehension process. Even so, we notice that LLMs share some similarities with experts, e.g., performing better at comprehending local information than global information.

While existing approaches have explored various decomposition strategies, they often lack effective mechanisms to identify and correct errors in intermediate reasoning steps, leading to cascading error propagation. To address these issues, we propose Table-Critic, a novel multi-agent framework that facilitates collaborative criticism and iterative refinement of the reasoning process until convergence to correct solutions.

However, building suitable multilingual datasets remains a challenge. In this work, we present HPLT v2, a collection of high-quality multilingual monolingual and parallel corpora, extending prior work of the HPLT project. The monolingual portion of the data contains 8T tokens covering 193 languages, while the parallel data contains 380M sentence pairs covering 51 languages. We document the entire data pipeline and release the code to reproduce it. We provide extensive analysis of the quality and characteristics of our data. Finally, we evaluate the performance of language models and machine translation systems trained on HPLT v2, demonstrating its value. | Laurie Burchell, Ona De Gibert Bonet, Nikolay Arefyev, Mikko Aulamo, Marta Bañón, Pinzhen Chen, Mariia Fedorova, Liane Guillou, Barry Haddow, Jan Hajic, Jindrich Helcl, Erik Henriksson, Mateusz Klimaszewski, Ville Komulainen, Andrey Kutuzov, Joona Kytöniemi, Veronika Laippala, Petter Mæhlum, Bhavitvya Malik, Farrokh Mehryary, Vladislav Mikhailov, Nikita Moghe, Amanda Myntti, Dayyán O'Brien, Stephan Oepen, Proyag Pal, Jousia Piha, Sampo Pyysalo, Gema RamírezSánchez, David Samuel, Pavel Stepachev, Jörg Tiedemann, Dusan Varis, Tereza Vojtechová, Jaume ZaragozaBernabeu |  |

However, VLMs often struggle in these domains due to the scarcity of diverse text-rich vision-language data. To address this challenge, we present CoSyn, a framework that leverages the coding capabilities of text-only large language models (LLMs) to automatically create synthetic text-rich multimodal data. Given input text describing a target domain (e.g., “nutrition fact labels”), CoSyn prompts an LLM to generate code (Python, HTML, LaTeX, etc.) for rendering synthetic images. With the underlying code as textual representations of the synthetic images, CoSyn can generate high-quality instruction-tuning data, again relying on a text-only LLM. Using CoSyn, we constructed a dataset comprising 400K images and 2.7M rows of vision-language instruction-tuning data. Comprehensive experiments on seven benchmarks demonstrate that models trained on our synthetic data... | Yue Yang, Ajay Patel, Matt Deitke, Tanmay Gupta, Luca Weihs, Andrew Head, Mark Yatskar, Chris CallisonBurch, Ranjay Krishna, Aniruddha Kembhavi, Christopher Clark |  |

We introduce Hierarchical Attention, a regularization method that aligns LLMs’ attention mechanisms with mathematical reasoning structures. Our approach establishes a five-level hierarchy from foundational elements to high-level concepts, ensuring structured information flow in proof generation. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves proof success rates by 2.05% on miniF2F and 1.69% on ProofNet while reducing proof complexity by 23.81% and 16.50% respectively. The code and models will be available. | Jianlong Chen, Chao Li, Yang Yuan, Andrew C. Yao |  |

However, due to limitations in a lack of external feedback, these agents struggle with self-correction and generalization. A promising approach is to use reward models as external feedback, but there is no clear on how to select reward models for agents. Thus, there is an urgent need to build a reward bench targeted at agents. To address these challenges, we propose Agent-RewardBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate reward modeling ability in MLLMs. The benchmark is characterized by three key features: (1) Multiple dimensions and real-world agent scenarios evaluation. It covers perception, planning, and safety with 7 scenarios; (2) Step-level reward evaluation. It allows for the assessment of agent capabilities at the individual steps of a task, providing a more granular view of performance during the planning process; and (3)... | Tianyi Men, Zhuoran Jin, Pengfei Cao, Yubo Chen, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao |  |

However, the understanding and generation of appropriate bragging behavior in large language models (LLMs) remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive study that combines analytical and controllable approaches to examine bragging in LLMs. We design three tasks, bragging recognition, bragging explanation, and bragging generation, along with novel evaluation metrics to assess the models’ ability to identify bragging intent, social appropriateness, and account for context sensitivity. Our analysis reveals the challenges of bragging in the social context, such as recognizing bragging and responding appropriately with bragging in conversation. This work provides new insights into how LLMs process bragging and highlights the need for more research on generating contextually appropriate behavior in LLMs. | Jingjie Zeng, Huayang Li, Liang Yang, Yuanyuan Sun, Hongfei Lin |  |

A key component of agents is memory, which stores vital information but is susceptible to jailbreak attacks. Existing research mainly focuses on single-agent attacks and shared memory attacks. However, real-world scenarios often involve independent memory. In this paper, we propose the Troublemaker Makes Chaos in Honest Town (TMCHT) task, a large-scale, multi-agent, multi-topology text-based attack evaluation framework. TMCHT involves one attacker agent attempting to mislead an entire society of agents. We identify two major challenges in multi-agent attacks: (1) Non-complete graph structure, (2) Large-scale systems. We attribute these challenges to a phenomenon we term toxicity disappearing. To address these issues, we propose an Adversarial Replication Contagious Jailbreak (ARCJ) method, which optimizes the retrieval suffix to make poisoned samples more easily retrieved and optimizes the... | Tianyi Men, Pengfei Cao, Zhuoran Jin, Yubo Chen, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao |  |

Meta-learning has been proposed as a way to integrate human-like learning biases into neural-network architectures, combining both the structured generalizations of symbolic models with the scalability of neural-network models. But what does meta-learning exactly imbue the model with? We investigate the meta-learning of formal languages and find that, contrary to previous claims, meta-trained models are not learning simplicity-based priors when meta-trained on datasets organised around simplicity. Rather, we find evidence that meta-training imprints neural mechanisms (such as counters) into the model, which function like cognitive primitives for the network on downstream tasks. Most surprisingly, we find that meta-training on a \*single\* formal language can provide as much improvement to a model as meta-training on 5000 different formal languages, provided that... | Michael Eric Goodale, Salvador Mascarenhas, Yair Lakretz |  |

However, there is a growing concern about their potential to perpetuate social biases present in their training data. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the vulnerabilities of contemporary LLMs to various social bias attacks, including prefix injection, refusal suppression, and learned attack prompts. We evaluate popular models such as LLaMA-2, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 across gender, racial, and religious bias types. Our findings reveal that models are generally more susceptible to gender bias attacks compared to racial or religious biases. We also explore novel aspects such as cross-bias and multiple-bias attacks, finding varying degrees of transferability across bias types. Additionally, our results show that larger models and pretrained base models often exhibit higher susceptibility to bias attacks.

Despite the better user understanding and human-like responses, their \*\*lack of controllability\*\* remains a key challenge, often leading to unfocused conversations or task failure. To address this, we introduce Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) to regulate dialogue flow.

Such systems cannot reason at the pixel level and comprehend dynamic user intent that changes over interaction. Our work tackles this issue by introducing a novel task, Pixel-level Reasoning Segmentation (Pixel-level RS) based on multi-turn conversations, tracking evolving user intent via multi-turn interactions for fine-grained segmentation. To establish a benchmark for this novel task, we build a Pixel-level ReasonIng Segmentation Dataset Based on Multi-Turn Conversations (PRIST), comprising 24k utterances from 8.3k multi-turn conversational scenarios with segmentation targets. Building on PRIST, we further propose MIRAS, a Multi-turn Interactive ReAsoning Segmentation framework, integrates pixel-level segmentation with robust multi-turn conversation understanding, generating pixel-grounded explanations aligned with user intent.

However, synthetic data methods often require human-introduced errors or sampling of the model’s reasoning results from the previous moment, and the current output distribution of the model cannot be obtained, makes the data for critique and reasoning face the problem of distribution shifts. In this work, we propose an on-policy reinforcement learning framework to synchronize the reasoning and critique capabilities of language models. To alleviate reward hacking caused by outcome-based supervision, we design a deliberate reward framework for different purposes. The reward framework not only supervises the model reasoning process based on the results, but also uses Monte Carlo sampling to give appropriate rewards to the critique content according to the success rate of... | Rong Bao, Donglei Yu, Kai Fan, Minpeng Liao |  |

Prior work on investigating their operation mostly focused on analyzing their behavior during inference for specific circuits or tasks. In this work, we seek a comprehensive mapping of the operations they implement in a model. We propose MAPS (Mapping Attention head ParameterS), an efficient framework that infers the functionality of attention heads from their parameters, without any model training or inference. We showcase the utility of MAPS for answering two types of questions: (a) given a predefined operation, mapping how strongly heads across the model implement it, and (b) given an attention head, inferring its salient functionality. Evaluating MAPS on 20 operations across 6 popular LLMs shows its estimations correlate with the head’s outputs during inference and are causally linked to the model’s predictions. Moreover, its mappings reveal attention heads of certain operations that were overlooked in... | Amit Elhelo, Mor Geva |  |

Recent work has shown that the interaction of large language models (LLMs) with theorem provers (TPs) can help verify and improve the validity of NLI explanations. However, TPs require translating natural language into machine-verifiable formal representations, a process that introduces the risk of semantic information loss and unfaithful interpretation, an issue compounded by LLMs’ challenges in capturing critical logical structures with sufficient precision. Moreover, LLMs are still limited in their capacity for rigorous and robust proof construction within formal verification frameworks. To mitigate issues related to faithfulness and robustness, this paper investigates strategies to (1) alleviate semantic loss during autoformalisation, (2) efficiently identify and correct syntactic errors in logical representations, (3) explicitly use... | Xin Quan, Marco Valentino, Louise A.

Despite the fact that many existing knowledge editing algorithms achieve near-perfect performance on conventional metrics, the models edited by them are still prone to generating original knowledge. This paper introduces the concept of "\*\*superficial editing\*\*” to describe this phenomenon. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that this issue presents a significant challenge to existing algorithms. Through systematic investigation, we identify and validate two key factors contributing to this issue: (1) the residual stream at the last subject position in earlier layers and (2) specific attention modules in later layers. Notably, certain attention heads in later layers, along with specific left singular vectors in their output matrices, encapsulate the original knowledge and exhibit a causal relationship with superficial editing. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to the task of... | Jiakuan Xie, Pengfei Cao, Yubo Chen, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao |  |

When Language Models (LMs) are prompted with multiple search results, they are tasked not only with retrieving relevant information but also employing multi-hop reasoning across the information sources. Although LMs perform well on traditional question-answering tasks, the causal mask can hinder their capacity to reason across complex contexts. In this paper, we explore how LMs respond to multi-hop questions by permuting search results (retrieved documents) under various configurations. Our study reveals interesting findings as follows: 1) Encoder-decoder models, such as the ones in the Flan-T5 family, generally outperform causal decoder-only LMs in MHQA tasks, despite being significantly smaller in size; 2) altering the order of gold documents reveals distinct trends in both Flan T5 models and fine-tuned decoder-only models, with optimal performance observed when the... | Wenyu Huang, Pavlos Vougiouklis, Mirella Lapata, Jeff Z.

Leveraging eye-gaze data from the Ghent Eye-Tracking Corpus, we conducted a series of experiments to examine how integrating knowledge of human reading behavior impacts Neural Language Models (NLMs) across multiple dimensions: task performance, attention mechanisms, and the geometry of their embedding space. We explored several fine-tuning methodologies to inject eye-tracking features into the models. Our results reveal that incorporating these features does not degrade downstream task performance, enhances alignment between model attention and human attention patterns, and compresses the geometry of the embedding space. | Luca Dini, Lucia Domenichelli, Dominique Brunato, Felice Dell'Orletta |  |

Whereas, conventional one-step retrieve-and-read methods are insufficient for multi-hop question answering, facing challenges of retrieval semantic mismatching and the high cost in handling interdependent subquestions. In this paper, we propose Optimizing Question Semantic Space for Dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Multi-hop Question Answering (Q-DREAM). Q-DREAM consists of three key modules: (1) the Question Decomposition Module (QDM), which decomposes multi-hop questions into fine-grained subquestions; (2) the Subquestion Dependency Optimizer Module (SDOM), which models the interdependent relations of subquestions for better understanding; and (3) the Dynamic Passage Retrieval Module (DPRM), which aligns subquestions with relevant passages by optimizing the semantic embeddings.Experimental results across various benchmarks demonstrate that... | Linhao Ye, Lang Yu, Zhikai Lei, Qin Chen, Jie Zhou, Liang He |  |

To study this issue, we introduce an automated framework, augmented with human-in-the-loop quality control, to generate inputs designed to simulate and evaluate these conflicts in MLLMs. Using this framework, we have crafted a diagnostic benchmark consisting of 374 original images and 1,122 high-quality question-answer (QA) pairs. The benchmark covers two aspects of conflict and three question types, providing a thorough assessment tool. We apply this benchmark to assess the conflict-resolution capabilities of nine representative MLLMs from various model families.

While large language models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in generating general 3D scenes from textual descriptions, generating industrial scenes with LLMs poses a unique challenge due to their demand for precise measurements and positioning, requiring complex planning over spatial arrangement. To address this challenge, we introduce SceneGenAgent, an LLM-based agent for generating industrial scenes through C# code. SceneGenAgent ensures precise layout planning through a structured and calculable format, layout verification, and iterative refinement to meet the quantitative requirements of industrial scenarios. Experiment results demonstrate that LLMs powered by SceneGenAgent exceed their original performance, reaching up to 81.0% success rate in real-world industrial scene generation tasks and effectively meeting most scene generation requirements.

We propose ToolCoder, a novel framework that reformulates tool learning as a code generation task. Inspired by software engineering principles, ToolCoder transforms natural language queries into structured Python function scaffold and systematically breaks down tasks with descriptive comments, enabling LLMs to leverage coding paradigms for complex reasoning and planning. It then generates and executes function implementations to obtain final responses. Additionally, ToolCoder stores successfully executed functions in a repository to promote code reuse, while leveraging error traceback mechanisms for systematic debugging, optimizing both... | Hanxing Ding, Shuchang Tao, Liang Pang, Zihao Wei, Jinyang Gao, Bolin Ding, Huawei Shen, Xueqi Cheng |  |

This approach has gained attention for its efficiency and interpretability. However, while extensively explored for English, text editing remains largely underexplored for morphologically rich languages like Arabic. In this paper, we introduce a text editing approach that derives edit tags directly from data, eliminating the need for language-specific edits. We demonstrate its effectiveness on Arabic, a diglossic and morphologically rich language, and investigate the impact of different edit representations on model performance. Our approach achieves SOTA results on two Arabic GEC benchmarks and performs on par with SOTA on two others. Additionally, our models are over six times faster than existing Arabic GEC systems, making our approach more practical for real-world applications. Finally, we... | Bashar Alhafni, Nizar Habash |  |

Large-scale standardized collections of multilingual wordlists and grammatical language structures might help to improve this and open new avenues for developing automated language affiliation workflows. Here, we present neural network models that use lexical and grammatical data from a worldwide sample of more than 1,200 languages with known affiliations to classify individual languages into families. In line with the traditional assumption of most linguists, our results show that models trained on lexical data alone outperform models solely based on grammatical data, whereas combining both types of data yields even better performance. In additional experiments, we show how our models can identify long-ranging relations between entire subgroups, how they can be employed to investigate... | Frederic Blum, Steffen Herbold, JohannMattis List |  |

Although backdoor attacks against LLMs are constantly emerging, existing benchmarks remain limited in terms of sufficient coverage of attack, metric system integrity, backdoor attack alignment. And existing pre-trained backdoor attacks are idealized in practice due to resource access constraints. Therefore we establish ELBA-Bench, a comprehensive and unified framework that allows attackers to inject backdoor through parameter efficient fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA) or without fine-tuning techniques (e.g., In-context-learning). ELBA-Bench provides over 1300 experiments encompassing the implementations of 12 attack methods, 18 datasets, and 12 LLMs. Extensive experiments provide new invaluable findings into the strengths and limitations of various attack strategies.

While much focus has been placed on aligning dialogues with provided personas, the adaptation to the interlocutor’s profile remains largely underexplored. In this work, we investigate three key aspects: (1) a model’s ability to align responses with both the provided persona and the interlocutor’s; (2) its robustness when dealing with familiar versus unfamiliar interlocutors and topics, and (3) the impact of additional fine-tuning on specific persona-based dialogues. We evaluate dialogues generated with diverse speaker pairings and topics, framing the evaluation as an author identification task and employing both LLM-as-a-judge and human evaluations. By systematically masking or disclosing information about interlocutor, we assess its impact on dialogue generation. Results show that access to the interlocutor’s persona improves the recognition of the... | Daniela Occhipinti, Marco Guerini, Malvina Nissim |  |

Existing hallucination detection methods leveraging hidden states predominantly focus on static and isolated representations, overlooking their dynamic evolution across layers, which limits efficacy. To address this limitation, we shift the focus to the hidden state update process and introduce a novel metric, the \*\*ICR\*\* Score (\*\*I\*\*nformation \*\*C\*\*ontribution to \*\*R\*\*esidual Stream), which quantifies the contribution of modules to the hidden states’ update. We empirically validate that the ICR Score is effective and reliable in distinguishing hallucinations. Building on these insights, we propose a hallucination detection method, the ICR Probe, which captures the cross-layer evolution of hidden states. Experimental results show that the ICR Probe achieves superior performance with significantly fewer parameters.... | Zhenliang Zhang, Xinyu Hu, Huixuan Zhang, Junzhe Zhang, Xiaojun Wan |  |

Recently, the concept of self-debugging has been proposed as a way to enhance code generation performance by leveraging execution feedback from tests. However, the availability of high-quality tests in real-world scenarios is often limited. In this context, self-debugging with self-generated tests emerges as a promising solution, though its limitations and practical potential have not been fully explored. To address this gap, we investigate the efficacy of self-debugging in code generation tasks. We propose and analyze two distinct paradigms for the self-debugging process: post-execution and in-execution self-debugging. Our findings reveal that post-execution self-debugging struggles with the test bias introduced by self-generated tests, which can lead to misleading feedback.

Prior work has attempted to mitigate this semantic inconsistency between speech and text representations through techniques such as representation and behavior alignment, which involve the meticulous design of data pairs during the post-training phase. In this paper, we introduce a simple and scalable training method called InSerter, which stands for Interleaved Speech-Text Representation Pre-training. InSerter is designed to pre-train large-scale unsupervised speech-text sequences, where the speech is synthesized from randomly selected segments of an extensive text corpus using text-to-speech conversion.

With the rise and pervasiveness of generative AI tools, and particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), concerns arise regarding how these tools capture and potentially alter moral dimensions through machine-generated text manipulation. Based on the Moral Foundation Theory, our work investigates this topic by analyzing the behavior of 12 LLMs among the most widely used Open and uncensored (i.e., ”abliterated”) models, and leveraging human-annotated datasets used in moral-related analysis. Results have shown varying levels of alteration of moral expressions depending on the type of text modification task and moral-related conditioning prompt. | Candida Maria Greco, Lucio La Cava, Lorenzo Zangari, Andrea Tagarelli |  |

In particular, cross-prompt essay trait scoring provides learners with valuable feedback to improve their writing skills. However, due to the scarcity of prompts, most existing methods overlook critical information, such as content from prompts or essays, resulting in incomplete assessment perspectives. In this paper, we propose a robust AES framework, the Mixture of Ordered Scoring Experts (MOOSE), which integrates information from both prompts and essays. MOOSE employs three specialized experts to evaluate (1) the overall quality of an essay, (2) the relative quality across multiple essays, and (3) the relevance between an essay and its prompt. MOOSE introduces the ordered aggregation of assessment results from these experts along with effective feature learning techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that MOOSE achieves exceptionally stable and state-of-the-art performance in both cross-prompt scoring... | PoKai Chen, BoWei Tsai, ShaoKuan Wei, ChienYao Wang, JiaChing Wang, YiTing Huang |  |

However, successfully applying this to pre-training remains largely unexplored. In this work, we prove that naive approaches for sparse knowledge distillation such as caching Top-K probabilities, while intuitive, provide biased estimates of teacher probability distribution to the student, resulting in suboptimal performance and calibration. We propose an importance-sampling-based method ‘Random Sampling Knowledge Distillation’, which provides unbiased estimates, preserves the gradient in expectation, and requires storing significantly sparser logits. Our method enables faster training of student models with marginal overhead (<10%) compared to cross-entropy based training, while maintaining competitive performance compared to full distillation, across a range of model sizes from 300M to 3B. | Anshumann, Mohd Abbas Zaidi, Akhil Kedia, Jinwoo Ahn, Taehwak Kwon, Kangwook Lee, Haejun Lee, Joohyung Lee |  |

For example, speakers perform hand gestures to indicate topic shifts, helping listeners identify transitions in discourse. In this work, we investigate whether the joint modeling of gestures using human motion sequences and language can improve spoken discourse modeling in language models. To integrate gestures into language models, we first encode 3D human motion sequences into discrete gesture tokens using a VQ-VAE. These gesture token embeddings are then aligned with text embeddings through feature alignment, mapping them into the text embedding space. To evaluate the gesture-aligned language model on spoken discourse, we construct text infilling tasks targeting three key discourse cues grounded in linguistic research: discourse connectives, stance markers, and quantifiers. Results show that incorporating gestures enhances marker prediction accuracy across the three tasks,... | Varsha Suresh, Muhammad Hamza Mughal, Christian Theobalt, Vera Demberg |  |

As libraries continuously evolve, it becomes impractical to exhaustively retrain LLMs with new API knowledge. This limitation hampers LLMs from solving programming problems which require newly introduced or privately maintained libraries. Inspired by exploratory programming paradigm in human behavior, we propose \*\*ExploraCoder\*\*, a training-free framework that empowers LLMs to invoke multiple unseen APIs in code solution by (1) planning a complex problem into several API invocation subtasks, and (2) experimenting with correct API usage at intermediate steps through a novel chain-of-API-exploration. We conduct evaluation on program synthesizing tasks involving complex API interactions. Experimental results demonstrate that ExploraCoder significantly improves performance for models lacking prior API knowledge, achieving absolute increases of up to 11.99% over... | Yunkun Wang, Yue Zhang, Zhen Qin, Chen Zhi, Binhua Li, Fei Huang, Yongbin Li, Shuiguang Deng |  |

Explore the Limit of Unsupervised Word Segmentation with Large Language Models](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.888/) |  | 0 | Word segmentation stands as a cornerstone of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Based on the concept of “comprehend first, segment later”, we propose a new framework to explore the limit of unsupervised word segmentation with Large Language Models (LLMs) and evaluate the semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs based on word segmentation. We employ current mainstream LLMs to perform word segmentation across multiple languages to assess LLMs’ “comprehension”. Our findings reveal that LLMs are capable of following simple prompts to segment raw text into words. There is a trend suggesting that models with more parameters tend to perform better on multiple languages. Additionally, we introduce a novel unsupervised method, termed LLACA (Large Language Model-Inspired Aho-Corasick Automaton). Leveraging the advanced pattern recognition capabilities of Aho-Corasick automata, LLACA innovatively combines these with the deep insights of well-pretrained LLMs. This approach not only enables the... | Zihong Zhang, Liqi He, Zuchao Li, Lefei Zhang, Hai Zhao, Bo Du |  |

As the subtask of Multi-Hop Question Generation (MHQG), the task of Multi-Constraint Multi-Hop Question Generation (MCHQG) is more aligned with human question theories. However, it is hard to determine how to bring various high-dimensional semantic constraints, and how to integrate each constraint across all hops when a multi-hop question is being generating. To address these challenges, we introduce an effective framework which includes constraint dimensionality reduction and divide-and-conquer-based dynamic projection; we call it RUBY. The proposed RUBY contains a module of high-dimensional semantic constraint dimension reduction and a module of sub-question answer pairs-based multi-hop question generation. Meanwhile, a Reasoning Dynamic Projection strategy is tailored to effectively incorporate the... | Wenzhuo Zhao, Shuangyin Li |  |

To defend against such attacks, recent studies have developed various detection mechanisms. If we restrict ourselves specifically to works which perform detection rather than direct defense, most of them focus on direct prompt injection attacks, while there are few works for the indirect scenario, where injected instructions are indirectly from external tools, such as a search engine. Moreover, current works mainly investigate injection detection methods and pay less attention to the post-processing method that aims to mitigate the injection after detection.In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of detecting and removing indirect prompt... | Yulin Chen, Haoran Li, Yuan Sui, Yufei He, Yue Liu, Yangqiu Song, Bryan Hooi |  |

A wide variety of architectures and benchmarks havebeen proposed with often near-perfect performance. Although previousstudies have focused on certain challenging setups (i.e. cross-domain, shortinputs), a systematic comparison is missing. We propose a benchmark that allows us to test for the effect of input size, training data size, domain, number oflanguages, scripts, and language families on performance. We evaluatefive popular models on this benchmark and identify which open challengesremain for this task as well as which architectures achieve robust performance. Wefind that cross-domain setups are the most challenging (although arguably mostrelevant), and that number of languages, variety in scripts, and variety inlanguage families have only a small impact on performance. We also contributepractical takeaways: training with 1,000 instances per language and a maximuminput length... | Rob van der Goot |  |

In this paper, we shed light on this core issue and formulate the distracting effect of a passage w.r.t. a query (and an LLM). We provide a quantifiable measure of the distracting effect of a passage and demonstrate its robustness across LLMs. Our research introduces novel methods for identifying and using hard distracting passages to improve RAG systems. By fine-tuning LLMs with these carefully selected distracting passages, we achieve up to a 7.5% increase in answering accuracy compared to counterparts fine-tuned on conventional RAG datasets. Our contribution is two-fold: first, we move beyond the simple binary classification of irrelevant passages as either completely unrelated vs. distracting, and second, we develop and analyze multiple methods for finding hard distracting... | Chen Amiraz, Florin Cuconasu, Simone Filice, Zohar S.

This situation is exacerbated by the fact that modern LLMs such as LLaMA and Qwen support far fewer languages than XLM-R, making text generation models non-existent for many languages in the world. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel framework for adapting multilingual encoders to text generation in extremely low-resource languages. By reusing the weights between the encoder and the decoder, our framework allows the model to leverage the learned semantic space of the encoder, enabling efficient learning and effective generalization in low-resource languages. Applying this framework to four Chinese minority languages, we present XLM-SWCM, and demonstrate its superior performance on various downstream tasks even when compared with much larger models. | Zeli Su, Ziyin Zhang, Guixian Xu, Jianing Liu, Xu Han, Ting Zhang, Yushuang Dong |  |

Traditional Abusive Language Detection (ALD) models often overlook this context, which can lead to unreliable performance metrics. Recent Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches that incorporate conversational context often rely on limited or overly simplified representations of this context, leading to inconsistent and sometimes inconclusive results. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that utilizes graph neural networks (GNNs) to model social media conversations as graphs, where nodes represent comments, and edges capture reply structures. We systematically investigate various graph representations and context windows to identify the optimal configurations for ALD. Our GNN model outperforms both context-agnostic baselines and linear context-aware... | Célia Nouri, Chloé Clavel, JeanPhilippe Cointet |  |

Current methods, such as instruction-enhanced reasoning and supervised fine-tuning, often result in unnecessarily long reasoning paths and face difficulties in verifying the correctness of intermediate steps. In this paper, we propose CodeTool, a novel framework for stepwise code generation that improves LLM tool invocation by leveraging the concise and easily verifiable nature of code. CodeTool incorporates two distinct process rewards: the On-the-spot Reward, which provides immediate feedback on the accuracy of each tool invocation, and the Latent Reward, which assesses the contribution of each step toward overall task completion. By maximizing the cumulative reward of the On-the-spot and Latend Rewards at each step, LLMs are guided to follow efficient and accurate reasoning paths.

RARE incorporates two innovative actions within the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework: (A6), which generates search queries based on the initial problem statement, performs information retrieval using those queries, and augments reasoning with the retrieved data to formulate the final answer; and (A7), which leverages information retrieval specifically for generated sub-questions and re-answers these sub-questions with the relevant contextual information. Additionally, a Retrieval-Augmented Factuality Scorer is proposed to replace the original discriminator, prioritizing reasoning paths that meet high standards of factuality.

However, as LLMs continue to evolve, new vulnerabilities, especially prompt injection attacks arise. These attacks trick LLMs into deviating from the original input instructions and executing the attacker’s instructions injected in data content, such as retrieved results. Recent attack methods leverage LLMs’ instruction-following abilities and their inabilities to distinguish instructions injected in the data content, and achieve a high attack success rate (ASR). When comparing the attack and defense methods, we interestingly find that they share similar design goals, of inducing the model to ignore unwanted instructions and instead to execute wanted instructions. Therefore, we raise an intuitive question: \*Could these attack techniques be utilized for defensive... | Yulin Chen, Haoran Li, Zihao Zheng, Dekai Wu, Yangqiu Song, Bryan Hooi |  |

However, effectively integrating new knowledge into LLMs remains a major challenge. Current research typically first constructs novel knowledge datasets and then injects this knowledge into LLMs through various techniques. However, existing methods for constructing new datasets either rely on timestamps, which lack rigor, or use simple templates for synthesis, which are simplistic and do not accurately reflect the real world. To address this issue, we propose a novel knowledge dataset construction approach that simulates biological evolution using knowledge graphs to generate synthetic entities with diverse attributes, resulting in a dataset, NovelHuman. Systematic analysis on NovelHuman reveals that the intra-sentence position of knowledge significantly affects the acquisition of... | Ziyu Shang, Jianghan Liu, Zhizhao Luo, Peng Wang, Wenjun Ke, Jiajun Liu, Zijie Xu, Guozheng Li |  |

DNCASR uses two separate encoders to independently encode global speaker characteristics and local waveform information, along with two linked decoders to generate speaker-attributed transcriptions. The use of linked decoders allows the entire system to be jointly trained under a unified loss function. By employing a serialised training approach, DNCASR effectively addresses overlapping speech in real-world meetings, where the link improves the prediction of speaker indices in overlapping segments. Experiments on the AMI-MDM meeting corpus demonstrate that the jointly trained DNCASR outperforms a parallel system that does not have links between the speaker and ASR decoders. Using cpWER to measure the speaker-attributed word error rate, DNCASR achieves a 9.0%... | Xianrui Zheng, Chao Zhang, Philip C. Woodland |  |

However, while LLMs can effectively generate personalized responses, the influence of persona sentiment on dialogue quality remains underexplored. In this work, we conduct a large-scale analysis of dialogues generated using a range of polarized user profiles. Our experiments reveal that dialogues involving negatively polarized users tend to overemphasize persona attributes. In contrast, positively polarized profiles yield dialogues that selectively incorporate persona information, resulting in smoother interactions. Furthermore, we find that personas with weak or neutral sentiment generally produce lower-quality dialogues. Motivated by these findings, we propose a dialogue generation approach that explicitly accounts for persona polarity by combining a turn-based generation strategy with a profile ordering mechanism and sentiment-aware prompting.... | Yonghyun Jun, Hwanhee Lee |  |

Existing studies solve this challenge by updating benchmarks with newly collected data. However, they fail to guarantee contamination-free evaluation as the newly collected data may contain pre-existing knowledge, and their benchmark updates rely on intensive human labor. To address these issues, we in this paper propose AntiLeak-Bench, an automated anti-leakage benchmarking framework. Instead of simply using newly collected data, we construct samples with explicitly new knowledge absent from LLMs’ training sets, which thus ensures strictly contamination-free evaluation. We further design a fully automated workflow to build and update our benchmark without human labor. This significantly reduces the cost of benchmark maintenance to accommodate emerging LLMs. Through extensive experiments, we highlight that data contamination likely exists before LLMs’ cutoff time and demonstrate... | Xiaobao Wu, Liangming Pan, Yuxi Xie, Ruiwen Zhou, Shuai Zhao, Yubo Ma, Mingzhe Du, Rui Mao, Anh Tuan Luu, William Yang Wang |  |

The advanced comprehension and generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have introduced new avenues for topic modeling, particularly by prompting LLMs to generate topics and refine them by merging similar ones. However, this approach necessitates that LLMs generate topics with consistent granularity, thus relying on the exceptional instruction-following capabilities of closed-source LLMs (such as GPT-4) or requiring additional training. Moreover, merging based only on topic words and neglecting the fine-grained semantics within documents might fail to fully uncover the underlying topic structure. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised topic modeling method, LiSA, that combines LLMs with clustering to improve topic generation and distribution. Specifically, we begin with prompting LLMs to generate a candidate topic word for each document, thereby constructing a topic-level semantic space.

We show that the existing 4-bit projective encoding belongs to this family, but it is suboptimal in the number of labels used to encode a tree. We derive an optimal hierarchical bracketing, which minimizes the number of symbols used and encodes projective trees using only 12 distinct labels (vs. 16 for the 4-bit encoding). We also extend optimal hierarchical bracketing to support arbitrary non-projectivity in a more compact way than previous encodings. Our new encodings yield competitive accuracy on a diverse set of treebanks. | Ana Ezquerro, David Vilares, Anssi YliJyrä, Carlos GómezRodríguez |  |

Previous training primarily relies on optimizing the InfoNCE loss by comparing positive natural language (NL)-code pairs with in-batch negatives. However, due to the sparse nature of code contexts, training solely by comparing the major differences between positive and negative pairs may fail to capture deeper semantic nuances. To address this issue, we propose a novel order-augmented strategy for improved code search (OASIS). It leverages order-based similarity labels to train models to capture subtle differences in similarity among negative pairs. Extensive benchmark evaluations demonstrate that our OASIS model significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art models focusing solely on major positive-negative differences. It underscores the value of exploiting subtle differences among negative pairs with order labels... | Zuchen Gao, Zizheng Zhan, Xianming Li, Erxin Yu, Haotian Zhang, Chenbin Chenbin, Yuqun Zhang, Jing Li |  |

In this paper, to understand the qualities of these long CoTs and measure the critique abilities of existing LLMs on these long CoTs, we introduce the DeltaBench including the generated long CoTs from different o1-like models (e.g., QwQ, DeepSeek-R1) for different reasoning tasks (e.g., Math, Code, General Reasoning), to measure the ability to detect errors in long COT reasoning. Based on DeltaBench, we first perform fine-grained analysis of the generated long CoTs to discover the effectiveness and efficiency of different o1-like models. Then, we conduct extensive evaluations of existing process reward models (PRMs) and critic models to detect the errors of each annotated process, which aims to investigate the boundaries and limitations of existing PRMs and critic models.... | Yancheng He, Shilong Li, Jiaheng Liu, Weixun Wang, Xingyuan Bu, Ge Zhang, Z.

Knowledge graphs (KGs) help by structuring entities, relations, and contextual dependencies, but building KGs in such domains is challenging due to inherent complexity, manual effort, and rapid evolution. Inspired by how humans organize knowledge hierarchically, we propose Tree-KG, an expandable framework that combines structured domain texts with advanced semantic techniques. First, Tree-KG builds a tree-like graph from textbook structures using large language models (LLMs) and domain-specific entities, creating an explicit KG. Then, through iterative expansion with flexible, predefined operators, it uncovers hidden KG while preserving semantic coherence. Experiments demonstrate that Tree-KG consistently surpasses competing methods, achieving the highest F1 scores (12–16% above the second-best), with notable performance (F1 0.81) on the Text-Annotated... | Songjie Niu, Kaisen Yang, Rui Zhao, Yichao Liu, Zonglin Li, Hongning Wang, Wenguang Chen |  |

Existing studies have explored various diversity-aware data selection methods to construct high-quality datasets and enhance model performance. However, the fundamental problem of precisely defining and measuring data diversity remains underexplored, limiting clear guidance for data engineering. To address this, we systematically analyze 11 existing diversity measurement methods by evaluating their correlation with model performance through extensive fine-tuning experiments. Our results indicate that a reliable diversity measure should properly account for both inter-sample differences and the information density in the sample space. Building on this, we propose NovelSum, a new diversity metric based on sample-level “novelty.” Experiments on both simulated and real-world data show that NovelSum accurately captures diversity variations and achieves a 0.97 correlation with instruction-tuned model performance,... | Yuming Yang, Yang Nan, Junjie Ye, Shihan Dou, Xiao Wang, Shuo Li, Huijie Lv, Tao Gui, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang |  |

It adversely affects performance on downstream tasks such as question answering (QA). Existing approaches often attempt to mitigate conflicts by directly comparing two knowledge sources in a side-by-side manner, but this can overwhelm LLMs with extraneous or lengthy contexts, ultimately hindering their ability to identify and mitigate inconsistencies. To address this issue, we propose \*\*Micro-Act\*\* a framework with a hierarchical action space that automatically perceives context complexity and adaptively decomposes each knowledge source into a sequence of fine-grained comparisons. These comparisons are represented as actionable steps, enabling reasoning beyond the superficial context.

Existing methods do not have wide language coverage, fail to account for the diverse range of CS phenomena, or do not scale. We propose an intervention based on minimal pairs of CS. Each minimal pair contains one naturally occurring CS sentence and one minimally manipulated variant. We collect up to 1,000 such pairs each for 11 language pairs. Our human experiments show that, for every language pair, bilinguals consistently prefer the naturally occurring CS sentence. Meanwhile our experiments with current LLMs show that the larger the model, the more consistently it assigns higher probability to the naturally occurring CS sentence than to the variant. In accordance with theoretical claims, the largest probability differences arise in those pairs where the manipulated material consisted of closed-class words. | Igor Sterner, Simone Teufel |  |

While prompt-based TTS methods facilitate controllable speech generation, existing TTS datasets lack situated descriptive prompts aligned with speech data. To address this data scarcity, we develop an automatic annotation pipeline enabling multifaceted alignment among speech clips, content text, and their respective descriptions. Based on this pipeline, we present DNASpeech, a novel CS-TTS dataset with high-quality speeches with DNA prompt annotations. DNASpeech contains 2,395 distinct characters, 4,452 scenes, and 22,975 dialogue utterances, along with over 18 hours of high-quality speech recordings.

Recent advancements have showcased the potential of building intelligent spoken chatbots based on large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we introduce LLaMA-Omni 2, a series of speech language models (SpeechLMs) ranging from 0.5B to 14B parameters, capable of achieving high-quality real-time speech interaction. LLaMA-Omni 2 is built upon the Qwen2.5 series models, integrating a speech encoder and an autoregressive streaming speech decoder. Despite being trained on only 200K multi-turn speech dialogue samples, LLaMA-Omni 2 demonstrates strong performance on several spoken question answering and speech instruction following benchmarks, surpassing previous state-of-the-art SpeechLMs like GLM-4-Voice, which was trained on millions of hours of speech data. | Qingkai Fang, Yan Zhou, Shoutao Guo, Shaolei Zhang, Yang Feng |  |

However, this fine-tuning process only compares current predictions and labels on each sample, yet fails to perceive and understand its error outputs from different degrees, which may potentially produce a large percentage of serious errors. This poses a problem for aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) in that these serious errors bring a greater negative impact than acceptable ones. Humans tend to compare mistakes to understand the varying degrees of mistakes, thus avoiding major bad decisions. Inspired by this, we propose a simple yet effective framework that could perceive and understand the degree of different errors by learning from comparative error pairs. It utilizes the SFT model to yield multiple outputs on each sample and selects acceptable and severe errors based on the acceptable scores. Together with the labels, we construct two comparative error... | Qianlong Wang, Keyang Ding, Hengxin Gao, Hui Wang, Ruifeng Xu |  |

While previous research has highlighted the interaction between SES and language technology, it was limited by reliance on proxy metrics and synthetic data. We survey 1,000 individuals from ‘diverse socioeconomic backgrounds’ about their use of language technologies and generative AI, and collect 6,482 prompts from their previous interactions with LLMs. We find systematic differences across SES groups in language technology usage (i.e., frequency, performed tasks), interaction styles, and topics. Higher SES entail a higher level of abstraction, convey requests more concisely, and topics like ‘inclusivity’ and ‘travel’. Lower SES correlates with higher anthropomorphization of LLMs (using ”hello” and ”thank you”) and more concrete language. Our findings suggest that while generative language technologies are becoming... | Elisa Bassignana, Amanda Cercas Curry, Dirk Hovy |  |

This work investigates whether large language models (LLMs) capture discourse knowledge that generalizes across languages and frameworks. We address this question along two dimensions: (1) developing a unified discourse relation label set to facilitate cross-lingual and cross-framework discourse analysis, and (2) probing LLMs to assess whether they encode generalizable discourse abstractions. Using multilingual discourse relation classification as a testbed, we examine a comprehensive set of 23 LLMs of varying sizes and multilingual capabilities. Our results show that LLMs, especially those with multilingual training corpora, can generalize discourse information across languages and frameworks. Further layer-wise analyses reveal that language generalization at the discourse level is most salient in the intermediate layers. Lastly, our... | Florian Eichin, Yang Janet Liu, Barbara Plank, Michael A. Hedderich |  |

Creating SEA-VL, a Multicultural Vision-Language Dataset for Southeast Asia](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.916/) |  | 0 | Despite Southeast Asia’s (SEA) extraordinary linguistic and cultural diversity, the region remains significantly underrepresented in vision-language (VL) research, resulting in AI models that inadequately capture SEA cultural nuances. To fill this gap, we present SEA-VL, an open-source initiative dedicated to developing culturally relevant high-quality datasets for SEA languages. By involving contributors from SEA countries, SEA-VL ensures better cultural relevance and diversity, fostering greater inclusivity of underrepresented languages and cultural depictions in VL research. Our methodology employed three approaches: community-driven crowdsourcing with SEA contributors, automated image crawling, and synthetic image generation. We evaluated each method’s effectiveness in capturing cultural relevance. We found that image crawling achieves approximately ~85% cultural relevance while being more cost- and time-efficient than crowdsourcing, whereas synthetic image generation failed to... | Samuel Cahyawijaya, Holy Lovenia, Joel Ruben Antony Moniz, Tack Hwa Wong, Mohammad Rifqi Farhansyah, Thant Thiri Maung, Frederikus Hudi, David Anugraha, Muhammad Ravi Shulthan Habibi, Muhammad Reza Qorib, Amit Agarwal, Joseph Marvin Imperial, Hitesh Laxmichand Patel, Vicky Feliren, Bahrul Ilmi Nasution, Manuel Antonio Rufino, Genta Indra Winata, Rian Adam Rajagede, Carlos Rafael Catalan, Mohamed Fazli Mohamed Imam, Priyaranjan Pattnayak, Salsabila Zahirah Pranida, Kevin Pratama, Yeshil Bangera, Adisai NaThalang, Patricia Nicole Monderin, Yueqi Song, Christian Simon, Lynnette Hui Xian Ng, Richardy Lobo' Sapan, Taki Hasan Rafi, Bin Wang, Supryadi, Kanyakorn Veerakanjana, Piyalitt Ittichaiwong, Matthew Theodore Roque, Karissa Vincentio, Takdanai Kreangphet, Phakphum Artkaew, Kadek Hendrawan Palgunadi, Yanzhi Yu, Rochana Prih Hastuti, William Nixon, Mithil Bangera, Adrian Xuan Wei Lim, Aye Hninn Khine, Hanif Muhammad Zhafran, Teddy Ferdinan, Audra Aurora Izzani, Ayushman Singh, Evan, Jauza Akbar Krito, Michael Anugraha, Fenal Ashokbhai Ilasariya, Haochen Li, John Amadeo Daniswara, Filbert Aurelian Tjiaranata, Eryawan Presma Yulianrifat, Can Udomcharoenchaikit, Fadil Risdian Ansori, Mahardika Krisna Ihsani, Giang Nguyen, Anab Maulana Barik, Dan John Velasco, Rifo Ahmad Genadi, Saptarshi Saha, Chengwei Wei, Isaiah Edri W.

We focus on two fundamental problems between speech and text: the representation space gap and sequence length inconsistency. We propose Soundwave, which utilizes an efficient training strategy and a novel architecture to address these issues. Results show that Soundwave outperforms other advanced speech LLMs in speech translation and AIR-Bench speech tasks with only a fraction of the training data. Further analysis shows that Soundwave still retains its intelligence during conversation. | Yuhao Zhang, Zhiheng Liu, Fan Bu, Ruiyu Zhang, Benyou Wang, Haizhou Li |  |

While zero-shot order-invariant LMs have been proposed to solve this issue, their success on practical listwise problems has been limited. In this work, as a first contribution, we identify and overcome two limitations to make zero-shot invariant LMs more practical: (1) training and inference distribution mismatch arising from modifying positional ID assignments to enforce invariance, and (2) failure to adapt to mixture of order-invariant and sensitive inputs in practical listwise problems. Then, to overcome these issues we propose (1) RoToR, a zero-shot invariant LM for genuinely order-invariant inputs with minimal modifications of positional IDs, and (2) Selective Routing, an adaptive framework that handles both order-invariant and order-sensitive inputs in listwise tasks.

However, translation introduces language bias and carries over cultural and regional assumptions from the original questions – often testing knowledge irrelevant to the target audience. In this work, we highlight the extent and impact of these biases and present a multilingual evaluation framework that aims to mitigate them through improved translations and annotation practices.Through a large-scale study involving professional and community translators and annotators, we show that state-of-the-art models excel primarily by learning Western-centric concepts. Notably, we find that model rankings on the full MMLU change when evaluated on a subset of questions explicitly marked as culturally sensitive.We release Global MMLU, a multilingual extension of MMLU across 42 languages, featuring improved... | Shivalika Singh, Angelika Romanou, Clémentine Fourrier, David Ifeoluwa Adelani, Jian Gang Ngui, Daniel VilaSuero, Peerat Limkonchotiwat, Kelly Marchisio, Wei Qi Leong, Yosephine Susanto, Raymond Ng, Shayne Longpre, Sebastian Ruder, WeiYin Ko, Antoine Bosselut, Alice Oh, André F.

However, linguistic features in dialogues, such as omission and idiom, frequently introduce ambiguities that obscure the intended discourse relations, posing significant challenges for parsers. To address this issue, we propose a Discourse-aware Clarification Module (DCM) to enhance the performance of the dialogue discourse parser. DCM employs two distinct reasoning processes: clarification type reasoning and discourse goal reasoning. The former analyzes linguistic features, while the latter distinguishes the intended relation from the ambiguous one. Furthermore, we introduce Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) to mitigate the risk of erroneous clarifications, thereby reducing cascading errors. CPO enables the parser to assess the contributions of the clarifications from DCM and provide feedback to optimize the DCM, enhancing its adaptability and alignment... | Yaxin Fan, Peifeng Li, Qiaoming Zhu |  |

Previous delta-sparsification methods either remove parameters randomly or truncate singular vectors directly after singular value decomposition (SVD). However, these methods either disregard parameter importance entirely or evaluate it with too coarse a granularity. In this work, we introduce ImPart, a novel importance-aware delta sparsification approach. Leveraging SVD, it dynamically adjusts sparsity ratios of different singular vectors based on their importance, effectively retaining crucial task-specific knowledge even at high sparsity ratios. Experiments show that ImPart achieves state-of-the-art delta sparsification performance, demonstrating 2× higher compression ratio than baselines at the same performance level.

These dimensions impact various aspects of our lives from social competence and emotion regulation to success in the work place and how we view the world. More recent work has started to explore how these dimensions develop, why they have developed, and what they constitute. Of particular note, is the finding that warmth has two distinct components: Trust (T) and Sociability (S). In this work, we introduce Words of Warmth, the first large-scale repository of manually derived word–warmth (as well as word–trust and word–sociability) associations for over 26k English words. We show that the associations are highly reliable. We use the lexicons to study the rate at which children acquire WCTS words with age.

Finding examples that show meaningful, generalizable differences between two LMs is crucial to understanding where one model succeeds and another fails. Can this process be done automatically? In this work, we propose methodology for automated comparison of language models that uses performance-aware contextual embeddings to find fine-grained features of text where one LM outperforms another. Our method, which we name BehaviorBox, extracts coherent features that demonstrate differences with respect to the ease of generation between two LMs. Specifically, BehaviorBox finds features that describe groups of words in fine-grained contexts, such as “conditional ‘were’ in the phrase ‘if you were’” and “exclamation marks after emotional statements”, where one model outperforms another within a particular datatset.

Most existing researchers focus on enhancing reward models through data improvements, following the conventional training framework for reward models that directly optimizes the predicted rewards.In this paper, we propose a hybrid alignment framework \*\*HAF-RM\*\* for reward model training by introducing an additional constraint on token-level policy probabilities in addition to the reward score. It can simultaneously supervise the internal preference model at the token level and optimize the mapping layer of the reward model at the sequence level.Experiment results on five datasets sufficiently show the validity and effectiveness of our proposed hybrid framework for training a high-quality reward model.By decoupling the reward modeling procedure and incorporating hybrid supervision, our \*\*HAF-RM\*\* framework offers a principled and effective... | Shujun Liu, Xiaoyu Shen, Yuhang Lai, Siyuan Wang, Shengbin Yue, Zengfeng Huang, Xuanjing Huang, Zhongyu Wei |  |

However, existing emotion benchmarks suffer fromtwo major shortcomings: (1) they largely rely on keyword-based emotion recognition, overlooking crucial cultural dimensions required fordeeper emotion understanding, and (2) many are created by translating English-annotated data into other languages, leading to potentially unreliable evaluation. To address these issues, we introduce Cultural Lenses on Emotion (CuLEmo), the first benchmark designedto evaluate culture-aware emotion prediction across six languages: Amharic, Arabic, English, German, Hindi, and Spanish. CuLEmocomprises 400 crafted questions per language, each requiring nuanced cultural reasoning and understanding.

However, these approaches still face challenges, such as limited scalability due to policy-specific value functions and latency during the inference phase. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Diffusion-styled Preference Optimization (DiffPO), which provides an efficient and policy-agnostic solution for aligning LLMs with humans. By directly performing alignment at sentence level, DiffPO avoids the time latency associated with token-level generation. Designed as a plug-and-play module, DiffPO can be seamlessly integrated with various base models to enhance their alignment. Extensive experiments on AlpacaEval 2, MT-bench, and HH-RLHF demonstrate that DiffPO achieves superior alignment performance across various settings, achieving a favorable trade-off between alignment quality and inference-time latency. Furthermore, DiffPO demonstrates model-agnostic scalability, significantly improving... | Ruizhe Chen, Wenhao Chai, Zhifei Yang, Xiaotian Zhang, Ziyang Wang, Tony Q. S.

However, existing benchmarks for meme understanding only concern narrow aspects of meme semantics. To fill this gap, we present MemeQA, a dataset of over 9,000 multiple-choice questions designed to holistically evaluate meme comprehension across seven cognitive aspects. Experiments show that state-of-the-art Large Multimodal Models perform much worse than humans on MemeQA. While fine-tuning improves their performance, they still make many errors on memes wherein proper understanding requires going beyond surface-level sentiment. Moreover, injecting “None of the above” into the available options makes the questions more challenging for the models.

A promising approach to mitigate this issue is enabling models to express uncertainty when unsure. Previous research on uncertainty modeling has primarily focused on short-form QA, but real-world applications often require much longer responses. In this work, we introduce the task of Long-form Generation with Uncertainty (LoGU). We identify two key challenges: Uncertainty Suppression, where models hesitate to express uncertainty, and Uncertainty Misalignment, where models convey uncertainty inaccurately. To tackle these challenges, we propose a refinement-based data collection framework and a two-stage training pipeline. Our framework adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy, refining uncertainty based on atomic claims.

However, their retrieval processes face two key challenges: (1) they can be disrupted by irrelevant documents or factually inaccurate chain-of-thoughts; (2) their retrievers are not designed to dynamically adapt to the evolving information needs in multi-step reasoning, making it difficult to identify and retrieve the missing information required at each iterative step. Therefore, we propose KiRAG, which uses a knowledge-driven iterative retriever model to enhance the retrieval process of iRAG. Specifically, KiRAG decomposes documents into knowledge triples and performs iterative retrieval with these triples to enable a factually reliable retrieval process. Moreover, KiRAG integrates reasoning into the retrieval process to dynamically identify and retrieve knowledge that bridges information gaps, effectively adapting to the evolving information needs.

While dense embeddings have dominated related research, we introduce the first lexicon-based embeddings (LENS) leveraging LLMs that achieve competitive performance on these tasks. LENS consolidates the vocabulary space through token embedding clustering to handle the issue of token redundancy in LLM vocabularies. To further improve performance, we investigate bidirectional attention and various pooling strategies. Specifically, LENS simplifies lexical matching with redundant vocabularies by assigning each dimension to a specific token cluster, where semantically similar tokens are grouped together. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LENS outperforms dense embeddings on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), delivering compact representations with dimensionality comparable to dense counterparts. Furthermore, LENS inherently supports efficient embedding... | Yibin Lei, Tao Shen, Yu Cao, Andrew Yates |  |

While Retrieval-Augmented Generation offers a promising solution by grounding generations in external knowledge, it offers no guarantee that the provided context will be effectively integrated. To address this, context-aware decoding strategies have been proposed to amplify the influence of relevant context, but they usually do not explicitly enforce faithfulness to the context. In this work, we introduce Confidence-guided Copy-based Decoding for Legal Text Generation (CoCoLex)—a decoding strategy that dynamically interpolates the model produced vocabulary distribution with a distribution derived based on copying from the context. CoCoLex encourages direct copying based on models’ confidence, ensuring greater fidelity to the source. Experimental results on five... | T. Y. S. S.

While these metrics are considered indicative (even if imperfect), of human evaluation for English, their suitability for other languages remains unclear. To address this, in this paper we systematically assess evaluation metrics for generation — both n-gram-based and neural-based— to assess their effectiveness across languages and tasks. Specifically, we design a large-scale evaluation suite across eight languages from four typological families — agglutinative, isolating, low-fusional, and high-fusional — from both low- and high-resource languages, to analyze their correlations with human judgments. Our findings highlight the sensitivity of the evaluation metric to the language type at hand. For example, for fusional languages, n-gram-based metrics demonstrate a lower correlation with human assessments, compared to isolating and agglutinative languages.

To address this, existing fine-tuning approaches operating at the data-level (e.g., through data augmentation or distillation) typically introduce implicit cross-lingual alignment, overlooking the potential for more profound, latent-level cross-lingual interactions. In this work, we propose CC-Tuning, a novel multilingual fine-tuning paradigm that explicitly establishes a cross-lingual connection mechanism at the latent level. During training, CC-Tuning fuses the feed forward activations from both English and non-English inputs, enabling the model to benefit from both linguistic resources. This process is facilitated with a trainable Decision Maker that identifies beneficial activations. Furthermore, during inference, a Transform Matrix is utilized to simulate the cross-lingual connection under monolingual setting through representation transformation.... | Yangfan Ye, Xiaocheng Feng, Zekun Yuan, Xiachong Feng, Libo Qin, Lei Huang, Weitao Ma, Yichong Huang, Zhirui Zhang, Yunfei Lu, Xiaohui Yan, Duyu Tang, Dandan Tu, Bing Qin |  |

Previous studies have introduced various criteria of conformal uncertainty grounded in split conformal prediction, which offer user-specified correctness coverage. However, existing frameworks often fail to identify uncertainty data outliers that violate the exchangeability assumption, leading to unbounded miscoverage rates and unactionable prediction sets. In this paper, we propose a novel approach termed Selective Conformal Uncertainty (SConU), which, for the first time, implements significance tests, by developing two conformal p-values that are instrumental in determining whether a given sample deviates from the uncertainty distribution of the calibration set at a specific manageable risk level.

In this paper, we introduce MegaPairs, a novel data synthesis method that leverages vision language models (VLMs) and open-domain images, together with a massive synthetic dataset generated from this method. Our empirical analysis shows that MegaPairs generates high-quality data, enabling the multimodal retriever to significantly outperform the baseline model trained on 70× more data from existing datasets. Moreover, since MegaPairs solely relies on general image corpora and open-source VLMs, it can be easily scaled up, enabling continuous improvements in retrieval performance. In this stage, we produced more than 26 million training instances and trained several models of varying sizes using this data. These new models achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot performance across 4 popular composed image retrieval (CIR) benchmarks and the highest... | Junjie Zhou, Yongping Xiong, Zheng Liu, Ze Liu, Shitao Xiao, Yueze Wang, Bo Zhao, Chen Jason Zhang, Defu Lian |  |

However, concerns over the potential leakage of knowledge files have grown significantly. Existing studies demonstrate that adversarial prompts can induce GPTs to leak knowledge file content. Yet, it remains uncertain whether additional leakage vectors exist, particularly given the complex data flows across clients, servers, and databases in GPTs. In this paper, we present a comprehensive risk assessment of knowledge file leakage, leveraging a novel workflow inspired by Data Security Posture Management (DSPM). Through the analysis of 651,022 GPT metadata, 11,820 flows, and 1,466 responses, we identify five leakage vectors: metadata, GPT initialization, retrieval, sandboxed execution environments, and prompts. These vectors enable adversaries to extract sensitive knowledge file data such as titles, content, types, and sizes.

The evolutionary trends from multi-layer residual vector quantizer to single-layer quantizer are beneficial for language-autoregressive decoding. However, the capability to handle multi-domain audio signals through a single codebook remains constrained by inter-domain distribution discrepancies. In this work, we introduce UniCodec, a unified audio codec with a single codebook to support multi-domain audio data, including speech, music, and sound. To achieve this, we propose a partitioned domain-adaptive codebook method based on domain Mixture-of-Experts strategy to capture the distinct characteristics of each audio domain. Furthermore, to enrich the semantic density of the codec without auxiliary modules, we propose a self-supervised mask prediction modeling approach.

Given a natural language question, KERL extracts entities, retrieves subgraphs from the KG, which are then fed into the LLM as context to select the recipes that satisfy the constraints. Next, our system generates the cooking steps and nutritional information for each recipe. To evaluate our approach, we also develop a benchmark dataset by curating recipe related questions, combined with constraints and personal preferences. Through extensive experiments, we show that our proposed KG-augmented LLM... | Fnu Mohbat, Mohammed J. Zaki |  |

These issues are particularly severe in multilingual settings, where no single model excels across all languages. In this study, we propose multilingual arbitration, which exploits performance variations among multiple models for each language. By strategically routing samples through a diverse set of models, each with unique strengths, we mitigate these challenges and enhance multilingual performance. Extensive experiments with state-of-the-art models demonstrate that our approach significantly surpasses single-teacher distillation, achieving up to 80% win rates over proprietary and open-weight models like Gemma 2, Llama 3.1, and Mistral v0.3, with the largest improvements in low-resource languages. | Ayomide Odumakinde, Daniel D'souza, Pat Verga, Beyza Ermis, Sara Hooker |  |

In this paper, we propose Controlled LoRA (CLoRA), a subspace regularization method on LoRA structure. Aiming to reduce the scale of output change while introducing minimal constraint on model capacity, CLoRA imposes constraints on the direction of updating matrix’s null space. Experimental results on one-stage LLM finetuning tasks and continual learning settings highlight the superiority of CLoRA as an effective parameter-efficient finetuning method with catastrophic forgetting mitigating. Further investigation for model parameters indicates that CLoRA effectively balances the trade-off between model capacity and degree of forgetting. The code for implementing CLoRA will be publicly available. | Yuheng Lu, Bingshuo Qian, Caixia Yuan, Huixing Jiang, Xiaojie Wang |  |

In this work, we present Chinese SimpleQA, the first comprehensive Chinese benchmark to evaluate the factuality ability of LLMs to answer short questions, and Chinese SimpleQA mainly has five properties (i.e., Chinese, Diverse, High-quality, Static, Easy-to-evaluate). Specifically, first, we focus on the Chinese language over 6 major topics with 99 diverse subtopics. Second, we conduct a comprehensive quality control process to achieve high-quality questions and answers, where the reference answers are static and cannot be changed over time. Third, following SimpleQA, the questions and answers are very short, and the grading process is easy-to-evaluate. Based on Chinese SimpleQA, we perform a comprehensive evaluation of the factuality abilities of existing LLMs. Finally, we hope that Chinese SimpleQA could guide the developers to better understand the Chinese factuality abilities of... | Yancheng He, Shilong Li, Jiaheng Liu, Yingshui Tan, Weixun Wang, Hui Huang, Xingyuan Bu, Hangyu Guo, Chengwei Hu, Boren Zheng, Zhuoran Lin, Dekai Sun, Zhicheng Zheng, Wenbo Su, Bo Zheng |  |

With recent advancements in artificial intelligence, there is growing potential to develop persuasive systems that automatically generate persuasive images tailored to individuals. However, a significant bottleneck in this area is the lack of comprehensivedatasets that connect the persuasiveness of images with the personal information about those who evaluated the images. To address this gap and facilitate technological advancements in personalized visual persuasion, we release the Personalized Visual Persuasion (PVP) dataset, comprising 28,454 persuasive images across 596 messages and 9 persuasion strategies. Importantly, the PVP dataset provides persuasiveness scores of images evaluated by 2,521 human annotators, along with their demographic and psychological characteristics (personality traits and values).

In this work, we formally define an emerging IR paradigm called Visualized Information Retrieval, or Vis-IR, where multimodal information, such as texts, images, tables and charts, is jointly represented by a unified visual format called Screenshots, for various retrieval applications. We further make three key contributions for Vis-IR. First, we create VIRA (Vis-IR Aggregation), a large-scale dataset comprising a vast collection of screenshots from diverse sources, carefully curated into captioned and question-answer formats. Second, we develop UniSE (Universal Screenshot Embeddings), a family of retrieval models that enable screenshots to query or be queried across arbitrary data modalities.

However, traditional methods often reinforce existing user interests, which leads to echo chambers and limits diversity. Proactive Recommendation Systems (PRS) aim to address this issue by cultivating users’ latent interests through multi-step recommendations. Despite advancements, challenges persist particularly in optimizing long-term rewards and adapting to real-time user feedback. In this study, we propose an LLM-based Actor-Critic Agent framework to enhance PRS. This framework utilizes the LLM-based agent to adjust recommendations in real time based on feedback and employs agent-tuning methods to optimize long-term rewards using three proposed reward functions. Extensive experiments validate the significant superiority of this framework over existing methods by optimizing long-term rewards and dynamically evolving with user feedback. | Mingze Wang, Chongming Gao, Wenjie Wang, Yangyang Li, Fuli Feng |  |

Hence, some recent work focus on fine-tuning the policy model with more diverse tasks to improve the generalizability. In this work, we find that finetuning a reward model to guide the policy model is more robust than directly finetuning the policy model.Based on this finding, we propose AgentRM, a 8B generalizable reward model, to guide the policy model for effective test-time search.We comprehensively investigate three approaches to construct the reward model, including explicit reward modeling, implicit reward modeling and LLM-as-a-judge.We then use AgentRM to guide the answer generation with Best-of-N sampling and beam search.We show that AgentRM is robust to paraphrasings of task instructions and can generalize to unseen tasks that require novel optimal behavior.Through extensive evaluation across nine tasks spanning four categories, AgentRM... | Yu Xia, Jingru Fan, Weize Chen, Siyu Yan, Xin Cong, Zhong Zhang, Yaxi Lu, Yankai Lin, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun |  |

However, existing dominant approaches using reward-guided search (RGS) primarily rely on outcome reward models (ORMs), which suffer from a critical granularity mismatch: ORMs are designed to provide outcome rewards for complete responses, while RGS methods rely on process rewards to guide the policy, leading to inconsistent scoring and suboptimal alignment. To address this challenge, we introduce process reward models (PRMs) into RGS and argue that an ideal PRM should satisfy two objectives: Score Consistency, ensuring coherent evaluation across partial and complete responses, and Preference Consistency, aligning partial sequence assessments with human preferences. Based on these, we propose SP-PRM, a novel dual-consistency framework integrating score consistency-based and preference consistency-based partial... | Bin Xie, Bingbing Xu, Yige Yuan, Shengmao Zhu, Huawei Shen |  |

Although GPTs can process the entire user prompt at once, the causal masking is applied to all input tokens step-by-step, mimicking the generation process. This imposes an unnecessary constraint during the initial “prefill” phase when the model processes the input prompt and generates the internal representations before producing any output tokens. In this work, attention is masked based on the known block structure at the prefill phase, followed by the conventional token-by-token autoregressive process after that. For example, in a typical chat prompt, the system prompt is treated as one block, and the user prompt as the next one. Each of these is treated as a unit for the purpose of masking, such that the first tokens in each block can access the subsequent tokens in a non-causal manner. Then, the model answer is generated in the conventional causal... | Shahar Katz, Liran Ringel, Yaniv Romano, Lior Wolf |  |

These approaches are focused on reduction of the amount of compute in existing language models rather than minimization of number of bits needed to store text. Despite relying on powerful models as encoders, the maximum attainable lossless compression ratio is typically not higher than x10. This fact is highly intriguing because, in theory, the maximum information capacity of large real-valued vectors is far beyond the presented rates even for 16-bit precision and a modest vector size. In this work, we explore the limits of compression by replacing the encoder with a per-sample optimization procedure. We show that vectors with compression ratios up to x1500 exist, which highlights two orders of magnitude gap between existing and practically attainable solutions. Furthermore, we empirically... | Yuri Kuratov, Mikhail Arkhipov, Aydar Bulatov, Mikhail Burtsev |  |

However, LLM-based generative sequential recommendation often faces two key challenges: the lack of collaborative knowledge and the limited controllability over the generated content. In this paper, we propose a simple Bi-Tuning framework with collaborative information for controllable Large Language Model-based Sequential Recommendation (Laser). Specifically, Bi-Tuning works through incorporating learnable virtual tokens at both the prefix and suffix of the input text, where the prefix tokens enable the adaptation of LLMs with collaborative information, while the suffix token transforms the LLM output into item/user embeddings for similarity comparison, thereby facilitating controllable recommendations. Furthermore, we introduce an MoE-based querying transformer that selectively activates experts to extract... | Xinyu Zhang, Linmei Hu, Luhao Zhang, Wentao Cheng, Yashen Wang, Ge Shi, Chong Feng, Liqiang Nie |  |

Small language models (SLMs) offer a cost-effective alternative, but their limited capacity requires biomedical domain adaptation, which remains challenging. An additional bottleneck is the unavailability and high sensitivity of clinical data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework for adapting SLMs into high-performing clinical models. We introduce the MediPhi collection of 3.8B-parameter SLMs developed with our novel framework: pre-instruction tuning of experts on relevant medical and clinical corpora (PMC, Medical Guideline, MedWiki, etc.), model merging, and clinical-tasks alignment. To cover most clinical tasks, we extended the CLUE benchmark to CLUE+, doubling its size. Our expert models deliver relative improvements on this benchmark over the base model without any task-specific fine-tuning: 64.3% on medical entities, 49.5% on... | JeanPhilippe Corbeil, Amin Dada, JeanMichel Attendu, Asma Ben Abacha, Alessandro Sordoni, Lucas Caccia, François Beaulieu, Thomas Lin, Jens Kleesiek, Paul Vozila |  |

Despite the inference efficiency of MoE LLMs, the training of extensive experts from scratch incurs substantial overhead, whereas reconstructing a dense LLM into an MoE LLM significantly reduces the training budget. However, existing reconstruction methods often overlook the diversity among experts, leading to potential redundancy. In this paper, we come up with the observation that a specific LLM exhibits notable diversity after being pruned on different calibration datasets, based on which we present a Diversity-Enhanced reconstruction method named DIVE. The recipe of DIVE includes domain affinity mining, pruning-based expert reconstruction, and efficient retraining. Specifically, the reconstruction includes pruning and reassembly of the feed-forward network (FFN) module. After reconstruction, we efficiently retrain the model... | Yuchen Feng, Bowen Shen, Naibin Gu, Jiaxuan Zhao, Peng Fu, Zheng Lin, Weiping Wang |  |

Existing methods predominantly rely on information entropy as the metric to compress lexical units, aiming to achieve minimal information loss. However, these approaches overlook two critical aspects: (i) the importance of attention-critical tokens at the algorithmic level, and (ii) shifts in information entropy during the compression process. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a dynamic attention-aware approach for task-agnostic prompt compression (DAC). This approach effectively integrates entropy and attention information, dynamically sensing entropy shifts during compression to achieve fine-grained prompt compression. Extensive experiments across various domains, including LongBench, GSM8K, and BBH, show that DAC consistently yields robust and substantial improvements across a... | Yi Zhao, Zuchao Li, Hai Zhao, Baoyuan Qi, Liu Guoming |  |

Similar to humans, large language models (LLMs) exhibit flexibility in handling textual positions - a phenomenon we term Position Generalization. They can understand texts with position perturbations and generalize to longer texts than those encountered during training with the latest techniques. These phenomena suggest that LLMs handle positions in a tolerant manner, but how LLMs computationally process positional relevance remains largely unexplored. In this work, we show how LLMs enforce certain computational mechanisms to allow for the aforementioned tolerance in position perturbations. Despite the complex design of the self-attention mechanism, in this work, LLMs are revealed to learn a counterintuitive disentanglement of attention logits, where their values show a 0.959 linear correlation with an approximation of the arithmetic sum of positional relevance and semantic importance. Furthermore, we... | Chi Han, Heng Ji |  |

While it enables LLMs to achieve human-level alignment, it often incurs significant computational and financial costs due to its reliance on training external reward models or human-labeled preferences. In this work, we propose Implicit Preference Optimization (IPO), an alternative approach that leverages generative LLMs as preference classifiers, thereby reducing the dependence on external human feedback or reward models to obtain preferences. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on the preference classification ability of LLMs using RewardBench, assessing models across different sizes, architectures, and training levels to validate our hypothesis. Furthermore, we investigate the self-improvement capabilities of LLMs by generating multiple responses for a given instruction and employing the model itself as a preference classifier for... | Shivank Garg, Ayush Singh, Shweta Singh, Paras Chopra |  |

Existing methods to improve LLMs’ logical capabilities either involve traceable or verifiable logical sequences that generate more reliable responses by constructing logical structures yet increase computational costs, or introduces rigid logic template rules, reducing flexibility. In this paper, we propose Reversal of Thought (RoT), a plug-and-play and cost-effective reasoning framework designed to enhance the logical reasoning abilities of LLMs during the warm-up phase prior to batch inference. RoT utilizes a Preference-Guided Reverse Reasoning warm-up strategy, which integrates logical symbols for pseudocode planning through meta-cognitive mechanisms and pairwise preference self-evaluation to generate task-specific prompts solely through demonstrations, aligning with LLMs’ cognitive preferences shaped by RLHF.

In this work, we ask whether it is possible to automatically determine whether the reader has previously encountered a text based on their eye movement patterns during reading. We introduce two variants of this task and address them using both feature-based and neural models. We further introduce a general strategy for enhancing these models with machine generated simulations of eye movements from a cognitive model. Finally, we present an analysis of model performance which on the one hand yields insights on the information used by the models, and on the other hand leverages predictive modeling as an analytic tool for better characterization of the role of memory in repeated reading. Our work advances the understanding of the extent and manner in which eye movements in reading capture memory effects from prior text exposure, and paves... | Yoav Meiri, Omer Shubi, Cfir Avraham Hadar, Ariel Kreisberg Nitzav, Yevgeni Berzak |  |

Instruction following tasks typically involve a clear task description and input text containing the target data to be processed. However, when the input itself resembles an instruction, confusion may arise, even if there is explicit prompting to distinguish between the task instruction and the input. We refer to this phenomenon as instructional distraction. In this paper, we introduce a novel benchmark, named \*\*DIM-Bench\*\*, specifically designed to assess LLMs’ performance under instructional distraction. The benchmark categorizes real-world instances of instructional distraction and evaluates LLMs across four instruction tasks: proofreading, rewriting, translation, and style transfer—alongside five input tasks: reasoning, code generation, mathematical reasoning, bias... | Yerin Hwang, Yongil Kim, Jahyun Koo, Taegwan Kang, Hyunkyung Bae, Kyomin Jung |  |

A large body of research has explored the use of LLMs for various planning tasks, from web navigation to travel planning and database querying. However, many of these systems are tailored to specific problems, making it challenging to compare them or determine the best approach for new tasks. There is also a lack of clear and consistent evaluation criteria. Our survey aims to offer a comprehensive overview of current LLM planners to fill this gap. It builds on foundational work by Kartam and Wilkins (1990) and examines six key performance criteria: completeness, executability, optimality, representation, generalization, and efficiency. For each, we provide a thorough analysis of representative works and highlight their strengths and weaknesses.

Despite extensive efforts dedicate to enhancing inference efficiency, these methods primarily exploit internal sparsity within the models, without leveraging external information for optimization. We identify the high similarity of attention matrices across different-scale LLMs, which offers a novel perspective for optimization. We first conduct a comprehensive analysis of how to measure similarity, how to select mapping Layers and whether mapping is consistency. Based on these insights, we introduce the IAM framework, which achieves dual benefits of accelerated attention computation and reduced KV cache usage by performing attention mapping between small and large LLMs. Our experimental results demonstrate that IAM can accelerate prefill by 15% and reduce KV cache usage by 22.1% without appreciably sacrificing performance.

We first curated IPA PACK++, a large-scale multilingual speech corpus with 17,000+ hours of normalized phone transcriptions and a novel evaluation set capturing unseen languages and sociophonetic variation. ZIPA, including transducer (ZIPA-T) and CTC-based (ZIPA-CR) variants, leverages the efficient Zipformer backbones and outperforms existing phone recognition systems with much fewer parameters. Further scaling via noisy student training on 11,000+ hours of pseudo-labeled multilingual data yields further improvement. While ZIPA achieves strong performance on benchmarks, error analysis reveals persistent limitations in modeling sociophonetic diversity, underscoring challenges for future research. | Jian Zhu, Farhan Samir, Eleanor Chodroff, David R.

We introduce GRACE, a benchmark for language model calibration that incorporates comparison with human calibration. GRACE consists of question-answer pairs, in which each question contains a series of clues that gradually become easier, all leading to the same answer; models must answer correctly as early as possible as the clues are revealed. This setting permits granular measurement of model calibration based on how early, accurately, and confidently a model answers. After collecting these questions, we host live human vs. model competitions to gather 1,749 data points on human and model teams’ timing, accuracy, and confidence. We propose a metric, CalScore, that uses GRACE to analyze model calibration errors and identify types of model miscalibration that differ from human behavior. We find that although humans are less accurate than models, humans are generally better calibrated. Since... | Yoo Yeon Sung, Eve Fleisig, Yu Hou, Ishan Upadhyay, Jordan Lee BoydGraber |  |

Current static datasets struggle to identify emerging vulnerabilities due to three limitations: (1) they risk being exposed in model training data, leading to evaluation bias; (2) their limited prompt diversity fails to capture real-world application scenarios; (3) they are limited to provide human-like multi-turn interactions. To address these limitations, we propose a dynamic evaluation framework, CogSafe, for comprehensive and automated multi-turn safety assessment of LLMs. We introduce CogSafe based on cognitive theories to simulate the real chatting process. To enhance assessment diversity, we introduce scenario simulation and strategy decision to guide the dynamic generation, enabling coverage of application situations. Furthermore, we incorporate the cognitive process to simulate multi-turn dialogues that reflect the cognitive dynamics of real-world interactions.

However, are they also able to effectively collaborate over long-term interactions? To investigate this, we introduce MemoryCode, a synthetic multi-session dataset designed to test LLMs’ ability to track and execute simple coding instructions amid irrelevant information, simulating a realistic setting. While all the models we tested handle isolated instructions well, even the performance of state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o deteriorates when instructions are spread across sessions. Our analysis suggests this is due to their failure to retrieve and integrate information over long interaction chains. Our results highlight a fundamental limitation of current LLMs, restricting their ability to collaborate effectively in long interactions. | Nathanaël Carraz Rakotonirina, Mohammed Hamdy, Jon Ander Campos, Lucas Weber, Alberto Testoni, Marzieh Fadaee, Sandro Pezzelle, Marco Del Tredici |  |

This study aims to understand and enhance the transferability of gradient-based jailbreaking methods, which are among the standard approaches for attacking white-box models. Through a detailed analysis of the optimization process, we introduce a novel conceptual framework to elucidate transferability and identify superfluous constraints—specifically, the response pattern constraint and the token tail constraint—as significant barriers to improved transferability. Removing these unnecessary constraints substantially enhances the transferability and controllability of gradient-based attacks. Evaluated on Llama-3-8B-Instruct as the source model, our method increases the overall Transfer Attack Success Rate (T-ASR) across a set of target models with varying safety levels from 18.4% to 50.3%, while also... | Junxiao Yang, Zhexin Zhang, Shiyao Cui, Hongning Wang, Minlie Huang |  |

Through improvements in multilingual abilities, a larger community can access this technology. Yet, we show that multilingual models suffer from substantial gender bias. Furthermore, the expectation that results should be similar across languages does not hold. We introduce MAGBIG, a controlled benchmark designed to study gender bias in multilingual T2I models, and use it to assess the impact of multilingualism on gender bias. To this end, we construct a set of multilingual prompts that offers a carefully controlled setting accounting for the complex grammatical differences influencing gender across languages. Our results show strong gender biases and notable language-specific differences across models. While we explore prompt engineering strategies to mitigate these biases, we find them largely ineffective and sometimes even detrimental to... | Felix Friedrich, Katharina Hämmerl, Patrick Schramowski, Manuel Brack, Jindrich Libovický, Alexander Fraser, Kristian Kersting |  |

In this context, domain adaptation has gained growing popularity as a technique for knowledge transfer, which, however, remains underexplored in multimodal settings compared with unimodal ones. This paper investigates multimodal domain adaptation, focusing on a practical partially shifting scenario where some modalities (referred to as anchors) remain domain-stable, while others (referred to as drifts) undergo a domain shift. We propose a bi-alignment scheme to simultaneously perform drift-drift and anchor-drift matching. The former is achieved through adversarial learning, aligning the representations of the drifts across source and target domains; the latter corresponds to an “anchor dragging drift” strategy, which matches the distributions of the drifts and anchors within the target... | Jun Sun, Xinxin Zhang, Simin Hong, Jian Zhu, Lingfang Zeng |  |

In real world settings, retrieved information can vary in complexity, yet most investigations of LM utilisation of context has been limited to synthetic text. We introduce DRUID (Dataset of Retrieved Unreliable, Insufficient and Difficult-to-understand contexts) with real-world queries and contexts manually annotated for stance. The dataset is based on the prototypical task of automated claim verification, for which automated retrieval of real-world evidence is crucial. We compare DRUID to synthetic datasets (CounterFact, ConflictQA) and find that artificial datasets often fail to represent the complexity and diversity of realistically retrieved context. We show that synthetic datasets exaggerate context characteristics rare in real retrieved data, which leads to inflated context utilisation results, as measured by our novel ACU score.

This macro-structure consists of segments, where each segment contains ADUs that fulfill specific roles to maintain coherence within the segment (\*\*local coherence\*\*) and across segments (\*\*global coherence\*\*). This paper presents an approach that models macro-structure, capturing both local and global coherence to identify argument structures. Experiments on heterogeneous datasets demonstrate superior performance in both in-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations. The cross-dataset evaluation shows that macro-structure enhances transferability to unseen datasets. | Debela Gemechu, Chris Reed |  |

LLMs as Safety Evaluators Are Not Robust to Artifacts](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.970/) |  | 0 | Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed as automated evaluators to assess the safety of generated content, yet their reliability in this role remains uncertain. This study evaluates a diverse set of 11 LLM judge models across critical safety domains, examining three key aspects: self-consistency in repeated judging tasks, alignment with human judgments, and susceptibility to input artifacts such as apologetic or verbose phrasing. Our findings reveal that biases in LLM judges can significantly distort the final verdict on which content source is safer, undermining the validity of comparative evaluations. Notably, apologetic language artifacts alone can skew evaluator preferences by up to 98%. Contrary to expectations, larger models do not consistently exhibit greater robustness, while smaller models sometimes show higher resistance to specific artifacts. To mitigate LLM evaluator robustness issues, we investigate jury-based evaluations aggregating decisions from multiple... | Hongyu Chen, Seraphina GoldfarbTarrant |  |

Recent research on text-to-Query has explored using large language models (LLMs) to convert user query intent to executable code, making it an increasingly popular research topic. To our knowledge, we are the first to introduce the novel semantic parsing task text-to-ES. To bridge the gap between LLM and ES, in detail, we leverage LLMs and employ domain experts to generate ES query bodies, which are Domain-Specific Language (DSL), along with the corresponding post-processing code to support multi-index ES queries. Consequently, we propose the text-to-ES benchmark that consists of two datasets: Large Elasticsearch Dataset (LED), containing 26,207 text-ES pairs derived from a 224.9GB schema-free database, and ElasticSearch (BirdES)with 10,926 pairs sourced from the Bird dataset on a 33.4GB schema-fixed database.

However, in most existing methods for LLM alignment, all tokens in the response are optimized using a sparse, response-level reward or preference annotation. The ignorance of token-level rewards may erroneously punish high-quality tokens or encourage low-quality tokens, resulting in suboptimal performance and slow convergence speed. To address this issue, we propose AlignDistil, a RLHF-equivalent distillation method for token-level reward optimization. Specifically, we introduce the reward learned by DPO into the RLHF objective and theoretically prove the equivalence between this objective and a token-level distillation process, where the teacher distribution linearly combines the logits from the DPO model and a reference model. On this basis, we further bridge the... | Songming Zhang, Xue Zhang, Tong Zhang, Bojie Hu, Yufeng Chen, Jinan Xu |  |

In software engineering, LLM-powered coding agents have garnered significant attention due to their potential to automate complex development tasks, assist in debugging, and enhance productivity. However, existing approaches often struggle with sub-optimal decision-making, requiring either extensive manual intervention or inefficient compute scaling strategies. To improve coding agent performance, we present Dynamic Action Re-Sampling (DARS), a novel inference time compute scaling approach for coding agents, that is faster and more effective at recovering from sub-optimal decisions compared to baselines. While traditional agents either follow linear trajectories or rely on random sampling for scaling compute, our approach DARS works by branching out a trajectory at certain key decision points by taking an alternative... | Vaibhav Aggarwal, Ojasv Kamal, Abhinav Japesh, Zhijing Jin, Bernhard Schölkopf |  |

However, prior studies primarily report results on a few models, leaving critical gaps in understanding the robustness of these methods. In this work, we systematically examine three prominent steering methods—DoLa, function vectors, and task vectors. In contrast to the original studies, which evaluated a handful of models, we test up to 36 models belonging to 14 families with sizes ranging from 1.5B to 70B parameters. Our experiments reveal substantial variability in the effectiveness of the steering approaches, with a large number of models showing no improvement and at times degradation in steering performance. Our analysis reveals fundamental flaws in the assumptions underlying these methods, challenging their reliability as scalable steering solutions. | Patrick Queiroz Da Silva, Hari Sethuraman, Dheeraj Rajagopal, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, Sachin Kumar |  |

Existing methods mainly focus on balancing loss or gradients but fail to fundamentally address this issue due to the representation discrepancy in latent space. In this paper, we propose variance-invariant probabilistic decoding for multi-task learning (VIP-MTL), a framework that ensures impartial learning by harmonizing representation spaces across tasks. VIP-MTL decodes shared representations into task-specific probabilistic distributions and applies variance normalization to constrain these distributions to a consistent scale. Experiments on two language benchmarks show that VIP-MTL outperforms 12 representative methods under the same multi-task settings, especially in heterogeneous task combinations and data-constrained scenarios. Further analysis shows that VIP-MTL is robust to sampling... | Dou Hu, Lingwei Wei, Wei Zhou, Songlin Hu |  |

Previous research suggests that large language models (LLMs) may help mitigate loneliness. However, we argue that the use of widespread LLMs in services like ChatGPT is more prevalent–and riskier, as they are not designed for this purpose. To explore this, we analysed user interactions with ChatGPT outside of its marketed use as a task-oriented assistant. In dialogues classified as lonely, users frequently (37%) sought advice or validation, and received good engagement. However, ChatGPT failed in sensitive scenarios, like responding appropriately to suicidal ideation or trauma. We also observed a 35% higher incidence of toxic content, with women being 22× more likely to be targeted than men. Our findings underscore ethical and legal questions... | Adrian de Wynter |  |

Mainstream speaker diarization systems rely only on acoustic information, making the task particularly challenging in complex acoustic environments in real-world applications. Recently, significant efforts have been devoted to audio-visual or audio-semantic multimodal modeling to enhance speaker diarization performance; however, these approaches still struggle to address the complexities of speaker diarization on spontaneous and unstructured multi-party conversations. To fully exploit meaningful dialogue patterns, we propose a novel multimodal approach that jointly utilizes audio, visual, and semantic cues to enhance speaker diarization. Our approach structures visual cues among active speakers and semantic cues in spoken content into a cohesive format known as pairwise constraints, and employs a semi-supervised... | Luyao Cheng, Hui Wang, Chong Deng, Siqi Zheng, Yafeng Chen, Rongjie Huang, Qinglin Zhang, Qian Chen, Xihao Li, Wen Wang |  |

While current large language models (LLMs) have excelled in natural language tasks, they remain vulnerable to variations in text formatting.Recent research demonstrates that modifying input formats, such as vertically aligning words for encoder-based models, can substantially lower accuracy in text classification tasks. While easily understood by humans, these inputs can significantly mislead models, posing a potential risk of bypassing detection in real-world scenarios involving harmful or sensitive information. With the expanding application of LLMs, a crucial question arises: Do decoder-based LLMs exhibit similar vulnerabilities to vertically formatted text input? In this paper, we investigate the impact of vertical text input on the performance of various LLMs across multiple text classification datasets and analyze the underlying causes.... | Zhecheng Li, Yiwei Wang, Bryan Hooi, Yujun Cai, Zhen Xiong, Nanyun Peng, KaiWei Chang |  |

However, it is not clear how to directly obtain the right data mixtures for these capabilities as the relationship between data and tasks is difficult to be modeled. In this work, we observe that checkpoint models exhibit emerging capabilities at different points in the training trajectory. Often, the training process saves checkpoints as artifacts that are under-utilized as a source of in-training data signals. We identify these artifact models based on their respective capabilities on the benchmarks and leverage them as data mixers by using their aggregated first-order influence approximation over source data. We demonstrated on eight reasoning benchmarks that the proposed framework shows significant improvements in the pretraining setting, with accuracy increases of up to 1.93%. Overall, this demonstrates the potential of checkpoint models to enhance data quality and optimize data... | Ernie Chang, Yang Li, Patrick Huber, Vish Vogeti, David Kant, Yangyang Shi, Vikas Chandra |  |

By extending Attention Flow and replacing attention weights with the generalized Information Tensor, GAF integrates attention weights, their gradients, the maximum flow problem, and the barrier method to enhance the performance of feature attributions. The proposed method exhibits key theoretical properties and mitigates the shortcomings of prior techniques that rely solely on simple aggregation of attention weights. Our comprehensive benchmarking on sequence classification tasks demonstrates that a specific variant of GAF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art feature attribution methods in most evaluation settings, providing a more reliable interpretation of Transformer model outputs. | Behrooz Azarkhalili, Maxwell W.

However, prevailing retriever–reader pipelines often depend on multiple rounds of prompt-level instructions, leading to high computational overhead, instability, and suboptimal retrieval coverage. In this paper, we propose EmbQA, an embedding-level framework that alleviates these shortcomings by enhancing both the retriever and the reader. Specifically, we refine query representations via lightweight linear layers under an unsupervised contrastive learning objective, thereby reordering retrieved passages to highlight those most likely to contain correct answers. Additionally, we introduce an exploratory embedding that broadens the model’s latent semantic space to diversify candidate generation and employs an entropy-based selection mechanism to choose the most confident answer automatically.

However, current benchmarks, which are based on predefined domains and human-labeled data, face limitations in addressing evaluation needs for emerging domains both cost-effectively and efficiently. To address this challenge, we propose the Automated Heterogeneous Information Retrieval Benchmark (AIR-Bench). AIR-Bench is distinguished by three key features: 1) Automated. The testing data in AIR-Bench is automatically generated by large language models (LLMs) without human intervention. 2) Heterogeneous. The testing data in AIR-Bench is generated with respect to diverse tasks, domains and languages. 3) Dynamic. The domains and languages covered by AIR-Bench are constantly augmented to provide an increasingly comprehensive evaluation benchmark for community developers.

Existing benchmarks mainly focus more on the end-to-end performance, but neglect the underlying principles of knowledge acquisition and generalization. Instead, we introduce WE-MATH, the first benchmark specifically designed to explore the problem-solving principles. We meticulously collect 6.5K visual math problems and decompose them into 10.9K step-level questions for evaluation, spanning 5 layers of knowledge granularity and 67 hierarchical knowledge concepts. Specifically, we decompose composite problems into sub-problems according to the required knowledge concepts and introduce a novel four-dimensional metric to hierarchically assess inherent issues in LMMs’ reasoning process. With WE-MATH, we conduct a thorough evaluation of existing LMMs in visual mathematical reasoning and provide comprehensive analysis and insight for... | Runqi Qiao, Qiuna Tan, Guanting Dong, Minhui Wu, Chong Sun, Xiaoshuai Song, Jiapeng Wang, Zhuoma Gongque, Shanglin Lei, Yifan Zhang, Zhe Wei, Miaoxuan Zhang, Runfeng Qiao, Xiao Zong, Yida Xu, Peiqing Yang, Zhimin Bao, Muxi Diao, Chen Li, Honggang Zhang |  |

We implement a wide array of methods to create a rich set of features, using them to classify compounds for present-day compositionality and to assess the informativeness of the corresponding linguistic patterns. Our best results use BERT – reflecting the similarity of compounds and sentence contexts – and we further capture relevant and complementary information across approaches. Leveraging these feature differences, we find that the development of low-compositional meanings is reflected by a parallel drop in compositionality and sustained semantic change. The same distinction is echoed in transformer processing: compositionality estimates require far less contextualization than semantic change estimates. | Filip Miletic, Sabine Schulte im Walde |  |

Supporting Users in Identifying the Effects of Prompt and Model Changes Through Token Patterns](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.985/) |  | 0 | Prompt engineering for large language models is challenging, as even small prompt perturbations or model changes can significantly impact the generated output texts. Existing evaluation methods of LLM outputs, either automated metrics or human evaluation, have limitations, such as providing limited insights or being labor-intensive. We propose Spotlight, a new approach that combines both automation and human analysis. Based on data mining techniques, we automatically distinguish between random (decoding) variations and systematic differences in language model outputs. This process provides token patterns that describe the systematic differences and guide the user in manually analyzing the effects of their prompts and changes in models efficiently. We create three benchmarks to quantitatively test the reliability of token pattern extraction methods and demonstrate that our approach provides new insights into established prompt data.

However, the evolution of written language over millennia complicates its decipherment. In this paper, we propose V-Oracle, an innovative framework that utilizes Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) for interpreting OBS. V-Oracle applies principles of pictographic character formation and frames the task as a visual question-answering (VQA) problem, establishing a multi-step reasoning chain. It proposes a multi-dimensional data augmentation for synthesizing high-quality OBS samples, and also implements a multi-phase oracle alignment tuning to improve LMMs’ visual reasoning capabilities. Moreover, to bridge the evaluation gap in the OBS field, we further introduce Oracle-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that emphasizes process-oriented assessment and incorporates both standard and out-of-distribution setups for realistic evaluation.

Texts describing cultural procedures, including rituals, traditional craftsmanship, and social etiquette, require an inherent understanding of cultural context, presenting a significant challenge for mLLMs. In this work, we introduce CAPTex, a benchmark designed to evaluate mLLMs’ ability to process and reason over culturally diverse procedural texts in multiple languages. Using a range of evaluation methods, we find that (1) mLLMs struggle with culturally contextualized procedural content, particularly in low-resource languages; (2) performance varies across cultural domains, with some proving more difficult than others; and (3) models perform better on multiple-choice tasks presented in conversational formats than on direct questions.... | Amir Hossein Yari, Fajri Koto |  |

Expanding language coverage to the long-tail of low-resource languages requires data-efficient methods that rely on cross-lingual and cross-modal knowledge transfer. To this end, we propose a character-based approach to improve adaptability to new languages and modalities. Our method leverages SONAR, a multilingual fixed-size embedding space with different modules for encoding and decoding. We use a teacher-student approach with parallel translation data to obtain a character-level encoder. Then, using ASR data, we train a lightweight adapter to connect a massively multilingual CTC ASR model (MMS), to the character-level encoder, potentially enabling speech translation from 1,000+ languages. Experimental results in text translation for 75 languages on FLORES+ demonstrate that our character-based approach can achieve better language transfer than traditional subword-based models,... | Ioannis Tsiamas, David Dale, Marta R.

Modeling the Language Continuum by Adapting Models to Dialects and Dialects to Models](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.989/) |  | 0 | Most of the world’s languages and dialects are low-resource, and lack support in mainstream machine translation (MT) models. However, many of them have a closely-related high-resource language (HRL) neighbor, and differ in linguistically regular ways from it. This underscores the importance of model robustness to dialectal variation and cross-lingual generalization to the HRL dialect continuum. We present DialUp, consisting of a training-time technique for adapting a pretrained model to dialectal data (M–>D), and an inference-time intervention adapting dialectal data to the model expertise (D–>M). M–>D induces model robustness to potentially unseen and unknown dialects by exposure to synthetic data exemplifying linguistic mechanisms of dialectal variation, whereas D–>M treats dialectal divergence for known target dialects. These methods show considerable performance gains for several dialects from four language families, and modest gains for two other language families.

However, it is difficult to determine what mixture of data should be used to produce a model with strong performance across all tasks. Existing approaches rely on large ablation studies, heuristics, or human intuition, though these can be prohibitively expensive and suboptimal. We study this problem in the context of preference optimization via DPO and propose a novel and theoretically justified algorithm, AutoMixAlign (AMA), that adaptively mixes datasets during LLM training to balance performance across multiple tasks. AMA first trains specialist models for each task to determine losses that corresponding to strong task performance. Next, AMA trains a generalist model using a novel minimax optimization that prioritizes tasks for which generalist model losses are furthest from specialist model... | Nicholas E.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) capture relational and commonsense knowledge effectively, they are computationally expensive and often underperform in tasks requiring efficient relational encoding, such as relation induction, extraction, and information retrieval. Despite advancements in learning relational embeddings, existing methods often fail to capture nuanced representations and the rich semantics needed for high-quality embeddings. In this work, we propose different relational encoders designed to capture diverse relational aspects and semantic properties of entity pairs. Although several datasets exist for training such encoders, they often rely on structured knowledge bases or predefined schemas, which primarily encode simple and static relations. To overcome this limitation, we also introduce a novel dataset generation method leveraging LLMs to create a diverse spectrum of... | Naïm EsSebbani, Esteban Marquer, Zied Bouraoui |  |

However, fine-tuning still remains essential to achieve satisfactory performance on downstream tasks, while the task-specific tuning samples are usually not readily available or expensive and time-consuming to obtain. To address this, we propose an error-driven data-efficient tuning framework that aims to efficiently adapt generic LMMs to newly emerging tasks without requiring extensive task-specific training samples. In our approach, a generic LMM, acting as a student model, is first evaluated on a small validation set of the target task, and then a more powerful model, acting as a teacher model, identifies the erroneous steps within the student model’s reasoning steps and analyzes its capability gaps from fully addressing the target task. Based on these gaps, targeted training samples are further retrieved from existing task-agnostic datasets to tune the student model and... | Barry Menglong Yao, Qifan Wang, Lifu Huang |  |

However, existing dialogue planning methods generate dialogue plans in a step-by-step sequential manner, and may suffer from compounding errors and myopic actions. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel dialogue planning framework, DiffTOD, which leverages diffusion models to enable non-sequential dialogue planning. DiffTOD formulates dialogue planning as a trajectory generation problem with conditional guidance, and leverages a diffusion language model to estimate the likelihood of the dialogue trajectory. To optimize the dialogue action strategies, DiffTOD introduces three tailored guidance mechanisms for different target types, offering flexible guidance toward diverse TOD targets at test time. Extensive experiments across three diverse TOD settings show that DiffTOD can effectively perform... | Hanwen Du, Bo Peng, Xia Ning |  |

Recent techniques have sought to structure LLM outputs using control flow and code to improve planning performance. However, code-based approaches can be error-prone and insufficient for handling ambiguous or unstructured data. To address these challenges, we propose REPL-Plan, an LLM planning approach that is fully code-expressive (it can utilize all the benefits of code) while also being dynamic (it can flexibly adapt from errors and use the LLM for soft reasoning). In REPL-Plan, an LLM solves tasks by interacting with a Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL), which iteratively executes and evaluates code, similar to language shells or interactive code notebooks, allowing the model to flexibly correct errors and handle tasks dynamically. We demonstrate that REPL-Plan achieves strong results across various planning... | Anthony Zhe Liu, Xinhe Wang, Jacob Sansom, Yao Fu, Jongwook Choi, Sungryull Sohn, Jaekyeom Kim, Honglak Lee |  |

Fine-tuning large models for every niche application is often infeasible due to black-box constraints and high computational overhead. To address this, we propose a collaborative framework that pairs a specialized weak model with a general strong model. The weak model, tailored to specific domains, produces initial drafts and background information, while the strong model leverages its advanced reasoning to refine these drafts, extending LLMs’ capabilities to critical yet specialized tasks. To optimize this collaboration, we introduce a collaborative feedback to fine-tunes the weak model, which quantifies the influence of the weak model’s contributions in the collaboration procedure and establishes preference pairs to guide preference tuning of the weak model. We validate our framework through experiments on three domains. We find that the... | Yizhu Jiao, Xuchao Zhang, Zhaoyang Wang, Yubo Ma, Zhun Deng, Rujia Wang, Chetan Bansal, Saravan Rajmohan, Jiawei Han, Huaxiu Yao |  |

In this work, we are the first to investigate the impact of real-world SDCs on LLM training by comparing model training between healthy production nodes and unhealthy nodes exhibiting SDCs. With the help from a cloud computing platform, we access the unhealthy nodes that were swept out from production by automated fleet management. Using deterministic execution via XLA compiler and our proposed synchronization mechanisms, we isolate and analyze the impact of SDC errors on these nodes at three levels: at each submodule computation, at a single optimizer step, and at a training period. Our results reveal that the impact of SDCs on computation varies on different unhealthy nodes. Although in most cases the perturbations from SDCs on submodule computation and gradients are relatively small,... | Jeffrey Jian Ma, Hengzhi Pei, Leonard Lausen, George Karypis |  |

This work introduces the Align-SLM framework, which leverages preference optimization inspired by Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) to enhance the semantic understanding of SLMs. Our approach generates multiple speech continuations from a given prompt and uses LLM-based semantic metrics to create preference data for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We evaluate the framework using ZeroSpeech 2021 benchmarks for lexical and syntactic modeling, the spoken version of the StoryCloze dataset for semantic coherence, and other speech generation metrics, including the GPT4-o score and human evaluation.

To address these limitations, we introduce BIG5-CHAT, a large-scale dataset containing 100,000 dialogues designed to ground models in how humans express their personality in text. Leveraging this dataset, we explore Supervised Fine-Tuning and Direct Preference Optimization as training-based methods to align LLMs more naturally with human personality patterns. Our methods outperform prompting on personality assessments such as BFI and IPIP-NEO, with trait correlations more closely matching human data. Furthermore, our experiments reveal that models trained to exhibit higher conscientiousness, higher agreeableness, lower extraversion, and lower neuroticism display better performance on reasoning tasks,... | Wenkai Li, Jiarui Liu, Andy Liu, Xuhui Zhou, Mona T.

In this work, we introduce the Perfect Times dataset, a novel, quadrilingual (English, Italian, Russian, and Japanese) multiple-choice question-answering benchmark designed to assess video-language models (VLMs) on temporal reasoning. By pairing everyday activity videos with event completion labels and perfectivity-tailored distractors, our dataset probes whether models truly comprehend temporal dynamics or merely latch onto superficial markers. Experimental results indicate that state-of-the-art models, despite their success on text-based tasks, struggle to mirror human-like temporal and causal reasoning grounded in video. This study underscores the necessity of integrating deep multimodal cues to capture the nuances of action duration and completion within temporal and causal video... | Olga Loginova, Sofía Ortega Loguinova |  |

The heart of T3 is a community-centred taxonomy of harms, developed in collaboration with the TGNB community, which we complement with, amongst other guidance, suggested heuristics for evaluation. To develop the taxonomy, we adopted a multi-method approach that included surveys and focus groups with community experts. The contribution highlights the importance of community-centred approaches in mitigating harm, and outlines pathways for LLM developers to improve how their models handle TGNB-related topics. | Eddie L.

This study explores the integration of comparative judgment into human annotation for machine translation (MT) and evaluates three annotation setups—point-wise Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM), side-by-side (S×S) MQM, and its simplified version S×S relative ranking (RR). In MQM, annotators mark error spans with categories and severity levels. S×S MQM extends MQM to pairwise error annotation for two translations of the same input, while S×S RR focuses on selecting the better output without labeling errors.Key findings are: (1) the S×S settings achieve higher inter-annotator agreement than MQM; (2) S×S MQM enhances inter-translation error marking consistency compared to MQM by, on average, 38.5% for explicitly compared MT systems and 19.5% for others; (3) all annotation settings return stable system rankings, with S×S RR offering a more efficient... | Yixiao Song, Parker Riley, Daniel Deutsch, Markus Freitag |  |

Despite advancements in AI, particularly with LLMs, existing efforts have been limited to generating simple charts, with no prior work addressing the creation of complex infographics from text-heavy documents that demand a deep understanding of the content. We address this gap by introducing the task of generating statistical infographics composed of multiple sub-charts (e.g., line, bar, pie) that are contextually accurate, insightful, and visually aligned. To achieve this, we define infographic metadata, that includes its title and textual insights, along with sub-chart-specific details such as their corresponding data, alignment, etc. We also present Infodat, the first benchmark dataset for text-to-infographic metadata generation, where each sample links a document to its metadata. We propose Infogen, a two-stage framework where fine-tuned LLMs first generate... | Akash Ghosh, Aparna Garimella, Pritika Ramu, Sambaran Bandyopadhyay, Sriparna Saha |  |

A dense and meaningful representation of concepts, however, could prove useful for several tasks in computational linguistics, especially those involving cross-linguistic data or sparse data from low resource languages. First methods that have been proposed so far embed concepts from automatically constructed colexification networks. While these approaches depart from automatically inferred polysemies, attested across a larger number of languages, they are restricted to the word level, ignoring lexical relations that would only hold for parts of the words in a given language. Building on recently introduced methods for the inference of partial colexifications, we show how they can be used to improve concept embeddings in meaningful ways. The learned embeddings are evaluated against lexical similarity ratings, recorded instances of... | Arne Rubehn, JohannMattis List |  |

Unbiased watermarks offer a powerful solution by embedding statistical signals into language model-generated text without distorting the quality. In this paper, we introduce MCmark, a family of unbiased, Multi-Channel-based watermarks. MCmark works by partitioning the model’s vocabulary into segments and promoting token probabilities within a selected segment based on a watermark key. We demonstrate that MCmark not only preserves the original distribution of the language model but also offers significant improvements in detectability and robustness over existing unbiased watermarks. Our experiments with widely-used language models demonstrate an improvement in detectability of over 10% using MCmark, compared to existing state-of-the-art unbiased watermarks. This advancement underscores MCmark’s potential in enhancing the... | Ruibo Chen, Yihan Wu, Junfeng Guo, Heng Huang |  |

MaCP consistently delivers superior accuracy, significantly reduced... | Yixian Shen, Qi Bi, JiaHong Huang, Hongyi Zhu, Andy D. Pimentel, Anuj Pathania |  |

However, existing ITI approaches fail to scale to multi-attribute settings with conflicts, such as enhancing helpfulness while also reducing toxicity. To address this, we introduce Multi-Attribute Targeted Steering (MAT-Steer), a novel steering framework designed for selective token-level intervention across multiple attributes. We achieve this by learning steering vectors using an alignment objective that shifts the model’s internal representations of undesirable outputs closer to those of desirable ones while enforcing sparsity and orthogonality among vectors for different attributes, thereby reducing inter-attribute conflicts. We evaluate MAT-Steer in two distinct settings: (i) on question answering (QA) tasks where we... | Duy Nguyen, Archiki Prasad, Elias StengelEskin, Mohit Bansal |  |

Current strategies for building web agents rely on (i) the generalizability of underlying MLLMs and their steerability via prompting, and (ii) large-scale fine-tuning of MLLMs on web-related tasks. However, web agents still struggle to automate tasks on unseen websites and domains, limiting their applicability to enterprise-specific and proprietary platforms. Beyond generalization from large-scale pre-training and fine-tuning, we propose building agents for few-shot adaptability using human demonstrations. We introduce the AdaptAgent framework that enables both proprietary and open-weights multimodal web agents to adapt to new websites and domains using few human demonstrations (up to 2). Our experiments on two popular benchmarks — Mind2Web & VisualWebArena — show that... | Gaurav Verma, Rachneet Kaur, Nishan Srishankar, Zhen Zeng, Tucker Balch, Manuela Veloso |  |

A Systematic Evaluation on AI Research Papers](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.1009/) |  | 0 | Peer review is fundamental to scientific research, but the growing volume of publications has intensified the challenges of this expertise-intensive process. While LLMs show promise in various scientific tasks, their potential to assist with peer review, particularly in identifying paper limitations, remains understudied. We first present a comprehensive taxonomy of limitation types in scientific research, with a focus on AI. Guided by this taxonomy, for studying limitations, we present LimitGen, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs’ capability to support early-stage feedback and complement human peer review. Our benchmark consists of two subsets: LimitGen-Syn, a synthetic dataset carefully created through controlled perturbations of high-quality papers, and LimitGen-Human, a collection of real human-written limitations. To improve the ability of LLM systems to identify limitations, we augment them with literature retrieval, which is essential for grounding... | Zhijian Xu, Yilun Zhao, Manasi Patwardhan, Lovekesh Vig, Arman Cohan |  |

Weask what happens to a monolingual language model when it begins to be trained on a second language. Specifically, we train small bilingual models for which we control the amount of data for each language and the order of language exposure. To find evidence of shared multilingual representations, we turn to structural priming, a method used to study grammatical representations in humans. We first replicate previous crosslingual structural priming results and find that after controlling for training data quantity and language exposure, there are asymmetrical effects across language pairs and directions. We argue that this asymmetry may shape hypotheses about human structural priming effects. We also find that structural priming effects are less robust for less similar language pairs, highlighting potential limitations of crosslingual transfer learning... | Catherine Arnett, Tyler A.

In this paper, we use Shapley Taylor interaction indices (STII) in order to examine how language and speech models internally relate and structure their inputs. Pairwise Shapley interactions give us an attribution measure of how much two inputs work together to influence model outputs beyond if we linearly added their independent influences, providing a view into how models encode structural interactions between inputs. We relate the interaction patterns in models to three underlying linguistic structures: syntactic structure, non-compositional semantics, and phonetic interaction. We find that autoregressive text models encode interactions that correlate with the syntactic proximity of inputs, and that both autoregressive and masked models encode nonlinear interactions in idiomatic phrases... | Divyansh Singhvi, Diganta Misra, Andrej Erkelens, Raghav Jain, Isabel Papadimitriou, Naomi Saphra |  |

For example, the Llama3 standard tokenization of penguin is [p,enguin], yet [peng,uin] is another perfectly valid alternative. In this paper, we show that despite LLMs being trained solely on one tokenization, they still retain semantic understanding of other tokenizations, raising questions about their implications in LLM safety. Put succinctly, we answer the following question: can we adversarially tokenize an obviously malicious string to evade safety and alignment restrictions? We show that not only is adversarial tokenization an effective yet previously neglected axis of attack, but it is also competitive against existing state-of-the-art adversarial approaches without changing the text of the harmful request. We empirically validate this exploit across three state-of-the-art LLMs and adversarial datasets,... | Renato Lui Geh, Zilei Shao, Guy Van den Broeck |  |

In this paper, we propose using computational methods to identify unreliable narrators, i.e. those who unintentionally misrepresent information. Borrowing literary theory from narratology to define different types of unreliable narrators based on a variety of textual phenomena, we present TUNa, a human-annotated dataset of narratives from multiple domains, including blog posts, subreddit posts, hotel reviews, and works of literature. We define classification tasks for intra-narrational, inter-narrational, and inter-textual unreliabilities and analyze the performance of popular open-weight and proprietary LLMs for each. We propose learning from literature to perform unreliable narrator classification on real-world text data. To this end, we experiment with few-shot, fine-tuning, and curriculum learning settings. Our results show that this... | Anneliese Brei, Katharine Henry, Abhisheik Sharma, Shashank Srivastava, Snigdha Chaturvedi |  |

For example, studying how ‘gun ownership’ is related to the perception of ‘Freedom’, requires a retrieval system that can operate at scale over social media posts, while dealing with two key challenges: (1) identifying abstract concept instances, (2) which can be instantiated differently across different communities. To address these, we introduce ConceptCarve, an evidence retrieval framework that utilizes traditional retrievers and LLMs to dynamically characterize the search space during retrieval. Our experiments show that ConceptCarve surpasses traditional retrieval systems in finding evidence within a social media community. It also produces an interpretable representation of the evidence for that community, which we use to qualitatively analyze complex thought patterns that manifest... | Eylon Caplan, Dan Goldwasser |  |

However, existing PQA systems generate answers with only a single perspective, failing to capture the diversity of customer opinions. In this paper we introduce a novel task Quantitative Query-Focused Summarization (QQSUM), which aims to summarize diverse customer opinions into representative Key Points (KPs) and quantify their prevalence to effectively answer user queries. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) shows promise for PQA, its generated answers still fall short of capturing the full diversity of viewpoints. To tackle this challenge, our model QQSUM-RAG, which extends RAG, employs few-shot learning to jointly train a KP-oriented retriever and a KP summary generator, enabling KP-based summaries that capture diverse and representative opinions. Experimental results demonstrate that QQSUM-RAG achieves superior... | An Quang Tang, Xiuzhen Zhang, Minh Ngoc Dinh, Zhuang Li |  |

This limitation in grounding—the process by which conversation participants establish mutual understanding—can lead to outcomes ranging from frustrated users to serious consequences in high-stakes scenarios. To systematically study grounding challenges in human-LLM interactions, we analyze logs from three human-assistant datasets: WildChat, MultiWOZ, and Bing Chat. We develop a taxonomy of grounding acts and build models to annotate and forecast grounding behavior. Our findings reveal significant differences in human-human and human-LLM grounding: LLMs were three times less likely to initiate clarification and sixteen times less likely to provide follow-up requests than humans. Additionally, we find that early grounding failures predict later interaction breakdowns. Building on these insights, we introduce Rifts, a benchmark derived from... | Omar Shaikh, Hussein Mozannar, Gagan Bansal, Adam Fourney, Eric Horvitz |  |

In contrast, coaching presents unique challenges with initially undefined goals that evolve through multi-turn interactions, subjective evaluation criteria, mixed-initiative dialogue. In this work, we describe and implement five multi-turn coaching agents that exhibit distinct conversational styles, and evaluate them through a user study, collecting first-person feedback on 155 conversations. We find that users highly value core functionality, and that stylistic components in absence of core components are viewed negatively. By comparing user feedback with third-person evaluations from health experts and an LM, we reveal significant misalignment across evaluation approaches. Our findings provide insights into design and evaluation of conversational coaching agents and contribute toward improving human-centered NLP applications. | Vidya Srinivas, Xuhai Xu, Xin Liu, Kumar Ayush, Isaac R.

Despite that, existing LLM-based planners struggle with long chains of sequential reasoning, while symbolic planners face combinatorial explosion of states and actions for complex domains due to reliance on grounding. To address these deficiencies, we introduce LLM-Regress, an open-world planning approach integrating lifted regression with LLM-generated affordances. LLM-Regress generates sound and complete plans in a compact lifted form, avoiding exhaustive enumeration of irrelevant states and actions. Additionally, it makes efficient use of LLMs to infer goal-related objects and affordances without the need to predefine all possible objects and affordances. We conduct extensive experiments on three benchmarks and show that LLM-Regress significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM planners and a grounded planner using LLM-generated affordances. | Xiaotian Liu, Ali Pesaranghader, Hanze Li, Punyaphat Sukcharoenchaikul, Jaehong Kim, Tanmana Sadhu, Hyejeong Jeon, Scott Sanner |  |

The Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework, which explicitly models speaker intentions, is the most widespread theory of probabilistic pragmatics, but existing implementations are either unable to account for figurative expressions or require modeling the implicit motivations for using figurative language (e.g., to express joy or annoyance) in a setting-specific way. In this paper, we introduce the Rhetorical-Strategy-Aware RSA (RSA)² framework which models figurative language use by considering a speaker’s employed rhetorical strategy. We show that (RSA)² enables human-compatible interpretations of non-literal utterances without modeling a speaker’s motivations for being non-literal. Combined with LLMs, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ironic split of PragMega+, a new irony interpretation... | Cesare Spinoso Di Piano, David Eric Austin, Pablo Piantanida, Jackie CK Cheung |  |

While recent studies focus on generating semantic and stylistic variations of given design concepts, –the integration of multiple affordances into a single coherent concept–remains largely overlooked. In this paper, we introduce SYNTHIA, a framework for generating novel, functionally coherent designs based on desired affordances. Our approach leverages a hierarchical concept ontology that decomposes concepts into parts and affordances, serving as a crucial building block for functionally coherent design. We also develop a curriculum learning scheme based on our ontology that contrastively fine-tunes T2I models to progressively learn affordance composition while maintaining visual novelty. To elaborate, we (i) gradually increase affordance distance, guiding models from basic concept-affordance association to complex affordance compositions that integrate parts of distinct affordances... | Hyeonjeong Ha, Xiaomeng Jin, Jeonghwan Kim, Jiateng Liu, Zhenhailong Wang, Khanh Duy Nguyen, Ansel Blume, Nanyun Peng, KaiWei Chang, Heng Ji |  |

Nevertheless, past research on client simulation did not focus on complex conversation tasks such as mental health counseling. In these tasks, the challenge is to ensure that the client’s actions (i.e., interactions with the counselor) are consistent with with its stipulated profiles and negative behavior settings. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that supports consistent client simulation for mental health counseling. Our framework tracks the mental state of a simulated client, controls its state transitions, and generates for each state behaviors consistent with the client’s motivation, beliefs, preferred plan to change, and receptivity. By varying the client profile and receptivity, we demonstrate that consistent simulated clients for different counseling scenarios can be effectively created.

Such language poses a significant challenge in NLP research due to its subtle and context-dependent nature. Yet, detecting anti-autistic ableist language remains underexplored, with existing NLP tools often failing to capture its nuanced expressions. We present AUTALIC, the first dataset dedicated to the detection of anti-autistic ableist language in context, addressing a significant gap in the field. AUTALIC comprises 2,400 autism-related sentences collected from Reddit, accompanied by surrounding context, and annotated by trained experts with backgrounds in neurodiversity. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that current language models, including state-of-the-art LLMs, struggle to reliably identify anti-autistic ableism and diverge from human judgments, underscoring their limitations in this domain. We publicly release our dataset along with the... | Naba Rizvi, Harper Strickland, Daniel Gitelman, Alexis Morales Flores, Tristan Cooper, Aekta Kallepalli, Akshat Alurkar, Haaset Owens, Saleha Ahmedi, Isha Khirwadkar, Imani N.

In this work, we demonstrate that despite these advances, LLMs still struggle to reason using molecular structural information. This gap is critical because many molecular properties, including functional groups, depend heavily on such structural details. To address this limitation, we propose an approach that sketches molecular structures for reasoning. Specifically, we introduce Molecular Structural Reasoning (MSR) framework to enhance the understanding of LLMs by explicitly incorporating the key structural features. We present two frameworks for scenarios where the target molecule is known or unknown. We verify that our MSR improves molecular understanding through extensive experiments. | Yunhui Jang, Jaehyung Kim, Sungsoo Ahn |  |

This paper introduces CAMI, a novel automated counselor agent grounded in Motivational Interviewing (MI) – a client-centered counseling approach designed to address ambivalence and facilitate behavior change. CAMI employs a novel STAR framework, consisting of client’s state inference, motivation topic exploration, and response generation modules, leveraging large language models (LLMs). These components work together to evoke change talk, aligning with MI principles and improving counseling outcomes for diverse clients. We evaluate CAMI’s performance through both automated and expert evaluations, utilizing simulated clients to assess MI skill competency, client’s state inference accuracy, topic exploration proficiency, and overall counseling success. Results show that CAMI not only outperforms several state-of-the-art methods but also shows... | Yizhe Yang, Palakorn Achananuparp, Heyan Huang, Jing Jiang, Phey Ling Kit, Nicholas Gabriel Lim, Cameron Tan Shi Ern, EePeng Lim |  |

However, current role-playing methods face challenges such as a lack of utterance-level authenticity and user-level diversity, often hindered by role confusion and dependence on predefined profiles of well-known figures. In contrast, direct simulation focuses solely on text, neglecting implicit user traits like personality and conversation-level consistency. To address these issues, we introduce the User Simulator with Implicit Profiles (USP), a framework that infers implicit user profiles from human-machine interactions to simulate personalized and realistic dialogues. We first develop an LLM-driven extractor with a comprehensive profile schema, then refine the simulation using conditional supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with cycle consistency, optimizing at both the... | Kuang Wang, Xianfei Li, Shenghao Yang, Li Zhou, Feng Jiang, Haizhou Li |  |

However, conventional benchmarks based on learner-produced texts are insufficient for conducting detailed evaluations of GEC model performance across a wide range of grammar items due to biases in their distribution.To address this issue, we propose a new evaluation paradigm that assesses GEC models using minimal pairs of ungrammatical and grammatical sentences for each grammar item. As the first benchmark within this paradigm, we introduce the CEFR-based Targeted Syntactic Evaluation Dataset for Grammatical Error Correction (CTSEG), which complements existing English benchmarks by enabling fine-grained analyses previously unattainable with conventional datasets. Using CTSEG, we evaluate three mainstream types... | Aomi Koyama, Masato Mita, SuYoun Yoon, Yasufumi Takama, Mamoru Komachi |  |

However, most existing assessments focus on natural videos, overlooking synthetic videos (e.g., AI-generated content). Meanwhile, some works in video generation rely on MLLMs to evaluate the quality of generated videos, but the capabilities of MLLMs on AIGC videos remain largely underexplored. To address this, we propose a new benchmark, VQ-Eval, which introduces four tasks—coherence validation, error awareness, error type detection, and reasoning evaluation—to comprehensively evaluate the abilities of MLLMs on AIGC videos. We evaluate 13 frontier MLLMs on VQ-Eval and find that even the best-performing model, GPT-4.1, struggles to achieve consistently good performance across all tasks. This highlights the challenging nature of our benchmark. Additionally, to investigate the practical applications of VQ-Eval in improving video generation, we design a re-prompt pipeline,... | Tingyu Song, Tongyan Hu, Guo Gan, Yilun Zhao |  |

Prior methods steer LLMs via descriptions of subpopulations as LLMs’ input prompt, yet such prompt engineering approaches have struggled to faithfully predict the distribution of survey responses from human subjects. In this work, we propose directly fine-tuning LLMs to predict response distributions by leveraging unique structural characteristics of survey data. To enable fine-tuning, we curate SubPOP, a significantly scaled dataset of 3,362 questions and 70K subpopulation-response pairs from well-established public opinion surveys. We show that fine-tuning on SubPOP greatly improves the match between LLM predictions and human responses across various subpopulations, reducing the LLM-human gap by up to 46% compared to baselines, and achieves strong generalization to unseen surveys and subpopulations.

We train TESS 2 by first adapting a strong AR model via continued pretraining with a diffusion loss and then performing further instruction tuning. We find that adaptation training as well as the choice of the base model is crucial for training good instruction-following diffusion models. We further propose reward guidance, a novel and modular inference-time guidance procedure to align model outputs without needing to train the underlying model. Finally, we show that TESS 2 further improves with increased inference-time compute, highlighting the utility of diffusion LMs in having fine-grained controllability over the amount of compute used at inference time. | Jaesung Tae, Hamish Ivison, Sachin Kumar, Arman Cohan |  |

Detecting LLM-generated text is crucial for upholding academic integrity, preventing plagiarism, protecting copyrights, and ensuring ethical research practices. Most prior studies on detecting LLM-generated text focus primarily on English text. However, languages with distinct morphological and syntactic characteristics require specialized detection approaches. Their unique structures and usage patterns hinder the direct application of methods primarily designed for English. Among such languages, we focus on Korean, which has relatively flexible spacing rules, a rich morphological system, and less frequent comma usage compared to English. We introduce KatFish, the first benchmark dataset for detecting LLM-generated Korean text. The dataset consists of text written by humans and generated by four LLMs across three genres. By examining spacing... | Shinwoo Park, Shubin Kim, DoKyung Kim, YoSub Han |  |

However, when applied to Text-to-SQL datasets, it often fails to improve performance and can even degrade it. Our investigation reveals the root cause: unlike math and code tasks, which naturally integrate Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with DPO, Text-to-SQL datasets typically include only final answers (gold SQL queries) without detailed CoT solutions. By augmenting Text-to-SQL datasets with synthetic CoT solutions, we achieve, for the first time, consistent and significant performance improvements using DPO.Our analysis shows that CoT reasoning is crucial for unlocking DPO’s potential, as it mitigates reward hacking, strengthens discriminative capabilities, and improves scalability. These findings offer valuable insights for building more robust Text-to-SQL models. To support further research, we publicly release the code and CoT-enhanced datasets:... | Hanbing Liu, Haoyang Li, Xiaokang Zhang, Ruotong Chen, Haiyong Xu, Tian Tian, Qi Qi, Jing Zhang |  |

Being available to users from diverse cultural backgrounds, Large Language Models (LLMs) should also be able to provide accurate information irrespective of the measurement system at hand. Using newly compiled datasets we test if this is truly the case for seven open-source LLMs, addressing three key research questions: (RQ1) What is the default system used by LLMs for each type of measurement? (RQ2) Do LLMs’ answers and their accuracy vary across different measurement systems? (RQ3) Can LLMs mitigate potential challenges w.r.t. underrepresented systems via reasoning? Our findings show that LLMs default to the measurement system predominantly used in the data. Additionally, we observe considerable instability and variance in performance across different measurement systems. While this instability can in... | Minh Duc Bui, Kyung Eun Park, Goran Glavas, Fabian David Schmidt, Katharina von der Wense |  |

However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on assessing factual and logical correctness in downstream tasks, with limited emphasis on evaluating MLLMs’ ability to interpret pragmatic cues and intermodal relationships. To address this gap, we assess the competency of MLLMs in performing Multimodal Discourse Analysis (MDA) using Coherence Relations. Our benchmark, CORDIAL, encompasses a broad spectrum of Coherence Relations across 3 different discourse domains at varying levels of granularity. Through our experiments on 10+ MLLMs employing different prompting strategies, we show that even top models like Gemini 1.5 Pro and GPT-4o fail to match the performance of simple classifier-based baselines. This study emphasizes the need to move beyond similarity-based metrics and adopt a discourse-driven framework for evaluating MLLMs,... | Aashish Anantha Ramakrishnan, Aadarsh Anantha Ramakrishnan, Dongwon Lee |  |

In this work, we find that LLMs exhibit concerning biases in how they associate solution veracity with demographics. Through experiments across five human value-aligned LLMs on mathematics, coding, commonsense, and writing problems, we reveal two forms of such veracity biases: Attribution Bias, where models disproportionately attribute correct solutions to certain demographic groups, and Evaluation Bias, where models’ assessment of identical solutions varies based on perceived demographic authorship. Our results show pervasive biases: LLMs consistently attribute fewer correct solutions and more incorrect ones to African-American groups in math and coding, while Asian authorships are least preferred in writing evaluation. In additional studies, we show LLMs automatically assign racially stereotypical colors to demographic groups in visualization code,... | Yue Zhou, Barbara Di Eugenio |  |

However, existing methods assign equal importance to all tokens in the response, while humans focus on more meaningful parts. This leads to suboptimal preference optimization, as irrelevant or noisy tokens disproportionately influence DPO loss. To address this limitation, we propose Optimal Transport-based token weighting scheme for enhancing direct Preference Optimization (OTPO). By emphasizing semantically meaningful token pairs and de-emphasizing less relevant ones, our method introduces a context-aware token weighting scheme that yields a more contrastive reward difference estimate. This adaptive weighting enhances reward stability, improves interpretability, and ensures that preference optimization focuses on meaningful differences between responses.... | Meng Li, Guangda Huzhang, Haibo Zhang, Xiting Wang, Anxiang Zeng |  |

A Benchmark and Empirical Study](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.1036/) |  | 0 | The remarkable reasoning and generalization capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved the way for their expanding applications in embodied AI, robotics, and other real-world tasks. To effectively support these applications, grounding in spatial and temporal understanding in multimodal environments is essential. To this end, recent works have leveraged scene graphs, a structured representation that encodes entities, attributes, and their relationships in a scene. However, a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs’ ability to utilize scene graphs remains limited. In this work, we introduce Text-Scene Graph (TSG) Bench, a benchmark designed to systematically assess LLMs’ ability to (1) understand scene graphs and (2) generate them from textual narratives. With TSG Bench we evaluate 11 LLMs and reveal that, while models perform well on scene graph understanding, they struggle with scene graph generation, particularly for complex narratives. Our analysis indicates that these models... | Dongil Yang, Minjin Kim, Sunghwan Kim, Beongwoo Kwak, Minjun Park, Jinseok Hong, Woontack Woo, Jinyoung Yeo |  |

While prior research has focused on high-level architectural frameworks, the granular mechanisms governing agents—critical to performance and scalability—remain underexplored. This study systematically investigates four dimensions of collaboration strategies: (1) agent governance, (2) participation control, (3) interaction dynamics, and (4) dialogue history management. Through rigorous experimentation under two context-dependent scenarios—Distributed Evidence Integration (DEI) and Structured Evidence Synthesis (SES)—we quantify the impact of these strategies on both task accuracy and computational efficiency. Our findings reveal that centralized governance, instructor-led participation, ordered interaction patterns, and instructor-curated context summarization collectively optimize the trade-off between decision quality and resource... | Haochun Wang, Sendong Zhao, Jingbo Wang, Zewen Qiang, Bing Qin, Ting Liu |  |

In this paper, we reveal a novel \*\*provider bias\*\* in LLMs: without explicit directives, these models show systematic preferences for services from specific providers in their recommendations (e.g., favoring Google Cloud over Microsoft Azure). To systematically investigate this bias, we develop an automated pipeline to construct the dataset, incorporating 6 distinct coding task categories and 30 real-world application scenarios. Leveraging this dataset, we conduct the \*\*first\*\* comprehensive empirical study of provider bias in LLM code generation across seven state-of-the-art LLMs, utilizing approximately 500 million tokens (equivalent to $5,000+ in computational costs). Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit significant provider preferences, predominantly favoring services from Google and Amazon, and can... | Xiaoyu Zhang, Juan Zhai, Shiqing Ma, Qingshuang Bao, Weipeng Jiang, Qian Wang, Chao Shen, Yang Liu |  |

While a neutral-toxic paired dataset provides a straightforward approach for training detoxification models, creating such datasets presents several challenges: i) the need for human annotation to build paired data, and ii) the rapid evolution of offensive terms, rendering static datasets quickly outdated. To tackle these challenges, we introduce an automated paired data generation pipeline, called K/DA. This pipeline is designed to generate offensive language with implicit offensiveness and trend-aligned slang, making the resulting dataset suitable for detoxification model training. We demonstrate that the dataset generated by K/DA exhibits high pair consistency and greater implicit offensiveness compared to existing Korean datasets, and also demonstrates applicability to other languages. Furthermore, it enables effective training of a high-performing detoxification model with simple instruction fine-tuning. | Minkyeong Jeon, Hyemin Jeong, Yerang Kim, Jiyoung Kim, Jae Hyeon Cho, ByungJun Lee |  |

However, there exist two limitations in current MoE solutions which may lead to sub-optimal performance: 1) they directly use the task knowledge of NMT into MoE (e.g., domain/linguistics-specific knowledge), which are generally unavailable at practical application and neglect the naturally grouped domain/linguistic properties; 2) the expert selection only depends on the localized token representation without considering the context, which fully grasps the state of each token in a global view. To address the above limitations, we propose THOR-MoE via arming the MoE with hierarchical task-guided and context-responsive routing policies. Specifically, it 1) firstly predicts the domain/language label and then extracts mixed domain/language representation to allocate task-level experts in a hierarchical manner; 2) injects the context information to enhance the token routing from the... | Yunlong Liang, Fandong Meng, Jie Zhou |  |

However, the assumption that third-party annotators can accurately capture authors’ private states remains largely unexamined. In this study, we present human subjects experiments on emotion recognition tasks that directly compare third-party annotations with first-party (author-provided) emotion labels. Our findings reveal significant limitations in third-party annotations—whether provided by human annotators or large language models (LLMs)—in faithfully representing authors’ private states. However, LLMs outperform human annotators nearly across the board. We further explore methods to improve third-party annotation quality. We find that demographic similarity between first-party authors and third-party human annotators enhances annotation performance. While incorporating first-party... | Jiayi Li, Yingfan Zhou, Pranav Narayanan Venkit, Halima Binte Islam, Sneha Arya, Shomir Wilson, Sarah Rajtmajer |  |

Viewing the output speech as a data distribution, previous approaches often employ traditional speech representations, such as waveforms or spectrograms, within the Flow Matching framework. However, these methods have limitations, including overlooking various speech attributes and incurring high computational costs due to additional constraints introduced during training. To address these challenges, we introduce OZSpeech, the first TTS method to explore optimal transport conditional flow matching with one-step sampling and a learned prior as the condition, effectively disregarding preceding states and reducing the number of sampling steps. Our approach operates on disentangled, factorized components of speech in token format, enabling accurate modeling of each speech attribute, which enhances the TTS system’s ability to precisely... | NghiaHuynh NguyenHieu, Ngoc Son Nguyen, Huynh Nguyen Dang, Thieu Vo, TruongSon Hy, Van Nguyen |  |

Existing approaches either solely optimize action selection or directly leverage pre-trained models as world models during inference, overlooking the benefits of learning to model the world as a way to enhance planning capabilities. We propose Dual Preference Optimization (D2PO), a new learning framework that jointly optimizes state prediction and action selection through preference learning, enabling LVLMs to understand environment dynamics for better planning. To automatically collect trajectories and stepwise preference data without human annotation, we introduce a tree search mechanism for extensive exploration via trial-and-error. Extensive experiments on VoTa-Bench demonstrate that our D2PO-based method significantly outperforms existing methods and GPT-4o when applied to Qwen2-VL (7B),... | Siyin Wang, Zhaoye Fei, Qinyuan Cheng, Shiduo Zhang, Panpan Cai, Jinlan Fu, Xipeng Qiu |  |

While researchers have proposed different jailbreak attacks in depth, they have done so in isolation—either with unaligned settings or comparing a limited range of methods. To fill this gap, we present a large-scale evaluation of various jailbreak attacks. We collect 17 representative jailbreak attacks, summarize their features, and establish a novel jailbreak attack taxonomy. Then we conduct comprehensive measurement and ablation studies across nine aligned LLMs on 160 forbidden questions from 16 violation categories. Also, we test jailbreak attacks under eight advanced defenses. Based on our taxonomy and experiments, we identify some important patterns, such as heuristic-based attacks, which could achieve high attack success rates but are easy to mitigate by defenses. Our study offers valuable insights for future research on jailbreak attacks and defenses and serves as a benchmark tool for researchers and practitioners to... | Junjie Chu, Yugeng Liu, Ziqing Yang, Xinyue Shen, Michael Backes, Yang Zhang |  |

Lacking assessment standards, existing benchmarks focus on “factual statements” that rephrase source materials while overlooking “cognitive statements” that involve making inferences from the given context. Consequently, evaluating and detecting the hallucination of cognitive statements remains challenging. Inspired by how evidence is assessed in the legal domain, we design a rigorous framework to assess different levels of faithfulness of cognitive statements and introduce the CogniBench dataset where we reveal insightful statistics. To keep pace with rapidly evolving LLMs, we further develop an automatic annotation pipeline that scales easily across different models. This results in a large-scale CogniBench-L dataset, which facilitates training accurate detectors for both factual and cognitive hallucinations. We release our model and datasets at:... | Xiaqiang Tang, Jian Li, Keyu Hu, Nan Du, Xiaolong Li, Xi Zhang, Weigao Sun, Sihong Xie |  |

Consequently, a key research challenge is to transcend traditional knowledge transfer paradigms rooted in symbolic language and achieve genuine Parametric Knowledge Transfer (PKT). Significantly, exploring effective methods for transferring knowledge across LLMs of different scales through parameters presents an intriguing and valuable research direction. In this paper, we first demonstrate Alignment in parametric space is the fundamental prerequisite to achieve successful cross-scale PKT. We redefine the previously explored knowledge transfer as Post-Align PKT (PostPKT), which utilizes extracted parameters for LoRA initialization and requires subsequent fine-tune for alignment. Hence, to reduce cost for further fine-tuning, we introduce a novel Pre-Align PKT (PrePKT) paradigm and propose a solution called LaTen... | Yuqiao Tan, Shizhu He, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao |  |

However, this repeated independent process often leads to the same mistakes, making the selected solution still incorrect. We propose a novel prompting method named Stepwise Correction (StepCo) that helps LLMs identify and revise incorrect steps in their generated reasoning paths. It iterates verification and revision phases that employ a process-supervised verifier. The verify-then-revise process not only improves answer correctness but also reduces token consumption with fewer paths needed to generate. With StepCo, a series of LLMs demonstrate exceptional performance. Notably, using GPT-4o as the backend LLM, StepCo achieves an average accuracy of 94.1 across eight datasets, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art Best-of-N method by +2.4, while reducing... | Zhenyu Wu, Qingkai Zeng, Zhihan Zhang, Zhaoxuan Tan, Chao Shen, Meng Jiang |  |

Developing effective conversational agents for psychotherapy requires access to high-quality, real-world, long-term client-counselor interaction data, which is difficult to obtain due to privacy concerns. Although removing personally identifiable information is feasible, this process is labor-intensive. To address these challenges, we propose a novel privacy-preserving data reconstruction method that reconstructs real-world client-counselor dialogues while mitigating privacy concerns. We apply the RMRR (Retrieve, Mask, Reconstruct, Refine) method, which facilitates the creation of the privacy-preserving PsyDial dataset, with an average of 37.8 turns per dialogue. Extensive analysis demonstrates that PsyDial effectively reduces privacy risks while maintaining dialogue diversity and conversational exchange.

However, previous research has focused predominantly on optimizing these paths while neglecting the inconsistencies that may arise between generated responses and dialogue contexts, including user profiles, dialogue history, domain knowledge, and subgoals. To address this issue, we introduce a model-agnostic two-stage Consistency Reflection and Correction (CRC) framework. Specifically, in the consistency reflection stage, the model is prompted to reflect on the discrepancies between generated responses and dialogue contexts, identifying inconsistencies and suggesting possible corrections. In the consistency correction stage, the model generates responses that are more consistent with the dialogue context based on these reflection results. We conducted experiments on various model architectures with different parameter sizes,... | Didi Zhang, Yaxin Fan, Peifeng Li, Qiaoming Zhu |  |

This study reveals that LLMs are susceptible to “cognitive load” caused by distractor options in MCQs, leading to excessive attention to distractors and consequent vacillation between correct and incorrect options. To mitigate this cognitive burden, we introduce a novel reasoning prompt strategy, called EoT, which effectively reduces cognitive load by steering the model’s attention away from erroneous options. This enables the model to focus more effectively on reasonable answers. Additionally, by documenting the elimination process, EoT enhances the transparency and interpretability of the model’s reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that EoT, as a plug-and-play approach, significantly reduces cognitive load and improves performance, showcasing its potential to enhance both the accuracy and interpretability of LLMs. | Qihang Fu, Yongbin Qin, Ruizhang Huang, Yanping Chen, Yulin Zhou, Lintao Long |  |

However, they often falter when confronted with complex reasoning tasks that humans typically address through visual aids and deliberate, step-by-step thinking. While existing methods have explored text-based slow thinking or rudimentary visual assistance, they fall short of capturing the intricate, interleaved nature of human visual-verbal reasoning processes. To overcome these limitations and inspired by the mechanisms of slow thinking in human cognition, we introduce VisuoThink, a novel framework that seamlessly integrates visuospatial and linguistic domains. VisuoThink facilitates multimodal slow thinking by enabling progressive visual-textual reasoning and incorporates test-time scaling through look-ahead tree search.

While model merging offers a training-free solution to integrate multiple task-specific models, existing methods suffer from safety-utility conflicts where enhanced general capabilities degrade safety safeguards. We identify two root causes: neuron misidentification due to simplistic parameter magnitude-based selection, and cross-task neuron interference during merging.To address these challenges, we propose LED-Merging, a three-stage framework that Locates task-specific neurons via gradient-based attribution, dynamically Elects critical neurons through multi-model importance fusion, and Disjoints conflicting updates through parameter isolation.Extensive experiments on Llama-3-8B, Mistral-7B, and Llama2-13B demonstrate that LED-Merging effectively reduces harmful response rates, showing a 31.4% decrease on Llama-3-8B-Instruct on HarmBench, while simultaneously... | Qianli Ma, Dongrui Liu, Qian Chen, Linfeng Zhang, Jing Shao |  |

To combat this issue, we have introduced PerSphere, a benchmark designed to facilitate multi-faceted perspective retrieval and summarization, thus breaking free from these information silos. For each query within PerSphere, there are two opposing claims, each supported by distinct, non-overlapping perspectives drawn from one or more documents. Our goal is to accurately summarize these documents, aligning the summaries with the respective claims and their underlying perspectives. This task is structured as a two-step end-to-end pipeline that includes comprehensive document retrieval and multi-faceted summarization. Furthermore, we propose a set of metrics to evaluate the comprehensiveness of the retrieval and summarization content.

However, they sometimes generate responses that are logically coherent but factually incorrect or misleading, which is known as LLM hallucinations. Data-driven supervised methods train hallucination detectors by leveraging the internal states of LLMs, but detectors trained on specific domains often struggle to generalize well to other domains. In this paper, we aim to enhance the cross-domain performance of supervised detectors with only in-domain data. We propose a novel framework, prompt-guided internal states for hallucination detection of LLMs, namely PRISM. By utilizing appropriate prompts to guide changes to the structure related to text truthfulness in LLMs’ internal states, we make this structure more salient and consistent across texts from different domains. We integrated our framework with existing hallucination detection methods and conducted experiments... | Fujie Zhang, Peiqi Yu, Biao Yi, Baolei Zhang, Tong Li, Zheli Liu |  |

We introduce the \*Morphological Index\* (MoI), a typologically grounded metric that quantifies how strongly a language relies on surface morphology for noun classification. Building on MoI, we propose \*MoI-MoE\*, a Mixture of Experts model that routes inputs based on morphological structure. Evaluated on 10 Bantu languages—a large, morphologically rich and underrepresented family—MoI-MoE outperforms strong baselines, improving Swahili accuracy by 14 points on noun class recognition while maintaining performance on morphology-rich languages like Zulu. These findings highlight typological structure as a practical and interpretable signal for multilingual model adaptation. | Ndapa Nakashole |  |

Detecting and Contextualizing Harmful Language in Cultural Heritage Collections](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.1060/) |  | 0 | Cultural Heritage (CH) data hold invaluable knowledge, reflecting the history, traditions, and identities of societies, and shaping our understanding of the past and present. However, many CH collections contain outdated or offensive descriptions that reflect historical biases. CH Institutions (CHIs) face significant challenges in curating these data due to the vast scale and complexity of the task. To address this, we develop an AI-powered tool that detects offensive terms in CH metadata and provides contextual insights into their historical background and contemporary perception. We leverage a multilingual vocabulary co-created with marginalized communities, researchers, and CH professionals, along with traditional NLP techniques and Large Language Models (LLMs). Available as a standalone web app and integrated with major CH platforms, the tool has processed over 7.9 million records, contextualizing the contentious terms detected in their metadata.

However, their application to spoken language understanding (SLU) remains challenging, particularly for token-level tasks, where the autoregressive nature of LLMs often leads to misalignment issues. They also struggle to capture nuanced interrelations in semantic-level tasks through direct fine-tuning alone. To address these challenges, we propose the Entity-level Language Model (ECLM) framework, which reformulates slot-filling as an entity recognition task and introduces a novel concept, Chain of Intent, to enable step-by-step multi-intent recognition. Experimental results show that ECLM significantly outperforms strong baselines such as Uni-MIS, achieving gains of 3.7% on MixATIS and 3.1% on MixSNIPS. Compared to standard supervised fine-tuning of LLMs, ECLM further achieves improvements of 8.5% and 21.2% on these datasets, respectively.

However, these models often struggle with unfaithfulness issues, generating outputs that either ignore the retrieved context or inconsistently blend it with the LLM’s parametric knowledge. This issue is particularly severe in cases of knowledge conflict, where the retrieved context conflicts with the model’s parametric knowledge. While existing faithful RAG approaches enforce strict context adherence through well-designed prompts or modified decoding strategies, our analysis reveals a critical limitation: they achieve faithfulness by forcibly suppressing the model’s parametric knowledge, which undermines the model’s internal knowledge structure and increases the risk of misinterpreting the context. To this end, this paper proposes FaithfulRAG, a novel framework that resolves knowledge conflicts by explicitly modeling discrepancies between the... | Qinggang Zhang, Zhishang Xiang, Yilin Xiao, Le Wang, Junhui Li, Xinrun Wang, Jinsong Su |  |

However, most of the current benchmarks primarily focus on either personalization of text generation or direct tool-utilizing, without considering both. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark ETAPP for evaluating personalized tool invocation, establishing a sandbox environment, and a comprehensive dataset of 800 testing cases covering diverse user profiles. To improve the accuracy of our evaluation, we propose a key-point-based LLM evaluation method, mitigating biases in the LLM-as-a-judge system by manually annotating key points for each test case and providing them to LLM as the reference. Additionally, we evaluate the excellent LLMs and provide an in-depth analysis. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of different tool-invoking strategies on LLMs’ personalization performance and the effects of fine-tuning in our task.

Recent advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs) reveal significant potential for developing versatile agents that assist humans in navigating GUIs. However, current VLMs face challenges related to fundamental abilities, such as OCR and grounding, as well as a lack of knowledge about GUI elements functionalities and control methods. These limitations hinder their effectiveness as practical GUI agents. To address these challenges, we introduce GUICourse, a series of datasets for training visual-based GUI agents using general VLMs. First, we enhance the OCR and grounding capabilities of VLMs using the GUIEnv dataset. Next, we enrich the GUI knowledge of VLMs using the GUIAct and GUIChat datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that even a small-sized GUI agent (with 3.1 billion parameters) performs effectively on both single-step and multi-step GUI tasks.

Existing approaches typically rely on human annotators, making the process labor-intensive and creating a cognitive burden in generating diverse questions. To address this, we propose a semi-automated framework for constructing cultural VLM benchmarks, specifically targeting multiple-choice QA. This framework combines human-VLM collaboration, where VLMs generate questions based on guidelines, a small set of annotated examples, and relevant knowledge, followed by a verification process by native speakers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework through the creation of K-Viscuit, a dataset focused on Korean culture. Our experiments on this dataset reveal that open-source models lag behind proprietary ones in understanding Korean culture, highlighting key areas for improvement.

Prior works have found that distilling a larger BERT with superior performance may degrade student’s performance than a smaller BERT. In this paper, we investigate the limitations of existing KD methods for larger BERT models. Through Canonical Correlation Analysis, we identify that these methods fail to fully exploit the potential advantages of larger teachers. To address this, we propose an improved distillation approach that effectively enhances knowledge transfer. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in enabling larger BERT models to distill knowledge more efficiently. | WenShu Fan, Su Lu, Shangyu Xing, XinChun Li, DeChuan Zhan |  |

A Comprehensive Evaluation of LLMs on Formal Specification Inference](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.1068/) |  | 0 | Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to automate programming tasks. However, the capabilities of LLMs in reasoning about program semantics are still inadequately studied, leaving substantial potential for further exploration. This paper introduces FormalBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) on program semantics. Specifically, it utilizes the task of synthesizing formal program specifications as a proxy measure for assessing the semantic reasoning of LLMs. This task requires both comprehensive reasoning over all possible program executions and the generation of precise, syntactically correct expressions that adhere to formal syntax and semantics. Using this benchmark, we evaluated the ability of LLMs to synthesize consistent and complete specifications. Our findings show that LLMs perform well with simple control flows but struggle with more complex structures, especially loops, even with... | Thanh LeCong, Bach Le, Toby Murray |  |

Existing literature primarily concentrates on binary, document-level detection, thereby neglecting texts that are composed jointly by human and LLM contributions. Hence, this paper explores the possibility of fine-grained MGT detection under human-AI coauthoring.We suggest fine-grained detectors can pave pathways toward coauthored text detection with a numeric AI ratio.Specifically, we propose a dataset, HACo-Det, which produces human-AI coauthored texts via an automatic pipeline with word-level attribution labels. We retrofit seven prevailing document-level detectors to generalize them to word-level detection.Then we evaluate these detectors on HACo-Det on both word- and sentence-level detection tasks.Empirical results show that metric-based methods struggle to conduct fine-grained detection with a 0.462 average F1 score, while finetuned models show... | Zhixiong Su, Yichen Wang, Herun Wan, Zhaohan Zhang, Minnan Luo |  |

These technologies pose a threat of misuse for identity theft and the spread of misinformation. Consequently, the misuse of such powerful technologies necessitates the development of robust and generalizable audio deepfake detection (ADD) and anti-spoofing models. However, such models are often linguistically biased. Consequently, the models trained on datasets in one language exhibit a low accuracy when evaluated on out-of-domain languages. Such biases reduce the usability of these models and highlight the urgent need for multilingual synthetic speech datasets for bias mitigation research. However, most available datasets are in English or Chinese. The dearth of multilingual synthetic datasets hinders multilingual ADD and anti-spoofing research. Furthermore, the problem intensifies in countries with rich linguistic diversity,... | Divya V. Sharma, Vijval Ekbote, Anubha Gupta |  |

Recently, generation-augmented methods have emerged as a promising solution to this problem. These methods enhance raw queries by incorporating additional information from an LLM-based generator, facilitating more direct retrieval of relevant documents. However, existing methods struggle with highly specialized situations that require extensive domain expertise. To address this problem, we present Reinforced-IR, a novel approach that jointly adapts a pre-trained retriever and generator for precise cross-domain retrieval. A key innovation of Reinforced-IR is its Self-Boosting framework, which enables retriever and generator to learn from each other’s feedback. Specifically, the generator is reinforced to generate query augmentations that enhance the retriever’s performance, while the retriever is trained to better discriminate the relevant documents identified by... | Chaofan Li, Jianlyu Chen, Yingxia Shao, Chaozhuo Li, Quanqing Xu, Defu Lian, Zheng Liu |  |

Most existing studies in multimodal retrieval focus on capturing information in multimodal data that is similar to their paired texts, but often ignores the complementary information contained in multimodal data. In this study, we propose CIEA, a novel multimodal retrieval approach that employs Complementary Information Extraction and Alignment, which transforms both text and images in documents into a unified latent space and features a complementary information extractor designed to identify and preserve differences in the image representations. We optimize CIEA using two complementary contrastive losses to ensure semantic integrity and effectively capture the complementary information contained in images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CIEA, which achieves significant improvements over both divide-and-conquer models and universal dense retrieval models.

However, the contribution of the input prompt to the generated content still remains obscure to humans, underscoring the necessity of understanding the causality between input and output pairs. Existing works for providing prompt-specific explanation often confine model output to be classification or next-word prediction. Few initial attempts aiming to explain the entire language generation often treat input prompt texts independently, ignoring their combinatorial effects on the follow-up generation. In this study, we introduce a counterfactual explanation framework based on joint prompt attribution, JoPA, which aims to explain how a few prompt texts collaboratively influences the LLM’s complete generation. Particularly, we formulate the task of prompt attribution for generation interpretation as a combinatorial optimization problem, and introduce a probabilistic algorithm to... | Yurui Chang, Bochuan Cao, Yujia Wang, Jinghui Chen, Lu Lin |  |

Existing studies focus on optimizing model structures to handle modality missingness, but models still face challenges in robustness when dealing with uncertain missingness. To this end, we propose a data-centric robust multimodal sentiment analysis method, Proxy-Driven Robust Multimodal Fusion (P-RMF). First, we map unimodal data to the latent space of Gaussian distributions to capture core features and structure, thereby learn stable modality representation. Then, we combine the quantified inherent modality uncertainty to learn stable multimodal joint representation (i.e., proxy modality), which is further enhanced through multi-layer dynamic cross-modal injection to increase its diversity. Extensive experimental results show that P-RMF outperforms existing models in noise resistance and achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets.

To enhance this retrieval phase, current query expansion (QE) techniques leverage pre-trained language models (PLM) to mitigate word mismatches and improve the recall of relevant documents. Despite their advancements, these techniques often treat all expanded terms uniformly, which can lead to less-than-optimal retrieval outcomes. In response, we propose a novel Recall-oriented Adaptive Learning (ReAL) method, which iteratively adjusts the importance weights of QE terms based on their relevance, thereby refining term distinction and enhancing the separation of relevant terms. Specifically, ReAL employs a similarity-based model to classify documents into pseudo-relevant and pseudo-irrelevant sets, and then optimizes term weights via two... | Xinran Chen, Ben He, Xuanang Chen, Le Sun |  |

However, existing methods often suffer from limitations, including high intra-group similarity, loss of semantic information, and insufficient inference capability, particularly in complex relation patterns such as 1-N and N-1 relations. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel KGE framework that leverages mutual information maximization to improve the semantic representation of entities and relations. By maximizing the mutual information between different components of triples, such as (h, r) and t, or (r, t) and h, the proposed method improves the model’s ability to preserve semantic dependencies while maintaining the relational structure of the knowledge graph. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with consistent performance improvements across various baseline models.

We investigate the mechanisms behind this discrepancy and find that alignment surprisingly amplifies implicit bias in model outputs. Specifically, we show that aligned LMs, unlike their unaligned counterparts, overlook racial concepts in early internal representations when the context is ambiguous. Not representing race likely fails to activate safety guardrails, leading to unintended biases. Inspired by this insight, we propose a new bias mitigation strategy that works by incentivizing the representation of racial concepts in the early model layers. In contrast to conventional mitigation methods of machine unlearning, our interventions find that steering the model to be more aware of racial concepts effectively mitigates implicit bias. Similar to race blindness in humans, ignoring racial... | Lihao Sun, Chengzhi Mao, Valentin Hofmann, Xuechunzi Bai |  |

However, on the one hand, there is only a certain amount of complex instruction evaluation data; on the other hand, there are no dedicated algorithms to improve the ability to follow complex instructions. To this end, this paper introduces Trace, a benchmark for improving and evaluating the complex instruction-following ability, which consists of 120K training data and 1K evaluation data. Furthermore, we propose IOPO (Input-Output Preference Optimization) alignment method which takes both input and output preference pairs into consideration, where LLMs not only rapidly align with response preferences but also meticulously explore the instruction preferences. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets confirm the effectiveness... | Xinghua Zhang, Haiyang Yu, Cheng Fu, Fei Huang, Yongbin Li |  |

Existing approaches—training separate models for each jurisdiction or using a single shared model—either fail to leverage common legal principles beneficial for low-resource settings or risk negative interference from conflicting jurisdictional interpretations. To overcome these limitations, we propose a parameter-efficient framework ProMALex, that first derives hierarchical relationships across jurisdictions and progressively inserts adapter modules across model layers based on jurisdictional similarity. This design allows modules in lower layers to be shared across jurisdictions, capturing common legal principles, while higher layers specialize through jurisdiction-specific adapters. Experimental results on two legal language modeling benchmarks demonstrate that ProMALex outperforms both fully shared and jurisdiction-specific models. | T. Y. S. S.

However, in tasks like text matching, smaller fine-tuned models often produce more effective domain-specific representations as they focus on optimizing the similarity between input pairs. To combine the specialized strengths of small models with the rich semantic understanding of LLMs, we propose a flipped knowledge distillation paradigm, where the LLM learns from the SLM. To bridge the architectural gap between commonly used decoder-only LLMs and the encoder-based frameworks of smaller models, we reinterpret LLMs as encoder-decoder models using LoRA. In this setup, the encoder generates compressed text representations, while the decoder transforms them into the output space. During training, the encoder produces text representations and computes their similarities, which are then aligned with the similarity scores produced by the teacher model.

Extensive evaluations are conducted on a wide range of models, revealing a notable “Cultural-Linguistic Synergy” phenomenon, where models exhibit better performance when questions are culturally aligned with the language. This phenomenon is further explored through interpretability probing, which shows that a higher proportion of specific neurons are activated in a language’s cultural context. This activation proportion could serve as a potential indicator for evaluating multilingual performance during model training.

Prior machine learning approaches rely on stylistic and meta-data features, but do not prioritise adaptability to author-specific behaviours. As a result, they struggle to effectively model the behaviour of specific sockpuppet-groups, especially when text data is limited. To address this, we propose the application of meta-learning, a machine learning technique designed to improve performance in data-scarce settings by training models across multiple tasks. Meta-learning optimises a model for rapid adaptation to the writing style of a new sockpuppet-group. Our results show that meta-learning significantly enhances the precision of predictions compared to pre-trained models, marking an advancement in combating sockpuppetry on open editing platforms.

This process is crucial for improving the robustness and generalization capabilities of NLP models. However, a significant challenge remains: Insufficient Attention to Sample Distribution Diversity. Most existing methods focus on increasing the sample numbers while neglecting the sample distribution diversity, which can lead to model overfitting. In response, we explore data augmentation’s impact on dataset diversity and propose a Diversity-oriented data Augmentation framework (DoAug). Specifically, we utilize a diversity-oriented fine-tuning approach to train a large language model (LLM) as a diverse paraphraser, which is capable of augmenting textual datasets by generating diversified paraphrases. Then, we apply the LLM paraphraser to a selected coreset of highly informative samples and integrate the paraphrases with the original data to... | Zaitian Wang, Jinghan Zhang, Xinhao Zhang, Kunpeng Liu, Pengfei Wang, Yuanchun Zhou |  |

However, these methods fall short of ensuring contamination-resilient evaluation, as they fail to fully eliminate pre-existing knowledge from models or preserve the semantic complexity of the original datasets. To address these limitations, we propose CoreEval, a Contamination-resilient Evaluation strategy for automatically updating data with real-world knowledge. This approach begins by extracting entity relationships from the original data and leveraging the GDELT database to retrieve relevant and up-to-date knowledge. The retrieved knowledge is then recontextualized and integrated with the original data, which is refined and restructured to ensure semantic coherence and enhanced... | Jingqian Zhao, Bingbing Wang, Geng Tu, Yice Zhang, Qianlong Wang, Bin Liang, Jing Li, Ruifeng Xu |  |

Existing methods for automatic prompt optimization face two challenges: lack of diversity, limiting the exploration of valuable and innovative directions and semantic drift, where optimizations for one task can degrade performance in others. To address these issues, we propose Residual Optimization Tree (RiOT), a novel framework for automatic prompt optimization. RiOT iteratively refines prompts through text gradients, generating multiple semantically diverse candidates at each step, and selects the best prompt using perplexity. Additionally, RiOT incorporates the text residual connection to mitigate semantic drift by selectively retaining beneficial content across optimization iterations. A tree structure efficiently manages the optimization process, ensuring scalability and flexibility.... | Chenyi Zhou, Zhengyan Shi, Yuan Yao, Lei Liang, Huajun Chen, Qiang Zhang |  |

A general scenario is proposed where both the user and the agent are benign, and the environment, while not malicious, contains unrelated content. A wide range of MLLMs are evaluated as GUI agents using a simulated dataset, following three working patterns with different levels of perception. Experimental results reveal that even the most powerful models, whether generalist agents or specialist GUI agents, are susceptible to distractions.

This task is inherently complex, requiring evaluations that range from object presence and attribute correctness to relational consistency and visual fidelity. Consequently, current state-of-the-art MLLM-based approaches often rely on powerful commercial models such as GPT-4o, which offer superior reasoning and instruction-following capabilities but are not universally accessible. In contrast, while open-source MLLMs demonstrate promising skills in vision and language understanding, they underperform in comprehensive image quality assessment.To address these challenges, we propose a task decomposition evaluation framework based on GPT-4o to automatically construct a specialized training dataset, breaking down the multifaceted evaluation process into simpler sub-tasks and thus reducing learning... | RongCheng Tu, ZiAo Ma, Tian Lan, Yuehao Zhao, Heyan Huang, XianLing Mao |  |

To resolve this problem, we propose a progressive retrieval and rewriting method, namely ChainRAG, which sequentially handles each sub-question by completing missing key entities and retrieving relevant sentences from a sentence graph for answer generation. Each step in our retrieval and rewriting process builds upon the previous one, creating a seamless chain that leads to accurate retrieval and answers. Finally, all retrieved sentences and sub-question answers are integrated to generate a comprehensive answer to the original question. We evaluate ChainRAG on three multi-hop QA datasets—MuSiQue, 2Wiki, and HotpotQA—using three large language models:... | Rongzhi Zhu, Xiangyu Liu, Zequn Sun, Yiwei Wang, Wei Hu |  |

However, directly applying parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques to tabular tasks presents significant challenges, particularly in terms of better table serialization and the representation of two-dimensional structured information within a one-dimensional sequence. To address this, we propose TableLoRA, a module designed to improve LLMs’ understanding of table structure during PEFT. It incorporates special tokens for serializing tables with special token encoder and uses 2D LoRA to encode low-rank information on cell positions. Experiments on four tabular-related datasets demonstrate that TableLoRA consistently outperforms vanilla LoRA and surpasses various table encoding methods tested in control experiments. These findings reveal that TableLoRA, as a table-specific LoRA, enhances the ability of LLMs to process tabular... | Xinyi He, Yihao Liu, Mengyu Zhou, Yeye He, Haoyu Dong, Shi Han, Zejian Yuan, Dongmei Zhang |  |

However, the availability of high-quality human-annotated SFT data has become a significant bottleneck for LLMs, necessitating a greater reliance on synthetic training data. In this work, we introduce Condor, a two-stage synthetic data generation framework that incorporates World Knowledge Trees and Self-Reflection Refinement to produce high-quality SFT data at scale. Our experimental results demonstrate that a base model fine-tuned on only 20K Condor-generated samples achieves superior performance compared to instruct model trained with RLHF. The additional refinement stage in Condor further enables iterative self-improvement for LLMs at various scales (up to 72B), validating the effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, our investigation into the scaling of synthetic data in post-training reveals substantial unexplored potential for... | Maosongcao Maosongcao, Taolin Zhang, Mo Li, Chuyu Zhang, Yunxin Liu, Conghui He, Haodong Duan, Songyang Zhang, Kai Chen |  |

This cultural bias not only undermines universal equality but also risks reinforcing stereotypes and perpetuating discrimination. To address this, we propose CulFiT, a novel culturally-aware training paradigm that leverages multilingual data and fine-grained reward modeling to enhance cultural sensitivity and inclusivity. Our approach synthesizes diverse cultural-related questions, constructs critique data in multiple culturally relevant languages, and employs fine-grained rewards to decompose cultural texts into verifiable knowledge units for interpretable evaluation. We also introduce GlobalOpinionQA, a multilingual open-ended question-answering dataset designed to evaluate culturally-aware responses in a global context.

Existing attribution methods for dense models fail to capture dynamic routing-expert interactions in sparse MoE architectures. To address this issue, we propose a cross-level attribution algorithm to analyze sparse MoE architectures (Qwen 1.5-MoE, OLMoE, Mixtral-8x7B) against dense models (Qwen 1.5-7B, Llama-7B, Mistral-7B). Results show MoE models achieve 31% higher per-layer efficiency via a “mid-activation, late-amplification” pattern: early layers screen experts, while late layers refine knowledge collaboratively. Ablation studies reveal a “basic-refinement” framework—shared experts handle general tasks (entity recognition), while routed experts specialize in domain-specific processing (geographic attributes). Semantic-driven routing is evidenced by strong correlations between attention heads and experts (r=0.68), enabling task-aware coordination.

However, these models often suffer from hallucinations, where generated text sequences conflict with the provided visual data. To address this, we introduce Post-Hoc Visual Attribution for Charts, which identifies fine-grained chart elements that validate a given chart-associated response. We propose ChartLens, a novel chart attribution algorithm that uses segmentation-based techniques to identify chart objects and employs set-of-marks prompting with MLLMs for fine-grained visual attribution. Additionally, we present ChartVA-Eval, a benchmark with synthetic and real-world charts from diverse domains like finance, policy, and economics, featuring fine-grained attribution annotations. Our evaluations show that ChartLens improves fine-grained attributions by 26-66%. | Manan Suri, Puneet Mathur, Nedim Lipka, Franck Dernoncourt, Ryan A. Rossi, Dinesh Manocha |  |

Model scaling-up offers a promising solution by leveraging the parameters of smaller models to create larger ones. However, existing depth scaling-up methods rely on empirical heuristic rules for layer duplication, which result in poorer initialization and slower convergence during continual pre-training. We propose LESA, a novel learnable method for depth scaling-up. By concatenating parameters from each layer and applying Singular Value Decomposition, we uncover latent patterns between layers, suggesting that inter-layer parameters can be learned. LESA uses a neural network to predict the parameters inserted between adjacent layers, enabling better initialization and faster training. Experiments show that LESA outperforms existing baselines, achieving superior performance with less than half the computational cost during continual pre-training.

However, their abilities to memorize, recall, and reason in sustained interactions within real-world scenarios remain underexplored. This paper introduces MMRC, a Multi-Modal Real-world Conversation benchmark for evaluating six core open-ended abilities of MLLMs: information extraction, multi-turn reasoning, information update, image management, memory recall, and answer refusal. With data collected from real-world scenarios, MMRC comprises 5,120 conversations and 28,720 corresponding manually labeled questions, posing a significant challenge to existing MLLMs. Evaluations on 20 MLLMs in MMRC indicate an accuracy drop during open-ended interactions.

As a critical issue facing LM distillation, a superior student often arises from a teacher of a relatively small scale instead of a larger one, especially in the presence of substantial capacity gap between the teacher and student. This issue, often referred to as the curse of capacity gap, suggests that there is likely an optimal teacher yielding the best-performing student along the scaling course of the teacher. Consequently, distillation trials on teachers of a wide range of scales are called for to determine the optimal teacher, which becomes computationally intensive in the context of large LMs (LLMs). This paper addresses this critical bottleneck by providing the law of capacity gap inducted from a preliminary study on distilling a broad range of small-scale (<3B) LMs, where the optimal teacher consistently scales linearly with the student scale across different model... | Chen Zhang, Qiuchi Li, Dawei Song, Zheyu Ye, Yan Gao, Yao Hu |  |

We introduce \*\*WhiSPA\*\* (\*\*Whi\*\*sper with \*\*S\*\*emantic and \*\*P\*\*sychological \*\*A\*\*lignment), which leverages a novel audio training objective: contrastive loss with a language model embedding as a teacher. Using over 500k speech segments from mental health audio interviews, we evaluate the utility of aligning Whisper’s latent space with semantic representations from a text autoencoder (SBERT) and lexically derived embeddings of basic psychological dimensions: emotion and personality. Over self-supervised affective tasks and downstream psychological tasks, WhiSPA surpasses current speech encoders, achieving an average error reduction of 73.4% and 83.8%,... | Rajath Rao, Adithya V.

While locate-and-edit methods address this, their reliance on models’ internal representations leads to robustness failures in long-context reasoning and paraphrased queries. We identify a fundamental limitation of locate-and-edit methods: existing semantic keys (for memory localization) cannot simultaneously satisfy robustness (context-invariant activation) and specificity (precise knowledge discrimination). Through theoretical error-bound analysis, we establish formal criteria for effective editing.Our solution introduces Robust Edit Pathway (REP), a plug-and-play module that: (1) disentangles editing keys from native model representations; (2) dynamically adjusts keys via contrastive learning to achieve robustness-specificity balance.

While large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency in analyzing and reasoning through complex tasks, they still encounter substantial challenges in molecular structure elucidation. We identify that these challenges largely stem from LLMs’ limited grasp of specialized chemical knowledge. In this work, we introduce a Knowledge-enhanced reasoning framework for Molecular Structure Elucidation (K-MSE), leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search for test-time scaling as a plugin. Specifically, we construct an external molecular substructure knowledge base to extend the LLMs’ coverage of the chemical structure space. Furthermore, we design a specialized molecule-spectrum scorer to act as a reward model for the reasoning process, addressing the issue of inaccurate solution evaluation in LLMs. Experimental results show that... | Xiang Zhuang, Bin Wu, Jiyu Cui, Kehua Feng, Xiaotong Li, Huabin Xing, Keyan Ding, Qiang Zhang, Huajun Chen |  |

Meta-evaluation benchmarks support the development of automatic evaluators that correlate well with human judgement. However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on English or use translated data, which fails to capture cultural nuances. A native approach provides a better representation of the end user experience.In this work, we develop a Multilingual End-to-end Meta-Evaluation RAG benchmark MEMERAG. Our benchmark builds on the popular MIRACL dataset, using native-language questions and generating responses with diverse large language models (LLMs), which are then assessed by expert annotators for faithfulness and relevance. We describe our annotation process and show that it achieves high inter-annotator agreement.

Despite this, the role of visual information in reasoning has been underexplored. Our findings show that existing multimodal mathematical models minimally leverage visual information, and model performance remains largely unaffected by changes to or removal of images in the dataset. We attribute this to the dominance of textual information and answer options that inadvertently guide the model to correct answers. To improve evaluation methods, we introduce the HC-M3D dataset, specifically designed to require image reliance for problem-solving and to challenge models with similar, yet distinct, images that change the correct answer. In testing leading models, their failure to detect these subtle visual differences suggests limitations in current visual perception capabilities.

Humans infer others’ thoughts by integrating causal cues and indirect clues from broad contextual information, often derived from past interactions. In other words, human ToM heavily relies on the understanding about the backgrounds and life stories of others. Unfortunately, this aspect is largely overlooked in existing benchmarks for evaluating machines’ ToM capabilities, due to their usage of short narratives without global context, especially personal background of characters. In this paper, we verify the importance of comprehensive contextual understanding about personal backgrounds in ToM and assess the performance of LLMs in such complex scenarios. To achieve this, we introduce CharToM-QA benchmark, comprising 1,035 ToM questions based on characters from classic novels.

However, existing approaches to incentivize LLMs’ deep thinking abilities generally require large-scale data or significant training efforts. Meanwhile, it remains unclear how to improve the thinking abilities of less powerful base models. In this work, we introduce S2R, an efficient framework that enhances LLM reasoning by teaching models to self-verify and self-correct during inference. Specifically, we first initialize LLMs with iterative self-verification and self-correction behaviors through supervised fine-tuning on carefully curated data. The self-verification and self-correction skills are then further strengthened by outcome-level and process-level reinforcement learning with minimized resource requirements. Our results demonstrate that, with only 3.1k behavior initialization samples, Qwen2.5-math-7B achieves an accuracy improvement from 51.0% to 81.6%, outperforming models trained on an equivalent... | Ruotian Ma, Peisong Wang, Cheng Liu, Xingyan Liu, Jiaqi Chen, Bang Zhang, Xin Zhou, Nan Du, Jia Li |  |

By prompting agents to assign clear roles, it is possible to facilitate cooperation and achieve complementary capabilities among LLMs. A common strategy involves adopting a relatively general role assignment mechanism, such as introducing a “judge” or a “summarizer”. However, these approaches lack task-specific role customization based on task characteristics. Another strategy involves decomposing the task based on domain knowledge and task characteristics, followed by assigning appropriate roles according to LLMs’ respective strengths, such as programmers and testers. However, in some given tasks, obtaining domain knowledge related to task characteristics and getting the strengths of different LLMs is hard. To solve these problems, we propose a Multi-LLM Cooperation (MLC) framework with automatic role assignment capabilities.

To further enhance this accessibility, recent research has focused on generating VPL code from user instructions using large language models (LLMs). Specifically, by employing prompting-based methods, these studies have shown promising results. Nevertheless, such approaches can be less effective for industrial VPLs such as Ladder Diagram (LD). LD is a pivotal language used in industrial automation processes and involves extensive domain-specific configurations, which are difficult to capture in a single prompt. In this work, we demonstrate that training-based methods outperform prompting-based methods for LD generation accuracy, even with smaller backbone models. Building on these findings, we propose a two-stage training strategy to further enhance VPL generation.

Yet, existing work treats critical text assessment as a black box problem, limiting interpretability and human-AI collaboration. To close this gap, we introduce Structured Reasoning in Critical Text Assessment (STRICTA), a novel specification framework to model text assessment as an explicit, step-wise reasoning process. STRICTA breaks down the assessment into a graph of interconnected reasoning steps drawing on causality theory (Pearl, 1995). This graph is populated based on expert interaction data and used to study the assessment process and facilitate human-AI collaboration. We formally define STRICTA and apply it in a study on biomedical paper assessment, resulting in a dataset of over 4000 reasoning steps from roughly 40 biomedical experts on more than 20 papers.

Detecting LLM-generated comments (LGC) in online news is essential for preserving online discourse integrity and preventing opinion manipulation. However, effective detection faces two key challenges; the brevity and informality of news comments limit traditional methods, and the absence of a publicly available LGC dataset hinders model training, especially for languages other than English. To address these challenges, we propose a twofold approach. First, we develop an LGC generation framework to construct a high-quality dataset with diverse and complex examples. Second, we introduce XDAC (XAI-Driven Detection and Attribution of LLM-Generated Comments), a framework utilizing explainable AI, designed for the detection and attribution of short-form LGC in Korean news articles.

Newer forms of real-time engagement (e.g., users commenting on live streams) on platforms like Twitch exert additional pressures on the latency expected of such moderation systems. Despite their prevalence, relatively little is known about the effectiveness of these systems. In this paper, we conduct an audit of Twitch’s automated moderation tool (AutoMod) to investigate its effectiveness in flagging hateful content. For our audit, we create streaming accounts to act as siloed test beds, and interface with the live chat using Twitch’s APIs to send over 107,000 comments collated from 4 datasets. We measure AutoMod‘s accuracy in flagging blatantly hateful content containing misogyny, racism, ableism and homophobia. Our experiments reveal that a large fraction of hateful messages, up to 94% on some datasets, bypass moderation.

We integrate an SDEdit-based editing technique that allows for broad adjustments in the degree of text editing. Additionally, we introduce a novel fine-level editing method based on self-conditioning, which allows subtle control of reference text. While being capable of editing on its own, this fine-grained method, integrated with the SDEdit approach, enables EdiText to make precise adjustments within the desired range. EdiText demonstrates its controllability to robustly adjust reference text at a broad range of levels across various tasks, including toxicity control and sentiment control. | Che Hyun Lee, Heeseung Kim, Jiheum Yeom, Sungroh Yoon |  |

However, preparing such benchmarks in high quality native language is often costly and therefore limits the representativeness of evaluation datasets. While recent efforts focused on building more inclusive MMLU benchmarks, these are conventionally built using machine translation from high-resource languages, which may introduce errors and fail to account for the linguistic and cultural intricacies of the target languages. In this paper, we address the lack of native language MMLU benchmark especially in the under-represented Turkic language family with distinct morphosyntactic and cultural characteristics. We propose two benchmarks for Turkic language MMLU: TUMLU is a comprehensive, multilingual, and natively developed language understanding benchmark specifically designed for Turkic languages.

However, existing methods often require extensive training on large-scale datasets, posing challenges in low-resource, domain-specific scenarios. In this work, we show that a pretrained large language model can be converted into a strong text encoder without additional training. We first conduct a comprehensive empirical study to investigate different conversion strategies and identify the impact of the attention sink phenomenon on the performance of converted encoder models. Based on our findings, we propose a novel approach that enables bidirectional attention and suppresses the attention sink phenomenon, resulting in superior performance.

Though it shows success in previous studies, recent research reported a near-random performance in different settings, highlighting a significant performance inconsistency. We assume that a single setting doesn’t represent the distribution of the vast corpora, causing members and non-members with different distributions to be sampled and causing inconsistency. In this study, instead of a single setting, we statistically revisit MIA methods from various settings with thousands of experiments for each MIA method, along with study in text feature, embedding, threshold decision, and decoding dynamics of members and non-members. We found that (1) MIA performance improves with model size and varies with domains, while most methods do not statistically outperform baselines, (2) Though MIA... | Bowen Chen, Namgi Han, Yusuke Miyao |  |

However, the abilities of language models in this area are largely unexplored as previous work has tested their abilities for logical reasoning in terms of time and space in isolation or only in simple or artificial environments. In this paper, we present the first evaluation of the ability of language models to jointly reason over time and space. To enable our analysis, we create GeoTemp, a dataset of 320k prompts covering 289 cities in 217 countries and 37 time zones. Using GeoTemp, we evaluate eight open chat models of three different model families for different combinations of temporal and geographic knowledge. We find that most models perform well on reasoning tasks involving only temporal knowledge and that overall performance improves with scale. However, performance remains constrained in tasks that require connecting temporal and geographical information.

We focus on the identification of moral foundations (e.g., care, fairness, loyalty) and human values (e.g., be polite, be honest) in text. We select three standard datasets and proceed into two steps. First, we focus on HLV and analyze the linguistic features (complexity, polarity, pragmatic phenomena, lexical choices) that correlate with HLV. Next, we proceed to uncertainty and its relationship to HLV. We experiment with RoBERTa and Flan-T5 in a number of training setups and evaluation metrics that test the calibration of uncertainty to HLV and its relationship to performance beyond majority vote; next, we analyze the impact of linguistic features on uncertainty. We find that... | Neele Falk, Gabriella Lapesa |  |

Dogma": Testing LLM Generalization through Humor](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.1117/) |  | 0 | Humor, requiring creativity and contextual understanding, is a hallmark of human intelligence, showcasing adaptability across linguistic scenarios. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning on various benchmarks, it remains unclear whether they truly adapt to new tasks like humans (i.e., generalize) or merely replicate memorized content. To explore this, we introduce Phunny, a new humor-based question-answering benchmark designed to assess LLMs’ reasoning through carefully crafted puns. Our dataset is manually curated to ensure novelty and minimize data contamination, providing a robust evaluation of LLMs’ linguistic comprehension. Experiments on pun comprehension, resolution, and generation reveal that most LLMs struggle with generalization, even on simple tasks, consistently underperforming the human baseline. Additionally, our detailed error analysis provides valuable insights to guide future research. | Alessio Cocchieri, Luca Ragazzi, Paolo Italiani, Giuseppe Tagliavini, Gianluca Moro |  |

While recent efforts have made significant advancements by leveraging the internal logic and linguistic features of LLMs to estimate uncertainty scores, our empirical analysis highlights the pitfalls of these methods to strike a harmonized estimation between indication, balance, and calibration, which hinders their broader capability for accurate uncertainty estimation. To address this challenge, we propose CUE (Corrector for Uncertainty Estimation): A straightforward yet effective method that employs a lightweight model trained on data aligned with the target LLM’s performance to adjust uncertainty scores. Comprehensive experiments across diverse models and tasks demonstrate its effectiveness, which achieves consistent improvements of up to 60% over existing methods. | Rui Li, Jing Long, Muge Qi, Heming Xia, Lei Sha, Peiyi Wang, Zhifang Sui |  |

However, existing alignment paradigms often model an averaged or monolithic preference, failing to account for the diversity of perspectives across cultures, demographics, and communities. This limitation is particularly critical in health-related scenarios, where plurality is essential due to the influence of culture, religion, personal values, and conflicting opinions. Despite progress in pluralistic alignment, no prior work has focused on health, likely due to the unavailability of publicly available datasets. To address this gap, we introduce VITAL, a new benchmark dataset comprising 13.1K value-laden situations and 5.4K multiple-choice questions focused on health, designed to assess and benchmark pluralistic alignment methodologies. Through extensive evaluation of eight LLMs of varying sizes, we demonstrate that existing pluralistic alignment... | Anudeex Shetty, Amin Beheshti, Mark Dras, Usman Naseem |  |

Quantifying and Monitoring AIGT on Social Media](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.1120/) |  | 0 | Social media platforms are experiencing a growing presence of AI-Generated Texts (AIGTs). However, the misuse of AIGTs could have profound implications for public opinion, such as spreading misinformation and manipulating narratives. Despite its importance, it remains unclear how prevalent AIGTs are on social media. To address this gap, this paper aims to quantify and monitor the AIGTs on online social media platforms. We first collect a dataset (SM-D) with around 2.4M posts from 3 major social media platforms: Medium, Quora, and Reddit. Then, we construct a diverse dataset (AIGTBench) to train and evaluate AIGT detectors. AIGTBench combines popular open-source datasets and our AIGT datasets generated from social media texts by 12 LLMs, serving as a benchmark for evaluating mainstream detectors. With this setup, we identify the best-performing detector (OSM-Det). We then apply OSM-Det to SM-D to track AIGTs across social media platforms from January 2022 to October 2024, using the AI... | Zhen Sun, Zongmin Zhang, Xinyue Shen, Ziyi Zhang, Yule Liu, Michael Backes, Yang Zhang, Xinlei He |  |

We introduce Cross-Lingual Continued Instruction Tuning (X-CIT), which fully leverages translation-based parallel instruction data to enhance cross-lingual adaptability. X-CIT emulates the human process of second language acquisition and is guided by Chomsky’s Principles and Parameters Theory. It first fine-tunes the LLM on English instruction data to establish foundational capabilities (i.e. Principles), then continues with target language translation and customized chat-instruction data to adjust “parameters” specific to the target language. This chat-instruction data captures alignment information in translated parallel data, guiding the model to initially think and respond in its native language before transitioning to the target language. To further mimic human learning progression, we incorporate Self-Paced Learning (SPL) during... | Linjuan Wu, Haoran Wei, Baosong Yang, Weiming Lu |  |

As a result, EaaS watermarks are introduced to protect the intellectual property of EaaS providers. In this paper, we first show that existing EaaS watermarks can be removed by paraphrasing when attackers clone the model. Subsequently, we propose a novel watermarking technique that involves linearly transforming the embeddings, and show that it is empirically and theoretically robust against paraphrasing. | Anudeex Shetty, Qiongkai Xu, Jey Han Lau |  |

We argue that long-term decay is outdated in the era of LLMs, as LLMs are now applied to tasks demanding precise retrieval of in-context information from arbitrary positions. Firstly, we present empirical analyses on various PEs, demonstrating that models inherently learn attention with only a local-decay pattern while forming a U-shape pattern globally, contradicting the principle of long-term decay. Furthermore, we conduct a detailed analysis of rotary position encoding (RoPE, a prevalent relative positional encoding in LLMs), and found that the U-shape attention is caused by some learned components, which are also the key factor limiting RoPE’s expressiveness and extrapolation. Inspired by these insights, we propose High-frequency rotary Position Encoding (HoPE). HoPE... | Yuhan Chen, Ang Lv, Jian Luan, Bin Wang, Wei Liu |  |

While quantization has shown promise for LLMs, current methods typically require lengthy training to alleviate the performance degradation from quantization loss. However, deploying LLMs across diverse scenarios with different resource constraints, e.g., servers and personal computers, requires repeated training per application, which amplifies the lengthy training problem. Given that, it is advantageous to train a once-for-all (OFA) supernet capable of yielding diverse optimal subnets for downstream applications through one-shot training. Nonetheless, the scale of current language models impedes efficiency and amplifies interference from weight sharing between subnets. We make an initial attempt to extend the once-for-all framework to large language models. Specifically, we decouple shared weights to eliminate the interference and incorporate Low-Rank adapters for training efficiency. Furthermore,... | Ke Yi, Yuhui Xu, Heng Chang, Yuan Meng, Tong Zhang, Jia Li |  |

However, prevailing approaches accomplish this by predominantly focusing on matching the final output distributions of student/teacher models. Drawing on the perspective that transformers can be viewed as discretizing ordinary differential equation (ODEs) on integer time steps (corresponding to layer indices), where intermediate features evolve across layers, we argue that effective KD requires aligning the entire feature dynamics between teacher and student models, which we call feature dynamics distillation (FDD). This alignment involves matching both the feature trajectory and its first-order derivative, rather than just the final states. Our approach extends the original KD objective with two additional loss terms: layer-wise feature KD, which matches discretized feature trajectory,... | Guoqiang Gong, Jiaxing Wang, Jin Xu, Deping Xiang, Zicheng Zhang, Leqi Shen, Yifeng Zhang, JunhuaShu JunhuaShu, ZhaolongXing ZhaolongXing, Zhen Chen, Pengzhang Liu, Ke Zhang |  |

Sparse attention offers a promising direction for improving efficiency while maintaining model capabilities. We present NSA, a Natively trained Sparse Attention mechanism that integrates algorithmic innovations with hardware-aligned optimizations to achieve efficient long-context modeling. NSA employs a dynamic hierarchical sparse strategy, combining coarse-grained token compression with fine-grained token selection to preserve both global context awareness and local precision. Our approach advances sparse attention design with two key innovations: (1) We achieve substantial speedups through arithmetic intensity-balanced algorithm design, with implementation optimizations for modern hardware. (2) We enable end-to-end training, reducing pretraining computation without sacrificing model performance. As shown in... | Jingyang Yuan, Huazuo Gao, Damai Dai, Junyu Luo, Liang Zhao, Zhengyan Zhang, Zhenda Xie, Yuxing Wei, Lean Wang, Zhiping Xiao, Yuqing Wang, Chong Ruan, Ming Zhang, Wenfeng Liang, Wangding Zeng |  |

We propose a new RL framework with ReflexNet for low-level task execution, SchemaPlanner for symbolic reasoning, and HyperOptima for long-term context modeling, ensuring continuous adaptation and memory retention. Experimental results show that DRAE significantly outperforms baseline... | Yayu Long, Kewei Chen, Long Jin, Mingsheng Shang |  |

Although effective, existing studies remain confined to scenarios where a single gold table is given alongside the user query, failing to address cases where users seek comprehensive insights from multiple unknown tables. To bridge these gaps, we propose MT-RAIG Bench, design to evaluate systems on Retrieval-Augmented Insight Generation over Mulitple-Tables. Additionally, to tackle the suboptimality of existing automatic evaluation methods in the table domain, we further introduce a fine-grained evaluation framework MT-RAIG Eval, which achieves better alignment with human quality judgments on the generated insights. We conduct extensive experiments and reveal that even frontier LLMs still struggle with complex multi-table reasoning, establishing our MT-RAIG Bench as a... | Kwangwook Seo, Donguk Kwon, Dongha Lee |  |

In this work, we investigate applying ReFT to complex reasoning tasks. However, directly using the native ReFT method, which modifies fixed representations at the beginning and end of each layer, yields suboptimal performance, as these fixed-position representations have uncertain impact on the outputs. We observe that, in complex reasoning tasks, there often exist certain critical representations. These representations either integrate significant information from preceding layers or regulate subsequent layer representations. Through layer-by-layer propagation, they exert a substantial influence on the final output. Naturally, fine-tuning these critical representations has the potential to greatly enhance reasoning performance. Building upon these insights, we... | Chenxi Huang, Shaotian Yan, Liang Xie, Binbin Lin, Sinan Fan, Yue Xin, Deng Cai, Chen Shen, Jieping Ye |  |

Furthermore, demographic attributes such as race, gender, and age group have been repeatedly reported to cause significant differences in emotional expression and recognition. This study is the first to systematically verify whether these psychological findings observed in humans also apply to the latest Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs). We constructed low-stress versus high-stress environments and generated an image dataset (a total of 540 images) that combines race, gender, and age group. Based on this, we applied the Pretend prompt technique to induce LVLMs to interpret others’ emotions from the standpoint of the assigned environment and persona. An analysis of the models’ emotional understanding ability, using EQ-Bench-based metrics, revealed that (1) under high-stress... | Jaewook Lee, Yeajin Jang, OhWoog Kwon, Harksoo Kim |  |

Variational autoencoder-based neural topic models (VAE-NTMs) commonly adopt the von Mises-Fisher prior to encode hyperspherical structure. However, VAE-NTMs often suffer from posterior collapse, where the KL divergence term in the objective function highly diminishes, leading to ineffective latent representations. To mitigate this issue while modeling hyperspherical structure in the latent space, we propose the Spherical Sliced Wasserstein Autoencoder for Topic Modeling (S2WTM). S2WTM employs a prior distribution supported on the unit hypersphere and leverages the Spherical Sliced-Wasserstein distance to align the aggregated posterior distribution with the prior. Experimental results demonstrate that S2WTM outperforms state-of-the-art topic models, generating more coherent and diverse topics while improving... | Suman Adhya, Debarshi Kumar Sanyal |  |

However, their application in text embedding tasks has been relatively slow, along with the analysis of their semantic representation in probing tasks, due to the constraints of the unidirectional attention mechanism. This paper aims to explore whether such constraints can be overcome by enabling bidirectional attention in LLMs. We tested different variants of the Llama architecture through additional training steps, progressively enabling bidirectional attention and unsupervised/supervised contrastive learning. Our results show that bidirectional attention improves the LLMs’ ability to represent subsequent context but weakens their utilization of preceding context, while contrastive learning training can help to maintain both abilities. | Zhaoxin Feng, Jianfei Ma, Emmanuele Chersoni, Xiaojing Zhao, Xiaoyi Bao |  |

However, deciphering the internal reasoning processes of LLMs remains challenging due to the complex interdependencies among generated tokens, especially in practical question-answering. In this study, we introduce a two-dimensional analysis framework—comprising token back-tracing and individual token decoding—to uncover how LLMs conduct factual knowledge recall. Through explanatory analysis of three typical reasoning datasets, we identify a consistent three-phase pattern: Subject Augmentation and Broadcasting, Object Retrieval and Reranking, and Conclusion Fusion and Generation. Our findings reveal that LLMs do not lack relevant knowledge but struggle to select the most accurate information based on context during the retrieval and rerank phase. Leveraging these findings, we apply representation engineering and... | Yiqun Wang, Chaoqun Wan, Sile Hu, Yonggang Zhang, Xiang Tian, Yaowu Chen, Xu Shen, Jieping Ye |  |

In contrast to the within-document tasks, in which event and entity mentions are linked by rich and coherent contexts, cross-document mentions lack such critical contexts, which presents a significant challenge in establishing connections among them. To address this issue, we introduce a novel task Cross-Document Discourse Coherence Enhancement (CD-DCE) to enhance the discourse coherence between two cross-document event or entity mentions. Specifically, CD-DCE first selects coherent texts and then adds them between two cross-document mentions to form a new coherent document. Subsequently, the coherent text is employed to represent the event or entity mentions and to resolve any coreferent mentions. Experimental results on the three popular datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art... | Xinyu Chen, Peifeng Li, Qiaoming Zhu |  |

As dataset sizes grow, efficiently selecting optimal subsets for training becomes crucial to balancing performance and computational costs. Traditional data selection methods often require fine-tuning a scoring model on the target dataset, which is time-consuming and resource-intensive, or rely on heuristics that fail to fully leverage the model’s predictive capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose Data Whisperer, an efficient, training-free, attention-based method that leverages few-shot in-context learning with the model to be fine-tuned. Comprehensive evaluations were conducted on both raw and synthetic datasets across diverse tasks and models. Notably, Data Whisperer achieves superior performance compared to the full GSM8K dataset on the Llama-3-8B-Instruct model, using just 10% of the data, and outperforms existing methods with a 3.1-point improvement and a... | Shaobo Wang, Xiangqi Jin, Ziming Wang, Jize Wang, Jiajun Zhang, Kaixin Li, Zichen Wen, Zhong Li, Conghui He, Xuming Hu, Linfeng Zhang |  |

However, its effectiveness depends on high-quality instruction data, which is challenging to obtain in the real world due to privacy concerns, data scarcity, and high annotation costs. To fill this gap, inspired by the recent success of using LLMs to simulate human society, we propose MATRIX, a multi-agent simulator that automatically generates diverse text-based scenarios, capturing a wide range of real-world human needs in a realistic and scalable manner. Leveraging these outputs, we introduce a novel scenario-driven instruction generator MATRIX-Gen for controllable and highly realistic data synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework effectively generates both general and domain-specific data. On AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard benchmarks, Llama-3-8B-Base, post-trained on datasets synthesized by MATRIX-Gen with just 20K instruction-response pairs, outperforms Meta’s... | Shuo Tang, Xianghe Pang, Zexi Liu, Bohan Tang, Rui Ye, Tian Jin, Xiaowen Dong, Yanfeng Wang, Siheng Chen |  |

However, most existing approaches focus on hard token decoding, which constrains reasoning within the discrete vocabulary space and may not always be optimal. While recent efforts explore continuous-space reasoning, they often require full-model fine-tuning and suffer from catastrophic forgetting, limiting their applicability to state-of-the-art LLMs that already perform well in zero-shot settings with a proper instruction. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach for continuous-space reasoning that does not require modifying the LLM. Specifically, we employ a lightweight fixed assistant model to speculatively generate instance-specific soft thought tokens as the initial chain of thoughts, which are then mapped into the LLM’s representation space via a trainable projection module.

While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in such tasks, their ability to perform multi-hop reasoning across diverse sources remains insufficiently evaluated. Existing benchmarks, such as MMQA, face challenges due to (1) data contamination and (2) a lack of complex queries that necessitate operations across more than two modalities, hindering accurate performance assessment. To address this, we present Financial Cross-Modal Multi-Hop Reasoning (FCMR), a benchmark created to analyze the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs by urging them to combine information from textual reports, tables, and charts within the financial domain. FCMR is categorized into three difficulty levels—Easy, Medium, and Hard—facilitating a step-by-step evaluation. In particular, problems at the Hard level require precise cross-modal three-hop reasoning and are designed to... | Seunghee Kim, Changhyeon Kim, Taeuk Kim |  |

Although prompt engineering and steering are commonly used to intervene in model behaviors, the vast number of parameters in models often results in highly intertwined internal representations. This interdependency can limit control precision and sometimes lead to unintended side effects. Recent research has explored the use of sparse autoencoders (SAE) to disentangle knowledge in high-dimensional spaces for steering.However, these applications have been limited to toy tasks owing to the nontrivial issue of locating “atomic knowledge components”. In this paper, we propose Steering Target Atoms (STA), a novel method that isolates and manipulates disentangled knowledge components to enhance safety. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Further analysis reveals that steering exhibits superior robustness and flexibility, particularly in adversarial... | Mengru Wang, Ziwen Xu, Shengyu Mao, Shumin Deng, Zhaopeng Tu, Huajun Chen, Ningyu Zhang |  |

In this paper, we introduce MobiLoRA to accelerate LoRA-based LLM inference on mobile devices. MobiLoRA focuses on optimizing the key-value (KV) caches due to the limited computing and memory resources of mobile devices. The key insight of MobiLoRA lies in the utilization of two contexts for on-device LoRA serving: semantic-level contexts, such as prompts with shared prefixes, and system-level contexts, such as the application status (e.g., foreground or killed) of LLM requests. Specifically, for semantic-level contexts, MobiLoRA proposes similarity-aware delta encoding, which leverages token-wise similarity in KV caches across LoRA adapters for efficient storage and reuse. Furthermore, MobiLoRA advocates context-aware KV cache management to optimize cache retention and eviction... | Borui Li, Yitao Wang, Haoran Ma, Ligeng Chen, Jun Xiao, Shuai Wang |  |

Recent works have concentrated on aligning LLMs to mitigate harmful outputs. Despite these efforts, some anomalies indicate that even a well-conducted alignment process can be easily circumvented, whether intentionally or accidentally. Does alignment fine-tuning yield have robust effects on models, or are its impacts merely superficial? In this work, we make the first exploration of this phenomenon from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Empirically, we demonstrate the elasticity of post-alignment models, i.e., the tendency to revert to the behavior distribution formed during the pre-training phase upon further fine-tuning. Leveraging compression theory, we formally deduce that fine-tuning disproportionately undermines alignment relative to pre-training, potentially by orders of magnitude. We validate the presence of elasticity through experiments on models of varying types and scales.... | Jiaming Ji, Kaile Wang, Tianyi Alex Qiu, Boyuan Chen, Jiayi Zhou, Changye Li, Hantao Lou, Josef Dai, Yunhuai Liu, Yaodong Yang |  |

Despite the success of MHQA systems, the evaluation of MHQA is not deeply investigated. Existing evaluations mainly focus on comparing the final answers of the reasoning method and given ground-truths. We argue that the reasoning process should also be evaluated because wrong reasoning process can also lead to the correct final answers. Motivated by this, we propose a “Planner-Executor-Reasoner” (PER) architecture, which forms the core of the Plan-anchored Data Preprocessing (PER-DP) and the Plan-guided Multi-Hop QA (PER-QA).The former provides the ground-truth of intermediate reasoning steps and final answers, and the latter offers them of a reasoning method. Moreover, we design a fine-grained evaluation metric called Plan-aligned Stepwise Evaluation (PSE), which evaluates the intermediate reasoning steps from two aspects: planning and... | Qichuan Liu, Chentao Zhang, Chenfeng Zheng, Guosheng Hu, Xiaodong Li, Zhihong Zhang |  |

We rely on theoretical and empirical connections to Transformer-based architectures and their attention mechanisms. Exploiting this relationship, we adapt attentional interpretability techniques originally developed for Transformers—specifically, the Attention Knockout methodology—to both Mamba-1 and Mamba-2. Using them we trace how information is transmitted and localized across tokens and layers, revealing patterns of subject-token information emergence and layer-wise dynamics. Notably, some phenomena vary between mamba models and Transformer based models, while others appear universally across all models inspected—hinting that these may be inherent to LLMs in general. By further leveraging Mamba’s structured factorization, we disentangle how distinct “features” either enable token-to-token information exchange or enrich individual tokens, thus offering a unified lens to... | Nir Endy, Idan Daniel Grosbard, Yuval RanMilo, Yonatan Slutzky, Itay Tshuva, Raja Giryes |  |

Most previous research has focused primarily on observing how jailbreak attack techniques bypass safety mechanisms like Reinforcement Learning through Human Feedback (RLHF). However, whether there are neurons within LLMs that directly govern aggression has not been sufficiently investigated. To fill this gap, this study identifies specific neurons (“aggression neurons”) closely related to the expression of aggression and systematically analyzes how manipulating them affects the model’s overall aggression.

Distillation post-training on LRMs-generated data is a straightforward yet effective method to enhance the reasoning abilities of smaller models, but faces a critical bottleneck: we found that distilled long CoT data poses learning difficulty for small models and leads to the inheritance of biases (i.e., formalistic long-time thinking) when using Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods. To alleviate this bottleneck, we propose constructing data from scratch using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). We then exploit a set of CoT-aware approaches, including Thoughts Length Balance, Fine-grained DPO, and Joint Post-training Objective, to enhance SFT and RL on the MCTS data. We conducted evaluation on various benchmarks such as math (GSM8K, MATH, AIME). instruction-following (Multi-IF)... | Huifeng Yin, Yu Zhao, Minghao Wu, Xuanfan Ni, Bo Zeng, Hao Wang, Tianqi Shi, Liangying Shao, Chenyang Lyu, Longyue Wang, Weihua Luo, Kaifu Zhang |  |

This trade-off between diversity and alignment quality remains a significant challenge. Drawing inspiration from curiosity-driven exploration in reinforcement learning, we introduce curiosity-driven RLHF (CD-RLHF), a framework that incorporates intrinsic rewards for novel states, alongside traditional sparse extrinsic rewards, to optimize both output diversity and alignment quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CD-RLHF through extensive experiments on a range of tasks, including text summarization and instruction following. Our approach achieves significant gains in diversity on multiple diversity-oriented metrics while maintaining alignment with human preferences comparable to standard RLHF. We will make our code publicly available. | Haoran Sun, Yekun Chai, Shuohuan Wang, Yu Sun, Hua Wu, Haifeng Wang |  |

However, current state-of-the-art T2A models still struggle to satisfy human preferences for prompt-following and acoustic quality when generating complex multi-event audio. To improve the performance of the model in these high-level applications, we propose to enhance the basic capabilities of the model with AI feedback learning. First, we introduce fine-grained AI audio scoring pipelines to: 1) verify whether each event in the text prompt is present in the audio (Event Occurrence Score), 2) detect deviations in event sequences from the language description (Event Sequence Score), and 3) assess the overall acoustic and harmonic quality of the generated audio (Acoustic&Harmonic Quality). We evaluate these three automatic scoring pipelines and find that they correlate significantly better with human preferences than other evaluation metrics.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise, their performance is often limited by challenges in interpreting complex conversational streams. We introduce a Clue of Emotion (CoE) framework, which progressively integrates key conversational clues to enhance the ERC task. Building on CoE, we implement a multi-stage auxiliary learning strategy that incorporates role-playing, speaker identification, and emotion reasoning tasks, each targeting different aspects of conversational emotion understanding and enhancing the model’s ability to interpret emotional contexts. Our experiments on EmoryNLP, MELD, and IEMOCAP demonstrate that CoE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 2.92% improvement on EmoryNLP. These results underscore the effectiveness of clues and multi-stage auxiliary learning for ERC, offering valuable insights for future research. | Zhiyu Shen, Yunhe Pang, Yanghui Rao, Jianxing Yu |  |

Existing preference learning methods for safety alignment, such as RLHF and DPO, are primarily monolingual and struggle with noisy multilingual data. To address these limitations, we introduce Multilingual reward gaP Optimization (MPO), a novel approach that leverages the well-aligned safety capabilities of the dominant language (e.g., English) to improve safety alignment across multiple languages. MPO directly minimizes the reward gap difference between the dominant language and target languages, effectively transferring safety capabilities while preserving the original strengths of the dominant language. Extensive experiments on three LLMs, LLaMA-3.1, Gemma-2 and Qwen2.5, validate MPO’s efficacy in multilingual safety alignment without degrading general multilingual utility. | Weixiang Zhao, Yulin Hu, Yang Deng, Tongtong Wu, Wenxuan Zhang, Jiahe Guo, An Zhang, Yanyan Zhao, Bing Qin, TatSeng Chua, Ting Liu |  |

Natural language feedback provides instructive recommendations and detailed evaluations, yet existing datasets lack the comprehensive annotations needed for this approach. To bridge this gap, we introduce QualiSpeech, a comprehensive low-level speech quality assessment dataset encompassing 11 key aspects and detailed natural language comments that include reasoning and contextual insights. Additionally, we propose the QualiSpeech Benchmark to evaluate the low-level speech understanding capabilities of auditory large language models (LLMs). Experimental results demonstrate that finetuned auditory LLMs can reliably generate detailed descriptions of noise and distortion, effectively identifying their types and temporal characteristics. The results further highlight the potential for... | Siyin Wang, Wenyi Yu, Xianzhao Chen, Xiaohai Tian, Jun Zhang, Lu Lu, Yu Tsao, Junichi Yamagishi, Yuxuan Wang, Chao Zhang |  |

However, fine-tuning can reduce the expressiveness of the embeddings of language models. This study investigates the relation between fine-tuning, topology of the embedding space, and task performance in the context of sense knowledge enhancement, focusing on identifying the topological properties that contribute to the success of sense-enhanced embeddings. We experiment with two fine-tuning methods: \*Supervised Contrastive Learning (SCL)\* and \*Supervised Predictive Learning (SPL)\*. Our results show that SPL, the most standard approach, exhibits varying effectiveness depending on the language model and is inconsistent in producing successful sense-enhanced embeddings. In contrast, SCL achieves this consistently. Furthermore, while the embeddings with only... | Deniz Ekin Yavas, Timothée Bernard, Benoît Crabbé, Laura Kallmeyer |  |

Consider searching a restaurant menu for a specific nutritional detail or identifying a disclaimer in a lengthy newspaper article — tasks that demand careful attention to small but significant details within a broader narrative, akin to Finding Needles in Images (NiM). To address this gap, we introduce NiM-Benchmark, a carefully curated benchmark spanning diverse real-world documents including newspapers, menus, and lecture images, specifically designed to evaluate MLLMs’ capability in these intricate tasks. Building on this, we further propose Spot-IT, a simple yet effective approach that enhances MLLMs capability through intelligent patch selection and Gaussian attention, motivated from how humans zoom and focus when searching documents.

However, the process of continual instruction tuning (CIT) for LLMs may bring about the catastrophic forgetting (CF) problem, where previously learned abilities are degraded. Recent methods try to alleviate the CF problem by modifying models or replaying data, which may only remember the surface-level pattern of instructions and get confused on held-out tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel continual instruction tuning method based on Key-part Information Gain (KPIG). Our method computes the information gain on masked parts to dynamically replay data and refine the training objective, which enables LLMs to capture task-aware information relevant to the correct response and alleviate overfitting to general descriptions in instructions. In addition, we propose two metrics, P-score and V-score, to measure the generalization and... | Yongquan He, Wenyuan Zhang, Xuancheng Huang, Peng Zhang, Lingxun Meng, Xiang Zhou, Ke Zeng, Xunliang Cai |  |

However, prior studies on distractor generation have not paid sufficient attention to enhancing the difficulty of distractors, resulting in reduced effectiveness of MCQs. This study presents a pipeline for training a model to generate distractors that are more likely to be selected by students. First, we train a pairwise ranker to reason about students’ misconceptions and assess the relative plausibility of two distractors. Using this model, we create a dataset of pairwise distractor ranks and then train a distractor generator via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to generate more plausible distractors. Experiments on computer science subjects (Python, DB, MLDL) demonstrate that our pairwise ranker effectively identifies students’ potential misunderstandings and achieves... | Yooseop Lee, Suin Kim, Yohan Jo |  |

However, it often struggles to generalize beyond the distribution of the provided demonstrations. A recent advancement in enhancing robustness is ICL with explanations (X-ICL), which improves prediction reliability by guiding LLMs to understand and articulate the reasoning behind correct labels. Building on this approach, we introduce an advanced framework that extends X-ICL by systematically exploring explanations for all possible labels (X2-ICL), thereby enabling more comprehensive and robust decision-making. Experimental results on multiple natural language understanding datasets validate the effectiveness of X2-ICL, demonstrating significantly improved robustness to out-of-distribution data compared to the existing ICL approaches. | Ukyo Honda, Tatsushi Oka |  |

As autoregressive large language models (LLMs) operate on high-dimensional representations, we ask whether they are also affected by hubness. We first prove that the only large-scale representation comparison operation performed by LLMs, namely that between context and unembedding vectors to determine continuation probabilities, is not characterized by the concentration of distances phenomenon that typically causes the appearance of nuisance hubness. We then empirically show that this comparison still leads to a high degree of hubness, but the hubs in this case do not constitute a disturbance. They are rather the result of context-modulated frequent tokens often appearing in the pool of likely candidates for next token prediction.... | Beatrix Miranda Ginn Nielsen, Iuri Macocco, Marco Baroni |  |

However, a gap still remains between validation loss and the model’s downstream capabilities, making it untrivial to apply scaling law to direct performance prediction for downstream tasks. The loss typically represents a cumulative penalty for predicted tokens, which are implicitly considered to have equal importance. Nevertheless, our studies have shown evidence that when considering different training data distributions, we cannot directly model the relationship between downstream capability and computation or token loss. To bridge the gap between validation loss and downstream task capabilities, in this work, we introduce Capability Salience Vector, which decomposes the overall loss and assigns different importance weights to tokens to assess a specific meta-capability, aligning the... | Qiming Ge, Shuhao Xing, Songyang Gao, Yunhua Zhou, Yicheng Zou, Songyang Zhang, Zhi Chen, Hang Yan, Qi Zhang, Qipeng Guo, Kai Chen |  |

However, there is an unignorable programming language bias in existing code benchmarks – over 95% code generation benchmarks are dominated by Python, leaving the LLMs’ capabilities in other programming languages such as Java and C/C++ unknown. Moreover, coding task bias is also crucial. Most benchmarks focus on code generation capability, while benchmarks for code reasoning (given input, reasoning output; and given output, reasoning input), an essential coding capability, are insufficient. Yet, constructing multi-lingual benchmarks can be expensive and labor-intensive, and codes in contest websites such as Leetcode suffer from data contamination during training. To fill this gap, we propose CRUXEVAL-X, a multi-lingual code reasoning benchmark that contains 19 programming languages. It comprises at least 600 subjects for each language, along with 19K content-consistent... | Ruiyang Xu, Jialun Cao, Yaojie Lu, Ming Wen, Hongyu Lin, Xianpei Han, Ben He, ShingChi Cheung, Le Sun |  |

Compared with long-context LLMs, RAG is considered an effective summarization tool in a more concise and lightweight manner, which can interact with LLMs multiple times using diverse queries to get comprehensive responses. However, the LLM-generated historical responses, which contain potentially insightful information, are largely neglected and discarded by existing approaches, leading to suboptimal results. In this paper, we propose graph of records (GoR), which leverages historical responses generated by LLMs to enhance RAG for long-context global summarization. Inspired by the retrieve-then-generate paradigm of RAG, we construct a graph by establishing an edge between the retrieved text chunks and the corresponding LLM-generated response. To further uncover the intricate correlations between them, GoR features a graph neural network and an elaborately... | Haozhen Zhang, Tao Feng, Jiaxuan You |  |

However, despite their widespread adoption, LLM explanations have been found to be unreliable, making it difficult for users to distinguish good from bad explanations. To address this issue, we present Rubrik’s CUBE–an education-inspired rubric and a dataset of 26k explanations, written and later quality-annotated using the rubric by both humans and six open- and closed-source LLMs. The CUBE dataset focuses on two reasoning and two language tasks, providing the necessary diversity for us to effectively test our proposed rubric. Using Rubrik, we find that explanations are influenced by both task and perceived difficulty. Low quality stems primarily from a lack of conciseness in LLM-generated explanations, rather than cohesion and word choice. The full dataset, rubric, and code are available at https://github.com/RubriksCube/rubriks_cube. | Diana GalvánSosa, Gabrielle Gaudeau, Pride Kavumba, Yunmeng Li, Hongyi Gu, Zheng Yuan, Keisuke Sakaguchi, Paula Buttery |  |

Strategy planning and expressive optimization are crucial aspects of effective negotiations. However, previous studies have typically focused on only one of these aspects, neglecting the fact that their combined synergistic effect can lead to better performance. Inspired by the dual-process theory in human cognition, we propose a Dual-Mind Negotiation Agent (DMNA) framework. This framework integrates an intuitive module for rapid, experience-based response and a deliberative module for slow, expression optimization. The intuitive module is trained using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), enabling it to make suitable strategic planning and expression. The deliberative module employs a multifaceted reflexion mechanism to enhance the quality of expression. Experiments conducted on negotiation datasets confirm that DMNA achieves state-of-the-art results,... | Yutong Liu, Lida Shi, Rui Song, Hao Xu |  |

Among these, long-context referencing—a crucial task that requires LCLMs to attribute items of interest to specific parts of long-context data—remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes Referencing Evaluation for Long-context Language Models (Ref-Long), a novel benchmark designed to assess the long-context referencing capability of LCLMs. Specifically, Ref-Long requires LCLMs to identify the indexes of documents that reference a specific key, emphasizing contextual relationships between the key and the documents over simple retrieval. Based on the task design, we construct three subsets ranging from synthetic to realistic scenarios to form the Ref-Long benchmark. Experimental results of 13 LCLMs reveal significant shortcomings in long-context referencing, even among advanced models like GPT-4o. To further investigate these challenges, we conduct... | Junjie Wu, Gefei Gu, Yanan Zheng, DitYan Yeung, Arman Cohan |  |

However, recent studies reveal deviations, particularly in large language models, where performance improvements decelerate—a phenomenon known as sub-scaling. This paper revisits these scaling laws by examining the impact of data quality and training strategies on model performance. Through extensive empirical analysis of over 400 models, we identify high data density and non-optimal resource allocation as key factors contributing to sub-scaling. High data density leads to diminishing returns due to redundant information, while optimal resource allocation is crucial for sustained performance improvements. We propose a sub-optimal scaling law that better predicts performance in sub-scaling regimes, highlighting the importance of data quality and diversity. | Zhengyu Chen, Siqi Wang, Teng Xiao, Yudong Wang, Shiqi Chen, Xunliang Cai, Junxian He, Jingang Wang |  |

In addition to theoretical advances in understanding the constitution of arguments, a significant body of research has emerged around practical argument mining, supported by a growing number of publicly available datasets. On these benchmarks, BERT-like transformers have consistently performed best, reinforcing the belief that such models are broadly applicable across diverse contexts of debate. This study offers the first large-scale re-evaluation of such state-of-the-art models, with a specific focus on their ability to generalize in identifying arguments. We evaluate four transformers, three standard and one enhanced with contrastive pre-training for better generalization, on 17 English sentence-level datasets as most relevant to the task.

During preference data construction, previous approaches primarily rely on humans, strong models like GPT4 or model self-sampling. In this study, we first explain the shortcomings of this practice. Then, we propose Self-Supervised Preference Optimization (SSPO), a novel framework which efficiently constructs translation preference data for iterative DPO training. Applying SSPO to 14B parameters large language models (LLMs) achieves comparable or better performance than GPT-4o on FLORES and multi-domain test datasets.

Traditional text-based approaches rely on tailored parsing techniques that disregard layout information and are prone to errors, while recent parsing-free visual methods often struggle to capture fine-grained textual semantics in text-rich scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose Unveil, a novel visual-textual embedding framework that effectively integrates textual and visual features for robust document representation. Through knowledge distillation, we transfer the semantic understanding capabilities from the visual-textual embedding model to a purely visual model, enabling efficient parsing-free retrieval while preserving semantic fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that our visual-textual embedding method surpasses existing approaches, while knowledge distillation successfully bridges the performance gap between visual-textual and visual-only... | Hao Sun, Yingyan Hou, Jiayan Guo, Bo Wang, Chunyu Yang, Jinsong Ni, Yan Zhang |  |

In this work, we identify two key challenges contributing to this inefficiency: over-exploration due to redundant states with semantically equivalent content, and under-exploration caused by high variance in verifier scoring leading to frequent trajectory switching. To address these issues, we propose FETCH – an e ffici ent tree sear ch framework, which is a flexible, plug-and-play system compatible with various tree search algorithms.Our framework mitigates over-exploration by merging semantically similar states using agglomerative clustering of text embeddings obtained from a fine-tuned SimCSE model.

Current pre-trained CLSE approaches use sentence-level objectives only. This can lead to loss of information, especially for tokens, which then degrades the sentence representation. We propose MEXMA, a novel approach that integrates both sentence-level and token-level objectives. The sentence representation in one language is used to predict masked tokens in another language, with both the sentence representation and \*all tokens directly update the encoder\*. We show that adding token-level objectives greatly improves the sentence representation quality across several tasks. Our approach outperforms current pre-trained cross-lingual sentence encoders on bitext mining as well as several downstream tasks. We also analyse the information encoded in our tokens, and how the sentence representation is built from them. | João Maria Janeiro, Benjamin Piwowarski, Patrick Gallinari, Loïc Barrault |  |

However, constructing high-quality preference datasets remains challenging, often necessitating expensive manual or powerful LM annotations. Additionally, standard DPO exhibits suboptimal performance in complex reasoning tasks, such as mathematical and code reasoning. In this paper, we introduce an approach to collect preference pairs through iterative sampling and execution feedback, tailored to the current learning state (e.g. well-learned, mis-learned, and unlearned) of the policy model. To alleviate the failures of DPO and improve its applicability in reasoning tasks, we propose , an iterative uncertainty-aware preference optimization method that achieves fine-grained preference control by assessing model confidence.

However, they still face substantial challenges of low communication efficiency and suboptimal task performance, making the careful design of the agents’ communication topologies particularly important. Inspired by the management theory that roles in an efficient team are often dynamically adjusted, we propose AgentDropout, which identifies redundant agents and communication across different communication rounds by optimizing the adjacency matrices of the communication graphs and eliminates them to enhance both token efficiency and task performance. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, AgentDropout achieves an average reduction of 21.6% in prompt token consumption and 18.4% in completion token consumption, along with a performance improvement of 1.14 on the tasks. Furthermore, the extended experiments demonstrate that AgentDropout achieves notable... | Zhexuan Wang, Yutong Wang, Xuebo Liu, Liang Ding, Miao Zhang, Jie Liu, Min Zhang |  |

While existing benchmarks assess basic ToM abilities, they predominantly focus on static snapshots of mental states, overlooking the temporal evolution that characterizes real-world social interactions. We present \*\*DynToM\*\*, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs’ ability to understand and track the temporal progression of mental states across interconnected scenarios. Through a systematic four-step framework, we generate 1,100 social contexts encompassing 5,500 scenarios and 78,100 questions, each validated for realism and quality.

However, existing datasets, such as IFEval, are either predominantly monolingual and centered on English or simply machine translated to other languages, limiting their applicability in multilingual contexts. In this paper, we present an carefully-curated extension of IFEval to a localized multilingual version named Marco-Bench-MIF, covering 30 languages with varying levels of localization. Our benchmark addresses linguistic constraints (e.g., modifying capitalization requirements for Chinese) and cultural references (e.g., substituting region-specific company names in prompts) via a hybrid pipeline combining translation with verification. Through comprehensive evaluation of 20+ LLMs on our Marco-Bench-MIF, we found that: (1) 25-35% accuracy gap between high/low-resource languages, (2) model scales largely impact performance by 45-60% yet persists script-specific challenges, and (3)... | Bo Zeng, Chenyang Lyu, Sinuo Liu, Mingyan Zeng, Minghao Wu, Xuanfan Ni, Tianqi Shi, Yu Zhao, Yefeng Liu, Chenyu Zhu, Ruizhe Li, Jiahui Geng, Qing Li, Yu Tong, Longyue Wang, Weihua Luo, Kaifu Zhang |  |

These risks can be amplified by the recent adversarial attacks, fine-tuning vulnerabilities, and the increasing deployment of LLMs in high-stakes environments. Existing safety-enhancing techniques, such as fine-tuning with human feedback or adversarial training, are still vulnerable as they address specific threats and often fail to generalize across unseen attacks, or require manual system-level defenses. This paper introduces RepBend, a novel approach that fundamentally disrupts the representations underlying harmful behaviors in LLMs, offering a scalable solution to enhance (potentially inherent) safety. RepBend brings the idea of activation steering – simple vector arithmetic for steering model’s behavior during inference – to loss-based fine-tuning.

In this work, we present the first study to analyze how LLMs recognize knowledge boundaries across different languages by probing their internal representations when processing known and unknown questions in multiple languages. Our empirical studies reveal three key findings: 1) LLMs’ perceptions of knowledge boundaries are encoded in the middle to middle-upper layers across different languages. 2) Language differences in knowledge boundary perception follow a linear structure, which motivates our proposal of a training-free alignment method that effectively transfers knowledge boundary perception ability across languages, thereby helping reduce hallucination risk in low-resource languages; 3) Fine-tuning on bilingual question pair translation further enhances LLMs’ recognition of knowledge boundaries across... | Chenghao Xiao, Hou Pong Chan, Hao Zhang, Mahani Aljunied, Lidong Bing, Noura Al Moubayed, Yu Rong |  |

However, in real-world applications, retrievers often return lengthy documents with redundant or irrelevant content, confusing downstream readers. While evidence retrieval aims to address this by extracting key information, it faces critical challenges: (1) inability to model synergistic inter-dependencies among evidence sentences, (2) lack of supervision for evaluating multi-sentence evidence quality, and (3) computational inefficiency in navigating exponentially growing search spaces of candidate evidence sets. To tackle these challenges, we propose ETS (Evidence Tree Search), a novel framework that reformulates evidence retrieval as a dynamic tree expansion process. Our approach first constructs an evidence tree where each path represents a candidate evidence set, explicitly modeling inter-sentence dependencies through context-aware node... | Hao Sun, Hengyi Cai, Yuchen Li, Xuanbo Fan, Xiaochi Wei, Shuaiqiang Wang, Yan Zhang, Dawei Yin |  |

Addressing hallucinations is important for the advancement of LLMs. This paper introduces a comprehensive hallucination benchmark HalluLens, incorporating both extrinsic and intrinsic evaluation tasks, built upon a clear taxonomy of hallucination. A major challenge in benchmarking hallucinations is the lack of a unified framework due to inconsistent definitions and categorizations. We disentangle LLM hallucination from “factuality” and propose a taxonomy distinguishing extrinsic and intrinsic hallucinations to promote consistency and facilitate research. We emphasize extrinsic hallucinations – where generated content deviates from training data – as they become increasingly relevant with LLM advancements. However, no benchmark is solely dedicated to... | Yejin Bang, Ziwei Ji, Alan Schelten, Anthony Hartshorn, Tara Fowler, Cheng Zhang, Nicola Cancedda, Pascale Fung |  |

In dynamic real-world scenarios, effective persona modeling necessitates leveraging streaming behavior data to continually optimize user personas.However, existing methods—whether regenerating personas or incrementally extending them with new behaviors—often fail to achieve sustained improvements in persona quality or future behavior prediction accuracy. To address this, we propose DEEPER, a novel approach for dynamic persona modeling that enables continual persona optimization. Specifically, we enhance the model’s direction-search capability through an iterative reinforcement learning framework, allowing it to automatically identify effective update directions and optimize personas using discrepancies between user behaviors and model predictions.Extensive experiments on dynamic persona... | Aili Chen, Chengyu Du, Jiangjie Chen, Jinghan Xu, Yikai Zhang, Siyu Yuan, Zulong Chen, Liangyue Li, Yanghua Xiao |  |

However, these models are often evaluated on benchmarks that are unsuitable for the Med-MLLMs due to the intricate nature of the real-world diagnostic frameworks, which encompass diverse medical specialties and involve complex clinical decisions. Thus, a clinically representative benchmark is highly desirable for credible Med-MLLMs evaluation. To this end, we introduce Asclepius, a novel Med-MLLM benchmark that comprehensively assesses Med-MLLMs in terms of: distinct medical specialties (cardiovascular, gastroenterology, etc.) and different diagnostic capacities (perception, disease analysis, etc.). Grounded in 3 proposed core principles, Asclepius ensures a comprehensive evaluation by encompassing 15 medical specialties, stratifying into 3 main categories and 8 sub-categories of clinical tasks, and exempting... | Jie Liu, Wenxuan Wang, Yihang Su, Jingyuan Huang, Yudi Zhang, ChengYi Li, Wenting Chen, Xiaohan Xing, KaoJung Chang, Linlin Shen, Michael R.

However, many of these models perceive objects as indivisible, overlooking the components that constitute them. Understanding these components and their associated affordances provides valuable insights into an object’s functionality, which is fundamental for performing a wide range of tasks. In this work, we introduce a novel real-world benchmark, InstructPart, comprising hand-labeled part segmentation annotations and task-oriented instructions to evaluate the performance of current models in understanding and executing part-level tasks within everyday contexts. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that task-oriented part segmentation remains a challenging problem, even for state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In addition to our benchmark, we introduce a simple... | Zifu Wan, Yaqi Xie, Ce Zhang, Zhiqiu Lin, Zihan Wang, Simon Stepputtis, Deva Ramanan, Katia P. Sycara |  |

Recent work has observed that usual augmentations that make popular deterministic subword tokenisers stochastic still cause only a handful of all possible segmentations to be sampled. It has been proposed to uniformly sample across these instead, through rejection sampling of paths in an unweighted segmentation graph. In this paper, we argue that uniformly random segmentation in turn skews the distributions of certain segmentational properties (e.g. token lengths and amount of tokens produced) away from uniformity, which still ends up hiding meaningfully diverse tokenisations. We propose an alternative uniform sampler using the same segmentation graph, but weighted by counting the paths through it. Our sampling algorithm, GRaMPa, provides hyperparameters... | Thomas Bauwens, David Kaczér, Miryam de Lhoneux |  |

Numerous evaluation metrics based on form- and content-level overlap have been proposed in prior work for evaluating the diversity of a commonsense generation model. However, it remains unclear as to which metrics are best suited for evaluating the diversity in commonsense generation. To address this gap, we conduct a systematic meta-evaluation of diversity metrics for commonsense generation. We find that form-based diversity metrics tend to consistently overestimate the diversity in sentence sets, where even randomly generated sentences are assigned overly high diversity scores. We then use an Large Language Model (LLM) to create a novel dataset annotated for the diversity of sentences generated for a commonsense generation task, and use it to conduct a meta-evaluation of the existing diversity evaluation... | Tianhui Zhang, Bei Peng, Danushka Bollegala |  |

Considering this, extensive efforts have been made to develop fake news detectors. However, a major drawback of these models is their relatively low performance—lagging by more than 20%—in identifying \*fake\* news compared to \*real\* news, making them less suitable for practical deployment. This gap is likely due to an imbalance in the dataset and the model’s inadequate understanding of data distribution on the targeted platform. In this work, we focus on improving the model’s effectiveness in detecting \*fake\* news. To achieve this, we \*\*first\*\* adopt an LLM to \*\*generate\*\* fake news in three different styles, which are later incorporated into the training set to augment the representation of fake news. \*\*Then\*\*, we apply Reinforcement Learning to dynamically \*\*sample\*\* fake news, allowing the model to learn the optimal real-to-fake news ratio for training an effective fake news detector... | Zhao Tong, Yimeng Gu, Huidong Liu, Qiang Liu, Shu Wu, Haichao Shi, XiaoYu Zhang |  |

However, this task remains challenging due to the inherent ambiguity of chemical language and the high cost of human annotation required for developing reliable computer-aided extraction protocols. Here, we present ChemActor, a fully fine-tuned large language model (LLM), as a chemical executor to convert between unstructured experimental procedures and structured action sequences. We propose a sequential LLM-generated data framework to address the challenges of insufficient and low-quality annotated data. This framework integrates a data selection module that selects data based on distribution divergence, with a general-purpose LLM, to generate machine-executable actions from a single molecule input. Additionally, we introduce a novel multi-round LLMs circle review metric, which reflects the model’s advanced understanding... | Yu Zhang, Ruijie Yu, Jidong Tian, Feng Zhu, Jiapeng Liu, Xiaokang Yang, Yaohui Jin, Yanyan Xu |  |

This paper explores leveraging LLMs’ internal states to enhance their perception of knowledge boundaries from efficiency and risk perspectives. We investigate whether LLMs can estimate their confidence using internal states before response generation, potentially saving computational resources. Our experiments on datasets like Natural Questions, HotpotQA, and MMLU reveal that LLMs demonstrate significant pre-generation perception, which is further refined post-generation, with perception gaps remaining stable across varying conditions. To mitigate risks in critical domains, we introduce Consistency-based Confidence Calibration (C3), which assesses confidence consistency through question reformulation. C3 significantly improves LLMs’ ability to recognize their knowledge gaps, enhancing the... | Shiyu Ni, Keping Bi, Jiafeng Guo, Lulu Yu, Baolong Bi, Xueqi Cheng |  |

However, recent studies have proven that such embeddings are vulnerable to inversion attacks, where original text is reconstructed to reveal sensitive information. Previous research has largely assumed access to millions of sentences to train attack models, e.g., through data leakage or nearly unrestricted API access. With our method, a single data point is sufficient for a partially successful inversion attack. With as little as 1k data samples, performance reaches an optimum across a range of black-box encoders, without training on leaked data. We present a Few-shot Textual Embedding Inversion Attack using Cross-Model \*\*AL\*\*ignment and \*\*GEN\*\*eration (__ALGEN__), by aligning victim embeddings to the attack space and using a generative model to reconstruct text. We find that __ALGEN__ attacks can be effectively... | Yiyi Chen, Qiongkai Xu, Johannes Bjerva |  |

Existing research on the utilization of KG for large language models (LLMs) prevalently relies on subgraph retriever or iterative prompting, overlooking the potential synergy of LLMs’ step-wise reasoning capabilities and KGs’ structural nature. In this paper, we present DoG (Decoding on Graph), a novel framework that facilitates a deep synergy between LLMs and KGs. We first define a concept, well-formed chain, which consists of a sequence of interrelated fact triplets on the KGs, starting from question entities and leading to answers. We argue that this concept can serve as a principle for making faithful and sound reasoning for KGQA. To enable LLMs to generate well-formed chains, we propose graph-aware constrained decoding, in which a constraint derived from the topology of the KG regulates the decoding process of the LLMs. This constrained... | Kun Li, Tianhua Zhang, Xixin Wu, Hongyin Luo, James R.

However, applying such techniques to structured tasks, such as text-to-SQL, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Self-Taught Reasoner for text-to-SQL (STaR-SQL), a novel approach that reframes SQL query generation as a reasoning-driven process. Our method prompts the LLM to produce detailed reasoning steps for SQL queries and fine-tunes it on rationales that lead to correct outcomes. Unlike traditional methods, STaR-SQL dedicates additional test-time computation to reasoning, thereby positioning LLMs as spontaneous reasoners rather than mere prompt-based agents. To further scale the inference process, we incorporate an outcome-supervised reward model (ORM) as a verifier, which enhances SQL query accuracy. Experimental results on the challenging Spider benchmark demonstrate that STaR-SQL significantly improves... | Mingqian He, Yongliang Shen, Wenqi Zhang, Qiuying Peng, Jun Wang, Weiming Lu |  |

This study exposes a criticalblind spot: models often make less reliable or overconfident predictions for marginalized groups, even when overall performance appearsfair. Using the FairLex benchmark as a case study in legal NLP, we systematically evaluate both performance and reliability dispari-ties across demographic, regional, and legal attributes spanning four jurisdictions. We show that domain-specific pre-training consistentlyimproves both performance and reliability, especially for underrepresented groups. However, common bias mitigation methods frequentlyworsen reliability disparities, revealing a trade-off not captured by performance metrics alone. Our results call for a rethinking of fairnessin high-stakes NLP: To ensure equitable treatment, models must not only be accurate, but also reliably self-aware across all groups. | T. Y. S. S.

However, the limited availability of domain-specific data significantly hampers their performance on specialized tasks. While existing methods primarily focus on selecting training data from general datasets that are similar to the target domain, they often fail to consider the joint distribution of instructions, resulting in inefficient learning and suboptimal knowledge transfer. To address these challenges, we introduce \*\*G2IS\*\* (\*\*G\*\*radient-based \*\*G\*\*raph \*\*I\*\*nstruction \*\*S\*\*election), a novel method that constructs a mixed gradient-based instruction graph to capture the joint distribution and interdependencies among instructions.

However, most existing methods rely on rejection sampling, which generates trajectories independently and suffers from inefficiency and imbalanced sampling across problems of varying difficulty. In this work, we introduce FastMCTS, an innovative data synthesis strategy inspired by Monte Carlo Tree Search. FastMCTS provides a more efficient sampling method for multi-step reasoning data, offering step-level evaluation signals and promoting balanced sampling across problems of different difficulty levels. Experiments on both English and Chinese reasoning datasets demonstrate that FastMCTS generates over 30% more correct reasoning paths compared to rejection sampling as the number of generated tokens scales up. Furthermore, under comparable synthetic data budgets, models trained on FastMCTS-generated data outperform those trained on rejection sampling data... | Peiji Li, Kai Lv, Yunfan Shao, Yichuan Ma, Linyang Li, Xiaoqing Zheng, Xipeng Qiu, Qipeng Guo |  |

However, ellipses and coreferences, as common phenomena in dialogue scenes, pose challenges to LLMs’ understanding and RAG’s retrieval accuracy. The previous works ignore the negative impact of this fuzzy data on RAG system.We explore the capabilities of LLMs and RAG systems in dialogue scenarios and use Incomplete Utterance Rewriting (IUR) to complete the key information in dialogue to enhance retrieval.Besides, we propose a lightweight IUR model for query rewriting. It is an end-to-end framework for node linking and iterative inference, incorporating two newly proposed probing semantic features derived from generative pre-training. This framework treats IUR as a series of link decisions on the input sequence and the incrementally constructed rewriting outputs.To test the performance of RAG system in the model multi-round dialogue... | Qiwei Li, Teng Xiao, Zuchao Li, Ping Wang, Mengjia Shen, Hai Zhao |  |

We predict that languages that use prosody to make lexical distinctions should exhibit a higher mutual information between word identity and prosody, compared to languages that don’t. We test this hypothesis in the domain of pitch, which is used to make lexical distinctions in tonal languages, like Cantonese. We use a dataset of speakers reading sentences aloud in ten languages across five language families to estimate the mutual information between the text and their pitch curves. We find that, across languages, pitch curves display similar amounts of entropy. However, these curves are easier to predict given their associated text in the tonal languages, compared to pitch- and stress-accent languages, and thus the mutual information is higher in these languages, supporting our hypothesis. Our results support... | Ethan Wilcox, Cui Ding, Giovanni Acampa, Tiago Pimentel, Alex Warstadt, Tamar I. Regev |  |

While large language models (LLMs) match task-specific baselines in English SS, their performance in Portuguese remains underexplored. This paper presents a comprehensive performance comparison of 26 state-of-the-art LLMs in Portuguese SS, alongside two simplification models trained explicitly for this task and language. They are evaluated under a one-shot setting across scientific, news, and government datasets. We benchmark the models with our newly introduced Gov-Lang-BR corpus (1,703 complex-simple sentence pairs from Brazilian government agencies) and two established datasets: PorSimplesSent and Museum-PT. Our investigation takes advantage of both automatic metrics and large-scale linguistic analysis to examine the transformations achieved by the LLMs. Furthermore, a qualitative assessment of selected generated outputs provides deeper insights into simplification quality.... | Arthur Mariano Rocha De Azevedo Scalercio, Elvis A.

However, despite their growing adoption, SSMs lack the interpretability tools that have been crucial for understanding and improving attention-based architectures. While recent efforts provide insights into Mamba’s internal mechanisms, they struggle to capture precisetoken-level interactions at the layer level, leaving gaps in understanding how Mamba selectively processes sequences across layers. In this work, we introduce LaTIM, a novel token-level decomposition method for both Mamba-1 and Mamba-2 that enables fine-grained interpretability. We extensively evaluate our method across diverse tasks, including machine translation, copying, and retrieval-based generation, demonstrating its effectiveness in revealing Mamba’s token-to-token interaction patterns. | Hugo Pitorro, Marcos Vinícius Treviso |  |

Surprisingly, they have not been explored much for character-level tasks, where smaller amounts of data have the potential to be beneficial. We investigate the effectiveness of self-supervised auxiliary tasks for morphological inflection – a character-level task highly relevant for language documentation – in extremely low-resource settings, training encoder-decoder transformers for 19 languages and 13 auxiliary objectives. Autoencoding yields the best performance when unlabeled data is very limited, while character masked language modeling (CMLM) becomes more effective as data availability increases. Though objectives with stronger inductive biases influence model predictions intuitively, they rarely outperform standard CMLM. However, sampling masks based on known morpheme boundaries consistently improves performance,... | Adam Wiemerslage, Katharina von der Wense |  |

Despite recent advancements, existing approaches suffer from significant computational overhead, as they require re-encoding the entire corpus for each new instruction. To address this challenge, we propose GSTransform, a novel instruction-following text embedding framework based on Guided Space Transformation. Our key observation is that instruction-relevant information is inherently encoded in generic embeddings but remains underutilized. Instead of repeatedly encoding the corpus for each instruction, GSTransform is a lightweight transformation mechanism that adapts pre-computed embeddings in real time to align with user instructions, guided by a small amount of text data with instruction-focused label annotation. We conduct extensive experiments on three instruction-awareness... | Yingchaojie Feng, Yiqun Sun, Yandong Sun, Minfeng Zhu, Qiang Huang, Anthony Kum Hoe Tung, Wei Chen |  |

Then, we adopt this pipeline to create the first book-scale coreference benchmark, BOOKCOREF, with an average document length of more than 200,000 tokens.We carry out a series of experiments showing the robustness of our automatic procedure and demonstrating the value of our resource, which enables current long-document coreference systems to gain up to +20 CoNLL-F1 points when evaluated on full books.Moreover, we report on the new challenges introduced by this unprecedented... | Giuliano Martinelli, Tommaso Bonomo, PereLluís Huguet Cabot, Roberto Navigli |  |

The effectiveness of Vision-language RAG systems hinges on multimodal retrieval, which is inherently challenging due to the diverse modalities and knowledge granularities in both queries and knowledge bases. Existing methods have not fully tapped into the potential interplay between these elements. We propose a multimodal RAG system featuring a coarse-to-fine, multi-step retrieval that harmonizes multiple granularities and modalities to enhance efficacy. Our system begins with a broad initial search aligning knowledge granularity for cross-modal retrieval, followed by a multimodal fusion reranking to capture the nuanced multimodal information for top entity selection. A text reranker then filters out the most relevant fine-grained section for augmented... | Wei Yang, Jingjing Fu, Rui Wang, Jinyu Wang, Lei Song, Jiang Bian |  |

One of the main causes lies in the knowledge misalignment between the pre-training stage and the supervised fine-tuning stage. The unfamiliar knowledge encountered during fine-tuning may encourage LLMs to generate facts that are not grounded in parametric knowledge. To address this, we propose Seal, a novel training objective with an abstention mechanism, in which the model learns to selectively reject tokens that misalign with the desired knowledge distribution via a special [REJ] token. This allows the model the option of acknowledging the insufficiency of knowledge rather than blindly assigning high probability to all ground-truth answers. We further propose a regularized decoding objective that penalizes uncertain predictions during inference by using the [REJ] probability learned during training.

If an LLM responds in an unexpected way to an instruction, the user is likely to signal it by rephrasing the request, expressing frustration, or pivoting to an alternative task. Such signals are task-independent and occupy a relatively constrained subspace of language, allowing the LLM to identify them even if it fails on the actual task. We introduce ReSpect, a method to learn from such signals in past interactions via retrospection without additional annotations. We deploy ReSpect in a new multimodal interaction scenario, where humans instruct a multimodal LLM to solve an abstract reasoning task with a combinatorial solution space. Through thousands of interactions with humans, we show how ReSpect gradually improves task completion rate from 31% to 82%, all without any external annotation. | Zizhao Chen, Mustafa Omer Gul, Yiwei Chen, Gloria Geng, Anne Wu, Yoav Artzi |  |

This paper presents the first comprehensive survey on PGen, investigating existing research in this rapidly growing field. We conceptualize PGen from a unified perspective, systematically formalizing its key components, core objectives, and abstract workflows. Based on this unified perspective, we propose a multi-level taxonomy, offering an in-depth review of technical advancements, commonly used datasets, and evaluation metrics across multiple modalities, personalized contexts, and tasks. Moreover, we envision the potential applications of PGen and highlight open challenges and promising directions for future exploration. By bridging PGen research across multiple modalities, this survey serves as a valuable resource for fostering knowledge sharing and interdisciplinary collaboration, ultimately contributing to a more... | Yiyan Xu, Jinghao Zhang, Alireza Salemi, Xinting Hu, Wenjie Wang, Fuli Feng, Hamed Zamani, Xiangnan He, TatSeng Chua |  |

However, existing methods suffer from two inherent limitations: 1) Inefficient Information Aggregation: They rely on a single agent and fixed iterative patterns, making it difficult to adaptively capture multi-level textual, structural, and degree information within graph data. 2) Rigid Reasoning Mechanism: They employ preset reasoning schemes, which cannot dynamically adjust reasoning depth nor achieve precise semantic correction. To overcome these limitations, we propose Graph Counselor, an GraphRAG method based on multi-agent collaboration.

Our proposed SOTOPIA-Ω framework aims to address and bridge this gap, with a particular focus on enhancing the social capabilities of language agents. This framework dynamically injects a variety of social strategies into expert agents, thereby automating the construction of high-quality social dialogue training corpus. Additionally, we introduce the concept of Social Instruction Following (S-IF) and propose two new S-IF evaluation metrics that are complementary to social capability. We demonstrate that several 7B models trained on high-quality corpus not only significantly surpasses the expert agent (GPT-4) in achieving social goals but also enhances S-IF performance. Analysis and variant experiments validate the advantages of dynamic construction, which can especially break the agent’s prolonged deadlock. | Wenyuan Zhang, Tianyun Liu, Mengxiao Song, Xiaodong Li, Tingwen Liu |  |

REPOCOD Says 'Not Yet'](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.1204/) |  | 0 | Recently, a number of repository-level code generation benchmarks–such as CoderEval, DevEval, RepoEval, RepoBench, and LongCode-Arena–have emerged to evaluate the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) beyond standalone benchmarks like HumanEval and MBPP. Thus, a natural question is, would LLMs have similar performance in real world coding tasks as their performance in these benchmarks? Unfortunately, one cannot answer this question, since these benchmarks consist of short completions, synthetic examples, or focus on limited scale repositories, failing to represent real-world coding tasks.To address these challenges, we create RepoCod, a Python code-generation benchmark containing complex tasks with realistic dependencies in real-world large projects and appropriate metrics for evaluating source code. It includes 980 whole-function generation tasks from 11 popular projects, 50.8% of which require repository-level context. RepoCod includes 314 developer-written test cases per... | Shanchao Liang, Nan Jiang, Yiran Hu, Lin Tan |  |

However, this probing method has limited stability, making comparisons between models unreliable. In this paper, we argue that LLMs need more context. We propose a new probing task, Questionnaire Modeling (QM), that uses human survey data as in-context examples. We show that QM improves the stability of question-based bias evaluation, and demonstrate that it may be used to compare instruction-tuned models to their base versions. Experiments with LLMs of various sizes indicate that instruction tuning can indeed change the direction of bias. Furthermore, we observe a trend that larger models are able to leverage in-context examples more effectively, and generally exhibit smaller bias scores in QM. Data and code are publicly available. | Patrick Haller, Jannis Vamvas, Rico Sennrich, Lena Ann Jäger |  |

We introduce the Atticus Clause Retrieval Dataset (ACORD), the first expert-annotated benchmark specifically designed for contract clause retrieval to support contract drafting tasks. ACORD focuses on complex contract clauses such as Limitation of Liability, Indemnification, Change of Control, and Most Favored Nation. It includes 114 queries and over 126,000 query-clause pairs, each ranked on a scale from 1 to 5 stars. The task is to find the most relevant precedent clauses to a query. The bi-encoder retriever paired with pointwise LLMs re-rankers shows promising results. However, substantial improvements are still needed to manage the complex legal work typically undertaken by lawyers effectively. As the first expert-annotated benchmark for contract clause retrieval, ACORD can serve as a valuable IR... | Steven H.

In this paper, we identify a new safety vulnerability in LLMs: their susceptibility to natural distribution shifts between attack prompts and original toxic prompts, where seemingly benign prompts, semantically related to harmful content, can bypass safety mechanisms. To explore this issue, we introduce a novel attack method, ActorBreaker, which identifies actors related to toxic prompts within pre-training distribution to craft multi-turn prompts that gradually lead LLMs to reveal unsafe content. ActorBreaker is grounded in Latour’s actor-network theory, encompassing both human and non-human actors to capture a broader range of vulnerabilities. Our experimental results demonstrate that ActorBreaker outperforms existing attack methods in terms of diversity, effectiveness, and efficiency across aligned LLMs. To address this... | Qibing Ren, Hao Li, Dongrui Liu, Zhanxu Xie, Xiaoya Lu, Yu Qiao, Lei Sha, Junchi Yan, Lizhuang Ma, Jing Shao |  |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating source code, two major challenges persist in UI-to-HTML code generation: (1) effectively representing HTML’s hierarchical structure for LLMs, and (2) bridging the gap between the visual nature of UI designs and the text-based format of HTML code. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Waffle, a new fine-tuning strategy that uses a structure-aware attention mechanism to improve LLMs’ understanding of HTML’s structure and a contrastive fine-tuning approach to align LLMs’ understanding of UI images and HTML code. Models fine-tuned with Waffle show up to 9.00 pp (percentage point) higher HTML match, 0.0982 higher CW-SSIM, 32.99 higher CLIP, and 27.12 pp higher LLEM on our new benchmark WebSight-Test and an existing... | Shanchao Liang, Nan Jiang, Shangshu Qian, Lin Tan |  |

However, few works have explored how math reasoning is encoded within LLM parameters and if it is a skill that can be isolated within models. Doing so could allow targeted intervention to improve math performance without altering non-math behavior and foster understanding of how models encode math reasoning. We introduce Math Neurosurgery (MathNeuro), a computationally efficient method we use to isolate math-specific parameters in LLMs using only forward passes. MathNeuro builds on existing work by using weights and activations to calculate parameter importance, but isolates math-specific parameters by filtering out those important for general language tasks. Through pruning parameters MathNeuro identifies, we delete a LLM’s math reasoning ability without significantly impacting its general... | Bryan R.

While previous efforts have focused on single-LLM, single-turn approaches, we propose to exploit the complementary strengths of multiple LLMs to promote cultural adaptability. We introduce a Multi-Agent Debate framework, where two LLM-based agents debate over a cultural scenario and collaboratively reach a final decision. We propose two variants: one where either LLM agents exclusively debate and another where they dynamically choose between self-reflection and debate during their turns. We evaluate these approaches on 7 open-weight LLMs (and 21 LLM combinations) using the NormAd-ETI benchmark for social etiquette norms in 75 countries. Experiments show that debate improves both overall accuracy and cultural group parity over single-LLM baselines. Notably, multi-agent debate enables relatively small LLMs (7-9B) to achieve accuracies comparable to... | Dayeon Ki, Rachel Rudinger, Tianyi Zhou, Marine Carpuat |  |

One prominent inference speed-up approach is constructing a smaller key-value (KV) cache, relieving LLMs from computing attention over a long sequence of tokens. While such methods work well to generate short sequences, their performance degrades rapidly for long-form generation. Most KV compression happens once, prematurely removing tokens that can be useful later in the generation. We propose a new inference-time method, RefreshKV, that flexibly alternates between full context attention and attention over a subset of input tokens during generation. After each full attention step, we update the smaller KV cache based on the attention pattern over the entire input. Applying our method to off-the-shelf LLMs achieves comparable speedup to eviction-based methods while improving performance for various long-form generation tasks. Lastly, we show... | Fangyuan Xu, Tanya Goyal, Eunsol Choi |  |

While safety alignment using multimodal datasets consisting of text and data of additional modalities can effectively enhance MLLM’s security, it is costly to construct these datasets. Existing low-resource security alignment methods, including textual alignment, have been found to struggle with the security risks posed by additional modalities. To address this, we propose Synthetic Embedding augmented safety Alignment (SEA), which optimizes embeddings of additional modality through gradient updates to expand textual datasets. This enables multimodal safety alignment training even when only textual data is available. Extensive experiments on image, video, and audio-based MLLMs demonstrate that SEA can synthesize a high-quality embedding on a single RTX3090 GPU within 24 seconds. SEA significantly improves the security of MLLMs when faced with threats from additional modalities. To assess the security risks... | Weikai Lu, Hao Peng, Huiping Zhuang, Cen Chen, Ziqian Zeng |  |

In this paper, we introduce Chain-of-Reasoning (CoR), a novel unified framework that integrates multiple reasoning paradigms — Natural Language Reasoning (NLR), Algorithmic Reasoning (AR), and Symbolic Reasoning (SR) — to enable synergistic collaboration. CoR generates multiple potential answers using different reasoning paradigms and synthesizes them into a coherent final solution. We propose a Progressive Paradigm Training (PPT) strategy that allows models to progressively master these paradigms, culminating in the development of at CoR-Math-7B. Experimental results demonstrate that CoR-Math-7B significantly outperforms current SOTA models, achieving up to a 41.0% absolute improvement over GPT-4o in theorem proving tasks and a 15% improvement over RL-based methods on the MATH benchmark in arithmetic... | Yiyao Yu, Yuxiang Zhang, Dongdong Zhang, Xiao Liang, Hengyuan Zhang, Xingxing Zhang, Mahmoud Khademi, Hany Hassan Awadalla, Junjie Wang, Yujiu Yang, Furu Wei |  |

Various factors, such as word frequency, recency bias in attention, and context size, have been theorized to affect PPP, yet there is no current account that explains why such a tipping point exists, and how it interacts with LMs’ pretraining dynamics more generally. We hypothesize that the underlying factor is a pretraining phase transition, characterized by the rapid emergence of specialized attention heads. We conduct a series of correlational and causal experiments to show that such a phase transition is responsible for the tipping point in PPP. We then show that, rather than producing attention patterns that contribute to the degradation in PPP, phase transitions alter the subsequent learning dynamics of the model, such that further training keeps damaging PPP. | Tatsuya Aoyama, Ethan Wilcox |  |

Psychological studies have shown that knowledge of persuasive fallacies helps individuals detect disinformation. Inspired by these findings, we experimented with large language models (LLMs) to test whether infusing persuasion knowledge enhances disinformation detection. As a result, we introduce the Persuasion-Augmented Chain of Thought (PCoT), a novel approach that leverages persuasion to improve disinformation detection in zero-shot classification. We extensively evaluate PCoT on online news and social media posts. Moreover, we publish two novel, up-to-date disinformation datasets: EUDisinfo and MultiDis. These datasets enable the evaluation of PCoT on content entirely unseen by the LLMs used in our experiments, as the content was published after the models’ knowledge cutoffs. We show that, on average, PCoT outperforms competitive methods by 15% across five LLMs and five datasets. These findings highlight the value of... | Arkadiusz Modzelewski, Witold Sosnowski, Tiziano Labruna, Adam Wierzbicki, Giovanni Da San Martino |  |

However, the study of language coordination has been accompanied by a diverse and inconsistently applied set of measures and theoretical perspectives. This diversity has significant consequences, as replication studies have highlighted the brittleness of certain measures and called influential findings into question. While prior work has addressed specific modeling decisions and model types, linguistic coordination research has yet to fully examine, synthesize, and critique the space of modeling choices available. In this work, we present a framework to organize the linguistic coordination literature. Using this schema, we provide a high-level overview of the choices involved in the measurement process and synthesize relevant critiques. Based on both gaps and limitations surfaced from... | Benjamin Roger Litterer, David Jurgens, Dallas Card |  |

Current approaches often lack the granular data needed to model these personalized responses, relying instead on aggregated labels that obscure the rich variability driven by individual differences. We introduce iNews, a novel large-scale dataset specifically designed to facilitate the modeling of personalized affective responses to news content. Our dataset comprises annotations from 291 demographically diverse UK participants across 2,899 multimodal Facebook news posts from major UK outlets, with an average of 5.18 annotators per sample. For each post, annotators provide multifaceted labels including valence, arousal, dominance, discrete emotions, content relevance judgments, sharing likelihood, and modality importance ratings. Crucially, we collect comprehensive annotator persona information covering demographics,... | Tiancheng Hu, Nigel Collier |  |

As AI systems become more integrated into global applications, ensuring they do not inadvertently perpetuate cultural offenses is critical. To this end, we introduce Multi-Cultural Set of Inappropriate Gestures and Nonverbal Signs (MC-SIGNS), a dataset of 288 gesture-country pairs annotated for offensiveness, cultural significance, and contextual factors across 25 gestures and 85 countries. Through systematic evaluation using MC-SIGNS, we uncover critical limitations: text-to-image (T2I) systems exhibit strong US-centric biases, performing better at detecting offensive gestures in US contexts than in non-US ones; large language models (LLMs) tend to over-flag gestures as offensive; and vision-language models (VLMs) default to US-based interpretations when responding to universal concepts like wishing... | Akhila Yerukola, Saadia Gabriel, Nanyun Peng, Maarten Sap |  |

However, current methods face challenges such as low compression ratios and potential training-test overlap during evaluation. To address these issues, we propose 500xCompressor, a method that compresses natural language contexts into a minimum of one special token and demonstrates strong generalization ability. The 500xCompressor introduces approximately 0.3% additional parameters and achieves compression ratios ranging from 6x to 500x, achieving 27-90% reduction in calculations and 55-83% memory savings when generating 100-400 tokens for new and reused prompts at 500x compression, while retaining 70-74% (F1) and 77-84% (Exact Match) of the LLM capabilities compared to using non-compressed prompts. It is designed to compress any text, answer various types of questions, and can be utilized by the original LLM without requiring fine-tuning. Initially,... | Zongqian Li, Yixuan Su, Nigel Collier |  |

However, the contextual knowledge can contain private information that may be leaked when answering queries, and estimating this privacy leakage is not well understood. A straightforward approach of directly comparing an LM’s output to the contexts can overestimate the privacy risk, since the LM’s parametric knowledge might already contain the augmented contextual knowledge. To this end, we introduce context influence, a metric that builds on differential privacy, a widely-adopted privacy notion, to estimate the privacy leakage of contextual knowledge during decoding. Our approach effectively measures how each subset of the context influences an LM’s response while separating the specific parametric knowledge of the LM. Using our context influence metric, we demonstrate that context privacy leakage occurs when contextual knowledge is out... | James Flemings, Bo Jiang, Wanrong Zhang, Zafar Takhirov, Murali Annavaram |  |

A common solution to FSCD modeling is data augmentation. Unfortunately, existing augmentation methods are not well-suited to a variety of real-world EAE contexts, including (i) modeling long documents (documents with over 10 sentences), and (ii) modeling challenging role types (i.e., event roles with little to no training data and semantically outlying roles). We introduce two novel LLM-powered data augmentation methods for generating extractive document-level EAE samples using zero in-domain training data. We validate the generalizability of our approach on four datasets — showing significant performance increases in low-resource settings. Our highest performing models provide a 13-pt increase in F1 score on zero-shot role extraction in FSCD evaluation. | Joseph Gatto, Omar Sharif, Parker Seegmiller, Sarah Masud Preum |  |

However, limited data has prevented large-scale computational analysis of the podcast ecosystem. To fill this gap, we introduce a massive dataset of over 1.1M podcast transcripts that is largely comprehensive of all English language podcasts available through public RSS feeds from May and June of 2020. This data is not limited to text, but includes metadata, inferred speaker roles, and audio features and speaker turns for a subset of 370K episodes. Using this data, we conduct a foundational investigation into the content, structure, and responsiveness of this ecosystem. Together, our data and analyses open the door to continued computational research of this popular and impactful medium. | Benjamin Roger Litterer, David Jurgens, Dallas Card |  |

Nonetheless, the extent of their comprehension pertaining to logical semantics and rules of inference remains somewhat uncertain. Evaluating such understanding necessitates a rigorous examination of these models’ generalisation capacity to out-of-distribution data. In this study, we probe the generalisation prowess of Transformer models with respect to the hitherto unexplored domain of numerical satisfiability problems. Our investigation reveals that Transformers exhibit minimal scale and noise invariance, alongside limited vocabulary and number invariance. However, even when Transformer models experience a notable decline in performance on out-of-distribution test sets, they often still surpass the random baseline by a considerable margin. | Tharindu Madusanka, Marco Valentino, Iqra Zahid, Ian PrattHartmann, Riza BatistaNavarro |  |

Despite this, what constitutes NLP research remains debated. In this work, we address the question by quantitatively examining NLP research papers. We propose a taxonomy of research contributions and introduce _NLPContributions_, a dataset of nearly 2k NLP research paper abstracts, carefully annotated to identify scientific contributions and classify their types according to this taxonomy. We also introduce a novel task of automatically identifying contribution statements and classifying their types from research papers. We present experimental results for this task and apply our model to ~29k NLP research papers to analyze their contributions, aiding in the understanding of the nature of NLP research. We show that NLP research has taken a winding path — with the focus on language and human-centric studies being prominent in the 1970s and 80s, tapering off in the 1990s and 2000s, and starting to rise again since... | Aniket Pramanick, Yufang Hou, Saif M.

Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable out-of-domain generalizability to novel tasks. To demonstrate LLMs’ potential for molecule optimization, we introduce \mathtt{MuMOInstruct}, the first high-quality instruction-tuning dataset specifically focused on multi-property molecule optimization tasks. Leveraging \mathtt{MuMOInstruct}, we develop \mathtt{GeLLM^3O}s, a series of instruction-tuned LLMs for molecule optimization. Extensive evaluations across 5 in-domain and 5 out-of-domain tasks demonstrate that \mathtt{GeLLM^3O}s consistently outperform state-of-the-art baselines. \mathtt{GeLLM^3O}s also exhibit outstanding zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks, significantly outperforming powerful closed-source LLMs. Such strong... | Vishal Dey, Xiao Hu, Xia Ning |  |

Conversational contexts often pose core NLP challenges such as (i) extracting relevant information buried in fragmented data sources, and (ii) modeling parallel thought processes. These two challenges occur frequently in medical dialogue as a doctor asks questions based not only on patient utterances but also their prior EHR data and current diagnostic hypotheses. Asking medical questions in asynchronous conversations compounds these issues as doctors can only rely on static EHR information to motivate follow-up questions. To address these challenges, we introduce FollowupQ, a novel framework for enhancing asynchronous medical conversation.FollowupQ is a multi-agent framework that processes patient messages and EHR data to generate personalized follow-up questions, clarifying patient-reported medical conditions.

They enhance decision-making by storing private user-agent interactions in the memory module for demonstrations, introducing new privacy risks for LLM agents. In this work, we systematically investigate the vulnerability of LLM agents to our proposed Memory EXTRaction Attack (MEXTRA) under a black-box setting. To extract private information from memory, we propose an effective attacking prompt design and an automated prompt generation method based on different levels of knowledge about the LLM agent. Experiments on two representative agents demonstrate the effectiveness of MEXTRA. Moreover, we explore key factors influencing memory leakage from both the agent designer’s and the attacker’s perspectives. Our findings highlight the urgent need for effective memory safeguards in LLM agent design and deployment. | Bo Wang, Weiyi He, Shenglai Zeng, Zhen Xiang, Yue Xing, Jiliang Tang, Pengfei He |  |

While QE metrics have been optimized to align with human judgments, whether they encode social biases has been largely overlooked. Biased QE risks favoring certain demographic groups over others, e.g., by exacerbating gaps in visibility and usability. This paper defines and investigates gender bias of QE metrics and discusses its downstream implications for machine translation (MT). Experiments with state-of-the-art QE metrics across multiple domains, datasets, and languages reveal significant bias. When a human entity’s gender in the source is undisclosed, masculine-inflected translations score higher than feminine-inflected ones, and gender-neutral translations are penalized. Even when contextual cues disambiguate gender, using context-aware QE metrics leads to more errors in selecting the... | Emmanouil Zaranis, Giuseppe Attanasio, Sweta Agrawal, André F. T. Martins |  |

Recently, many-to-many multimodal summarization (M3S) garnered interest as it enables a unified model for multilingual and cross-lingual MS. Existing methods have made progress by facilitating the transfer of common multimodal summarization knowledge. While, prior M3S models that fully share parameters neglect the language-specific knowledge learning, where potential interference between languages may limit the flexible adaptation of MS modes across different language combinations and hinder further collaborative improvements in joint M3S training. Based on this observation, we propose Language Constrained Multimodal Hyper Adapter (LCMHA) for M3S. LCMHA integrates language-specific multimodal adapters into multilingual pre-trained backbones via a language constrained hypernetwork, enabling relaxed parameter sharing that enhances language-specific learning while preserving shared MS knowledge learning.

Since language models are prone to various types of errors during the reasoning process, PRMs are required to possess nuanced capabilities for detecting various implicit error types in real-world scenarios. However, current benchmarks primarily focus on step correctness, failing to evaluate PRMs’ performance systematically. To address this gap, we introduce PRMBench, a process-level benchmark specifically designed to assess the fine-grained error detection capabilities of PRMs. PRMBench comprises 6,216 carefully designed problems and 83,456 step-level labels, evaluating models across multiple dimensions, including simplicity, soundness, and sensitivity. In our experiments on 25 models, spanning both open-source PRMs and closed-source large language models prompted as critic models, we uncover significant... | Mingyang Song, Zhaochen Su, Xiaoye Qu, Jiawei Zhou, Yu Cheng |  |

Existing methods, such as quantized LoRA (QLoRA), are efficient when adapting to a single dataset. When training on multiple datasets of different tasks, a common setup in practice, it remains unclear how to design an efficient adaptation for fine-tuning language models. We propose to use an ensemble of multiple smaller adapters instead of a single adapter per task. We design an efficient algorithm that partitions n datasets into m groups, where m is typically much smaller than n in practice, and train one adapter for each group before taking a weighted combination to form the ensemble. The algorithm leverages a first-order approximation property of low-rank adaptation to quickly obtain the fine-tuning performances of dataset combinations since methods like LoRA stay close to the base model. Hence, we use the gradients of the base model to estimate its behavior during fine-tuning.... | Dongyue Li, Ziniu Zhang, Lu Wang, Hongyang R. Zhang |  |

When an LLM is prompted with sequential data, it often fails to recall preceding context. For example, when we ask an LLM to recall the line preceding “O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave” in the U.S. National Anthem, it often fails to correctly return “Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there”—this is due to the reversal curse. It occurs because language models such as ChatGPT and Llama generate text based on preceding tokens, requiring facts to be learned and reproduced in a consistent token order.

However, understanding of how jailbreaking works remains limited, hindering the development of effective defense strategies. To address this issue, we conduct a large-scale analysis of seven different jailbreak methods and identify that disagreements among methods stem from insufficient observation samples.We introduce the concept of a safety boundary and discover that jailbreaks shift harmful activations outside this boundary, where LLMs become less sensitive to harmful information. Our analysis reveals that low and middle layers play a critical role in these shifts, while deeper layers have a lesser impact.Building on these insights, we propose a novel defense mechanism called Activation Boundary Defense (ABD), which adaptively constrains activations within the safety boundary. To enhance its effectiveness, we use Bayesian optimization to selectively apply... | Lang Gao, Jiahui Geng, Xiangliang Zhang, Preslav Nakov, Xiuying Chen |  |

Such assistants rely on pre-trained programming knowledge to execute multi-step goals by composing objects and functions defined in assistant libraries into action execution programs. To achieve this, we develop ASPERA, a framework comprising an assistant library simulation and a human-assisted LLM data generation engine. Our engine allows developers to guide LLM generation of high-quality tasks consisting of complex user queries, simulation state and corresponding validation programs, tackling data availability and evaluation robustness challenges. Alongside the framework we release Asper-Bench, an evaluation dataset of 250 challenging tasks generated using ASPERA, which we use to show that program generation grounded in custom assistant libraries is a significant challenge to LLMs compared to dependency-free code generation. | Alexandru Coca, Mark Gaynor, Zhenxing Zhang, Jianpeng Cheng, BoHsiang Tseng, Peter Boothroyd, Héctor Martínez Alonso, Diarmuid Ó Séaghdha, Anders Johannsen |  |

Existing research either neglects the intricate interplay between emotion and intent, leading to suboptimal controllability of empathy, or resorts to large language models (LLMs), which incur significant computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce ReflectDiffu, a lightweight and comprehensive framework for empathetic response generation. This framework incorporates emotion contagion to augment emotional expressiveness and employs an emotion-reasoning mask to pinpoint critical emotional elements. Additionally, it integrates intent mimicry within reinforcement learning for refinement during diffusion. By harnessing an intent twice reflect mechanism of Exploring-Sampling-Correcting, ReflectDiffu adeptly translates emotional decision-making into precise intent actions, thereby addressing empathetic response misalignments stemming from emotional... | Jiahao Yuan, Zixiang Di, Zhiqing Cui, Guisong Yang, Usman Naseem |  |

Recent PMI decoding strategies mitigate over-reliance on prior knowledge by comparing output probabilities with and without source documents, effectively enhancing contextual utilization and improving faithfulness. However, existing strategies often neglect the explicit use of salient contextual information and rely on static hyperparameters to fix the balance between contextual and prior knowledge, limiting their flexibility. In this work, we propose Salience-Aware Reinforced Adaptive decoding (SARA), which incorporates salient information and allows the model to adaptively determine reliance on the source document’s context, salient context, and the model’s prior knowledge based on pointwise mutual information. Moreover, a tokenwise adaptive decoding mechanism via reinforcement learning is proposed in SARA to... | Nayu Liu, Junnan Zhu, Yiming Ma, Zhicong Lu, Wenlei Xu, Yong Yang, Jiang Zhong, Kaiwen Wei |  |

However, the continuous development of new models presents a major challenge: migrating to a potentially superior model often requires the computationally expensive process of re-embedding entire datasets—without any guarantee of performance improvement. This paper presents Embedding-Converter, a novel framework for efficiently transforming embeddings between different models, thus avoiding costly ‘re-embedding’. The proposed approach achieves 100 times faster and cheaper computations in real-world applications. Experiments show that Embedding-Converter not only streamlines transitions to new models, but can also improve upon the source model’s performance, approaching that of the target model. This facilitates efficient evaluation and broader adoption of new embedding models by significantly reducing the overhead of model switching. Furthermore, Embedding-Converter addresses latency limitations by enabling the use of smaller... | Jinsung Yoon, Sercan Ö. Arik |  |

However, evaluating LLMs in this task remains challenging due to their ability to generate human-like text, often producing synonyms or abbreviations of gold-standard answers, making traditional automatic evaluation metrics unreliable. On the other hand, while human evaluation is more reliable, it is costly and time-consuming, making it impractical for real-world applications. This paper investigates the use of LLMs-as-the-Judge as an alternative evaluation method for biomedical relation extraction. We benchmark 8 LLMs as judges to evaluate the responses generated by 5 other LLMs across 3 biomedical relation extraction datasets. Unlike other text-generation tasks, we observe that LLM-based judges perform quite poorly (usually below 50% accuracy) in the biomedical relation extraction task. Our findings reveal that it happens mainly because relations... | Md. Tahmid Rahman Laskar, Israt Jahan, Elham Dolatabadi, Chun Peng, Enamul Hoque, Jimmy Huang |  |

Unlike traditional VQA tasks, GeoVQA asks for details about the image-related culture, landscape, etc. This requires not only the identification of the objects in the image, their properties and relations, but also the understanding of the geographic knowledge of the objects, such as location, transportation, landmark, cuisine, etc. This background knowledge does not explicitly appear in the image, nor is there an extra-textual description. Without this missing but necessary knowledge, it is difficult for existing matching-based methods to infer the correct answer. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new geographic reasoning framework for our task. We first analyze the image and describe its fine-grained content by text and keywords using a multi-modal retrieval augmented technique, so as to deduce an answer in a unified textual modality. Next, we retrieve the... | Fan Li, Jianxing Yu, Jielong Tang, Wenqing Chen, Hanjiang Lai, Yanghui Rao, Jian Yin |  |

Existing defense mechanisms have not fully deleted harmful knowledge in LLMs, which allows such attacks to bypass safeguards and produce harmful outputs. To address this challenge, we propose a novel safety alignment strategy, Constrained Knowledge Unlearning (CKU), which focuses on two primary objectives: knowledge localization and retention, and unlearning harmful knowledge. CKU works by scoring neurons in specific multilayer perceptron (MLP) layers to identify a subset U of neurons associated with useful knowledge. During the unlearning process, CKU prunes the gradients of neurons in U to preserve valuable knowledge while effectively mitigating harmful content. Experimental results demonstrate that CKU significantly enhances model safety without compromising overall performance, offering a superior balance between safety and utility compared to existing methods.... | Zesheng Shi, Yucheng Zhou, Jing Li, Yuxin Jin, Yu Li, Daojing He, Fangming Liu, Saleh Alharbi, Jun Yu, Min Zhang |  |

Such models have been shown to be highly capable, but, at the same time, lacking some basic visual understanding skills. In this paper, we set out to understand the limitations of SoTA VLMs on fundamental visual tasks (object classification, spatial understanding, and ability to delineate individual object instances through counting), by constructing a series of tests that probe which components of design, specifically, may be lacking. Importantly, we go significantly beyond the current benchmarks, which simply measure the final performance of VLM response, by also comparing and contrasting it to the performance of probes trained directly on features obtained from the visual encoder, intermediate vision-language projection and LLM-decoder output. In doing so, we uncover shortcomings in VLMs and make a number of important observations about their... | Shivam Chandhok, WanCyuan Fan, Vered Shwartz, Vineeth N. Balasubramanian, Leonid Sigal |  |

While efforts to improve LVLM efficiency are growing, existing methods lack comprehensive evaluation across diverse backbones, benchmarks, and metrics. In this work, we systematically evaluate mainstream acceleration techniques for LVLMs, categorized into token and parameter compression. We introduce EffiVLM-BENCH, a unified framework for assessing not only absolute performance but also generalization and loyalty, while exploring Pareto-optimal trade-offs. Our extensive experiments and in-depth analyses offer insights into optimal strategies for accelerating LVLMs. We open-source code and recipes for EffiVLM-BENCH to foster future research. | Zekun Wang, Minghua Ma, Zexin Wang, Rongchuan Mu, Liping Shan, Ming Liu, Bing Qin |  |

Rather than predicting only the next token (NTP), MTP predicts the next \*k\* tokens at each prediction step, using multiple prediction heads. MTP has shown promise in improving downstream performance, inference speed, and training efficiency, particularly for large models. However, prior work has shown that smaller language models (SLMs) struggle with the MTP objective. To address this, we propose a curriculum learning strategy for MTP training, exploring two variants: a forward curriculum, which gradually increases the complexity of the pre-training objective from NTP to MTP, and a reverse curriculum, which does the opposite. Our experiments show that the forward curriculum enables SLMs to better leverage the MTP objective during pre-training, improving downstream NTP performance and generative output quality, while retaining the benefits of self-speculative decoding. The reverse... | Ansar Aynetdinov, Alan Akbik |  |

Critic-Guided Planning with Retrieval-Augmentation for Solving Challenging Tasks](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.1244/) |  | 0 | Large language models excel at problem-solving but often struggle with complex reasoning and factual accuracy. While chain-of-thought and retrieval-augmented generation help break down problems and retrieve knowledge, they still falter on challenging tasks like competitive programming due to frequent reasoning errors and irrelevant retrieval. To address this, we introduce Critic-guided planning with Retrieval-augmentation, CR-Planner, a novel framework that leverages fine-tuned critic models to guide both reasoning and retrieval processes through planning. CR-Planner iteratively selects and executes sub-goals, guided by critic models. A sub-goal critic identifies promising sub-goals from reasoning, query generation, and retrieval, while an execution critic evaluates outputs of sub-goal executions. We employ Monte Carlo Tree Search to collect data for critic training, allowing systematic exploration of action sequences and effective navigation toward the final answer. We evaluate... | Xingxuan Li, Weiwen Xu, Ruochen Zhao, Fangkai Jiao, Shafiq Joty, Lidong Bing |  |

This paper delves into long-context language model (LCLM) evaluation through many-shot ICL. We first ask: what types of ICL tasks benefit from additional demonstrations, and how effective are they in evaluating LCLMs? We find that classification and summarization tasks show performance improvements with additional demonstrations, while translation and reasoning tasks do not exhibit clear trends. Next, we investigate the extent to which different tasks necessitate retrieval versus global context understanding. We develop metrics to categorize ICL tasks into two groups: (i) similar-sample learning (SSL): tasks where retrieval of the most similar examples is sufficient for good performance, and (ii) all-sample learning (ASL): tasks that necessitate a deeper comprehension of all examples in the prompt. Lastly, we introduce a new many-shot... | Kaijian Zou, Muhammad Khalifa, Lu Wang |  |

However, many techniques used to train models for inference-time scaling require tasks to have answers that can be verified, limiting their application to domains such as math, coding and logical reasoning. We take inspiration from how humans make first attempts, ask for detailed feedback from others and make improvements based on such feedback across a wide spectrum of open-ended endeavors. To this end, we collect HelpSteer3 data to train dedicated Feedback and Edit Models that are capable of performing inference-time scaling for open-ended general-domain tasks. In our setup, one model generates an initial response, which are given feedback by a second model, that are then used by a third model to edit the response. We show that performance on Arena Hard, a benchmark strongly predictive of Chatbot Arena Elo can be boosted by scaling the number of initial response drafts,... | Zhilin Wang, Jiaqi Zeng, Olivier Delalleau, Daniel Egert, Ellie Evans, HooChang Shin, Felipe Soares, Yi Dong, Oleksii Kuchaiev |  |

We introduce CulturalBench: a set of 1,696 human-written and human-verified questions to assess LMs’ cultural knowledge, covering 45 global regions including underrepresented ones like Bangladesh, Zimbabwe, and Peru. Questions are each verified by five independent annotators and span 17 diverse topics ranging from food preferences to greeting etiquette. We construct CulturalBench using methods inspired by Human-AI Red-Teaming. Compared to human performance (92.4% accuracy), the hard version of CulturalBench is challenging even for the best-performing frontier LMs, ranging from 28.7% to 61.5% in accuracy. We find that LMs often struggle with tricky questions that have multiple correct answers (e.g., What utensils do the Chinese usually use?), revealing a tendency to overfit to a single answer. Our results indicate that... | Yu Ying Chiu, Liwei Jiang, Bill Yuchen Lin, Chan Young Park, Shuyue Stella Li, Sahithya Ravi, Mehar Bhatia, Maria Antoniak, Yulia Tsvetkov, Vered Shwartz, Yejin Choi |  |

Both stages require annotated data that are very different in structure and costs. We study how to optimally allocate a fixed training data budget between the two stages, through extensive experiments spanning four diverse tasks, multiple model sizes and various data annotation costs. Our findings reveal that just SFT on the base model dominates performance in low-data regimes (<1,000 annotated examples). With larger data-budgets, we observe that a combination of SFT and PFT, often with increasing portions allocated towards preference data yields optimal performance. However, completely eliminating SFT and running PFT directly on the base model yields suboptimal performance, described as the cold start problem on tasks like mathematics. We observe that this is due to the distribution shift arising... | Mohit Raghavendra, Junmo Kang, Alan Ritter |  |

Recently, several papers claim autonomous research agents can generate novel research ideas. Amidst the prevailing optimism, we document a critical concern: a considerable fraction of such research documents are smartly plagiarized. Unlike past efforts where experts evaluate the novelty and feasibility of research ideas, we request 13 experts to operate under a different situational logic: to identify similarities between LLM-generated research documents and existing work. Concerningly, the experts identify 24% of the 50 evaluated research documents to be either paraphrased (with one-to-one methodological mapping), or significantly borrowed from existing work. These reported instances are cross-verified by authors of the source papers. Experts find an additional 32% ideas to partially overlap with prior work, and a small fraction to be completely original. Problematically, these LLM-generated research... | Tarun Gupta, Danish Pruthi |  |

Current methods fall short due to their reliance on extensive exemplar data, difficulty in adapting topic-specific content, and issues with long-text coherence. To address these challenges, we propose the concept of Adaptive Imitation and present a novel Recurrent Plan-then-Adapt (RePA) framework. RePA leverages large language models (LLMs) for effective adaptive imitation through a fine-grained plan-then-adapt process. RePA also enables recurrent segment-by-segment imitation, supported by two memory structures that enhance input clarity and output coherence. We also develop task-specific evaluation metrics–imitativeness, adaptiveness, and adaptive-imitativeness–using LLMs as evaluators. Experimental results across our collected three diverse datasets demonstrate that RePA surpasses existing baselines in producing factual,... | Yuxiang Liu, Kevin ChenChuan Chang |  |

We address the task of extracting clinical events and their temporal relations using the well-studied I2B2 2012 Temporal Relations Challenge corpus. This task is inherently challenging due to complex clinical language, long documents, and sparse annotations. We introduce GraphTREx, a novel method integrating span-based entity-relation extraction, clinical large pre-trained language models (LPLMs), and Heterogeneous Graph Transformers (HGT) to capture local and global dependencies. Our HGT component facilitates information propagation across the document through innovative global landmarks that bridge distant entities and improves the state-of-the-art with 5.5% improvement in the tempeval F1 score over the previous best and up to 8.9% improvement on long-range relations, which presents a formidable challenge.

This study examines how linguistic similarity affects chatbot performance, focusing on integrating African American English (AAE) into virtual agents to better serve the African American community. We develop text-based and spoken chatbots using large language models and text-to-speech technology, then evaluate them with AAE speakers against standard English chatbots. Our results show that while text-based AAE chatbots often underperform, spoken chatbots benefit from an African American voice and AAE elements, improving performance and preference. These findings underscore the complexities of linguistic personalization and the dynamics between text and speech modalities, highlighting technological limitations that affect chatbots’ AA speech generation and pointing to promising future research directions. | Sarah E.

In this work, we explore the potential of Large Language Models as health assistants for AD diagnosis from patient-generated text using in-context learning (ICL), where tasks are defined through a few input-output examples. Empirical results reveal that conventional ICL methods, such as similarity-based selection, perform poorly for AD diagnosis, likely due to the inherent complexity of this task. To address this, we introduce Delta-KNN, a novel demonstration selection strategy that enhances ICL performance. Our method leverages a delta score to assess the relative gains of each training example, coupled with a KNN-based retriever that dynamically selects optimal “representatives” for a given input.Experiments on two AD detection datasets across three models demonstrate that Delta-KNN consistently outperforms... | Chuyuan Li, Raymond Li, Thalia Shoshana Field, Giuseppe Carenini |  |

In this paper, we explore the challenges and limitations of model-generated writing feedback by defining a new task, dataset, and evaluation frameworks. To study model performance in a controlled manner, we present a novel test set of 1,300 stories that we corrupted to intentionally introduce writing issues. We study the performance of commonly used LLMs in this task with both automatic and human evaluation metrics. Our analysis shows that current models have strong out-of-the-box behavior in many respects—providing specific and mostly accurate writing feedback. However, models often fail to identify the biggest writing issue in the story and to correctly decide when to offer critical vs. positive feedback. | Hannah Rashkin, Elizabeth Clark, Fantine Huot, Mirella Lapata |  |

This ‘under-representation’ has motivated recent cross-lingual transfer methods to leverage the English representation space by e.g. mixing English and ‘non-English’ tokens at the input level or extending model parameters to accommodate new languages. However, these approaches often come at the cost of increased computational complexity. We propose Fusion for Language Representations (FLARE) in adapters, a novel method that enhances representation quality and downstream performance for languages other than English while maintaining parameter efficiency. FLARE integrates source and target language representations within low-rank (LoRA) adapters using lightweight linear transformations, maintaining parameter efficiency while improving transfer performance.

This work has largely progressed without a shared conception of culture, instead choosing to rely on a wide array of cultural proxies. However, this leads to a number of recurring limitations: coarse national boundaries fail to capture nuanced differences that lay within them, limited coverage restricts datasets to only a subset of usually highly-represented cultures, and a lack of dynamicity results in static cultural benchmarks that do not change as culture evolves. In this position paper, we argue that these methodological limitations are symptomatic of a theoretical gap. We draw on a well-developed theory of culture from sociocultural linguistics to fill this gap by 1) demonstrating in a case study how it can clarify methodological constraints and affordances, 2) offering theoretically-motivated paths... | Naitian Zhou, David Bamman, Isaac L.

However, human auditory perception is inherently selective: listeners focus on specific speakers while ignoring others in complex auditory scenes. Existing models do not incorporate this selectivity, limiting their ability to generate perception-aligned responses. To address this, we introduce intention-informed auditory scene understanding (II-ASU) and present Auditory Attention-Driven LLM (AAD-LLM), a prototype system that integrates brain signals to infer listener attention. AAD-LLM extends an auditory LLM by incorporating intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings to decode which speaker a listener is attending to and refine responses accordingly. The model first predicts the attended speaker from neural activity, then conditions response generation on this inferred attentional state. We evaluate AAD-LLM on speaker... | Xilin Jiang, Sukru Samet Dindar, Vishal Choudhari, Stephan Bickel, Ashesh D. Mehta, Guy M. McKhann II, Daniel Friedman, Adeen Flinker, Nima Mesgarani |  |

On the Five Standard Positions](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.1258/) |  | 0 | We identify five positions on whether large language models (LLMs) and chatbots can be said to exhibit semantic understanding. These positions differ in whether they attribute semantics to LLMs and/or chatbots trained on feedback, what kind of semantics they attribute (inferential or referential), and in virtue of what they attribute referential semantics (internal or external causes). This allows for 2^^4=16 logically possible positions, but we have only seen people argue for five of these. Based on a pairwise comparison of these five positions, we conclude that the better theory of semantics in large language models is, in fact, a sixth combination: Both large language models and chatbots have inferential and referential semantics, grounded in both internal and external causes. | Anders Søgaard |  |

How to intervene on such system outputs to mitigate anthropomorphic behaviors and their attendant harmful outcomes, however, remains understudied. With this work, we aim to provide empirical and theoretical grounding for developing such interventions. To do so, we compile an inventory of interventions grounded both in prior literature and a crowdsourcing study where participants edited system outputs to make them less human-like. Drawing on this inventory, we also develop a conceptual framework to help characterize the landscape of possible interventions, articulate distinctions between different types of interventions, and provide a theoretical basis for evaluating the effectiveness of different interventions. | Myra Cheng, Su Lin Blodgett, Alicia DeVrio, Lisa Egede, Alexandra Olteanu |  |

We conduct a user survey to identify adoption patterns and key challenges users face with such technologies. Despite a high adoption rate of these models, our findings highlight concerns related to contextual understanding, cultural sensitivity, and complex scene understanding, particularly for individuals who may rely solely on them for visual interpretation. Informed by these results, we collate five user-centred tasks with image and video inputs, including a novel task on Optical Braille Recognition. Our systematic evaluation of twelve MLLMs reveals that further advancements are necessary to overcome limitations related to cultural context, multilingual support, Braille reading comprehension, assistive object recognition, and hallucinations.

Human-like language might improve user experience, but might also lead to deception, overreliance, and stereotyping. Assessing these potential impacts requires a systematic way to measure human-like tone in LLM outputs. We introduce HumT and SocioT, metrics for human-like tone and other dimensions of social perceptions in text data based on relative probabilities from an LLM. By measuring HumT across preference and usage datasets, we find that users prefer less human-like outputs from LLMs in many contexts. HumT also offers insights into the perceptions and impacts of anthropomorphism: human-like LLM outputs are highly correlated with warmth, social closeness, femininity, and low status, which are closely linked to the aforementioned harms. We introduce DumT, a method using HumT to systematically control and reduce the degree of human-like tone while preserving model performance. DumT offers a practical approach for mitigating... | Myra Cheng, Sunny Yu, Dan Jurafsky |  |

However, standard benchmarks, such as MMLU, measure LLM capabilities in isolation (i.e., “AI-alone”). Here, we design and conduct a user study to convert MMLU questions into user-AI conversations, by seeding the user with the question and having them carry out a conversation with the LLM to answer their question. We release ChatBench, a new dataset with AI-alone, user-alone, and user-AI data for 396 questions and two LLMs, including 144K answers and 7,336 user-AI conversations. We find that AI-alone accuracy fails to predict user-AI accuracy, with significant differences across multiple subjects (math, physics, and moral reasoning), and we analyze the user-AI conversations to provide insight into how they diverge from AI-alone benchmarks. Finally, we show that fine-tuning a user simulator on a subset of ChatBench improves its ability to estimate user-AI... | Serina Chang, Ashton Anderson, Jake M. Hofman |  |

We address two key challenges in improving secure code generation. First, obtaining high quality training data covering a broad set of security issues is critical. To address this, we introduce a method for distilling a preference dataset of insecure and secure code pairs from frontier LLMs, along with a security reasoning that explains the issues and the fix. The key idea here is to make use of security knowledge sources to devise a systematic prompting strategy that ensures broad coverage. Second, aligning models to secure code requires focusing on localized regions of code. Direct preference optimization methods, like SimPO, are not designed to handle these localized differences and turn out to be ineffective. We address this with a new localized preference optimization algorithm that masks the security related tokens in both the winning (secure) and losing (insecure) responses. To prevent loss in code quality, we also add a... | Mohammad Saqib Hasan, Saikat Chakraborty, Santu Karmaker, Niranjan Balasubramanian |  |

A Crosslinguistic Study of (Im)possible Language Learning in LMs](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.1264/) |  | 0 | Do language models (LMs) offer insights into human language learning? A common argument against this idea is that because their architecture and training paradigm are so vastly different from humans, LMs can learn arbitrary inputs as easily as natural languages. We test this claim by training LMs to model impossible and typologically unattested languages.Unlike previous work, which has focused exclusively on English, we conduct experiments on 12 languages from 4 language families with two newly constructed parallel corpora. Our results show that while GPT-2 small can largely distinguish attested languages from their impossible counterparts, it does not achieve perfect separation between all the attested languages and all the impossible ones. We further test whether GPT-2 small distinguishes typologically attested from unattested languages with different NP orders by manipulating word order based on Greenberg’s Universal 20. We find that the model’s perplexity scores do not distinguish... | Xiulin Yang, Tatsuya Aoyama, Yuekun Yao, Ethan Wilcox |  |

Pairwise ranking has emerged as state-of-the-art method to evaluate human preferences by having humans compare pairs of LLM outputs based on predefined criteria, enabling ranking across multiple LLMs by aggregating pairwise results through algorithms like Elo. However, applying these ranking algorithms in the context of LLM evaluation introduces several challenges, such as inconsistent ranking results when using ELO. Currently there is a lack of systematic study of those ranking algorithms in evaluating LLMs. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of ranking systems for head-to-head comparisons of LLMs. We formally define a set of fundamental principles for effective ranking and conduct extensive evaluations on the robustness of several ranking algorithms in the context of LLMs. Our analysis uncovers key insights into the factors that affect ranking accuracy and efficiency, offering guidelines for selecting the most... | Roland Daynauth, Christopher Clarke, Krisztián Flautner, Lingjia Tang, Jason Mars |  |

However, these tools must be implemented in advance by human developers, hindering the applicability of LLM agents in domains demanding large numbers of highly specialised tools, like in life sciences and medicine. Motivated by the growing trend of scientific studies accompanied by public code repositories, we propose ToolMaker, an agentic framework that autonomously transforms papers with code into LLM-compatible tools. Given a GitHub URL and short task description, ToolMaker autonomously installs dependencies and generates code to perform the task, using a closed-loop self-correction mechanism for debugging. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a benchmark comprising 15 complex computational tasks spanning various domains with over 100 unit tests to assess correctness and robustness. Our method correctly implements... | Georg Wölflein, Dyke Ferber, Daniel Truhn, Ognjen Arandjelovic, Jakob Nikolas Kather |  |

Despite extensive research in this area, most studies are conducted in static environments with simple instructions and a limited vocabulary, making it difficult to assess agent performance in more diverse and challenging settings. To address this gap, we introduce CrafText, a benchmark for evaluating instruction following in a multimodal environment with diverse instructions and dynamic interactions. CrafText includes 3,924 instructions with 3,423 unique words, covering Localization, Conditional, Building, and Achievement tasks. Additionally, we propose an evaluation protocol that measures an agent’s ability to generalize to novel instruction formulations and dynamically evolving task... | Zoya Volovikova, Gregory Gorbov, Petr Kuderov, Aleksandr Panov, Alexey Skrynnik |  |

In this work, we introduce test item analysis, a method frequently used by educators to assess test question quality, into QG evaluation. Specifically, we construct pairs of candidate questions that differ in quality across dimensions such as topic coverage, item difficulty, item discrimination, and distractor efficiency. We then examine whether existing QG evaluation approaches can effectively distinguish these differences. Our findings reveal significant shortcomings in these approaches with respect to accurately assessing test item quality in relation to student performance. To address this gap, we propose a novel QG evaluation framework, QG-SMS, which leverages Large Language Model for Student Modeling and Simulation to perform test item analysis. As demonstrated in our... | Bang Nguyen, Tingting Du, Mengxia Yu, Lawrence Angrave, Meng Jiang |  |

But event reasoning remains a difficult challenge, and despite recent advances, Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle to accurately identify causal connections between events. This struggle leads to poor performance on deeper reasoning tasks like event forecasting and timeline understanding. To address this challenge, we investigate the generation of causal event graphs (e.g., A enables B) as a parallel mechanism to help LLMs explicitly represent causality during inference. This paper evaluates both how to generate correct graphs as well as how graphs can assist reasoning. We propose a collaborative approach to causal graph generation where we use LLMs to simulate experts that focus on specific semantic relations. The experts engage in multiple rounds of discussions which are then consolidated by a final expert. Then, to demonstrate the... | Mahnaz Koupaee, Xueying Bai, Mudan Chen, Greg Durrett, Nathanael Chambers, Niranjan Balasubramanian |  |

First, we synthesize complex reasoning problems through source algorithm problems and test cases. Then, standard answers and intermediate variable outputs are obtained for each problem based on standard python solutions and test cases. Finally, with the guidance of code intermediate variables, we synthesize the text reasoning process for each reasoning problems. Through this method, we can synthesize data that is difficult, scalable, effective, and comes with golden standard answers and high-quality reasoning processes. As a result, with our 540K synthesized dataset constructed solely from 2,360 algorithm problems, our approach achieves significant improvements in multiple models for the datasets BBH^27, LogicBench, DROP, AR-LSAT, and GSM8K, etc. outperforming a... | Jin Jiang, Yuchen Yan, Yang Liu, Jianing Wang, Shuai Peng, Xunliang Cai, Yixin Cao, Mengdi Zhang, Liangcai Gao |  |

A Case Study on Dialogue Acts](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.1271/) |  | 0 | Recent advancements in NLP, largely driven by Large Language Models (LLMs), have significantly improved performance on an array of tasks. However, Dialogue Act (DA) classification remains challenging, particularly in the fine-grained 50-class, multiparty setting. This paper investigates the root causes of LLMs’ poor performance in DA classification through a linguistically motivated analysis. We identify three key pre-tasks essential for accurate DA prediction: Turn Management, Communicative Function Identification, and Dialogue Structure Prediction. Our experiments reveal that LLMs struggle with these fundamental tasks, often failing to outperform simple rule-based baselines. Additionally, we establish a strong empirical correlation between errors in these pre-tasks and DA classification failures. A human study further highlights the significant gap between LLM and human-level dialogue understanding. These findings indicate that LLMs’ shortcomings in dialogue comprehension hinder... | Ayesha Qamar, Jonathan Tong, Ruihong Huang |  |

However most recent works rarely engage with the communities they study, and instead rely on synthetic setups and imperfect proxies of culture. In this work, we take a human-centered approach to discover and measure language-based cultural norms, and cultural competence of LLMs. We focus on a single kind of culture, \*research cultures\*, and a single task, \*adapting writing across research cultures\*. Through a set of interviews with interdisciplinary researchers, who are experts at moving between cultures, we create a framework of structural, stylistic, rhetorical, and citational norms that vary across research cultures. We operationalise these features with a suite of computational metrics and use them for (a) surfacing latent cultural norms in human-written research papers at scale; and (b) highlighting the lack of cultural competence of LLMs, and their tendency to homogenize writing. Overall, our work... | Shaily Bhatt, Tal August, Maria Antoniak |  |

Both aspects reflect essay quality from different perspectives, and they are inherently consistent and can reinforce each other. In this paper, we propose a novel bidirectional reinforcement learning framework that effectively utilizes this consistency constraint to jointly optimize score prediction and feedback generation, ensuring mutual reinforcement and alignment between them. In this way, our model is hope to obtain a simultaneous accurate ratings and consistent text feedback. We conducted extensive experiments on publicly available datasets. The results demonstrate that our approach surpasses the current state-of-the-art models, enhancing both scoring accuracy and feedback quality. | Xia Li, Wenjing Pan |  |

Current work focuses on alignment at model training time, through techniques such as Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). However, it is unclear if such methods are an effective choice to teach alignment objectives to the model. First, the inability to incorporate multiple, custom rewards and reliance on a model developer’s view of universal and static principles are key limitations. Second, the reliability of such approaches is also questionable (e.g. susceptibility to jailbreaking even after safety training). To address these issues, we propose DeAL, a framework that allows the user to customize reward functions and enables Decoding-time Alignment of LLMs (DeAL). At its core, we view decoding as a heuristic-guided search process and facilitate the use of a wide variety of alignment objectives. Our experiments with programmatic constraints such as keyword and length... | James Y.

Previous research on automatic metaphor processing predominantly relies on training data consisting of English samples, which often reflect Western European or North American biases. This cultural skew can lead to an overestimation of model performance and contributions to NLP progress. However, the impact of cultural bias on metaphor processing, particularly in multimodal contexts, remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce MultiMM, a Multicultural Multimodal Metaphor dataset designed for cross-cultural studies of metaphor in Chinese and English. MultiMM consists of 8,461 text-image advertisement pairs, each accompanied by fine-grained annotations, providing a deeper understanding of multimodal metaphors beyond a single cultural domain. Additionally, we propose Sentiment-Enriched Metaphor Detection (SEMD), a baseline model that integrates sentiment embeddings to... | Senqi Yang, Dongyu Zhang, Jing Ren, Ziqi Xu, Xiuzhen Zhang, Yiliao Song, Hongfei Lin, Feng Xia |  |

However, existing methods primarily focus on mimicking dialogues among roles in textual form, neglecting the role’s voice traits (e.g., voice style and emotions) as playing a crucial effect in interaction, which tends to be more immersive experiences in realistic scenarios. Towards this goal, we propose OmniCharacter, a first seamless speech-language personality interaction model to achieve immersive RPAs with low latency. Specifically, OmniCharacter enables agents to consistently exhibit role-specific personality traits and vocal traits throughout the interaction, enabling a mixture of speech and language responses. To align the model with speech-language scenarios, we construct a dataset named OmniCharacter-10K, which involves more distinctive characters (20), richly contextualized multi-round dialogue (10K), and... | Haonan Zhang, Run Luo, Xiong Liu, Yuchuan Wu, TingEn Lin, Pengpeng Zeng, Qiang Qu, Feiteng Fang, Min Yang, Lianli Gao, Jingkuan Song, Fei Huang, Yongbin Li |  |

We propose Mixtures of In-Context Learners (MoICL), a novel approach that uses subsets of demonstrations to train a set of experts via ICL and learns a weighting function to merge their output distributions via gradient-based optimisation. In our experiments, we show performance improvements on 5 out of 7 classification datasets compared to a set of strong baselines (e.g., up to +13% compared to ICL and LENS). Moreover, we improve the Pareto frontier of ICL by reducing the inference time needed to achieve the same performance with fewer demonstrations. Finally, MoICL is more robust to out-of-domain (up to +11%), imbalanced (up to +49%) and perturbed demonstrations (up to +38%). | Giwon Hong, Emile van Krieken, Edoardo Maria Ponti, Nikolay Malkin, Pasquale Minervini |  |

Considering the strong dependency of the candidate next tokens on different prefixes, recent studies propose to adaptively truncate the tail of LLMs’ predicted distribution. Although improved results have been reported with these methods on open-ended text generation tasks, the results are highly dependent on the curated parameters and the limited exemplar text. In this paper, we propose a systematic way to estimate the intrinsic capacity of a truncation sampling method by considering the trade-off between diversity and risk at each decoding step, based on our collected prefix tree which preserves the context of a full sentence. Our work offers a comprehensive comparison of existing truncation sampling methods and serves as a practical user guideline for their parameter... | Yuxuan Zhou, Margret Keuper, Mario Fritz |  |

Previous approaches have attempted to utilize multimodal LLMs for this task, enhancing their performance through the integration of domain-specific knowledge retrieval. However, these approaches often overlook the knowledge already embedded within the LLMs, leading to redundant information integration. To address this limitation, we propose Radar, a framework for enhancing radiology report generation with supplementary knowledge injection. Radar improves report generation by systematically leveraging both the internal knowledge of an LLM and externally retrieved information. Specifically, it first extracts the model’s acquired knowledge that aligns with expert image-based classification outputs. It then retrieves relevant supplementary knowledge to further enrich this information. Finally, by aggregating both sources, Radar generates more accurate and... | Wenjun Hou, Yi Cheng, Kaishuai Xu, Heng Li, Yan Hu, Wenjie Li, Jiang Liu |  |

Benchmarking Adversarial Compositionality of Pre-trained Multimodal Representation via Text Updates](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.1280/) |  | 0 | While pre-trained multimodal representations (e.g., CLIP) have shown impressive capabilities, they exhibit significant compositional vulnerabilities leading to counterintuitive judgments. We introduce Multimodal Adversarial Compositionality (MAC), a benchmark that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate deceptive text samples to exploit these vulnerabilities across different modalities and evaluates them through both sample-wise attack success rate and group-wise entropy-based diversity. To improve zero-shot methods, we propose a self-training approach that leverages rejection-sampling fine-tuning with diversity-promoting filtering, which enhances both attack success rate and sample diversity. Using smaller language models like Llama-3.1-8B, our approach demonstrates superior performance in revealing compositional vulnerabilities across various multimodal representations, including images, videos, and audios. | Jaewoo Ahn, Heeseung Yun, Dayoon Ko, Gunhee Kim |  |

To this end, we first introduce a metric to quantify the “entity preference” of an LLM. We then propose ATLAS, a technique to localize bias to specific layers of the LLM by analyzing attention scores and then reduce bias by scaling attention in these biased layers. To evaluate our method, we conduct extensive experiments across 3 datasets, 4 models, and 4 baseline approaches. Our experiments demonstrate that bias is concentrated in the later layers, typically around the last third. We also show how ATLAS effectively mitigates bias through targeted interventions without compromising downstream performance and an average increase of only 0.34% in perplexity when the intervention is applied. We see an average... | Rishabh Adiga, Besmira Nushi, Varun Chandrasekaran |  |

However, in multi-round dialogues, malicious intentions may be hidden in interactions, leading LLMs to be more prone to produce harmful responses. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Turn Safety Alignment (MTSA) framework, to address the challenge of securing LLMs in multi-round interactions. It consists of two stages: In the thought-guided attack learning stage, the red-team model learns about thought-guided multi-round jailbreak attacks to generate adversarial prompts. In the adversarial iterative optimization stage, the red-team model and the target model continuously improve their respective capabilities in interaction. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-turn reinforcement learning algorithm based on future rewards to enhance the robustness of safety alignment. Experimental results show that the red-team model exhibits state-of-the-art attack capabilities,... | Weiyang Guo, Jing Li, Wenya Wang, Yu Li, Daojing He, Jun Yu, Min Zhang |  |

This paper introduces OptiRAG-Rec, a comprehensive framework that integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a novel multi-head early exit architecture to address both challenges. By leveraging Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) as efficient retrieval mechanisms, the framework significantly reduces data retrieval times while maintaining high model performance. Additionally, the multi-head early exit strategy dynamically terminates inference based on real-time predictive confidence assessments, enhancing responsiveness without sacrificing accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that OptiRAG-Rec reduces computation time while preserving the precision required for reliable recommendations, establishing a new benchmark for efficient and accurate LLM deployment in recommendation. | Huixue Zhou, Hengrui Gu, Zaifu Zhan, Xi Liu, Kaixiong Zhou, Yongkang Xiao, Mingfu Liang, Srinivas Prasad Govindan, Piyush Chawla, Jiyan Yang, Xiangfei Meng, Huayu Li, Buyun Zhang, Liang Luo, WenYen Chen, Yiping Han, Bo Long, Rui Zhang, Tianlong Chen |  |

Recent works explore model merging to combine multiple task-specific models into a single multi-task model without additional training. However, existing merging methods often fail for models fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation (LoRA), due to significant performance degradation. In this paper, we show that this issue arises from a previously overlooked interplay between model parameters and data distributions. We propose \*\*O\*\*rthogonal \*\*S\*\*ubspaces for \*\*R\*\*obust model \*\*M\*\*erging (\*\*OSRM\*\*) to constrain the LoRA subspace \*prior\* to fine-tuning, ensuring that updates relevant to one task do not adversely shift outputs for others.

One particular exception is the BIG-Bench dataset, which has served as a crucial benchmark for evaluating the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs, thanks to its diverse set of challenging tasks that allowed for a comprehensive assessment of general reasoning across various skills within a unified framework. However, recent advances in LLMs have led to saturation on BIG-Bench, and its harder version BIG-Bench Hard (BBH). State-of-the-art models achieve near-perfect scores on many tasks in BBH, thus diminishing its utility. To address this limitation, we introduce BIG-Bench Extra Hard (BBEH), a new benchmark designed to push the boundaries of LLM reasoning evaluation. BBEH replaces each task in BBH with a novel task that probes a similar reasoning capability but exhibits significantly increased difficulty.... | Mehran Kazemi, Bahare Fatemi, Hritik Bansal, John Palowitch, Chrysovalantis Anastasiou, Sanket Vaibhav Mehta, Lalit K.

However, their performance significantly declines when applied to multi-turn QA over extra-long context (ELC), as they struggle to capture the logical correlations across multiple chunks of ELC and maintain the coherence of multi-turn Questions. To address the challenges, we propose the CSTree-SRI framework (Cognitive Semantic Tree through Summarization, Retrieval, and Introspection). CSTree-SRI dynamically constructs the CSTree to preserve logical coherence within ELC through hierarchical synthesis and introspective validation. Then a logic-driven traversal strategy on CSTree is designed to provide efficient information retrieval for question answering. Additionally, we construct a suite of multi-turn QA datasets and an evaluation benchmark tailored for ELC tasks, and comprehensive experiments demonstrate the... | Zhaowen Wang, Xiang Wei, Kangshao Du, Yiting Zhang, Libo Qin, Yingjie Xia, Li Kuang |  |

However, a majority of these benchmarks emphasize deductive reasoning, including mathematical and coding tasks in which rules such as mathematical axioms or programming syntax are clearly defined, based on which LLMs can plan and apply these rules to arrive at a solution. In contrast, inductive reasoning, where one infers the underlying rules from observed data, remains less explored. Such inductive processes lie at the heart of scientific discovery, as they enable researchers to extract general principles from empirical observations. To assess whether LLMs possess this capacity, we introduce InductionBench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the inductive reasoning ability of LLMs. Our experimental findings reveal that even the most advanced modelw available struggle to master the simplest complexity... | Wenyue Hua, Tyler Wong, Fei Sun, Liangming Pan, Adam Jardine, William Yang Wang |  |

To address this challenge, we introduce RATIONALYST, a model for process-supervision of reasoning based on pre-training on a vast collection of rationale annotations extracted from unlabeled data. We extract 79k rationales from web-scale unlabelled dataset (the Pile) and a combination of reasoning datasets with minimal human intervention. This web-scale pre-training for reasoning allows RATIONALYST to consistently generalize across diverse reasoning tasks, including mathematical, commonsense, scientific, and logical reasoning. Fine-tuned from LLaMa-3-8B, RATIONALYST improves the accuracy of reasoning by an average of 3.9% on 7 representative reasoning benchmarks. It also demonstrates superior performance compared to significantly larger verifiers like GPT-4 and similarly... | Dongwei Jiang, Guoxuan Wang, Yining Lu, Andrew Wang, Jingyu Zhang, Chuyu Liu, Benjamin Van Durme, Daniel Khashabi |  |

Stable Diffusion-based Visual Imagination for Multimodal Machine Translation](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.1289/) |  | 0 | Visual information has been introduced for enhancing machine translation (MT), and its effectiveness heavily relies on the availability of large amounts of bilingual parallel sentence pairs with manual image annotations. In this paper, we introduce a stable diffusion-based imagination network into a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to explicitly generate an image for each source sentence, thereby advancing the multimodel MT. Particularly, we build heuristic feedback with reinforcement learning to ensure the consistency of the generated image with the source sentence without the supervision of visual information, which breaks the high-cost bottleneck of image annotation in MT. Furthermore, the proposed method enables imaginative visual information to be integrated into text-only MT in addition to multimodal MT. Experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms existing multimodal MT and text-only MT, especially achieving an average improvement of more than 14... | Andong Chen, Yuchen Song, Kehai Chen, Xuefeng Bai, Muyun Yang, Liqiang Nie, Jie Liu, Tiejun Zhao, Min Zhang |  |

However, the more practical and challenging Domain-incremental CIT, focused on the continual adaptation of MLLMs to new domains, remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a new Sparse Mixture of Expert (SMoE) based method for domain-incremental CIT in MLLMs. During training, we learn a domain-specific SMoE module for each new domain in every FFN sub-layer of MLLMs, preventing catastrophic forgetting caused by inter-domain conflicts. Moreover, we equip the SMoE module with a domain-specific autoregressive loss (DSAL), which is used to identify the most suitable SMoE module for processing each test instruction during inference. To further enhance the SMoE module’s ability to learn domain knowledge, we design an adaptive threshold-based router (AT-Router) that allocates... | Liang Zhang, Ziyao Lu, Fandong Meng, Hui Li, Jie Zhou, Jinsong Su |  |

Most previous work focused on detecting media bias. In this paper, we aim to mitigate media bias by generating a neutralized summary given multiple articles presenting different ideological views. Motivated by the critical role of events and event relations in media bias detection, we propose to increase awareness of bias in LLMs via multi-document events reasoning and use a multi-document event relation graph to guide the summarization process. This graph contains rich event information useful to reveal bias: four common types of in-doc event relations to reflect content framing bias, cross-doc event coreference relation to reveal content selection bias, and event-level moral opinions to highlight opinionated framing bias. We further develop two strategies to incorporate the multi-document event relation graph for neutralized summarization. Firstly, we convert a graph into natural language descriptions and feed the... | Yuanyuan Lei, Ruihong Huang |  |

However, current approaches largely overlook the influence of author characteristics. We investigate how sociolinguistic attributes—gender, CEFR proficiency, academic field, and language environment—impact state-of-the-art AI text detectors. Using the ICNALE corpus of human-authored texts and parallel AI-generated texts from diverse LLMs, we conduct a rigorous evaluation employing multi-factor ANOVA and weighted least squares (WLS). Our results reveal significant biases: CEFR proficiency and language environment consistently affected detector accuracy, while gender and academic field showed detector-dependent effects. These findings highlight the crucial need for socially aware AI text detection to avoid unfairly penalizing specific demographic groups. We offer novel empirical evidence, a robust statistical framework, and actionable insights for developing more equitable and reliable detection... | Jiatao Li, Xiaojun Wan |  |

Through extensive experiments with medium-sized LMs like RoBERTa and DeBERTa, and larger LMs like Bloom-7B, Llama2-7B, and Llama2-13B, we show that our method gives comparable or better accuracies than state-of-the-art Parameter-Efficient Finetuning methods while also being more memory and computation-efficient. We also study the reason behind the effectiveness of our method with tools from neural tangent kernel theory. We empirically demonstrate that our kernel, constructed using a restricted set of row and column parameters, is numerically close to the full-parameter kernel and gives comparable classification performance. Ablation studies are conducted to investigate the impact of different algorithmic choices, including the robustness of RoCoFT to any selection of rows and columns, as well... | Md.

As the computational power of modern GPU architectures continuously improves, their memory bandwidth and capacity have not scaled proportionally, creating a critical bottleneck during inference. To address this, we investigate ternary language models (TriLMs) that employ quantization-aware training to significantly reduce memory requirements. We first analyze the scalability of TriLMs by conducting a scaling law analysis, revealing that TriLMs benefit more from increasing training data than from scaling model parameters. Based on this observation, we introduce TriTera, an open suite of TriLMs trained on up to 1.2 trillion tokens, demonstrating sustained performance gains at scale. Furthermore, to improve inference efficiency, we propose novel 2-bit and 1.6-bit packing schemes for ternary weights, which demonstrate accelerated... | Tejas Vaidhya, Ayush Kaushal, Vineet Jain, Francis Couture Harpin, Prashant Shishodia, Majid Behbahani, Yuriy Nevmyvaka, Irina Rish |  |

However, this process may increase the model’s dependence on user input, potentially leading to the unfiltered acceptance of misinformation and the generation of hallucinations. Existing studies primarily highlight that LLMs are receptive to external information that contradict their parametric knowledge, but little research has been conducted on the direct impact of instruction-tuning on this phenomenon. In our study, we investigate the impact of instruction-tuning on LLM susceptibility to misinformation. Our analysis reveals that instruction-tuned LLMs are significantly more likely to accept misinformation when it is presented by the user. A comparison with base models shows that instruction-tuning increases reliance on user-provided information, shifting susceptibility from the assistant role to the user role.... | Kyubeen Han, Junseo Jang, Hongjin Kim, Geunyeong Jeong, Harksoo Kim |  |

Despite its cultural and linguistic significance, there has been limited progress in developing a comprehensive corpus to capture these variations for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. In this paper, we present Unggah-Ungguh, a carefully curated dataset designed to encapsulate the nuances of Unggah-Ungguh Basa, the Javanese speech etiquette framework that dictates the choice of words and phrases based on social hierarchy and context. Using Unggah-Ungguh, we assess the ability of language models (LMs) to process various levels of Javanese honorifics through classification and machine translation tasks. To further evaluate cross-lingual LMs, we conduct machine translation experiments between Javanese (at specific honorific levels) and Indonesian. Additionally, we explore whether LMs can generate contextually appropriate Javanese honorifics... | Mohammad Rifqi Farhansyah, Iwan Darmawan, Adryan Kusumawardhana, Genta Indra Winata, Alham Fikri Aji, Derry Tanti Wijaya |  |

Identifying and optimizing unexpected behaviors within these synthesized CoT remains a challenge, as it heavily depends on precise annotations of intermediate behavior, similar to process supervision. In this work, we introduce a criteria-based preference tree for reward modeling, where each path in the tree represents a reasoning trajectory based on synthesized criteria. Crucially, each reasoning trajectory can be independently optimized through RL algorithm. These fine-grained process reward signals are derived from the inference-time computations and predefined rules, eliminating the need for human supervision. In experiments, SyncPL showed significant improvements over baselines on multiple human preference benchmarks. We further demonstrate... | Xiaobo Liang, Haoke Zhang, Juntao Li, Kehai Chen, Qiaoming Zhu, Min Zhang |  |

However, complex tables with hierarchical headers are hard to obtain high-quality textual formats (e.g., Markdown) for input under practical scenarios like webpage screenshots and scanned documents, while table images are more accessible and intuitive. Besides, existing works overlook the need of mining relations among multiple columns rather than just the semantic relation between two specific columns in real-world practice. In this work, we explore utilizing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to address RE in tables with complex structures. We creatively extend the concept of RE to include calculational relations, enabling multi-task learning of both semantic and calculational RE for mutual reinforcement. Specifically, we reconstruct table images into graph structure based on neighboring nodes to extract graph-level visual features. Such feature enhancement... | Xinyu Zhang, Aibo Song, Jingyi Qiu, Jiahui Jin, Tianbo Zhang, Xiaolin Fang |  |

Most existing studies use prototype networks (ProtoNets) for FSRE and assume that the support set, adapting the model to new relations, only contains accurately labeled instances. However, this assumption is usually unrealistic, as even carefully-annotated datasets often contain mislabeled instances. Thus, it is essential to enhance the robustness of FSRE models to noisy labels in support set, but this issue remains unexplored. In this paper, we first conduct a preliminary study, revealing the high sensitivity of ProtoNets to such noisy labels. Meanwhile, we discover that fully leveraging mislabeled support instances is crucial for enhancing the model’s robustness. To do this, we propose a self-denoising model for FSRE, which can automatically correct noisy labels of support instances. Specifically, our model comprises two core... | Liang Zhang, Yang Zhang, Ziyao Lu, Fandong Meng, Jie Zhou, Jinsong Su |  |

Unlike traditional text generation tasks, it requires models to accurately understand and represent table structures. Existing approaches typically process tables by linearizing them or converting them into graph structures. However, these methods either fail to adequately capture the table structure or rely on complex attention mechanisms, limiting their applicability. To tackle these challenges, we propose QuASAR, a question-driven self-supervised approach designed to enhance the model’s structural perception and representation capabilities. Specifically, QuASAR formulates a set of structure-related queries for self-supervised training, explicitly guiding the model to capture both local and global table structures. Additionally, we introduce two auxiliary pre-training tasks: a word-to-sentence reconstruction task and a numerical summarization task,... | WeiJie Liu, Yibin Zheng, Fang Kong |  |

However, most datasets, including the publicly available MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus, consist entirely of free-form reports, which are inherently variable and unstructured. This variability poses challenges for both generation and evaluation: existing models struggle to produce consistent, clinically meaningful reports, and standard evaluation metrics fail to capture the nuances of radiological interpretation. To address this, we introduce Structured Radiology Report Generation (SRRG), a new task that reformulates free-text radiology reports into a standardized format, ensuring clarity, consistency, and structured clinical reporting. We create a novel dataset by restructuring reports using large language models (LLMs) following strict structured reporting desiderata. Additionally, we introduce SRR-BERT, a fine-grained disease... | JeanBenoit Delbrouck, Justin Xu, Johannes Moll, Alois Thomas, Zhihong Chen, Sophie Ostmeier, Asfandyar Azhar, Kelvin Zhenghao Li, Andrew Johnston, Christian Bluethgen, Eduardo Pontes Reis, Mohamed S.

Although augmenting negative image samples partially addresses these pitfalls, no prior work has employed listwise preference optimization for VLMs, due to the complexity and cost of constructing listwise image samples. In this work, we propose LPOI, the first object-aware listwise preference optimization developed for reducing hallucinations in VLMs. LPOI identifies and masks a critical object in the image, and then interpolates the masked region between the positive and negative images to form a sequence of incrementally more complete images. The model is trained to rank these images in ascending order of object visibility, effectively reducing hallucinations while retaining visual fidelity. LPOI requires no extra annotations beyond standard pairwise preference data, as it automatically constructs the ranked lists through... | Fatemeh Pesaran Zadeh, Yoojin Oh, Gunhee Kim |  |
| 2791 |  |  [Predicting Through Generation: Why Generation Is Better for Prediction](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.1303/) |  | 0 | This paper argues that generating output tokens is more effective than using pooled representations for prediction tasks because token-level generation retains more mutual information. Since LLMs are trained on massive text corpora using next-token prediction, generation aligns naturally with their learned behavior. Using the Data Processing Inequality (DPI), we provide both theoretical and empirical evidence supporting this claim. However, autoregressive models face two key challenges when used for prediction: (1) exposure bias, where the model sees ground-truth tokens during training but relies on its own predictions during inference, leading to errors, and (2) format mismatch, where discrete tokens do not always align with the task’s required output structure. To address these challenges, we introduce PredGen (Predicting Through Generating), an end-to-end framework that (i) uses scheduled sampling to reduce exposure bias, and (ii) introduces a task adapter to convert the generated... | Md.

Accuracy-Performance Trade-Offs in LLM Quantization](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.1304/) |  | 0 | Despite the popularity of large language model (LLM) quantization for inference acceleration, significant uncertainty remains regarding the accuracy-performance trade-offs associated with various quantization formats. We present a comprehensive empirical study of quantized accuracy, evaluating popular quantization formats (FP8, INT8, INT4) across academic benchmarks and real-world tasks, on the entire Llama-3.1 model family. Additionally, our study examines the difference in text generated by quantized models versus their uncompressed counterparts. Beyond benchmarks, we also present a couple of quantization improvements which allowed us to obtain state-of-the-art accuracy recovery results. Our investigation, encompassing over 500,000 individual evaluations, yields several key findings: (1) FP8 weight and activation quantization (W8A8-FP) is lossless across all model scales, (2) INT8 weight and activation quantization (W8A8-INT), when properly tuned, incurs surprisingly low 1-3%... | Eldar Kurtic, Alexandre Noll Marques, Shubhra Pandit, Mark Kurtz, Dan Alistarh |  |

However, the increasing computational demands and inference costs of these models present significant challenges. This study investigates the dynamic and efficient utilization of pre-trained weights from open-sourced LLMs of varying parameter sizes to achieve an optimal balance between computational efficiency and task performance. Drawing inspiration from the dual-process theory of human cognition, we introduce StitchLLM: a dynamic model routing framework that employs a powerful bottom model to process all queries, and uses a lightweight routing mechanism to allocate computational resources appropriately. Our novel framework optimizes efficiency and maintains performance, leveraging a trainable stitching layer for seamless integration of decoder layers across different LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that... | Bodun Hu, Shuozhe Li, Saurabh Agarwal, Myungjin Lee, Akshay Jajoo, Jiamin Li, Le Xu, GeonWoo Kim, Donghyun Kim, Hong Xu, Amy Zhang, Aditya Akella |  |

Thus, we introduce a human-centric visual grounding task and a dataset to evaluate this ability. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have shown potential for inferring others’ perspectives, yet are insensitive to information differences induced by slight perspective changes. To address this problem, we propose a top-view enhanced perspective transformation (TEP) method, which decomposes the transition from robot to human perspectives through an abstract top-view representation. It unifies perspectives and facilitates the capture of information differences from diverse perspectives. Experimental results show that TEP improves performance by up to 18%, exhibits perspective-taking abilities across various perspectives, and generalizes effectively to robotic and dynamic scenarios. | Yuqi Bu, Xin Wu, Zirui Zhao, Yi Cai, David Hsu, Qiong Liu |  |

Researchers have seen surprising success from simple methods, such as random perturbations from natural examples, where models seem to benefit even from data with nonsense words, or data that doesn’t conform to the rules of the language. A second line of research produces synthetic data that does in fact follow all linguistic constraints; these methods require some linguistic expertise and are generally more challenging to implement. No previous work has done a systematic, empirical comparison of both linguistically-naive and linguistically-motivated data augmentation strategies, leaving uncertainty about whether the additional time and effort of linguistically-motivated data augmentation work in fact yields better downstream performance.In this work, we conduct a careful and comprehensive comparison of... | Ray Groshan, Michael Ginn, Alexis Palmer |  |

We observe that many widely-used preference models—including human evaluators, GPT-4, and top-ranking models on the RewardBench benchmark—exhibit strong biases towards specific format patterns, such as lists, links, bold text, and emojis. Furthermore, large language models (LLMs) can exploit these biases to achieve higher rankings on popular benchmarks like AlpacaEval and LMSYS Chatbot Arena. One notable example is verbosity bias, where current preference models favor longer responses that appear more comprehensive, even when their quality is equal to or lower than shorter responses. However, format biases beyond verbosity remain largely underexplored. In this work, we extend the study of biases in preference learning beyond the commonly recognized length bias, offering a comprehensive analysis of a wider range of format biases. Additionally, we show that with a small amount of biased data... | Xuanchang Zhang, Wei Xiong, Lichang Chen, Tianyi Zhou, Heng Huang, Tong Zhang |  |

Style transfer between Singlish and Standard (formal) English is vital for various applications, yet existing methods often lack explainability and fine-grained control. To fill this gap, we contribute in two key ways. First, we construct a large, high-quality dataset of formal and informal sentences, annotated across six linguistic aspects—Syntax, Lexical Borrowing, Pragmatics, Prosody/Phonology, Emoticons/Punctuation, and Code-Switching—with detailed explanations. Starting with manually annotated cases, we scaled the dataset to 140K with ensured quality. Second, inspired by the “Society of Mind” theory, we propose a novel multi-agent framework where large language models (LLMs) act as expert agents for each linguistic aspect. These agents collaborate by iteratively generating, critiquing, and refining responses to achieve controlled,... | Jinggui Liang, Dung Vo, Yap Hong Xian, Hai Leong Chieu, Kian Ming Adam Chai, Jing Jiang, Lizi Liao |  |

These studies have excelled in mathematical competitions like IMO and have made significant progress. However, these studies intertwined multiple skills simultaneously—problem-solving, reasoning, and writing formal specifications—making it hard to precisely identify the LLMs’ strengths and weaknesses in each task. This paper focuses on formal verification, an immediate application scenario of formal reasoning, and breaks it down into sub-tasks. We constructed 18k high-quality instruction-response pairs across five mainstream formal specification languages (Coq, Lean4, Dafny, ACSL, and TLA+) in six tasks by distilling gpt-4o and evaluated against ten open-sourced LLMs, including recent popular DeepSeek-R1. We found that LLMs are good at writing proof segments when given either the code, or the detailed description of proof steps.

It dynamically determines whether LLMs need external knowledge for generation and invokes retrieval accordingly. This paper introduces Self-aware Knowledge Retrieval (SeaKR), a novel adaptive RAG model that extracts self-aware uncertainty of LLMs from their internal states. SeaKR activates retrieval when the LLMs present high self-aware uncertainty for generation. To effectively integrate retrieved knowledge snippets, SeaKR re-ranks them based on LLM’s self-aware uncertainty to preserve the snippet that reduces their uncertainty to the utmost. To facilitate solving complex tasks that require multiple retrievals, SeaKR utilizes their self-aware uncertainty to choose among different reasoning strategies. Our experiments on both complex and simple Question Answering datasets show that SeaKR outperforms existing adaptive RAG methods. | Zijun Yao, Weijian Qi, Liangming Pan, Shulin Cao, Linmei Hu, Weichuan Liu, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li |  |

This work addresses that gap by evaluating LLMs’ abilities to detect and correct reasoning mistakes. We present a novel dataset, MWP-MISTAKE, containing MWPs with both correct and incorrect reasoning steps generated through rule-based methods and smaller language models. Our comprehensive benchmarking of state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o and GPT4 uncovers important insights into their strengths and limitations.

However, recent works show that LLMs’ intrinsic self-correction fails without oracle labels as feedback. In this paper, our research goal is to \*interpret LLMs’ intrinsic self-correction for different tasks, especially for those failure cases.\* By including one simple task and three complex tasks with state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs like ChatGPT, Llama, and DeepSeek, we design three interpretation methods to reveal the dark side of LLMs’ intrinsic self-correction. We identify intrinsic self-correction can (1) cause LLMs to waver both intermedia and final answers and lead to prompt bias on simple factual questions; (2) introduce human-like cognitive bias on complex tasks.

Insights and Best Practices](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.1316/) |  | 0 | Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows have significantly improved various tasks. To improve long-context capabilities, much work focuses on augmenting LLM’s capabilities with synthetic data. Existing methods often leverage the Self-Instruct framework to generate long-context instruction-tuning data. However, our preliminary experiments show that fewer than 35% of samples generated by Qwen-2-72B are multi-hop, and over 40% exhibit poor quality, limiting comprehensive understanding and further research. To address this, we propose the Multi-agent Interactive Multi-hop Generation (MIMG) framework, which integrates a quality verification agent, a single-hop question generation agent, a multiple question sampling strategy, and a multi-hop question merger agent. This framework significantly improves data quality, with high-quality, multi-hop, and diverse data.

However, this part of knowledge can be useful to advanced users whose expertise qualifies them to handle these information. The one-size-fits-all alignment mechanism undermines LLM’s utility for these qualified users. To address this problem, we propose SudoLM, a framework that lets LLMs learn access control over specific parametric knowledge for users with different credentials via authorization alignment. SudoLM allows authorized users to unlock their access to all the parametric knowledge with an assigned Sudo key while blocking access to non-qualified users. Experiments on two application scenarios demonstrate that SudoLM effectively controls the user’s access to the parametric knowledge and maintains its general utility. | Qin Liu, Fei Wang, Chaowei Xiao, Muhao Chen |  |

However, recent works extending CLIP suffer from the issue of \*modality gap\*, which arises when the image and text embeddings are projected to disparate manifolds, deviating from the intended objective of image-text contrastive learning. We discover that this phenomenon is linked to the modality-specific characteristic that each image or text encoder independently possesses. Herein, we propose two methods to address the modality gap: (1) a post-hoc embedding standardization method, I0Tpost that reduces the modality gap approximately to zero and (2) a trainable method, I0Tasync, to alleviate the modality gap problem by adding two normalization layers for each encoder. Our I0T framework can significantly reduce the modality gap while preserving the original embedding representations of trained models with their locked parameters.

However, current stochastic decoding methods struggle to balance such objectives. We introduce Dynamic Focus Decoding (DFD), a novel plug-and-play stochastic approach that resolves this trade-off without requiring additional data, knowledge, or models. DFD adaptively adjusts the decoding focus based on distributional differences across layers, leveraging the modular and hierarchical nature of factual knowledge within LLMs. This dynamic adjustment improves factuality in knowledge-intensive decoding steps and promotes diversity in less knowledge-reliant steps. DFD can be easily integrated with existing decoding methods, enhancing both factuality and diversity with minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments across seven datasets demonstrate that DFD significantly improves performance, providing a scalable and efficient... | Wen Luo, Feifan Song, Wei Li, Guangyue Peng, Shaohang Wei, Houfeng Wang |  |

In this paper, we argue that the second moment in Adam is a cause of anisotropic embeddings, and suggest a modified optimizer called Coupled Adam to mitigate the problem. Our experiments demonstrate that Coupled Adam significantly improves the quality of embeddings, while also leading to better upstream and downstream performance on large enough datasets. | Felix Stollenwerk, Tobias Stollenwerk |  |

A key challenge in current research is how to achieve controllable multi-objective generation while enabling rapid adaptation to accommodate diverse user demands during test time. Existing solutions, such as Rewarded Soup, focus on merging language models individually tuned on single objectives. While easy to implement and widely used, these approaches face limitations in achieving optimal performance due to their disregard for the impacts of competing objectives on model tuning. To address this issue, we propose \*\*Bone Soup\*\*, a novel model merging approach that first seeks a series of back\*\*bone\*\* models by considering the impacts of multiple objectives and then makes the \*\*soup\*\* (i.e., merge the backbone models). Specifically, Bone Soup begins by training multiple backbone models for different objectives using multi-objective reinforcement learning.

However, existing conversational agents implemented with LLMs often struggle with hallucination, following instructions with conditional logic, and integrating knowledge from different sources. These shortcomings compromise the agents’ effectiveness, rendering them unsuitable for deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce Genie, a programmable framework for creating knowledge-intensive task-oriented conversational agents that handle involved interactions and answer complex queries. Unlike LLMs, Genie delivers reliable, grounded responses through advanced dialogue state management and supports controllable agent policies via its declarative specification – Genie Worksheet. This is achieved through an algorithmic runtime system that implements the developer-supplied policy, limiting LLMs to (1) parse user input using a succinct... | Harshit Joshi, Shicheng Liu, James Chen, Larsen Weigle, Monica S.

However, progress in this critical domain remains hampered by a fundamental limitation: the absence of a rigorous evaluation framework for long code understanding. To gap this obstacle, we propose a long code understanding benchmark LongCodeU from four aspects (8 tasks) to evaluate LCLMs’ long code understanding ability required for practical applications, including code unit perception, intra-code unit understanding, inter-code unit relation understanding, and long code documentation understanding. We evaluate 9 popular LCLMs on LongCodeU (i.e., 6 general models and 3 code models). Our experimental results reveal key limitations in current LCLMs’ capabilities for long code understanding. Particularly, the performance of LCLMs drops dramatically when the long code length is greater than 32K, falling far short of their claimed 128K to 1M context windows.

However, unidirectional and bidirectional models are typically trained separately with distinct objectives (generation and representation learning). This separation overlooks the opportunity for developing a more versatile language model and for these objectives to complement each other. In this work, we propose MAGNET, a method for adapting decoder-only LLMs to generate robust representations and infill missing text spans. MAGNET employs three self-supervised training objectives and introduces an attention mechanism that combines bidirectional and causal attention, enabling unified training across all objectives. Our results demonstrate that LLMs adapted with MAGNET (1) surpass strong text encoders on token-level and sentence-level representation learning tasks, (2) generate contextually appropriate text infills by... | Savya Khosla, Aditi Tiwari, Kushal Kafle, Simon Jenni, Handong Zhao, John P.

In this paper, we introduce a Controlled Value Vector Activation (ConVA) method that directly aligns the internal values of LLMs by interpreting how a value is encoded in their latent representations and modifies relevant activations to ensure consistent values in LLMs. To ensure an accurate and unbiased interpretation, we propose a context-controlled value vector identification method. To consistently control values without sacrificing model performance, we introduce a gated value vector activation method for effective and minimum degree of value control. Experiments show that our method achieves the highest control success rate across 10 basic values without hurting LLM performance and fluency, and ensures target values even with opposite and potentially malicious input prompts.

However, we identify some limitations in traditional NLG meta-evaluation approaches, such as issues in handling human ratings and ambiguous selections of correlation measures, which undermine the effectiveness of meta-evaluation. In this work, we propose a dual-perspective NLG meta-evaluation framework that focuses on different evaluation capabilities, thereby providing better interpretability. In addition, we introduce a method of automatically constructing the corresponding benchmarks without requiring new human annotations. Furthermore, we conduct experiments with 16 representative LLMs as the evaluators based on our proposed framework, comprehensively analyzing their evaluation performance from different perspectives. | Xinyu Hu, Mingqi Gao, Li Lin, Zhenghan Yu, Xiaojun Wan |  |

While recent model ensemble and model merging methods guided by parameter importance have gained popularity, they often struggle to balance knowledge transfer and forgetting, mainly due to the reliance on static importance estimates during sequential training. In this paper, we present Recurrent-KIF, a novel CL framework for Recurrent Knowledge Identification and Fusion, which enables dynamic estimation of parameter importance distributions to enhance knowledge transfer. Inspired by human continual learning, Recurrent-KIF employs an inner loop that rapidly adapts to new tasks while identifying important parameters, coupled with an outer loop that globally manages the fusion of new and historical knowledge through redundant knowledge pruning and key knowledge merging. These inner-outer loops iteratively perform multiple rounds of fusion, allowing... | Yujie Feng, Xujia Wang, Zexin Lu, Shenghong Fu, Guangyuan Shi, Yongxin Xu, Yasha Wang, Philip S.

The increasing generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have made synthetic datasets a viable path forward. In this study, we domain-adapt LLMs to the clinical domain and generate synthetic clinical texts that are machine-annotated with tags for personally identifiable information using capable encoder-based NER models. The synthetic corpora are then used to train synthetic NER models. The results show that training NER models using synthetic corpora incurs only a small drop in predictive performance. The limits of this process are investigated in a systematic ablation study — using both Swedish and Spanish data. Our analysis shows that smaller datasets can be sufficient for domain-adapting LLMs for data synthesis. Instead, the effectiveness of this process is almost entirely contingent on the performance of the machine-annotating NER models trained using the... | Thomas Vakili, Aron Henriksson, Hercules Dalianis |  |

Identifying self-harm intent aids suicide prevention by enabling timely responses, but current large language models (LLMs) struggle to interpret implicit cues in casual language and emojis. This work enhances LLMs’ comprehension of self-harm by distinguishing intent through nuanced language–emoji interplay. We present the Centennial Emoji Sensitivity Matrix (CESM-100)—a curated set of 100 emojis with contextual self-harm interpretations—and the Self-Harm Identification aNd intent Extraction with Supportive emoji sensitivity (SHINES) dataset, offering detailed annotations for self-harm labels, casual mentions (CMs), and serious intents (SIs). Our unified framework:a) enriches inputs using CESM-100;b) fine-tunes LLMs for multi-task learning—self-harm detection (primary) and CM/SI span detection... | Soumitra Ghosh, Gopendra Vikram Singh, Shambhavi, Sabarna Choudhury, Asif Ekbal |  |

We investigate automatic treebank generation by large language models (LLMs) in this paper. The performance of LLMs on constituency parsing is poor, therefore we propose a novel treebank generation method, LLM back generation, which is similar to the reverse process of constituency parsing. LLM back generation takes the incomplete cross-domain constituency tree with only domain keyword leaf nodes as input and fills the missing words to generate the cross-domain constituency treebank. Besides, we also introduce a span-level contrastive learning pre-training strategy to make full use of the LLM back generation treebank for cross-domain constituency parsing. We verify the effectiveness of our LLM back generation treebank coupled with contrastive learning pre-training on five target domains of MCTB. Experimental results show that... | Peiming Guo, Meishan Zhang, Jianling Li, Min Zhang, Yue Zhang |  |

Due to limitations in performance and training efficiency, vanilla spiking neurons face significant challenges in modeling long sequences. In terms of performance, the oversimplified dynamics of spiking neurons omit long-term temporal dependencies. Additionally, the long-tail membrane potential distribution and binary activation discretization errors further limit their capacity to model long sequences. In terms of efficiency, the serial mechanism of spiking neurons leads to excessively long training times for long sequences. Though parallel spiking neurons are an efficient solution, their number of parameters is often tied to the hidden dimension or sequence length, which makes current parallel neurons unsuitable for large architectures. To address these issues, we propose \*\*MMDEND\*\*: a Multi-Branch Multi-Compartment Parallel Spiking... | Kexin Wang, Yuhong Chou, Di Shang, Shijie Mei, Jiahong Zhang, Yanbin Huang, Man Yao, Bo Xu, Guoqi Li |  |

However, human feedback can often be noisy, inconsistent, or biased, especially when evaluating complex responses. Such feedback can lead to misaligned reward signals, potentially causing unintended side effects during the RLHF process. To address these challenges, we explore the use of influence functions to measure the impact of human feedback on the performance of reward models. We propose a compute-efficient approximation method that enables the application of influence functions to LLM-based reward models and large-scale preference datasets. Our experiments showcase two key applications of influence functions: (1) detecting common labeler biases in human feedback datasets and (2) guiding labelers in refining their strategies to better align with expert feedback. By quantifying the impact of human... | Taywon Min, Haeone Lee, Yongchan Kwon, Kimin Lee |  |

In this work, we present T2I-FactualBench—the largest benchmark to date in terms of the number of concepts and prompts specifically designed to evaluate the factuality of knowledge-intensive concept generation. T2I-FactualBench consists of a three-tiered knowledge-intensive text-to-image generation framework, ranging from the basic memorization of individual knowledge concepts to the more complex composition of multiple knowledge concepts. We further introduce a multi-round visual question answering (VQA)-based evaluation framework to assesses the factuality of three-tiered knowledge-intensive text-to-image generation tasks.

However, existing LLM-based debating systems focus on responding to specific arguments while neglecting objective assessments such as authenticity and logical validity. Furthermore, these systems lack a structured approach to optimize across various dimensions—including evaluation metrics, chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, and multi-turn debate refinement—thereby limiting their effectiveness. To address these interconnected challenges, we propose a dual-component framework: (1) InspireScore, a novel evaluation system that establishes a multi-dimensional assessment architecture incorporating four subjective criteria (emotional appeal, argument clarity, argument arrangement, and topic relevance) alongside two objective metrics (fact authenticity and logical validity); and (2) InspireDebate, an optimized debating... | Fuyu Wang, Jiangtong Li, Kun Zhu, Changjun Jiang |  |

Recent efforts have also tried to equip the agent with the ability to explore environments and continuously improve over time. However, existing works only focused on building text-only agents in synthetic environments where the reward signals are clearly defined. Such agents can hardly generalize to realistic settings that require multimodal perception ability and provide no ground-truth signal. In this paper, we introduce an innovative multimodal web agent that can autonomously conduct real-world exploration and improve itself. We first train the base model with imitation learning to gain the basic abilities. We then let the agent explore the open web and collect feedback on its trajectories. After that, it further improves its policy by learning from well-performing trajectories judged by another general-purpose model.

This ability, however, may not be as developed in recent pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs). In this paper, we introduce a novel probing dataset called FOCUS to evaluate whether state-of-the-art VLMs have this ability. FOCUS consists of underspecified sentences paired with image contexts and carefully designed probing questions. Our experiments reveal that VLMs still fall short in handling underspecification even when visual inputs that can help resolve the ambiguities are available. To further support research in underspecification, FOCUS will be released for public use. We hope this dataset will inspire further research on the reasoning and contextual understanding capabilities of VLMs. | Kankan Zhou, Eason Lai, Kyriakos Mouratidis, Jing Jiang |  |

Generating detailed diagram descriptions for blind and low-vision (BLV) users is one such challenging domain. Sighted annotators could describe visuals with ease, but existing studies have shown that direct generations by them are costly, bias-prone, and somewhat lacking by BLV standards. In this study, we ask sighted individuals to assess—rather than produce—diagram descriptions generated by vision-language models (VLM) that have been guided with latent supervision via a multi-pass inference. The sighted assessments prove effective and useful to professional educators who are themselves BLV and teach visually impaired learners. We release Sightation, a collection of diagram description datasets spanning 5k diagrams and 137k samples for completion, preference, retrieval, question answering, and reasoning training purposes and demonstrate their fine-tuning potential in various downstream... | Wan Ju Kang, Eunki Kim, Na Min An, Sangryul Kim, Haemin Choi, Ki Hoon Kwak, James Thorne |  |

In this paper, we study how to integrate the user’s implicit preference into the progress of travel planning. We introduce RealTravel, an augmented version of the TravelPlanner by incorporating real user reviews and point-of-interest metadata from Google Local. Based on RealTravel, we propose Personal Travel Solver (PTS), an integrated system that combines LLMs with numerical solvers to generate travel plans that satisfy both explicit constraints and implicit user preferences. PTS employs a novel architecture that seamlessly connects explicit constraint validation with implicit preference modeling through five specialized modules. The experimental results demonstrate the system’s effectiveness, achieving better performance than baseline methods, and improvement in the level of... | Zijian Shao, Jiancan Wu, Weijian Chen, Xiang Wang |  |

Multi-Conditioned Counterspeech Generation through Attributed Prefix Learning](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.1340/) |  | 0 | Counterspeech has proven to be a powerful tool to combat hate speech online. Previous studies have focused on generating counterspeech conditioned only on specific intents (single attributed). However, a holistic approach considering multiple attributes simultaneously can yield more nuanced and effective responses. Here, we introduce HiPPrO, Hierarchical Prefix learning with Preference Optimization, a novel two-stage framework that utilizes the effectiveness of attribute-specific prefix embedding spaces hierarchically optimized during the counterspeech generation process in the first phase. Thereafter, we incorporate both reference and reward-free preference optimization to generate more constructive counterspeech. Furthermore, we extend IntentCONANv2 by annotating all 13,973 counterspeech instances with emotion labels by five annotators. HiPPrO leverages hierarchical prefix optimization to integrate these dual attributes effectively. An extensive evaluation demonstrates that HiPPrO... | Aswini Kumar Padhi, Anil Bandhakavi, Tanmoy Chakraborty |  |

The main challenge for divide-and-conquer long text processing frameworks lies in the risk of losing essential long-range information due to document splitting, which can lead the model to produce incomplete or incorrect answers based on the segmented texts.Disrupted long-range information can be classified into two categories: inter-chunk dependency and inter-chunk conflict.We design a structured information protocol to better cope with inter-chunk dependency and an in-context confidence calibration mechanism to resolve inter-chunk conflicts. Experiments demonstrate that LLM×MapReduce outperforms representative open-source... | Zihan Zhou, Chong Li, Xinyi Chen, Shuo Wang, Yu Chao, Zhili Li, Haoyu Wang, Qi Shi, Zhixing Tan, Xu Han, Xiaodong Shi, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun |  |

However, the field faces staffing shortages and increasing workloads. While automated approaches using vision-language models (VLMs) show promise as assistants, they require exceptionally high accuracy. Most current VLMs in radiology rely solely on supervised fine-tuning. Meanwhile, additional preference fine-tuning in the post-training pipeline has become standard practice in the general domain. The challenge in radiology lies in the prohibitive cost of obtaining radiologist feedback at scale. To address this challenge, we propose an automated pipeline for preference feedback, focusing on chest X-ray radiology report generation (RRG). Specifically, our method leverages publicly available datasets containing pairs of images and radiologist-written reference reports with reference-based metrics, or Judges, eliminating the need for \*additional radiologist feedback\*.

Although students’ questions often contain valuable signals about their understanding and misconceptions, traditional KT models often neglect to incorporate these questions as inputs to address these challenges. This paper introduces SQKT (Students’ Question-based Knowledge Tracing), a knowledge tracing model that leverages students’ questions and automatically extracted skill information to enhance the accuracy of predicting students’ performance on subsequent problems in programming education. Our method creates semantically rich embeddings that capture not only the surface-level content of the questions but also the student’s mastery level and conceptual understanding.

While existing embedding models excel at capturing general meaning, they often overlook ideological nuances, limiting their effectiveness in tasks that require an understanding of political bias. To address this gap, we introduce PRISM, the first framework designed to Produce inteRpretable polItical biaS eMbeddings. PRISM operates in two key stages: (1) Controversial Topic Bias Indicator Mining, which systematically extracts fine-grained political topics and corresponding bias indicators from weakly labeled news data, and (2) Cross-Encoder Political Bias Embedding, which assigns structured bias scores to news articles based on their alignment with these indicators. This approach ensures that embeddings are explicitly tied to bias-revealing dimensions, enhancing both interpretability and predictive power.... | Yiqun Sun, Qiang Huang, Anthony Kum Hoe Tung, Jun Yu |  |

In contrast, it is still a challenge for current large language models to generate corresponding utterances based on the assessment of facts and confidence in an uncertain real-world environment. While it has recently become popular to estimate and calibrate confidence of LLMs with verbalized uncertainty, what is lacking is a careful examination of the linguistic knowledge of uncertainty encoded in the latent space of LLMs. In this paper, we draw on typological frameworks of epistemic expressions to evaluate LLMs’ knowledge of epistemic modality, using controlled stories. Our experiments show that the performance of LLMs in generating epistemic expressions is limited and not robust, and hence the expressions of uncertainty generated by LLMs are not always reliable. To build uncertainty-aware LLMs, it is necessary to enrich semantic knowledge... | Meng Li, Michael Vrazitulis, David Schlangen |  |

However, previous RAG approaches overlook the lexical diversity of queries, hindering their ability to achieve a granular relevance assessment between queries and retrieved documents, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we introduce a Lexical Diversity-aware RAG (DRAG) method to address the biases in relevant information retrieval and utilization induced by lexical diversity. Specifically, a Diversity-sensitive Relevance Analyzer is proposed to decouple and assess the relevance of different query components (words, phrases) based on their levels of lexical diversity, ensuring precise and comprehensive document retrieval. Moreover, a Risk-guided Sparse Calibration strategy is further introduced to calibrate the generated tokens that is heavily affected by irrelevant content. Through these modules, DRAG is capable of... | Zhange Zhang, Yuqing Ma, Yulong Wang, Shan He, Tianbo Wang, Siqi He, Jiakai Wang, Xianglong Liu |  |

However, real-world scenarios often involve intricate multi-image inputs, leading to a notable performance decline as models struggle to disentangle critical information scattered across complex visual features. In this work, we propose Focus-Centric Visual Chain, a novel paradigm that enhances VLMs’ perception, comprehension, and reasoning abilities in multi-image scenarios. To facilitate this paradigm, we propose Focus-Centric Data Synthesis, a scalable bottom-up approach for synthesizing high-quality data with elaborate reasoning paths. Through this approach, We construct VISC-150K, a large-scale dataset with reasoning data in the form of Focus-Centric Visual Chain, specifically designed for multi-image tasks. Experimental results on seven multi-image benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves average performance gains of 3.16% and 2.24% across two distinct model architectures, without compromising... | Juntian Zhang, Chuanqi Cheng, Yuhan Liu, Wei Liu, Jian Luan, Rui Yan |  |

Existing RRG models mainly rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) based on different model architectures using data pairs of radiological images and corresponding radiologist-annotated reports. Recent research has shifted focus to post-training improvements, aligning RRG model outputs with human preferences using reinforcement learning (RL). However, the limited data coverage of high-quality annotated data poses risks of overfitting and generalization. This paper proposes a novel Online Iterative Self-Alignment (OISA) method for RRG that consists of four stages: self-generation of diverse data, self-evaluation for multi-objective preference data, self-alignment for multi-objective optimization and self-iteration for further improvement. Our approach allows for generating varied reports tailored to specific clinical objectives, enhancing the overall performance of the RRG model... | Ting Xiao, Lei Shi, Yang Zhang, HaoFeng Yang, Zhe Wang, Chenjia Bai |  |

While inertial sensor-based writing recognition is promising due to the sensors’ small size, wearability, and low cost, accurate recognition in the Chinese context is hampered by the difficulty of collecting extensive inertial signal samples for the vast number of characters. Therefore, we design a Chinese Inertial GAN (CI-GAN) containing Chinese glyph encoding (CGE), forced optimal transport (FOT), and semantic relevance alignment (SRA) to acquire unlimited high-quality training samples. Unlike existing vectorization methods focusing on the meaning of Chinese characters, CGE represents shape and stroke features, providing glyph guidance for writing signal generation. FOT establishes a triple-consistency constraint between the input prompt, output signal features, and real signal features, ensuring the authenticity and semantic accuracy of the generated signals.

While prior research has been conducted on general security capabilities of LLMs, their specific susceptibility to jailbreak attacks in code generation remains largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we propose MalwareBench, a benchmark dataset containing 3,520 jailbreaking prompts for malicious code-generation, designed to evaluate LLM robustness against such threats. MalwareBench is based on 320 manually crafted malicious code generation requirements, covering 11 jailbreak methods and 29 code functionality categories. Experiments show that mainstream LLMs exhibit limited ability to reject malicious code-generation requirements, and the combination of multiple jailbreak methods further reduces the model’s security capabilities: specifically, the average rejection rate for... | Haoyang Li, Huan Gao, Zhiyuan Zhao, Zhiyu Lin, Junyu Gao, Xuelong Li |  |

In this paper, we define a comprehensive set of formal properties that captures the strengths and weaknesses of the existing metric families and prove that none of them is able to satisfy all properties simultaneously. We argue that it is necessary to measure how much information (correct or noisy) each token in the sequence contributes depending on different aspects such as sequence length, number of tokens annotated by the system, token specificity, etc. On this basis, we introduce the Sequence Labelling Information Contrast Model (SL-ICM), a novel metric based on information theory for evaluating sequence labeling tasks. Our formal analysis and experimentation show that the proposed metric satisfies all properties simultaneously | Enrique Amigó, Elena Álvarez Mellado, Julio Gonzalo, Jorge CarrillodeAlbornoz |  |

Many existing approaches aim to mimic human thought processes by enabling large models to perform retrieval-augmented generation step by step. However, these methods can only perform single chain reasoning, which lacks the ability for multi-path exploration, strategic look-ahead, stepwise evaluation, and global selection. In addition, to effectively decompose complex problems, these methods can only rely on labor-intensive intermediate annotations for supervised fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose GRAT, an algorithm guided by Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and process rewards. GRAT not only enables self-evaluation and self-correction but also assigns fine-grained rewards to each intermediate step in the search path. These fine-grained annotations can be used for model self-training, which enables GRAT to continuously self-update its... | Xianshu Peng, Wei Wei |  |

Traditionally, RLHF involves generating responses to a query and using a separate reward model to assign a score to the entire completion. This approach, however, presents challenges, as it provides a single, sparse reward at the end of a sequence, making optimization difficult for the model, in which both training and generation occur auto-regressively at token levels. While recent methods have attempted to address this by assigning token-level discrete or continuous rewards, these often rely on either a trained credit assignment model or AI annotators, which raises concerns about the quality and reliability of the token-level rewards. In this paper, we propose T-REG, which utilizes both sequence-level and token-level rewards for preference optimization. T-REG employs... | Wenxuan Zhou, Shujian Zhang, Lingxiao Zhao, Tao Meng |  |

However, existing agentic systems, whether based on fixed pipeline algorithms or pre-defined meta-learning frameworks, cannot search the whole agent design space due to the restriction of human-designed components, and thus might miss the more optimal agent design. In this paper, we introduce Gödel Agent, a self-evolving framework inspired by the Gödel Machine, enabling agents to recursively improve themselves without relying on predefined routines or fixed optimization algorithms. Gödel Agent leverages LLMs to dynamically modify its own logic and behavior, guided solely by high-level objectives through prompting. Experimental results on multiple domains demonstrate that the implementation of Gödel Agent can achieve continuous self-improvement, surpassing manually crafted agents in performance, efficiency, and generalizability. | Xunjian Yin, Xinyi Wang, Liangming Pan, Li Lin, Xiaojun Wan, William Yang Wang |  |

However, the community lacks a unified interactive framework that covers diverse environments for comprehensive evaluation of agents, and enables exploration and learning for their self-improvement. To address this, we propose AgentGym, a framework featuring 7 real-world scenarios, 14 environments, and 89 tasks for unified, real-time, and concurrent agent interaction. We construct expanded instruction set, high-quality trajectories, and comprehensive benchmarking suite for developing LLM-based agents. Moreover, AgentGym supports interactive exploration and learning for agents through multi-turn interactions and real-time feedback. Based on AgentGym, we take the initial step to develop LLM-based agents that can handle diverse tasks via methods like self-improvement or reinforcement... | Zhiheng Xi, Yiwen Ding, Wenxiang Chen, Boyang Hong, Honglin Guo, Junzhe Wang, Xin Guo, Dingwen Yang, Chenyang Liao, Wei He, Songyang Gao, Lu Chen, Rui Zheng, Yicheng Zou, Tao Gui, Qi Zhang, Xipeng Qiu, Xuanjing Huang, Zuxuan Wu, YuGang Jiang |  |

However, there has been limited investigation of how various reasoning prompting strategies perform as scaling. In this paper, we focus on a standard and realistic scaling setting: majority voting. We systematically conduct experiments on 6 LLMs × 8 prompting strategies × 6 benchmarks. Experiment results consistently show that as the sampling time and computational overhead increase, complicated prompting strategies with superior initial performance gradually fall behind simple Chain-of-Thought.We analyze this phenomenon and provide theoretical proofs. Additionally, we propose a probabilistic method to efficiently predict scaling performance and identify the best prompting strategy under large sampling times, eliminating the need for resource-intensive inference processes in practical applications.Furthermore, we introduce two ways derived from our theoretical analysis to significantly... | Yexiang Liu, Zekun Li, Zhi Fang, Nan Xu, Ran He, Tieniu Tan |  |

In the case of neural language models (LMs), debates persist as to whether these biases align with or diverge from human processing constraints. To address this issue, we propose a quantitative framework that allows for controlled investigations into the nature of these biases. Within our framework, we introduce m-local entropy—an information-theoretic measure derived from average lossy-context surprisal—that captures the local uncertainty of a language by quantifying how effectively the preceding symbols disambiguate the next symbol. In experiments on both perturbed natural language corpora and languages defined by probabilistic finite-state automata (PFSA), we show that languages with higher m-local entropy are more difficult for Transformer and LSTM LMs to learn. These results suggest that neural LMs, much like humans, are highly sensitive to the local statistical... | Taiga Someya, Anej Svete, Brian DuSell, Timothy J.

However, they struggle with temporal reasoning, which requires processing time-related information such as event sequencing, durations, and inter-temporal relationships. These capabilities are critical for applications including question answering, scheduling, and historical analysis. In this paper, we introduce TISER, a novel framework that enhances the temporal reasoning abilities of LLMs through a multi-stage process that combines timeline construction with iterative self-reflection. Our approach leverages test-time scaling to extend the length of reasoning traces, enabling models to capture complex temporal dependencies more effectively. This strategy not only boosts reasoning accuracy but also improves the traceability of the inference process. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks,... | Adrián Bazaga, Rexhina Blloshmi, Bill Byrne, Adrià de Gispert |  |

In this paper, we focus on the task of document-level scientific evidence extraction for clinical questions with conflicting evidence. To support this task, we create a dataset called CochraneForest leveraging forest plots from Cochrane systematic reviews. It comprises 202 annotated forest plots, associated clinical research questions, full texts of studies, and study-specific conclusions. Building on CochraneForest, we propose URCA (Uniform Retrieval Clustered Augmentation), a retrieval-augmented generation framework designed to tackle the unique challenges of evidence extraction. Our experiments show that URCA outperforms the best existing methods by up to 10.3% in F1 score on this task. However, the results... | Massimiliano Pronesti, Joao H.

Existing robust benchmark datasets have two key limitations: 1) They generate only a limited range of perturbations for a single Information Extraction (IE) task, which fails to evaluate the robustness of UIE models effectively; 2) They rely on small models or handcrafted rules to generate perturbations, often resulting in unnatural adversarial examples. Considering the powerful generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce a new benchmark dataset for Robust UIE, called RUIE-Bench, which utilizes LLMs to generate more diverse and realistic perturbations across different IE tasks. Based on this dataset, we comprehensively evaluate existing UIE models and reveal that both LLM-based models and other models suffer from significant performance drops.

These language-level characteristics render automatic translations different from text originally written in a language and human translations, which hinders their usefulness in for example creating evaluation datasets. Attempts to increase naturalness in NMT can fall short in terms of content preservation, where increased lexical diversity comes at the cost of translation accuracy. Inspired by the reinforcement learning from human feedback framework, we introduce a novel method that rewards both naturalness and content preservation. We experiment with multiple perspectives to produce more natural translations, aiming at reducing machine and human translationese. We evaluate our method on English-to-Dutch literary translation, and find that our best model produces translations that are lexically richer and exhibit more... | Huiyuan Lai, Esther Ploeger, Rik van Noord, Antonio Toral |  |

We first introduce NarrativeReason, a novel dataset focused on temporal relationships among sequential events within narratives, distinguishing it from existing temporal reasoning datasets that primarily address pair-wise event relationships. Our approach then combines temporal reasoning with timeline summarisation through a knowledge distillation framework, where we first fine-tune a teacher model on temporal reasoning tasks and then distill this knowledge into a student model while simultaneously training it for the task of timeline summarisation. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance on out-of-domain mental health-related timeline summarisation tasks, which involve long social media threads with... | Jiayu Song, Mahmud Elahi Akhter, Dana AtzilSlonim, Maria Liakata |  |

Not only do we profile such abusive sentences, but since our dataset includes different semantic variants of the same characteristic attributed to an identity group, we can also systematically study the impact of varying degrees of generalization and perspective framing. Similarly, we switch identity groups to assess whether the characteristic described in a sentence is inherently abusive. We also report on classification experiments. | Tina Lommel, Elisabeth Eder, Josef Ruppenhofer, Michael Wiegand |  |

Building on Loewenstein’s Information Gap Theory, we introduce a framework that models reader curiosity by quantifying semantic information gaps within a text’s semantic structure. Our approach leverages BERTopic-inspired topic modeling and persistent homology to analyze the evolving topology (connected components, cycles, voids) of a dynamic semantic network derived from text segments, treating these features as proxies for information gaps. To empirically evaluate this pipeline, we collect reader curiosity ratings from participants (n = 49) as they read S. Collins’s “The Hunger Games” novel. We then use the topological features from our pipeline as independent variables to predict these ratings, and experimentally show that they significantly improve curiosity prediction compared to a baseline model (73% vs. 30% explained deviance), validating our... | Manuel D.

We find that language models undergo loss deceleration early in training—an abrupt slowdown in the rate of loss improvement, resulting in piecewise linear behaviour of the loss curve in log-log space. Scaling up the model mitigates this transition by (1) decreasing the loss at which deceleration occurs, and (2) improving the log-log rate of loss improvement after deceleration. We attribute loss deceleration to a type of degenerate training dynamics we term zero-sum learning (ZSL). In ZSL, per-example gradients become systematically opposed, leading to destructive interference in per-example changes in loss. As a result, improving loss on one subset of examples degrades it on another, bottlenecking overall progress. Loss deceleration and ZSL provide new insights into the training dynamics underlying language model scaling laws, and could potentially be targeted directly to... | Andrei Mircea, Supriyo Chakraborty, Nima Chitsazan, Irina Rish, Ekaterina Lobacheva |  |

Traditional localized methods in knowledge-based model editing (KME) typically assume that knowledge is stored in particular intermediate layers. However, recent research suggests that these methods do not identify the optimal locations for parameter editing, as knowledge gradually accumulates across all layers in LLMs during the forward pass rather than being stored in specific layers. This paper, for the first time, introduces the concept of critical transmission paths into KME for parameter updating. Specifically, these paths capture the key information flows that significantly influence the model predictions for the editing process. To facilitate this process, we also design a parameter-aware contrastive rectifying algorithm that considers less important paths as... | Songlin Zhai, Yuan Meng, Yuxin Zhang, Guilin Qi |  |

Although recent AI methods, particularly large language models (LLMs), have shown promise in tasks such as hypothesis generation and experimental design, they fall short of replicating the collaborative nature of real-world scientific practices, where diverse experts work together in teams to tackle complex problems. To address the limitations, we propose an LLM-based multi-agent system, i.e., Virtual Scientists (VIRSCI), designed to mimic the teamwork inherent in scientific research. VIRSCI organizes a team of agents to collaboratively generate, evaluate, and refine research ideas. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that this multi-agent approach outperforms the state-of-the-art method in producing novel scientific ideas. We further investigate the collaboration mechanisms that contribute to its tendency to produce ideas with higher novelty, offering valuable... | Haoyang Su, Renqi Chen, Shixiang Tang, Zhenfei Yin, Xinzhe Zheng, Jinzhe Li, Biqing Qi, Qi Wu, Hui Li, Wanli Ouyang, Philip Torr, Bowen Zhou, Nanqing Dong |  |

Empirical analysis reveals challenging tokens induce abrupt gradient spikes across layers, exposing architectural stress points in standard Transformers. Building on this insight, we propose Inner Thinking Transformer (ITT), which reimagines layer computations as implicit thinking steps. ITT dynamically allocates computation through Adaptive Token Routing, iteratively refines representations via Residual Thinking Connections, and distinguishes reasoning phases using Thinking Step Encoding. ITT enables deeper processing of critical tokens without parameter expansion. Evaluations across 162M-466M parameter models show ITT achieves 96.5% performance of a 466M Transformer using only 162M parameters, reduces training data by 43.2%, and outperforms Transformer/Loop variants in 11 benchmarks.

In this paper, we investigate the adaptation of Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding for document-level text generation tasks. MBR decoding makes use of a utility function to estimate the output with the highest expected utility from a set of candidate outputs. Although MBR decoding is shown to be effective in a wide range of sentence-level text generation tasks, its performance on document-level text generation tasks is limited, as many of the utility functions are designed for evaluating the utility of sentences. To this end, we propose MBR-OT, a variant of MBR decoding using Wasserstein distance to compute the utility of a document using a sentence-level utility function. The experimental result shows that the performance of MBR-OT outperforms that of the standard MBR in document-level machine... | Yuu Jinnai |  |

However, these models inadvertently disclose private, sensitive information to their users, underscoring the need for machine unlearning techniques to remove selective information from the models. While prior work has focused on forgetting small, random subsets of training data at the instance-level, we argue that real-world scenarios often require the removal of an entire user data, which may require a more careful maneuver. In this study, we explore entity-level unlearning, which aims to erase all knowledge related to a target entity while preserving the remaining model capabilities. To address this, we introduce Opt-Out, an optimal transport-based unlearning method that utilizes the Wasserstein distance from the model’s initial parameters to achieve more effective and fine-grained unlearning. We also present the first Entity-Level Unlearning Dataset (ELUDe) designed... | Minseok Choi, Daniel Rim, Dohyun Lee, Jaegul Choo |  |

In contrast, fine-tuned BERT-based models, relying on high-quality in-domain data, show excellent performance but suffer from edit pattern overfitting. This paper proposes a novel dynamic mixture approach that effectively combines the probability distributions of small models and LLMs during the beam search decoding phase, achieving a balanced enhancement of precise corrections from small models and the fluency of LLMs. This approach also eliminates the need for fine-tuning LLMs, saving significant time and resources, and facilitating domain adaptation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our mixture approach significantly boosts error correction capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets.

To accommodate this, previous works usually leverage confusion sets, which suffer from two problems, i.e., difficulty in determining which character pairs to include and lack of probabilities to distinguish items in the set. In this paper, we propose a light-weight plug-and-play DISC (i.e., decoding intervention with similarity of characters) module for CSC models. DISC measures phonetic and glyph similarities between characters and incorporates this similarity information only during the inference phase. This method can be easily integrated into various existing CSC models, such as ReaLiSe, SCOPE, and ReLM, without additional training costs. Experiments on three CSC benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves model performance, approaching and even surpassing the current state-of-the-art models. | Ziheng Qiao, Houquan Zhou, Yumeng Liu, Zhenghua Li, Min Zhang, Bo Zhang, Chen Li, Ji Zhang, Fei Huang |  |

Ideally, the choice of the tokeniser—which maps character-strings to subwords—should not affect the probability assigned to the underlying character-string; in practice, it does. We define this mismatch as \*\*tokenisation bias\*\*. In this work, we quantify one particular type of tokenisation bias: the effect of including or not a subword (e.g., ⟨ hello ⟩) in a tokeniser’s vocabulary on the probability a trained model assigns to the corresponding characters (i.e., “hello”). Estimating this effect is challenging because each model is trained with only one tokeniser. We address this by framing tokenisation bias as a causal effect and estimating it using the regression discontinuity design. Specifically, we exploit the fact that tokenisation algorithms rank subwords and add the first K to a tokeniser’s vocabulary, where K is an arbitrary cutoff point. As such,... | Pietro Lesci, Clara Meister, Thomas Hofmann, Andreas Vlachos, Tiago Pimentel |  |

Standard hidden state residuals often fail to adequately preserve initial token-level information in deeper layers. This paper introduces ResFormer, a novel architecture that enhances information flow by incorporating value residual connections in addition to hidden state residuals. And a variant is SVFormer, where all layers share the first layer’s value embedding. Comprehensive empirical evidence demonstrates ResFormer achieves equivalent validation loss with 16.11% fewer model parameters and 20.3% less training data compared to Transformer, while maintaining similar memory usage and computational cost. Besides, SVFormer reduces KV cache size by nearly half with only a small performance penalty and can be integrated with other KV-efficient methods, yielding further reductions in KV cache, with performance... | Zhanchao Zhou, Tianyi Wu, Zhiyun Jiang, Fares Obeid, Zhenzhong Lan |  |

However, numerous methodologies frequently neglect the calibration capabilities of large language models (LLMs), which capitalize on their robust in-context reasoning prowess. This work illustrates that providing LLMs with specific cues substantially improves their calibration efficacy, especially in multi-round calibrations. We present a new SGIC: Self-Guided Iterative Calibration Framework that employs uncertainty scores as a tool. Initially, this framework calculates uncertainty scores to determine both the relevance of each document to the query and the confidence level in the responses produced by the LLMs. Subsequently, it reevaluates these scores iteratively, amalgamating them with prior responses to refine calibration. Furthermore, we introduce an innovative approach for constructing an iterative self-calibration training set, which optimizes LLMs... | Guanhua Chen, Yutong Yao, Lidia S. Chao, Xuebo Liu, Derek F.

However, most NLP progress has been made using romanized text. In this paper, we present NusaAksara, a novel public benchmark for Indonesian languages that includes their original scripts. Our benchmark covers both text and image modalities and encompasses diverse tasks such as image segmentation, OCR, transliteration, translation, and language identification. Our data is constructed by human experts through rigorous steps. NusaAksara covers 8 scripts across 7 languages, including low-resource languages not commonly seen in NLP benchmarks. Although unsupported by Unicode, the Lampung script is included in this dataset. We benchmark our data across several models, from LLMs and VLMs such as GPT-4o, Llama 3.2, and Aya 23 to task-specific systems such as PP-OCR and LangID, and show that most NLP technologies cannot handle Indonesia’s local scripts, with many achieving near-zero performance. | Muhammad Farid Adilazuarda, Musa Izzanardi Wijanarko, Lucky Susanto, Khumaisa Nur'aini, Derry Tanti Wijaya, Alham Fikri Aji |  |

Traditional deep learning-based methods model rumors based on content, propagation structure, or user behavior, but these approaches are constrained by limited modeling capacity and insufficient training corpora. Recent studies have explored using LLMs for rumor detection through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), but face two issues: 1) unreliable samples sometimes mislead the model learning; 2) the model only learns the most salient input-output mapping and skips in-depth analyses of the rumored content for convenience. To address these issues, we propose an SFT-based LLM rumor detection model with Influence guided Sample selection and Game-based multi-perspective Analysis (ISGA). Specifically, we first introduce the Influence Score (IS) to assess the impact of samples on model predictions and select samples for SFT. We also approximate IS via Taylor expansion to reduce computational complexity.

To address these issues, we propose the Hierarchical Embodied Continual Learning Setups (HEC) that divide the agent’s continual learning process into two layers: high-level instructions and low-level actions, and define five embodied continual learning sub-setups. Building on these setups, we introduce the Task-aware Mixture of Incremental LoRA Experts (Task-aware MoILE) method. This approach achieves task recognition by clustering visual-text embeddings and uses both a task-level router and a token-level router to select the appropriate LoRA experts. To effectively address the issue of catastrophic forgetting, we apply Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to the LoRA parameters obtained from prior tasks, preserving key components while orthogonally training the remaining parts.

However, the increasing memory consumption of KV cache has possessed a significant challenge to the inference system. Eviction methods have revealed the inherent redundancy within the KV cache, demonstrating its potential for reduction, particularly in deeper layers. However, KV cache reduction for shallower layers has been found to be insufficient. Based on our observation that, the KV cache exhibits a high degree of similarity. Based on this observation, we proposed a novel KV cache reduction method, SpindleKV, which balances both shallow and deep layers. For deep layers, we employ an attention weight based eviction method, while for shallow layers, we apply a codebook based replacement approach which is learnt by similarity and merging policy. Moreover, SpindleKV addressed the Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) dilemma faced by other attention based eviction methods.

Quantization is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) efficiently. Binary-coding quantization (BCQ) and uniform quantization (UQ) are promising quantization schemes that have strong expressiveness and optimizability, respectively. However, neither scheme leverages both advantages. In this paper, we propose UniQuanF (Unified Quantization with Flexible Mapping), an accurate quantization method for LLMs. UniQuanF harnesses both strong expressiveness and optimizability by unifying the flexible mapping technique in UQ and BCQ’s non-uniform quantization levels. We propose unified initialization, and local and periodic mapping techniques to optimize the parameters in UniQuanF precisely. After optimization, our unification theorem removes computational and memory overhead, allowing us to utilize the superior accuracy of UniQuanF without extra deployment costs induced by the unification.

Agentic Reasoning dynamically leverages web search, code execution, and structured memory to address complex problems requiring deep research. A key innovation in our framework is the Mind-Map agent, which constructs a structured knowledge graph to store reasoning context and track logical relationships, ensuring coherence in long reasoning chains with extensive tool usage. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive exploration of the Web-Search agent, leading to a highly effective search mechanism that surpasses all prior approaches. When deployed on DeepSeek-R1, our method achieves a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) among public models and delivers performance comparable to OpenAI Deep Research, the leading proprietary model in this domain. Extensive ablation studies validate the optimal selection of agentic tools and confirm the effectiveness of our... | Junde Wu, Jiayuan Zhu, Yuyuan Liu, Min Xu, Yueming Jin |  |

Current methods have made significant progress by improving embedding and cross-modal fusion. However, most of them depend on using loss functions to capture the relationship between modalities or adopt a one-time strategy to directly compute modality weights using attention mechanisms, which overlooks the relative interactions between modalities at the entity level and the accuracy of modality weights, thereby hindering the generalization to diverse entities. To address this challenge, we propose RICEA, a relative interaction and calibration framework for multi-modal entity alignment, which dynamically computes weights based on the relative interaction and recalibrates the weights according to their uncertainties. Among these, we propose a novel method called ADC that utilizes attention mechanisms to perceive the uncertainty of the weight for each modality, rather... | Chenxiao Li, Jingwei Cheng, Qiang Tong, Fu Zhang, Cairui Wang |  |

However, they utilize non-parametric memory as static storage, which lacks learning capability and remains disconnected from the internal information flow of the parametric models, limiting scalability and efficiency. Based on recent interpretability theories of LMs, we reconceptualize the non-parametric memory represented by kNN-LM as a learnable Mixture-of-Neighbors Induction Memory (MoNIM), which synergizes the induction capabilities of attention heads with the memorization strength of feed-forward networks (FFN). By integrating into the model’s information flow, MoNIM functions as an FFN-like bypass layer within the Transformer architecture, enabling effective learning of new knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoNIM is a retentive and scalable continual learner in both data- and model-wise, enhancing the scalability and continual learning performance of... | Guangyue Peng, Tao Ge, Wen Luo, Wei Li, Houfeng Wang |  |

The dataset includes 14 clinically significant AEs—such as falls, delirium, and intracranial haemorrhage, along with contextual attributes like negation, diagnosis type, and in-hospital occurrence. Uniquely, the annotation schema supports both discontinuous and overlapping entities, addressing challenges rarely tackled in prior work. We evaluate multiple models using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities: fine-grained, coarse-grained, and coarse-grained with negation. While transformer-based models (e.g., BERT-cased) achieve strong performance on document-level coarse-grained extraction (F1 = 0.943), performance drops notably for fine-grained entity-level tasks (e.g., F1 = 0.675), particularly for rare events and complex attributes. These results demonstrate that despite high-level... | Imane Guellil, Salomé Andres, Atul Anand, Bruce Guthrie, Huayu Zhang, Abul Hasan, Honghan Wu, Beatrice Alex |  |

Current works typically fine-tune LLMs using slow-fast code pairs mined from online programming platforms. Although these methods are widely recognized for their effectiveness, the training data often lack clear code acceleration patterns and offer only limited speed improvements. Moreover, existing training methods, such as direct instruction fine-tuning (IFT), tend to overlook the hierarchical relationships among acceleration patterns. In this work, we introduce BITE, a novel training paradigm designed to improve LLMs’ CA capabilities through two key innovations: (1) Bidirectional tree editing, which generates high-quality training data by incrementally transforming given code into both its most efficient and least efficient variants, and (2) Progressive code acceleration learning, which enables LLMs to internalize multi-level CA strategies by learning increasingly sophisticated acceleration... | Longhui Zhang, Jiahao Wang, Meishan Zhang, GaoXiong Cao, Ensheng Shi, Mayuchi Mayuchi, Jun Yu, Honghai Liu, Jing Li, Min Zhang |  |

However, prior approaches mainly depend on document-level comparisons using basic indicators like citations due to the lack of facet-level relevance datasets; yet, this limits their use to citation-based domains and fails to capture the intricacies of facet constraints. In this paper, we propose a multi-facet blending (FaBle) augmentation method, which exploits modularity by decomposing and recomposing to explicitly synthesize facet-specific training sets. We automatically decompose documents into facet units and generate (ir)relevant pairs by leveraging LLMs’ intrinsic distinguishing capabilities; then, dynamically recomposing the units leads to facet-wise relevance-informed document pairs. Our modularization eliminates the need for pre-defined facet knowledge or labels. Further, to prove the FaBle’s... | Heejin Do, Sangwon Ryu, Jonghwi Kim, Gary Lee |  |

Most existing works merely stagnate at assessing LLMs’ event reasoning with a single event relational type or reasoning format, failing to conduct a complete evaluation and provide a practical solution for capability enhancement. In this paper, we propose PIPER, the first comprehensive benchmark for Probing Into the Performance boundary of LLMs in Event Reasoning. Motivated by our evaluation observations and error patterns analysis, we meticulously craft 10K diverse instruction-tuning demonstrations to alleviate event reasoning-oriented data scarcity. Additionally, a novel Debiasing and Distillation-Enhanced Supervised Fine-Tuning (D2E-SFT) strategy is presented, which facilitates adhering to context and fixating significant contextual event information to elevate the event reasoning capability. Specifically, D2E-SFT removes the given sample’s context to construct an... | Zhicong Lu, Changyuan Tian, PeiguangLi PeiguangLi, Li Jin, Sirui Wang, Wei Jia, Ying Shen, Guangluan Xu |  |

While existing approaches rely on grounding the discovery process within the relevant literature, effectiveness varies significantly with the quality and nature of the retrieved literature. We address the challenge of retrieving prior work whose concepts can inspire solutions for a given research problem, a task we define as Methodology Inspiration Retrieval (MIR). We construct a novel dataset tailored for training and evaluating retrievers on MIR, and establish baselines. To address MIR, we build the Methodology Adjacency Graph (MAG); capturing methodological lineage through citation relationships. We leverage MAG to embed an “intuitive prior’’ into dense retrievers for identifying patterns of methodological inspiration beyond superficial semantic similarity. This achieves significant gains of +5.4 in Recall@3 and +7.8 in Mean Average... | Aniketh Garikaparthi, Manasi Patwardhan, Aditya Sanjiv Kanade, Aman Hassan, Lovekesh Vig, Arman Cohan |  |

These tokens, when repeatedly inserted into sentences, pull sentence similarity toward a certain value, disrupting the normal distribution of embedding distances and degrading downstream performance. In this paper, we systematically investigate such anomalous tokens, formally defining them and introducing an efficient detection method, Sticky Token Detector (STD), based on sentence and token filtering. Applying STD to 40 checkpoints across 14 model families, we discover a total of 868 sticky tokens. Our analysis reveals that these tokens often originate from special or unused entries in the vocabulary, as well as fragmented subwords from multilingual corpora. Notably, their presence does not strictly correlate with model size or vocabulary size. We further evaluate how sticky tokens affect downstream tasks like clustering and... | Kexin Chen, Dongxia Wang, Yi Liu, Haonan Zhang, Wenhai Wang |  |

However, current research on knowledge injection remains superficial, mainly focusing on knowledge memorization and retrieval. This paper proposes a four-tier knowledge injection framework that systematically defines the levels of knowledge injection: memorization, retrieval, reasoning, and association. Based on this framework, we introduce DeepKnowledge, a synthetic experimental testbed designed for fine-grained evaluation of the depth of knowledge injection across three knowledge types (novel, incremental, and updated). We then explore various knowledge injection scenarios and evaluate the depth of knowledge injection for each scenario on the benchmark. Experimental results reveal key factors to reach each level of knowledge... | Ruoxi Xu, Yunjie Ji, Boxi Cao, Yaojie Lu, Hongyu Lin, Xianpei Han, Ben He, Yingfei Sun, Xiangang Li, Le Sun |  |

Existing methods for constructing training data for retrievers suffer from three key limitations: (1) the synergistic effect of examples is not considered, (2) the linguistic characteristics of the query are not sufficiently factored in, and (3) scoring is not directly optimized for DST performance. Consequently, the retriever can fail to retrieve examples that would substantially improve DST performance. To address these issues, we present CombiSearch—a method that scores effective in-context examples based on their combinatorial impact on DST performance. Our evaluation on MultiWOZ shows that retrievers trained with CombiSearch surpass state-of-the-art models, achieving a 20× gain in data efficiency and generalizing well to the SGD dataset. Moreover, CombiSearch... | Haesung Pyun, Yoonah Park, Yohan Jo |  |

This paper explores the embedding-based context compression to reduce inference costs while preserving the downstream LLM configurations. We propose a decoupled compressor-LLM framework, pretrained on text reconstruction and completion tasks, designed to effectively preserve essential contextual information within condensed embedding representations. Our extensive experiments investigate pretraining, model configurations, compression rates, efficiency across tasks, and adaptability to various LLMs. Results demonstrate that our approach outperforms competitive baselines in three domains and across eight datasets while being adaptable to different downstream LLMs. We find that thorough pretraining and carefully selected compression rates, such as... | Yuhong Dai, Jianxun Lian, Yitian Huang, Wei Zhang, Mingyang Zhou, Mingqi Wu, Xing Xie, Hao Liao |  |

While human values—core beliefs that shape an individual’s priorities—are increasingly emphasized in contemporary psychological therapy for their role in fostering internal transformation and long-term emotional well-being, their integration into emotional support systems remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present a value-driven method for training emotional support dialogue systems designed to reinforce positive values in seekers. Notably, our model identifies which values to reinforce at each turn and how to do so, by leveraging online support conversations from Reddit. We evaluate the method across support skills, seekers’ emotional intensity, and value reinforcement. Our method consistently outperforms various baselines, effectively exploring and eliciting values from seekers. Additionally, leveraging crowd knowledge from Reddit significantly enhances its... | Juhee Kim, Chunghu Mok, Jisun Lee, Hyang Sook Kim, Yohan Jo |  |

In this paper, we introduce a phenomenon we call Length Collapse, where embeddings of longer texts tend to cluster together. This clustering results in a distributional inconsistency between the embeddings of short and long texts. We further investigate how these differences contribute to the performance decline observed with longer texts across various downstream tasks. Through a rigorous theoretical analysis of the self-attention mechanism, which acts as a low-pass filter in PLM-based models, we demonstrate that as text length increases, the strength of low-pass filtering intensifies, causing embeddings to retain more low-frequency components. As a result, input token features become more similar, leading to clustering and ultimately the collapse of embeddings for longer texts. To address this issue, we propose a simple method, TempScale, which mitigates... | Yuqi Zhou, Sunhao Dai, Zhanshuo Cao, Xiao Zhang, Jun Xu |  |

Pre-training methods for sign language have typically focused on either supervised pre-training, which cannot take advantage of unlabeled data, or context-independent (frame or video segment) representations, which ignore the effects of relationships across time in sign language. We introduce SHuBERT (Sign Hidden-Unit BERT), a self-supervised contextual representation model learned from approximately 1,000 hours of American Sign Language video. SHuBERT adapts masked token prediction objectives to multi-stream visual sign language input, learning to predict multiple targets corresponding to clustered hand, face, and body pose streams. SHuBERT achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks including sign language translation, isolated sign language recognition, and fingerspelling detection. | Shester Gueuwou, Xiaodan Du, Greg Shakhnarovich, Karen Livescu, Alexander H.

However, existing methods typically rely on heuristically defined importance scores, which may lead to inaccurate informativeness estimation. In addition, they lack consideration for time efficiency. To solve these problems, we propose ERU-KG, an unsupervised keyphrase generation (UKG) model that consists of an informativeness and a phraseness module. The former estimates the relevance of keyphrase candidates, while the latter generate those candidates. The informativeness module innovates by learning to model informativeness through references (e.g., queries, citation contexts, and titles) and at the term-level, thereby 1) capturing how the key concepts of documents are perceived in different contexts and 2) estimating informativeness of phrases more efficiently by aggregating term informativeness, removing the need for explicit modeling of the candidates. ERU-KG demonstrates its effectiveness on keyphrase... | Lam Thanh Do, Aaditya Bodke, Pritom Saha Akash, Kevin ChenChuan Chang |  |

However, they are also well known to hallucinate, producing responses that seem plausible but are factually incorrect. On the other hand, users tend to over-rely on LLM-based AI agents, accepting AI’s suggestion even when it is wrong. Adding positive friction, such as explanations or getting user confirmations, has been proposed as a mitigation in AI-supported decision-making systems. In this paper, we propose an accountability model for LLM-based task-oriented dialogue agents to address user overreliance via friction turns in cases of model uncertainty and errors associated with dialogue state tracking (DST). The accountability model is an augmented LLM with an additional accountability head that functions as a binary classifier to predict the relevant slots of the dialogue state mentioned in the conversation. We perform our experiments with multiple backbone LLMs on two established benchmarks (MultiWOZ and... | Suvodip Dey, YiJyun Sun, Gokhan Tur, Dilek HakkaniTür |  |

Unveiling and Mitigating the Authority Bias in Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.1400/) |  | 0 | Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been proven to be an effective approach to address the hallucination problem in large language models (LLMs). In current RAG systems, LLMs typically need to synthesize knowledge provided by two main external sources (user prompts and an external database) to generate a final answer. When the knowledge provided by the user conflicts with that retrieved from the database, a critical question arises: Does the LLM favor one knowledge source over the other when generating the answer? In this paper, we are the first to unveil a new phenomenon, Authority Bias, where the LLMs tend to favor the knowledge provided by the user even when it deviates from the facts; this new phenomenon is rigorously evidenced via our novel and comprehensive characterization of Authority Bias in six widely used LLMs and across diverse task scenarios. We propose a novel dataset specifically designed for detecting Authority Bias, called the Authority Bias Detection Dataset... | Yuxuan Li, Xinwei Guo, Jiashi Gao, Guanhua Chen, Xiangyu Zhao, Jiaxin Zhang, Quanying Liu, Haiyan Wu, Xin Yao, Xuetao Wei |  |

Accordingly, tool learning has emerged to enable LLMs to effectively leverage external tools to extend their capabilities. Current tool-learning paradigms like CoT/ReAct employ sequential tool invocation but suffer from constrained perception and inadequate task planning. Alternative approaches using search-based decision trees incur substantial computational overhead. To address these limitations, we propose DTA-Llama (Divide-Then-Aggregate Llama), a novel parallel tool invocation framework featuring: (1) A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure that transformed from traditional tree-based tool search paths, enabling parallel execution and contributing high-quality training data; (2) A process-thread-inspired inference mechanism that iteratively decomposes tasks into parallel tool-using subtasks while aggregating results for... | Dongsheng Zhu, Weixian Shi, Zhengliang Shi, Zhaochun Ren, Shuaiqiang Wang, Lingyong Yan, Dawei Yin |  |

Existing Historical Document Restoration (HDR) methods primarily focus on single modality or limited-size restoration, failing to meet practical needs. To fill this gap, we present a full-page HDR dataset (FPHDR) and a novel automated HDR solution (AutoHDR). Specifically, FPHDR comprises 1,633 real and 6,543 synthetic images with character-level and line-level locations, as well as character annotations in different damage grades. AutoHDR mimics historians’ restoration workflows through a three-stage approach: OCR-assisted damage localization, vision-language context text prediction, and patch autoregressive appearance restoration. The modular architecture of AutoHDR enables seamless human-machine collaboration, allowing for flexible intervention and optimization at each restoration stage.

To obtain such contrastive pairs, traditional methods like RLHF and RLAIF rely on limited contrasting patterns, such as varying model variants or decoding temperatures. This singularity leads to two issues: (1) alignment is not comprehensive; and thereby (2) models are susceptible to harmful response tendencies. To address these issues, we investigate how to construct more comprehensive and diversified contrasting patterns to enhance preference data (RQ1) and verify the impact of the diversification of contrasting patterns on model alignment (RQ2). For RQ1, we propose PopAlign, a framework that integrates diversified contrasting patterns across the prompt, model, and pipeline levels, introducing six contrasting strategies that do not require additional feedback labeling procedures. Regarding RQ2, we conduct thorough... | Zekun Moore Wang, Shenzhi Wang, King Zhu, Jiaheng Liu, Ke Xu, Jie Fu, Wangchunshu Zhou, Wenhao Huang |  |

Existing techniques face the emerging challenges of the re-identification ability of large language models (LLMs), which have shown advanced capability in memorizing detailed information and reasoning over dispersed pieces of patterns to draw conclusions. When defending against LLM-based re-identification, anonymization could jeopardize the utility of the resulting anonymized data in downstream tasks. In general, the interaction between anonymization and data utility requires a deeper understanding within the context of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a framework composed of three key LLM-based components: a privacy evaluator, a utility evaluator and an optimization component, which work collaboratively to perform anonymization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms existing baselines, showing robustness in reducing the risk of re-identification while... | Tianyu Yang, Xiaodan Zhu, Iryna Gurevych |  |

In this work, we introduce a novel approach called Scaling to Emphasize Attention for Long-context retrieval (SEAL), which enhances the retrieval performance of large language models (LLMs) over long contexts. We observe that specific attention heads are closely tied to long-context retrieval, showing positive or negative correlation with retrieval scores, and adjusting the strength of these heads boosts the quality of LLMs in long context by a large margin. Built on this insight, we propose a learning-based mechanism that leverages generated data to emphasize these heads. By applying SEAL, we achieve significant improvements in long-context retrieval performance across various tasks and models. Additionally, when combined with existing training-free context extension techniques, SEAL extends the contextual limits of LLMs while... | Changhun Lee, Minsang Seok, Jungyu Jin, Younghyun Cho, Eunhyeok Park |  |

Existing alignment benchmarks primarily focus on sentence embeddings, but prior research has shown that neural models tend to induce a non-smooth representation space, which impact of semantic alignment evaluation on low-resource languages. Inspired by neuroscientific findings that similar information activates overlapping neuronal regions, we propose a novel \*Neuron State-Based Cross-Lingual Alignment\* (NeuronXA) to assess the cross-lingual a lignment capabilities of LLMs, which offers a more semantically grounded approach to assess cross-lingual alignment. We evaluate NeuronXA on several prominent multilingual LLMs (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral, GLM, and OLMo) across two transfer tasks and three multilingual benchmarks. The results demonstrate that with only 100 parallel sentence pairs, NeuronXA achieves a Pearson correlation of... | Chongxuan Huang, Yongshi Ye, Biao Fu, Qifeng Su, Xiaodong Shi |  |

Value principles serve as the foundation for clarifying alignment goals.Multiple sets of value principles have been proposed, such as HHH (helpful, honest, harmless) and instructions for data synthesis in reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF). However, most of them are heuristically crafted, without consideration of three primary challenges in practical LLM alignment: 1) Comprehensiveness to deal with diverse and even unforeseen scenarios in which LLMs could be applied; 2) Precision to provide LLMs with clear and actionable guidance in specific scenarios; and 3) Compatability to avoid internal contracts between principles.In this paper, we formalize quantitative metrics to evaluate value principles along the three desirable properties. Building on these metrics, we propose the Hierarchical Value Principle framework (HiVaP), which constructs a hierarchical... | Bingbing Xu, Jing Yao, Xiaoyuan Yi, Aishan Maoliniyazi, Xing Xie, Xiaofeng Meng |  |

The graph, G, is star-shaped with D arms radiating from a start node, s. A language model (LM) is given G, s, and a target node, t, which ends one of the arms and is tasked with generating the arm containing t. The minimal nature of this task means only a single choice needs to be made: which of the arms contains?Decoder-only LMs fail to solve this elementary task above 1/D chance due to a learned shortcut that absorbs training supervision. We show how this pathology is caused by excess supervision and present a series of solutions demonstrating that the task is solvable via decoder-only LMs. We find that the task’s minimal nature causes its difficulty, as it prevents task decomposition. Our solutions provide insight into the pathology and its implications for LMs trained via next-token prediction. | Arvid Frydenlund |  |

Currently, LLMs use inference methods utilizing generated multiple samples, which can be derived from Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) Decoding. Previous studies have conducted empirical analyses to clarify the improvements in generation performance achieved by MBR decoding and have reported various observations. However, the theoretical underpinnings of these findings remain uncertain. To address this, we offer a new theoretical interpretation of MBR decoding from the perspective of bias–diversity decomposition. In this interpretation, the error in the quality estimation of hypotheses by MBR decoding is decomposed into two main factors: bias, which considers the closeness between the utility function and human evaluation, and diversity, which represents the variability in the quality estimation of the utility function. The theoretical analysis reveals the difficulty of simultaneously... | Hidetaka Kamigaito, Hiroyuki Deguchi, Yusuke Sakai, Katsuhiko Hayashi, Taro Watanabe |  |

Yet, their capacity to leverage internal knowledge about specific entities remains underexplored. This work investigates the disparity in model performance when answering factual questions about an entity described in text versus depicted in an image. Our results reveal a significant accuracy drop — reaching 18% for some models — when the entity is presented visually instead of textually. To study this gap we present PopVQA, a dataset which allows separating entity recognition and question answering, and use it to benchmark several models. We hypothesize that this decline arises from limitations in how information flows from image tokens to query tokens. Thus, we use mechanistic interpretability tools to reveal that, although image tokens are preprocessed by the vision encoder, meaningful information flow from these tokens occurs only in the much deeper layers. Furthermore, critical image... | Ido Cohen, Daniela Gottesman, Mor Geva, Raja Giryes |  |

However, recent research shows that maliciously fine-tuning these LLMs on harmful data can easily bypass these safeguards. To counter this, we theoretically uncover why malicious fine-tuning succeeds and identify potential defense strategies. Building on the theoretical analysis, we introduce the Self-Degraded Defense (SDD) framework. SDD encourages LLMs to produce high-quality but irrelevant responses to harmful prompts. When attackers attempt malicious fine-tuning, the general capability of the LLM aligned by SDD will significantly decrease, rendering it incapable of following harmful instructions. Our experimental results confirm SDD’s effectiveness against such attacks.Our code is available at https://github.com/ZeroNLP/SDD. | Zixuan Chen, Weikai Lu, Xin Lin, Ziqian Zeng |  |

Although recent advances in multimodal models have improved motion understanding,generating precise and sport-specific instruction remains challenging due to the highly domain-specific nature of sports and the need for informative guidance. We propose CoachMe, a reference-based model that analyzes the differences between a learner’s motion and a reference under temporal and physical aspects. This approach enables both domain-knowledge learning and the acquisition of a coach-like thinking process that identifies movement errors effectively and provides feedback to explain how to improve. In this paper, weillustrate how CoachMe adapts well to specific sports such as skating and boxing by learning from general movements and then leveraging limited data. Experiments show that CoachMe provides high-quality instructions instead of directions merely in the... | WeiHsin Yeh, YuAn Su, ChihNing Chen, YiHsueh Lin, Calvin Ku, Wenhsin Chiu, MinChun Hu, LunWei Ku |  |

Structured pruning reduces model size and speeds up inference but often causes uneven degradation across domains, leading to biased performance. To address this, we propose \*DRPruning\*, a method that dynamically adjusts the data distribution during training to restore balanced performance across heterogeneous and multi-tasking data. Experiments in monolingual and multilingual settings show that DRPruning surpasses similarly sized models in both pruning and continued pretraining over perplexity, downstream tasks, and instruction tuning. Further analysis demonstrates the robustness of DRPruning towards various domains and distribution shifts. Furthermore, DRPruning can determine optimal reference losses and data ratios automatically, suggesting potential for broader applications.

Using an Expert-in-the-Loop probing pipeline, we conduct a series of targeted experiments to assess whether LLMs construct semantic representations and pragmatic inferences in a human-like manner.Our findings show that LLMs over-rely on prototypicality, produce inconsistent aspectual judgments, and struggle with causal reasoning derived from aspect, raising concerns about their ability to fully comprehend narratives.These results suggest that LLMs process aspect fundamentally differently from humans and lack robust narrative understanding.Beyond these empirical findings, we develop a standardized experimental framework for... | Karin de Langis, Jong Inn Park, Andreas Schramm, Bin Hu, Khanh Chi Le, Dongyeop Kang |  |

We specifically focus on the sources, variation, and naturalness of included AAL texts representing the AAL speaking community. We find that AAL is underrepresented in all evaluated pretraining corpora compared to US demographics, constituting as few as 0.007% and at most 0.18% of documents. We also find that more than 25% of AAL texts in C4 may be perceived as inappropriate for LLMs to generate and to reinforce harmful stereotypes. Finally, we find that most automated filters are more likely to conserve White Mainstream English (WME) texts over AAL in pretraining corpora. | Nicholas Deas, Blake Vente, Amith Ananthram, Jessica Grieser, Desmond Upton Patton, Shana Kleiner, James R.

We argue that language model (LM) outputs should capture these natural distributions. Our work specifically tests whether LM output probabilities are calibrated to numeric information within their textual contexts. For example, if the context (the prompt) concerns two equally likely options (e.g., heads or tails for a fair coin), the LM output probabilities should also be equal. Likewise, in a context with nonuniformly likely events (e.g., rolling a pair with two dice) an LM should output proportionate probabilities. However, we find that even in simple settings, the best LMs (1) are poorly calibrated and (2) have systematic biases: artifacts like word identity, word order, and word frequency all impact calibration. For example, ‘gpt-4o-mini‘ often picks the first of two options... | Charles Lovering, Michael Krumdick, Viet Dac Lai, Varshini Reddy, Seth Ebner, Nilesh Kumar, Rik KoncelKedziorski, Chris Tanner |  |

While LLMs have improved at processing long inputs, MD contexts still present unique difficulties, including management of inter-document dependencies, redundancy, and incoherent structures. To address this challenge, we introduce MDCure, a scalable and effective instruction data generation framework to enhance the MD capabilities of LLMs without the computational cost of pre-training or reliance on human-annotated data. MDCure generates high-quality synthetic MD instruction data over sets of articles via targeted prompts. We also introduce MDCureRM, a cost-effective, MD-specific reward model to score and filter generated data based on their training utility for MD settings. MDCure is compatible with open- and closed-source models in addition to policy optimization methods such as PPO, enabling even small open- source models to... | Gabrielle KailiMay Liu, Bowen Shi, Avi Caciularu, Idan Szpektor, Arman Cohan |  |

Current methodologies, including automated metrics, human assessments, and LLM-based evaluations, predominantly focus on English, revealing a significant gap in multilingual evaluation frameworks. We introduce the Cross Lingual Auto Evaluation (CIA) Suite, an extensible framework that includes evaluator LLMs (Hercule) and a novel test set (Recon) specifically designed for multilingual evaluation. Our test set features 500 human-annotated instructions spanning various task capabilities along with human judgment scores across six languages. This would enable benchmarking of general-purpose multilingual LLMs and facilitate meta-evaluation of Evaluator LLMs. The proposed model, Hercule, is a cross-lingual evaluation model that addresses the scarcity of reference answers in the target language by learning to assign scores to responses based on easily available reference answers... | Sumanth Doddapaneni, Mohammed Safi Ur Rahman Khan, Dilip Venkatesh, Raj Dabre, Anoop Kunchukuttan, Mitesh M.

However, existing LLM-based review systems face significant challenges, including limited domain expertise, hallucinated reasoning, and a lack of structured evaluation. To address these limitations, we introduce DeepReview, a multi-stage framework designed to emulate expert reviewers by incorporating structured analysis, literature retrieval, and evidence-based argumentation. Using DeepReview-13K, a curated dataset with structured annotations, we train DeepReviewer-14B, which outperforms CycleReviewer-70B with fewer tokens. In its best mode, DeepReviewer-14B achieves win rates of 88.21% and 80.20% against GPT-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 in evaluations. Our work sets a new benchmark for LLM-based paper review, with all resources publicly available. | Minjun Zhu, Yixuan Weng, Linyi Yang, Yue Zhang |  |

We instead propose a novel \*\*optimization-based structural pruning\*\* that learns the pruning masks in a probabilistic space directly by optimizing the loss of the pruned model. To preserve the efficiency, our method \*\*eliminates the back-propagation\*\* through the LLM \*per se\* during the optimization, requiring only \*\*the forward pass of the LLM\*\*. We achieve this by learning an underlying Bernoulli distribution to sample binary pruning masks, where we decouple the Bernoulli parameters from the LLM loss, thus facilitating an efficient optimization via \*policy gradient estimator\* without back-propagation. As a result, our method is able to 1) \*support global and heterogeneous pruning\* (\*i.e.\*, our... | Yuan Gao, Zujing Liu, Weizhong Zhang, Bo Du, GuiSong Xia |  |

This makes it challenging to assess the significance, novelty, incremental findings, and equivalent ideas between related works, particularly those from different research communities. Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong quantitative and qualitative reasoning abilities, and multi-agent LLM debates have shown promise in handling complex reasoning tasks by exploring diverse perspectives and reasoning paths. Inspired by this, we introduce Tree-of-Debate (ToD), a framework which converts scientific papers into LLM personas that debate their respective novelties. To emphasize structured, critical reasoning rather than focusing solely on outcomes, ToD dynamically constructs a debate tree, enabling fine-grained analysis of independent novelty arguments within scholarly articles.... | Priyanka Kargupta, Ishika Agarwal, Tal August, Jiawei Han |  |

This paper introduces the Memory Organization-based Generation (MOG) framework, a novel approach to address these challenges by leveraging a hierarchical memory architecture. MOG extracts fine-grained memory units from web documents, recursively organizes them into a Wikipedia-style hierarchical structure, and uses this structure to guide the generation process. This ensures alignment between memory and the article outline, improving both informativeness and verifiability while minimizing hallucinations. Additionally, a citation module is implemented to enhance traceability by linking every generated sentence to specific memory units. Evaluations on our newly created WikiStart dataset demonstrate that MOG outperforms baseline methods in producing informative and reliable articles, making it particularly robust in... | Eugene J.

While existing classifiers deliver strong results on these tasks, they often come with significant computational cost and high data demands. In this work, we propose Class Distillation (ClaD), a novel training paradigm that targets the core challenge: distilling a small, well-defined target class from a highly diverse and heterogeneous background. ClaD integrates two key innovations: (i) a loss function informed by the structural properties of class distributions, based on Mahalanobis distance, and (ii) an interpretable decision algorithm optimized for class separation. Across three benchmark detection tasks – sexism, metaphor, and sarcasm – ClaD outperforms competitive baselines, and even with smaller language models and orders of magnitude fewer parameters, achieves performance comparable to several... | Chenlu Wang, Weimin Lyu, Ritwik Banerjee |  |

It significantly reduces the training corpus needs to a mere 5% while achieving an impressive 100% of traditional knowledge injection performance. Motivated by structured human education, we propose a novel two-stage strategy for knowledge injection and alignment: Structure-aware Continual Pre-Training (SCPT) and Structure-aware Supervised Fine-Tuning (SSFT). In the SCPT phase, we automatically extract the domain knowledge taxonomy and reorganize the training corpora, enabling LLMs to effectively link textual segments to targeted knowledge points within the taxonomy. In the SSFT phase, we explicitly prompt models to elucidate the underlying knowledge structure in their outputs, leveraging the structured domain insight to address practical problems. Our ultimate method was extensively evaluated across model architectures and... | Kai Liu, Ze Chen, Zhihang Fu, Wei Zhang, Rongxin Jiang, Fan Zhou, Yaowu Chen, Yue Wu, Jieping Ye |  |

However, in the financial domain, there is a notable lack of effective and specialized multimodal evaluation datasets. To advance the development of MLLMs in the finance domain, we introduce FinMME, encompassing more than 11,000 high-quality financial research samples across 18 financial domains and 6 asset classes, featuring 10 major chart types and 21 subtypes. We ensure data quality through 20 annotators and carefully designed validation mechanisms. Additionally, we develop FinScore, an evaluation system incorporating hallucination penalties and multi-dimensional capability assessment to provide an unbiased evaluation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o exhibit unsatisfactory performance on FinMME, highlighting its challenging nature. The benchmark exhibits high robustness with prediction variations under different prompts remaining... | Junyu Luo, Zhizhuo Kou, Liming Yang, Xiao Luo, Jinsheng Huang, Zhiping Xiao, Jingshu Peng, Chengzhong Liu, Jiaming Ji, Xuanzhe Liu, Sirui Han, Ming Zhang, Yike Guo |  |

Existing ASR systems mainly cover the modern standard Arabic (MSA) variety and few high-resource dialects, but fall short in coverage and generalization across the multitude of spoken variants. Code-switching with English and French is also common in different regions of the Arab world, which challenges the performance of monolingual Arabic models. In this work, we introduce a suite of ASR models optimized to effectively recognize multiple variants of spoken Arabic, including MSA, various dialects, and code-switching. We provide open-source pre-trained models that cover data from 17 Arabic-speaking countries, and fine-tuned MSA and dialectal ASR models that include at least 11 variants, as well as multi-lingual ASR models covering embedded languages in code-switched utterances.

This trend highlights the need for a comprehensive framework to verify text-guided edits and assess their quality. To address this need, we introduce EditInspector, a novel benchmark for evaluation of text-guided image edits, based on human annotations collected using an extensive template for edit verification. We leverage EditInspector to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art (SoTA) vision and language models in assessing edits across various dimensions, including accuracy, artifact detection, visual quality, seamless integration with the image scene, adherence to common sense, and the ability to describe edit-induced changes. Our findings indicate that current models struggle to evaluate edits comprehensively and frequently hallucinate when describing the changes. To address these challenges, we propose two novel methods that outperform SoTA models in both artifact... | Ron Yosef, Yonatan Bitton, Dani Lischinski, Moran Yanuka |  |

While numerous UE methods have been proposed, most existing studies evaluate them in isolated short-form QA settings using threshold-independent metrics such as AUROC or PRR. However, real-world deployment of UE methods introduces several challenges. In this work, we systematically examine four key aspects of deploying UE methods in practical settings. Specifically, we assess (1) the sensitivity of UE methods to decision threshold selection, (2) their robustness to query transformations such as typos, adversarial prompts, and prior chat history, (3) their applicability to long-form generation, and (4) strategies for handling multiple UE scores for a single query. Our evaluations on 19 UE methods reveal that most of them are highly sensitive to threshold selection when there is a distribution shift in the calibration dataset.

Existing approaches typically separate the optimization of prompt instructions and in-context learning examples, leading to incohesive, suboptimal results. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Cohesive In-Context Prompt Optimization framework that refines both prompt instructions and examples. In our formulation, coherence refers to the degree to which instructions and examples work synergistically to improve task performance—emerging as a byproduct of performance-driven optimization. However, formulating such an optimization in the discrete and high-dimensional space of natural language poses significant challenges in both convergence and computational efficiency. To address these issues, we introduce SEE, a scalable and efficient prompt optimization framework that adopts metaheuristic optimization principles and strategically... | Wendi Cui, Jiaxin Zhang, Zhuohang Li, Hao Sun, Damien Lopez, Kamalika Das, Bradley A.

While LLMs have been effective for code generation, recent work has shown that PBE is challenging but improvable by fine-tuning, especially with training data drawn from the same distribution as evaluation data. In this paper, we create a conceptual framework of what constitutes a “similar distribution” for SLI and propose four kinds of synthetic data generation methods with varying amounts of inductive bias to investigate what leads to the best performance. Based on the results, we create a SOTA open-source model for SLI as PBE (+6% pass rate with a third of the parameters of... | Atharva Naik, Darsh Agrawal, Hong Sng, Clayton Marr, Kexun Zhang, Nathaniel Romney Robinson, Kalvin Chang, Rebecca Byrnes, Aravind Mysore, Carolyn P.

Often overlooked, episodes represent cohesive clusters of core entities performing actions at a specific time and location; a partially ordered sequence of episodes can represent a key event. This paper introduces a novel task, \*\*episode detection\*\*, which identifies episodes within a news corpus of key event articles. Detecting episodes poses unique challenges, as they lack explicit temporal or locational markers and cannot be merged using semantic similarity alone. While large language models (LLMs) can aid with these reasoning difficulties, they suffer with long contexts typical of news corpora. To address these challenges, we introduce \*\*EpiMine\*\*, an unsupervised framework that identifies a key event’s candidate episodes by leveraging natural episodic partitions in articles, estimated through... | Priyanka Kargupta, Yunyi Zhang, Yizhu Jiao, Siru Ouyang, Jiawei Han |  |

However, a claim (e.g., “vaccine A is better than vaccine B”) can be dissected into its integral aspects and sub-aspects (e.g., efficacy, safety, distribution), which are individually easier to validate. This enables a more comprehensive, structured response that provides a well-rounded perspective on a given problem while also allowing the reader to prioritize specific angles of interest within the claim (e.g., safety towards children). Thus, we propose ClaimSpect, a retrieval-augmented generation-based framework for automatically constructing a hierarchy of aspects typically considered when addressing a claim and enriching them with corpus-specific perspectives. This structure hierarchically partitions an input corpus to retrieve relevant segments, which assist in discovering new sub-aspects.... | Priyanka Kargupta, Runchu Tian, Jiawei Han |  |

This enhanced ability to interact with external systems and process various data sources, while powerful, introduces significant security vulnerabilities. In particular, indirect prompt injection attacks pose a critical threat, where malicious instructions embedded within external data sources can manipulate agents to deviate from user intentions. While existing defenses show promise, they struggle to maintain robust security while preserving task functionality. We propose a novel and orthogonal perspective that reframes agent security from preventing harmful actions to ensuring task alignment, requiring every agent action to serve user objectives. Based on this insight, we develop Task Shield, a test-time defense mechanism that systematically verifies whether each instruction and tool call contributes to user-specified... | Feiran Jia, Tong Wu, Xin Qin, Anna Cinzia Squicciarini |  |

Yet recent theoretical work argues that any watermark can be erased via random walk attacks that perturb text while preserving quality. However, such attacks rely on two key assumptions: (1) rapid mixing (watermarks dissolve quickly under perturbations) and (2) reliable quality preservation (automated quality oracles perfectly guide edits). Through large-scale experiments and human-validated assessments, we find mixing is slow: 100% of perturbed texts retain traces of their origin after hundreds of edits, defying rapid mixing. Oracles falter, as state-of-the-art quality detectors misjudge edits (77% accuracy), compounding errors during attacks. Ultimately, attacks underperform: automated walks remove watermarks just 26% of the time – dropping to 10% under human quality review. These findings challenge the inevitability of watermark removal. Instead, practical barriers – slow mixing and imperfect quality control – reveal... | Fabrice HarelCanada, Boran Erol, Connor Choi, Jason Liu, Gary Jiarui Song, Nanyun Peng, Amit Sahai |  |

However, most existing methods and datasets remain focused on a narrow spectrum of tasks, such as forecasting or anomaly detection. To bridge this gap, we introduce Time Series Multi-Task Question Answering (Time-MQA), a unified framework that enables natural language queries across multiple time series tasks - numerical analytical tasks and open-ended question answering with reasoning. Central to Time-MQA is the TSQA dataset, a large-scale dataset containing ~200k question-answer pairs derived from diverse time series spanning environment, traffic, etc. This comprehensive resource covers various time series lengths and promotes robust model development. We further demonstrate how continually pre-training large language models (Mistral 7B, Llama-3 8B, and Qwen-2.5 7B) on the TSQA dataset enhanced time series reasoning capabilities, moving beyond mere numeric tasks and enabling more advanced and intuitive... | Yaxuan Kong, Yiyuan Yang, Yoontae Hwang, Wenjie Du, Stefan Zohren, Zhangyang Wang, Ming Jin, Qingsong Wen |  |

However, existing methodologies often struggle to accurately extract this contextual relevance from images. To address this challenge, we introduce GETREASON (Geospatial Event Temporal Reasoning), a framework designed to go beyond surfacelevel image descriptions and infer deeper contextual meaning. We hypothesize that extracting global event, temporal, and geospatial information from an image enables a more accurate understanding of its contextual significance. We also introduce a new metric GREAT (Geospatial, Reasoning and Event Accuracy with Temporal alignment) for a reasoning capturing evaluation. Our layered multi-agentic approach, evaluated using a reasoning-weighted metric, demonstrates that meaningful information can be inferred from images, allowing them to be effectively linked to their corresponding events and broader contextual... | Shikhhar Siingh, Abhinav Rawat, Chitta Baral, Vivek Gupta |  |

In these pivotal moments, how one responds can put the conversation on substantially different trajectories leading to significantly different outcomes. Systems that can detect when such moments arise could assist conversationalists in domains with highly consequential outcomes, such as mental health crisis counseling.In this work, we introduce an unsupervised computational method for detecting such pivotal moments as they happen. The intuition is that a moment is pivotal if our expectation of the conversation’s outcome varies widely depending on what might be said next. By applying our method to crisis counseling conversations, we first validate it by showing that it aligns with human perception—counselors take significantly longer to respond during moments detected by our method—and with the eventual conversational trajectory—which is more likely to change course at these times. We then use... | Vivian Nguyen, Lillian Lee, Cristian DanescuNiculescuMizil |  |

These explorations have endowed BERT-family with new roles and human expectations, showcasing their potential on par with current state-of-the-art (SOTA) large language models (LLMs). However, several certain shortcomings in previous BERT-family, such as the relatively sub-optimal training corpora, learning procedure, and model architecture, all impede the further advancement of these models for serving as general and competitive LLMs. Therefore, we aim to address these deficiencies in this paper. Our study not only introduces a more suitable pre-training task that helps BERT-family excel in wider applications to realize generality but also explores the integration of cutting-edge technologies into our model to further enhance their capabilities. Our final models, termed... | Yisheng Xiao, Juntao Li, Wenpeng Hu, Zhunchen Luo, Min Zhang |  |

While expert-curated taxonomies have traditionally addressed this need, the process is time-consuming and expensive. Furthermore, recent automatic taxonomy construction methods either (1) over-rely on a specific corpus, sacrificing generalizability, or (2) depend heavily on the general knowledge of large language models (LLMs) contained within their pre-training datasets, often overlooking the dynamic nature of evolving scientific domains. Additionally, these approaches fail to account for the multi-faceted nature of scientific literature, where a single research paper may contribute to multiple dimensions (e.g., methodology, new tasks, evaluation metrics, benchmarks). To address these gaps, we propose TaxoAdapt, a framework that dynamically adapts an LLM-generated taxonomy to a given corpus across multiple dimensions. TaxoAdapt performs iterative hierarchical... | Priyanka Kargupta, Nan Zhang, Yunyi Zhang, Rui Zhang, Prasenjit Mitra, Jiawei Han |  |

These models have recently demonstrated impressive performance in varied generation tasks, surpassing the autoregressive Transformer. However, they also face several challenges that impede further development. In this work, we target building more efficient and competitive iterative NAR models. Firstly, we produce two simple metrics to identify the potential problems existing in current refinement processes, and look back on the various iterative NAR models to find the key factors for realizing our purpose. Subsequently, based on the analyses of the limitations of previous inference algorithms, we propose a simple yet effective strategy to conduct efficient refinements without performance declines. Experiments on five widely used datasets show that our final models set the new state-of-the-art performance... | Yisheng Xiao, Pei Guo, Zechen Sun, Juntao Li, Kai Song, Min Zhang |  |

This default choice typically results in degraded efficiency and language capabilities, especially in languages other than English. To address this issue, we challenge the static design and propose retrofitting LMs with dynamic tokenization: a way to dynamically decide on token boundaries based on the input text via a subword-merging algorithm inspired by byte-pair encoding. We merge frequent subword sequences in a batch, then apply a pre-trained embedding-prediction hypernetwork to compute the token embeddings on-the-fly. For encoder-style models (e.g., XLM-R), this on average reduces token sequence lengths by >20% across 14 languages while degrading performance by less than 2%. The same method applied to pre-filling and scoring in decoder-style models (e.g., Mistral-7B) results in minimal performance degradation at up to 17% reduction in sequence length. Overall, we find that dynamic tokenization can mitigate the... | Darius Feher, Ivan Vulic, Benjamin Minixhofer |  |

This hinders their ability to cover diverse source material in multi-document summarization, as noted in the DiverseSumm benchmark (Huang et al., 2024). In this work, we contend that principled content selection is a simple way to increase source coverage on this task. As opposed to prompting an LLM to perform the summarization in a single step, we explicitly divide the task into three steps—(1) reducing document collections to atomic key points, (2) using determinantal point processes (DPP) to perform select key points that prioritize diverse content, and (3) rewriting to the final summary. By combining prompting steps, for extraction and rewriting, with principled techniques, for content selection, we consistently improve source... | Vishakh Padmakumar, Zichao Wang, David Arbour, Jennifer Healey |  |

In this paper, we investigate ZSSD within a bilingual framework and compare it with cross-lingual and monolingual scenarios, in settings that have not previously been explored. Our study focuses on both noun-phrase and claim targets within in-domain and out-of-domain bilingual ZSSD scenarios. To support this research, we assemble Bi-STANCE, a comprehensive bilingual ZSSD dataset consisting of over 100,000 annotated text-target pairs in both Chinese and English, sourced from existing datasets. Additionally, we examine a more challenging aspect of bilingual ZSSD by focusing on claim targets with a low occurrence of shared words with their corresponding texts. As part of Bi-STANCE, we created an extended dataset that emphasizes this challenging scenario. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore this difficult... | Chenye Zhao, Cornelia Caragea |  |

GrammaMT proposes three prompting strategies: gloss-shot, chain-gloss and model-gloss. All are training-free, requiring only a few examples that involve minimal effort to collect, and making them well-suited for low-resource setups. Experiments show that GrammaMT enhances translation performance on open-source instruction-tuned LLMs for various low- to high-resource languages across three benchmarks: (1) the largest IGT corpus, (2) the challenging 2023 SIGMORPHON Shared Task data over endangered languages, and (3) even in an out-of-domain setting with FLORES. Moreover, ablation studies reveal that leveraging gloss resources could substantially boost MT performance (by over 17 BLEU points) if LLMs accurately generate or access input sentence glosses. | Rita Ramos, Everlyn Asiko Chimoto, Maartje ter Hoeve, Natalie Schluter |  |

However, ensuring the validity of intermediate reasoning steps remains a significant challenge, affecting data quality. While formal verification via theorem provers effectively validates LLM reasoning, the autoformalisation of mathematical proofs remains error-prone. In response, we introduce \*iterative autoformalisation\*, an approach that iteratively refines theorem prover formalisation to mitigate errors, thereby increasing the execution rate on the Lean prover from 60% to 87%. Building upon that, we introduce \*Theorem Prover as a Judge (TP-as-a-Judge)\*, a method that employs theorem prover formalisation to rigorously assess LLM intermediate reasoning, effectively integrating autoformalisation with synthetic data generation. Finally, we present \*Reinforcement Learning from Theorem Prover Feedback (RLTPF),\* a... | Joshua Ong Jun Leang, Giwon Hong, Wenda Li, Shay B. Cohen |  |

In order to process the speech, it is commonly transcribed using automatic speech recognition technology. This speech-to-text transition introduces errors into the transcripts, which subsequently propagate to downstream NLP tasks, such as dialogue summarization. While it is known that transcript noise affects downstream tasks, a general-purpose and systematic approach to analyzing its effects across different noise severities and types has not been addressed. We propose a configurable framework for assessing task models in diverse noisy settings, and for examining the impact of transcript-cleaning techniques. The framework facilitates the investigation of task model behavior, which can in turn support the development of effective SLU solutions. We exemplify the utility of our framework on three SLU tasks and four task models, offering insights... | Ori Shapira, Shlomo E. Chazan, Amir David Nissan Cohen |  |

For this, we develop a dataset with both formal and material inferences, containing logically equivalent pairs of inferences with conclusions that favor either the political left or the political right. This allows us to focus on political bias as a source of decrease in performance. Our samples are synthetically generated and thus highly controlled, covering both English and German. We assess the performance of 16 configurations of both open and proprietary state-of-the-art LLMs on that dataset, finding generally unreliable performance as well as widespread political bias which, in the case of the English samples, persists throughout our experimental settings. | Reto Gubelmann, Ghassen Karray |  |

This study presents a pioneering work in developing the first parallel corpora for eight severely under-resourced varieties in the region–PARME, addressing fundamental challenges in low-resource scenarios including non-standardized writing and dialectal complexity. Through an extensive community-driven initiative, volunteers contributed to the creation of over 36,000 translated sentences, marking a significant milestone in resource development. We evaluate machine translation capabilities through zero-shot approaches and fine-tuning experiments with pretrained machine translation models and provide a comprehensive analysis of limitations. Our findings reveal significant gaps in existing technologies for processing the selected languages, highlighting critical areas for improvement in language technology for Middle... | Sina Ahmadi, Rico Sennrich, Erfan Karami, Ako Marani, Parviz Fekrazad, Gholamreza Akbarzadeh Baghban, Hanah Hadi, Semko Heidari, Mahîr Dogan, Pedram Asadi, Dashne Bashir, Mohammad Amin Ghodrati, Kourosh Amini, Zeynab Ashourinezhad, Mana Baladi, Farshid Ezzati, Alireza Ghasemifar, Daryoush Hosseinpour, Behrooz Abbaszadeh, Amin Hassanpour, Bahaddin Jalal Hamaamin, Saya Kamal Hama, Ardeshir Mousavi, Sarko Nazir Hussein, Isar Nejadgholi, Mehmet Ölmez, Horam Osmanpour, Rashid Roshan Ramezani, Aryan Sediq Aziz, Ali Salehi, Mohammadreza Yadegari, Kewyar Yadegari, Sedighe Zamani Roodsari |  |

It has great potential to empower the automatic professional report generation in financial analysis, research presentation, education, and healthcare. In this work, we build a vision-language model (VLM) based multi-agent framework for effective automatic chart generation. Generating high-quality charts requires both strong visual design skills and precise coding capabilities that embed the desired visual properties into code. Such a complex multi-modal reasoning process is difficult for direct prompting of VLMs. To resolve these challenges, we propose METAL, a multi-agent framework that decomposes the task of chart generation into the iterative collaboration among specialized agents. METAL achieves a 5.2% improvement in the F1 score over the current best result in the chart generation task. Additionally, METAL improves chart generation performance... | Bingxuan Li, Yiwei Wang, Jiuxiang Gu, KaiWei Chang, Nanyun Peng |  |

This paper introduces ConLoan–a novel contrastive dataset comprising sentences with and without loanwords across 10 languages. Through systematic evaluation using this dataset, we investigate how state-of-the-art machine translation and language models process loanwords compared to their native alternatives. Our experiments reveal that these systems show systematic preferences for loanwords over native terms and exhibit varying performance across languages. These findings provide valuable insights for developing more linguistically robust NLP systems. | Sina Ahmadi, Micha David Hess, Elena Álvarez Mellado, Alessia Battisti, Cui Ding, Anne Göhring, Yingqiang Gao, Zifan Jiang, Andrianos Michail, Peshmerge Morad, Joel Niklaus, Maria Christina Panagiotopoulou, Stefano Perrella, Juri Opitz, Anastassia Shaitarova, Rico Sennrich |  |

However, the heuristics that guide this sampling process remain under-explored. We study this sampling behavior and show that this underlying heuristics resembles that of human decision-making: comprising a descriptive component (reflecting statistical norm) and a prescriptive component (implicit ideal encoded in the LLM) of a concept. We show that this deviation of a sample from the statistical norm towards a prescriptive component consistently appears in concepts across diverse real-world domains like public health, and economic trends. To further illustrate the theory, we demonstrate that concept prototypes in LLMs are affected by prescriptive norms, similar to the concept of normality in humans. Through case studies and comparison with human studies, we illustrate that in real-world applications, the shift of samples toward an ideal value in... | Sarath Sivaprasad, Pramod Kaushik, Sahar Abdelnabi, Mario Fritz |  |

Although backdoor-based fingerprinting has emerged as a promising solution for model authentication, effective attacks for removing these fingerprints remain largely unexplored. Therefore, We present Mismatched Eraser (MEraser), a novel method for effectively removing backdoor-based fingerprints from LLMs while maintaining model performance. Our approach leverages a two-phase fine-tuning strategy utilizing carefully constructed mismatched and clean datasets. Through extensive evaluation across multiple LLM architectures and fingerprinting methods, we demonstrate that MEraser achieves complete fingerprinting removal while maintaining model performance with minimal training data of fewer than 1,000 samples. Furthermore, we introduce a transferable erasure mechanism that enables effective fingerprinting removal... | Jingxuan Zhang, Zhenhua Xu, Rui Hu, Wenpeng Xing, Xuhong Zhang, Meng Han |  |

However, existing approaches in RAG primarily link generated content to document-level references, making it challenging for users to locate evidence among multiple content-rich retrieved documents. To address this challenge, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Visual Source Attribution (VISA), a novel approach that combines answer generation with visual source attribution. Leveraging large vision-language models (VLMs), VISA identifies the evidence and highlights the exact regions that support the generated answers with bounding boxes in the retrieved document screenshots. To evaluate its effectiveness, we curated two datasets: Wiki-VISA, based on crawled Wikipedia webpage screenshots, and Paper-VISA, derived from PubLayNet and tailored to the medical domain. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of VISA for visual source attribution... | Xueguang Ma, Shengyao Zhuang, Bevan Koopman, Guido Zuccon, Wenhu Chen, Jimmy Lin |  |

But what is the nature of their errors, and do these errors exhibit any regularities? In this work, we examine irrelevant context hallucinations, in which models integrate misleading contextual cues into their predictions. Through behavioral analysis, we show that these errors result from a structured yet flawed mechanism that we term _class-based (mis)generalization_, in which models combine abstract class cues with features extracted from the query or context to derive answers. Furthermore, mechanistic interpretability experiments on Llama-3, Mistral, and Pythia across 39 factual recall relation types reveal that this behavior is reflected in the model’s internal computations: (i) abstract class representations are constructed in lower layers before being refined into... | Ziling Cheng, Meng Cao, MarcAntoine Rondeau, Jackie CK Cheung |  |

Specifically, we develop a new paradigm of Multi-Agent Post-co-training for collaborative LLMs with Reinforcement Learning (MAPoRL). In MAPoRL, multiple LLMs first generate their own responses and engage in discussions to collaboratively enhance the final response output; the final output is then scored by a verifier, where the scores serve as the reward and is maximized through multi-agent RL. Additionally, MAPoRL also reshapes the reward above with additional incentives to encourage corrective and persuasive outputs in the discussions. A key novelty from most existing LLM post-training paradigms is the advocacy of co-training multiple LLMs... | Chanwoo Park, Seungju Han, Xingzhi Guo, Asuman E.

Existing methods often overlook what complex information to extract and how to infer it from text. We present Map&Make, a versatile approach that decomposes text into atomic propositions to infer latent schemas, which are then used to generate tables capturing both qualitative nuances and quantitative facts. We evaluate our method on three challenging datasets: Rotowire, known for its complex, multi-table schema; Livesum which requires numerical aggregation; and Wiki40 which require open text extraction from mulitple domains. By correcting hallucination errors in Rotowire, we also provide a cleaner benchmark. Our method shows significant gains in both accuracy and interpretability across comprehensive comparative and referenceless metrics.

We hypothesize that this issue arises because existing VLMs are not explicitly trained to generate texts that are accurately grounded in fine-grained image details. To enhance visual feedback during VLM training, we propose S-VCO (Symmetrical Visual Contrastive Optimization), a novel finetuning objective that steers the model toward capturing important visual details and aligning them with corresponding text tokens. To further facilitate this detailed alignment, we introduce MVC, a paired image-text dataset built by automatically filtering and augmenting visual counterfactual data to challenge the model with hard contrastive cases involving Minimal Visual Contrasts. Experiments show that our method consistently improves VLM performance across diverse benchmarks covering various... | Shengguang Wu, FanYun Sun, Kaiyue Wen, Nick Haber |  |

ARM: An Alignment-Oriented LLM-based Retrieval Method](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.1463/) |  | 0 | Real-world open-domain questions can be complex, especially when answering them requires integrating information from multiple sources. Effectively identifying the necessary information involves \*aligning\* it with the available data and its organization. However, existing RAG solutions address the alignment problem in a limited manner. Using off-the-shelf LLMs for question decomposition lacks awareness of the available data and its structure, often resulting in suboptimal retrieval performance. Alternatively, iteratively generating follow-up queries and interacting with the data collection, as explored in agentic RAG approaches, shows potential but is often \*inefficient\* since each successive query depends on previous results rather than being guided by the overall organization of the available data. To address the \*alignment\* problem, we introduce an LLM-based retrieval method — ARM, designed to better align questions with the organization of the data collection.

Current models often struggle with efficient navigation and action execution due to limited visibility and understanding of web structures. Our proposed R2D2 framework addresses these challenges by integrating two paradigms: Remember and Reflect. The Remember paradigm utilizes a replay buffer that aids agents in reconstructing the web environment dynamically, thus enabling the formulation of a detailed “map” of previously visited pages. This helps in reducing navigational errors and optimizing the decision-making process during web interactions. Conversely, the Reflect paradigm allows agents to learn from past mistakes by providing a mechanism for error analysis and strategy refinement, enhancing overall task performance. We evaluate R2D2 using the WEBARENA benchmark, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods, including a 50% reduction in... | Tenghao Huang, Kinjal Basu, Ibrahim Abdelaziz, Pavan Kapanipathi, Jonathan May, Muhao Chen |  |

To address this gap, we introduce INDIC-BIAS, a comprehensive India-centric benchmark designed to evaluate fairness of LLMs across 85 identity groups encompassing diverse castes, religions, regions, and tribes. We first consult domain experts to curate over 1,800 socio-cultural topics spanning behaviors and situations, where biases and stereotypes are likely to emerge. Grounded in these topics, we generate and manually validate 20,000 real-world scenario templates to probe LLMs for fairness. We structure these templates into three evaluation tasks: plausibility, judgment, and generation. Our evaluation of 14 popular LLMs on these tasks reveals strong negative biases against marginalized identities, with models frequently reinforcing common stereotypes. Additionally, we find that models struggle to mitigate bias even when explicitly asked to rationalize their... | Janki Atul Nawale, Mohammed Safi Ur Rahman Khan, Janani D, Mansi Gupta, Danish Pruthi, Mitesh M.

Moving beyond popular voice understanding metrics such as word error rate (WER), SIQ examines LLM_Voice across three cognitive levels motivated by Bloom’s Taxonomy: (1) Remembering (i.e., WER for verbatim accuracy); (2) Understanding (i.e., similarity of LLM’s interpretations); and (3) Application (i.e., QA accuracy for simulating downstream tasks). We demonstrate that SIQ not only quantifies voice understanding abilities but also provides unified comparisons between cascaded methods (e.g., ASR-LLM) and end-to-end models, identifies annotation errors in existing benchmarks, and detects hallucinations in LLM_Voice. Our framework represents a first-of-its-kind intelligence examination that bridges cognitive principles with voice-oriented benchmarks, while... | Zhen Wan, ChaoHan Huck Yang, Yahan Yu, Jinchuan Tian, Sheng Li, Ke Hu, Zhehuai Chen, Shinji Watanabe, Fei Cheng, Chenhui Chu, Sadao Kurohashi |  |

Transforming these into Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) improves understanding of individual steps by identifying predicate-argument structure like verb,what,where/with. Procedural instructions are highly elliptic, for instance, (i) add cucumber to the bowl and (ii) add sliced tomatoes, the second step’s where argument is inferred from the context, referring to where the cucumber was placed. Prior SRL benchmarks often miss implicit arguments, leading to incomplete understanding. To address this, we introduce Implicit-VidSRL, a dataset that necessitates inferring implicit and explicit arguments from contextual information in multimodal cooking procedures. Our proposed dataset benchmarks multimodal models’ contextual reasoning, requiring entity tracking through visual changes in recipes. We study recent multimodal LLMs and reveal that they struggle to predict implicit arguments of what and where/with from... | Anil Batra, Laura SevillaLara, Marcus Rohrbach, Frank Keller |  |

Prompt guard models, though effective in defense, suffer from over-defense—falsely flagging benign inputs as malicious due to trigger word bias. To address this issue, we introduce NotInject, an evaluation dataset that systematically measures over-defense across various prompt guard models. NotInject contains 339 benign samples enriched with trigger words common in prompt injection attacks, enabling fine-grained evaluation. Our results show that state-of-the-art models suffer from over-defense issues, with accuracy dropping close to random guessing levels (60%). To mitigate this, we propose PIGuard, a novel prompt guard model that incorporates a new training strategy, Mitigating Over-defense for Free (MOF), which significantly reduces the bias on trigger words.

While progress has been made in unimodal domains like text and image classification, unlearning in multimodal models remains relatively under-explored. In this work, we address the unique challenges of unlearning in CLIP, a prominent multimodal model that aligns visual and textual representations. We introduce CLIPErase, a novel approach that disentangles and selectively forgets both visual and textual associations, ensuring that unlearning does not compromise model performance.CLIPErase consists of three key modules: a Forgetting Module that disrupts the associations in the forget set, a Retention Module that preserves performance on the retain set, and a Consistency Module that maintains consistency with the original model. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, Flickr30K, and Conceptual 12M across five CLIP downstream... | Tianyu Yang, Lisen Dai, Xiangqi Wang, Minhao Cheng, Yapeng Tian, Xiangliang Zhang |  |

Such models are useful for embodied AI and scene retrieval applications, which involve searching for objects or patterns using natural language descriptions. While recent works have focused on LLM-based scaling of 3DVG datasets, these datasets do not capture the full range of potential prompts which could be specified in the English language. To ensure that we are scaling up and testing against a useful and representative set of prompts, we propose a framework for linguistically analyzing 3DVG prompts and introduce Visual Grounding with Diverse Language in 3D (ViGiL3D), a diagnostic dataset for evaluating visual grounding methods against a diverse set of language patterns. We evaluate existing open-vocabulary 3DVG methods to demonstrate that these methods are not yet proficient in understanding and identifying the targets of more challenging, out-of-distribution prompts, toward... | Austin T.

Do these different communication channels carry distinct information? Prior work has shown that the information carried by prosodic features is substantially redundant with that carried by the surrounding words. Here, we systematically examine the time scale of this relationship, studying how it varies with the length of past and future contexts. We find that a word’s prosodic features require an extended past context (3-8 words across different features) to be reliably predicted. Given that long-scale contextual information decays in memory, prosody may facilitate communication by adding information that is locally unique. We also find that a word’s prosodic features show some redundancy with future words, but only with a short scale of 1-2 words, consistent with reports of incremental short-term... | Tamar I.

Distillation is one technique to solve this problem through either knowledge distillation or task distillation. Both distillation approaches train small models to imitate specific features of LLMs, but they all neglect basic reading education for small models on generic texts that are unrelated to downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose basic reading distillation (BRD) which educates a small model to imitate LLMs basic reading behaviors, such as named entity recognition, question raising and answering, on each sentence. After such basic education, we apply the small model on various tasks including language inference benchmarks and BIG-bench tasks. It shows that the small model can outperform or perform comparable to over 20x bigger LLMs. Analysis reveals that BRD effectively... | Zhi Zhou, Sirui Miao, Xiangyu Duan, Hao Yang, Min Zhang |  |

To bridge this gap, we presents a comprehensive investigation of uncertainty calibration for quantized LLMs in this work. Specifically, we propose an analytic method to estimate the upper bound of calibration error (UBCE) for LLMs. Our method separately discusses the calibration error of the model’s correct and incorrect predictions, indicating a theoretical improvement of calibration error caused by the weight quantization. Our study demonstrates that quantized models consistently exhibit worse calibration performance than full-precision models, supported by consistent analysis across multiple LLMs and datasets. To address the calibration issues of quantized models, we propose a novel method of post calibration for recovering the calibration performance of quantized models through soft-prompt tuning. Specifically, we... | Mingyu Zhong, Guanchu Wang, YuNeng Chuang, Na Zou |  |

An ansatz of psycholinguistics is that modeling a reader's fixations and saccades yields insight into their online sentence processing. However, standard approaches to such modeling rely on aggregated eye-tracking measurements and models that impose strong assumptions, ignoring much of the spatio-temporal dynamics that occur during reading. In this paper, we propose a more general probabilistic model of reading behavior, based on a marked spatio-temporal point process, that captures not only how long fixations last, but also where they land in space and when they take place in time. The saccades are modeled using a Hawkes process, which captures how each fixation excites the probability of a new fixation occurring near it in time and space. The duration time of fixation events... | Francesco Ignazio Re, Andreas Opedal, Glib Manaiev, Mario Giulianelli, Ryan Cotterell |  |

Enhancing Many-Shot In-Context Learning with Differentiated and Reweighting Objectives](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.1475/) |  | 0 | Large language models (LLMs) excel at few-shot in-context learning (ICL) without requiring parameter updates. However, as ICL demonstrations increase from a few to many, performance tends to plateau and eventually decline. We identify two primary causes for this trend: the suboptimal negative log-likelihood (NLL) optimization objective and the incremental data noise. To address these issues, we introduce DrICL, a novel optimization method that enhances model performance through Differentiated and Reweighting objectives. Globally, DrICL utilizes differentiated learning to optimize the NLL objective, ensuring that many-shot performance surpasses zero-shot levels. Locally, it dynamically adjusts the weighting of many-shot demonstrations by leveraging cumulative advantages inspired by reinforcement learning, thereby mitigating the impact of noisy data.Recognizing the lack of multi-task datasets with diverse many-shot distributions, we develop the Many-Shot ICL Benchmark (ICL-50)-a... | Xiaoqing Zhang, Ang Lv, Yuhan Liu, Flood Sung, Wei Liu, Jian Luan, Shuo Shang, Xiuying Chen, Rui Yan |  |

Previous studies have rarely connected the behavior of RAG through joint analysis, particularly regarding error propagation coming from imperfect retrieval and potential conflicts between LLMs’ internal knowledge and external sources. Through comprehensive and controlled analyses under realistic conditions, we find that imperfect retrieval augmentation is inevitable, common, and harmful. We identify the knowledge conflicts between LLM-internal and external knowledge from retrieval as a bottleneck to overcome imperfect retrieval in the post-retrieval stage of RAG. To address this, we propose Astute RAG, a novel RAG approach designed to be resilient to imperfect retrieval augmentation. It adaptively elicits essential information... | Fei Wang, Xingchen Wan, Ruoxi Sun, Jiefeng Chen, Sercan Ö. Arik |  |

Inspired by high-stakes competitions like the International Mathematical Olympiad-where a few well-chosen problems suffice to differentiate top performers—we present SubLIME, which reduces evaluation costs by 80% to 99% while preserving ranking fidelity. It trains a Rank Correlation Prediction (RCP) model that combines limited performance data from only 5-20 anchor LLMs with dataset intrinsic metrics - Difficulty, Quality, and Distributional Dispersion-to predict how closely a candidate subset reflects full-benchmark rankings. Guided by these predictions, SubLIME selects a “winning” subset (1-20% of full set data) for evaluating new LLMs, preserving global rankings significant better than other data-efficient methods across ten diverse benchmarks. | Gayathri Saranathan, Cong Xu, Mahammad Parwez Alam, Tarun Kumar, Martin Foltin, Soon Yee Wong, Suparna Bhattacharya |  |

However, most previous benchmarks are template-based and primarily focus on few-entity queries, which are monotypic and simplistic, failing to offer comprehensive and robust assessments. Besides, the lack of ground-truth reasoning paths also hinders the assessments of different components in GraphRAG systems. To address these limitations, we propose M³GQA, a complex, diverse, and high-quality GraphRAG benchmark focusing on multi-entity queries, with six distinct settings for comprehensive evaluation. In order to construct diverse data with semantically correct ground-truth reasoning paths, we introduce a novel reasoning-driven four-step data construction method, including tree sampling, reasoning path backtracking, query creation, and multi-stage refinement and filtering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that M³GQA effectively reflects the... | Boci Peng, Yongchao Liu, Xiaohe Bo, Jiaxin Guo, Yun Zhu, Xuanbo Fan, Chuntao Hong, Yan Zhang |  |

Meanwhile, existing safety alignment methods predominantly rely on the fine-tuning process, which inadvertently leads to the increased complexity and computational resources required. To address these issues, we introduce LSSF, a novel safety re-alignment framework with Low-Rank Safety Subspace Fusison. Our proposed method exploits the low-rank characteristics of safety information in LLMs by constructing a low-rank projection matrix to extract the principal components of safety vectors. Notably, this projection matrix represents the low-rank safety subspace of the LLMs, which we have observed to remain stable during fine-tuning process and is isolated from the model’s general capabilities. These principal components are used to effectively restore safety alignment when combined with fine-tuned LLMs... | Guanghao Zhou, Panjia Qiu, Cen Chen, Hongyu Li, Jason Chu, Xin Zhang, Jun Zhou |  |

However, LLMs are prone to hallucination—outputs that stray from intended meanings. Detecting hallucinations in code summarisation is especially difficult due to the complex interplay between programming and natural languages. We introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset, CodeSumEval, with ~10K samples, curated specifically for hallucination detection in code summarisation. We further propose a novel Entity Tracing Framework (ETF) that a) utilises static program analysis to identify code entities from the program and b) uses LLMs to map and verify these entities and their intents within generated code summaries. Our experimental analysis demonstrates the framework’s effectiveness, leading to a 73% F1 score.

Equipped with fixed tool sets, LLMs struggle with addressing diverse user inquiries in open-world tasks. To evaluate and boost the performance of LLMs in dealing with complex demands in the real-world, we propose open-world function calling, where LLMs need to retrieve suitable tools from a pre-defined external tool library and use retrieved tools to resolve the user’s problem. We introduce Meta-Tool, a versatile and plug-and-play tool retrieval system as the access of LLMs to external tool library. Drawing inspiration from the myriad of enhanced approaches associated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Meta-Tool employs a hypothesize-retrieve-invoke framework. We further propose Meta-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs in open-world function calling and associated tasks.

Despite great success, recent studies show that LVLMs encounter substantial limitations when engaging with visual graphs. To study the reason behind these limitations, we propose VGCure, a comprehensive benchmark covering 22 tasks for examining the fundamental graph understanding and reasoning capacities of LVLMs. Extensive evaluations conducted on 14 LVLMs reveal that LVLMs are weak in basic graph understanding and reasoning tasks, particularly those concerning relational or structurally complex information. Based on this observation, we propose a structure-aware fine-tuning framework to enhance LVLMs with structure learning abilities through three self-supervised learning tasks. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our method in improving LVLMs’ performance on fundamental and downstream graph learning tasks, as well as enhancing their robustness against complex visual graphs. | Yingjie Zhu, Xuefeng Bai, Kehai Chen, Yang Xiang, Jun Yu, Min Zhang |  |

Unlike conventional visual grounding tasks that use referring expressions (REs) as inputs, entity grounding relies solely on entity names and types, presenting a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce a novel \*\*I\*\*terative \*\*S\*\*elf-\*\*R\*\*efinement (\*\*ISR\*\*) scheme to enhance the multimodal large language model’s capability to generate high quality REs for the given entities as explicit contextual clues. This training scheme, inspired by human learning dynamics and human annotation processes, enables the MLLM to iteratively generate and refine REs by learning from successes and failures, guided by outcome rewards from a visual grounding model. This iterative cycle of self-refinement avoids overfitting to fixed annotations and fosters continued improvement in referring expression generation.

Inspired by the concept of a visual region in the human brain, we investigate the existence of an analogous visual region within LLMs that functions as a cognitive core, and explore the potential of efficient training of LVLMs via selective layers tuning. Using Bunny-Llama-3-8B-V for detailed analysis and other three LVLMs for validation across diverse visual and textual tasks, we find that selectively updating 25% of LLMs layers, when sparsely and uniformly distributed, can preserve nearly 99% of visual performance and maintain or improve textual task results, while effectively reducing training time. Based on this targeted training approach, we further propose a novel visual region-based pruning paradigm, removing non-critical layers outside the visual region, which can achieve minimal performance loss.

Nevertheless, the current studies are limited to a single scenario, either cross-lingual or cross-modal, leaving a gap in the exploration of hallucinations in the joint cross-lingual and cross-modal scenarios. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel joint Cross-lingual and Cross-modal Hallucinations benchmark (CCHall) to fill this gap. Specifically, CCHall simultaneously incorporates both cross-lingual and cross-modal hallucination scenarios, which can be used to assess the cross-lingual and cross-modal capabilities of LLMs. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation on CCHall, exploring both mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs. The experimental results highlight that current LLMs still struggle with CCHall. We hope CCHall can serve as a valuable resource to assess LLMs in joint... | Yongheng Zhang, Xu Liu, Ruoxi Zhou, Qiguang Chen, Hao Fei, Wenpeng Lu, Libo Qin |  |

This work introduces a novel, linearly scaling approach, TestNUC, that improves test-time predictions by leveraging the local consistency of neighboring unlabeled data-it classifies an input instance by considering not only the model’s prediction on that instance but also on neighboring unlabeled instances. We evaluate TestNUC across eight diverse datasets, spanning intent classification, topic mining, domain discovery, and emotion detection, demonstrating its consistent superiority over baseline methods such as standard prompting and self-consistency. Furthermore, TestNUC can be seamlessly integrated with existing test-time computing approaches, substantially boosting their performance. Our analysis reveals that TestNUC scales effectively with increasing amounts of unlabeled data and performs robustly across... | Henry Peng Zou, Zhengyao Gu, Yue Zhou, Yankai Chen, Weizhi Zhang, Liancheng Fang, Yibo Wang, Yangning Li, Kay Liu, Philip S.

Neural coding models generally process entire discharge summaries, which are often lengthy and contain information that is not relevant to coding. We propose an approach that combines Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Assertion Classification (AC) to filter for clinically important content before supervised code prediction. On MIMIC-IV, a standard evaluation dataset, our approach achieves near-equivalent performance to a state-of-the-art full-text baseline while using only 22% of the content and reducing training time by over half. Additionally, mapping model attention to complete entity spans yields coherent, clinically meaningful explanations, capturing coding-relevant modifiers such as acuity and laterality.

However, real-world detection requires interprocedural analysis, as vulnerabilities often emerge through multi-hop function calls rather than isolated functions. While repository-level benchmarks like ReposVul and VulEval introduce interprocedural context, they remain computationally expensive, lack pairwise evaluation of vulnerability fixes, and explore limited context retrieval, limiting their practicality.We introduce JITVul, a JIT vulnerability detection benchmark linking each function to its vulnerability-introducing and fixing commits. Built from 879 CVEs spanning 91 vulnerability types, JITVul enables comprehensive evaluation of detection capabilities. Our results show that ReAct Agents, leveraging thought-action-observation and interprocedural context, perform better than LLMs in distinguishing vulnerable from benign code.

However, this paradigm heavily relies on resource-intensive and inflexible fine-tuning from scratch with new multimodal data. In this paper, we propose MMER (Multi-modality Expansion and Retention), a training-free approach that integrates existing MLLMs for effective multimodal expansion while retaining their original performance. Specifically, MMER reuses MLLMs’ multimodal encoders while merging their LLM parameters. By comparing original and merged LLM parameters, MMER generates binary masks to approximately separate LLM parameters for each modality. These decoupled parameters can independently process modality-specific inputs, reducing parameter conflicts and preserving original MLLMs’ fidelity. MMER can also mitigate catastrophic forgetting by applying a similar process to MLLMs fine-tuned on... | Junlin Li, Guodong Du, Jing Li, Sim Kuan Goh, Wenya Wang, Yequan Wang, Fangming Liu, HoKin Tang, Saleh Alharbi, Daojing He, Min Zhang |  |

While existing Lifelong Knowledge Editing (LKE) methods efficiently update sequentially incoming edits, they often struggle to precisely overwrite the outdated knowledge with the latest one, resulting in conflicts that hinder LLMs from determining the correct answer. To address this Serial Lifelong Knowledge Editing (sLKE) problem, wepropose a novel Mixture-of-Knowledge-Experts scheme with an Activation-guided Routing Mechanism (ARM), which assigns specialized experts to store domain-specific knowledge and ensures that each update completely overwrites old information with the latest data. Furthermore, we introduce a novel sLKE benchmark where answers to the same concept are updated repeatedly, to assess the ability of editing methods to refresh knowledge accurately. Experimental results on both LKE and sLKE benchmarks show that our ARM performs favorably against SOTA knowledge editing methods. | YuJu Cheng, YuChu Yu, KaiPo Chang, YuChiang Frank Wang |  |

However, the current LLM post-training paradigm faces significant data challenges, including the high costs of manual annotation and diminishing marginal returns on data scales. Therefore, achieving data-efficient post-training has become a key research question. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey of data-efficient LLM post-training from a data-centric perspective. We propose a taxonomy of data-efficient LLM post-training methods, covering data selection, data quality enhancement, synthetic data generation, data distillation and compression, and self-evolving data ecosystems.

However, these methods struggle to generalize to real-world scenarios, where questionable information spans diverse domains and is often modality-incomplete due to factors such as upload degradation or missing metadata. To address these challenges, we introduce two real-world multi-domain news video benchmarks that reflect modality incompleteness and propose IMOL, an incomplete-modality-tolerant learning framework for multi-domain fake news video detection. Inspired by cognitive theories suggesting that humans infer missing modalities through cross-modal guidance and retrieve relevant knowledge from memory for reference, IMOL employs a hierarchical transferable information integration strategy.

While recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled various medical educational applications, these systems often provide direct answers that could reduce students’ cognitive engagement and lead to fragmented learning. Motivated by these challenges, we propose DDxTutor, a framework that follows differential diagnosis principles to decompose clinical reasoning into teachable components. It consists of a structured reasoning module that analyzes clinical clues and synthesizes diagnostic conclusions, and an interactive dialogue framework that guides students through this process. To enable such tutoring, we construct DDxReasoning, a dataset of 933 clinical cases with fine-grained diagnostic steps verified by doctors.

SI equips humans with interpersonal abilities to behave wisely in navigating social interactions to achieve social goals. This presents an operational evaluation paradigm: outcome-oriented goal achievement evaluation and process-oriented interpersonal ability evaluation, which existing work fails to address. To this end, we propose SocialEval, a script-based bilingual SI benchmark, integrating outcome- and process-oriented evaluation by manually crafting narrative scripts. Each script is structured as a world tree that contains plot lines driven by interpersonal ability, providing a comprehensive view of how LLMs navigate social interactions. Experiments show that LLMs fall behind humans on both SI evaluations, exhibit prosociality, and prefer more positive social behaviors, even if they lead to goal failure.

In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation of the automated deception detection capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) across diverse domains. We assess the performance of both open-source and proprietary LLMs on three distinct datasets—real-life trial interviews (RLTD), instructed deception in interpersonal scenarios (MU3D), and deceptive reviews (OpSpam). We systematically analyze the effectiveness of different experimental setups for deception detection, including zero-shot and few-shot approaches with random or similarity-based in-context example selection. Our findings indicate that fine-tuned LLMs achieve state-of-the-art performance on textual deception detection, whereas LMMs struggle to fully leverage multimodal cues, particularly in real-world settings. Additionally, we analyze the impact of auxiliary features, such as non-verbal... | Md Messal Monem Miah, Adrita Anika, Xi Shi, Ruihong Huang |  |

However, directly discretizing speech by neural audio codecs often results in sequences that fundamentally differ from text sequences. Unlike text, where text token sequences are deterministic, discrete speech tokens can exhibit significant variability based on contextual factors, while still producing perceptually identical audio segments. We refer to this phenomenon as Discrete Representation Inconsistency (DRI). This inconsistency can lead to a single speech segment being represented by multiple divergent sequences, which creates confusion in neural codec language models and results in poor generated speech. In this paper, we quantitatively analyze the DRI phenomenon within popular audio tokenizers such as EnCodec. Our approach effectively mitigates the DRI phenomenon of the neural audio... | Wenrui Liu, Zhifang Guo, Jin Xu, Yuanjun Lv, Yunfei Chu, Zemin Liu, Junyang Lin |  |

Recent studies have revealed that the performance of LLMs can be significantly improved by integrating external tools. Based on this, we propose a benchmark framework called PlanningArena, which aims to simulate real application scenarios and provide a series of apps and API tools that may be involved in the actual planning process. This framework adopts a modular task structure and combines user portrait analysis to evaluate the ability of LLMs in correctly selecting tools, logical reasoning in complex scenarios, and parsing user information. In addition, we deeply diagnose the task execution effect of LLMs from both macro and micro levels. The experimental results show that even the most outstanding GPT-4o and DeepSeekV3 models only achieved a total score of 56.5% and 41.9% in PlanningArena, respectively, indicating that current LLMs still face challenges in logical reasoning,... | Zihan Zheng, Tianle Cui, Chuwen Xie, Jiahui Pan, Qianglong Chen, Lewei He |  |

However, handling long contexts with conventional transformer architecture requires substantial training and inference resources. Existing context condensing methods cannot accurately understand the full context, as there is a considerable amount of information loss in the condensing process. To address these issues, we present \*\*FocusLLM\*\*, a framework designed to extend the fixed context length of any decoder-only LLM, allowing the model to focus on relevant information from very long sequences. FocusLLM first divides long text input into chunks based on the model’s original context length. It then employs the \*\*_dynamic condensing_\*\* process to distill crucial information from each chunk. Ultimately, through the novel \*\*_parallel decoding_\*\* mechanism, FocusLLM can integrate the extracted information into its local context. FocusLLM stands out for great... | Zhenyu Li, Yike Zhang, Tengyu Pan, Yutao Sun, Zhichao Duan, Junjie Fang, Rong Han, Zixuan Wang, Jianyong Wang |  |

These models are typically optimized using triplets of (query, positive, negative) data pairs for contrastive learning, where the negative samples play a critical role in enhancing the model’s ability to discern subtle semantic distinctions. In this work, we introduce a \*\*M\*\*ulti-\*\*G\*\*ranularity \*\*H\*\*ard-negative (MGH) synthesis framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate diverse negative samples with varying levels of similarity with the query. This approach facilitates a coarse-to-fine curriculum learning strategy during supervised training, allowing the embedding model to progressively learn more nuanced semantic representations. Meanwhile, we propose an \*\*A\*\*nchor \*\*T\*\*oken \*\*A\*\*ware (ATA) pooling method that assigns higher weights to anchor tokens based on... | Tengyu Pan, Zhichao Duan, Zhenyu Li, Bowen Dong, Ning Liu, Xiuxing Li, Jianyong Wang |  |

Homework is an important part of education in schools across the world, but to maximize benefit, it must be accompanied by feedback and follow-up questions. We developed a prompting strategy that enables GPT-4 to conduct interactive homework sessions for high school students learning English as a second language. Our strategy requires minimal effort in content preparation, one of the key challenges of alternatives such as home tutors or ITSs. We carried out a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) in four high-school classes, replacing traditional homework with GPT-4 homework sessions for the treatment group. We found that the treatment group had higher levels of satisfaction and desire to keep using the system among the students. This occurred without compromising learning outcomes, and one... | Alessandro Vanzo, Sankalan Pal Chowdhury, Mrinmaya Sachan |  |

However, their ability to accurately represent various cultural nuances remains an open question. In our work, we introduce CULTDIFF benchmark, evaluating whether state-of-the-art diffusion models can generate culturally specific images spanning ten countries. We show that these models often fail to generate cultural artifacts in architecture, clothing, and food, especially for underrepresented country regions, by conducting a fine-grained analysis of different similarity aspects, revealing significant disparities in cultural relevance, description fidelity, and realism compared to real-world reference images. With the collected human evaluations, we develop a neural-based image-image similarity metric, namely, CULTDIFF-S, to predict human judgment on real and generated images with cultural artifacts. Our work highlights the need for more inclusive generative... | Zahra Bayramli, Ayhan Suleymanzade, Na Min An, Huzama Ahmad, Eunsu Kim, Junyeong Park, James Thorne, Alice Oh |  |

Current approaches typically address this issue through online sampling from the target policy, which requires significant computational resources.In this paper, we hypothesize that during off-policy training, while the ranking order of output generated by policy changes, their overall distribution remains relatively stable.This stability allows the conversion of the sampling process from the target policy into a computationallyefficient re-ranking of preference data.Building on this hypothesis, we propose a new framework that leverages the model’s intrinsic safety judgment capability to extract reward signals, which are then used to calculate label confidence for preference reordering. Extensive experiments and theoretical analysis demonstrate that the proposed method effectively addresses the... | Qiyuan Deng, Xuefeng Bai, Kehai Chen, Yaowei Wang, Liqiang Nie, Min Zhang |  |

As data archives grow, forced alignment can accelerate the study of sociophonetic variation in minority languages. This paper examines the application of English and custom-made acoustic models on the alignment of vowels in two Pacific Creoles, Tok Pisin (59 hours) and Bislama (38.5 hours). We find that English models perform acceptably well in both languages, and as well as humans in vowel environments described as ‘Highly Reliable’. Custom models performed better in Bislama than Tok Pisin. We end the paper with recommendations on the use of cross-linguistic acoustic models in the case of English-Based Creoles. | Sam Passmore, Lila San Roque, Kirsty Gillespie, Saurabh Nath, Kira Davey, Keira Mullan, Tim Cawley, Jennifer Biggs, Rosey Billington, Bethwyn Evans, Nick Thieberger, Danielle Barth |  |

However, frequently occurring subtle yet critical errors, such as miscalculations or incorrect substitutions, limit the LLMs’ full potential. Existing studies to improve mathematical ability typically involve applying preference learning to step-wise solution pairs. Although these methods leverage samples of varying granularity to mitigate reasoning errors, they overlook critical subtle errors. In this work, we propose a novel preference learning framework called eRror-Injected Self-Editing (RISE), which injects predefined subtle errors into pivotal tokens in reasoning or computation steps to construct hard pairs for error mitigation. In detail, RISE uses the LLM itself to edit a small number of tokens in the solution, injecting designed subtle errors. Then, pairs composed of self-edited solutions and their... | Kaishuai Xu, Tiezheng Yu, Wenjun Hou, Yi Cheng, Chak Tou Leong, Liangyou Li, Xin Jiang, Lifeng Shang, Qun Liu, Wenjie Li |  |

Truthfulness evaluations of large language models (LLMs) have primarily been focused on English. However, the ability of LLMs to maintain truthfulness across languages remains under-explored. Our study evaluates 12 state-of-the-art open LLMs, comparing base and instruction-tuned models using human evaluation, multiple-choice metrics, and LLM-as-a-Judge scoring. Our findings reveal that, while LLMs perform best in English and worst in Basque (the lowest-resourced language), overall truthfulness discrepancies across languages are smaller than anticipated. Furthermore, we show that LLM-as-a-Judge correlates more closely with human judgments than multiple-choice metrics, and that informativeness plays a critical role in truthfulness assessment. Our results also indicate that machine translation provides a viable approach for extending... | Blanca Calvo Figueras, Eneko Sagarzazu, Julen Etxaniz, Jeremy Barnes, Pablo Gamallo, Iria deDiosFlores, Rodrigo Agerri |  |

However, when focusing on instruction-following capabilities, if a prompt specifies a concept order, LLMs must generate sentences that adhere to the specified order. To address this, we propose Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark designed to evaluate the compositional generalization and instruction-following abilities of LLMs. This benchmark measures ordered coverage to assess whether concepts are generated in the specified order, enabling a simultaneous evaluation of both abilities. We conducted a comprehensive analysis using 36 LLMs and found that, while LLMs generally understand the intent of instructions, biases toward specific concept order patterns often lead to low-diversity outputs or identical results even when the concept order is altered. Moreover, even the most instruction-compliant LLM achieved only about 75% ordered coverage,... | Yusuke Sakai, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Taro Watanabe |  |

However, linguistic nuances of under-resourced languages remain unexplored. We introduce Batayan, a holistic Filipino benchmark that systematically evaluates LLMs across three key natural language processing (NLP) competencies: understanding, reasoning, and generation. Batayan consolidates eight tasks, three of which have not existed prior for Filipino corpora, covering both Tagalog and code-switched Taglish utterances. Our rigorous, native-speaker-driven adaptation and validation processes ensures fluency and authenticity to the complex morphological and syntactic structures of Filipino, alleviating the pervasive translationese bias in existing Filipino corpora. We report empirical results on a variety of open-source and commercial LLMs, highlighting significant performance gaps that signal the under-representation of Filipino in pre-training... | Jann Railey Montalan, Jimson Paulo Layacan, David Demitri Africa, Richell Isaiah Flores, Michael Tuscano Lopez II, Theresa Denise Magsajo, Anjanette Cayabyab, WilliamChandra Tjhi |  |

Identifying checkworthy claims is the first step, where automation can help scale fact-checkers’ efforts. However, detection methods struggle with content that is (1) multimodal, (2) from diverse domains, and (3) synthetic. We introduce HintsOfTruth, a public dataset for multimodal checkworthiness detection with 27K real-world and synthetic image/claim pairs. The mix of real and synthetic data makes this dataset unique and ideal for benchmarking detection methods. We compare fine-tuned and prompted Large Language Models (LLMs). We find that well-configured lightweight text-based encoders perform comparably to multimodal models but the former only focus on identifying non-claim-like content. Multimodal LLMs can be more accurate but come at a significant computational cost, making them impractical for large-scale applications. When faced with synthetic data, multimodal models perform more robustly. | Michiel van der Meer, Pavel Korshunov, Sébastien Marcel, Lonneke van der Plas |  |

Although existing ground VLN agents achieved notable results in indoor and outdoor settings, they struggle in aerial VLN due to the absence of predefined navigation graphs and the exponentially expanding action space in long-horizon exploration. In this work, we propose CityNavAgent, a large language model (LLM)-empowered agent that significantly reduces the navigation complexity for urban aerial VLN. Specifically, we design a hierarchical semantic planning module (HSPM) that decomposes the long-horizon task into sub-goals with different semantic levels. The agent reaches the target progressively by achieving sub-goals with different capacities of the LLM. Additionally, a global memory module storing historical... | Weichen Zhang, Chen Gao, Shiquan Yu, Ruiying Peng, Baining Zhao, Qian Zhang, Jinqiang Cui, Xinlei Chen, Yong Li |  |

Challenges of Idiom Translation in Speech-to-text Systems](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.1512/) |  | 0 | Idioms are defined as a group of words with a figurative meaning not deducible from their individual components. Although modern machine translation systems have made remarkable progress, translating idioms remains a major challenge, especially for speech-to-text systems, where research on this topic is notably sparse. In this paper, we systematically evaluate idiom translation as compared to conventional news translation in both text-to-text machine translation (MT) and speech-to-text translation (SLT) systems across two language pairs (German to English, Russian to English). We compare state-of-the-art end-to-end SLT systems (SeamlessM4T SLT-to-text, Whisper Large v3) with MT systems (SeamlessM4T SLT-to-text, No Language Left Behind), Large Language Models (DeepSeek, LLaMA) and cascaded alternatives. Our results reveal that SLT systems experience a pronounced performance drop on idiomatic data, often reverting to literal translations even in higher layers, whereas MT systems and... | Iuliia Zaitova, Badr M.

Narratives are overt or implicit claims, recurring across articles and languages, promoting a specific interpretation or viewpoint on an ongoing topic, often propagating mis/disinformation. We developed two-level taxonomies with coarse- and fine-grained narrative labels for two domains: (i) climate change and (ii) the military conflict between Ukraine and Russia. We collected news articles in four languages (Bulgarian, English, Portuguese, and Russian) related to the two domains and manually annotated them at the paragraph level. We make the dataset publicly available, along with experimental results of several strong baselines that assign narrative labels to news articles at the paragraph or the document level. We believe that this dataset will foster research in narrative detection and enable new research directions towards more multi-domain and highly granular narrative related tasks. | Nikolaos Nikolaidis, Nicolas Stefanovitch, Purificação Silvano, Dimitar Iliyanov Dimitrov, Roman Yangarber, Nuno Guimarães, Elisa Sartori, Ion Androutsopoulos, Preslav Nakov, Giovanni Da San Martino, Jakub Piskorski |  |

However, extracting from large-scale cross-modal associations often smooths out semantic details and requires large computations, limiting multimodal fine-grained understanding performance and efficiency. To address this issue, this paper proposes a detail-oriented prompt learning (DoPL) method for vision-language models to implement fine-grained multi-modal semantic alignment with merely 0.25M trainable parameters. According to the low-entropy information concentration theory, DoPL explores shared interest tokens from text-vision correlations and transforms them into alignment weights to enhance text prompt and vision prompt via detail-oriented prompt generation. It effectively guides the current frozen layer to extract fine-grained text-vision alignment cues. Furthermore, DoPL constructs detail-oriented prompt generation for... | Yongbin Guo, Shuzhen Li, Zhulin Liu, Tong Zhang, C. L. Philip Chen |  |

In this work, we investigate how human-like personality traits influence agent behavior and performance within text-based interactive environments. We introduce PANDA: Personality Adapted Neural Decision Agents, a novel method for projecting human personality traits onto agents to guide their behavior. To induce personality in a text-based game agent, (i) we train a personality classifier to identify what personality type the agent’s actions exhibit, and (ii) we integrate the personality profiles directly into the agent’s policy-learning pipeline. By deploying agents embodying 16 distinct personality types across 25 text-based games and analyzing their trajectories, we demonstrate that an agent’s action decisions can be guided toward specific personality profiles. Moreover, certain personality types, such as... | Seungwon Lim, Seungbeen Lee, Dongjun Min, Youngjae Yu |  |

However, challenges such as interdisciplinary complexity and high costs with limited returns hinder progress, leading to a shortage of experts and insufficient technological support. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise across various fields, their application in seed science remains limited due to the scarcity of digital resources, complex gene-trait relationships, and the lack of standardized benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce SeedBench—the first multi-task benchmark specifically designed for seed science. Developed in collaboration with domain experts, SeedBench focuses on seed breeding and simulates key aspects of modern breeding processes. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 26 leading LLMs, encompassing proprietary, open-source, and domain-specific fine-tuned models.

The dataset aims to facilitate work on the legal argument stance classification task, which involves assessing whether a case summary strengthens or weakens a legal argument (polarity) and to what extent (intensity). To assess the complexity of this task, we evaluate various existing NLP methods, including zero-shot prompting proprietary large language models (LLMs), and supervised fine-tuning of smaller open-weight language models (LMs) on 𝛿-Stance. Our findings reveal that although prompting proprietary LLMs can help predict stance polarity, supervised model fine-tuning on 𝛿-Stance is necessary to distinguish intensity. We further find that alternative strategies such as domain-specific pretraining and zero-shot prompting using... | Ankita Gupta, Douglas Rice, Brendan T. O'Connor |  |

However, training LLMs with long context windows to acquire the capability of effectively modeling lengthy inputs is often hindered by the scarcity of naturally long-context data. Existing methods for constructing long-context data by concatenating short documents have overlooked a crucial characteristic of long-context data quality, namely semantic dependency. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Retrieval, Dependency Recognition, and Reorder for data synthesis (Re3Syn), which leverages semantic similarity to retrieve relevant documents and form several batches. Within each batch, the framework comprehensively recognizes dependency and utilizes them, along with a reorder algorithm, to organize the short documents into coherent long-context data. Comprehensive experiment on multiple benchmarks indicate that the data generated by the Re3Syn has longer dependencies... | Zhiyang Zhang, Ziqiang Liu, Huiming Wang, Renke Shan, Li Kuang, Lu Wang, De Wen Soh |  |

So far, efforts to integrate multimodality into chatbots have primarily focused on image-centric tasks, such as visual dialogue and image-based instructions, placing emphasis on the “eyes” of human perception while neglecting the “ears”, namely auditory aspects. Moreover, these studies often center around static interactions that focus on discussing the modality rather than naturally incorporating it into the conversation, which limits the richness of simultaneous, dynamic engagement. Furthermore, while multimodality has been explored in multi-party and multi-session conversations, task-specific constraints have hindered its seamless integration into dynamic, natural conversations. To address these challenges, this study aims to equip chatbots with “eyes and ears” capable of more immersive interactions with humans. As part of this effort, we... | Jihyoung Jang, Minwook Bae, Minji Kim, Dilek HakkaniTür, Hyounghun Kim |  |

In the era of rapidly growing multimodal content and social media, MCR is particularly crucial for interpreting user interactions and bridging text-visual references to improve communication and personalization. However, MCR research for real-world dialogues remains unexplored due to the lack of sufficient data resources. To address this gap, we introduce TikTalkCoref, the first Chinese multimodal coreference dataset for social media in real-world scenarios, derived from the popular Douyin short-video platform. This dataset pairs short videos with corresponding textual dialogues from user comments and includes manually annotated coreference clusters for both person mentions in the text and the coreferential person head regions in the corresponding video frames.

As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into daily life, understanding their ability to interpret and respond to human mental states is crucial for enabling effective interactions. In this paper, we review LLMs’ ToM capabilities by analyzing both evaluation benchmarks and enhancement strategies. For evaluation, we focus on recently proposed and widely used story-based benchmarks. For enhancement, we provide an in-depth analysis of recent methods aimed at improving LLMs’ ToM abilities. Furthermore, we outline promising directions for future research to further advance these capabilities and better adapt LLMs to more realistic and diverse scenarios. Our survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers interested in evaluating and advancing LLMs’ ToM capabilities. | Ruirui Chen, Weifeng Jiang, Chengwei Qin, Cheston Tan |  |

Due to the high demand for domain expertise, existing automatic summarization methods fail to accurately identify relevant studies and generate high-quality summaries. To that end, we introduce InsightAgent, a human-centered interactive AI agent powered by large language models that revolutionize this workflow. InsightAgent partitions a large literature corpus based on semantics and employs a multi-agent design for more focused processing of literature, leading to significant improvement in the quality of generated SRs.

However, existing methods focus mainly on visual modalities, neglecting rich multi-modality information. This paper proposes a novel framework, Cross-Modality Heterogeneous Knowledge Fusion (CMHKF), that integrates cross-modality knowledge from video, audio, and text to improve anomaly detection and localization. To achieve adaptive cross-modality heterogeneous knowledge learning, we designed two components: Cross-Modality Video-Text Knowledge Alignment (CVKA) and Audio Modality Feature Adaptive Extraction (AFAE). They extract and aggregate features by exploring inter-modality correlations. By leveraging abundant cross-modality knowledge, our approach improves the discrimination between normal and anomalous segments.

The efficiency of SD primarily hinges on the consistency between the draft model and the verify model. However, existing drafting approaches typically require additional modules to be trained, which can be challenging to implement and ensure compatibility across various LLMs. In this paper, we propose CLaSp, an in-context layer-skipping strategy for self-speculative decoding. Unlike prior methods, CLaSp does not require additional drafting modules or extra training. Instead, it employs a plug-and-play mechanism by skipping intermediate layers of the verify model to construct a compressed draft model. Specifically, we develop a dynamic programming algorithm that optimizes the layer-skipping process by leveraging the complete hidden states from the last verification stage as an objective. This enables CLaSp to dynamically adjust its layer-skipping strategy after each... | Longze Chen, Renke Shan, Huiming Wang, Lu Wang, Ziqiang Liu, Run Luo, Jiawei Wang, Hamid AlinejadRokny, Min Yang |  |

However, these self-collected data inevitably contain intermediate failed actions caused by attempting physically infeasible behaviors and/or hallucinations. Directly learning a policy from such trajectories can reinforce incorrect behaviors and reduce task success rates. In this paper, we propose a failed action-aware objective that suppresses the negative impact of failed actions during training by assigning zero return based on textual feedback. Building on this objective, we introduce a perturbation method that leverages unsuccessful trajectories to construct new successful ones that share the same goal. This allows agents to benefit from diverse experiences without further interaction with the environment. Experiments in ALFWorld and ScienceWorld demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms strong baselines and generalizes across... | Canasai Kruengkrai, Koichiro Yoshino |  |

However, language typically does not maintain a strictly uniform information rate; instead, it fluctuates around a global average. These fluctuations are often explained by factors such as syntactic constraints, stylistic choices, or audience design. In this work, we explore an alternative perspective: that these fluctuations may be influenced by an implicit linguistic pressure towards periodicity, where the information rate oscillates at regular intervals, potentially across multiple frequencies simultaneously. We apply harmonic regression and introduce a novel extension called time scaling to detect and test for such periodicity in information contours. Analyzing texts in English, Spanish, German, Dutch, Basque, and Brazilian Portuguese, we find consistent evidence of periodic patterns in... | Eleftheria Tsipidi, Samuel Kiegeland, Franz Nowak, Tianyang Xu, Ethan Wilcox, Alex Warstadt, Ryan Cotterell, Mario Giulianelli |  |

We introduce REAL-MM-RAG, an automatically generated benchmark designed to address four key properties essential for real-world retrieval: (i) multi-modal documents, (ii) enhanced difficulty, (iii) Realistic-RAG queries and (iv) accurate labeling. Additionally, we propose a multi-difficulty-level scheme based on query rephrasing to evaluate models’ semantic understanding beyond keyword matching. Our benchmark reveals significant model weaknesses, particularly in handling table-heavy documents and robustness to query rephrasing. To mitigate these shortcomings, we curate a rephrased training set and introduce a new finance-focused, table-heavy dataset. Fine-tuning on these datasets enables models to achieve state-of-the-art retrieval performance on REAL-MM-RAG benchmark. Our work offers a better way to... | Navve Wasserman, Roi Pony, Oshri Naparstek, Adi Raz Goldfarb, Eli Schwartz, Udi Barzelay, Leonid Karlinsky |  |

For all of these applications and others, political biases in these models can affect their performance. Several researchers have attempted to study political bias in language models using evaluation suites based on surveys, such as the Political Compass Test (PCT), often finding a particular leaning favored by these models. However, there is some variation in the exact prompting techniques, leading to diverging findings, and most research relies on constrained-answer settings to extract model responses. Moreover, the Political Compass Test is not a scientifically valid survey instrument. In this work, we contribute a political bias measured informed by political science theory, building on survey design principles to test a wide variety of input prompts, while taking into account prompt sensitivity. We then... | Mats Faulborn, Indira Sen, Max Pellert, Andreas Spitz, David García |  |

However, the safety of LLMs in long-context tasks remains under-explored, leaving a significant gap in both evaluation and improvement of their safety. To address this, we introduce LongSafety, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLM safety in open-ended long-context tasks. LongSafety encompasses 7 categories of safety issues and 6 user-oriented long-context tasks, with a total of 1,543 test cases, averaging 5,424 words per context. Our evaluation towards 16 representative LLMs reveals significant safety vulnerabilities, with most models achieving safety rates below 55%. Our findings also indicate that strong safety performance in short-context scenarios does not necessarily correlate with safety in long-context tasks, emphasizing the unique challenges and urgency of improving long-context... | Yida Lu, Jiale Cheng, Zhexin Zhang, Shiyao Cui, Cunxiang Wang, Xiaotao Gu, Yuxiao Dong, Jie Tang, Hongning Wang, Minlie Huang |  |

While existing approaches focus on enhancing the decoding strategies, they ignore the fundamental mechanism of how contextual information is processed within LLMs’ internal states. As a result, LLMs remain limited in their ability to fully leverage contextual knowledge. In this paper, we propose Context-aware Layer Enhancement (CaLE), a novel intervention method that enhances the utilization of contextual knowledge within LLMs’ internal representations. By employing 𝒱-usable information analysis, CaLE strategically amplifies the growth of contextual information at an optimal layer, thereby enriching representations in the final layer. Our experiments demonstrate that CaLE effectively improves context-faithful generation in Question-Answering tasks, particularly in scenarios involving unknown... | Xiaowei Yuan, Zhao Yang, Ziyang Huang, Yequan Wang, Siqi Fan, Yiming Ju, Jun Zhao, Kang Liu |  |

However, aligning these models with individual values raises significant safety concerns, as certain values may correlate with harmful information. In this paper, we identify specific safety risks associated with value-aligned LLMs and investigate the psychological principles behind these challenges. Our findings reveal two key insights. (1) Value-aligned LLMs are more prone to harmful behavior compared to non-fine-tuned models and exhibit slightly higher risks in traditional safety evaluations than other fine-tuned models. (2) These safety issues arise because value-aligned LLMs genuinely generate text according to the aligned values, which can amplify harmful outcomes. Using a dataset with detailed safety categories, we find significant correlations between value alignment and safety risks, supported by psychological hypotheses.... | Sooyung Choi, Jaehyeok Lee, Xiaoyuan Yi, Jing Yao, Xing Xie, JinYeong Bak |  |

Traditional methods learn a single-vector embedding to represent semantics of each sample, but struggle to capture nuanced and diverse relationships that can exist across modalities. Set-based approaches, which represent each sample with multiple embeddings, offer a promising alternative, as they can capture richer and more diverse relationships. In this paper, we show that, despite their promise, these set-based representations continue to face issues including sparse supervision and set collapse, which limits their effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose Maximal Pair Assignment Similarity to optimize one-to-one matching between embedding sets which preserve semantic diversity within the set. We also introduce two loss functions to further enhance the representations: Global Discriminative Loss to enhance distinction among embeddings,... | Hani Alomari, Anushka Sivakumar, Andrew Zhang, Chris Thomas |  |

Such uses typically rely on raw citation counts and neglect variability in citation types. In particular, citations can vary in their fidelity as original knowledge from cited studies may be paraphrased, summarized, or reinterpreted, possibly wrongly, leading to variation in how much information changes from cited to citing paper. In this study, we introduce a computational pipeline to quantify citation fidelity at scale. Using full texts of papers, the pipeline identifies citations in citing papers and the corresponding claims in cited papers, and applies supervised models to measure fidelity at the sentence level. Analyzing a large-scale multi-disciplinary dataset of approximately 13 million citation sentence pairs, we find that citation fidelity is higher when authors cite papers that are 1) more recent and intellectually close, 2) more accessible, and 3) the first author has a lower H-index and... | Hong Chen, Misha Teplitskiy, David Jurgens |  |

Many models approach review generation as a proxy for explainable recommendations. While these models can produce fluent and grammatically correct sentences, they often lack preciseness and fail to provide personalized informative recommendations. To address this issue, we propose a personalized, aspect-controlled model called Multi-Aspect Prompt LEarner (MAPLE), which integrates aspect category as another input dimension to facilitate memorizing fine-grained aspect terms. Experiments conducted on two real-world review datasets in the restaurant domain demonstrate that MAPLE significantly outperforms baseline review-generation models. MAPLE excels in both text and feature diversity, ensuring that the generated content covers a wide range of aspects. Additionally, MAPLE delivers good generation quality while maintaining strong coherence... | ChingWen Yang, ZhiQuan Feng, YingJia Lin, Che Wei Chen, Kunda Wu, Hao Xu, JuiFeng Yao, HungYu Kao |  |

In this paper, we address this question by analyzing latent representations (latents) during a word-translation task in transformer-based LLMs. We strategically extract latents from a source translation prompt and insert them into the forward pass on a target translation prompt. By doing so, we find that the output language is encoded in the latent at an earlier layer than the concept to be translated. Building on this insight, we conduct two key experiments. First, we demonstrate that we can change the concept without changing the language and vice versa through activation patching alone. Second, we show that patching with the mean representation of a concept across different languages does not affect the models’ ability to translate it, but instead improves it. Finally, we generalize to multi-token generation... | Clément Dumas, Chris Wendler, Veniamin Veselovsky, Giovanni Monea, Robert West |  |

This has led to numerous studies proposing benchmarks to assess systematic generalization, as well as models and training regimes designed to enhance it. Many of these efforts are framed as addressing the challenge posed by Fodor and Pylyshyn. However, while they argue for systematicity of representations, existing benchmarks and models primarily focus on the systematicity of behaviour. We emphasize the crucial nature of this distinction. Furthermore, building on Hadley’s (1994) taxonomy of systematic generalization, we analyze the extent to which behavioural systematicity is tested by key benchmarks in the literature across language and vision. Finally, we highlight ways of assessing systematicity of representations in ML models as practiced in the field of mechanistic interpretability. | Ivan Vegner, Sydelle de Souza, Valentin Forch, Martha Lewis, Leonidas A.

Current methods for improvement typically rely on splitting long contexts into fixed-length chunks. However, fixed truncation risks separating semantically relevant content, leading to ambiguity and compromising accurate understanding. To overcome this limitation, we propose a straightforward approach for dynamically separating and selecting chunks of long context, facilitating a more streamlined input for LLMs. In particular, we compute semantic similarities between adjacent sentences, using lower similarities to adaptively divide long contexts into variable-length chunks. We further train a question-aware classifier to select sensitive chunks that are critical for answering specific questions. Experimental results on both single-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms strong baselines. Notably, it maintains robustness... | Boheng Sheng, Jiacheng Yao, Meicong Zhang, Guoxiu He |  |

While existing approaches have been improved with iterative retrieval, they still struggle to identify and organize dynamic knowledge. To address this, we propose DualRAG, a synergistic dual-process framework that seamlessly integrates reasoning and retrieval. DualRAG operates through two tightly coupled processes: Reasoning-augmented Querying (RaQ) and progressive Knowledge Aggregation (pKA). They work in concert: as RaQ navigates the reasoning path and generates targeted queries, pKA ensures that newly acquired knowledge is systematically integrated to support coherent reasoning. This creates a virtuous cycle of knowledge enrichment and reasoning refinement. Through targeted fine-tuning, DualRAG preserves its sophisticated reasoning and retrieval capabilities even in smaller-scale models, demonstrating its versatility... | Rong Cheng, Jinyi Liu, Yan Zheng, Fei Ni, Jiazhen Du, Hangyu Mao, Fuzheng Zhang, Bo Wang, Jianye Hao |  |

In this paper, we propose a novel reasoning framework, referred to as Structure-aware Planning with an Accurate World Model (SWAP), that integrates structured knowledge representation with learned planning. Unlike prior methods that rely purely on natural language reasoning, SWAP leverages entailment graphs to encode structured dependencies and enable symbolic verification of intermediate steps. To systematically construct and update the graph, SWAP employs a policy model to propose candidate expansions and a world model to predict structural updates. To improve accuracy, the world model generates multiple alternative updates, and a discriminator re-ranks them based on plausibility. To encourage diverse exploration, we introduce... | Siheng Xiong, Ali Payani, Yuan Yang, Faramarz Fekri |  |

In this paper, we focus on sparsity-based PEFT (SPEFT), which introduces trainable sparse adaptations to the weight matrices in the model, offering greater flexibility in selecting fine-tuned parameters compared to low-rank methods. We conduct the first systematic evaluation of salience metrics for SPEFT, inspired by zero-cost NAS proxies, and identify simple gradient-based metrics is reliable, and results are on par with the best alternatives, offering both computational efficiency and robust performance. Additionally, we compare static and dynamic masking strategies, finding that static masking, which predetermines non-zero entries before training, delivers efficiency without sacrificing performance, while dynamic masking offers no substantial benefits. Across NLP tasks, a simple gradient-based, static SPEFT consistently outperforms other fine-tuning methods for LLMs,... | Xinxin Liu, Aaron Thomas, Cheng Zhang, Jianyi Cheng, Yiren Zhao, Xitong Gao |  |

However, this shifts the computational burden from training-time to inference-time, making deployment of many-shot ICL challenging to justify in-practice. This cost is further increased if a custom demonstration set is retrieved for each inference example. We present Dynamic Block-Sparse Attention, an optimized method for retrieval-based many-shot in-context learning. By combining carefully designed block-sparse attention and retrieval of cached groups of demonstrations, we achieve comparable per-example latency to finetuning while maintaining on average >95% of the best method’s accuracy across strong ICL and finetuning baselines. We hope that this will further enable the deployment of many-shot ICL at scale. | Emily Xiao, ChinJou Li, Yilin Zhang, Graham Neubig, Amanda Bertsch |  |

Only recently, a paradigm of first-order algorithms has emerged in the theoretical literature, capable of effectively addressing bilevel optimization problems. Nevertheless, the practical efficiency of this paradigm remains unverified, particularly in the context of large language models (LLMs). This paper introduces the first scalable instantiation of this paradigm called _ScaleBiO_, focusing on bilevel optimization for large-scale LLM data reweighting. By combining with a recently proposed memory-efficient training technique called LISA, our novel algorithm allows the paradigm to scale to ~30B-sized LLMs on 8×H100 GPUs, marking the first successful application of bilevel optimization under practical scenarios for large-sized LLMs. Empirically, extensive experiments on data reweighting verify the... | Rui Pan, Dylan Zhang, Hanning Zhang, Xingyuan Pan, Minrui Xu, Jipeng Zhang, Renjie Pi, Xiaoyu Wang, Tong Zhang |  |

As a sibling project to SafeRLHF and BeaverTails, we separate annotations of helpfulness and harmlessness for question-answering pairs, providing distinct perspectives on these coupled attributes. Overall, we provide 44.6k refined prompts and 265k question-answer pairs with safety meta-labels for 19 harm categories and three severity levels ranging from minor to severe, with answers generated by Llama-family models. Based on this, we collected 166.8k preference data, including dual-preference (helpfulness and harmlessness decoupled) and single-preference data (trade-off the helpfulness and harmlessness from scratch), respectively. Using the large-scale annotation data, we further train severity-sensitive moderation for the risk control of LLMs and safety-centric RLHF algorithms for the safety alignment of LLMs. We believe this dataset will be a... | Jiaming Ji, Donghai Hong, Borong Zhang, Boyuan Chen, Josef Dai, Boren Zheng, Tianyi Alex Qiu, Jiayi Zhou, Kaile Wang, Boxun Li, Sirui Han, Yike Guo, Yaodong Yang |  |

We investigate the training patterns of different layers in large language models (LLMs) through the lens of the gradient. We are specifically interested in how fast vs. slow thinking affects the layer-wise gradients, given the recent popularity of training LLMs on reasoning paths such as chain-of-thoughts (CoT) and process rewards. In our study, fast thinking without CoT leads to larger gradients and larger differences of gradients across layers than slow thinking (Detailed CoT), indicating the learning stability brought by the latter. Additionally, we study whether the gradient patterns can reflect the correctness of responses when training different LLMs using slow vs. fast thinking paths. The results show that the gradients of slow thinking can distinguish correct and irrelevant reasoning paths. As a comparison, we conduct similar gradient analyses on non-reasoning knowledge learning tasks, on which, however, trivially... | Ming Li, Yanhong Li, Tianyi Zhou |  |

Inspired by scaling consistency, we show that smaller models can accurately predict significant differences in tokenizer impact on larger models at a fraction of the compute cost. By systematically evaluating both English-centric and multilingual tokenizers, we find that tokenizer choice has negligible effects on tasks in English but results in consistent performance differences in multilingual settings. We propose new intrinsic tokenizer metrics inspired by Zipf’s law that correlate more strongly with downstream performance than text compression when modeling unseen languages. By combining several metrics to capture multiple aspects of tokenizer behavior, we develop a reliable framework for intrinsic tokenizer evaluations. Our work offers a more efficient path to informed tokenizer selection in future language model... | Jonas F. Lotz, António Vilarinho Lopes, Stephan Peitz, Hendra Setiawan, Leonardo Emili |  |

When doing so, it is common practice to include a portion of English data in the mixture, but its role has not been carefully studied to date. In this work, we show that including English does not impact validation perplexity, yet it is critical for the emergence of downstream capabilities in the target language. We introduce a language-agnostic benchmark for in-context learning (ICL), which reveals catastrophic forgetting early on CPT when English is not included. This in turn damages the ability of the model to generalize to downstream prompts as measured by perplexity, even if it does not manifest in terms of accuracy until later in training, and can be tied to a big shift in the model parameters. Based on these insights, we introduce curriculum learning and exponential moving average (EMA) of weights as effective alternatives to mitigate the need for English.

Upon a user query, collaborative rating platforms return a collection of items ranked in an order that is often not transparent to the users. Then, each item is presented with a collection of reviews in an order that typically is, again, rather opaque. Despite the prevalence of such platforms, little attention has been given to fairness in their context, where groups writing best-ranked reviews for best-ranked items have more influence on users’ behavior. We design and evaluate a fairness assessment pipeline that starts with a data collection phase to gather reviews from real-world platforms, by submitting artificial user queries and iterating through rated items. Following that, a group assignment phase computes and infers relevant groups for each review, based on review content and user data. Finally, the third step assesses and evaluates the fairness of... | Lorenzo Balzotti, Donatella Firmani, Jerin George Mathew, Riccardo Torlone, Sihem AmerYahia |  |

However, existing methods often rely on black-box models with opaque reasoning. We introduce RePanda, a structured fact verification approach that translates claims into executable pandas queries, enabling interpretable and verifiable reasoning.To train RePanda, we construct PanTabFact, a structured dataset derived from TabFact, where claims are paired with executable queries generated using DeepSeek-Chat and refined through automated error correction. Fine-tuning DeepSeek-coder-7B-instruct-v1.5 on PanTabFact, RePanda achieves 84.09% accuracy on TabFact. To assess Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization, we create a dataset named WikiFact from WikiTableQuestions by transforming question-answer pairs into factual claims.

However, cultural differences often lead to misalignment between the two; for example, politeness is often lost in translation. We characterize the ways that LLMs fail to translate style – biasing translations towards neutrality and performing worse in non-Western languages. We mitigate these failures with RASTA (Retrieval-Augmented STylistic Alignment), a method that leverages learned stylistic concepts to encourage LLM translation to appropriately convey cultural communication norms and align style. | Shreya Havaldar, Adam Stein, Eric Wong, Lyle H.

We investigate evaluation strategies and update methods for LLMs as new data becomes available. We introduce a web-scale dataset for time-continual pretraining of LLMs derived from 114 dumps of Common Crawl (CC) – orders of magnitude larger than previous continual language modeling benchmarks. We also design time-stratified evaluations across both general CC data and specific domains (Wikipedia, StackExchange, and code documentation) to assess how well various continual learning methods adapt to new data while retaining past knowledge. Our findings demonstrate that, on general CC data, autoregressive meta-schedules combined with a fixed-ratio replay of older data can achieve comparable held-out loss to re-training from scratch, while requiring significantly less computation (2.6x). However, the optimal balance between incorporating new data and replaying old data differs as replay is crucial to... | Jeffrey Li, Mohammadreza Armandpour, Iman Mirzadeh, Sachin Mehta, Vaishaal Shankar, Raviteja Vemulapalli, Samy Bengio, Oncel Tuzel, Mehrdad Farajtabar, Hadi Pouransari, Fartash Faghri |  |

For models to better understand and facilitate human communication, they must be responsive to the text’s implicit meaning. We focus on Natural Language Inference (NLI), a core tool for many language tasks, and find that state-of-the-art NLI models and datasets struggle to recognize a range of cases where entailment is implied, rather than explicit from the text. We formalize implied entailment as an extension of the NLI task and introduce the Implied NLI dataset (INLI) to help today’s LLMs both recognize a broader variety of implied entailments and to distinguish between implicit and explicit entailment. We show how LLMs fine-tuned on INLI understand implied entailment and can generalize this understanding across datasets and domains. | Shreya Havaldar, Hamidreza Alvari, John Palowitch, Mohammad Javad Hosseini, Senaka Buthpitiya, Alex Fabrikant |  |

We propose Multi-Level Explanations for Generative Language Models (MExGen), a technique to provide explanations for context-grounded text generation. MExGen assigns scores to parts of the context to quantify their influence on the model’s output. It extends attribution methods like LIME and SHAP to LLMs used in context-grounded tasks where (1) inference cost is high, (2) input text is long, and (3) the output is text. We conduct a systematic evaluation, both automated and human, of perturbation-based attribution methods for summarization and question answering. The results show that our framework can provide more faithful explanations of generated output than available alternatives, including LLM self-explanations. We open-source code for MExGen as part of the ICX360 toolkit:... | Lucas Monteiro Paes, Dennis Wei, Hyo Jin Do, Hendrik Strobelt, Ronny Luss, Amit Dhurandhar, Manish Nagireddy, Karthikeyan Natesan Ramamurthy, Prasanna Sattigeri, Werner Geyer, Soumya Ghosh |  |

Existing Privacy Policy Question Answering (QA) systems exhibit performance disparities across English dialects, disadvantaging speakers of non-standard varieties. We propose a novel multi-agent framework inspired by human-centered design principles to mitigate dialectal biases. Our approach integrates a Dialect Agent, which translates queries into Standard American English (SAE) while preserving dialectal intent, and a Privacy Policy Agent, which refines predictions using domain expertise. Unlike prior approaches, our method does not require retraining or dialect-specific fine-tuning, making it broadly applicable across models and domains. Evaluated on PrivacyQA and PolicyQA, our framework improves GPT-4o-mini’s zero-shot accuracy from 0.394 to 0.601 on PrivacyQA and from 0.352 to 0.464 on PolicyQA, surpassing or matching few-shot baselines without... | Dorde Klisura, Astrid R.

Larger models or those trained on fewer tokens exhibit less quantization-induced degradation (QiD), while smaller, well-trained models face significant performance losses. To gain deeper insights into this trend, we study over 1500+ quantized LLM checkpoints of various sizes and at different training levels (undertrained or fully trained) in a controlled setting, deriving scaling laws for understanding the relationship between QiD and factors: the number of training tokens, model size and bit width.With our derived scaling laws, we propose a novel perspective that we can use QiD to measure an LLM’s training levels and determine the number of training tokens required for fully training LLMs of various sizes.

In particular, fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for time series classification tasks has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on standard benchmarks. However, these LLM-based models have a significant drawback due to the large model size, with the number of trainable parameters in the millions. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to leveraging the success of language modeling in the time series domain. Instead of fine-tuning LLMs, we utilize a text embedding model to embed time series and then pair the embeddings with a simple classification head composed of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and multilayer perceptron (MLP). We conducted extensive experiments on a well-established time series classification benchmark. We demonstrated LETS-C not only outperforms the current SOTA in classification accuracy but also offers a lightweight... | Rachneet Kaur, Zhen Zeng, Tucker Balch, Manuela Veloso |  |

We introduce a benchmark to evaluate whether video-large language models (Video-LLMs) can naturally process continuous first-person visual observations like humans, enabling recall, perception, reasoning, and navigation. We have manually control drones to collect 3D embodied motion video data from real-world cities and simulated environments, resulting in 1.5k video clips. Then we design a pipeline to generate 5.2k multiple-choice questions. Evaluations of 17 widely-used Video-LLMs reveal current limitations in urban embodied cognition. Correlation analysis provides insight into the relationships between different tasks, showing that causal reasoning has a strong correlation with recall, perception, and navigation, while the abilities for counterfactual and associative reasoning exhibit lower correlation with other... | Baining Zhao, Jianjie Fang, Zichao Dai, Ziyou Wang, Jirong Zha, Weichen Zhang, Chen Gao, Yue Wang, Jinqiang Cui, Xinlei Chen, Yong Li |  |

Existing studies use either early or late fusion, but face limitations. Early fusion pre-aligns a table row with its associated passages, forming “stars,” which often include irrelevant contexts and miss query-dependent relationships. Late fusion retrieves individual nodes, dynamically aligning them, but it risks missing relevant contexts. Both approaches also struggle with advanced reasoning tasks, such as column-wise aggregation and multi-hop reasoning. To address these issues, we propose HELIOS, which combines the strengths of both approaches. First, the edge-based bipartite subgraph retrieval identifies finer-grained edges between table segments and passages, effectively avoiding the inclusion of irrelevant contexts. Then, the query-relevant node expansion identifies the most promising nodes, dynamically retrieving relevant edges to grow the bipartite subgraph, minimizing the... | Sungho Park, Joohyung Yun, Jongwuk Lee, WookShin Han |  |

To address this, we propose ONEBench (OpeN-Ended Benchmarking), a new paradigm that consolidates individual evaluation datasets into a unified, ever-expanding sample pool. ONEBench enables custom benchmarks for specific capabilities while reusing and aggregating samples, mitigating overfitting and dataset bias for broader capability assessment. It reframes model evaluation as selecting and aggregating sample-level tests.Transitioning from task-specific benchmarks to ONEBench introduces two challenges: heterogeneity (aggregating diverse metrics) and incompleteness(comparing models tested on different data subsets). To address these, we propose an aggregation algorithm that ensures identifiability (asymptotically recovering ground-truth scores) and rapid convergence, enabling accurate model comparisons with relatively little data. On homogenous datasets, our algorithm produces... | Adhiraj Ghosh, Sebastian Dziadzio, Ameya Prabhu, Vishaal Udandarao, Samuel Albanie, Matthias Bethge |  |

To motivate the development of LLMs that represent the linguistic and cultural diversity of the Spanish-speaking community, we present La Leaderboard, the first open-source leaderboard to evaluate generative LLMs in languages and language varieties of Spain and Latin America. La Leaderboard is a community-driven project that aims to establish an evaluation standard for everyone interested in developing LLMs for the Spanish-speaking community. This initial version combines 66 datasets in Catalan, Basque, Galician, and different Spanish varieties, showcasing the evaluation results of 50 models. To encourage community-driven development of leaderboards in other languages, we explain our methodology, including guidance on selecting the most suitable evaluation setup for each downstream task.

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a practical workaround, but most CoT-based methods rely on a single generic prompt like “think step by step,” with no task-specific adaptation. These approaches expect the model to discover an effective reasoning path on its own, forcing it to search through a vast prompt space. In contrast, many work has explored task-specific prompt designs to boost performance. However, these designs are typically developed through trial and error, lacking a theoretical ground. As a result, prompt engineering remains largely ad hoc and unguided.In this paper, we provide a theoretical framework that explains why some prompts succeed while others fail. We show that prompts function as selectors, extracting specific task-relevant information from the model’s full hidden state during CoT... | Xiang Zhang, Juntai Cao, Chenyu You, Dujian Ding |  |

Prior benchmarking efforts have primarily focused on latency reduction in idealized settings, often overlooking the diverse real-world inference workloads that shape energy use. In this work, we systematically analyze the energy implications of common inference efficiency optimizations across diverse Natural Language Processing (NLP) and generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) workloads, including conversational AI and code generation. We introduce a modeling approach that approximates real-world LLM workflows through a binning strategy for input-output token distributions and batch size variations. Our empirical analysis spans software frameworks, decoding strategies, GPU architectures, online and offline serving settings, and model parallelism configurations. We show that the effectiveness of inference optimizations is \*highly sensitive to workload geometry,... | Jared Fernandez, Clara Na, Vashisth Tiwari, Yonatan Bisk, Sasha Luccioni, Emma Strubell |  |

We use this approximation as a source of additional features in a regression model, trained from observations of model loss for a small number of mixtures. Experiments with Transformer decoder-only language models in the range of 70M to 10B parameters on the SlimPajama dataset show that our method achieves significantly better performance than approaches that train regression models using only the mixture rates as input features. Combining this improved optimization method with an objective that takes into account cross-entropy on end task data leads to superior performance on few-shot downstream evaluations. We also provide theoretical insights on why aggregation of data expert predictions can provide good approximations to model losses for data mixtures. | Lior Belenki, Alekh Agarwal, Tianze Shi, Kristina Toutanova |  |

While the existing approaches primarily rely on value functions and/or Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), the potential of simpler methods like Best-First Tree Search (BFS) remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate whether BFS can achieve competitive performance in large-scale theorem proving tasks. We present BFS-Prover, a scalable expert iteration framework, featuring three key innovations. First, we implement strategic data filtering at each expert iteration round, excluding problems solvable via beam search node expansion to focus on harder cases. Second, we improve the sample efficiency of BFS through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) applied to state-tactic pairs automatically annotated with compiler error feedback, refining the LLM’s policy... | Ran Xin, Chenguang Xi, Jie Yang, Feng Chen, Hang Wu, Xia Xiao, Yifan Sun, Shen Zheng, Ming Ding |  |

However, their performance may be limited in complex, multi-turn interactions involving users and multiple tools. To address this, we propose Magnet, a principled framework for synthesizing high-quality training trajectories to enhance the function calling capability of large language model agents in multi-turn conversations with humans. The framework is based on automatic and iterative translations from a function signature path to a sequence of queries and executable function calls. We model the complicated function interactions in multi-turn cases with graph and design novel node operations to build reliable signature paths. Motivated by context distillation, when guiding the generation of positive and negative trajectories using a teacher model, we provide reference function call sequences as positive hints in context and contrastive, incorrect function calls as... | Fan Yin, Zifeng Wang, IHung Hsu, Jun Yan, Ke Jiang, Yanfei Chen, Jindong Gu, Long T.

Typical verifiers require resource-intensive supervised dataset construction, which is costly and faces limitations in data diversity. In this paper, we propose LOVER, an unsupervised verifier regularized by logical rules. LOVER treats the verifier as a binary latent variable, utilizing internal activations and enforcing three logical constraints on multiple reasoning paths: negation consistency, intra-group consistency, and inter-group consistency (grouped by the final answer). By incorporating logical rules as priors, LOVER can leverage unlabeled examples and is directly compatible with any off-the-shelf LLMs. Experiments on 10 datasets demonstrate that LOVER significantly outperforms unsupervised baselines, achieving performance comparable to the supervised verifier (reaching its 95% level on average). | Xinyu Wang, Changzhi Sun, Lian Cheng, Yuanbin Wu, Dell Zhang, Xiaoling Wang, Xuelong Li |  |

We propose Squeezed Attention to accelerate LLM applications where a large portion of the input context is fixed.We first leverage K-means clustering offline to group the keys for the fixed context based on semantic similarity and represent each cluster with a single centroid value.During inference, we compare query tokens from the user input with the centroids to predict which keys from the... | Coleman Richard Charles Hooper, Sehoon Kim, Hiva Mohammadzadeh, Monishwaran Maheswaran, Sebastian Zhao, June Paik, Michael W.

Despite advances in neural machine translation (NMT), the development of effective APE systems has been hindered by the lack of large-scale multilingual datasets specifically tailored to NMT outputs. To address this gap, we present and release LangMark, a new human-annotated multilingual APE dataset for English translation to seven languages: Brazilian Portuguese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Russian, and Spanish. The dataset has 206,983 triplets, with each triplet consisting of a source segment, its NMT output, and a human post-edited translation. Annotated by expert human linguists, our dataset offers both linguistic diversity and scale. Leveraging this dataset, we empirically show that Large Language Models (LLMs) with few-shot prompting can effectively perform APE, improving upon leading commercial and even proprietary... | Diego Velazquez, Mikaela Grace, Konstantinos Karageorgos, Lawrence Carin, Aaron Schliem, Dimitrios Zaikis, Roger Wechsler |  |

However, fine-tuned models often struggle outside their specific domains and exhibit considerable redundancy. Recent studies suggest that combining a pruned fine-tuned model with the original pre-trained model can mitigate forgetting, reduce interference when merging model parameters across tasks, and improve compression efficiency. In this context, developing an effective pruning strategy for fine-tuned models is crucial. Leveraging the advantages of the task vector mechanism, we preprocess fine-tuned models by calculating the differences between them and the original model. Recognizing that different task vector subspaces contribute variably to model performance, we introduce a novel method called \*\*N\*\*eural \*\*P\*\*arameter \*\*S\*\*earch (\*\*NPS\*\*) for slimming down fine-tuned models. This method enhances pruning efficiency by searching... | Guodong Du, Zitao Fang, Jing Li, Junlin Li, Runhua Jiang, Shuyang Yu, Yifei Guo, Yangneng Chen, Sim Kuan Goh, HoKin Tang, Daojing He, Honghai Liu, Min Zhang |  |

However, due to potential vulnerabilities in models available on open-source platforms, model merging is susceptible to backdoor attacks. In this paper, we propose Merge Hijacking, the first backdoor attack targeting model merging in LLMs. The attacker constructs a malicious upload model and releases it. Once a victim user merges it with any other models, the resulting merged model inherits the backdoor while maintaining utility across tasks. Merge Hijacking defines two main objectives—effectiveness and utility—and achieves them through four steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack across different models, merging algorithms, and tasks. Additionally, we show that the attack remains effective even when merging real-world models. Moreover, our attack demonstrates robustness against... | Zenghui Yuan, Yangming Xu, Jiawen Shi, Pan Zhou, Lichao Sun |  |

Evaluating LLM Performance on African Languages](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.1572/) |  | 0 | Africa’s rich linguistic heritage remains underrepresented in NLP, largely due to historical policies that favor foreign languages and create significant data inequities. In this paper, we integrate theoretical insights on Africa’s language landscape with an empirical evaluation using Sahara— a comprehensive benchmark curated from large-scale, publicly accessible datasets capturing the continent’s linguistic diversity. By systematically assessing the performance of leading large language models (LLMs) on Sahara, we demonstrate how policy-induced data variations directly impact model effectiveness across African languages. Our findings reveal that while a few languages perform reasonably well, many Indigenous languages remain marginalized due to sparse data. Leveraging these insights, we offer actionable recommendations for policy reforms and inclusive data practices. Overall, our work underscores the urgent need for a dual approach—combining theoretical understanding with empirical... | Ife Adebara, Hawau Olamide Toyin, Nahom Tesfu Ghebremichael, AbdelRahim A.

Despite their success in showing such emergent abilities, the scale and complexity of larger models also lead to unprecedentedly high computational demands and deployment challenges. In reaction, researchers explore transferring the powerful capabilities of larger models to more efficient and compact models by typically aligning the output of smaller (student) models with that of larger (teacher) models. Existing methods either train student models on the generated outputs of teacher models or imitate their token-level probability distributions. However, these distillation methods pay little to no attention to the input, which also plays a crucial role in ICL. Based on the finding that the performance of ICL is highly sensitive to the selection of demonstration examples, we propose Bidirectional Alignment (BiAlign) to fully leverage the models’ preferences for ICL... | Chengwei Qin, Wenhan Xia, Fangkai Jiao, Chen Chen, Yuchen Hu, Bosheng Ding, Ruirui Chen, Shafiq Joty |  |

Current evaluation frameworks, both human and automatic, mainly rely on Natural Language Inference (NLI) to assess binary or ternary supportiveness from cited sources, which we argue is a suboptimal proxy for citation evaluation. In this work we introduce CiteEval, a citation evaluation framework driven by principles focusing on fine-grained citation assessment within a broad context, encompassing not only the cited sources but the full retrieval context, user query, and generated text. Guided by the proposed framework, we construct CiteBench, a multi-domain benchmark with high-quality human annotations on citation quality. To enable efficient evaluation, we further develop CiteEval-Auto, a suite of model-based metrics that exhibit strong correlation with human judgments.

The effectiveness of these agents is significantly influenced by their memory mechanism, which records historical experiences as sequences of action-observation pairs. We categorize memory into two types: cross-trial memory, accumulated across multiple attempts, and in-trial memory (working memory), accumulated within a single attempt. While considerable research has optimized performance through cross-trial memory, the enhancement of agent performance through improved working memory utilization remains underexplored. Instead, existing approaches often involve directly inputting entire historical action-observation pairs into LLMs, leading to redundancy in long-horizon tasks. Inspired by human problem-solving strategies, this paper introduces HiAgent, a framework that... | Mengkang Hu, Tianxing Chen, Qiguang Chen, Yao Mu, Wenqi Shao, Ping Luo |  |

We introduce EducationQ, a multi-agent dialogue framework that efficiently assesses teaching capabilities through simulated dynamic educational scenarios, featuring specialized agents for teaching, learning, and evaluation. Testing 14 LLMs across major AI Organizations (OpenAI, Meta, Google, Anthropic, and others) on 1,498 questions spanning 13 disciplines and 10 difficulty levels reveals that teaching effectiveness does not correlate linearly with model scale or general reasoning capabilities - with some smaller open-source models outperforming larger commercial counterparts in teaching contexts.

Students are asked to analyze literary and cultural texts through a process known as close reading, where they gather textual details from which to formulate evidence-based arguments. Despite being viewed as a basis for critical thinking and widely adopted as a required element of university coursework, close reading has never been evaluated on large language models (LLMs), and multi-discipline benchmarks like MMLU do not include literature as a subject. To fill this gap, we present KRISTEVA, the first close reading benchmark for evaluating interpretive reasoning, consisting of 1331 multiple-choice questions adapted from classroom data. With KRISTEVA, we propose three progressively more difficult sets of tasks to approximate different elements of the close reading process, which we use to test how well LLMs understand and reason about literary works: 1) extracting stylistic features, 2)... | Peiqi Sui, Juan Diego Rodriguez, Philippe Laban, Dean Murphy, Joseph P.

However, we observe a consistent phenomenon across different model sizes and domains: a temporary performance drop at the start of the continual pretraining process, followed by a performance recovery phase. To gain a deeper understanding of this issue, we use the stability gap— a concept adapted from the visual domain—which explains this initial drop arises from instability in the model’s general abilities. We validate this hypothesis through a series of experiments. To address this initial instability and enhance LLM performance within a fixed compute budget, we propose a training strategy that mitigates instability by increasing the number of epochs, alongside two data sampling strategies targeting data domain relevance and corpus distribution. We conduct experiments on Llama-family models to validate the effectiveness of our strategies for continual pretraining and... | Yiduo Guo, Jie Fu, Huishuai Zhang, Dongyan Zhao |  |

We introduce PALM, a year-long community-driven project covering all 22 Arab countries. The dataset contains instruction–response pairs in both Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and dialectal Arabic (DA), spanning 20 diverse topics. Built by a team of 44 researchers across the Arab world—each an author of this paper—PALM offers a broad, inclusive perspective. We use PALM to evaluate the cultural and dialectal capabilities of several frontier LLMs, revealing notable limitations: while closed-source LLMs generally perform strongly, they still exhibit flaws, and smaller open-source models face greater challenges. Furthermore, certain countries (e.g., Egypt, the UAE) appear better represented than others (e.g., Iraq, Mauritania, Yemen).

To address this gap, we focus on journalistic interviews, a domain rich in grounding communication and abundant in data. We curate a dataset of 40,000 two-person informational interviews from NPR and CNN, and reveal that LLMs are significantly less likely than human interviewers to use acknowledgements and to pivot to higher-level questions. Realizing that a fundamental deficit exists in multi-turn planning and strategic thinking, we develop a realistic simulated environment, incorporating source personas and persuasive elements, in order to facilitate the development of agents with longer-horizon rewards. Our experiments show that while source LLMs mimic human behavior in information sharing, interviewer LLMs struggle with recognizing when questions are answered and engaging persuasively, leading to suboptimal... | Alexander Spangher, Michael Lu, Sriya Kalyan, Hyundong Justin Cho, Tenghao Huang, Weiyan Shi, Jonathan May |  |

To address these challenges, we propose Cross-source knowledge Reconciliation for MultiModal RAG (CoRe-MMRAG), a novel end-to-end framework that effectively reconciles inconsistencies across knowledge sources. CoRe-MMRAG follows a four-stage pipeline: it first generates an internal response from parametric knowledge, then selects the most relevant multimodal evidence via joint similarity assessment, generates an external response, and finally integrates both to produce a reliable... | Yang Tian, Fan Liu, Jingyuan Zhang, Victoria W., Yupeng Hu, Liqiang Nie |  |

This approach has a solid theoretical basis: when treated as model coordinates, their squared Euclidean distance approximates the Kullback-Leibler divergence of text-generation probabilities. Our method is highly scalable, with computational cost growing linearly in both the number of models and text samples, and is easy to implement as the required features are derived from cross-entropy loss. Applying this method to over 1,000 language models, we constructed a “model map,” providing a new perspective on large-scale model analysis. | Momose Oyama, Hiroaki Yamagiwa, Yusuke Takase, Hidetoshi Shimodaira |  |

Traditional self-consistency methods often fail to capture subtle semantic errors in multi-step tasks. We introduce ConsistencyChecker, a tree-based evaluation framework that measures LLMs’ ability to preserve semantic consistency during reversible transformation processes, sidestepping benchmark data contamination issues. Our approach constructs self-consistency trees where nodes represent text states after transformations (e.g., translation, code modification, paraphrasing) and edges represent pairs of opposite transformations. By analyzing semantic preservation between nodes at different tree depths, ConsistencyChecker quantifies model reliability without requiring manually annotated reference data. Experiments demonstrate that ConsistencyChecker reliably measures generalization abilities across models from 1.5B to 72B parameters. On... | Zhaochen Hong, Haofei Yu, Jiaxuan You |  |

To address this gap, we contribute a case study illustrating how linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) can rigorously capture systematic language-dependent differences (i.e., population-level effects) in a population of monolingual and multilingual language models. In the context of a bilingual hate speech detection task, we demonstrate that LMMs can uncover significant population-level effects—even under low-resource (small-N) experimental designs—while mitigating confounds and random noise. By setting out a transparent blueprint for repeated-measures experimentation, we encourage the NLP community to embrace variability as a feature, rather than a nuisance, in order to advance more robust, reproducible, and ultimately trustworthy results. | Alejandro BenitoSantos, Adrián Ghajari, Víctor Fresno |  |

We introduce VERIFY, an evidence-based evaluation pipeline that measures LMs’ factuality in real-world user interactions. VERIFY considers the verifiability of LM-generated content and categorizes content units as Supported, Unsupported, or Undecidable based on Web-retrieved evidence. Importantly, factuality judgment by VERIFY more strongly correlates with human evaluations than existing methods. Using VERIFY, we identify “hallucination prompts,” i.e., those that frequently elicit factual errors in LM responses. These prompts form FactBench, a dataset of 1K prompts spanning 150 topics and tiered into Easy, Moderate, and Hard prompts. We benchmark widely-used openweight and proprietary LMs from six families, yielding three key findings: (i) LMs’ factual precision declines from Easy to Hard prompts, (ii) factuality does not... | Farima Fatahi Bayat, Lechen Zhang, Sheza Munir, Lu Wang |  |

The release of open-source LLMs like LLaMA and Qwen has triggered the development of numerous fine-tuned models tailored for various tasks and languages. In this paper, we explore an important question: is it possible to combine these specialized models to create a unified model with multi-task capabilities. We introduces \*\*H\*\*ierarchical \*\*I\*\*terative \*\*Merging\*\* (Hi-Merging), a training-free method for unifying different specialized LLMs into a single model. Specifically, Hi-Merging employs model-wise and layer-wise pruning and scaling, guided by contribution analysis, to mitigate parameter conflicts. Extensive experiments on multiple-choice and question-answering tasks in both Chinese and English validate Hi-Merging’s ability for multi-task learning. The results demonstrate that Hi-Merging consistently outperforms existing merging techniques... | Zichuan Fu, Xian Wu, Yejing Wang, Wanyu Wang, Shanshan Ye, Hongzhi Yin, Yi Chang, Yefeng Zheng, Xiangyu Zhao |  |

Many tasks such as preference optimization, require the model to produce task-level output consisting of multiple tokens directly by selecting candidates from a pool as predictions. Determining a task-level prediction from candidates using the ordinary token-level decoding mechanism is constrained by time-consuming decoding and interrupted gradients by discrete token selection. Existing works have been using decoding-free candidate selection methods to obtain candidate probability from initial output logits over vocabulary. Though these estimation methods are widely used, they are not systematically evaluated, especially on end tasks. We introduce an evaluation of a comprehensive collection of decoding-free candidate selection approaches on a comprehensive set of tasks, including five multiple-choice QA tasks with a small candidate pool and four clinical decision tasks with a... | Mingyu Derek Ma, Yanna Ding, Zijie Huang, Jianxi Gao, Yizhou Sun, Wei Wang |  |

As individuals have their own, multi-dimensional preferences, recent studies have explored \*multi-dimensional personalization\*, which aims to enable models to generate responses personalized to \*explicit\* preferences. However, human preferences are often \*implicit\* and thus difficult to articulate, limiting the direct application of this approach. To bridge this gap, we propose Active Multi-dimensional Preference Learning (AMPLe), designed to capture implicit user preferences from interactively collected comparative feedback. Building on Bayesian inference, our work introduces a modified posterior update procedure to mitigate estimation bias and potential noise in comparisons. Also, inspired by generalized binary search, we employ an active query selection strategy to minimize the number of required comparisons by a user. Through theoretical analysis and... | Minhyeon Oh, Seungjoon Lee, Jungseul Ok |  |

However, open-access code LLMs mostly only release weights, lacking key features such as reproducible data pipelines and transparent training protocols, which are crucial for advancing deeper, more reliable investigations. To address the gap, we introduce OpenCoder, a top-tier code LLM that not only achieves performance comparable to leading models but also serves as an “open cookbook” for the research community. Unlike most prior efforts, we release not only model weights and inference code, but also the reproducible training data, complete data processing pipeline, rigorous experimental ablation results, and detailed training protocols for open scientific research. Our work identifies the key ingredients for building a top-tier code LLM: optimized heuristic rules for data cleaning and deduplication, effective recall of code-related text corpus, and high-quality... | Siming Huang, Tianhao Cheng, Jason Klein Liu, Weidi Xu, Jiaran Hao, Liuyihan Song, Yang Xu, Jian Yang, Jiaheng Liu, Chenchen Zhang, Linzheng Chai, Ruifeng Yuan, Xianzhen Luo, Qiufeng Wang, YuanTao Fan, Qingfu Zhu, Zhaoxiang Zhang, Yang Gao, Jie Fu, Qian Liu, Houyi Li, Ge Zhang, Yuan Qi, Yinghui Xu, Wei Chu, Zili Wang |  |

In this work, we introduce an LLMOps pipeline, “LlamaDuo”, for the seamless migration of knowledge and abilities from service-oriented LLMs to smaller, locally manageable models. This pipeline is crucial for ensuring service continuity in the presence of operational failures, strict privacy policies, or offline requirements. Our LlamaDuo involves fine-tuning a small language model against the service LLM using a synthetic dataset generated by the latter. If the performance of the fine-tuned model falls short of expectations, it is automatically improved through additional fine-tuning using extra similar data generated by the service LLM. This multi-turn process guarantees that the smaller model can eventually match or even surpass the service LLM’s capabilities... | Chansung Park, Juyong Jiang, Fan Wang, Sayak Paul, Jing Tang |  |

However, dealing with ambiguous instructions in real-world environments remains a challenge for LLMs. Various methods for task ambiguity detection have been proposed. However, it is difficult to compare them because they are tested on different datasets and there is no universal benchmark. For this reason, we propose AmbiK (Ambiguous Tasks in Kitchen Environment), the fully textual dataset of ambiguous instructions addressed to a robot in a kitchen environment. AmbiK was collected with the assistance of LLMs and is human-validated. It comprises 1000 pairs of ambiguous tasks and their unambiguous counterparts, categorized by ambiguity type (Human Preferences, Common Sense Knowledge, Safety), with environment descriptions, clarifying questions and answers, user intents, and task plans, for a total of 2000 tasks. We hope that AmbiK will... | Anastasiia Ivanova, Eva Bakaeva, Zoya Volovikova, Alexey K. Kovalev, Aleksandr Panov |  |

Misinterpreting cultural content can lead to AI-generated responses that are offensive or inappropriate, limiting their usability in global applications such as customer service, diplomatic communication, and online education. While prior research has evaluated cultural knowledge of LLMs, existing benchmarks fail to assess dynamic cultural competence-the ability to apply cultural knowledge effectively in real-world interactions. To address this gap, we introduce SocialDuolingo, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate cultural competence through multi-turn interactive intercultural scenarios. It comprises 3,060 human-written scenarios spanning 60 countries across six continents. Through extensive experiments on eight prominent LLMs, our findings reveal a significant gap between the cultural knowledge stored in these models and their ability to apply it... | Jincenzi Wu, Jianxun Lian, Dingdong Wang, Helen M.

The following three key improvements contribute to SAIL-VL’s leading performance: (1) Scalable high-quality visual understanding data construction: We implement a data construction pipeline to enable hundred-million-scale high-quality recaption data annotation. The resulted dataset SAIL-Caption is validated to be of the highest data quality compared with opensource datasets. (2) Scalable Pretraining with High-Quality Visual Understanding Data: We scale SAIL-VL’s pretraining budget up to 655B tokens and show that even a 2B VLM benefits from scaled up training data sizes, exhibiting logarithmic data size scaling laws in benchmark performance. (3) Scalable SFT via data quantity and complexity scaling: We curate a high-quality SFT dataset collection with... | Hongyuan Dong, Zijian Kang, Weijie Yin, LiangXiao LiangXiao, ChaoFeng ChaoFeng, Ran Jiao |  |

However, existing studies face two key limitations in (i) incorporating implicit item relationships and (ii) utilizing rich yet lengthy item information. To address these challenges, we propose a Generative Recommender via semantic-Aware Multi-granular late fusion (GRAM), introducing two synergistic innovations. First, we design semantic-to-lexical translation to encode implicit hierarchical and collaborative item relationships into the vocabulary space of LLMs. Second, we present multi-granular late fusion to integrate rich semantics efficiently with minimal information loss. It employs separate encoders for multi-granular prompts, delaying the fusion until the decoding stage. Experiments on four benchmark datasets show that GRAM outperforms eight state-of-the-art generative recommendation models,... | Sunkyung Lee, Minjin Choi, Eunseong Choi, Hyeyoung Kim, Jongwuk Lee |  |

Compared to MLA, standard LLMs employing Multi-Head Attention (MHA) and its variants such as Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) exhibit significant cost disadvantages. Enabling well-trained LLMs (e.g., Llama) to rapidly adapt to MLA without pre-training from scratch is both meaningful and challenging. This paper proposes the first data-efficient fine-tuning method for transitioning from MHA to MLA (\*\*MHA2MLA\*\*), which includes two key components: for \*partial-RoPE\*, we remove RoPE from dimensions of queries and keys that contribute less to the attention scores, for \*low-rank approximation\*, we introduce joint SVD approximations based on the pre-trained parameters of keys and values. These carefully designed strategies enable MHA2MLA to recover performance using only a... | Tao Ji, Bin Guo, Yuanbin Wu, Qipeng Guo, Shenlixing Shenlixing, Chenzhan Chenzhan, Xipeng Qiu, Qi Zhang, Tao Gui |  |

Unlike existing methods that optimize for a single request or a group of requests as a whole, TETRIS actively selects the most promising draft tokens (for every request in a batch) to be accepted when verified in parallel, resulting in fewer rejected tokens and hence less wasted computing resources. Such an effective resource utilization to achieve fast inference in large language models (LLMs) is especially important to service providers with limited inference capacity. Compared to baseline speculative decoding, TETRIS yields a consistently higher acceptance rate and more effective utilization of the limited inference capacity. We show theoretically and empirically that TETRIS outperforms baseline speculative decoding and existing methods that dynamically select draft tokens, leading to a more efficient batch inference in LLMs. | Zhaoxuan Wu, Zijian Zhou, Arun Verma, Alok Prakash, Daniela Rus, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low |  |

Traditional methods that rely on 1:1 pairwise comparisons often fail to capture inconsistencies that only emerge when more than two statements are evaluated collectively. To address this gap, we introduce the task of set-consistency verification, an extension of natural language inference (NLI) that assesses the logical coherence of entire sets rather than isolated pairs. Building on this task, we present the Set-Consistency Energy Network (SC-Energy), a novel model that employs a margin-based loss to learn the compatibility among a collection of statements. Our approach not only efficiently verifies inconsistencies and pinpoints the specific statements responsible for logical contradictions, but also significantly outperforms existing methods, including... | Mooho Song, Hye Ryung Son, JayYoon Lee |  |

This harmful behavior can be hard to detect, unlike blatant lying or unintentional hallucination. We build a simple testbed mimicking a legislative environment where a corporate lobbyist module is proposing amendments to bills that benefit a specific company while evading identification of this benefactor. We use real-world legislative bills matched with potentially affected companies to ground these interactions. Our results show that LLM lobbyists can draft subtle phrasing to avoid such identification by strong LLM-based detectors. Further optimization of the phrasing using LLM-based re-planning and re-sampling increases deception rates by up to 40 percentage points.Our human evaluations to verify the quality of deceptive generations and their retention of self-serving intent show significant coherence with our automated... | Atharvan Dogra, Krishna Pillutla, Ameet Deshpande, Ananya B.

To address this, we present AfroCS-xs, a small human-validated synthetic code-switched dataset for four African languages (Afrikaans, Sesotho, Yoruba, isiZulu) and English within a specific domain—agriculture. Using large language models (LLMs), we generate code-switched sentences, including English translations, that are rigorously validated and corrected by native speakers. As a downstream evaluation task, we use this dataset to fine-tune different instruction-tuned LLMs for code-switched translation and compare their performance against machine translation (MT) models. Our results demonstrate that LLMs consistently improve in translation accuracy when fine-tuned on the high-quality AfroCS-xs dataset, highlighting that substantial gains can still be made with a low volume of data. We also observe improvements on natural code-switched... | Kayode Olaleye, Arturo Oncevay, Mathieu Sibue, Nombuyiselo Zondi, Michelle Terblanche, Sibongile Mapikitla, Richard Lastrucci, Charese Smiley, Vukosi Marivate |  |

This remarkable property has led some to believe that parallel data is no longer necessary for building multilingual language models. While some attribute this to the emergent abilities of LLMs due to scale, recent work suggests that it is actually caused by incidental bilingual signals present in the training data. Various methods have been proposed to maximize the utility of parallel data to enhance the multilingual capabilities of multilingual encoder-based and encoder-decoder language models. However, some decoder-based LLMs opt to ignore parallel data instead. In this work, we conduct a systematic study on the impact of adding parallel data on LLMs’ multilingual capabilities, focusing specifically on translation and multilingual common-sense reasoning. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate that parallel data can significantly improve... | Muhammad Reza Qorib, Junyi Li, Hwee Tou Ng |  |

Moreover, existing open-source VLMs lack systematic exploration into extending their context length, and commercial models often provide limited details. To tackle this, we aim to establish an effective solution that enhances long context performance of VLMs while preserving their capacities in short context scenarios. Towards this goal, we make the best design choice through extensive experiment settings from data curation to context window extending and utilizing: (1) we analyze data sources and length distributions to construct ETVLM - a data recipe to balance the performance across scenarios; (2) we examine existing position extending methods, identify their limitations and propose M-RoPE++ as an enhanced approach; we also choose to solely... | Mukai Li, Lei Li, Shansan Gong, Qi Liu |  |
