| 1 |  |  [A Gentle Introduction to Deep Nets and Opportunities for the Future](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2022.acl-tutorials.1) |  | 0 | The first half of this tutorial will make deep nets more accessible to a broader audience, following “Deep Nets for Poets” and “A Gentle Introduction to Fine-Tuning.” We will also introduce GFT (general fine tuning), a little language for fine tuning deep nets with short (one line) programs that are as easy to code as regression in statistics packages such as R using glm (general linear models). Based on the success of these methods on a number of benchmarks, one might come away with the... | Kenneth Church, Valia Kordoni, Gary Marcus, Ernest Davis, Yanjun Ma, Zeyu Chen |  |
| 2 |  |  [Towards Reproducible Machine Learning Research in Natural Language Processing](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2022.acl-tutorials.2) |  | 0 | While recent progress in the field of ML has been significant, the reproducibility of these cutting-edge results is often lacking, with many submissions lacking the necessary information in order to ensure subsequent reproducibility. Despite proposals such as the Reproducibility Checklist and reproducibility criteria at several major conferences, the reflex for carrying out research with reproducibility in mind is lacking in the broader ML community. We propose this tutorial as a gentle... | Ana Lucic, Maurits J. R. Bleeker, Samarth Bhargav, Jessica Zosa Forde, Koustuv Sinha, Jesse Dodge, Sasha Luccioni, Robert Stojnic |  |
| 3 |  |  [Knowledge-Augmented Methods for Natural Language Processing](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2022.acl-tutorials.3) |  | 0 | Knowledge in natural language processing (NLP) has been a rising trend especially after the advent of large scale pre-trained models. NLP models with attention to knowledge can i) access unlimited amount of external information; ii) delegate the task of storing knowledge from its parameter space to knowledge sources; iii) obtain up-to-date information; iv) make prediction results more explainable via selected knowledge. In this tutorial, we will introduce the key steps in integrating knowledge... | Chenguang Zhu, Yichong Xu, Xiang Ren, Bill Y. Lin, Meng Jiang, Wenhao Yu |  |
| 4 |  |  [Non-Autoregressive Sequence Generation](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2022.acl-tutorials.4) |  | 0 | Non-autoregressive sequence generation (NAR) attempts to generate the entire or partial output sequences in parallel to speed up the generation process and avoid potential issues (e.g., label bias, exposure bias) in autoregressive generation. While it has received much research attention and has been applied in many sequence generation tasks in natural language and speech, naive NAR models still face many challenges to close the performance gap between state-of-the-art autoregressive models... | Jiatao Gu, Xu Tan |  |
| 5 |  |  [Learning with Limited Text Data](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2022.acl-tutorials.5) |  | 0 | Natural Language Processing (NLP) has achieved great progress in the past decade on the basis of neural models, which often make use of large amounts of labeled data to achieve state-of-the-art performance. The dependence on labeled data prevents NLP models from being applied to low-resource settings and languages because of the time, money, and expertise that is often required to label massive amounts of textual data. Consequently, the ability to learn with limited labeled data is crucial for... | Diyi Yang, Ankur P. Parikh, Colin Raffel |  |
| 6 |  |  [Zero- and Few-Shot NLP with Pretrained Language Models](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2022.acl-tutorials.6) |  | 0 | The ability to efficiently learn from little-to-no data is critical to applying NLP to tasks where data collection is costly or otherwise difficult. This is a challenging setting both academically and practically—particularly because training neutral models typically require large amount of labeled data. More recently, advances in pretraining on unlabelled data have brought up the potential of better zero-shot or few-shot learning (Devlin et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020). In particular, over... | Iz Beltagy, Arman Cohan, Robert L. Logan IV, Sewon Min, Sameer Singh |  |
| 7 |  |  [Vision-Language Pretraining: Current Trends and the Future](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2022.acl-tutorials.7) |  | 0 | In the last few years, there has been an increased interest in building multimodal (vision-language) models that are pretrained on larger but noisier datasets where the two modalities (e.g., image and text) loosely correspond to each other (e.g., Lu et al., 2019; Radford et al., 2021). Given a task (such as visual question answering), these models are then often fine-tuned on task-specific supervised datasets. (e.g., Lu et al., 2019; Chen et al.,2020; Tan and Bansal, 2019; Li et al., 2020a,b).... | Aishwarya Agrawal, Damien Teney, Aida Nematzadeh |  |
| 8 |  |  [Natural Language Processing for Multilingual Task-Oriented Dialogue](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2022.acl-tutorials.8) |  | 0 | Recent advances in deep learning have also enabled fast progress in the research of task-oriented dialogue (ToD) systems. However, the majority of ToD systems are developed for English and merely a handful of other widely spoken languages, e.g., Chinese and German. This hugely limits the global reach and, consequently, transformative socioeconomic potential of such systems. In this tutorial, we will thus discuss and demonstrate the importance of (building) multilingual ToD systems, and then... | Evgeniia Razumovskaia, Goran Glavas, Olga Majewska, Edoardo Maria Ponti, Ivan Vulic |  |
| 9 |  |  [DoTAT: A Domain-oriented Text Annotation Tool](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2022.acl-demo.1) |  | 0 | We propose DoTAT, a domain-oriented text annotation tool. The tool designs and implements functions heavily in need in domain-oriented information extraction. Firstly, the tool supports a multi-person collaborative process with automatically merging and review, which can greatly improve the annotation accuracy. Secondly, the tool provides annotation of events, nested event and nested entity, which are frequently required in domain-related text structuring tasks. Finally, DoTAT provides visual... | Yupian Lin, Tong Ruan, Ming Liang, Tingting Cai, Wen Du, Yi Wang |  |
| 10 |  |  [UKP-SQUARE: An Online Platform for Question Answering Research](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2022.acl-demo.2) |  | 0 | Recent advances in NLP and information retrieval have given rise to a diverse set of question answering tasks that are of different formats (e.g., extractive, abstractive), require different model architectures (e.g., generative, discriminative), and setups (e.g., with or without retrieval). Despite having a large number of powerful, specialized QA pipelines (which we refer to as Skills) that consider a single domain, model or setup, there exists no framework where users can easily explore and... | Tim Baumgärtner, Kexin Wang, Rachneet Sachdeva, Gregor Geigle, Max Eichler, Clifton Poth, Hannah Sterz, Haritz Puerto, Leonardo F. R. Ribeiro, Jonas Pfeiffer, Nils Reimers, Gözde Gül Sahin, Iryna Gurevych |  |
| 11 |  |  [ViLMedic: a framework for research at the intersection of vision and language in medical AI](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2022.acl-demo.3) |  | 0 | There is a growing need to model interactions between data modalities (e.g., vision, language) — both to improve AI predictions on existing tasks and to enable new applications. In the recent field of multimodal medical AI, integrating multiple modalities has gained widespread popularity as multimodal models have proven to improve performance, robustness, require less training samples and add complementary information. To improve technical reproducibility and transparency for multimodal medical... | JeanBenoit Delbrouck, Khaled Saab, Maya Varma, Sabri Eyuboglu, Pierre J. Chambon, Jared Dunnmon, Juan Zambrano, Akshay Chaudhari, Curtis P. Langlotz |  |

In this paper, we introduce TextPruner, an open-source model pruning toolkit designed for pre-trained language models, targeting fast and easy model compression. TextPruner offers structured post-training pruning methods, including vocabulary pruning and transformer pruning, and can be applied to... | Ziqing Yang, Yiming Cui, Zhigang Chen |  |
| 13 |  |  [AnnIE: An Annotation Platform for Constructing Complete Open Information Extraction Benchmark](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2022.acl-demo.5) |  | 0 | Open Information Extraction (OIE) is the task of extracting facts from sentences in the form of relations and their corresponding arguments in schema-free manner. Intrinsic performance of OIE systems is difficult to measure due to the incompleteness of existing OIE benchmarks: ground truth extractions do not group all acceptable surface realizations of the same fact that can be extracted from a sentence. To measure performance of OIE systems more realistically, it is necessary to manually... | Niklas Friedrich, Kiril Gashteovski, Mingying Yu, Bhushan Kotnis, Carolin Lawrence, Mathias Niepert, Goran Glavas |  |
| 14 |  |  [AdapterHub Playground: Simple and Flexible Few-Shot Learning with Adapters](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2022.acl-demo.6) |  | 0 | The open-access dissemination of pretrained language models through online repositories has led to a democratization of state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) research. This also allows people outside of NLP to use such models and adapt them to specific use-cases. However, a certain amount of technical proficiency is still required which is an entry barrier for users who want to apply these models to a certain task but lack the necessary knowledge or resources. In this work, we aim... | Tilman Beck, Bela Bohlender, Christina Viehmann, Vincent Hane, Yanik Adamson, Jaber Khuri, Jonas Brossmann, Jonas Pfeiffer, Iryna Gurevych |  |
| 15 |  |  [QiuNiu: A Chinese Lyrics Generation System with Passage-Level Input](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2022.acl-demo.7) |  | 0 | Lyrics generation has been a very popular application of natural language generation. Previous works mainly focused on generating lyrics based on a couple of attributes or keywords, rendering very limited control over the content of the lyrics. In this paper, we demonstrate the QiuNiu, a Chinese lyrics generation system which is conditioned on passage-level text rather than a few attributes or keywords. By using the passage-level text as input, the content of generated lyrics is expected to... | Le Zhang, Rongsheng Zhang, Xiaoxi Mao, Yongzhu Chang |  |
| 16 |  |  [Automatic Gloss Dictionary for Sign Language Learners](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2022.acl-demo.8) |  | 0 | A multi-language dictionary is a fundamental tool for language learning, allowing the learner to look up unfamiliar words. Searching an unrecognized word in the dictionary does not usually require deep knowledge of the target language. However, this is not true for sign language, where gestural elements preclude this type of easy lookup. This paper introduces GlossFinder, an online tool supporting 2, 000 signs to assist language learners in determining the meaning of given signs. Unlike... | Chenchen Xu, Dongxu Li, Hongdong Li, Hanna Suominen, Ben Swift |  |
| 17 |  |  [PromptSource: An Integrated Development Environment and Repository for Natural Language Prompts](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2022.acl-demo.9) |  | 0 | PromptSource is a system for creating, sharing, and using natural language prompts. Prompts are functions that map an example from a dataset to a natural language input and target output. Using prompts to train and query language models is an emerging area in NLP that requires new tools that let users develop and refine these prompts collaboratively. PromptSource addresses the emergent challenges in this new setting with (1) a templating language for defining data-linked prompts, (2) an... | Stephen H. Bach, Victor Sanh, Zheng Xin Yong, Albert Webson, Colin Raffel, Nihal V. Nayak, Abheesht Sharma, Taewoon Kim, M. Saiful Bari, Thibault Févry, Zaid Alyafeai, Manan Dey, Andrea Santilli, Zhiqing Sun, Srulik BenDavid, Canwen Xu, Gunjan Chhablani, Han Wang, Jason Alan Fries, Maged Saeed AlShaibani, Shanya Sharma, Urmish Thakker, Khalid Almubarak, Xiangru Tang, Dragomir R. Radev, Mike TianJian Jiang, Alexander M. Rush |  |
| 18 |  |  [OpenPrompt: An Open-source Framework for Prompt-learning](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2022.acl-demo.10) |  | 0 | Prompt-learning has become a new paradigm in modern natural language processing, which directly adapts pre-trained language models (PLMs) to cloze-style prediction, autoregressive modeling, or sequence to sequence generation, resulting in promising performances on various tasks. However, no standard implementation framework of prompt-learning is proposed yet, and most existing prompt- learning codebases, often unregulated, only provide limited implementations for specific scenarios. Since there... | Ning Ding, Shengding Hu, Weilin Zhao, Yulin Chen, Zhiyuan Liu, Haitao Zheng, Maosong Sun |  |
| 19 |  |  [Guided K-best Selection for Semantic Parsing Annotation](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2022.acl-demo.11) |  | 0 | Collecting data for conversational semantic parsing is a time-consuming and demanding process. In this paper we consider, given an incomplete dataset with only a small amount of data, how to build an AI-powered human-in-the-loop process to enable efficient data collection. A guided K-best selection process is proposed, which (i) generates a set of possible valid candidates; (ii) allows users to quickly traverse the set and filter incorrect parses; and (iii) asks users to select the correct... | Anton Belyy, ChiehYang Huang, Jacob Andreas, Emmanouil Antonios Platanios, Sam Thomson, Richard Shin, Subhro Roy, Aleksandr Nisnevich, Charles Chen, Benjamin Van Durme |  |
| 20 |  |  [Hard and Soft Evaluation of NLP models with BOOtSTrap SAmpling - BooStSa](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2022.acl-demo.12) |  | 0 | Natural Language Processing (NLP) ‘s applied nature makes it necessary to select the most effective and robust models. Producing slightly higher performance is insufficient; we want to know whether this advantage will carry over to other data sets. Bootstrapped significance tests can indicate that ability. So while necessary, computing the significance of models’ performance differences has many levels of complexity. It can be tedious, especially when the experimental design has many conditions... | Tommaso Fornaciari, Alexandra Uma, Massimo Poesio, Dirk Hovy |  |
| 21 |  |  [COVID-19 Claim Radar: A Structured Claim Extraction and Tracking System](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2022.acl-demo.13) |  | 0 | To tackle the challenge of accurate and timely communication regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, we present a COVID-19 Claim Radar to automatically extract supporting and refuting claims on a daily basis.

| 29 |  |  [HOSMEL: A Hot-Swappable Modularized Entity Linking Toolkit for Chinese](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2022.acl-demo.21) |  | 0 | We investigate the usage of entity linking (EL)in downstream tasks and present the first modularized EL toolkit for easy task adaptation. Different from the existing EL methods that dealwith all the features simultaneously, we modularize the whole model into separate parts witheach feature. This decoupled design enablesflexibly adding new features without retraining the whole model as well as flow visualization with better interpretability of the ELresult. We release the corresponding... | Daniel Zhangli, Jing Zhang, Jifan Yu, Xiaokang Zhang, Peng Zhang, Jie Tang, Juanzi Li |  |
| 30 |  |  [BMInf: An Efficient Toolkit for Big Model Inference and Tuning](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2022.acl-demo.22) |  | 0 | In recent years, large-scale pre-trained language models (PLMs) containing billions of parameters have achieved promising results on various NLP tasks. Although we can pre-train these big models by stacking computing clusters at any cost, it is impractical to use such huge computing resources to apply big models for each downstream task. To address the computation bottleneck encountered in deploying big models in real-world scenarios, we introduce an open-source toolkit for big model inference... | Xu Han, Guoyang Zeng, Weilin Zhao, Zhiyuan Liu, Zhengyan Zhang, Jie Zhou, Jun Zhang, Jia Chao, Maosong Sun |  |
| 31 |  |  [MMEKG: Multi-modal Event Knowledge Graph towards Universal Representation across Modalities](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2022.acl-demo.23) |  | 0 | Events are fundamental building blocks of real-world happenings.

The experiments include both zero-shot settings as well as multilingual models. Previous studies have found that even a comparably small treebank from a closely related language will improve sequence labelling considerably in such cases. Results from both POS tagging and dependency parsing... | Frederic Blum |  |
| 38 |  |  [RFBFN: A Relation-First Blank Filling Network for Joint Relational Triple Extraction](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2022.acl-srw.2) |  | 0 | Joint relational triple extraction from unstructured text is an important task in information extraction. However, most existing works either ignore the semantic information of relations or predict subjects and objects sequentially. To address the issues, we introduce a new blank filling paradigm for the task, and propose a relation-first blank filling network (RFBFN). Specifically, we first detect potential relations maintained in the text to aid the following entity pair extraction. Then, we... | Zhe Li, Luoyi Fu, Xinbing Wang, Haisong Zhang, Chenghu Zhou |  |
| 39 |  |  [Building a Dialogue Corpus Annotated with Expressed and Experienced Emotions](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2022.acl-srw.3) |  | 0 | In communication, a human would recognize the emotion of an interlocutor and respond with an appropriate emotion, such as empathy and comfort. Toward developing a dialogue system with such a human-like ability, we propose a method to build a dialogue corpus annotated with two kinds of emotions. We collect dialogues from Twitter and annotate each utterance with the emotion that a speaker put into the utterance (expressed emotion) and the emotion that a listener felt after listening to the... | Tatsuya Ide, Daisuke Kawahara |  |
| 40 |  |  [Darkness can not drive out darkness: Investigating Bias in Hate SpeechDetection Models](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2022.acl-srw.4) |  | 0 | It has become crucial to develop tools for automated hate speech and abuse detection. These tools would help to stop the bullies and the haters and provide a safer environment for individuals especially from marginalized groups to freely express themselves. However, recent research shows that machine learning models are biased and they might make the right decisions for the wrong reasons. In this thesis, I set out to understand the performance of hate speech and abuse detection models and the... | Fatma Elsafoury |  |
| 41 |  |  [Ethical Considerations for Low-resourced Machine Translation](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2022.acl-srw.5) |  | 0 | This paper considers some ethical implications of machine translation for low-resourced languages. I use Armenian as a case study and investigate specific needs for and concerns arising from the creation and deployment of improved machine translation between English and Armenian. To do this, I conduct stakeholder interviews and construct Value Scenarios (Nathan et al., 2007) from the themes that emerge. These scenarios illustrate some of the potential harms that low-resourced language... | Levon Haroutunian |  |

The conversational question rewrites (QR) task has been shown to be effective to solve this problem by reformulating questions in a self-contained form. However, QR datasets are limited and existing methods tend to depend on the assumption of the existence of corresponding QR datasets for every CQA dataset. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning approach... | Etsuko Ishii, Bryan Wilie, Yan Xu, Samuel Cahyawijaya, Pascale Fung |  |

Although neural approaches have achieved high performance in various types of NLI, including NLI between semi-structured tables and texts, they still have difficulty in performing a numerical type of inference, such as counting. To handle a numerical type of inference, we propose a logical inference system for reasoning between semi-structured tables and texts. We... | Tomoya Kurosawa, Hitomi Yanaka |  |

Sequence labelling aims to assign a label to each word in an input text using, for example, BIO (Begin, Inside and Outside) tagging, while span classification involves enumerating all possible spans in a text and classifying them into their labels. In contrast to sequence labelling, unconstrained span-based methods tend to assign entity labels to overlapping spans, which is generally... | Urchade Zaratiana, Nadi Tomeh, Pierre Holat, Thierry Charnois |  |

In the presence of a dominant high-certainty class, for instance the non-entity class in NER problems, existing calibration error measures are completely insensitive to potentially large errors in this certainty region of interest. We introduce a region-balanced calibration error... | Hillary Dawkins, Isar Nejadgholi |  |

While previous studies have used the tools of psycholinguistics to probe a transformer’s ability to reason over negation, none have focused on the types of negation studied in developmental psychology. We explore how well transformers can process such categories of negation, by framing the problem as a natural language inference (NLI) task.

The difficulty comes from generating the complex graph structure. The previous state-of-the-art method translates the AMR graph into a sequence, then directly fine-tunes a pretrained sequence-to-sequence Transformer model (BART).

For example, the words chopped, chef, and onion are more likely used to convey “The chef chopped the onion,” not “The onion chopped the chef.” Recent work has shown large language models to be surprisingly word order invariant, but crucially has largely considered natural prototypical inputs, where compositional meaning mostly matches lexical expectations.

However, we argue that simply applying both techniques can be conflicting and even leads to sub-optimal performance. When allocating smoothed probability, original label smoothing treats the source-side words that would never appear in the target language equally to the real target-side words, which could bias the translation model. To address this issue, we propose Masked Label Smoothing... | Liang Chen, Runxin Xu, Baobao Chang |  |

However, PLMs may have risks in overfitting the pretraining tasks and data, which usually have gap with the target downstream tasks. Such gap may be difficult for existing PLM finetuning methods to overcome and lead to suboptimal performance.

A property that has been argued for, due to its better utilisation of representation space, is isotropy. In parallel, VAEs have been successful in areas of NLP, but are known for their sub-optimal utilisation of the representation space. To address an aspect of this, we investigate the impact of injecting isotropy during training of VAEs. We achieve this by using an isotropic Gaussian posterior... | Lan Zhang, Wray L.

Metrics leveraging contextualized embeddings appear more flexible than their n-gram matching counterparts and thus ideal as training rewards. However, metrics such as BERTScore greedily align candidate and reference tokens, which can allow system outputs to receive excess credit relative to a reference.

Span-based approaches regard nested NER as a two-stage span enumeration and classification task, thus having the innate ability to handle this task. However, they face the problems of error propagation, ignorance of span boundary, difficulty in long entity recognition and requirement on large-scale annotated data. In this paper, we propose Extract-Select, a span selection framework for nested... | Peixin Huang, Xiang Zhao, Minghao Hu, Yang Fang, Xinyi Li, Weidong Xiao |  |

However, this method neglects the relative importance of documents. We propose a simple approach to reorder the documents according to their relative importance before concatenating and summarizing them.

These methods modify input samples with prompt sentence pieces, and decode label tokens to map samples to corresponding labels. However, such a paradigm is very inefficient for the task of slot tagging. Since slot tagging samples are multiple consecutive words in a sentence, the prompting methods have to enumerate all n-grams token spans to find all the possible slots, which greatly slows down the prediction.

Although a small amount of labeled data cannot be used to train a model, it can be used effectively for the generation of humaninterpretable labeling functions (LFs). These LFs, in turn, have been used to generate a large amount of additional noisy labeled data in a paradigm that is now commonly referred to as data programming.

We point out that commonsense has the nature of domain discrepancy. Namely, commonsense has different data formats and is domain-independent from the downstream task. This nature brings challenges to introducing commonsense in general text understanding tasks. A typical method of introducing textual knowledge is continuing pre-training over the commonsense corpus. However, it will cause catastrophic forgetting to the... | Wanyun Cui, Xingran Chen |  |

In general, automatic speech recognition (ASR) can be accurate enough to accelerate transcription only if trained on large amounts of transcribed data. However, when a single speaker is involved, several studies have reported encouraging results for phonetic transcription even with small amounts of training. Here we expand this body of work on... | Gilles Boulianne |  |

Static embeddings, while less expressive than contextual language models, can be more straightforwardly aligned across multiple languages. We combine the strengths of static and contextual models to improve multilingual representations. We extract static embeddings for 40 languages from XLM-R, validate those embeddings with cross-lingual word retrieval, and then align them using VecMap.

Its main advantage is that it does not rely on a ground truth to generate test cases. However, existing studies are mostly concerned with robustness-like metamorphic relations, limiting the scope of linguistic properties they can test. We propose three new classes of metamorphic relations, which address the properties of systematicity, compositionality and transitivity.

Recent work shows that existing models memorize procedures from context and rely on shallow heuristics to solve MWPs.

We propose 3 language-agnostic methods, one of which achieves promising results on gold standard annotations that we collected for a small number of languages. We then apply this method to 27 languages and analyze the similarities across languages in the grounding of time expressions. | Vered Shwartz |  |

Some previous work has proved that storing a few typical samples of old relations and replaying them when learning new relations can effectively avoid forgetting. However, these memory-based methods tend to overfit the memory samples and perform poorly on imbalanced datasets. To solve these challenges, a consistent representation learning method is proposed,... | Kang Zhao, Hua Xu, Jiangong Yang, Kai Gao |  |

The open-ended nature of these tasks brings new challenges to the neural auto-regressive text generators nowadays. Despite these neural models are good at producing human-like text, it is difficult for them to arrange causalities and relations between given facts and possible ensuing events.

However, these models often suffer from a control strength/fluency trade-off problem as higher control strength is more likely to generate incoherent and repetitive text. In this paper, we illustrate this trade-off is arisen by the controller imposing the target attribute on the LM at improper positions. And we propose a novel framework... | Yuxuan Gu, Xiaocheng Feng, Sicheng Ma, Jiaming Wu, Heng Gong, Bing Qin |  |

However, due to the incessant emergence of new medical intents in the real world, such requirement is not practical. Considering that it is computationally expensive to store and re-train the whole data every time new data and intents come in, we propose to incrementally learn emerged intents while avoiding catastrophically forgetting old intents.

Existing methods mainly rely on the textual similarities between NL and KG to build relation links. Due to the ambiguity of NL and the incompleteness of KG, many relations in NL are implicitly expressed, and may not link to a single relation in KG, which challenges the current methods.

Prevailing methods transfer the knowledge derived from mono-granularity language units (e.g., token-level or sample-level), which is not enough to represent the rich semantics of a text and may lose some vital knowledge. Besides, these methods form the knowledge as individual representations or their simple dependencies, neglecting abundant structural relations among intermediate... | Chang Liu, Chongyang Tao, Jiazhan Feng, Dongyan Zhao |  |

In this paper, we formalize the implicit similarity function induced by this approach, and show that it is susceptible to non-paraphrase pairs sharing a single ambiguous translation. Based on these insights, we design an alternative similarity metric that mitigates this issue by requiring the entire translation distribution to match, and... | Aitor Ormazabal, Mikel Artetxe, Aitor Soroa, Gorka Labaka, Eneko Agirre |  |

For FGET, a key challenge is the low-resource problem — the complex entity type hierarchy makes it difficult to manually label data. Especially for those languages other than English, human-labeled data is extremely scarce. In this paper, we propose a cross-lingual contrastive learning framework to learn FGET models for low-resource... | Xu Han, Yuqi Luo, Weize Chen, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun, Botong Zhou, Fei Hao, Suncong Zheng |  |

A crucial part of writing is editing and revising the text. Previous works on text revision have focused on defining edit intention taxonomies within a single domain or developing computational models with a single level of edit granularity, such as sentence-level edits, which differ from human’s revision cycles.

However, the existing conversational QA systems usually answer users’ questions with a single knowledge source, e.g., paragraphs or a knowledge graph, but overlook the important visual cues, let alone multiple knowledge sources of different modalities. In this paper, we hence define a novel research task, i.e., multimodal conversational question answering (MMCoQA), aiming to... | Yongqi Li, Wenjie Li, Liqiang Nie |  |

We propose Prompt-based Data Augmentation model (PromDA) which only trains small-scale Soft Prompt (i.e., a set of trainable vectors) in the frozen Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs). This avoids human effort in collecting unlabeled in-domain data and maintains the quality of generated synthetic data.

We demonstrate that one of the reasons hindering compositional generalization relates to representations being entangled. We propose an extension to sequence-to-sequence models which encourage disentanglement by adaptively re-encoding (at each time step) the source input.

Over the last few decades, multiple efforts have been undertaken to investigate incorrect translations caused by the polysemous nature of words. Within this body of research, some studies have posited that models pick up semantic biases existing in the training data, thus producing translation errors.

To accelerate this process, researchers propose feature-based model selection (FMS) methods, which assess PTMs’ transferability to a specific task in a fast way without fine-tuning. In this work, we argue that current FMS methods are vulnerable, as the assessment mainly relies on the static features extracted from PTMs. However, such features are derived without... | Biru Zhu, Yujia Qin, Fanchao Qi, Yangdong Deng, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun, Ming Gu |  |

These classic approaches are now often disregarded, for example when new neural models are evaluated. We argue that they should not be overlooked, since, for some tasks, well-designed non-neural approaches achieve better performance than neural ones. In this paper, the task of generating referring expressions in linguistic context is used as an example. We examined two very... | Fahime Same, Guanyi Chen, Kees van Deemter |  |

PAIE: Prompting Argument Interaction for Event Argument Extraction](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2022.acl-long.466) |  | 0 | In this paper, we propose an effective yet efficient model PAIE for both sentence-level and document-level Event Argument Extraction (EAE), which also generalizes well when there is a lack of training data. On the one hand, PAIE utilizes prompt tuning for extractive objectives to take the best advantages of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs). It introduces two span selectors based on the prompt to select start/end tokens among input texts for each role. On the other hand, it captures argument... | Yubo Ma, Zehao Wang, Yixin Cao, Mukai Li, Meiqi Chen, Kun Wang, Jing Shao |  |

Different from the full-sentence MT using the conventional seq-to-seq architecture, SiMT often applies prefix-to-prefix architecture, which forces each target word to only align with a partial source prefix to adapt to the incomplete source in streaming inputs. However, the source words in the front positions are always... | Shaolei Zhang, Yang Feng |  |

We collect non-toxic paraphrases for over 10,000 English toxic sentences. We also show that this pipeline can be used to distill a large existing corpus of paraphrases to get toxic-neutral sentence pairs. We release two parallel corpora which can be used for the training of detoxification models. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first parallel datasets for this task.

However, controlling the generative process for these Transformer-based models is at large an unsolved problem. Earlier work has explored either plug-and-play decoding strategies, or more powerful but blunt approaches such as prompting.

We point out that existing learning-to-route MoE methods suffer from the routing fluctuation issue, i.e., the target expert of the same input may change along with training, but only one expert will be activated for the input during inference. The routing fluctuation tends to harm sample efficiency because the same input updates different experts but only one is finally... | Damai Dai, Li Dong, Shuming Ma, Bo Zheng, Zhifang Sui, Baobao Chang, Furu Wei |  |

As a result, the verb is the primary determinant of the meaning of a clause. In contrast, construction grammarians propose that argument structure is encoded in constructions (or form-meaning pairs) that are distinct from verbs. Two decades of psycholinguistic research have produced substantial empirical evidence in favor of the construction view. Here we adapt several psycholinguistic... | Bai Li, Zining Zhu, Guillaume Thomas, Frank Rudzicz, Yang Xu |  |

This paper explores a deeper relationship between Transformer and numerical ODE methods. We first show that a residual block of layers in Transformer can be described as a higher-order solution to ODE. Inspired by this, we design a new architecture, ODE Transformer, which is analogous to the Runge-Kutta method that is well motivated in ODE. As a natural extension to Transformer, ODE Transformer... | Bei Li, Quan Du, Tao Zhou, Yi Jing, Shuhan Zhou, Xin Zeng, Tong Xiao, Jingbo Zhu, Xuebo Liu, Min Zhang |  |

We focus on scripts as they contain rich verbal and nonverbal messages, and two relevant messages originally conveyed by different modalities during a short time period may serve as arguments of a piece of commonsense... | Kai Sun, Dian Yu, Jianshu Chen, Dong Yu, Claire Cardie |  |

Additionally, the annotation scheme captures a series of persuasiveness scores such as the specificity, strength, evidence, and relevance of the pitch and the individual components. Based on this scheme, we annotated a corpus of 200 business model pitches in German. Moreover, we trained predictive models to detect argumentative discourse structures and... | Thiemo Wambsganss, Christina Niklaus |  |

Given k systems, a naive approach for identifying the top-ranked system would be to uniformly obtain pairwise comparisons from all k \choose 2 pairs of systems. However, this can be very expensive as the number of human annotations required would grow quadratically with k. In this work, we introduce Active Evaluation, a framework to efficiently identify the top-ranked... | Akash Kumar Mohankumar, Mitesh M. Khapra |  |

Utilizing such knowledge can help focus on shared values to bring disagreeing parties towards agreement. In argumentation technology, however, this is barely exploited so far. This paper studies the feasibility of automatically generating morally framed arguments as well as their effect on different audiences. Following the moral foundation theory, we propose a system that... | Milad Alshomary, Roxanne El Baff, Timon Gurcke, Henning Wachsmuth |  |

A recent line of works use various heuristics to successively shorten sequence length while transforming tokens through encoders, in tasks such as classification and ranking that require a single token embedding for prediction. We present a novel solution to this problem, called Pyramid-BERT where we replace previously used... | Xin Huang, Ashish Khetan, Rene Bidart, Zohar Karnin |  |
| 1110 |  |  [Probing for the Usage of Grammatical Number](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2022.acl-long.603) |  | 0 | A central quest of probing is to uncover how pre-trained models encode a linguistic property within their representations. An encoding, however, might be spurious—i.e., the model might not rely on it when making predictions. In this paper, we try to find an encoding that the model actually uses, introducing a usage-based probing setup. We first choose a behavioral task which cannot be solved without using the linguistic property. Then, we attempt to remove the property by intervening on the... | Karim Lasri, Tiago Pimentel, Alessandro Lenci, Thierry Poibeau, Ryan Cotterell |  |
