| 3 |  |  [Can Conformal Prediction Obtain Meaningful Safety Guarantees for ML Models?](https://openreview.net/forum?id=5aO1lsEJGu) |  | 0 | Conformal Prediction (CP) has been recently proposed as a methodology to calibrate the predictions of Machine Learning (ML) models so that they can output rigorous quantification of their uncertainties. For example, one can calibrate the predictions of an ML model into prediction sets, that guarantee to cover the ground truth class with a probability larger than a specified threshold. In this paper, we study whether CP can provide strong statistical guarantees that would be required in safety-critical applications. Our evaluation on the ImageNet demonstrates that using CP over state-of-the-art models fails to deliver the required guarantees. We corroborate our results by deriving a simple connection between the CP prediction sets and top-k accuracy. | Emmanouil Seferis, Simon Burton, ChihHong Cheng |  |
| 4 |  |  [A two-parameter learnable Logmoid Activation Unit](https://openreview.net/forum?id=LcXWYmA8Ek) |  | 0 | A novel learnable Logmoid Activation Unit (LAU) is proposed as, $f(x)=x\ln(1+\alpha\textrm{sigmoid}(\beta x))$, by parameterizing Sigmoid with two hyper-parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ that are optimized by the back-propagation algorithm. The end-to-end deep neural networks with learnable LAUs can increase the predictive performances beyond well-known activation functions for different tasks. | Xuemei Zhou, Lingfang Li, Xingzhou Zheng, Mingxing Luo |  |
| 5 |  |  [Cross Domain Vulnerability Detection using Graph Contrastive Learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=rrZtzI7xj2b) |  | 0 | To overcome the difficulty of finding good-quality labeled data in domains such as vulnerability detection, Self--Supervised Learning (SSL) methods such as Contrastive Learning (CL) algorithms were developed. We evaluate the performance of one such state-of-the-art CL method, GraphCL, that trains on our graph dataset generated from code repositories of six widely used C/C++ applications. We also propose a custom graph type having a new structure that combines both code-level and binary-level CPG graphs. This is because, even though existing graph types such as AST, CFG and CPG are effective in detecting vulnerabilities in the source code, it is ineffective in detecting the ones that only occur in the binary-level. Hence, to detect those vulnerabilities, we propose a new graph type, Cross Domain Control Property Graph (CDCPG). We perform extensive experiments, using different augmentation techniques and loss functions to show that our custom graph type, CDCPG, performs better than other graph types in many scenarios. | Mahmoud Zamani, Saquib Irtiza, Shamila Wickramasuriya, Latifur Khan, Kevin W.

| 7 |  |  [Training Data Eigenvector Dynamics in the EigenPro Implementation of the Neural Tangent Kernel and Recursive Feature Machines](https://openreview.net/forum?id=8WiNDyXgj6) |  | 0 | There has been much recent work on kernel methods as a viable alternative to deep neural networks (DNNs). The advent of the $\textit{Neural Tangent Kernel}$ (NTK) has brought on renewed interest in these methods and their application to typical deep learning tasks. Recently, kernels have been shown to be capable of feature learning similar to that of DNNs, termed $\textit{Recursive Feature Machines}$ (RFMs). In accordance with the growing scale of kernel models, the EigenPro 3 algorithm was proposed to facilitate large-scale training based on preconditioned gradient descent. We propose an accessible framework for observing the eigenvector dynamics of EigenPro's training data in its implementation of these kernel methods, and find empirically that significant change ceases early in training along with apparent bias towards equilibrium. In the case of RFMs, we find that significant change in the training data eigenvectors typically curtails before five iterations, in accordance with findings that RFMs achieve optimal performance in five iterations. This represents a path forward in gaining intuition for the inner workings of large-scale kernel training methods. We provide an easy to use Python implementation of our framework at https://github.com/cgorlla/ep3dynamics. | Cyril Gorlla |  |

Therefore, state-of-the-art methods for perception in urban scenes fuse data from both sensor types. In this work, we introduce a novel self-supervised method to fuse LiDAR and camera data for self-driving applications. We build upon masked autoencoders (MAEs) and train deep learning models to reconstruct masked LiDAR data from fused LiDAR and camera features. In contrast to related methods that use birds-eye-view representations, we fuse features from dense spherical LiDAR projections and features from fish-eye camera crops with a similar field of view. Therefore, we reduce the learned spatial transformations to moderate perspective transformations and do not require additional modules to generate dense LiDAR representations.

However, learning representations for EEG-based motor imagery classification is challenging due to inter-subject variability and differences in mental imagery, resulting in poor generalization of deep learning models to new subjects. While pre-trained deep learning models achieve high accuracy on subjects with similar domains, they fail on subjects with dissimilar domains. Optimization-based meta-learning algorithms can address this limitation by learning a good initialization for the model, enabling quick adaptation to new subjects with limited fine-tuning examples. We demonstrate that our Meta Learning approach consistently outperforms Transfer Learning on the BCI Competition IV 2a dataset. Although accuracy varies depending on domain similarity, meta-learning demonstrates efficient adaption to unseen subjects with limited data. By improving generalization across subjects with different domains under low-data environments, we can enhance the reliability and practicality of brain-computer interfaces for real-world applications. | Arnav Pati, Deepak Mewada, Debasis Samanta |  |
| 11 |  |  [Fostering Effective Communication Between Humans and Machines](https://openreview.net/forum?id=AHnLJBD7xKx) |  | 0 | With the growing usage of smartphones, digital communication has become significant. This paper describes the primary research conducted to study user interaction patterns on smartphones. Results show that the time between two touches, or the editorial context duration, is just 5 to 10 seconds for a vast majority of smartphone interactions. So, the paper introduces the novel concept of MicroStimuli, which can generate a response in mere milliseconds, specifically tailored for smartphones. The construct of MicroStimuli is formulated by leveraging the neuroscience of decision-making in response to visual stimuli. | Karthika Kamath, Tanya Upadhyay, Jieya Rawal, Kirtana Sunil Phatnani, Biju Dominic |  |

| 13 |  |  [Symbolic Regression in Financial Economics](https://openreview.net/forum?id=RuCQRXk7a7G) |  | 0 | We apply symbolic regression, the machine learning approach of recovering models from data, in financial economics. Specifically, we present a data set consisting of equations that cover a broad range of topics in financial economics. These equations are built off a common set of mathematical symbols but importantly have new variations in functional forms. We test the joint performance of deep learning and genetic programming symbolic regression systems in recovering these non-physical equations. | Jiacheng Liu, Siqi Guo |  |
| 14 |  |  [FRESCO: Federated Reinforcement Energy System for Cooperative Optimization](https://openreview.net/forum?id=75mWq5j4iso) |  | 0 | The rise in renewable energy is creating new dynamics in the energy grid that promise to create a cleaner and more participative energy grid, where technology plays a crucial part in creating the required flexibility to achieve the vision of the next-generation grid. This work presents FRESCO, a framework that aims to ease the implementation of energy markets using a hierarchical control architecture of reinforcement learning agents trained using federated learning. The core concept we are proving is that having greedy agents subject to changing conditions from a higher level agent creates a cooperative setup that will allow for fulfilling all the individual objectives. This paper presents a general overview of the framework, the current progress, and some insights we obtained from the recent results. | Nicolas M.

| 15 |  |  [Learning Rotation-Agnostic Representations via Group Equivariant VAEs](https://openreview.net/forum?id=jbNqgEJf0EI) |  | 0 | An emerging field in representation learning involves the study of group-equivariant neural networks, that leverage concepts from group representation theory to design neural architectures that can exploit discrete and continuous symmetries to produce more general representations. Following this direction, in this work we demonstrate how an image embedding agnostic to rotations can be naturally obtained by training a variational autoencoder (S-GVAE) equipped with a Group equivariant Convolutional Neural Network (G-CNN) encoder. | Ahmedeo Shokry, Antonio Norelli |  |

| 17 |  |  [Whispering Across the Continent: Collecting and Analyzing African Culture Using Community Radios](https://openreview.net/forum?id=kidk_E11QQ) |  | 0 | African culture is rich and diverse, but much of its knowledge is held by the elders of the community and passed down through oral traditions. With globalization, young Africans are becoming increasingly disconnected from their roots, making it essential to collect and preserve this knowledge. However, the lack of accessible data on African culture presents a significant challenge. This research aims to address this problem by exploring new ways to collect and preserve African cultural data. Specifically, we have developed a device to perform continuous recording of cultural radio programs in local languages, which has enabled us to collect over 1500 hours of audio data. We are also exploring the use of a whisper model, which has proven to be effective in outperforming human transcription and being multilingual. This research project's final goal is to build a language model that understands African culture, providing an effective approach to store this knowledge for future generations to learn about their culture. | Joseph Domguia, Guy Adingono Nkama |  |

We use DistilBERT as the victim model due to its smaller size and faster processing speed. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the model extraction attack and show that fine-tuning more powerful language models can improve accuracy. The study provides important insights into the security of machine learning models. | Amro Salman, Ayman Saeed, Khalid N. Elmadani, Sharief Babiker |  |

| 21 |  |  [Insights into the mechanism behind reusing Teacher's classifier in Knowledge Distillation](https://openreview.net/forum?id=_cL7Uj4LXAJ) |  | 0 | Knowledge distillation (KD) has emerged as an effective approach to compress deep neural networks by transferring knowledge from a powerful yet cumbersome teacher model to a lightweight student model. Recent research has suggested that re-using the teacher's final layer (i.e., the classifier) can be a straightforward and effective method for knowledge distillation. The underlying mechanism for this method's success remains unclear. Our study aims to shed light on how the knowledge distillation loss affects the alignment between the weights of the student classifier and the teacher classifier. Specifically, we compare the $L^2$ norm of the difference between the weights of the student and the teacher classifier during the training process. Our experiments demonstrate that the knowledge distillation loss encourages alignment between the student and teacher classifiers, as indicated by a strong positive correlation ($>0.97$) between the $L^2$ norm and the loss during training. We also observe that as temperature increases, this alignment decreases and the $L^2$ norm behaves similar to normal (non-KD) training. Our analysis aims to provide to a better understanding of knowledge distillation provide a starting point for the development of new KD frameworks. | Kinshuk Dua |  |

In this paper, we introduce a modality conversion concept aimed at enhancing emotion recognition performance on the MELD dataset. We assess our approach through two experiments: first, a method named Modality-Conversion that employs automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, followed by a text classifier; second, we assume perfect ASR output and investigate the impact of modality conversion on SER, this method is called Modality-Conversion++. Our findings indicate that the first method yields substantial results, while the second method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) speech-based approaches in terms of SER weighted-F1 (WF1) score on the MELD dataset. This research highlights the potential of modality conversion for tasks that can be conducted in alternative modalities. | Zeinab Sadat Taghavi, Ali Satvaty, Hossein Sameti |  |
| 24 |  |  [Fairness Under Partial Observability](https://openreview.net/forum?id=if1Mmrxf-pq) |  | 0 | The purpose of this article is to discuss an important challenge faced in \`\`real life'' when trying to implement \emph{group} fairness-aware models and algorithms. Here, we focus specifically on the role that uncertainty and ambiguity play and revisit the case where protected attributes are only partially observable. | Islam Utyagulov, Francois BuetGolfouse, Peter Hill |  |
| 25 |  |  [Geodesic Mode Connectivity](https://openreview.net/forum?id=cFtt9fU7YB6) |  | 0 | Mode connectivity is a phenomenon where trained models are connected by a path of low loss. We reframe this in the context of Information Geometry, where neural networks are studied as spaces of parameterized distributions with curved geometry. We hypothesize that shortest paths in these spaces, known as geodesics, correspond to mode-connecting paths in the loss landscape. We propose an algorithm to approximate geodesics and demonstrate that they achieve mode connectivity. | Charlie Tan, Theodore Long, Sarah Zhao, Rudolf Laine |  |
| 26 |  |  [Pursuit Policies in Dynamic Environments](https://openreview.net/forum?id=_cZLvP7LAt7) |  | 0 | Cooperative pursuit is a popular multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) game where a team of predators target prey while avoiding obstacles. Previous literature has largely considered the impact of different predator, prey abilities on learning. Here, we investigate the impact of dynamic environments on learning predator pursuit policies from partial observations with deep Q-learning. Interestingly, we find predators are able to learn cooperative pursuit strategies that leverage moving obstacles. | Joseph L. Briones, Andréa W. Richa |  |

| 28 |  |  [Recursive Reasoning with Neural Networks](https://openreview.net/forum?id=TS8l4VS7_BK) |  | 0 | Many problems can naturally be thought about recursively. However, neural networks fundamentally cannot reason this way on arbitrarily large problems. This is because they do not have the memory to maintain state for the maximum recursion depth required. Solving this issue would enable neural networks to reason like a wide range of classical recursive algorithms (e.g., tree search in model-based RL). To address this, we propose a neural architecture augmented with a stack that learns to save and recall state as needed. We empirically demonstrate the utility of this method on a recursive neural algorithmic reasoning task (learning depth-first search) and show that our architecture leads to improved generalization. | Jonas Jürß, Dulhan Hansaja Jayalath |  |

| 30 |  |  [Reducing the Effect of Incomplete Annotations in Object Detection for Histopathology](https://openreview.net/forum?id=PIfJnq9kpdw) |  | 0 | Training neural networks for object detection usually requires decent amounts of data to produce great results. Apart from the image variety, the number of annotated objects is a crucial factor for success. In histopathology, the average annotation density is very high, resulting in resource-consuming data preparation for neural network training. We explore the effect of incomplete annotations in object detection. We show that modern object detectors, such as YOLO-v5, can effectively learn from histopathology datasets that lack up to 90% of annotations. Additionally, we suggest an easy model tuning setup to reduce the impact of incomplete annotations and enhance learning capability overall. We publish our code at https://github.com/DenysKaliuzhnyi/yolov5. | Denys Kaliuzhnyi, Dmytro Fishman, Mikhail Papkov |  |

Using the ADReSSo dataset, this paper reports enhanced performance in classification models and comparable performance in regression models to the baseline, achieving a significant improvement of up to 82\% accuracy on the test dataset. In contrast, the test RMSE has a marginal difference of only 0.28 compared to the baseline. | Ujjawal Shah, Saurav Keshari Aryal |  |
