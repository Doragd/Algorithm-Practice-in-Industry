| 2 |  |  [Chemical Language Models Have Problems with Chemistry: A Case Study on Molecule Captioning Task](https://openreview.net/forum?id=JoO6mtCLHD) |  | 0 | Drug discovery has been greatly enhanced through the recent fusion of molecular sciences and natural language processing, leading these research fields to significant advancements. Considering the crucial role of molecule representation in chemical understanding within these models, we introduce novel probing tests designed to evaluate chemical knowledge of molecular structure in state-of-the-art language models (LMs), specifically MolT5 and Text+Chem T5. These probing tests are conducted on a molecule captioning task to gather evidence and insights into the language models' comprehension of chemical information. By applying rules to transform molecular SMILES into equivalent variants, we have observed significant differences in the natural language descriptions generated by the LM for a given molecule depending on the exact transformation used. | Veronika Ganeeva, Kuzma Khrabrov, Artur Kadurin, Andrey V.

This paper introduces a fairness-aware approach for offline RMABs. We propose a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based fairness metric to quantify the discrepancy between the selected and the overall population. This is incorporated as a regularizer into the soft whittle index optimization. We evaluate our fairness-aware algorithm on a real-world RMAB dataset where initial results suggest that our approach can potentially improve fairness while preserving solution quality. | Gargi Singh, Milind Tambe, Aparna Taneja |  |
| 4 |  |  [Utilizing Cross-Version Consistency for Domain Adaptation: A Case Study on Music Audio](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ZNg3YQQKWT) |  | 0 | Deep learning models are commonly trained on large annotated corpora, often in a specific domain. Generalization to another domain without annotated data is usually challenging. In this paper, we address such unsupervised domain adaptation based on the teacher--student learning paradigm. For improved efficacy in the target domain, we propose to exploit cross-version scenarios, i.e., corresponding data pairs assumed to obtain the same yet unknown labels. More specifically, our idea is to compare teacher annotations across versions and use only consistent annotations as labels to train the student model. Examples of cross-version data include the same text by different speakers (in speech recognition) or the same character by different writers (in handwritten text recognition). In our case study on music audio, versions are different recorded performances of the same composition, aligned with music synchronization techniques. Taking pitch estimation (a multi-label classification task) as an example task, we show that enforcing consistency across versions in student training helps to improve the transfer from a source domain (piano) to unseen and more complex target domains (singing/orchestra). | Lele Liu, Christof Weiss |  |
| 5 |  |  [Aligners: Decoupling LLMs and Alignment](https://openreview.net/forum?id=E6WukV41He) |  | 0 | Large Language Models (LLMs) need to be aligned with human expectations to ensure their safety and utility in most applications. Alignment is challenging, costly, and needs to be repeated for every LLM and alignment criterion. We propose to decouple LLMs and alignment by training aligner models that can be used to align any LLM for a given criteria on an as-needed basis, thus also reducing the potential negative impacts of alignment on performance. Our recipe for training the aligner models solely relies on synthetic data generated with a (prompted) LLM and can be easily adjusted for a variety of alignment criteria. We illustrate our method by training an \`\`ethical'' aligner and verify its efficacy empirically. | Lilian Ngweta, Mayank Agarwal, Subha Maity, Alex Gittens, Yuekai Sun, Mikhail Yurochkin |  |
| 6 |  |  [When is RL better than DPO in RLHF? A Representation and Optimization Perspective](https://openreview.net/forum?id=lNEFatlsQb) |  | 0 | Aligning large language models with human preferences is important, and there are two kinds of alignment methods. The first class of algorithms is based on reinforcement learning (RL), which involves learning a reward function from a human preference dataset and improving performance via online reward maximization. Another class is characterized by direct preference optimization, exemplified by DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023), which learns an implicit reward and improves performance directly using a static offline dataset. Which algorithm performs well? We investigate this question using contextual bandits, which serve as mathematical models for alignment. We have two findings: First, we show that DPO may suffer from a reward quality issue when the feature representation is misspecified. Second, we present the error bounds for RL algorithms and show that they achieve the best improvement when the online updates are sufficient. The code to reproduce our results is available at https://github.com/liziniu/policy_optimization. | Ziniu Li, Tian Xu, Yang Yu |  |
| 7 |  |  [Is Watermarking LLM-Generated Code Robust?](https://openreview.net/forum?id=8PhI1PzSYY) |  | 0 | We present the first study of the robustness of existing watermarking techniques on Python code generated by large language models. Although existing works showed that watermarking can be robust for natural language text, we show that it is easy to remove these watermarks on code by simple semantic-preserving transformations. | Tarun Suresh, Shubham Ugare, Gagandeep Singh, Sasa Misailovic |  |
| 8 |  |  [Lost in Translation: GANs' Inability to Generate Simple Probability Distributions](https://openreview.net/forum?id=MUOmyZMEd4) |  | 0 | Since its inception, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have marked a triumph in generative modeling. Its impeccable capacity to mimic observations from unknown probability distributions has positioned it as a widely used simulation tool. In typical applications, GANs find themselves simulating data rich in semantic information such as images or text out of random noise. As such, it is reasonable to expect that large parametric models such as GANs must be able to estimate standard theoretical probability densities with ease. In this paper, based on a series of disillusioning experimental findings, we show that GANs often fail to induce the simplest of statistical transformations between distributions. For example, starting with a standard Gaussian noise, GANs with 2-deep generators are unable to perform a positional translation. Supporting theoretical tests on generated data further corroborates our rather unsettling conclusions. | Debanjan Dutta, Anish Chakrabarty, Swagatam Das |  |
| 9 |  |  [CMFPN: Context Modeling Meets Feature Pyramid Network](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Qtu2Od1ggw) |  | 0 | Feature fusion is a powerful technique that enables predictors to access a semantically rich representation of an image. Feature Pyramid Networks (FPNs) are the most widely used models for fusing features. However, the context within the FPN layers is inconsistent, leading to false predictions. This article addresses the context inconsistency in FPN and proposes CMFPN, a new design that improves feature fusion by decoupling feature aggregation from context modeling. Experimental results, based on the COCO dataset, show that CMFPN effectively resolves the context issues and enhances the Average Precision (AP) results for both object detection and instance segmentation by $2.30\%$ and $1.7\%$, respectively. | Faroq AlTam, Muhammad AlQurishi, Thariq Khalid Kadavil, Riad Souissi |  |
| 10 |  |  [Enhancing Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction with Context-Aware Architecture](https://openreview.net/forum?id=e2Bkf1Bzh4) |  | 0 | In the field of disease treatment, the simultaneous use of multiple medications can lead to unforeseen adverse reactions, compromising patient safety and therapeutic efficacy. Consequently, predicting drug-drug interactions (DDIs) has emerged as a pivotal research focus on improving disease treatment. While recent advancements have been made in deep learning models for predicting drug pair relations, the nuanced consideration of individual or cellular conditions as influential contextual factors in DDIs is notably lacking. In this study, leveraging existing models, we introduce a methodology to predict DDIs through a context-aware architecture. The evident performance improvement compared to established methodologies underscores the crucial role of the context-aware mechanism in addressing context-conditional DDIs. Furthermore, we perform a systematic ablation analysis to assess the impact of model elements. Simultaneously, we also investigate the potential of incorporating pre-trained molecular representation learning models in this domain. | Yijingxiu Lu, Yinhua Piao, Sun Kim |  |
| 11 |  |  [Can LLMs Learn a New Language on the Fly? A Case Study on Zhuang](https://openreview.net/forum?id=GTHD2UnDIb) |  | 0 | Existing large language models still fail to support many low-resource languages. Especially for the extremely low-resource ones, there is hardly any training data to effectively update the model parameters. We thus investigate whether LLMs can learn a new language on the fly through in-context learning prompting. To study this question, we collect a tiny parallel corpus for Zhuang, a language supported by no LLMs currently. We study the performance of various LLMs on the Zhuang-Chinese translation task and find out the great potential of this learning paradigm. | Chen Zhang, Mingxu Tao, Quzhe Huang, Zhibin Chen, Yansong Feng |  |
| 12 |  |  [Weighted Branch Aggregation Based Deep Learning Model for Track Detection in Autonomous Racing](https://openreview.net/forum?id=K3ilD3QhX6) |  | 0 | Intelligent track detection is a vital component of autonomous racing cars. We develop a novel Weighted Branch Aggregation based Convolutional Neural Network (WeBACNN) model that can accurately detect the track while being robust against image blurring due to high speed, and can work independently of lane markings. The code and dataset for this work is available at (anonymous). | Shreya Ghosh, YiHuan Chen, ChingHsiang Huang, Abu Shafin Mohammad Mahdee Jameel, Aly El Gamal, Samuel Labi |  |
| 13 |  |  [Visual prompting Methods for GPT-4V based Zero-Shot Graphic Layout Design Generation](https://openreview.net/forum?id=DI4gETm7aa) |  | 0 | Graphic layout design generation is a challenging problem in computer vision. The key aspect of the challenge is ensuring coherent placement of textual elements on the background image to ensure aesthetic appeal and avoiding occlusion of key visual elements. Although prior methods have made attempts to solve this multi-modal problem, they couldn't perfect it. Owing to the complexity required in understanding the relationship between visual and text elements in the aforementioned task, we investigate GPT-4-Vision(GPT-4V), a large multimodal models(LMMs), to do zero-shot graphic layout design generation in a versatile manner. Our approach explores various off-the-shelf segmentation/superpixel methods to identify and mark the key regions to visually augment the image to enhance GPT-4V's spatial reasoning capability . The results of our comprehensive experiments on a self-curated dataset demonstrates the efficacy of our proposed visual prompting methods, showing improvement over standard GPT-4V prompting method and also performing at par and even better, for some techniques, than state-of-the-art specialist model.The code and data is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/VISUAL-PROMPTING-TECHNIQUES-FOR-GPT-4V-BASED-ZERO-SHOT-GRAPHIC-LAYOUT-DESIGN-GENERATION-5A6E | Kunal Singh, Mukund Khanna, Ankan Biswas, Pradeep Moturi, Shivam |  |
| 14 |  |  [Exploring the Limits of Semantic Image Compression at Micro-bits per Pixel](https://openreview.net/forum?id=sfwtoH5GdD) |  | 0 | Traditional methods, such as JPEG, perform image compression by operating on structural information, such as pixel values or frequency content. These methods are effective to bitrates around one bit per pixel (bpp) and higher at standard image sizes. However, to compress further text-based semantic compression directly stores concepts and their relationships using natural language, which has evolved with humans to efficiently represent these salient concepts. These methods can operate at extremely low bitrates by disregarding structural information like location, size, and orientation. In this work, we use GPT-4V and DALL-E3 from OpenAI to explore the quality-compression frontier for image compression and identify the limitations with current technology. We push semantic compression as low as 100 μbpp (up to 10,000× smaller than JPEG) by introducing an iterative reflection process to improve the decoded image. We further hypothesize this 100 μbpp level represents a soft limit on semantic compression at standard image resolutions. | Jordan Dotzel, Bahaa Kotb, James Dotzel, Mohamed S. Abdelfattah, Zhiru Zhang |  |
| 15 |  |  [Evaluating Groups of Features via Consistency, Contiguity, and Stability](https://openreview.net/forum?id=IP2etbIEuC) |  | 0 | Feature attributions explain model predictions by assigning importance scores to input features. In high-dimensional data such as images, these scores are often assigned to groups of features. There are various strategies for creating these groups, ranging from simple patches to deep-learning-based algorithms. Which group should be used for explanation? We formally define three key criteria for interpretable groups of features: consistency, contiguity, and stability. We find that patch-based groups outperform groups created via modern segmentation tools. | Chaehyeon Kim, Weiqiu You, Shreya Havaldar, Eric Wong |  |
| 16 |  |  [What Does a Visual Formal Analysis of the World's 500 Most Famous Paintings Tell Us About Multimodal LLMs?](https://openreview.net/forum?id=dINMwL186O) |  | 0 | This work introduces ArtQA, a new benchmark for multimodal LLMs through the lens of formal analysis of paintings. We focus on key elements such as line, shape, space, color, form, value, and texture—collectively referred to as the elements of art in visual formal analysis. ArtQA contains questions spanning 4 metrics, further divided into 16 fine-grained categories. We leverage the power of LLMs to generate VQA questions based on formal analysis of 500 renowned paintings. These questions undergo a rigorous filtering process by both model annotation and human experts, ensuring ArtQA's quality and reliability. | Muzi Tao, Saining Xie |  |
| 17 |  |  [Revamp: Automated Simulations of Adversarial Attacks on Arbitrary Objects in Realistic Scenes](https://openreview.net/forum?id=XCLrySEUBe) |  | 0 | Deep learning models, such as those used in autonomous vehicles are vulnerable to adversarial attacks where attackers could place adversarial objects in the environment to induce incorrect detections. While generating such adversarial objects in the digital realm is well-studied, successfully transferring these attacks to the physical realm remains challenging, especially when accounting for real-world environmental factors. We address these challenges with REVAMP, a first-of-its-kind Python library for creating attack scenarios with arbitrary objects in scenes with realistic environmental factors, lighting, reflection, and refraction. REVAMP empowers researchers and practitioners to swiftly explore diverse scenarios, offering a wide range of configurable options for experiment design and using differentiable rendering to replicate physically-plausible adversarial objects. REVAMP is open-source and available at https://github.com/poloclub/revamp and a demo video is available at https://youtu.be/NA0XR0XkS1E. | Matthew Hull, Zijie J. Wang, Duen Horng Chau |  |
| 18 |  |  [Hard ASH: Sparsity and the right optimizer make a continual learner](https://openreview.net/forum?id=WwQKl1OrMX) |  | 0 | In class incremental learning, neural networks typically suffer from catastrophic forgetting. We show that an MLP featuring a sparse activation function and an adaptive learning rate optimizer can compete with established regularization techniques in the Split-MNIST task. We highlight the effectiveness of the Adaptive SwisH (ASH) activation function in this context and introduce a novel variant, Hard Adaptive SwisH (Hard ASH) to further enhance the learning retention. | Santtu Keskinen |  |
| 19 |  |  [Analog In-Memory Computing with Uncertainty Quantification for Efficient Edge-based Medical Imaging Segmentation](https://openreview.net/forum?id=hvp5I4dDya) |  | 0 | This work investigates the role of the emerging Analog In-memory computing (AIMC) paradigm in enabling Medical AI analysis and improving the certainty of these models at the edge. It contrasts AIMC's efficiency with traditional digital computing's limitations in power, speed, and scalability. Our comprehensive evaluation focuses on brain tumor analysis, spleen segmentation, and nuclei detection. The study highlights the superior robustness of isotropic architectures, which exhibit a minimal accuracy drop (0.04) in analog-aware training, compared to significant drops (up to 0.15) in pyramidal structures. Additionally, the paper emphasizes IMC's effective data pipelining, reducing latency and increasing throughput as well as the exploitation of inherent noise within AIMC, strategically harnessed to augment model certainty. | Imane Hamzaoui, Hadjer Benmeziane, Zayneb Cherif, Kaoutar El Maghraoui |  |
| 20 |  |  [VoltaVision: A Transfer Learning model for electronic component classification](https://openreview.net/forum?id=JHTqFvmVYz) |  | 0 | In this paper, we analyze the effectiveness of transfer learning on classifying electronic components. Transfer learning reuses pre-trained models to save time and resources in building a robust classifier rather than learning from scratch. Our work introduces a lightweight CNN, coined as VoltaVision, and compares its performance against more complex models. We test the hypothesis that transferring knowledge from a similar task to our target domain yields better results than state-of-the-art models trained on general datasets. Our dataset and code for this work are available at https://github.com/AnasIshfaque/VoltaVision. | Anas Mohammad Ishfaqul Muktadir Osmani, Taimur Rahman, Salekul Islam |  |
| 21 |  |  [Training Mixture-of-Experts: A Focus on Expert-Token Matching](https://openreview.net/forum?id=UJgSQjBWZS) |  | 0 | Recent advancements in sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, particularly in the Vision MoE (VMoE) framework, have demonstrated promising results in enhancing vision task performance. However, a key challenge persists in optimally routing tokens (such as image patches) to the right experts, without incurring excessive computational costs. Addressing this, we apply the regularized optimal transport, which relies on the Sinkhorn algorithm to the Vision MoE (VMoE) framework, aiming at improving the token-expert matching process. The resulting model, Sinkhorn-VMoE (SVMoE), represents a meaningful step in optimizing efficiency and effectiveness of sparsely-gated MoE models. | Fateme Vesaghati, Masoumeh Zareapoor |  |
| 22 |  |  [Learning Disentangled Audio Representations through Controlled Synthesis](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Fn9ORH8PLl) |  | 0 | This paper tackles the scarcity of benchmarking data in disentangled auditory representation learning. We introduce \*\*SynTone\*\*, a synthetic dataset with explicit ground truth explanatory factors for evaluating disentanglement techniques. Benchmarking state-of-the-art methods on SynTone highlights its utility for method evaluation. Our results underscore strengths and limitations in audio disentanglement, motivating future research. | Yusuf Brima, Ulf Krumnack, Simone Pika, Gunther Heidemann |  |
| 23 |  |  [Collapse of Self-trained Language Models](https://openreview.net/forum?id=DeuBfEWyR4) |  | 0 | In various fields of knowledge creation, including science, new ideas often build on pre-existing information. In this work, we explore this concept within the context of language models. Specifically, we explore the potential of self-training models on their own outputs, akin to how humans learn and build on their previous thoughts and actions. While this approach is intuitively appealing, our research reveals its practical limitations. We find that extended self-training of the GPT-2 model leads to a significant degradation in performance, resulting in repetitive and collapsed token output. | David Herel, Tomás Mikolov |  |
| 24 |  |  [KFC: Knowledge Reconstruction and Feedback Consolidation Enable Efficient and Effective Continual Generative Learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=pVTcR8ig3R) |  | 0 | To address the issues of catastrophic forgetting in Continual Generative Learning (CGL), dominant methods leverage the generative replay strategy. However, they often suffer from high time complexity and inferior generative sample quality. In this work, we develop an efficient and effective CGL method via \*K\*nowledge reconstruction and \*F\*eedback \*C\*onsolidation (\*KFC\*). KFC extends the inherent data reconstruction properties of the variational autoencoder framework to historical knowledge reconstruction and re-encodes the current task's reconstructed data to the same posterior distribution as the original data. Experiments showcase that KFC achieves state-of-the-art performances in time complexity, sample quality, and accuracy on various CGL tasks. Code is in github.com/libo-huang/KFC. | Libo Huang, Zhulin An, Yan Zeng, Xiang Zhi, Yongjun Xu |  |
| 25 |  |  [Rescaling Intermediate Features Makes Trained Consistency Models Perform Better](https://openreview.net/forum?id=1o3LnwflAl) |  | 0 | In the domain of deep generative models, diffusion models are renowned for their high-quality image generation but are constrained by intensive computational demands. To mitigate this, consistency models have been proposed as a computationally efficient alternative. Our research reveals that post-training rescaling of internal features can enhance the one-step sample quality of these models without incurring detectable computational overhead. This optimization is evidenced by an obvious improvement in Fr&eacute;chet Inception Distance (FID). For example, with our rescaled consistency distillation (CD) model, FID on the ImageNet dataset reduces from 6.2 to 5.2, on the LSUN-cat dataset from 10.9 to 9.5. Closer inspection of the generated images reveals that this enhancement may originate from improved visual details and clarity. | Junyi Zhu, Zinan Lin, Enshu Liu, Xuefei Ning, Matthew B. Blaschko |  |
| 26 |  |  [DFWLayer: Differentiable Frank-Wolfe Optimization Layer](https://openreview.net/forum?id=XoPQqUctS1) |  | 0 | Differentiable optimization has received a significant amount of attention due to its foundational role in the domain of machine learning based on neural networks. This paper proposes a differentiable layer, named Differentiable Frank-Wolfe Layer (DFWLayer), by rolling out the Frank-Wolfe method, a well-known optimization algorithm which can solve constrained optimization problems without projections and Hessian matrix computations, thus leading to an efficient way of dealing with large-scale convex optimization problems with norm constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that the DFWLayer not only attains competitive accuracy in solutions and gradients but also consistently adheres to constraints. | Zixuan Liu, Liu Liu, Xueqian Wang, Peilin Zhao |  |
| 27 |  |  [3D Shape Completion via Sparse Irregular Representation](https://openreview.net/forum?id=mBQYpnq3Pj) |  | 0 | The task of 3D shape completion involves completing missing regions of an object from partial observation. The current methods accomplish this task by modeling latent completion distributions based on an autoregressive model. However, this approach often struggles with geometric details, as it represents 3D shapes with variable latent sequences, leading to gaps (local missing) in the completed shape. In this paper, we introduce a multiple 3D shape completion method using a transformer-based autoregressive model and a fixed-length sparse irregular latent sequence. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both quality and fidelity. | Jiahui Li, Pourya Shamsolmoali |  |
| 28 |  |  [Dissecting Zero-Shot Visual Reasoning Capabilities in Vision and Language Models](https://openreview.net/forum?id=jM1nZDBIto) |  | 0 | Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown impressive zero- and few-shot performance on real-world visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks, alluding to their capabilities as visual reasoning engines. However, existing works (typically) use benchmarks that conflate “pure” visual reasoning with world knowledge, and also have questions that involve a limited number of reasoning steps. Thus, it remains unclear whether a VLM’s apparent visual reasoning performance is due to its world knowledge, or due to actual visual reasoning capabilities. To clarify this ambiguity, we systematically benchmark and dissect the zero-shot visual reasoning capabilities of VLMs through synthetic datasets that require minimal world knowledge, and allow for analysis over a broad range of reasoning steps. We specifically focus on evaluating the impact of conveying scene information as either visual embeddings or purely textual scene descriptions to the underlying large language model (LLM) of the VLM. We notably find that the underlying LLMs, when provided textual scene descriptions, consistently perform significantly better compared to being provided visual embeddings. Our work comprehensively identifies limitations of VLMs for compositional visual reasoning, and highlights the important role that LLMs can play in scene understanding and visual reasoning. | Aishik Nagar, Shantanu Jaiswal, Cheston Tan |  |
| 29 |  |  [MosquitoFusion: A Multiclass Dataset for Real-Time Detection of Mosquitoes, Swarms, and Breeding Sites Using Deep Learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=3s4hFx8pYs) |  | 0 | In this paper, we present an integrated approach to real-time mosquito detection using our multiclass dataset (MosquitoFusion) containing 1204 diverse images and leverage cutting-edge technologies, specifically computer vision, to automate the identification of Mosquitoes, Swarms, and Breeding Sites. The pre-trained YOLOv8 model, trained on this dataset, achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP@50) of 57.1%, with precision at 73.4% and recall at 50.5%. The integration of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) further enriches the depth of our analysis, providing valuable insights into spatial patterns. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/faiyazabdullah/MosquitoFusion. | Md. Faiyaz Abdullah Sayeedi, Fahim Hafiz, Md Ashiqur Rahman |  |
| 30 |  |  [Nonlinear model reduction for operator learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Jw6TUpB7Rw) |  | 0 | Operator learning provides methods to approximate mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces. Deep operator networks (DeepONets) are a notable architecture in this field. Recently, an extension of DeepONet based on model reduction and neural networks, proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)-DeepONet, has been able to outperform other architectures in terms of accuracy for several benchmark tests. We extend this idea towards nonlinear model order reduction by proposing an efficient framework that combines neural networks with kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) for operator learning. Our results demonstrate the superior performance of KPCA-DeepONet over POD-DeepONet. | Hamidreza Eivazi, Stefan H. A. Wittek, Andreas Rausch |  |
| 31 |  |  [Logic-guided Deep Reinforcement Learning for Stock Trading](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SPDNi5Ys8R) |  | 0 | Previous state-of-the-art trading strategy proposes using ensemble reinforcement learning to combine the advantages of different subpolicies. Despite its improved performance, we observe that this policy is still quite sensitive to market volatility. In this work, we propose a novel framework called SYENS (Program Synthesis-based Ensemble Strategy) which aims to improve the trading strategy's robustness via the program synthesis by sketching paradigm. SYENS is a hierarchical strategy that uses a program sketch as the high-level strategy. The program sketch embeds human expert knowledge of market trends. And based on the program sketch, we adopt the program synthesis by sketching paradigm to synthesize the detailed ensemble strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that SYENS achieves the highest return while retaining low drawdown. | Zhiming Li, Junzhe Jiang, Yushi Cao, Aixin Cui, Bozhi Wu, Bo Li, Yang Liu |  |
| 32 |  |  [A Shared Encoder for Multi-Source Hyperspectral Images](https://openreview.net/forum?id=dIThDxLwA1) |  | 0 | Multi-source hyperspectral images(HSIs) which captured from diverse sensors commonly possess varying bands. When employing deep learning techniques for their processing, individual models are necessitated for each source due to the disparate dimensions. To tackle this problem, we propose a shared encoder to project all HSIs into a unified feature space. It establishes a general framework for the representation of multi-source HSIs, providing foundational conditions for the development of a universal HSI analysis model. | Weili Kong, Baisen Liu, Xiaojun Bi, Jiaming Pei |  |
| 33 |  |  [Transfer Learning for Global Feature Importance Measurements](https://openreview.net/forum?id=EExn3iNKs3) |  | 0 | Understanding feature importance is crucial for conducting interpretable clinical decision-making. However, the reliability of such analyses can be heavily impacted by the available sample size, placing sites with lower data quality and smaller sample sizes at inherent disadvantages. To address the challenge, we propose a model-agnostic transfer learning-based approach for feature importance measurement and evaluate its effectiveness using real-world heterogeneous electronic health records. | Xin Li, Siqi Li, Qiming Wu, Kunyu Yu |  |
| 34 |  |  [Enhancing Spiking Transformers with Binary Attention Mechanisms](https://openreview.net/forum?id=6X3TNqLb5t) |  | 0 | Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are increasingly recognized as an efficient alternative to traditional artificial neural networks. Recent advancements, particularly the integration of SNNs with Transformer structures to create 'SpikFormer', have significantly enhanced the performance of SNNs. However, the current non-spiking form of attention in SpikFormer poses risks of attention value explosion and still results in high computational costs for SNNs. To address this issue, we propose a novel binary attention mechanism. By introducing an attention shift mechanism and adaptive thresholds for neurons, we have successfully binarized the attention matrices in SpikFormer, leading to more efficient and sparser spiking neural networks. Experiments on image and neuromorphic datasets demonstrate that our approach maintains comparable performance to the original SpikFormer while reducing computational costs. | Guobin Shen, Dongcheng Zhao, Sicheng Shen, Yi Zeng |  |
| 35 |  |  [Key Patch Proposer: Key Patches Contain Rich Information](https://openreview.net/forum?id=NHm3OB6bIG) |  | 0 | In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm named Key Patch Proposer (KPP) designed to select key patches in an image without additional training. Our experiments showcase KPP's robust capacity to capture semantic information by both reconstruction and classification tasks. The efficacy of KPP suggests its potential application in active learning for semantic segmentation. Our source code is publicly available at https://github.com/CA-TT-AC/key-patch-proposer. | Jing Xu, Beiwen Tian, Hao Zhao |  |
| 36 |  |  [Hallucination Benchmark in Medical Visual Question Answering](https://openreview.net/forum?id=vxlXqOj4zv) |  | 0 | The recent success of large language and vision models (LLVMs) on vision question answering (VQA), particularly their applications in medicine (Med-VQA), has shown a great potential of realizing effective visual assistants for healthcare. However, these models are not extensively tested on the hallucination phenomenon in clinical settings. Here, we created a hallucination benchmark of medical images paired with question-answer sets and conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the state-of-the-art models. The study provides an in-depth analysis of current models' limitations and reveals the effectiveness of various prompting strategies. | Jinge Wu, Yunsoo Kim, Honghan Wu |  |
| 37 |  |  [Distilled Self-Critique of LLMs with Synthetic Data: a Bayesian Perspective](https://openreview.net/forum?id=AfVtVrCH9U) |  | 0 | This paper proposes an interpretation of RLAIF as Bayesian inference by introducing distilled Self-Critique (dSC), which refines the outputs of a LLM through a Gibbs sampler that is later distilled into a fine-tuned model. Only requiring synthetic data, dSC is exercised in experiments regarding safety, sentiment, and privacy control, showing it can be a viable and cheap alternative to align LLMs. Code released at https://github.com/vicgalle/distilled-self-critique. | Víctor Gallego |  |
| 38 |  |  [Parameter and Data Efficient Spectral Style-DCGAN](https://openreview.net/forum?id=JQlfTmlHNz) |  | 0 | We present a simple, highly parameter, and data-efficient adversarial network for unconditional face generation. Our method: Spectral Style-DCGAN or SSD utilizes only 6.574 million parameters and 4739 dog faces from the Animal Faces HQ (AFHQ) dataset as training samples while preserving fidelity at low resolutions up to 64x64. Code available at Anonymous-repo. | Aryan Garg |  |

In this work, we solve autonomous drone navigation's sub-problem of predicting out-of-domain human and agent trajectories using a deep generative model. Our method: General-PECNet or G-PECNet observes an improvement of $9.5$% on the Final Displacement Error (FDE) on 2020's benchmark: PECNet through a combination of architectural improvements inspired by periodic activation functions and synthetic trajectory or data augmentations using hidden markov modeling and reinforcement learning based agents. Additionally, we propose a simple geometry-inspired loss and evaluation metric for trajectory non-linearity analysis.

Although researchers have proposed various data augmentation techniques, they often lack consideration for the difficulty of augmented data. Recently, another line of research suggests incorporating the concept of curriculum learning with data augmentation in the field of natural language processing. In this study, we adopt curriculum data augmentation for image data augmentation and propose \*\*colorful cutout\*\*, which gradually increases the noise and difficulty introduced in the augmented image. Our experimental results highlight the possibility of curriculum data augmentation for image data. We publicly released our source code to improve the reproducibility of our study. | Juhwan Choi, YoungBin Kim |  |

Their strength lies in their attention mechanism, which allows for the discovering of complex input relationships. However, this mechanism's quadratic time and memory complexity pose challenges for larger inputs. Researchers are now investigating models like Linear Unified Nested Attention (Luna) or Memory Augmented Transformer, which leverage external learnable memory to either reduce the attention computation complexity down to linear, or to propagate information between chunks in chunk-wise processing. Our findings challenge the conventional thinking on these models, revealing that interfacing with the memory directly through an attention operation is suboptimal, and that the performance may be considerably improved by filtering the input signal before communicating with memory. | Uladzislau Yorsh, Martin Holena, Ondrej Bojar, David Herel |  |

We expand a previous theoretical discussion of a simple toy example of PCN in the training stage. Compared to classic gradient-based empirical risk minimization, we observe differences for the ReLU activation function. This leads us to carry out an empirical evaluation of classification tasks on FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10. We show that while ReLU might be a good baseline for classic machine learning, for predictive coding, it performs worse than other activation functions while also leading to the largest drop in performance compared to gradient-based empirical risk minimization. | Simon Frieder, Luca Pinchetti, Thomas Lukasiewicz |  |

The introduction of Lean4, a mathematical programming language, presents an unprecedented opportunity to rigorously assess the autoformalization capabilities of LLMs. This paper introduces a novel evaluation benchmark designed for Lean4, applying it to test the abilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Gemini Pro. Our comprehensive analysis reveals that, despite recent advancements, these LLMs still exhibit limitations in autoformalization, particularly in more complex areas of mathematics. These findings underscore the need for further development in LLMs to fully harness their potential in scientific research and development. This study not only benchmarks current LLM capabilities but also sets the stage for future enhancements in the field of autoformalization. | Jasdeep Sidhu, Shubhra Mishra, Aryan Gulati, Devanshu Ladsaria, Brando Miranda |  |

In contrast, traditional software development avoids these pitfalls, offering full interpretability, less data dependency, and easy integration of intuitive decision-making. To have the strengths of both approaches, we introduce the BasedOn library.

Addressing this issue begins with estimating plastic distribution in oceans for effective policy and awareness efforts. Traditional monitoring methods are costly and labour-intensive, with limited coverage. Deep learning models using multispectral remote sensing data show promise in overcoming these limitations. However, accurately distinguishing floating plastic from other sea surface features remains challenging. In our work, we use the multi-spectral Sentinel-2 MARIDA dataset to explore the impact of various spectral feature combinations on the performance of deep learning models for segmenting marine plastic in the presence of other sea surface features. This innovative approach improves accuracy and serves as an open benchmark for multi-spectral marine debris segmentation. | Dyutit Mohanty, Aditya Kasliwal, Bharath Udupa, Pratinav Seth |  |

Network inversion, a technique that aims to reconstruct the input space from the model’s learned internal representations, plays a pivotal role in unraveling the black-box nature of input to output mappings in neural networks. In safety-critical scenarios, where model outputs may influence pivotal decisions, the integrity of the corresponding input space is paramount, necessitating the elimination of any extraneous ”garbage” to ensure the trustworthiness of the network. Binarised Neural Networks (BNNs), characterized by binary weights and activations, offer computational efficiency and reduced memory requirements, making them suitable for resource-constrained environments. This paper introduces a novel approach to invert a trained BNN by encoding it into a CNF formula that captures the network’s structure, allowing for both inference and inversion. | Pirzada Suhail |  |

Complex models, including deep neural networks, transformers etc., often inherit biases and stereotypes during training, attributable to selection bias within training data and algorithmic creation processes. Augmentation techniques like Mixup exhibit promising potential as debiasing frameworks, leveraging specialized sampling strategies and spatial information for bias mitigation. In this study, we evaluate gender bias within the distance-aware mixing frameworks, while exploring diverse sampling strategies for mixup. Using the Trustpilot corpus, we conduct experiments quantitatively analyzing bias as error disparity, investigating the impact of distance thresholds and various gender-based criteria on mixup operations. Our quantitative analysis indicates that employing a cross-gender mixup strategy yields the most effective bias reduction. We also release the code for our work. | Samyak Jain, Parth Chhabra, Ramit Sawhney |  |

In this work, we conduct an empirical ablation study on updating keys (the 1st layer in the FFNs layer) or values (the 2nd layer in the FFNs layer). We compare those two methods in various knowledge editing and fine-tuning tasks of large language models to draw insights to understand FFNs further.

These SMILES strings are used in different complex machine learning-based drug-related research and representation works. Escaping from complex representation, in this work, we pose a single question: What if we treat drug SMILES as conventional sentences and engage in text classification for drug classification? Our experiments affirm the possibility with very competitive scores. The study explores the notion of viewing each atom and bond as sentence components, employing basic NLP methods to categorize drug types, proving that complex problems can also be solved with simpler perspectives.

This research is focused on evaluating learning methods for adapting pre-trained monolingual text-to-speech (TTS) models to multilingual conditions, i.e., Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Transfer Learning (TL). This comparison utilizes three distinct metrics: Mean Opinion Score (MOS), Recognition Accuracy (RA), and Mel Cepstral Distortion (MCD). Results demonstrate that, in comparison to SFT, TL leads to significantly enhanced performance, with an average MOS higher by 1.53 points, a 37.5\% increase in RA, and approximately a 7.8-point improvement in MCD.

Because such a perceptron relies on biochemical interactions, it must adapt to perturbations and be resilient against stochastic fluctuations to maintain faithful in vivo classification. In this paper, we design a molecular exchange mechanism (MEM)-based perceptron following a set of evolutionarily preserved in vivo signaling steps, including negative feedback known for noise regulation. The efficacy study of the MEM-perceptron demonstrates an improved adaptation against perturbations and noise. | Moshiur Rahman, Muhtasim Ishmum Khan, Md. Shahriar Karim |  |

While deeper architectures like ResNet have made strides, shallow Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) remain underexplored. Activation functions, pivotal for introducing non-linearity, drive significant progress. This paper investigates complex piece-wise linear hidden layer activations. Our experiments highlight their superiority over traditional Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs) across architectures.

Incorrect assumptions can lead to poor model performance and unreliable uncertainty estimates. In this paper, we introduce a simple method for non-parametric aleatoric uncertainty quantification. In particular, we train a neural network model for binary classification. The inputs to our binary classifier are the independent variables and a sample from the marginal distribution of the dependent variable. This binary classifier is trained to predict whether the sample from the marginal distribution of the dependent variable is greater than the dependent variable corresponding to independent variables in the input. Our method can be used for not only quantifying aleatoric uncertainty but also estimating the conditional distribution of the dependent variable. | Kshitij Kapoor, Debayan Gupta |  |

In this work, we present $\textbf{U2NeRF}$, a transformer-based architecture that learns to render and restore novel views conditioned on multi-view geometry simultaneously. We attempt to implicitly bake restoring capabilities onto the NeRF pipeline and disentangle the predicted color into several components and when combined reconstruct the underwater image in a self-supervised manner. In addition, we release an Underwater View Synthesis $\textbf{UVS}$ dataset consisting of 8 real underwater scenes. Our experiments demonstrate that when optimized on a single scene, U2NeRF outperforms several baselines and showcases improved rendering and restoration capabilities. | Vinayak Gupta, Manoj S., Mukund Varma T., Kaushik Mitra |  |

We introduce an automated scaling approach leveraging second-order loss landscape information. Our method is flexible towards skip connections a mainstay in modern vision transformers. Our training-aware method jointly scales and trains transformers without additional training iterations. Motivated by the hypothesis that not all neurons need uniform depth complexity, our approach embraces depth heterogeneity. Extensive evaluations on DeiT-S with ImageNet100 show a 2.5% accuracy gain and 10% parameter efficiency improvement over conventional scaling. Scaled networks demonstrate superior performance upon training small scale datasets from scratch. We introduce the first intact scaling mechanism for vision transformers, a step towards efficient model scaling. | Akash Guna R. T., Arnav Chavan, Deepak K. Gupta |  |

Using a minimalist vision dataset and a measure of generalizability, we show that popular networks, from deep convolutional networks (CNNs) to transformers, vary in their power to extrapolate to unseen classes both across layers and across architectures. Accuracy is not a good predictor of generalizability, and generalization varies non-monotonically with layer depth. | Evan Gerritz, Luciano Dyballa, Steven W. Zucker |  |

We have also identified instances where hateful/toxic/implicitly controversial content was wrongly marked as hopeful. The implications for deploying models trained on this dataset are profound, risking biases and stigmatization. We advocate for thoroughly examining the HopeEDI dataset, cautioning against biased models. We reannotate the hope speech and non-english labelled text, introducing a new class, 'Potentially Controversial', providing reasons for why the label was changed. This updated dataset aims to promote balance and mitigate ethical concerns in real-world applications. | Mohammad Aflah Khan, Neemesh Yadav, Diksha Sethi, Raghav Sahni |  |

It quantifies how well the sentences within the text are connected and how well the text is structured and organized. It plays a vital role in various downstream Natural Language Processing tasks such as text summarization, question answering and machine translation among others. In this work, we explore the use of topological data analysis (TDA) techniques on attention graphs of text documents to model coherence. TDA techniques are known to capture structural information and patterns in data, making it suitable for modeling the $\textit{structure}$ and $\textit{flow}$ of a document, i.e. coherence. We validate our approach with experiments on the GCDC dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results with a simple MLP. | Samyak Jain, Rishi Singhal, Sriram Krishna, Yaman Kumar Singla, Rajiv Ratn Shah |  |

Current research on mitigating label errors stems primarily from advances in deep learning, and a gap exists in exploring interpretable models, particularly those rooted in decision trees. In this study, we investigate whether ideas from deep learning loss design can be applied to improve the robustness of decision trees. In particular, we show that loss correction and symmetric losses, both standard approaches, are not effective. We argue that other directions need to be explored to improve the robustness of decision trees in dealing with label noise. | Lukasz Sztukiewicz, Jack Henry Good, Artur Dubrawski |  |

While previous QML implementations have demonstrated performance efficiency gains over classical benchmarks, it has not been studied in detail whether shallow unentangled quantum circuits can provide the same benefits to reinforcement learning algorithms. Towards this goal, we present a shallow Deep Q-Network (DQN) hybrid quantum-classical Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC) model in the Cartpole-v0 environment that provides an increase in training stability and average reward for any given training run with a simpler unentangled quantum circuit than what is proposed in prior literature. | Evan Mitchell, Biswajit Basu, Pabitra Mitra |  |

Existing text-to-image models often encounter challenges in accurately incorporating text within an image context. This paper introduces a novel conditional inpainting technique aimed at overcoming these limitations.

In this paper, we propose a Perturbation Minimization method to extract borderline samples from a trained classifier.

The primary motivation for this task stems from the high costs and cumbersome processes associated with annotating large datasets. To mitigate this, we propose utilising Large Language Models (LLMs) for annotation assistance. Although LLMs show promise, they struggle with response randomness, and their previous prompts is static and do not learn from their outputs. To address this, we propose \`self-teaching prompting' (STP), a method that enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to iteratively learn from their consistent samples and refine their predictions over time. Our experiments with multi-intention datasets demonstrate that STP significantly enhances response accuracy. | Cheng Chen, Ivor W. Tsang |  |

Here, we introduce knowledge distillation through time (KDTT). In traditional knowledge distillation (KD), a reliable teacher model is used to train an error-prone student model. The difference between the teacher and student is typically model capacity; the teacher is larger in architecture. In KDTT, the teacher and student models differ in their assigned tasks. The teacher model is tasked with detecting events in sequential data, a simple task compared to the student model, which is challenged with forecasting said events in the future. Through KDTT, the student can use the ’future’ logits from a teacher model to extract temporal uncertainty. We show the efficacy of KDTT on seizure prediction, where the student forecaster achieves a 20.0% average increase in the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic (AUC-ROC) | Skye Gunasekaran, Jason Eshraghian, Ruomin Zhu, Zdenka Kuncic |  |
| 71 |  |  [Can Perplexity Reflect Large Language Model's Ability in Long Text Understanding?](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Cjp6YKVeAa) |  | 0 | Recent studies have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to process extremely long text with evidence that LLMs could perform well in the language modeling task with even 1 million input tokens. When the input context length increases, the perplexity (PPL) of the model is observed to maintain at a low level or even decrease. However, in our study, we find that the PPL may only reflect the model's ability to model local information instead of catching long-range dependency, and thus only using PPL to prove the model could process very long context is not appropriate. The local focus feature of perplexity could also explain some existing phenomena, such as the great extrapolation ability of the position method ALiBi. When evaluating a model's ability in long text, we might pay more attention to the limitation of PPL and avoid overly reliance on it. | Yutong Hu, Quzhe Huang, Mingxu Tao, Chen Zhang, Yansong Feng |  |

This can lead to suboptimal recommendations that do not account for what the user has already viewed or selected in their current browsing session. In this paper, we propose a session-aware product filter recommendation framework that leverages user's past actions to provide filter recommendations. An offline evaluation demonstrates that our model achieved significant improvement over non-contextual baseline models. | Hanqing Lu, Xianfeng Tang, Chen Luo, Limeng Cui, Zhenwei Dai, Rahul Goutam, Haiyang Zhang, Monica Xiao Cheng |  |

These interplays are commonly facilitated through various prompting paradigms. However, such paradigms require extended interaction traces between the LLMs and the environment, resulting in low task-solving efficiency. In this work, we integrate speculative sampling (SpS) into the novel ReAct paradigm. In particular, we investigate speculative sampling’s impact on the efficiency of ReAct and the quality of reasoning tasks. Our evaluations using HotPotQA and FEVER datasets demonstrate that implementing speculative sampling alongside ReAct results in a 2.18x-2.62x acceleration compared to using ReAct alone, while only introducing a negligible impact on the reasoning abilities. | Han Xu, Jingyang Ye, Yutong Li, Haipeng Chen |  |

The computational demands associated with even minimal gradient updates present challenges, particularly on consumer-grade hardware. This paper introduces an innovative approach for the parametric and practical compression of LLMs based on reduced order modelling, which entails low-rank decomposition within the feature space and re-parameterization in the weight space. Notably, this compression technique operates in a layer-wise manner, obviating the need for a GPU device and enabling the compression of billion-scale models within stringent constraints of both memory and time. Our method represents a significant advancement in model compression by leveraging matrix decomposition, demonstrating superior efficacy compared to the prevailing state-of-the-art structured pruning method. | Arnav Chavan, Nahush Lele, Deepak K.

Generalizing linear classification, we establish a surprising fact: linear classifiers can have arbitrarily high VC dimension, stemming from increasing the number of partitions in input space. Hence, linear classifiers with multiple margins are more expressive than single-margin classifiers. Despite a higher VC dimension, such classifiers have less open space risk than halfspace separators. These geometric insights are useful to detect unseen classes, while probabilistic modeling of risk minimization helps with seen classes. In supervised anomaly detection, we show that a classifier that combines a probabilistic and geometric lens can detect both seen and unseen anomalies well. | Matthew Lau, Leyan Pan, Stefan Davidov, Athanasios P.

A recent work introduced a novel measure considering unit-wise capacities and provided a better explanation and tighter generalization bounds but was confined to two-layer networks. This paper extends that framework to three-layer ReLU networks.

It has been used in machine learning to significantly improve the computational efficiency over homogeneous graphs. In heterogeneous graphs with diverse types of nodes and edges, however, sparsification has not been extensively explored. This work develops sparsification methods that can preserve edge density across different edge types and/or edge importance in terms of eigenvector centrality, improving over existing methods. The methods have been tested on real-world networks, and the results indicate great improvements in the computational efficiency and memory cost. | Srilekha Geda, Chunjiang Zhu |  |

Safe RL solutions focus on maximizing environment rewards while minimizing cost. In this work, we extend the Multi-Agent Constrained Policy Optimisation (MACPO) approach that maintains policy consistency using Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. We find that Jensen-Shannon (JS) Divergence, a symmetric measure, serves as a better alternative to KL divergence; its symmetric nature is more forgiving of extreme differences in policies. Our results demonstrate that JS divergence improves rewards and reduces costs, enhancing safety and performance in multi-agent systems. | Rushikesh Zawar, Prabhdeep Singh Sethi, Roshan Roy |  |

Existing methods for estimating the homophily ratio typically rely on knowing the class labels of each node in the graph. While several algorithms address both homophilic and heterophilic graphs, they necessitate prior knowledge of the homophily ratio to choose the appropriate one. To address this limitation, we propose a novel metric for measuring homophily ratio without information about node labels. In our approach, we define learnable affinity vectors for each node, characterizing the expected feature relationships with its neighbors. Our method, Affinity-based Homophily, derives the homophily ratio using these affinity vectors, eliminating the need for prior node label information. We conducted experiments on various benchmark homophilic and heterophilic graphs, demonstrating the commendable performance of our homophily measure. | Indranil Ojha, Kushal Bose, Swagatam Das |  |

However, the effect of embedded text on the image encoding process remains unexplored. In this work, we eliminated the text in text-embedded images and compared the intervention's effect on the performance of unimodal and multimodal models. We find that the image encoders of multimodal models utilize linguistic information in the pixel space to a considerable degree. Further, we observe that disentangling text and images can improve multimodal learning under certain circumstances. | Siddhant Bikram Shah |  |

Our findings reveal the IC model's capability to generate captions from masked images, closely resembling the original content. Notably, even in the presence of masks, the model adeptly crafts descriptive textual information that goes beyond what is observable in the original image-generated captions. While the decoding performance of the IC model experiences a decline with an increase in the masked region's area, the model still performs well when important regions of the image are not masked at high coverage. | Zhicheng Du, Zhaotian Xie, Huazhang Ying, Likun Zhang, Peiwu Qin |  |

Prior studies use knowledge graphs (KGs) to enhance output transparency, but mostly focus on non-generative or short-form QA. We present Revelio, a new layer that maps PLM's inner working onto a KG walk. Tests on two LFQA datasets show that Revelio supports PLM-generated answers with reasoning paths presented as rationales while retaining performance and time akin to their vanilla counterparts. | Gianluca Moro, Luca Ragazzi, Lorenzo Valgimigli, Fabian Vincenzi, Davide Freddi |  |

Most existing machine unlearning approaches require a model to be fine-tuned to remove information while preserving performance. This is computationally expensive and necessitates the storage of the whole dataset for the lifetime of the model. Retraining-free approaches often utilise Fisher information, which is derived from the loss and requires labelled data which may not be available. Thus, we present an extension to the Selective Synaptic Dampening algorithm, substituting the diagonal of the Fisher information matrix for the gradient of the $l_2$ norm of the model output to approximate sensitivity. We evaluate our method in a range of experiments using ResNet18 and Vision Transformer. Results show our label-free method is competitive with existing state-of-the-art approaches. | Jack Foster, Stefan Schoepf, Alexandra Brintrup |  |

No other universal baselines for this task exist. We propose a novel baseline that selects a subset of face meshes, called OptiFaces, that minimise overall 3D reconstruction error. This is a universal approach to calculate dataset-specific metrics for 3D face reconstruction, offering intuitive new baselines for the interpretation of 3D reconstruction error. | Will Rowan, Patrik Huber, Nick E.

Trained on a thoroughly curated and annotated dataset of diverse human faces, FeedFace operates without additional training for new facial conditions during generation. Our method can create images that are not only true to the textual descriptions but also exhibit remarkable facial faithfulness in seconds. Our model supports using multiple faces as input conditions, leveraging extra facial information to improve facial consistency. A key strength of our method lies in its efficiency. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that FeedFace can produce face-conditioned samples with comparable quality to leading industry methods, using only 0.4% of their data volume and fewer than 5% of the samples seen by these methods during training. | Chendong Xiang, Armando Teles Fortes, Khang Hui Chua, Hang Su, Jun Zhu |  |

Based on a recently introduced union-free generic depth function for partial orders/rankings, it fully exploits the ordinal information and allows for incomparability. Our method describes the distribution of all partial orders/rankings, avoiding the notorious shortcomings of aggregation. This permits to identify test functions that produce central or outlying rankings of optimizers and to assess the quality of benchmarking suites. | Julian Rodemann, Hannah Blocher |  |

We propose LLM Self Defense, a simple approach to defend against these attacks by having an LLM screen the induced responses, thus not requiring any fine-tuning, input preprocessing, or iterative output generation. Instead, we incorporate the generated content into a pre-defined prompt and employ another instance of an LLM to analyze the text and predict whether it is harmful. Notably, LLM Self Defense succeeds in reducing the attack success rate to virtually 0 against various types of attacks on GPT 3.5 and Llama 2.

While previous research has highlighted the efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) for cognitive reframing, there has been limited focus on enhancing reframing quality across multiple linguistic attributes in the final output. This paper fills this gap by employing LLMs to generate and iteratively refine reframed thoughts.

While privacy measures have been dramatically improved with the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), generating high-utility synthetic samples remains challenging. To increase the samples' utility, we propose a novel architecture called DownStream Feedback Generative Adversarial Network (DSF-GAN). This approach uses feedback from a downstream prediction model mid-training, to add valuable information to the generator’s loss function. Hence, DSF-GAN harnesses a downstream prediction task to increase the utility of the synthetic samples. To properly evaluate our method, we tested it using two popular data sets. Our experiments show better model performance when training on DSF-GAN-generated synthetic samples compared to synthetic data generated using the same GAN architecture without feedback when evaluated on the same validation set comprised of real samples. All code and datasets used in this research are openly available for ease of reproduction. | Oriel Perets, Nadav Rappoport |  |

This paper introduces Doc2Command, a multi-task, multimodal model that unifies the document and user request into a singular visual modality and utilises a transformer base image encoder-text decoder to generate the command text. Additionally, it reconceptualises bounding box detection as a segmentation task and employs a mask transformer operating on the image encoder. Doc2Command surpasses baseline models in command text generation, demonstrating significant performance improvements ranging from 2-33\% for exact matched commands. It also improves on the bounding box detection task on existing baselines by a margin of 12.19-31.65\%. | Manan Suri, Puneet Mathur, Ramit Sawhney, Preslav Nakov, Dinesh Manocha |  |

Most existing methods uniformly construct brain networks for different groups (e.g., male and female groups, healthy and sick people groups), facing the interference of group-irrelevant noises and failing to capture group-specific features to enhance brain networks. To address this issue, this paper proposes an adaptive brain network augmentation method based on group-aware graph learning. We construct group-aware brain networks, which can adapt to distinct groups, reducing the interference of noises, and improving model robustness across various tasks and subject groups. | Ciyuan Peng, Mujie Liu, Chenxuan Meng, Shuo Yu, Feng Xia |  |

Among the most intuitive type of explanations are counterfactuals, which are examples that differ from a given point only in the prediction target and some set of features, presenting which features need to be changed in the original example to flip the prediction for that example. However, such counterfactuals can have many different features than the original example, making their interpretation difficult. In this paper, we propose to explicitly add a cardinality constraint to counterfactual generation limiting how many features can be different from the original example, thus providing more interpretable and easily understantable counterfactuals. | Rubén RuizTorrubiano |  |

This hallucination is possibly not due to insufficient training on the data but rather is inherent in the data themselves. A training label might suggest that 'a premise infers a hypothesis', but this inferential link could be overstated. This overstating might arise from the mismatch in intensity or context. We propose that reinforcing the premise could mitigate this problem. To address this, we introduce a method that employs predicate logic and natural deduction to explicitly articulate assumptions that validate the inferential link. This method allows for a transparent inference process, drawing logically plausible conclusions based on explicit premises. The NLI model may thus achieve higher reliability in understanding and processing natural language. | Wenchuan Mu, Kwan Hui Lim |  |

However, MDNs are often difficult to train due to mode collapse and a need for careful initialization, which becomes even more problematic when the number of mixture components are strongly overestimated. To address this issue in motion planning problems, we propose a pre-training scheme for MDNs called common sense initialization (CSI). Pre-training with CSI allows variety-encouraging optimization such as Winner-Takes-All (WTA) to exploit the initialized weights during training so that the MDN can converge when the number of components are overestimated. This paper presents empirical evidence for the effectiveness of CSI when applied to motion planning of pedestrian agents in urban environments. | Thomas Kreutz, Max Mühlhäuser, Alejandro Sánchez Guinea |  |

Like other generative models, they are highly dependent on the quality of their training dataset, and generating good editing datasets is an expensive task. In this paper, we show that a simple refinement of the original InstructPix2Pix (Brooks et al., 2023) dataset using SDXL (Podell et al., 2023) leads to consistent improvements in downstream models. We finetune SDXL on our refined dataset and observe competitive performance to much more cost-intensive methods.

However, the size of the uncertainty set is crucial due to the inherent trade-off between robustness and conservatives: a larger uncertainty set fosters a more robust solution but tends towards increased conservativeness, while a smaller set may sacrifice robustness for higher performance. In this work, we introduce a novel method to learn the size of reward uncertainty set from data. Such a data-driven approach ensures that the learned uncertainty set is large enough to cover the underlying models implied by the data while being compact to minimize conservativeness. | Navdeep Kumar, Kaixin Wang, Uri Gadot, Kfir Yehuda Levy, Shie Mannor |  |

While the standard CLIPScore metric can reflect text-image alignment to some extent, it often falls short in consistency with human perception. We propose the use of GPT-4 Vision as a novel evaluative standard, capable of interpreting text and image nuances akin to human cognition. Our study focuses on the pivotal role of prompt design in maximizing GPT-4 Vision's effectiveness, presenting a systematic discussion for prompt construction. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that GPT-4 Vision, augmented by our prompt-design strategy, aligns more closely with human judgment. | Xiao Cui, Qi Sun, Wengang Zhou, Houqiang Li |  |

However, the lack of efficient models imposes a barrier for the adoption of such models in resource-constrained environments. Therefore, smaller distilled models for the Spanish language could be proven to be highly scalable and facilitate their further adoption on a variety of tasks and scenarios. In this work, we take one step in this direction by developing SpanishTinyRoBERTa, a compressed language model based on RoBERTa for efficient question answering in Spanish. To achieve this, we employ knowledge distillation from a large model onto a lighter model that allows for a wider implementation, even in areas with limited computational resources, whilst attaining negligible performance sacrifice. Our experiments show that the dense distilled model can still preserve the performance of its larger counterpart, while significantly increasing inference speedup. This work serves as a starting point for further research and investigation of model compression efforts for Spanish language models across various NLP tasks. | Adrián Bazaga, Pietro Lio, Gos Micklem |  |

AdAct amalgamates various well-established and novel activation functions into a single, learnable framework, allowing dynamic adaptation to specific network layers' needs. We explore the effectiveness of ReLU and its variants, including ELU, LReLU, PReLU, RReLU, and more recent functions like Swish and Mish, integrating them into the AdAct function. Employing ConvNet variants across FMNIST, CIFAR10, SVHN and FER datasets, our study empirically assesses each function's contribution and demonstrates AdAct's potential in optimizing neural networks, especially in selecting optimal activation functions for diverse tasks. | Ritabrata Maiti |  |

Previous methods lack the explicit alignment between object-level and scene text-level in visual-linguistic modalities. To address this issue, we propose a novel two-stage model with cross-level contrastive learning. In the first pre-training stage, we encourage the model to enhance the proximity of cross-level cross-modal representations within the same image in semantic space, while also distancing representations from different images. Then we fine-tune the model to generate the answer to the question. Experimental results on a widely used benchmark dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model compared to existing methods. | Yuejy, Xiaojun Bi, Zheng Chen |  |

The main idea is to disentangle the latent space of a pre-trained generation model and precisely control the face attributes of child images with clear semantics. We use distances between face landmarks as pseudo labels so as to avoid using external labels. By calculating the gradient of latent vectors to pseudo labels, we figure out the most influential semantic vectors of the corresponding face attributes. Then we disentangle the semantic vectors in three aspects: adding a weight factor in the calculating process, working on the proper resolution layers, and using Schmidt orthogonalization to orthogonalize these vectors. Finally, we fuse the latent vectors of the parents by leveraging the disentangled semantic vectors under the guidance of biological genetic laws. | Xiao Cui, Wengang Zhou, Houqiang Li |  |

We build texture-object associations that uncover new insights about the relationships between texture and object classes in CNNs and find three classes of results: associations that are strong and expected, strong and not expected, and expected but not present. Our analysis demonstrates that investigations in texture learning enable new methods for interpretability and have the potential to uncover unexpected biases. | Blaine Hoak, Patrick D. McDaniel |  |

We find that training on math-only data improves simple arithmetic but doesn't fully account for complex reasoning abilities, such as chain-of-thought reasoning. We also find that code data contributes to chain-of-thought reasoning while reducing arithmetic performance. | Yasaman Razeghi, Hamish Ivison, Sameer Singh, Yanai Elazar |  |

Obtaining behavioral guarantees for these agents remains an important problem. In this work, we focus on guaranteeing a model-based planning agent reaches a goal state within a specific future time step. We show that there exists a lower bound for the reward at the goal state, such that if the said reward is below that bound, it is impossible to obtain such a guarantee. By extension, we show how to enforce preferences over multiple goals. | Zhiyu An, Xianzhong Ding, Wan Du |  |

They perform feature learning on graphs using message passing on the network structure, avoiding the feature engineering step required for traditional tabular approaches for GML tasks. However, it is unclear which structural features GNNs can or cannot easily learn from data, especially for node- and edge-level properties. In this work, we propose a methodology to investigate which structural features GNNs can reconstruct from graph data. We conducted a first experimental analysis on one of the most used benchmarks for GML, considering some of the most well-known node-level features, such as centrality and transitivity measures. The results show that GNNs can easily reconstruct PageRank and in/out-degree centralities. But, surprisingly, GNNs can also learn centrality measures based on shortest path distances. Moreover, they reach quite good performance in learning the local clustering coefficient. | Manuel Dileo, Matteo Zignani |  |

Traditional methods, like prompt or prefix tuning, typically rely on arbitrary tokens for training, leading to prolonged training times and generalized token use across various class labels. To address these issues, this paper introduces L-Tuning, an efficient fine-tuning approach designed for classification tasks within the Natural Language Inference (NLI) framework. Diverging from conventional methods, L-Tuning focuses on the fine-tuning of label tokens processed through a pre-trained LLM, thereby harnessing its pre-existing semantic knowledge. This technique not only improves the fine-tuning accuracy and efficiency but also facilitates the generation of distinct label embeddings for each class, enhancing the model's training nuance. Our experimental results indicate a significant improvement in training efficiency and classification accuracy with L-Tuning compared to traditional approaches, marking a promising advancement in fine-tuning LLMs for complex language tasks.

However, numerous systems in science and engineering often exhibit intricate memory behaviours, being classical ODEs inadequate for such tasks due to their inability to handle strong and complex memory effects. In this work, we introduce the Neural Fractional Differential Equation (Neural FDE), a Neural Network (NN) architecture to fit a FDE to data. With this we leverage the capabilities of FDEs allowing the architecture to take into account all past states and their influence on a system's current and future behaviours. Neural FDE inherently exhibits memory, providing a more accurate representation of complex phenomena in systems with long-term dependencies. Numerical experiments show Neural FDE generalises better and has faster convergence than Neural ODEs. | C. Coelho, M. Fernanda P. Costa, Luís L. Ferrás |  |

This paper investigates using the PSS in training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for Image Classification (IC). We show that by introducing two upper bounds for the PSS, we can train accurate CNNs without the need for calculating a learning rate apriori. Additionally, we compare the upper-bounded PSS rates against other adaptive learning rate methods (AdaGrad and AdaDelta), showing that they achieve competitive performance. | Daragh King |  |

However, in practical scenarios, the data distribution across the agents can have significant heterogeneity. In this work, we propose averaging rate scheduling as a simple yet effective way to reduce the impact of heterogeneity in decentralized learning. Our experiments illustrate the superiority of the proposed method ($\sim 3\%$ improvement in test accuracy) compared to the conventional approach of employing a constant averaging rate. | Sai Aparna Aketi, Sakshi Choudhary, Kaushik Roy |  |

These toxic contents leave a significant effect on one's personality which can even lead to depression and can be in various forms including audio and text. \textbf{However, the primary concern is that the benchmark datasets such as Toxigen for hate speech detection, are only text-based}. \textit{Therefore, in this research, for the first time, we have collected the audio-based hate speech dataset for unified security}. Utilizing both these modalities (text and audio), we have performed the benchmark study for audio and text hate detection and proposed a multimodal hate detection algorithm. | Kirtilekha Bhesra, Shivam Ashok Shukla, Akshay Agarwal |  |

This is partly due to a limited understanding of the conditions under which second-order optimization outperforms first-order optimization. This study aims to identify these conditions, particularly in terms of batch size and dataset size. We find empirically that second-order optimization outperforms first-order optimization when the batch size is large and the data set size is not too large. | Satoki Ishikawa, Rio Yokota |  |

A Dive into Bidirectional Transformer LMs Without Positional Encoding](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Jr3XQRtn3B) |  | 0 | Recent studies have shown that Autoregressive Transformer Language Models (LMs) can generate text sequences without relying on positional encodings (PEs). This capability is attributed to the causal masks in these models, which prevent tokens from accessing information from future tokens, allowing implicit learning of token positions. On the other hand, Bidirectional LMs, such as BERT, tend to under-perform on masked language modeling tasks when PEs are omitted. This performance dip arises because transformer layers are inherently permutation equivariant; without PEs, they cannot differentiate token positions, making bidirectional processing difficult. In this study, we examine a variant of bidirectional Transformer LM that operates without PEs but incorporates causal masks in its initial layers. Our findings reveal that this configuration yields masked language modeling losses comparable to traditional transformers that use PEs. However, when tested on the GLUE language understanding benchmark, the model without PEs exhibits diminished performance. These results highlight the importance of positional encodings in bidirectional LMs and indicate that pretraining loss might not always correlate with performance on downstream tasks. | Urchade Zaratiana |  |

However, their theoretical convergence guarantees require strict regularity conditions. Such conditions are unnatural and generally not satisfied in practice, causing such techniques to get stuck in a sub-optimal local maximum (rewards). Tree search (TS) methods, have been recently shown to enjoy strong empirical performance in related planning tasks. In this work, we attempt at first theoretical analysis of Tree search-based policy gradient and its convergence properties. Specifically, we show that for a large tree length, the number of local maxima decreases, and therefore in the limiting case, PG converges to a global optimal solution. | Navdeep Kumar, Priyank Agrawal, Kfir Yehuda Levy, Shie Mannor |  |

The fusion processes both need models to extract semantic information and contain details. Traditional image processing techniques used for this issue have limited ability to extract semantic features from images, and advanced deep learning techniques often lose the details. In this work, we propose the Controlled Fusion Network (CFN) that adopts a multi-step progressive generation method and injects control elements at every step. We test the model in the emoji fusion task which accepts various emojis and combines them. We find that the generated emojis sufficiently retain and reasonably combine the semantic information of the input images, while the result images also conform to human intuitive perception.

We introduce Autoregressive In-Context Distillation (AICD), a simple yet effective paradigm for this purpose. AICD employs meta-teacher forcing on chain-of-thought (CoT) examples and leverages the autoregressive nature of LLMs to jointly optimize the likelihood of all rationales in-context. Experiments on both mathematical and commonsense reasoning tasks demonstrate the efficacy of AICD. Furthermore, AICD enhances the capability of student LLMs in generating meaningful CoTs. | Yuxuan Liu |  |

Recently, Classifier-Guided Diffusion Model is proven effective to produce realistic and minimal counterfactuals. However, perfect intervention is often challenging to find and requires tedious fine-tuning. In this work, we propose Optimal Noise Level Search (ONLS), which leverages statistics from the guidance to automatically capture the balance without any fine-tuning process or extra network design. We demonstrate that our ONLS could accurately identify the optimal noise level for counterfactual estimation. The optimal per-sample results further contribute to an overall performance enhancement across the dataset.

In this work, unlike prior works that passively collect NAEs from real images, we propose to actively synthesize NAEs using the state-of-the-art Stable Diffusion. Specifically, our method formulates a controlled optimization process, where we perturb the token embedding that corresponds to a specified class to generate NAEs. This generation process is guided by the gradient of loss from the target classifier, ensuring that the created image closely mimics the ground-truth class yet fools the classifier. Named SD-NAE (Stable Diffusion for Natural Adversarial Examples), our innovative method is effective in producing valid and useful NAEs, which is demonstrated through a meticulously designed experiment.

However, conventional rule-based approaches suffer from the possibility of losing the original semantics of the given text. We propose a novel text data augmentation strategy that avoids such phenomena through a straightforward deletion of adverbs, which play a subsidiary role in the sentence. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed approach for not just single text classification, but also natural language inference that requires semantic preservation. We publicly released our source code for reproducibility. | Juhwan Choi, YoungBin Kim |  |

This paper analyzes different approaches for combining vision and touch to improve robotic scooping, using an open-source scooping dataset. We compare different architectures and modalities and analyze the their impact on in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance. We find that the best performing model on in-distribution terrains is the one which uses both vision and touch data and is trained end-to-end. However, the best performing model on out-of-distribution terrains is the one that uses only vision data. Future work should explore larger, diverse datasets and other self-supervised methods. | JiEun Jung |  |

Compounded by vendors silently releasing security patches without explicit notifications, users remain unaware of potential threats, providing attackers with opportunities. In navigating the intricate realm of software patches, understanding patch semantics becomes crucial for secure maintenance. Addressing this, we present MultiSEM, a multi-level Semantic Embedder for security patch detection. It employs fine-grained word-centric vectors and coarse-grained code-line representations, integrating patch descriptions for a comprehensive semantic view. MultiSEM excels in security patch detection, outperforming state-of-the-art models by 22.46% on PatchDB and 9.21% on SPI-DB in F1 metric evaluations. | Xunzhu Tang, Yewei Song, Haoye Tian, Zhenghan Chen, Jacques Klein, Tegawendé F.

Contrary to the conventional emphasis on dataset size, our research highlights the importance of data alignment - the similarity between training data and target domain. Through our experiments, we demonstrate a negative correlation between data alignment and model perplexity loss. These findings suggest a re-evaluation of LLM training approaches, emphasizing quality and relevance over quantity, especially in specialized applications such as autoformalization. | Krrish Chawla, Mario DePavia, Aryan Sahai, Brando Miranda |  |

Microstructures structure is stochastic, analogously to image textures. A particular microstructure can be well characterized by its spatial statistics, analogously to image texture being characterized by the response to a Fourier-like filter bank. Material design would benefit from low-dimensional representation of microstructure. In this work, we train Variational Autoencoders (VAE) ti produce reconstructions of textures that preserve the spatial statistics of the original texture, while not necessarily reconstructing the same image in data space. We accomplish this by adding a differentiable term to the cost function in order to minimize the distance between the original and the reconstruction in spatial statistics space. Our experiments indicate that it is possible to train a VAE that minimizes the distance in spatial statistics space between the original and the reconstruction of synthetic images. In future work, we will apply the same techniques to microstructures, with the goal of obtaining low-dimensional representations of material microstructures. | Sayed Sajad Hashemi, Michael Guerzhoy, Noah H.

A majority of the proposed FL protocols report performances in varied non-IID settings. Heterogeneity in non-IID descriptions in each protocol paper makes it very hard to compare the robustness of approaches to other studied approaches in differing settings. In this paper, we define a metric, NIRo, to capture data-quantity and data label-skewness and use it to propose a cumulative area-under-the-curve metric that can be used to quantify the robustness of FL protocols in varied non-IID settings. | Anupam Gupta, Pabitra Mitra |  |

We conducted experiments to evaluate the impact of different factors on BPE tokenizers, and proposed a novel pre-tokenization algorithm that is justified to maintain the balance between details and memory cost. Our analysis highlights the importance of a systematic understanding of the pre-tokenization process and provides a foundation for further exploration. | Zhenglong Wu, Qi Qi, Zirui Zhuang, Haifeng Sun, Jingyu Wang |  |

In the past few years, message passing-based Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as standard tools for direct learning from graph data. However, such direct integration during training also introduces challenges, including scalability issues with large-scale graphs and oversmoothing problems with increased model parameter sizes via additional layers. This study offers a bird's-eye view of high-level paradigms for learning from graph data, categorizing techniques into three distinct classes: (1) using graph structure during preprocessing, (2) using graph structure during training, and (3) using graph structure at test-time inference. Through this overview, we aim to illuminate diverse approaches and advantages inherent in learning from graph data across these fundamental paradigms. | Tong Zhao, Neil Shah, Elham Ghazizadeh |  |

There has also been several work on generating a sequence of text from a sequence of images, highlighting the effectiveness of fusing vision and language models to output text. In this work, we examine the effectiveness of fusing image and language models to generate a sequence of recipe images corresponding to the individual steps. We brainstorm different ways to fuse textual embeddings derived from each step to the encodings from the image, and empirically determine which is best. We also determine the relative importance of image and text encoders. | Hshmat Sahak |  |

These approaches draw inspiration from $f$-divergences. In the pseudo-labeling and entropy minimization techniques as self-training methods for effective semi-supervised learning, the self-training process has some inherent mismatch between the true label and pseudo-label (noisy pseudo-labels) and our empirical risk functions are robust with respect to noisy pseudo-labels. Under some conditions, our empirical risk functions demonstrate better performance when compared to traditional self-training methods. | Gholamali Aminian, Amirhossein Bagheri, Radmehr Karimian, Mahyar JafariNodeh, Mohammad Hossein Yassaee |  |

However, the scarcity of initial data limits our ability to make accu- rate predictions from scratch and to evaluate the model’s performance effectively. Therefore, our research team utilized generative artificial intelligence technology to amplify virtual log data in large quantities based on small original data to create a virtual test data set and verify whether it is effective as a learning and evalua- tion data set for DKT Model. As a result of the experiment, about 100,000 data sets were built from the initial data state of 10,000 data. The AI-generated dataset showed marginally higher AUC but also a higher BCE score and a lower F1 score compared to the original. These outcomes highlight GPT-4’s potential in increas- ing data volume and diversity, but they also underline the need for more precise prompts to better emulate learner behaviors and performance, particularly in the context of improving BCE and F1 scores. | NohMyongSung, Cho Ung Hui |  |

However, face recognition can be severely impacted due to several factors including illicit drug abuse on the facial regions. These abuses drastically alter the appearance of the faces and hence lead to the poor performance of the face recognition algorithms. However, due to the limited availability of the datasets, the research in this field is still in the novice stage. To advance the research, in this research, \`we have collected drug abuse face images and proposed a benchmark study to identify whether the face in question is clean or drug abused'. \textit{Further, we have performed the robustness study of detection networks by altering the images by adopting several enhancement filters popular to use before uploading the face images on social media platforms}. | Hruturaj Dhake, Akshay Agarwal |  |

They achieve high scores by leveraging great amounts of training data and technically "unlimited'' training time coupled with the simple cross-entropy loss. We argue that, similarly to the computer vision domain, the natural language processing tasks should be solved using more complex and task-specific losses. These are more robust and improve the results without increasing the training data, applying augmentation approaches, or increasing the overall number of steps. In this work, we propose a new loss term based on paraphrases of the summaries, coupled with cross-entropy, to train models for abstractive summarization, improving state-of-the-art results without increasing the required timesteps. | Daniele Rege Cambrin, Paolo Garza |  |

The nominal distribution that the model truly learns is commonly assumed as the Euclidean barycenter. In this paper, we propose $\textbf{Fed}$erated $\textbf{D}$istributionally $\textbf{R}$obust $\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\texttt{FedDRO}$) that constructs the Wasserstein barycenter among all distributions with a Wassertein ball as an ambiguity set. We reformulate this paradigm as a min-max optimization problem that trains a robust FL model in an adversarial way and analyze its generalization and optimization properties. | Wenqian Li, Shuran Fu, Yan Pang |  |

Detecting this type of contamination is challenging because the pretraining data used by proprietary models are often not publicly accessible. We propose a procedure for detecting test set contamination of language models with exact false positive guarantees and without access to pretraining data or model weights. Our approach leverages the fact that when there is no data contamination, all orderings of an exchangeable benchmark should be equally likely. In contrast, the tendency for language models to memorize example order means that a contaminated language model will find certain canonical orderings to be much more likely than others. Our test flags potential contamination whenever the likelihood of a canonically ordered benchmark dataset is significantly higher than the likelihood after shuffling the examples. We demonstrate that our procedure is sensitive enough to reliably detect contamination in challenging situations, including models as small as 1.4 billion parameters, on small test sets only 1000 examples, and datasets that appear only a few times in the pretraining corpus. Finally, we evaluate LLaMA-2 to apply our test in a realistic setting and find our results to be consistent with existing contamination evaluations. | Yonatan Oren, Nicole Meister, Niladri S.

Despite the complexity and importance of this task, it has yet to be meaningfully studied due to the challenges of evaluation: existing book-length summarization datasets (e.g., BookSum) are in the pretraining data of most public LLMs, and existing evaluation methods struggle to capture errors made by modern LLM summarizers. In this paper, we present the first study of the coherence of LLM-based book-length summarizers implemented via two prompting workflows: (1) hierarchically merging chunk-level summaries, and (2) incrementally updating a running summary. We obtain 1193 fine-grained human annotations on GPT-4 generated summaries of 100 recently-published books and identify eight common types of coherence errors made by LLMs. Because human evaluation is expensive and time-consuming, we develop an automatic metric, BooookScore, that measures the proportion of sentences in a summary that do not contain any of the identified error types. BooookScore has high agreement with human annotations and allows us to systematically evaluate the impact of many other critical parameters (e.g., chunk size, base LLM) while saving \$15K USD and 500 hours in human evaluation costs. We find that closed-source LLMs such as GPT-4 and Claude 2 produce summaries with higher BooookScore than those generated by open-source models. While LLaMA 2 falls behind other models, Mixtral achieves performance on par with GPT-3.5-Turbo. Incremental updating yields lower BooookScore but higher level of detail than hierarchical merging, a trade-off sometimes preferred by annotators. We release code and annotations to spur more principled research on book-length summarization. | Yapei Chang, Kyle Lo, Tanya Goyal, Mohit Iyyer |  |

These impressive capabilities seem to imply an escape from the curse of dimensionality, but recent reports of memorization of the training set raise the question of whether these networks are learning the "true" continuous density of the data. Here, we show that two DNNs trained on non-overlapping subsets of a dataset learn nearly the same score function, and thus the same density, when the number of training images is large enough. In this regime of strong generalization, diffusion-generated images are distinct from the training set, and are of high visual quality, suggesting that the inductive biases of the DNNs are well-aligned with the data density. We analyze the learned denoising functions and show that the inductive biases give rise to a shrinkage operation in a basis adapted to the underlying image. Examination of these bases reveals oscillating harmonic structures along contours and in homogeneous regions. We demonstrate that trained denoisers are inductively biased towards these geometry-adaptive harmonic bases since they arise not only when the network is trained on photographic images, but also when it is trained on image classes supported on low-dimensional manifolds for which the harmonic basis is suboptimal. Finally, we show that when trained on regular image classes for which the optimal basis is known to be geometry-adaptive and harmonic, the denoising performance of the networks is near-optimal. | Zahra Kadkhodaie, Florentin Guth, Eero P.

However, the limitations of Transformers in implementing learning algorithms, and their ability to learn other forms of algorithms are not well understood. Additionally, the degree to which these capabilities are confined to attention-based models is unclear. Furthermore, it remains to be seen whether the insights derived from these stylized settings can be extrapolated to pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we take a step towards answering these questions by demonstrating the following: (a) On a test-bed with a variety of Boolean function classes, we find that Transformers can nearly match the optimal learning algorithm for 'simpler' tasks, while their performance deteriorates on more 'complex' tasks. Additionally, we find that certain attention-free models perform (almost) identically to Transformers on a range of tasks. (b) When provided a \*teaching sequence\*, i.e. a set of examples that uniquely identifies a function in a class, we show that Transformers learn more sample-efficiently. Interestingly, our results show that Transformers can learn to implement \*two distinct\* algorithms to solve a \*single\* task, and can adaptively select the more sample-efficient algorithm depending on the sequence of in-context examples. (c) Lastly, we show that extant LLMs, e.g. LLaMA-2, GPT-4, can compete with nearest-neighbor baselines on prediction tasks that are guaranteed to not be in their training set. | Satwik Bhattamishra, Arkil Patel, Phil Blunsom, Varun Kanade |  |
| 200 |  |  [The mechanistic basis of data dependence and abrupt learning in an in-context classification task](https://openreview.net/forum?id=aN4Jf6Cx69) |  | 0 | Transformer models exhibit in-context learning: the ability to accurately predict the response to a novel query based on illustrative examples in the input sequence, which contrasts with traditional in-weights learning of query-output relationships. What aspects of the training data distribution and architecture favor in-context vs in-weights learning? Recent work has shown that specific distributional properties inherent in language, such as burstiness, large dictionaries and skewed rank-frequency distributions, control the trade-off or simultaneous appearance of these two forms of learning. We first show that these results are recapitulated in a minimal attention-only network trained on a simplified dataset. In-context learning (ICL) is driven by the abrupt emergence of an induction head, which subsequently competes with in-weights learning. By identifying progress measures that precede in-context learning and targeted experiments, we construct a two-parameter model of an induction head which emulates the full data distributional dependencies displayed by the attention-based network. A phenomenological model of induction head formation traces its abrupt emergence to the sequential learning of three nested logits enabled by an intrinsic curriculum. We propose that the sharp transitions in attention-based networks arise due to a specific chain of multi-layer operations necessary to achieve ICL, which is implemented by nested nonlinearities sequentially learned during training. | Gautam Reddy |  |

Current consistency models achieve optimal sample quality by distilling from pre-trained diffusion models and employing learned metrics such as LPIPS. However, distillation limits the quality of consistency models to that of the pre-trained diffusion model, and LPIPS causes undesirable bias in evaluation. To tackle these challenges, we present improved techniques for consistency training, where consistency models learn directly from data without distillation. We delve into the theory behind consistency training and identify a previously overlooked flaw, which we address by eliminating Exponential Moving Average from the teacher consistency model. To replace learned metrics like LPIPS, we adopt Pseudo-Huber losses from robust statistics. Additionally, we introduce a lognormal noise schedule for the consistency training objective, and propose to double total discretization steps every set number of training iterations. Combined with better hyperparameter tuning, these modifications enable consistency models to achieve FID scores of 2.51 and 3.25 on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet $64\times 64$ respectively in a single sampling step. These scores mark a 3.5$\times$ and 4$\times$ improvement compared to prior consistency training approaches. Through two-step sampling, we further reduce FID scores to 2.24 and 2.77 on these two datasets, surpassing those obtained via distillation in both one-step and two-step settings, while narrowing the gap between consistency models and other state-of-the-art generative models. | Yang Song, Prafulla Dhariwal |  |
| 202 |  |  [Provable Compositional Generalization for Object-Centric Learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=7VPTUWkiDQ) |  | 0 | Learning representations that generalize to novel compositions of known concepts is crucial for bridging the gap between human and machine perception. One prominent effort is learning object-centric representations, which are widely conjectured to enable compositional generalization. Yet, it remains unclear when this conjecture will be true, as a principled theoretical or empirical understanding of compositional generalization is lacking. In this work, we investigate when compositional generalization is guaranteed for object-centric representations through the lens of identifiability theory. We show that autoencoders that satisfy structural assumptions on the decoder and enforce encoder-decoder consistency will learn object-centric representations that provably generalize compositionally. We validate our theoretical result and highlight the practical relevance of our assumptions through experiments on synthetic image data. | Thaddäus Wiedemer, Jack Brady, Alexander Panfilov, Attila Juhos, Matthias Bethge, Wieland Brendel |  |

This is supported by trends in deep reinforcement learning (RL), where self-supervised auxiliary objectives such as prediction are widely used to support representation learning and improve task performance. Here, we study the effects predictive auxiliary objectives have on representation learning across different modules of an RL system and how these mimic representational changes observed in the brain. We find that predictive objectives improve and stabilize learning particularly in resource-limited architectures, and we identify settings where longer predictive horizons better support representational transfer. Furthermore, we find that representational changes in this RL system bear a striking resemblance to changes in neural activity observed in the brain across various experiments. Specifically, we draw a connection between the auxiliary predictive model of the RL system and hippocampus, an area thought to learn a predictive model to support memory-guided behavior. We also connect the encoder network and the value learning network of the RL system to visual cortex and striatum in the brain, respectively. This work demonstrates how representation learning in deep RL systems can provide an interpretable framework for modeling multi-region interactions in the brain. The deep RL perspective taken here also suggests an additional role of the hippocampus in the brain-- that of an auxiliary learning system that benefits representation learning in other regions. | Ching Fang, Kim Stachenfeld |  |

We present PTGM, a novel method that pre-trains goal-based models to augment RL by providing temporal abstractions and behavior regularization. PTGM involves pre-training a low-level, goal-conditioned policy and training a high-level policy to generate goals for subsequent RL tasks. To address the challenges posed by the high-dimensional goal space, while simultaneously maintaining the agent's capability to accomplish various skills, we propose clustering goals in the dataset to form a discrete high-level action space. Additionally, we introduce a pre-trained goal prior model to regularize the behavior of the high-level policy in RL, enhancing sample efficiency and learning stability. Experimental results in a robotic simulation environment and the challenging open-world environment of Minecraft demonstrate PTGM’s superiority in sample efficiency and task performance compared to baselines. Moreover, PTGM exemplifies enhanced interpretability and generalization of the acquired low-level skills. | Haoqi Yuan, Zhancun Mu, Feiyang Xie, Zongqing Lu |  |

Meta's open-source release of Llama models and OpenAI's APIs for fine-tuning GPT-3.5 Turbo on customized datasets accelerate this trend. But, what are the safety costs associated with such customized fine-tuning? While existing safety alignment techniques restrict harmful behaviors of LLMs at inference time, they do not cover safety risks when fine-tuning privileges are extended to end-users. Our red teaming studies find that the safety alignment of LLMs can be compromised by fine-tuning with only a few adversarially designed training examples. For instance, we jailbreak GPT-3.5 Turbo's safety guardrails by fine-tuning it on only 10 such examples at a cost of less than $0.20 via OpenAI's APIs, making the model responsive to nearly any harmful instructions. Disconcertingly, our research also reveals that, even without malicious intent, simply fine-tuning with benign and commonly used datasets can also inadvertently degrade the safety alignment of LLMs, though to a lesser extent. These findings suggest that fine-tuning aligned LLMs introduces new safety risks that current safety infrastructures fall short of addressing --- even if a model's initial safety alignment is impeccable, how can it be maintained after customized fine-tuning? We outline and critically analyze potential mitigations and advocate for further research efforts toward reinforcing safety protocols for the customized fine-tuning of aligned LLMs. (This paper contains red-teaming data and model-generated content that can be offensive in nature.) | Xiangyu Qi, Yi Zeng, Tinghao Xie, PinYu Chen, Ruoxi Jia, Prateek Mittal, Peter Henderson |  |
| 206 |  |  [Never Train from Scratch: Fair Comparison of Long-Sequence Models Requires Data-Driven Priors](https://openreview.net/forum?id=PdaPky8MUn) |  | 0 | Modeling long-range dependencies across sequences is a longstanding goal in machine learning and has led to architectures, such as state space models, that dramatically outperform Transformers on long sequences. However, these impressive empirical gains have been by and large demonstrated on benchmarks (e.g. Long Range Arena), where models are randomly initialized and trained to predict a target label from an input sequence. In this work, we show that random initialization leads to gross overestimation of the differences between architectures and that pretraining with standard denoising objectives, \*using only the downstream task data\*, leads to dramatic gains across multiple architectures and to very small gaps between Transformers and state space models (SSMs). In stark contrast to prior works, we find vanilla Transformers to match the performance of S4 on Long Range Arena when properly pretrained, and we improve the best reported results of SSMs on the PathX-256 task by 20 absolute points. Subsequently, we analyze the utility of previously-proposed structured parameterizations for SSMs and show they become mostly redundant in the presence of data-driven initialization obtained through pretraining. Our work shows that, when evaluating different architectures on supervised tasks, incorporation of data-driven priors via pretraining is essential for reliable performance estimation, and can be done efficiently. | Ido Amos, Jonathan Berant, Ankit Gupta |  |
| 207 |  |  [LoftQ: LoRA-Fine-Tuning-aware Quantization for Large Language Models](https://openreview.net/forum?id=LzPWWPAdY4) |  | 0 | Quantization is an indispensable technique for serving Large Language Models (LLMs) and has recently found its way into LoRA fine-tuning (Dettmers et al., 2023). In this work we focus on the scenario where quantization and LoRA fine- tuning are applied together on a pre-trained model. In such cases it is common to observe a consistent gap in the performance on downstream tasks between full fine-tuning and quantization plus LoRA fine-tuning approach. In response, we propose LoftQ (LoRA-Fine-Tuning-aware Quantization), a novel quantization framework that simultaneously quantizes an LLM and finds a proper low-rank initialization for LoRA fine-tuning. Such an initialization alleviates the discrep- ancy between the quantized and full-precision model and significantly improves the generalization in downstream tasks. We evaluate our method on natural lan- guage understanding, question answering, summarization, and natural language generation tasks. Experiments show that our method is highly effective and out- performs existing quantization methods, especially in the challenging 2-bit and 2/4-bit mixed precision regimes. We will release our code. | Yixiao Li, Yifan Yu, Chen Liang, Nikos Karampatziakis, Pengcheng He, Weizhu Chen, Tuo Zhao |  |

However, existing approaches either overlook the inherent permutation symmetry in the neural network or rely on intricate weight-sharing patterns to achieve equivariance, while ignoring the impact of the network architecture itself. In this work, we propose to represent neural networks as computational graphs of parameters, which allows us to harness powerful graph neural networks and transformers that preserve permutation symmetry. Consequently, our approach enables a single model to encode neural computational graphs with diverse architectures. We showcase the effectiveness of our method on a wide range of tasks, including classification and editing of implicit neural representations, predicting generalization performance, and learning to optimize, while consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

However, many studies show an attacker could carefully perturb the structure and/or node features in a graph such that a graph classifier misclassifies the perturbed graph. Such vulnerability impedes the deployment of graph classification in security/safety-critical applications. Existing empirical defenses lack formal robustness guarantees and could be broken by adaptive or unknown attacks. Existing provable defenses have the following limitations: 1) they achieve sub-optimal robustness guarantees for graph structure perturbation, 2) they cannot provide robustness guarantees for arbitrarily node feature perturbations, 3) their robustness guarantees are probabilistic, meaning they could be incorrect with a non-zero probability, and 4) they incur large computation costs. We aim to address those limitations in this work. We propose GNNCert, a certified defense against both graph structure and node feature perturbations for graph classification. Our GNNCert provably predicts the same label for a graph when the number of perturbed edges and the number of nodes with perturbed features are bounded. Our results on 8 benchmark datasets show that GNNCert outperforms three state-of-the-art methods. | Zaishuo Xia, Han Yang, Binghui Wang, Jinyuan Jia |  |

Existing MARL algorithms are effective but still require significant learning time and often get trapped in local optima by complex tasks, subsequently failing to discover a goal-reaching policy. To address this, we introduce Efficient episodic Memory Utilization (EMU) for MARL, with two primary objectives: (a) accelerating reinforcement learning by leveraging semantically coherent memory from an episodic buffer and (b) selectively promoting desirable transitions to prevent local convergence. To achieve (a), EMU incorporates a trainable encoder/decoder structure alongside MARL, creating coherent memory embeddings that facilitate exploratory memory recall. To achieve (b), EMU introduces a novel reward structure called episodic incentive based on the desirability of states. This reward improves the TD target in Q-learning and acts as an additional incentive for desirable transitions. We provide theoretical support for the proposed incentive and demonstrate the effectiveness of EMU compared to conventional episodic control. The proposed method is evaluated in StarCraft II and Google Research Football, and empirical results indicate further performance improvement over state-of-the-art methods. | Hyungho Na, Yunkyeong Seo, IlChul Moon |  |

Deep learning approaches, such as transformers, have recently challenged the simulation paradigm with complex network forecasts. However, they often act as data-driven black-box models that neglect the underlying physics and lack uncertainty quantification. We address these limitations with ClimODE, a spatiotemporal continuous-time process that implements a key principle of advection from statistical mechanics, namely, weather changes due to a spatial movement of quantities over time. ClimODE models precise weather evolution with value-conserving dynamics, learning global weather transport as a neural flow, which also enables estimating the uncertainty in predictions. Our approach outperforms existing data-driven methods in global and regional forecasting with an order of magnitude smaller parameterization, establishing a new state of the art. | Yogesh Verma, Markus Heinonen, Vikas Garg |  |

However, extending diffusion models to tabular data is challenging due to the intricately varied distributions and a blend of data types of tabular data. This paper introduces TabSyn, a methodology that synthesizes tabular data by leveraging a diffusion model within a variational autoencoder (VAE) crafted latent space. The key advantages of the proposed Tabsyn include (1) Generality: the ability to handle a broad spectrum of data types by converting them into a single unified space and explicitly capturing inter-column relations; (2) Quality: optimizing the distribution of latent embeddings to enhance the subsequent training of diffusion models, which helps generate high-quality synthetic data; (3) Speed: much fewer number of reverse steps and faster synthesis speed than existing diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments on six datasets with five metrics demonstrate that Tabsyn outperforms existing methods. Specifically, it reduces the error rates by 86% and 67% for column-wise distribution and pair-wise column correlation estimations compared with the most competitive baselines.

| 213 |  |  [Phenomenal Yet Puzzling: Testing Inductive Reasoning Capabilities of Language Models with Hypothesis Refinement](https://openreview.net/forum?id=bNt7oajl2a) |  | 0 | The ability to derive underlying principles from a handful of observations and then generalize to novel situations---known as inductive reasoning---is central to human intelligence. Prior work suggests that language models (LMs) often fall short on inductive reasoning, despite achieving impressive success on research benchmarks. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of the inductive reasoning capabilities of LMs through $\textit{iterative hypothesis refinement}$, a technique that more closely mirrors the human inductive process than standard input-output prompting. Iterative hypothesis refinement employs a three-step process: proposing, selecting, and refining hypotheses in the form of textual rules. By examining the intermediate rules, we observe that LMs are phenomenal $\textit{hypothesis proposers}$ (i.e., generating candidate rules), and when coupled with a (task-specific) symbolic interpreter that is able to systematically filter the proposed set of rules, this hybrid approach achieves strong results across inductive reasoning benchmarks that require inducing causal relations, language-like instructions, and symbolic concepts. However, they also behave as puzzling $\textit{inductive reasoners}$, showing notable performance gaps between rule induction (i.e., identifying plausible rules) and rule application (i.e., applying proposed rules to instances), suggesting that LMs are proposing hypotheses without being able to actually apply the rules. Through empirical and human analyses, we further reveal several discrepancies between the inductive reasoning processes of LMs and humans, shedding light on both the potentials and limitations of using LMs in inductive reasoning tasks. | Linlu Qiu, Liwei Jiang, Ximing Lu, Melanie Sclar, Valentina Pyatkin, Chandra Bhagavatula, Bailin Wang, Yoon Kim, Yejin Choi, Nouha Dziri, Xiang Ren |  |

So far, GNN expressiveness has been primarily assessed via the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) hierarchy. However, such an expressivity measure has notable limitations: it is inherently coarse, qualitative, and may not well reflect practical requirements (e.g., the ability to encode substructures). In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for quantitatively studying the expressiveness of GNN architectures, addressing all the above limitations. Specifically, we identify a fundamental expressivity measure termed homomorphism expressivity, which quantifies the ability of GNN models to count graphs under homomorphism. Homomorphism expressivity offers a complete and practical assessment tool: the completeness enables direct expressivity comparisons between GNN models, while the practicality allows for understanding concrete GNN abilities such as subgraph counting. By examining four classes of prominent GNNs as case studies, we derive simple, unified, and elegant descriptions of their homomorphism expressivity for both invariant and equivariant settings. Our results provide novel insights into a series of previous work, unify the landscape of different subareas in the community, and settle several open questions. Empirically, extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world tasks verify our theory, showing that the practical performance of GNN models aligns well with the proposed metric. | Bohang Zhang, Jingchu Gai, Yiheng Du, Qiwei Ye, Di He, Liwei Wang |  |

To bridge this gap, we present MathVista, a benchmark designed to combine challenges from diverse mathematical and visual tasks. It consists of 6,141 examples, derived from 28 existing multimodal datasets involving mathematics and 3 newly created datasets (i.e., IQTest, FunctionQA, and PaperQA). Completing these tasks requires fine-grained, deep visual understanding and compositional reasoning, which all state-of-the-art foundation models find challenging. With MathVista, we have conducted a comprehensive, quantitative evaluation of 12 prominent foundation models. The best-performing GPT-4V model achieves an overall accuracy of 49.9%, substantially outperforming Bard, the second-best performer, by 15.1%. Our in-depth analysis reveals that the superiority of GPT-4V is mainly attributed to its enhanced visual perception and mathematical reasoning. However, GPT-4V still falls short of human performance by 10.4%, as it often struggles to understand complex figures and perform rigorous reasoning. This significant gap underscores the critical role that MathVista will play in the development of general-purpose AI agents capable of tackling mathematically intensive and visually rich real-world tasks. We further explore the new ability of self-verification, the application of self-consistency, and the interactive chatbot capabilities of GPT-4V, highlighting its promising potential for future research.

Our $\textit{Discrete Walk-Jump Sampling}$ formalism combines the contrastive divergence training of an energy-based model and improved sample quality of a score-based model, while simplifying training and sampling by requiring only a single noise level. We evaluate the robustness of our approach on generative modeling of antibody proteins and introduce the $\textit{distributional conformity score}$ to benchmark protein generative models. By optimizing and sampling from our models for the proposed distributional conformity score, 97-100\% of generated samples are successfully expressed and purified and 70\% of functional designs show equal or improved binding affinity compared to known functional antibodies on the first attempt in a single round of laboratory experiments. We also report the first demonstration of long-run fast-mixing MCMC chains where diverse antibody protein classes are visited in a single MCMC chain. | Nathan C.

While it is difficult to measure whether neural program synthesis methods have similar capabilities, we can measure whether they compositionally generalize, that is, whether a model that has been trained on the simpler subtasks is subsequently able to solve more complex tasks. In this paper, we characterize several different forms of compositional generalization that are desirable in program synthesis, forming a meta-benchmark which we use to create generalization tasks for two popular datasets, RobustFill and DeepCoder. We then propose ExeDec, a novel decomposition-based synthesis strategy that predicts execution subgoals to solve problems step-by-step informed by program execution at each step. When used with Transformer models trained from scratch, ExeDec has better synthesis performance and greatly improved compositional generalization ability compared to baselines. Finally, we use our benchmarks to demonstrate that LLMs struggle to compositionally generalize when asked to do programming-by-example in a few-shot setting, but an ExeDec-style prompting approach can improve the generalization ability and overall performance. | Kensen Shi, Joey Hong, Yinlin Deng, Pengcheng Yin, Manzil Zaheer, Charles Sutton |  |

While \lora/ offers numerous advantages, its applicability for real-time serving to a diverse and global user base is constrained by its incapability to handle multiple task-specific adapters efficiently. This imposes a performance bottleneck in scenarios requiring personalized, task-specific adaptations for each incoming request. To address this, we introduce FLoRA (Fast LoRA), a framework in which each input example in a minibatch can be associated with its unique low-rank adaptation weights, allowing for efficient batching of heterogeneous requests. We empirically demonstrate that \flora/ retains the performance merits of \lora/, showcasing competitive results on the MultiPL-E code generation benchmark spanning over 8 languages and a multilingual speech recognition task across 6 languages. | Yeming Wen, Swarat Chaudhuri |  |

In particular, we propose an easily implemented method based on the \emph{pivotal sampling algorithm}, which we test on problems motivated by learning-based methods for parametric PDEs and uncertainty quantification. In comparison to independent sampling, our method reduces the number of samples needed to reach a given target accuracy by up to $50\%$. We support our findings with two theoretical results. First, we show that any non-independent leverage score sampling method that obeys a weak \emph{one-sided $\ell_{\infty}$ independence condition} (which includes pivotal sampling) can actively learn $d$ dimensional linear functions with $O(d\log d)$ samples, matching independent sampling. This result extends recent work on matrix Chernoff bounds under $\ell_{\infty}$ independence, and may be of interest for analyzing other sampling strategies beyond pivotal sampling. Second, we show that, for the important case of polynomial regression, our pivotal method obtains an improved bound of $O(d)$ samples. | Atsushi Shimizu, Xiaoou Cheng, Christopher Musco, Jonathan Weare |  |

Different from the conventional KV cache that retains key and value vectors for all context tokens, we conduct targeted profiling to discern the intrinsic structure of attention modules. Based on the recognized structure, we then construct the KV cache in an adaptive manner: evicting long-range contexts on attention heads emphasizing local contexts, discarding non-special tokens on attention heads centered on special tokens, and only employing the standard KV cache for attention heads that broadly attend to all tokens. Moreover, with the lightweight attention profiling used to guide the construction of the adaptive KV cache, FastGen can be deployed without resource-intensive fine-tuning or re-training. In our experiments across various asks, FastGen demonstrates substantial reduction on GPU memory consumption with negligible generation quality loss. We will release our code and the compatible CUDA kernel for reproducibility. | Suyu Ge, Yunan Zhang, Liyuan Liu, Minjia Zhang, Jiawei Han, Jianfeng Gao |  |

However, existing privacy auditing techniques usually make strong assumptions on the adversary (e.g., knowledge of intermediate model iterates or the training data distribution), are tailored to specific tasks, model architectures, or DP algorithm, and/or require retraining the model many times (typically on the order of thousands). These shortcomings make deploying such techniques at scale difficult in practice, especially in federated settings where model training can take days or weeks. In this work, we present a novel “one-shot” approach that can systematically address these challenges, allowing efficient auditing or estimation of the privacy loss of a model during the same, single training run used to fit model parameters, and without requiring any a priori knowledge about the model architecture, task, or DP algorithm. We show that our method provides provably correct estimates for the privacy loss under the Gaussian mechanism, and we demonstrate its performance on a well-established FL benchmark dataset under several adversarial threat models. | Galen Andrew, Peter Kairouz, Sewoong Oh, Alina Oprea, Hugh Brendan McMahan, Vinith Menon Suriyakumar |  |

We find real-world software engineering to be a rich, sustainable, and challenging testbed for evaluating the next generation of language models. To this end, we introduce SWE-bench, an evaluation framework consisting of 2,294 software engineering problems drawn from real GitHub issues and corresponding pull requests across 12 popular Python repositories. Given a codebase along with a description of an issue to be resolved, a language model is tasked with editing the codebase to address the issue. Resolving issues in SWE-bench frequently requires understanding and coordinating changes across multiple functions, classes, and even files simultaneously, calling for models to interact with execution environments, process extremely long contexts and perform complex reasoning that goes far beyond traditional code generation tasks. Our evaluations show that both state-of-the-art proprietary models and our fine-tuned model SWE-Llama can resolve only the simplest issues. The best-performing model, Claude 2, is able to solve a mere 1.96% of the issues. Advances on SWE-bench represent steps towards LMs that are more practical, intelligent, and autonomous. | Carlos E.

However, their demanding computation during inference has raised significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. Despite recent trends favoring alternative activation functions such as GELU or SiLU, known for increased computation, this study strongly advocates for reinstating ReLU activation in LLMs. We demonstrate that using the ReLU activation function has a negligible impact on convergence and performance while significantly reducing computation and weight transfer. This reduction is particularly valuable during the memory-bound inference step, where efficiency is paramount. Exploring sparsity patterns in ReLU-based LLMs, we unveil the reutilization of activated neurons for generating new tokens and leveraging these insights, we propose practical strategies to substantially reduce LLM inference computation up to three times, using ReLU activations with minimal performance trade-offs. | Iman Mirzadeh, Keivan AlizadehVahid, Sachin Mehta, Oncel Tuzel, Golnoosh Samei, Mohammad Rastegari, Mehrdad Farajtabar |  |

To address this gap, we introduce a new tool, the interaction tensor, for empirically analyzing the interaction between data and model through features. With the interaction tensor, we make several key observations about how features are distributed in data and how models with different random seeds learn different features. Based on these observations, we propose a conceptual framework for feature learning. Under this framework, the expected accuracy for a single hypothesis and agreement for a pair of hypotheses can both be derived in closed form. We demonstrate that the proposed framework can explain empirically observed phenomena, including the recently discovered Generalization Disagreement Equality (GDE) that allows for estimating the generalization error with only unlabeled data. Further, our theory also provides explicit construction of natural data distributions that break the GDE. Thus, we believe this work provides valuable new insight into our understanding of feature learning. | Yiding Jiang, Christina Baek, J. Zico Kolter |  |

However, the computational demands of classical algorithms for computing TDA are exorbitant, and quickly become impractical for high-order characteristics. Quantum computers offer the potential of achieving significant speedup for certain computational problems. Indeed, TDA has been purported to be one such problem, yet, quantum computing algorithms proposed for the problem, such as the original Quantum TDA (QTDA) formulation by Lloyd, Garnerone and Zanardi, require fault-tolerance qualifications that are currently unavailable. In this study, we present NISQ-TDA, a fully implemented end-to-end quantum machine learning algorithm needing only a short circuit-depth, that is applicable to high-dimensional classical data, and with provable asymptotic speedup for certain classes of problems. The algorithm neither suffers from the data-loading problem nor does it need to store the input data on the quantum computer explicitly. The algorithm was successfully executed on quantum computing devices, as well as on noisy quantum simulators, applied to small datasets. Preliminary empirical results suggest that the algorithm is robust to noise. | Ismail Yunus Akhalwaya, Shashanka Ubaru, Kenneth L. Clarkson, Mark S.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), an ad hoc approach that augments LMs with retrieval of relevant knowledge, decreases such issues. However, indiscriminately retrieving and incorporating a fixed number of retrieved passages, regardless of whether retrieval is necessary, or passages are relevant, diminishes LM versatility or can lead to unhelpful response generation. We introduce a new framework called \*\*Self-Reflective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Self-RAG)\*\* that enhances an LM's quality and factuality through retrieval and self-reflection. Our framework trains a single arbitrary LM that adaptively retrieves passages on-demand, and generates and reflects on retrieved passages and its generations using special tokens, called {\it reflection} tokens. Generating reflection tokens makes the LM controllable during the inference phase, enabling it to tailor its behavior to diverse task requirements. Experiments show that Self-RAG (7B and 13B parameters) significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs and retrieval-augmented models on a diverse set of tasks. Specifically, Self-RAG outperforms ChatGPT and retrieval-augmented Llama2-chat on Open-domain QA, reasoning, and fact verification tasks, and it shows significant gains in improving factuality and citation accuracy for long-form generations relative to these models.

Enhancing Model Performance and Interpretability through Influence-Based Data Selection](https://openreview.net/forum?id=HE9eUQlAvo) |  | 0 | Classification models are ubiquitously deployed in society and necessitate high utility, fairness, and robustness performance. Current research efforts mainly focus on improving model architectures and learning algorithms on fixed datasets to achieve this goal. In contrast, in this paper, we address an orthogonal yet crucial problem: given a fixed convex learning model (or a convex surrogate for a non-convex model) and a function of interest, we assess what data benefits the model by interpreting the feature space, and then aim to improve performance as measured by this function. To this end, we propose the use of influence estimation models for interpreting the classifier's performance from the perspective of the data feature space. Additionally, we propose data selection approaches based on influence that enhance model utility, fairness, and robustness. Through extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we validate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches not only for conventional classification scenarios, but also under more challenging scenarios such as distribution shifts, fairness poisoning attacks, utility evasion attacks, online learning, and active learning. | Anshuman Chhabra, Peizhao Li, Prasant Mohapatra, Hongfu Liu |  |

DMs work by constructing a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) in the input space (ie, position space), and using a neural network to reverse it. In this work, we introduce a novel generative modeling framework grounded in \textbf{phase space dynamics}, where a phase space is defined as {an augmented space encompassing both position and velocity.} Leveraging insights from Stochastic Optimal Control, we construct a path measure in the phase space that enables efficient sampling. {In contrast to DMs, our framework demonstrates the capability to generate realistic data points at an early stage of dynamics propagation.} This early prediction sets the stage for efficient data generation by leveraging additional velocity information along the trajectory. On standard image generation benchmarks, our model yields favorable performance over baselines in the regime of small Number of Function Evaluations (NFEs). Furthermore, our approach rivals the performance of diffusion models equipped with efficient sampling techniques, underscoring its potential as a new tool generative modeling. | Tianrong Chen, Jiatao Gu, Laurent Dinh, Evangelos A.

It adds convolution modules to a transformer to learn both local and global dependencies. In this work we describe a faster, more memory-efficient, and better-performing transformer, called Zipformer. Modeling changes include: 1) a U-Net-like encoder structure where middle stacks operate at lower frame rates; 2) reorganized block structure with more modules, within which we re-use attention weights for efficiency; 3) a modified form of LayerNorm called BiasNorm allows us to retain some length information; 4) new activation functions SwooshR and SwooshL work better than Swish. We also propose a new optimizer, called ScaledAdam, which scales the update by each tensor's current scale to keep the relative change about the same, and also explictly learns the parameter scale. It achieves faster converge and better performance than Adam. Extensive experiments on LibriSpeech, Aishell-1, and WenetSpeech datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Zipformer over other state-of-the-art ASR models.

Previous LLM-based multi-agent systems can already solve simple dialogue tasks. More complex tasks, however, face challenges through logic inconsistencies due to cascading hallucinations caused by naively chaining LLMs. Here we introduce MetaGPT, an innovative meta-programming framework incorporating efficient human workflows into LLM-based multi-agent collaborations. MetaGPT encodes Standardized Operating Procedures (SOPs) into prompt sequences for more streamlined workflows, thus allowing agents with human-like domain expertise to verify intermediate results and reduce errors. MetaGPT utilizes an assembly line paradigm to assign diverse roles to various agents, efficiently breaking down complex tasks into subtasks involving many agents working together. On collaborative software engineering benchmarks, MetaGPT generates more coherent solutions than previous chat-based multi-agent systems. | Sirui Hong, Mingchen Zhuge, Jonathan Chen, Xiawu Zheng, Yuheng Cheng, Jinlin Wang, Ceyao Zhang, Zili Wang, Steven Ka Shing Yau, Zijuan Lin, Liyang Zhou, Chenyu Ran, Lingfeng Xiao, Chenglin Wu, Jürgen Schmidhuber |  |

While various studies exist claiming methodological advances on the one hand, and successful application on the other hand, the field is currently hampered by a gap between theory and practice leaving fundamental questions unanswered: Can data-related and model-related uncertainty really be separated in practice? Which components of an uncertainty method are essential for real-world performance? Which uncertainty method works well for which application? In this work, we link this research gap to a lack of systematic and comprehensive evaluation of uncertainty methods. Specifically, we identify three key pitfalls in current literature and present an evaluation framework that bridges the research gap by providing 1) a controlled environment for studying data ambiguities as well as distribution shifts, 2) systematic ablations of relevant method components, and 3) test-beds for the five predominant uncertainty applications: OoD-detection, active learning, failure detection, calibration, and ambiguity modeling. Empirical results on simulated as well as real-world data demonstrate how the proposed framework is able to answer the predominant questions in the field revealing for instance that 1) separation of uncertainty types works on simulated data but does not necessarily translate to real-world data, 2) aggregation of scores is a crucial but currently neglected component of uncertainty methods, 3) While ensembles are performing most robustly across the different downstream tasks and settings, test-time augmentation often constitutes a light-weight alternative.

Without interventions, these biases could propagate a skewed worldview and restrict opportunities for minority groups. In this work, we frame fairness as a distributional alignment problem. Our solution consists of two main technical contributions: (1) a distributional alignment loss that steers specific characteristics of the generated images towards a user-defined target distribution, and (2) adjusted direct finetuning of diffusion model's sampling process (adjusted DFT), which leverages an adjusted gradient to directly optimize losses defined on the generated images. Empirically, our method markedly reduces gender, racial, and their intersectional biases for occupational prompts. Gender bias is significantly reduced even when finetuning just five soft tokens. Crucially, our method supports diverse perspectives of fairness beyond absolute equality, which is demonstrated by controlling age to a 75% young and 25% old distribution while simultaneously debiasing gender and race. Finally, our method is scalable: it can debias multiple concepts at once by simply including these prompts in the finetuning data. We share code and various fair diffusion model adaptors at https://sail-sg.github.io/finetune-fair-diffusion/. | Xudong Shen, Chao Du, Tianyu Pang, Min Lin, Yongkang Wong, Mohan S. Kankanhalli |  |

As they are increasingly adopted for knowledge-intensive tasks, it becomes evident that these design choices lead to failures to generate factual, relevant, and up-to-date knowledge. To this end, we propose Knowledge Card, a modular framework to plug in new factual and relevant knowledge into general-purpose LLMs. We first introduce knowledge cards---specialized language models trained on corpora from specific domains and sources. Knowledge cards serve as parametric repositories that are selected at inference time to generate background knowledge for the base LLM. We then propose three content selectors to dynamically select and retain information in documents generated by knowledge cards, specifically controlling for relevance, brevity, and factuality of outputs. Finally, we propose two complementary integration approaches to augment the base LLM with the (relevant, factual) knowledge curated from the specialized LMs. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Knowledge Card achieves state-of-the-art performance on six benchmark datasets. Ultimately, Knowledge Card framework enables dynamic synthesis and updates of knowledge from diverse domains. Its modularity will ensure that relevant knowledge can be continuously updated through the collective efforts of the research community. | Shangbin Feng, Weijia Shi, Yuyang Bai, Vidhisha Balachandran, Tianxing He, Yulia Tsvetkov |  |

Likewise, unsupervised reinforcement learning (RL) holds the promise of discovering a variety of potentially useful behaviors that can accelerate the learning of a wide array of downstream tasks. Previous unsupervised RL approaches have mainly focused on pure exploration and mutual information skill learning. However, despite the previous attempts, making unsupervised RL truly scalable still remains a major open challenge: pure exploration approaches might struggle in complex environments with large state spaces, where covering every possible transition is infeasible, and mutual information skill learning approaches might completely fail to explore the environment due to the lack of incentives. To make unsupervised RL scalable to complex, high-dimensional environments, we propose a novel unsupervised RL objective, which we call Metric-Aware Abstraction (METRA). Our main idea is, instead of directly covering the entire state space, to only cover a compact latent space $\mathcal{Z}$ that is metrically connected to the state space $\mathcal{S}$ by temporal distances. By learning to move in every direction in the latent space, METRA obtains a tractable set of diverse behaviors that approximately cover the state space, being scalable to high-dimensional environments. Through our experiments in five locomotion and manipulation environments, we demonstrate that METRA can discover a variety of useful behaviors even in complex, pixel-based environments, being the first unsupervised RL method that discovers diverse locomotion behaviors in pixel-based Quadruped and Humanoid.

Recent theoretical studies have revealed that these methods all boil down to relying on the Hessian matrix approximation of model weights. However, these methods suffer from suboptimal trade-offs between knowledge transfer and forgetting due to fixed and unchanging Hessian estimations during training. Another seemingly parallel strand of Meta-Continual Learning (Meta-CL) algorithms enforces alignment between gradients of previous tasks and that of the current task. In this work we revisit Meta-CL and for the first time bridge it with regularization-based methods. Concretely, Meta-CL implicitly approximates Hessian in an online manner, which enjoys the benefits of timely adaptation but meantime suffers from high variance induced by random memory buffer sampling. We are thus highly motivated to combine the best of both worlds, through the proposal of Variance Reduced Meta-CL (VR-MCL) to achieve both timely and accurate Hessian approximation. Through comprehensive experiments across three datasets and various settings, we consistently observe that VR-MCL outperforms other SOTA methods, which further validates the effectiveness of VR-MCL. | Yichen Wu, LongKai Huang, Renzhen Wang, Deyu Meng, Ying Wei |  |

Parameter space symmetries are loss-invariant transformations that change the model parameters. Teleportation applies such transformations to accelerate optimization. However, the exact mechanism behind this algorithm's success is not well understood. In this paper, we show that teleportation not only speeds up optimization in the short-term, but gives overall faster time to convergence. Additionally, teleporting to minima with different curvatures improves generalization, which suggests a connection between the curvature of the minimum and generalization ability. Finally, we show that integrating teleportation into a wide range of optimization algorithms and optimization-based meta-learning improves convergence. Our results showcase the versatility of teleportation and demonstrate the potential of incorporating symmetry in optimization. | Bo Zhao, Robert M. Gower, Robin Walters, Rose Yu |  |

Existing methods for generative modeling on manifolds either require expensive simulation, are inherently unable to scale to high dimensions, or use approximations for limiting quantities that result in biased training objectives. Riemannian Flow Matching bypasses these limitations and offers several advantages over previous approaches: it is simulation-free on simple geometries, does not require divergence computation, and computes its target vector field in closed-form. The key ingredient behind RFM is the construction of a relatively simple premetric for defining target vector fields, which encompasses the existing Euclidean case. To extend to general geometries, we rely on the use of spectral decompositions to efficiently compute premetrics on the fly. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world non-Euclidean datasets, and we demonstrate tractable training on general geometries, including triangular meshes with highly non-trivial curvature and boundaries. | Ricky T.

| 238 |  |  [Ghost on the Shell: An Expressive Representation of General 3D Shapes](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Ad87VjRqUw) |  | 0 | The creation of photorealistic virtual worlds requires the accurate modeling of 3D surface geometry for a wide range of objects. For this, meshes are appealing since they enable 1) fast physics-based rendering with realistic material and lighting, 2) physical simulation, and 3) are memory-efficient for modern graphics pipelines. Recent work on reconstructing and statistically modeling 3D shape, however, has critiqued meshes as being topologically inflexible. To capture a wide range of object shapes, any 3D representation must be able to model solid, watertight, shapes as well as thin, open, surfaces. Recent work has focused on the former, and methods for reconstructing open surfaces do not support fast reconstruction with material and lighting or unconditional generative modelling. Inspired by the observation that open surfaces can be seen as islands floating on watertight surfaces, we parametrize open surfaces by defining a manifold signed distance field on watertight templates. With this parametrization, we further develop a grid-based and differentiable representation that parametrizes both watertight and non-watertight meshes of arbitrary topology. Our new representation, called Ghost-on-the-Shell (G-Shell), enables two important applications: differentiable rasterization-based reconstruction from multiview images and generative modelling of non-watertight meshes. We empirically demonstrate that G-Shell achieves state-of-the-art performance on non-watertight mesh reconstruction and generation tasks, while also performing effectively for watertight meshes. | Zhen Liu, Yao Feng, Yuliang Xiu, Weiyang Liu, Liam Paull, Michael J.

A key contribution of our work is to develop a latent diffusion technique in which we learn a detailed but extremely compact semantic image representation used to guide the diffusion process. This highly compressed representation of an image provides much more detailed guidance compared to latent representations of language and this significantly reduces the computational requirements to achieve state-of-the-art results. Our approach also improves the quality of text-conditioned image generation based on our user preference study. The training requirements of our approach consists of 24,602 A100-GPU hours - compared to Stable Diffusion 2.1's 200,000 GPU hours. Our approach also requires less training data to achieve these results. Furthermore, our compact latent representations allows us to perform inference over twice as fast, slashing the usual costs and carbon footprint of a state-of-the-art (SOTA) diffusion model significantly, without compromising the end performance. In a broader comparison against SOTA models our approach is substantially more efficient and compares favourably in terms of image quality. We believe that this work motivates more emphasis on the prioritization of both performance and computational accessibility. | Pablo Pernias, Dominic Rampas, Mats L.

This work introduces Geometric Bayesian Flow Networks (GeoBFN), which naturally fits molecule geometry by modeling diverse modalities in the differentiable parameter space of distributions. GeoBFN maintains the SE-(3) invariant density modeling property by incorporating equivariant inter-dependency modeling on parameters of distributions and unifying the probabilistic modeling of different modalities. Through optimized training and sampling techniques, we demonstrate that GeoBFN achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple 3D molecule generation benchmarks in terms of generation quality (90.87\% molecule stability in QM9 and 85.6\% atom stability in GEOM-DRUG\footnote{The scores are reported at 1k sampling steps for fair comparison, and our scores could be further improved if sampling sufficiently longer steps.}). GeoBFN can also conduct sampling with any number of steps to reach an optimal trade-off between efficiency and quality (\textit{e.g.}, 20$\times$ speedup without sacrificing performance). | Yuxuan Song, Jingjing Gong, Hao Zhou, Mingyue Zheng, Jingjing Liu, WeiYing Ma |  |

Although the causes of such instabilities are of scientific interest, the amount of resources required to reproduce them has made investigation difficult. In this work, we seek ways to reproduce and study training instability at smaller scales. First, we focus on two sources of training instability described in previous work: the growth of logits in attention layers (Dehghani et al., 2023) and divergence of the output logits from the log probabilities (Chowdhery et al., 2022). By measuring the relationship between learning rate and loss across scales, we show that these instabilities also appear in small models when training at high learning rates, and that mitigations previously employed at large scales are equally effective in this regime. This prompts us to investigate the extent to which other known optimizer and model interventions influence the sensitivity of the final loss to changes in the learning rate. To this end, we study methods such as warm-up, weight decay, and the MuParam (Yang et al., 2022), and combine techniques to train small models that achieve similar losses across orders of magnitude of learning rate variation. Finally, to conclude our exploration we study two cases where instabilities can be predicted before they emerge by examining the scaling behavior of model characteristics such as activation and gradient norms. | Mitchell Wortsman, Peter J.

During the diffusion process, however, the reliance on rudimentary noise sampling techniques that do not preserve correlations present in subsequent frames of a video is detrimental to the quality of the results. This either produces high-frequency flickering, or texture-sticking artifacts that are not amenable to post-processing. With this in mind, we propose a novel method for preserving temporal correlations in a sequence of noise samples. This approach is materialized by a novel noise representation, dubbed $\int$-noise (integral noise), that reinterprets individual noise samples as a continuously integrated noise field: pixel values do not represent discrete values, but are rather the integral of an underlying infinite-resolution noise over the pixel area. Additionally, we propose a carefully tailored transport method that uses $\int$-noise to accurately advect noise samples over a sequence of frames, maximizing the correlation between different frames while also preserving the noise properties. Our results demonstrate that the proposed $\int$-noise can be used for a variety of tasks, such as video restoration, surrogate rendering, and conditional video generation. | Pascal Chang, Jingwei Tang, Markus Gross, Vinicius C.

In this paper, we identify and characterize artifacts in feature maps of both supervised and self-supervised ViT networks. The artifacts correspond to high-norm tokens appearing during inference primarily in low-informative background areas of images, that are repurposed for internal computations. We propose a simple yet effective solution based on providing additional tokens to the input sequence of the Vision Transformer to fill that role. We show that this solution fixes that problem entirely for both supervised and self-supervised models, sets a new state of the art for self-supervised visual models on dense visual prediction tasks, enables object discovery methods with larger models, and most importantly leads to smoother feature maps and attention maps for downstream visual processing. | Timothée Darcet, Maxime Oquab, Julien Mairal, Piotr Bojanowski |  |

Therefore, recent end-to-end frameworks increase the convergence basin of the learned feature descriptors with special training objectives, such as the Gauss-Newton loss. However, the training data may exhibit bias toward a specific type of motion and pose initialization, thus limiting the generalization of these methods. In this work, we derive a closed-form solution to the expected optimum of the Gauss-Newton loss. The solution is agnostic to the underlying feature representation and allows us to dynamically adjust the basin of convergence according to our assumptions about the uncertainty in the current estimates. These properties allow for effective control over the convergence in the alignment process. Despite using self-supervised feature embeddings, our solution achieves compelling accuracy w.r.t. the state-of-the-art direct image alignment methods trained end-to-end with pose supervision, and demonstrates improved robustness to pose initialization. Our analytical solution exposes some inherent limitations of end-to-end learning with the Gauss-Newton loss, and establishes an intriguing connection between direct image alignment and feature-matching approaches. | Sergei Solonets, Daniil Sinitsyn, Lukas von Stumberg, Nikita Araslanov, Daniel Cremers |  |

In particular, we focus on improving GFlowNet with partial inference: training flow functions with the evaluation of the intermediate states or transitions. To this end, the recently developed forward-looking GFlowNet reparameterizes the flow functions based on evaluating the energy of intermediate states. However, such an evaluation of intermediate energies may (i) be too expensive or impossible to evaluate and (ii) even provide misleading training signals under large energy fluctuations along the sequence of actions. To resolve this issue, we propose learning energy decompositions for GFlowNets (LED-GFN). Our main idea is to (i) decompose the energy of an object into learnable potential functions defined on state transitions and (ii) reparameterize the flow functions using the potential functions. In particular, to produce informative local credits, we propose to regularize the potential to change smoothly over the sequence of actions. It is also noteworthy that training GFlowNet with our learned potential can preserve the optimal policy. We empirically verify the superiority of LED-GFN in five problems including the generation of unstructured and maximum independent sets, molecular graphs, and RNA sequences. | Hyosoon Jang, Minsu Kim, Sungsoo Ahn |  |

Alongside the classic total inference tasks (i.e., generating a mixture, separating the sources), we also introduce and experiment on the partial generation task of source imputation, where we generate a subset of the sources given the others (e.g., play a piano track that goes well with the drums). Additionally, we introduce a novel inference method for the separation task based on Dirac likelihood functions. We train our model on Slakh2100, a standard dataset for musical source separation, provide qualitative results in the generation settings, and showcase competitive quantitative results in the source separation setting. Our method is the first example of a single model that can handle both generation and separation tasks, thus representing a step toward general audio models. | Giorgio Mariani, Irene Tallini, Emilian Postolache, Michele Mancusi, Luca Cosmo, Emanuele Rodolà |  |

Prior methods using language models have demonstrated promising results, but they still struggle to prove even middle school level theorems. One common limitation of these methods is that they assume a fixed theorem library during the whole theorem proving process. However, as we all know, creating new useful theorems or even new theories is not only helpful but crucial and necessary for advancing mathematics and proving harder and deeper results. In this work, we present LEGO-Prover, which employs a growing skill library containing verified lemmas as skills to augment the capability of LLMs used in theorem proving. By constructing the proof modularly, LEGO-Prover enables LLMs to utilize existing skills retrieved from the library and to create new skills during the proving process. These skills are further evolved (by prompting an LLM) to enrich the library on another scale. Modular and reusable skills are constantly added to the library to enable tackling increasingly intricate mathematical problems. Moreover, the learned library further bridges the gap between human proofs and formal proofs by making it easier to impute missing steps. LEGO-Prover advances the state-of-the-art pass rate on miniF2F-valid (48.0\% to 57.0\%) and miniF2F-test (45.5\% to 50.0\%). During the proving process, LEGO-Prover also generates over 20,000 skills (theorems/lemmas) and adds them to the growing library. Our ablation study indicates that these newly added skills are indeed helpful for proving theorems, resulting in a 4.9\% improvement in success rate | Haiming Wang, Huajian Xin, Chuanyang Zheng, Zhengying Liu, Qingxing Cao, Yinya Huang, Jing Xiong, Han Shi, Enze Xie, Jian Yin, Zhenguo Li, Xiaodan Liang |  |
| 249 |  |  [ASID: Active Exploration for System Identification in Robotic Manipulation](https://openreview.net/forum?id=jNR6s6OSBT) |  | 0 | Model-free control strategies such as reinforcement learning have shown the ability to learn control strategies without requiring an accurate model or simulator of the world. While this is appealing due to the lack of modeling requirements, such methods can be sample inefficient, making them impractical in many real-world domains. On the other hand, model-based control techniques leveraging accurate simulators can circumvent these challenges and use a large amount of cheap simulation data to learn controllers that can effectively transfer to the real world. The challenge with such model-based techniques is the requirement for an extremely accurate simulation, requiring both the specification of appropriate simulation assets and physical parameters. This requires considerable human effort to design for every environment being considered. In this work, we propose a learning system that can leverage a small amount of real-world data to autonomously refine a simulation model and then plan an accurate control strategy that can be deployed in the real world. Our approach critically relies on utilizing an initial (possibly inaccurate) simulator to design effective exploration policies that, when deployed in the real world, collect high-quality data. We demonstrate the efficacy of this paradigm in identifying articulation, mass, and other physical parameters in several challenging robotic manipulation tasks, and illustrate that only a small amount of real-world data can allow for effective sim-to-real transfer. | Marius Memmel, Andrew Wagenmaker, Chuning Zhu, Dieter Fox, Abhishek Gupta |  |
| 250 |  |  [Towards a statistical theory of data selection under weak supervision](https://openreview.net/forum?id=HhfcNgQn6p) |  | 0 | Given a sample of size $N$, it is often useful to select a subsample of smaller size $n<N$ to be used for statistical estimation or learning. Such a data selection step is useful to reduce the requirements of data labeling and the computational complexity of learning. We assume to be given $N$ unlabeled samples $x_{i}$, and to be given access to a 'surrogate model' that can predict labels $y_i$ better than random guessing. Our goal is to select a subset of the samples, to be denoted by {$x_{i}$}$_{i\in G}$, of size $\|G\|=n<N$. We then acquire labels for this set and we use them to train a model via regularized empirical risk minimization. By using a mixture of numerical experiments on real and synthetic data, and mathematical derivations under low- and high- dimensional asymptotics, we show that: $(i)$ Data selection can be very effective, in particular beating training on the full sample in some cases; $(ii)$ Certain popular choices in data selection methods (e.g. unbiased reweighted subsampling, or influence function-based subsampling) can be substantially suboptimal. | Germain Kolossov, Andrea Montanari, Pulkit Tandon |  |

This limits their ability to effectively solve tasks involving extended time gaps between actions and outcomes, or tasks demanding the recalling of distant observations to inform current actions. To improve temporal coherence, we integrate a new family of state space models (SSMs) in world models of MBRL agents to present a new method, Recall to Imagine (R2I). This integration aims to enhance both long-term memory and long-horizon credit assignment. Through a diverse set of illustrative tasks, we systematically demonstrate that R2I not only establishes a new state-of-the-art for challenging memory and credit assignment RL tasks, such as BSuite and POPGym, but also showcases superhuman performance in the complex memory domain of Memory Maze. At the same time, it upholds comparable performance in classic RL tasks, such as Atari and DMC, suggesting the generality of our method. We also show that R2I is faster than the state-of-the-art MBRL method, DreamerV3, resulting in faster wall-time convergence. | Mohammad Reza Samsami, Artem Zholus, Janarthanan Rajendran, Sarath Chandar |  |
| 252 |  |  [Monte Carlo guided Denoising Diffusion models for Bayesian linear inverse problems](https://openreview.net/forum?id=nHESwXvxWK) |  | 0 | Ill-posed linear inverse problems arise frequently in various applications, from computational photography to medical imaging. A recent line of research exploits Bayesian inference with informative priors to handle the ill-posedness of such problems. Amongst such priors, score-based generative models (SGM) have recently been successfully applied to several different inverse problems. In this study, we exploit the particular structure of the prior defined by the SGM to define a sequence of intermediate linear inverse problems. As the noise level decreases, the posteriors of these inverse problems get closer to the target posterior of the original inverse problem. To sample from this sequence of posteriors, we propose the use of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods. The proposed algorithm, \algo, is shown to be theoretically grounded and we provide numerical simulations showing that it outperforms competing baselines when dealing with ill-posed inverse problems in a Bayesian setting. | Gabriel Cardoso, Yazid Janati El Idrissi, Sylvain Le Corff, Eric Moulines |  |

Our approach, named instruction backtranslation, starts with a language model finetuned on a small amount of seed data, and a given web corpus. The seed model is used to construct training examples by generating instruction prompts for web documents (self-augmentation), and then selecting high quality examples from among these candidates (self-curation). This data is then used to finetune a stronger model. Finetuning LLaMa on two iterations of our approach yields a model that outperforms all other LLaMa-based models on the Alpaca leaderboard not relying on distillation data, demonstrating highly effective self-alignment. | Xian Li, Ping Yu, Chunting Zhou, Timo Schick, Omer Levy, Luke Zettlemoyer, Jason Weston, Mike Lewis |  |
| 254 |  |  [Learning Interactive Real-World Simulators](https://openreview.net/forum?id=sFyTZEqmUY) |  | 0 | Generative models trained on internet data have revolutionized how text, image, and video content can be created. Perhaps the next milestone for generative models is to simulate realistic experience in response to actions taken by humans, robots, and other interactive agents. Applications of a real-world simulator range from controllable content creation in games and movies, to training embodied agents purely in simulation that can be directly deployed in the real world. We explore the possibility of learning a universal simulator (UniSim) of real-world interaction through generative modeling. We first make the important observation that natural datasets available for learning a real-world simulator are often rich along different axes (e.g., abundant objects in image data, densely sampled actions in robotics data, and diverse movements in navigation data). With careful orchestration of diverse datasets, each providing a different aspect of the overall experience, UniSim can emulate how humans and agents interact with the world by simulating the visual outcome of both high-level instructions such as “open the drawer” and low-level controls such as “move by x,y” from otherwise static scenes and objects. There are numerous use cases for such a real-world simulator. As an example, we use UniSim to train both high-level vision-language planners and low-level reinforcement learning policies, each of which exhibit zero-shot real-world transfer after training purely in a learned real-world simulator. We also show that other types of intelligence such as video captioning models can benefit from training with simulated experience in UniSim, opening up even wider applications. | Sherry Yang, Yilun Du, Seyed Kamyar Seyed Ghasemipour, Jonathan Tompson, Leslie Pack Kaelbling, Dale Schuurmans, Pieter Abbeel |  |
| 255 |  |  [Candidate Label Set Pruning: A Data-centric Perspective for Deep Partial-label Learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Fk5IzauJ7F) |  | 0 | Partial-label learning (PLL) allows each training example to be equipped with a set of candidate labels. Existing deep PLL research focuses on a \emph{learning-centric} perspective to design various training strategies for label disambiguation i.e., identifying the concealed true label from the candidate label set, for model training. However, when the size of the candidate label set becomes excessively large, these learning-centric strategies would be unable to find the true label for model training, thereby causing performance degradation. This motivates us to think from a \emph{data-centric} perspective and pioneer a new PLL-related task called candidate label set pruning (CLSP) that aims to filter out certain potential false candidate labels in a training-free manner. To this end, we propose the first CLSP method based on the inconsistency between the representation space and the candidate label space. Specifically, for each candidate label of a training instance, if it is not a candidate label of the instance's nearest neighbors in the representation space, then it has a high probability of being a false label. Based on this intuition, we employ a per-example pruning scheme that filters out a specific proportion of high-probability false candidate labels. Theoretically, we prove an upper bound of the pruning error rate and analyze how the quality of representations affects our proposed method. Empirically, extensive experiments on both benchmark-simulated and real-world PLL datasets validate the great value of CLSP to significantly improve many state-of-the-art deep PLL methods. | Shuo He, Chaojie Wang, Guowu Yang, Lei Feng |  |

However, it is not known if agents must learn causal models in order to generalise to new domains, or if other inductive biases are sufficient. We answer this question, showing that any agent capable of satisfying a regret bound for a large set of distributional shifts must have learned an approximate causal model of the data generating process, which converges to the true causal model for optimal agents. We discuss the implications of this result for several research areas including transfer learning and causal inference. | Jonathan Richens, Tom Everitt |  |
| 257 |  |  [On the Humanity of Conversational AI: Evaluating the Psychological Portrayal of LLMs](https://openreview.net/forum?id=H3UayAQWoE) |  | 0 | Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently showcased their remarkable capacities, not only in natural language processing tasks but also across diverse domains such as clinical medicine, legal consultation, and education. LLMs become more than mere applications, evolving into assistants capable of addressing diverse user requests. This narrows the distinction between human beings and artificial intelligence agents, raising intriguing questions regarding the potential manifestation of personalities, temperaments, and emotions within LLMs. In this paper, we propose a framework, PsychoBench, for evaluating diverse psychological aspects of LLMs. Comprising thirteen scales commonly used in clinical psychology, PsychoBench further classifies these scales into four distinct categories: personality traits, interpersonal relationships, motivational tests, and emotional abilities. Our study examines five popular models, namely text-davinci-003, ChatGPT, GPT-4, LLaMA-2-7b, and LLaMA-2-13b. Additionally, we employ a jailbreak approach to bypass the safety alignment protocols and test the intrinsic natures of LLMs. We have made PsychoBench openly accessible via https://github.com/CUHK-ARISE/PsychoBench. | Jentse Huang, Wenxuan Wang, Eric John Li, Man Ho Lam, Shujie Ren, Youliang Yuan, Wenxiang Jiao, Zhaopeng Tu, Michael R.

While conventional techniques focused on defining hand-designed prior terms, which are difficult to formulate, re- cent approaches have focused on learning the data term with deep neural networks without explicitly modeling the prior, assuming that the model itself has the capacity to learn an optimal prior from a large-scale dataset. The performance improvement was obvious, however, they often fail to address inherent ambiguities of matching, such as textureless regions, repetitive patterns, large displacements, or noises. To address this, we propose DiffMatch, a novel conditional diffusion-based framework designed to explicitly model both the data and prior terms for dense matching. This is accomplished by leveraging a conditional denoising diffusion model that explic- itly takes matching cost and injects the prior within generative process. However, limited input resolution of the diffusion model is a major hindrance. We address this with a cascaded pipeline, starting with a low-resolution model, followed by a super-resolution model that successively upsamples and incorporates finer details to the matching field. Our experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements of our method over existing approaches, and the ablation studies validate our design choices along with the effectiveness of each component.

Learning strong image encoders from 1 long unlabelled video](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Yen1lGns2o) |  | 0 | Self-supervised learning has unlocked the potential of scaling up pretraining to billions of images, since annotation is unnecessary. But are we making the best use of data? How more economical can we be? In this work, we attempt to answer this question by making two contributions. First, we investigate first-person videos and introduce a \`\`Walking Tours'' dataset. These videos are high-resolution, hours-long, captured in a single uninterrupted take, depicting a large number of objects and actions with natural scene transitions. They are unlabeled and uncurated, thus realistic for self-supervision and comparable with human learning. Second, we introduce a novel self-supervised image pretraining method tailored for learning from continuous videos. Existing methods typically adapt image-based pretraining approaches to incorporate more frames. Instead, we advocate a \`\`tracking to learn to recognize'' approach. Our method called DoRA, leads to attention maps that \*\*D\*\*isc\*\*O\*\*ver and t\*\*RA\*\*ck objects over time in an end-to-end manner, using transformer cross-attention. We derive multiple views from the tracks and use them in a classical self-supervised distillation loss. Using our novel approach, a single Walking Tours video remarkably becomes a strong competitor to ImageNet for several image and video downstream tasks. | Shashanka Venkataramanan, Mamshad Nayeem Rizve, João Carreira, Yuki M.

To that end, recent studies have shown the efficacy of fine-tuning with carefully-crafted adaptation architectures. However this raises the question of: How can one design the optimal adaptation strategy? In this paper, we study this question through the lens of neural architecture search (NAS). Given a pre-trained neural network, our algorithm discovers the optimal arrangement of adapters, which layers to keep frozen, and which to fine-tune. We demonstrate the generality of our NAS method by applying it to both residual networks and vision transformers and report state-of-the-art performance on Meta-Dataset and Meta-Album. | Panagiotis Eustratiadis, Lukasz Dudziak, Da Li, Timothy M.

This scenario is formulated as Evolving Domain Generalization (EDG), where models aim to generalize well to unseen target domains in a time-varying system by learning and leveraging the underlying evolving pattern of the distribution shifts across domains. However, existing methods encounter challenges due to the limited number of timestamps (every domain corresponds to a timestamp) in EDG datasets, leading to difficulties in capturing evolving dynamics and risking overfitting to the sparse timestamps, which hampers their generalization and adaptability to new tasks. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach SDE-EDG that collects the Infinitely Fined-Grid Evolving Trajectory (IFGET) of the data distribution with continuous-interpolated samples to bridge temporal gaps (intervals between two successive timestamps). Furthermore, by leveraging the inherent capacity of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to capture continuous trajectories, we propose their use to align SDE-modeled trajectories with IFGET across domains, thus enabling the capture of evolving distribution trends. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate that it can achieve superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. | Qiuhao Zeng, Changjian Shui, LongKai Huang, Peng Liu, Xi Chen, Charles Ling, Boyu Wang |  |

Although existing attribution solutions can effectively assign importance to target elements, they still face the following challenges: 1) existing attribution methods generate inaccurate small regions thus misleading the direction of correct attribution, and 2) the model cannot produce good attribution results for samples with wrong predictions. To address the above challenges, this paper re-models the above image attribution problem as a submodular subset selection problem, aiming to enhance model interpretability using fewer regions. To address the lack of attention to local regions, we construct a novel submodular function to discover more accurate small interpretation regions. To enhance the attribution effect for all samples, we also impose four different constraints on the selection of sub-regions, i.e., confidence, effectiveness, consistency, and collaboration scores, to assess the importance of various subsets. Moreover, our theoretical analysis substantiates that the proposed function is in fact submodular. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method outperforms SOTA methods on two face datasets (Celeb-A and VGG-Face2) and one fine-grained dataset (CUB-200-2011). For correctly predicted samples, the proposed method improves the Deletion and Insertion scores with an average of 4.9\% and 2.5\% gain relative to HSIC-Attribution. For incorrectly predicted samples, our method achieves gains of 81.0\% and 18.4\% compared to the HSIC-Attribution algorithm in the average highest confidence and Insertion score respectively.

In contrast to existing approaches that pursue top-down prediction of global parametrizations of camera extrinsics, we propose a distributed representation of camera pose that treats a camera as a bundle of rays. This representation allows for a tight coupling with spatial image features improving pose precision. We observe that this representation is naturally suited for set-level transformers and develop a regression-based approach that maps image patches to corresponding rays. To capture the inherent uncertainties in sparse-view pose inference, we adapt this approach to learn a denoising diffusion model which allows us to sample plausible modes while improving performance. Our proposed methods, both regression- and diffusion-based, demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on camera pose estimation on CO3D while generalizing to unseen object categories and in-the-wild captures. | Jason Y.

Typically, these random-walks are chosen to be Markov chains that asymptotically sample from a desired target distribution, and play a critical role in the convergence of the optimization iterates. In this paper, we take a novel approach by replacing the standard \*linear\* Markovian token by one which follows a \*non-linear\* Markov chain - namely the Self-Repellent Radom Walk (SRRW). Defined for any given 'base' Markov chain, the SRRW, parameterized by a positive scalar $\\alpha$, is less likely to transition to states that were highly visited in the past, thus the name. In the context of MCMC sampling on a graph, a recent breakthrough in Doshi et al. (2023) shows that the SRRW achieves $O(1/\\alpha)$ decrease in the asymptotic variance for sampling. We propose the use of a \`generalized' version of the SRRW to drive token algorithms for distributed stochastic optimization in the form of stochastic approximation, termed SA-SRRW. We prove that the optimization iterate errors of the resulting SA-SRRW converge to zero almost surely and prove a central limit theorem, deriving the explicit form of the resulting asymptotic covariance matrix corresponding to iterate errors. This asymptotic covariance is always smaller than that of an algorithm driven by the base Markov chain and decreases at rate $O(1/\\alpha^2)$ - the performance benefit of using SRRW thereby \*amplified\* in the stochastic optimization context. Empirical results support our theoretical findings. | Jie Hu, Vishwaraj Doshi, Do Young Eun |  |

However, studies show that some outputs are merely replications of training data. Such replications present potential legal challenges for model owners, especially when the generated content contains proprietary information. In this work, we introduce a straightforward yet effective method for detecting memorized prompts by inspecting the magnitude of text-conditional predictions. Our proposed method seamlessly integrates without disrupting sampling algorithms, and delivers high accuracy even at the first generation step, with a single generation per prompt. Building on our detection strategy, we unveil an explainable approach that shows the contribution of individual words or tokens to memorization. This offers an interactive medium for users to adjust their prompts. Moreover, we propose two strategies i.e., to mitigate memorization by leveraging the magnitude of text-conditional predictions, either through minimization during inference or filtering during training. These proposed strategies effectively counteract memorization while maintaining high-generation quality.

In this paper, we propose a methodology that jointly searches for the optimal pretrained model and the hyperparameters for finetuning it. Our method transfers knowledge about the performance of many pretrained models with multiple hyperparameter configurations on a series of datasets. To this aim, we evaluated over 20k hyperparameter configurations for finetuning 24 pretrained image classification models on 87 datasets to generate a large-scale meta-dataset. We meta-learn a gray-box performance predictor on the learning curves of this meta-dataset and use it for fast hyperparameter optimization on new datasets. We empirically demonstrate that our resulting approach can quickly select an accurate pretrained model for a new dataset together with its optimal hyperparameters. | Sebastian PinedaArango, Fabio Ferreira, Arlind Kadra, Frank Hutter, Josif Grabocka |  |
| 267 |  |  [LongLoRA: Efficient Fine-tuning of Long-Context Large Language Models](https://openreview.net/forum?id=6PmJoRfdaK) |  | 0 | We present LongLoRA, an efficient fine-tuning approach that extends the context sizes of pre-trained large language models (LLMs), with limited computation cost. Typically, training LLMs with long context sizes is computationally expensive, requiring extensive training hours and GPU resources. For example, training on the context length of 8192 needs 16x computational costs in self-attention layers as that of 2048. In this paper, we speed up the context extension of LLMs in two aspects. On the one hand, although dense global attention is needed during inference, fine-tuning the model can be effectively and efficiently done by sparse local attention. The proposed shifted sparse attention effectively enables context extension, leading to non-trivial computation saving with similar performance to fine-tuning with vanilla attention. Particularly, it can be implemented with only two lines of code in training, while being optional in inference. On the other hand, we revisit the parameter-efficient fine-tuning regime for context expansion. Notably, we find that LoRA for context extension works well under the premise of trainable embedding and normalization. LongLoRA combines this improved LoRA with S^2-Attn. LongLoRA demonstrates strong empirical results on various tasks on Llama2 models from 7B/13B to 70B. LongLoRA extends Llama2 7B from 4k context to 100k, or Llama2 70B to 32k on a single 8x A100 machine. LongLoRA extends models' context while retaining their original architectures, and is compatible with most existing techniques, like Flash-Attention2. In addition, we further conduct supervised fine-tuning with LongLoRA and our long instruction-following LongAlpaca dataset. All our code, models, dataset, and demo are available at https://github.com/dvlab-research/LongLoRA. | Yukang Chen, Shengju Qian, Haotian Tang, Xin Lai, Zhijian Liu, Song Han, Jiaya Jia |  |

This limits tractable querying of this knowledge to start-to-end autoregressive sampling. However, many tasks of interest---including sequence continuation, infilling, and other forms of constrained generation---involve sampling from intractable posterior distributions. We address this limitation by using amortized Bayesian inference to sample from these intractable posteriors. Such amortization is algorithmically achieved by fine-tuning LLMs via diversity-seeking reinforcement learning algorithms: generative flow networks (GFlowNets). We empirically demonstrate that this distribution-matching paradigm of LLM fine-tuning can serve as an effective alternative to maximum-likelihood training and reward-maximizing policy optimization. As an important application, we interpret chain-of-thought reasoning as a latent variable modeling problem and demonstrate that our approach enables data-efficient adaptation of LLMs to tasks that require multi-step rationalization and tool use. | Edward J.

An essential aspect is accurately estimating the carbon impact of emerging LLMs even before their training, which heavily relies on GPU usage. Existing studies have reported the carbon footprint of LLM training, but only one tool, mlco2, can predict the carbon footprint of new neural networks prior to physical training. However, mlco2 has several serious limitations. It cannot extend its estimation to dense or mixture-of-experts (MoE) LLMs, disregards critical architectural parameters, focuses solely on GPUs, and cannot model embodied carbon footprints. Addressing these gaps, we introduce \textit{\carb}, an end-to-end carbon footprint projection model designed for both dense and MoE LLMs. Compared to mlco2, \carb~significantly enhances the accuracy of carbon footprint estimations for various LLMs. The source code is released at \url{https://github.com/SotaroKaneda/MLCarbon}. | Ahmad Faiz, Sotaro Kaneda, Ruhan Wang, Rita Chukwunyere Osi, Prateek Sharma, Fan Chen, Lei Jiang |  |

However, the performance on real-world websites has still suffered from (1) open domainness, (2) limited context length, and (3) lack of inductive bias on HTML. We introduce WebAgent, an LLM-driven agent that learns from self-experience to complete tasks on real websites following natural language instructions. WebAgent plans ahead by decomposing instructions into canonical sub-instructions, summarizes long HTML documents into task-relevant snippets, and acts on websites via Python programs generated from those. We design WebAgent with Flan-U-PaLM, for grounded code generation, and HTML-T5, new pre-trained LLMs for long HTML documents using local and global attention mechanisms and a mixture of long-span denoising objectives, for planning and summarization. We empirically demonstrate that our modular recipe improves the success on real websites by over 50%, and that HTML-T5 is the best model to solve various HTML understanding tasks; achieving 18.7% higher success rate than the prior method on MiniWoB web automation benchmark, and SoTA performance on Mind2Web, an offline task planning evaluation. | Izzeddin Gur, Hiroki Furuta, Austin V.

However, the rationality of the diffusion process itself receives limited attention, leaving the question of whether the problem is well-posed and well-conditioned. In this paper, we uncover a vexing propensity of diffusion models: they frequently exhibit the infinite Lipschitz near the zero point of timesteps. We provide theoretical proofs to illustrate the presence of infinite Lipschitz constants and empirical results to confirm it. The Lipschitz singularities pose a threat to the stability and accuracy during both the training and inference processes of diffusion models. Therefore, the mitigation of Lipschitz singularities holds great potential for enhancing the performance of diffusion models. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach, dubbed E-TSDM, which alleviates the Lipschitz singularities of the diffusion model near the zero point. Remarkably, our technique yields a substantial improvement in performance. Moreover, as a byproduct of our method, we achieve a dramatic reduction in the Fréchet Inception Distance of acceleration methods relying on network Lipschitz, including DDIM and DPM-Solver, by over 33\%. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets validate our theory and method. Our work may advance the understanding of the general diffusion process, and also provide insights for the design of diffusion models. | Zhantao Yang, Ruili Feng, Han Zhang, Yujun Shen, Kai Zhu, Lianghua Huang, Yifei Zhang, Yu Liu, Deli Zhao, Jingren Zhou, Fan Cheng |  |

We decompose the image representation as a sum across individual image patches, model layers, and attention heads, and use CLIP's text representation to interpret the summands. Interpreting the attention heads, we characterize each head's role by automatically finding text representations that span its output space, which reveals property-specific roles for many heads (e.g. location or shape). Next, interpreting the image patches, we uncover an emergent spatial localization within CLIP. Finally, we use this understanding to remove spurious features from CLIP and to create a strong zero-shot image segmenter. Our results indicate that scalable understanding of transformer models is attainable and can be used to repair and improve models. | Yossi Gandelsman, Alexei A. Efros, Jacob Steinhardt |  |

These two challenges connect to the "subset degradation problem" in traditional dataset condensation: a subset from a larger condensed dataset is often unrepresentative compared to directly condensing the whole dataset to that smaller size. In this paper, we propose Multisize Dataset Condensation (MDC) by \*\*compressing $N$ condensation processes into a single condensation process to obtain datasets with multiple sizes.\*\* Specifically, we introduce an "adaptive subset loss" on top of the basic condensation loss to mitigate the "subset degradation problem". Our MDC method offers several benefits: 1) No additional condensation process is required; 2) reduced storage requirement by reusing condensed images. Experiments validate our findings on networks including ConvNet, ResNet and DenseNet, and datasets including SVHN, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet. For example, we achieved 5.22%-6.40% average accuracy gains on condensing CIFAR-10 to ten images per class.

Though promising results have been exhibited, these methods often suffer from slow per-sample optimization, limiting their practical usage. In this paper, we propose DreamGaussian, a novel 3D content generation framework that achieves both efficiency and quality simultaneously. Our key insight is to design a generative 3D Gaussian Splatting model with companioned mesh extraction and texture refinement in UV space. In contrast to the occupancy pruning used in Neural Radiance Fields, we demonstrate that the progressive densification of 3D Gaussians converges significantly faster for 3D generative tasks. To further enhance the texture quality and facilitate downstream applications, we introduce an efficient algorithm to convert 3D Gaussians into textured meshes and apply a fine-tuning stage to refine the details. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior efficiency and competitive generation quality of our proposed approach. Notably, DreamGaussian produces high-quality textured meshes in just 2 minutes from a single-view image, achieving approximately 10 times acceleration compared to existing methods. | Jiaxiang Tang, Jiawei Ren, Hang Zhou, Ziwei Liu, Gang Zeng |  |

In contrast to many previous methods that are trained on small-scale datasets such as ShapeNet in a category-specific fashion, LRM adopts a highly scalable transformer-based architecture with 500 million learnable parameters to directly predict a neural radiance field (NeRF) from the input image. We train our model in an end-to-end manner on massive multi-view data containing around 1 million objects, including both synthetic renderings from Objaverse and real captures from MVImgNet. This combination of a high-capacity model and large-scale training data empowers our model to be highly generalizable and produce high-quality 3D reconstructions from various testing inputs, including real-world in-the-wild captures and images created by generative models. Video demos and interactable 3D meshes can be found on our LRM project webpage: https://yiconghong.me/LRM. | Yicong Hong, Kai Zhang, Jiuxiang Gu, Sai Bi, Yang Zhou, Difan Liu, Feng Liu, Kalyan Sunkavalli, Trung Bui, Hao Tan |  |
| 276 |  |  [How Well Do Supervised 3D Models Transfer to Medical Imaging Tasks?](https://openreview.net/forum?id=AhizIPytk4) |  | 0 | The pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm has become prominent in transfer learning. For example, if the model is pre-trained on ImageNet and then fine-tuned to PASCAL, it can significantly outperform that trained on PASCAL from scratch. While ImageNet pre-training has shown enormous success, it is formed in 2D, and the learned features are for classification tasks; when transferring to more diverse tasks, like 3D image segmentation, its performance is inevitably compromised due to the deviation from the original ImageNet context. A significant challenge lies in the lack of large, annotated 3D datasets rivaling the scale of ImageNet for model pre-training. To overcome this challenge, we make two contributions. Firstly, we construct AbdomenAtlas 1.1 that comprises \*\*9,262\*\* three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) volumes with high-quality, per-voxel annotations of 25 anatomical structures and pseudo annotations of seven tumor types. Secondly, we develop a suite of models that are pre-trained on our AbdomenAtlas 1.1 for transfer learning. Our preliminary analyses indicate that the model trained only with 21 CT volumes, 672 masks, and 40 GPU hours has a transfer learning ability similar to the model trained with 5,050 (unlabeled) CT volumes and 1,152 GPU hours. More importantly, the transfer learning ability of supervised models can further scale up with larger annotated datasets, achieving significantly better performance than preexisting pre-trained models, irrespective of their pre-training methodologies or data sources. We hope this study can facilitate collective efforts in constructing larger 3D medical datasets and more releases of supervised pre-trained models. | Wenxuan Li, Alan L. Yuille, Zongwei Zhou |  |

Existing approaches typically handle dropout error via imputation, which may introduce spurious relations as the true joint distribution is generally unidentifiable. To tackle this issue, we introduce a causal graphical model to characterize the dropout mechanism, namely, Causal Dropout Model. We provide a simple yet effective theoretical result: interestingly, the conditional independence (CI) relations in the data with dropouts, after deleting the samples with zero values (regardless if technical or not) for the conditioned variables, are asymptotically identical to the CI relations in the original data without dropouts. This particular test-wise deletion procedure, in which we perform CI tests on the samples without zeros for the conditioned variables, can be seamlessly integrated with existing structure learning approaches including constraint-based and greedy score-based methods, thus giving rise to a principled framework for GRNI in the presence of dropouts. We further show that the causal dropout model can be validated from data, and many existing statistical models to handle dropouts fit into our model as specific parametric instances. Empirical evaluation on synthetic, curated, and real-world experimental transcriptomic data comprehensively demonstrate the efficacy of our method. | Haoyue Dai, Ignavier Ng, Gongxu Luo, Peter Spirtes, Petar Stojanov, Kun Zhang |  |

Recently, semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations have been proposed for solving the $K$-means optimization problem, which enjoy strong statistical optimality guarantees. However, the prohibitive cost of implementing an SDP solver renders these guarantees inaccessible to practical datasets. In contrast, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a simple clustering algorithm widely used by machine learning practitioners, but it lacks a solid statistical underpinning and theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we consider an NMF-like algorithm that solves a nonnegative low-rank restriction of the SDP-relaxed $K$-means formulation using a nonconvex Burer--Monteiro factorization approach. The resulting algorithm is as simple and scalable as state-of-the-art NMF algorithms while also enjoying the same strong statistical optimality guarantees as the SDP. In our experiments, we observe that our algorithm achieves significantly smaller mis-clustering errors compared to the existing state-of-the-art while maintaining scalability. | Yubo Zhuang, Xiaohui Chen, Yun Yang, Richard Y.

The work launched hundreds of papers purporting to improve over the postprocessing baseline. We empirically evaluate these claims through thousands of model evaluations on several tabular datasets. We find that the fairness-accuracy Pareto frontier achieved by postprocessing contains all other methods we were feasibly able to evaluate. In doing so, we address two common methodological errors that have confounded previous observations. One relates to the comparison of methods with different unconstrained base models. The other concerns methods achieving different levels of constraint relaxation. At the heart of our study is a simple idea we call unprocessing that roughly corresponds to the inverse of postprocessing. Unprocessing allows for a direct comparison of methods using different underlying models and levels of relaxation. | André F. Cruz, Moritz Hardt |  |

A common approach is to filter out samples that make less contribution to the training. This could lead to gradient expectation bias compared to the original data. To solve this problem, we propose InfoBatch, a novel framework aiming to achieve lossless training acceleration by unbiased dynamic data pruning. Specifically, InfoBatch randomly prunes a portion of less informative samples based on the loss distribution and rescales the gradients of the remaining samples to approximate the original gradient. As a plug-and-play and architecture-agnostic framework, InfoBatch consistently obtains lossless training results on classification, semantic segmentation, vision pertaining, and instruction fine-tuning tasks. On CIFAR10/100, ImageNet- 1K, and ADE20K, InfoBatch losslessly saves 40% overall cost. For pertaining MAE and diffusion model, InfoBatch can respectively save 24.8% and 27% cost. For LLaMA instruction fine-tuning, combining InfoBatch and the recent coreset selection method (DQ) can achieve 10 times acceleration. Our results encourage more exploration on the data efficiency aspect of large model training. Code is publicly available at NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/InfoBatch. | Ziheng Qin, Kai Wang, Zangwei Zheng, Jianyang Gu, Xiangyu Peng, Zhaopan Xu, Daquan Zhou, Lei Shang, Baigui Sun, Xuansong Xie, Yang You |  |

To address this issue, one feasible solution is learning the correspondence between video clips and captions, which however inevitably encounters the multi-granularity noisy correspondence (MNC) problem. To be specific, MNC refers to the clip-caption misalignment (coarse-grained) and frame-word misalignment (fine-grained), hindering temporal learning and video understanding. In this paper, we propose NOise Robust Temporal Optimal traNsport (Norton) that addresses MNC in a unified optimal transport (OT) framework. In brief, Norton employs video-paragraph and clip-caption contrastive losses to capture long-term dependencies based on OT. To address coarse-grained misalignment in video-paragraph contrast, Norton filters out the irrelevant clips and captions through an alignable prompt bucket and realigns asynchronous clip-caption pairs based on transport distance. To address the fine-grained misalignment, Norton incorporates a soft-maximum operator to identify crucial words and key frames. Additionally, Norton exploits the potential faulty negative samples in clip-caption contrast by rectifying the alignment target with OT assignment to ensure precise temporal modeling. Extensive experiments on video retrieval, videoQA, and action segmentation verify the effectiveness of our method.

| 282 |  |  [SaNN: Simple Yet Powerful Simplicial-aware Neural Networks](https://openreview.net/forum?id=eUgS9Ig8JG) |  | 0 | Simplicial neural networks (SNNs) are deep models for higher-order graph representation learning. SNNs learn low-dimensional embeddings of simplices in a simplicial complex by aggregating features of their respective upper, lower, boundary, and coboundary adjacent simplices. The aggregation in SNNs is carried out during training. Since the number of simplices of various orders in a simplicial complex is significantly large, the memory and training-time requirement in SNNs is enormous. In this work, we propose a scalable simplicial-aware neural network (SaNN) model with a constant run-time and memory requirements independent of the size of the simplicial complex and the density of interactions in it. SaNN is based on pre-aggregated simplicial-aware features as inputs to a neural network, so it has a strong simplicial-structural inductive bias. We provide theoretical conditions under which SaNN is provably more powerful than the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) graph isomorphism test and as powerful as the simplicial Weisfeiler-Lehman (SWL) test. We also show that SaNN is permutation and orientation equivariant and satisfies simplicial-awareness of the highest order in a simplicial complex. We demonstrate via numerical experiments that despite being computationally economical, the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting trajectories, simplicial closures, and classifying graphs. | Sravanthi Gurugubelli, Sundeep Prabhakar Chepuri |  |
| 283 |  |  [Beyond Memorization: Violating Privacy via Inference with Large Language Models](https://openreview.net/forum?id=kmn0BhQk7p) |  | 0 | Current privacy research on large language models (LLMs) primarily focuses on the issue of extracting memorized training data. At the same time, models’ inference capabilities have increased drastically. This raises the key question of whether current LLMs could violate individuals’ privacy by inferring personal attributes from text given at inference time. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study on the capabilities of pretrained LLMs to infer personal attributes from text. We construct a dataset consisting of real Reddit profiles, and show that current LLMs can infer a wide range of personal attributes (e.g., location, income, sex), achieving up to 85% top-1 and 95% top-3 accuracy at a fraction of the cost (100x) and time (240x) required by humans. As people increasingly interact with LLM-powered chatbots across all aspects of life, we also explore the emerging threat of privacy-invasive chatbots trying to extract personal information through seemingly benign questions. Finally, we show that common mitigations, i.e., text anonymization and model alignment, are currently ineffective at protecting user privacy against LLM inference. Our findings highlight that current LLMs can infer personal data at a previously unattainable scale. In the absence of working defenses, we advocate for a broader discussion around LLM privacy implications beyond memorization, striving for stronger and wider privacy protection. | Robin Staab, Mark Vero, Mislav Balunovic, Martin T.

In this work, we introduce model arithmetic, a novel inference framework for composing and biasing LLMs without the need for model (re)training or highly specific datasets. In addition, the framework allows for more precise control of generated text than direct prompting and prior controlled text generation (CTG) techniques. Using model arithmetic, we can express prior CTG techniques as simple formulas and naturally extend them to new and more effective formulations. Further, we show that speculative sampling, a technique for efficient LLM sampling, extends to our setting. This enables highly efficient text generation with multiple composed models with only marginal overhead over a single model. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that model arithmetic allows fine-grained control of generated text while outperforming state-of-the-art on the task of toxicity reduction. We release an open source easy-to-use implementation of our framework at https://github.com/eth-sri/language-model-arithmetic. | Jasper Dekoninck, Marc Fischer, Luca BeurerKellner, Martin T.

Although existing approaches for node anomaly detection have shown effectiveness, they have yet to fully address two major challenges: operating in settings with limited supervision and managing class imbalance effectively. In response to these challenges, we propose a novel model, ConsisGAD, which is tailored for GAD in scenarios characterized by limited supervision and is anchored in the principles of consistency training. Under limited supervision, ConsisGAD effectively leverages the abundance of unlabeled data for consistency training by incorporating a novel learnable data augmentation mechanism, thereby introducing controlled noise into the dataset. Moreover, ConsisGAD takes advantage of the variance in homophily distribution between normal and anomalous nodes to craft a simplified GNN backbone, enhancing its capability to distinguish effectively between these two classes. Comprehensive experiments on several benchmark datasets validate the superior performance of ConsisGAD in comparison to state-of-the-art baselines.

We propose \emph{mean-field Langevin averaged gradient} (MFL-AG), a single-loop algorithm that implements gradient descent ascent in the distribution spaces with a novel weighted averaging, and establish average-iterate convergence to the mixed Nash equilibrium. We also study both time and particle discretization regimes and prove a new uniform-in-time propagation of chaos result which accounts for the dependency of the particle interactions on all previous distributions. Furthermore, we propose \emph{mean-field Langevin anchored best response} (MFL-ABR), a symmetric double-loop algorithm based on best response dynamics with linear last-iterate convergence. Finally, we study applications to zero-sum Markov games and conduct simulations demonstrating long-term optimality. | Juno Kim, Kakei Yamamoto, Kazusato Oko, Zhuoran Yang, Taiji Suzuki |  |

To address this, we present a novel algorithm called Generalized Policy Iteration using Tensor Train (TTPI) that belongs to the class of Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP). We use a low-rank tensor approximation technique called Tensor Train (TT) to approximate the state-value and advantage function which enables us to efficiently handle hybrid systems. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach over previous baselines for some benchmark problems with hybrid action spaces. Additionally, the robustness and generalization of the policy for hybrid systems are showcased through a real-world robotics experiment involving a non-prehensile manipulation task which is considered to be a highly challenging control problem. | Suhan Shetty, Teng Xue, Sylvain Calinon |  |

However, prior works derive such estimates for training by kernel ridge regression (KRR), whereas neural networks are typically trained with gradient descent (GD). In the present work, we consider the training of kernels with a family of \emph{spectral algorithms} specified by profile $h(\lambda)$, and including KRR and GD as special cases. Then, we derive the generalization error as a functional of learning profile $h(\lambda)$ for two data models: high-dimensional Gaussian and low-dimensional translation-invariant model. Under power-law assumptions on the spectrum of the kernel and target, we use our framework to (i) give full loss asymptotics for both noisy and noiseless observations (ii) show that the loss localizes on certain spectral scales, giving a new perspective on the KRR saturation phenomenon (iii) conjecture, and demonstrate for the considered data models, the universality of the loss w.r.t. non-spectral details of the problem, but only in case of noisy observation. | Maksim Velikanov, Maxim Panov, Dmitry Yarotsky |  |
| 289 |  |  [Debiased Collaborative Filtering with Kernel-Based Causal Balancing](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Ffjc8ApSbt) |  | 0 | Collaborative filtering builds personalized models from the collected user feedback. However, the collected data is observational rather than experimental, leading to various biases in the data, which can significantly affect the learned model. To address this issue, many studies have focused on propensity-based methods to combat the selection bias by reweighting the sample loss, and demonstrate that balancing is important for debiasing both theoretically and empirically. However, there are two questions that still need to be addressed: which function class should be balanced and how to effectively balance that function class? In this paper, we first perform theoretical analysis to show the effect of balancing finite-dimensional function classes on the bias of IPS and DR methods, and based on this, we propose a universal kernel-based balancing method to balance functions on the reproducing kernel Hilbert space. In addition, we propose a novel adaptive causal balancing method during the alternating update between unbiased evaluation and training of the prediction model. Specifically, the prediction loss of the model is projected in the kernel-based covariate function space, and the projection coefficients are used to determine which functions should be prioritized for balancing to reduce the estimation bias. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. | Haoxuan Li, Chunyuan Zheng, Yanghao Xiao, Peng Wu, Zhi Geng, Xu Chen, Peng Cui |  |

These require strategic exploration algorithms that use relatively limited function classes for representing the policy or value function. Our goal is to explain why deep RL algorithms often perform well in practice, despite using random exploration and much more expressive function classes like neural networks. Our work arrives at an explanation by showing that many stochastic MDPs can be solved by performing only a few steps of value iteration on the random policy’s Q function and then acting greedily. When this is true, we find that it is possible to separate the exploration and learning components of RL, making it much easier to analyze. We introduce a new RL algorithm, SQIRL, that iteratively learns a near-optimal policy by exploring randomly to collect rollouts and then performing a limited number of steps of fitted-Q iteration over those roll- outs. We find that any regression algorithm that satisfies basic in-distribution generalization properties can be used in SQIRL to efficiently solve common MDPs. This can explain why deep RL works with complex function approximators like neural networks, since it is empirically established that neural networks generalize well in-distribution. Furthermore, SQIRL explains why random exploration works well in practice, since we show many environments can be solved by effectively estimating the random policy’s Q-function and then applying zero or a few steps of value iteration. We leverage SQIRL to derive instance-dependent sample complexity bounds for RL that are exponential only in an “effective horizon” of lookahead—which is typically much smaller than the full horizon—and on the complexity of the class used for function approximation. Empirically, we also find that SQIRL performance strongly correlates with PPO and DQN performance in a variety of stochastic environments, supporting that our theoretical analysis is predictive of practical performance.

Although such general purpose representations encode rich syntactic and semantic information about the scene, much of this information is often irrelevant to the specific task at hand. This introduces noise within the learning process and distracts the agent's focus from task-relevant visual cues. Inspired by selective attention in humans—the process through which people filter their perception based on their experiences, knowledge, and the task at hand—we introduce a parameter-efficient approach to filter visual stimuli for embodied AI. Our approach induces a task-conditioned bottleneck using a small learnable codebook module. This codebook is trained jointly to optimize task reward and acts as a task-conditioned selective filter over the visual observation. Our experiments showcase state-of-the-art performance for object goal navigation and object displacement across $5$ benchmarks, ProcTHOR, ArchitecTHOR, RoboTHOR, AI2-iTHOR, and ManipulaTHOR. The filtered representations produced by the codebook are also able generalize better and converge faster when adapted to other simulation environments such as Habitat. Our qualitative analyses show that agents explore their environments more effectively and their representations retain task-relevant information like target object recognition while ignoring superfluous information about other objects. | Ainaz Eftekhar, KuoHao Zeng, Jiafei Duan, Ali Farhadi, Aniruddha Kembhavi, Ranjay Krishna |  |

As universal AI assistants, there's a growing expectation for them to perform consistently across various domains. However, previous work shows that Reinforcement Learning (RL) often exploits shortcuts to attain high rewards and overlooks challenging samples. This focus on quick reward gains undermines both the stability in training and the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data. In this work, we propose a novel approach that can learn a consistent policy via RL across various data groups or domains. Given the challenges associated with acquiring group annotations, our method automatically classifies data into different groups, deliberately maximizing performance variance. Then, we optimize the policy to perform well on challenging groups. Lastly, leveraging the established groups, our approach adaptively adjusts the exploration space, allocating more learning capacity to more challenging data and preventing the model from over-optimizing on simpler data. Experimental results indicate that our approach significantly enhances training stability and model generalization. | Rui Zheng, Wei Shen, Yuan Hua, Wenbin Lai, Shihan Dou, Yuhao Zhou, Zhiheng Xi, Xiao Wang, Haoran Huang, Tao Gui, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang |  |

Training PINNs using this loss function is challenging as it typically requires selecting large numbers of points of different types, each with different training dynamics. Unlike past works that focused on the selection of either collocation or experimental points, this work introduces PINN Adaptive ColLocation and Experimental points selection (PINNACLE), the first algorithm that jointly optimizes the selection of all training point types, while automatically adjusting the proportion of collocation point types as training progresses. PINNACLE uses information on the interactions among training point types, which had not been considered before, based on an analysis of PINN training dynamics via the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). We theoretically show that the criterion used by PINNACLE is related to the PINN generalization error, and empirically demonstrate that PINNACLE is able to outperform existing point selection methods for forward, inverse, and transfer learning problems. | Gregory Kang Ruey Lau, Apivich Hemachandra, SeeKiong Ng, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low |  |

These come with parameters whose optimal values depend on the system being solved and are often impossible or too expensive to identify; thus in practice sub-optimal heuristics are used. We consider the common setting in which many related linear systems need to be solved, e.g. during a single numerical simulation. In this scenario, can we sequentially choose parameters that attain a near-optimal overall number of iterations, without extra matrix computations? We answer in the affirmative for Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR), a standard solver whose parameter $\omega$ has a strong impact on its runtime. For this method, we prove that a bandit online learning algorithm—using only the number of iterations as feedback—can select parameters for a sequence of instances such that the overall cost approaches that of the best fixed $\omega$ as the sequence length increases. Furthermore, when given additional structural information, we show that a _contextual_ bandit method asymptotically achieves the performance of the _instance-optimal_ policy, which selects the best $\omega$ for each instance. Our work provides the first learning-theoretic treatment of high-precision linear system solvers and the first end-to-end guarantees for data-driven scientific computing, demonstrating theoretically the potential to speed up numerical methods using well-understood learning algorithms. | Mikhail Khodak, Edmond Chow, MariaFlorina Balcan, Ameet Talwalkar |  |
| 295 |  |  [Rotation Has Two Sides: Evaluating Data Augmentation for Deep One-class Classification](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Ad81awoBVS) |  | 0 | One-class classification (OCC) involves predicting whether a new data is normal or anomalous based solely on the data from a single class during training. Various attempts have been made to learn suitable representations for OCC within a self-supervised framework. Notably, discriminative methods that use geometric visual transformations, such as rotation, to generate pseudo-anomaly samples have exhibited impressive detection performance. Although rotation is commonly viewed as a distribution-shifting transformation and is widely used in the literature, the cause of its effectiveness remains a mystery. In this study, we are the first to make a surprising observation: there exists a strong linear relationship (Pearson's Correlation, $r > 0.9$) between the accuracy of rotation prediction and the performance of OCC. This suggests that a classifier that effectively distinguishes different rotations is more likely to excel in OCC, and vice versa. The root cause of this phenomenon can be attributed to the transformation bias in the dataset, where representations learned from transformations already present in the dataset tend to be less effective, making it essential to accurately estimate the transformation distribution before utilizing pretext tasks involving these transformations for reliable self-supervised representation learning. To the end, we propose a novel two-stage method to estimate the transformation distribution within the dataset. In the first stage, we learn general representations through standard contrastive pre-training. In the second stage, we select potentially semantics-preserving samples from the entire augmented dataset, which includes all rotations, by employing density matching with the provided reference distribution. By sorting samples based on semantics-preserving versus shifting transformations, we achieve improved performance on OCC benchmarks. | Guodong Wang, Yunhong Wang, Xiuguo Bao, Di Huang |  |

Conventional SSL studies typically assume close environment scenarios where labeled and unlabeled examples are independently sampled from the same distribution. However, real-world tasks often involve open environment scenarios where the data distribution, label space, and feature space could differ between labeled and unlabeled data. This inconsistency introduces robustness challenges for SSL algorithms. In this paper, we first propose several robustness metrics for SSL based on the Robustness Analysis Curve (RAC), secondly, we establish a theoretical framework for studying the generalization performance and robustness of SSL algorithms in open environments, thirdly, we re-implement widely adopted SSL algorithms within a unified SSL toolkit and evaluate their performance on proposed open environment SSL benchmarks, including both image, text, and tabular datasets. By investigating the empirical and theoretical results, insightful discussions on enhancing the robustness of SSL algorithms in open environments are presented.

We formulate these problems as generative-adversarial (i.e., min-max) optimization problems, which we develop polynomial-time algorithms to solve, the former of which relies on an exact first- order oracle, and the latter, a stochastic one. We extend our approach to solve inverse multiagent simulacral learning in polynomial time and number of samples. In these problems, we seek a simulacrum, meaning parameters and an associated equilibrium that replicate the given observations in expectation. We find that our approach outperforms the widely-used ARIMA method in predicting prices in Spanish electricity markets based on time-series data. | Denizalp Goktas, Amy Greenwald, Sadie Zhao, Alec Koppel, Sumitra Ganesh |  |

MIM involves reconstructing masked regions of input images using their unmasked portions. A notable subset of MIM methodologies employs discrete tokens as the reconstruction target, but the theoretical underpinnings of this choice remain underexplored. In this paper, we explore the role of these discrete tokens, aiming to unravel their benefits and limitations. Building upon the connection between MIM and contrastive learning, we provide a comprehensive theoretical understanding on how discrete tokenization affects the model's generalization capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a novel metric named TCAS, which is specifically designed to assess the effectiveness of discrete tokens within the MIM framework. Inspired by this metric, we contribute an innovative tokenizer design and propose a corresponding MIM method named ClusterMIM. It demonstrates superior performance on a variety of benchmark datasets and ViT backbones. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/PKU-ML/ClusterMIM}. | Tianqi Du, Yifei Wang, Yisen Wang |  |
| 299 |  |  [The Consensus Game: Language Model Generation via Equilibrium Search](https://openreview.net/forum?id=n9xeGcI4Yg) |  | 0 | When applied to question answering and other text generation tasks, language models (LMs) may be queried generatively (by sampling answers from their output distribution) or discriminatively (by using them to score or rank a set of candidate answers). These procedures sometimes yield very different predictions. How do we reconcile mutually incompatible scoring procedures to obtain coherent LM predictions? We introduce a new, a training-free, game-theoretic procedure for language model decoding. Our approach casts language model decoding as a regularized imperfect-information sequential signaling game—which we term the concensus game—in which a generator seeks to communicate an abstract correctness parameter using natural language sentences to a discriminator. We develop computational procedures for finding approximate equilibria of this game, resulting in a decoding algorithm we call equilibrium-ranking. Applied to a large number of tasks (including reading comprehension, commonsense reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, and assistive dialog), equilibrium-ranking consistently improves performance over existing LM decoding procedures. These improvements are sometimes substantial—on multiple benchmarks, we observe that applying equilibrium-ranking to LLaMA-7B outperforms the much larger LLaMA-65B and PaLM-540B models. | Athul Paul Jacob, Yikang Shen, Gabriele Farina, Jacob Andreas |  |
| 300 |  |  [AMAGO: Scalable In-Context Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Agents](https://openreview.net/forum?id=M6XWoEdmwf) |  | 0 | We introduce AMAGO, an in-context Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent that uses sequence models to tackle the challenges of generalization, long-term memory, and meta-learning. Recent works have shown that off-policy learning can make in-context RL with recurrent policies viable. Nonetheless, these approaches require extensive tuning and limit scalability by creating key bottlenecks in agents' memory capacity, planning horizon, and model size. AMAGO revisits and redesigns the off-policy in-context approach to successfully train long-sequence Transformers over entire rollouts in parallel with end-to-end RL. Our agent is scalable and applicable to a wide range of problems, and we demonstrate its strong performance empirically in meta-RL and long-term memory domains. AMAGO's focus on sparse rewards and off-policy data also allows in-context learning to extend to goal-conditioned problems with challenging exploration. When combined with a multi-goal hindsight relabeling scheme, AMAGO can solve a previously difficult category of open-world domains, where agents complete many possible instructions in procedurally generated environments. | Jake Grigsby, Linxi Fan, Yuke Zhu |  |
| 301 |  |  [PILOT: An $\mathcal{O}(1/K)$-Convergent Approach for Policy Evaluation with Nonlinear Function Approximation](https://openreview.net/forum?id=OkHHJcMroY) |  | 0 | Learning an accurate value function for a given policy is a critical step in solving reinforcement learning (RL) problems. So far, however, the convergence speed and sample complexity performances of most existing policy evaluation algorithms remain unsatisfactory, particularly with non-linear function approximation. This challenge motivates us to develop a new path-integrated primal-dual stochastic gradient (PILOT) method, that is able to achieve a fast convergence speed for RL policy evaluation with nonlinear function approximation. To further alleviate the periodic full gradient evaluation requirement, we further propose an enhanced method with an adaptive-batch adjustment called PILOT$^+$. The main advantages of our methods include: i) PILOT allows the use of {\em{constant}} step sizes and achieves the $\mathcal{O}(1/K)$ convergence rate to first-order stationary points of non-convex policy evaluation problems; ii) PILOT is a generic {\em{single}}-timescale algorithm that is also applicable for solving a large class of non-convex strongly-concave minimax optimization problems; iii) By adaptively adjusting the batch size via historical stochastic gradient information, PILOT$^+$ is more sample-efficient empirically without loss of theoretical convergence rate. Our extensive numerical experiments verify our theoretical findings and showcase the high efficiency of the proposed PILOT and PILOT$^+$ algorithms compared with the state-of-the-art methods. | Zhuqing Liu, Xin Zhang, Jia Liu, Zhengyuan Zhu, Songtao Lu |  |
| 302 |  |  [Confronting Reward Model Overoptimization with Constrained RLHF](https://openreview.net/forum?id=gkfUvn0fLU) |  | 0 | Large language models are typically aligned with human preferences by optimizing reward models (RMs) fitted to human feedback. However, human preferences are multi-faceted, and it is increasingly common to derive reward from a composition of simpler reward models which each capture a different aspect of language quality. This itself presents a challenge, as it is difficult to appropriately weight these component RMs when combining them. Compounding this difficulty, because any RM is only a proxy for human evaluation, this process is vulnerable to \*overoptimization\*, wherein past a certain point, accumulating higher reward is associated with worse human ratings. In this paper, we perform the first study on overoptimization in composite RMs, showing that correlation between component RMs has a significant effect on the locations of these points. We then introduce an approach to solve this issue using constrained reinforcement learning as a means of preventing the agent from exceeding each RM's threshold of usefulness. Our method addresses the problem of weighting component RMs by learning dynamic weights, naturally given by the Lagrange multipliers. As a result, each RM stays within the range at which it is an effective proxy, improving evaluation performance. Finally, we introduce an adaptive method using gradient-free optimization to identify and optimize towards these points during a single run. | Ted Moskovitz, Aaditya K.

| 303 |  |  [LiDAR: Sensing Linear Probing Performance in Joint Embedding SSL Architectures](https://openreview.net/forum?id=f3g5XpL9Kb) |  | 0 | Joint embedding (JE) architectures have emerged as a promising avenue for ac- quiring transferable data representations. A key obstacle to using JE methods, however, is the inherent challenge of evaluating learned representations without access to a downstream task, and an annotated dataset. Without efficient and re- liable evaluation, it is difficult to iterate on architectural and training choices for JE methods. In this paper, we introduce LiDAR (Linear Discriminant Analysis Rank), a metric designed to measure the quality of representations within JE archi- tectures. Our metric addresses several shortcomings of recent approaches based on feature covariance rank by discriminating between informative and uninforma- tive features. In essence, LiDAR quantifies the rank of the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) matrix associated with the surrogate SSL task—a measure that intuitively captures the information content as it pertains to solving the SSL task. We empirically demonstrate that LiDAR significantly surpasses naive rank based approaches in its predictive power of optimal hyperparameters. Our proposed cri- terion presents a more robust and intuitive means of assessing the quality of rep- resentations within JE architectures, which we hope facilitates broader adoption of these powerful techniques in various domains. | Vimal Thilak, Chen Huang, Omid Saremi, Laurent Dinh, Hanlin Goh, Preetum Nakkiran, Joshua M.

| 304 |  |  [Improved Efficiency Based on Learned Saccade and Continuous Scene Reconstruction From Foveated Visual Sampling](https://openreview.net/forum?id=lOwkOIUJtx) |  | 0 | High accuracy, low latency and high energy efficiency represent a set of contradictory goals when searching for system solutions for image classification and detection. While high-quality images naturally result in more precise detection and classification, they also result in a heavier computational workload for imaging and processing, reduce camera refresh rates, and increase the volume of data communication between the camera and processor. Taking inspiration from the foveal-peripheral sampling mechanism, saccade mechanism observed in the human visual system and the filling-in phenomena of brain, we have developed an active scene reconstruction architecture based on multiple foveal views. This model stitches together information from foveal and peripheral vision, which are sampled from multiple glances. Assisted by a reinforcement learning-based saccade mechanism, our model reduces the required input pixels by over 90\% per frame while maintaining the same level of performance in image recognition as with the original images. We evaluated the effectiveness of our model using the GTSRB dataset and the ImageNet dataset. Using an equal number of input pixels, our study demonstrates a 5\% higher image recognition accuracy compared to state-of-the-art foveal-peripheral vision systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our foveal sampling/saccadic scene reconstruction model exhibits significantly lower complexity and higher data efficiency during the training phase compared to existing approaches. | Jiayang Liu, Yiming Bu, Daniel Tso, Qinru Qiu |  |
| 305 |  |  [Overthinking the Truth: Understanding how Language Models Process False Demonstrations](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Tigr1kMDZy) |  | 0 | Modern language models can imitate complex patterns through few-shot learning, enabling them to complete challenging tasks without fine-tuning. However, imitation can also lead models to reproduce inaccuracies or harmful content if present in the context. We study harmful imitation through the lens of a model’s internal representations, and identify two related phenomena: overthinking and false induction heads. The first phenomenon, overthinking, appears when we decode predictions from intermediate layers, given correct vs. incorrect few-shot demonstrations. At early layers, both demonstrations induce similar model behavior, but the behavior diverges sharply at some “critical layer”, after which the accuracy given incorrect demonstrations progressively decreases. The second phenomenon, false induction heads, are a possible mechanistic cause of overthinking: these are heads in late layers that attend to and copy false information from previous demonstrations, and whose ablation reduces overthinking. Beyond scientific understanding, our results suggest that studying intermediate model computations could be a promising avenue for understanding and guarding against harmful model behaviors. | Danny Halawi, JeanStanislas Denain, Jacob Steinhardt |  |
| 306 |  |  [MT-Ranker: Reference-free machine translation evaluation by inter-system ranking](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Rry1SeSOQL) |  | 0 | Traditionally, Machine Translation (MT) Evaluation has been treated as a regression problem -- producing an absolute translation-quality score. This approach has two limitations: i) the scores lack interpretability, and human annotators struggle with giving consistent scores; ii) most scoring methods are based on (reference, translation) pairs, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios where references are absent. In practice, we often care about whether a new MT system is better or worse than some competitors. In addition, reference-free MT evaluation is increasingly practical and necessary. Unfortunately, these two practical considerations have yet to be jointly explored. In this work, we formulate the reference-free MT evaluation into a pairwise ranking problem. Given the source sentence and a pair of translations, our system predicts which translation is better. In addition to proposing this new formulation, we further show that this new paradigm can demonstrate superior correlation with human judgments by merely using indirect supervision from natural language inference and weak supervision from our synthetic data. In the context of reference-free evaluation, MT-Ranker, trained without any human annotations, achieves state-of-the-art results on the WMT Shared Metrics Task benchmarks DARR20, MQM20, and MQM21. On a more challenging benchmark, ACES, which contains fine-grained evaluation criteria such as addition, omission, and mistranslation errors, MT-Ranker marks state-of-the-art against reference-free as well as reference-based baselines. | Ibraheem Muhammad Moosa, Rui Zhang, Wenpeng Yin |  |
| 307 |  |  [MuSR: Testing the Limits of Chain-of-thought with Multistep Soft Reasoning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=jenyYQzue1) |  | 0 | While large language models (LLMs) equipped with techniques like chain-of-thought prompting have demonstrated impressive capabilities, they still fall short in their ability to reason robustly in complex settings. However, evaluating LLM reasoning is challenging because system capabilities continue to grow while benchmark datasets for tasks like logical deduction have remained static. We introduce MuSR, a dataset for evaluating language models on multistep soft reasoning tasks specified in a natural language narrative. This dataset has two crucial features. First, it is created through a novel neurosymbolic synthetic-to-natural generation algorithm, enabling the construction of complex reasoning instances that challenge GPT-4 (e.g., murder mysteries roughly 1000 words in length) and which can be scaled further as more capable LLMs are released. Second, our data instances are free text narratives corresponding to real-world domains of reasoning; this makes it simultaneously much more challenging than other synthetically-crafted benchmarks while remaining realistic and tractable for human annotators to solve with high accuracy. We evaluate a range of LLMs and prompting techniques on this dataset and characterize the gaps that remain for techniques like chain-of-thought to perform robust reasoning. | Zayne Sprague, Xi Ye, Kaj Bostrom, Swarat Chaudhuri, Greg Durrett |  |
| 308 |  |  [Harnessing Density Ratios for Online Reinforcement Learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=THJEa8adBn) |  | 0 | The theories of offline and online reinforcement learning, despite having evolved in parallel, have begun to show signs of the possibility for a unification, with algorithms and analysis techniques for one setting often having natural counterparts in the other. However, the notion of \*density ratio modeling\*, an emerging paradigm in offline RL, has been largely absent from online RL, perhaps for good reason: the very existence and boundedness of density ratios relies on access to an exploratory dataset with good coverage, but the core challenge in online RL is to collect such a dataset without having one to start. In this work we show---perhaps surprisingly---that density ratio-based algorithms have online counterparts. Assuming only the existence of an exploratory distribution with good coverage, a structural condition known as \*coverability\* (Xie et al., 2023), we give a new algorithm (GLOW) that uses density ratio realizability and value function realizability to perform sample-efficient online exploration. GLOW addresses unbounded density ratios via careful use of truncation, and combines this with optimism to guide exploration. GLOW is computationally inefficient; we complement it with a more efficient counterpart, HyGLOW, for the Hybrid RL setting (Song et al., 2023) wherein online RL is augmented with additional offline data. HyGLOW is derived as a special case of a more general meta-algorithm that provides a provable black-box reduction from hybrid RL to offline RL, which may be of independent interest. | Philip Amortila, Dylan J.

This requires estimates of both the learner's progress ("knowledge tracing"; KT), and the prerequisite structure of the learning domain ("knowledge mapping"). While recent deep learning models achieve high KT accuracy, they do so at the expense of the interpretability of psychologically-inspired models. In this work, we present a solution to this trade-off. PSI-KT is a hierarchical generative approach that explicitly models how both individual cognitive traits and the prerequisite structure of knowledge influence learning dynamics, thus achieving interpretability by design. Moreover, by using scalable Bayesian inference, PSI-KT targets the real-world need for efficient personalization even with a growing body of learners and interaction data. Evaluated on three datasets from online learning platforms, PSI-KT achieves superior multi-step \*\*p\*\*redictive accuracy and \*\*s\*\*calable inference in continual-learning settings, all while providing \*\*i\*\*nterpretable representations of learner-specific traits and the prerequisite structure of knowledge that causally supports learning. In sum, predictive, scalable and interpretable knowledge tracing with solid knowledge mapping lays a key foundation for effective personalized learning to make education accessible to a broad, global audience. | Hanqi Zhou, Robert Bamler, Charley M.

| 310 |  |  [From Bricks to Bridges: Product of Invariances to Enhance Latent Space Communication](https://openreview.net/forum?id=vngVydDWft) |  | 0 | It has been observed that representations learned by distinct neural networks conceal structural similarities when the models are trained under similar inductive biases. From a geometric perspective, identifying the classes of transformations and the related invariances that connect these representations is fundamental to unlocking applications, such as merging, stitching, and reusing different neural modules. However, estimating task-specific transformations a priori can be challenging and expensive due to several factors (e.g., weights initialization, training hyperparameters, or data modality). To this end, we introduce a versatile method to directly incorporate a set of invariances into the representations, constructing a product space of invariant components on top of the latent representations without requiring prior knowledge about the optimal invariance to infuse. We validate our solution on classification and reconstruction tasks, observing consistent latent similarity and downstream performance improvements in a zero-shot stitching setting. The experimental analysis comprises three modalities (vision, text, and graphs), twelve pretrained foundational models, nine benchmarks, and several architectures trained from scratch. | Irene Cannistraci, Luca Moschella, Marco Fumero, Valentino Maiorca, Emanuele Rodolà |  |

Quality Diversity Reinforcement Learning (QD-RL) is an emerging research area that blends the best aspects of both fields – Quality Diversity (QD) provides a principled form of exploration and produces collections of behaviorally diverse agents, while Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a powerful performance improvement operator enabling generalization across tasks and dynamic environments. Existing QD-RL approaches have been constrained to sample efficient, deterministic off- policy RL algorithms and/or evolution strategies and struggle with highly stochastic environments. In this work, we, for the first time, adapt on-policy RL, specifically Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), to the Differentiable Quality Diversity (DQD) framework and propose several changes that enable efficient optimization and discovery of novel skills on high-dimensional, stochastic robotics tasks. Our new algorithm, Proximal Policy Gradient Arborescence (PPGA), achieves state-of- the-art results, including a 4x improvement in best reward over baselines on the challenging humanoid domain. | Sumeet Batra, Bryon Tjanaka, Matthew Christopher Fontaine, Aleksei Petrenko, Stefanos Nikolaidis, Gaurav S.

This paper investigates the memorization abilities of multi-head attention mechanisms, examining how many example sequences they can memorize, as a function of the number of heads and sequence length. Motivated by experimental findings on vision transformers, we introduce novel assumptions about the linear independence of input data, distinct from the commonly used general-position assumption. Under these assumptions, we demonstrate that an attention layer with $H$ heads, dimension $d$, and context size $n < d,$ featuring $\Theta(Hd^2)$ parameters, can memorize $\Omega(Hn)$ examples. Our analysis sheds light on how different attention heads handle various example sequences, aided by the softmax operator’s saturation property. We validate our findings through experiments on synthetic data. | Sadegh Mahdavi, Renjie Liao, Christos Thrampoulidis |  |
| 313 |  |  [Circuit Component Reuse Across Tasks in Transformer Language Models](https://openreview.net/forum?id=fpoAYV6Wsk) |  | 0 | Recent work in mechanistic interpretability has shown that behaviors in language models can be successfully reverse-engineered through circuit analysis. A common criticism, however, is that each circuit is task-specific, and thus such analysis cannot contribute to understanding the models at a higher level. In this work, we present evidence that insights (both low-level findings about specific heads and higher-level findings about general algorithms) can indeed generalize across tasks. Specifically, we study the circuit discovered in (Wang, 2022) for the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) task and 1.) show that it reproduces on a larger GPT2 model, and 2.) that it is mostly reused to solve a seemingly different task: Colored Objects (Ippolito & Callison-Burch, 2023). We provide evidence that the process underlying both tasks is functionally very similar, and contains about a 78% overlap in in-circuit attention heads. We further present a proof-of-concept intervention experiment, in which we adjust four attention heads in middle layers in order to ‘repair’ the Colored Objects circuit and make it behave like the IOI circuit. In doing so, we boost accuracy from 49.6% to 93.7% on the Colored Objects task and explain most sources of error. The intervention affects downstream attention heads in specific ways predicted by their interactions in the IOI circuit, indicating that this subcircuit behavior is invariant to the different task inputs. Overall, our results provide evidence that it may yet be possible to explain large language models' behavior in terms of a relatively small number of interpretable task-general algorithmic building blocks and computational components. | Jack Merullo, Carsten Eickhoff, Ellie Pavlick |  |

In this work, we show that they can also be excellent likelihood models, so long as we overcome a fundamental difficulty with probabilistic multi-scale models: the intractability of the likelihood function. Chiefly, in cascaded models each intermediary scale introduces extraneous variables that cannot be tractably marginalized out for likelihood evaluation. This issue vanishes by modeling the diffusion process on latent spaces induced by a class of transformations we call hierarchical volume-preserving maps, which decompose spatially structured data in a hierarchical fashion without introducing local distortions in the latent space. We demonstrate that two such maps are well-known in the literature for multiscale modeling: Laplacian pyramids and wavelet transforms. Not only do such reparameterizations allow the likelihood function to be directly expressed as a joint likelihood over the scales, we show that the Laplacian pyramid and wavelet transform also produces significant improvements to the state-of-the-art on a selection of benchmarks in likelihood modeling, including density estimation, lossless compression, and out-of-distribution detection. Investigating the theoretical basis of our empirical gains we uncover deep connections to score matching under the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), which is a well-known surrogate for perceptual similarity. | Henry Li, Ronen Basri, Yuval Kluger |  |

Unlike machine learning, there is no perfect analogue of cross-validation for model selection as we do not observe the counterfactual potential outcomes. Towards this, a variety of surrogate metrics have been proposed for CATE model selection that use only observed data. However, we do not have a good understanding regarding their effectiveness due to limited comparisons in prior studies. We conduct an extensive empirical analysis to benchmark the surrogate model selection metrics introduced in the literature, as well as the novel ones introduced in this work. We ensure a fair comparison by tuning the hyperparameters associated with these metrics via AutoML, and provide more detailed trends by incorporating realistic datasets via generative modeling. Our analysis suggests novel model selection strategies based on careful hyperparameter selection of CATE estimators and causal ensembling. | Divyat Mahajan, Ioannis Mitliagkas, Brady Neal, Vasilis Syrgkanis |  |

In this paper, we propose to proactively generate a cryptographic certificate of privacy during training to forego such auditing limitations. We introduce Confidential-DPproof , a framework for Confidential Proof of Differentially Private Training, which enhances training with a certificate of the $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-DP guarantee achieved. To obtain this certificate without revealing information about the training data or model, we design a customized zero-knowledge proof protocol tailored to the requirements introduced by differentially private training, including random noise addition and privacy amplification by subsampling. In experiments on CIFAR-10, Confidential-DPproof trains a model achieving state-of-the-art $91$% test accuracy with a certified privacy guarantee of $(\varepsilon=0.55,\delta=10^{-5})$-DP in approximately 100 hours. | Ali Shahin Shamsabadi, Gefei Tan, Tudor Cebere, Aurélien Bellet, Hamed Haddadi, Nicolas Papernot, Xiao Wang, Adrian Weller |  |

We instead present IN-CONTEXT PRETRAINING, a new approach where language models are trained on a sequence of related documents, thereby explicitly encouraging them to read and reason across document boundaries. Our approach builds on the fact that current pipelines train by concatenating random sets of shorter documents to create longer context windows; this improves efficiency even though the prior documents provide no signal for predicting the next document. Given this fact, we can do IN-CONTEXT PRETRAINING by simply changing the document ordering so that each context contains related documents, and directly applying existing pretraining pipelines. However, this document sorting problem is challenging. There are billions of documents and we would like the sort to maximize contextual similarity for every document without repeating any data. To do this, we introduce approximate algorithms for finding related documents with efficient nearest neighbor search and constructing coherent batches with a graph cover algorithm. Our experiments show IN-CONTEXT PRETRAINING offers a scalable and simple approach to significantly enhance LM performance: we see notable improvements in tasks that require more complex contextual reasoning, including in-context learning (+8%), reading comprehension (+15%), faithfulness to previous contexts (+16%), long-context reasoning (+5%), and retrieval augmentation (+9%). | Weijia Shi, Sewon Min, Maria Lomeli, Chunting Zhou, Margaret Li, Xi Victoria Lin, Noah A.

However, we have a limited understanding of the content of these corpora, including general statistics, quality, social factors, and inclusion of evaluation data (contamination). In this work, we propose What's In My Big Data? (WIMBD), a platform and a set of sixteen analyses that allow us to reveal and compare the contents of large text corpora. WIMBD builds on two basic capabilities---count and search---\*at scale\*, which allows us to analyze more than 35 terabytes on a standard compute node. We apply WIMBD to ten different corpora used to train popular language models, including \*C4\*, \*The Pile\*, and \*RedPajama\*. Our analysis uncovers several surprising and previously undocumented findings about these corpora, including the high prevalence of duplicate, synthetic, and low-quality content, personally identifiable information, toxic language, and benchmark contamination. For instance, we find that about 50% of the documents in \*RedPajama\* and \*LAION-2B-en\* are duplicates. In addition, several datasets used for benchmarking models trained on such corpora are contaminated with respect to important benchmarks, including the Winograd Schema Challenge and parts of GLUE and SuperGLUE. We open-source WIMBD's code and artifacts to provide a standard set of evaluations for new text-based corpora and to encourage more analyses and transparency around them. | Yanai Elazar, Akshita Bhagia, Ian Magnusson, Abhilasha Ravichander, Dustin Schwenk, Alane Suhr, Evan Pete Walsh, Dirk Groeneveld, Luca Soldaini, Sameer Singh, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, Noah A.

| 319 |  |  [On Diffusion Modeling for Anomaly Detection](https://openreview.net/forum?id=lR3rk7ysXz) |  | 0 | Known for their impressive performance in generative modeling, diffusion models are attractive candidates for density-based anomaly detection. This paper investigates different variations of diffusion modeling for unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection. In particular, we find that Denoising Diffusion Probability Models (DDPM) are performant on anomaly detection benchmarks yet computationally expensive. By simplifying DDPM in application to anomaly detection, we are naturally led to an alternative approach called Diffusion Time Estimation (DTE). DTE estimates the distribution over diffusion time for a given input and uses the mode or mean of this distribution as the anomaly score. We derive an analytical form for this density and leverage a deep neural network to improve inference efficiency. Through empirical evaluations on the ADBench benchmark, we demonstrate that all diffusion-based anomaly detection methods perform competitively for both semi-supervised and unsupervised settings. Notably, DTE achieves orders of magnitude faster inference time than DDPM, while outperforming it on this benchmark. These results establish diffusion-based anomaly detection as a scalable alternative to traditional methods and recent deep-learning techniques for standard unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection settings. | Victor Livernoche, Vineet Jain, Yashar Hezaveh, Siamak Ravanbakhsh |  |

In the realm of text-conditioned image synthesis, the recent surge in progress has ushered in a collaborative era where users and AI systems coalesce to refine visual creations. This co-creative pro- cess in the landscape of online social networks empowers users to craft original visual artworks seeking for community validation. Nevertheless, assessing these models in the context of collective community preference introduces distinct chal- lenges. Existing evaluation methods predominantly center on limited size user studies guided by image quality and alignment with prompts. This work pio- neers a paradigm shift, unveiling Social Reward - an innovative reward modeling framework that leverages implicit feedback from social network users engaged in creative editing of generated images. We embark on an extensive journey of dataset curation and refinement, drawing from Picsart: an online visual creation and editing platform, yielding a first million-user-scale dataset of implicit human preferences for user-generated visual art named Picsart Image-Social. Our anal- ysis exposes the shortcomings of current metrics in modeling community creative preference of text-to-image models’ outputs, compelling us to introduce a novel predictive model explicitly tailored to address these limitations. Rigorous quan- titative experiments and user study show that our Social Reward model aligns better with social popularity than existing metrics. Furthermore, we utilize So- cial Reward to fine-tune text-to-image models, yielding images that are more fa- vored by not only Social Reward, but also other established metrics. These find- ings highlight the relevance and effectiveness of Social Reward in assessing com- munity appreciation for AI-generated artworks, establishing a closer alignment with users’ creative goals: creating popular visual art.

The superior performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on these tasks is widely attributed to the inductive bias of locality and weight sharing baked into their architecture. Existing attempts to quantify the statistical benefits of these biases in CNNs over locally connected convolutional neural networks (LCNs) and fully connected neural networks (FCNs) fall into one of the following categories: either they disregard the optimizer and only provide uniform convergence upper bounds with no separating lower bounds, or they consider simplistic tasks that do not truly mirror the locality and translation invariance as found in real-world vision tasks. To address these deficiencies, we introduce the Dynamic Signal Distribution (DSD) classification task that models an image as consisting of $k$ patches, each of dimension $d$, and the label is determined by a $d$-sparse signal vector that can freely appear in any one of the $k$ patches. On this task, for any orthogonally equivariant algorithm like gradient descent, we prove that CNNs require $\tilde{O}(k+d)$ samples, whereas LCNs require $\Omega(kd)$ samples, establishing the statistical advantages of weight sharing in translation invariant tasks. Furthermore, LCNs need $\tilde{O}(k(k+d))$ samples, compared to $\Omega(k^2d)$ samples for FCNs, showcasing the benefits of locality in local tasks. Additionally, we develop information theoretic tools for analyzing randomized algorithms, which may be of interest for statistical research. | Aakash Lahoti, Stefani Karp, Ezra Winston, Aarti Singh, Yuanzhi Li |  |

It achieves results comparable to AdamW but with greater memory efficiency. As what we can expect from the result of the random search, Lion blends a number of elements from existing algorithms, including signed momentum, decoupled weight decay, Polayk and Nesterov momentum, but doesn't fit into any existing category of theoretically grounded optimizers. Thus, even though Lion appears to perform well as a general-purpose optimizer for a wide range of tasks, its theoretical basis remains uncertain. This absence of theoretical clarity limits opportunities to further enhance and expand Lion's efficacy. This work aims to demystify Lion. Using both continuous-time and discrete-time analysis, we demonstrate that Lion is a novel and theoretically grounded approach for minimizing a general loss function $f(x)$ while enforcing a bound constraint $\|\|x\|\|_\infty \leq 1/\lambda$. Lion achieves this through the incorporation of decoupled weight decay, where $\lambda$ represents the weight decay coefficient. Our analysis is facilitated by the development of a new Lyapunov function for the Lion updates. It applies to a wide range of Lion-$\phi$ algorithms, where the $sign(\cdot)$ operator in Lion is replaced by the subgradient of a convex function $\phi$, leading to the solution of the general composite optimization problem $\min_x f(x) + \phi^\*(x)$. Our findings provide valuable insights into the dynamics of Lion and pave the way for further enhancements and extensions of Lion-related algorithms. | Lizhang Chen, Bo Liu, Kaizhao Liang, Qiang Liu |  |

We present Prospect, a stochastic gradient-based algorithm that only requires tuning a single learning rate hyperparameter, and prove that it enjoys linear convergence for smooth regularized losses. This contrasts with previous algorithms that either require tuning multiple hyperparameters or potentially fail to converge due to biased gradient estimates or inadequate regularization. Empirically, we show that Prospect can converge 2-3x faster than baselines such as SGD and stochastic saddle-point methods on distribution shift and fairness benchmarks spanning tabular, vision, and language domains. | Ronak Mehta, Vincent Roulet, Krishna Pillutla, Zaïd Harchaoui |  |

It is natural to wonder how well these models adapt to genuinely new tasks, but how does one find tasks that are unseen in internet-scale training sets? We turn to a field that is explicitly motivated and bottlenecked by a scarcity of web data: low-resource languages. In this paper, we introduce MTOB (Machine Translation from One Book), a benchmark for learning to translate between English and Kalamang—a language with less than 200 speakers and therefore virtually no presence on the web—using several hundred pages of field linguistics reference materials. This task framing is novel in that it asks a model to learn a language from a single human-readable book of grammar explanations, rather than a large mined corpus of in-domain data, more akin to L2 language learning than L1 language acquisition. We demonstrate that baselines using current LLMs are promising but fall short of human performance, achieving 44.7 chrF on Kalamang to English translation and 45.8 chrF on English to Kalamang translation, compared to 51.6 and 57.0 chrF by a human who learned Kalamang from the same reference materials. We hope that MTOB will help measure LLM capabilities along a new dimension, and that the methods developed to solve it could help expand access to language technology for underserved communities by leveraging qualitatively different kinds of data than traditional machine translation. | Garrett Tanzer, Mirac Suzgun, Eline Visser, Dan Jurafsky, Luke MelasKyriazi |  |
| 325 |  |  [Improving Offline RL by Blending Heuristics](https://openreview.net/forum?id=MCl0TLboP1) |  | 0 | We propose \*\*H\*\*e\*\*u\*\*ristic \*\*Bl\*\*ending (HUBL), a simple performance-improving technique for a broad class of offline RL algorithms based on value bootstrapping. HUBL modifies the Bellman operators used in these algorithms, partially replacing the bootstrapped values with heuristic ones that are estimated with Monte-Carlo returns. For trajectories with higher returns, HUBL relies more on the heuristic values and less on bootstrapping; otherwise, it leans more heavily on bootstrapping. HUBL is very easy to combine with many existing offline RL implementations by relabeling the offline datasets with adjusted rewards and discount factors. We derive a theory that explains HUBL's effect on offline RL as reducing offline RL's complexity and thus increasing its finite-sample performance. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that HUBL consistently improves the policy quality of four state-of-the-art bootstrapping-based offline RL algorithms (ATAC, CQL, TD3+BC, and IQL), by 9% on average over 27 datasets of the D4RL and Meta-World benchmarks. | Sinong Geng, Aldo Pacchiano, Andrey Kolobov, ChingAn Cheng |  |

In offline reinforcement learning (RL), Decision Transformer (DT) is emerging as a promising model based on Transformer. However, we discovered that the attention module of DT is not appropriate to capture the inherent local dependence pattern in trajectories of RL modeled as a Markov decision process. To overcome the limitations of DT, we propose a novel action sequence predictor, named Decision ConvFormer (DC), based on the architecture of MetaFormer, which is a general structure to process multiple entities in parallel and understand the interrelationship among the multiple entities. DC employs local convolution filtering as the token mixer and can effectively capture the inherent local associations of the RL dataset. In extensive experiments, DC achieved state-of-the-art performance across various standard RL benchmarks while requiring fewer resources. Furthermore, we show that DC better understands the underlying meaning in data and exhibits enhanced generalization capability. | Jeonghye Kim, Suyoung Lee, Woojun Kim, Youngchul Sung |  |

In this paper, we study ICL in one of its simplest setups: pretraining a single-layer linear attention model for linear regression with a Gaussian prior. We establish a statistical task complexity bound for the attention model pretraining, showing that effective pretraining only requires a small number of independent tasks. Furthermore, we prove that the pretrained model closely matches the Bayes optimal algorithm, i.e., optimally tuned ridge regression, by achieving nearly Bayes optimal risk on unseen tasks under a fixed context length. These theoretical findings complement prior experimental research and shed light on the statistical foundations of ICL. | Jingfeng Wu, Difan Zou, Zixiang Chen, Vladimir Braverman, Quanquan Gu, Peter L.

While conventional reward models (RMs) have exhibited remarkable scalability, they oft struggle with fundamental functionality such as arithmetic computation, code execution, and factual lookup. In this paper, we propose a tool-augmented preference modeling approach, named Themis, to address these limitations by empowering RMs with access to external environments, including calculators and search engines. This approach not only fosters synergy between tool utilization and reward grading but also enhances interpretive capacity and scoring reliability. Our study delves into the integration of external tools into RMs, enabling them to interact with diverse external sources and construct task-specific tool engagement and reasoning traces in an autoregressive manner. We validate our approach across a wide range of domains, incorporating seven distinct external tools. Our experimental results demonstrate a noteworthy overall improvement of 17.7% across eight tasks in preference ranking. Furthermore, our approach outperforms Gopher 280B by 7.3% on TruthfulQA task in zero-shot evaluation. In human evaluations, RLHF trained with Themis attains an average win rate of 32% when compared to baselines across four distinct tasks. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive collection of tool-related RM datasets, incorporating data from seven distinct tool APIs, totaling 15,000 instances. We have made the code, data, and model checkpoints publicly available to facilitate and inspire further research advancements (https://github.com/ernie-research/Tool-Augmented-Reward-Model). | Lei Li, Yekun Chai, Shuohuan Wang, Yu Sun, Hao Tian, Ningyu Zhang, Hua Wu |  |
| 329 |  |  [Reward-Consistent Dynamics Models are Strongly Generalizable for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=GSBHKiw19c) |  | 0 | Learning a precise dynamics model can be crucial for offline reinforcement learning, which, unfortunately, has been found to be quite challenging. Dynamics models that are learned by fitting historical transitions often struggle to generalize to unseen transitions. In this study, we identify a hidden but pivotal factor termed dynamics reward that remains consistent across transitions, offering a pathway to better generalization. Therefore, we propose the idea of reward-consistent dynamics models: any trajectory generated by the dynamics model should maximize the dynamics reward derived from the data. We implement this idea as the MOREC (Model-based Offline reinforcement learning with Reward Consistency) method, which can be seamlessly integrated into previous offline model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) methods. MOREC learns a generalizable dynamics reward function from offline data, which is subsequently employed as a transition filter in any offline MBRL method: when generating transitions, the dynamics model generates a batch of transitions and selects the one with the highest dynamics reward value. On a synthetic task, we visualize that MOREC has a strong generalization ability and can surprisingly recover some distant unseen transitions. On 21 offline tasks in D4RL and NeoRL benchmarks, MOREC improves the previous state-of-the-art performance by a significant margin, i.e., 4.6\% on D4RL tasks and 25.9\% on NeoRL tasks. Notably, MOREC is the first method that can achieve above 95\% online RL performance in 6 out of 12 D4RL tasks and 3 out of 9 NeoRL tasks.

We introduce two algorithms that achieve improved regret performance compared to existing approaches. The first algorithm, although computationally inefficient, achieves a regret of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{K})$ without relying on simulators, where $K$ is the number of episodes. This is the first rate-optimal result in the considered setting. The second algorithm is computationally efficient and achieves a regret of $\widetilde{O}(K^{\frac{3}{4}})$ . These results significantly improve over the prior state-of-the-art: a computationally inefficient algorithm by Kong et al. (2023) with $\widetilde{O}(K^{\frac{4}{5}}+1/\lambda_{\min})$ regret, and a computationally efficient algorithm by Sherman et al. (2023b) with $\widetilde{O}(K^{\frac{6}{7}})$ regret. | Haolin Liu, ChenYu Wei, Julian Zimmert |  |
| 331 |  |  [Dual RL: Unification and New Methods for Reinforcement and Imitation Learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=xt9Bu66rqv) |  | 0 | The goal of reinforcement learning (RL) is to find a policy that maximizes the expected cumulative return. It has been shown that this objective can be represented as an optimization problem of state-action visitation distribution under linear constraints. The dual problem of this formulation, which we refer to as \*dual RL\*, is unconstrained and easier to optimize. In this work, we first cast several state-of-the-art offline RL and offline imitation learning (IL) algorithms as instances of dual RL approaches with shared structures. Such unification allows us to identify the root cause of the shortcomings of prior methods. For offline IL, our analysis shows that prior methods are based on a restrictive coverage assumption that greatly limits their performance in practice. To fix this limitation, we propose a new discriminator-free method ReCOIL that learns to imitate from arbitrary off-policy data to obtain near-expert performance. For offline RL, our analysis frames a recent offline RL method XQL in the dual framework, and we further propose a new method $f$-DVL that provides alternative choices to the Gumbel regression loss that fixes the known training instability issue of XQL. The performance improvements by both of our proposed methods, ReCOIL and $f$-DVL, in IL and RL are validated on an extensive suite of simulated robot locomotion and manipulation tasks. | Harshit Sikchi, Qinqing Zheng, Amy Zhang, Scott Niekum |  |
| 332 |  |  [Out-Of-Domain Unlabeled Data Improves Generalization](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bo6GpQ3B9a) |  | 0 | We propose a novel framework for incorporating unlabeled data into semi-supervised classification problems, where scenarios involving the minimization of either i) adversarially robust or ii) non-robust loss functions have been considered. Notably, we allow the unlabeled samples to deviate slightly (in total variation sense) from the in-domain distribution. The core idea behind our framework is to combine Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) with self-supervised training. As a result, we also leverage efficient polynomial-time algorithms for the training stage. From a theoretical standpoint, we apply our framework on the classification problem of a mixture of two Gaussians in $\mathbb{R}^d$, where in addition to the $m$ independent and labeled samples from the true distribution, a set of $n$ (usually with $n\gg m$) out of domain and unlabeled samples are gievn as well. Using only the labeled data, it is known that the generalization error can be bounded by $\propto\left(d/m\right)^{1/2}$. However, using our method on both isotropic and non-isotropic Gaussian mixture models, one can derive a new set of analytically explicit and non-asymptotic bounds which show substantial improvement on the generalization error compared ERM. Our results underscore two significant insights: 1) out-of-domain samples, even when unlabeled, can be harnessed to narrow the generalization gap, provided that the true data distribution adheres to a form of the "cluster assumption", and 2) the semi-supervised learning paradigm can be regarded as a special case of our framework when there are no distributional shifts. We validate our claims through experiments conducted on a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets. | Seyed Amir Hossein Saberi, Amir Najafi, Alireza Heidari, Mohammad Hosein Movasaghinia, Abolfazl S.

Extensive efforts have been made before model release to align their behavior with human values, with the primary goal of ensuring their helpfulness and harmlessness. However, even carefully aligned models can be manipulated maliciously, leading to unintended behaviors, known as \`\`jailbreaks". These jailbreaks are typically triggered by specific text inputs, often referred to as adversarial prompts. In this work, we propose the generation exploitation attack, an extremely simple approach that disrupts model alignment by only manipulating variations of decoding methods. By exploiting different generation strategies, including varying decoding hyper-parameters and sampling methods, we increase the attack success rate from $0\%$ to more than $95\%$ across 11 language models including LLaMA2, Vicuna, Falcon, and MPT families, outperforming state-of-the-art attacks with $30\times$ lower computational cost. Finally, we propose an effective alignment method that explores diverse generation strategies, which can reasonably reduce the attack success rate under our attack. Altogether, our study underscores a major failure in current safety evaluation and alignment procedures for open-source LLMs, strongly advocating for more comprehensive red teaming and better alignment before releasing such models. | Yangsibo Huang, Samyak Gupta, Mengzhou Xia, Kai Li, Danqi Chen |  |

However, the existing GCL technique has inherent smooth characteristics because of its low-pass GNN encoder and objective based on homophily assumption, which poses a challenge when applying it to heterophilic graphs. In supervised learning tasks, spectral GNNs with polynomial approximation excel in both homophilic and heterophilic settings by adaptively fitting graph filters of arbitrary shapes. Yet, their applications in unsupervised learning are rarely explored. Based on the above analysis, a natural question arises: Can we incorporate the excellent properties of spectral polynomial filters into graph contrastive learning? In this paper, we address the question by studying the necessity of introducing high-pass information for heterophily from a spectral perspective. We propose PolyGCL, a GCL pipeline that utilizes polynomial filters to achieve contrastive learning between the low-pass and high-pass views. Specifically, PolyGCL utilizes polynomials with learnable filter functions to generate different spectral views and an objective that incorporates high-pass information through a linear combination. We theoretically prove that PolyGCL outperforms previous GCL paradigms when applied to graphs with varying levels of homophily. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, which demonstrate the promising performance of PolyGCL on homophilic and heterophilic graphs. | Jingyu Chen, Runlin Lei, Zhewei Wei |  |

However, these methods have not been successful in addressing both homogeneous and heterogeneous tasks simultaneously which is a crucial aspect for the practical application of cooperative agents. On one hand, value decomposition methods demonstrate superior performance in homogeneous tasks. Nevertheless, they tend to produce agents with similar policies, which is unsuitable for heterogeneous tasks. On the other hand, solutions based on personalized observation or assigned roles are well-suited for heterogeneous tasks. However, they often lead to a trade-off situation where the agent's performance in homogeneous scenarios is negatively affected due to the aggregation of distinct policies. An alternative approach is to adopt sequential execution policies, which offer a flexible form for learning both types of tasks. However, learning sequential execution policies poses challenges in terms of credit assignment, and the limited information about subsequently executed agents can lead to sub-optimal solutions, which is known as the relative over-generalization problem. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes Greedy Sequential Execution (GSE) as a solution to learn the optimal policy that covers both scenarios. In the proposed GSE framework, we introduce an individual utility function into the framework of value decomposition to consider the complex interactions between agents. This function is capable of representing both the homogeneous and heterogeneous optimal policies. Furthermore, we utilize greedy marginal contribution calculated by the utility function as the credit value of the sequential execution policy to address the credit assignment and relative over-generalization problem. We evaluated GSE in both homogeneous and heterogeneous scenarios. The results demonstrate that GSE achieves significant improvement in performance across multiple domains, especially in scenarios involving both homogeneous and heterogeneous tasks. | Shanqi Liu, Dong Xing, Pengjie Gu, Xinrun Wang, Bo An, Yong Liu |  |

In the same way that prior robotic systems have leveraged self-supervised techniques from computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP), our work builds on prior work showing that the reinforcement learning (RL) itself can be cast as a self-supervised problem: learning to reach any goal without human-specified rewards or labels. Despite the seeming appeal, little (if any) prior work has demonstrated how self-supervised RL methods can be practically deployed on robotic systems. By first studying a challenging simulated version of this task, we discover design decisions about architectures and hyperparameters that increase the success rate by $2 \times$. These findings lay the groundwork for our main result: we demonstrate that a self-supervised RL algorithm based on contrastive learning can solve real-world, image-based robotic manipulation tasks, with tasks being specified by a single goal image provided after training. | Chongyi Zheng, Benjamin Eysenbach, Homer Rich Walke, Patrick Yin, Kuan Fang, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Sergey Levine |  |

We allow a partially observed setting in which each view constitutes a nonlinear mixture of a subset of underlying latent variables, which can be causally related. We prove that the information shared across all subsets of any number of views can be learned up to a smooth bijection using contrastive learning and a single encoder per view. We also provide graphical criteria indicating which latent variables can be identified through a simple set of rules, which we refer to as identifiability algebra. Our general framework and theoretical results unify and extend several previous work on multi-view nonlinear ICA, disentanglement, and causal representation learning. We experimentally validate our claims on numerical, image, and multi-modal data sets. Further, we demonstrate that the performance of prior methods is recovered in different special cases of our setup. Overall, we find that access to multiple partial views offers unique opportunities for identifiable representation learning, enabling the discovery of latent structures from purely observational data. | Dingling Yao, Danru Xu, Sébastien Lachapelle, Sara Magliacane, Perouz Taslakian, Georg Martius, Julius von Kügelgen, Francesco Locatello |  |
| 338 |  |  [CABINET: Content Relevance-based Noise Reduction for Table Question Answering](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SQrHpTllXa) |  | 0 | Table understanding capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been extensively studied through the task of question-answering (QA) over tables. Typically, only a small part of the whole table is relevant to derive the answer for a given question. The irrelevant parts act as noise and are distracting information, resulting in sub-optimal performance due to the vulnerability of LLMs to noise. To mitigate this, we propose CABINET (Content RelevAnce-Based NoIse ReductioN for TablE QuesTion-Answering) – a framework to enable LLMs to focus on relevant tabular data by suppressing extraneous information. CABINET comprises an Unsupervised Relevance Scorer (URS), trained differentially with the QA LLM, that weighs the table content based on its relevance to the input question before feeding it to the question answering LLM (QA LLM). To further aid the relevance scorer, CABINET employs a weakly supervised module that generates a parsing statement describing the criteria of rows and columns relevant to the question and highlights the content of corresponding table cells. CABINET significantly outperforms various tabular LLM baselines, as well as GPT3-based in-context learning methods, is more robust to noise, maintains outperformance on tables of varying sizes, and establishes new SoTA performance on WikiTQ, FeTaQA, and WikiSQL datasets. We release our code and datasets here. | Sohan Patnaik, Heril Changwal, Milan Aggarwal, Sumit Bhatia, Yaman Kumar, Balaji Krishnamurthy |  |

However, the inherent tension between the objectives of helpfulness and harmlessness presents a significant challenge during LLM training. To address this issue, we propose Safe Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (Safe RLHF), a novel algorithm for human value alignment. Safe RLHF explicitly decouples human preferences regarding helpfulness and harmlessness, effectively avoiding the crowd workers' confusion about the tension and allowing us to train separate reward and cost models. We formalize the safety concern of LLMs as an optimization task of maximizing the reward function while satisfying specified cost constraints. Leveraging the Lagrangian method to solve this constrained problem, Safe RLHF dynamically adjusts the balance between the two objectives during fine-tuning. Through a three-round fine-tuning using Safe RLHF, we demonstrate a superior ability to mitigate harmful responses while enhancing model performance compared to existing value-aligned algorithms. Experimentally, we fine-tuned the Alpaca-7B using Safe RLHF and aligned it with collected human preferences, significantly improving its helpfulness and harmlessness according to human evaluations. Code is available at https://github.com/PKU-Alignment/safe-rlhf.

Existing evaluations in this field are limited in terms of the scale of the clients and dataset diversity. Thus, we propose a Federated DG benchmark that aim to test the limits of current methods with high client heterogeneity, large numbers of clients, and diverse datasets. Towards this objective, we introduce a novel data partition method that allows us to distribute any domain dataset among few or many clients while controlling client heterogeneity. We then introduce and apply our methodology to evaluate 14 DG methods, which include centralized DG methods adapted to the FL context, FL methods that handle client heterogeneity, and methods designed specifically for Federated DG on 7 datasets. Our results suggest that, despite some progress, significant performance gaps remain in Federated DG, especially when evaluating with a large number of clients, high client heterogeneity, or more realistic datasets. Furthermore, our extendable benchmark code will be publicly released to aid in benchmarking future Federated DG approaches. | Ruqi Bai, Saurabh Bagchi, David I. Inouye |  |

Recent algorithms, such as REDQ and DroQ, found a way to improve the sample efficiency by increasing the update-to-data (UTD) ratio to 20 gradient update steps on the critic per environment sample. However, this comes at the expense of a greatly increased computational cost. To reduce this computational burden, we introduce CrossQ: A lightweight algorithm for continuous control tasks that makes careful use of Batch Normalization and removes target networks to surpass the current state-of-the-art in sample efficiency while maintaining a low UTD ratio of 1. Notably, CrossQ does not rely on advanced bias-reduction schemes used in current methods. CrossQ's contributions are threefold: (1) it matches or surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in terms of sample efficiency, (2) it substantially reduces the computational cost compared to REDQ and DroQ, (3) it is easy to implement, requiring just a few lines of code on top of SAC. | Aditya Bhatt, Daniel Palenicek, Boris Belousov, Max Argus, Artemij Amiranashvili, Thomas Brox, Jan Peters |  |

Imitation learning (IL) utilizes oracles to improve sample efficiency, yet it is often constrained by the quality of the oracles deployed. To address the demand for robust policy improvement in real-world scenarios, we introduce a novel algorithm, Robust Policy Improvement (RPI), which actively interleaves between IL and RL based on an online estimate of their performance. RPI draws on the strengths of IL, using oracle queries to facilitate exploration—an aspect that is notably challenging in sparse-reward RL—particularly during the early stages of learning. As learning unfolds, RPI gradually transitions to RL, effectively treating the learned policy as an improved oracle. This algorithm is capable of learning from and improving upon a diverse set of black-box oracles. Integral to RPI are Robust Active Policy Selection (RAPS) and Robust Policy Gradient (RPG), both of which reason over whether to perform state-wise imitation from the oracles or learn from its own value function when the learner’s performance surpasses that of the oracles in a specific state. Empirical evaluations and theoretical analysis validate that RPI excels in comparison to existing state-of-the-art methodologies, demonstrating superior performance across various benchmark domains. | Xuefeng Liu, Takuma Yoneda, Rick Stevens, Matthew R.

The daunting challenges in this field stem from the difficulty of optimizing in high-dimensional action spaces and the instability introduced by the bipedal morphology of humanoids. However, the extensive collection of human motion-captured data and the derived datasets of humanoid trajectories, such as MoCapAct, paves the way to tackle these challenges. In this context, we present Humanoid Generalist Autoencoding Planner (H-GAP), a state-action trajectory generative model trained on humanoid trajectories derived from human motion-captured data, capable of adeptly handling downstream control tasks with Model Predictive Control (MPC). For 56 degrees of freedom humanoid, we empirically demonstrate that H-GAP learns to represent and generate a wide range of motor behaviors. Further, without any learning from online interactions, it can also flexibly transfer these behaviours to solve novel downstream control tasks via planning. Notably, H-GAP excels established MPC baselines with access to the ground truth model, and is superior or comparable to offline RL methods trained for individual tasks. Finally, we do a series of empirical studies on the scaling properties of H-GAP, showing the potential for performance gains via additional data but not computing. | Zhengyao Jiang, Yingchen Xu, Nolan Wagener, Yicheng Luo, Michael Janner, Edward Grefenstette, Tim Rocktäschel, Yuandong Tian |  |

By adapting classical clustering to the nonstationary setting of Deep RL, RECODE can efficiently track state visitation counts over thousands of episodes. We further propose a novel generalization of the inverse dynamics loss, which leverages masked transformer architectures for multi-step prediction; which in conjunction with \DETOCS achieves a new state-of-the-art in a suite of challenging 3D-exploration tasks in DM-Hard-8. RECODE also sets new state-of-the-art in hard exploration Atari games, and is the first agent to reach the end screen in "Pitfall!" | Alaa Saade, Steven Kapturowski, Daniele Calandriello, Charles Blundell, Pablo Sprechmann, Leopoldo Sarra, Oliver Groth, Michal Valko, Bilal Piot |  |

However, training such operators requires generating a substantial amount of labeled data, i.e., PDE problems together with their solutions. The data generation process is exceptionally time-consuming, as it involves solving numerous systems of linear equations to obtain numerical solutions to the PDEs. Many existing methods solve these systems independently without considering their inherent similarities, resulting in extremely redundant computations. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel method, namely \*\*S\*\*orting \*\*K\*\*rylov \*\*R\*\*ecycling (\*\*SKR\*\*), to boost the efficiency of solving these systems, thus significantly accelerating data generation for neural operators training. To the best of our knowledge, SKR is the first attempt to address the time-consuming nature of data generation for learning neural operators. The working horse of SKR is Krylov subspace recycling, a powerful technique for solving a series of interrelated systems by leveraging their inherent similarities. Specifically, SKR employs a sorting algorithm to arrange these systems in a sequence, where adjacent systems exhibit high similarities. Then it equips a solver with Krylov subspace recycling to solve the systems sequentially instead of independently, thus effectively enhancing the solving efficiency. Both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that SKR can significantly accelerate neural operator data generation, achieving a remarkable speedup of up to 13.9 times. | Hong Wang, Zhongkai Hao, Jie Wang, Zijie Geng, Zhen Wang, Bin Li, Feng Wu |  |

In this paper, we first propose a novel deep anomaly detection model that improves the original hypersphere learning through an orthogonal projection layer, which ensures that the training data distribution is consistent with the hypersphere hypothesis, thereby increasing the true positive rate and decreasing the false negative rate. Moreover, we propose a bi-hypersphere compression method to obtain a hyperspherical shell that yields a more compact decision region than a hyperball, which is demonstrated theoretically and numerically. The proposed methods are not confined to common datasets such as image and tabular data, but are also extended to a more challenging but promising scenario, graph-level anomaly detection, which learns graph representation with maximum mutual information between the substructure and global structure features while exploring orthogonal single- or bi-hypersphere anomaly decision boundaries. The numerical and visualization results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our methods in comparison to many baselines and state-of-the-art methods. | Yunhe Zhang, Yan Sun, Jinyu Cai, Jicong Fan |  |

General function approximation is a powerful tool for algorithm design and analysis, but its adaptation to offline RL encounters several challenges due to varying approximation targets and assumptions that blur the real meanings of function assumptions. In this paper, we try to formulate and clarify the treatment of general function approximation in offline RL in two aspects: (1) analyzing different types of assumptions and their practical usage, and (2) understanding its role as a restriction on underlying MDPs from information-theoretic perspectives. Additionally, we introduce a new insight for lower bound establishing: one can exploit model-realizability to establish general-purpose lower bounds that can be generalized into other functions. Building upon this insight, we propose two generic lower bounds that contribute to a better understanding of offline RL with general function approximation. | Chenjie Mao, Qiaosheng Zhang, Zhen Wang, Xuelong Li |  |

Interpreting their internals is a pivotal goal. Nevertheless, their particular components, feed-forward (FF) blocks, have typically been less analyzed despite their substantial parameter amounts. We analyze the input contextualization effects of FF blocks by rendering them in the attention maps as a human-friendly visualization scheme. Our experiments with both masked- and causal-language models reveal that FF networks modify the input contextualization to emphasize specific types of linguistic compositions. In addition, FF and its surrounding components tend to cancel out each other's effects, suggesting potential redundancy in the processing of the Transformer layer. | Goro Kobayashi, Tatsuki Kuribayashi, Sho Yokoi, Kentaro Inui |  |

Our results hold for a broad class of asymptotically free sketches under very mild data assumptions. For squared prediction risk, we provide a decomposition into an unsketched equivalent implicit ridge bias and a sketching-based variance, and prove that the risk can be globally optimized by only tuning sketch size in infinite ensembles. For general subquadratic prediction risk functionals, we extend GCV to construct consistent risk estimators, and thereby obtain distributional convergence of the GCV-corrected predictions in Wasserstein-2 metric. This in particular allows construction of prediction intervals with asymptotically correct coverage conditional on the training data. We also propose an "ensemble trick" whereby the risk for unsketched ridge regression can be efficiently estimated via GCV using small sketched ridge ensembles. We empirically validate our theoretical results using both synthetic and real large-scale datasets with practical sketches including CountSketch and subsampled randomized discrete cosine transforms. | Pratik Patil, Daniel LeJeune |  |

However, few works delve into the inherent properties of learnable soft-prompt vectors, specifically the impact of their norms to the performance of VLMs. This motivates us to pose an unexplored research question: \`\`Do we need to normalize the soft prompts in VLMs?'' To fill this research gap, we first uncover a phenomenon, called the $\textbf{Low-Norm Effect}$ by performing extensive corruption experiments, suggesting that reducing the norms of certain learned prompts occasionally enhances the performance of VLMs, while increasing them often degrades it. To harness this effect, we propose a novel method named $\textbf{N}$ormalizing th$\textbf{e}$ soft-pro$\textbf{m}$pt v$\textbf{e}$ctors of vi$\textbf{si}$on-language model$\textbf{s}$ ($\textbf{Nemesis}$) to normalize soft-prompt vectors in VLMs. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to systematically investigate the role of norms of soft-prompt vector in VLMs, offering valuable insights for future research in soft-prompt tuning. | Shuai Fu, Xiequn Wang, Qiushi Huang, Yu Zhang |  |
| 351 |  |  [Towards Understanding Factual Knowledge of Large Language Models](https://openreview.net/forum?id=9OevMUdods) |  | 0 | Large language models (LLMs) have recently driven striking performance improvements across a range of natural language processing tasks. The factual knowledge acquired during pretraining and instruction tuning can be useful in various downstream tasks, such as question answering, and language generation. Unlike conventional Knowledge Bases (KBs) that explicitly store factual knowledge, LLMs implicitly store facts in their parameters. Content generated by the LLMs can often exhibit inaccuracies or deviations from the truth, due to facts that can be incorrectly induced or become obsolete over time. To this end, we aim to explore the extent and scope of factual knowledge within LLMs by designing the benchmark Pinocchio. Pinocchio contains 20K diverse factual questions that span different sources, timelines, domains, regions, and languages. Furthermore, we investigate whether LLMs can compose multiple facts, update factual knowledge temporally, reason over multiple pieces of facts, identify subtle factual differences, and resist adversarial examples. Extensive experiments on different sizes and types of LLMs show that existing LLMs still lack factual knowledge and suffer from various spurious correlations. We believe this is a critical bottleneck for realizing trustworthy artificial intelligence.

However, samples generated by these models often do not strictly comply with user-provided conditions. Due to this, there have been few attempts to evaluate this alignment via pre-trained scoring models to select well-generated samples. Nonetheless, current studies are confined to the text-to-image domain and require large training datasets. This suggests that crafting alignment scores for various conditions will demand considerable resources in the future. In this context, we introduce a universal condition alignment score that leverages the conditional probability measurable through the diffusion process. Our technique operates across all conditions and requires no additional models beyond the diffusion model used for generation, effectively enabling self-rejection. Our experiments validate that our met- ric effectively applies in diverse conditional generations, such as text-to-image, {instruction, image}-to-image, edge-/scribble-to-image, and text-to-audio. | Chunsan Hong, Byunghee Cha, TaeHyun Oh |  |

We believe that the main ingredient to the success of CLIP is its \textit{data} and \textit{not} the \textit{model} architecture or pre-training {objective}. However, CLIP only provides very limited information about its data and how it has been collected, leading to works that aim to reproduce CLIP's data by filtering with its model parameters. In this work, we intend to reveal CLIP's data curation approach and in our pursuit of making it open to the community introduce Metadata-Curated Language-Image Pre-training (MetaCLIP). MetaCLIP takes a raw data pool and metadata (derived from CLIP's concepts) and yields a balanced subset over the metadata distribution. Our experimental study rigorously isolates the model and training settings, concentrating solely on data. MetaCLIP applied to CommonCrawl with 400M image-text data pairs outperforms CLIP's data on multiple standard benchmarks. In zero-shot ImageNet classification, MetaCLIP achieves 70.8\% accuracy, surpassing CLIP's 68.3\% on \mbox{ViT-B} models. Scaling to 1B data, while maintaining the same training budget, attains \textbf{72.4\%}. Our observations hold across various model sizes, exemplified by ViT-H achieving \textbf{80.5\%}, without any bells-and-whistles. Curation code and training data distribution over metadata will be made available. | Hu Xu, Saining Xie, Xiaoqing Ellen Tan, PoYao Huang, Russell Howes, Vasu Sharma, ShangWen Li, Gargi Ghosh, Luke Zettlemoyer, Christoph Feichtenhofer |  |

Recently, offline data mixing augmentation, e.g. handcrafted and saliency information-based mixup, has been gradually replaced by automatic mixing approaches. Through minimizing two sub-tasks, namely, mixed sample generation and mixup classification in an end-to-end way, AutoMix significantly improves accuracy on image classification tasks. However, as the optimization objective is consistent for the two sub-tasks, this approach is prone to generating consistent instead of diverse mixed samples, which results in overfitting for target task training. In this paper, we propose AdAutomixup, an adversarial automatic mixup augmentation approach that generates challenging samples to train a robust classifier for image classification, by alternatively optimizing the classifier and the mixup sample generator. AdAutomixup comprises two modules, a mixed example generator, and a target classifier. The mixed sample generator aims to produce hard mixed examples to challenge the target classifier, while the target classifier's aim is to learn robust features from hard mixed examples to improve generalization. To prevent the collapse of the inherent meanings of images, we further introduce an exponential moving average (EMA) teacher and cosine similarity to train AdAutomixup in an end-to-end way. Extensive experiments on seven image benchmarks consistently prove that our approach outperforms the state of the art in various classification scenarios.

While cognitive science emphasizes the significance of spatial context in the formation and retrieval of episodic memory, the current primary approach to implementing episodic memory in AI systems is through transformers that store temporally ordered experiences, which overlooks the spatial dimension. As a result, it is unclear how the underlying structure could be extended to incorporate the spatial axis beyond temporal order alone and thereby what benefits can be obtained. To address this, this paper explores the use of Spatially-Aware Transformer models that incorporate spatial information. These models enable the creation of place-centric episodic memory that considers both temporal and spatial dimensions. Adopting this approach, we demonstrate that memory utilization efficiency can be improved, leading to enhanced accuracy in various place-centric downstream tasks. Additionally, we propose the Adaptive Memory Allocator, a memory management method based on reinforcement learning that aims to optimize efficiency of memory utilization. Our experiments demonstrate the advantages of our proposed model in various environments and across multiple downstream tasks, including prediction, generation, reasoning, and reinforcement learning. The source code for our models and experiments will be available at \href{https://github.com/spatially_aware_transformer}{https://github.com/spatially_aware_transformer}. | Junmo Cho, Jaesik Yoon, Sungjin Ahn |  |

Whereas prior works have focused on leveraging LLMs directly for planning in symbolic spaces, this work uses LLMs to guide the search of task structures and constraints implicit in multi-step demonstrations. Specifically, we borrow from manipulation planning literature the concept of mode families, which group robot configurations by specific motion constraints, to serve as an abstraction layer between the high-level language representations of an LLM and the low-level physical trajectories of a robot. By replaying a few human demonstrations with synthetic perturbations, we generate coverage over the demonstrations' state space with additional successful executions as well as counterfactuals that fail the task. Our explanation-based learning framework trains an end-to-end differentiable neural network to predict successful trajectories from failures and as a by-product learns classifiers that ground low-level states and images in mode families without dense labeling. The learned grounding classifiers can further be used to translate language plans into reactive policies in the physical domain in an interpretable manner. We show our approach improves the interpretability and reactivity of imitation learning through 2D navigation and simulated and real robot manipulation tasks.

| 357 |  |  [Beyond Worst-case Attacks: Robust RL with Adaptive Defense via Non-dominated Policies](https://openreview.net/forum?id=DFTHW0MyiW) |  | 0 | In light of the burgeoning success of reinforcement learning (RL) in diverse real-world applications, considerable focus has been directed towards ensuring RL policies are robust to adversarial attacks during test time. Current approaches largely revolve around solving a minimax problem to prepare for potential worst-case scenarios. While effective against strong attacks, these methods often compromise performance in the absence of attacks or the presence of only weak attacks. To address this, we study policy robustness under the well-accepted state-adversarial attack model, extending our focus beyond merely worst-case attacks. We first formalize this task at test time as a regret minimization problem and establish its intrinsic difficulty in achieving sublinear regret when the baseline policy is from a general continuous policy class, $\Pi$. This finding prompts us to \textit{refine} the baseline policy class $\Pi$ prior to test time, aiming for efficient adaptation within a compact, finite policy class $\tilde{\Pi}$, which can resort to an adversarial bandit subroutine. In light of the importance of a finite and compact $\tilde{\Pi}$, we propose a novel training-time algorithm to iteratively discover \textit{non-dominated policies}, forming a near-optimal and minimal $\tilde{\Pi}$, thereby ensuring both robustness and test-time efficiency. Empirical validation on the Mujoco corroborates the superiority of our approach in terms of natural and robust performance, as well as adaptability to various attack scenarios. | Xiangyu Liu, Chenghao Deng, Yanchao Sun, Yongyuan Liang, Furong Huang |  |
| 358 |  |  [Merge, Then Compress: Demystify Efficient SMoE with Hints from Its Routing Policy](https://openreview.net/forum?id=eFWG9Cy3WK) |  | 0 | Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) has shown promise to scale up the learning capacity of neural networks, however, they have issues like: ($a$) $\textit{High Memory Usage,}$ due to duplication of the network layers into multiple copies as experts; and ($b$) $\textit{Redundancy in Experts,}$ as common learning-based routing policies suffer from representational collapse. Therefore, vanilla SMoE models are memory inefficient and non-scalable, especially for resource-constrained downstream scenarios. In this paper, we ask: Can we craft a compact SMoE model by consolidating expert information? What is the best recipe to merge multiple experts into fewer but more knowledgeable experts? Our pilot investigation reveals that conventional model merging methods fail to be effective in such expert merging for SMoE. The potential reasons are: ($1$) redundant information overshadows critical experts; ($2$) appropriate neuron permutation for each expert is missing to bring all of them in alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a novel merging algorithm for SMoE, $\textit{i.e.}$, $\texttt{M-SMoE}$, which leverages routing statistics to guide expert merging. Specifically, it starts with neuron permutation alignment for experts; then, dominant experts and their "group members" are formed based on routing policies; lastly, every expert group is merged into a single expert by utilizing each expert's activation frequency as their weight for merging, thus diminishing the impact of insignificant experts. Moreover, we draw an interesting observation that our proposed merging promotes a low dimensionality in the merged expert's weight space, naturally paving the way for additional compression. Hence, our final method, $\texttt{MC-SMoE}$ ($\textit{i.e.}$, Merge, then Compress SMoE), further decomposes the merged experts into low-rank and structural sparse alternatives. Extensive experiments across $8$ benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our proposals. For instance, our $\texttt{MC-SMoE}$ achieves up to $80\%$ memory and a $20\%$ FLOPs reduction, with virtually no loss in performance. Our code is provided as supplementary material. | Pingzhi Li, Zhenyu Zhang, Prateek Yadav, YiLin Sung, Yu Cheng, Mohit Bansal, Tianlong Chen |  |

However, in this paper, we show that for an ensemble of deep learning based classification models, bias and variance are \emph{aligned} at a sample level, where squared bias is approximately \emph{equal} to variance for correctly classified sample points. We present empirical evidence confirming this phenomenon in a variety of deep learning models and datasets. Moreover, we study this phenomenon from two theoretical perspectives: calibration and neural collapse. We first show theoretically that under the assumption that the models are well calibrated, we can observe the bias-variance alignment. Second, starting from the picture provided by the neural collapse theory, we show an approximate correlation between bias and variance. | Lin Chen, Michal Lukasik, Wittawat Jitkrittum, Chong You, Sanjiv Kumar |  |

However, their generalization ability is limited by the inadequate consideration of physical inductive biases: (1) Existing studies overlook the continuity of transitions among system states, opting to employ several discrete transformation layers to learn the direct mapping between two adjacent states; (2) Most models only account for first-order velocity information, despite the fact that many physical systems are governed by second-order motion laws. To incorporate these inductive biases, we propose the Second-order Equivariant Graph Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (SEGNO). Specifically, we show how the second-order continuity can be incorporated into GNNs while maintaining the equivariant property. Furthermore, we offer theoretical insights into SEGNO, highlighting that it can learn a unique trajectory between adjacent states, which is crucial for model generalization. Additionally, we prove that the discrepancy between this learned trajectory of SEGNO and the true trajectory is bounded. Extensive experiments on complex dynamical systems including molecular dynamics and motion capture demonstrate that our model yields a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art baselines. | Yang Liu, Jiashun Cheng, Haihong Zhao, Tingyang Xu, Peilin Zhao, Fugee Tsung, Jia Li, Yu Rong |  |

In general, the role of unlabeled data is to impose a form of smoothness, usually from the similarity information encoded in a base kernel, such as the ϵ-neighbor kernel or the adjacency matrix of a graph. This work revisits the classical idea of spectrally transformed kernel regression (STKR), and provides a new class of general and scalable STKR estimators able to leverage unlabeled data. Intuitively, via spectral transformation, STKR exploits the data distribution for which unlabeled data can provide additional information. First, we show that STKR is a principled and general approach, by characterizing a universal type of “target smoothness”, and proving that any sufficiently smooth function can be learned by STKR. Second, we provide scalable STKR implementations for the inductive setting and a general transformation function, while prior work is mostly limited to the transductive setting. Third, we derive statistical guarantees for two scenarios: STKR with a known polynomial transformation, and STKR with kernel PCA when the transformation is unknown. Overall, we believe that this work helps deepen our understanding of how to work with unlabeled data, and its generality makes it easier to inspire new methods. | Runtian Zhai, Rattana Pukdee, Roger Jin, MariaFlorina Balcan, Pradeep Kumar Ravikumar |  |

Due to a lack of test node labels and unknown potential training-test graph data distribution shifts, conventional model evaluation encounters limitations in calculating performance metrics (e.g., test error) and measuring graph data-level discrepancies, particularly when the training graph used for developing GNNs remains unobserved during test time. In this paper, we study a new research problem, online GNN evaluation, which aims to provide valuable insights into the well-trained GNNs's ability to effectively generalize to real-world unlabeled graphs under the test-time graph distribution shifts. Concretely, we develop an effective learning behavior discrepancy score, dubbed LeBeD, to estimate the test-time generalization errors of well-trained GNN models. Through a novel GNN re-training strategy with a parameter-free optimality criterion, the proposed LeBeD comprehensively integrates learning behavior discrepancies from both node prediction and structure reconstruction perspectives. This enables the effective evaluation of the well-trained GNNs' ability to capture test node semantics and structural representations, making it an expressive metric for estimating the generalization error in online GNN evaluation. Extensive experiments on real-world test graphs under diverse graph distribution shifts could verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, revealing its strong correlation with ground-truth test errors on various well-trained GNN models. | Xin Zheng, Dongjin Song, Qingsong Wen, Bo Du, Shirui Pan |  |

However, pre-training data often contain label noise that may adversely affect the generalization of the model. This paper aims to understand the nature of noise in pre-training datasets and to mitigate its impact on downstream tasks. More specifically, through extensive experiments of supervised pre-training models on synthetic noisy ImageNet-1K and YFCC15M datasets, we demonstrate that while slight noise in pre-training can benefit in-domain (ID) transfer performance, where the training and testing data share the same distribution, it always deteriorates out-of-domain (OOD) performance, where training and testing data distribution are different. We empirically verify that the reason behind is noise in pre-training shapes the feature space differently. We then propose a light-weight black-box tuning method (NMTune) to affine the feature space to mitigate the malignant effect of noise and improve generalization on both ID and OOD tasks, considering one may not be able to fully fine-tune or even access the pre-trained models. We conduct practical experiments on popular vision and language models that are pre-trained on noisy data for evaluation of our approach. Our analysis and results show the importance of this interesting and novel research direction, which we term Noisy Model Learning. | Hao Chen, Jindong Wang, Ankit Shah, Ran Tao, Hongxin Wei, Xing Xie, Masashi Sugiyama, Bhiksha Raj |  |

Despite their widespread use, there remains a lack of public datasets showcasing how these tools are used by a population of users in practice. To bridge this gap, we offered free access to ChatGPT for online users in exchange for their affirmative, consensual opt-in to anonymously collect their chat transcripts and request headers. From this, we compiled WildChat, a corpus of 1 million user-ChatGPT conversations, which consists of over 2.5 million interaction turns. We compare WildChat with other popular user-chatbot interaction datasets, and find that our dataset offers the most diverse user prompts, contains the largest number of languages, and presents the richest variety of potentially toxic use-cases for researchers to study. In addition to timestamped chat transcripts, we enrich the dataset with demographic data, including state, country, and hashed IP addresses, alongside request headers. This augmentation allows for more detailed analysis of user behaviors across different geographical regions and temporal dimensions. Finally, because it captures a broad range of use cases, we demonstrate the dataset’s potential utility in fine-tuning instruction-following models.

Our key observation is that, while an image can be recognized in multiple ways, each has a consistent part-and-whole visual organization. Segmentation thus should be treated not as an end task to be mastered through supervised learning, but as an internal process that evolves with and supports the ultimate goal of recognition. We propose to integrate a hierarchical segmenter into the recognition process, {\it train} and {\it adapt} the entire model solely on image-level recognition objectives. We learn hierarchical segmentation {\it for free} alongside recognition, automatically uncovering part-to-whole relationships that not only underpin but also enhance recognition. Enhancing the Vision Transformer (ViT) with adaptive segment tokens and graph pooling, our model surpasses ViT in unsupervised part-whole discovery, semantic segmentation, image classification, and efficiency. Notably, our model (trained on {\it unlabeled} 1M ImageNet images) outperforms SAM (trained on 11M images and 1 billion masks) by absolute 8\% in mIoU on PartImageNet object segmentation. | TsungWei Ke, Sangwoo Mo, Stella X.

Specifically, we develop cross-modality attacks on alignment where we pair adversarial images going through the vision encoder with textual prompts to break the alignment of the language model. Our attacks employ a novel compositional strategy that combines an image, adversarially targeted towards toxic embeddings, with generic prompts to accomplish the jailbreak. Thus, the LLM draws the context to answer the generic prompt from the adversarial image. The generation of benign-appearing adversarial images leverages a novel embedding-space-based methodology, operating with no access to the LLM model. Instead, the attacks require access only to the vision encoder and utilize one of our four embedding space targeting strategies. By not requiring access to the LLM, the attacks lower the entry barrier for attackers, particularly when vision encoders such as CLIP are embedded in closed-source LLMs. The attacks achieve a high success rate across different VLMs, highlighting the risk of cross-modality alignment vulnerabilities, and the need for new alignment approaches for multi-modal models. | Erfan Shayegani, Yue Dong, Nael B.

However, such an approach inevitably results in the use of random timesteps at each update, which increases the variance of the gradient and ultimately prolongs the optimization process. In this paper, we propose to enhance the text-to-3D optimization by leveraging the T2I diffusion prior in the generative sampling process with a predetermined timestep schedule. To this end, we interpret text-to-3D optimization as a multi-view image-to-image translation problem, and propose a solution by approximating the probability flow. By leveraging the proposed novel optimization algorithm, we design DreamFlow, a practical three-stage coarse-to-fine text-to-3D optimization framework that enables fast generation of high-quality and high-resolution (i.e., 1024×1024) 3D contents. For example, we demonstrate that DreamFlow is 5 times faster than the existing state-of-the-art text-to-3D method, while producing more photorealistic 3D contents. | Kyungmin Lee, Kihyuk Sohn, Jinwoo Shin |  |

To address this shortcoming, we propose stack attention: an attention operator that incorporates stacks, inspired by their theoretical connections to context-free languages (CFLs). We show that stack attention is analogous to standard attention, but with a latent model of syntax that requires no syntactic supervision. We propose two variants: one related to deterministic pushdown automata (PDAs) and one based on nondeterministic PDAs, which allows transformers to recognize arbitrary CFLs. We show that transformers with stack attention are very effective at learning CFLs that standard transformers struggle on, achieving strong results on a CFL with theoretically maximal parsing difficulty. We also show that stack attention is more effective at natural language modeling under a constrained parameter budget, and we include results on machine translation. | Brian DuSell, David Chiang |  |

Yet, AI systems' abilities in this realm remain elusive. We present SOTOPIA, an open-ended environment to simulate complex social interactions between artificial agents and evaluate their social intelligence. In our environment, agents role-play and \*interact\* under a wide variety of scenarios; they coordinate, collaborate, exchange, and compete with each other to achieve complex social goals. We simulate the role-play interaction between LLM-based agents and humans within this task space and evaluate their performance with a holistic evaluation framework called SOTOPIA-Eval. With SOTOPIA, we find significant differences between these models in terms of their social intelligence, and we identify a subset of SOTOPIA scenarios, SOTOPIA-hard, that is generally challenging for all models. We find that on this subset, GPT-4 achieves a significantly lower goal completion rate than humans and struggles to exhibit social commonsense reasoning and strategic communication skills. These findings demonstrate SOTOPIA's promise as a general platform for research on evaluating and improving social intelligence in artificial agents. | Xuhui Zhou, Hao Zhu, Leena Mathur, Ruohong Zhang, Haofei Yu, Zhengyang Qi, LouisPhilippe Morency, Yonatan Bisk, Daniel Fried, Graham Neubig, Maarten Sap |  |

We call this phenomenon “sensory scaffolding”: observation streams that are not needed by a master might yet aid a novice learner. We consider such sensory scaffolding setups for training artificial agents. For example, a robot arm may need to be deployed with just a low-cost, robust, general-purpose camera; yet its performance may improve by having privileged training-time-only access to informative albeit expensive and unwieldy motion capture rigs or fragile tactile sensors. For these settings, we propose “Scaffolder”, a reinforcement learning approach which effectively exploits privileged sensing in critics, world models, reward estimators, and other such auxiliary components that are only used at training time, to improve the target policy. For evaluating sensory scaffolding agents, we design a new “S3” suite of ten diverse simulated robotic tasks that explore a wide range of practical sensor setups. Agents must use privileged camera sensing to train blind hurdlers, privileged active visual perception to help robot arms overcome visual occlusions, privileged touch sensors to train robot hands, and more. Scaffolder easily outperforms relevant prior baselines and frequently performs comparably even to policies that have test-time access to the privileged sensors.

However, this paradigm has not yet taken hold in reinforcement learning. This is because videos, the most abundant form of embodied behavioral data on the web, lack the action labels required by existing methods for imitating behavior from demonstrations. We introduce \*\*Latent Action Policies\*\* (LAPO), a method for recovering latent action information—and thereby latent-action policies, world models, and inverse dynamics models—purely from videos. LAPO is the first method able to recover the structure of the true action space just from observed dynamics, even in challenging procedurally-generated environments. LAPO enables training latent-action policies that can be rapidly fine-tuned into expert-level policies, either offline using a small action-labeled dataset, or online with rewards. LAPO takes a first step towards pre-training powerful, generalist policies and world models on the vast amounts of videos readily available on the web.

With the wide-spread availability of massive amounts of web-crawled data becoming more commonplace, how can we enhance the robustness of models trained on a massive amount of noisy web-crawled text? In our work, we propose Error Norm Truncation (ENT), a robust enhancement method to the standard training objective that truncates noisy data. Compared to methods that only uses the negative log-likelihood loss to estimate data quality, our method provides a more accurate estimation by considering the distribution of non-target tokens, which is often overlooked by previous work. Through comprehensive experiments across language modeling, machine translation, and text summarization, we show that equipping text generation models with ENT improves generation quality over standard training and previous soft and hard truncation methods. Furthermore, we show that our method improves the robustness of models against two of the most detrimental types of noise in machine translation, resulting in an increase of more than 2 BLEU points over the MLE baseline when up to 50\% of noise is added to the data. | Tianjian Li, Haoran Xu, Philipp Koehn, Daniel Khashabi, Kenton Murray |  |

In this paper, we introduce scaling techniques based on graph compression, spatial parallelization, and improved initialization conditions inspired by a connection to eigenvector algorithms. We revisit classic IRL methods in the routing context, and make the key observation that there exists a trade-off between the use of cheap, deterministic planners and expensive yet robust stochastic policies. This insight is leveraged in Receding Horizon Inverse Planning (RHIP), a new generalization of classic IRL algorithms that provides fine-grained control over performance trade-offs via its planning horizon. Our contributions culminate in a policy that achieves a 16-24% improvement in route quality at a global scale, and to the best of our knowledge, represents the largest published study of IRL algorithms in a real-world setting to date. We conclude by conducting an ablation study of key components, presenting negative results from alternative eigenvalue solvers, and identifying opportunities to further improve scalability via IRL-specific batching strategies. | Matt Barnes, Matthew Abueg, Oliver F.

Prior works studying thin-shell object manipulation mostly rely on heuristic policies or learn policies from real-world video demonstrations, and only focus on limited material types and tasks (e.g., cloth unfolding). However, these approaches face significant challenges when extended to a wider variety of thin-shell materials and a diverse range of tasks. On the other hand, while virtual simulations are shown to be effective in diverse robot skill learning and evaluation, prior thin-shell simulation environments only support a subset of thin-shell materials, which also limits their supported range of tasks. To fill in this gap, we introduce ThinShellLab - a fully differentiable simulation platform tailored for robotic interactions with diverse thin-shell materials possessing varying material properties, enabling flexible thin-shell manipulation skill learning and evaluation. Building on top of our developed simulation engine, we design a diverse set of manipulation tasks centered around different thin-shell objects. Our experiments suggest that manipulating thin-shell objects presents several unique challenges: 1) thin-shell manipulation relies heavily on frictional forces due to the objects' co-dimensional nature, 2) the materials being manipulated are highly sensitive to minimal variations in interaction actions, and 3) the constant and frequent alteration in contact pairs makes trajectory optimization methods susceptible to local optima, and neither standard reinforcement learning algorithms nor trajectory optimization methods (either gradient-based or gradient-free) are able to solve the tasks alone. To overcome these challenges, we present an optimization scheme that couples sampling-based trajectory optimization and gradient-based optimization, boosting both learning efficiency and converged performance across various proposed tasks. In addition, the differentiable nature of our platform facilitates a smooth sim-to-real transition. By tuning simulation parameters with a minimal set of real-world data, we demonstrate successful deployment of the learned skills to real-robot settings. ThinShellLab will be publicly available. Video demonstration and more information can be found on the project website https://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/ThinShellLab/. | Yian Wang, Juntian Zheng, Zhehuan Chen, Zhou Xian, Gu Zhang, Chao Liu, Chuang Gan |  |
| 375 |  |  [Can Sensitive Information Be Deleted From LLMs? Objectives for Defending Against Extraction Attacks](https://openreview.net/forum?id=7erlRDoaV8) |  | 0 | Pretrained language models sometimes possess knowledge that we do not wish them to, including memorized personal information and knowledge that could be used to harm people. They can also output toxic or harmful text. To mitigate these safety and informational issues, we propose an attack-and-defense framework for studying the task of deleting sensitive information directly from model weights. We study direct edits to model weights because (1) this approach should guarantee that particular deleted information is never extracted by future prompt attacks, and (2) it should protect against whitebox attacks, which is necessary for making claims about safety/privacy in a setting where publicly available model weights could be used to elicit sensitive information. Our threat model assumes that an attack succeeds if the answer to a sensitive question is located among a set of B generated candidates, based on scenarios where the information would be insecure if the answer is among B candidates. Experimentally, we show that even state-of-the-art model editing methods such as ROME struggle to truly delete factual information from models like GPT-J, as our whitebox and blackbox attacks can recover “deleted” information from an edited model 38% of the time. These attacks leverage two key observations: (1) that traces of deleted information can be found in intermediate model hidden states, and (2) that applying an editing method for one question may not delete information across rephrased versions of the question. Finally, we provide new defense methods that protect against some extraction attacks, but we do not find a single universally effective defense method. Our results suggest that truly deleting sensitive information is a tractable but difficult problem, since even relatively low attack success rates have potentially severe implications for the deployment of language models in a world where individuals enjoy ownership of their personal data, a right to privacy, and safety from harmful model outputs. | Vaidehi Patil, Peter Hase, Mohit Bansal |  |
| 376 |  |  [Learning to Reject Meets Long-tail Learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ta26LtNq2r) |  | 0 | Learning to reject (L2R) is a classical problem where one seeks a classifier capable of abstaining on low-confidence samples. Most prior work on L2R has focused on minimizing the standard misclassification error. However, in many real-world applications, the label distribution is highly imbalanced, necessitating alternate evaluation metrics such as the balanced error or the worst-group error that enforce equitable performance across both the head and tail classes. In this paper, we establish that traditional L2R methods can be grossly sub-optimal for such metrics, and show that this is due to an intricate dependence in the objective between the label costs and the rejector. We then derive the form of the Bayes-optimal classifier and rejector for the balanced error, propose a novel plug-in approach to mimic this solution, and extend our results to general evaluation metrics. Through experiments on benchmark image classification tasks, we show that our approach yields better trade-offs in both the balanced and worst-group error compared to L2R baselines. | Harikrishna Narasimhan, Aditya Krishna Menon, Wittawat Jitkrittum, Neha Gupta, Sanjiv Kumar |  |
| 377 |  |  [On the Foundations of Shortcut Learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Tj3xLVuE9f) |  | 0 | Deep-learning models can extract a rich assortment of features from data. Which features a model uses depends not only on \*predictivity\*---how reliably a feature indicates training-set labels---but also on \*availability\*---how easily the feature can be extracted from inputs. The literature on shortcut learning has noted examples in which models privilege one feature over another, for example texture over shape and image backgrounds over foreground objects. Here, we test hypotheses about which input properties are more available to a model, and systematically study how predictivity and availability interact to shape models' feature use. We construct a minimal, explicit generative framework for synthesizing classification datasets with two latent features that vary in predictivity and in factors we hypothesize to relate to availability, and we quantify a model's shortcut bias---its over-reliance on the shortcut (more available, less predictive) feature at the expense of the core (less available, more predictive) feature. We find that linear models are relatively unbiased, but introducing a single hidden layer with ReLU or Tanh units yields a bias. Our empirical findings are consistent with a theoretical account based on Neural Tangent Kernels. Finally, we study how models used in practice trade off predictivity and availability in naturalistic datasets, discovering availability manipulations which increase models' degree of shortcut bias. Taken together, these findings suggest that the propensity to learn shortcut features is a fundamental characteristic of deep nonlinear architectures warranting systematic study given its role in shaping how models solve tasks. | Katherine L.

However, the vast majority of this work ignores a critical underlying assumption: the choice of distance for synaptic changes - i.e. the geometry of synaptic plasticity. Gradient descent assumes that the distance is Euclidean, but many other distances are possible, and there is no reason that biology necessarily uses Euclidean geometry. Here, using the theoretical tools provided by mirror descent, we show that the distribution of synaptic weights will depend on the geometry of synaptic plasticity. We use these results to show that experimentally-observed log-normal weight distributions found in several brain areas are not consistent with standard gradient descent (i.e. a Euclidean geometry), but rather with non-Euclidean distances. Finally, we show that it should be possible to experimentally test for different synaptic geometries by comparing synaptic weight distributions before and after learning. Overall, our work shows that the current paradigm in theoretical work on synaptic plasticity that assumes Euclidean synaptic geometry may be misguided and that it should be possible to experimentally determine the true geometry of synaptic plasticity in the brain. | Roman Pogodin, Jonathan Cornford, Arna Ghosh, Gauthier Gidel, Guillaume Lajoie, Blake Aaron Richards |  |
| 379 |  |  [Graph Metanetworks for Processing Diverse Neural Architectures](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ijK5hyxs0n) |  | 0 | Neural networks efficiently encode learned information within their parameters. Consequently, many tasks can be unified by treating neural networks themselves as input data. When doing so, recent studies demonstrated the importance of accounting for the symmetries and geometry of parameter spaces. However, those works developed architectures tailored to specific networks such as MLPs and CNNs without normalization layers, and generalizing such architectures to other types of networks can be challenging. In this work, we overcome these challenges by building new metanetworks --- neural networks that take weights from other neural networks as input. Put simply, we carefully build graphs representing the input neural networks and process the graphs using graph neural networks. Our approach, Graph Metanetworks (GMNs), generalizes to neural architectures where competing methods struggle, such as multi-head attention layers, normalization layers, convolutional layers, ResNet blocks, and group-equivariant linear layers. We prove that GMNs are expressive and equivariant to parameter permutation symmetries that leave the input neural network functions unchanged. We validate the effectiveness of our method on several metanetwork tasks over diverse neural network architectures. | Derek Lim, Haggai Maron, Marc T. Law, Jonathan Lorraine, James Lucas |  |
| 380 |  |  [Dropout Enhanced Bilevel Training](https://openreview.net/forum?id=06lrITXVAx) |  | 0 | Bilevel optimization problems appear in many widely used machine learning tasks. Bilevel optimization models are sensitive to small changes, and bilevel training tasks typically involve limited datasets. Therefore, overfitting is a common challenge in bilevel training tasks. This paper considers the use of dropout to address this problem. We propose a bilevel optimization model that depends on the distribution of dropout masks. We investigate how the dropout rate affects the hypergradient of this model. We propose a dropout bilevel method to solve the dropout bilevel optimization model. Subsequently, we analyze the resulting dropout bilevel method from an optimization perspective. Analyzing the optimization properties of methods with dropout is essential because it provides convergence guarantees for methods using dropout. However, there has been limited investigation in this research direction. We provide the complexity of the resulting dropout bilevel method in terms of reaching an $\epsilon$ stationary point of the proposed stochastic bilevel model. Empirically, we demonstrate that overfitting occurs in data cleaning problems, and the method proposed in this work mitigates this issue. | Peiran Yu, Junyi Li, Heng Huang |  |
| 381 |  |  [Privacy Amplification for Matrix Mechanisms](https://openreview.net/forum?id=xUzWmFdglP) |  | 0 | Privacy amplification exploits randomness in data selection to provide tighter differential privacy (DP) guarantees. This analysis is key to DP-SGD's success in machine learning (ML), but, is not readily applicable to the newer state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms. This is because these algorithms, known as DP-FTRL, use the matrix mechanism to add correlated noise instead of independent noise as in DP-SGD. In this paper, we propose "MMCC'' (matrix mechanism conditional composition), the first algorithm to analyze privacy amplification via sampling for any generic matrix mechanism. MMCC is nearly tight in that it approaches a lower bound as $\epsilon\to0$. To analyze correlated outputs in MMCC, we prove that they can be analyzed as if they were independent, by conditioning them on prior outputs. Our "conditional composition theorem'' has broad utility: we use it to show that the noise added to binary-tree-DP-FTRL can asymptotically match the noise added to DP-SGD with amplification. Our algorithm also has practical empirical utility. We show that amplification leads to significant improvement in the privacy/utility trade-offs for DP-FTRL style algorithms for standard benchmark tasks. | Christopher A.

| 382 |  |  [Bandits Meet Mechanism Design to Combat Clickbait in Online Recommendation](https://openreview.net/forum?id=lsxeNvYqCj) |  | 0 | We study a strategic variant of the multi-armed bandit problem, which we coin the strategic click-bandit. This model is motivated by applications in online recommendation where the choice of recommended items depends on both the click-through rates and the post-click rewards. Like in classical bandits, rewards follow a fixed unknown distribution. However, we assume that the click-rate of each arm is chosen strategically by the arm (e.g., a host on Airbnb) in order to maximize the number of times it gets clicked. The algorithm designer does not know the post-click rewards nor the arms' actions (i.e., strategically chosen click-rates) in advance, and must learn both values over time. To solve this problem, we design an incentive-aware learning algorithm, UCB-S, which achieves two goals simultaneously: (a) incentivizing desirable arm behavior under uncertainty; (b) minimizing regret by learning unknown parameters. We approximately characterize all Nash equilibria of the arms under UCB-S and show a $\tilde{\mathcal{O}} (\sqrt{KT})$ regret bound uniformly in every equilibrium. We also show that incentive-unaware algorithms generally fail to achieve low regret in the strategic click-bandit. Finally, we support our theoretical results by simulations of strategic arm behavior which confirm the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed incentive design. | Thomas Kleine Buening, Aadirupa Saha, Christos Dimitrakakis, Haifeng Xu |  |
| 383 |  |  [Towards Principled Representation Learning from Videos for Reinforcement Learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=3mnWvUZIXt) |  | 0 | We study pre-training representations for decision-making using video data, which is abundantly available for tasks such as game agents and software testing. Even though significant empirical advances have been made on this problem, a theoretical understanding remains absent. We initiate the theoretical investigation into principled approaches for representation learning and focus on learning the latent state representations of the underlying MDP using video data. We study two types of settings: one where there is iid noise in the observation, and a more challenging setting where there is also the presence of exogenous noise, which is non-iid noise that is temporally correlated, such as the motion of people or cars in the background. We study three commonly used approaches: autoencoding, temporal contrastive learning, and forward modeling. We prove upper bounds for temporal contrastive learning and forward modeling in the presence of only iid noise. We show that these approaches can learn the latent state and use it to do efficient downstream RL with polynomial sample complexity. When exogenous noise is also present, we establish a lower bound result showing that the sample complexity of learning from video data can be exponentially worse than learning from action-labeled trajectory data. This partially explains why reinforcement learning with video pre-training is hard. We evaluate these representational learning methods in two visual domains, yielding results that are consistent with our theoretical findings. | Dipendra Misra, Akanksha Saran, Tengyang Xie, Alex Lamb, John Langford |  |

We study the sample complexity of contrastive learning, i.e. the minimum number of labeled tuples sufficient for getting high generalization accuracy. We give tight bounds on the sample complexity in a variety of settings, focusing on arbitrary distance functions, $\ell_p$-distances, and tree metrics. Our main result is an (almost) optimal bound on the sample complexity of learning $\ell_p$-distances for integer $p$. For any $p \ge 1$, we show that $\tilde \Theta(nd)$ labeled tuples are necessary and sufficient for learning $d$-dimensional representations of $n$-point datasets. Our results hold for an arbitrary distribution of the input samples and are based on giving the corresponding bounds on the Vapnik-Chervonenkis/Natarajan dimension of the associated problems. We further show that the theoretical bounds on sample complexity obtained via VC/Natarajan dimension can have strong predictive power for experimental results, in contrast with the folklore belief about a substantial gap between the statistical learning theory and the practice of deep learning. | Noga Alon, Dmitrii Avdiukhin, Dor Elboim, Orr Fischer, Grigory Yaroslavtsev |  |
| 385 |  |  [Post-hoc bias scoring is optimal for fair classification](https://openreview.net/forum?id=FM5xfcaR2Y) |  | 0 | We consider a binary classification problem under group fairness constraints, which can be one of Demographic Parity (DP), Equalized Opportunity (EOp), or Equalized Odds (EO). We propose an explicit characterization of Bayes optimal classifier under the fairness constraints, which turns out to be a simple modification rule of the unconstrained classifier. Namely, we introduce a novel instance-level measure of bias, which we call bias score, and the modification rule is a simple linear rule on top of the finite amount of bias scores. Based on this characterization, we develop a post-hoc approach that allows us to adapt to fairness constraints while maintaining high accuracy. In the case of DP and EOp constraints, the modification rule is thresholding a single bias score, while in the case of EO constraints we are required to fit a linear modification rule with 2 parameters. The method can also be applied for composite group-fairness criteria, such as ones involving several sensitive attributes. We achieve competitive or better performance compared to both in-processing and post-processing methods across three datasets: Adult, COMPAS, and CelebA. Unlike most post-processing methods, we do not require access to sensitive attributes during the inference time. | Wenlong Chen, Yegor Klochkov, Yang Liu |  |
| 386 |  |  [Sharpness-Aware Data Poisoning Attack](https://openreview.net/forum?id=bxITGFPVWh) |  | 0 | Recent research has highlighted the vulnerability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) against data poisoning attacks. These attacks aim to inject poisoning samples into the models' training dataset such that the trained models have inference failures. While previous studies have executed different types of attacks, one major challenge that greatly limits their effectiveness is the uncertainty of the re-training process after the injection of poisoning samples. It includes the uncertainty of training initialization, algorithm and model architecture. To address this challenge, we propose a new strategy called \*\*Sharpness-Aware Data Poisoning Attack (SAPA)\*\*. In particular, it leverages the concept of DNNs' loss landscape sharpness to optimize the poisoning effect on the (approximately) worst re-trained model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAPA offers a general and principled strategy that significantly enhances various types of poisoning attacks against various types of re-training uncertainty. | Pengfei He, Han Xu, Jie Ren, Yingqian Cui, Shenglai Zeng, Hui Liu, Charu C.

| 387 |  |  [Pre-training with Random Orthogonal Projection Image Modeling](https://openreview.net/forum?id=z4Hcegjzph) |  | 0 | Masked Image Modeling (MIM) is a powerful self-supervised strategy for visual pre-training without the use of labels. MIM applies random crops to input images, processes them with an encoder, and then recovers the masked inputs with a decoder, which encourages the network to capture and learn structural information about objects and scenes. The intermediate feature representations obtained from MIM are suitable for fine-tuning on downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose an Image Modeling framework based on random orthogonal projection instead of binary masking as in MIM. Our proposed Random Orthogonal Projection Image Modeling (ROPIM) reduces spatially-wise token information under guaranteed bound on the noise variance and can be considered as masking entire spatial image area under locally varying masking degrees. Since ROPIM uses a random subspace for the projection that realizes the masking step, the readily available complement of the subspace can be used during unmasking to promote recovery of removed information. In this paper, we show that using random orthogonal projection leads to superior performance compared to crop-based masking. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on several popular benchmarks. | Maryam Haghighat, Peyman Moghadam, Shaheer Mohamed, Piotr Koniusz |  |
| 388 |  |  [Lagrangian Flow Networks for Conservation Laws](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Nshk5YpdWE) |  | 0 | We introduce Lagrangian Flow Networks (LFlows) for modeling fluid densities and velocities continuously in space and time. By construction, the proposed LFlows satisfy the continuity equation, a PDE describing mass conservation in its differential form. Our model is based on the insight that solutions to the continuity equation can be expressed as time-dependent density transformations via differentiable and invertible maps. This follows from classical theory of the existence and uniqueness of Lagrangian flows for smooth vector fields. Hence, we model fluid densities by transforming a base density with parameterized diffeomorphisms conditioned on time. The key benefit compared to methods relying on numerical ODE solvers or PINNs is that the analytic expression of the velocity is always consistent with changes in density. Furthermore, we require neither expensive numerical solvers, nor additional penalties to enforce the PDE. LFlows show higher predictive accuracy in density modeling tasks compared to competing models in 2D and 3D, while being computationally efficient. As a real-world application, we model bird migration based on sparse weather radar measurements. | Fabricio Arend Torres, Marcello Massimo Negri, Marco Inversi, Jonathan Aellen, Volker Roth |  |

Linear relation representations may be obtained by constructing a first-order approximation to the LM from a single prompt, and they exist for a variety of factual, commonsense, and linguistic relations. However, we also identify many cases in which LM predictions capture relational knowledge accurately, but this knowledge is not linearly encoded in their representations. Our results thus reveal a simple, interpretable, but heterogeneously deployed knowledge representation strategy in transformer LMs. | Evan Hernandez, Arnab Sen Sharma, Tal Haklay, Kevin Meng, Martin Wattenberg, Jacob Andreas, Yonatan Belinkov, David Bau |  |

Allowing mixtures to subtract probability mass or density can drastically reduce the number of components needed to model complex distributions. However, learning such subtractive mixtures while ensuring they still encode a non-negative function is challenging. We investigate how to learn and perform inference on deep subtractive mixtures by squaring them. We do this in the framework of probabilistic circuits, which enable us to represent tensorized mixtures and generalize several other subtractive models. We theoretically prove that the class of squared circuits allowing subtractions can be exponentially more expressive than traditional additive mixtures; and, we empirically show this increased expressiveness on a series of real-world distribution estimation tasks. | Lorenzo Loconte, Aleksanteri M.

Despite its tremendous empirical success, the rigorous theoretical understanding of why unsupervised pretraining generally helps remains rather limited---most existing results are restricted to particular methods or approaches for unsupervised pretraining with specialized structural assumptions. This paper studies a generic framework, where the unsupervised representation learning task is specified by an abstract class of latent variable models $\Phi$ and the downstream task is specified by a class of prediction functions $\Psi$. We consider a natural approach of using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) for unsupervised pretraining and Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) for learning downstream tasks. We prove that, under a mild \`\`informative'' condition, our algorithm achieves an excess risk of $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{\mathcal{C}\_\Phi/m} + \sqrt{\mathcal{C}\_\Psi/n})$ for downstream tasks, where $\mathcal{C}\_\Phi, \mathcal{C}\_\Psi$ are complexity measures of function classes $\Phi, \Psi$, and $m, n$ are the number of unlabeled and labeled data respectively. Comparing to the baseline of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{\mathcal{C}\_{\Phi \circ \Psi}/n})$ achieved by performing supervised learning using only the labeled data, our result rigorously shows the benefit of unsupervised pretraining when $m \gg n$ and $\mathcal{C}\_{\Phi\circ \Psi} > \mathcal{C}\_\Psi$. This paper further shows that our generic framework covers a wide range of approaches for unsupervised pretraining, including factor models, Gaussian mixture models, and contrastive learning. | Jiawei Ge, Shange Tang, Jianqing Fan, Chi Jin |  |

To address this issue, we propose TorchRL, a generalistic control library for PyTorch that provides well-integrated, yet standalone components. We introduce a new and flexible PyTorch primitive, the TensorDict, which facilitates streamlined algorithm development across the many branches of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and control. We provide a detailed description of the building blocks and an extensive overview of the library across domains and tasks. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate its reliability and flexibility, and show comparative benchmarks to demonstrate its computational efficiency. TorchRL fosters long-term support and is publicly available on GitHub for greater reproducibility and collaboration within the research community. The code is open-sourced on GitHub. | Albert Bou, Matteo Bettini, Sebastian Dittert, Vikash Kumar, Shagun Sodhani, Xiaomeng Yang, Gianni De Fabritiis, Vincent Moens |  |

However, datasets collected by humans in real-world environments are often noisy and may even be maliciously corrupted, which can significantly degrade the performance of offline RL. In this work, we first investigate the performance of current offline RL algorithms under comprehensive data corruption, including states, actions, rewards, and dynamics. Our extensive experiments reveal that implicit Q-learning (IQL) demonstrates remarkable resilience to data corruption among various offline RL algorithms. Furthermore, we conduct both empirical and theoretical analyses to understand IQL's robust performance, identifying its supervised policy learning scheme as the key factor. Despite its relative robustness, IQL still suffers from heavy-tail targets of Q functions under dynamics corruption. To tackle this challenge, we draw inspiration from robust statistics to employ the Huber loss to handle the heavy-tailedness and utilize quantile estimators to balance penalization for corrupted data and learning stability. By incorporating these simple yet effective modifications into IQL, we propose a more robust offline RL approach named Robust IQL (RIQL). Extensive experiments demonstrate that RIQL exhibits highly robust performance when subjected to diverse data corruption scenarios. | Rui Yang, Han Zhong, Jiawei Xu, Amy Zhang, Chongjie Zhang, Lei Han, Tong Zhang |  |

This yields a sampling-free, single-pass model and loss that effectively improves uncertainty estimation. Our variational Bayesian last layer (VBLL) can be trained and evaluated with only quadratic complexity in last layer width, and is thus (nearly) computationally free to add to standard architectures. We experimentally investigate VBLLs, and show that they improve predictive accuracy, calibration, and out of distribution detection over baselines across both regression and classification. Finally, we investigate combining VBLL layers with variational Bayesian feature learning, yielding a lower variance collapsed variational inference method for Bayesian neural networks. | James Harrison, John Willes, Jasper Snoek |  |

For instance, pointing gestures and verbal information is often required to comprehend questions such as "what object is that?" Thus, this question-answering (QA) task involves complex reasoning of multimodal expressions (verbal utterances and nonverbal gestures). However, prior works have explored QA tasks in non-embodied settings, where questions solely contain verbal utterances from a single verbal and visual perspective. In this paper, we have introduced 8 novel embodied question answering (EQA) tasks to develop learning models to comprehend embodied questions with multimodal expressions. We have developed a novel large-scale dataset, EQA-MX, with over 8 million diverse embodied QA data samples involving multimodal expressions from multiple visual and verbal perspectives. To learn salient multimodal representations from discrete verbal embeddings and continuous wrapping of multiview visual representations, we propose a vector-quantization (VQ) based multimodal representation learning model, VQ-Fusion, for the EQA tasks. Our extensive experimental results suggest that VQ-Fusion can improve the performance of existing state-of-the-art visual-language models up to 13% across EQA tasks. | Md Mofijul Islam, Alexi Gladstone, Riashat Islam, Tariq Iqbal |  |

The inherent complexity of real-world data makes it unfeasible to exhaustively enumerate and encapsulate all its variations within a finite set of factors. However, it is worth noting that most real-world data have linguistic equivalents, typically in the form of textual descriptions. These linguistic counterparts can represent the data and effortlessly decomposed into distinct tokens. In light of this, we present Vocabulary Disentangled Retrieval (VDR), a retrieval-based framework that harnesses natural language as proxies of the underlying data variation to drive disentangled representation learning. Our approach employ a bi-encoder model to represent both data and natural language in a vocabulary space, enabling the model to distinguish dimensions that capture intrinsic characteristics within data through its natural language counterpart, thus facilitating disentanglement. We extensively assess the performance of VDR across 15 retrieval benchmark datasets, covering text-to-text and cross-modal retrieval scenarios, as well as human evaluation. Our experimental results compellingly demonstrate the superiority of VDR over previous bi-encoder retrievers with comparable model size and training costs, achieving an impressive 8.7% improvement in NDCG@10 on the BEIR benchmark, a 5.3\% increase on MS COCO, and a 6.0% increase on Flickr30k in terms of mean recall in the zero-shot setting. Moreover, The results from human evaluation indicate that interpretability of our method is on par with SOTA captioning models. | Jiawei Zhou, Xiaoguang Li, Lifeng Shang, Xin Jiang, Qun Liu, Lei Chen |  |

A common paradigm in existing designs involves the use of historical embeddings in predicting the results of future execution steps. Our observation in this work is that such historical dependence intrinsically contradicts the Markov nature of algorithmic reasoning tasks. Based on this motivation, we present our ForgetNet, which does not use historical embeddings and thus is consistent with the Markov nature of the tasks. To address challenges in training ForgetNet at early stages, we further introduce G-ForgetNet, which uses a gating mechanism to allow for the selective integration of historical embeddings. Such an enhanced capability provides valuable computational pathways during the model's early training phase. Our extensive experiments, based on the CLRS-30 algorithmic reasoning benchmark, demonstrate that both ForgetNet and G-ForgetNet achieve better generalization capability than existing methods. Furthermore, we investigate the behavior of the gating mechanism, highlighting its degree of alignment with our intuitions and its effectiveness for robust performance.

However, generalization during _fine-tuning_ is often more dependent on the transferability of _representations_ in the function space. Trust-region methods (TR) target this goal by regularizing representation curvature to reduce catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained task-agnostic information while adopting task-specific skills. We consider unifying these strategies for low curvature in both parameter space and function space to improve out-of-domain (OOD) generalization. We propose \*\*Trust Region Aware Minimization\*\* (TRAM), a SAM algorithm fine-tuning for low parameter sharpness and smooth, informative representations preserving pre-trained structure. TRAM uses a trust region bound to inform the SAM adversarial neighborhood, introducing an awareness of function curvature within optimization for flatter minima. We empirically validate TRAM in vision (cross-dataset adaptation) and text (OOD language modeling, zero-shot cross-lingual transfer) tasks where robust domain transfer and representation generality are critical. TRAM outperforms SAM- and TR-based optimization across all tasks, notably surpassing competing methods for hard transfer between _anticorrelated_ domains. TRAM establishes a novel standard in fine-tuning for domain-generalizable models with minimal additional computation over previous sharpness-aware methods. | Tom Sherborne, Naomi Saphra, Pradeep Dasigi, Hao Peng |  |

However, existing attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) models used for analyzing Whole Slide Images (WSIs) in cancer diagnostics often overlook the contextual information of tumor and neighboring tiles, leading to misclassifications. To address this, we propose the Context-Aware Multiple Instance Learning (CAMIL) architecture. CAMIL incorporates neighbor-constrained attention to consider dependencies among tiles within a WSI and integrates contextual constraints as prior knowledge into the MIL model. We evaluated CAMIL on subtyping non-small cell lung cancer (TCGA-NSCLC) and detecting lymph node (CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17) metastasis, achieving test AUCs of 97.5\%, 95.9\%, and 88.1\%, respectively, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, CAMIL enhances model interpretability by identifying regions of high diagnostic value.

In this work, we aim to capture both the 3D structure and dynamics of real-world scenes from monocular real-world videos. Our Dynamic Scene Transformer (DyST) model leverages recent work in neural scene representation to learn a latent decomposition of monocular real-world videos into scene content, per-view scene dynamics, and camera pose. This separation is achieved through a novel co-training scheme on monocular videos and our new synthetic dataset DySO. DyST learns tangible latent representations for dynamic scenes that enable view generation with separate control over the camera and the content of the scene. | Maximilian Seitzer, Sjoerd van Steenkiste, Thomas Kipf, Klaus Greff, Mehdi S.

Current bilevel optimization algorithms assume that the gradient of the upper-level function is Lipschitz (i.e., the upper-level function has a bounded smoothness parameter). However, recent studies reveal that certain neural networks such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long-short-term memory networks (LSTMs) exhibit potential unbounded smoothness, rendering conventional bilevel optimization algorithms unsuitable for these neural networks. In this paper, we design a new bilevel optimization algorithm, namely BO-REP, to address this challenge. This algorithm updates the upper-level variable using normalized momentum and incorporates two novel techniques for updating the lower-level variable: \textit{initialization refinement} and \textit{periodic updates}. Specifically, once the upper-level variable is initialized, a subroutine is invoked to obtain a refined estimate of the corresponding optimal lower-level variable, and the lower-level variable is updated only after every specific period instead of each iteration. When the upper-level problem is nonconvex and unbounded smooth, and the lower-level problem is strongly convex, we prove that our algorithm requires $\widetilde{O}(1/\epsilon^4)$ \footnote{Here $\widetilde{O}(\cdot)$ compresses logarithmic factors of $1/\epsilon$ and $1/\delta$, where $\delta\in(0,1)$ denotes the failure probability.} iterations to find an $\epsilon$-stationary point in the stochastic setting, where each iteration involves calling a stochastic gradient or Hessian-vector product oracle. Notably, this result matches the state-of-the-art complexity results under the bounded smoothness setting and without mean-squared smoothness of the stochastic gradient, up to logarithmic factors. Our proof relies on novel technical lemmas for the periodically updated lower-level variable, which are of independent interest. Our experiments on hyper-representation learning, hyperparameter optimization, and data hyper-cleaning for text classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm. The code is available at [https://github.com/MingruiLiu-ML-Lab/Bilevel-Optimization-under-Unbounded-Smoothness](https://github.com/MingruiLiu-ML-Lab/Bilevel-Optimization-under-Unbounded-Smoothness). | Jie Hao, Xiaochuan Gong, Mingrui Liu |  |

Here, the idea is to reduce the variance of the low-sample CATE estimation by a (potentially constrained) low-dimensional representation. However, low-dimensional representations can lose information about the observed confounders and thus lead to bias, because of which the validity of representation learning for CATE estimation is typically violated. In this paper, we propose a new, representation-agnostic refutation framework for estimating bounds on the representation-induced confounding bias that comes from dimensionality reduction (or other constraints on the representations) in CATE estimation. First, we establish theoretically under which conditions CATE is non-identifiable given low-dimensional (constrained) representations. Second, as our remedy, we propose a neural refutation framework which performs partial identification of CATE or, equivalently, aims at estimating lower and upper bounds of the representation-induced confounding bias. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our bounds in a series of experiments. In sum, our refutation framework is of direct relevance in practice where the validity of CATE estimation is of importance. | Valentyn Melnychuk, Dennis Frauen, Stefan Feuerriegel |  |

Unfortunately, existing LM pipelines are typically implemented using hard-coded “prompt templates”, i.e. lengthy strings discovered via trial and error. Toward a more systematic approach for developing and optimizing LM pipelines, we introduce DSPy, a programming model that abstracts LM pipelines as text transformation graphs, or imperative computational graphs where LMs are invoked through declarative modules. DSPy modules are parameterized, meaning they can learn how to apply compositions of prompting, finetuning, augmentation, and reasoning techniques. We design a compiler that will optimize any DSPy pipeline to maximize a given metric, by creating and collecting demonstrations. We conduct two case studies, showing that succinct DSPy programs can express and optimize pipelines that reason about math word problems, tackle multi-hop retrieval, answer complex questions, and control agent loops. Within minutes of compiling, DSPy can automatically produce pipelines that outperform out-of-the-box few-shot prompting as well as expert-created demonstrations for GPT-3.5 and Llama2-13b-chat. On top of that, DSPy programs compiled for relatively small LMs like 770M parameter T5 and Llama2-13b-chat are competitive with many approaches that rely on large and proprietary LMs like GPT-3.5 and on expert-written prompt chains.

| 404 |  |  [Impact of Computation in Integral Reinforcement Learning for Continuous-Time Control](https://openreview.net/forum?id=xJEd8PkdNz) |  | 0 | Integral reinforcement learning (IntRL) demands the precise computation of the utility function's integral at its policy evaluation (PEV) stage. This is achieved through quadrature rules, which are weighted sums of utility functions evaluated from state samples obtained in discrete time. Our research reveals a critical yet underexplored phenomenon: the choice of the computational method -- in this case, the quadrature rule -- can significantly impact control performance. This impact is traced back to the fact that computational errors introduced in the PEV stage can affect the policy iteration's convergence behavior, which in turn affects the learned controller. To elucidate how computation impacts control, we draw a parallel between IntRL's policy iteration and Newton's method applied to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. In this light, computational error in PEV manifests as an extra error term in each iteration of Newton's method, with its upper bound proportional to the computational error. Further, we demonstrate that when the utility function resides in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), the optimal quadrature is achievable by employing Bayesian quadrature with the RKHS-inducing kernel function. We prove that the local convergence rates for IntRL using the trapezoidal rule and Bayesian quadrature with a Matérn kernel to be $O(N^{-2})$ and $O(N^{-b})$, where $N$ is the number of evenly-spaced samples and $b$ is the Matérn kernel's smoothness parameter. These theoretical findings are finally validated by two canonical control tasks. | Wenhan Cao, Wei Pan |  |

While both iterative pruning schemes couple structure and parameter learning, understanding how LRR excels in both aspects can bring us closer to the design of more flexible deep learning algorithms that can optimize diverse sets of sparse architectures. To this end, we conduct experiments that disentangle the effect of mask learning and parameter optimization and how both benefit from overparameterization. The ability of LRR to flip parameter signs early and stay robust to sign perturbations seems to make it not only more effective in mask identification but also in optimizing diverse sets of masks, including random ones. In support of this hypothesis, we prove in a simplified single hidden neuron setting that LRR succeeds in more cases than IMP, as it can escape initially problematic sign configurations. | Advait Harshal Gadhikar, Rebekka Burkholz |  |

Conventional unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to learn features that bridge labeled source and unlabeled target domains. In contrast to feature learning, gradual domain adaptation (GDA) leverages extra continuous intermediate domains with pseudo-labels to boost the source classifier. However, real intermediate domains are sometimes unavailable or ineffective. In this paper, we propose $\textbf{G}$radual Domain Adaptation via $\textbf{G}$radient $\textbf{F}$low (GGF) to generate intermediate domains with preserving labels, thereby enabling us a fine-tuning method for GDA. We employ the Wasserstein gradient flow in Kullback–Leibler divergence to transport samples from the source to the target domain. To simulate the dynamics, we utilize the Langevin algorithm. Since the Langevin algorithm disregards label information and introduces diffusion noise, we introduce classifier-based and sample-based potentials to avoid label switching and dramatic deviations in the sampling process. For the proposed GGF model, we analyze its generalization bound. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed GGF method compared to state-of-the-art baselines. | Zhan Zhuang, Yu Zhang, Ying Wei |  |

However, existing state-of-the-art methods face challenges related to sample complexity, training instability, and the risk of converging to a suboptimal Nash Equilibrium. In this paper, we propose a unified framework for learning \emph{stochastic} policies to resolve these issues. We embed cooperative MARL problems into probabilistic graphical models, from which we derive the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) objective for MARL. Based on the MaxEnt framework, we propose \*Heterogeneous-Agent Soft Actor-Critic\* (HASAC) algorithm. Theoretically, we prove the monotonic improvement and convergence to \*quantal response equilibrium\* (QRE) properties of HASAC. Furthermore, we generalize a unified template for MaxEnt algorithmic design named \*Maximum Entropy Heterogeneous-Agent Mirror Learning\* (MEHAML), which provides any induced method with the same guarantees as HASAC. We evaluate HASAC on six benchmarks: Bi-DexHands, Multi-Agent MuJoCo, StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge, Google Research Football, Multi-Agent Particle Environment, and Light Aircraft Game. Results show that HASAC consistently outperforms strong baselines, exhibiting better sample efficiency, robustness, and sufficient exploration. | Jiarong Liu, Yifan Zhong, Siyi Hu, Haobo Fu, Qiang Fu, Xiaojun Chang, Yaodong Yang |  |

However, the equivariant operations in each layer can impose excessive constraints on the function form and network flexibility. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel network called the Hybrid Directional Graph Neural Network (HDGNN), which effectively combines strictly equivariant operations with learnable modules. We evaluate the performance of HDGNN on the QM9 dataset and the IS2RE dataset of OC20, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance on several tasks and competitive performance on others.

One approach to mitigating this risk is to incorporate watermarking techniques into LLMs, allowing for the tracking and attribution of model outputs. This study examines a crucial aspect of watermarking: how significantly watermarks impact the quality of model-generated outputs. Previous studies have suggested a trade-off between watermark strength and output quality. However, our research demonstrates that it is possible to integrate watermarks without affecting the output probability distribution with appropriate implementation. We refer to this type of watermark as an unbiased watermark. This has significant implications for the use of LLMs, as it becomes impossible for users to discern whether a service provider has incorporated watermarks or not. Furthermore, the presence of watermarks does not compromise the performance of the model in downstream tasks, ensuring that the overall utility of the language model is preserved. Our findings contribute to the ongoing discussion around responsible AI development, suggesting that unbiased watermarks can serve as an effective means of tracking and attributing model outputs without sacrificing output quality. | Zhengmian Hu, Lichang Chen, Xidong Wu, Yihan Wu, Hongyang Zhang, Heng Huang |  |

Robustness is particularly important in these settings as agents are often fit offline on expert demonstrations but deployed online where they must generalize to the closed feedback loop within the environment. In this work, we explore the application of recurrent neural networks to tasks of this nature and understand how a parameterization of their recurrent connectivity influences robustness in closed-loop settings. Specifically, we represent the recurrent connectivity as a function of rank and sparsity and show both theoretically and empirically that modulating these two variables has desirable effects on network dynamics. The proposed low-rank, sparse connectivity induces an interpretable prior on the network that proves to be most amenable for a class of models known as closed-form continuous-time neural networks (CfCs). We find that CfCs with fewer parameters can outperform their full-rank, fully-connected counterparts in the online setting under distribution shift. This yields memory-efficient and robust agents while opening a new perspective on how we can modulate network dynamics through connectivity. | Neehal Tumma, Mathias Lechner, Noel Loo, Ramin M.

CLIP models, particularly those incorporating vision transformers (ViTs), have exhibited remarkable generalization ability in zero-shot image classification. However, when transferring the vision-language alignment of CLIP from global image representation to local region representation for the open-vocabulary dense prediction tasks, CLIP ViTs suffer from the domain shift from full images to local image regions. In this paper, we embark on an in-depth analysis of the region-language alignment in CLIP models, which is essential for downstream open-vocabulary dense prediction tasks. Subsequently, we propose an approach named CLIPSelf, which adapts the image-level recognition ability of CLIP ViT to local image regions without needing any region-text pairs. CLIPSelf empowers ViTs to distill itself by aligning a region representation extracted from its dense feature map with the image-level representation of the corresponding image crop. With the enhanced CLIP ViTs, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on open-vocabulary object detection, semantic segmentation, and panoptic segmentation across various benchmarks.

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved unprecedented success in text processing, prompting us to explore the capabilities of Large EEG Models (LEMs). We hope that LEMs can break through the limitations of different task types of EEG datasets, and obtain universal perceptual capabilities of EEG signals through unsupervised pre-training. Then the models can be fine-tuned for different downstream tasks. However, compared to text data, the volume of EEG datasets is generally small and the format varies widely. For example, there can be mismatched numbers of electrodes, unequal length data samples, varied task designs, and low signal-to-noise ratio. To overcome these challenges, we propose a unified foundation model for EEG called Large Brain Model (LaBraM). LaBraM enables cross-dataset learning by segmenting the EEG signals into EEG channel patches. Vector-quantized neural spectrum prediction is used to train a semantically rich neural tokenizer that encodes continuous raw EEG channel patches into compact neural codes. We then pre-train neural Transformers by predicting the original neural codes for the masked EEG channel patches. The LaBraMs were pre-trained on about 2,500 hours of various types of EEG signals from around 20 datasets and validated on multiple different types of downstream tasks. Experiments on abnormal detection, event type classification, emotion recognition, and gait prediction show that our LaBraM outperforms all compared SOTA methods in their respective fields.

Deep learning models have been recently introduced to property estimation, surpassing conventional statistical approaches. However, these methods are tailored to the specific task and quantum data at hand. It remains an open and attractive question for devising a more universal task-agnostic pretraining model for quantum property estimation. In this paper, we propose LLM4QPE, a large language model style quantum task-agnostic pretraining and finetuning paradigm that 1) performs unsupervised pretraining on diverse quantum systems with different physical conditions; 2) uses the pretrained model for supervised finetuning and delivers high performance with limited training data, on downstream tasks. It mitigates the cost for quantum data collection and speeds up convergence. Extensive experiments show the promising efficacy of LLM4QPE in various tasks including classifying quantum phases of matter on Rydberg atom model and predicting two-body correlation function on anisotropic Heisenberg model. | Yehui Tang, Hao Xiong, Nianzu Yang, Tailong Xiao, Junchi Yan |  |

However, experimental or computational methods, such as density functional theory (DFT), are time-consuming and labor-intensive for obtaining this conformation. Deep learning (DL) based molecular representation learning (MRL) has made significant advancements in molecular modeling and has achieved remarkable results in various tasks. Consequently, it has emerged as a promising approach for directly predicting the ground-state conformation of molecules. In this regard, we introduce GTMGC, a novel network based on Graph-Transformer (GT) that seamlessly predicts the spatial configuration of molecules in a 3D space from their 2D topological architecture in an end-to-end manner. Moreover, we propose a novel self-attention mechanism called Molecule Structural Residual Self-Attention (MSRSA) for molecular structure modeling. This mechanism not only guarantees high model performance and easy implementation but also lends itself well to other molecular modeling tasks. Our method has been evaluated on the Molecule3D benchmark dataset and the QM9 dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves remarkable performance and outperforms current state-of-the-art methods as well as the widely used open-source software RDkit. | Guikun Xu, Yongquan Jiang, PengChuan Lei, Yan Yang, Jim Chen |  |

In this work, we investigate scaled ResNet in the limit of infinitely deep and wide neural networks, of which the gradient flow is described by a partial differential equation in the large-neural network limit, i.e., the mean-field regime. To derive the generalization bounds under this setting, our analysis necessitates a shift from the conventional time-invariant Gram matrix employed in the lazy training regime to a time-variant, distribution-dependent version. To this end, we provide a global lower bound on the minimum eigenvalue of the Gram matrix under the mean-field regime. Besides, for the traceability of the dynamic of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, we establish the linear convergence of the empirical error and estimate the upper bound of the KL divergence over parameters distribution. Finally, we build the uniform convergence for generalization bound via Rademacher complexity.

In recent years, our community has proposed numerous solutions in standard settings, high-dimensional treatment settings, and even longitudinal settings. While very diverse, the solution has mostly relied on neural networks for inference and simultaneous correction of assignment bias. New approaches typically build on top of previous approaches by proposing new (or refined) architectures and learning algorithms. However, the end result—a neural-network-based inference machine—remains unchallenged. In this paper, we introduce a different type of solution in the longitudinal setting: a closed-form ordinary differential equation (ODE). While we still rely on continuous optimization to learn an ODE, the resulting inference machine is no longer a neural network. Doing so yields several advantages such as interpretability, irregular sampling, and a different set of identification assumptions. Above all, we consider the introduction of a completely new type of solution to be our most important contribution as it may spark entirely new innovations in treatment effects in general. We facilitate this by formulating our contribution as a framework that can transform any ODE discovery method into a treatment effects method. | Krzysztof Kacprzyk, Samuel Holt, Jeroen Berrevoets, Zhaozhi Qian, Mihaela van der Schaar |  |

Nonetheless, the majority of state-of-the-art MBRL methods employ flat, non-hierarchical models. We propose Temporal Hierarchies from Invariant Context Kernels (THICK), an algorithm that learns a world model hierarchy via discrete latent dynamics. The lower level of THICK updates parts of its latent state sparsely in time, forming invariant contexts. The higher level exclusively predicts situations involving context changes. Our experiments demonstrate that THICK learns categorical, interpretable, temporal abstractions on the high level, while maintaining precise low-level predictions. Furthermore, we show that the emergent hierarchical predictive model seamlessly enhances the abilities of MBRL or planning methods. We believe that THICK contributes to the further development of hierarchical agents capable of more sophisticated planning and reasoning abilities. | Christian Gumbsch, Noor Sajid, Georg Martius, Martin V.

Models in such settings use features without considering their \*actionability\*. As a result, they can assign predictions that are \emph{fixed} -- meaning that individuals who are denied loans and interviews are, in fact, \*precluded from access\* to credit and employment. In this work, we introduce a procedure called \*recourse verification\* to test if a model assigns fixed predictions to its decision subjects. We propose a model-agnostic approach for verification with \*reachable sets\* -- i.e., the set of all points that a person can reach through their actions in feature space. We develop methods to construct reachable sets for discrete feature spaces, which can certify the responsiveness of \*any model\* by simply querying its predictions. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study on the infeasibility of recourse on datasets from consumer finance. Our results highlight how models can inadvertently preclude access by assigning fixed predictions and underscore the need to account for actionability in model development. | Avni Kothari, Bogdan Kulynych, TsuiWei Weng, Berk Ustun |  |
| 419 |  |  [ODICE: Revealing the Mystery of Distribution Correction Estimation via Orthogonal-gradient Update](https://openreview.net/forum?id=L8UNn7Llt4) |  | 0 | In this study, we investigate the DIstribution Correction Estimation (DICE) methods, an important line of work in offline reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL). DICE-based methods impose state-action-level behavior constraint, which is an ideal choice for offline learning. However, they typically perform much worse than current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods that solely use action-level behavior constraint. After revisiting DICE-based methods, we find there exist two gradient terms when learning the value function using true-gradient update: forward gradient (taken on the current state) and backward gradient (taken on the next state). Using forward gradient bears a large similarity to many offline RL methods, and thus can be regarded as applying action-level constraint. However, directly adding the backward gradient may degenerate or cancel out its effect if these two gradients have conflicting directions. To resolve this issue, we propose a simple yet effective modification that projects the backward gradient onto the normal plane of the forward gradient, resulting in an orthogonal-gradient update, a new learning rule for DICE-based methods. We conduct thorough theoretical analyses and find that the projected backward gradient brings state-level behavior regularization, which reveals the mystery of DICE-based methods: the value learning objective does try to impose state-action-level constraint, but needs to be used in a corrected way. Through toy examples and extensive experiments on complex offline RL and IL tasks, we demonstrate that DICE-based methods using orthogonal-gradient updates achieve SOTA performance and great robustness. | Liyuan Mao, Haoran Xu, Weinan Zhang, Xianyuan Zhan |  |

To this end, existing works learn non-transferable representations by reducing statistical dependence between the source and target domain. However, such statistical methods essentially neglect to distinguish between \*styles\* and \*contents\*, leading them to inadvertently fit (i) spurious correlation between \*styles\* and \*labels\*, and (ii) fake independence between \*contents\* and \*labels\*. Consequently, their performance will be limited when natural distribution shifts occur or malicious intervention is imposed. In this paper, we propose a novel method (dubbed as H-NTL) to understand and advance the NTL problem by introducing a causal model to separately model \*content\* and \*style\* as two latent factors, based on which we disentangle and harness them as guidances for learning non-transferable representations with intrinsically causal relationships. Speciﬁcally, to avoid fitting spurious correlation and fake independence, we propose a variational inference framework to disentangle the naturally mixed \*content factors\* and \*style factors\* under our causal model. Subsequently, based on dual-path knowledge distillation, we harness the disentangled two \*factors\* as guidances for non-transferable representation learning: (i) we constraint the source domain representations to fit \*content factors\* (which are the intrinsic cause of \*labels\*), and (ii) we enforce that the target domain representations fit \*style factors\* which barely can predict labels. As a result, the learned feature representations follow optimal untransferability toward the target domain and minimal negative influence on the source domain, thus enabling better NTL performance. Empirically, the proposed H-NTL signiﬁcantly outperforms competing methods by a large margin. | Ziming Hong, Zhenyi Wang, Li Shen, Yu Yao, Zhuo Huang, Shiming Chen, Chuanwu Yang, Mingming Gong, Tongliang Liu |  |

In contrast, convolution is losing steam in time series tasks nowadays for inferior performance. This paper studies the open question of how to better use convolution in time series analysis and makes efforts to bring convolution back to the arena of time series analysis. To this end, we modernize the traditional TCN and conduct time series related modifications to make it more suitable for time series tasks. As the outcome, we propose ModernTCN and successfully solve this open question through a seldom-explored way in time series community. As a pure convolution structure, ModernTCN still achieves the consistent state-of-the-art performance on five mainstream time series analysis tasks while maintaining the efficiency advantage of convolution-based models, therefore providing a better balance of efficiency and performance than state-of-the-art Transformer-based and MLP-based models. Our study further reveals that, compared with previous convolution-based models, our ModernTCN has much larger effective receptive fields (ERFs), therefore can better unleash the potential of convolution in time series analysis.

Canonical OOD bounds focus on different distance measurements between source and target domains but fail to consider the optimization property of the learned model. As empirically shown in recent work, sharpness of learned minimum influences OOD generalization. To bridge this gap between optimization and OOD generalization, we study the effect of sharpness on how a model tolerates data change in domain shift which is usually captured by "robustness" in generalization. In this paper, we give a rigorous connection between sharpness and robustness, which gives better OOD guarantees for robust algorithms. It also provides a theoretical backing for "flat minima leads to better OOD generalization". Overall, we propose a sharpness-based OOD generalization bound by taking robustness into consideration, resulting in a tighter bound than non-robust guarantees. Our findings are supported by the experiments on a ridge regression model, as well as the experiments on deep learning classification tasks. | Yingtian Zou, Kenji Kawaguchi, Yingnan Liu, Jiashuo Liu, MongLi Lee, Wynne Hsu |  |

The growing demand and cost of experimental PPI assays require computational methods for efficient PPI prediction. While existing methods rely heavily on protein sequence for PPI prediction, it is the protein structure that is the key to determine the interactions. To take both protein modalities into account, we define the microenvironment of an amino acid residue by its sequence and structural contexts, which describe the surrounding chemical properties and geometric features. In addition, microenvironments defined in previous work are largely based on experimentally assayed physicochemical properties, for which the "vocabulary" is usually extremely small. This makes it difficult to cover the diversity and complexity of microenvironments. In this paper, we propose Microenvironment-Aware Protein Embedding for PPI prediction (MPAE-PPI), which encodes microenvironments into chemically meaningful discrete codes via a sufficiently large microenvironment "vocabulary" (i.e., codebook). Moreover, we propose a novel pre-training strategy, namely Masked Codebook Modeling (MCM), to capture the dependencies between different microenvironments by randomly masking the codebook and reconstructing the input. With the learned microenvironment codebook, we can reuse it as an off-the-shelf tool to efficiently and effectively encode proteins of different sizes and functions for large-scale PPI prediction. Extensive experiments show that MAPE-PPI can scale to PPI prediction with millions of PPIs with superior trade-offs between effectiveness and computational efficiency than the state-of-the-art competitors. | Lirong Wu, Yijun Tian, Yufei Huang, Siyuan Li, Haitao Lin, Nitesh V.

Extensive research has been dedicated to exploring OOD detection in the vision modality. {Vision-language models (VLMs) can leverage both textual and visual information for various multi-modal applications, whereas few OOD detection methods take into account information from the text modality. In this paper, we propose a novel post hoc OOD detection method, called NegLabel, which takes a vast number of negative labels from extensive corpus databases. We design a novel scheme for the OOD score collaborated with negative labels. Theoretical analysis helps to understand the mechanism of negative labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method NegLabel achieves state-of-the-art performance on various OOD detection benchmarks and generalizes well on multiple VLM architectures. Furthermore, our method NegLabel exhibits remarkable robustness against diverse domain shifts.

However, the important problem of robust memorization has not been thoroughly studied. In this paper, several basic problems about robust memorization are solved. First, we prove that it is NP-hard to compute neural networks with certain simple structures, which are robust memorization. A network hypothesis space is called optimal robust memorization for a data set if it can achieve robust memorization for any budget less than half the separation bound of the data set. Second, we explicitly construct neural networks with O(N n) parameters for optimal robust memorization of any data set with dimension n and size N . We also give a lower bound for the width of networks to achieve optimal robust memorization. Finally, we explicitly construct neural networks with O(N n log n) parameters for optimal robust memorization of any binary classification data set by controlling the Lipschitz constant of the network. | Lijia Yu, XiaoShan Gao, Lijun Zhang |  |

Unfortunately, global stability guarantees are hard to provide in dynamical systems learned from data, especially when the learned dynamics are governed by neural networks. We propose a novel methodology to learn \emph{neural contractive dynamical systems}, where our neural architecture ensures contraction, and hence, global stability. To efficiently scale the method to high-dimensional dynamical systems, we develop a variant of the variational autoencoder that learns dynamics in a low-dimensional latent representation space while retaining contractive stability after decoding. We further extend our approach to learning contractive systems on the Lie group of rotations to account for full-pose end-effector dynamic motions. The result is the first highly flexible learning architecture that provides contractive stability guarantees with capability to perform obstacle avoidance. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach encodes the desired dynamics more accurately than the current state-of-the-art, which provides less strong stability guarantees. | Hadi BeikMohammadi, Søren Hauberg, Georgios Arvanitidis, Nadia Figueroa, Gerhard Neumann, Leonel Rozo |  |

Our model is based on high-dimensional matrices consisting of outer products of embeddings, which relates to the inner layers of transformer language models. We derive precise scaling laws with respect to sample size and parameter size, and discuss the statistical efficiency of different estimators, including optimization-based algorithms. We provide extensive numerical experiments to validate and interpret theoretical results, including fine-grained visualizations of the stored memory associations. | Vivien Cabannes, Elvis Dohmatob, Alberto Bietti |  |

To address this, we introduce Text2Reward, a data-free framework that automates the generation and shaping of dense reward functions based on large language models (LLMs). Given a goal described in natural language, Text2Reward generates shaped dense reward functions as an executable program grounded in a compact representation of the environment. Unlike inverse RL and recent work that uses LLMs to write sparse reward codes or unshaped dense rewards with a constant function across timesteps, Text2Reward produces interpretable, free-form dense reward codes that cover a wide range of tasks, utilize existing packages, and allow iterative refinement with human feedback. We evaluate Text2Reward on two robotic manipulation benchmarks (ManiSkill2, MetaWorld) and two locomotion environments of MuJoCo. On 13 of the 17 manipulation tasks, policies trained with generated reward codes achieve similar or better task success rates and convergence speed than expert-written reward codes. For locomotion tasks, our method learns six novel locomotion behaviors with a success rate exceeding 94%. Furthermore, we show that the policies trained in the simulator with our method can be deployed in the real world. Finally, Text2Reward further improves the policies by refining their reward functions with human feedback.

| 429 |  |  [Towards Meta-Pruning via Optimal Transport](https://openreview.net/forum?id=sMoifbuxjB) |  | 0 | Structural pruning of neural networks conventionally relies on identifying and discarding less important neurons, a practice often resulting in significant accuracy loss that necessitates subsequent fine-tuning efforts. This paper introduces a novel approach named Intra-Fusion, challenging this prevailing pruning paradigm. Unlike existing methods that focus on designing meaningful neuron importance metrics, Intra-Fusion redefines the overlying pruning procedure. Through utilizing the concepts of model fusion and Optimal Transport, we leverage an agnostically given importance metric to arrive at a more effective sparse model representation. Notably, our approach achieves substantial accuracy recovery without the need for resource-intensive fine-tuning, making it an efficient and promising tool for neural network compression. Additionally, we explore how fusion can be added to the pruning process to significantly decrease the training time while maintaining competitive performance. We benchmark our results for various networks on commonly used datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. More broadly, we hope that the proposed Intra-Fusion approach invigorates exploration into a fresh alternative to the predominant compression approaches.

InternVid contains over 7 million videos lasting nearly 760K hours, yielding 234M video clips accompanied by detailed descriptions of total 4.1B words. Our core contribution is to develop a scalable approach to autonomously build a high-quality video-text dataset with large language models (LLM), thereby showcasing its efficacy in learning video-language representation at scale. Specifically, we utilize a multi-scale approach to generate video-related descriptions. Furthermore, we introduce ViCLIP, a video-text representation learning model based on ViT-L. Learned on InternVid via contrastive learning, this model demonstrates leading zero-shot action recognition and competitive video retrieval performance. Beyond basic video understanding tasks like recognition and retrieval, our dataset and model have broad applications. They are particularly beneficial for generating interleaved video-text data for learning a video-centric dialogue system, advancing video-to-text and text-to-video generation research. These proposed resources provide a tool for researchers and practitioners interested in multimodal video understanding and generation. | Yi Wang, Yinan He, Yizhuo Li, Kunchang Li, Jiashuo Yu, Xin Ma, Xinhao Li, Guo Chen, Xinyuan Chen, Yaohui Wang, Ping Luo, Ziwei Liu, Yali Wang, Limin Wang, Yu Qiao |  |

In response to these challenges, local supervision, encompassing Local Learning (LL) and Forward Learning (FL), has emerged as a promising research direction. LL employs module-wise BP to achieve competitive results yet relies on module-wise auxiliary networks, which increase memory and parameter demands. Conversely, FL updates layer weights without BP and auxiliary networks but falls short of BP’s performance. This paper proposes a simple yet effective objective within a contrastive learning framework for local supervision without auxiliary networks. Given the insight that the existing contrastive learning framework for local supervision is susceptible to task-irrelevant information without auxiliary networks, we present DICTIONARY CONTRASTIVE LEARNING (DCL) that optimizes the similarity between local features and label embeddings. Our method using static label embeddings yields substantial performance improvements in the FL scenario, outperforming state-of-the-art FL approaches. Moreover, our method using adaptive label embeddings closely approaches the performance achieved by LL while achieving superior memory and parameter efficiency. | Suhwan Choi, Myeongho Jeon, Yeonjung Hwang, Jeonglyul Oh, Sungjun Lim, Joonseok Lee, Myungjoo Kang |  |

However, in the real-world where test ground truths are not provided, it is non-trivial to find out whether bounding boxes are accurate, thus preventing us from assessing the detector generalization ability. In this work, we find under feature map dropout, good detectors tend to output bounding boxes whose locations do not change much, while bounding boxes of poor detectors will undergo noticeable position changes. We compute the box stability score (BS score) to reflect this stability. Specifically, given an image, we compute a normal set of bounding boxes and a second set after feature map dropout. To obtain BS score, we use bipartite matching to find the corresponding boxes between the two sets and compute the average Intersection over Union (IoU) across the entire test set. We contribute to finding that BS score has a strong, positive correlation with detection accuracy measured by mean average precision (mAP) under various test environments. This relationship allows us to predict the accuracy of detectors on various real-world test sets without accessing test ground truths, verified on canonical detection tasks such as vehicle detection and pedestrian detection. | Yang Yang, Wenhai Wang, Zhe Chen, Jifeng Dai, Liang Zheng |  |

Modalities like electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging provide distinct views to the brain dynamics due to diametral spatiotemporal sensitivities and underlying neurophysiological coupling mechanisms. These distinct views pose a considerable challenge to learning a shared representation space, especially when dealing with covariance-based data characterized by their geometric structure. To capitalize on the geometric structure, we introduce a measure called geodesic correlation which expands traditional correlation consistency to covariance-based data on the symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifold. This measure is derived from classical canonical correlation analysis and serves to evaluate the consistency of latent representations obtained from paired views. For multi-view, self-supervised learning where one or both latent views are SPD we propose an innovative geometric deep learning framework termed DeepGeoCCA. Its primary objective is to enhance the geodesic correlation of unlabeled, paired data, thereby generating novel representations while retaining the geometric structures. In simulations and experiments with multi-view and multi-modal human neuroimaging data, we find that DeepGeoCCA learns latent representations with high geodesic correlation for unseen data while retaining relevant information for downstream tasks. | Ce Ju, Reinmar J.

Recent studies show that existing training-free metrics have several limitations, such as limited correlation and poor generalisation across different search spaces and tasks. Hence, we propose Sample-Wise Activation Patterns and its derivative, SWAP-Score, a novel high-performance training-free metric. It measures the expressivity of networks over a batch of input samples. The SWAP-Score is strongly correlated with ground-truth performance across various search spaces and tasks, outperforming 15 existing training-free metrics on NAS-Bench-101/201/301 and TransNAS-Bench-101. The SWAP-Score can be further enhanced by regularisation, which leads to even higher correlations in cell-based search space and enables model size control during the search. For example, Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient between regularised SWAP-Score and CIFAR-100 validation accuracies on NAS-Bench-201 networks is 0.90, significantly higher than 0.80 from the second-best metric, NWOT. When integrated with an evolutionary algorithm for NAS, our SWAP-NAS achieves competitive performance on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet in approximately 6 minutes and 9 minutes of GPU time respectively. | Yameng Peng, Andy Song, Haytham M.

While recently proposed approaches show promise in generalization to novel objects, semantic concepts, or visual distribution shifts, generalization to new tasks remains challenging. For example, a language-conditioned policy trained on pick-and-place tasks will not be able to generalize to a folding task, even if the arm trajectory of folding is similar to pick-and-place. Our key insight is that this kind of generalization becomes feasible if we represent the task through rough trajectory sketches. We propose a policy conditioning method using such rough trajectory sketches, which we call RT-Trajectory, that is practical, easy to specify, and allows the policy to effectively perform new tasks that would otherwise be challenging to perform. We find that trajectory sketches strike a balance between being detailed enough to express low-level motion-centric guidance while being coarse enough to allow the learned policy to interpret the trajectory sketch in the context of situational visual observations. In addition, we show how trajectory sketches can provide a useful interface to communicate with robotic policies -- they can be specified through simple human inputs like drawings or videos, or through automated methods such as modern image-generating or waypoint-generating methods. We evaluate RT-Trajectory at scale on a variety of real-world robotic tasks, and find that RT-Trajectory is able to perform a wider range of tasks compared to language-conditioned and goal-conditioned policies, when provided the same training data. | Jiayuan Gu, Sean Kirmani, Paul Wohlhart, Yao Lu, Montserrat Gonzalez Arenas, Kanishka Rao, Wenhao Yu, Chuyuan Fu, Keerthana Gopalakrishnan, Zhuo Xu, Priya Sundaresan, Peng Xu, Hao Su, Karol Hausman, Chelsea Finn, Quan Vuong, Ted Xiao |  |

Current large TTS systems usually quantize speech into discrete tokens and use language models to generate these tokens one by one, which suffer from unstable prosody, word skipping/repeating issue, and poor voice quality. In this paper, we develop NaturalSpeech 2, a TTS system that leverages a neural audio codec with residual vector quantizers to get the quantized latent vectors and uses a diffusion model to generate these latent vectors conditioned on text input. To enhance the zero-shot capability that is important to achieve diverse speech synthesis, we design a speech prompting mechanism to facilitate in-context learning in the diffusion model and the duration/pitch predictor. We scale NaturalSpeech 2 to large-scale datasets with 44K hours of speech and singing data and evaluate its voice quality on unseen speakers. NaturalSpeech 2 outperforms previous TTS systems by a large margin in terms of prosody/timbre similarity, robustness, and voice quality in a zero-shot setting, and performs novel zero-shot singing synthesis with only a speech prompt.

| 437 |  |  [Submodular Reinforcement Learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=loYSzjSaAK) |  | 0 | In reinforcement learning (RL), rewards of states are typically considered additive, and following the Markov assumption, they are independent of states visited previously. In many important applications, such as coverage control, experiment design and informative path planning, rewards naturally have diminishing returns, i.e., their value decreases in light of similar states visited previously. To tackle this, we propose Submodular RL (subRL), a paradigm which seeks to optimize more general, non-additive (and history-dependent) rewards modelled via submodular set functions, which capture diminishing returns. Unfortunately, in general, even in tabular settings, we show that the resulting optimization problem is hard to approximate. On the other hand, motivated by the success of greedy algorithms in classical submodular optimization, we propose subPO, a simple policy gradient-based algorithm for subRL that handles non-additive rewards by greedily maximizing marginal gains. Indeed, under some assumptions on the underlying Markov Decision Process (MDP), subPO recovers optimal constant factor approximations of submodular bandits. Moreover, we derive a natural policy gradient approach for locally optimizing subRL instances even in large state- and action- spaces. We showcase the versatility of our approach by applying subPO to several applications, such as biodiversity monitoring, Bayesian experiment design, informative path planning, and coverage maximization. Our results demonstrate sample efficiency, as well as scalability to high-dimensional state-action spaces. | Manish Prajapat, Mojmir Mutny, Melanie N. Zeilinger, Andreas Krause |  |

However, due to the heterogeneity among tables, such DNN bonus is still far from being well exploited on tabular data prediction (e.g., regression or classification tasks). Condensing knowledge from diverse domains, language models (LMs) possess the capability to comprehend feature names from various tables, potentially serving as versatile learners in transferring knowledge across distinct tables and diverse prediction tasks, but their discrete text representation space is inherently incompatible with numerical feature values in tables. In this paper, we present TP-BERTa, a specifically pre-trained LM for tabular data prediction. Concretely, a novel relative magnitude tokenization converts scalar numerical feature values to finely discrete, high-dimensional tokens, and an intra-feature attention approach integrates feature values with the corresponding feature names. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our pre-trained TP-BERTa leads the performance among tabular DNNs and is competitive with Gradient Boosted Decision Tree models in typical tabular data regime. | Jiahuan Yan, Bo Zheng, Hongxia Xu, Yiheng Zhu, Danny Z.

However, incorporating latent diffusion models to solve inverse problems remains a challenging problem due to the nonlinearity of the encoder and decoder. To address these issues, we propose ReSample, an algorithm that can solve general inverse problems with pre-trained latent diffusion models. Our algorithm incorporates data consistency by solving an optimization problem during the reverse sampling process, a concept that we term as hard data consistency. Upon solving this optimization problem, we propose a novel resampling scheme to map the measurement-consistent sample back onto the noisy data manifold and theoretically demonstrate its benefits. Lastly, we apply our algorithm to solve a wide range of linear and nonlinear inverse problems in both natural and medical images, demonstrating that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, including those based on pixel-space diffusion models. | Bowen Song, Soo Min Kwon, Zecheng Zhang, Xinyu Hu, Qing Qu, Liyue Shen |  |

In this work, we critically analyze this approach of imitating language models. We first finetune a series of LMs that imitate ChatGPT using varying base model sizes (1.5B--13B), data sources, and imitation data amounts (0.3M--150M tokens). We then evaluate the models using crowd raters and canonical NLP benchmarks. Initially, we were surprised by the output quality of our imitation models---they appear far better at following instructions, and crowd workers rate their outputs as competitive with ChatGPT. However, when conducting more targeted automatic evaluations, we find that imitation models close little to none of the gap from the base LM to ChatGPT on tasks that are not heavily supported in the imitation data. We show that these performance discrepancies may slip past human raters because imitation models are adept at mimicking ChatGPT’s style but not its factuality. Overall, we conclude that while model imitation can be useful for training models to follow instructions and avoid toxic outputs, it falls short its full promise in many ways. In particular, there exists a substantial capabilities gap between open and closed LMs that we find cannot be bridged merely by adding more imitation data. Instead, we find that fine-tuning more capable base LMs has a significantly more substantial effect on closing this gap. In turn, we argue that the higher leverage action for improving open-source models is to tackle the difficult challenge of developing better base LMs, rather than taking the shortcut of imitating proprietary systems. | Arnav Gudibande, Eric Wallace, Charlie Snell, Xinyang Geng, Hao Liu, Pieter Abbeel, Sergey Levine, Dawn Song |  |

Intuitively, using all of one's data to learn a common representation function benefits both computational effort and statistical generalization by leaving a smaller number of parameters to fine-tune on a given task. Toward theoretically grounding these merits, we propose a general setting of recovering linear operators $M$ from noisy vector measurements $y = Mx + w$, where the covariates $x$ may be both non-i.i.d. and non-isotropic. We demonstrate that existing isotropy-agnostic meta-learning approaches incur biases on the representation update, which causes the scaling of the noise terms to lose favorable dependence on the number of source tasks. This in turn can cause the sample complexity of representation learning to be bottlenecked by the single-task data size. We introduce an adaptation, $\texttt{De-bias}$ & $\texttt{Feature-Whiten}$ ($\texttt{DFW}$), of the popular alternating minimization-descent (AMD) scheme proposed in Collins et al., (2021), and establish linear convergence to the optimal representation with noise level scaling down with the $\textit{total}$ source data size. This leads to generalization bounds on the same order as an oracle empirical risk minimizer. We verify the vital importance of $\texttt{DFW}$ on various numerical simulations. In particular, we show that vanilla alternating-minimization descent fails catastrophically even for iid, but mildly non-isotropic data. Our analysis unifies and generalizes prior work, and provides a flexible framework for a wider range of applications, such as in controls and dynamical systems. | Thomas T. C. K.

However, in low-resource or out-of-domain scenarios where the assumption of i.i.d does not necessarily hold true, superfluous (or redundant) relevant features may be supplemental to the mainline features of the model, and be beneficial in making prediction for test dataset with distribution shift. Therefore, instead of squeezing the input information by information bottleneck, we propose to keep as much relevant information as possible in use for making predictions. A three-stage supervised learning framework is designed and implemented to jointly learn the mainline and supplemental features, relieving supplemental features from the suppression of mainline features. Extensive experiments have shown that the learned representations of our method have good in-domain and out-of-domain generalization abilities, especially in low-resource cases. | Zhipeng Xie, Yahe Li |  |

The massive volume and high dynamism of graph streams promote research on data structures of graph summarization, which provides a concise and approximate view of graph streams with sub-linear space and linear construction time, enabling real-time graph analytics in various domains, such as social networking, financing, and cybersecurity. In this work, we propose the Mayfly, the first neural data structure for summarizing graph streams. The Mayfly replaces handcrafted data structures with better accuracy and adaptivity. To cater to practical applications, Mayfly incorporates two offline training phases. During the larval phase, the Mayfly learns basic summarization abilities from automatically and synthetically constituted meta-tasks, and in the metamorphosis phase, it rapidly adapts to real graph streams via meta-tasks. With specific configurations of information pathways, the Mayfly enables flexible support for miscellaneous graph queries, including edge, node, and connectivity queries. Extensive empirical studies show that the Mayfly significantly outperforms its handcrafted competitors. | Yuan Feng, Yukun Cao, Hairu Wang, Xike Xie, S. Kevin Zhou |  |
| 444 |  |  [Exploring the Common Appearance-Boundary Adaptation for Nighttime Optical Flow](https://openreview.net/forum?id=776lhoaulC) |  | 0 | We investigate a challenging task of nighttime optical flow, which suffers from weakened texture and amplified noise. These degradations weaken discriminative visual features, thus causing invalid motion feature matching. Typically, existing methods employ domain adaptation to transfer knowledge from auxiliary domain to nighttime domain in either input visual space or output motion space. However, this direct adaptation is ineffective, since there exists a large domain gap due to the intrinsic heterogeneous nature of the feature representations between auxiliary and nighttime domains. To overcome this issue, we explore a common-latent space as the intermediate bridge to reinforce the feature alignment between auxiliary and nighttime domains. In this work, we exploit two auxiliary daytime and event domains, and propose a novel common appearance-boundary adaptation framework for nighttime optical flow. In appearance adaptation, we employ the intrinsic image decomposition to embed the auxiliary daytime image and the nighttime image into a reflectance-aligned common space. We discover that motion distributions of the two reflectance maps are very similar, benefiting us to consistently transfer motion appearance knowledge from daytime to nighttime domain. In boundary adaptation, we theoretically derive the motion correlation formula between nighttime image and accumulated events within a spatiotemporal gradient-aligned common space. We figure out that the correlation of the two spatiotemporal gradient maps shares significant discrepancy, benefitting us to contrastively transfer boundary knowledge from event to nighttime domain. Moreover, appearance adaptation and boundary adaptation are complementary to each other, since they could jointly transfer global motion and local boundary knowledge to the nighttime domain. Extensive experiments have been performed to verify the superiority of the proposed method. | Hanyu Zhou, Yi Chang, Haoyue Liu, Wending Yan, Yuxing Duan, Zhiwei Shi, Luxin Yan |  |

Multioutput Gaussian Process (MOGP) methods offer outstanding solutions with tractable predictions and uncertainty quantification. However, their practical applications are hindered by high computational complexity and storage demand. Additionally, there exist model mismatches in existing MOGP models when dealing with non-Gaussian data. To improve the model representation ability in terms of flexibility, optimality, and scalability, this paper introduces a novel multi-output regression framework, termed Graphical MOGP (GMOGP), which is empowered by: (i) Generating flexible Gaussian process priors consolidated from dentified parents, (ii) providing dependent processes with attention-based graphical representations, and (iii) achieving Pareto optimal solutions of kernel hyperparameters via a distributed learning framework. Numerical results confirm that the proposed GMOGP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MOGP alternatives in predictive performance, as well as in time and memory efficiency, across various synthetic and real datasets. | Yijue Dai, Wenzhong Yan, Feng Yin |  |

However, contrasting similar time series instances or values from adjacent timestamps within a time series leads to ignore their inherent correlations, which results in deteriorating the quality of learned representations. To address this issue, we propose \textit{SoftCLT}, a simple yet effective soft contrastive learning strategy for time series. This is achieved by introducing instance-wise and temporal contrastive loss with soft assignments ranging from zero to one. Specifically, we define soft assignments for 1) instance-wise contrastive loss by distance between time series on the data space, warping and 2) temporal contrastive loss by the difference of timestamps. SoftCLT is a plug-and-play method for time series contrastive learning that improves the quality of learned representations without bells and whistles. In experiments, we demonstrate that SoftCLT consistently improves the performance in various downstream tasks including classification, semi-supervised learning, transfer learning, and anomaly detection, showing state-of-the-art performance.

The most commonly adopted group fairness-enhancing techniques are in-processing methods that rely on a mixture of a fairness objective (e.g., demographic parity) and a task-specific objective (e.g., cross-entropy) during the training process. However, when data arrives in an online fashion – one instance at a time – optimizing such fairness objectives poses several challenges. In particular, group fairness objectives are defined using expectations of predictions across different demographic groups. In the online setting, where the algorithm has access to a single instance at a time, estimating the group fairness objective requires additional storage and significantly more computation (e.g., forward/backward passes) than the task-specific objective at every time step. In this paper, we propose Aranyani, an ensemble of oblique decision trees, to make fair decisions in online settings. The hierarchical tree structure of Aranyani enables parameter isolation and allows us to efficiently compute the fairness gradients using aggregate statistics of previous decisions, eliminating the need for additional storage and forward/backward passes. We also present an efficient framework to train Aranyani and theoretically analyze several of its properties. We conduct empirical evaluations on 5 publicly available benchmarks (including vision and language datasets) to show that Aranyani achieves a better accuracy-fairness trade-off compared to baseline approaches. | Somnath Basu Roy Chowdhury, Nicholas Monath, Ahmad Beirami, Rahul Kidambi, Kumar Avinava Dubey, Amr Ahmed, Snigdha Chaturvedi |  |

Synthesizing financial time series to augment real-world data is challenging due to the irregular and scale-invariant patterns uniquely associated with financial time series - temporal dynamics that repeat with varying duration and magnitude. Such dynamics cannot be captured by existing approaches, which often assume regularity and uniformity in the underlying data. We develop a novel generative framework called FTS-Diffusion to model irregular and scale-invariant patterns that consists of three modules. First, we develop a scale-invariant pattern recognition algorithm to extract recurring patterns that vary in duration and magnitude. Second, we construct a diffusion-based generative network to synthesize segments of patterns. Third, we model the temporal transition of patterns in order to aggregate the generated segments. Extensive experiments show that FTS-Diffusion generates synthetic financial time series highly resembling observed data, outperforming state-of-the-art alternatives. Two downstream experiments demonstrate that augmenting real-world data with synthetic data generated by FTS-Diffusion reduces the error of stock market prediction by up to 17.9%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on generating intricate time series with irregular and scale-invariant patterns, addressing data limitation issues in finance. | Hongbin Huang, Minghua Chen, Xiao Qiao |  |

Previous works proposed methods to detect these AI-generated texts, including simple ML classifiers, pretrained-model-based zero-shot methods, and finetuned language classification models. However, mainstream detectors always fail on short texts, like SMSes, Tweets, and reviews. In this paper, a Multiscale Positive-Unlabeled (MPU) training framework is proposed to address the difficulty of short-text detection without sacrificing long-texts. Firstly, we acknowledge the human-resemblance property of short machine texts, and rephrase AI text detection as a partial Positive-Unlabeled (PU) problem by regarding these short machine texts as partially "unlabeled". Then in this PU context, we propose the length-sensitive Multiscale PU Loss, where a recurrent model in abstraction is used to estimate positive priors of scale-variant corpora. Additionally, we introduce a Text Multiscaling module to enrich training corpora. Experiments show that our MPU method augments detection performance on long AI-generated texts, and significantly improves short-text detection of language model detectors. Language Models trained with MPU could outcompete existing detectors on various short-text and long-text detection benchmarks. The codes are available at https://github.com/mindspore-lab/mindone/tree/master/examples/detect_chatgpt and https://github.com/YuchuanTian/AIGC_text_detector. | Yuchuan Tian, Hanting Chen, Xutao Wang, Zheyuan Bai, Qinghua Zhang, Ruifeng Li, Chao Xu, Yunhe Wang |  |

Existing works aiming at addressing this problem are usually based on global variance reduction, which requires a substantial amount of additional memory in a multiplicative factor equal to the total number of clients. An important open problem is to find a lightweight method for FL in the presence of clients with unknown participation rates. In this paper, we address this problem by adapting the aggregation weights in federated averaging (FedAvg) based on the participation history of each client. We first show that, with heterogeneous participation statistics, FedAvg with non-optimal aggregation weights can diverge from the optimal solution of the original FL objective, indicating the need of finding optimal aggregation weights. However, it is difficult to compute the optimal weights when the participation statistics are unknown. To address this problem, we present a new algorithm called FedAU, which improves FedAvg by adaptively weighting the client updates based on online estimates of the optimal weights without knowing the statistics of client participation. We provide a theoretical convergence analysis of FedAU using a novel methodology to connect the estimation error and convergence. Our theoretical results reveal important and interesting insights, while showing that FedAU converges to an optimal solution of the original objective and has desirable properties such as linear speedup. Our experimental results also verify the advantage of FedAU over baseline methods with various participation patterns. | Shiqiang Wang, Mingyue Ji |  |
| 451 |  |  [Identifying the Risks of LM Agents with an LM-Emulated Sandbox](https://openreview.net/forum?id=GEcwtMk1uA) |  | 0 | Recent advances in Language Model (LM) agents and tool use, exemplified by applications like ChatGPT Plugins, enable a rich set of capabilities but also amplify potential risks—such as leaking private data or causing financial losses. Identifying these risks is labor-intensive, necessitating implementing the tools, setting up the environment for each test scenario manually, and finding risky cases. As tools and agents become more complex, the high cost of testing these agents will make it increasingly difficult to find high-stakes, long-tail risks. To address these challenges, we introduce ToolEmu: a framework that uses an LM to emulate tool execution and enables scalable testing of LM agents against a diverse range of tools and scenarios. Alongside the emulator, we develop an LM-based automatic safety evaluator that examines agent failures and quantifies associated risks. We test both the tool emulator and evaluator through human evaluation and find that 68.8% of failures identified with ToolEmu would be valid real-world agent failures. Using our curated initial benchmark consisting of 36 high-stakes toolkits and 144 test cases, we provide a quantitative risk analysis of current LM agents and identify numerous failures with potentially severe outcomes. Notably, even the safest LM agent exhibits such failures 23.9% of the time according to our evaluator, underscoring the need to develop safer LM agents for real-world deployment. | Yangjun Ruan, Honghua Dong, Andrew Wang, Silviu Pitis, Yongchao Zhou, Jimmy Ba, Yann Dubois, Chris J.

However, most prior work on generative models for code focuses solely on creating new code, overlooking the distinctive needs of editing existing code. In this work, we explore a multi-round code auto-editing setting, aiming to predict edits to a code region based on recent changes within the same codebase. Our model, Coeditor, is a fine-tuned language model specifically designed for code editing tasks. We represent code changes using a line diff format and employ static analysis to form large customized model contexts, ensuring the availability of appropriate information for prediction. We collect a code editing dataset from the commit histories of 1650 open-source Python projects for training and evaluation. In a simplified single-round, single-edit task, Coeditor significantly outperforms GPT-3.5 and SOTA open-source code completion models (bringing exact-match accuracy from 34.7 up to 60.4), demonstrating the benefits of incorporating editing history for code completion. In a multi-round, multi-edit setting, we observe substantial gains by iteratively conditioning on additional user edits. We have open-sourced our code, data, and model weights to encourage future research and have released a VSCode extension powered by our model for interactive IDE usage. | Jiayi Wei, Greg Durrett, Isil Dillig |  |

Unlike existing models that directly process raw time-domain data, FITS operates on the principle that time series can be manipulated through interpolation in the complex frequency domain, achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art models for time series forecasting and anomaly detection tasks. Notably, FITS accomplishes this with a svelte profile of just about $10k$ parameters, making it ideally suited for edge devices and paving the way for a wide range of applications.

Despite the great success, most existing open-source LLMs (\eg, LLaMA-2) are still far away from satisfactory for solving mathematical problems due to the complex reasoning procedures. To bridge this gap, we propose \emph{MetaMath}, a finetuned language model that specializes in mathematical reasoning. Specifically, we start by bootstrapping mathematical questions by rewriting the question from multiple perspectives, which results in a new dataset called MetaMathQA. Then we finetune the LLaMA-2 models on MetaMathQA. Experimental results on two popular benchmarks (\ie, GSM8K and MATH) for mathematical reasoning demonstrate that MetaMath outperforms a suite of open-source LLMs by a significant margin. Our MetaMath-7B model achieves $66.5\%$ on GSM8K and $19.8\%$ on MATH, exceeding the state-of-the-art models of the same size by $11.5\%$ and $8.7\%$. Particularly, MetaMath-70B achieves an accuracy of $82.3\%$ on GSM8K, slightly better than GPT-3.5-Turbo. We release the MetaMathQA dataset, the MetaMath models with different model sizes and the training code for public use. | Longhui Yu, Weisen Jiang, Han Shi, Jincheng Yu, Zhengying Liu, Yu Zhang, James T.

To improve feedback efficiency, most existing PbRL methods focus on selecting queries to maximally improve the overall quality of the reward model, but counter-intuitively, we find that this may not necessarily lead to improved performance. To unravel this mystery, we identify a long-neglected issue in the query selection schemes of existing PbRL studies: Query-Policy Misalignment. We show that the seemingly informative queries selected to improve the overall quality of reward model actually may not align with RL agents’ interests, thus offering little help on policy learning and eventually resulting in poor feedback efficiency. We show that this issue can be effectively addressed via policy-aligned query and a specially designed hybrid experience replay, which together enforce the bidirectional query-policy alignment. Simple yet elegant, our method can be easily incorporated into existing approaches by changing only a few lines of code. We showcase in comprehensive experiments that our method achieves substantial gains in both human feedback and RL sample efficiency, demonstrating the importance of addressing query-policy misalignment in PbRL tasks. | Xiao Hu, Jianxiong Li, Xianyuan Zhan, QingShan Jia, YaQin Zhang |  |

It is a nontrivial extension of N-BEATS with doubly residual stacking principle (Oreshkin et al. [45]) into a representation learning framework. In particular, it revolves around marginal feature probability measures induced by the intricate composition of residual and feature extracting operators of N-BEATS in each stack and aligns them stack-wise via an approximate of an optimal transport distance referred to as the Sinkhorn divergence. The training loss consists of an empirical risk minimization from multiple source domains, i.e., forecasting loss, and an alignment loss calculated with the Sinkhorn divergence, which allows the model to learn invariant features stack-wise across multiple source data sequences while retaining N-BEATS’s interpretable design and forecasting power. Comprehensive experimental evaluations with ablation studies are provided and the corresponding results demonstrate the proposed model’s forecasting and generalization capabilities. | Joonhun Lee, Myeongho Jeon, Myungjoo Kang, Kyunghyun Park |  |

This paper presents Instructive Decoding (ID), a simple yet effective approach that augments the efficacy of instruction-tuned models. Specifically, ID adjusts the logits for next-token prediction in a contrastive manner, utilizing predictions generated from a manipulated version of the original instruction, referred to as a noisy instruction. This noisy instruction aims to elicit responses that could diverge from the intended instruction yet remain plausible. We conduct experiments across a spectrum of such noisy instructions, ranging from those that insert semantic noise via random words to others like 'opposite' that elicit the deviated responses. Our approach achieves considerable performance gains across various instruction-tuned models and tasks without necessitating any additional parameter updates. Notably, utilizing 'opposite' as the noisy instruction in ID, which shows the maximum divergence from the original instruction, consistently produces the most significant performance gains across multiple models and tasks. | Taehyeon Kim, Joonkee Kim, Gihun Lee, SeYoung Yun |  |

The recent trend of weakly supervised learning has focused on how to learn an accurate classifier from completely unlabeled data, given little supervised information such as class priors. In this paper, we consider a newly proposed weakly supervised learning problem called multi-class classification from multiple unlabeled datasets, where only multiple sets of unlabeled data and their class priors (i.e., the proportions of each class) are provided for training the classifier. To solve this problem, we first propose a classifier-consistent method (CCM) based on a probability transition matrix. However, CCM cannot guarantee risk consistency and lacks of purified supervision information during training. Therefore, we further propose a risk-consistent method (RCM) that progressively purifies supervision information during training by importance weighting. We provide comprehensive theoretical analyses for our methods to demonstrate the statistical consistency. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets and various prior matrices demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methods. | Zixi Wei, Senlin Shu, Yuzhou Cao, Hongxin Wei, Bo An, Lei Feng |  |

Meanwhile, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained significant attention due to their remarkable efficiency and fault tolerance. By synergistically harnessing the energy efficiency inherent in event cameras and the spike-based processing capabilities of SNNs, their integration could enable ultra-low-power application scenarios, such as action recognition tasks. However, existing approaches often entail converting asynchronous events into conventional frames, leading to additional data mapping efforts and a loss of sparsity, contradicting the design concept of SNNs and event cameras. To address this challenge, we propose SpikePoint, a novel end-to-end point-based SNN architecture. SpikePoint excels at processing sparse event cloud data, effectively extracting both global and local features through a singular-stage structure. Leveraging the surrogate training method, SpikePoint achieves high accuracy with few parameters and maintains low power consumption, specifically employing the identity mapping feature extractor on diverse datasets. SpikePoint achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on four event-based action recognition datasets using only 16 timesteps, surpassing other SNN methods. Moreover, it also achieves SOTA performance across all methods on three datasets, utilizing approximately 0.3 % of the parameters and 0.5 % of power consumption employed by artificial neural networks (ANNs). These results emphasize the significance of Point Cloud and pave the way for many ultra-low-power event-based data processing applications. | Hongwei Ren, Yue Zhou, Xiaopeng Lin, Yulong Huang, Haotian Fu, Jie Song, Bojun Cheng |  |

This is a so-called Bernstein-type result in approximation theory, which deduces properties of a target function under the assumption that it can be effectively approximated by a hypothesis space. In particular, we show that nonlinear sequence relationships that can be stably approximated by nonlinear RNNs must have an exponential decaying memory structure - a notion that can be made precise. This extends the previously identified curse of memory in linear RNNs into the general nonlinear setting, and quantifies the essential limitations of the RNN architecture for learning sequential relationships with long-term memory. Based on the analysis, we propose a principled reparameterization method to overcome the limitations. Our theoretical results are confirmed by numerical experiments. | Shida Wang, Zhong Li, Qianxiao Li |  |

While it is common to use importance sampling for OPE, it suffers from high variance when the behavior policy deviates significantly from the target policy. In order to address this issue, some recent works on OPE proposed in-sample learning with importance resampling. Yet, these approaches are not applicable to deterministic target policies for continuous action spaces. To address this limitation, we propose to relax the deterministic target policy using a kernel and learn the kernel metrics that minimize the overall mean squared error of the estimated temporal difference update vector of an action value function, where the action value function is used for policy evaluation. We derive the bias and variance of the estimation error due to this relaxation and provide analytic solutions for the optimal kernel metric. In empirical studies using various test domains, we show that the OPE with in-sample learning using the kernel with optimized metric achieves significantly improved accuracy than other baselines. | Haanvid Lee, Tri Wahyu Guntara, Jongmin Lee, YungKyun Noh, KeeEung Kim |  |

The latest work proposes a GER benchmark with "HyPoradise" dataset to learn the mapping from ASR N-best hypotheses to ground-truth transcription by efficient LLM finetuning, which shows great effectiveness but lacks specificity on noise-robust ASR. In this work, we extend the benchmark to noisy conditions and investigate if we can teach LLMs to perform denoising for GER just like what robust ASR do, where one solution is introducing noise information as a conditioner into LLM. However, directly incorporating noise embeddings from audio encoder could harm the LLM tuning due to cross-modality gap. To this end, we propose to extract a language-space noise embedding from the N-best list to represent the noise conditions of source speech, which can promote the denoising process in GER. Furthermore, in order to enhance its representation ability of audio noise, we design a knowledge distillation (KD) approach via mutual information estimation to distill the real noise information in audio embeddings to our language embedding. Experiments on various latest LLMs demonstrate our approach achieves a new breakthrough with up to 53.9% correction improvement in terms of word error rate while with limited training data. Analysis shows that our language-space noise embedding can well represent the noise conditions of source speech, under which off-the-shelf LLMs show strong ability of language-space denoising. | Yuchen Hu, Chen Chen, ChaoHan Huck Yang, Ruizhe Li, Chao Zhang, PinYu Chen, Engsiong Chng |  |

We introduce a novel two-phase learning approach, H2O-SDF, that discriminates between object and non-object regions within indoor environments. This method achieves a nuanced balance, carefully preserving the geometric integrity of room layouts while also capturing intricate surface details of specific objects. A cornerstone of our two-phase learning framework is the introduction of the Object Surface Field (OSF), a novel concept designed to mitigate the persistent vanishing gradient problem that has previously hindered the capture of high-frequency details in other methods. Our proposed approach is validated through several experiments that include ablation studies. | Minyoung Park, Mirae Do, YeonJae Shin, Jaeseok Yoo, Jongkwang Hong, Joongrock Kim, Chul Lee |  |

Although QD has demonstrated competitive performance in reinforcement learning, its low sample efficiency remains a significant impediment for real-world applications. Recent research has primarily focused on augmenting sample efficiency by refining selection and variation operators of QD. However, one of the less considered yet crucial factors is the inherently large-scale issue of the QD optimization problem. In this paper, we propose a novel Cooperative Coevolution QD (CCQD) framework, which decomposes a policy network naturally into two types of layers, corresponding to representation and decision respectively, and thus simplifies the problem significantly. The resulting two (representation and decision) subpopulations are coevolved cooperatively. CCQD can be implemented with different selection and variation operators. Experiments on several popular tasks within the QDAX suite demonstrate that an instantiation of CCQD achieves approximately a 200% improvement in sample efficiency. | Ke Xue, RenJian Wang, Pengyi Li, Dong Li, Jianye Hao, Chao Qian |  |

However, as we show, model performance significantly degrades if trained only on low-risk text (e.g., out-of-copyright books or government documents), due to its limited size and domain coverage. We present SILO, a new language model that manages this risk-performance tradeoff during inference. SILO is built by (1) training a parametric LM on the Open License Corpus (OLC), a new corpus we curate with 228B tokens of public domain and permissively licensed text and (2) augmenting it with a more general and easily modifiable nonparametric datastore (e.g., containing copyrighted books or news) that is only queried during inference. The datastore allows use of high-risk data without training on it, supports sentence-level data attribution, and enables data producers to opt out from the model by removing content from the store. These capabilities can foster compliance with data-use regulations such as the fair use doctrine in the United States and the GDPR in the European Union. Our experiments show that the parametric LM struggles on its own with domains not covered by OLC. However, access to the datastore greatly improves out of domain performance, closing 90% of the performance gap with an LM trained on the Pile, a more diverse corpus with mostly high-risk text. We also analyze which nonparametric approach works best, where the remaining errors lie, and how performance scales with datastore size. Our results suggest that it is possible to build high quality language models while mitigating legal risk. | Sewon Min, Suchin Gururangan, Eric Wallace, Weijia Shi, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, Noah A.

Recent novel CFR variants (e.g., CFR+, DCFR) have significantly improved the convergence rate of the vanilla CFR. The key to these CFR variants’ performance is weighting each iteration non-uniformly, i.e., discounting earlier iterations. However, these algorithms use a fixed, manually-specified scheme to weight each iteration, which enormously limits their potential. In this work, we propose Dynamic Discounted CFR (DDCFR), the first equilibrium-finding framework that discounts prior iterations using a dynamic, automatically-learned scheme. We formalize CFR’s iteration process as a carefully designed Markov decision process and transform the discounting scheme learning problem into a policy optimization problem within it. The learned discounting scheme dynamically weights each iteration on the fly using information available at runtime. Experimental results across multiple games demonstrate that DDCFR’s dynamic discounting scheme has a strong generalization ability and leads to faster convergence with improved performance.

| 467 |  |  [GIO: Gradient Information Optimization for Training Dataset Selection](https://openreview.net/forum?id=3NnfJnbJT2) |  | 0 | It is often advantageous to train models on a subset of the available train examples, because the examples are of variable quality or because one would like to train with fewer examples, without sacrificing performance. We present Gradient Information Optimization (GIO), a scalable, task-agnostic approach to this data selection problem that requires only a small set of (unlabeled) examples representing a target distribution. GIO begins from a natural, information-theoretic objective that is intractable in practice. Our contribution is in showing that it can be made highly scalable through a simple relaxation of the objective and a highly efficient implementation. In experiments with machine translation, spelling correction, and image recognition, we show that GIO delivers outstanding results with very small train sets. These findings are robust to different representation models and hyperparameters for GIO itself. GIO is task- and domain-agnostic and can be applied out-of-the-box to new datasets and domains. We open source a pip-installable implementation of the algorithm as "pip install grad-info-opt". | Dante Everaert, Christopher Potts |  |

Recently, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for extracting insights from data. However, existing models typically specialize in either numeric or symbolic domains, and are usually trained in a supervised manner tailored to specific tasks. This approach neglects the substantial benefits that could arise from a task-agnostic multi-modal understanding between symbolic equations and their numeric counterparts. To bridge the gap, we introduce SNIP, a Symbolic-Numeric Integrated Pre-training model, which employs contrastive learning between symbolic and numeric domains, enhancing their mutual similarities in the embeddings. By performing latent space analysis, we observe that SNIP provides cross-domain insights into the representations, revealing that symbolic supervision enhances the embeddings of numeric data and vice versa. We evaluate SNIP across diverse tasks, including symbolic-to-numeric mathematical property prediction and numeric-to-symbolic equation discovery, commonly known as symbolic regression. Results show that SNIP effectively transfers to various tasks, consistently outperforming fully supervised baselines and competing strongly with established task-specific methods, especially in the low data regime scenarios where available data is limited. | Kazem Meidani, Parshin Shojaee, Chandan K.

| 469 |  |  [Fantastic Gains and Where to Find Them: On the Existence and Prospect of General Knowledge Transfer between Any Pretrained Model](https://openreview.net/forum?id=m50eKHCttz) |  | 0 | Training deep networks requires various design decisions regarding for instance their architecture, data augmentation, or optimization. In this work, we find these training variations to result in networks learning unique feature sets from the data. Using public model libraries comprising thousands of models trained on canonical datasets like ImageNet, we observe that for arbitrary pairings of pretrained models, one model extracts significant data context unavailable in the other – independent of overall performance. Given any arbitrary pairing of pretrained models and no external rankings (such as separate test sets, e.g. due to data privacy), we investigate if it is possible to transfer such "complementary" knowledge from one model to another without performance degradation – a task made particularly difficult as additional knowledge can be contained in stronger, equiperformant or weaker models. Yet facilitating robust transfer in scenarios agnostic to pretrained model pairings would unlock auxiliary gains and knowledge fusion from any model repository without restrictions on model and problem specifics - including from weaker, lower-performance models. This work therefore provides an initial, in-depth exploration on the viability of such general-purpose knowledge transfer. Across large-scale experiments, we first reveal the shortcomings of standard knowledge distillation techniques, and then propose a much more general extension through data partitioning for successful transfer between nearly all pretrained models, which we show can also be done unsupervised. Finally, we assess both the scalability and impact of fundamental model properties on successful model-agnostic knowledge transfer. | Karsten Roth, Lukas Thede, A.

An example is the structured state-space sequence (S4) layer, which uses the diagonal-plus-low-rank structure of the HiPPO initialization framework. However, the complicated structure of the S4 layer poses challenges; and, in an effort to address these challenges, models such as S4D and S5 have considered a purely diagonal structure. This choice simplifies the implementation, improves computational efficiency, and allows channel communication. However, diagonalizing the HiPPO framework is itself an ill-posed problem. In this paper, we propose a general solution for this and related ill-posed diagonalization problems in machine learning. We introduce a generic, backward-stable \`\`perturb-then-diagonalize'' (PTD) methodology, which is based on the pseudospectral theory of non-normal operators, and which may be interpreted as the approximate diagonalization of the non-normal matrices defining SSMs. Based on this, we introduce the S4-PTD and S5-PTD models. Through theoretical analysis of the transfer functions of different initialization schemes, we demonstrate that the S4-PTD/S5-PTD initialization strongly converges to the HiPPO framework, while the S4D/S5 initialization only achieves weak convergences. As a result, our new models show resilience to Fourier-mode noise-perturbed inputs, a crucial property not achieved by the S4D/S5 models. In addition to improved robustness, our S5-PTD model averages 87.6% accuracy on the Long-Range Arena benchmark, demonstrating that the PTD methodology helps to improve the accuracy of deep learning models. | Annan Yu, Arnur Nigmetov, Dmitriy Morozov, Michael W.

Our proposed algorithm consists of two main steps: (1) estimate the implicit reward using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) with general function approximation from offline data and (2) solve a distributionally robust planning problem over a confidence set around the MLE. We consider the general reward setting where the reward can be defined over the whole trajectory and provide a novel guarantee that allows us to learn any target policy with a polynomial number of samples, as long as the target policy is covered by the offline data. This guarantee is the first of its kind with general function approximation. To measure the coverage of the target policy, we introduce a new single-policy concentrability coefficient, which can be upper bounded by the per-trajectory concentrability coefficient. We also establish lower bounds that highlight the necessity of such concentrability and the difference from standard RL, where state-action-wise rewards are directly observed. We further extend and analyze our algorithm when the feedback is given over action pairs. | Wenhao Zhan, Masatoshi Uehara, Nathan Kallus, Jason D. Lee, Wen Sun |  |

Testing Privacy Implications of Language Models via Contextual Integrity Theory](https://openreview.net/forum?id=gmg7t8b4s0) |  | 0 | Existing efforts on quantifying privacy implications for large language models (LLMs) solely focus on measuring leakage of training data. In this work, we shed light on the often-overlooked interactive settings where an LLM receives information from multiple sources and generates an output to be shared with other entities, creating the potential of exposing sensitive input data in inappropriate contexts. In these scenarios, humans nat- urally uphold privacy by choosing whether or not to disclose information depending on the context. We ask the question “Can LLMs demonstrate an equivalent discernment and reasoning capability when considering privacy in context?” We propose CONFAIDE, a benchmark grounded in the theory of contextual integrity and designed to identify critical weaknesses in the privacy reasoning capabilities of instruction-tuned LLMs. CONFAIDE consists of four tiers, gradually increasing in complexity, with the final tier evaluating contextual privacy reasoning and theory of mind capabilities. Our experiments show that even commercial models such as GPT-4 and ChatGPT reveal private information in contexts that humans would not, 39% and 57% of the time, respectively, highlighting the urgent need for a new direction of privacy-preserving approaches as we demonstrate a larger underlying problem stemmed in the models’ lack of reasoning capabilities. | Niloofar Mireshghallah, Hyunwoo Kim, Xuhui Zhou, Yulia Tsvetkov, Maarten Sap, Reza Shokri, Yejin Choi |  |
| 473 |  |  [Provable Reward-Agnostic Preference-Based Reinforcement Learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=yTBXeXdbMf) |  | 0 | Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) is a paradigm in which an RL agent learns to optimize a task using pair-wise preference-based feedback over trajectories, rather than explicit reward signals. While PbRL has demonstrated practical success in fine-tuning language models, existing theoretical work focuses on regret minimization and fails to capture most of the practical frameworks. In this study, we fill in such a gap between theoretical PbRL and practical algorithms by proposing a theoretical reward-agnostic PbRL framework where exploratory trajectories that enable accurate learning of hidden reward functions are acquired before collecting any human feedback. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that our algorithm requires less human feedback for learning the optimal policy under preference-based models with linear parameterization and unknown transitions, compared to the existing theoretical literature. Specifically, our framework can incorporate linear and low-rank MDPs with efficient sample complexity. Additionally, we investigate reward-agnostic RL with action-based comparison feedback and introduce an efficient querying algorithm tailored to this scenario. | Wenhao Zhan, Masatoshi Uehara, Wen Sun, Jason D.

Unlike traditional continuous GNNs that rely on integer-order differential equations, FROND employs the Caputo fractional derivative to leverage the non-local properties of fractional calculus. This approach enables the capture of long-term dependencies in feature updates, moving beyond the Markovian update mechanisms in conventional integer-order models and offering enhanced capabilities in graph representation learning. We offer an interpretation of the node feature updating process in FROND from a non-Markovian random walk perspective when the feature updating is particularly governed by a diffusion process. We demonstrate analytically that oversmoothing can be mitigated in this setting. Experimentally, we validate the FROND framework by comparing the fractional adaptations of various established integer-order continuous GNNs, demonstrating their consistently improved performance and underscoring the framework's potential as an effective extension to enhance traditional continuous GNNs.

These OOD tasks require learning-to-learn from observations of the same (ODE) dynamical system with different unknown ODE parameters, and demand accurate forecasts even under out-of-support initial conditions and out-of-support ODE parameters. In this work we propose to improve the OOD robustness of PIML via a meta-learning procedure for causal structure discovery. Using three different OOD tasks, we empirically observe that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art PIML and deep learning methods (with $2\times$ to $28\times$ lower OOD errors). | S.

| 476 |  |  [Views Can Be Deceiving: Improved SSL Through Feature Space Augmentation](https://openreview.net/forum?id=mutJBk3ILg) |  | 0 | Supervised learning methods have been found to exhibit inductive biases favoring simpler features. When such features are spuriously correlated with the label, this can result in suboptimal performance on minority subgroups. Despite the growing popularity of methods which learn from unlabeled data, the extent to which these representations rely on spurious features for prediction is unclear. In this work, we explore the impact of spurious features on Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for visual representation learning. We first empirically show that commonly used augmentations in SSL can cause undesired invariances in the image space, and illustrate this with a simple example. We further show that classical approaches in combating spurious correlations, such as dataset re-sampling during SSL, do not consistently lead to invariant representations. Motivated by these findings, we propose LateTVG to remove spurious information from these representations during pre-training, by regularizing later layers of the encoder via pruning. We find that our method produces representations which outperform the baselines on several benchmarks, without the need for group or label information during SSL. | Kimia Hamidieh, Haoran Zhang, Swami Sankaranarayanan, Marzyeh Ghassemi |  |

In some situations, target data labels may be expensive to obtain, so we may only have access to a limited number of target data points. To make the most of a very small target dataset, we propose a lightweight, sample-efficient approach that learns a diverse set of features and adapts to a target distribution by interpolating these features. Our approach, Project and Probe (Pro$^2$), first learns a linear projection that maps a pre-trained embedding onto orthogonal directions while being predictive of labels in the source dataset. The goal of this step is to learn a variety of predictive features, so that at least some of them remain useful after distribution shift. Pro$^2$ then learns a linear classifier on top of these projected features using a small target dataset. Theoretically, we find that Pro$^2$ results in more sample-efficient generalization by inducing a favorable bias-variance tradeoff. Our experiments on four datasets, with multiple distribution shift settings for each, show that Pro$^2$ improves performance by 5-15% when given limited target data compared to prior methods such as standard linear probing. | Annie S.

In tasks such as matrix completion, the goal is to converge to the local minimum with the smallest rank that still fits the training data. While rank-underestimating minima can be avoided since they do not fit the data, GD might get stuck at rank-overestimating minima. We show that with SGD, there is always a probability to jump from a higher rank minimum to a lower rank one, but the probability of jumping back is zero. More precisely, we define a sequence of sets $B_{1}\subset B_{2}\subset\cdots\subset B_{R}$ so that $B_{r}$ contains all minima of rank $r$ or less (and not more) that are absorbing for small enough ridge parameters $\lambda$ and learning rates $\eta$: SGD has prob. 0 of leaving $B_{r}$, and from any starting point there is a non-zero prob. for SGD to go in $B_{r}$. | Zihan Wang, Arthur Jacot |  |

However, we are yet to see high-quality, well-structured \*\*whole-song\*\* generation. In this paper, we make the first attempt to model a full music piece under the realization of \*compositional hierarchy\*. With a focus on symbolic representations of pop songs, we define a hierarchical language, in which each level of hierarchy focuses on the semantics and context dependency at a certain music scope. The high-level languages reveal whole-song form, phrase, and cadence, whereas the low-level languages focus on notes, chords, and their local patterns. A cascaded diffusion model is trained to model the hierarchical language, where each level is conditioned on its upper levels. Experiments and analysis show that our model is capable of generating full-piece music with recognizable global verse-chorus structure and cadences, and the music quality is higher than the baselines. Additionally, we show that the proposed model is \*controllable\* in a flexible way. By sampling from the interpretable hierarchical languages or adjusting pre-trained external representations, users can control the music flow via various features such as phrase harmonic structures, rhythmic patterns, and accompaniment texture. | Ziyu Wang, Lejun Min, Gus Xia |  |

This technique has shown particular strength in improving the performance of modestly sized LLMs, sometimes inducing performance competitive with much larger model variants. In this paper, we ask two questions: (1) How sensitive are instruction-tuned models to the particular phrasings of instructions, and, (2) How can we make them more robust to such natural language variation? To answer the former, we collect a set of 319 instructions manually written by NLP practitioners for over 80 unique tasks included in widely used benchmarks, and we evaluate the variance and average performance of these instructions as compared to instruction phrasings observed during instruction fine-tuning. We find that using novel (unobserved) but appropriate instruction phrasings consistently degrades model performance, sometimes substantially so. Further, such natural instructions yield a wide variance in downstream performance, despite their semantic equivalence. Put another way, instruction-tuned models are not especially robust to instruction re-phrasings. We propose a simple method to mitigate this issue by introducing \`\`soft prompt'' embedding parameters and optimizing these to maximize the similarity between representations of semantically equivalent instructions. We show that this method consistently improves the robustness of instruction-tuned models. | Jiuding Sun, Chantal Shaib, Byron C. Wallace |  |

Despite the radical differences between biological and artificial networks, critical learning periods have been empirically observed in both systems. This suggests that critical periods may be fundamental to learning and not an accident of biology. Yet, why exactly critical periods emerge in deep networks is still an open question, and in particular it is unclear whether the critical periods observed in both systems depend on particular architectural or optimization details. To isolate the key underlying factors, we focus on deep linear network models, and show that, surprisingly, such networks also display much of the behavior seen in biology and artificial networks, while being amenable to analytical treatment. We show that critical periods depend on the depth of the model and structure of the data distribution. We also show analytically and in simulations that the learning of features is tied to competition between sources. Finally, we extend our analysis to multi-task learning to show that pre-training on certain tasks can damage the transfer performance on new tasks, and show how this depends on the relationship between tasks and the duration of the pre-training stage. To the best of our knowledge, our work provides the first analytically tractable model that sheds light into why critical learning periods emerge in biological and artificial networks. | Michael Kleinman, Alessandro Achille, Stefano Soatto |  |

TTE models are used for estimating the probability distribution of the time until a specific event occurs, which is an important task in medical settings. TTE models provide many advantages over classification using fixed time horizons, including naturally handling censored observations, but are challenging to train with limited labeled data. MOTOR addresses this challenge by pretraining on up to 55M patient records (9B clinical events). We evaluate MOTOR's transfer learning performance on 19 tasks, across 3 patient databases (a private EHR system, MIMIC-IV, and Merative claims data). Task-specific models adapted from MOTOR improve time-dependent C statistics by 4.6\% over state-of-the-art, improve label efficiency by up to 95\%, and are more robust to temporal distributional shifts. We further evaluate cross-site portability by adapting our MOTOR foundation model for six prediction tasks on the MIMIC-IV dataset, where it outperforms all baselines. MOTOR is the first foundation model for medical TTE predictions and we release a 143M parameter pretrained model for research use at https://huggingface.co/StanfordShahLab/motor-t-base. | Ethan Steinberg, Jason Alan Fries, Yizhe Xu, Nigam Shah |  |

However, existing methods for data generation have generally focused on scene-level diversity (e.g., object instances and poses) rather than task-level diversity, due to the human effort required to come up with and verify novel tasks. This has made it challenging for policies trained on simulation data to demonstrate significant task-level generalization. In this paper, we propose to automatically generate rich simulation environments and expert demonstrations by exploiting a large language models' (LLM) grounding and coding ability. Our approach, dubbed GenSim, has two modes: goal-directed generation, wherein a target task is given to the LLM and the LLM proposes a task curriculum to solve the target task, and exploratory generation, wherein the LLM bootstraps from previous tasks and iteratively proposes novel tasks that would be helpful in solving more complex tasks. We use GPT4 to expand the existing benchmark by ten times to over 100 tasks, on which we conduct supervised finetuning and evaluate several LLMs including finetuned GPTs and Code Llama on code generation for robotic simulation tasks. Furthermore, we observe that LLMs-generated simulation programs can enhance task-level generalization significantly when used for multitask policy training. We further find that with minimal sim-to-real adaptation, the multitask policies pretrained on GPT4-generated simulation tasks exhibit stronger transfer to unseen long-horizon tasks in the real world and outperform baselines by 25%.

However, a theoretical understanding of the exact role of the augmentation remains limited. Recent work has built the connection between self-supervised learning and the approximation of the top eigenspace of a graph Laplacian operator, suggesting that learning a linear probe atop such representation can be connected to RKHS regression. Building on this insight, this work delves into a statistical analysis of augmentation-based pretraining. Starting from the isometry property, a geometric characterization of the target function given by the augmentation, we disentangle the effects of the model and the augmentation, and prove two generalization bounds that are free of model complexity. Our first bound works for an arbitrary encoder, and it is the sum of an estimation error bound incurred by fitting a linear probe, and an approximation error bound by RKHS approximation. Our second bound specifically addresses the case where the encoder extracts the top-d eigenspace of a finite-sample-based approximation of the underlying RKHS. A key ingredient in our analysis is the \*augmentation complexity\*, which we use to quantitatively compare different augmentations and analyze their impact on downstream performance. | Runtian Zhai, Bingbin Liu, Andrej Risteski, J.

However, certain insights into model behavior may only be accessible by observing the trajectory of the training process. We present a case study of syntax acquisition in masked language models (MLMs) that demonstrates how analyzing the evolution of interpretable artifacts throughout training deepens our understanding of emergent behavior. In particular, we study Syntactic Attention Structure (SAS), a naturally emerging property of MLMs wherein specific Transformer heads tend to focus on specific syntactic relations. We identify a brief window in pretraining when models abruptly acquire SAS, concurrent with a steep drop in loss. This breakthrough precipitates the subsequent acquisition of linguistic capabilities. We then examine the causal role of SAS by manipulating SAS during training, and demonstrate that SAS is necessary for the development of grammatical capabilities. We further find that SAS competes with other beneficial traits during training, and that briefly suppressing SAS improves model quality. These findings offer an interpretation of a real-world example of both simplicity bias and breakthrough training dynamics. | Angelica Chen, Ravid ShwartzZiv, Kyunghyun Cho, Matthew L.

Toward this goal, we introduce \foldflow, a series of novel generative models of increasing modeling power based on the flow-matching paradigm over $3\mathrm{D}$ rigid motions---i.e. the group $\mathrm{SE(3)}$---enabling accurate modeling of protein backbones. We first introduce $\text{FoldFlow-Base}$, a simulation-free approach to learning deterministic continuous-time dynamics and matching invariant target distributions on $\mathrm{SE(3)}$. We next accelerate training by incorporating Riemannian optimal transport to create $\text{FoldFlow-OT}$, leading to the construction of both more simple and stable flows. Finally, we design \foldflowsfm, coupling both Riemannian OT and simulation-free training to learn stochastic continuous-time dynamics over $\mathrm{SE(3)}$. Our family of $\text{FoldFlow}$, generative models offers several key advantages over previous approaches to the generative modeling of proteins: they are more stable and faster to train than diffusion-based approaches, and our models enjoy the ability to map any invariant source distribution to any invariant target distribution over $\mathrm{SE(3)}$. Empirically, we validate $\text{FoldFlow}$, on protein backbone generation of up to $300$ amino acids leading to high-quality designable, diverse, and novel samples. | Avishek Joey Bose, Tara AkhoundSadegh, Guillaume Huguet, Kilian Fatras, Jarrid RectorBrooks, ChengHao Liu, Andrei Cristian Nica, Maksym Korablyov, Michael M.

Nevertheless, concerns surrounding data privacy present obstacles due to the tuned prompts' dependency on sensitive private information. A practical solution is to host a local LLM and optimize a soft prompt privately using data. Yet, hosting a local model becomes problematic when model ownership is protected. Alternative methods, like sending data to the model's provider for training, intensify these privacy issues facing an untrusted provider. In this paper, we present a novel solution called Differentially-Private Offsite Prompt Tuning (DP-OPT) to address this challenge. Our approach involves tuning a discrete prompt on the client side and then applying it to the desired cloud models. We demonstrate that prompts suggested by LLMs themselves can be transferred without compromising performance significantly. To ensure that the prompts do not leak private information, we introduce the first private prompt generation mechanism, by a differentially-private (DP) ensemble of in-context learning with private demonstrations. With DP-OPT, generating privacy-preserving prompts by Vicuna-7b can yield competitive performance compared to non-private in-context learning on GPT3.5 or local private prompt tuning.

Recent work embeds coordinates using sine and cosine projections based on Double Fourier Sphere (DFS) features. These embeddings assume a rectangular data domain even on global data, which can lead to artifacts, especially at the poles. At the same time, little attention has been paid to the exact design of the neural network architectures with which these functional embeddings are combined. This work proposes a novel location encoder for globally distributed geographic data that combines spherical harmonic basis functions, natively defined on spherical surfaces, with sinusoidal representation networks (SirenNets) that can be interpreted as learned Double Fourier Sphere embedding. We systematically evaluate positional embeddings and neural network architectures across various benchmarks and synthetic evaluation datasets. In contrast to previous approaches that require the combination of both positional encoding and neural networks to learn meaningful representations, we show that both spherical harmonics and sinusoidal representation networks are competitive on their own but set state-of-the-art performances across tasks when combined.

Bayesian optimization is an automatic, general and sample-efficient method to solve these problems with minimal knowledge of the the underlying function dynamics. However, the ability of Bayesian optimization to incorporate prior knowledge or beliefs about the function at hand in order to accelerate the optimization is limited, which reduces its appeal for knowledgeable practitioners with tight budgets. To allow domain experts to customize the optimization routine, we propose ColaBO, the first Bayesian-principled framework for incorporating prior beliefs beyond the typical kernel structure, such as the likely location of the optimizer or the optimal value. The generality of ColaBO makes it applicable across different Monte Carlo acquisition functions and types of user beliefs. We empirically demonstrate ColaBO's ability to substantially accelerate optimization when the prior information is accurate, and to retain approximately default performance when it is misleading. | Carl Hvarfner, Frank Hutter, Luigi Nardi |  |

The evolution from language chat models to functional language agents demands that models not only master human interaction, reasoning, and planning but also ensure grounding in the relevant environments. This calls for a harmonious blend of language and coding capabilities in the models. Lemur and Lemur-Chat are proposed to address this necessity, demonstrating balanced proficiencies in both domains, unlike existing open-source models that tend to specialize in either. Through meticulous pretraining using a code-intensive corpus and instruction fine-tuning on text and code data, our models achieve state-of-the-art averaged performance across diverse text and coding benchmarks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate Lemur’s superiority over existing open-source models and its proficiency across various agent tasks involving human communication, tool usage, and interaction under fully- and partially- observable environments. The harmonization between natural and programming languages enables Lemur-Chat to significantly narrow the gap with proprietary models on agent abilities, providing key insights into developing advanced open-source agents adept at reasoning, planning, and operating seamlessly across environments. Our model and code have been open-sourced at https://github.com/OpenLemur/Lemur. | Yiheng Xu, Hongjin Su, Chen Xing, Boyu Mi, Qian Liu, Weijia Shi, Binyuan Hui, Fan Zhou, Yitao Liu, Tianbao Xie, Zhoujun Cheng, Siheng Zhao, Lingpeng Kong, Bailin Wang, Caiming Xiong, Tao Yu |  |

These extended path-norms further enjoy the usual benefits of path-norms: ease of computation, invariance under the symmetries of the network, and improved sharpness on layered fully-connected networks compared to the product of operator norms, another complexity measure most commonly used. The versatility of the toolkit and its ease of implementation allow us to challenge the concrete promises of path-norm-based generalization bounds, by numerically evaluating the sharpest known bounds for ResNets on ImageNet. | Antoine Gonon, Nicolas Brisebarre, Elisa Riccietti, Rémi Gribonval |  |
| 492 |  |  [Large Multilingual Models Pivot Zero-Shot Multimodal Learning across Languages](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Kuh5qgCGCp) |  | 0 | Recently there has been a significant surge in multimodal learning in terms of both image-to-text and text-to-image generation. However, the success is typically limited to English, leaving other languages largely behind. Building a competitive counterpart in other languages is highly challenging due to the low-resource nature of non-English multimodal data (i.e., lack of large-scale, high-quality image-text data). In this work, we propose MPM, an effective training paradigm for training large multimodal models in low-resource languages. MPM demonstrates that Multilingual language models can Pivot zero-shot Multimodal learning across languages. Specifically, based on a strong multilingual large language model, multimodal models pretrained on English-only image-text data can well generalize to other languages in a (quasi)-zero-shot manner, even surpassing models trained on image-text data in native languages. Taking Chinese as a practice of MPM, we build large multimodal models VisCPM in image-to-text and text-to-image generation, which achieve state-of-the-art (open-source) performance in Chinese. To facilitate future research, we open-source codes and model weights at https://github.com/OpenBMB/VisCPM. | Jinyi Hu, Yuan Yao, Chongyi Wang, Shan Wang, Yinxu Pan, Qianyu Chen, Tianyu Yu, Hanghao Wu, Yue Zhao, Haoye Zhang, Xu Han, Yankai Lin, Jiao Xue, Dahai Li, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun |  |
| 493 |  |  [From Sparse to Soft Mixtures of Experts](https://openreview.net/forum?id=jxpsAj7ltE) |  | 0 | Sparse mixture of expert architectures (MoEs) scale model capacity without significant increases in training or inference costs. Despite their success, MoEs suffer from a number of issues: training instability, token dropping, inability to scale the number of experts, or ineffective finetuning. In this work, we propose Soft MoE, a fully-differentiable sparse Transformer that addresses these challenges, while maintaining the benefits of MoEs. Soft MoE performs an implicit soft assignment by passing different weighted combinations of all input tokens to each expert. As in other MoEs, experts in Soft MoE only process a subset of the (combined) tokens, enabling larger model capacity (and performance) at lower inference cost. In the context of visual recognition, Soft MoE greatly outperforms dense Transformers (ViTs) and popular MoEs (Tokens Choice and Experts Choice). Soft MoE scales well: Soft MoE Huge/14 with 128 experts in 16 MoE layers has over 40x more parameters than ViT Huge/14, with only 2% increased inference time, and substantially better quality. | Joan Puigcerver, Carlos Riquelme Ruiz, Basil Mustafa, Neil Houlsby |  |

However, before deploying these models in the real world, these must be strictly evaluated on performance measures like worst-case recall and satisfy constraints such as fairness. We find that current state-of-the-art empirical techniques offer sub-optimal performance on these practical, non-decomposable performance objectives. On the other hand, the theoretical techniques necessitate training a new model from scratch for each performance objective. To bridge the gap, we propose SelMix, a selective mixup-based inexpensive fine-tuning technique for pre-trained models, to optimize for the desired objective. The core idea of our framework is to determine a sampling distribution to perform a mixup of features between samples from particular classes such that it optimizes the given objective. We comprehensively evaluate our technique against the existing empirical and theoretically principled methods on standard benchmark datasets for imbalanced classification. We find that proposed SelMix fine-tuning significantly improves the performance for various practical non-decomposable objectives across benchmarks. | Shrinivas Ramasubramanian, Harsh Rangwani, Sho Takemori, Kunal Samanta, Yuhei Umeda, Venkatesh Babu Radhakrishnan |  |

Advanced interpolation methods mainly focus on spherical linear interpolation, where images are encoded into the noise space and then interpolated for denoising to images. However, existing methods face challenges in effectively interpolating natural images (not generated by diffusion models), thereby restricting their practical applicability. Our experimental investigations reveal that these challenges stem from the invalidity of the encoding noise, which may no longer obey the expected noise distribution, e.g., a normal distribution. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach to correct noise for image interpolation, NoiseDiffusion. Specifically, NoiseDiffusion approaches the invalid noise to the expected distribution by introducing subtle Gaussian noise and introduces a constraint to suppress noise with extreme values. In this context, promoting noise validity contributes to mitigating image artifacts, but the constraint and introduced exogenous noise typically lead to a reduction in signal-to-noise ratio, i.e., loss of original image information. Hence, NoiseDiffusion performs interpolation within the noisy image space and injects raw images into these noisy counterparts to address the challenge of information loss. Consequently, NoiseDiffusion enables us to interpolate natural images without causing artifacts or information loss, thus achieving the best interpolation results. | Pengfei Zheng, Yonggang Zhang, Zhen Fang, Tongliang Liu, Defu Lian, Bo Han |  |

Compared to previous versions of Stable Diffusion, SDXL leverages a three times larger UNet backbone, achieved by significantly increasing the number of attention blocks and including a second text encoder. Further, we design multiple novel conditioning schemes and train SDXL on multiple aspect ratios. To ensure highest quality results, we also introduce a refinement model which is used to improve the visual fidelity of samples generated by SDXL using a post-hoc image-to-image technique. We demonstrate that SDXL improves dramatically over previous versions of Stable Diffusion and achieves results competitive with those of black-box state-of-the-art image generators such as Midjourney. | Dustin Podell, Zion English, Kyle Lacey, Andreas Blattmann, Tim Dockhorn, Jonas Müller, Joe Penna, Robin Rombach |  |

In principle, Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a general approach to learn object manipulation. In practice, however, domains with more than a few objects are difficult for RL agents due to the curse of dimensionality, especially when learning from raw image observations. In this work we propose a structured approach for visual RL that is suitable for representing multiple objects and their interaction, and use it to learn goal-conditioned manipulation of several objects. Key to our method is the ability to handle goals with dependencies between the objects (e.g., moving objects in a certain order). We further relate our architecture to the generalization capability of the trained agent, based on a theoretical result for compositional generalization, and demonstrate agents that learn with 3 objects but generalize to similar tasks with over 10 objects.

Such problems have recently gained significant attention due to their broad applicability in machine learning. However, conventional gradient-based methods unavoidably rely on computationally intensive calculations related to the Hessian matrix. To address this challenge, we devise a smooth proximal Lagrangian value function to handle the constrained lower-level problem. Utilizing this construct, we introduce a single-level reformulation for constrained BLOs that transforms the original BLO problem into an equivalent optimization problem with smooth constraints. Enabled by this reformulation, we develop a Hessian-free gradient-based algorithm—termed proximal Lagrangian Value function-based Hessian-free Bi-level Algorithm (LV-HBA)—that is straightforward to implement in a single loop manner. Consequently, LV-HBA is especially well-suited for machine learning applications. Furthermore, we offer non-asymptotic convergence analysis for LV-HBA, eliminating the need for traditional strong convexity assumptions for the lower-level problem while also being capable of accommodating non-singleton scenarios. Empirical results substantiate the algorithm's superior practical performance. | Wei Yao, Chengming Yu, Shangzhi Zeng, Jin Zhang |  |

In this work, we leverage Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) to overcome this issue, and propose a new framework called MILLET: Multiple Instance Learning for Locally Explainable Time series classification. We apply MILLET to existing deep learning TSC models and show how they become inherently interpretable without compromising (and in some cases, even improving) predictive performance. We evaluate MILLET on 85 UCR TSC datasets and also present a novel synthetic dataset that is specially designed to facilitate interpretability evaluation. On these datasets, we show MILLET produces sparse explanations quickly that are of higher quality than other well-known interpretability methods. To the best of our knowledge, our work with MILLET is the first to develop general MIL methods for TSC and apply them to an extensive variety of domains. | Joseph Early, Gavin K. C.

In doing so, we uncover a connection between contrastive representation learning and user verification; by adding a user verification loss to each client’s local SimCLR loss we recover a lower bound to the global multi-view mutual information. To accommodate for the case of when some labelled data are available at the clients, we extend our SimCLR variant to the federated semi-supervised setting. We see that a supervised SimCLR objective can be obtained with two changes: a) the contrastive loss is computed between datapoints that share the same label and b) we require an additional auxiliary head that predicts the correct labels from either of the two views. Along with the proposed SimCLR extensions, we also study how different sources of non-i.i.d.-ness can impact the performance of federated unsupervised learning through global mutual information maximization; we find that a global objective is beneficial for some sources of non-i.i.d.-ness but can be detrimental for others. We empirically evaluate our proposed extensions in various tasks to validate our claims and furthermore demonstrate that our proposed modifications generalize to other pretraining methods. | Christos Louizos, Matthias Reisser, Denis Korzhenkov |  |

First, we present a class of maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) based graph kernels, called MMD-GK. These kernels are computed by applying MMD to the node representations of two graphs with message-passing propagation. Secondly, we provide a class of deep MMD-GKs that are able to learn graph kernels and implicit graph features adaptively in an unsupervised manner. Thirdly, we propose a class of supervised deep MMD-GKs that are able to utilize label information of graphs and hence yield more discriminative metrics. Besides the algorithms, we provide theoretical analysis for the proposed methods. The proposed methods are evaluated in comparison to many baselines such as graph kernels and graph neural networks in the tasks of graph clustering and graph classification. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our methods. | Yan Sun, Jicong Fan |  |

We prove that with data drawn from the Boolean hypercube labeled by the quadratic \`\`XOR'' function $y = -x_ix_j$ , it is possible to train to a population error $o(1)$ with $\Theta(d\text{polylog}(d))$ samples. Our result considers simultaneously training both layers of the two-layer-neural network with ReLU activations via standard minibatch SGD on the logistic loss. To our knowledge, this work is the first to give a sample complexity of for efficiently learning the XOR function on isotropic data on a standard neural network with standard training. Our main technique is showing that the network evolves in two phases: a \em signal-finding \em phase where the network is small and many of the neurons evolve independently to find features, and a \em signal-heavy \em phase, where SGD maintains and balances the features. We leverage the simultaneous training of the layers to show that it is sufficient for only a small fraction of the neurons to learn features, since those neurons will be amplified by the simultaneous growth of their second layer weights. | Margalit Glasgow |  |

However, concerns are raised about potential data contamination in their considerable volume of training corpus. Moreover, the static nature and fixed complexity of current benchmarks may inadequately gauge the advancing capabilities of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce DyVal, a general and flexible protocol for dynamic evaluation of LLMs. Based on our framework, we build graph-informed DyVal by leveraging the structural advantage of directed acyclic graphs to dynamically generate evaluation samples with controllable complexities. DyVal generates challenging evaluation sets on reasoning tasks including mathematics, logical reasoning, and algorithm problems. We evaluate various LLMs ranging from Flan-T5-large to GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4. Experiments show that LLMs perform worse in DyVal-generated evaluation samples with different complexities, highlighting the significance of dynamic evaluation. We also analyze the failure cases and results of different prompting methods. Moreover, DyVal-generated samples are not only evaluation sets, but also helpful data for fine-tuning to improve the performance of LLMs on existing benchmarks. We hope that DyVal can shed light on future evaluation research of LLMs. Code is available at: https://github.com/microsoft/promptbench. | Kaijie Zhu, Jiaao Chen, Jindong Wang, Neil Zhenqiang Gong, Diyi Yang, Xing Xie |  |

Robustifying agent policies requires anticipating the strongest attacks possible. We demonstrate that existing observation-space attacks on reinforcement learning agents have a common weakness: while effective, their lack of information-theoretic detectability constraints makes them \textit{detectable} using automated means or human inspection. Detectability is undesirable to adversaries as it may trigger security escalations. We introduce \textit{\eattacks{}}, a novel form of adversarial attack on sequential decision-makers that is both effective and of $\epsilon-$bounded statistical detectability. We propose a novel dual ascent algorithm to learn such attacks end-to-end. Compared to existing attacks, we empirically find \eattacks{} to be significantly harder to detect with automated methods, and a small study with human participants\footnote{IRB approval under reference R84123/RE001} suggests they are similarly harder to detect for humans. Our findings suggest the need for better anomaly detectors, as well as effective hardware- and system-level defenses.

Signal delay occurs when there is a lag between an agent's perception of the environment and its corresponding actions. In this paper, we first formalize delayed-observation Markov decision processes (DOMDP) by extending the standard MDP framework to incorporate signal delays. Next, we elucidate the challenges posed by the presence of signal delay in DRL, showing that trivial DRL algorithms and generic methods for partially observable tasks suffer greatly from delays. Lastly, we propose effective strategies to overcome these challenges. Our methods achieve remarkable performance in continuous robotic control tasks with large delays, yielding results comparable to those in non-delayed cases. Overall, our work contributes to a deeper understanding of DRL in the presence of signal delays and introduces novel approaches to address the associated challenges. | William Wei Wang, Dongqi Han, Xufang Luo, Dongsheng Li |  |

Through the lens of discrete cosine transformation, we find the main reason is that \*the same noise level on a higher resolution results in a higher Signal-to-Noise Ratio in the frequency domain\*. In this work, we present Relay Diffusion Model (RDM), which transfers a low-resolution image or noise into an equivalent high-resolution one for diffusion model via blurring diffusion and block noise. Therefore, the diffusion process can continue seamlessly in any new resolution or model without restarting from pure noise or low-resolution conditioning. RDM achieves state-of-the-art FID on CelebA-HQ and sFID on ImageNet 256$\times$256, surpassing previous works such as ADM, LDM and DiT by a large margin.

In addition, the generated images should have arbitrary image aspect ratios. When generating images directly at a higher resolution, 1024 x 1024, with the pre-trained Stable Diffusion using training images of resolution 512 x 512, we observe persistent problems of object repetition and unreasonable object structures. Existing works for higher-resolution generation, such as attention-based and joint-diffusion approaches, cannot well address these issues. As a new perspective, we examine the structural components of the U-Net in diffusion models and identify the crucial cause as the limited perception field of convolutional kernels. Based on this key observation, we propose a simple yet effective re-dilation that can dynamically adjust the convolutional perception field during inference. We further propose the dispersed convolution and noise-damped classifier-free guidance, which can enable ultra-high-resolution image generation (e.g., 4096 x 4096). Notably, our approach does not require any training or optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can address the repetition issue well and achieve state-of-the-art performance on higher-resolution image synthesis, especially in texture details. Our work also suggests that a pre-trained diffusion model trained on low-resolution images can be directly used for high-resolution visual generation without further tuning, which may provide insights for future research on ultra-high-resolution image and video synthesis.

| 508 |  |  [DrM: Mastering Visual Reinforcement Learning through Dormant Ratio Minimization](https://openreview.net/forum?id=MSe8YFbhUE) |  | 0 | Visual reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in continuous control tasks. Despite its progress, current algorithms are still unsatisfactory in virtually every aspect of the performance such as sample efficiency, asymptotic performance, and their robustness to the choice of random seeds. In this paper, we identify a major shortcoming in existing visual RL methods that is the agents often exhibit sustained inactivity during early training, thereby limiting their ability to explore effectively. Expanding upon this crucial observation, we additionally unveil a significant correlation between the agents' inclination towards motorically inactive exploration and the absence of neuronal activity within their policy networks. To quantify this inactivity, we adopt dormant ratio as a metric to measure inactivity in the RL agent's network. Empirically, we also recognize that the dormant ratio can act as a standalone indicator of an agent's activity level, regardless of the received reward signals. Leveraging the aforementioned insights, we introduce DrM, a method that uses three core mechanisms to guide agents' exploration-exploitation trade-offs by actively minimizing the dormant ratio. Experiments demonstrate that DrM achieves significant improvements in sample efficiency and asymptotic performance with no broken seeds (76 seeds in total) across three continuous control benchmark environments, including DeepMind Control Suite, MetaWorld, and Adroit. Most importantly, DrM is the first model-free algorithm that consistently solves tasks in both the Dog and Manipulator domains from the DeepMind Control Suite as well as three dexterous hand manipulation tasks without demonstrations in Adroit, all based on pixel observations. | Guowei Xu, Ruijie Zheng, Yongyuan Liang, Xiyao Wang, Zhecheng Yuan, Tianying Ji, Yu Luo, Xiaoyu Liu, Jiaxin Yuan, Pu Hua, Shuzhen Li, Yanjie Ze, Hal Daumé III, Furong Huang, Huazhe Xu |  |
| 509 |  |  [How Over-Parameterization Slows Down Gradient Descent in Matrix Sensing: The Curses of Symmetry and Initialization](https://openreview.net/forum?id=xGvPKAiOhq) |  | 0 | This paper rigorously shows how over-parameterization dramatically changes the convergence behaviors of gradient descent (GD) for the matrix sensing problem, where the goal is to recover an unknown low-rank ground-truth matrix from near-isotropic linear measurements. First, we consider the symmetric setting with the symmetric parameterization where $M^\* \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is a positive semi-definite unknown matrix of rank $r \ll n$, and one uses a symmetric parameterization $XX^\top$ to learn $M^\*$. Here $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times k}$ with $k > r$ is the factor matrix. We give a novel $\Omega\left(1/T^2\right)$ lower bound of randomly initialized GD for the over-parameterized case ($k >r$) where $T$ is the number of iterations. This is in stark contrast to the exact-parameterization scenario ($k=r$) where the convergence rate is $\exp\left(-\Omega\left(T\right)\right)$. Next, we study asymmetric setting where $M^\* \in \mathbb{R}^{n_1 \times n_2}$ is the unknown matrix of rank $r \ll \min\{n_1,n_2\}$, and one uses an asymmetric parameterization $FG^\top$ to learn $M^\*$ where $F \in \mathbb{R}^{n_1 \times k}$ and $G \in \mathbb{R}^{n_2 \times k}$. We give the first global exact convergence result of randomly initialized GD for the exact-parameterization case ($k=r$) with an $\exp\left(-\Omega\left(T\right)\right)$ rate. Furthermore, we give the first global exact convergence result for the over-parameterization case ($k>r$) with an $\exp\left(-\Omega\left(\alpha^2 T\right)\right)$ rate where $\alpha$ is the initialization scale. This linear convergence result in the over-parameterization case is especially significant because one can apply the asymmetric parameterization to the symmetric setting to speed up from $\Omega\left(1/T^2\right)$ to linear convergence. Therefore, we identify a surprising phenomenon: asymmetric parameterization can exponentially speed up convergence. Equally surprising is our analysis that highlights the importance of imbalance between $F$ and $G$. This is in sharp contrast to prior works which emphasize balance. We further give an example showing the dependency on $\alpha$ in the convergence rate is unavoidable in the worst case. On the other hand, we propose a novel method that only modifies one step of GD and obtains a convergence rate independent of $\alpha$, recovering the rate in the exact-parameterization case. We provide empirical studies to verify our theoretical findings. | Nuoya Xiong, Lijun Ding, Simon Shaolei Du |  |

Although current technology for synthesizing images is highly advanced and capable of generating images with high fidelity, it is still possible to give the show away when focusing on the text area in the generated image, as synthesized text often contains blurred, unreadable, or incorrect characters, making visual text generation one of the most challenging issues in this field. To address this issue, we introduce AnyText, a diffusion-based multilingual visual text generation and editing model, that focuses on rendering accurate and coherent text in the image. AnyText comprises a diffusion pipeline with two primary elements: an auxiliary latent module and a text embedding module. The former uses inputs like text glyph, position, and masked image to generate latent features for text generation or editing. The latter employs an OCR model for encoding stroke data as embeddings, which blend with image caption embeddings from the tokenizer to generate texts that seamlessly integrate with the background. We employed text-control diffusion loss and text perceptual loss for training to further enhance writing accuracy. AnyText can write characters in multiple languages, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to address multilingual visual text generation. It is worth mentioning that AnyText can be plugged into existing diffusion models from the community for rendering or editing text accurately. After conducting extensive evaluation experiments, our method has outperformed all other approaches by a significant margin. Additionally, we contribute the first large-scale multilingual text images dataset, AnyWord-3M, containing 3 million image-text pairs with OCR annotations in multiple languages.

Inspired by the great success of code data in training LLMs, we naturally wonder at which training stage introducing code data can really help LLMs reasoning. To this end, this paper systematically explores the impact of code data on LLMs at different stages. Concretely, we introduce the code data at the pre-training stage, instruction-tuning stage, and both of them, respectively. Then, the reasoning capability of LLMs is comprehensively and fairly evaluated via six reasoning tasks. We critically analyze the experimental results and provide conclusions with insights. First, pre-training LLMs with the mixture of code and text can significantly enhance LLMs' general reasoning capability almost without negative transfer on other tasks. Besides, at the instruction-tuning stage, code data endows LLMs the task-specific reasoning capability. Moreover, the dynamic mixing strategy of code and text data assists LLMs to learn reasoning capability step-by-step during training. These insights deepen the understanding of LLMs regarding reasoning ability for their application, such as scientific question answering, legal support, etc. | Yingwei Ma, Yue Liu, Yue Yu, Yuanliang Zhang, Yu Jiang, Changjian Wang, Shanshan Li |  |

Numerous methodologies have been proposed, and techniques employing MLPs and grid representations have achieved substantial success. MLPs allow compact and high expressibility, yet often suffer from spectral bias and slow convergence speed. On the other hand, methods using grids are free from spectral bias and achieve fast training speed, however, at the expense of high spatial complexity. In this work, we propose a novel way for exploiting both MLPs and grid representations in neural fields. Unlike the prevalent methods that combine them sequentially (extract features from the grids first and feed them to the MLP), we inject spectral bias-free grid representations into the intermediate features in the MLP. More specifically, we suggest a Coordinate-Aware Modulation (CAM), which modulates the intermediate features using scale and shift parameters extracted from the grid representations. This can maintain the strengths of MLPs while mitigating any remaining potential biases, facilitating the rapid learning of high-frequency components. In addition, we empirically found that the feature normalizations, which have not been successful in neural filed literature, proved to be effective when applied in conjunction with the proposed CAM. Experimental results demonstrate that CAM enhances the performance of neural representation and improves learning stability across a range of signals. Especially in the novel view synthesis task, we achieved state-of-the-art performance with the least number of parameters and fast training speed for dynamic scenes and the best performance under 1MB memory for static scenes. CAM also outperforms the best-performing video compression methods using neural fields by a large margin.

A ConvBN block can operate in three modes: Train, Eval, and Deploy. While the Train mode is indispensable for training models from scratch, the Eval mode is suitable for transfer learning and beyond, and the Deploy mode is designed for the deployment of models. This paper focuses on the trade-off between stability and efficiency in ConvBN blocks: Deploy mode is efficient but suffers from training instability; Eval mode is widely used in transfer learning but lacks efficiency. To solve the dilemma, we theoretically reveal the reason behind the diminished training stability observed in the Deploy mode. Subsequently, we propose a novel Tune mode to bridge the gap between Eval mode and Deploy mode. The proposed Tune mode is as stable as Eval mode for transfer learning, and its computational efficiency closely matches that of the Deploy mode. Through extensive experiments in object detection, classification, and adversarial example generation across $5$ datasets and $12$ model architectures, we demonstrate that the proposed Tune mode retains the performance while significantly reducing GPU memory footprint and training time, thereby contributing efficient ConvBN blocks for transfer learning and beyond. Our method has been integrated into both PyTorch (general machine learning framework) and MMCV/MMEngine (computer vision framework). Practitioners just need one line of code to enjoy our efficient ConvBN blocks thanks to PyTorch's builtin machine learning compilers. | Kaichao You, Guo Qin, Anchang Bao, Meng Cao, Ping Huang, Jiulong Shan, Mingsheng Long |  |

While the technical level deals with the accurate reconstruction of transmitted symbols, the semantic and effectiveness levels deal with the inferred meaning and its effect on the receiver. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their wide generalizability, make some progress towards the second level. However, LLMs and other communication models are not conventionally designed for predicting and optimizing communication for desired receiver behaviors and intents. As a result, the effectiveness level remains largely untouched by modern communication systems. In this paper, we introduce the receivers' "behavior tokens," such as shares, likes, clicks, purchases, and retweets, in the LLM's training corpora to optimize content for the receivers and predict their behaviors. Other than showing similar performance to LLMs on content understanding tasks, our trained models show generalization capabilities on the behavior dimension for behavior simulation, content simulation, behavior understanding, and behavior domain adaptation. We show results on all these capabilities using a wide range of tasks on three corpora. We call these models Large Content and Behavior Models (LCBMs). Further, to spur more research on LCBMs, we release our new Content Behavior Corpus (CBC), a repository containing communicator, message, and corresponding receiver behavior (https://behavior-in-the-wild.github.io/LCBM). | Ashmit Khandelwal, Aditya Agrawal, Aanisha Bhattacharyya, Yaman Kumar, Somesh Singh, Uttaran Bhattacharya, Ishita Dasgupta, Stefano Petrangeli, Rajiv Ratn Shah, Changyou Chen, Balaji Krishnamurthy |  |

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a promising pathway towards AI alignment but brings forth challenges due to its complexity and dependence on a separate reward model. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has been proposed as an alternative; and it remains equivalent to RLHF under the reverse KL regularization constraint. This paper presents $f$-DPO, a generalized approach to DPO by incorporating diverse divergence constraints. We show that under certain $f$-divergences, including Jensen-Shannon divergence, forward KL divergences and $\alpha$-divergences, the complex relationship between the reward and optimal policy can also be simplified by addressing the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions. This eliminates the need for estimating the normalizing constant in the Bradley-Terry model and enables a tractable mapping between the reward function and the optimal policy. Our approach optimizes LLMs to align with human preferences in a more efficient and supervised manner under a broad set of divergence constraints. Empirically, adopting these divergences ensures a balance between alignment performance and generation diversity. Importantly, our $f$-DPO outperforms PPO-based methods in divergence efficiency, and divergence constraints directly influence expected calibration error (ECE). | Chaoqi Wang, Yibo Jiang, Chenghao Yang, Han Liu, Yuxin Chen |  |
| 516 |  |  [FLASK: Fine-grained Language Model Evaluation based on Alignment Skill Sets](https://openreview.net/forum?id=CYmF38ysDa) |  | 0 | Evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenging because instruction-following necessitates alignment with human values and the required set of skills varies depending on the instruction. However, previous studies have mainly focused on coarse-grained evaluation (i.e. overall preference-based evaluation), which limits interpretability since it does not consider the nature of user instructions that require instance-wise skill composition. In this paper, we introduce FLASK (Fine-grained Language Model Evaluation based on Alignment Skill Sets), a fine-grained evaluation protocol for both human-based and model-based evaluation which decomposes coarse-level scoring to a skill set-level scoring for each instruction. We experimentally observe that the fine-graininess of evaluation is crucial for attaining a holistic view of model performance and increasing the reliability of the evaluation. Using FLASK, we compare multiple open-source and proprietary LLMs and observe a high correlation between model-based and human-based evaluations. | Seonghyeon Ye, Doyoung Kim, Sungdong Kim, Hyeonbin Hwang, Seungone Kim, Yongrae Jo, James Thorne, Juho Kim, Minjoon Seo |  |

In this paper, we introduce LMSYS-Chat-1M, a large-scale dataset containing one million real-world conversations with 25 state-of-the-art LLMs. This dataset is collected from 210K unique IP addresses in the wild on our Vicuna demo and Chatbot Arena website. We offer an overview of the dataset's content, including its curation process, basic statistics, and topic distribution, highlighting its diversity, originality, and scale. We demonstrate its versatility through four use cases: developing content moderation models that perform similarly to GPT-4, building a safety benchmark, training instruction-following models that perform similarly to Vicuna, and creating challenging benchmark questions. We believe that this dataset will serve as a valuable resource for understanding and advancing LLM capabilities.

| 518 |  |  [EfficientDM: Efficient Quantization-Aware Fine-Tuning of Low-Bit Diffusion Models](https://openreview.net/forum?id=UmMa3UNDAz) |  | 0 | Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in image synthesis and related generative tasks. Nevertheless, their practicality for low-latency real-world applications is constrained by substantial computational costs and latency issues. Quantization is a dominant way to compress and accelerate diffusion models, where post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT) are two main approaches, each bearing its own properties. While PTQ exhibits efficiency in terms of both time and data usage, it may lead to diminished performance in low bit-width settings. On the other hand, QAT can help alleviate performance degradation but comes with substantial demands on computational and data resources. To capitalize on the advantages while avoiding their respective drawbacks, we introduce a data-free, quantization-aware and parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework for low-bit diffusion models, dubbed EfficientDM, to achieve QAT-level performance with PTQ-like efficiency. Specifically, we propose a quantization-aware variant of the low-rank adapter (QALoRA) that can be merged with model weights and jointly quantized to low bit-width. The fine-tuning process distills the denoising capabilities of the full-precision model into its quantized counterpart, eliminating the requirement for training data. To further enhance performance, we introduce scale-aware optimization to address ineffective learning of QALoRA due to variations in weight quantization scales across different layers. We also employ temporal learned step-size quantization to handle notable variations in activation distributions across denoising steps. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous PTQ-based diffusion models while maintaining similar time and data efficiency. Specifically, there is only a marginal $0.05$ sFID increase when quantizing both weights and activations of LDM-4 to 4-bit on ImageNet $256\times256$. Compared to QAT-based methods, our EfficientDM also boasts a $16.2\times$ faster quantization speed with comparable generation quality, rendering it a compelling choice for practical applications. | Yefei He, Jing Liu, Weijia Wu, Hong Zhou, Bohan Zhuang |  |

However, running retrieval-augmented language models (LMs) is slow and difficult to scale due to processing large amounts of retrieved text. We introduce binary token representations (BTR), which use 1-bit vectors to precompute every token in passages, significantly reducing computation during inference. Despite the potential loss of accuracy, our new calibration techniques and training objectives restore performance. Combined with offline and runtime compression, this only requires 127GB of disk space for encoding 3 billion tokens in Wikipedia. Our experiments show that on five knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, BTR accelerates state-of-the-art inference by up to 4x and reduces storage by over 100x while maintaining over 95% task performance. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/csarron/BTR. | Qingqing Cao, Sewon Min, Yizhong Wang, Hannaneh Hajishirzi |  |
| 520 |  |  [Frozen Transformers in Language Models Are Effective Visual Encoder Layers](https://openreview.net/forum?id=t0FI3Q66K5) |  | 0 | This paper reveals that large language models (LLMs), despite being trained solely on text data, are surprisingly}strong encoders for purely visual tasks in the absence of language. Even more intriguingly, this can be achieved by a simple yet previously overlooked strategy -- employing a frozen transformer block from pre-trained LLMs as a constituent encoder layer to directly process visual tokens. Our work pushes the boundaries of leveraging LLMs for computer vision tasks, significantly departing from conventional practices that typically necessitate a multi-modal vision-language setup with associated language prompts, inputs, or outputs. We demonstrate that our approach consistently enhances performance across a diverse range of tasks} encompassing pure 2D or 3D visual recognition tasks (e.g., image and point cloud classification), temporal modeling tasks (e.g., action recognition), non-semantic tasks (e.g., motion forecasting), and multi-modal tasks (e.g., 2D/3D visual question answering and image-text retrieval). Such improvements are a general phenomenon, applicable to various types of LLMs (e.g., LLaMA and OPT) and different LLM transformer blocks. We additionally propose the information filtering hypothesis to explain the effectiveness of pre-trained LLMs in visual encoding -- the pre-trained LLM transformer blocks discern informative visual tokens and further amplify their effect. This hypothesis is empirically supported by the observation that the feature activation, after training with LLM transformer blocks, exhibits a stronger focus on relevant regions. We hope that our work inspires new perspectives on utilizing LLMs and deepening our understanding of their underlying mechanisms. | Ziqi Pang, Ziyang Xie, Yunze Man, YuXiong Wang |  |

It consists of (1) information sources from news, social media, reports, etc., (2) a knowledge base built from books, journals, and encyclopedias, plus a toolbox of Internet and knowledge graph search interfaces, (3) 30K high-quality time series in finance, economy, society, and polls, which support a novel task called "hyperportfolio", that can reliably and scalably evaluate societal analysis and decision-making power of agents, inspired by portfolio optimization with time series as assets to "invest". We also propose a novel Analyst-Assistant-Actuator architecture for the hyperportfolio task, and a Hypothesis & Proof prompting for producing in-depth analyses on input news, articles, etc. to assist decision-making. We perform experiments and ablation studies to explore the factors that impact performance. The results show that our proposed method achieves improvements of 32.4% and 30.4% compared to the state-of-the-art method in the two experimental settings. | Junyan Cheng, Peter Chin |  |

However, high-level optimizations such as API and algorithm changes remain elusive due to the difficulty of understanding the semantics of code. Simultaneously, pretrained large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities at solving a wide range of programming tasks. To that end, we introduce a framework for adapting LLMs to high-level program optimization. First, we curate a dataset of performance-improving edits made by human programmers of over 77,000 competitive C++ programming submission pairs, accompanied by extensive unit tests. A major challenge is the significant variability of measuring performance on commodity hardware, which can lead to spurious "improvements." To isolate and reliably evaluate the impact of program optimizations, we design an environment based on the gem5 full system simulator, the de facto simulator used in academia and industry. Next, we propose a broad range of adaptation strategies for code optimization; for prompting, these include retrieval-based few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought, and for finetuning, these include performance-conditioned generation and synthetic data augmentation based on self-play. A combination of these techniques achieves a mean speedup of 6.86$\times$ with eight generations, higher than average optimizations from individual programmers (3.66$\times$). Using our model's fastest generations, we set a new upper limit on the fastest speedup possible for our dataset at 9.64$\times$ compared to using the fastest human submissions available (9.56$\times$). | Alexander Shypula, Aman Madaan, Yimeng Zeng, Uri Alon, Jacob R.

However, MC integration is not optimal in terms of absolute approximation error. To provide a better class of empirical SW, we propose quasi-sliced Wasserstein (QSW) approximations that rely on Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. For a comprehensive investigation of QMC for SW, we focus on the 3D setting, specifically computing the SW between probability measures in three dimensions. In greater detail, we empirically evaluate various methods to construct QMC point sets on the 3D unit-hypersphere, including the Gaussian-based and equal area mappings, generalized spiral points, and optimizing discrepancy energies. Furthermore, to obtain an unbiased estimator for stochastic optimization, we extend QSW to Randomized Quasi-Sliced Wasserstein (RQSW) by introducing randomness in the discussed point sets. Theoretically, we prove the asymptotic convergence of QSW and the unbiasedness of RQSW. Finally, we conduct experiments on various 3D tasks, such as point-cloud comparison, point-cloud interpolation, image style transfer, and training deep point-cloud autoencoders, to demonstrate the favorable performance of the proposed QSW and RQSW variants. | Khai Nguyen, Nicola Bariletto, Nhat Ho |  |
| 524 |  |  [A Poincaré Inequality and Consistency Results for Signal Sampling on Large Graphs](https://openreview.net/forum?id=l3qtSNsPvC) |  | 0 | Large-scale graph machine learning is challenging as the complexity of learning models scales with the graph size. Subsampling the graph is a viable alternative, but sampling on graphs is nontrivial as graphs are non-Euclidean. Existing graph sampling techniques require not only computing the spectra of large matrices but also repeating these computations when the graph changes, e.g., grows. In this paper, we introduce a signal sampling theory for a type of graph limit---the graphon. We prove a Poincaré inequality for graphon signals and show that complements of node subsets satisfying this inequality are unique sampling sets for Paley-Wiener spaces of graphon signals. Exploiting connections with spectral clustering and Gaussian elimination, we prove that such sampling sets are consistent in the sense that unique sampling sets on a convergent graph sequence converge to unique sampling sets on the graphon. We then propose a related graphon signal sampling algorithm for large graphs, and demonstrate its good empirical performance on graph machine learning tasks. | Thien Le, Luana Ruiz, Stefanie Jegelka |  |
| 525 |  |  [Cascading Reinforcement Learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=KjOAHlKMF5) |  | 0 | Cascading bandits have gained popularity in recent years due to their applicability to recommendation systems and online advertising. In the cascading bandit model, at each timestep, an agent recommends an ordered subset of items (called an item list) from a pool of items, each associated with an unknown attraction probability. Then, the user examines the list, and clicks the first attractive item (if any), and after that, the agent receives a reward. The goal of the agent is to maximize the expected cumulative reward. However, the prior literature on cascading bandits ignores the influences of user states (e.g., historical behaviors) on recommendations and the change of states as the session proceeds. Motivated by this fact, we propose a generalized cascading RL framework, which considers the impact of user states and state transition into decisions. In cascading RL, we need to select items not only with large attraction probabilities but also leading to good successor states. This imposes a huge computational challenge due to the combinatorial action space. To tackle this challenge, we delve into the properties of value functions, and design an oracle BestPerm to efficiently find the optimal item list. Equipped with BestPerm, we develop two algorithms CascadingVI and CascadingBPI, which are both computationally-efficient and sample-efficient, and provide near-optimal regret and sample complexity guarantees. Furthermore, we present experiments to show the improved computational and sample efficiencies of our algorithms compared to straightforward adaptations of existing RL algorithms in practice. | Yihan Du, R.

Here we construct a recurrent circuit model that can implicitly represent priors over latent variables, and combine them with sensory and contextual sources of information to encode task-specific posteriors. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models as means of learning and using priors over images, our model uses dendritic nonlinearities optimized for denoising, and stochastic somatic integration with the degree of noise modulated by an oscillating global signal. Combining these elements into a recurrent network yields a stochastic dynamical system that samples from the prior at a rate prescribed by the period of the global oscillator. Additional inputs reflecting sensory or top-down contextual information alter these dynamics to generate samples from the corresponding posterior, with different input gating patterns selecting different inference tasks. We demonstrate that this architecture can sample from low dimensional nonlinear manifolds and multimodal posteriors. Overall, the model provides a new framework for circuit-level representation of probabilistic information, in a format that facilitates flexible inference. | Benjamin Lyo, Cristina Savin |  |
| 527 |  |  [On the hardness of learning under symmetries](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ARPrtuzAnQ) |  | 0 | We study the problem of learning equivariant neural networks via gradient descent. The incorporation of known symmetries ("equivariance") into neural nets has empirically improved the performance of learning pipelines, in domains ranging from biology to computer vision. However, a rich yet separate line of learning theoretic research has demonstrated that actually learning shallow, fully-connected (i.e. non-symmetric) networks has exponential complexity in the correlational statistical query (CSQ) model, a framework encompassing gradient descent. In this work, we ask: are known problem symmetries sufficient to alleviate the fundamental hardness of learning neural nets with gradient descent? We answer this question in the negative. In particular, we give lower bounds for shallow graph neural networks, convolutional networks, invariant polynomials, and frame-averaged networks for permutation subgroups, which all scale either superpolynomially or exponentially in the relevant input dimension. Therefore, in spite of the significant inductive bias imparted via symmetry, actually learning the complete classes of functions represented by equivariant neural networks via gradient descent remains hard. | Bobak T.

However, a well-known concern about traditional task-specific vision models is that they can be misled by imperceptible adversarial perturbations. Furthermore, the concern is exacerbated by the phenomenon that the same adversarial perturbations can fool different task-specific models. Given that VLMs rely on prompts to adapt to different tasks, an intriguing question emerges: Can a single adversarial image mislead all predictions of VLMs when a thousand different prompts are given? This question essentially introduces a novel perspective on adversarial transferability: cross-prompt adversarial transferability. In this work, we propose the Cross-Prompt Attack (CroPA). This proposed method updates the visual adversarial perturbation with learnable textual prompts, which are designed to counteract the misleading effects of the adversarial image. By doing this, CroPA significantly improves the transferability of adversarial examples across prompts. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the strong cross-prompt adversarial transferability of CroPA with prevalent VLMs including Flamingo, BLIP-2, and InstructBLIP in various different tasks. | Haochen Luo, Jindong Gu, Fengyuan Liu, Philip Torr |  |

Recently, large language models have demonstrated exceptional capability in solving different tasks within the language domain. However, a unified model for various graph tasks remains underexplored, primarily due to the challenges unique to the graph learning domain. First, graph data from different areas carry distinct attributes and follow different distributions. Such discrepancy makes it hard to represent graphs in a single representation space. Second, tasks on graphs diversify into node, link, and graph tasks, requiring distinct embedding strategies. Finally, an appropriate graph prompting paradigm for in-context learning is unclear. We propose \*\*One for All (OFA)\*\*, the first general framework that can use a single graph model to address the above challenges. Specifically, OFA proposes text-attributed graphs to unify different graph data by describing nodes and edges with natural language and uses language models to encode the diverse and possibly cross-domain text attributes to feature vectors in the same embedding space. Furthermore, OFA introduces the concept of nodes-of-interest to standardize different tasks with a single task representation. For in-context learning on graphs, OFA introduces a novel graph prompting paradigm that appends prompting substructures to the input graph, which enables it to address varied tasks without fine-tuning. We train the OFA model using graph data from multiple domains (including citation networks, molecular graphs, knowledge graphs, etc.) simultaneously and evaluate its ability in supervised, few-shot, and zero-shot learning scenarios. OFA performs well across different tasks, making it the first general-purpose across-domains classification model on graphs. | Hao Liu, Jiarui Feng, Lecheng Kong, Ningyue Liang, Dacheng Tao, Yixin Chen, Muhan Zhang |  |

However, given a set of 3D shapes with associated covariates there is at present no shape representation method which allows to precisely represent the shapes while capturing the individual dependencies on each covariate. Such a method would be of high utility to researchers to discover knowledge hidden in a population of shapes. For scientific shape discovery purpose, we propose a 3D Neural Additive Model for Interpretable Shape Representation ($\texttt{NAISR}$) which describes individual shapes by deforming a shape atlas in accordance to the effect of disentangled covariates. Our approach captures shape population trends and allows for patient-specific predictions through shape transfer. $\texttt{NAISR}$ is the first approach to combine the benefits of deep implicit shape representations with an atlas deforming according to specified covariates. We evaluate $\texttt{NAISR}$ with respect to shape reconstruction, shape disentanglement, shape evolution, and shape transfer on three datasets, i.e. 1) $\textit{Starman}$, a simulated 2D shape dataset; 2) ADNI hippocampus 3D shape dataset; 3) pediatric airway 3D shape dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that $\texttt{NAISR}$ achieves competitive shape reconstruction performance while retaining interpretability.

While there have been significant recent strides in some cases towards understanding \*how\* neural networks implement specific target functions, this paper explores a complementary question -- \*why\* do networks arrive at particular computational strategies? Our inquiry focuses on the algebraic learning tasks of modular addition, sparse parities, and finite group operations. Our primary theoretical findings analytically characterize the features learned by stylized neural networks for these algebraic tasks. Notably, our main technique demonstrates how the principle of margin maximization alone can be used to fully specify the features learned by the network. Specifically, we prove that the trained networks utilize Fourier features to perform modular addition and employ features corresponding to irreducible group-theoretic representations to perform compositions in general groups, aligning closely with the empirical observations of Nanda et al. (2023) and Chughtai et al. (2023). More generally, we hope our techniques can help to foster a deeper understanding of why neural networks adopt specific computational strategies. | Depen Morwani, Benjamin L.

| 532 |  |  [On the Stability of Iterative Retraining of Generative Models on their own Data](https://openreview.net/forum?id=JORAfH2xFd) |  | 0 | Deep generative models have made tremendous progress in modeling complex data, often exhibiting generation quality that surpasses a typical human's ability to discern the authenticity of samples. Undeniably, a key driver of this success is enabled by the massive amounts of web-scale data consumed by these models. Due to these models' striking performance and ease of availability, the web will inevitably be increasingly populated with synthetic content. Such a fact directly implies that future iterations of generative models will be trained on both clean and artificially generated data from past models. In this paper, we develop a framework to rigorously study the impact of training generative models on mixed datasets---from classical training on real data to self-consuming generative models trained on purely synthetic data. We first prove the stability of iterative training under the condition that the initial generative models approximate the data distribution well enough and the proportion of clean training data (w.r.t. synthetic data) is large enough. We empirically validate our theory on both synthetic and natural images by iteratively training normalizing flows and state-of-the-art diffusion models on CIFAR10 and FFHQ. | Quentin Bertrand, Avishek Joey Bose, Alexandre Duplessis, Marco Jiralerspong, Gauthier Gidel |  |

We build on recent advances in generative modeling that turn text-to-image models into classifiers. This allows us to study their behavior and to compare them against discriminative models and human psychophysical data. We report four intriguing emergent properties of generative classifiers: they show a record-breaking human-like shape bias (99% for Imagen), near human-level out-of-distribution accuracy, state-of-the-art alignment with human classification errors, and they understand certain perceptual illusions. Our results indicate that while the current dominant paradigm for modeling human object recognition is discriminative inference, zero-shot generative models approximate human object recognition data surprisingly well. | Priyank Jaini, Kevin Clark, Robert Geirhos |  |

Yet existing approaches require many demonstrations and/or running (online or offline) reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for each new imitation task. Here we show that recent RL foundation models based on successor measures can imitate any expert behavior almost instantly with just a few demonstrations and no need for RL or fine-tuning, while accommodating several IL principles (behavioral cloning, feature matching, reward-based, and goal-based reductions). In our experiments, imitation via RL foundation models matches, and often surpasses, the performance of SOTA offline IL algorithms, and produces imitation policies from new demonstrations within seconds instead of hours. | Matteo Pirotta, Andrea Tirinzoni, Ahmed Touati, Alessandro Lazaric, Yann Ollivier |  |

Mutual Information Skill Learning (MISL) addresses URL by maximizing the mutual information between states and skills but lacks sufficient theoretical analysis, e.g., how well its learned skills can initialize a downstream task's policy. Our new theoretical analysis shows that the diversity and separatability of learned skills are fundamentally critical to downstream task adaptation but MISL does not necessarily guarantee them. To improve MISL, we propose a novel disentanglement metric LSEPIN and build an information-geometric connection between LSEPIN and downstream task adaptation cost. For better geometric properties, we investigate a new strategy that replaces the KL divergence in information geometry with Wasserstein distance. We extend the geometric analysis to it, which leads to a novel skill-learning objective WSEP. It is theoretically justified to be helpful to task adaptation and it is capable of discovering more initial policies for downstream tasks than MISL. We further propose a Wasserstein distance-based algorithm PWSEP can theoretically discover all potentially optimal initial policies. | Yucheng Yang, Tianyi Zhou, Qiang He, Lei Han, Mykola Pechenizkiy, Meng Fang |  |

Adequate high-quality data, coupled with deep models capable of inference, are both indispensable and prerequisite for achieving meaningful results. However, the sparsity of data and the high costs associated with deploying sensors lead to significant data imbalances. Models that are overly tailored and lack causal relationships further compromise the generalizabilities of inference methods. Towards this end, we first establish a causal concept for ST predictions, named NuwaDynamics, which targets to identify causal regions in data and endow model with causal reasoning ability in a two-stage process. Concretely, we initially leverage upstream self-supervision to discern causal important patches, imbuing the model with generalized information and conducting informed interventions on complementary trivial patches to extrapolate potential test distributions. This phase is referred to as the discovery step. Advancing beyond discovery step, we transfer the data to downstream tasks for targeted ST objectives, aiding the model in recognizing a broader potential distribution and fostering its causal perceptual capabilities (refer as Update step). Our concept aligns seamlessly with the contemporary backdoor adjustment mechanism in causality theory. Extensive experiments on six real-world ST benchmarks showcase that models can gain outcomes upon the integration of the NuwaDynamics concept. NuwaDynamics also can significantly benefit a wide range of changeable ST tasks like extreme weather and long temporal step super-resolution predictions. | Kun Wang, Hao Wu, Yifan Duan, Guibin Zhang, Kai Wang, Xiaojiang Peng, Yu Zheng, Yuxuan Liang, Yang Wang |  |
| 537 |  |  [Pre-Training and Fine-Tuning Generative Flow Networks](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ylhiMfpqkm) |  | 0 | Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are amortized samplers that learn stochastic policies to sequentially generate compositional objects from a given unnormalized reward distribution. They can generate diverse sets of high-reward objects, which is an important consideration in scientific discovery tasks. However, as they are typically trained from a given extrinsic reward function, it remains an important open challenge about how to leverage the power of pre-training and train GFlowNets in an unsupervised fashion for efficient adaptation to downstream tasks. Inspired by recent successes of unsupervised pre-training in various domains, we introduce a novel approach for reward-free pre-training of GFlowNets. By framing the training as a self-supervised problem, we propose an outcome-conditioned GFlowNet (OC-GFN) that learns to explore the candidate space. Specifically, OC-GFN learns to reach any targeted outcomes, akin to goal-conditioned policies in reinforcement learning. We show that the pre-trained OC-GFN model can allow for a direct extraction of a policy capable of sampling from any new reward functions in downstream tasks. Nonetheless, adapting OC-GFN on a downstream task-specific reward involves an intractable marginalization over possible outcomes. We propose a novel way to approximate this marginalization by learning an amortized predictor enabling efficient fine-tuning. Extensive experimental results validate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating the effectiveness of pre-training the OC-GFN, and its ability to swiftly adapt to downstream tasks and discover modes more efficiently. This work may serve as a foundation for further exploration of pre-training strategies in the context of GFlowNets. | Ling Pan, Moksh Jain, Kanika Madan, Yoshua Bengio |  |

Nevertheless, building a vast, high-performance cluster featuring high-speed communication interconnectivity is prohibitively costly, and accessible only to prominent entities. In this work, we aim to lower this barrier and democratize large-scale training with limited bandwidth clusters. We propose a new approach called CO2 that introduces local-updating and asynchronous communication to the distributed data-parallel training, thereby facilitating the full overlap of COmmunication with COmputation. CO2 is able to attain a high scalability even on extensive multi-node clusters constrained by very limited communication bandwidth. We further propose the staleness gap penalty and outer momentum clipping techniques together with CO2 to bolster its convergence and training stability. Besides, CO2 exhibits seamless integration with well-established ZeRO-series optimizers which mitigate memory consumption of model states with large model training. We also provide a mathematical proof of convergence, accompanied by the establishment of a stringent upper bound. Furthermore, we validate our findings through an extensive set of practical experiments encompassing a wide range of tasks in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing. These experiments serve to demonstrate the capabilities of CO2 in terms of convergence, generalization, and scalability when deployed across configurations comprising up to 128 A100 GPUs. The outcomes emphasize the outstanding capacity of CO2 to hugely improve scalability, no matter on clusters with 800Gbps RDMA or 80Gbps TCP/IP inter-node connections. | Weigao Sun, Zhen Qin, Weixuan Sun, Shidi Li, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Yu Qiao, Yiran Zhong |  |

We attribute this problem to the role of the conditioning signal in inference and offer an improved sampling strategy for diffusion models that can increase generation diversity, especially at high guidance scales, with minimal loss of sample quality. Our sampling strategy anneals the conditioning signal by adding scheduled, monotonically decreasing Gaussian noise to the conditioning vector during inference to balance diversity and condition alignment. Our Condition-Annealed Diffusion Sampler (CADS) can be used with any pretrained model and sampling algorithm, and we show that it boosts the diversity of diffusion models in various conditional generation tasks. Further, using an existing pretrained diffusion model, CADS achieves a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.70 and 2.31 for class-conditional ImageNet generation at 256$\times$256 and 512$\times$512 respectively. | Seyedmorteza Sadat, Jakob Buhmann, Derek Bradley, Otmar Hilliges, Romann M.

In contrast, iterative probabilistic algorithms, such as autoregressive and denoising diffusion models, have to be deployed with massive computing resources for decent effect. To achieve high-quality results with low computational cost, we present a novel pixel spread model (PSM) that iteratively employs decoupled probabilistic modeling, combining the optimization efficiency of GANs with the prediction tractability of probabilistic models. As a result, our model selectively spreads informative pixels throughout the image in a few iterations, largely enhancing the completion quality and efficiency. On multiple benchmarks, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance. Our code and models will be publicly available. | Wenbo Li, Xin Yu, Kun Zhou, Yibing Song, Zhe Lin |  |

Existing methods have made great progress with the advanced large vision-language (VL) model in CIR task, however, they generally suffer from two main issues: lack of labeled triplets for model training and difficulty of deployment on resource-restricted environments when deploying the large vision-language model. To tackle the above problems, we propose Image2Sentence based Asymmetric zero-shot composed image retrieval (ISA), which takes advantage of the VL model and only relies on unlabeled images for composition learning. In the framework, we propose a new adaptive token learner that maps an image to a sentence in the word embedding space of VL model. The sentence adaptively captures discriminative visual information and is further integrated with the text modifier. An asymmetric structure is devised for flexible deployment, in which the lightweight model is adopted for the query side while the large VL model is deployed on the gallery side. The global contrastive distillation and the local alignment regularization are adopted for the alignment between the light model and the VL model for CIR task. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed ISA could better cope with the real retrieval scenarios and further improve retrieval accuracy and efficiency. | Yongchao Du, Min Wang, Wengang Zhou, Shuping Hui, Houqiang Li |  |
| 542 |  |  [Bespoke Solvers for Generative Flow Models](https://openreview.net/forum?id=1PXEY7ofFX) |  | 0 | Diffusion or flow-based models are powerful generative paradigms that are notoriously hard to sample as samples are defined as solutions to high-dimensional Ordinary or Stochastic Differential Equations (ODEs/SDEs) which require a large Number of Function Evaluations (NFE) to approximate well. Existing methods to alleviate the costly sampling process include model distillation and designing dedicated ODE solvers. However, distillation is costly to train and sometimes can deteriorate quality, while dedicated solvers still require relatively large NFE to produce high quality samples. In this paper we introduce \`\`Bespoke solvers'', a novel framework for constructing custom ODE solvers tailored to the ODE of a given pre-trained flow model. Our approach optimizes an order consistent and parameter-efficient solver (e.g., with 80 learnable parameters), is trained for roughly 1\% of the GPU time required for training the pre-trained model, and significantly improves approximation and generation quality compared to dedicated solvers. For example, a Bespoke solver for a CIFAR10 model produces samples with Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) of 2.73 with 10 NFE, and gets to 1\% of the Ground Truth (GT) FID (2.59) for this model with only 20 NFE. On the more challenging ImageNet-64$\times$64, Bespoke samples at 2.2 FID with 10 NFE, and gets within 2\% of GT FID (1.71) with 20 NFE. | Neta Shaul, Juan C. Pérez, Ricky T. Q. Chen, Ali K.

However, designing optimization layers requires careful consideration as the underlying optimization problems might be infeasible during training. Motivated by applications in learning, control and robotics, this work focuses on convex quadratic programming (QP) layers. The specific structure of this type of optimization layer can be efficiently exploited for faster computations while still allowing rich modeling capabilities. We leverage primal-dual augmented Lagrangian techniques for computing derivatives of both feasible and infeasible QP solutions. More precisely, we propose a unified approach which tackles the differentiability of the closest feasible QP solutions in a classical $\ell_2$ sense. We then harness this approach to enrich the expressive capabilities of existing QP layers. More precisely, we show how differentiating through infeasible QPs during training enables to drive towards feasibility at test time a new range of QP layers. These layers notably demonstrate superior predictive performance in some conventional learning tasks. Additionally, we present alternative formulations that enhance numerical robustness, speed, and accuracy for training such layers. Along with these contributions, we provide an open-source C++ software package called QPLayer for differentiating feasible and infeasible convex QPs and which can be interfaced with modern learning frameworks. | Antoine Bambade, Fabian Schramm, Adrien B.

We perform extensive evaluations on two datasets: (i) the existing ‘Strogatz’ dataset featuring two-dimensional systems; (ii) ODEBench, a collection of one- to four-dimensional systems that we carefully curated from the literature to provide a more holistic benchmark. ODEFormer consistently outperforms existing methods while displaying substantially improved robustness to noisy and irregularly sampled observations, as well as faster inference.

We prove sublinear regret bounds suggesting simultaneous convergence of the inner-level model parameters and outer-level hyperparameters to optimal configurations for generalization capability. A pivotal, technical novelty in the proofs is modeling the excess risk of the SGD-trained parameters as evaluation noise during Bayesian optimization. Our theory implies the inner unit horizon, defined as the number of SGD iterations, shapes the convergence behavior of BBO. This suggests practical guidance on configuring the inner unit horizon to enhance training efficiency and model performance. | Shi Fu, Fengxiang He, Xinmei Tian, Dacheng Tao |  |

We consider motion as an important cue for identifying parts, that all particles on the same part share the common motion pattern. From the perspective of fluid simulation, existing deformation-based methods for dynamic NeRF can be seen as parameterizing the scene motion under the Eulerian view, i.e., focusing on specific locations in space through which the fluid flows as time passes. However, it is intractable to extract the motion of constituting objects or parts using the Eulerian view representation. In this work, we introduce the dual Lagrangian view and enforce representations under the Eulerian/Lagrangian views to be cycle-consistent. Under the Lagrangian view, we parameterize the scene motion by tracking the trajectory of particles on objects. The Lagrangian view makes it convenient to discover parts by factorizing the scene motion as a composition of part-level rigid motions. Experimentally, our method can achieve fast and high-quality dynamic scene reconstruction from even a single moving camera, and the induced part-based representation allows direct applications of part tracking, animation, 3D scene editing, etc. | Kaizhi Yang, Xiaoshuai Zhang, Zhiao Huang, Xuejin Chen, Zexiang Xu, Hao Su |  |

However, MPNNs face challenges when modeling non-local interactions in systems such as large conjugated molecules, metals, or amorphous materials. Although Spectral GNNs and traditional neural networks such as recurrent neural networks and transformers mitigate these challenges, they often lack extensivity, adaptability, generalizability, computational efficiency, or fail to capture detailed structural relationships or symmetries in the data. To address these concerns, we introduce Matrix Function Neural Networks (MFNs), a novel architecture that parameterizes non-local interactions through analytic matrix equivariant functions. Employing resolvent expansions offers a straightforward implementation and the potential for linear scaling with system size. The MFN architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance in standard graph benchmarks, such as the ZINC and TU datasets, and is able to capture intricate non-local interactions in quantum systems. The code and the datasets will be made public. | Ilyes Batatia, Lars L. Schaaf, Gábor Csányi, Christoph Ortner, Felix A. Faber |  |

This approach overlooks the varying informational content present at different resolutions in speech signals. In contrast, this paper aims to incorporate multi-resolution information into speech self-supervised representation learning. We introduce an SSL model that leverages a hierarchical Transformer architecture, complemented by HuBERT-style masked prediction objectives, to process speech at multiple resolutions. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model not only achieves more efficient inference but also exhibits superior or comparable performance to the original HuBERT model over various tasks. Specifically, significant performance improvements over the original HuBERT have been observed in fine-tuning experiments on the LibriSpeech speech recognition benchmark as well as in evaluations using the Speech Universal PERformance Benchmark (SUPERB) and Multilingual SUPERB (ML-SUPERB). | Jiatong Shi, Hirofumi Inaguma, Xutai Ma, Ilia Kulikov, Anna Y.

Particle-based variational inference (ParVI) methods enhance diversity by formalizing a repulsion term based on a network similarity kernel. However, weight-space repulsion is inefficient due to over-parameterization, while direct function-space repulsion has been found to produce little improvement over DEs. To sidestep these difficulties, we propose First-order Repulsive Deep Ensemble (FoRDE), an ensemble learning method based on ParVI, which performs repulsion in the space of first-order input gradients. As input gradients uniquely characterize a function up to translation and are much smaller in dimension than the weights, this method guarantees that ensemble members are functionally different. Intuitively, diversifying the input gradients encourages each network to learn different features, which is expected to improve the robustness of an ensemble. Experiments on image classification datasets and transfer learning tasks show that FoRDE significantly outperforms the gold-standard DEs and other ensemble methods in accuracy and calibration under covariate shift due to input perturbations. | Trung Q.

Despite advantages of multimodal learning for cancer survival prediction, massive redundancy in multimodal data prevents it from extracting discriminative and compact information: (1) An extensive amount of intra-modal task-unrelated information blurs discriminability, especially for gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs) with many patches in pathology and thousands of pathways in genomic data, leading to an "intra-modal redundancy" issue. (2) Duplicated information among modalities dominates the representation of multimodal data, which makes modality-specific information prone to being ignored, resulting in an "inter-modal redundancy" issue. To address these, we propose a new framework, Prototypical Information Bottlenecking and Disentangling (PIBD), consisting of Prototypical Information Bottleneck (PIB) module for intra-modal redundancy and Prototypical Information Disentanglement (PID) module for inter-modal redundancy. Specifically, a variant of information bottleneck, PIB, is proposed to model prototypes approximating a bunch of instances for different risk levels, which can be used for selection of discriminative instances within modality. PID module decouples entangled multimodal data into compact distinct components: modality-common and modality-specific knowledge, under the guidance of the joint prototypical distribution. Extensive experiments on five cancer benchmark datasets demonstrated our superiority over other methods. The code is released. | Yilan Zhang, Yingxue Xu, Jianqi Chen, Fengying Xie, Hao Chen |  |

As these two tasks require strict and formal multi-step inference, they are appealing domains for exploring the reasoning ability of LLMs but still face important challenges. Previous studies such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) have revealed the effectiveness of intermediate steps guidance. However, such step-wise annotation requires heavy labor, leading to insufficient training steps for current benchmarks. To fill this gap, this work introduces MUSTARD, a data generation framework that masters uniform synthesis of theorem and proof data of high quality and diversity. MUSTARD synthesizes data in three stages: (1) It samples a few mathematical concept seeds as the problem category. (2) Then, it prompts a generative language model with the sampled concepts to obtain both the problems and their step-wise formal solutions. (3) Lastly, the framework utilizes a proof assistant (e.g., Lean Prover) to filter the valid proofs. With the proposed MUSTARD, we present a theorem-and-proof benchmark MUSTARDSAUCE with 5,866 valid data points. Each data point contains an informal statement, an informal proof, and a translated formal proof that passes the prover validation. We perform extensive analysis and demonstrate that MUSTARD generates validated high-quality step-by-step data. We further apply the MUSTARDSAUCE for fine-tuning smaller language models. The fine-tuned Llama 2-7B achieves a 15.41% average relative performance gain in automated theorem proving, and 8.18% in math word problems.

To address this challenge, we introduce a self-supervised, structured representation and generation method that extracts spatial-temporal relationships in periodic or quasi-periodic motions. The motion dynamics in a continuously parameterized latent space enable our method to enhance the interpolation and generalization capabilities of motion learning algorithms. The motion learning controller, informed by the motion parameterization, operates online tracking of a wide range of motions, including targets unseen during training. With a fallback mechanism, the controller dynamically adapts its tracking strategy and automatically resorts to safe action execution when a potentially risky target is proposed. By leveraging the identified spatial-temporal structure, our work opens new possibilities for future advancements in general motion representation and learning algorithms. | Chenhao Li, Elijah StangerJones, Steve Heim, Sangbae Kim |  |

Arguably, backdoor trigger inversion (BTI), which generates trigger patterns of given benign samples for a backdoored model, is the most critical module for backdoor defenses used in these scenarios. With BTI, defenders can remove backdoors by fine-tuning based on generated poisoned samples with ground-truth labels or deactivate backdoors by removing trigger patterns during the inference process. However, we find that existing BTI methods suffer from relatively poor performance, $i.e.$, their generated triggers are significantly different from the ones used by the adversaries even in the feature space. We argue that it is mostly because existing methods require to 'extract' backdoor features at first, while this task is very difficult since defenders have no information ($e.g.$, trigger pattern or target label) about poisoned samples. In this paper, we explore BTI from another perspective where we decouple benign features instead of decoupling backdoor features directly. Specifically, our method consists of two main steps, including \textbf{(1)} decoupling benign features and \textbf{(2)} trigger inversion by minimizing the differences between benign samples and their generated poisoned version in decoupled benign features while maximizing the differences in remaining backdoor features. In particular, our method is more efficient since it doesn't need to \`scan' all classes to speculate the target label, as required by existing BTI. We also exploit our BTI module to further design backdoor-removal and pre-processing-based defenses. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our defenses can reach state-of-the-art performances. | Xiong Xu, Kunzhe Huang, Yiming Li, Zhan Qin, Kui Ren |  |

Accurate trajectory prediction is crucial for effective damage control. Traditional physics-based models, while comprehensive, are computationally intensive and rely heavily on the expertise of forecasters. Contemporary data-driven methods often rely on reanalysis data, which can be considered to be the closest to the true representation of weather conditions. However, reanalysis data is not produced in real-time and requires time for adjustment since prediction models are calibrated with observational data. This reanalysis data, such as ERA5, falls short in challenging real-world situations. Optimal preparedness necessitates predictions at least 72 hours in advance, beyond the capabilities of standard physics models. In response to these constraints, we present an approach that harnesses real-time Unified Model (UM) data, sidestepping the limitations of reanalysis data. Our model provides predictions at 6-hour intervals for up to 72 hours in advance and outperforms both state-of-the-art data-driven methods and numerical weather prediction models. In line with our efforts to mitigate adversities inflicted by \rthree{typhoons}, we release our preprocessed \textit{PHYSICS TRACK} dataset, which includes ERA5 reanalysis data, typhoon best-track, and UM forecast data. | YoungJae Park, Minseok Seo, Doyi Kim, Hyeri Kim, Sanghoon Choi, Beomkyu Choi, Jeongwon Ryu, Sohee Son, HaeGon Jeon, Yeji Choi |  |

These methods aim to distinguish forged faces from genuine ones and have proven effective in practical applications. However, this paper introduces a novel and previously unrecognized threat in face forgery detection scenarios caused by backdoor attack. By embedding backdoors into models and incorporating specific trigger patterns into the input, attackers can deceive detectors into producing erroneous predictions for forged faces. To achieve this goal, this paper proposes \emph{Poisoned Forgery Face} framework, which enables clean-label backdoor attacks on face forgery detectors. Our approach involves constructing a scalable trigger generator and utilizing a novel convolving process to generate translation-sensitive trigger patterns. Moreover, we employ a relative embedding method based on landmark-based regions to enhance the stealthiness of the poisoned samples. Consequently, detectors trained on our poisoned samples are embedded with backdoors. Notably, our approach surpasses SoTA backdoor baselines with a significant improvement in attack success rate (+16.39\% BD-AUC) and reduction in visibility (-12.65\% $L_\infty$). Furthermore, our attack exhibits promising performance against backdoor defenses. We anticipate that this paper will draw greater attention to the potential threats posed by backdoor attacks in face forgery detection scenarios.

Despite advancements in motion quality and physical plausibility, two pivotal factors, versatile interaction control and the development of a user-friendly interface, require further exploration before the practical application of HSI. This paper presents a unified HSI framework, UniHSI, which supports unified control of diverse interactions through language commands. The framework defines interaction as \`\`Chain of Contacts (CoC)", representing steps involving human joint-object part pairs. This concept is inspired by the strong correlation between interaction types and corresponding contact regions. Based on the definition, UniHSI constitutes a Large Language Model (LLM) Planner to translate language prompts into task plans in the form of CoC, and a Unified Controller that turns CoC into uniform task execution. To facilitate training and evaluation, we collect a new dataset named ScenePlan that encompasses thousands of task plans generated by LLMs based on diverse scenarios. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in versatile task execution and generalizability to real scanned scenes. | Zeqi Xiao, Tai Wang, Jingbo Wang, Jinkun Cao, Wenwei Zhang, Bo Dai, Dahua Lin, Jiangmiao Pang |  |

However, existing deep tabular ML methods suffer from the representation entanglement and localization, which largely hinders their prediction performance and leads to performance inconsistency on tabular tasks. To overcome these problems, we explore a novel direction of applying prototype learning for tabular ML and propose a prototype-based tabular representation learning framework, PTaRL, for tabular prediction tasks. The core idea of PTaRL is to construct prototype-based projection space (P-Space) and learn the disentangled representation around global data prototypes. Specifically, PTaRL mainly involves two stages: (i) Prototype Generating, that constructs global prototypes as the basis vectors of P-Space for representation, and (ii) Prototype Projecting, that projects the data samples into P-Space and keeps the core global data information via Optimal Transport. Then, to further acquire the disentangled representations, we constrain PTaRL with two strategies: (i) to diversify the coordinates towards global prototypes of different representations within P-Space, we bring up a diversifying constraint for representation calibration; (ii) to avoid prototype entanglement in P-Space, we introduce a matrix orthogonalization constraint to ensure the independence of global prototypes. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments in PTaRL coupled with state-of-the-art deep tabular ML models on various tabular benchmarks and the results have shown our consistent superiority. | Hangting Ye, Wei Fan, Xiaozhuang Song, Shun Zheng, He Zhao, Dandan Guo, Yi Chang |  |

Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) offer an alternative approach, utilizing neural networks combined with ODE solvers to learn continuous latent representations through parameterized vector fields. Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (Neural SDEs) extend Neural ODEs by incorporating a diffusion term, although this addition is not trivial, particularly when addressing irregular intervals and missing values. Consequently, careful design of drift and diffusion functions is crucial for maintaining stability and enhancing performance, while incautious choices can result in adverse properties such as the absence of strong solutions, stochastic destabilization, or unstable Euler discretizations, significantly affecting Neural SDEs' performance. In this study, we propose three stable classes of Neural SDEs: Langevin-type SDE, Linear Noise SDE, and Geometric SDE. Then, we rigorously demonstrate their robustness in maintaining excellent performance under distribution shift, while effectively preventing overfitting. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets for interpolation, forecasting, and classification tasks, and analyze the robustness of our methods with 30 public datasets under different missing rates. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in handling real-world irregular time series data. | YongKyung Oh, Dongyoung Lim, Sungil Kim |  |

This nascent thesis proposes that facts are recalled from the training corpus through the MLP weights in a manner resembling key-value memory, implying in effect that "knowledge" is stored in the network. Furthermore, by modifying the MLP modules, one can control the language model's generation of factual information. The plausibility of the KN thesis has been demonstrated by the success of KN-inspired model editing methods (Dai et al., 2022; Meng et al., 2022). We find that this thesis is, at best, an oversimplification. Not only have we found that we can edit the expression of certain linguistic phenomena using the same model editing methods but, through a more comprehensive evaluation, we have found that the KN thesis does not adequately explain the process of factual expression. While it is possible to argue that the MLP weights store complex patterns that are interpretable both syntactically and semantically, these patterns do not constitute "knowledge." To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the knowledge representation process, we must look beyond the MLP weights and explore recent models' complex layer structures and attention mechanisms. | Jingcheng Niu, Andrew Liu, Zining Zhu, Gerald Penn |  |

SSM is crucial in clinical research, enabling population-level analysis of morphological variation in bones and organs. Traditional methods of SSM construction have limitations, including the requirement of noise-free surface meshes or binary volumes, reliance on assumptions or templates, and prolonged inference times due to simultaneous optimization of the entire cohort. Point2SSM overcomes these barriers by providing a data-driven solution that infers SSMs directly from raw point clouds, reducing inference burdens and increasing applicability as point clouds are more easily acquired. While deep learning on 3D point clouds has seen success in unsupervised representation learning and shape correspondence, its application to anatomical SSM construction is largely unexplored. We conduct a benchmark of state-of-the-art point cloud deep networks on the SSM task, revealing their limited robustness to clinical challenges such as noisy, sparse, or incomplete input and limited training data. Point2SSM addresses these issues through an attention-based module, providing effective correspondence mappings from learned point features. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing networks in terms of accurate surface sampling and correspondence, better capturing population-level statistics.

In this paper, we focus on domain shifts, which occur when the model is applied to new domains that are different from the ones it was trained on, and propose a new approach called DG. Unlike previous approaches that aim to learn a single model that is domain invariant, DG leverages domain similarities based on domain metadata to learn domain-specific models. Concretely, DG learns a set of training-domain-specific functions during the training stage and reweights them based on domain relations during the test stage. These domain relations can be directly obtained and learned from domain metadata. Under mild assumptions, we theoretically prove that using domain relations to reweight training-domain-specific functions achieves stronger out-of-domain generalization compared to the conventional averaging approach. Empirically, we evaluate the effectiveness of DG using both toy and real-world datasets for tasks such as temperature regression, land use classification, and molecule-protein binding affinity prediction. Our results show that DG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. | Huaxiu Yao, Xinyu Yang, Xinyi Pan, Shengchao Liu, Pang Wei Koh, Chelsea Finn |  |

However, these models lack explicit control over the 3D structure in the generated images. Consequently, this hinders our ability to obtain detailed 3D annotations for the generated images or to craft instances with specific poses and distances. In this paper, we propose 3D Diffusion Style Transfer (3D-DST), which incorporates 3D geometry control into diffusion models. Our method exploits ControlNet, which extends diffusion models by using visual prompts in addition to text prompts. We generate images of the 3D objects taken from 3D shape repositories~(e.g., ShapeNet and Objaverse), render them from a variety of poses and viewing directions, compute the edge maps of the rendered images, and use these edge maps as visual prompts to generate realistic images. With explicit 3D geometry control, we can easily change the 3D structures of the objects in the generated images and obtain ground-truth 3D annotations automatically. This allows us to improve a wide range of vision tasks, e.g., classification and 3D pose estimation, in both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on ImageNet-100/200, ImageNet-R, PASCAL3D+, ObjectNet3D, and OOD-CV. The results show that our method significantly outperforms existing methods, e.g., 3.8 percentage points on ImageNet-100 using DeiT-B.

We prove that in two canonical classification tasks for multi-class high-dimensional mixtures and either 1 or 2-layer neural networks, the SGD trajectory rapidly aligns with emerging low-rank outlier eigenspaces of the Hessian and gradient matrices. Moreover, in multi-layer settings this alignment occurs per layer, with the final layer's outlier eigenspace evolving over the course of training, and exhibiting rank deficiency when the SGD converges to sub-optimal classifiers. This establishes some of the rich predictions that have arisen from extensive numerical studies in the last decade about the spectra of Hessian and information matrices over the course of training in overparametrized networks. | Gérard Ben Arous, Reza Gheissari, Jiaoyang Huang, Aukosh Jagannath |  |

Recent studies have leveraged the power of reinforcement learning (RL) in conjunction with large language models (LLMs), significantly enhancing code generation capabilities. The application of RL focuses on directly optimizing for functional correctness, offering an advantage over conventional supervised methods. Despite policy-based RL methods dominating the literature on RL for program synthesis, the nature of program synthesis tasks hints at a natural alignment with value-based methods. This stems from the rich collection of off-policy programs, including those developed by human programmers and also historical samples, coupled with the straightforward verification of generated programs through automated unit testing, meaning rewards are easy to obtain. Diverging from the dominant use of policy-based algorithms, our work explores the feasibility of value-based approaches, leading to the development of our $\mathcal{B}$-Coder (pronounced Bellman coder). Yet, training value-based methods presents challenges due to the enormous search space inherent to program synthesis. To this end, we introduce an initialization protocol for RL agents utilizing pre-trained LMs and a conservative Bellman operator to reduce training complexities. Moreover, we demonstrate how to leverage the learned value functions as a dual strategy to post-process generated programs. Our empirical evaluations demonstrated $\mathcal{B}$-Coder's capability in achieving state-of-the-art performance when compared to policy-based methods. Remarkably, this achievement is reached with minimal reward engineering effort, highlighting the effectiveness of value-based RL, independent of reward designs. | Zishun Yu, Yunzhe Tao, Liyu Chen, Tao Sun, Hongxia Yang |  |
| 565 |  |  [Adaptive Chameleon or Stubborn Sloth: Revealing the Behavior of Large Language Models in Knowledge Conflicts](https://openreview.net/forum?id=auKAUJZMO6) |  | 0 | By providing external information to large language models (LLMs), tool augmentation (including retrieval augmentation) has emerged as a promising solution for addressing the limitations of LLMs' static parametric memory. However, how receptive are LLMs to such external evidence, especially when the evidence conflicts with their parametric memory? We present the first comprehensive and controlled investigation into the behavior of LLMs when encountering knowledge conflicts. We propose a systematic framework to elicit high-quality parametric memory from LLMs and construct the corresponding counter-memory, which enables us to conduct a series of controlled experiments. Our investigation reveals seemingly contradicting behaviors of LLMs. On the one hand, different from prior wisdom, we find that LLMs can be highly receptive to external evidence even when that conflicts with their parametric memory, given that the external evidence is coherent and convincing. On the other hand, LLMs also demonstrate a strong confirmation bias when the external evidence contains some information that is consistent with their parametric memory, despite being presented with conflicting evidence at the same time. These results pose important implications that are worth careful consideration for the further development and deployment of tool- and retrieval-augmented LLMs. Resources are available at https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/LLM-Knowledge-Conflict. | Jian Xie, Kai Zhang, Jiangjie Chen, Renze Lou, Yu Su |  |
| 566 |  |  [A Hierarchical Bayesian Model for Few-Shot Meta Learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=mQ72XRfYRZ) |  | 0 | We propose a novel hierarchical Bayesian model for the few-shot meta learning problem. We consider episode-wise random variables to model episode-specific generative processes, where these local random variables are governed by a higher-level global random variable. The global variable captures information shared across episodes, while controlling how much the model needs to be adapted to new episodes in a principled Bayesian manner. Within our framework, prediction on a novel episode/task can be seen as a Bayesian inference problem. For tractable training, we need to be able to relate each local episode-specific solution to the global higher-level parameters. We propose a Normal-Inverse-Wishart model, for which establishing this local-global relationship becomes feasible due to the approximate closed-form solutions for the local posterior distributions. The resulting algorithm is more attractive than the MAML in that it does not maintain a costly computational graph for the sequence of gradient descent steps in an episode. Our approach is also different from existing Bayesian meta learning methods in that rather than modeling a single random variable for all episodes, it leverages a hierarchical structure that exploits the local-global relationships desirable for principled Bayesian learning with many related tasks. | Minyoung Kim, Timothy M.

A second trend has been to utilize kernel functions in various explain-by-example or data attribution tasks. In this work, we combine these two trends to analyze approximate empirical neural tangent kernels (eNTK) for data attribution. Approximation is critical for eNTK analysis due to the high computational cost to compute the eNTK. We define new approximate eNTK and perform novel analysis on how well the resulting kernel machine surrogate models correlate with the underlying neural network. We introduce two new random projection variants of approximate eNTK which allow users to tune the time and memory complexity of their calculation. We conclude that kernel machines using approximate neural tangent kernel as the kernel function are effective surrogate models, with the introduced trace NTK the most consistent performer. | Andrew Engel, Zhichao Wang, Natalie Frank, Ioana Dumitriu, Sutanay Choudhury, Anand D.

We also introduce extensions of the idea to distribution shift, quantile risk control, multiple and adversarial risk control, and expectations of U-statistics. Worked examples from computer vision and natural language processing demonstrate the usage of our algorithm to bound the false negative rate, graph distance, and token-level F1-score. | Anastasios Nikolas Angelopoulos, Stephen Bates, Adam Fisch, Lihua Lei, Tal Schuster |  |

Each step in multi-step retrosynthesis planning requires accurate prediction of possible precursor molecules given the target molecule and confidence estimates to guide heuristic search algorithms. We model single-step retrosynthesis as a distribution learning problem in a discrete state space. First, we introduce the Markov Bridge Model, a generative framework aimed to approximate the dependency between two intractable discrete distributions accessible via a finite sample of coupled data points. Our framework is based on the concept of a Markov bridge, a Markov process pinned at its endpoints. Unlike diffusion-based methods, our Markov Bridge Model does not need a tractable noise distribution as a sampling proxy and directly operates on the input product molecules as samples from the intractable prior distribution. We then address the retrosynthesis planning problem with our novel framework and introduce RetroBridge, a template-free retrosynthesis modeling approach that achieves state-of-the-art results on standard evaluation benchmarks. | Ilia Igashov, Arne Schneuing, Marwin H.

Existing methods directly model object joint distributions and express object relations implicitly within a scene, thereby hindering the controllability of generation. We introduce InstructScene, a novel generative framework that integrates a semantic graph prior and a layout decoder to improve controllability and fidelity for 3D scene synthesis. The proposed semantic graph prior jointly learns scene appearances and layout distributions, exhibiting versatility across various downstream tasks in a zero-shot manner. To facilitate the benchmarking for text-driven 3D scene synthesis, we curate a high-quality dataset of scene-instruction pairs with large language and multimodal models. Extensive experimental results reveal that the proposed method surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin. Thorough ablation studies confirm the efficacy of crucial design components. Project page: https://chenguolin.github.io/projects/InstructScene. | Chenguo Lin, Yadong Mu |  |

Compared to the imaging domain, which is rich with large available datasets, the number of data instances for the motion domain is limited, particularly for the animation of animals and exotic creatures (e.g., dragons), which have unique skeletons and motion patterns. In this work, we introduce SinMDM, a Single Motion Diffusion Model. It is designed to learn the internal motifs of a single motion sequence with arbitrary topology and synthesize a variety of motions of arbitrary length that remain faithful to the learned motifs. We harness the power of diffusion models and present a denoising network explicitly designed for the task of learning from a single input motion. SinMDM is crafted as a lightweight architecture, which avoids overfitting by using a shallow network with local attention layers that narrow the receptive field and encourage motion diversity. Our work applies to multiple contexts, including spatial and temporal in-betweening, motion expansion, style transfer, and crowd animation. Our results show that SinMDM outperforms existing methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. Moreover, while prior network-based approaches require additional training for different applications, SinMDM supports these applications during inference. Our project page, which includes links to the code and trained models, is accessible at https://sinmdm.github.io/SinMDM-page. | Sigal Raab, Inbal Leibovitch, Guy Tevet, Moab Arar, Amit Haim Bermano, Daniel CohenOr |  |

The Phy-DRL has three distinguished invariant-embedding designs: i) residual action policy (i.e., integrating data-driven-DRL action policy and physics-model-based action policy), ii) automatically constructed safety-embedded reward, and iii) physics-model-guided neural network (NN) editing, including link editing and activation editing. Theoretically, the Phy-DRL exhibits 1) a mathematically provable safety guarantee and 2) strict compliance of critic and actor networks with physics knowledge about the action-value function and action policy. Finally, we evaluate the Phy-DRL on a cart-pole system and a quadruped robot. The experiments validate our theoretical results and demonstrate that Phy-DRL features guaranteed safety compared to purely data-driven DRL and solely model-based design while offering remarkably fewer learning parameters and fast training towards safety guarantee. | Hongpeng Cao, Yanbing Mao, Lui Sha, Marco Caccamo |  |

However, this intersection of electrochemical science and machine learning poses complex challenges. Machine learning experts often grapple with the intricacies of battery science, while battery researchers face hurdles in adapting intricate models tailored to specific datasets. Beyond this, a cohesive standard for battery degradation modeling, inclusive of data formats and evaluative benchmarks, is conspicuously absent. Recognizing these impediments, we present BatteryML—a one-step, all-encompass, and open-source platform designed to unify data preprocessing, feature extraction, and the implementation of both traditional and state-of-the-art models. This streamlined approach promises to enhance the practicality and efficiency of research applications. BatteryML seeks to fill this void, fostering an environment where experts from diverse specializations can collaboratively contribute, thus elevating the collective understanding and advancement of battery research. | Han Zhang, Xiaofan Gui, Shun Zheng, Ziheng Lu, Yuqi Li, Jiang Bian |  |

They have become essential tools for researchers and practitioners in biology. However, a limitation of vanilla PLMs is their lack of explicit consideration for protein structure information, which suggests the potential for further improvement. Motivated by this, we introduce the concept of a \`\`structure-aware vocabulary" that integrates residue tokens with structure tokens. The structure tokens are derived by encoding the 3D structure of proteins using Foldseek. We then propose SaProt, a large-scale general-purpose PLM trained on an extensive dataset comprising approximately 40 million protein sequences and structures. Through extensive evaluation, our SaProt model surpasses well-established and renowned baselines across 10 significant downstream tasks, demonstrating its exceptional capacity and broad applicability.

This paper introduces PixArt-$\alpha$, a Transformer-based T2I diffusion model whose image generation quality is competitive with state-of-the-art image generators (e.g., Imagen, SDXL, and even Midjourney), reaching near-commercial application standards. Additionally, it supports high-resolution image synthesis up to 1024px resolution with low training cost, as shown in Figure 1 and 2. To achieve this goal, three core designs are proposed: (1) Training strategy decomposition: We devise three distinct training steps that separately optimize pixel dependency, text-image alignment, and image aesthetic quality; (2) Efficient T2I Transformer: We incorporate cross-attention modules into Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to inject text conditions and streamline the computation-intensive class-condition branch; (3) High-informative data: We emphasize the significance of concept density in text-image pairs and leverage a large Vision-Language model to auto-label dense pseudo-captions to assist text-image alignment learning. As a result, PixArt-$\alpha$'s training speed markedly surpasses existing large-scale T2I models, e.g., PixArt-$\alpha$ only takes 10.8% of Stable Diffusion v1.5's training time (~675 vs. ~6,250 A100 GPU days), saving nearly \\$300,000 (\\$26,000 vs. \\$320,000) and reducing 90% CO2 emissions. Moreover, compared with a larger SOTA model, RAPHAEL, our training cost is merely 1%. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PixArt-$\alpha$ excels in image quality, artistry, and semantic control. We hope PixArt-$\alpha$ will provide new insights to the AIGC community and startups to accelerate building their own high-quality yet low-cost generative models from scratch. | Junsong Chen, Jincheng Yu, Chongjian Ge, Lewei Yao, Enze Xie, Zhongdao Wang, James T.

Most existing CIR models adopt the late-fusion strategy to combine visual and language features. Besides, several approaches have also been suggested to generate a pseudo-word token from the reference image, which is further integrated into the relative caption for CIR. However, these pseudo-word-based prompting methods have limitations when target image encompasses complex changes on reference image, e.g., object removal and attribute modification. In this work, we demonstrate that learning an appropriate sentence-level prompt for the relative caption (SPRC) is sufficient for achieving effective composed image retrieval. Instead of relying on pseudo- word-based prompts, we propose to leverage pretrained V-L models, e.g., BLIP-2, to generate sentence-level prompts. By concatenating the learned sentence-level prompt with the relative caption, one can readily use existing text-based image retrieval models to enhance CIR performance. Furthermore, we introduce both image-text contrastive loss and text prompt alignment loss to enforce the learning of suitable sentence-level prompts. Experiments show that our proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art CIR methods on the Fashion-IQ and CIRR datasets. | Yang Bai, Xinxing Xu, Yong Liu, Salman Khan, Fahad Khan, Wangmeng Zuo, Rick Siow Mong Goh, ChunMei Feng |  |

Inverse design is typically formulated as an optimization problem, with recent works leveraging optimization across learned dynamics models. However, as models are optimized they tend to fall into adversarial modes, preventing effective sampling. We illustrate that by instead optimizing over the learned energy function captured by the diffusion model, we can avoid such adversarial examples and significantly improve design performance. We further illustrate how such a design system is compositional, enabling us to combine multiple different diffusion models representing subcomponents of our desired system to design systems with every specified component. In an N-body interaction task and a challenging 2D multi-airfoil design task, we demonstrate that by composing the learned diffusion model at test time, our method allows us to design initial states and boundary shapes that are more complex than those in the training data. Our method generalizes to more objects for N-body dataset and discovers formation flying to minimize drag in the multi-airfoil design task.

AD always outputs the correct derivative if a program does not use any non-differentiable functions and control flows; however, it may return an arbitrary value otherwise. In this work, we investigate what AD computes for neural networks that may contain non-differentiable functions such as ReLU and maxpools. We first prove that AD always returns a generalized derivative called a Clarke subderivative for networks with pointwise activation functions, if the minibatch size is one and all non-differentiable neurons have distinct bias parameters. We show that the same conclusion does not hold otherwise, but does hold under some mild sufficient conditions. We also prove similar results for more general networks that can use maxpools and bias parameters shared across different neurons. We empirically check our sufficient conditions over popular network architectures and observe that AD almost always computes a Clarke subderivative in practical learning setups. | Sejun Park, Sanghyuk Chun, Wonyeol Lee |  |

However, their practical deployment is hindered by their immense memory and computation requirements. Although recent post-training quantization (PTQ) methods are effective in reducing memory footprint and improving the computational efficiency of LLM, they hand-craft quantization parameters, leading to low performance, especially in extremely low-bit quantization. To tackle this issue, we introduce an Omnidirectionally calibrated Quantization ($\textbf{OmniQuant}$) technique for LLMs, which achieves good performance in diverse quantization settings while maintaining the computational efficiency of PTQ by efficiently optimizing various quantization parameters. OmniQuant comprises two innovative components including Learnable Weight Clipping (LWC) and Learnable Equivalent Transformation (LET). LWC modulates the extreme values of weights by optimizing the clipping threshold. Meanwhile, LET tackles activation outliers by shifting the challenge of quantization from activations to weights. Operating within a differentiable framework using block-wise error minimization, OmniQuant can optimize the quantization process efficiently for both weight-only and weight-activation quantization. For instance, the LLaMA-2 model family size 7-70B can be processed with OmniQuant on a single A100-40G GPU within 1-16 hours using 128 samples. Extensive experiments validate OmniQuant's superior performance across diverse quantization configurations such as W4A4 (4-bit weight, 4-bit activation), W6A6, W4A16, W3A16, and W2A16. Additionally, OmniQuant demonstrates effectiveness in instruction-tuned models and delivers notable improvements in inference speed and memory reduction on real devices.

To unify referring and grounding in the LLM paradigm, Ferret employs a novel and powerful hybrid region representation that integrates discrete coordinates and continuous features jointly to represent a region in the image. To extract the continuous features of versatile regions, we propose a spatial-aware visual sampler, adept at handling varying sparsity across different shapes. Consequently, Ferret can accept diverse region inputs, such as points, bounding boxes, and free-form shapes. To bolster the desired capability of Ferret, we curate GRIT, a comprehensive refer-and-ground instruction tuning dataset including 1.1M samples that contain rich hierarchical spatial knowledge, with an additional 130K hard negative data to promote model robustness. The resulting model not only achieves superior performance in classical referring and grounding tasks, but also greatly outperforms existing MLLMs in region-based and localization-demanded multimodal chatting. Our evaluations also reveal a significantly improved capability of describing image details and a remarkable alleviation in object hallucination. | Haoxuan You, Haotian Zhang, Zhe Gan, Xianzhi Du, Bowen Zhang, Zirui Wang, Liangliang Cao, ShihFu Chang, Yinfei Yang |  |

However, existing MU methods focusing on data and/or weight perspectives often suffer limitations in unlearning accuracy, stability, and cross-domain applicability. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of 'weight saliency' for MU, drawing parallels with input saliency in model explanation. This innovation directs MU's attention toward specific model weights rather than the entire model, improving effectiveness and efficiency. The resultant method that we call saliency unlearning (SalUn) narrows the performance gap with 'exact' unlearning (model retraining from scratch after removing the forgetting data points). To the best of our knowledge, SalUn is the first principled MU approach that can effectively erase the influence of forgetting data, classes, or concepts in both image classification and generation tasks. As highlighted below, For example, SalUn yields a stability advantage in high-variance random data forgetting, e.g., with a 0.2% gap compared to exact unlearning on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Moreover, in preventing conditional diffusion models from generating harmful images, SalUn achieves nearly 100% unlearning accuracy, outperforming current state-of-the-art baselines like Erased Stable Diffusion and Forget-Me-Not.

| 582 |  |  [Retroformer: Retrospective Large Language Agents with Policy Gradient Optimization](https://openreview.net/forum?id=KOZu91CzbK) |  | 0 | Recent months have seen the emergence of a powerful new trend in which large language models (LLMs) are augmented to become autonomous language agents capable of performing objective oriented multi-step tasks on their own, rather than merely responding to queries from human users. Most existing language agents, however, are not optimized using environment-specific rewards. Although some agents enable iterative refinement through verbal feedback, they do not reason and plan in ways that are compatible with gradient-based learning from rewards. This paper introduces a principled framework for reinforcing large language agents by learning a retrospective model, which automatically tunes the language agent prompts from environment feedback through policy gradient. Specifically, our proposed agent architecture learns from rewards across multiple environments and tasks, for fine-tuning a pre-trained language model which refines the language agent prompt by summarizing the root cause of prior failed attempts and proposing action plans. Experimental results on various tasks demonstrate that the language agents improve over time and that our approach considerably outperforms baselines that do not properly leverage gradients from the environment. | Weiran Yao, Shelby Heinecke, Juan Carlos Niebles, Zhiwei Liu, Yihao Feng, Le Xue, Rithesh R.

Unsupervised few-shot learning (U-FSL) aspires to bridge this gap by discarding the reliance on annotations at training time. Intrigued by the success of contrastive learning approaches in the realm of U-FSL, we structurally approach their shortcomings in both pretraining and downstream inference stages. We propose a novel Dynamic Clustered mEmory (DyCE) module to promote a highly separable latent representation space for enhancing positive sampling at the pretraining phase and infusing implicit class-level insights into unsupervised contrastive learning. We then tackle the, somehow overlooked yet critical, issue of sample bias at the few-shot inference stage. We propose an iterative Optimal Transport-based distribution Alignment (OpTA) strategy and demonstrate that it efficiently addresses the problem, especially in low-shot scenarios where FSL approaches suffer the most from sample bias. We later on discuss that DyCE and OpTA are two intertwined pieces of a novel end-to-end approach (we coin as BECLR), constructively magnifying each other's impact. We then present a suite of extensive quantitative and qualitative experimentation to corroborate that BECLR sets a new state-of-the-art across ALL existing U-FSL benchmarks (to the best of our knowledge), and significantly outperforms the best of the current baselines (codebase available at https://github.com/stypoumic/BECLR). | Stylianos PoulakakisDaktylidis, Hadi Jamali Rad |  |

Generalizing Matrix Softmax Attention to Kronecker Computation](https://openreview.net/forum?id=v0zNCwwkaV) |  | 0 | In the classical transformer attention scheme, we are given three $n \times d$ size matrices $Q, K, V$ (the query, key, and value tokens), and the goal is to compute a new $n \times d$ size matrix $D^{-1} \exp(QK^\top) V$ where $D = \mathrm{diag}( \exp(QK^\top) {\bf 1}_n )$. Here, $\exp()$ is applied entry-wise and ${\bf 1}_n$ denotes a length-$n$ vector whose entries are all ones. Intuitively, attention computation captures pairwise information between words in a sentence, but not higher-order information. Indeed, recent work \cite{sht23} has shown that attention units cannot solve simple problems about detecting triples of connected words. In this work, we study a generalization of attention which captures triple-wise correlations. The generalization is based on computations involving tensors defined by tuples of words. More formally, given five $n \times d$ size matrices $Q, K_1, K_2, V_1$ and $V_2$ (generalized query, key, and value tokens), our new goal is to compute an $n \times d$ size matrix $D^{-1} \exp( Q ( K_1 \oslash K_2)^\top ) (V_1 \oslash V_2) $ where $D = \mathrm{diag}( \exp( Q ( K_1 \oslash K_2)^\top ) {\bf 1}_{n^2} )$ and $K_1 \oslash K_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{n^2 \times d}$ denotes the column-wise Kronecker product of $K_1$ and $K_2$. This generalization is indeed able to solve problems about detecting triple-wise connections that were shown to be impossible for transformers. The potential downside of this generalization is that it appears as though computations are even more difficult, since the straightforward algorithm requires cubic time in $n$. However, we show that in the bounded-entry setting (which arises in practice, and which is well-studied in both theory and practice), there is actually a near-linear time algorithm. More precisely, we show that bounded entries are both necessary and sufficient for quickly performing generalized computations: $\bullet$ On the positive side, if all entries of the input matrices are bounded above by $o(\sqrt[3]{\log n})$ then we show how to approximate the \`\`tensor-type'' attention matrix in $n^{1+o(1)}$ time. $\bullet$ On the negative side, we show that if the entries of the input matrices may be as large as $\Omega(\sqrt[3]{\log n})$, then there is no algorithm that runs faster than $n^{3-o(1)}$ (assuming the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis from fine-grained complexity theory). We also show that our construction, algorithms, and lower bounds naturally generalize to higher-order tensors and correlations. Interestingly, the higher the order of the tensors, the lower the bound on the entries needs to be for an efficient algorithm. Our results thus yield a natural tradeoff between the boundedness of the entries, and order of the tensor one may use for more expressive, efficient attention computation. Our constructions make use of a novel connection with a higher-order variant on the kernel density estimation problem. They combine a number of technical tools, including the polynomial method, algebraic geometry codes, and multiparty Merlin-Arthur communication protocols. | Josh Alman, Zhao Song |  |

DreamLLM operates on two fundamental principles. The first focuses on the generative modeling of both language and image posteriors by direct sampling in the raw multimodal space. This approach circumvents the limitations and information loss inherent to external feature extractors like CLIP, and a more thorough multimodal understanding is obtained. Second, DreamLLM fosters the generation of raw, interleaved documents, modeling both text and image contents, along with unstructured layouts. This allows DreamLLM to learn all conditional, marginal, and joint multimodal distributions effectively. As a result, DreamLLM is the first MLLM capable of generating free-form interleaved content. Comprehensive experiments highlight DreamLLM's superior performance as a zero-shot multimodal generalist, reaping from the enhanced learning synergy.

Our method leverages images as a task-agnostic representation, encoding both the state and action information, and text as a general representation for specifying robot goals. By synthesizing videos that "hallucinate" robot executing actions and in combination with dense correspondences between frames, our approach can infer the closed-formed action to execute to an environment without the need of any explicit action labels. This unique capability allows us to train the policy solely based on RGB videos and deploy learned policies to various robotic tasks. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in learning policies on table-top manipulation and navigation tasks. Additionally, we contribute an open-source framework for efficient video modeling, enabling the training of high-fidelity policy models with four GPUs within a single day. | PoChen Ko, Jiayuan Mao, Yilun Du, ShaoHua Sun, Joshua B.

| 587 |  |  [On Penalty Methods for Nonconvex Bilevel Optimization and First-Order Stochastic Approximation](https://openreview.net/forum?id=CvYBvgEUK9) |  | 0 | In this work, we study first-order algorithms for solving Bilevel Optimization (BO) where the objective functions are smooth but possibly nonconvex in both levels and the variables are restricted to closed convex sets. As a first step, we study the landscape of BO through the lens of penalty methods, in which the upper- and lower-level objectives are combined in a weighted sum with penalty parameter $\sigma > 0$. In particular, we establish a strong connection between the penalty function and the hyper-objective by explicitly characterizing the conditions under which the values and derivatives of the two must be $O(\sigma)$-close. A by-product of our analysis is the explicit formula for the gradient of hyper-objective when the lower-level problem has multiple solutions under minimal conditions, which could be of independent interest. Next, viewing the penalty formulation as $O(\sigma)$-approximation of the original BO, we propose first-order algorithms that find an $\epsilon$-stationary solution by optimizing the penalty formulation with $\sigma = O(\epsilon)$. When the perturbed lower-level problem uniformly satisfies the {\it small-error} proximal error-bound (EB) condition, we propose a first-order algorithm that converges to an $\epsilon$-stationary point of the penalty function using in total $O(\epsilon^{-7})$ accesses to first-order stochastic gradient oracles. Under an additional assumption on stochastic oracles, we show that the algorithm can be implemented in a fully {\it single-loop} manner, {\it i.e.,} with $O(1)$ samples per iteration, and achieves the improved oracle-complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-5})$. | Jeongyeol Kwon, Dohyun Kwon, Stephen Wright, Robert D.

In this setting, we identify the first scaling law describing the relationship between weight sparsity, number of non-zero parameters, and amount of training data, which we validate empirically across model and data scales; on ViT/JFT-4B and T5/C4. These results allow us to characterize the "optimal sparsity", the sparsity level which yields the best performance for a given effective model size and training budget. For a fixed number of non-zero parameters, we identify that the optimal sparsity increases with the amount of data used for training. We also extend our study to different sparsity structures (such as the hardware-friendly n:m pattern) and strategies (such as starting from a pretrained dense model). Our findings shed light on the power and limitations of weight sparsity across various parameter and computational settings, offering both theoretical understanding and practical implications for leveraging sparsity towards computational efficiency improvements.

Recent results provide polynomial bounds on their convergence rate, assuming $L^2$-accurate scores. Until now, the tightest bounds were either superlinear in the data dimension or required strong smoothness assumptions. We provide the first convergence bounds which are linear in the data dimension (up to logarithmic factors) assuming only finite second moments of the data distribution. We show that diffusion models require at most $\tilde O(\frac{d \log^2(1/\delta)}{\varepsilon^2})$ steps to approximate an arbitrary distribution on $\mathbb{R}^d$ corrupted with Gaussian noise of variance $\delta$ to within $\varepsilon^2$ in KL divergence. Our proof extends the Girsanov-based methods of previous works. We introduce a refined treatment of the error from discretizing the reverse SDE inspired by stochastic localization. | Joe Benton, Valentin De Bortoli, Arnaud Doucet, George Deligiannidis |  |

In this paper, we propose a novel image editing method, DragonDiffusion, enabling Drag-style manipulation on Diffusion models. Specifically, we treat image editing as the change of feature correspondence in a pre-trained diffusion model. By leveraging feature correspondence, we develop energy functions that align with the editing target, transforming image editing operations into gradient guidance. Based on this guidance approach, we also construct multi-scale guidance that considers both semantic and geometric alignment. Furthermore, we incorporate a visual cross-attention strategy based on a memory bank design to ensure consistency between the edited result and original image. Benefiting from these efficient designs, all content editing and consistency operations come from the feature correspondence without extra model fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method has promising performance on various image editing tasks, including within a single image (e.g., object moving, resizing, and content dragging) or across images (e.g., appearance replacing and object pasting).

However, scalable representation for 3D objects and scenes is relatively unexplored. In this work, we present Uni3D, a 3D foundation model to explore the unified 3D representation at scale. Uni3D uses a 2D initialized ViT end-to-end pretrained to align the 3D point cloud features with the image-text aligned features. Via the simple architecture and pretext task, Uni3D can leverage abundant 2D pretrained models as initialization and image-text aligned models as the target, unlocking the great potential of 2D model zoos and scaling-up strategies to the 3D world. We efficiently scale up Uni3D to one billion parameters, and set new records on a broad range of 3D tasks, such as zero-shot classification, few-shot classification, open-world understanding and zero-shot part segmentation. We show that the strong Uni3D representation also enables applications such as 3D painting and retrieval in the wild. We believe that Uni3D provides a new direction for exploring both scaling up and efficiency of the representation in 3D domain. | Junsheng Zhou, Jinsheng Wang, Baorui Ma, YuShen Liu, Tiejun Huang, Xinlong Wang |  |

However, the predominant emphasis in most interactive environments is on learning, often at the expense of complexity in reasoning. In this paper, we introduce CivRealm, an environment inspired by the Civilization game. Civilization’s profound alignment with human society requires sophisticated learning and prior knowledge, while its ever-changing space and action space demand robust reasoning for generalization. Particularly, CivRealm sets up an imperfect-information general-sum game with a changing number of players; it presents a plethora of complex features, challenging the agent to deal with open-ended stochastic environments that require diplomacy and negotiation skills. Within CivRealm, we provide interfaces for two typical agent types: tensor-based agents that focus on learning, and language-based agents that emphasize reasoning. To catalyze further research, we present initial results for both paradigms. The canonical RL-based agents exhibit reasonable performance in mini-games, whereas both RL- and LLM-based agents struggle to make substantial progress in the full game. Overall, CivRealm stands as a unique learning and reasoning challenge for decision-making agents.

By addressing the limitations of existing Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks and proposing innovative evaluation methodologies, our research seeks to advance our understanding of these models’ capabilities. We propose a novel VQA benchmark based on well-known visual classification datasets which allows a granular evaluation of text-generative vision-language models and their comparison with discriminative vision-language models. To improve the assessment of coarse answers on fine-grained classification tasks, we suggest using the semantic hierarchy of the label space to ask automatically generated follow-up questions about the ground-truth category. Finally, we compare traditional NLP and LLM-based metrics for the problem of evaluating model predictions given ground-truth answers. We perform a human evaluation study upon which we base our decision on the final metric. We apply our benchmark to a suite of vision-language models and show a detailed comparison of their abilities on object, action, and attribute classification. Our contributions aim to lay the foundation for more precise and meaningful assessments, facilitating targeted progress in the exciting field of vision-language modeling. | Simon Ging, María Alejandra Bravo, Thomas Brox |  |
| 594 |  |  [GIM: Learning Generalizable Image Matcher From Internet Videos](https://openreview.net/forum?id=NYN1b8GRGS) |  | 0 | Image matching is a fundamental computer vision problem. While learning-based methods achieve state-of-the-art performance on existing benchmarks, they generalize poorly to in-the-wild images. Such methods typically need to train separate models for different scene types (e.g., indoor vs. outdoor) and are impractical when the scene type is unknown in advance. One of the underlying problems is the limited scalability of existing data construction pipelines, which limits the diversity of standard image matching datasets. To address this problem, we propose GIM, a self-training framework for learning a single generalizable model based on any image matching architecture using internet videos, an abundant and diverse data source. Given an architecture, GIM first trains it on standard domain-specific datasets and then combines it with complementary matching methods to create dense labels on nearby frames of novel videos. These labels are filtered by robust fitting, and then enhanced by propagating them to distant frames. The final model is trained on propagated data with strong augmentations. Not relying on complex 3D reconstruction makes GIM much more efficient and less likely to fail than standard SfM-and-MVS based frameworks. We also propose ZEB, the first zero-shot evaluation benchmark for image matching. By mixing data from diverse domains, ZEB can thoroughly assess the cross-domain generalization performance of different methods. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of GIM. Applying GIM consistently improves the zero-shot performance of 3 state-of-the-art image matching architectures as the number of downloaded videos increases (Fig. 1 (a)); with 50 hours of YouTube videos, the relative zero-shot performance improves by 6.9% − 18.1%. GIM also enables generalization to extreme cross-domain data such as Bird Eye View (BEV) images of projected 3D point clouds (Fig. 1 (c)). More importantly, our single zero-shot model consistently outperforms domain-specific baselines when evaluated on downstream tasks inherent to their respective domains. The code will be released upon acceptance. | Xuelun Shen, Zhipeng Cai, Wei Yin, Matthias Müller, Zijun Li, Kaixuan Wang, Xiaozhi Chen, Cheng Wang |  |

Using pretrained large-scale 2D diffusion models, recent work Zero123 demonstrates the ability to generate plausible novel views from a single-view image of an object. However, maintaining consistency in geometry and colors for the generated images remains a challenge. To address this issue, we propose a synchronized multiview diffusion model that models the joint probability distribution of multiview images, enabling the generation of multiview-consistent images in a single reverse process. SyncDreamer synchronizes the intermediate states of all the generated images at every step of the reverse process through a 3D-aware feature attention mechanism that correlates the corresponding features across different views. Experiments show that SyncDreamer generates images with high consistency across different views, thus making it well-suited for various 3D generation tasks such as novel-view-synthesis, text-to-3D, and image-to-3D.

However, the computational efficiency of these models jeopardizes their practicality. This paper proposes a novel system for improving the compression ratio while maintaining computational efficiency for learned lossless data compression. Our approach incorporates two essential innovations. First, we propose the Finite-State AutoRegressive (FSAR) entropy coder, an efficient autoregressive Markov model based entropy coder that utilizes a lookup table to expedite autoregressive entropy coding. Next, we present a Straight-Through Hardmax Quantization (STHQ) scheme to enhance the optimization of discrete latent space. Our experiments show that the proposed lossless compression method could improve the compression ratio by up to 6\% compared to the baseline, with negligible extra computational time. Our work provides valuable insights into enhancing the computational efficiency of learned lossless data compression, which can have practical applications in various fields.

The reason is that current instruction tuning largely focuses on basic language tasks but ignores the tool-use domain. This is in contrast to the excellent tool-use capabilities of state-of-the-art (SOTA) closed-source LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT. To bridge this gap, we introduce ToolLLM, a general tool-use framework encompassing data construction, model training, and evaluation. We first present ToolBench, an instruction-tuning dataset for tool use, which is constructed automatically using ChatGPT. Specifically, the construction can be divided into three stages: (i) API collection: we collect 16,464 real-world RESTful APIs spanning 49 categories from RapidAPI Hub; (ii) instruction generation: we prompt ChatGPT to generate diverse instructions involving these APIs, covering both single-tool and multi-tool scenarios; (iii) solution path annotation: we use ChatGPT to search for a valid solution path (chain of API calls) for each instruction. To enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we develop a novel depth-first search-based decision tree algorithm. It enables LLMs to evaluate multiple reasoning traces and expand the search space. Moreover, to evaluate the tool-use capabilities of LLMs, we develop an automatic evaluator: ToolEval. Based on ToolBench, we fine-tune LLaMA to obtain an LLM ToolLLaMA, and equip it with a neural API retriever to recommend appropriate APIs for each instruction. Experiments show that ToolLLaMA demonstrates a remarkable ability to execute complex instructions and generalize to unseen APIs, and exhibits comparable performance to ChatGPT. Our ToolLLaMA also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization ability in an out-of-distribution tool-use dataset: APIBench. | Yujia Qin, Shihao Liang, Yining Ye, Kunlun Zhu, Lan Yan, Yaxi Lu, Yankai Lin, Xin Cong, Xiangru Tang, Bill Qian, Sihan Zhao, Lauren Hong, Runchu Tian, Ruobing Xie, Jie Zhou, Mark Gerstein, Dahai Li, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun |  |

While existing FR algorithms primarily focus on optimizing margins and loss functions, limited attention has been given to exploring the feature representation space. Therefore, this paper endeavors to improve FR performance in the view of feature representation space. Firstly, we consider two FR models that exhibit distinct performance discrepancies, where one model exhibits superior recognition accuracy compared to the other. We implement orthogonal decomposition on the features from the superior model along those from the inferior model and obtain two sub-features. Surprisingly, we find the sub-feature perpendicular to the inferior still possesses a certain level of face distinguishability. We adjust the modulus of the sub-features and recombine them through vector addition. Experiments demonstrate this recombination is likely to contribute to an improved facial feature representation, even better than features from the original superior model. Motivated by this discovery, we further consider how to improve FR accuracy when there is only one FR model available. Inspired by knowledge distillation, we incorporate the intra-class incoherence constraint (IIC) to solve the problem. Experiments on various FR benchmarks show the existing state-of-the-art method with IIC can be further improved, highlighting its potential to further enhance FR performance. | Yuanqing Huang, Yinggui Wang, Le Yang, Lei Wang |  |

The primary challenge of TTA is limited access to the entire test dataset during online updates, causing error accumulation. To mitigate it, TTA methods have utilized the model output's entropy as a confidence metric that aims to determine which samples have a lower likelihood of causing error. Through experimental studies, however, we observed the unreliability of entropy as a confidence metric for TTA under biased scenarios and theoretically revealed that it stems from the neglect of the influence of latent disentangled factors of data on predictions. Building upon these findings, we introduce a novel TTA method named Destroy Your Object (DeYO), which leverages a newly proposed confidence metric named Pseudo-Label Probability Difference (PLPD). PLPD quantifies the influence of the shape of an object on prediction by measuring the difference between predictions before and after applying an object-destructive transformation. DeYO consists of sample selection and sample weighting, which employ entropy and PLPD concurrently. For robust adaptation, DeYO prioritizes samples that dominantly incorporate shape information when making predictions. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the consistent superiority of DeYO over baseline methods across various scenarios, including biased and wild.

The key idea is to use a complex and high-order degradation model to mimic real-world degradations. Although they have achieved impressive results in various scenarios, they are faced with the obstacle of evaluation. Currently, these methods are only assessed by their average performance on a small set of degradation cases randomly selected from a large space, which fails to provide a comprehensive understanding of their overall performance and often yields inconsistent and potentially misleading results. To overcome the limitation in evaluation, we propose SEAL, a framework for systematic evaluation of real-SR. In particular, we cluster the extensive degradation space to create a set of representative degradation cases, which serves as a comprehensive test set. Next, we propose a coarse-to-fine evaluation protocol to measure the distributed and relative performance of real-SR methods on the test set. The protocol incorporates two new metrics: acceptance rate (AR) and relative performance ratio (RPR), derived from acceptance and excellence lines. Under SEAL, we benchmark existing real-SR methods, obtain new observations and insights into their performance, and develop a new strong baseline. We consider SEAL as the first step towards creating an unbiased and comprehensive real-SR evaluation platform, which can promote the development of real-SR. | Wenlong Zhang, Xiaohui Li, Xiangyu Chen, Xiaoyun Zhang, Yu Qiao, XiaoMing Wu, Chao Dong |  |

To close this gap, inspired by the recent efforts of learning EBMs by maximimizing diffusion recovery likelihood (DRL), we propose cooperative diffusion recovery likelihood (CDRL), an effective approach to tractably learn and sample from a series of EBMs defined on increasingly noisy versons of a dataset, paired with an initializer model for each EBM. At each noise level, the two models are jointly estimated within a cooperative training framework: Samples from the initializer serve as starting points that are refined by a few MCMC sampling steps from the EBM. The EBM is then optimized by maximizing recovery likelihood, while the initializer model is optimized by learning from the difference between the refined samples and the initial samples. In addition, we made several practical designs for EBM training to further improve the sample quality. Combining these advances, we significantly boost the generation performance compared to existing EBM methods on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet 32x32. And we have shown that CDRL has great potential to largely reduce the sampling time. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our models for several downstream tasks, including classifier-free guided generation, compositional generation, image inpainting and out-of-distribution detection. | Yaxuan Zhu, Jianwen Xie, Ying Nian Wu, Ruiqi Gao |  |

It presents a unique hybrid of chain-of-thought (CoT) and program-of-thought (PoT) rationales, and also ensures extensive coverage of diverse fields in math. The hybrid of CoT and PoT not only unleashes the potential of tool use but also allows different thought processes for different math problems. As a result, the MAmmoTH series substantially outperform existing open-source models on nine mathematical reasoning datasets across all scales with an average accuracy gain between 16% and 32%. Remarkably, our MAmmoTH-7B model reaches 33% on MATH (a competition-level dataset), which exceeds the best open-source 7B model (WizardMath) by 23%, and the MAmmoTH-34B model achieves 44% accuracy on MATH, even surpassing GPT-4’s CoT result. Our work underscores the importance of diverse problem coverage and the use of hybrid rationales in developing superior math generalist models. | Xiang Yue, Xingwei Qu, Ge Zhang, Yao Fu, Wenhao Huang, Huan Sun, Yu Su, Wenhu Chen |  |

We propose a straightforward yet effective method for identifying data contamination within LLMs. At its core, our approach starts by identifying potential contamination at the instance level; using this information, our approach then assesses wider contamination at the partition level. To estimate contamination of individual instances, we employ "guided instruction:" a prompt consisting of the dataset name, partition type, and the random-length initial segment of a reference instance, asking the LLM to complete it. An instance is flagged as contaminated if the LLM's output either exactly or nearly matches the latter segment of the reference. To understand if an entire partition is contaminated, we propose two ideas. The first idea marks a dataset partition as contaminated if the average overlap score with the reference instances (as measured by ROUGE-L or BLEURT) is statistically significantly better with the completions from guided instruction compared to a "general instruction" that does not include the dataset and partition name. The second idea marks a dataset partition as contaminated if a classifier based on GPT-4 with few-shot in-context learning prompt marks multiple generated completions as exact/near-exact matches of the corresponding reference instances. Our best method achieves an accuracy between 92% and 100% in detecting if an LLM is contaminated with seven datasets, containing train and test/validation partitions, when contrasted with manual evaluation by human experts. Further, our findings indicate that GPT-4 is contaminated with AG News, WNLI, and XSum datasets. | Shahriar Golchin, Mihai Surdeanu |  |
| 604 |  |  [Variational Inference for SDEs Driven by Fractional Noise](https://openreview.net/forum?id=rtx8B94JMS) |  | 0 | We present a novel variational framework for performing inference in (neural) stochastic differential equations (SDEs) driven by Markov-approximate fractional Brownian motion (fBM). SDEs offer a versatile tool for modeling real-world continuous-time dynamic systems with inherent noise and randomness. Combining SDEs with the powerful inference capabilities of variational methods, enables the learning of representative distributions through stochastic gradient descent. However, conventional SDEs typically assume the underlying noise to follow a Brownian motion (BM), which hinders their ability to capture long-term dependencies. In contrast, fractional Brownian motion (fBM) extends BM to encompass non-Markovian dynamics, but existing methods for inferring fBM parameters are either computationally demanding or statistically inefficient. In this paper, building upon the Markov approximation of fBM, we derive the evidence lower bound essential for efficient variational inference of posterior path measures, drawing from the well-established field of stochastic analysis. Additionally, we provide a closed-form expression for optimal approximation coefficients and propose to use neural networks to learn the drift, diffusion and control terms within our variational posterior, leading to the variational training of neural-SDEs. In this framework, we also optimize the Hurst index, governing the nature of our fractional noise. Beyond validation on synthetic data, we contribute a novel architecture for variational latent video prediction,—an approach that, to the best of our knowledge, enables the first variational neural-SDE application to video perception. | Rembert Daems, Manfred Opper, Guillaume Crevecoeur, Tolga Birdal |  |
| 605 |  |  [Implicit regularization of deep residual networks towards neural ODEs](https://openreview.net/forum?id=AbXGwqb5Ht) |  | 0 | Residual neural networks are state-of-the-art deep learning models. Their continuous-depth analog, neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs), are also widely used. Despite their success, the link between the discrete and continuous models still lacks a solid mathematical foundation. In this article, we take a step in this direction by establishing an implicit regularization of deep residual networks towards neural ODEs, for nonlinear networks trained with gradient flow. We prove that if the network is initialized as a discretization of a neural ODE, then such a discretization holds throughout training. Our results are valid for a finite training time, and also as the training time tends to infinity provided that the network satisfies a Polyak-Łojasiewicz condition. Importantly, this condition holds for a family of residual networks where the residuals are two-layer perceptrons with an overparameterization in width that is only linear, and implies the convergence of gradient flow to a global minimum. Numerical experiments illustrate our results. | Pierre Marion, YuHan Wu, Michael Eli Sander, Gérard Biau |  |

More specifically, do the graph structure and the node features carry enough usable information for the task? Our goals are (1) to develop a fast tool to measure how much information is in the graph structure and in the node features, and (2) to exploit the information to solve the task, if there is enough. We propose NetInfoF, a framework including NetInfoF_Probe and NetInfoF_Act, for the measurement and the exploitation of network usable information (NUI), respectively. Given a graph data, NetInfoF_Probe measures NUI without any model training, and NetInfoF_Act solves link prediction and node classification, while two modules share the same backbone. In summary, NetInfoF has following notable advantages: (a) General, handling both link prediction and node classification; (b) Principled, with theoretical guarantee and closed-form solution; (c) Effective, thanks to the proposed adjustment to node similarity; (d) Scalable, scaling linearly with the input size. In our carefully designed synthetic datasets, NetInfoF correctly identifies the ground truth of NUI and is the only method being robust to all graph scenarios. Applied on real-world datasets, NetInfoF wins in 11 out of 12 times on link prediction compared to general GNN baselines. | MengChieh Lee, Haiyang Yu, Jian Zhang, Vassilis N.

PET has gained popularity, especially in the context of large-scale models, due to its ability to reduce transfer learning costs and conserve hardware resources. However, existing PET approaches primarily focus on recognition tasks and typically support uni-modal optimization, while neglecting dense prediction tasks and vision language interactions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel PET framework called \*\*B\*\*i-direction\*\*a\*\*l Inte\*\*r\*\*twined Vision \*\*L\*\*anguage Effici\*\*e\*\*nt Tuning for \*\*R\*\*eferring \*\*I\*\*mage Segment\*\*a\*\*tion (\*\*BarLeRIa\*\*), which leverages bi-directional intertwined vision language adapters to fully exploit the frozen pre-trained models' potential in cross-modal dense prediction tasks. In BarLeRIa, two different tuning modules are employed for efficient attention, one for global, and the other for local, along with an intertwined vision language tuning module for efficient modal fusion. Extensive experiments conducted on RIS benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of BarLeRIa over prior PET methods with a significant margin, i.e., achieving an average improvement of 5.6\%. Remarkably, without requiring additional training datasets, BarLeRIa even surpasses SOTA full fine-tuning approaches.

GFlowNets exhibit a remarkable ability to generate diverse samples, yet occasionally struggle to consistently produce samples with high rewards due to over-exploration on wide sample space. This paper proposes to train GFlowNets with local search, which focuses on exploiting high-rewarded sample space to resolve this issue. Our main idea is to explore the local neighborhood via backtracking and reconstruction guided by backward and forward policies, respectively. This allows biasing the samples toward high-reward solutions, which is not possible for a typical GFlowNet solution generation scheme, which uses the forward policy to generate the solution from scratch. Extensive experiments demonstrate a remarkable performance improvement in several biochemical tasks.

| 609 |  |  [Enabling Efficient Equivariant Operations in the Fourier Basis via Gaunt Tensor Products](https://openreview.net/forum?id=mhyQXJ6JsK) |  | 0 | Developing equivariant neural networks for the E(3) group plays an important role in modeling 3D data across real-world applications. Enforcing this equivariance primarily involves the tensor products of irreducible representations (irreps). However, the computational complexity of such operations increases significantly as higher-order tensors are used. In this work, we propose a systematic approach to substantially accelerate the computation of the tensor products of irreps. We mathematically connect the commonly used Clebsch-Gordan coefficients to the Gaunt coefficients, which are integrals of products of three spherical harmonics. Through Gaunt coefficients, the tensor product of irreps becomes equivalent to the multiplication between spherical functions represented by spherical harmonics. This perspective further allows us to change the basis for the equivariant operations from spherical harmonics to a 2D Fourier basis. Consequently, the multiplication between spherical functions represented by a 2D Fourier basis can be efficiently computed via the convolution theorem and Fast Fourier Transforms. This transformation reduces the complexity of full tensor products of irreps from $\mathcal{O}(L^6)$ to $\mathcal{O}(L^3)$, where $L$ is the max degree of irreps. Leveraging this approach, we introduce the Gaunt Tensor Product, which serves as a new method to construct efficient equivariant operations across different model architectures. Our experiments on the Open Catalyst Project and 3BPA datasets demonstrate both the increased efficiency and improved performance of our approach. The code and models will be made publicly available at https://github.com/lsj2408/Gaunt-Tensor-Product. | Shengjie Luo, Tianlang Chen, Aditi S. Krishnapriyan |  |

At the first glance, it is unrelated to perceptual image compression. However, we find that theoretically: 1) Conditional generative model-based perceptual codec satisfies idempotence; 2) Unconditional generative model with idempotence constraint is equivalent to conditional generative codec. Based on this newfound equivalence, we propose a new paradigm of perceptual image codec by inverting unconditional generative model with idempotence constraints. Our codec is theoretically equivalent to conditional generative codec, and it does not require training new models. Instead, it only requires a pre-trained mean-square-error codec and unconditional generative model. Empirically, we show that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as HiFiC and ILLM, in terms of Fréchet Inception Distance (FID).

However, VI can encounter challenges in achieving a high marginal log-likelihood when dealing with complicated posterior distributions. In response to this limitation, we introduce a novel variational importance sampling (VIS) approach that directly estimates and maximizes the marginal log-likelihood. VIS leverages the optimal proposal distribution, achieved by minimizing the forward $\chi^2$ divergence, to enhance marginal log-likelihood estimation. We apply VIS to various popular latent variable models, including mixture models, variational auto-encoders, and partially observable generalized linear models. Results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, in terms of both log-likelihood and model parameter estimation.

Mallinar et. al. (2022) noted that neural networks seem to often exhibit \`\`tempered overfitting'', wherein the population risk does not converge to the Bayes optimal error, but neither does it approach infinity, yielding non-trivial generalization. However, this has not been studied rigorously. We provide the first rigorous analysis of the overfiting behaviour of regression with minimum norm ($\ell_2$ of weights), focusing on univariate two-layer ReLU networks. We show overfitting is tempered (with high probability) when measured with respect to the $L_1$ loss, but also show that the situation is more complex than suggested by Mallinar et. al., and overfitting is catastrophic with respect to the $L_2$ loss, or when taking an expectation over the training set. | Nirmit Joshi, Gal Vardi, Nathan Srebro |  |

Widely used initialization methods are proposed and evaluated for networks that are trained from scratch. However, the growing number of pretrained models now offers new opportunities for tackling this classical problem of weight initialization. In this work, we introduce weight selection, a method for initializing smaller models by selecting a subset of weights from a pretrained larger model. This enables the transfer of knowledge from pretrained weights to smaller models. Our experiments demonstrate that weight selection can significantly enhance the performance of small models and reduce their training time. Notably, it can also be used together with knowledge distillation. Weight selection offers a new approach to leverage the power of pretrained models in resource-constrained settings, and we hope it can be a useful tool for training small models in the large-model era. | Zhiqiu Xu, Yanjie Chen, Kirill Vishniakov, Yida Yin, Zhiqiang Shen, Trevor Darrell, Lingjie Liu, Zhuang Liu |  |

Our reconstruction model incorporates a triplane NeRF representation and, functioning as a denoiser, can denoise noisy multi-view images via 3D NeRF reconstruction and rendering, achieving single-stage 3D generation in the 2D diffusion denoising process. We train DMV3D on large-scale multi-view image datasets of extremely diverse objects using only image reconstruction losses, without accessing 3D assets. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results for the single-image reconstruction problem where probabilistic modeling of unseen object parts is required for generating diverse reconstructions with sharp textures.

While they have been intensively studied in classification, backdoor attacks on semantic segmentation have been largely overlooked. Unlike classification, semantic segmentation aims to classify every pixel within a given image. In this work, we explore backdoor attacks on segmentation models to misclassify all pixels of a victim class by injecting a specific trigger on non-victim pixels during inferences, which is dubbed Influencer Backdoor Attack (IBA). IBA is expected to maintain the classification accuracy of non-victim pixels and mislead classifications of all victim pixels in every single inference and could be easily applied to real-world scenes. Based on the context aggregation ability of segmentation models, we proposed a simple, yet effective, Nearest-Neighbor trigger injection strategy. We also introduce an innovative Pixel Random Labeling strategy which maintains optimal performance even when the trigger is placed far from the victim pixels. Our extensive experiments reveal that current segmentation models do suffer from backdoor attacks, demonstrate IBA real-world applicability, and show that our proposed techniques can further increase attack performance. | Haoheng Lan, Jindong Gu, Philip Torr, Hengshuang Zhao |  |

PF-LRM is a highly scalable method utilizing self-attention blocks to exchange information between 3D object tokens and 2D image tokens; we predict a coarse point cloud for each view, and then use a differentiable Perspective-n-Point (PnP) solver to obtain camera poses. When trained on a huge amount of multi-view posed data of ~1M objects, PF-LRM shows strong cross-dataset generalization ability, and outperforms baseline methods by a large margin in terms of pose prediction accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality on various unseen evaluation datasets. We also demonstrate our model's applicability in downstream text/image-to-3D task with fast feed-forward inference.

Inspired by John Rawls's advocacy for _pure procedural justice_ (Rawls, 1971; 2001), we view automated decision-making as a microcosm of social institutions, and consider how the data generating process itself can satisfy the requirements of procedural fairness. We propose a framework that decouples the objectionable data generating components from the neutral ones by utilizing reference points and the associated value instantiation rule. Our findings highlight the necessity of preventing _disguised procedural unfairness_, drawing attention not only to the objectionable data generating components that we aim to mitigate, but also more importantly, to the neutral components that we intend to keep unaffected. | Zeyu Tang, Jialu Wang, Yang Liu, Peter Spirtes, Kun Zhang |  |

We seek a straightforward way of making use of existing vision-language models (VLMs) with simple fine-tuning on robotics data. To this end, we derive a simple and novel vision-language manipulation framework, dubbed RoboFlamingo, built upon the open-source VLMs, OpenFlamingo. Unlike prior works, RoboFlamingo utilizes pre-trained VLMs for single-step vision-language comprehension, models sequential history information with an explicit policy head, and is slightly fine-tuned by imitation learning only on language-conditioned manipulation datasets. Such a decomposition provides RoboFlamingo the flexibility for open-loop control and deployment on low-performance platforms. By exceeding the state-of-the-art performance with a large margin on the tested benchmark, we show RoboFlamingo can be an effective and competitive alternative to adapt VLMs to robot control. Our extensive experimental results also reveal several interesting conclusions regarding the behavior of different pre-trained VLMs on manipulation tasks. We believe RoboFlamingo has the potential to be a cost-effective and easy-to-use solution for robotics manipulation, empowering everyone with the ability to fine-tune their own robotics policy. Our code will be made public upon acceptance. | Xinghang Li, Minghuan Liu, Hanbo Zhang, Cunjun Yu, Jie Xu, Hongtao Wu, Chilam Cheang, Ya Jing, Weinan Zhang, Huaping Liu, Hang Li, Tao Kong |  |

Nevertheless, there is still an inadequacy in assessing the abilities of MLLMs on \*\*low-level visual perception and understanding\*\*. To address this gap, we present \*\*Q-Bench\*\*, a holistic benchmark crafted to systematically evaluate potential abilities of MLLMs on three realms: low-level visual perception, low-level visual description, and overall visual quality assessment. \*\*_a)_\*\* To evaluate the low-level \*\*_perception_\*\* ability, we construct the \*\*LLVisionQA\*\* dataset, consisting of 2,990 diverse-sourced images, each equipped with a human-asked question focusing on its low-level attributes.

Our evaluation across the three abilities confirms that MLLMs possess preliminary low-level visual skills. However, these skills are still unstable and relatively imprecise, indicating the need for specific enhancements on MLLMs towards these abilities. We hope that our benchmark can encourage the research community to delve deeper to discover and enhance these untapped potentials of MLLMs. | Haoning Wu, Zicheng Zhang, Erli Zhang, Chaofeng Chen, Liang Liao, Annan Wang, Chunyi Li, Wenxiu Sun, Qiong Yan, Guangtao Zhai, Weisi Lin |  |

These forecasters leverage Transformers to model the global dependencies over temporal tokens of time series, with each token formed by multiple variates of the same timestamp. However, Transformers are challenged in forecasting series with larger lookback windows due to performance degradation and computation explosion. Besides, the embedding for each temporal token fuses multiple variates that represent potential delayed events and distinct physical measurements, which may fail in learning variate-centric representations and result in meaningless attention maps. In this work, we reflect on the competent duties of Transformer components and repurpose the Transformer architecture without any modification to the basic components. We propose iTransformer that simply applies the attention and feed-forward network on the inverted dimensions. Specifically, the time points of individual series are embedded into variate tokens which are utilized by the attention mechanism to capture multivariate correlations; meanwhile, the feed-forward network is applied for each variate token to learn nonlinear representations. The iTransformer model achieves state-of-the-art on challenging real-world datasets, which further empowers the Transformer family with promoted performance, generalization ability across different variates, and better utilization of arbitrary lookback windows, making it a nice alternative as the fundamental backbone of time series forecasting.

These methods typically depend on protein structure encoders to model residue backbone frames, where atoms do not exist. Most prior encoders rely on atom-wise features, such as angles and distances between atoms, which are not available in this context. Only a few basic encoders, like IPA, have been proposed for this scenario, exposing the frame modeling as a bottleneck. In this work, we introduce the Vector Field Network (VFN), that enables network layers to perform learnable vector computations between coordinates of frame-anchored virtual atoms, thus achieving a higher capability for modeling frames. The vector computation operates in a manner similar to a linear layer, with each input channel receiving 3D virtual atom coordinates instead of scalar values. The multiple feature vectors output by the vector computation are then used to update the residue representations and virtual atom coordinates via attention aggregation. Remarkably, VFN also excels in modeling both frames and atoms, as the real atoms can be treated as the virtual atoms for modeling, positioning VFN as a potential $\textit{universal encoder}$. In protein diffusion (frame modeling), VFN exhibits a impressive performance advantage over IPA, excelling in terms of both designability ($\textbf{67.04}$\% vs. 53.58\%) and diversity ($\textbf{66.54}$\% vs. 51.98\%). In inverse folding(frame and atom modeling), VFN outperforms the previous SoTA model, PiFold ($\textbf{54.7}$\% vs. 51.66\%), on sequence recovery rate; we also propose a method of equipping VFN with the ESM model, which significantly surpasses the previous ESM-based SoTA ($\textbf{62.67}$\% vs. 55.65\%), LM-Design, by a substantial margin.

Its forgetting is therefore reduced as this instance-wise query mechanism enables us to select and update only relevant prompts. In this paper, we further integrate prompt-tuning with gradient projection approach. Our observation is: prompt-tuning releases the necessity of task identifier for gradient projection method; and gradient projection provides theoretical guarantees against forgetting for prompt-tuning. This inspires a new prompt gradient projection approach (PGP) for continual learning. In PGP, we deduce that reaching the orthogonal condition for prompt gradient can effectively prevent forgetting via the self-attention mechanism in vision-transformer. The condition equations are then realized by conducting Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on an element-wise sum space between input space and prompt space. We validate our method on diverse datasets and experiments demonstrate the efficiency of reducing forgetting both in class incremental, online class incremental, and task incremental settings.

Guided by the subjective logic theory, EDL obtains Dirichlet concentration parameters from deep neural networks, thus constructing a Dirichlet probability density function (PDF) to model the distribution of class probabilities. Despite its great success, we argue that EDL keeps nonessential settings in both stages of model construction and optimization. In this work, our analysis indicates that (1) in the construction of the Dirichlet PDF, a commonly ignored parameter termed prior weight governs the balance between leveraging the proportion of evidence and its magnitude in deriving predictive scores, and (2) in model optimization, a variance-minimized regularization term adopted by traditional EDL encourages the Dirichlet PDF to approach a Dirac delta function, potentially exacerbating overconfidence. Therefore, we propose the R-EDL (Relaxed-EDL) method by relaxing these nonessential settings. Specifically, R-EDL treats the prior weight as an adjustable hyper-parameter instead of a fixed scalar, and directly optimizes the expectation of the Dirichlet PDF provided to deprecate the variance-minimized regularization term. Extensive experiments and SOTA performances demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Source codes are provided in Appendix E. | Mengyuan Chen, Junyu Gao, Changsheng Xu |  |

In this paper, we study the OOD problem from a neuron activation view. We first formulate neuron activation states by considering both the neuron output and its influence on model decisions. Then, to characterize the relationship between neurons and OOD issues, we introduce the \*neuron activation coverage\* (NAC) -- a simple measure for neuron behaviors under InD data. Leveraging our NAC, we show that 1) InD and OOD inputs can be largely separated based on the neuron behavior, which significantly eases the OOD detection problem and beats the 21 previous methods over three benchmarks (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K). 2) a positive correlation between NAC and model generalization ability consistently holds across architectures and datasets, which enables a NAC-based criterion for evaluating model robustness. Compared to prevalent InD validation criteria, we show that NAC not only can select more robust models, but also has a stronger correlation with OOD test performance. | Yibing Liu, Chris Xing Tian, Haoliang Li, Lei Ma, Shiqi Wang |  |

However, despite the power and simplicity of representing signals with an MLP, these methods still face challenges when modeling large and complex temporal signals due to the limited capacity of MLPs. In this paper, we propose an effective approach to address this limitation by incorporating temporal residual layers into neural fields, dubbed ResFields. It is a novel class of networks specifically designed to effectively represent complex temporal signals. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the properties of ResFields and propose a matrix factorization technique to reduce the number of trainable parameters and enhance generalization capabilities. Importantly, our formulation seamlessly integrates with existing MLP-based neural fields and consistently improves results across various challenging tasks: 2D video approximation, dynamic shape modeling via temporal SDFs, and dynamic NeRF reconstruction. Lastly, we demonstrate the practical utility of ResFields by showcasing its effectiveness in capturing dynamic 3D scenes from sparse RGBD cameras of a lightweight capture system. | Marko Mihajlovic, Sergey Prokudin, Marc Pollefeys, Siyu Tang |  |

However, communication compression brings forth new challenges in FL due to the interplay of compression-incurred information distortion and inherent characteristics of FL such as partial participation and data heterogeneity. Despite the recent development, the existing approaches either cannot accommodate arbitrary data heterogeneity or partial participation, or require stringent conditions on compression. In this paper, we revisit the seminal stochastic controlled averaging method by proposing an equivalent but more efficient/simplified formulation with halved uplink communication costs, building upon which we propose two compressed FL algorithms, SCALLION and SCAFCOM, to support unbiased and biased compression, respectively. Both the proposed methods outperform the existing compressed FL methods in terms of communication and computation complexities. Moreover,SCALLION and SCAFCOM attain fast convergence rates under arbitrary data heterogeneity without any additional assumptions on compression errors. Experiments show that \scallion and \scafcom outperform recent compressed FL methods under the same communication budget. | Xinmeng Huang, Ping Li, Xiaoyun Li |  |

However, adding motion dynamics to existing high-quality personalized T2Is and enabling them to generate animations remains an open challenge. In this paper, we present AnimateDiff, a practical framework for animating personalized T2I models without requiring model-specific tuning. At the core of our framework is a plug-and-play motion module that can be trained once and seamlessly integrated into any personalized T2Is originating from the same base T2I. Through our proposed training strategy, the motion module effectively learns transferable motion priors from real-world videos. Once trained, the motion module can be inserted into a personalized T2I model to form a personalized animation generator. We further propose MotionLoRA, a lightweight fine-tuning technique for AnimateDiff that enables a pre-trained motion module to adapt to new motion patterns, such as different shot types, at a low training and data collection cost. We evaluate AnimateDiff and MotionLoRA on several public representative personalized T2I models collected from the community. The results demonstrate that our approaches help these models generate temporally smooth animation clips while preserving the visual quality and motion diversity.

However, human instructions are sometimes too brief for current methods to capture and follow. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promising capabilities in cross-modal understanding and visual-aware response generation via LMs. We investigate how MLLMs facilitate edit instructions and present MLLM-Guided Image Editing (MGIE). MGIE learns to derive expressive instructions and provides explicit guidance. The editing model jointly captures this visual imagination and performs manipulation through end-to-end training. We evaluate various aspects of Photoshop-style modification, global photo optimization, and local editing. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that expressive instructions are crucial to instruction-based image editing, and our MGIE can lead to a notable improvement in automatic metrics and human evaluation while maintaining competitive inference efficiency. | TsuJui Fu, Wenze Hu, Xianzhi Du, William Yang Wang, Yinfei Yang, Zhe Gan |  |
| 631 |  |  [Tuning LayerNorm in Attention: Towards Efficient Multi-Modal LLM Finetuning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=YR3ETaElNK) |  | 0 | This paper introduces an efficient strategy to transform Large Language Models (LLMs) into Multi-Modal Large Language Models. By conceptualizing this transformation as a domain adaptation process, \ie, transitioning from text understanding to embracing multiple modalities, we intriguingly note that, within each attention block, tuning LayerNorm suffices to yield strong performance. Moreover, when benchmarked against other tuning approaches like full parameter finetuning or LoRA, its benefits on efficiency are substantial. For example, when compared to LoRA on a 13B model scale, performance can be enhanced by an average of over 20\% across five multi-modal tasks, and meanwhile, results in a significant reduction of trainable parameters by 41.9\% and a decrease in GPU memory usage by 17.6\%. On top of this LayerNorm strategy, we showcase that selectively tuning only with conversational data can improve efficiency further. Beyond these empirical outcomes, we provide a comprehensive analysis to explore the role of LayerNorm in adapting LLMs to the multi-modal domain and improving the expressive power of the model. | Bingchen Zhao, Haoqin Tu, Chen Wei, Jieru Mei, Cihang Xie |  |

Due to the high dimensionality of humanoids and the inherent difficulties in reinforcement learning, prior methods have focused on learning skill embeddings for a narrow range of movement styles (e.g. locomotion, game characters) from specialized motion datasets. This limited scope hampers their applicability in complex tasks. We close this gap by significantly increasing the coverage of our motion representation space. To achieve this, we first learn a motion imitator that can imitate all of human motion from a large, unstructured motion dataset. We then create our motion representation by distilling skills directly from the imitator. This is achieved by using an encoder-decoder structure with a variational information bottleneck. Additionally, we jointly learn a prior conditioned on proprioception (humanoid's own pose and velocities) to improve model expressiveness and sampling efficiency for downstream tasks. By sampling from the prior, we can generate long, stable, and diverse human motions. Using this latent space for hierarchical RL, we show that our policies solve tasks using human-like behavior. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our motion representation by solving generative tasks (e.g. strike, terrain traversal) and motion tracking using VR controllers. | Zhengyi Luo, Jinkun Cao, Josh Merel, Alexander Winkler, Jing Huang, Kris M.

Specifically, neural plasticity should be critical in the context of constantly changing reinforcement learning (RL) environments, yet current approaches still primarily employ static activation functions. In this work, we motivate the use of adaptable activation functions in RL and show that rational activation functions are particularly suitable for augmenting plasticity. Inspired by residual networks, we derive a condition under which rational units are closed under residual connections and formulate a naturally regularised version. The proposed joint-rational activation allows for desirable degrees of flexibility, yet regularises plasticity to an extent that avoids overfitting by leveraging a mutual set of activation function parameters across layers. We demonstrate that equipping popular algorithms with (joint) rational activations leads to consistent improvements on different games from the Atari Learning Environment benchmark, notably making DQN competitive to DDQN and Rainbow. | Quentin Delfosse, Patrick Schramowski, Martin Mundt, Alejandro Molina, Kristian Kersting |  |

Often in real-world scenarios, a number of observations would be added into or removed from the existing training dataset, necessitating the development of learning systems that can efficiently train optimal models with varying observations in an online (sequential) manner instead of retraining from scratch. Despite the significance of data-varying scenarios, most existing approaches to sparse GLMs concentrate on offline batch updates, leaving online solutions largely underexplored. In this work, we present the first algorithm without compromising accuracy for GLMs regularized by sparsity-enforcing penalties trained on varying observations. Our methodology is capable of handling the addition and deletion of observations simultaneously, while adaptively updating data-dependent regularization parameters to ensure the best statistical performance. Specifically, we recast sparse GLMs as a bilevel optimization objective upon varying observations and characterize it as an explicit gradient flow in the underlying space for the inner and outer subproblems we are optimizing over, respectively. We further derive a set of rules to ensure a proper transition at regions of non-smoothness, and establish the guarantees of theoretical consistency and finite convergence. Encouraging results are exhibited on real-world benchmarks. | Diyang Li, Charles Ling, Zhiqiang Xu, Huan Xiong, Bin Gu |  |

To help researchers study this problem, we present a dataset of over 563,000 prompt injection attacks and 118,000 prompt-based "defenses" against prompt injection, all created by players of an online game called Tensor Trust. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset that includes both human-generated attacks and defenses for instruction-following LLMs. The attacks in our dataset have easily interpretable structure, and shed light on the weaknesses of LLMs. We also use the dataset to create a benchmark for resistance to two types of prompt injection, which we refer to as \*prompt extraction\* and \*prompt hijacking\*. Our benchmark results show that many models are vulnerable to the attack strategies in the Tensor Trust dataset. Furthermore, we show that some attack strategies from the dataset generalize to deployed LLM-based applications, even though they have a very different set of constraints to the game.

However, automatically collecting such data (e.g. via large-scale web scraping) leads to low quality and poor image-text correlation, while human annotation is more accurate but requires significant manual effort and expense. We introduce $\textbf{ITIT}$ ($\textbf{I}$n$\textbf{T}$egrating $\textbf{I}$mage $\textbf{T}$ext): an innovative training paradigm grounded in the concept of cycle consistency which allows vision-language training on $\textit{unpaired}$ image and text data. ITIT is comprised of a joint image-text encoder with disjoint image and text decoders that enable bidirectional image-to-text and text-to-image generation in a single framework. During training, ITIT leverages a small set of paired image-text data to ensure its output matches the input reasonably well in both directions. Simultaneously, the model is also trained on much larger datasets containing only images or texts. This is achieved by enforcing cycle consistency between the original unpaired samples and the cycle-generated counterparts. For instance, it generates a caption for a given input image and then uses the caption to create an output image, and enforces similarity between the input and output images. Our experiments show that ITIT with unpaired datasets exhibits similar scaling behavior as using high-quality paired data. We demonstrate image generation and captioning performance on par with state-of-the-art text-to-image and image-to-text models with orders of magnitude fewer (only 3M) paired image-text data.

As training proceeds, the model learns a list $\mathcal D$ of integers, products of divisors of the base used to represent integers and small primes, and predicts the largest element of $\mathcal D$ that divides both inputs. Training distributions impact performance. Models trained from uniform operands only learn a handful of GCD (up to $38$ GCD $\leq100$). Log-uniform operands boost performance to $73$ GCD $\leq 100$, and a log-uniform distribution of outcomes (i.e. GCD) to $91$. However, training from uniform (balanced) GCD breaks explainability. | François Charton |  |

Data-driven methods based on large-scale machine learning promise high adaptivity by integrating long-range dependencies more directly and efficiently. In this work, we focus on computational fluid dynamics and address the shortcomings of a large part of the literature, which are based on fixed support for computations and predictions in the form of regular or irregular grids. We propose a novel setup to perform predictions in a continuous spatial and temporal domain while being trained on sparse observations. We formulate the task as a double observation problem and propose a solution with two interlinked dynamical systems defined on, respectively, the sparse positions and the continuous domain, which allows to forecast and interpolate a solution from the initial condition. Our practical implementation involves recurrent GNNs and a spatio-temporal attention observer capable of interpolating the solution at arbitrary locations. Our model not only generalizes to new initial conditions (as standard auto-regressive models do) but also performs evaluation at arbitrary space and time locations. We evaluate on three standard datasets in fluid dynamics and compare to strong baselines, which are outperformed in classical settings and the extended new task requiring continuous predictions. | Steeven Janny, Madiha Nadri, Julie Digne, Christian Wolf |  |

We propose to follow reference videos as instructions, which offer expressive goal specifications while eliminating the need for expensive text-gameplay annotations. A new learning framework is derived to allow learning such instruction-following controllers from gameplay videos while producing a video instruction encoder that induces a structured goal space. We implement our agent GROOT in a simple yet effective encoder-decoder architecture based on causal transformers. We evaluate GROOT against open-world counterparts and human players on a proposed Minecraft SkillForge benchmark. The Elo ratings clearly show that GROOT is closing the human-machine gap as well as exhibiting a 70% winning rate over the best generalist agent baseline. Qualitative analysis of the induced goal space further demonstrates some interesting emergent properties, including the goal composition and complex gameplay behavior synthesis. | Shaofei Cai, Bowei Zhang, Zihao Wang, Xiaojian Ma, Anji Liu, Yitao Liang |  |

To address this problem, existing generalizable NeRF methods simply condition the model on image features. These methods still struggle to learn precise global representations over diverse scenes since they lack an effective mechanism for interacting among different points and views. In this work, we unveil that 3D implicit representation learning can be significantly improved by mask-based modeling. Specifically, we propose \*\*m\*\*asked \*\*r\*\*ay and \*\*v\*\*iew \*\*m\*\*odeling for generalizable \*\*NeRF\*\* (\*\*MRVM-NeRF\*\*), which is a self-supervised pretraining target to predict complete scene representations from partially masked features along each ray. With this pretraining target, MRVM-NeRF enables better use of correlations across different rays and views as the geometry priors, which thereby strengthens the capability of capturing intricate details within the scenes and boosts the generalization capability across different scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed MRVM-NeRF on both synthetic and real-world datasets, qualitatively and quantitatively. Besides, we also conduct experiments to show the compatibility of our proposed method with various backbones and its superiority under few-shot cases. | Ganlin Yang, Guoqiang Wei, Zhizheng Zhang, Yan Lu, Dong Liu |  |
| 641 |  |  [Large Language Models Are Not Robust Multiple Choice Selectors](https://openreview.net/forum?id=shr9PXz7T0) |  | 0 | Multiple choice questions (MCQs) serve as a common yet important task format in the evaluation of large language models (LLMs). This work shows that modern LLMs are vulnerable to option position changes in MCQs due to their inherent “selection bias”, namely, they prefer to select specific option IDs as answers (like “Option A”). Through extensive empirical analyses with 20 LLMs on three benchmarks, we pinpoint that this behavioral bias primarily stems from LLMs’ token bias, where the model a priori assigns more probabilistic mass to specific option ID tokens (e.g., A/B/C/D) when predicting answers from the option IDs. To mitigate selection bias, we propose a label-free, inference-time debiasing method, called PriDe, which separates the model’s prior bias for option IDs from the overall prediction distribution. PriDe first estimates the prior by permutating option contents on a small number of test samples, and then applies the estimated prior to debias the remaining samples. We demonstrate that it achieves interpretable and transferable debiasing with high computational efficiency. We hope this work can draw broader research attention to the bias and robustness of modern LLMs. | Chujie Zheng, Hao Zhou, Fandong Meng, Jie Zhou, Minlie Huang |  |

To this end, Robust Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (RARL) trains a protagonist against destabilizing forces exercised by an adversary in a competitive zero-sum Markov game, whose optimal solution, i.e., rational strategy, corresponds to a Nash equilibrium. However, finding Nash equilibria requires facing complex saddle point optimization problems, which can be prohibitive to solve, especially for high-dimensional control. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for adversarial RL based on entropy regularization to ease the complexity of the saddle point optimization problem. We show that the solution of this entropy-regularized problem corresponds to a Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE), a generalization of Nash equilibria that accounts for bounded rationality, i.e., agents sometimes play random actions instead of optimal ones. Crucially, the connection between the entropy-regularized objective and QRE enables free modulation of the rationality of the agents by simply tuning the temperature coefficient. We leverage this insight to propose our novel algorithm, Quantal Adversarial RL (QARL), which gradually increases the rationality of the adversary in a curriculum fashion until it is fully rational, easing the complexity of the optimization problem while retaining robustness. We provide extensive evidence of QARL outperforming RARL and recent baselines across several MuJoCo locomotion and navigation problems in overall performance and robustness. | Aryaman Reddi, Maximilian Tölle, Jan Peters, Georgia Chalvatzaki, Carlo D'Eramo |  |

This is achieved by training the VPGs on millions of image-caption pairs, where the VPG-generated tokens of images are fed into a frozen LLM to generate the corresponding captions. However, this image-captioning based training objective inherently biases the VPG to concentrate solely on the primary visual contents sufficient for caption generation, often neglecting other visual details. This shortcoming results in MLLMs’ underperformance in comprehending demonstrative instructions consisting of multiple, interleaved, and multimodal instructions that demonstrate the required context to complete a task. To address this issue, we introduce a generic and lightweight Visual Prompt Generator Complete module (VPG-C), which can infer and complete the missing details essential for comprehending demonstrative instructions. Further, we propose a synthetic discriminative training strategy to fine-tune VPG-C, eliminating the need for supervised demonstrative instructions. As for evaluation, we build DEMON, a comprehensive benchmark for demonstrative instruction understanding. Synthetically trained with the proposed strategy, VPG-C achieves significantly stronger zero-shot performance across all tasks of DEMON. Further evaluation on the MME and OwlEval benchmarks also demonstrate the superiority of VPG-C.

Existing research on learning from multi-source data mostly assume that each client owns the data of all modalities, which may largely limit its practicability. In light of the expensiveness and sparsity of multimodal data, we propose patchwork learning to jointly learn from fragmented multimodal data in distributed clients. Considering the concerns on data privacy, patchwork learning aims to impute incomplete multimodal data for diverse downstream tasks without accessing the raw data directly. Local clients could miss different modality combinations. Due to the statistical heterogeneity induced by non-i.i.d. data, the imputation is more challenging since the learned dependencies fail to adapt to the imputation of other clients. In this paper, we provide a novel imputation framework to tackle modality combination heterogeneity and statistical heterogeneity simultaneously, called \`\`collaborative adaptation''. In particular, for two observed modality combinations from two clients, we learn the transformations between their maximal intersection and other modalities by proposing a novel ELBO. We improve the worst-performing required transformations through a Pareto min-max optimization framework. In extensive experiments, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared to existing related methods on benchmark data sets and a real-world clinical data set. | Sen Cui, Abudukelimu Wuerkaixi, Weishen Pan, Jian Liang, Lei Fang, Changshui Zhang, Fei Wang |  |
| 645 |  |  [Towards Energy Efficient Spiking Neural Networks: An Unstructured Pruning Framework](https://openreview.net/forum?id=eoSeaK4QJo) |  | 0 | Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as energy-efficient alternatives to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) when deployed on neuromorphic chips. While recent studies have demonstrated the impressive performance of deep SNNs on challenging tasks, their energy efficiency advantage has been diminished. Existing methods targeting energy consumption reduction do not fully exploit sparsity, whereas powerful pruning methods can achieve high sparsity but are not directly targeted at energy efficiency, limiting their effectiveness in energy saving. Furthermore, none of these works fully exploit the sparsity of neurons or the potential for unstructured neuron pruning in SNNs. In this paper, we propose a novel pruning framework that combines unstructured weight pruning with unstructured neuron pruning to maximize the utilization of the sparsity of neuromorphic computing, thereby enhancing energy efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of unstructured neuron pruning to deep SNNs. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves impressive energy efficiency gains. The sparse network pruned by our method with only 0.63\% remaining connections can achieve a remarkable 91 times increase in energy efficiency compared to the original dense network, requiring only 8.5M SOPs for inference, with merely 2.19\% accuracy loss on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Our work suggests that deep and dense SNNs exhibit high redundancy in energy consumption, highlighting the potential for targeted SNN sparsification to save energy. | Xinyu Shi, Jianhao Ding, Zecheng Hao, Zhaofei Yu |  |

Mainstream SNN training schemes apply backpropagation-through-time (BPTT) with surrogate gradients to replace the non-differentiable spike emitting process during backpropagation. While achieving competitive performance, the requirement for storing intermediate information at all time-steps incurs higher memory consumption and fails to fulfill the online property crucial to biological brains. Our work focuses on online training techniques, aiming for memory efficiency while preserving biological plausibility. The limitation of not having access to future information in early time steps in online training has constrained previous efforts to incorporate advantageous modules such as batch normalization. To address this problem, we propose Online Spiking Renormalization (OSR) to ensure consistent parameters between testing and training, and Online Threshold Stabilizer (OTS) to stabilize neuron firing rates across time steps. Furthermore, we design a novel online approach to compute the sample mean and variance over time for OSR. Experiments conducted on various datasets demonstrate the proposed method's superior performance among SNN online training algorithms.

However, this approach faces limitations when applied to scene-centric datasets, where multiple objects within an image are only implicitly captured in the global representation. Such global bootstrapping can lead to undesirable entanglement of object representations. Furthermore, even object-centric datasets stand to benefit from a finer-grained bootstrapping approach. In response to these challenges, we introduce a novel $\textbf{Cr}$oss-$\textbf{I}$mage Object-Level $\textbf{Bo}$otstrapping method tailored to enhance dense visual representation learning. By employing object-level nearest neighbor bootstrapping throughout the training, CrIBo emerges as a notably strong and adequate candidate for in-context learning, leveraging nearest neighbor retrieval at test time. CrIBo shows state-of-the-art performance on the latter task while being highly competitive in more standard downstream segmentation tasks.

The existing methods fail to simultaneously achieve the goals of accurate 3D avatar reconstruction and stable talking face animation. Besides, while the existing works mainly focus on synthesizing the head part, it is also vital to generate natural torso and background segments to obtain a realistic talking portrait video. To address these limitations, we present Real3D-Potrait, a framework that (1) improves the one-shot 3D reconstruction power with a large image-to-plane model that distills 3D prior knowledge from a 3D face generative model; (2) facilitates accurate motion-conditioned animation with an efficient motion adapter; (3) synthesizes realistic video with natural torso movement and switchable background using a head-torso-background super-resolution model; and (4) supports one-shot audio-driven talking face generation with a generalizable audio-to-motion model.

However, despite the recent efforts, the non-DL algorithms based on gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDT) remain a strong go-to solution for these problems. One of the research directions aimed at improving the position of tabular DL involves designing so-called retrieval-augmented models. For a target object, such models retrieve other objects (e.g. the nearest neighbors) from the available training data and use their features and labels to make a better prediction. In this work, we present TabR -- essentially, a feed-forward network with a custom k-Nearest-Neighbors-like component in the middle. On a set of public benchmarks with datasets up to several million objects, TabR marks a big step forward for tabular DL: it demonstrates the best average performance among tabular DL models, becomes the new state-of-the-art on several datasets, and even outperforms GBDT models on the recently proposed "GBDT-friendly" benchmark (see Figure 1). Among the important findings and technical details powering TabR, the main ones lie in the attention-like mechanism that is responsible for retrieving the nearest neighbors and extracting valuable signal from them. In addition to the higher performance, TabR is simple and significantly more efficient compared to prior retrieval-based tabular DL models. | Yury Gorishniy, Ivan Rubachev, Nikolay Kartashev, Daniil Shlenskii, Akim Kotelnikov, Artem Babenko |  |

Recent work, e.g., Tree of Thoughts, has pointed out the importance of exploration and self-evaluation in reasoning step selection for complex problem solving. In this paper, we present Boosting of Thoughts (BoT), an automated prompting framework for problem solving with LLMs by iteratively exploring and self-evaluating many trees of thoughts in order to acquire an ensemble of trial-and-error reasoning experiences, which will serve as a new form of prompting to solve the complex problem. Starting from a simple prompt without requiring examples, BoT iteratively explores and evaluates a large collection of reasoning steps, and more importantly, uses error analysis obtained from the LLM on them to explicitly revise prompting, which in turn enhances reasoning step generation, until a final answer is attained. Our experiments with GPT-4 and Llama2 across extensive complex mathematical problems demonstrate that BoT consistently achieves higher or comparable problem-solving rates than other advanced prompting approaches. | Sijia Chen, Baochun Li, Di Niu |  |

From the online learning perspective, a Follow-The-Leader (FTL) world model is desirable, which optimally fits all previous experiences at each round. Unfortunately, NN-based models need re-training on all accumulated data at every interaction step to achieve FTL, which is computationally expensive for lifelong agents. In this paper, we revisit models that can achieve FTL with incremental updates. Specifically, our world model is a linear regression model supported by nonlinear random features. The linear part ensures efficient FTL update while the nonlinear random feature empowers the fitting of complex environments. To best trade off model capacity and computation efficiency, we introduce a locality sensitive sparse encoding, which allows us to conduct efficient sparse updates even with very high dimensional nonlinear features. We validate the representation power of our encoding and verify that it allows efficient online learning under data covariate shift. We also show, in the Dyna MBRL setting, that our world models learned online using a $\textit{single pass}$ of trajectory data either surpass or match the performance of deep world models trained with replay and other continual learning methods. | Zichen Liu, Chao Du, Wee Sun Lee, Min Lin |  |
| 652 |  |  [Enhancing Neural Subset Selection: Integrating Background Information into Set Representations](https://openreview.net/forum?id=eepoE7iLpL) |  | 0 | Learning neural subset selection tasks, such as compound selection in AI-aided drug discovery, have become increasingly pivotal across diverse applications. The existing methodologies in the field primarily concentrate on constructing models that capture the relationship between utility function values and subsets within their respective supersets. However, these approaches tend to overlook the valuable information contained within the superset when utilizing neural networks to model set functions. In this work, we address this oversight by adopting a probabilistic perspective. Our theoretical findings demonstrate that when the target value is conditioned on both the input set and subset, it is essential to incorporate an invariant sufficient statistic of the superset into the subset of interest for effective learning. This ensures that the output value remains invariant to permutations of the subset and its corresponding superset, enabling identification of the specific superset from which the subset originated. Motivated by these insights, we propose a simple yet effective information aggregation module designed to merge the representations of subsets and supersets from a permutation invariance perspective. Comprehensive empirical evaluations across diverse tasks and datasets validate the enhanced efficacy of our approach over conventional methods, underscoring the practicality and potency of our proposed strategies in real-world contexts. | Binghui Xie, Yatao Bian, Kaiwen Zhou, Yongqiang Chen, Peilin Zhao, Bo Han, Wei Meng, James Cheng |  |

VLAP transforms the embedding space of pretrained vision models into the LLMs' word embedding space using a single linear layer for efficient and general-purpose visual and language understanding. Specifically, we harness well-established word embeddings to bridge two modality embedding spaces. The visual and text representations are simultaneously assigned to a set of word embeddings within pretrained LLMs by formulating the assigning procedure as an optimal transport problem. We predict the assignment of one modality from the representation of another modality data, enforcing consistent assignments for paired multimodal data. This allows vision and language representations to contain the same information, grounding the frozen LLMs' word embedding space in visual data. Moreover, a robust semantic taxonomy of LLMs can be preserved with visual data since the LLMs interpret and reason linguistic information from correlations between word embeddings. Experimental results show that VLAP achieves substantial improvements over the previous linear transformation-based approaches across a range of vision-language tasks, including image captioning, visual question answering, and cross-modal retrieval. We also demonstrate the learned visual representations hold a semantic taxonomy of LLMs, making visual semantic arithmetic possible. | Jungin Park, Jiyoung Lee, Kwanghoon Sohn |  |

In the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), researchers have shifted their focus from conventional NLP tasks (e.g., sequence tagging and parsing) towards tasks that revolve around aligning with human needs (e.g., brainstorming and email writing). This shift in task distribution imposes new requirements on evaluating these aligned models regarding \*generality\* (i.e., assessing performance across diverse scenarios), \*flexibility\* (i.e., examining under different protocols), and \*interpretability\* (i.e., scrutinizing models with explanations). In this paper, we propose a generative judge with 13B parameters, \*\*Auto-J\*\*, designed to address these challenges. Our model is trained on user queries and LLM-generated responses under massive real-world scenarios and accommodates diverse evaluation protocols (e.g., pairwise response comparison and single-response evaluation) with well-structured natural language critiques. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we construct a new testbed covering 58 different scenarios. Experimentally, \*\*Auto-J\*\* outperforms a series of strong competitors, including both open-source and closed-source models, by a large margin. We also provide detailed analysis and case studies to further reveal the potential of our method and make a variety of resources public at https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/auto-j. | Junlong Li, Shichao Sun, Weizhe Yuan, RunZe Fan, Hai Zhao, Pengfei Liu |  |

Despite the existence of numerous approaches proposed to enhance GNNs based on Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) tests, what GNNs can and cannot learn still lacks a deeper understanding. This paper adopts a fundamentally different approach to examine the expressive power of GNNs from a probabilistic perspective. By establishing connections between GNNs' predictions and the central inference problems of probabilistic graphical models (PGMs), we can analyze previous GNN variants with a novel hierarchical framework and gain new insights into their node-level and link-level behaviors. Additionally, we introduce novel methods that can provably enhance GNNs' ability to capture complex dependencies and make complex predictions. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches. | Tuo Xu, Lei Zou |  |

We propose a novel instance-conditional reweighting approach that captures predictive uncertainty using an auxiliary network, and unifies these train- and test-time applications. The auxiliary network is trained using a meta-objective in a bilevel optimization framework. A key contribution of our proposal is the meta-objective of minimizing dropout variance, an approximation of Bayesian predictive uncertainty, We show in controlled experiments that we effectively capture diverse specific notions of uncertainty through this meta-objective, while previous approaches only capture certain aspects. These results translate to significant gains in real-world settings–selective classification, label noise, domain adaptation, calibration–and across datasets–Imagenet, Cifar100, diabetic retinopathy, Camelyon, WILDs, Imagenet-C,-A,-R, Clothing-1.6M, etc. For Diabetic Retinopathy, we see upto 3.4\%/3.3\% accuracy & AUC gains over SOTA in selective classification. We also improve upon large-scale pretrained models such as PLEX. | Nishant Jain, Karthikeyan Shanmugam, Pradeep Shenoy |  |

Here, we first address compelling challenges related to the "forward-only" rules, which include reducing the performance gap with backpropagation and providing an analytical understanding of their dynamics. To this end, we show that the forward-only algorithm with top-down feedback is well-approximated by an "adaptive-feedback-alignment" algorithm, and we analytically track its performance during learning in a prototype high-dimensional setting. Then, we compare different versions of forward-only algorithms, focusing on the Forward-Forward and PEPITA frameworks, and we show that they share the same learning principles. Overall, our work unveils the connections between three key neuro-inspired learning rules, providing a link between "forward-only" algorithms, i.e., Forward-Forward and PEPITA, and an approximation of backpropagation, i.e., Feedback Alignment. | Ravi Francesco Srinivasan, Francesca Mignacco, Martino Sorbaro, Maria Refinetti, Avi Cooper, Gabriel Kreiman, Giorgia Dellaferrera |  |
| 658 |  |  [Towards Cross Domain Generalization of Hamiltonian Representation via Meta Learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=AZGIwqCyYY) |  | 0 | Recent advances in deep learning for physics have focused on discovering shared representations of target systems by incorporating physics priors or inductive biases into neural networks. While effective, these methods are limited to the system domain, where the type of system remains consistent and thus cannot ensure the adaptation to new, or unseen physical systems governed by different laws. For instance, a neural network trained on a mass-spring system cannot guarantee accurate predictions for the behavior of a two-body system or any other system with different physical laws. In this work, we take a significant leap forward by targeting cross domain generalization within the field of Hamiltonian dynamics. We model our system with a graph neural network (GNN) and employ a meta learning algorithm to enable the model to gain experience over a distribution of systems and make it adapt to new physics. Our approach aims to learn a unified Hamiltonian representation that is generalizable across multiple system domains, thereby overcoming the limitations of system-specific models. We demonstrate that the meta-trained model captures the generalized Hamiltonian representation that is consistent across different physical domains. Overall, through the use of meta learning, we offer a framework that achieves cross domain generalization, providing a step towards a unified model for understanding a wide array of dynamical systems via deep learning. | Yeongwoo Song, Hawoong Jeong |  |
| 659 |  |  [What Makes Good Data for Alignment? A Comprehensive Study of Automatic Data Selection in Instruction Tuning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=BTKAeLqLMw) |  | 0 | Instruction tuning is a standard technique employed to align large language models to end tasks and user preferences after the initial pretraining phase. Recent research indicates the critical role of data engineering in instruction tuning -- when appropriately selected, only limited data is necessary to achieve superior performance. However, we still lack a principled understanding of what makes good instruction tuning data for alignment, and how we should select data automatically and effectively. In this work, we delve deeply into automatic data selection strategies for alignment. We start with controlled studies to measure data across three dimensions: complexity, quality, and diversity, along which we examine existing methods and introduce novel techniques for enhanced data measurement. Subsequently, we propose a simple strategy to select data samples based on the measurement. We present Deita (short for Data-Efficient Instruction Tuning for Alignment), a series of models fine-tuned from LLaMA models using data samples automatically selected with our proposed approach. When assessed through both automatic metrics and human evaluation, Deita performs better or on par with the state-of-the-art open-source alignment models such as Vicuna and WizardLM with only 6K training data samples -- 10x less than the data used in the baselines. We anticipate this work to provide clear guidelines and tools on automatic data selection, aiding researchers and practitioners in achieving data-efficient alignment. | Wei Liu, Weihao Zeng, Keqing He, Yong Jiang, Junxian He |  |

Although a number of existing research have been devoted to investigating the interpretability of graph neural networks (GNNs), achieving the interpretability of DyGNNs is pivotally challenging due to the complex spatial-temporal correlations in dynamic graphs. To this end, we propose an innovative causality-inspired generative model based on structural causal model (SCM), which explores the underlying philosophies of DyGNN predictions by identifying the trivial, static, and dynamic causal relationships. To reach this goal, two critical tasks need to be accomplished including (1) disentangling the complex causal relationships, and (2) fitting the spatial-temporal explanations of DyGNNs in the SCM architecture. To tackle these challenges, the proposed method incorporates a contrastive learning module to disentangle trivial and causal relationships, and a dynamic correlating module to disentangle dynamic and static causal relationships, respectively. A dynamic VGAE-based framework is further developed, which generates causal-and-dynamic masks for spatial interpretability, and recognizes dynamic relationships along the time horizon through causal invention for temporal interpretability. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets, where our approach yields substantial improvements, thereby demonstrating significant superiority. | Kesen Zhao, Liang Zhang |  |

While improving performance on domain tasks, it often brings a side-effect of forgetting of the model's general abilities. In this study, we analyze the effects of finetuning on language models by dissecting its impacts on the modeling of topic, style, and factual knowledge in text. Our method uses instruction-following LLMs such as ChatGPT to auto-generate controlled-variable text examples which we use to probe the model. Our findings reveal that finetuning results in significant shifts in the language model's topic and style priors, while actual knowledge learning only contributes to a small fraction of the total probability change. Analysis shows that the adaptation of topic and style priors behave akin to learning simple features: they are learned rapidly and require little model capacity. They are also learned independently and primarily at the beginning of a text sequence. In contrast, factual knowledge is learned stably but slowly and requires significant model capacity to learn. The research offers insights and understanding into the finer dynamics of learning and forgetting in language models, and can potentially inform future research on improving domain adaptation and addressing the challenges of forgetting in continual learning of language models. | Xiao Zhang, Ji Wu |  |

However, existing TTA methods mainly concentrate on uni-modal tasks, overlooking the complexity of multi-modal scenarios. In this paper, we delve into the multi-modal test-time adaptation and reveal a new challenge named reliability bias. Different from the definition of traditional distribution shifts, reliability bias refers to the information discrepancies across different modalities derived from intra-modal distribution shifts. To solve the challenge, we propose a novel method, dubbed REliable fusion and robust ADaptation (READ). On the one hand, unlike the existing TTA paradigm that mainly repurposes the normalization layers, READ employs a new paradigm that modulates the attention between modalities in a self-adaptive way, supporting reliable fusion against reliability bias. On the other hand, READ adopts a novel objective function for robust multi-modal adaptation, where the contributions of confident predictions could be amplified and the negative impacts of noisy predictions could be mitigated. Moreover, we introduce two new benchmarks to facilitate comprehensive evaluations of multi-modal TTA under reliability bias. Extensive experiments on the benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our method against multi-modal reliability bias. The code and benchmarks are available at https://github.com/XLearning-SCU/2024-ICLR-READ. | Mouxing Yang, Yunfan Li, Changqing Zhang, Peng Hu, Xi Peng |  |

There is a pressing need to scale training of GNNs on large datasets to enable their usage on low-resource environments. Graph distillation is an effort in that direction with the aim to construct a smaller synthetic training set from the original training data without significantly compromising model performance. While initial efforts are promising, this work is motivated by two key observations: (1) Existing graph distillation algorithms themselves rely on training with the full dataset, which undermines the very premise of graph distillation. (2) The distillation process is specific to the target GNN architecture and hyper-parameters and thus not robust to changes in the modeling pipeline. We circumvent these limitations by designing a distillation algorithm called MIRAGE for graph classification. MIRAGE is built on the insight that a message-passing GNN decomposes the input graph into a multiset of computation trees. Furthermore, the frequency distribution of computation trees is often skewed in nature, enabling us to condense this data into a concise distilled summary. By compressing the computation data itself, as opposed to emulating gradient flows on the original training set—a prevalent approach to date—MIRAGE transforms into an unsupervised and architecture-agnostic distillation algorithm. Extensive benchmarking on real-world datasets underscores MIRAGE’s superiority, showcasing enhanced generalization accuracy, data compression, and distillation efficiency when compared to state-of-the-art baselines. | Mridul Gupta, Sahil Manchanda, Hariprasad Kodamana, Sayan Ranu |  |

Existing watermarking strategies operate by altering the decoder of an existing language model. In this paper, we ask whether language models can directly learn to generate watermarked text, which would have significant implications for the real-world deployment of watermarks. First, learned watermarks could be used to build open models that naturally generate watermarked text, enabling watermarking for open models, where users can control the decoding procedure. Second, if watermarking is used to determine the provenance of generated text, an adversary can hurt the reputation of a victim model by spoofing its watermark and generating damaging watermarked text. To investigate the learnability of watermarks, we propose watermark distillation, which trains a student model to behave like a teacher model that uses decoding-based watermarking. We test our approach on three decoding-based watermarking strategies and various hyperparameter settings, finding that models can learn to generate watermarked text with high detectability. We also find limitations to learnability, including the loss of watermarking capabilities under fine-tuning on normal text and high sample complexity when learning low-distortion watermarks. | Chenchen Gu, Xiang Lisa Li, Percy Liang, Tatsunori Hashimoto |  |

However, the intensive computational demands of these models, especially during the finetuning process and sampling processes, pose significant challenges for low-resource scenarios. This paper introduces Bellman Optimal Stepsize Straightening (BOSS) technique for distilling flow-matching generative models: it aims specifically for a few-step efficient image sampling while adhering to a computational budget constraint. First, this technique involves a dynamic programming algorithm that optimizes the stepsizes of the pretrained network. Then, it refines the velocity network to match the optimal step sizes, aiming to straighten the generation paths. Extensive experimental evaluations across image generation tasks demonstrate the efficacy of BOSS in terms of both resource utilization and image quality. Our results reveal that BOSS achieves substantial gains in efficiency while maintaining competitive sample quality, effectively bridging the gap between low-resource constraints and the demanding requirements of flow-matching generative models. Our paper also fortifies the responsible development of artificial intelligence, offering a more sustainable generative model that reduces computational costs and environmental footprints.

Nonetheless, these architectures falter on tail labels with few representative samples. This phenomenon has been attributed to factors such as classifier over-fitting and missing label bias, and solutions involving regularization and loss re-calibration have been developed. This paper explores the impact of label variance - a previously unexamined factor - on the tail performance in extreme classifiers. It also develops a method to systematically reduce label variance in XC by transferring the knowledge from a specialized tail-robust teacher model to the OvA classifiers. For this purpose, it proposes a principled knowledge distillation framework, LEVER, which enhances the tail performance in extreme classifiers with formal guarantees on generalization. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on a diverse set of XC datasets, demonstrating that LEVER can enhance tail performance by around 5\% and 6\% points in PSP and coverage metrics, respectively, when integrated with leading extreme classifiers. Moreover, it establishes a new state-of-the-art when added to the top-performing Renee classifier. Extensive ablations and analyses substantiate the efficacy of our design choices. Another significant contribution is the release of two new XC datasets that are different from and more challenging than the available benchmark datasets, thereby encouraging more rigorous algorithmic evaluation in the future. Code for LEVER is available at: aka.ms/lever. | Anirudh Buvanesh, Rahul Chand, Jatin Prakash, Bhawna Paliwal, Mudit Dhawan, Neelabh Madan, Deepesh Hada, Vidit Jain, Sonu Mehta, Yashoteja Prabhu, Manish Gupta, Ramachandran Ramjee, Manik Varma |  |
| 667 |  |  [Is This the Subspace You Are Looking for? An Interpretability Illusion for Subspace Activation Patching](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Ebt7JgMHv1) |  | 0 | Mechanistic interpretability aims to attribute high-level model behaviors to specific, interpretable learned features. It is hypothesized that these features manifest as directions or low-dimensional subspaces within activation space. Accordingly, recent studies have explored the identification and manipulation of such subspaces to reverse-engineer computations, employing methods such as activation patching. In this work, we demonstrate that naïve approaches to subspace interventions can give rise to interpretability illusions. Specifically, even if patching along a subspace has the intended end-to-end causal effect on model behavior, this effect may be achieved by activating \emph{a dormant parallel pathway} using a component that is \textit{causally disconnected} from the model output. We demonstrate this in a mathematical example, realize the example empirically in two different settings (the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) task and factual recall), and argue that activating dormant pathways ought to be prevalent in practice. In the context of factual recall, we further show that the illusion is related to rank-1 fact editing, providing a mechanistic explanation for previous work observing an inconsistency between fact editing performance and fact localisation. However, this does not imply that activation patching of subspaces is intrinsically unfit for interpretability. To contextualize our findings, we also show what a success case looks like in a task (IOI) where prior manual circuit analysis allows an understanding of the location of the ground truth feature. We explore the additional evidence needed to argue that a patched subspace is faithful. | Aleksandar Makelov, Georg Lange, Atticus Geiger, Neel Nanda |  |

This paper quantifies theoretically to what extent this extra information reduces RL's sample complexity. In particular, we study the demonstration-regularized reinforcement learning framework that leverages the expert demonstrations by $\mathrm{KL}$-regularization for a policy learned by behavior cloning. Our findings reveal that using $N^{\mathrm{E}}$ expert demonstrations enables the identification of an optimal policy at a sample complexity of order $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\mathrm{Poly}(S,A,H)/(\varepsilon^2 N^{\mathrm{E}}))$ in finite and $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\mathrm{Poly}(d,H)/(\varepsilon^2 N^{\mathrm{E}}))$ in linear Markov decision processes, where $\varepsilon$is the target precision, $H$ the horizon, $A$ the number of action, $S$ the number of states in the finite case and $d$ the dimension of the feature space in the linear case. As a by-product, we provide tight convergence guarantees for the behavior cloning procedure under general assumptions on the policy classes. Additionally, we establish that demonstration-regularized methods are provably efficient for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). In this respect, we provide theoretical evidence showing the benefits of KL-regularization for RLHF in tabular and linear MDPs. Interestingly, we avoid pessimism injection by employing computationally feasible regularization to handle reward estimation uncertainty, thus setting our approach apart from the prior works. | Daniil Tiapkin, Denis Belomestny, Daniele Calandriello, Eric Moulines, Alexey Naumov, Pierre Perrault, Michal Valko, Pierre Ménard |  |

Although several preventive measures have been developed to mitigate the potential risks associated with LLMs, they have primarily focused on English. In this study, we reveal the presence of multilingual jailbreak challenges within LLMs and consider two potential risky scenarios: unintentional and intentional. The unintentional scenario involves users querying LLMs using non-English prompts and inadvertently bypassing the safety mechanisms, while the intentional scenario concerns malicious users combining malicious instructions with multilingual prompts to deliberately attack LLMs. The experimental results reveal that in the unintentional scenario, the rate of unsafe content increases as the availability of languages decreases. Specifically, low-resource languages exhibit about three times the likelihood of encountering harmful content compared to high-resource languages, with both ChatGPT and GPT-4. In the intentional scenario, multilingual prompts can exacerbate the negative impact of malicious instructions, with astonishingly high rates of unsafe output: 80.92\% for ChatGPT and 40.71\% for GPT-4. To handle such a challenge in the multilingual context, we propose a novel \textsc{Self-Defense} framework that automatically generates multilingual training data for safety fine-tuning. Experimental results show that ChatGPT fine-tuned with such data can achieve a substantial reduction in unsafe content generation.

However, the Gaussian tail often decays too quickly to effectively accommodate the encoded points, failing to preserve crucial structures hidden in the data. In this paper, we explore the use of heavy-tailed models to combat over-regularization. Drawing upon insights from information geometry, we propose $t^3$VAE, a modified VAE framework that incorporates Student's t-distributions for the prior, encoder, and decoder. This results in a joint model distribution of a power form which we argue can better fit real-world datasets. We derive a new objective by reformulating the evidence lower bound as joint optimization of KL divergence between two statistical manifolds and replacing with $\gamma$-power divergence, a natural alternative for power families. $t^3$VAE demonstrates superior generation of low-density regions when trained on heavy-tailed synthetic data. Furthermore, we show that $t^3$VAE significantly outperforms other models on CelebA and imbalanced CIFAR-100 datasets. | Juno Kim, Jaehyuk Kwon, Mincheol Cho, Hyunjong Lee, JoongHo Won |  |

Graph canonization is known as a typical approach to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs, yet rarely adopted when developing expressive GNNs. This paper proposes to maximize the expressivity of GNNs by graph canonization, then the power of such GNNs is studies from the perspective of model stability. A stable GNN will map similar graphs to close graph representations in the vectorial space, and the stability of GNNs is critical to generalize their performance to unseen graphs. We theoretically reveal the trade-off of expressivity and stability in graph-canonization-enhanced GNNs. Then we introduce a notion of universal graph canonization as the general solution to address the trade-off and characterize a widely applicable sufficient condition to solve the universal graph canonization. A comprehensive set of experiments demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method. In many popular graph benchmark datasets, graph canonization successfully enhances GNNs and provides highly competitive performance, indicating the capability and great potential of proposed method in general graph representation learning. In graph datasets where the sufficient condition holds, GNNs enhanced by universal graph canonization consistently outperform GNN baselines and successfully improve the SOTA performance up to $31$%, providing the optimal solution to numerous challenging real-world graph analytical tasks like gene network representation learning in bioinformatics. | Zehao Dong, Muhan Zhang, Philip R.

Traditional energy minimization techniques rely on iterative optimization methods that use molecular forces calculated by a physical simulator (oracle) as anti-gradients. However, this is a computationally expensive approach that requires many interactions with a physical simulator. One way to accelerate this procedure is to replace the physical simulator with a neural network. Despite recent progress in neural networks for molecular conformation energy prediction, such models are prone to errors due to distribution shift, leading to inaccurate energy minimization. We find that the quality of energy minimization with neural networks can be improved by providing optimization trajectories as additional training data. Still, obtaining complete optimization trajectories demands a lot of additional computations. To reduce the required additional data, we present the Gradual Optimization Learning Framework (GOLF) for energy minimization with neural networks. The framework consists of an efficient data-collecting scheme and an external optimizer. The external optimizer utilizes gradients from the energy prediction model to generate optimization trajectories, and the data-collecting scheme selects additional training data to be processed by the physical simulator. Our results demonstrate that the neural network trained with GOLF performs \textit{on par} with the oracle on a benchmark of diverse drug-like molecules using significantly less additional data. | Artem Tsypin, Leonid Ugadiarov, Kuzma Khrabrov, Alexander Telepov, Egor Rumiantsev, Alexey Skrynnik, Aleksandr Panov, Dmitry P.

It is a crucial task when training data is not accessible due to various concerns, e.g., data privacy, yet it is challenging since the models need to generalize to anomalies across different domains where the appearance of foreground objects, abnormal regions, and background features, such as defects/tumors on different products/ organs, can vary significantly. Recently large pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated strong zero-shot recognition ability in various vision tasks, including anomaly detection. However, their ZSAD performance is weak since the VLMs focus more on modeling the class semantics of the foreground objects rather than the abnormality/normality in the images. In this paper we introduce a novel approach, namely AnomalyCLIP, to adapt CLIP for accurate ZSAD across different domains. The key insight of AnomalyCLIP is to learn object-agnostic text prompts that capture generic normality and abnormality in an image regardless of its foreground objects. This allows our model to focus on the abnormal image regions rather than the object semantics, enabling generalized normality and abnormality recognition on diverse types of objects. Large-scale experiments on 17 real-world anomaly detection datasets show that AnomalyCLIP achieves superior zero-shot performance of detecting and segmenting anomalies in datasets of highly diverse class semantics from various defect inspection and medical imaging domains.

It explains the prediction results by identifying a small subset of the inputs sufficient to support them. Since existing methods still suffer from adopting the shortcuts in data to compose rationales and limited large-scale annotated rationales by human, in this paper, we propose a Shortcuts-fused Selective Rationalization (SSR) method, which boosts the rationalization by discovering and exploiting potential shortcuts. Specifically, SSR first designs a shortcuts discovery approach to detect several potential shortcuts. Then, by introducing the identified shortcuts, we propose two strategies to mitigate the problem of utilizing shortcuts to compose rationales. Finally, we develop two data augmentations methods to close the gap in the number of annotated rationales. Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets clearly validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. | Linan Yue, Qi Liu, Yichao Du, Li Wang, Weibo Gao, Yanqing An |  |

To sidestep the difficulty of contact modeling in conventional modeling-based approaches, reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a promising alternative. However, previous RL approaches either lack the ability to generalize over diverse object shapes, or use simple action primitives that limit the diversity of robot motions. Furthermore, using RL over diverse object geometry is challenging due to the high cost of training a policy that takes in high-dimensional sensory inputs. We propose a novel contact-based object representation and pretraining pipeline to tackle this. To enable massively parallel training, we leverage a lightweight patch-based transformer architecture for our encoder that processes point clouds, thus scaling our training across thousands of environments. Compared to learning from scratch, or other shape representation baselines, our representation facilitates both time- and data-efficient learning. We validate the efficacy of our overall system by zero-shot transferring the trained policy to novel real-world objects. We highly recommend the video attached in the supplementary material.

Recently, a simple equivariant network, Vector Neuron (VN) has been proposed that can be easily used with the state-of-the-art 3D neural network (NN) architectures. However, its performance is limited because it is designed to use only three-dimensional features, which is insufficient to capture the details present in 3D data. In this paper, we introduce an equivariant feature representation for mapping a 3D point to a high-dimensional feature space. Our feature can discern multiple frequencies present in 3D data, which, as shown by Tancik et al. (2020), is the key to designing an expressive feature for 3D vision tasks. Our representation can be used as an input to VNs, and the results demonstrate that with our feature representation, VN captures more details, overcoming the limitation raised in its original paper. | Dongwon Son, Jaehyung Kim, Sanghyeon Son, Beomjoon Kim |  |

Rather than merely exploring the breadth of LLM abilities, we believe meticulous and thoughtful designs are essential to thorough, unbiased, and applicable evaluations. Given the importance of world knowledge to LLMs, we construct a Knowledge-oriented LLM Assessment benchmark (KoLA), in which we carefully design three crucial factors: (1) For ability modeling, we mimic human cognition to form a four-level taxonomy of knowledge-related abilities, covering 19 tasks. (2) For data, to ensure fair comparisons, we use both Wikipedia, a corpus prevalently pre-trained by LLMs, along with continuously collected emerging corpora, aiming to evaluate the capacity to handle unseen data and evolving knowledge. (3) For evaluation criteria, we adopt a contrastive system, including overall standard scores for better numerical comparability across tasks and models, and a unique self-contrast metric for automatically evaluating knowledge-creating ability. We evaluate 21 open-source and commercial LLMs and obtain some intriguing findings. The KoLA dataset will be updated every three months to provide timely references for developing LLMs and knowledge-related systems. | Jifan Yu, Xiaozhi Wang, Shangqing Tu, Shulin Cao, Daniel ZhangLi, Xin Lv, Hao Peng, Zijun Yao, Xiaohan Zhang, Hanming Li, Chunyang Li, Zheyuan Zhang, Yushi Bai, Yantao Liu, Amy Xin, Kaifeng Yun, Linlu Gong, Nianyi Lin, Jianhui Chen, Zhili Wu, Yunjia Qi, Weikai Li, Yong Guan, Kaisheng Zeng, Ji Qi, Hailong Jin, Jinxin Liu, Yu Gu, Yuan Yao, Ning Ding, Lei Hou, Zhiyuan Liu, Bin Xu, Jie Tang, Juanzi Li |  |

State-of-the-art graph pooling methods follow a hierarchical approach, which reduces the graph size step-by-step. These methods must balance memory efficiency with preserving node information, depending on whether they use node dropping or node clustering. Additionally, fixed pooling ratios or numbers of pooling layers are predefined for all graphs, which prevents personalized pooling structures from being captured for each individual graph. In this work, inspired by bottom-up grammar induction, we propose an efficient graph parsing algorithm to infer the pooling structure, which then drives graph pooling. The resulting Graph Parsing Network (GPN) adaptively learns personalized pooling structure for each individual graph. GPN benefits from the discrete assignments generated by the graph parsing algorithm, allowing good memory efficiency while preserving node information intact. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that GPN outperforms state-of-the-art graph pooling methods in graph classification tasks while being able to achieve competitive performance in node classification tasks. We also conduct a graph reconstruction task to show GPN's ability to preserve node information and measure both memory and time efficiency through relevant tests. | Yunchong Song, Siyuan Huang, Xinbing Wang, Chenghu Zhou, Zhouhan Lin |  |

Recent works mainly focus on dynamic spatial modeling with adaptive graph embedding or graph attention having less consideration for temporal characteristics and in-situ modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning model named TESTAM, which individually models recurring and non-recurring traffic patterns by a mixture-of-experts model with three experts on temporal modeling, spatio-temporal modeling with static graph, and dynamic spatio-temporal dependency modeling with dynamic graph. By introducing different experts and properly routing them, TESTAM could better model various circumstances, including spatially isolated nodes, highly related nodes, and recurring and non-recurring events. For the proper routing, we reformulate a gating problem into a classification problem with pseudo labels. Experimental results on three public traffic network datasets, METR-LA, PEMS-BAY, and EXPY-TKY, demonstrate that TESTAM achieves a better indication and modeling of recurring and non-recurring traffic. | Hyunwook Lee, Sungahn Ko |  |

While the increased expressivity of these models can indeed lead to a better classification performance and a more faithful representation of the underlying system, the computational cost of these higher-order models can increase dramatically. To this end, we here explore a simplicial complex neural network learning architecture based on random walks and fast 1D convolutions (SCRaWl), in which we can adjust the increase in computational cost by varying the length and number of random walks considered while accounting for higher-order relationships. Importantly, due to the random walk-based design, the expressivity of the proposed architecture is provably incomparable to that of existing message-passing simplicial neural networks. We empirically evaluate SCRaWl on real-world datasets and show that it outperforms other simplicial neural networks. | Florian Frantzen, Michael T. Schaub |  |

Hyperspectral data is a notable example, whose vast volume compromises real-time hyperspectral detection. To tackle this hurdle, we introduce a novel approach leveraging pre-acquisition modulation to reduce the acquisition volume. This modulation process is governed by a deep learning model, utilizing prior information. Central to our approach is LUM-ViT, a Vision Transformer variant. Uniquely, LUM-ViT incorporates a learnable under-sampling mask tailored for pre-acquisition modulation. To further optimize for optical calculations, we propose a kernel-level weight binarization technique and a three-stage fine-tuning strategy. Our evaluations reveal that, by sampling a mere 10\% of the original image pixels, LUM-ViT maintains the accuracy loss within 1.8\% on the ImageNet classification task. The method sustains near-original accuracy when implemented on real-world optical hardware, demonstrating its practicality.

Yet, existing models often fail to fully leverage the non-verbal social cues human subconsciously communicate when navigating the space. To address this, we introduce \*Social-Transmotion\*, a generic Transformer-based model that exploits diverse and numerous visual cues to predict human behavior. We translate the idea of a prompt from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to the task of human trajectory prediction, where a prompt can be a sequence of x-y coordinates on the ground, bounding boxes in the image plane, or body pose keypoints in either 2D or 3D. This, in turn, augments trajectory data, leading to enhanced human trajectory prediction. Using masking technique, our model exhibits flexibility and adaptability by capturing spatiotemporal interactions between agents based on the available visual cues. We delve into the merits of using 2D versus 3D poses, and a limited set of poses. Additionally, we investigate the spatial and temporal attention map to identify which keypoints and time-steps in the sequence are vital for optimizing human trajectory prediction. Our approach is validated on multiple datasets, including JTA, JRDB, Pedestrians and Cyclists in Road Traffic, and ETH-UCY.

However, these large networks are susceptible to overfitting to label noise, resulting in reduced generalization. To address this challenge, two promising approaches have emerged: i) loss reweighting, which reduces the influence of noisy examples on the training loss, and ii) label correction that replaces noisy labels with estimated true labels. These directions have been pursued separately or combined as independent methods, lacking a unified approach. In this work, we present a unified method that seamlessly combines loss reweighting and label correction to enhance robustness against label noise in classification tasks. Specifically, by leveraging ideas from compositional data analysis in statistics, we frame the problem as a regression task, where loss reweighting and label correction can naturally be achieved with a shifted Gaussian label noise model. Our unified approach achieves strong performance compared to recent baselines on several noisy labelled datasets. We believe this work is a promising step towards robust deep learning in the presence of label noise.

We introduce a new problem formulation for this scenario, and an algorithm minimizing a new surrogate loss function. We provide a complete theoretical analysis of the surrogate loss function with a strong $H$-consistency guarantee. For evaluation, we choose the \textit{decontextualization} task, and provide a manually-labelled dataset of $2\mathord,000$ examples. Our algorithm significantly outperforms the baselines considered, with a $\sim 25$% improvement in coverage when halving the error rate, which is only $\sim 3$% away from the theoretical limit. | Christopher Mohri, Daniel Andor, Eunsol Choi, Michael Collins, Anqi Mao, Yutao Zhong |  |

However, despite the importance of a protein’s dynamical properties for its function, conditioning on dynamical properties remains elusive. We present a new approach to protein generative modeling by leveraging Normal Mode Analysis that enables us to capture dynamical properties too. We introduce a method for conditioning the diffusion probabilistic models on protein dynamics, specifically on the lowest non-trivial normal mode of oscillation. Our method, similar to the classifier guidance conditioning, formulates the sampling process as being driven by conditional and unconditional terms. However, unlike previous works, we approximate the conditional term with a simple analytical function rather than an external neural network, thus making the eigenvector calculations approachable. We present the corresponding SDE theory as a formal justification of our approach. We extend our framework to conditioning on structure and dynamics at the same time, enabling scaffolding of the dynamical motifs. We demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of our method by turning the open-source unconditional protein diffusion model Genie into the conditional model with no retraining. Generated proteins exhibit the desired dynamical and structural properties while still being biologically plausible. Our work represents a first step towards incorporating dynamical behaviour in protein design and may open the door to designing more flexible and functional proteins in the future. | Urszula Julia Komorowska, Simon V.

Existing GNN-based GFD models are designed to augment graph structure to accommodate the inductive bias of GNNs towards homophily, by excluding heterophilic neighbors during message passing. In our work, we argue that the key to applying GNNs for GFD is not to exclude but to {\em distinguish} neighbors with different labels. Grounded in this perspective, we introduce Partitioning Message Passing (PMP), an intuitive yet effective message passing paradigm expressly crafted for GFD. Specifically, in the neighbor aggregation stage of PMP, neighbors with different classes are aggregated with distinct node-specific aggregation functions. By this means, the center node can adaptively adjust the information aggregated from its heterophilic and homophilic neighbors, thus avoiding the model gradient being dominated by benign nodes which occupy the majority of the population. We theoretically establish a connection between the spatial formulation of PMP and spectral analysis to characterize that PMP operates an adaptive node-specific spectral graph filter, which demonstrates the capability of PMP to handle heterophily-homophily mixed graphs. Extensive experimental results show that PMP can significantly boost the performance on GFD tasks. | Wei Zhuo, Zemin Liu, Bryan Hooi, Bingsheng He, Guang Tan, Rizal Fathony, Jia Chen |  |

An important instance of this problem is self-contradiction, where the LM generates two contradictory sentences within the same context. In this work, we present a comprehensive investigation into self-contradiction for various instruction-tuned LMs, covering evaluation, detection, and mitigation. Our primary evaluation task is open-domain text generation, but we also demonstrate the applicability of our approach to shorter question answering. Our analysis reveals the prevalence of self-contradictions, e.g., in 17.7% of all sentences produced by ChatGPT. We then propose a novel prompting-based framework designed to effectively detect and mitigate self-contradictions. Our detector achieves high accuracy, e.g., around 80% F1 score when prompting ChatGPT. The mitigation algorithm iteratively refines the generated text to remove contradictory information while preserving text fluency and informativeness. Importantly, our entire framework is applicable to black-box LMs and does not require retrieval of external knowledge. Rather, our method complements retrieval-based methods, as a large portion of self-contradictions (e.g., 35.2% for ChatGPT) cannot be verified using online text. Our approach is practically effective and has been released as a push-button tool to benefit the public at https://chatprotect.ai/. | Niels Mündler, Jingxuan He, Slobodan Jenko, Martin T. Vechev |  |

While prior studies have demonstrated that both losses yield symmetric training representations under balanced data, this symmetry breaks under class imbalances. This paper presents an intriguing discovery: the introduction of a ReLU activation at the final layer effectively restores the symmetry in SCL-learned representations. We arrive at this finding analytically, by establishing that the global minimizers of an unconstrained features model with SCL loss and entry-wise non-negativity constraints form an orthogonal frame. Extensive experiments conducted across various datasets, architectures, and imbalance scenarios corroborate our finding. Importantly, our experiments reveal that the inclusion of the ReLU activation restores symmetry without compromising test accuracy. This constitutes the first geometry characterization of SCL under imbalances. Additionally, our analysis and experiments underscore the pivotal role of batch selection strategies in representation geometry. By proving necessary and sufficient conditions for mini-batch choices that ensure invariant symmetric representations, we introduce batch-binding as an efficient strategy that guarantees these conditions hold. | Ganesh Ramachandra Kini, Vala Vakilian, Tina Behnia, Jaidev Gill, Christos Thrampoulidis |  |
| 689 |  |  [Manipulating dropout reveals an optimal balance of efficiency and robustness in biological and machine visual systems](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ADDCErFzev) |  | 0 | According to the efficient coding hypothesis, neural populations encode information optimally when representations are high-dimensional and uncorrelated. However, such codes may carry a cost in terms of generalization and robustness. Past empirical studies of early visual cortex (V1) in rodents have suggested that this tradeoff indeed constrains sensory representations. However, it remains unclear whether these insights generalize across the hierarchy of the human visual system, and particularly to object representations in high-level occipitotemporal cortex (OTC). To gain new empirical clarity, here we develop a family of object recognition models with parametrically varying dropout proportion $p$, which induces systematically varying dimensionality of internal responses (while controlling all other inductive biases). We find that increasing dropout produces an increasingly smooth, low-dimensional representational space. Optimal robustness to lesioning is observed at around 70% dropout, after which both accuracy and robustness decline. Representational comparison to large-scale 7T fMRI data from occipitotemporal cortex in the Natural Scenes Dataset reveals that this optimal degree of dropout is also associated with maximal emergent neural predictivity. Finally, using new techniques for achieving denoised estimates of the eigenspectrum of human fMRI responses, we compare the rate of eigenspectrum decay between model and brain feature spaces. We observe that the match between model and brain representations is associated with a common balance between efficiency and robustness in the representational space. These results suggest that varying dropout may reveal an optimal point of balance between the efficiency of high-dimensional codes and the robustness of low dimensional codes in hierarchical vision systems. | Jacob S.

| 690 |  |  [DDMI: Domain-agnostic Latent Diffusion Models for Synthesizing High-Quality Implicit Neural Representations](https://openreview.net/forum?id=327tbF3S65) |  | 0 | Recent studies have introduced a new class of generative models for synthesizing implicit neural representations (INRs) that capture arbitrary continuous signals in various domains. These models opened the door for domain-agnostic generative models, but they often fail to achieve high-quality generation. We observed that the existing methods generate the weights of neural networks to parameterize INRs and evaluate the network with fixed positional embeddings (PEs). Arguably, this architecture limits the expressive power of generative models and results in low-quality INR generation. To address this limitation, we propose Domain-agnostic Latent Diffusion Model for INRs (DDMI) that generates adaptive positional embeddings instead of neural networks' weights. Specifically, we develop a Discrete-to-continuous space Variational AutoEncoder (D2C-VAE) that seamlessly connects discrete data and continuous signal functions in the shared latent space. Additionally, we introduce a novel conditioning mechanism for evaluating INRs with the hierarchically decomposed PEs to further enhance expressive power. Extensive experiments across four modalities, \eg, 2D images, 3D shapes, Neural Radiance Fields, and videos, with seven benchmark datasets, demonstrate the versatility of DDMI and its superior performance compared to the existing INR generative models.

To address this issue we propose CORESET-PFEDBAYES : a personalized coreset weighted federated learning setup where the training updates for each individual clients are forwarded to the central server based on only individual client coreset based representative data points instead of the entire client data. Through theoretical analysis we present how the average generalization error is minimax optimal up to logarithm bounds (upper bounded by $\mathcal{O}(n_k^{-\frac{2 \beta}{2 \beta+\boldsymbol{\Lambda}}} \log ^{2 \delta^{\prime}}(n_k))$) and lower bounds of $\mathcal{O}(n_k^{-\frac{2 \beta}{2 \beta+\boldsymbol{\Lambda}}})$, and how the overall generalization error on the data likelihood differs from a vanilla Federated Learning setup as a closed form function ${\boldsymbol{\Im}}(\boldsymbol{w}, n_k)$ of the coreset weights $\boldsymbol{w}$ and coreset sample size $n_k$. Our experiments on different benchmark datasets based on a variety of recent personalized federated learning architectures show significant gains as compared to random sampling on the training data followed by federated learning, thereby indicating how intelligently selecting such training samples can help in performance. Additionally, through experiments on medical datasets our proposed method showcases some gains as compared to other submodular optimization based approaches used for subset selection on client's data. | Prateek Chanda, Shrey Modi, Ganesh Ramakrishnan |  |

ICAE is first pretrained using both autoencoding and language modeling objectives on massive text data, enabling it to generate memory slots that accurately and comprehensively represent the original context. Then, it is fine-tuned on instruction data for producing desirable responses to various prompts. Experiments demonstrate that our lightweight ICAE, introducing about 1% additional parameters, effectively achieves $4\times$ context compression based on Llama, offering advantages in both improved latency and GPU memory cost during inference, and showing an interesting insight in memorization as well as potential for scalability. These promising results imply a novel perspective on the connection between working memory in cognitive science and representation learning in LLMs, revealing ICAE's significant implications in addressing the long context problem and suggesting further research in LLM context management.

This paper addresses this issue by introducing the first large and diverse visual instruction tuning dataset, named Large-scale Robust Visual (LRV)-Instruction. Our dataset comprises 400k visual instructions generated by GPT4, covering 16 vision-and-language tasks with open-ended instructions and answers. Unlike existing studies that primarily focus on positive instruction samples, we design LRV-Instruction to include both positive and negative instructions for more robust visual instruction tuning. Our negative instructions are designed at three semantic levels: (i) Nonexistent Object Manipulation, (ii) Existent Object Manipulation and (iii) Knowledge Manipulation. To efficiently measure the hallucination generated by LMMs, we propose GPT4-Assisted Visual Instruction Evaluation (GAVIE), a stable approach to evaluate visual instruction tuning like human experts. GAVIE does not require human-annotated groundtruth answers and can adapt to diverse instruction formats. We conduct comprehensive experiments to investigate the hallucination of LMMs. Our results demonstrate existing LMMs exhibit significant hallucinations when presented with our negative instructions, particularly Existent Object and Knowledge Manipulation instructions. Moreover, we successfully mitigate hallucination by finetuning MiniGPT4 and mPLUG-Owl on LRV-Instruction while improving performance on several public datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we observed that a balanced ratio of positive and negative instances in the training data leads to a more robust model. Code and data will be released upon publication. | Fuxiao Liu, Kevin Lin, Linjie Li, Jianfeng Wang, Yaser Yacoob, Lijuan Wang |  |

The structure of this joint distribution should identify multi-way correspondences among the prescribed marginals. We formalize an approach to this task within a generalization of the stochastic interpolant framework, leading to efficient learning algorithms built upon dynamical transport of measure. Our generative models are defined by velocity and score fields that can be characterized as the minimizers of simple quadratic objectives, and they are defined on a simplex that generalizes the time variable in the usual dynamical transport framework. The resulting transport on the simplex is influenced by all marginals, and we show that multi-way correspondences can be extracted. The identification of such correspondences has applications to style transfer, algorithmic fairness, and data decorruption. In addition, the multimarginal perspective enables an efficient algorithm for optimizing the dynamical transport cost in the ordinary two-marginal setting. We demonstrate these capacities with several numerical examples. | Michael S. Albergo, Nicholas Matthew Boffi, Michael Lindsey, Eric VandenEijnden |  |

Despite reducing overfitting risks, these methods miss potential opportunities in utilizing channel dependence for accurate predictions. We argue that there exist locally stationary lead-lag relationships between variates, i.e., some lagged variates may follow the leading indicators within a short time period. Exploiting such channel dependence is beneficial since leading indicators offer advance information that can be used to reduce the forecasting difficulty of the lagged variates. In this paper, we propose a new method named LIFT that first efficiently estimates leading indicators and their leading steps at each time step and then judiciously allows the lagged variates to utilize the advance information from leading indicators. LIFT plays as a plugin that can be seamlessly collaborated with arbitrary time series forecasting methods. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that LIFT improves the state-of-the-art methods by 5.4% in average forecasting performance.

However, most existing methods retrieve only short contiguous chunks from a retrieval corpus, limiting holistic understanding of the overall document context. We introduce the novel approach of recursively embedding, clustering, and summarizing chunks of text, constructing a tree with differing levels of summarization from the bottom up. At inference time, our RAPTOR model retrieves from this tree, integrating information across lengthy documents at different levels of abstraction. Controlled experiments show that retrieval with recursive summaries offers significant improvements over traditional retrieval-augmented LMs on several tasks. On question-answering tasks that involve complex, multi-step reasoning, we show state-of-the-art results; for example, by coupling RAPTOR retrieval with the use of GPT-4, we can improve the best performance on the QuALITY benchmark by 20\% in absolute accuracy. | Parth Sarthi, Salman Abdullah, Aditi Tuli, Shubh Khanna, Anna Goldie, Christopher D.

Vertical federated learning, also known as feature-based federated learning, applies to scenarios where data sources have the same sample IDs but different feature sets. To ensure fairness among data owners, it is critical to objectively assess the contributions from different data sources and compensate the corresponding data owners accordingly. The Shapley value is a provably fair contribution valuation metric originating from cooperative game theory. However, its straight-forward computation requires extensively retraining a model on each potential combination of data sources, leading to prohibitively high communication and computation overheads due to multiple rounds of federated learning. To tackle this challenge, we propose a contribution valuation metric called vertical federated Shapley value (VerFedSV) based on the classic Shapley value. We show that VerFedSV not only satisfies many desirable properties of fairness but is also efficient to compute. Moreover, VerFedSV can be adapted to both synchronous and asynchronous vertical federated learning algorithms. Both theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results demonstrate the fairness, efficiency, adaptability, and effectiveness of VerFedSV. | Zhenan Fan, Huang Fang, Xinglu Wang, Zirui Zhou, Jian Pei, Michael P.

| 698 |  |  [In-Context Learning through the Bayesian Prism](https://openreview.net/forum?id=HX5ujdsSon) |  | 0 | In-context learning (ICL) is one of the surprising and useful features of large language models and subject of intense research. Recently, stylized meta-learning-like ICL setups have been devised that train transformers on sequences of input-output pairs $(x, f(x))$. The function $f$ comes from a function class and generalization is checked by evaluating on sequences generated from unseen functions from the same class. One of the main discoveries in this line of research has been that for several function classes, such as linear regression, transformers successfully generalize to new functions in the class. However, the inductive biases of these models resulting in this behavior are not clearly understood. A model with unlimited training data and compute is a Bayesian predictor: it learns the pretraining distribution. In this paper we empirically examine how far this Bayesian perspective can help us understand ICL. To this end, we generalize the previous meta-ICL setup to hierarchical meta-ICL setup which involve unions of multiple task families. We instantiate this setup on a diverse range of linear and nonlinear function families and find that transformers can do ICL in this setting as well. Where Bayesian inference is tractable, we find evidence that high-capacity transformers mimic the Bayesian predictor. The Bayesian perspective provides insights into the inductive bias of ICL and how transformers perform a particular task when they are trained on multiple tasks. We also find that transformers can learn to generalize to new function classes that were not seen during pretraining. This involves deviation from the Bayesian predictor. We examine these deviations in more depth offering new insights and hypotheses. | Madhur Panwar, Kabir Ahuja, Navin Goyal |  |

However, the memory demands imposed by Transformers limit their ability to handle long sequences, thereby posing challenges in utilizing videos, actions, and other long-form sequences and modalities in complex environments. We present a novel approach, Blockwise RingAttention, which leverages blockwise computation of self-attention and feedforward to distribute long sequences across multiple devices while fully overlapping the communication of key-value blocks with the computation of blockwise attention. Our approach enables training and inference of sequences that are up to device count times longer than those achievable by prior memory-efficient Transformers, without resorting to approximations or incurring additional communication and computation overheads. Extensive experiments on language modeling and reinforcement learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in allowing millions of tokens context size and improving performance. | Hao Liu, Matei Zaharia, Pieter Abbeel |  |

Prior works have achieved remarkable successes by learning from human feedback to understand and follow instructions. Nonetheless, these methods are either founded on hand-picked model generations that are favored by human annotators, rendering them inefficient in terms of data utilization and challenging to apply in general, or they depend on reinforcement learning, which often suffers from imperfect reward functions and relies on extremely challenging optimizations. In this work, we propose a novel technique, Chain of Hindsight, that is easy to optimize and can learn from any form of feedback, regardless of its polarity. Our idea is inspired by how humans learn from extensive feedback presented in the form of languages. We convert all types of feedback into sequences of sentences, which are then used to fine-tune the model, allowing us to take advantage of the language comprehension capabilities of language models. We condition the model on a sequence of model generations paired with feedback. By doing so, the model is trained to generate outputs based on feedback, while learning to identify and correct negative attributes or errors. Applying our method to large language models, we observed that Chain of Hindsight significantly surpasses previous methods in aligning language models with human preferences. We report significant improvements on summarization and dialogue benchmarks, with our approach markedly preferred in human evaluations. | Hao Liu, Carmelo Sferrazza, Pieter Abbeel |  |

GraphChef integrates decision trees into the GNN message passing framework. Given a dataset, GraphChef returns a set of rules (a recipe) that explains each class in the dataset unlike existing GNNs and explanation methods that reason on individual graphs. Thanks to the decision trees, GraphChef recipes are human understandable. We also present a new pruning method to produce small and easy to digest trees. Experiments demonstrate that GraphChef reaches comparable accuracy to not self-explainable GNNs and produced decision trees are indeed small. We further validate the correctness of the discovered recipes on datasets where explanation ground truth is available: Reddit-Binary, MUTAG, BA-2Motifs, BA-Shapes, Tree-Cycle, and Tree-Grid. | Peter Müller, Lukas Faber, Karolis Martinkus, Roger Wattenhofer |  |
| 702 |  |  [Safe Collaborative Filtering](https://openreview.net/forum?id=yarUvgEXq3) |  | 0 | Excellent tail performance is crucial for modern machine learning tasks, such as algorithmic fairness, class imbalance, and risk-sensitive decision making, as it ensures the effective handling of challenging samples within a dataset. Tail performance is also a vital determinant of success for personalized recommender systems to reduce the risk of losing users with low satisfaction. This study introduces a "safe" collaborative filtering method that prioritizes recommendation quality for less-satisfied users rather than focusing on the average performance. Our approach minimizes the conditional value at risk (CVaR), which represents the average risk over the tails of users' loss. To overcome computational challenges for web-scale recommender systems, we develop a robust yet practical algorithm that extends the most scalable method, implicit alternating least squares (iALS). Empirical evaluation on real-world datasets demonstrates the excellent tail performance of our approach while maintaining competitive computational efficiency. | Riku Togashi, Tatsushi Oka, Naoto Ohsaka, Tetsuro Morimura |  |
| 703 |  |  [On Representation Complexity of Model-based and Model-free Reinforcement Learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=3K3s9qxSn7) |  | 0 | We study the representation complexity of model-based and model-free reinforcement learning (RL) in the context of circuit complexity. We prove theoretically that there exists a broad class of MDPs such that their underlying transition and reward functions can be represented by constant depth circuits with polynomial size, while the optimal $Q$-function suffers an exponential circuit complexity in constant-depth circuits. By drawing attention to the approximation errors and building connections to complexity theory, our theory provides unique insights into why model-based algorithms usually enjoy better sample complexity than model-free algorithms from a novel representation complexity perspective: in some cases, the ground-truth rule (model) of the environment is simple to represent, while other quantities, such as $Q$-function, appear complex. We empirically corroborate our theory by comparing the approximation error of the transition kernel, reward function, and optimal $Q$-function in various Mujoco environments, which demonstrates that the approximation errors of the transition kernel and reward function are consistently lower than those of the optimal $Q$-function. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to study the circuit complexity of RL, which also provides a rigorous framework for future research. | Hanlin Zhu, Baihe Huang, Stuart Russell |  |
| 704 |  |  [Addressing Loss of Plasticity and Catastrophic Forgetting in Continual Learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=sKPzAXoylB) |  | 0 | Deep representation learning methods struggle with continual learning, suffering from both catastrophic forgetting of useful units and loss of plasticity, often due to rigid and unuseful units. While many methods address these two issues separately, only a few currently deal with both simultaneously. In this paper, we introduce Utility-based Perturbed Gradient Descent (UPGD) as a novel approach for the continual learning of representations. UPGD combines gradient updates with perturbations, where it applies smaller modifications to more useful units, protecting them from forgetting, and larger modifications to less useful units, rejuvenating their plasticity. We use a challenging streaming learning setup where continual learning problems have hundreds of non-stationarities and unknown task boundaries. We show that many existing methods suffer from at least one of the issues, predominantly manifested by their decreasing accuracy over tasks. On the other hand, UPGD continues to improve performance and surpasses or is competitive with all methods in all problems. Finally, in extended reinforcement learning experiments with PPO, we show that while Adam exhibits a performance drop after initial learning, UPGD avoids it by addressing both continual learning issues. | Mohamed Elsayed, A.

| 705 |  |  [A Good Learner can Teach Better: Teacher-Student Collaborative Knowledge Distillation](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Ixi4j6LtdX) |  | 0 | Knowledge distillation (KD) is a technique used to transfer knowledge from a larger ''teacher'' model into a smaller ''student'' model. Recent advancements in meta-learning-based knowledge distillation (MetaKD) emphasize that the fine-tuning of teacher models should be aware of the student's need to achieve better knowledge distillation. However, existing MetaKD methods often lack incentives for the teacher model to improve itself. In this study, we introduce MPDistil, a meta-policy distillation technique, that utilizes novel optimization strategies to foster both \*collaboration\* and \*competition\* during the fine-tuning of the teacher model in the meta-learning step. Additionally, we propose a curriculum learning framework for the student model in a competitive setup, in which the student model aims to outperform the teacher model by self-training on various tasks. Exhaustive experiments on SuperGLUE and GLUE benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of MPDistil compared to $20$ conventional KD and advanced MetaKD baselines, showing significant performance enhancements in the student model -- e.g., a distilled 6-layer BERT model outperforms a 12-layer BERT model on five out of six SuperGLUE tasks. Furthermore, MPDistil, while applied to a large language teacher model (DeBERTa-v2-xxlarge), significantly narrows the performance gap of its smaller student counterpart (DeBERTa-12) by just $4.6$% on SuperGLUE. We further demonstrate how higher rewards and customized training curricula strengthen the student model and enhance generalizability. | Ayan Sengupta, Shantanu Dixit, Md.

Model interpretability is crucial, especially in high-stakes domains like medicine, to establish trust and ensure safety, which requires human engagement. We introduce SUFO, a systematic framework that enhances interpretability of fine-tuned transformer feature spaces. SUFO utilizes a range of analytic and visualization techniques, including Supervised probing, Unsupervised similarity analysis, Feature dynamics, and Outlier analysis to address key questions about model trust and interpretability (e.g. model suitability for a task, feature space evolution during fine-tuning, and interpretation of fine-tuned features and failure modes). We conduct a case study investigating the impact of pre-training data where we focus on real-world pathology classification tasks, and validate our findings on MedNLI. We evaluate five 110M-sized pre-trained transformer models, categorized into general-domain (BERT, TNLR), mixed-domain (BioBERT, Clinical BioBERT), and domain-specific (PubMedBERT) groups. Our SUFO analyses reveal that: (1) while PubMedBERT, the domain-specific model, contains valuable information for fine-tuning, it can overfit to minority classes when class imbalances exist. In contrast, mixed-domain models exhibit greater resistance to overfitting, suggesting potential improvements in domain-specific model robustness; (2) in-domain pre-training accelerates feature disambiguation during fine-tuning; and (3) feature spaces undergo significant sparsification during this process, enabling clinicians to identify common outlier modes among fine-tuned models as demonstrated in this paper. These findings showcase the utility of SUFO in enhancing trust and safety when using transformers in medicine, and we believe SUFO can aid practitioners in evaluating fine-tuned language models (LMs) for other applications in medicine and in more critical domains. | Aliyah R.

| 707 |  |  [Mechanistically analyzing the effects of fine-tuning on procedurally defined tasks](https://openreview.net/forum?id=A0HKeKl4Nl) |  | 0 | Fine-tuning large pre-trained models has become the de facto strategy for developing both task-specific and general-purpose machine learning systems, including developing models that are safe to deploy. Despite its clear importance, there has been minimal work that explains how fine-tuning alters the underlying capabilities learned by a model during pretraining: does fine-tuning yield entirely novel capabilities or does it just modulate existing ones? We address this question empirically in synthetic, controlled settings where we can use mechanistic interpretability tools (e.g., network pruning and probing) to understand how the model's underlying capabilities are changing. We perform an extensive analysis of the effects of fine-tuning in these settings, and show that: (i) fine-tuning rarely alters the underlying model capabilities; (ii) a minimal transformation, which we call a \`wrapper', is typically learned on top of the underlying model capabilities, creating the illusion that they have been modified; and (iii) further fine-tuning on a task where such \`\`wrapped capabilities'' are relevant leads to sample-efficient revival of the capability, i.e., the model begins reusing these capabilities after only a few gradient steps. This indicates that practitioners can unintentionally remove a model's safety wrapper merely by fine-tuning it on a, e.g., superficially unrelated, downstream task. We additionally perform analysis on language models trained on the TinyStories dataset to support our claims in a more realistic setup. | Samyak Jain, Robert Kirk, Ekdeep Singh Lubana, Robert P.

However, current benchmarks mainly focus on single-file tasks, leaving an assessment gap for more complex, real-world, multi-file programming scenarios. To fill this gap, we introduce RepoBench, a new benchmark specifically designed for evaluating repository-level code auto-completion systems. RepoBench consists of three interconnected evaluation tasks: RepoBench-R (Retrieval), RepoBench-C (Code Completion), and RepoBench-P (Pipeline). Each task respectively measures the system's ability to retrieve the most relevant code snippets from other files as cross-file context, predict the next line of code with cross-file and in-file context, and handle complex tasks that require a combination of both retrieval and next-line prediction. RepoBench aims to facilitate a more complete comparison of performance and encouraging continuous improvement in auto-completion systems. RepoBench is actively maintained with the latest code, serving as a live benchmark publicly available at https://github.com/Leolty/repobench. | Tianyang Liu, Canwen Xu, Julian J. McAuley |  |

While prior research has delved into operations on these parameters to manipulate the underlying implicit knowledge — encompassing detection, editing, and merging — there remains an ambiguous understanding regarding their transferability across models with varying scales. In this paper, we seek to empirically investigate knowledge transfer from larger to smaller models through a parametric perspective. To achieve this, we employ sensitivity-based techniques to extract and align knowledge-specific parameters between different LLMs. Moreover, the LoRA module is used as the intermediary mechanism for injecting the extracted knowledge into smaller models. Evaluations across four benchmarks validate the efficacy of our proposed method. Our findings highlight the critical factors contributing to the process of parametric knowledge transfer, underscoring the transferability of model parameters across LLMs of different scales.

A typical example of a TAG is a paper citation graph, where the text of each paper serves as node attributes. Initial graph neural network (GNN) pipelines handled these text attributes by transforming them into shallow or hand-crafted features, such as skip-gram or bag-of-words features. Recent efforts have focused on enhancing these pipelines with language models (LMs), which typically demand intricate designs and substantial computational resources. With the advent of powerful large language models (LLMs) such as GPT or Llama2, which demonstrate an ability to reason and to utilize general knowledge, there is a growing need for techniques which combine the textual modelling abilities of LLMs with the structural learning capabilities of GNNs. Hence, in this work, we focus on leveraging LLMs to capture textual information as features, which can be used to boost GNN performance on downstream tasks. A key innovation is our use of \emph{explanations as features}: we prompt an LLM to perform zero-shot classification, request textual explanations for its decision-making process, and design an \emph{LLM-to-LM interpreter} to translate these explanations into informative features for downstream GNNs. Our experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on well-established TAG datasets, including \texttt{Cora}, \texttt{PubMed}, \texttt{ogbn-arxiv}, as well as our newly introduced dataset, \texttt{tape-arxiv23}. Furthermore, our method significantly speeds up training, achieving a 2.88 times improvement over the closest baseline on \texttt{ogbn-arxiv}. Lastly, we believe the versatility of the proposed method extends beyond TAGs and holds the potential to enhance other tasks involving graph-text data~\footnote{Our codes and datasets are available at: \url{https://github.com/XiaoxinHe/TAPE}}. | Xiaoxin He, Xavier Bresson, Thomas Laurent, Adam Perold, Yann LeCun, Bryan Hooi |  |

While incorporating new information with the retrieval of relevant passages is a promising way to improve QA with LLMs, the existing methods often require additional fine-tuning which becomes infeasible with recent LLMs. Augmenting retrieved passages via prompting has the potential to address this limitation, but this direction has been limitedly explored. To this end, we design a simple yet effective framework to enhance open-domain QA (ODQA) with LLMs, based on the summarized retrieval (SuRe). SuRe helps LLMs predict more accurate answers for a given question, which are well-supported by the summarized retrieval that could be viewed as an explicit rationale extracted from the retrieved passages. Specifically, SuRe first constructs summaries of the retrieved passages for each of the multiple answer candidates. Then, SuRe confirms the most plausible answer from the candidate set by evaluating the validity and ranking of the generated summaries. Experimental results on diverse ODQA benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of SuRe, with improvements of up to 4.6\% in exact match (EM) and 4.0\% in F1 score over standard prompting approaches. SuRe also can be integrated with a broad range of retrieval methods and LLMs. Finally, the generated summaries from SuRe show additional advantages to measure the importance of retrieved passages and serve as more preferred rationales by models and humans. | Jaehyung Kim, Jaehyun Nam, Sangwoo Mo, Jongjin Park, SangWoo Lee, Minjoon Seo, JungWoo Ha, Jinwoo Shin |  |

The natural questions are: i) Retrieval-augmentation versus long context window, which one is better for downstream tasks? ii) Can both methods be combined to get the best of both worlds? In this work, we answer these questions by studying both solutions using two state-of-the-art pretrained LLMs, i.e., a proprietary 43B GPT and Llama2-70B. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that LLM with 4K context window using simple retrieval-augmentation at generation can achieve comparable performance to finetuned LLM with 16K context window via positional interpolation on long context tasks, while taking much less computation. More importantly, we demonstrate that retrieval can significantly improve the performance of LLMs regardless of their extended context window sizes. Our best model, retrieval-augmented Llama2-70B with 32K context window, outperforms GPT-3.5-turbo-16k and Davinci003 in terms of average score on nine long context tasks including question answering, query-based summarization, and in-context few-shot learning tasks. It also outperforms its non-retrieval Llama2-70B-32k baseline by a margin, while being much faster at generation. Our study provides general insights on the choice of retrieval-augmentation versus long context extension of LLM for practitioners. | Peng Xu, Wei Ping, Xianchao Wu, Lawrence McAfee, Chen Zhu, Zihan Liu, Sandeep Subramanian, Evelina Bakhturina, Mohammad Shoeybi, Bryan Catanzaro |  |

Our method uses orthogonal bases to learn PDE solutions as mappings between spectral coefficients, instantiating a spectral-based neural operator. In contrast to current machine learning approaches which enforce PDE constraints by minimizing the numerical quadrature of the residuals in the spatiotemporal domain, we leverage Parseval's identity and introduce a new training strategy through a spectral loss. Our spectral loss enables more efficient differentiation through the neural network, and substantially reduces training complexity. At inference time, the computational cost of our method remains constant, regardless of the spatiotemporal resolution of the domain. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous machine learning approaches in terms of speed and accuracy by one to two orders of magnitude on multiple different problems, including reaction-diffusion, and forced and unforced Navier-Stokes equations. When compared to numerical solvers of the same accuracy, our method demonstrates a $10\times$ increase in performance speed.

However, current methods still fall short in diverse application scenarios, as they require test-time tuning and cannot accept interleaved multi-image and text input. These limitations keep them far from the ultimate goal of "image as a foreign language in image generation." This paper presents Kosmos-G, a model that leverages the advanced multimodal perception capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to tackle the aforementioned challenge. Our approach aligns the output space of MLLM with CLIP using the textual modality as an anchor and performs compositional instruction tuning on curated data. Kosmos-G demonstrates an impressive capability of zero-shot subject-driven generation with interleaved multi-image and text input. Notably, the score distillation instruction tuning requires no modifications to the image decoder. This allows for a seamless substitution of CLIP and effortless integration with a myriad of U-Net techniques ranging from fine-grained controls to personalized image decoder variants. We posit Kosmos-G as an initial attempt towards the goal of "image as a foreign language in image generation." | Xichen Pan, Li Dong, Shaohan Huang, Zhiliang Peng, Wenhu Chen, Furu Wei |  |

In order to draw reliable conclusions based on empirical ROC analysis, accurately evaluating the uncertainty level related to statistical versions of the ROC curves of interest is absolutely necessary, especially for applications with considerable societal impact such as Face Recognition. In this article, we prove asymptotic guarantees for empirical ROC curves of similarity functions as well as for by-product metrics useful to assess fairness. We also explain that, because the false acceptance/rejection rates are of the form of U-statistics in the case of similarity scoring, the naive bootstrap approach may jeopardize the assessment procedure. A dedicated recentering technique must be used instead. Beyond the theoretical analysis carried out, various experiments using real face image datasets provide strong empirical evidence of the practical relevance of the methods promoted here, when applied to several ROC-based measures such as popular fairness metrics. | JeanRémy Conti, Stéphan Clémençon |  |

Calibrating language models (LMs) is crucial, as it plays a vital role in detecting and mitigating hallucinations of LMs as well as building more trustworthy models. However, standard calibration techniques may not be suited for LM calibration. For instance, post-processing methods such as temperature scaling do not reorder the candidate generations. On the other hand, training-based methods require fine-tuning the entire model, which is impractical for LMs of large scale. We present LitCab, a lightweight calibration mechanism consisting of a single linear layer that takes the input text representation and predicts a bias term, which is then added to the LM output logits. LitCab improves model calibration by only adding < 2% of the original model parameters. For evaluation, we construct CaT, a benchmark consisting of eight text generation tasks, covering responses ranging from short phrases to paragraphs. We test LitCab with Llama2-7B, where it improves calibration across all tasks, reducing the average ECE score by as large as 30%. We further conduct a comprehensive evaluation with multiple popular open-sourced LMs from GPT and LLaMA families, yielding the following key findings: (i) Larger models within the same family exhibit better calibration on tasks with short generation tasks, but not necessarily for longer ones. (ii) GPT-family models show superior calibration compared to LLaMA, Llama2, and Vicuna models, despite having much fewer parameters. (iii) Fine-tuning pretrained model (e.g., LLaMA) with samples of limited purpose (e.g., conversations) may lead to worse calibration, highlighting the importance of fine-tuning setups for calibrating LMs. | Xin Liu, Muhammad Khalifa, Lu Wang |  |

It results in more factual rationales and reduced hallucination in generation. Specifically, CoK consists of three stages: reasoning preparation, dynamic knowledge adapting, and answer consolidation. Given a knowledge-intensive question, CoK first prepares several preliminary rationales and answers while identifying the relevant knowledge domains. If there is no majority consensus among the answers from samples, CoK corrects the rationales step by step by adapting knowledge from the identified domains. These corrected rationales can plausibly serve as a better foundation for the final answer consolidation. Unlike prior studies that primarily use unstructured data, CoK also leverages structured knowledge sources such as Wikidata and tables that provide more reliable factual information. To access both unstructured and structured knowledge sources in the dynamic knowledge adapting stage, we propose an adaptive query generator that allows the generation of queries for various types of query languages, including SPARQL, SQL, and natural sentences. Moreover, to minimize error propagation between rationales, CoK corrects the rationales progressively using preceding corrected rationales to generate and correct subsequent rationales. Extensive experiments show that CoK consistently improves the performance of LLMs on knowledge-intensive tasks across different domains. | Xingxuan Li, Ruochen Zhao, Yew Ken Chia, Bosheng Ding, Shafiq Joty, Soujanya Poria, Lidong Bing |  |

Meanwhile, current reinforcement learning methods commonly rely on numerous environment interactions but hardly obtain generalizable policies. In this paper, we introduce the idea of \textit{rehearsal} into policy optimization, where the agent plans for all possible outcomes in mind and acts adaptively according to actual responses from the environment. To effectively rehearse, we propose ReDM, an algorithm that generates a diverse and eligible set of dynamics models and then rehearse the policy via adaptive training on the generated model set. Rehearsal enables the policy to make decision plans for various hypothetical dynamics and to naturally generalize to previously unseen environments. Our experimental results demonstrate that ReDM is capable of learning a valid policy solely through rehearsal, even with \emph{zero} interaction data. We further extend ReDM to scenarios where limited or mismatched interaction data is available, and our experimental results reveal that ReDM produces high-performing policies compared to other offline RL baselines. | Chengxing Jia, Chenxiao Gao, Hao Yin, Fuxiang Zhang, XiongHui Chen, Tian Xu, Lei Yuan, Zongzhang Zhang, ZhiHua Zhou, Yang Yu |  |

The Automated Model Evaluation (AutoEval) shows an alternative to this traditional workflow, by forming a proximal prediction pipeline of the testing performance without the presence of ground-truth labels. Despite its recent successes, the AutoEval frameworks still suffer from an overconfidence issue, substantial storage and computational cost. In that regard, we propose a novel measure --- Meta-Distribution Energy (MDE) that allows the AutoEval framework to be both more efficient and effective. The core of the MDE is to establish a meta-distribution statistic, on the information (energy) associated with individual samples, then offer a smoother representation enabled by energy-based learning. We further provide our theoretical insights by connecting the MDE with the classification loss. We provide extensive experiments across modalities, datasets and different architectural backbones to validate MDE's validity, together with its superiority compared with prior approaches. We also prove MDE's versatility by showing its seamless integration with large-scale models, and easy adaption to learning scenarios with noisy- or imbalanced- labels. | Ru Peng, Heming Zou, Haobo Wang, Yawen Zeng, Zenan Huang, Junbo Zhao |  |

We answer this question via a bi-level optimization problem and propose a meta learning-based framework named FATE. FATE is broadly applicable with respect to various fairness definitions and graph learning models, as well as arbitrary choices of manipulation operations. We further instantiate FATE to attack statistical parity or individual fairness on graph neural networks. We conduct extensive experimental evaluations on real-world datasets in the task of semi-supervised node classification. The experimental results demonstrate that FATE could amplify the bias of graph neural networks with or without fairness consideration while maintaining the utility on the downstream task. We hope this paper provides insights into the adversarial robustness of fair graph learning and can shed light on designing robust and fair graph learning in future studies. | Jian Kang, Yinglong Xia, Ross Maciejewski, Jiebo Luo, Hanghang Tong |  |

Towards Visual Representation Alignment for Robot Learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=CTlUHIKF71) |  | 0 | When operating in service of people, robots need to optimize rewards aligned with end-user preferences. Since robots will rely on raw perceptual inputs, their rewards will inevitably use visual representations. Recently there has been excitement in using representations from pre-trained visual models, but key to making these work in robotics is fine-tuning, which is typically done via proxy tasks like dynamics prediction or enforcing temporal cycle-consistency. However, all these proxy tasks bypass the human’s input on what matters to them, exacerbating spurious correlations and ultimately leading to behaviors that are misaligned with user preferences. In this work, we propose that robots should leverage human feedback to align their visual representations with the end-user and disentangle what matters for the task. We propose Representation-Aligned Preference-based Learning (RAPL), a method for solving the visual representation alignment problem and visual reward learning problem through the lens of preference-based learning and optimal transport. Across experiments in X MAGICAL and in robotic manipulation, we find that RAPL’s reward consistently generates preferred robot behaviors with high sample efficiency, and shows strong zero-shot generalization when the visual representation is learned from a different embodiment than the robot’s. | Thomas Tian, Chenfeng Xu, Masayoshi Tomizuka, Jitendra Malik, Andrea Bajcsy |  |

The FedAvg algorithm is one of the most widely used methods in FL. In FedAvg, the learning rate is a constant rather than changing adaptively. Adaptive gradient methods have demonstrated superior performance over the constant learning rate schedules in non-distributed settings, and they have recently been adapted to FL. However, the majority of these methods are designed for unconstrained settings. Meanwhile, many crucial FL applications, like disease diagnosis and biomarker identification, often rely on constrained formulations such as Lasso and group Lasso. It remains an open question as to whether adaptive gradient methods can be effectively applied to FL problems with constrains. In this work, we introduce \textbf{FedDA}, a novel adaptive gradient framework for FL. This framework utilizes a restarted dual averaging technique and is compatible with a range of gradient estimation methods and adaptive learning rate schedules. Specifically, an instantiation of our framework FedDA-MVR achieves sample complexity $\tilde{O}(K^{-1}\epsilon^{-1.5})$ and communication complexity $\tilde{O}(K^{-0.25}\epsilon^{-1.25})$ for finding a stationary point $\epsilon$ in the constrained setting with $K$ be the number of clients. We conduct experiments over both constrained and unconstrained tasks to confirm the effectiveness of our approach. | Junyi Li, Feihu Huang, Heng Huang |  |

It is crucial to understand how to harness the unique computational power of nature in Machine Learning (ML). In the past decade, besides the development of Neural Networks (NNs), the community has also relentlessly explored nature-powered ML paradigms. Although most of them are still predominantly theoretical, a new practical paradigm enabled by the recent advent of CMOS-compatible room-temperature nature-based computers has emerged. By harnessing a dynamical system's intrinsic behavior of chasing the lowest energy state, this paradigm can solve some simple binary problems delivering considerable speedup and energy savings compared with NNs, while maintaining comparable accuracy. Regrettably, its values to the real world are highly constrained by its binary nature. A clear pathway to its extension to real-valued problems remains elusive. This paper aims to unleash this pathway by proposing a novel end-to-end Nature-Powered Graph Learning (NP-GL) framework. Specifically, through a three-dimensional co-design, NP-GL can leverage the spontaneous energy decrease in nature to efficiently solve real-valued graph learning problems. Experimental results across 4 real-world applications with 6 datasets demonstrate that NP-GL delivers, on average, $6.97\times 10^3$ speedup and $10^5$ energy consumption reduction with comparable or even higher accuracy than Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). | Chunshu Wu, Ruibing Song, Chuan Liu, Yunan Yang, Ang Li, Michael C.

Nevertheless, existing works on BO of risk measures start the optimization from scratch for every new task without considering the results of prior tasks. In contrast, its vanilla BO counterpart has received a thorough investigation on utilizing prior tasks to speed up the current task through the body of works on meta-BO which, however, have not considered risk measures. To bridge this gap, this paper presents the first algorithm for meta-BO of risk measures (i.e., value-at-risk (VaR) and the conditional VaR), namely meta-VBO, by introducing a novel adjustment to the upper confidence bound acquisition function. Our proposed algorithm exhibits two desirable properties: (i) invariance to scaling and vertical shifting of the blackbox function and (ii) robustness to prior harmful tasks. We provide a theoretical performance guarantee for our algorithm and empirically demonstrate its performance using several synthetic function benchmarks and real-world objective functions. | Quoc Phong Nguyen, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low, Patrick Jaillet |  |

Being able to discover the data examples that are the most likely culprits is a fundamental concern that has received a lot of attention recently. One prominent way to measure "data importance" with respect to model quality is the Shapley value. Unfortunately, existing methods only focus on the ML model in isolation, without considering the broader ML pipeline for data preparation and feature extraction, which appears in the majority of real-world ML code. This presents a major limitation to applying existing methods in practical settings. In this paper, we propose Datascope, a method for efficiently computing Shapley-based data importance over ML pipelines. We introduce several approximations that lead to dramatic improvements in terms of computational speed. Finally, our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our methods are capable of data error discovery that is as effective as existing Monte Carlo baselines, and in some cases even outperform them. We release our code as an open-source data debugging library available at https://github.com/easeml/datascope. | Bojan Karlas, David Dao, Matteo Interlandi, Sebastian Schelter, Wentao Wu, Ce Zhang |  |

While offline RL with linear function approximation has been extensively studied with optimal results achieved under certain assumptions, many works shift their interest to offline RL with non-linear function approximation. However, limited works on offline RL with non-linear function approximation have instance-dependent regret guarantees. In this paper, we propose an oracle-efficient algorithm, dubbed Pessimistic Nonlinear Least-Square Value Iteration (PNLSVI), for offline RL with non-linear function approximation. Our algorithmic design comprises three innovative components: (1) a variance-based weighted regression scheme that can be applied to a wide range of function classes, (2) a subroutine for variance estimation, and (3) a planning phase that utilizes a pessimistic value iteration approach. Our algorithm enjoys a regret bound that has a tight dependency on the function class complexity and achieves minimax optimal instance-dependent regret when specialized to linear function approximation. Our work extends the previous instance-dependent results within simpler function classes, such as linear and differentiable function to a more general framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first statistically optimal algorithm for nonlinear offline RL. | Qiwei Di, Heyang Zhao, Jiafan He, Quanquan Gu |  |

Arguably, a key ability of an AI agent is to flexibly combine, as needed, the basic skills it has learned. The capability to combine skills plays an important role in (human) pedagogy and also in a paper on emergence phenomena (Arora & Goyal, 2023). This work introduces SKILL-MIX, a new evaluation to measure ability to combine skills. Using a list of $N$ skills the evaluator repeatedly picks random subsets of $k$ skills and asks the LLM to produce text combining that subset of skills. Since the number of subsets grows like $N^k$, for even modest $k$ this evaluation will, with high probability, require the LLM to produce text significantly different from any text in the training set. The paper develops a methodology for (a) designing and administering such an evaluation, and (b) automatic grading (plus spot-checking by humans) of the results using GPT-4 as well as the open LLaMA-2 70B model. Administering a version of SKILL-MIX to popular chatbots gave results that, while generally in line with prior expectations, contained surprises. Sizeable differences exist among model capabilities that are not captured by their ranking on popular LLM leaderboards ("cramming for the leaderboard"). Furthermore, simple probability calculations indicate that GPT-4's reasonable performance on $k=5$ is suggestive of going beyond "stochastic parrot" behavior (Bender et al., 2021), i.e., it combines skills in ways that it had not seen during training. We sketch how the methodology can lead to a SKILL-MIX based eco-system of open evaluations for AI capabilities of future models. We maintain a leaderboard of SKILL-MIX at [https://skill-mix.github.io](https://skill-mix.github.io). | Dingli Yu, Simran Kaur, Arushi Gupta, Jonah BrownCohen, Anirudh Goyal, Sanjeev Arora |  |
| 728 |  |  [A Quadratic Synchronization Rule for Distributed Deep Learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=yroyhkhWS6) |  | 0 | In distributed deep learning with data parallelism, synchronizing gradients at each training step can cause a huge communication overhead, especially when many nodes work together to train large models. Local gradient methods, such as Local SGD, address this issue by allowing workers to compute locally for $H$ steps without synchronizing with others, hence reducing communication frequency. While $H$ has been viewed as a hyperparameter to trade optimization efficiency for communication cost, recent research indicates that setting a proper $H$ value can lead to generalization improvement. Yet, selecting a proper $H$ is elusive. This work proposes a theory-grounded method for determining $H$, named the Quadratic Synchronization Rule (QSR), which recommends dynamically setting $H$ in proportion to $\frac{1}{\eta^2}$ as the learning rate $\eta$ decays over time. Extensive ImageNet experiments on ResNet and ViT show that local gradient methods with QSR consistently improve the test accuracy over other synchronization strategies. Compared to the standard data parallel training, QSR enables Local AdamW to cut the training time on 16 or 64 GPUs down from 26.7 to 20.2 hours or from 8.6 to 5.5 hours and, at the same time, achieves 1.16% or 0.84% higher top-1 validation accuracy. | Xinran Gu, Kaifeng Lyu, Sanjeev Arora, Jingzhao Zhang, Longbo Huang |  |

Current defense strategies mainly address this vulnerability at the model parameter level, leaving the potential of architectural-level defense largely unexplored. This paper, for the first time, addresses the issue of model protection by reducing transferability at the architecture level. Specifically, we present a novel neural architecture search (NAS)-enabled algorithm that employs zero-cost proxies and evolutionary search, to explore model architectures with low transferability. Our method, namely ArchLock, aims to achieve high performance on the source task, while degrading the performance on potential target tasks, i.e., locking the transferability of a DNN model. To achieve efficient cross-task search without accurately knowing the training data owned by the attackers, we utilize zero-cost proxies to speed up architecture evaluation and simulate potential target task embeddings to assist cross-task search with a binary performance predictor. Extensive experiments on NAS-Bench-201 and TransNAS-Bench-101 demonstrate that ArchLock reduces transferability by up to 30% and 50%, respectively, with negligible performance degradation on source tasks (<2%).

However, RLHF is an unstable and data-hungry process that continually requires new high-quality LM-generated data for finetuning. We introduce Advantage-Leftover Lunch RL (A-LoL), a new class of offline policy gradient algorithms that enable RL training on any pre-existing data. By assuming the entire LM output sequence as a single action, A-LoL allows incorporating sequence-level classifiers or human-designed scoring functions as rewards. Subsequently, by using LM’s value estimate, A-LoL only trains on positive advantage (leftover) data points, making it resilient to noise. Overall, A-LoL is an easy-to-implement, sample-efficient, and stable LM training recipe. We demonstrate the effectiveness of A-LoL and its variants with a set of four different language generation tasks. We compare against both online RL (PPO) and recent preference-based (DPO, PRO) and reward-based (GOLD) offline RL baselines. On the commonly-used RLHF benchmark, Helpful and Harmless Assistant (HHA), LMs trained with A-LoL methods achieve the highest diversity while also being rated more safe and helpful than the baselines according to humans. Additionally, in the remaining three tasks, A-LoL could optimize multiple distinct reward functions even when using noisy or suboptimal training data. | Ashutosh Baheti, Ximing Lu, Faeze Brahman, Ronan Le Bras, Maarten Sap, Mark O.

However, these documents, often spanning hundreds of words, make inference substantially less efficient. We propose compressing the retrieved documents into textual summaries prior to in-context integration. This not only reduces the computational costs but also relieve the burden of LMs to identify relevant information in long retrieved documents. We present two compressors -- an extractive compressor which selects useful sentences from retrieved documents and an abstractive compressor which generates summary by synthesizing information from multiple documents. Both are trained to achieve performance gain in LMs when we prepend the generated summary from the compressor to LMs' input, while minimizing the summary length. When retrieved documents are irrelevant to the input or offer no additional information to LM, our compressors output an empty string, enabling selective augmentation. We evaluate our approach on the language modeling task and open domain question answering task. We achieve a compression rate of as low as 6% with minimal loss in performance for both tasks, significantly outperforming the off-the-shelf summarization models. We show that our compressors trained for one LM can transfer to other LMs on the language modeling task and provide a summary largely faithful to the retrieved documents. | Fangyuan Xu, Weijia Shi, Eunsol Choi |  |

To address these issues, we propose Gen-Z—a generative prompting framework for zero-shot text classification. GEN-Z is generative, as it measures the LM likelihood of input text, conditioned on natural language descriptions of labels. The framework is multivariate, as label descriptions allow us to seamlessly integrate additional contextual information about the labels to improve task performance. On various standard classification benchmarks, with six open-source LM families, we show that zero-shot classification with simple contextualization of the data source of the evaluation set consistently outperforms both zero-shot and few-shot baselines while improving robustness to prompt variations. Further, our approach enables personalizing classification in a zero-shot manner by incorporating author, subject, or reader information in the label descriptions. | Sachin Kumar, Chan Young Park, Yulia Tsvetkov |  |

The precise nature of LLM capabilities is often mysterious, and different prompts can elicit different capabilities through in-context learning. We propose a framework that enables us to analyze in-context learning dynamics to understand latent concepts underlying LLMs’ behavioral patterns. This provides a more nuanced understanding than success-or-failure evaluation benchmarks, but does not require observing internal activations as a mechanistic interpretation of circuits would. Inspired by the cognitive science of human randomness perception, we use random binary sequences as context and study dynamics of in-context learning by manipulating properties of context data, such as sequence length. In the latest GPT-3.5+ models, we find emergent abilities to generate seemingly random numbers and learn basic formal languages, with striking in-context learning dynamics where model outputs transition sharply from seemingly random behaviors to deterministic repetition. | Eric J.

(2022) highlighted a surprising "grokking" phenomenon in learning arithmetic tasks: a neural net first "memorizes" the training set, resulting in perfect training accuracy but near-random test accuracy, and after training for sufficiently longer, it suddenly transitions to perfect test accuracy. This paper studies the grokking phenomenon in theoretical setups and shows that it can be induced by a dichotomy of early and late phase implicit biases. Specifically, when training homogeneous neural nets with large initialization and small weight decay on both classification and regression tasks, we prove that the training process gets trapped at a solution corresponding to a kernel predictor for a long time, and then a very sharp transition to min-norm/max-margin predictors occurs, leading to a dramatic change in test accuracy. | Kaifeng Lyu, Jikai Jin, Zhiyuan Li, Simon Shaolei Du, Jason D.

Many previous studies have focused on addressing selection bias to achieve unbiased learning of the prediction model, but ignore the fact that potential outcomes for a given user-item pair may vary with the treatments assigned to other user-item pairs, named neighborhood effect. To fill the gap, this paper formally formulates the neighborhood effect as an interference problem from the perspective of causal inference, and introduces a treatment representation to capture the neighborhood effect. On this basis, we propose a novel ideal loss that can be used to deal with selection bias in the presence of neighborhood effect. We further develop two new estimators for estimating the proposed ideal loss. We theoretically establish the connection between the proposed and previous debiasing methods ignoring the neighborhood effect, showing that the proposed methods can achieve unbiased learning when both selection bias and neighborhood effects are present, while the existing methods are biased. Extensive semi-synthetic and real-world experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. | Haoxuan Li, Chunyuan Zheng, Sihao Ding, Peng Wu, Zhi Geng, Fuli Feng, Xiangnan He |  |

Existing prompt optimization techniques, though automated through iterative sampling, often fall short in injecting domain knowledge and exploring the vast prompt space for complex expert-level prompts efficiently. To address this pressing need and achieve expert-level prompting, we introduce PromptAgent, which autonomously discovers prompts equivalent in quality to those handcrafted by experts. At its core, PromptAgent views prompt optimization as a strategic planning problem and employs a principled planning algorithm (rooted in Monte Carlo Tree Search) to strategically explore the vast expert-level prompt space. PromptAgent interacts with the LLM in a human-like trial-and-error manner during the planning, and injects expert-level knowledge by reflecting on model errors and generating insightful error feedback. This novel formulation allows it to iteratively evaluate intermediate prompts, refine them based on errors, simulate future rewards, and search for high-reward paths leading to expert-level prompts. We apply PromptAgent to 12 tasks spanning three practical domains: BIG-Bench Hard (BBH), domain-expert, and general NLU tasks, showing PromptAgent consistently outperforms strong prompting and prompt optimization baselines by great margins. Our qualitative analysis further emphasizes PromptAgent's capability to distill insightful errors into expert-level prompts. | Xinyuan Wang, Chenxi Li, Zhen Wang, Fan Bai, Haotian Luo, Jiayou Zhang, Nebojsa Jojic, Eric P.

Behind this success are rigorously designed, yet expensive, strategies for identifying the most informative training examples out of large datasets. In this work, we revisit these methods to understand if the additional computational costs associated with such strategies are justified from the perspective of time-to-accuracy, which has become a critical efficiency measure of deep neural network training over large datasets. Surprisingly, we find that many of the recently proposed methods underperform what we call Repeated Sampling of Random Subsets (RSRS or RS2), a powerful yet overlooked extension of the standard random baseline that learns from repeatedly sampled data throughout training instead of a fixed random subset. We test RS2 against thirty-two state-of-the-art data pruning and distillation methods across four datasets including ImageNet. Our results demonstrate that RS2 significantly reduces time-to-accuracy, particularly in practical regimes where accuracy, but not runtime, is similar to that of training on full dataset. For example, when training ResNet-18 on ImageNet, with 10\% of the dataset each epoch RS2 reaches an accuracy of 66\% versus 69\% when training with the full dataset. The best competing method achieves only 55\% while training 1.6$\times$ slower than RS2. Beyond the above meta-study, we discuss the theoretical properties of RS2 such as its convergence rate and generalization error. Our primary goal is to highlight that future works that aim to minimize total training cost by using subset selection, need to consider 1) the total computation cost (including preparing the subset) and 2) should aim to outperform a simple extension of random sampling (i.e., RS2). | Patrik Okanovic, Roger Waleffe, Vasilis Mageirakos, Konstantinos E.

Explain the Theory of Relativity._’ While this ability allows personalization of LLMs and enables human behavior simulation, its effect on LLMs’ capabilities remains unclear. To fill this gap, we present the first extensive study of the unintended side-effects of persona assignment on the ability of LLMs to perform _basic reasoning tasks_. Our study covers 24 reasoning datasets (spanning mathematics, law, medicine, morals, and more), 4 LLMs (2 versions of ChatGPT-3.5, GPT-4-Turbo, and Llama-2-70b-chat), and 19 diverse personas (e.g., ‘an Asian person’) spanning 5 socio-demographic groups: race, gender, religion, disability, and political affiliation. Our experiments unveil that LLMs harbor deep rooted bias against various socio-demographics underneath a veneer of fairness. While they overtly reject stereotypes when explicitly asked (‘_Are Black people less skilled at mathematics?_’), they manifest stereotypical and often erroneous presumptions when prompted to answer questions while adopting a persona. These can be observed as abstentions in the model’s response, e.g., ‘_As a Black person, I am unable to answer this question as it requires math knowledge_’, and generally result in a substantial drop in performance on reasoning tasks. Our experiments with ChatGPT-3.5 show that this bias is _ubiquitous_&mdash;80% of our personas demonstrate bias; it is _significant_&mdash;some datasets show performance drops of 70%+; and can be especially _harmful for certain groups_&mdash;some personas suffer statistically significant drops on 80%+ of the datasets. Overall, all four LLMs exhibit persona-induced bias to varying extents, with GPT-4-Turbo showing the least but still a problematic amount of bias (evident in 42% of the personas). Further analysis shows that these persona-induced errors can be hard-to-discern as they do not always manifest as explicit abstentions, and can also be hard-to-avoid&mdash;we find de-biasing prompts to have minimal to no effect. Our findings serve as a cautionary tale that the practice of assigning personas to LLMs&mdash;a trend on the rise&mdash;can surface their deep-rooted biases and have unforeseeable and detrimental side-effects. | Shashank Gupta, Vaishnavi Shrivastava, Ameet Deshpande, Ashwin Kalyan, Peter Clark, Ashish Sabharwal, Tushar Khot |  |

However, set-level coarse-grained labels that capture relationships among instances can provide richer information in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present a novel approach to enhance instance-level image classification by leveraging set-level labels. We provide a theoretical analysis of the proposed method, including recognition conditions for fast excess risk rate, shedding light on the theoretical foundations of our approach. We conducted experiments on two distinct categories of datasets: natural image datasets and histopathology image datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing improved classification performance compared to traditional single-instance label-based methods. Notably, our algorithm achieves 13\% improvement in classification accuracy compared to the strongest baseline on the histopathology image classification benchmarks. Importantly, our experimental findings align with the theoretical analysis, reinforcing the robustness and reliability of our proposed method. This work bridges the gap between instance-level and set-level image classification, offering a promising avenue for advancing the capabilities of image classification models with set-level coarse-grained labels. | Renyu Zhang, Aly A.

Despite its widespread adoption, the nuanced mechanisms that underpin its success are not entirely understood. The observed phenomenon of Neural Collapse, where the last-layer activations and classifier of deep networks converge to a simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF), provides a compelling motivation to explore whether mixup induces alternative geometric configurations and whether those could explain its success. In this study, we delve into the last-layer activations of training data for deep networks subjected to mixup, aiming to uncover insights into its operational efficacy. Our investigation, spanning various architectures and dataset pairs, reveals that mixup's last-layer activations predominantly converge to a distinctive configuration different than one might expect. In this configuration, activations from mixed-up examples of identical classes align with the classifier, while those from different classes delineate channels along the decision boundary. These findings are unexpected, as mixed-up features are not simple convex combinations of feature class means (as one might get, for example, by training mixup with the mean squared error loss). By analyzing this distinctive geometric configuration, we elucidate the mechanisms by which mixup enhances model calibration. To further validate our empirical observations, we conduct a theoretical analysis under the assumption of an unconstrained features model, utilizing the mixup loss. Through this, we characterize and derive the optimal last-layer features under the assumption that the classifier forms a simplex ETF. | Quinn LeBlanc Fisher, Haoming Meng, Vardan Papyan |  |

Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have exhibited remarkable success in this field, they are predicated upon the belief that noise follows established distributions, which restricts their practicality when dealing with real-world noise. To overcome this limitation, several efforts have been taken to collect noisy image datasets from the real world. Generative methods, employing techniques such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and normalizing flows (NFs), have emerged as a solution for generating realistic noisy images. Recent works model noise using camera metadata, however requiring metadata even for sampling phase. In contrast, in this work, we aim to estimate the underlying camera settings, enabling us to improve noise modeling and generate diverse noise distributions. To this end, we introduce a new NF framework that allows us to both classify noise based on camera settings and generate various noisy images. Through experimental results, our model demonstrates exceptional noise quality and leads in denoising performance on benchmark datasets. | Dongjin Kim, Donggoo Jung, Sungyong Baik, Tae Hyun Kim |  |

Although pixel classification in HSI has been extensively studied, especially using graph convolution neural networks (GCNs), quantifying epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties associated with the HSI classification (HSIC) results remains an unexplored area. These two uncertainties are effective for out-of-distribution (OOD) and misclassification detection, respectively. In this paper, we adapt two advanced uncertainty quantification models, evidential GCNs (EGCN) and graph posterior networks (GPN), designed for node classifications in graphs, into the realm of HSIC. We first reveal theoretically that a popular uncertainty cross-entropy (UCE) loss function is insufficient to produce good epistemic uncertainty when learning EGCNs. To mitigate the limitations, we propose two regularization terms. One leverages the inherent property of HSI data where each feature vector is a linear combination of the spectra signatures of the confounding materials, while the other is the total variation (TV) regularization to enforce the spatial smoothness of the evidence with edge-preserving. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed regularization terms on both EGCN and GPN on three real-world HSIC datasets for OOD and misclassification detection tasks. The code is available at GitHub. | Linlin Yu, Yifei Lou, Feng Chen |  |

Pseudo-games are a generalization of games in which players' actions affect not only the payoffs of other players but also their feasible action spaces. Although the computation of GNE and CE is intractable in the worst-case, i.e., PPAD-hard, in practice, many applications only require solutions with high accuracy in expectation over a distribution of problem instances. We introduce Generative Adversarial Equilibrium Solvers (GAES): a family of generative adversarial neural networks that can learn GNE and CE from only a sample of problem instances. We provide computational and sample complexity bounds for Lipschitz-smooth function approximators in a large class of concave pseudo-games, and apply the framework to finding Nash equilibria in normal-form games, CE in Arrow-Debreu competitive economies, and GNE in an environmental economic model of the Kyoto mechanism. | Denizalp Goktas, David C.

Similarly, graph-based methods have been shown to be very effective in capturing inherent graph-type relationships in EHRs, leading to improved downstream performance. Although integrating these two families of approaches seems like a natural next step, in practice, creating such a design is challenging and has not been done. This is partly due to known EHR problems, such as high sparsity, making extracting meaningful temporal representations of medical visits challenging. In this study, we propose GT-BEHRT, a new approach that leverages temporal visit embeddings extracted from a graph transformer and uses a BERT-based model to obtain more robust patient representations, especially on longer EHR sequences. The graph-based approach allows GT-BEHRT to implicitly capture the intrinsic graphical relationships between medical observations, while the BERT model extracts the temporal relationships between visits, loosely mimicking the clinicians' decision-making process. As part of our method, we also present a two-step pre-training strategy for learning better graphical and temporal representations. Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in a variety of standard medical predictive tasks, demonstrating the versatility of our approach. | Raphael Poulain, Rahmatollah Beheshti |  |

Unlike naive bounds based on the network weight norm product, semidefinite programs (SDPs) have shown great promise in providing less conservative Lipschitz bounds with polynomial-time complexity guarantees. However, due to the memory consumption and running speed, standard SDP algorithms cannot scale to modern neural network architectures. In this paper, we transform the SDPs for Lipschitz constant estimation into an eigenvalue optimization problem, which aligns with the modern large-scale optimization paradigms based on first-order methods. This is amenable to autodiff frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, requiring significantly less memory than standard SDP algorithms. The transformation also allows us to leverage various existing numerical techniques for eigenvalue optimization, opening the way for further memory improvement and computational speedup. The essential technique of our eigenvalue-problem transformation is to introduce redundant quadratic constraints and then utilize both Lagrangian and Shor's SDP relaxations under a certain trace constraint. Notably, our numerical study successfully scales the SDP-based Lipschitz constant estimation to address large neural networks on ImageNet. Our numerical examples on CIFAR10 and ImageNet demonstrate that our technique is more scalable than existing approaches.

However, existing evaluation benchmarks, primarily relying on rigid, hand-crafted datasets to measure task-specific performance, face significant limitations in assessing the alignment of these increasingly anthropomorphic models with human intelligence. In this work, we address the limitations via Auto-Bench, which delves into exploring LLMs as proficient aligners, measuring the alignment between VLMs and human intelligence and value through automatic data curation and assessment. Specifically, for data curation, Auto-Bench utilizes LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) to automatically generate a vast set of question-answer-reasoning triplets via prompting on visual symbolic representations (e.g., captions, object locations, instance relationships, and etc. The curated data closely matches human intent, owing to the extensive world knowledge embedded in LLMs. Through this pipeline, a total of 28.5K human-verified and 3,504K unfiltered question-answer-reasoning triplets have been curated, covering 4 primary abilities and 16 sub-abilities. We subsequently engage LLMs like GPT-3.5 to serve as judges, implementing the quantitative and qualitative automated assessments to facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of VLMs. Our validation results reveal that LLMs are proficient in both evaluation data curation and model assessment, achieving an average agreement rate of 85%. We envision Auto-Bench as a flexible, scalable, and comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the evolving sophisticated VLMs. | Yuanfeng Ji, Chongjian Ge, Weikai Kong, Enze Xie, Zhengying Liu, Zhenguo Li, Ping Luo |  |

Despite the ongoing rush towards scaling paradigms, audio tokenization ironically amplifies the scalability challenge, stemming from its long sequence length and the complexity of modelling the multiple sequences. To mitigate these issues, we present CLaM-TTS that employs a probabilistic residual vector quantization to (1) achieve superior compression in the token length, and (2) allow a language model to generate multiple tokens at once, thereby eliminating the need for cascaded modeling to handle the number of token streams. Our experimental results demonstrate that CLaM-TTS is better than or comparable to state-of-the-art neural codec-based TTS models regarding naturalness, intelligibility, speaker similarity, and inference speed. In addition, we examine the impact of the pretraining extent of the language models and their text tokenization strategies on performances. | Jaehyeon Kim, Keon Lee, Seungjun Chung, Jaewoong Cho |  |

This paper reveals another striking property of DS-CNN architectures: discernible and explainable patterns emerge in their trained depthwise convolutional kernels in all layers. Through an extensive analysis of millions of trained filters, with different sizes and from various models, we employed unsupervised clustering with autoencoders, to categorize these filters. Astonishingly, the patterns converged into a few main clusters, each resembling the difference of Gaussian (DoG) functions, and their first and second-order derivatives. Notably, we classify over 95\% and 90\% of the filters from state-of-the-art ConvNeXtV2 and ConvNeXt models, respectively. This finding is not merely a technological curiosity; it echoes the foundational models neuroscientists have long proposed for the vision systems of mammals. Our results thus deepen our understanding of the emergent properties of trained DS-CNNs and provide a bridge between artificial and biological visual processing systems. More broadly, they pave the way for more interpretable and biologically-inspired neural network designs in the future. | Zahra Babaiee, Peyman M. Kiasari, Daniela Rus, Radu Grosu |  |

Despite extensive research on explanation generation for supervised node representation learning, explaining unsupervised models has been less explored. To address this gap, we propose a method for generating counterfactual (CF) explanations in unsupervised node representation learning, aiming to identify the most important subgraphs that cause a significant change in the $k$-nearest neighbors of a node of interest in the learned embedding space upon perturbation. The $k$-nearest neighbor-based CF explanation method provides simple, yet pivotal, information for understanding unsupervised downstream tasks, such as top-$k$ link prediction and clustering. Furthermore, we introduce a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based explainability method for generating expressive CF explanations for \*\*U\*\*nsupervised \*\*N\*\*ode \*\*R\*\*epresentation learning methods, which we call \*\*UNR-Explainer\*\*. The proposed method demonstrates improved performance on six datasets for both unsupervised GraphSAGE and DGI. | Hyunju Kang, Geonhee Han, Hogun Park |  |
| 750 |  |  [Are Bert Family Good Instruction Followers? A Study on Their Potential And Limitations](https://openreview.net/forum?id=x8VNtpCu1I) |  | 0 | Language modeling at scale has proven very effective and brought unprecedented success to natural language models. Many typical representatives, especially decoder-only models, e.g., BLOOM and LLaMA, and encoder-decoder models, e.g., Flan-T5 and AlexaTM, have exhibited incredible instruction-following capabilities while keeping strong task completion ability. These large language models can achieve superior performance in various tasks and even yield emergent capabilities, e.g., reasoning and universal generalization. Though the above two paradigms are mainstream and well explored, the potential of the BERT family, which are encoder-only based models and have ever been one of the most representative pre-trained models, also deserves attention, at least should be discussed. In this work, we adopt XML-R to explore the effectiveness of the BERT family for instruction following and zero-shot learning. We first design a simple yet effective strategy to utilize the encoder-only models for generation tasks and then conduct multi-task instruction tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that our fine-tuned model, Instruct-XMLR, outperforms Bloomz on all evaluation tasks and achieves comparable performance with mT0 on most tasks. Surprisingly, Instruct-XMLR also possesses strong task and language generalization abilities, indicating that Instruct-XMLR can also serve as a good instruction follower and zero-shot learner. Besides, Instruct-XMLR can accelerate decoding due to its non-autoregressive generation manner, achieving around 3 times speedup compared with current autoregressive large language models. Although we also witnessed several limitations through our experiments, such as the performance decline in long-generation tasks and the shortcoming of length prediction, Instruct-XMLR can still become a good member of the family of current large language models. | Yisheng Xiao, Juntao Li, Zechen Sun, Zechang Li, Qingrong Xia, Xinyu Duan, Zhefeng Wang, Min Zhang |  |
| 751 |  |  [Exploring the Promise and Limits of Real-Time Recurrent Learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=V2cBKtdC3a) |  | 0 | Real-time recurrent learning (RTRL) for sequence-processing recurrent neural networks (RNNs) offers certain conceptual advantages over backpropagation through time (BPTT). RTRL requires neither caching past activations nor truncating context, and enables online learning. However, RTRL's time and space complexity make it impractical. To overcome this problem, most recent work on RTRL focuses on approximation theories, while experiments are often limited to diagnostic settings. Here we explore the practical promise of RTRL in more realistic settings. We study actor-critic methods that combine RTRL and policy gradients, and test them in several subsets of DMLab-30, ProcGen, and Atari-2600 environments. On DMLab memory tasks, our system trained on fewer than 1.2B environmental frames is competitive with or outperforms well-known IMPALA and R2D2 baselines trained on 10B frames. To scale to such challenging tasks, we focus on certain well-known neural architectures with element-wise recurrence, allowing for tractable RTRL without approximation. Importantly, we also discuss rarely addressed limitations of RTRL in real-world applications, such as its complexity in the multi-layer case. | Kazuki Irie, Anand Gopalakrishnan, Jürgen Schmidhuber |  |

While achieving state-of-the-art results, the best-performing architectures vary highly across applications and domains. Meanwhile, for natural language processing, the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) has demonstrated impressive performance via training one general-purpose model across various textual datasets. It is intriguing to explore whether GPT-type architectures can be effective for time series, capturing the intrinsic dynamic attributes and leading to significant accuracy improvements. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, TEMPO, that can effectively learn time series representations. We focus on utilizing two essential inductive biases of the time series task for pre-trained models: (i) decomposition of the complex interaction between trend, seasonal and residual components; and (ii) introducing the design of prompts to facilitate distribution adaptation in different types of time series. TEMPO expands the capability for dynamically modeling real-world temporal phenomena from data within diverse domains. Our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of TEMPO over state-of-the-art methods on zero shot setting for a number of time series benchmark datasets. This performance gain is observed not only in scenarios involving previously unseen datasets but also in scenarios with multi-modal inputs. This compelling finding highlights TEMPO's potential to constitute a foundational model-building framework. | Defu Cao, Furong Jia, Sercan Ö. Arik, Tomas Pfister, Yixiang Zheng, Wen Ye, Yan Liu |  |
| 753 |  |  [Scaling physics-informed hard constraints with mixture-of-experts](https://openreview.net/forum?id=u3dX2CEIZb) |  | 0 | Imposing known physical constraints, such as conservation laws, during neural network training introduces an inductive bias that can improve accuracy, reliability, convergence, and data efficiency for modeling physical dynamics. While such constraints can be softly imposed via loss function penalties, recent advancements in differentiable physics and optimization improve performance by incorporating PDE-constrained optimization as individual layers in neural networks. This enables a stricter adherence to physical constraints. However, imposing hard constraints significantly increases computational and memory costs, especially for complex dynamical systems. This is because it requires solving an optimization problem over a large number of points in a mesh, representing spatial and temporal discretizations, which greatly increases the complexity of the constraint. To address this challenge, we develop a scalable approach to enforce hard physical constraints using Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), which can be used with any neural network architecture. Our approach imposes the constraint over smaller decomposed domains, each of which is solved by an \`\`expert'' through differentiable optimization. During training, each expert independently performs a localized backpropagation step by leveraging the implicit function theorem; the independence of each expert allows for parallelization across multiple GPUs. Compared to standard differentiable optimization, our scalable approach achieves greater accuracy in the neural PDE solver setting for predicting the dynamics of challenging non-linear systems. We also improve training stability and require significantly less computation time during both training and inference stages. | Nithin Chalapathi, Yiheng Du, Aditi S. Krishnapriyan |  |

Yet, their efficacy often hinges on access to high-quality labeled node samples, which may not always be available in real-world scenarios. While active learning is commonly employed across various domains to pinpoint and label high-quality samples based on data features, graph data present unique challenges due to their intrinsic structures that render nodes non-i.i.d. Furthermore, biases emerge from the positioning of labeled nodes; for instance, nodes closer to the labeled counterparts often yield better performance. To better leverage graph structure and mitigate structural bias in active learning, we present a unified optimization framework (SCARCE), which is also easily incorporated with node features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method not only improves the GNNs performance but also paves the way for more fair results. | Haoyu Han, Xiaorui Liu, Li Ma, MohamadAli Torkamani, Hui Liu, Jiliang Tang, Makoto Yamada |  |

We introduce the Neural-Symbolic Recursive Ma- chine ( NSR), whose core is a Grounded Symbol System ( GSS), allowing for the emergence of combinatorial syntax and semantics directly from training data. The NSR employs a modular design that integrates neural perception, syntactic parsing, and semantic reasoning. These components are synergistically trained through a novel deduction-abduction algorithm. Our findings demonstrate that NSR’s design, imbued with the inductive biases of equivariance and compositionality, grants it the expressiveness to adeptly handle diverse sequence-to-sequence tasks and achieve unparalleled systematic generalization. We evaluate NSR’s efficacy across four challenging benchmarks designed to probe systematic generalization capabilities: SCAN for semantic parsing, PCFG for string manipulation, HINT for arithmetic reasoning, and a compositional machine translation task. The results affirm NSR ’s superiority over contemporary neural and hybrid models in terms of generalization and transferability. | Qing Li, Yixin Zhu, Yitao Liang, Ying Nian Wu, SongChun Zhu, Siyuan Huang |  |
| 756 |  |  [Davidsonian Scene Graph: Improving Reliability in Fine-grained Evaluation for Text-to-Image Generation](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ITq4ZRUT4a) |  | 0 | Evaluating text-to-image models is notoriously difficult. A strong recent approach for assessing text-image faithfulness is based on QG/A (question generation and answering), which uses pre-trained foundational models to automatically generate a set of questions and answers from the prompt, and output images are scored based on whether these answers extracted with a visual question answering model are consistent with the prompt-based answers. This kind of evaluation is naturally dependent on the quality of the underlying QG and VQA models. We identify and address several reliability challenges in existing QG/A work: (a) QG questions should respect the prompt (avoiding hallucinations, duplications, and omissions) and (b) VQA answers should be consistent (not asserting that there is no motorcycle in an image while also claiming the motorcycle is blue). We address these issues with Davidsonian Scene Graph (DSG), an empirically grounded evaluation framework inspired by formal semantics, which is adaptable to any QG/A frameworks. DSG produces atomic and unique questions organized in dependency graphs, which (i) ensure appropriate semantic coverage and (ii) sidestep inconsistent answers. With extensive experimentation and human evaluation on a range of model configurations (LLM, VQA, and T2I), we empirically demonstrate that DSG addresses the challenges noted above. Finally, we present DSG-1k, an open-sourced evaluation benchmark that includes 1,060 prompts, covering a wide range of fine-grained semantic categories with a balanced distribution. We release the DSG-1k prompts and the corresponding DSG questions. | Jaemin Cho, Yushi Hu, Jason M. Baldridge, Roopal Garg, Peter Anderson, Ranjay Krishna, Mohit Bansal, Jordi PontTuset, Su Wang |  |

However, the mechanism behind CoT remains unclear. This work provides a theoretical understanding of the power of CoT for decoder-only transformers through the lens of expressiveness. Conceptually, CoT empowers the model with the ability to perform inherently serial computation, which is otherwise lacking in transformers, especially when depth is low. Given input length $n$, previous works have constant-depth transformers with finite precision $\mathsf{poly}(n)$ embedding size can only solve problems in $\mathsf{TC}^0$ without CoT. We first show an even tighter expressiveness upper bound for constant-depth transformers with constant-bit precision, which can only solve problems in $\mathsf{AC}^0$, a proper subset of $ \mathsf{TC}^0$. However, with $T$ steps of CoT, constant-depth transformers using constant-bit precision and $O(\log n)$ embedding size can solve any problem solvable by boolean circuits of size $T$. Empirically, enabling CoT dramatically improves the accuracy for tasks that are hard for parallel computation, including the composition of permutation groups, iterated squaring, and circuit value problems, especially for low-depth transformers. | Zhiyuan Liu, Hong Liu, Denny Zhou, Tengyu Ma |  |

In practice, however, one needs to apply approximate sampling methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), thus re-introducing the unappealing $\delta$-approximation error into the privacy guarantees. To bridge this gap, we propose the Approximate SAample Perturbation (abbr. ASAP) algorithm which perturbs an MCMC sample with noise proportional to its Wasserstein-infinity ($W_\infty$) distance from a reference distribution that satisfies pure DP or pure Gaussian DP (i.e., $\delta=0$). We then leverage a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to generate the sample and prove that the algorithm converges in W$_\infty$ distance. We show that by combining our new techniques with a localization step, we obtain the first nearly linear-time algorithm that achieves the optimal rates in the DP-ERM problem with strongly convex and smooth losses. | Yingyu Lin, Yian Ma, YuXiang Wang, Rachel Redberg, Zhiqi Bu |  |
| 759 |  |  [Optimal Sketching for Residual Error Estimation for Matrix and Vector Norms](https://openreview.net/forum?id=RsJwmWvE6Q) |  | 0 | We study the problem of residual error estimation for matrix and vector norms using a linear sketch. Such estimates can be used, for example, to quickly assess how useful a more expensive low-rank approximation computation will be. The matrix case concerns the Frobenius norm and the task is to approximate the $k$-residual $\\|A - A_k\\|_F$ of the input matrix $A$ within a $(1+\epsilon)$-factor, where $A_k$ is the optimal rank-$k$ approximation. We provide a tight bound of $\Theta(k^2/\epsilon^4)$ on the size of bilinear sketches, which have the form of a matrix product $SAT$. This improves the previous $O(k^2/\epsilon^6)$ upper bound in (Andoni et al. SODA 2013) and gives the first non-trivial lower bound, to the best of our knowledge. In our algorithm, our sketching matrices $S$ and $T$ can both be sparse matrices, allowing for a very fast update time. We demonstrate that this gives a substantial advantage empirically, for roughly the same sketch size and accuracy as in previous work. For the vector case, we consider the $\ell_p$-norm for $p>2$, where the task is to approximate the $k$-residual $\\|x - x_k\\|_p$ up to a constant factor, where $x_k$ is the optimal $k$-sparse approximation to $x$. Such vector norms are frequently studied in the data stream literature and are useful for finding frequent items or so-called heavy hitters. We establish an upper bound of $O(k^{2/p}n^{1-2/p}\operatorname{poly}(\log n))$ for constant $\epsilon$ on the dimension of a linear sketch for this problem. Our algorithm can be extended to the $\ell_p$ sparse recovery problem with the same sketching dimension, which seems to be the first such bound for $p > 2$. We also show an $\Omega(k^{2/p}n^{1-2/p})$ lower bound for the sparse recovery problem, which is tight up to a $\mathrm{poly}(\log n)$ factor. | Yi Li, Honghao Lin, David P. Woodruff |  |
| 760 |  |  [Reverse Diffusion Monte Carlo](https://openreview.net/forum?id=kIPEyMSdFV) |  | 0 | We propose a Monte Carlo sampler from the reverse diffusion process. Unlike the practice of diffusion models, where the intermediary updates---the score functions---are learned with a neural network, we transform the score matching problem into a mean estimation one. By estimating the means of the regularized posterior distributions, we derive a novel Monte Carlo sampling algorithm called reverse diffusion Monte Carlo (rdMC), which is distinct from the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We determine the sample size from the error tolerance and the properties of the posterior distribution to yield an algorithm that can approximately sample the target distribution with any desired accuracy. Additionally, we demonstrate and prove under suitable conditions that sampling with rdMC can be significantly faster than that with MCMC. For multi-modal target distributions such as those in Gaussian mixture models, rdMC greatly improves over the Langevin-style MCMC sampling methods both theoretically and in practice. The proposed rdMC method offers a new perspective and solution beyond classical MCMC algorithms for the challenging complex distributions. | Xunpeng Huang, Hanze Dong, Yifan Hao, Yian Ma, Tong Zhang |  |

However, there are still open questions regarding their ability to count and list substructures, which play a crucial role in biological and social networks. In this work, we fill this gap and characterize the representation {and generalization} power of GNNs in terms of their ability to produce powerful representations that count substructures. In particular, we study the message-passing operations of GNNs with random node input in a novel fashion, and show how they can produce equivariant representations that are associated with high-order statistical moments. Using these representations, we prove that GNNs can learn how to count cycles, {cliques}, quasi-cliques, and the number of connected components in a graph. We also provide new insights into the generalization capacity of GNNs. Our analysis is constructive and enables the design of a generic GNN architecture that shows remarkable performance in four distinct tasks: cycle detection, cycle counting, graph classification, and molecular property prediction. | Charilaos I.

A key observation in prior work is that models reinforce stereotypes as a consequence of the gendered correlations that are present in the training data. In this paper, we focus on bias where the effect from training data is unclear, and instead address the question: \*Do language models still exhibit gender bias in non-stereotypical settings?\* To do so, we introduce \*\*UnStereoEval (USE)\*\*, a novel framework tailored for investigating gender bias in stereotype-free scenarios. USE defines a sentence-level score based on pretraining data statistics to determine if the sentence contain minimal word-gender associations. To systematically benchmark the fairness of popular language models in stereotype-free scenarios, we utilize USE to automatically generate benchmarks without any gender-related language. By leveraging USE's sentence-level score, we also repurpose prior gender bias benchmarks (Winobias and Winogender) for non-stereotypical evaluation. Surprisingly, we find low fairness across all 28 tested models. Concretely, models demonstrate fair behavior in only 9%-41% of stereotype-free sentences, suggesting that bias does not solely stem from the presence of gender-related words. These results raise important questions about where underlying model biases come from and highlight the need for more systematic and comprehensive bias evaluation.

It involves integrating common-sense knowledge to reason about complex and often contextualized situations, e.g. \`\`scheduling a doctor's appointment without a phone''. While current approaches show encouraging results using large language models (LLMs), they are hindered by drawbacks such as costly API calls and reproducibility issues. In this paper, we advocate planning using smaller language models. We present PlaSma, a novel two-pronged approach to endow small language models with procedural knowledge and (constrained) language-based planning capabilities. More concretely, we develop \*symbolic procedural knowledge distillation\* to enhance the commonsense knowledge in small language models and an \*inference-time algorithm\* to facilitate more structured and accurate reasoning. In addition, we introduce a new related task, \*Replanning\*, that requires a revision of a plan to cope with a constrained situation. In both the planning and replanning settings, we show that orders-of-magnitude smaller models (770M-11B parameters) can compete and often surpass their larger teacher models' capabilities. Finally, we showcase successful application of PlaSma in an embodied environment, VirtualHome. | Faeze Brahman, Chandra Bhagavatula, Valentina Pyatkin, Jena D.

Similar success in atomic property prediction has been limited due to the challenges of training effective models across multiple chemical domains. To address this, we introduce Joint Multi-domain Pre-training (JMP), a supervised pre-training strategy that simultaneously trains on multiple datasets from different chemical domains, treating each dataset as a unique pre-training task within a multi-task framework. Our combined training dataset consists of $\sim$120M systems from OC20, OC22, ANI-1x, and Transition-1x. We evaluate performance and generalization by fine-tuning over a diverse set of downstream tasks and datasets including: QM9, rMD17, MatBench, QMOF, SPICE, and MD22.

In molecular machine learning, however, where datasets are often hand-curated, and hence typically small, the lack of datasets with labeled features, and codebases to manage those datasets, has hindered the development of foundation models. In this work, we present seven novel datasets categorized by size into three distinct categories: ToyMix, LargeMix and UltraLarge. These datasets push the boundaries in both the scale and the diversity of supervised labels for molecular learning. They cover nearly 100 million molecules and over 3000 sparsely defined tasks, totaling more than 13 billion individual labels of both quantum and biological nature. In comparison, our datasets contain 300 times more data points than the widely used OGB-LSC PCQM4Mv2 dataset, and 13 times more than the quantum-only QM1B dataset. In addition, to support the development of foundational models based on our proposed datasets, we present the Graphium graph machine learning library which simplifies the process of building and training molecular machine learning models for multi-task and multi-level molecular datasets. Finally, we present a range of baseline results as a starting point of multi-task and multi-level training on these datasets. Empirically, we observe that performance on low-resource biological datasets show improvement by also training on large amounts of quantum data. This indicates that there may be potential in multi-task and multi-level training of a foundation model and fine-tuning it to resource-constrained downstream tasks. The Graphium library is publicly available on Github and the dataset links are available in Part 1 and Part 2. | Dominique Beaini, Shenyang Huang, Joao Alex Cunha, Zhiyi Li, Gabriela MoisescuPareja, Oleksandr Dymov, Samuel MaddrellMander, Callum McLean, Frederik Wenkel, Luis Müller, Jama Hussein Mohamud, Ali Parviz, Michael Craig, Michal Koziarski, Jiarui Lu, Zhaocheng Zhu, Cristian Gabellini, Kerstin Klaser, Josef Dean, Cas Wognum, Maciej Sypetkowski, Guillaume Rabusseau, Reihaneh Rabbany, Jian Tang, Christopher Morris, Mirco Ravanelli, Guy Wolf, Prudencio Tossou, Hadrien Mary, Therence Bois, Andrew W.

Except for certain network structures, causal inference on the network in the presence of interference is difficult due to the entanglement between the treatment assignments and the interference levels. In this article, we conduct causal inference under interference on an observed, sparse, but connected network, and we propose a novel design of experiments based on an independent set. Compared to conventional designs, the independent-set design focuses on an independent subset of data and controls their interference exposures through the assignments to the rest (auxiliary set). We provide a lower bound on the size of the independent set from a greedy algorithm and justify the theoretical performance of estimators under the proposed design. Our approach is capable of estimating both spillover effects and treatment effects. We justify its superiority over conventional methods and illustrate the empirical performance through simulations. | Chencheng Cai, Xu Zhang, Edoardo M. Airoldi |  |

A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)---which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N\log N)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms---1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions---which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 8.7$\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score---matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models---yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)---and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality. | Daniel Y.

Transformer-VQ's efficient attention is enabled by vector-quantized keys and a novel caching mechanism. In our large-scale experiments, Transformer-VQ is shown highly competitive in quality, obtaining 0.99 bpb on Enwik8, 26.6 ppl on PG-19, and 3.16 bpb on ImageNet64. In addition, the optimized implementation of Transformer-VQ is over 3x faster than a comparable quadratic-time transformer at sequence length 8k, is over 12x faster at 32k, and can scale to 131k with similar throughput.

| 769 |  |  [The Hedgehog & the Porcupine: Expressive Linear Attentions with Softmax Mimicry](https://openreview.net/forum?id=4g02l2N2Nx) |  | 0 | Linear attentions have shown promise for improving Transformer efficiency, reducing attention's quadratic complexity to linear in sequence length. This holds exciting promise for (1) training linear Transformers from scratch, (2) \`inetuned-conversion of task-specific Transformers into linear versions that recover task performance, and (3) pretrained-conversion of Transformers, such as language models, into linear versions readily finetunable on downstream tasks. However, linear attentions often underperform compared to standard softmax attention. To close this performance gap, we study the behaviors of softmax and linear attentions in various train-from-scratch and finetuned-conversion settings. We find prior linear attentions lack key properties of softmax attention tied to good performance: low-entropy (or spiky) weights and dot-product monotonicity. We further observe surprisingly simple feature maps that retain these properties match softmax performance, but are inefficient to compute in linear attention. We thus propose Hedgehog, a learnable linear attention that retains the spiky and monotonic properties of softmax attention while maintaining linear complexity. Hedgehog uses simple, trainable MLPs to produce attention weights mimicking softmax attention. Experiments show Hedgehog recovers over 99\% of standard Transformer performance in train-from-scratch and finetuned-conversion settings, outperforming prior linear attentions by up to 6 perplexity points on WikiText-103 when training causal GPT models from scratch, and up to 8.7 GLUE score points when converting finetuned bidirectional BERT models. Hedgehog also enables pretrained-conversion. Converting a pretrained GPT-2 into a linear attention variant achieves state-of-the-art 16.7 perplexity on WikiText-103 for 125M subquadratic decoder models. We finally turn a pretrained Llama-2 7B into a viable linear attention Llama. With low-rank adaptation, Hedgehog-Llama-2 7B achieves 28.1 higher ROUGE-1 points over the base standard attention model, where prior linear attentions lead to 16.5 point drops. | Michael Zhang, Kush Bhatia, Hermann Kumbong, Christopher Ré |  |
| 770 |  |  [Abstractors and relational cross-attention: An inductive bias for explicit relational reasoning in Transformers](https://openreview.net/forum?id=XNa6r6ZjoB) |  | 0 | An extension of Transformers is proposed that enables explicit relational reasoning through a novel module called the \*Abstractor\*. At the core of the Abstractor is a variant of attention called \*relational cross-attention\*. The approach is motivated by an architectural inductive bias for relational learning that disentangles relational information from object-level features. This enables explicit relational reasoning, supporting abstraction and generalization from limited data. The Abstractor is first evaluated on simple discriminative relational tasks and compared to existing relational architectures. Next, the Abstractor is evaluated on purely relational sequence-to-sequence tasks, where dramatic improvements are seen in sample efficiency compared to standard Transformers. Finally, Abstractors are evaluated on a collection of tasks based on mathematical problem solving, where consistent improvements in performance and sample efficiency are observed. | Awni Altabaa, Taylor Whittington Webb, Jonathan D.

However, existing instance-reweighted adversarial training (AT) methods heavily depend on heuristics and/or geometric interpretations to determine those importance weights, making these algorithms lack rigorous theoretical justification/guarantee. Moreover, recent research has shown that adversarial training suffers from a severe non-uniform robust performance across the training distribution, e.g., data points belonging to some classes can be much more vulnerable to adversarial attacks than others. To address both issues, in this paper, we propose a novel doubly-robust instance reweighted AT framework, which allows to obtain the importance weights via exploring distributionally robust optimization (DRO) techniques, and at the same time boosts the robustness on the most vulnerable examples. In particular, our importance weights are obtained by optimizing the KL-divergence regularized loss function, which allows us to devise new algorithms with a theoretical convergence guarantee. Experiments on standard classification datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms related state-of-the-art baseline methods in terms of average robust performance, and at the same time improves the robustness against attacks on the weakest data points. Codes can be found in the Supplement. | Daouda Sow, Sen Lin, Zhangyang Wang, Yingbin Liang |  |
| 772 |  |  [Training Diffusion Models with Reinforcement Learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=YCWjhGrJFD) |  | 0 | Diffusion models are a class of flexible generative models trained with an approximation to the log-likelihood objective. However, most use cases of diffusion models are not concerned with likelihoods, but instead with downstream objectives such as human-perceived image quality or drug effectiveness. In this paper, we investigate reinforcement learning methods for directly optimizing diffusion models for such objectives. We describe how posing denoising as a multi-step decision-making problem enables a class of policy gradient algorithms, which we refer to as denoising diffusion policy optimization ( DDPO), that are more effective than alternative reward-weighted likelihood approaches. Empirically, DDPO can adapt text-to-image diffusion models to objectives that are difficult to express via prompting, such as image compressibility, and those derived from human feedback, such as aesthetic quality. Finally, we show that DDPO can improve prompt-image alignment using feedback from a vision-language model without the need for additional data collection or human annotation.

| 773 |  |  [Finite-Time Analysis of On-Policy Heterogeneous Federated Reinforcement Learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=D2eOVqPX9g) |  | 0 | Federated reinforcement learning (FRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for reducing the sample complexity of reinforcement learning tasks by exploiting information from different agents. However, when each agent interacts with a potentially different environment, little to nothing is known theoretically about the non-asymptotic performance of FRL algorithms. The lack of such results can be attributed to various technical challenges and their intricate interplay: Markovian sampling, linear function approximation, multiple local updates to save communication, heterogeneity in the reward functions and transition kernels of the agents' MDPs, and continuous state-action spaces. Moreover, in the on-policy setting, the behavior policies vary with time, further complicating the analysis. In response, we introduce FedSARSA, a novel federated on-policy reinforcement learning scheme, equipped with linear function approximation, to address these challenges and provide a comprehensive finite-time error analysis. Notably, we establish that FedSARSA converges to a policy that is near-optimal for all agents, with the extent of near-optimality proportional to the level of heterogeneity. Furthermore, we prove that FedSARSA leverages agent collaboration to enable linear speedups as the number of agents increases, which holds for both fixed and adaptive step-size configurations. | Chenyu Zhang, Han Wang, Aritra Mitra, James Anderson |  |

While linear speedup in the number of agents has been achieved for some metrics, such as convergence rate and sample complexity, in similar settings, it is unclear whether it is possible to design a \*model-free\* algorithm to achieve linear \*regret\* speedup with low communication cost. We propose two federated Q-Learning algorithms termed as FedQ-Hoeffding and FedQ-Bernstein, respectively, and show that the corresponding total regrets achieve a linear speedup compared with their single-agent counterparts, while the communication cost scales logarithmically in the total number of time steps $T$. Those results rely on an event-triggered synchronization mechanism between the agents and the server, a novel step size selection when the server aggregates the local estimates of the state-action values to form the global estimates, and a set of new concentration inequalities to bound the sum of non-martingale differences. This is the first work showing that linear regret speedup and logarithmic communication cost can be achieved by model-free algorithms in federated reinforcement learning. | Zhong Zheng, Fengyu Gao, Lingzhou Xue, Jing Yang |  |
| 775 |  |  [The Trickle-down Impact of Reward Inconsistency on RLHF](https://openreview.net/forum?id=MeHmwCDifc) |  | 0 | Standard practice within Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) involves optimizing against a Reward Model (RM), which itself is trained to reflect human preferences for desirable generations. A notable subject that is understudied is the (in-)consistency of RMs --- whether they can recognize the semantic changes to different prompts and appropriately adapt their reward assignments --- and their impact on the downstream RLHF model. In this paper, we visit a series of research questions relevant to RM inconsistency: (1) How can we measure the consistency of reward models? (2) How consistent are the existing RMs and how can we improve them? (3) In what ways does reward inconsistency influence the chatbots resulting from the RLHF model training? We propose \*\*Contrast Instruction\*\* -- a benchmarking strategy for the consistency of RM. Each example in \*\*Contrast Instruction\*\* features a pair of lexically similar instructions with different ground truth responses. A consistent RM is expected to rank the corresponding instruction and response higher than other combinations. We observe that current RMs trained with the standard ranking objective fail miserably on \contrast{} compared to average humans. To show that RM consistency can be improved efficiently without using extra training budget, we propose two techniques \*\*ConvexDA\*\* and \*\*RewardFusion\*\*, which enhance reward consistency through extrapolation during the RM training and inference stage, respectively. We show that RLHF models trained with a more consistent RM yield more useful responses, suggesting that reward inconsistency exhibits a trickle-down effect on the downstream RLHF process. | Lingfeng Shen, Sihao Chen, Linfeng Song, Lifeng Jin, Baolin Peng, Haitao Mi, Daniel Khashabi, Dong Yu |  |

We revisit the modulation mechanism, which operates input through convolutional context modeling and feature projection layers, and fuses features via element-wise multiplication and an MLP block. We demonstrate that the abstracted modulation mechanism is particularly well suited for efficient networks and further tailor the modulation design by proposing the efficient modulation (EfficientMod) block, which is considered the essential building block for our networks. Bene- fiting from the prominent representational ability of modulation mechanism and the efficiency of efficient modulation design, our network can accomplish better accuracy-efficiency trade-offs and set new state-of-the-art performance for efficient networks. When integrating EfficientMod block with the vanilla self-attention block, we obtain the hybrid architecture and further improve the performance without sacrificing the efficiency. We carry out comprehensive experiments to verify EfficientMod’s performance. With fewer parameters, our EfficientMod-s performs 0.6 top-1 accuracy better than the prior state-of-the-art approach EfficientFormerV2-s2 without any training tricks and is 25% faster on GPU. Additionally, our method presents a notable improvement in downstream tasks, outperforming EfficientFormerV2-s by 3.6 mIoU on the ADE20K benchmark.

In this work, we introduce an innovative pre-training approach, Grounded Point Colorization (GPC), to bridge the gap between data and labels by teaching the model to colorize LiDAR point clouds, equipping it with valuable semantic cues. To tackle challenges arising from color variations and selection bias, we incorporate color as "context" by providing ground-truth colors as hints during colorization. Experimental results on the KITTI and Waymo datasets demonstrate GPC's remarkable effectiveness. Even with limited labeled data, GPC significantly improves fine-tuning performance; notably, on just 20% of the KITTI dataset, GPC outperforms training from scratch with the entire dataset. In sum, we introduce a fresh perspective on pre-training for 3D object detection, aligning the objective with the model's intended role and ultimately advancing the accuracy and efficiency of 3D object detection for autonomous vehicles. | TaiYu Pan, Chenyang Ma, Tianle Chen, Cheng Perng Phoo, Katie Z.

While it has been hypothesized that knowledge and skills come from pre-training, and fine-tuning mostly filters this knowledge and skillset, this intuition has not been extensively tested. To aid in doing so, we introduce a novel technique for decoupling the knowledge and skills gained in these two stages, enabling a direct answer to the question, \*What would happen if we combined the knowledge learned by a large model during pre-training with the knowledge learned by a small model during fine-tuning (or vice versa)?\* Using an RL-based framework derived from recent developments in learning from human preferences, we introduce \*emulated fine-tuning (EFT)\*, a principled and practical method for sampling from a distribution that approximates (or 'emulates') the result of pre-training and fine-tuning at different scales. Our experiments with EFT show that scaling up fine-tuning tends to improve helpfulness, while scaling up pre-training tends to improve factuality. Beyond decoupling scale, we show that EFT enables test-time adjustment of competing behavioral traits like helpfulness and harmlessness without additional training. Finally, a special case of emulated fine-tuning, which we call LM \*up-scaling\*, avoids resource-intensive fine-tuning of large pre-trained models by ensembling them with small fine-tuned models, essentially emulating the result of fine-tuning the large pre-trained model. Up-scaling consistently improves helpfulness and factuality of instruction-following models in the Llama, Llama-2, and Falcon families, without additional hyperparameters or training.

It has been widely observed that a best-performing teacher does not necessarily yield the best-performing student, suggesting a fundamental discrepancy between the current teacher training practice and the ideal teacher training strategy. To fill this gap, we explore the feasibility of training a teacher that is oriented toward student performance with empirical risk minimization (ERM). Our analyses are inspired by the recent findings that the effectiveness of knowledge distillation hinges on the teacher’s capability to approximate the true label distribution of training inputs. We theoretically establish that ERM minimizer can approximate the true label distribution of training data as long as the feature extractor of the learner network is Lipschitz continuous and is robust to feature transformations. In light of our theory, we propose a teacher training method SoTeacher which incorporates Lipschitz regularization and consistency regularization into ERM. Experiments on benchmark datasets using various knowledge distillation algorithms and teacher-student pairs confirm that SoTeacher can improve student accuracy consistently. | Chengyu Dong, Liyuan Liu, Jingbo Shang |  |

We find evidence for the latter by analyzing the learned representations of three spatial datasets (world, US, NYC places) and three temporal datasets (historical figures, artworks, news headlines) in the Llama-2 family of models. We discover that LLMs learn linear representations of space and time across multiple scales. These representations are robust to prompting variations and unified across different entity types (e.g. cities and landmarks). In addition, we identify individual "space neurons" and "time neurons" that reliably encode spatial and temporal coordinates. While further investigation is needed, our results suggest modern LLMs learn rich spatiotemporal representations of the real world and possess basic ingredients of a world model. | Wes Gurnee, Max Tegmark |  |

This paper introduces the Causal Modelling Agent (CMA), a novel framework that synergizes the metadata-based reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the data-driven modelling of Deep Structural Causal Models (DSCMs) for the task of causal discovery. We evaluate the CMA's performance on a number of benchmarks, as well as on the real-world task of modelling the clinical and radiological phenotype of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Our experimental results indicate that the CMA can outperform previous data-driven or metadata-driven approaches to causal discovery. In our real-world application, we use the CMA to derive new insights into the causal relationships among biomarkers of AD. | Ahmed Abdulaal, Adamos Hadjivasiliou, Nina Montaña Brown, Tiantian He, Ayodeji Ijishakin, Ivana Drobnjak, Daniel C.

Although ELECTRA offers a significant boost in efficiency, its potential is constrained by the training cost brought by the auxiliary model. Notably, this model, which is jointly trained with the main model, only serves to assist the training of the main model and is discarded post-training. This results in a substantial amount of training cost being expended in vain. To mitigate this issue, we propose Fast-ELECTRA, which leverages an existing language model as the auxiliary model. To construct a learning curriculum for the main model, we smooth its output distribution via temperature scaling following a descending schedule. Our approach rivals the performance of state-of-the-art ELECTRA-style pre-training methods, while significantly eliminating the computation and memory cost brought by the joint training of the auxiliary model. Our method also reduces the sensitivity to hyper-parameters and enhances the pre-training stability. | Chengyu Dong, Liyuan Liu, Hao Cheng, Jingbo Shang, Jianfeng Gao, Xiaodong Liu |  |

If the model is accurate enough, it accelerates the convergence to the true value function too. One of its key components is the MaxEnt Model Correction (MoCo) procedure that corrects the model’s next-state distributions based on a Maximum Entropy density estimation formulation. Based on MoCo, we introduce the Model Correcting Value Iteration (MoCoVI) algorithm, and its sampled-based variant MoCoDyna. We show that MoCoVI and MoCoDyna’s convergence can be much faster than the conventional model-free algorithms. Unlike traditional model-based algorithms, MoCoVI and MoCoDyna effectively utilize an approximate model and still converge to the correct value function. | Amin Rakhsha, Mete Kemertas, Mohammad Ghavamzadeh, Amirmassoud Farahmand |  |

To address this problem, we introduce SpaCE: The Spatial Confounding Environment, the first toolkit to provide realistic benchmark datasets and tools for systematically evaluating causal inference methods designed to alleviate spatial confounding. Each dataset includes training data, true counterfactuals, a spatial graph with coordinates, and smoothness and confounding scores characterizing the effect of a missing spatial confounder. It also includes realistic semi-synthetic outcomes and counterfactuals, generated using state-of-the-art machine learning ensembles, following best practices for causal inference benchmarks. The datasets cover real treatment and covariates from diverse domains, including climate, health and social sciences. SpaCE facilitates an automated end-to-end pipeline, simplifying data loading, experimental setup, and evaluating machine learning and causal inference models. The SpaCE project provides several dozens of datasets of diverse sizes and spatial complexity. It is publicly available as a Python package, encouraging community feedback and contributions. | Mauricio Tec, Ana Trisovic, Michelle Audirac, Sophie Woodward, Jie Kate Hu, Naeem Khoshnevis, Francesca Dominici |  |

While both academic and commercial detectors have been deployed in some settings, particularly education, other research has highlighted the fragility of these systems. In this paper, we demonstrate a data-efficient attack that fine-tunes language models to confuse existing detectors, leveraging recent developments in reinforcement learning of language models. We use the \`human-ness' score (often just a log probability) of various open-source and commercial detectors as a reward function for reinforcement learning, subject to a KL-divergence constraint that the resulting model does not differ significantly from the original. For a 7B parameter Llama-2 model, fine-tuning for under a day reduces the AUROC of the OpenAI RoBERTa-Large detector from 0.84 to 0.63, while perplexity on OpenWebText increases from 8.7 to only 9.0; with a larger perplexity budget, we can drive AUROC to 0.30 (worse than random). Similar to traditional adversarial attacks, we find that this increase in 'detector evasion' generalizes to other detectors not used during training. In light of our empirical results, we advise against continued reliance on LLM-generated text detectors. Models, datasets, and selected experiment code will be released at https://github.com/charlottttee/llm-detector-evasion. | Charlotte Nicks, Eric Mitchell, Rafael Rafailov, Archit Sharma, Christopher D.

Such objects and scenarios might not be present in the robot’s own training data. We propose SuSIE, a method that leverages an image-editing diffusion model to act as a high-level planner by proposing intermediate subgoals that a low-level controller can accomplish. Specifically, we finetune InstructPix2Pix on video data, consisting of both human videos and robot rollouts, such that it outputs hypothetical future “subgoal” observations given the robot’s current observation and a language command. We also use the robot data to train a low-level goal-conditioned policy to act as the aforementioned low-level controller. We find that the high-level subgoal predictions can utilize Internet scale pretraining and visual understanding to guide the low-level goal-conditioned policy, achieving significantly better generalization and precision than conventional language-conditioned policies. We achieve state-of-the-art results on the CALVIN benchmark, and also demonstrate robust generalization on real-world manipulation tasks, beating strong baselines that have access to privileged information or that utilize orders of magnitude more compute and training data.

However, they often face computational challenges and can falter in generalization, especially in capturing temporal abstractions for long-horizon tasks. To overcome this, we introduce the Hierarchical Diffuser, a simple, fast, yet effective planning method combining the advantages of hierarchical and diffusion-based planning. Our model adopts a “jumpy” planning strategy at the high level, which allows it to have a larger receptive field but at a lower computational cost—a crucial factor for diffusion-based planning methods, as we have empirically verified. Additionally, the jumpy sub-goals guide our low-level planner, facilitating a fine-tuning stage and further improving our approach’s effectiveness. We conducted empirical evaluations on standard offline reinforcement learning benchmarks, demonstrating our method’s superior performance and efficiency in terms of training and planning speed compared to the non-hierarchical Diffuser as well as other hierarchical planning methods. Moreover, we explore our model’s generalization capability, particularly on how our method improves generalization capabilities on compositional out-of-distribution tasks. | Chang Chen, Fei Deng, Kenji Kawaguchi, Caglar Gulcehre, Sungjin Ahn |  |

We study the use of stochastic gradient descent for solving this linear system, and show that when done right---by which we mean using specific insights from the optimisation and kernel communities---stochastic gradient descent is highly effective. To that end, we introduce a particularly simple stochastic dual descent algorithm, explain its design in an intuitive manner and illustrate the design choices through a series of ablation studies. Further experiments demonstrate that our new method is highly competitive. In particular, our evaluations on the UCI regression tasks and on Bayesian optimisation set our approach apart from preconditioned conjugate gradients and variational Gaussian process approximations. Moreover, our method places Gaussian process regression on par with state-of-the-art graph neural networks for molecular binding affinity prediction. | Jihao Andreas Lin, Shreyas Padhy, Javier Antorán, Austin Tripp, Alexander Terenin, Csaba Szepesvári, José Miguel HernándezLobato, David Janz |  |

However, it has been difficult to learn robust and generalizable representations within multivariate datasets due to complex inter-channel relationships and dynamic shifts. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for learning spatiotemporal structure and using it to improve the application of transformers to timeseries datasets. Our framework learns a set of group tokens, and builds an instance-specific group embedding (GE) layer that assigns input tokens to a small number of group tokens to incorporate structure into learning. We then introduce a novel architecture, Group-Aware transFormer (GAFormer), which incorporates both spatial and temporal group embeddings to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a number of time-series classification and regression tasks. In evaluations on a number of diverse timeseries datasets, we show that GE on its own can provide a nice enhancement to a number of backbones, and that by coupling spatial and temporal group embeddings, the GAFormer can outperform the existing baselines. Finally, we show how our approach discerns latent structures in data even without information about the spatial ordering of channels, and yields a more interpretable decomposition of spatial and temporal structure underlying complex multivariate datasets. | Jingyun Xiao, Ran Liu, Eva L.

However, its most pronounced improvements (of tens of percent) is rather in the presence of label noise. Understanding SAM's label noise robustness requires a departure from characterizing the robustness of minimas lying in \`\`flatter'' regions of the loss landscape. In particular, the peak performance under label noise occurs with early stopping, far before the loss converges. We decompose SAM's robustness into two effects: one induced by changes to the logit term and the other induced by changes to the network Jacobian. The first can be observed in linear logistic regression where SAM provably up-weights the gradient contribution from clean examples. Although this explicit up-weighting is also observable in neural networks, when we intervene and modify SAM to remove this effect, surprisingly, we see no visible degradation in performance. We infer that SAM's effect in deeper networks is instead explained entirely by the effect SAM has on the network Jacobian. We theoretically derive the implicit regularization induced by this Jacobian effect in two layer linear networks. Motivated by our analysis, we see that cheaper alternatives to SAM that explicitly induce these regularization effects largely recover the benefits in deep networks trained on real-world datasets. | Christina Baek, J.

| 791 |  |  [Revisiting the Last-Iterate Convergence of Stochastic Gradient Methods](https://openreview.net/forum?id=xxaEhwC1I4) |  | 0 | In the past several years, the last-iterate convergence of the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm has triggered people's interest due to its good performance in practice but lack of theoretical understanding. For Lipschitz convex functions, different works have established the optimal $O(\log(1/\delta)\log T/\sqrt{T})$ or $O(\sqrt{\log(1/\delta)/T})$ high-probability convergence rates for the final iterate, where $T$ is the time horizon and $\delta$ is the failure probability. However, to prove these bounds, all the existing works are either limited to compact domains or require almost surely bounded noises. It is natural to ask whether the last iterate of SGD can still guarantee the optimal convergence rate but without these two restrictive assumptions. Besides this important question, there are still lots of theoretical problems lacking an answer. For example, compared with the last-iterate convergence of SGD for non-smooth problems, only few results for smooth optimization have yet been developed. Additionally, the existing results are all limited to a non-composite objective and the standard Euclidean norm. It still remains unclear whether the last-iterate convergence can be provably extended to wider composite optimization and non-Euclidean norms. In this work, to address the issues mentioned above, we revisit the last-iterate convergence of stochastic gradient methods and provide the first unified way to prove the convergence rates both in expectation and in high probability to accommodate general domains, composite objectives, non-Euclidean norms, Lipschitz conditions, smoothness, and (strong) convexity simultaneously. | Zijian Liu, Zhengyuan Zhou |  |
| 792 |  |  [CNN Kernels Can Be the Best Shapelets](https://openreview.net/forum?id=O8ouVV8PjF) |  | 0 | Shapelets and CNN are two typical approaches to model time series. Shapelets aim at finding a set of sub-sequences that extract feature-based interpretable shapes, but may suffer from accuracy and efficiency issues. CNN performs well by encoding sequences with a series of hidden representations, but lacks interpretability. In this paper, we demonstrate that shapelets are essentially equivalent to a specific type of CNN kernel with a squared norm and pooling. Based on this finding, we propose ShapeConv, an interpretable CNN layer with its kernel serving as shapelets to conduct time-series modeling tasks in both supervised and unsupervised settings. By incorporating shaping regularization, we enforce the similarity for maximum interpretability. We also find human knowledge can be easily injected to ShapeConv by adjusting its initialization and model performance is boosted with it. Experiments show that ShapeConv can achieve state-of-the-art performance on time-series benchmarks without sacrificing interpretability and controllability. | Eric Qu, Yansen Wang, Xufang Luo, Wenqiang He, Kan Ren, Dongsheng Li |  |

Yet language models are prone to making convincing but factually inaccurate claims, often referred to as \`hallucinations.' These errors can inadvertently spread misinformation or harmfully perpetuate misconceptions. Further, manual fact-checking of model responses is a time-consuming process, making human factuality labels expensive to acquire. In this work, we fine-tune language models to be more factual, without human labeling and targeting more open-ended generation settings than past work. We leverage two key recent innovations in NLP to do so. First, several recent works have proposed methods for judging the factuality of open-ended text by measuring consistency with an external knowledge base or simply a large model's confidence scores. Second, the Direct Preference Optimization algorithm enables straightforward fine-tuning of language models on objectives other than supervised imitation, using a preference ranking over possible model responses. We show that learning from automatically generated factuality preference rankings, generated either through existing retrieval systems or our novel retrieval-free approach, significantly improves the factuality (percent of generated claims that are correct) of Llama-2 on held-out topics compared with RLHF or decoding strategies targeted at factuality. At 7B scale, compared to Llama-2-Chat, we observe 53% and 50% reduction in factual error rate when generating biographies and answering medical questions, respectively.

Previous efforts have aimed to establish their connections, revealing equivalences in specific formulations. This paper introduces a new formulation for risk-sensitive MDPs, which assesses risk in a slightly different manner compared to the classical Markov risk measure [Ruszczy ́nski 2010], and establishes its equivalence with a class of soft robust MDP (RMDP) problems, including the standard RMDP as a special case. Leveraging this equivalence, we further derive the policy gradient theorem for both problems, proving gradient domination and global convergence of the exact policy gradient method under the tabular setting with direct parameterization. This forms a sharp contrast to the Markov risk measure, known to be potentially non-gradient-dominant [Huang et al. 2021]. We also propose a sample-based offline learning algorithm, namely the robust fitted-Z iteration (RFZI), for a specific soft RMDP problem with a KL-divergence regularization term (or equivalently the risk-sensitive MDP with an entropy risk measure). We showcase its streamlined design and less stringent assumptions due to the equivalence and analyze its sample complexity. | Runyu Zhang, Yang Hu, Na Li |  |
| 795 |  |  [Tensor Programs VI: Feature Learning in Infinite Depth Neural Networks](https://openreview.net/forum?id=17pVDnpwwl) |  | 0 | Empirical studies have consistently demonstrated that increasing the size of neural networks often yields superior performance in practical applications. However, there is a lack of consensus regarding the appropriate scaling strategy, particularly when it comes to increasing the depth of neural networks. In practice, excessively large depths can lead to model performance degradation. In this paper, we introduce Depth-$\mu$P, a principled approach for depth scaling, allowing for the training of arbitrarily deep architectures while maximizing feature learning and diversity among nearby layers. Our method involves dividing the contribution of each residual block and the parameter update by the square root of the depth. Through the use of Tensor Programs, we rigorously establish the existence of a limit for infinitely deep neural networks under the proposed scaling scheme. This scaling strategy ensures more stable training for deep neural networks and guarantees the transferability of hyperparameters from shallow to deep models. To substantiate the efficacy of our scaling method, we conduct empirical validation on neural networks with depths up to $2^{10}$. | Greg Yang, Dingli Yu, Chen Zhu, Soufiane Hayou |  |

Such attacks involve embedding triggers within a learning model with the intention of causing malicious behavior when an active trigger is present while maintaining regular functionality without it. This paper derives a fundamental understanding of backdoor attacks that applies to both discriminative and generative models, including diffusion models and large language models. We evaluate the effectiveness of any backdoor attack incorporating a constant trigger, by establishing tight lower and upper boundaries for the performance of the compromised model on both clean and backdoor test data. The developed theory answers a series of fundamental but previously underexplored problems, including (1) what are the determining factors for a backdoor attack's success, (2) what is the direction of the most effective backdoor attack, and (3) when will a human-imperceptible trigger succeed. We demonstrate the theory by conducting experiments using benchmark datasets and state-of-the-art backdoor attack scenarios.

One challenge arises from the suboptimal AI policies due to the inadequate consideration of humans disregarding AI recommendations, as well as the need for AI to provide advice selectively when it is most pertinent. This paper presents a sequential decision-making model that (i) takes into account the human's adherence level (the probability that the human follows/rejects machine advice) and (ii) incorporates a defer option so that the machine can temporarily refrain from making advice. We provide learning algorithms that learn the optimal advice policy and make advice only at critical time stamps. Compared to problem-agnostic reinforcement learning algorithms, our specialized learning algorithms not only enjoy better theoretical convergence properties but also show strong empirical performance. | Guanting Chen, Xiaocheng Li, Chunlin Sun, Hanzhao Wang |  |
| 798 |  |  [Beyond Spatio-Temporal Representations: Evolving Fourier Transform for Temporal Graphs](https://openreview.net/forum?id=uvFhCUPjtI) |  | 0 | We present the Evolving Graph Fourier Transform (EFT), the first invertible spectral transform that captures evolving representations on temporal graphs. We motivate our work by the inadequacy of existing methods for capturing the evolving graph spectra, which are also computationally expensive due to the temporal aspect along with the graph vertex domain. We view the problem as an optimization over the Laplacian of the continuous time dynamic graph. Additionally, we propose pseudo-spectrum relaxations that decompose the transformation process, making it highly computationally efficient. The EFT method adeptly captures the evolving graph's structural and positional properties, making it effective for downstream tasks on evolving graphs. Hence, as a reference implementation, we develop a simple neural model induced with \eft for capturing evolving graph spectra. We empirically validate our theoretical findings on a number of large-scale and standard temporal graph benchmarks and demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance. | Anson Bastos, Kuldeep Singh, Abhishek Nadgeri, Manish Singh, Toyotaro Suzumura |  |

Existing approaches facilitate object discovery by representing objects as fixed-size vectors, called \`\`slots'' or \`\`object files''. While these approaches have shown promise in certain scenarios, they still exhibit certain limitations. First, they rely on architectural priors which can be unreliable and usually require meticulous engineering to identify the correct objects. Second, there has been a notable gap in investigating the practical utility of these representations in downstream tasks. To address the first limitation, we introduce a method that explicitly optimizes the constraint that each object in a scene should be associated with a distinct slot. We formalize this constraint by introducing consistency objectives which are cyclic in nature. By integrating these consistency objectives into various existing slot-based object-centric methods, we showcase substantial improvements in object-discovery performance. These enhancements consistently hold true across both synthetic and real-world scenes, underscoring the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed approach. To tackle the second limitation, we apply the learned object-centric representations from the proposed method to two downstream reinforcement learning tasks, demonstrating considerable performance enhancements compared to conventional slot-based and monolithic representation learning methods. Our results suggest that the proposed approach not only improves object discovery, but also provides richer features for downstream tasks. | Aniket Rajiv Didolkar, Anirudh Goyal, Yoshua Bengio |  |

However, the precise conditions under which task-optimized networks can autonomously reactivate the same network states responsible for online behavior is poorly understood. In this study, we develop a mathematical framework that outlines sufficient conditions for the emergence of neural reactivation in circuits that encode features of smoothly varying stimuli. We demonstrate mathematically that noisy recurrent networks optimized to track environmental state variables using change-based sensory information naturally develop denoising dynamics, which, in the absence of input, cause the network to revisit state configurations observed during periods of online activity. We validate our findings using numerical experiments on two canonical neuroscience tasks: spatial position estimation based on self-motion cues, and head direction estimation based on angular velocity cues. Overall, our work provides theoretical support for modeling offline reactivation as an emergent consequence of task optimization in noisy neural circuits. | Nanda H.

Behind the success of GNNs lies the backpropagation (BP) algorithm, which is the de facto standard for training deep neural networks (NNs). However, despite its effectiveness, BP imposes several constraints, which are not only biologically implausible, but also limit the scalability, parallelism, and flexibility in learning NNs. Examples of such constraints include storage of neural activities computed in the forward pass for use in the subsequent backward pass, and the dependence of parameter updates on non-local signals. To address these limitations, the forward-forward algorithm (FF) was recently proposed as an alternative to BP in the image classification domain, which trains NNs by performing two forward passes over positive and negative data. Inspired by this advance, we propose ForwardGNN in this work, a new forward learning procedure for GNNs, which avoids the constraints imposed by BP via an effective layer-wise local forward training. ForwardGNN extends the original FF to deal with graph data and GNNs, and makes it possible to operate without generating negative inputs (hence no longer forward-forward). Further, ForwardGNN enables each layer to learn from both the bottom-up and top-down signals without relying on the backpropagation of errors. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show the effectiveness and generality of the proposed forward graph learning framework. We release our code at https://github.com/facebookresearch/forwardgnn. | Namyong Park, Xing Wang, Antoine Simoulin, Shuai Yang, Grey Yang, Ryan A. Rossi, Puja Trivedi, Nesreen K. Ahmed |  |

Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) offer a potential solution by fixing the circuit architecture and optimizing individual gate parameters in an external loop. However, parameter optimization can become intractable, and the overall performance of the algorithm depends heavily on the initially chosen circuit architecture. Several quantum architecture search (QAS) algorithms have been developed to design useful circuit architectures automatically. In the case of parameter optimization alone, noise effects have been observed to dramatically influence the performance of the optimizer and final outcomes, which is a key line of study. However, the effects of noise on the architecture search, which could be just as critical, are poorly understood. This work addresses this gap by introducing a curriculum-based reinforcement learning QAS (CRLQAS) algorithm designed to tackle challenges in realistic VQA deployment. The algorithm incorporates (i) a 3D architecture encoding and restrictions on environment dynamics to explore the search space of possible circuits efficiently, (ii) an episode halting scheme to steer the agent to find shorter circuits, and (iii) a novel variant of simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation as an optimizer for faster convergence. To facilitate studies, we developed an optimized simulator for our algorithm, significantly improving computational efficiency in simulating noisy quantum circuits by employing the Pauli-transfer matrix formalism in the Pauli-Liouville basis. Numerical experiments focusing on quantum chemistry tasks demonstrate that CRLQAS outperforms existing QAS algorithms across several metrics in both noiseless and noisy environments. | Yash J.

Out of the box, CLIP shows stellar zero-shot and few-shot capabilities on a wide range of out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks, which prior works attribute mainly to today's large and comprehensive training dataset (like LAION). However, it is questionable how meaningful terms like out-of-distribution generalization are for CLIP as it seems likely that web-scale datasets like LAION simply contain many samples that are similar to common OOD benchmarks originally designed for ImageNet. To test this hypothesis, we retrain CLIP on pruned LAION splits that replicate ImageNet’s train-test similarity with respect to common OOD benchmarks. While we observe a performance drop on some benchmarks, surprisingly, CLIP’s overall performance remains high. This shows that high train-test similarity is insufficient to explain CLIP’s OOD performance, and other properties of the training data must drive CLIP to learn more generalizable representations. Additionally, by pruning data points that are dissimilar to the OOD benchmarks, we uncover a 100M split of LAION (¼ of its original size) on which CLIP can be trained to match its original OOD performance. | Prasanna Mayilvahanan, Thaddäus Wiedemer, Evgenia Rusak, Matthias Bethge, Wieland Brendel |  |

For every problem considered in the non-monotone setting, the proposed algorithms are either the first with proven sub-linear $\alpha$-regret bounds or have better $\alpha$-regret bounds than the state of the art, where $\alpha$ is a corresponding approximation bound in the offline setting. In the monotone setting, the proposed approach gives state-of-the-art sub-linear $\alpha$-regret bounds among projection-free algorithms in 7 of the 8 considered cases while matching the result of the remaining case. Additionally, this paper addresses semi-bandit and bandit feedback for adversarial DR-submodular optimization, advancing the understanding of this optimization area. | Mohammad Pedramfar, Yididiya Y.

To fill this gap, we conduct systematic experiments studying whether and how different scaling factors, including LLM model size, pretraining data size, new finetuning parameter size and finetuning data size, affect the finetuning performance. We consider two types of finetuning – full-model tuning (FMT) and parameter efficient tuning (PET, including prompt tuning and LoRA), and explore their scaling behaviors in the data-limited regime where the LLM model size substantially outweighs the finetuning data size. Based on two sets of pretrained bilingual LLMs from 1B to 16B and experiments on bilingual machine translation and multilingual summarization benchmarks, we find that 1) LLM finetuning follows a powerbased multiplicative joint scaling law between finetuning data size and each other scaling factor; 2) LLM finetuning benefits more from LLM model scaling than pretraining data scaling, and PET parameter scaling is generally ineffective; and 3) the optimal finetuning method is highly task- and finetuning data-dependent. We hope our findings could shed light on understanding, selecting and developing LLM finetuning methods. | Biao Zhang, Zhongtao Liu, Colin Cherry, Orhan Firat |  |

While machine learning approaches have substantially advanced the field, they often struggle to generalize beyond training data in practical scenarios. The contributions of this work are three-fold. First, we construct PPIRef, the largest and non-redundant dataset of 3D protein-protein interactions, enabling effective large-scale learning. Second, we leverage the PPIRef dataset to pre-train PPIformer, a new SE(3)-equivariant model generalizing across diverse protein-binder variants. We fine-tune PPIformer to predict effects of mutations on protein-protein interactions via a thermodynamically motivated adjustment of the pre-training loss function. Finally, we demonstrate the enhanced generalization of our new PPIformer approach by outperforming other state-of-the-art methods on new, non-leaking splits of standard labeled PPI mutational data and independent case studies optimizing a human antibody against SARS-CoV-2 and increasing the thrombolytic activity of staphylokinase. | Anton Bushuiev, Roman Bushuiev, Petr Kouba, Anatolii Filkin, Marketa Gabrielova, Michal Gabriel, Jirí Sedlár, Tomás Pluskal, Jirí Damborský, Stanislav Mazurenko, Josef Sivic |  |

Memory-augmented LLMs are a promising solution, but current approaches cannot handle long output generation tasks since they (1) only focus on reading memory and reduce its evolution to the concatenation of new memories or (2) use very specialized memories that cannot adapt to other domains. This paper presents L2MAC, the first practical LLM-based general-purpose stored-program automatic computer (von Neumann architecture) framework, an LLM-based multi-agent system, for long and consistent output generation. Its memory has two components: the instruction registry, which is populated with a prompt program to solve the user-given task, and a file store, which will contain the final and intermediate outputs. Each instruction in turn is executed by a separate LLM agent, whose context is managed by a control unit capable of precise memory reading and writing to ensure effective interaction with the entire file store. These components enable L2MAC to generate extensive outputs, bypassing the constraints of the finite context window while producing outputs that fulfill a complex user-specified task. We empirically demonstrate that L2MAC achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating large codebases for system design tasks, significantly outperforming other coding methods in implementing the detailed user-specified task; we show that L2MAC works for general-purpose extensive text-based tasks, such as writing an entire book; and we provide valuable insights into L2MAC's performance improvement over existing methods. | Samuel Holt, Max Ruiz Luyten, Mihaela van der Schaar |  |

On the other hand, COT prompting also poses new vulnerabilities in the form of backdoor attacks, wherein the model will output unintended malicious content under specific backdoor-triggered conditions during inference. Traditional methods for launching backdoor attacks involve either contaminating the training dataset with backdoored instances or directly manipulating the model parameters during deployment. However, these approaches are not practical for commercial LLMs that typically operate via API access. In this paper, we propose BadChain, the first backdoor attack against LLMs employing COT prompting, which does not require access to the training dataset or model parameters and imposes low computational overhead. BadChain leverages the inherent reasoning capabilities of LLMs by inserting a backdoor reasoning step into the sequence of reasoning steps of the model output, thereby altering the final response when a backdoor trigger is embedded in the query prompt. In particular, a subset of demonstrations will be manipulated to incorporate a backdoor reasoning step in COT prompting. Consequently, given any query prompt containing the backdoor trigger, the LLM will be misled to output unintended content. Empirically, we show the effectiveness of BadChain for two COT strategies across four LLMs (Llama2, GPT-3.5, PaLM2, and GPT-4) and six complex benchmark tasks encompassing arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning. We show that the baseline backdoor attacks designed for simpler tasks such as semantic classification will fail on these complicated tasks. In addition, our findings reveal that LLMs endowed with stronger reasoning capabilities exhibit higher susceptibility to BadChain, exemplified by a high average attack success rate of 97.0\% across the six benchmark tasks on GPT-4. We also demonstrate the interpretability of BadChain by showing that the relationship between the trigger and the backdoor reasoning step can be well-explained based on the output of the backdoored model. Finally, we propose two defenses based on shuffling and demonstrate their overall ineffectiveness against BadChain. Therefore, BadChain remains a severe threat to LLMs, underscoring the urgency for the development of robust and effective future defenses. | Zhen Xiang, Fengqing Jiang, Zidi Xiong, Bhaskar Ramasubramanian, Radha Poovendran, Bo Li |  |

Mainstream modern SAT solvers are based on the Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) algorithm. Recent work aimed to enhance CDCL SAT solvers using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, so far this approach either has not made solving more effective, or required substantial GPU resources for frequent online model inferences. Aiming to make GNN improvements practical, this paper proposes an approach called NeuroBack, which builds on two insights: (1) predicting phases (i.e., values) of variables appearing in the majority (or even all) of the satisfying assignments are essential for CDCL SAT solving, and (2) it is sufficient to query the neural model only once for the predictions before the SAT solving starts. Once trained, the offline model inference allows NeuroBack to execute exclusively on the CPU, removing its reliance on GPU resources. To train NeuroBack, a new dataset called DataBack containing 120,286 data samples is created. Finally, NeuroBack is implemented as an enhancement to a state-of-the-art SAT solver called Kissat. As a result, it allowed Kissat to solve 5.2% more problems on the recent SAT competition problem set, SATCOMP-2022. NeuroBack therefore shows how machine learning can be harnessed to improve SAT solving in an effective and practical manner. | Wenxi Wang, Yang Hu, Mohit Tiwari, Sarfraz Khurshid, Kenneth L.

Existing alignment algorithms can be expensive to align for each group, requiring prohibitive amounts of group-specific preference data and computation for real-world use cases. We introduce Group Preference Optimization (GPO), an alignment framework that steers language models to preferences of individual groups in a few-shot manner. In GPO, we augment the base LLM with an independent transformer module trained to predict the preferences of a group for the LLM generations. For few-shot learning, we parameterize this module as an in-context autoregressive transformer and train it via meta-learning on several groups. We empirically validate the efficacy of GPO through rigorous evaluations using LLMs with varied sizes on three human opinion adaptation tasks. These tasks involve adapting to the preferences of US demographic groups, global countries, and individual users. Our results demonstrate that GPO not only aligns models more accurately but also requires fewer group-specific preferences and less training and inference computing resources, outperforming existing strategies such as in-context steering and fine-tuning methods. | Siyan Zhao, John Dang, Aditya Grover |  |
| 811 |  |  [MERT: Acoustic Music Understanding Model with Large-Scale Self-supervised Training](https://openreview.net/forum?id=w3YZ9MSlBu) |  | 0 | Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm for training generalisable models on large-scale data in the fields of vision, text, and speech. Although SSL has been proven effective in speech and audio, its application to music audio has yet to be thoroughly explored. This is partially due to the distinctive challenges associated with modelling musical knowledge, particularly tonal and pitched characteristics of music. To address this research gap, we propose an acoustic \*\*M\*\*usic und\*\*ER\*\*standing model with large-scale self-supervised \*\*T\*\*raining (\*\*MERT\*\*), which incorporates teacher models to provide pseudo labels in the masked language modelling (MLM) style acoustic pre-training. In our exploration, we identified an effective combination of teacher models, which outperforms conventional speech and audio approaches in terms of performance. This combination includes an acoustic teacher based on Residual Vector Quantization - Variational AutoEncoder (RVQ-VAE) and a musical teacher based on the Constant-Q Transform (CQT). Furthermore, we explore a wide range of settings to overcome the instability in acoustic language model pre-training, which allows our designed paradigm to scale from 95M to 330M parameters. Experimental results indicate that our model can generalise and perform well on 14 music understanding tasks and attain state-of-the-art (SOTA) overall scores. | Yizhi Li, Ruibin Yuan, Ge Zhang, Yinghao Ma, Xingran Chen, Hanzhi Yin, Chenghao Xiao, Chenghua Lin, Anton Ragni, Emmanouil Benetos, Norbert Gyenge, Roger B.

While substantial efforts have been made to minimize the cumulative regret in dueling bandits, a notable gap in the current research is the absence of regret bounds that account for the inherent uncertainty in pairwise comparisons between the dueling arms. Intuitively, greater uncertainty suggests a higher level of difficulty in the problem. To bridge this gap, this paper studies the problem of contextual dueling bandits, where the binary comparison of dueling arms is generated from a generalized linear model (GLM). We propose a new SupLinUCB-type algorithm that enjoys computational efficiency and a variance-aware regret bound $\tilde O\big(d\sqrt{\sum_{t=1}^T\sigma_t^2} + d\big)$, where $\sigma_t$ is the variance of the pairwise comparison at round $t$, $d$ is the dimension of the context vectors, and $T$ is the time horizon. Our regret bound naturally aligns with the intuitive expectation — in scenarios where the comparison is deterministic, the algorithm only suffers from an $\tilde O(d)$ regret. We perform empirical experiments on synthetic data to confirm the advantage of our method over previous variance-agnostic algorithms. | Qiwei Di, Tao Jin, Yue Wu, Heyang Zhao, Farzad Farnoud, Quanquan Gu |  |
| 813 |  |  [A Discretization Framework for Robust Contextual Stochastic Optimization](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ueTdErd5Ib) |  | 0 | We study contextual stochastic optimization problems. Optimization problems have uncertain parameters stemming from unknown, context-dependent, distributions. Due to the inherent uncertainty in these problems, one is often interested not only in minimizing expected cost, but also to be robust and protect against worst case scenarios. We propose a novel method that combines the learning stage with knowledge of the downstream optimization task. The method prescribes decisions which aim to maximize the likelihood that the cost is below a (user-controlled) threshold. The key idea is (1) to discretize the feasible region into subsets so that the uncertain objective function can be well approximated deterministically within each subset, and (2) devise a secondary optimization problem to prescribe decisions by integrating the individual approximations determined in step (1). We provide theoretical guarantees bounding the underlying regret of decisions proposed by our method. In addition, experimental results demonstrate that our approach is competitive in terms of average regret and yields more robust solutions than other methods proposed in the literature, including up to 20 times lower worst-case cost on a real-world electricity generation problem. | Rares Cristian, Georgia Perakis |  |

However, existing optimization theory can only explain the faster convergence of ASGD, but cannot explain its better generalization. In this paper, we study the generalization of ASGD for overparameterized linear regression, which is possibly the simplest setting of learning with overparameterization. We establish an instance-dependent excess risk bound for ASGD within each eigen-subspace of the data covariance matrix. Our analysis shows that (i) ASGD outperforms SGD in the subspace of small eigenvalues, exhibiting a faster rate of exponential decay for bias error, while in the subspace of large eigenvalues, its bias error decays slower than SGD; and (ii) the variance error of ASGD is always larger than that of SGD. Our result suggests that ASGD can outperform SGD when the difference between the initialization and the true weight vector is mostly confined to the subspace of small eigenvalues. Additionally, when our analysis is specialized to linear regression in the strongly convex setting, it yields a tighter bound for bias error than the best-known result. | Xuheng Li, Yihe Deng, Jingfeng Wu, Dongruo Zhou, Quanquan Gu |  |

This geometry depends on the structure of the inputs, the structure of the target outputs, and on the architecture of the network. By studying the learning dynamics of networks with one hidden layer, we discovered that the network's activation function has an unexpectedly strong impact on the representational geometry: Tanh networks tend to learn representations that reflect the structure of the target outputs, while ReLU networks retain more information about the structure of the raw inputs. This difference is consistently observed across a broad class of parameterized tasks in which we modulated the degree of alignment between the geometry of the task inputs and that of the task labels. We analyzed the learning dynamics in weight space and show how the differences between the networks with Tanh and ReLU nonlinearities arise from the asymmetric saturation of ReLU, which leads feature neurons to specialize for different regions of input space. Feature neurons in Tanh networks, by contrast, tend to inherit the task label structure. Consequently, when the target outputs are low dimensional, Tanh networks generate neural representations that are more disentangled than those obtained with a ReLU nonlinearity. Our findings shed light on the interplay between input-output geometry, nonlinearity, and learned representations in neural networks. | Matteo Alleman, Jack W. Lindsey, Stefano Fusi |  |

We first show that it is possible to backpropagate the reward function gradient through the full sampling procedure, and that doing so achieves strong performance on a variety of rewards, outperforming reinforcement learning-based approaches. We then propose more efficient variants of DRaFT: DRaFT-K, which truncates backpropagation to only the last K steps of sampling, and DRaFT-LV, which obtains lower-variance gradient estimates for the case when K=1. We show that our methods work well for a variety of reward functions and can be used to substantially improve the aesthetic quality of images generated by Stable Diffusion 1.4. Finally, we draw connections between our approach and prior work, providing a unifying perspective on the design space of gradient-based fine-tuning algorithms. | Kevin Clark, Paul Vicol, Kevin Swersky, David J.

Despite its significant importance, the fundamental question of \`\`what are the most effective algorithms for OOD generalization'' remains open even under the standard setting of covariate shift. This paper addresses this fundamental question by proving that, surprisingly, classical Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) purely using source data (without any modification) achieves the \*minimax\* optimality for covariate shift under the \*well-specified\* setting. That is, \*no\* algorithm performs better than MLE in this setting (up to a constant factor), justifying MLE is all you need. Our result holds for a very rich class of parametric models, and does not require any boundedness condition on the density ratio. We illustrate the wide applicability of our framework by instantiating it to three concrete examples---linear regression, logistic regression, and phase retrieval. This paper further complement the study by proving that, under the \*misspecified setting\*, MLE is no longer the optimal choice, whereas Maximum Weighted Likelihood Estimator (MWLE) emerges as minimax optimal in certain scenarios. | Jiawei Ge, Shange Tang, Jianqing Fan, Cong Ma, Chi Jin |  |
| 819 |  |  [Differentiable Learning of Generalized Structured Matrices for Efficient Deep Neural Networks](https://openreview.net/forum?id=pAVJKp3Dvn) |  | 0 | This paper investigates efficient deep neural networks (DNNs) to replace dense unstructured weight matrices with structured ones that possess desired properties. The challenge arises because the optimal weight matrix structure in popular neural network models is obscure in most cases and may vary from layer to layer even in the same network. Prior structured matrices proposed for efficient DNNs were mostly hand-crafted without a generalized framework to systematically learn them. To address this issue, we propose a generalized and differentiable framework to learn efficient structures of weight matrices by gradient descent. We first define a new class of structured matrices that covers a wide range of structured matrices in the literature by adjusting the structural parameters. Then, the frequency-domain differentiable parameterization scheme based on the Gaussian-Dirichlet kernel is adopted to learn the structural parameters by proximal gradient descent. On the image and language tasks, our method learns efficient DNNs with structured matrices, achieving lower complexity and/or higher performance than prior approaches that employ low-rank, block-sparse, or block-low-rank matrices. | Changwoo Lee, HunSeok Kim |  |

However, the training of Generative Ad- versarial Networks remains challenging, often resulting in issues like mode col- lapse. While diffusion models have demonstrated progress in generating qual- ity synthetic samples for tabular EHRs given ample denoising steps, their perfor- mance wanes when confronted with missing modalities in heterogeneous tabular EHRs data. For example, some EHRs contain solely static measurements, and some contain only contain temporal measurements, or a blend of both data types. To bridge this gap, we introduce FLEXGEN-EHR– a versatile diffusion model tai- lored for heterogeneous tabular EHRs, equipped with the capability of handling missing modalities in an integrative learning framework. We define an optimal transport module to align and accentuate the common feature space of hetero- geneity of EHRs. We empirically show that our model consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art synthetic EHR generation methods both in fidelity by up to 3.10% and utility by up to 7.16%. Additionally, we show that our method can be successfully used in privacy-sensitive settings, where the original patient-level data cannot be shared. | Huan He, William Hao, Yuanzhe Xi, Yong Chen, Bradley A.

| 821 |  |  [Designing Skill-Compatible AI: Methodologies and Frameworks in Chess](https://openreview.net/forum?id=79rfgv3jw4) |  | 0 | Powerful artificial intelligence systems are often used in settings where they must interact with agents that are computationally much weaker, for example when they work alongside humans or operate in complex environments where some tasks are handled by algorithms, heuristics, or other entities of varying computational power. For AI agents to successfully interact in these settings, however, achieving superhuman performance alone is not sufficient; they also need to account for suboptimal actions or idiosyncratic style from their less-skilled counterparts. We propose a formal evaluation framework for assessing the compatibility of near-optimal AI with interaction partners who may have much lower levels of skill; we use popular collaborative chess variants as model systems to study and develop AI agents that can successfully interact with lower-skill entities. Traditional chess engines designed to output near-optimal moves prove to be inadequate partners when paired with engines of various lower skill levels in this domain, as they are not designed to consider the presence of other agents. We contribute three methodologies to explicitly create skill-compatible AI agents in complex decision-making settings, and two chess game frameworks designed to foster collaboration between powerful AI agents and less-skilled partners. On these frameworks, our agents outperform state-of-the-art chess AI (based on AlphaZero) despite being weaker in conventional chess, demonstrating that skill-compatibility is a tangible trait that is qualitatively and measurably distinct from raw performance. Our evaluations further explore and clarify the mechanisms by which our agents achieve skill-compatibility. | Karim Hamade, Reid McIlroyYoung, Siddhartha Sen, Jon M. Kleinberg, Ashton Anderson |  |

However, in numerous realistic applications such as robotics or healthcare, actions are performed with a delay whose value can even be stochastic. In this work, we introduce stochastic delayed execution MDPs, a new formalism addressing random delays without resorting to state augmentation. We show that given observed delay values, it is sufficient to perform a policy search in the class of Markov policies in order to reach optimal performance, thus extending the deterministic fixed delay case. Armed with this insight, we devise DEZ, a model-based algorithm that optimizes over the class of Markov policies. DEZ leverages Monte-Carlo tree search similar to its non-delayed variant EfficientZero to accurately infer future states from the action queue. Thus, it handles delayed execution while preserving the sample efficiency of EfficientZero. Through empirical analysis, we stress that none of the prior benchmarks consistently outperforms others across different delays. We demonstrate that our algorithm surpasses all benchmark methods in Atari games when dealing with constant or stochastic delays.

However, visual models trained to detect new objects during inference have been unable to replicate this ability, and instead either perform poorly or require meta-training and/or fine-tuning on similar objects. In this work, we propose a meta-learning algorithm that emulates Large Language Models by learning new visual concepts during inference without fine-tuning. Our approach leverages a frozen pre-trained feature extractor, and analogous to in-context learning, recasts meta-learning as sequence modeling over datapoints with known labels and a test datapoint with an unknown label. On 8 out of 11 meta-learning benchmarks, our approach---without meta-training or fine-tuning---exceeds or matches the state-of-the-art algorithm, P>M>F, which is meta-trained on these benchmarks. | Christopher Fifty, Dennis Duan, Ronald G.

| 824 |  |  [Beyond Accuracy: Evaluating Self-Consistency of Code Large Language Models with IdentityChain](https://openreview.net/forum?id=caW7LdAALh) |  | 0 | Code Large Language Models (Code LLMs) are being increasingly employed in real-life applications, so evaluating them is critical. While the conventional accuracy evaluates the performance of Code LLMs on a set of individual tasks, their self-consistency across different tasks is overlooked. Intuitively, a trustworthy model should be self-consistent when generating natural language specifications for its own code and generating code for its own specifications. Failure to preserve self-consistency reveals a lack of understanding of the shared semantics underlying natural language and programming language, and therefore undermines the trustworthiness of a model. In this paper, we first formally define the self-consistency of Code LLMs and then design a framework, IdentityChain, which effectively and efficiently evaluates the self-consistency and conventional accuracy of a model at the same time. We study eleven Code LLMs and show that they fail to preserve self-consistency, which is indeed a distinct aspect from conventional accuracy. Furthermore, we show that IdentityChain can be used as a model debugging tool to expose weaknesses of Code LLMs by demonstrating three major weaknesses that we identify in current models using IdentityChain.

The chain we study is a unified framework for theoretical analysis. It comes with almost arbitrary isotropic and state-dependent noise instead of normal and state-independent one as in most related papers. Moreover, in our chain the drift and diffusion coefficient can be inexact in order to cover wide range of applications as Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics, sampling, Stochastic Gradient Descent or Stochastic Gradient Boosting. We prove the bound in $\mathcal{W}_{2}$-distance between the laws of our Ito chain and corresponding differential equation. These results improve or cover most of the known estimates. And for some particular cases, our analysis is the first. | Aleksei Ustimenko, Aleksandr Beznosikov |  |

In standard models of bounded rationality, sub-optimal decision-making is simulated by adding homoscedastic noise to optimal decisions rather than actually simulating constrained inference. In this work, we introduce a latent inference budget model (L-IBM) that models these constraints explicitly, via a latent variable (inferred jointly with a model of agents’ goals) that controls the runtime of an iterative inference algorithm. L-IBMs make it possible to learn agent models using data from diverse populations of suboptimal actors. In three modeling tasks—inferring navigation goals from routes, inferring communicative intents from human utterances, and predicting next moves in human chess games—we show that L-IBMs match or outperforms Boltzmann models of decision-making under uncertainty. Moreover, the inferred inference budgets are themselves meaningful, efficient to compute, and correlated with measures of player skill, partner skill and task difficulty. | Athul Paul Jacob, Abhishek Gupta, Jacob Andreas |  |
| 827 |  |  [The Effectiveness of Random Forgetting for Robust Generalization](https://openreview.net/forum?id=MEGQGNUfPx) |  | 0 | Deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial attacks, which can compromise their performance and accuracy. Adversarial Training (AT) has emerged as a popular approach for protecting neural networks against such attacks. However, a key challenge of AT is robust overfitting, where the network's robust performance on test data deteriorates with further training, thus hindering generalization. Motivated by the concept of active forgetting in the brain, we introduce a novel learning paradigm called "Forget to Mitigate Overfitting (FOMO)". FOMO alternates between the forgetting phase, which randomly forgets a subset of weights and regulates the model's information through weight reinitialization, and the relearning phase, which emphasizes learning generalizable features. Our experiments on benchmark datasets and adversarial attacks show that FOMO alleviates robust overfitting by significantly reducing the gap between the best and last robust test accuracy while improving the state-of-the-art robustness. Furthermore, FOMO provides a better trade-off between the standard and robust accuracy outperforming baseline adversarial methods. Finally, our framework is robust to AutoAttacks and increases generalization in many real-world scenarios. | Vijaya Raghavan T. Ramkumar, Bahram Zonooz, Elahe Arani |  |

However, defining an efficient discrepancy between predicted and target meshes remains an open problem. A prevalent approach in current deep learning is the set-based approach which measures the discrepancy between two surfaces by comparing two randomly sampled point-clouds from the two meshes with Chamfer pseudo-distance. Nevertheless, the set-based approach still has limitations such as lacking a theoretical guarantee for choosing the number of points in sampled point-clouds, and the pseudo-metricity and the quadratic complexity of the Chamfer divergence. To address these issues, we propose a novel metric for learning mesh deformation. The metric is defined by sliced Wasserstein distance on meshes represented as probability measures that generalize the set-based approach. By leveraging probability measure space, we gain flexibility in encoding meshes using diverse forms of probability measures, such as continuous, empirical, and discrete measures via \textit{varifold} representation. After having encoded probability measures, we can compare meshes by using the sliced Wasserstein distance which is an effective optimal transport distance with linear computational complexity and can provide a fast statistical rate for approximating the surface of meshes. To the end, we employ a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) to deform the input surface into the target shape by modeling the trajectories of the points on the surface. Our experiments on cortical surface reconstruction demonstrate that our approach surpasses other competing methods in multiple datasets and metrics. | ThanhTung Le, Khai Nguyen, Shanlin Sun, Kun Han, Nhat Ho, Xiaohui Xie |  |
| 829 |  |  [Lie Group Decompositions for Equivariant Neural Networks](https://openreview.net/forum?id=p34fRKp8qA) |  | 0 | Invariance and equivariance to geometrical transformations have proven to be very useful inductive biases when training (convolutional) neural network models, especially in the low-data regime. Much work has focused on the case where the symmetry group employed is compact or abelian, or both. Recent work has explored enlarging the class of transformations used to the case of Lie groups, principally through the use of their Lie algebra, as well as the group exponential and logarithm maps. The applicability of such methods to larger transformation groups is limited by the fact that depending on the group of interest $G$, the exponential map may not be surjective. Further limitations are encountered when $G$ is neither compact nor abelian. Using the structure and geometry of Lie groups and their homogeneous spaces, we present a framework by which it is possible to work with such groups primarily focusing on the Lie groups $G = \textnormal{GL}^{+}(n, \mathbb{R})$ and $G = \textnormal{SL}(n, \mathbb{R})$, as well as their representation as affine transformations $\mathbb{R}^{n} \rtimes G$. Invariant integration as well as a global parametrization is realized by decomposing the "larger" groups into subgroups and submanifolds which can be handled individually. Under this framework, we show how convolution kernels can be parametrized to build models equivariant with respect to affine transformations. We evaluate the robustness and out-of-distribution generalisation capability of our model on the standard affine-invariant benchmark classification task, where we outperform all previous equivariant models as well as all Capsule Network proposals. | Mircea Mironenco, Patrick Forré |  |
| 830 |  |  [Efficient Heterogeneous Meta-Learning via Channel Shuffling Modulation](https://openreview.net/forum?id=QiJuMJl0QS) |  | 0 | We tackle the problem of meta-learning across heterogenous tasks. This problem seeks to extract and generalize transferable meta-knowledge through streaming task sets from a multi-modal task distribution. The extracted meta-knowledge can be used to create predictors for new tasks using a small number of labeled samples. Most meta-learning methods assume a homogeneous task distribution, thus limiting their generalization capacity when handling multi-modal task distributions. Recent work has shown that the generalization of meta-learning depends on the similarity of tasks in the training distribution, and this has led to many clustering approaches that aim to detect homogeneous clusters of tasks. However, these methods suffer from a significant increase in parameter complexity. To overcome this weakness, we propose a new heterogeneous meta-learning strategy that efficiently captures the multi-modality of the task distribution via modulating the routing between convolution channels in the network, instead of directly modulating the network weights. This new mechanism can be cast as a permutation learning problem. We further introduce a novel neural permutation layer based on the classical Benes routing network, which has sub-quadratic parameter complexity in the total number of channels, as compared to the quadratic complexity of the state-of-the-art Gumbel-Sinkhorn layer. We demonstrate our approach on various multi-modal meta-learning benchmarks, showing that our framework outperforms previous methods in both generalization accuracy and convergence speed. | Minh Hoang, Carl Kingsford |  |

In general, it is very difficult to know if the network has memorized a particular set of examples or understood the underlying rule (or both). Motivated by this challenge, we study an interpretable model where generalizing representations are understood analytically, and are easily distinguishable from the memorizing ones. Namely, we consider multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and Transformer architectures trained on modular arithmetic tasks, where ($\xi \cdot 100\\%$) of labels are corrupted (\*i.e.\* some results of the modular operations in the training set are incorrect). We show that (i) it is possible for the network to memorize the corrupted labels \*and\* achieve $100\\%$ generalization at the same time; (ii) the memorizing neurons can be identified and pruned, lowering the accuracy on corrupted data and improving the accuracy on uncorrupted data; (iii) regularization methods such as weight decay, dropout and BatchNorm force the network to ignore the corrupted data during optimization, and achieve $100\\%$ accuracy on the uncorrupted dataset; and (iv) the effect of these regularization methods is ("mechanistically") interpretable: weight decay and dropout force all the neurons to learn generalizing representations, while BatchNorm de-amplifies the output of memorizing neurons and amplifies the output of the generalizing ones. Finally, we show that in the presence of regularization, the training dynamics involves two consecutive stages: first, the network undergoes \*grokking\* dynamics reaching high train \*and\* test accuracy; second, it unlearns the memorizing representations, where the train accuracy suddenly jumps from $100\\%$ to $100 (1-\xi)\\%$. | Darshil Doshi, Aritra Das, Tianyu He, Andrey Gromov |  |
| 832 |  |  [VCR-Graphormer: A Mini-batch Graph Transformer via Virtual Connections](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SUUrkC3STJ) |  | 0 | Graph transformer has been proven as an effective graph learning method for its adoption of attention mechanism that is capable of capturing expressive representations from complex topological and feature information of graphs. Graph transformer conventionally performs dense attention (or global attention) for every pair of nodes to learn node representation vectors, resulting in quadratic computational costs that are unaffordable for large-scale graph data. Therefore, mini-batch training for graph transformers is a promising direction, but limited samples in each mini-batch can not support effective dense attention to encode informative representations. Facing this bottleneck, (1) we start by assigning each node a token list that is sampled by personalized PageRank (PPR) and then apply standard multi-head self-attention only on this list to compute its node representations. This PPR tokenization method decouples model training from complex graph topological information and makes heavy feature engineering offline and independent, such that mini-batch training of graph transformers is possible by loading each node's token list in batches. We further prove this PPR tokenization is viable as a graph convolution network with a fixed polynomial filter and jumping knowledge. However, only using personalized PageRank may limit information carried by a token list, which could not support different graph inductive biases for model training. To this end, (2) we rewire graphs by introducing multiple types of virtual connections through structure- and content-based super nodes that enable PPR tokenization to encode local and global contexts, long-range interaction, and heterophilous information into each node's token list, and then formalize our $\underline{\textbf{V}}$irtual $\underline{\textbf{C}}$onnection $\underline{\textbf{R}}$anking based $\underline{\textbf{Graph}}$ Trans$\underline{\textbf{former}}$ (VCR-Graphormer). Overall, VCR-Graphormer needs $O(m+klogk)$ complexity for graph tokenization as compared to $O(n^{3})$ of previous works.

Such a setting involves independent evaluations of the objective function and constraints at different inputs, and is hence a relaxation of the commonly-studied coupled setting where functions must be evaluated together. As a result, the decoupled setting requires an adaptive selection between evaluating either the objective function or a constraint, in addition to selecting an input (in the coupled setting). This paper presents a novel constrained BO algorithm with a provable performance guarantee that can address the above relaxed setting. Specifically, it considers the fundamental trade-off between exploration and exploitation in constrained BO, and, interestingly, affords a noteworthy connection to active learning. The performance of our proposed algorithms is also empirically evaluated using several synthetic and real-world optimization problems. | Quoc Phong Nguyen, Wan Theng Ruth Chew, Le Song, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low, Patrick Jaillet |  |

Consequently, this ignited an ongoing arms race between malware authors and antivirus systems, compelling researchers to propose defenses for malware-detection models against evasion attacks. However, most if not all existing defenses against evasion attacks suffer from sizable performance degradation and/or can defend against only specific attacks, which makes them less practical in real-world settings. In this work, we develop a certified defense, DRSM (De-Randomized Smoothed MalConv), by redesigning the \*de-randomized smoothing\* technique for the domain of malware detection. Specifically, we propose a \*window ablation\* scheme to provably limit the impact of adversarial bytes while maximally preserving local structures of the executables. After showing how DRSM is theoretically robust against attacks with contiguous adversarial bytes, we verify its performance and certified robustness experimentally, where we observe only marginal accuracy drops as the cost of robustness. To our knowledge, we are the first to offer certified robustness in the realm of static detection of malware executables. More surprisingly, through evaluating DRSM against $9$ empirical attacks of different types, we observe that the proposed defense is empirically robust to some extent against a diverse set of attacks, some of which even fall out of the scope of its original threat model. In addition, we collected $15.5K$ recent benign raw executables from diverse sources, which will be made public as a dataset called PACE (Publicly Accessible Collection(s) of Executables) to alleviate the scarcity of publicly available benign datasets for studying malware detection and provide future research with more representative data of the time.

We contribute the following results towards understanding this variation. (1) Despite having significant variance on their test-sets, we demonstrate that standard CIFAR-10 and ImageNet trainings have little variance in their performance on the test-distributions from which their test-sets are sampled. (2) We introduce the independent errors assumption and show that it suffices to recover the structure and variance of the empirical accuracy distribution across repeated runs of training. (3) We prove that test-set variance is unavoidable given the observation that ensembles of identically trained networks are calibrated (Jiang et al., 2021), and demonstrate that the variance of binary classification trainings closely follows a simple formula based on the error rate and number of test examples.

| 836 |  |  [Large Language Models to Enhance Bayesian Optimization](https://openreview.net/forum?id=OOxotBmGol) |  | 0 | Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful approach for optimizing complex and expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions. Its importance is underscored in many applications, notably including hyperparameter tuning, but its efficacy depends on efficiently balancing exploration and exploitation. While there has been substantial progress in BO methods, striking this balance remains a delicate process. In this light, we present \texttt{LLAMBO}, a novel approach that integrates the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM) within BO. At a high level, we frame the BO problem in natural language, enabling LLMs to iteratively \emph{propose} and \emph{evaluate} promising solutions conditioned on historical evaluations. More specifically, we explore how combining contextual understanding, few-shot learning proficiency, and domain knowledge of LLMs can improve model-based BO. Our findings illustrate that \texttt{LLAMBO} is effective at zero-shot warmstarting, and enhances surrogate modeling and candidate sampling, especially in the early stages of search when observations are sparse. Our approach is performed in context and does not require LLM finetuning. Additionally, it is modular by design, allowing individual components to be integrated into existing BO frameworks, or function cohesively as an end-to-end method. We empirically validate \texttt{LLAMBO}'s efficacy on the problem of hyperparameter tuning, highlighting strong empirical performance across a range of diverse benchmarks, proprietary, and synthetic tasks. | Tennison Liu, Nicolás Astorga, Nabeel Seedat, Mihaela van der Schaar |  |
| 837 |  |  [Towards Identifiable Unsupervised Domain Translation: A Diversified Distribution Matching Approach](https://openreview.net/forum?id=55uj7mU7Cv) |  | 0 | Unsupervised domain translation (UDT) aims to find functions that convert samples from one domain (e.g., sketches) to another domain (e.g., photos) without changing the high-level semantic meaning (also referred to as "content"). The translation functions are often sought by probability distribution matching of the transformed source domain and target domain. CycleGAN stands as arguably the most representative approach among this line of work. However, it was noticed in the literature that CycleGAN and variants could fail to identify the desired translation functions and produce content-misaligned translations. This limitation arises due to the presence of multiple translation functions---referred to as \`\`measure-preserving automorphism" (MPA)---in the solution space of the learning criteria. Despite awareness of such identifiability issues, solutions have remained elusive. This study delves into the core identifiability inquiry and introduces an MPA elimination theory. Our analysis shows that MPA is unlikely to exist, if multiple pairs of diverse cross-domain conditional distributions are matched by the learning function. Our theory leads to a UDT learner using distribution matching over auxiliary variable-induced subsets of the domains---other than over the entire data domains as in the classical approaches. The proposed framework is the first to rigorously establish translation identifiability under reasonable UDT settings, to our best knowledge. Experiments corroborate with our theoretical claims. | Sagar Shrestha, Xiao Fu |  |

While the U-Net architecture with skip connections is commonly used by prior studies to enable multi-scale processing, our analysis shows that the need for features to evolve across layers results in temporally misaligned features in skip connections, which limits the model’s performance. To address this limitation, we propose SineNet, consisting of multiple sequentially connected U-shaped network blocks, referred to as waves. In SineNet, high-resolution features are evolved progressively through multiple stages, thereby reducing the amount of misalignment within each stage. We furthermore analyze the role of skip connections in enabling both parallel and sequential processing of multi-scale information. Our method is rigorously tested on multiple PDE datasets, including the Navier-Stokes equations and shallow water equations, showcasing the advantages of our proposed approach over conventional U-Nets with a comparable parameter budget. We further demonstrate that increasing the number of waves in SineNet while maintaining the same number of parameters leads to a monotonically improved performance. The results highlight the effectiveness of SineNet and the potential of our approach in advancing the state-of-the-art in neural PDE solver design.

Recently, there have been extensive research efforts to explain the decision-making process of GNNs. These efforts often focus on explaining why a certain prediction is made for a particular instance, or what discriminative features the GNNs try to detect for each class. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no existing study on understanding the decision boundaries of GNNs, even though the decision-making process of GNNs is directly determined by the decision boundaries. To bridge this research gap, we propose a model-level explainability method called GNNBoundary, which attempts to gain deeper insights into the decision boundaries of graph classifiers. Specifically, we first develop an algorithm to identify the pairs of classes whose decision regions are adjacent. For an adjacent class pair, the near-boundary graphs between them are effectively generated by optimizing a novel objective function specifically designed for boundary graph generation. Thus, by analyzing the nearboundary graphs, the important characteristics of decision boundaries can be uncovered. To evaluate the efficacy of GNNBoundary, we conduct experiments on both synthetic and public real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that, via the analysis of faithful near-boundary graphs generated by GNNBoundary, we can thoroughly assess the robustness and generalizability of the explained GNNs. The official implementation can be found at https://github.com/yolandalalala/GNNBoundary. | Xiaoqi Wang, HanWei Shen |  |

The design of sparse RSNNs with fewer neurons and synapses helps reduce the computational complexity of RSNNs. Traditionally, sparse SNNs are obtained by first training a dense and complex SNN for a target task and, next, eliminating neurons with low activity (activity-based pruning) while maintaining task performance. In contrast, this paper presents a task-agnostic methodology for designing sparse RSNNs by pruning an untrained (arbitrarily initialized) large model. We introduce a novel Lyapunov Noise Pruning (LNP) algorithm that uses graph sparsification methods and utilizes Lyapunov exponents to design a stable sparse RSNN from an untrained RSNN. We show that the LNP can leverage diversity in neuronal timescales to design a sparse Heterogeneous RSNN (HRSNN). Further, we show that the same sparse HRSNN model can be trained for different tasks, such as image classification and time-series prediction. The experimental results show that, in spite of being task-agnostic, LNP increases computational efficiency (fewer neurons and synapses) and prediction performance of RSNNs compared to traditional activity-based pruning of trained dense models. | Biswadeep Chakraborty, Beomseok Kang, Harshit Kumar, Saibal Mukhopadhyay |  |
| 841 |  |  [Investigating the Benefits of Projection Head for Representation Learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=GgEAdqYPNA) |  | 0 | An effective technique for obtaining high-quality representations is adding a projection head on top of the encoder during training, then discarding it and using the pre-projection representations. Despite its proven practical effectiveness, the reason behind the success of this technique is poorly understood. The pre-projection representations are not directly optimized by the loss function, raising the question: what makes them better? In this work, we provide a rigorous theoretical answer to this question. We start by examining linear models trained with self-supervised contrastive loss. We reveal that the implicit bias of training algorithms leads to layer-wise progressive feature weighting, where features become increasingly unequal as we go deeper into the layers. Consequently, lower layers tend to have more normalized and less specialized representations. We theoretically characterize scenarios where such representations are more beneficial, highlighting the intricate interplay between data augmentation and input features. Additionally, we demonstrate that introducing non-linearity into the network allows lower layers to learn features that are completely absent in higher layers. Finally, we show how this mechanism improves the robustness in supervised contrastive learning and supervised learning. We empirically validate our results through various experiments on CIFAR-10/100, UrbanCars and shifted versions of ImageNet. We also introduce a potential alternative to projection head, which offers a more interpretable and controllable design. | Yihao Xue, Eric Gan, Jiayi Ni, Siddharth Joshi, Baharan Mirzasoleiman |  |
| 842 |  |  [A Variational Perspective on Solving Inverse Problems with Diffusion Models](https://openreview.net/forum?id=1YO4EE3SPB) |  | 0 | Diffusion models have emerged as a key pillar of foundation models in visual domains. One of their critical applications is to universally solve different downstream inverse tasks via a single diffusion prior without re-training for each task. Most inverse tasks can be formulated as inferring a posterior distribution over data (e.g., a full image) given a measurement (e.g., a masked image). This is however challenging in diffusion models since the nonlinear and iterative nature of the diffusion process renders the posterior intractable. To cope with this challenge, we propose a variational approach that by design seeks to approximate the true posterior distribution. We show that our approach naturally leads to regularization by denoising diffusion process (RED-diff) where denoisers at different timesteps concurrently impose different structural constraints over the image. To gauge the contribution of denoisers from different timesteps, we propose a weighting mechanism based on signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). Our approach provides a new variational perspective for solving inverse problems with diffusion models, allowing us to formulate sampling as stochastic optimization, where one can simply apply off-the-shelf solvers with lightweight iterates. Our experiments for various linear and nonlinear image restoration tasks demonstrate the strengths of our method compared with state-of-the-art sampling-based diffusion models. The code is available online \footnote{\url{https://github.com/NVlabs/RED-diff}}. | Morteza Mardani, Jiaming Song, Jan Kautz, Arash Vahdat |  |
| 843 |  |  [Can Large Language Models Infer Causation from Correlation?](https://openreview.net/forum?id=vqIH0ObdqL) |  | 0 | Causal inference is one of the hallmarks of human intelligence. While the field of CausalNLP has attracted much interest in the recent years, existing causal inference datasets in NLP primarily rely on discovering causality from empirical knowledge (e.g., commonsense knowledge). In this work, we propose the first benchmark dataset to test the pure causal inference skills of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we formulate a novel task Corr2Cause, which takes a set of correlational statements and determines the causal relationship between the variables. We curate a large-scale dataset of more than 200K samples, on which we evaluate seventeen existing LLMs. Through our experiments, we identify a key shortcoming of LLMs in terms of their causal inference skills, and show that these models achieve almost close to random performance on the task. This shortcoming is somewhat mitigated when we try to re-purpose LLMs for this skill via finetuning, but we find that these models still fail to generalize – they can only perform causal inference in in-distribution settings when variable names and textual expressions used in the queries are similar to those in the training set, but fail in out-of-distribution settings generated by perturbing these queries. Corr2Cause is a challenging task for LLMs, and can be helpful in guiding future research on improving LLMs’ pure reasoning skills and generalizability. Our data is at https://huggingface.co/datasets/causalnlp/corr2cause.

| 844 |  |  [Improved statistical and computational complexity of the mean-field Langevin dynamics under structured data](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Of2nEDc4s7) |  | 0 | Recent works have shown that neural networks optimized by gradient-based methods can adapt to sparse or low-dimensional target functions through feature learning; an often studied target is the sparse parity function on the unit hypercube. However, such isotropic data setting does not capture the anisotropy and low intrinsic dimensionality exhibited in realistic datasets. In this work, we address this shortcoming by studying how gradient-based feature learning interacts with structured (anisotropic) input data: we consider the classification of $k$-sparse parity on high-dimensional orthotope where the feature coordinates have varying magnitudes, and analyze the learning complexity of the mean-field Langevin dynamics (MFLD), which describes the noisy gradient descent update on two-layer neural network. We show that the statistical complexity (i.e. sample size) and computational complexity (i.e. network width) of MFLD can both be improved when prominent directions of the anisotropic input data align with the support of the target function. Moreover, by employing a coordinate transform determined by the gradient covariance, the width can be made independent of the target degree $k$. Lastly, we demonstrate the benefit of feature learning by establishing a kernel lower bound on the classification error, which applies to neural networks in the lazy regime. | Atsushi Nitanda, Kazusato Oko, Taiji Suzuki, Denny Wu |  |
| 845 |  |  [Jointly-Learned Exit and Inference for a Dynamic Neural Network](https://openreview.net/forum?id=jX2DT7qDam) |  | 0 | Large pretrained models, coupled with fine-tuning, are slowly becoming established as the dominant architecture in machine learning. Even though these models offer impressive performance, their practical application is often limited by the prohibitive amount of resources required for $\textit{every}$ inference. Early-exiting dynamic neural networks (EDNN) circumvent this issue by allowing a model to make some of its predictions from intermediate layers (i.e., early-exit). Training an EDNN architecture is challenging as it consists of two intertwined components: the gating mechanism (GM) that controls early-exiting decisions and the intermediate inference modules (IMs) that perform inference from intermediate representations. As a result, most existing approaches rely on thresholding confidence metrics for the gating mechanism and strive to improve the underlying backbone network and the inference modules. Although successful, this approach has two fundamental shortcomings: 1) the GMs and the IMs are decoupled during training, leading to a train-test mismatch; and 2) the thresholding gating mechanism introduces a positive bias into the predictive probabilities, making it difficult to readily extract uncertainty information. We propose a novel architecture that connects these two modules. This leads to significant performance improvements on classification datasets and enables better uncertainty characterization capabilities. | Florence Regol, Joud Chataoui, Mark Coates |  |

Despite the empirical success, the mechanism behind learning such generalizable representations is not understood. In this work, we rigorously analyze this problem and uncover two mechanisms behind MMCL's robustness: \emph{intra-class contrasting}, which allows the model to learn features with a high variance, and \emph{inter-class feature sharing}, where annotated details in one class help learning other classes better. Both mechanisms prevent spurious features that are over-represented in the training data to overshadow the generalizable core features. This yields superior zero-shot classification accuracy under distribution shift. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate the benefits of using rich captions on robustness and explore the effect of annotating different types of details in the captions. We validate our theoretical findings through experiments, including a well-designed synthetic experiment and an experiment involving training CLIP models on MSCOCO/Conceptual Captions and evaluating them on shifted ImageNets. | Yihao Xue, Siddharth Joshi, Dang Nguyen, Baharan Mirzasoleiman |  |

However, this maximum-likelihood (MLE) objective does not necessarily match a downstream use-case of autoregressively generating high-quality sequences. The MLE objective weights sequences proportionally to their frequency under the data distribution, with no guidance for the model's behaviour out of distribution (OOD): leading to compounding error during autoregressive generation. In order to address this compounding error problem, we formulate sequence generation as an imitation learning (IL) problem. This allows us to minimize a variety of divergences between the distribution of sequences generated by an autoregressive model and sequences from a dataset, including divergences with weight on OOD generated sequences. The IL framework also allows us to incorporate backtracking by introducing a backspace action into the generation process. This further mitigates the compounding error problem by allowing the model to revert a sampled token if it takes the sequence OOD. Our resulting method, SequenceMatch, can be implemented without adversarial training or major architectural changes. We identify the SequenceMatch-χ2 divergence as a more suitable training objective for autoregressive models which are used for generation. We show that empirically, SequenceMatch training leads to improvements over MLE on text generation with language models and arithmetic | Chris Cundy, Stefano Ermon |  |

It is most prominently used in federated learning. If models are averaged at the end of training, this can only lead to a good performing model if the loss surface of interest is very particular, i.e., the loss in the midpoint between the two models needs to be sufficiently low. This is impossible to guarantee for the non-convex losses of state-of-the-art networks. For averaging models trained on vastly different datasets, it was proposed to average only the parameters of particular layers or combinations of layers, resulting in better performing models. To get a better understanding of the effect of layer-wise averaging, we analyse the performance of the models that result from averaging single layers, or groups of layers. Based on our empirical and theoretical investigation, we introduce a novel notion of the layer-wise linear connectivity, and show that deep networks do not have layer-wise barriers between them. | Linara Adilova, Maksym Andriushchenko, Michael Kamp, Asja Fischer, Martin Jaggi |  |

To this end, certified training methods compute and then optimize an upper bound on the worst-case loss over a robustness specification. Curiously, training methods based on the imprecise interval bound propagation (IBP) consistently outperform those leveraging more precise bounds. Still, we lack a theoretical understanding of the mechanisms making IBP so successful. In this work, we investigate these mechanisms by leveraging a novel metric measuring the tightness of IBP bounds. We first show theoretically that, for deep linear models (DLNs), tightness decreases with width and depth at initialization, but improves with IBP training. We, then, derive sufficient and necessary conditions on weight matrices for IBP bounds to become exact and demonstrate that these impose strong regularization, providing an explanation for the observed robustness-accuracy trade-off. Finally, we show how these results on DLNs transfer to ReLU networks, before conducting an extensive empirical study, (i) confirming this transferability and yielding state-of-the-art certified accuracy, (ii) finding that while all IBP-based training methods lead to high tightness, this increase is dominated by the size of the propagated input regions rather than the robustness specification, and finally (iii) observing that non-IBP-based methods do not increase tightness. Together, these results help explain the success of recent certified training methods and may guide the development of new ones. | Yuhao Mao, Mark Niklas Müller, Marc Fischer, Martin T. Vechev |  |
| 850 |  |  [Offline RL with Observation Histories: Analyzing and Improving Sample Complexity](https://openreview.net/forum?id=GnOLWS4Llt) |  | 0 | Offline reinforcement learning (RL) can in principle synthesize more optimal behavior from a dataset consisting only of suboptimal trials. One way that this can happen is by "stitching" together the best parts of otherwise suboptimal trajectories that overlap on similar states, to create new behaviors where each individual state is in-distribution, but the overall returns are higher. However, in many interesting and complex applications, such as autonomous navigation and dialogue systems, the state is partially observed. Even worse, the state representation is unknown or not easy to define. In such cases, policies and value functions are often conditioned on observation histories instead of states. In these cases, it is not clear if the same kind of "stitching" is feasible at the level of observation histories, since two different trajectories would always have different histories, and thus "similar states" that might lead to effective stitching cannot be leveraged. Theoretically, we show that standard offline RL algorithms conditioned on observation histories suffer from poor sample complexity, in accordance with the above intuition. We then identify sufficient conditions under which offline RL can still be efficient -- intuitively, it needs to learn a compact representation of history comprising only features relevant for action selection. We introduce a bisimulation loss that captures the extent to which this happens, and propose that offline RL can explicitly optimize this loss to aid worst-case sample complexity. Empirically, we show that across a variety of tasks either our proposed loss improves performance, or the value of this loss is already minimized as a consequence of standard offline RL, indicating that it correlates well with good performance. | Joey Hong, Anca D.

| 851 |  |  [Graph-based Virtual Sensing from Sparse and Partial Multivariate Observations](https://openreview.net/forum?id=CAqdG2dy5s) |  | 0 | Virtual sensing techniques allow for inferring signals at new unmonitored locations by exploiting spatio-temporal measurements coming from physical sensors at different locations. However, as the sensor coverage becomes sparse due to costs or other constraints, physical proximity cannot be used to support interpolation. In this paper, we overcome this challenge by leveraging dependencies between the target variable and a set of correlated variables (covariates) that can frequently be associated with each location of interest. From this viewpoint, covariates provide partial observability, and the problem consists of inferring values for unobserved channels by exploiting observations at other locations to learn how such variables can correlate. We introduce a novel graph-based methodology to exploit such relationships and design a graph deep learning architecture, named GgNet, implementing the framework. The proposed approach relies on propagating information over a nested graph structure that is used to learn dependencies between variables as well as locations. GgNet is extensively evaluated under different virtual sensing scenarios, demonstrating higher reconstruction accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art. | Giovanni de Felice, Andrea Cini, Daniele Zambon, Vladimir V.

NEFTune adds noise to the embedding vectors during training. Standard finetuning of LLaMA-2-7B using Alpaca achieves $29.79$\% on AlpacaEval, which rises to $64.69$\% using noisy embeddings. NEFTune also improves over strong baselines on modern instruction datasets. Models trained with Evol-Instruct see a $10$\% improvement, with ShareGPT an $8$\% improvement, and with OpenPlatypus an $8$\% improvement. Even powerful models further refined with RLHF such as LLaMA-2-Chat benefit from additional training with NEFTune. Particularly, we see these improvements on the conversational abilities of the instruction model and not on traditional tasks like those on the OpenLLM Leaderboard, where performance is the same. | Neel Jain, Pingyeh Chiang, Yuxin Wen, John Kirchenbauer, HongMin Chu, Gowthami Somepalli, Brian R.

Our key result is that the difficulty in training these models is closely related to the conditioning of a specific differential operator. This operator, in turn, is associated to the Hermitian square of the differential operator of the underlying PDE. If this operator is ill-conditioned, it results in slow or infeasible training. Therefore, preconditioning this operator is crucial. We employ both rigorous mathematical analysis and empirical evaluations to investigate various strategies, explaining how they better condition this critical operator, and consequently improve training. | Tim De Ryck, Florent Bonnet, Siddhartha Mishra, Emmanuel de Bézenac |  |

They can be further improved towards a specific task by fine-tuning on a specialized dataset. However, fine-tuning usually makes the model narrowly specialized on this dataset with reduced general in-context learning performances, which is undesirable whenever the fine-tuned model needs to handle additional tasks where no fine-tuning data is available. In this work, we first demonstrate that fine-tuning on a single task indeed decreases LLMs' general in-context learning performance. We discover one important cause of such forgetting, format specialization, where the model overfits to the format of the fine-tuned task.We further show that format specialization happens at the very beginning of fine-tuning. To solve this problem, we propose Prompt Tuning with MOdel Tuning (ProMoT), a simple yet effective two-stage fine-tuning framework that reduces format specialization and improves generalization.ProMoT offloads task-specific format learning into additional and removable parameters by first doing prompt tuning and then fine-tuning the model itself with this soft prompt attached. With experiments on several fine-tuning tasks and 8 in-context evaluation tasks, we show that ProMoT achieves comparable performance on fine-tuned tasks to standard fine-tuning, but with much less loss of in-context learning performances across a board range of out-of-domain evaluation tasks. More importantly, ProMoT can even enhance generalization on in-context learning tasks that are semantically related to the fine-tuned task, e.g. ProMoT on En-Fr translation significantly improves performance on other language pairs, and ProMoT on NLI improves performance on summarization. Experiments also show that ProMoT can improve the generalization performance of multi-task training. | Yihan Wang, Si Si, Daliang Li, Michal Lukasik, Felix X. Yu, ChoJui Hsieh, Inderjit S.

As shown in recent work, better trade-offs between accuracy and robustness can be obtained by carefully coupling adversarial training with over-approximations. We hypothesize that the expressivity of a loss function, which we formalize as the ability to span a range of trade-offs between lower and upper bounds to the worst-case loss through a single parameter (the over-approximation coefficient), is key to attaining state-of-the-art performance. To support our hypothesis, we show that trivial expressive losses, obtained via convex combinations between adversarial attacks and IBP bounds, yield state-of-the-art results across a variety of settings in spite of their conceptual simplicity. We provide a detailed analysis of the relationship between the over-approximation coefficient and performance profiles across different expressive losses, showing that, while expressivity is essential, better approximations of the worst-case loss are not necessarily linked to superior robustness-accuracy trade-offs. | Alessandro De Palma, Rudy Bunel, Krishnamurthy (Dj) Dvijotham, M.

However, most GNNs employ single-resolution graph feature extraction, thereby failing to capture micro-level local patterns (high resolution) and macro-level graph cluster and community patterns (low resolution) simultaneously. Many multiresolution methods have been developed to capture graph patterns at multiple scales, but most of them depend on predefined and handcrafted multiresolution transforms that remain fixed throughout the training process once formulated. Due to variations in graph instances and distributions, fixed handcrafted transforms can not effectively tailor multiresolution representations to each graph instance. To acquire multiresolution representation suited to different graph instances and distributions, we introduce the Multiresolution Meta-Framelet-based Graph Convolutional Network (MM-FGCN), facilitating comprehensive and adaptive multiresolution analysis across diverse graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MM-FGCN achieves SOTA performance on various graph learning tasks. | Tianze Luo, Zhanfeng Mo, Sinno Jialin Pan |  |

In this paper, we propose a novel method called theoREm-from-prooF extrACTOR (REFACTOR) for training neural networks to mimic this ability in formal mathematical theorem proving. We show on a set of unseen proofs, REFACTOR is able to extract 19.6\% of the theorems that humans would use to write the proofs. When applying the model to the existing Metamath library, REFACTOR extracted 16 new theorems. With newly extracted theorems, we show that the existing proofs in the MetaMath database can be refactored. The new theorems are used very frequently after refactoring, with an average usage of 733.5 times, and help shorten the proof lengths. Lastly, we demonstrate that the prover trained on the new-theorem refactored dataset proves more test theorems and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by frequently leveraging a diverse set of newly extracted theorems.

Existing methods predict oncoming catastrophes in individual systems but are primarily time-series-based and struggle both to categorize qualitative dynamical regimes across diverse systems and to generalize to real data. To address this challenge, we propose a data-driven, physically-informed deep-learning framework for classifying dynamical regimes and characterizing bifurcation boundaries based on the extraction of topologically invariant features. We focus on the paradigmatic case of the supercritical Hopf bifurcation, which is used to model periodic dynamics across a wide range of applications. Our convolutional attention method is trained with data augmentations that encourage the learning of topological invariants which can be used to detect bifurcation boundaries in unseen systems and to design models of biological systems like oscillatory gene regulatory networks. We further demonstrate our method's use in analyzing real data by recovering distinct proliferation and differentiation dynamics along pancreatic endocrinogenesis trajectory in gene expression space based on single-cell data. Our method provides valuable insights into the qualitative, long-term behavior of a wide range of dynamical systems, and can detect bifurcations or catastrophic transitions in large-scale physical and biological systems. | Noa Moriel, Matthew Ricci, Mor Nitzan |  |

However, current SMoE solutions neglect the intrinsic structures of the MMT problem: ($a$) $\textit{Linguistics Hierarchy.}$ Languages are naturally grouped according to their lingual properties like genetic families, phonological characteristics, etc; ($b$) $\textit{Language Complexity.}$ The learning difficulties are varied for diverse languages due to their grammar complexity, available resources, etc. Therefore, routing a fixed number of experts (e.g., $1$ or $2$ experts in usual) only at the word level leads to inferior performance. To fill in the missing puzzle, we propose $\textbf{\texttt{Lingual-SMoE}}$ by equipping the SMoE with adaptive and linguistic-guided routing policies. Specifically, it ($1$) extracts language representations to incorporate linguistic knowledge and uses them to allocate experts into different groups; ($2$) determines the number of activated experts for each target language in an adaptive and automatic manner, according to their translation difficulties, which aims to mitigate the potential over-/under-fitting issues of learning simple/challenges translations. Sufficient experimental studies on MMT benchmarks with {$16$, $50$, $100$} language pairs and various network architectures, consistently validate the superior performance of our proposals. For instance, $\texttt{Lingual-SMoE}$ outperforms its dense counterpart by over $5\%$ BLEU scores on $\texttt{OPUS-100}$ dataset. | Xinyu Zhao, Xuxi Chen, Yu Cheng, Tianlong Chen |  |

Given the incredible scale of this data, up to trillions of tokens, it is all but certain that it includes potentially problematic text such as copyrighted materials, personally identifiable information, and test data for widely reported reference benchmarks. However, we currently have no way to know which data of these types is included or in what proportions. In this paper, we study the pretraining data detection problem: given a piece of text and black-box access to an LLM without knowing the pretraining data, can we determine if the model was trained on the provided text? To facilitate this study, we introduce a dynamic benchmark WIKIMIA that uses data created before and after model training to support gold truth detection. We also introduce a new detection method MIN-K PROB based on a simple hypothesis: an unseen example is likely to contain a few outlier words with low probabilities under the LLM, while a seen example is less likely to have words with such low probabilities. MIN-K PROB can be applied without any knowledge about the pretrainig corpus or any additional training, departing from previous detection methods that require training a reference model on data that is similar to the pretraining data. Moreover, our experiments demonstrate that MIN-K PROB achieves a 7.4% improvement on WIKIMIA over these previous methods. We apply MIN-K PROB to two real-world scenarios, copyrighted book detection and contaminated downstream example detection, and find that it to be a consistently effective solution. | Weijia Shi, Anirudh Ajith, Mengzhou Xia, Yangsibo Huang, Daogao Liu, Terra Blevins, Danqi Chen, Luke Zettlemoyer |  |

However, they still make unjustified logical and computational errors in their reasoning steps and answers. In this paper, we leverage the fact that if the training corpus of LLMs contained sufficiently many examples of formal mathematics (e.g. in Isabelle, a formal theorem proving environment), they can be prompted to translate i.e. autoformalize informal mathematical statements into formal Isabelle code --- which can be verified automatically for internal consistency. This provides a mechanism to automatically reject solutions whose formalized versions are inconsistent within themselves or with the formalized problem statement. We evaluate our method on GSM8K, MATH and MultiArith datasets and demonstrate that our approach provides a consistently better heuristic than vanilla majority voting --- the previously best method to identify correct answers, by more than 12\% on GSM8K. In our experiments it improves results consistently across all datasets and LLM model sizes.

However, through a decade-long history of the robustness evaluation literature, we have learned that mounting a strong or optimal attack is challenging. It requires both machine learning and domain expertise. In other words, the white-box threat model, religiously assumed by a large majority of the past literature, is unrealistic. In this paper, we propose a new practical threat model where the adversary relies on transfer attacks through publicly available surrogate models. We argue that this setting will become the most prevalent for security-sensitive applications in the future. We evaluate the transfer attacks in this setting and propose a specialized defense method based on a game-theoretic perspective. The defenses are evaluated under 24 public models and 11 attack algorithms across three datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet). Under this threat model, our defense, PubDef, outperforms the state-of-the-art white-box adversarial training by a large margin with almost no loss in the normal accuracy. For instance, on ImageNet, our defense achieves 62% accuracy under the strongest transfer attack vs only 36% of the best adversarially trained model. Its accuracy when not under attack is only 2% lower than that of an undefended model (78% vs 80%).

Given that vector graphics are typically encoded using low-level graphics primitives, generating them directly is difficult. To address this, we propose the use of TikZ, a well-known abstract graphics language that can be compiled to vector graphics, as an intermediate representation of scientific figures. TikZ offers human-oriented, high-level commands, thereby facilitating conditional language modeling with any large language model. To this end, we introduce DaTikZ the first large-scale TikZ dataset, consisting of 120k TikZ drawings aligned with captions. We fine-tune LLaMA on DaTikZ, as well as our new model CLiMA, which augments LLaMA with multimodal CLIP embeddings. In both human and automatic evaluation, CLiMA and LLaMA outperform commercial GPT-4 and Claude 2 in terms of similarity to human-created figures, with CLiMA additionally improving text-image alignment. Our detailed analysis shows that all models generalize well and are not susceptible to memorization. GPT-4 and Claude 2, however, tend to generate more simplistic figures compared to both humans and our models. We make our framework, AutomaTikZ, along with model weights and datasets, publicly available. | Jonas Belouadi, Anne Lauscher, Steffen Eger |  |

The originally-proposed motivation behind SAM was to bias neural networks towards flatter minima that are believed to generalize better. However, recent studies have shown conflicting evidence on the relationship between flatness and generalization, suggesting that flatness does fully explain SAM's success. Sidestepping this debate, we identify an orthogonal effect of SAM that is beneficial out-of-distribution: we argue that SAM implicitly balances the quality of diverse features. SAM achieves this effect by adaptively suppressing well-learned features which gives remaining features opportunity to be learned. We show that this mechanism is beneficial in datasets that contain redundant or spurious features where SGD falls for the simplicity bias and would not otherwise learn all available features. Our insights are supported by experiments on real data: we demonstrate that SAM improves the quality of features in datasets containing redundant or spurious features, including CelebA, Waterbirds, CIFAR-MNIST, and DomainBed. | Jacob Mitchell Springer, Vaishnavh Nagarajan, Aditi Raghunathan |  |

However, the potential that LLMs such as ChatGPT can be exploited to generate misinformation has posed a serious concern to online safety and public trust. A fundamental research question is: will LLM-generated misinformation cause more harm than human-written misinformation? We propose to tackle this question from the perspective of detection difficulty. We first build a taxonomy of LLM-generated misinformation. Then we categorize and validate the potential real-world methods for generating misinformation with LLMs. Then, through extensive empirical investigation, we discover that LLM-generated misinformation can be harder to detect for humans and detectors compared to human-written misinformation with the same semantics, which suggests it can have more deceptive styles and potentially cause more harm. We also discuss the implications of our discovery on combating misinformation in the age of LLMs and the countermeasures. | Canyu Chen, Kai Shu |  |

Unlike mainstream classifiers that wait until the last fully connected layer to incorporate class information to make predictions, we investigate a proactive approach, asking each class to search for itself in an image. We realize this idea via a Transformer encoder-decoder inspired by DEtection TRansformer (DETR). We learn ''class-specific'' queries (one for each class) as input to the decoder, enabling each class to localize its patterns in an image via cross-attention. We name our approach INterpretable TRansformer (INTR), which is fairly easy to implement and exhibits several compelling properties. We show that INTR intrinsically encourages each class to attend distinctively; the cross-attention weights thus provide a faithful interpretation of the prediction. Interestingly, via ''multi-head'' cross-attention, INTR could identify different ''attributes'' of a class, making it particularly suitable for fine-grained classification and analysis, which we demonstrate on eight datasets. Our code and pre-trained models are publicly accessible at the Imageomics Institute GitHub site: https://github.com/Imageomics/INTR. | Dipanjyoti Paul, Arpita Chowdhury, Xinqi Xiong, FengJu Chang, David Edward Carlyn, Samuel Stevens, Kaiya Provost, Anuj Karpatne, Bryan Carstens, Daniel I.

Existing AL algorithms often rely on iterative model training, which can be computationally expensive, particularly for deep models. In this paper, we propose a one-shot AL method to address this challenge, which performs all label queries without repeated model training. Specifically, we extract different representations of the same dataset using distinct network backbones, and actively learn the linear prediction layer on each representation via an $\ell_p$-regression formulation. The regression problems are solved approximately by sampling and reweighting the unlabeled instances based on their maximum Lewis weights across the representations. An upper bound on the number of samples needed is provided with a rigorous analysis for $p\in [1, +\infty)$. Experimental results on 11 benchmarks show that our one-shot approach achieves competitive performances with the state-of-the-art AL methods for multiple target models. | ShengJun Huang, Yi Li, Yiming Sun, YingPeng Tang |  |

We focus on disentangled representation learning for home appliance electricity usage, enabling users to understand and optimize their consumption for a reduced carbon footprint. Our approach frames the problem as disentangling each attribute's role in total consumption. Unlike existing methods assuming attribute independence which leads to non-identiability, we acknowledge real-world time series attribute correlations, learned up to a smooth bijection using contrastive learning and a single autoencoder. To address this, we propose a Disentanglement under Independence-Of-Support via Contrastive Learning (DIOSC), facilitating representation generalization across diverse correlated scenarios. Our method utilizes innovative \textit{l}-variational inference layers with self-attention, effectively addressing temporal dependencies across bottom-up and top-down networks. We find that DIOSC can enhance the task of representation of time series electricity consumption. We introduce TDS (Time Disentangling Score) to gauge disentanglement quality. TDS reliably reflects disentanglement performance, making it a valuable metric for evaluating time series representations disentanglement.

We measure $n$ points on the simplex, but due to the measurement noise, some of the observed points fall outside the simplex. The interest is vertex hunting (i.e., estimating the vertices of the simplex). The successive projection algorithm (SPA) is one of the most popular approaches to vertex hunting, but it is vulnerable to noise and outliers, and may perform unsatisfactorily. We propose pseudo-point SPA (pp-SPA) as a new approach to vertex hunting. The approach contains two novel ideas (a projection step and a denoise step) and generates roughly $n$ pseudo-points, which can be fed in to SPA for vertex hunting. For theory, we first derive an improved non-asymptotic bound for the orthodox SPA, and then use the result to derive the bounds for pp-SPA. Compared with the orthodox SPA, pp-SPA has a faster rate and more satisfactory numerical performance in a broad setting. The analysis is quite delicate: the non-asymptotic bound is hard to derive, and we need precise results on the extreme values of (possibly) high-dimensional random vectors. | Jiashun Jin, Zheng Tracy Ke, Gabriel Moryoussef, Jiajun Tang, Jingming Wang |  |

Hidden context refers to data that affects the feedback received, but which is not represented in the data used to train a preference model. This captures common issues of data collection, such as having human annotators with varied preferences, cognitive processes that result in seemingly irrational behavior, and combining data labeled according to different criteria. We prove that standard applications of preference learning, including reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), implicitly aggregate over hidden contexts according to a well-known voting rule called \*Borda count\*. We show this can produce counter-intuitive results that are very different from other methods which implicitly aggregate via expected utility. Furthermore, our analysis formalizes the way that preference learning from users with diverse values tacitly implements a social choice function. A key implication of this result is that annotators have an incentive to misreport their preferences in order to influence the learned model, leading to vulnerabilities in the deployment of RLHF. As a step towards mitigating these problems, we introduce a class of methods called \*distributional preference learning\* (DPL). DPL methods estimate a distribution of possible score values for each alternative in order to better account for hidden context. Experimental results indicate that applying DPL to RLHF for LLM chatbots identifies hidden context in the data and significantly reduces subsequent jailbreak vulnerability. | Anand Siththaranjan, Cassidy Laidlaw, Dylan HadfieldMenell |  |

Although many methods have been proposed, only a few works have rigorously analyzed their statistical efficiency or quantified estimator uncertainty in data-limited regimes. Here, we derive upper and lower bounds on the worst-case convergence of standard estimators of shape distance—a measure of representational dissimilarity proposed by Williams et al. (2021). These bounds reveal the challenging nature of the problem in high-dimensional feature spaces. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel method-of-moments estimator with a tunable bias-variance tradeoff parameterized by an upper bound on bias. We show that this estimator achieves superior performance to standard estimators in simulation and on neural data, particularly in high-dimensional settings. Our theoretical work and estimator thus respectively define and dramatically expand the scope of neural data for which geometric similarity can be accurately measured. | Dean A. Pospisil, Brett W.

Despite their great success, current NO-based solutions face important challenges when dealing with spatio-temporal PDEs over long time scales. Specifically, the current theory of NOs does not present a systematic framework to perform data assimilation and efficiently correct the evolution of PDE solutions over time based on sparsely sampled noisy measurements. In this paper, we propose a learning-based state-space approach to compute the solution operators to infinite-dimensional semilinear PDEs. Exploiting the structure of semilinear PDEs and the theory of nonlinear observers in function spaces, we develop a flexible recursive method that allows for both prediction and data assimilation by combining prediction and correction operations. The proposed framework is capable of producing fast and accurate predictions over long time horizons, dealing with irregularly sampled noisy measurements to correct the solution, and benefits from the decoupling between the spatial and temporal dynamics of this class of PDEs. We show through experiments on the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky, Navier-Stokes and Korteweg-de Vries equations that the proposed model is robust to noise and can leverage arbitrary amounts of measurements to correct its prediction over a long time horizon with little computational overhead. | Ashutosh Singh, Ricardo Augusto Borsoi, Deniz Erdogmus, Tales Imbiriba |  |

However, harnessing them to learn complex low-level manipulation tasks, such as dexterous pen spinning, remains an open problem. We bridge this fundamental gap and present Eureka, a human-level reward design algorithm powered by LLMs. Eureka exploits the remarkable zero-shot generation, code-writing, and in-context improvement capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4, to perform evolutionary optimization over reward code. The resulting rewards can then be used to acquire complex skills via reinforcement learning. Without any task-specific prompting or pre-defined reward templates, Eureka generates reward functions that outperform expert human-engineered rewards. In a diverse suite of 29 open-source RL environments that include 10 distinct robot morphologies, Eureka outperforms human experts on 83% of the tasks, leading to an average normalized improvement of 52%. The generality of Eureka also enables a new gradient-free in-context learning approach to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), readily incorporating human inputs to improve the quality and the safety of the generated rewards without model updating. Finally, using Eureka rewards in a curriculum learning setting, we demonstrate for the first time, a simulated Shadow Hand capable of performing pen spinning tricks, adeptly manipulating a pen in circles at rapid speed. | Yecheng Jason Ma, William Liang, Guanzhi Wang, DeAn Huang, Osbert Bastani, Dinesh Jayaraman, Yuke Zhu, Linxi Fan, Anima Anandkumar |  |

While numerous constraints and regularization terms have been proposed in the literature to promote fairness in machine learning tasks, most of these approaches are not amenable to stochastic optimization due to the complex and nonlinear structure of constraints and regularizers. Here, the term \`\`stochastic'' refers to the ability of the algorithm to work with small mini-batches of data. Motivated by the limitation of existing literature, this paper presents a unified stochastic optimization framework for fair empirical risk minimization based on $f$-divergence measures ($f$-FERM). The proposed stochastic algorithm enjoys theoretical convergence guarantees. In addition, our experiments demonstrate the superiority of fairness-accuracy tradeoffs offered by $f$-FERM for almost all batch sizes (ranging from full-batch to batch size of one). Moreover, we show that our framework can be extended to the case where there is a distribution shift from training to the test data. Our extension is based on a distributionally robust optimization reformulation of $f$-FERM objective under $\ell_p$ norms as uncertainty sets. Again, in this distributionally robust setting, $f$-FERM not only enjoys theoretical convergence guarantees but also outperforms other baselines in the literature in the tasks involving distribution shifts. An efficient stochastic implementation of $f$-FERM is publicly available. | Sina Baharlouei, Shivam Patel, Meisam Razaviyayn |  |

Collecting and annotating real world 3D data and corresponding images is laborious, expensive yet unavoidable process since even 3D pose domain adaptation methods require 3D data in the target domain. We introduce a method which is capable of adapting to a nuisance ridden target domain without any 3D data or annotations. We represent object categories as simple cuboid meshes, and harness a generative model of neural feature activations modeled as a von Mises Fisher distribution at each mesh vertex learnt using differential rendering. We focus on individual mesh vertex features and iteratively update them based on their proximity to corresponding features in the target domain. Our key insight stems from the observation that specific object subparts remain stable across out-of-domain (OOD) scenarios, enabling strategic utilization of these invariant subcomponents for effective model updates. Our model is then trained in an EM fashion alternating between updating the vertex features and feature extractor. We show that our method simulates fine-tuning on a global-pseudo labelled dataset under mild assumptions which converges to the target domain asymptotically. Through extensive empirical validation, we demonstrate the potency of our simple approach in addressing the domain shift challenge and significantly enhancing pose estimation accuracy. By accentuating robust and less changed object subcomponents, our framework contributes to the evolution of UDA techniques in the context of 3D pose estimation using only images from the target domain. | Prakhar Kaushik, Aayush Mishra, Adam Kortylewski, Alan L.

We provide a theoretical explanation for the effectiveness of the truncation sampling by proving that truncation methods that discard tokens below some probability threshold (the most common type of truncation) can guarantee that all sampled tokens have nonzero true probability. However, thresholds are a coarse heuristic, and necessarily discard some tokens with nonzero true probability as well. In pursuit of a more precise sampling strategy, we show that we can leverage a known source of model errors, the softmax bottleneck, to prove that certain tokens have nonzero true probability, without relying on a threshold. Based on our findings, we develop an experimental truncation strategy and the present pilot studies demonstrating the promise of this type of algorithm. Our evaluations show that our method outperforms its threshold-based counterparts under automatic and human evaluation metrics for low-entropy (i.e., close to greedy) open-ended text generation. Our theoretical findings and pilot experiments provide both insight into why truncation sampling works, and make progress toward more expressive sampling algorithms that better surface the generative capabilities of large language models. | Matthew Finlayson, John Hewitt, Alexander Koller, Swabha Swayamdipta, Ashish Sabharwal |  |

The equilibrium points reached by these dynamics, known as linear correlated equilibria, are currently the tightest known relaxation of correlated equilibrium that can be learned in polynomial time in any finite extensive-form game. However, their properties remain vastly unexplored, and their computation is onerous. In this paper, we provide several contributions shedding light on the fundamental nature of linear-swap regret. First, we show a connection between linear deviations and a generalization of communication deviations in which the player can make queries to a \`\`mediator'' who replies with action recommendations, and, critically, the player is not constrained to match the timing of the game as would be the case for communication deviations. We coin this latter set the untimed communication (UTC) deviations. We show that the UTC deviations coincide precisely with the linear deviations, and therefore that any player minimizing UTC regret also minimizes linear-swap regret. We then leverage this connection to develop state-of-the-art no-regret algorithms for computing linear correlated equilibria, both in theory and in practice. In theory, our algorithms achieve polynomially better per-iteration runtimes; in practice, our algorithms represent the state of the art by several orders of magnitude. | Brian Hu Zhang, Gabriele Farina, Tuomas Sandholm |  |

Unlike MAEs used in the image domain, where the pretext task is to restore features at the masked pixels, such as colors, the existing 3D MAE works reconstruct the missing geometry only, i.e, the location of the masked points. In contrast to previous studies, we advocate that point location recovery is inessential and restoring intrinsic point features is much superior. To this end, we propose to ignore point position reconstruction and recover high-order features at masked points including surface normals and surface variations, through a novel attention-based decoder which is independent of the encoder design. We validate the effectiveness of our pretext task and decoder design using different encoder structures for 3D training and demonstrate the advantages of our pretrained networks on various point cloud analysis tasks. | Siming Yan, Yuqi Yang, YuXiao Guo, Hao Pan, PengShuai Wang, Xin Tong, Yang Liu, Qixing Huang |  |

In a simplified scenario, we demonstrate that improving performance on tasks within the fine-tuning data distribution comes at the expense of capabilities on other tasks. We hypothesize that language models implicitly infer the task of the prompt and that fine-tuning skews this inference towards tasks in the fine-tuning distribution. To test this, we propose Conjugate Prompting, which artificially makes the task look farther from the fine-tuning distribution while requiring the same capability, and we find that this recovers some of the pretraining capabilities in our synthetic setup. Since real-world fine-tuning distributions are predominantly English, we apply conjugate prompting to recover pretrained capabilities in LLMs by simply translating the prompts to different languages. This allows us to recover in-context learning abilities lost via instruction tuning, natural reasoning capability lost during code fine-tuning, and, more concerningly, harmful content generation suppressed by safety fine-tuning in chatbots like ChatGPT. | Suhas Kotha, Jacob Mitchell Springer, Aditi Raghunathan |  |

Unfortunately, their applicability is hampered by the computational complexity associated with performing message passing on many subgraphs. In this paper, we consider the problem of learning to select a small subset of the large set of possible subgraphs in a data-driven fashion. We first motivate the problem by proving that there are families of WL-indistinguishable graphs for which there exist efficient subgraph selection policies: small subsets of subgraphs that can already identify all the graphs within the family. We then propose a new approach, called _Policy-Learn_, that learns how to select subgraphs in an iterative manner. We prove that, unlike popular random policies and prior work addressing the same problem, our architecture is able to learn the efficient policies mentioned above. Our experimental results demonstrate that _Policy-Learn_ outperforms existing baselines across a wide range of datasets. | Beatrice Bevilacqua, Moshe Eliasof, Eli A.

One popular approach involves the recurrent switching linear dynamical system (rSLDS) model, which describes the latent dynamics of neural spike train data using discrete switches between a finite number of low-dimensional linear dynamical systems. However, a few properties of rSLDS model limit its deployability on trial-varying data, such as a fixed number of states over trials, and no latent structure or organization of states. Here we overcome these limitations by endowing the rSLDS model with a semi-Markov discrete state process, with latent geometry, that captures key properties of stochastic processes over partitions with flexible state cardinality. We leverage partial differential equations (PDE) theory to derive an efficient, semi-parametric formulation for dynamical sufficient statistics to the discrete states. This process, combined with switching dynamics, defines our infinite recurrent switching linear dynamical system (irSLDS) model class. We first validate and demonstrate the capabilities of our model on synthetic data. Next, we turn to the analysis of mice electrophysiological data during decision-making, and uncover strong non-stationary processes underlying both within-trial and trial-averaged neural activity. | Victor Geadah, International Brain Laboratory, Jonathan W.

Though existing planning approaches show promisingly high solving rates and low costs, the trivial route cost evaluation via pre-trained forward reaction prediction models certainly falls short of real-world chemical practice. An alternative option is to annotate the actual cost of a route, such as yield, through chemical experiments or input from chemists, while this often leads to substantial query costs. In order to strike the balance between query costs and route quality evaluation, we propose an Active Retrosynthetic Planning (ARP) framework that remains compatible with the established retrosynthetic planners. On one hand, the proposed ARP trains an actor that decides whether to query the cost of a reaction; on the other hand, it resorts to a critic to estimate the value of a molecule with its preceding reaction cost as input. Those molecules with low reaction costs are preferred to expand first. We apply our framework to different existing approaches on both the benchmark and an expert dataset and demonstrate that it outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approach by 6.2\% in route quality while reducing the query cost by 12.8\%. In addition, ARP consistently plans high-quality routes with either abundant or sparse annotations. | Luotian Yuan, Yemin Yu, Ying Wei, Yongwei Wang, Zhihua Wang, Fei Wu |  |

When the context describes facts about more than one entity, the LM has to correctly bind attributes to their corresponding entity. We show, via causal experiments, that LMs' internal activations represent binding information by exhibiting appropriate binding ID vectors at the entity and attribute positions. We further show that binding ID vectors form a subspace and often transfer across tasks. Our results demonstrate that LMs learn interpretable strategies for representing symbolic knowledge in context, and that studying context activations is a fruitful direction for understanding LM cognition. | Jiahai Feng, Jacob Steinhardt |  |

Specifically, the LipSDP approach (Fazlyab et al., 2019) has received much attention and provides the least conservative Lipschitz upper bounds that can be computed with polynomial time guarantees. However, one main restriction of LipSDP is that its formulation requires the activation functions to be slope-restricted on $[0,1]$, preventing its further use for more general activation functions such as GroupSort, MaxMin, and Householder. One can rewrite MaxMin activations for example as residual ReLU networks. However, a direct application of LipSDP to the resultant residual ReLU networks is conservative and even fails in recovering the well-known fact that the MaxMin activation is 1-Lipschitz. Our paper bridges this gap and extends LipSDP beyond slope-restricted activation functions. To this end, we provide novel quadratic constraints for GroupSort, MaxMin, and Householder activations via leveraging their underlying properties such as sum preservation. Our proposed analysis is general and provides a unified approach for estimating $\ell_2$ and $\ell_\infty$ Lipschitz bounds for a rich class of neural network architectures, including non-residual and residual neural networks and implicit models, with GroupSort, MaxMin, and HouseHolder activations. Finally, we illustrate the utility of our approach with a variety of experiments and show that our proposed SDPs generate less conservative Lipschitz bounds in comparison to existing approaches. | Patricia Pauli, Aaron J.

Recently, multiple neural estimators for Monge maps have been developed and applied in diverse unpaired domain translation tasks, e.g. in single-cell biology and computer vision. However, the classic OT framework enforces mass conservation, which makes it prone to outliers and limits its applicability in real-world scenarios. The latter can be particularly harmful in OT domain translation tasks, where the relative position of a sample within a distribution is explicitly taken into account. While unbalanced OT tackles this challenge in the discrete setting, its integration into neural Monge map estimators has received limited attention. We propose a theoretically grounded method to incorporate unbalancedness into any Monge map estimator. We improve existing estimators to model cell trajectories over time and to predict cellular responses to perturbations. Moreover, our approach seamlessly integrates with the OT flow matching (OT-FM) framework. While we show that OT-FM performs competitively in image translation, we further improve performance by incorporating unbalancedness (UOT-FM), which better preserves relevant features. We hence establish UOT-FM as a principled method for unpaired image translation. | Luca Eyring, Dominik Klein, Théo Uscidda, Giovanni Palla, Niki Kilbertus, Zeynep Akata, Fabian J. Theis |  |

By parameterizing an image as a multilayer perceptron (MLP) on Euclidean space, INRs effectively couple spatial and spectral features of the represented signal in a way that is not obvious in the usual discrete representation. Although INRs using sinusoidal activation functions have been studied in terms of Fourier theory, recent works have shown the advantage of using wavelets instead of sinusoids as activation functions, due to their ability to simultaneously localize in both frequency and space. In this work, we approach such INRs and demonstrate how they resolve high-frequency features of signals from coarse approximations performed in the first layer of the MLP. This leads to multiple prescriptions for the design of INR architectures, including the use of progressive wavelets, decoupling of low and high-pass approximations, and initialization schemes based on the singularities of the target signal. | T.

| 887 |  |  [Fiber Monte Carlo](https://openreview.net/forum?id=sP1tCl2QBk) |  | 0 | Integrals with discontinuous integrands are ubiquitous, arising from discrete structure in applications like topology optimization, graphics, and computational geometry. These integrals are often part of a forward model in an inverse problem where it is necessary to reason backwards about the parameters, ideally using gradient-based optimization. Monte Carlo methods are widely used to estimate the value of integrals, but this results in a non-differentiable approximation that is amenable to neither conventional automatic differentiation nor reparameterization-based gradient methods. This significantly disrupts efforts to integrate machine learning methods in areas that exhibit these discontinuities: physical simulation and robotics, design, graphics, and computational geometry. Although bespoke domain-specific techniques can handle special cases, a general methodology to wield automatic differentiation in these discrete contexts is wanting. We introduce a differentiable variant of the simple Monte Carlo estimator which samples line segments rather than points from the domain. We justify our estimator analytically as conditional Monte Carlo and demonstrate the diverse functionality of the method as applied to image stylization, topology optimization, and computational geometry. | Nick Richardson, Deniz Oktay, Yaniv Ovadia, James C.

| 888 |  |  [Learning from Label Proportions: Bootstrapping Supervised Learners via Belief Propagation](https://openreview.net/forum?id=KQe9tHd0k8) |  | 0 | Learning from Label Proportions (LLP) is a learning problem where only aggregate level labels are available for groups of instances, called bags, during training, and the aim is to get the best performance at the instance-level on the test data. This setting arises in domains like advertising and medicine due to privacy considerations. We propose a novel algorithmic framework for this problem that iteratively performs two main steps. For the first step (Pseudo Labeling) in every iteration, we define a Gibbs distribution over binary instance labels that incorporates a) covariate information through the constraint that instances with similar covariates should have similar labels and b) the bag level aggregated label. We then use Belief Propagation (BP) to marginalize the Gibbs distribution to obtain pseudo labels. In the second step (Embedding Refinement), we use the pseudo labels to provide supervision for a learner that yields a better embedding. Further, we iterate on the two steps again by using the second step's embeddings as new covariates for the next iteration. In the final iteration, a classifier is trained using the pseudo labels. Our algorithm displays strong gains against several SOTA baselines (upto \*\*15%\*\*) for the LLP Binary Classification problem on various dataset types - tabular and Image. We achieve these improvements with minimal computational overhead above standard supervised learning due to Belief Propagation, for large bag sizes, even for a million samples. | Shreyas Havaldar, Navodita Sharma, Shubhi Sareen, Karthikeyan Shanmugam, Aravindan Raghuveer |  |

A precise description of interactions between regions remains an open problem. Moreover, neural dynamics are nonlinear and non-stationary. Here, we propose MR-SDS, a multiregion, switching nonlinear state space model that decomposes global dynamics into local and cross-communication components in the latent space. MR-SDS includes directed interactions between brain regions, allowing for estimation of state-dependent communication signals, and accounts for sensory inputs effects. We show that our model accurately recovers latent trajectories, vector fields underlying switching nonlinear dynamics, and cross-region communication profiles in three simulations. We then apply our method to two large-scale, multi-region neural datasets involving mouse decision making. The first includes hundreds of neurons per region, recorded simultaneously at single-cell-resolution across 3 distant cortical regions. The second is a mesoscale widefield dataset of 8 adjacent cortical regions imaged across both hemispheres. On these multi-region datasets, our model outperforms existing piece-wise linear multi-region models and reveals multiple distinct dynamical states and a rich set of cross-region communication profiles. | Orren KarniolTambour, David M.

While neural language models can naturally benefit from the compositional structure inherently and explicitly expressed in language data, learning such representations from non-linguistic general observations, like images, remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce the Neural Language of Thought Model (NLoTM), a novel approach for unsupervised learning of LoTH-inspired representation and generation. NLoTM comprises two key components: (1) the Semantic Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoder, which learns hierarchical, composable discrete representations aligned with objects and their properties, and (2) the Autoregressive LoT Prior, an autoregressive transformer that learns to generate semantic concept tokens compositionally, capturing the underlying data distribution. We evaluate NLoTM on several 2D and 3D image datasets, demonstrating superior performance in downstream tasks, out-of-distribution generalization, and image generation quality compared to patch-based VQ-VAE and continuous object-centric representations. Our work presents a significant step towards creating neural networks exhibiting more human-like understanding by developing LoT-like representations and offers insights into the intersection of cognitive science and machine learning. | YiFu Wu, Minseung Lee, Sungjin Ahn |  |

The process involves a sequential application of logic minimization heuristics (\`\`synthesis recipe"), with their arrangement significantly impacting crucial metrics such as area and delay. Addressing the challenge posed by the broad spectrum of hardware design complexities — from variations of past designs (e.g., adders and multipliers) to entirely novel configurations (e.g., innovative processor instructions) — requires a nuanced 'synthesis recipe' guided by human expertise and intuition. This study conducts a thorough examination of learning and search techniques for logic synthesis, unearthing a surprising revelation: pre-trained agents, when confronted with entirely novel designs, may veer off course, detrimentally affecting the search trajectory. We present ABC-RL, a meticulously tuned $\alpha$ parameter that adeptly adjusts recommendations from pre-trained agents during the search process. Computed based on similarity scores through nearest neighbor retrieval from the training dataset, ABC-RL yields superior synthesis recipes tailored for a wide array of hardware designs. Our findings showcase substantial enhancements in the Quality of Result (QoR) of synthesized circuits, boasting improvements of up to 24.8\% compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, ABC-RL achieves an impressive up to 9x reduction in runtime (iso-QoR) when compared to current state-of-the-art methodologies. | Animesh Basak Chowdhury, Marco Romanelli, Benjamin Tan, Ramesh Karri, Siddharth Garg |  |

Although offering improved data privacy protection, domain-specific small language models (SLMs) often underperform LLMs, emphasizing the need for methods that reduce this performance gap while alleviating privacy concerns. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective method that harnesses LLMs' medical proficiency to boost SLM performance in medical tasks under $privacy-restricted$ scenarios. Specifically, we mitigate patient privacy issues by extracting keywords from medical data and prompting the LLM to generate a medical knowledge-intensive context by simulating clinicians' thought processes. This context serves as additional input for SLMs, augmenting their decision-making capabilities. Our method significantly enhances performance in both few-shot and full training settings across three medical knowledge-intensive tasks, achieving up to a 22.57% increase in absolute accuracy compared to SLM fine-tuning without context, and sets new state-of-the-art results in two medical tasks within privacy-restricted scenarios. Further out-of-domain testing and experiments in two general domain datasets showcase its generalizability and broad applicability. | Xinlu Zhang, Shiyang Li, Xianjun Yang, Chenxin Tian, Yao Qin, Linda Ruth Petzold |  |

Maximal Unstructured Pruning for Maximal Cosine Similarity](https://openreview.net/forum?id=jsvvPVVzwf) |  | 0 | Pruning is an effective method to reduce the size of deep neural network models, maintain accuracy, and, in some cases, improve the network's overall performance. However, the mechanisms underpinning pruning remain unclear. Why can different methods prune by different percentages yet achieve similar performance? Why can we not prune at the start of training? Why are some models more amenable to being pruned than others? Given a model, what is the maximum amount it can be pruned before significantly affecting the performance? This paper explores and answers these questions from the global unstructured magnitude pruning perspective with one epoch of fine-tuning. We develop the idea that cosine similarity is an effective proxy measure for functional similarity between the parent and the pruned network. We prove that the L1 pruning method is optimal when pruning by cosine similarity. We show that the higher the kurtosis of a model's parameter distribution, the more it can be pruned while maintaining performance. Finally, we present a simple method to determine the optimal amount by which a network can be L1-pruned based on its parameter distribution.

For example, agents may dominate the collaboration and exhibit unintended or detrimental behaviors, leading to poor experiences for their human partners. In other words, most game AI agents are modeled in a "self-centered" manner. In this paper, we propose a "human-centered" modeling scheme for collaborative agents that aims to enhance the experience of humans. Specifically, we model the experience of humans as the goals they expect to achieve during the task. We expect that agents should learn to enhance the extent to which humans achieve these goals while maintaining agents' original abilities (e.g., winning games). To achieve this, we propose the Reinforcement Learning from Human Gain (RLHG) approach. The RLHG approach introduces a "baseline", which corresponds to the extent to which humans primitively achieve their goals, and encourages agents to learn behaviors that can effectively enhance humans in achieving their goals better. We evaluate the RLHG agent in the popular Multi-player Online Battle Arena (MOBA) game, Honor of Kings, by conducting real-world human-agent tests. Both objective performance and subjective preference results show that the RLHG agent provides participants better gaming experience. | Yiming Gao, Feiyu Liu, Liang Wang, Dehua Zheng, Zhenjie Lian, Weixuan Wang, Wenjin Yang, Siqin Li, Xianliang Wang, Wenhui Chen, Jing Dai, Qiang Fu, Wei Yang, Lanxiao Huang, Wei Liu |  |

While effective, this approach neglects the inductive bias offered by time-frequency representations, resulting in reduntant and computionally-intensive upsampling operations. Fourier-based time-frequency representation is an appealing alternative, aligning more accurately with human auditory perception, and benefitting from well-established fast algorithms for its computation. Nevertheless, direct reconstruction of complex-valued spectrograms has been historically problematic, primarily due to phase recovery issues. This study seeks to close this gap by presenting Vocos, a new model that directly generates Fourier spectral coefficients. Vocos not only matches the state-of-the-art in audio quality, as demonstrated in our evaluations, but it also substantially improves computational efficiency, achieving an order of magnitude increase in speed compared to prevailing time-domain neural vocoding approaches. The source code and model weights have been open-sourced. | Hubert Siuzdak |  |

We take an \`\`agnostic'' view in the following sense: we consider the cost as a function of sample size for any target function, even if the sample size is not large enough for consistency or the target is outside the RKHS. We analyze the cost of overfitting under a Gaussian universality ansatz using recently derived (non-rigorous) risk estimates in terms of the task eigenstructure. Our analysis provides a more refined characterization of benign, tempered and catastrophic overfitting (cf. Mallinar et al. 2022). | Lijia Zhou, James B. Simon, Gal Vardi, Nathan Srebro |  |

Recently, there has been a surge of interest in explaining the classic k-means algorithm, leading to efficient algorithms that approximate k-means clusters using axis-aligned decision trees. However, interpretable variants of k-means have limited applicability in practice, where more flexible clustering methods are often needed to obtain useful partitions of the data. In this work, we investigate interpretable kernel clustering, and propose algorithms that construct decision trees to approximate the partitions induced by kernel k-means, a nonlinear extension of k-means. We further build on previous work on explainable k-means and demonstrate how a suitable choice of features allows preserving interpretability without sacrificing approximation guarantees on the interpretable model. | Maximilian Fleissner, Leena Chennuru Vankadara, Debarghya Ghoshdastidar |  |
| 898 |  |  [Provable Benefits of Multi-task RL under Non-Markovian Decision Making Processes](https://openreview.net/forum?id=U6Qulbv2qT) |  | 0 | In multi-task reinforcement learning (RL) under Markov decision processes (MDPs), the presence of shared latent structures among multiple MDPs has been shown to yield significant benefits to the sample efficiency compared to single-task RL. In this paper, we investigate whether such a benefit can extend to more general sequential decision making problems such as predictive state representations (PSRs). The main challenge here is that the large and complex model space makes it hard to identify what types of common latent structure of multi-task PSRs can reduce the model complexity and improve sample efficiency. To this end, we posit a joint model class for tasks and use the notion of $\eta$-bracketing number to quantify its complexity; this number also serves as a general metric to capture the similarity of tasks and thus determines the benefit of multi-task over single-task RL. We first study upstream multi-task learning over PSRs, in which all tasks share the same observation and action spaces. We propose a provably efficient algorithm UMT-PSR for finding near-optimal policies for all PSRs, and demonstrate that the advantage of multi-task learning manifests if the joint model class of PSRs has a smaller $\eta$-bracketing number compared to that of individual single-task learning. We further investigate downstream learning, in which the agent needs to learn a new target task that shares some commonalities with the upstream tasks via a similarity constraint. By exploiting the learned PSRs from the upstream, we develop a sample-efficient algorithm that provably finds a near-optimal policy. Upon specialization to some examples with small $\eta$-bracketing numbers, our results further highlight the benefit compared to directly learning a single-task PSR. | Ruiquan Huang, Yuan Cheng, Jing Yang, Vincent Tan, Yingbin Liang |  |

In SNNs, delays refer to the time needed for one spike to travel from one neuron to another. These delays matter because they influence the spike arrival times, and it is well-known that spiking neurons respond more strongly to coincident input spikes. More formally, it has been shown theoretically that plastic delays greatly increase the expressivity in SNNs. Yet, efficient algorithms to learn these delays have been lacking. Here, we propose a new discrete-time algorithm that addresses this issue in deep feedforward SNNs using backpropagation, in an offline manner. To simulate delays between consecutive layers, we use 1D convolutions across time. The kernels contain only a few non-zero weights – one per synapse – whose positions correspond to the delays. These positions are learned together with the weights using the recently proposed Dilated Convolution with Learnable Spacings (DCLS). We evaluated our method on three datasets: the Spiking Heidelberg Dataset (SHD), the Spiking Speech Commands (SSC) and its non spiking version Google Speech Commands v0.02 (GSC) benchmarks, which require detecting temporal patterns. We used feedforward SNNs with two or three hidden fully connected layers, and vanilla leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. We showed that fixed random delays help and that learning them helps even more. Furthermore, our method outperformed the state-of-the-art in the three datasets without using recurrent connections and with substantially fewer parameters. Our work demonstrates the potential of delay learning in developing accurate and precise models for temporal data processing.

If a model is trained on a sentence of the form ''_A_ is _B_'', it will not automatically generalize to the reverse direction ''_B_ is _A_''. This is the \*\*Reversal Curse\*\*. For instance, if a model is trained on ''Valentina Tereshkova was the first woman to travel to space'', it will not automatically be able to answer the question, ''Who was the first woman to travel to space?''. Moreover, the likelihood of the correct answer (''Valentina Tershkova'') will not be higher than for a random name. Thus, models do not generalize a prevalent pattern in their training set: if ''_A_ is _B_'' occurs, ''_B_ is _A_'' is more likely to occur. It is worth noting, however, that if ''_A_ is _B_'' appears _in-context_, models can deduce the reverse relationship. We provide evidence for the Reversal Curse by finetuning GPT-3 and Llama-1 on fictitious statements such as ''Uriah Hawthorne is the composer of _Abyssal Melodies_'' and showing that they fail to correctly answer ''Who composed _Abyssal Melodies?_''. The Reversal Curse is robust across model sizes and model families and is not alleviated by data augmentation. We also evaluate ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) on questions about real-world celebrities, such as ''Who is Tom Cruise's mother? [A: Mary Lee Pfeiffer]'' and the reverse ''Who is Mary Lee Pfeiffer's son?''. GPT-4 correctly answers questions like the former 79\% of the time, compared to 33\% for the latter.

However, these large models remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks, where adversaries manipulate prompts to elicit malicious outputs that should not be given by aligned LLMs. Investigating jailbreak prompts can lead us to delve into the limitations of LLMs and further guide us to secure them. Unfortunately, existing jailbreak techniques suffer from either (1) scalability issues, where attacks heavily rely on manual crafting of prompts, or (2) stealthiness problems, as attacks depend on token-based algorithms to generate prompts that are often semantically meaningless, making them susceptible to detection through basic perplexity testing. In light of these challenges, we intend to answer this question: Can we develop an approach that can automatically generate stealthy jailbreak prompts? In this paper, we introduce AutoDAN, a novel jailbreak attack against aligned LLMs. AutoDAN can automatically generate stealthy jailbreak prompts by the carefully designed hierarchical genetic algorithm. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that AutoDAN not only automates the process while preserving semantic meaningfulness, but also demonstrates superior attack strength in cross-model transferability, and cross-sample universality compared with the baseline. Moreover, we also compare AutoDAN with perplexity-based defense methods and show that AutoDAN can bypass them effectively.

In particular, the scarcity of real-world SAT instances and their usefulness for tuning SAT solvers underscore the necessity for effective and efficient ways of hard instance generation, whereas existing methods either struggle to maintain plausible hardness or suffer from limited applicability. Different from the typical construction-based methods, this paper introduces an adaptive and efficient graph interpolation approach that in place modifies the raw structure of graph-represented SAT instance by replacing it with a counterpart from another instance. Specifically, it involves a two-stage matching and mixing pipeline. The matching aims to find a correspondence map of literal nodes from two instance graphs via learned features from a matching network; while the mixing stage involves iteratively exchanging clause pairs with the highest correspondence scores until a specified replacement ratio is achieved. We further show that under our matching-mixing framework, moderate randomness can avoid hardness degradation of instances by introducing Gumbel noise. Experimental results show the superiority of our method with both resemblance in structure and hardness, and general applicability. | Xinyan Chen, Yang Li, Runzhong Wang, Junchi Yan |  |

Training such models, however, is quite inefficient and unstable. In this work, we show how by simply changing the temporal scheduling of the update rule for the synaptic weights leads to an algorithm that is much more efficient and stable than the original one, and has theoretical guarantees in terms of convergence. The proposed algorithm, that we call incremental predictive coding (iPC) is also more biologically plausible than the original one, as it it fully automatic. In an extensive set of experiments, we show that iPC constantly performs better than the original formulation on a large number of benchmarks for image classification, as well as for the training of both conditional and masked language models, in terms of test accuracy, efficiency, and convergence with respect to a large set of hyperparameters. | Tommaso Salvatori, Yuhang Song, Yordan Yordanov, Beren Millidge, Lei Sha, Cornelius Emde, Zhenghua Xu, Rafal Bogacz, Thomas Lukasiewicz |  |

Although several methods have recently been proposed to address this problem, they have limitations such as not guaranteeing monotonicity in certain cases, requiring additional inference time, lacking scalability with increasing network size and number of monotonic inputs, and manipulating network weights during training. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a simple but novel architecture of the partially connected network which incorporates a 'scalable monotonic hidden layer' comprising three units: the exponentiated unit, ReLU unit, and confluence unit. This allows for the repetitive integration of the scalable monotonic hidden layers without other structural constraints. Consequently, our method offers ease of implementation and rapid training through the conventional error-backpropagation algorithm. We accordingly term this method as Scalable Monotonic Neural Networks (SMNN). Numerical experiments demonstrated that our method achieved comparable prediction accuracy to the state-of-the-art approaches while effectively addressing the aforementioned weaknesses. | Hyunho Kim, JongSeok Lee |  |

Retraining-free structured pruning algorithms are crucial in pretrained language model compression due to their significantly reduced pruning cost and capability to prune large language models. However, existing retraining-free algorithms encounter severe accuracy degradation, as they fail to handle pruning errors, especially at high compression rates. In this paper, we propose KPrune (Knowledge-preserving pruning), an accurate retraining-free structured pruning algorithm for pretrained encoder-based language models. KPrune focuses on preserving the useful knowledge of the pretrained model to minimize pruning errors through a carefully designed iterative pruning process composed of knowledge measurement, knowledge-preserving mask search, and knowledge-preserving weight-tuning. As a result, KPrune shows significant accuracy improvements up to 58.02%p higher F1 score compared to existing retraining-free pruning algorithms under a high compression rate of 80% on the SQuAD benchmark without any retraining process. | Seungcheol Park, Hojun Choi, U Kang |  |
| 906 |  |  [PROGRAM: PROtotype GRAph Model based Pseudo-Label Learning for Test-Time Adaptation](https://openreview.net/forum?id=x5LvBK43wg) |  | 0 | Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to adapt a pre-trained model from a source domain to a target domain only using online unlabeled target data during testing, without accessing to the source data or modifying the original training process. Among the various TTA methods, pseudo-labeling has gained popularity. However, the presence of incorrect pseudo-labels can hinder the effectiveness of target domain adaptation. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel TTA method, called PROtotype GRAph Model based pseudo-label learning (PROGRAM). PROGRAM consists of two key components: (1) Prototype Graph Model (PGM) for reliable pseudo-label generation; (2) Robust Self-Training (RST) for test-time adaptation with noisy pseudo-labels. PGM constructs the graph using prototypes and test samples, facilitating effective message passing among them to generate more reliable pseudo-labels. RST combines the advantages of consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling to achieve robust target domain adaptation in the presence of noisy pseudo-labels. Our proposed PROGRAM can be easily integrated into existing baselines, resulting in consistent improvement.

While data documentation is widely recognized as essential to the reliability, reproducibility, and transparency of ML, we lack a systematic empirical understanding of current dataset documentation practices. To shed light on this question, here we take Hugging Face - one of the largest platforms for sharing and collaborating on ML models and datasets - as a prominent case study. By analyzing all 7,433 dataset documentation on Hugging Face, our investigation provides an overview of the Hugging Face dataset ecosystem and insights into dataset documentation practices, yielding 5 main findings: (1) The dataset card completion rate shows marked heterogeneity correlated with dataset popularity: While 86.0\% of the top 100 downloaded dataset cards fill out all sections suggested by Hugging Face community, only 7.9\% of dataset cards with no downloads complete all these sections. (2) A granular examination of each section within the dataset card reveals that the practitioners seem to prioritize Dataset Description and Dataset Structure sections, accounting for 36.2\% and 33.6\% of the total card length, respectively, for the most downloaded datasets. In contrast, the Considerations for Using the Data section receives the lowest proportion of content, accounting for just 2.1\% of the text. (3) By analyzing the subsections within each section and utilizing topic modeling to identify key topics, we uncover what is discussed in each section, and underscore significant themes encompassing both technical and social impacts, as well as limitations within the Considerations for Using the Data section. (4) Our findings also highlight the need for improved accessibility and reproducibility of datasets in the Usage sections. (5) In addition, our human annotation evaluation emphasizes the pivotal role of comprehensive dataset content in shaping individuals' perceptions of a dataset card's overall quality. Overall, our study offers a unique perspective on analyzing dataset documentation through large-scale data science analysis and underlines the need for more thorough dataset documentation in machine learning research. | Xinyu Yang, Weixin Liang, James Zou |  |

Such graphs have widespread application as a benchmark in the theoretical analysis of spectral clustering. We provide an efficient ($\epsilon$,$\delta$)-DP algorithm tailored specifically for such graphs. Our algorithm draws inspiration from the recent work of Chen et al., who developed DP algorithms for recovery of stochastic block models in cases where the graph comprises exactly two nearly-balanced clusters. Our algorithm works for well-clustered graphs with $k$ nearly-balanced clusters, and the misclassification ratio almost matches the one of the best-known non-private algorithms. We conduct experimental evaluations on datasets with known ground truth clusters to substantiate the prowess of our algorithm. We also show that any (pure) $\epsilon$-DP algorithm would result in substantial error. | Weiqiang He, Hendrik Fichtenberger, Pan Peng |  |

While several studies have investigated the function estimation capabilities of deep learning, research on dilated convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has mainly focused on cases where input dimensions are infinite but output dimensions are one-dimensional, similar to many other studies. However, many practical deep learning tasks involve high-dimensional (or even infinite dimensional) inputs and outputs. In this paper, we investigate the optimality of dilated CNNs for estimating a map between infinite-dimensional input and output spaces by analyzing their approximation and estimation abilities. For that purpose, we first show that approximation and estimation errors depend only on the smoothness and decay rate with respect to the infinity norm of the output, and their estimation accuracy actually achieve the {\it minimax optimal} rate of convergence. Second, we demonstrate that the dilated CNNs outperform {\it any} linear estimators including kernel ridge regression and $k$-NN estimators in a minimax error sense, highlighting the usefulness of feature learning realized by deep neural networks. Our theoretical analysis particularly explains the success of deep learning in recent high-dimensional input-output tasks. | Yuto Nishimura, Taiji Suzuki |  |

We mainly focus on metrics linearly decomposable into a sum of binary classification utilities applied separately to each label with an additional requirement of exactly $k$ labels predicted for each instance. These "macro-at-$k$" metrics possess desired properties for extreme classification problems with long tail labels. Unfortunately, the at-$k$ constraint couples the otherwise independent binary classification tasks, leading to a much more challenging optimization problem than standard macro-averages. We provide a statistical framework to study this problem, prove the existence and the form of the optimal classifier, and propose a statistically consistent and practical learning algorithm based on the Frank-Wolfe method. Interestingly, our main results concern even more general metrics being non-linear functions of label-wise confusion matrices. Empirical results provide evidence for the competitive performance of the proposed approach. | Erik Schultheis, Wojciech Kotlowski, Marek Wydmuch, Rohit Babbar, Strom Borman, Krzysztof Dembczynski |  |
| 911 |  |  [Dynamic Layer Tying for Parameter-Efficient Transformers](https://openreview.net/forum?id=d4uL2MSe0z) |  | 0 | In the pursuit of reducing the number of trainable parameters in deep transformer networks, we employ Reinforcement Learning to dynamically select layers during training and tie them together. Every few iterations, the RL agent is asked whether to train each layer $i$ independently or to copy the weights of a previous layer $j<i$. This facilitates weight sharing, reduces the number of trainable parameters, and also serves as an effective regularization technique. Experimental evaluations validate that our model modestly outperforms the baseline transformer model with regard to perplexity and drastically reduces the number of trainable parameters. In particular, the memory consumption during training is up to one order of magnitude less than the conventional training method. | Tamir David Hay, Lior Wolf |  |
| 912 |  |  [Consistency Trajectory Models: Learning Probability Flow ODE Trajectory of Diffusion](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ymjI8feDTD) |  | 0 | Consistency Models (CM) (Song et al., 2023) accelerate score-based diffusion model sampling at the cost of sample quality but lack a natural way to trade-off quality for speed. To address this limitation, we propose Consistency Trajectory Model (CTM), a generalization encompassing CM and score-based models as special cases. CTM trains a single neural network that can -- in a single forward pass -- output scores (i.e., gradients of log-density) and enables unrestricted traversal between any initial and final time along the Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) in a diffusion process. CTM enables the efficient combination of adversarial training and denoising score matching loss to enhance performance and achieves new state-of-the-art FIDs for single-step diffusion model sampling on CIFAR-10 (FID 1.73) and ImageNet at 64X64 resolution (FID 1.92). CTM also enables a new family of sampling schemes, both deterministic and stochastic, involving long jumps along the ODE solution trajectories. It consistently improves sample quality as computational budgets increase, avoiding the degradation seen in CM. Furthermore, unlike CM, CTM's access to the score function can streamline the adoption of established controllable/conditional generation methods from the diffusion community. This access also enables the computation of likelihood.

This has led to numerous Hardness Characterization Methods (HCMs) that aim to identify ''hard'' samples. However, there is a lack of consensus regarding the definition and evaluation of ''hardness''. Unfortunately, current HCMs have only been evaluated on specific types of hardness and often only qualitatively or with respect to downstream performance, overlooking the fundamental quantitative identification task. We address this gap by presenting a fine-grained taxonomy of hardness types. Additionally, we propose the Hardness Characterization Analysis Toolkit (H-CAT), which supports comprehensive and quantitative benchmarking of HCMs across the hardness taxonomy and can easily be extended to new HCMs, hardness types, and datasets. We use H-CAT to evaluate 13 different HCMs across 8 hardness types. This comprehensive evaluation encompassing over 14K setups uncovers strengths and weaknesses of different HCMs, leading to practical tips to guide HCM selection and future development. Our findings highlight the need for more comprehensive HCM evaluation, while we hope our hardness taxonomy and toolkit will advance the principled evaluation and uptake of data-centric AI methods. | Nabeel Seedat, Fergus Imrie, Mihaela van der Schaar |  |

Nevertheless, this practice renders them vulnerable to backdoor poisoning attacks. Prior backdoor defense strategies have primarily focused on the identification of backdoored models or poisoned data characteristics, typically operating under the assumption of access to clean data. In this work, we delve into a relatively underexplored challenge: the automatic identification of backdoor data within a poisoned dataset, all under realistic conditions, \*i.e.\*, without the need for additional clean data or without manually defining a threshold for backdoor detection. We draw an inspiration from the scaled prediction consistency (SPC) technique, which exploits the prediction invariance of poisoned data to an input scaling factor. Based on this, we pose the backdoor data identification problem as a hierarchical data splitting optimization problem, leveraging a novel SPC-based loss function as the primary optimization objective. Our innovation unfolds in several key aspects. First, we revisit the vanilla SPC method, unveiling its limitations in addressing the proposed backdoor identification problem. Subsequently, we develop a bi-level optimization-based approach to precisely identify backdoor data by minimizing the advanced SPC loss. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposal against a spectrum of backdoor attacks, encompassing basic label-corrupted attacks as well as more sophisticated clean-label attacks, evaluated across various benchmark datasets. Experiment results show that our approach often surpasses the performance of current baselines in identifying backdoor data points, resulting in about 4\%-36\% improvement in average AUROC.

While EF was proposed almost a decade ago (Seide et al, 2014), and despite concentrated effort by the community to advance the theoretical understanding of this mechanism, there is still a lot to explore. In this work we study a modern form of error feedback called EF21 (Richtárik et al, 2021) which offers the currently best-known theoretical guarantees, under the weakest assumptions, and also works well in practice. In particular, while the theoretical communication complexity of EF21 depends on the quadratic mean of certain smoothness parameters, we improve this dependence to their arithmetic mean, which is always smaller, and can be substantially smaller, especially in heterogeneous data regimes. We take the reader on a journey of our discovery process. Starting with the idea of applying EF21 to an equivalent reformulation of the underlying problem which (unfortunately) requires (often impractical) machine cloning, we continue to the discovery of a new weighted version of EF21 which can (fortunately) be executed without any cloning, and finally circle back to an improved analysis of the original EF21 method. While this development applies to the simplest form of EF21, our approach naturally extends to more elaborate variants involving stochastic gradients and partial participation. Further, our technique improves the best-known theory of EF21 in the rare features regime (Richtárik et al, 2023). Finally, we validate our theoretical findings with suitable experiments. | Peter Richtárik, Elnur Gasanov, Konstantin Burlachenko |  |

Often, task success is defined based on the relationship between two objects - for instance, hanging a mug on a rack. In such cases, the solution should be equivariant to the initial position of the objects as well as the agent, and invariant to the pose of the camera. This poses a challenge for learning systems which attempt to solve this task by learning directly from high-dimensional demonstrations: the agent must learn to be both equivariant as well as precise, which can be challenging without any inductive biases about the problem. In this work, we propose a method for precise relative pose prediction which is provably SE(3)-equivariant, can be learned from only a few demonstrations, and can generalize across variations in a class of objects. We accomplish this by factoring the problem into learning an SE(3) invariant task-specific representation of the scene and then interpreting this representation with novel geometric reasoning layers which are provably SE(3) equivariant. We demonstrate that our method can yield substantially more precise placement predictions in simulated placement tasks than previous methods trained with the same amount of data, and can accurately represent relative placement relationships data collected from real-world demonstrations.

We propose a general methodology to combine the power of LLMs and automated reasoners for automated program verification. We formally describe this methodology as a set of derivation rules and prove its soundness. We instantiate the calculus as a sound automated verification procedure, which led to practical improvements on a set of synthetic and competition benchmarks. | Haoze Wu, Clark W.

To address this challenge, we present ViLMA (Video Language Model Assessment), a task-agnostic benchmark that places the assessment of fine-grained capabilities of these models on a firm footing. Task-based evaluations, while valuable, fail to capture the complexities and specific temporal aspects of moving images that VidLMs need to process. Through carefully curated counterfactuals, ViLMA offers a controlled evaluation suite that sheds light on the true potential of these models, as well as their performance gaps compared to human-level understanding. ViLMA also includes proficiency tests, which assess basic capabilities deemed essential to solving the main counterfactual tests. We show that current VidLMs’ grounding abilities are no better than those of vision-language models which use static images. This is especially striking once the performance on proficiency tests is factored in. Our benchmark serves as a catalyst for future research on VidLMs, helping to highlight areas that still need to be explored. | Ilker Kesen, Andrea Pedrotti, Mustafa Dogan, Michele Cafagna, Emre Can Acikgoz, Letitia Parcalabescu, Iacer Calixto, Anette Frank, Albert Gatt, Aykut Erdem, Erkut Erdem |  |

Recent research has illuminated a key factor contributing to its practical efficacy: the implicit regularization it instigates. Several studies have investigated the linear stability property of SGD in the vicinity of a stationary point as a predictive proxy for sharpness and generalization error in overparameterized neural networks (Wu et al., 2022; Jastrzebski et al., 2019; Cohen et al., 2021). In this paper, we delve deeper into the relationship between linear stability and sharpness. More specifically, we meticulously delineate the necessary and sufficient conditions for linear stability, contingent on hyperparameters of SGD and the sharpness at the optimum. Towards this end, we introduce a novel coherence measure of the loss Hessian that encapsulates pertinent geometric properties of the loss function that are relevant to the linear stability of SGD. It enables us to provide a simplified sufficient condition for identifying linear instability at an optimum. Notably, compared to previous works, our analysis relies on significantly milder assumptions and is applicable for a broader class of loss functions than known before, encompassing not only mean-squared error but also cross-entropy loss. | Gregory Dexter, Borja Ocejo, S.

Audio-language models (ALMs) trained using a contrastive approach (e.g., CLAP) that learns a shared representation between audio and language modalities have improved performance in many downstream applications, including zero-shot audio classification, audio retrieval, etc. However, the ability of these models to effectively perform compositional reasoning remains largely unexplored and necessitates additional research. In this paper, we propose CompA, a collection of two expert-annotated benchmarks with a majority of real-world audio samples, to evaluate compositional reasoning in ALMs. Our proposed CompA-order evaluates how well an ALM understands the order or occurrence of acoustic events in audio, and CompA-attribute evaluates attribute-binding of acoustic events. An instance from either benchmark consists of two audio-caption pairs, where both audios have the same acoustic events but with different compositions. An ALM is evaluated on how well it matches the right audio to the right caption. Using this benchmark, we first show that current ALMs perform only marginally better than random chance, thereby struggling with compositional reasoning. Next, we propose CompA-CLAP, where we fine-tune CLAP using a novel learning method to improve its compositional reasoning abilities. To train CompA-CLAP, we first propose improvements to contrastive training with composition-aware hard negatives, allowing for more focused training. Next, we propose a novel modular contrastive loss that helps the model learn fine-grained compositional understanding and overcomes the acute scarcity of openly available compositional audios. CompA-CLAP significantly improves over all our baseline models on the CompA benchmark, indicating its superior compositional reasoning capabilities. | Sreyan Ghosh, Ashish Seth, Sonal Kumar, Utkarsh Tyagi, Chandra Kiran Reddy Evuru, Ramaneswaran S., Sakshi Singh, Oriol Nieto, Ramani Duraiswami, Dinesh Manocha |  |

However, a primary constraint they face is the context limit, i.e., the maximum number of tokens they can process. Previous works have explored architectural changes and modifications in positional encoding to relax the constraint, but they often require expensive training or do not address the computational demands of self-attention. In this paper, we present Hierarchical cOntext MERging (HOMER), a new training-free scheme designed to overcome the limitations. HOMER uses a divide-and-conquer algorithm, dividing long inputs into manageable chunks. Each chunk is then processed collectively, employing a hierarchical strategy that merges adjacent chunks at progressive transformer layers. A token reduction technique precedes each merging, ensuring memory usage efficiency. We also propose an optimized computational order reducing the memory requirement to logarithmically scale with respect to input length, making it especially favorable for environments with tight memory restrictions. Our experiments demonstrate the proposed method's superior performance and memory efficiency, enabling the broader use of LLMs in contexts requiring extended context.

However, the intrinsic mutual interference among image regions contradicts the need for practical downstream application scenarios where the preservation of low-level pixel information from given conditioning is desired (e.g., customization tasks like personalized generation and inpainting based on a user-provided single image). In this work, we investigate the diffusion (physics) in diffusion (machine learning) properties and propose our Cyclic One-Way Diffusion (COW) method to control the direction of diffusion phenomenon given a pre-trained frozen diffusion model for versatile customization application scenarios, where the low-level pixel information from the conditioning needs to be preserved. Notably, unlike most current methods that incorporate additional conditions by fine-tuning the base text-to-image diffusion model or learning auxiliary networks, our method provides a novel perspective to understand the task needs and is applicable to a wider range of customization scenarios in a learning-free manner. Extensive experiment results show that our proposed COW can achieve more flexible customization based on strict visual conditions in different application settings.

Recently, studies revealed their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. In this work, we theoretically define the concept of expected robustness in the context of attributed graphs and relate it to the classical definition of adversarial robustness in the graph representation learning literature. Our definition allows us to derive an upper bound of the expected robustness of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Graph Isomorphism Networks subject to node feature attacks. Building on these findings, we connect the expected robustness of GNNs to the orthonormality of their weight matrices and consequently propose an attack-independent, more robust variant of the GCN, called the Graph Convolutional Orthonormal Robust Networks (GCORNs). We further introduce a probabilistic method to estimate the expected robustness, which allows us to evaluate the effectiveness of GCORN on several real-world datasets. Experimental experiments showed that GCORN outperforms available defense methods.

Offline GCRL is pivotal for developing generalist agents capable of leveraging pre-existing datasets to learn diverse and reusable skills without hand-engineering reward functions. However, contemporary approaches to GCRL based on supervised learning and contrastive learning are often suboptimal in the offline setting. An alternative perspective on GCRL optimizes for occupancy matching, but necessitates learning a discriminator, which subsequently serves as a pseudo-reward for downstream RL. Inaccuracies in the learned discriminator can cascade, negatively influencing the resulting policy. We present a novel approach to GCRL under a new lens of mixture-distribution matching, leading to our discriminator-free method: SMORe. The key insight is combining the occupancy matching perspective of GCRL with a convex dual formulation to derive a learning objective that can better leverage suboptimal offline data. SMORe learns \*scores\* or unnormalized densities representing the importance of taking an action at a state for reaching a particular goal. SMORe is principled and our extensive experiments on the fully offline GCRL benchmark composed of robot manipulation and locomotion tasks, including high-dimensional observations, show that SMORe can outperform state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin. | Harshit Sikchi, Rohan Chitnis, Ahmed Touati, Alborz Geramifard, Amy Zhang, Scott Niekum |  |

However, many concerns regarding the client-side detectability of MS attacks were raised, questioning their practicality. In this work, for the first time, we thoroughly study client-side detectability. We first demonstrate that all prior MS attacks are detectable by principled checks, and formulate a necessary set of requirements that a practical MS attack must satisfy. Next, we propose SEER, a novel attack framework that satisfies these requirements. The key insight of SEER is the use of a secret decoder, jointly trained with the shared model. We show that SEER can steal user data from gradients of realistic networks, even for large batch sizes of up to 512 and under secure aggregation. Our work is a promising step towards assessing the true vulnerability of federated learning in real-world settings. | Kostadin Garov, Dimitar Iliev Dimitrov, Nikola Jovanovic, Martin T. Vechev |  |

Existing works usually assume that the input images are captured by a global shutter camera. Thus, rolling shutter (RS) images cannot be trivially applied to an off-the-shelf NeRF algorithm for novel view synthesis. Rolling shutter effect would also affect the accuracy of the camera pose estimation (e.g. via COLMAP), which further prevents the success of NeRF algorithm with RS images. In this paper, we propose Unrolling Shutter Bundle Adjusted Neural Radiance Fields (USB-NeRF). USB-NeRF is able to correct rolling shutter distortions and recover accurate camera motion trajectory simultaneously under the framework of NeRF, by modeling the physical image formation process of a RS camera. Experimental results demonstrate that USB-NeRF achieves better performance compared to prior works, in terms of RS effect removal, novel view image synthesis as well as camera motion estimation. Furthermore, our algorithm can also be used to recover high-fidelity high frame-rate global shutter video from a sequence of RS images. | Moyang Li, Peng Wang, Lingzhe Zhao, Bangyan Liao, Peidong Liu |  |

The recent progress in large-scale generative models has further expanded their use in real-world language applications. However, the critical challenge of improving the generalizability and factuality of LLMs in natural language understanding and question answering remains under-explored. While previous in-context learning research has focused on enhancing models to adhere to users' specific instructions and quality expectations, and to avoid undesired outputs, little to no work has explored the use of task-specific fine-tuned Language Models (SLMs) to improve LLMs' in-context learning during the inference stage. Our primary contribution is the establishment of a simple yet effective framework that enhances the reliability of LLMs as it: 1) generalizes out-of-distribution data, 2) elucidates how LLMs benefit from discriminative models, and 3) minimizes hallucinations in generative tasks. Using our proposed plug-in method, enhanced versions of Llama 2 and ChatGPT surpass their original versions regarding generalizability and factuality. We offer a comprehensive suite of resources, including 16 curated datasets, prompts, model checkpoints, and LLM outputs across 9 distinct tasks. Our empirical analysis sheds light on the advantages of incorporating discriminative models into LLMs and highlights the potential of our methodology in fostering more reliable LLMs. | Linyi Yang, Shuibai Zhang, Zhuohao Yu, Guangsheng Bao, Yidong Wang, Jindong Wang, Ruochen Xu, Wei Ye, Xing Xie, Weizhu Chen, Yue Zhang |  |

However, even small adversarial perturbations during the inference can violate the exchangeability assumption, challenge the coverage guarantees, and result in a subsequent decline in empirical coverage. In this work, we propose a certifiably robust learning-reasoning conformal prediction framework (COLEP) via probabilistic circuits, which comprise a data-driven learning component that trains statistical models to learn different semantic concepts, and a reasoning component that encodes knowledge and characterizes the relationships among the trained models for logic reasoning. To achieve exact and efficient reasoning, we employ probabilistic circuits (PCs) within the reasoning component. Theoretically, we provide end-to-end certification of prediction coverage for COLEP in the presence of $\ell_2$ bounded adversarial perturbations. We also provide certified coverage considering the finite size of the calibration set. Furthermore, we prove that COLEP achieves higher prediction coverage and accuracy over a single model as long as the utilities of knowledge models are non-trivial. Empirically, we show the validity and tightness of our certified coverage, demonstrating the robust conformal prediction of COLEP on various datasets, including GTSRB, CIFAR10, and AwA2. We show that COLEP achieves up to 12% improvement in certified coverage on GTSRB, 9% on CIFAR-10, and 14% on AwA2. | Mintong Kang, Nezihe Merve Gürel, Linyi Li, Bo Li |  |

For example, goal-conditioned reinforcement learning can be viewed as learning representations to predict which states are likely to be visited in the future. While prior methods have used contrastive predictive coding to model time series data, learning representations that encode long-term dependencies usually requires large amounts of data. In this paper, we introduce a temporal difference version of contrastive predictive coding that stitches together pieces of different time series data to decrease the amount of data required to learn predictions of future events. We apply this representation learning method to derive an off-policy algorithm for goal-conditioned RL. Experiments demonstrate that, compared with prior RL methods, ours achieves $2 \times$ median improvement in success rates and can better cope with stochastic environments. In tabular settings, we show that our method is about $20\times$ more sample efficient than the successor representation and $1500 \times$ more sample efficient than the standard (Monte Carlo) version of contrastive predictive coding. | Chongyi Zheng, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Benjamin Eysenbach |  |

Currently, the main alignment approach is based on reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Despite the effectiveness of RLHF, it is intricate to implement and train, thus recent studies explore how to develop alternative alignment approaches based on supervised fine-tuning (SFT). A major limitation of SFT is that it essentially does imitation learning, which can't fully understand what are the expected behaviors. To address this issue, we propose an improved alignment approach named $\textbf{FIGA}$. Different from prior methods, we incorporate fine-grained (i.e., token or phrase level) quality signals that are derived by contrasting good and bad responses. Our approach has made two major contributions. Firstly, we curate a refined alignment dataset that pairs initial responses and the corresponding revised ones. Secondly, we devise a new loss function can leverage fine-grained quailty signals to instruct the learning of LLMs for alignment. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approaches by comparing a number of competitive baselines. | Geyang Guo, Ranchi Zhao, Tianyi Tang, Xin Zhao, JiRong Wen |  |

The standard approach to data augmentation combines simple transformations like rotations and flips to generate new images from existing ones. However, these new images lack diversity along key semantic axes present in the data. Current augmentations cannot alter the high-level semantic attributes, such as animal species present in a scene, to enhance the diversity of data. We address the lack of diversity in data augmentation with image-to-image transformations parameterized by pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models. Our method edits images to change their semantics using an off-the-shelf diffusion model, and generalizes to novel visual concepts from a few labelled examples. We evaluate our approach on few-shot image classification tasks, and on a real-world weed recognition task, and observe an improvement in accuracy in tested domains. | Brandon Trabucco, Kyle Doherty, Max Gurinas, Ruslan Salakhutdinov |  |

While transparent machine learning models have been proposed for classification and regression, time series forecasting presents some unique challenges for ensuring transparency. In particular, currently used bottom-up approaches that focus on the values of the time series at specific time points (usually regularly spaced) do not provide a holistic understanding of the entire time series. This limits the applicability of ML in many critical areas. To open up these domains for ML, we propose a top-down framework of bi-level transparency, which involves understanding the higher-level trends and the lower-level properties of the predicted time series. Applying this framework, we develop TIMEVIEW, a transparent ML model for time series forecasting based on static features, complemented with an interactive visualization tool. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy and interpretability of our approach, paving the way for more transparent and reliable applications of ML in various domains. | Krzysztof Kacprzyk, Tennison Liu, Mihaela van der Schaar |  |

In contrast to prevalent sparse phase retrieval algorithms that primarily use first-order methods, we propose an innovative second-order algorithm that employs a Newton-type method with hard thresholding. This algorithm overcomes the linear convergence limitations of first-order methods while preserving their hallmark per-iteration computational efficiency. We provide theoretical guarantees that our algorithm converges to the $s$-sparse ground truth signal $\boldsymbol{x}^{\natural} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ (up to a global sign) at a quadratic convergence rate after at most $O(\log (\Vert\boldsymbol{x}^{\natural} \Vert /x_{\min}^{\natural}))$ iterations, using $\Omega(s^2\log n)$ Gaussian random samples. Numerical experiments show that our algorithm achieves a significantly faster convergence rate than state-of-the-art methods. | JianFeng Cai, Yu Long, Ruixue Wen, Jiaxi Ying |  |
| 934 |  |  [MCM: Masked Cell Modeling for Anomaly Detection in Tabular Data](https://openreview.net/forum?id=lNZJyEDxy4) |  | 0 | This paper addresses the problem of anomaly detection in tabular data, which is usually implemented in an one-class classification setting where the training set only contains normal samples. Inspired by the success of masked image/language modeling in vision and natural language domains, we extend masked modeling methods to address this problem by capturing intrinsic correlations between features in training set. Thus, a sample deviate from such correlations is related to a high possibility of anomaly. To obtain multiple and diverse correlations, we propose a novel masking strategy which generates multiple masks by learning, and design a diversity loss to reduce the similarity of different masks. Extensive experiments show our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. We also discuss the interpretability from the perspective of each individual feature and correlations between features. | Jiaxin Yin, Yuanyuan Qiao, Zitang Zhou, Xiangchao Wang, Jie Yang |  |

To address this limitation, we propose a novel graph generative network that captures the hierarchical nature of graphs and successively generates the graph sub-structures in a coarse-to-fine fashion. At each level of hierarchy, this model generates communities in parallel, followed by the prediction of cross-edges between communities using separate neural networks. This modular approach enables scalable graph generation for large and complex graphs. Moreover, we model the output distribution of edges in the hierarchical graph with a multinomial distribution and derive a recursive factorization for this distribution. This enables us to generate community graphs with integer-valued edge weights in an autoregressive manner. Empirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our proposed generative model, achieving state-of-the-art performance in terms of graph quality across various benchmark datasets.

We first establish a novel identification result to non-parametrically estimate any history-dependent policy gradient under POMDPs using the offline data. The identification enables us to solve a sequence of conditional moment restrictions and adopt the min-max learning procedure with general function approximation for estimating the policy gradient. We then provide a finite-sample non-asymptotic bound for estimating the gradient uniformly over a pre-specified policy class in terms of the sample size, length of horizon, concentratability coefficient and the measure of ill-posedness in solving the conditional moment restrictions. Lastly, by deploying the proposed gradient estimation in the gradient ascent algorithm, we show the global convergence of the proposed algorithm in finding the history-dependent optimal policy under some technical conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work studying the policy gradient method for POMDPs under the offline setting. | Mao Hong, Zhengling Qi, Yanxun Xu |  |

Many multi-agent dynamical interactions can be cast as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). While existing research has focused on studying fairness in known environments, the exploration of fairness in such systems for unknown environments remains open. In this paper, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach to achieve fairness in multi-agent finite-horizon episodic MDPs. Instead of maximizing the sum of individual agents' value functions, we introduce a fairness function that ensures equitable rewards across agents. Since the classical Bellman's equation does not hold when the sum of individual value functions is not maximized, we cannot use traditional approaches. Instead, in order to explore, we maintain a confidence bound of the unknown environment and then propose an online convex optimization based approach to obtain a policy constrained to this confidence region. We show that such an approach achieves sub-linear regret in terms of the number of episodes. Additionally, we provide a probably approximately correct (PAC) guarantee based on the obtained regret bound. We also propose an offline RL algorithm and bound the optimality gap with respect to the optimal fair solution. To mitigate computational complexity, we introduce a policy-gradient type method for the fair objective. Simulation experiments also demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. | Peizhong Ju, Arnob Ghosh, Ness B. Shroff |  |

Despite bringing significant performance improvements across a variety of multi-step reasoning tasks, it is a high-cost method that requires multiple sampling with the preset size. In this paper, we propose a simple and scalable sampling process, Early-Stopping Self-Consistency (ESC), to greatly reduce the cost of SC without sacrificing performance. On this basis, one control scheme for ESC is further derivated to dynamically choose the performance-cost balance for different tasks and models. To demonstrate ESC's effectiveness, we conducted extensive experiments on three popular categories of reasoning tasks: arithmetic, commonsense and symbolic reasoning over language models with varying scales. The empirical results show that ESC reduces the average number of sampling of chain-of-thought reasoning by a significant margin on six benchmarks, including MATH (-33.8%), GSM8K (-80.1%), StrategyQA (-76.8%), CommonsenseQA (-78.5%), Coin Flip (-84.2%) and Last Letters (-67.4%), while attaining comparable performances. | Yiwei Li, Peiwen Yuan, Shaoxiong Feng, Boyuan Pan, Xinglin Wang, Bin Sun, Heda Wang, Kan Li |  |

Constructing positive pairs is non-trivial as the pairing must be similar enough to reflect a shared semantic meaning, but different enough to capture within-class variation. Classical approaches in vision use augmentations to exploit well-established invariances to construct positive pairs, but invariances in the time-series domain are much less obvious. In our work, we propose a novel method of using a learned measure for identifying positive pairs. Our Retrieval-Based Reconstruction (REBAR) measure measures the similarity between two sequences as the reconstruction error that results from reconstructing one sequence with retrieved information from the other. Then, if the two sequences have high REBAR similarity, we label them as a positive pair. Through validation experiments, we show that the REBAR error is a predictor of mutual class membership. Once integrated into a contrastive learning framework, our REBAR method learns an embedding that achieves state-of-the-art performance on downstream tasks across various modalities. | Maxwell A.

| 940 |  |  [CoLiDE: Concomitant Linear DAG Estimation](https://openreview.net/forum?id=fGAIgO75dG) |  | 0 | We deal with the combinatorial problem of learning directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure from observational data adhering to a linear structural equation model (SEM). Leveraging advances in differentiable, nonconvex characterizations of acyclicity, recent efforts have advocated a continuous constrained optimization paradigm to efficiently explore the space of DAGs. Most existing methods employ lasso-type score functions to guide this search, which (i) require expensive penalty parameter retuning when the $\textit{unknown}$ SEM noise variances change across problem instances; and (ii) implicitly rely on limiting homoscedasticity assumptions. In this work, we propose a new convex score function for sparsity-aware learning of linear DAGs, which incorporates concomitant estimation of scale and thus effectively decouples the sparsity parameter from noise levels. Regularization via a smooth, nonconvex acyclicity penalty term yields CoLiDE ($\textbf{Co}$ncomitant $\textbf{Li}$near $\textbf{D}$AG $\textbf{E}$stimation), a regression-based criterion amenable to efficient gradient computation and closed-form estimation of exogenous noise levels in heteroscedastic scenarios. Our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods without incurring added complexity, especially when the DAGs are larger and the noise level profile is heterogeneous. We also find CoLiDE exhibits enhanced stability manifested via reduced standard deviations in several domain-specific metrics, underscoring the robustness of our novel linear DAG estimator. | Seyed Saman Saboksayr, Gonzalo Mateos, Mariano Tepper |  |
| 941 |  |  [Scaling Convex Neural Networks with Burer-Monteiro Factorization](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ikmuHqugN7) |  | 0 | It has been demonstrated that the training problem for a variety of (non) linear two-layer neural networks (such as two-layer perceptrons, convolutional networks, and self-attention) can be posed as equivalent convex optimization problems, with an induced regularizer which encourages low rank. However, this regularizer becomes prohibitively expensive to compute at moderate scales, impeding training convex neural networks. To this end, we propose applying the Burer-Monteiro factorization to convex neural networks, which for the first time enables a Burer-Monteiro perspective on neural networks with non-linearities. This factorization leads to an equivalent yet computationally tractable non-convex alternative with no spurious local minima. We develop a novel relative optimality bound of stationary points of the Burer-Monteiro factorization, providing verifiable conditions under which any stationary point is a global optimum. Further, for the first time, we show that linear self-attention with sufficiently many heads has no spurious local minima. Our experiments validate the novel relative optimality bound and the utility of the Burer-Monteiro factorization for scaling convex neural networks. | Arda Sahiner, Tolga Ergen, Batu Ozturkler, John M.

This study seeks to extend the power of pretraining methodologies to facilitating the prediction over tables in data science, a domain traditionally overlooked, yet inherently challenging due to the plethora of table schemas intrinsic to different tasks. The primary research questions underpinning this work revolve around the establishment of a universal pretraining protocol for tables with varied structures, the generalizability and transferability of learned knowledge across tasks, the adaptation to diverse downstream applications, and the incorporation of incremental columns over time. In response to these challenges, we introduce UniTabE, a straightforward yet effective method designed to process tables in a uniform manner, devoid of constraints imposed by specific table structures. UniTabE's core concept relies on representing each basic table element with a module, termed TabUnit. This is subsequently followed by a Transformer encoder to refine the representation. Moreover, our model is designed to facilitate pretraining and finetuning through the utilization of free-form prompts. In order to implement the pretraining phase, we curated an expansive tabular dataset comprising approximately 13 billion samples, meticulously gathered from the Kaggle platform. This research primarily centers on classification and regression tasks involving tabular data, and conducts rigorous experimental testing and analyses to validate the effectiveness of our methodology. The experimental results demonstrate UniTabE's superior performance against several baseline models across a multitude of benchmark datasets. This, therefore, underscores UniTabE's potential to significantly enhance the semantic representation of tabular data, thereby marking a significant stride for tabular data analysis. | Yazheng Yang, Yuqi Wang, Guang Liu, Ledell Wu, Qi Liu |  |

Currently, the dominant architecture in speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) remains the encoder-decoder paradigm, creating a need to investigate the impact of language modeling approaches in this area. In this study, we introduce PolyVoice, a language model-based framework designed for S2ST systems. Our framework comprises three decoder-only language models: a translation language model, a duration language model, and a speech synthesis language model. These language models employ different types of prompts to extract learned information effectively. By utilizing unsupervised semantic units, our framework can transfer semantic information across these models, making it applicable even to unwritten languages. We evaluate our system on Chinese $\rightarrow$ English and English $\rightarrow$ Spanish language pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that \method outperforms the state-of-the-art encoder-decoder model, producing voice-cloned speech with high translation and audio quality.

However, their security is threatened by backdoor attacks, which are achieved by adding artificial patterns to specific training data. Existing defense strategies primarily focus on using reverse engineering to reproduce the backdoor trigger generated by attackers and subsequently repair the DNN model by adding the trigger into inputs and fine-tuning the model with ground truth labels. However, once the trigger generated by the attackers is complex and invisible, the defender cannot reproduce the trigger successfully then the DNN model will not be repaired, as the trigger is not effectively removed. In this work, we propose Adversarial Feature Map Pruning for Backdoor (FMP) to mitigate backdoor from the DNN. Unlike existing defense strategies, which focus on reproducing backdoor triggers, FMP attempts to prune backdoor feature maps, which are trained to extract backdoor information from inputs. After pruning these backdoor feature maps, FMP will fine-tune the model with a secure subset of training data. Our experiments demonstrate that, compared to existing defense strategies, FMP can effectively reduce the Attack Success Rate (ASR) even against the most complex and invisible attack triggers (e.g., FMP decreases the ASR to 2.86% in CIFAR10, which is 19.2% to 65.41% lower than baselines). Second, unlike conventional defense methods that tend to exhibit low robust accuracy (that is, the accuracy of the model on poisoned data), FMP achieves a higher RA, indicating its superiority in maintaining model performance while mitigating the effects of backdoor attacks (e.g., FMP obtains 87.40% RA in CIFAR10).

However, despite substantial progress, a wide and poorly understood accuracy gap to standard networks remains, raising the question of whether this is due to fundamental limitations of convex relaxations. Initial work investigating this question focused on the simple and widely used IBP relaxation. It revealed that some univariate, convex, continuous piecewise linear (CPWL) functions cannot be encoded by any ReLU network such that its IBP-analysis is precise. To explore whether this limitation is shared by more advanced convex relaxations, we conduct the first in-depth study on the expressive power of ReLU networks across all commonly used convex relaxations. We show that: (i) more advanced relaxations allow a larger class of univariate functions to be expressed as precisely analyzable ReLU networks, (ii) more precise relaxations can allow exponentially larger solution spaces of ReLU networks encoding the same functions, and (iii) even using the most precise single-neuron relaxations, it is impossible to construct precisely analyzable ReLU networks that express multivariate, convex, monotone CPWL functions. | Maximilian Baader, Mark Niklas Müller, Yuhao Mao, Martin T.

However, generating fine-grained segmentation masks with diffusion models often requires additional training on annotated datasets, leaving it unclear to what extent pre-trained diffusion models alone understand the semantic relations of their generated images. To address this question, we leverage the semantic knowledge extracted from Stable Diffusion (SD) and aim to develop an image segmentor capable of generating fine-grained segmentation maps without any additional training. The primary difficulty stems from the fact that semantically meaningful feature maps typically exist only in the spatially lower-dimensional layers, which poses a challenge in directly extracting pixel-level semantic relations from these feature maps. To overcome this issue, our framework identifies semantic correspondences between image pixels and spatial locations of low-dimensional feature maps by exploiting SD's generation process and utilizes them for constructing image-resolution segmentation maps. In extensive experiments, the produced segmentation maps are demonstrated to be well delineated and capture detailed parts of the images, indicating the existence of highly accurate pixel-level semantic knowledge in diffusion models.

Position Embedding (PE) scaling methods, while effective in extending the context window to a specific length, demonstrate either notable limitations in their extrapolation abilities or sacrificing partial performance within the context window. Length extrapolation methods, although theoretically capable of extending the context window beyond the training sequence length, often underperform in practical long-context applications. To address these challenges, we propose Continuous Length EXtrapolation (CLEX) for LLMs. We generalise the PE scaling approaches to model the continuous dynamics by ordinary differential equations over the length scaling factor, thereby overcoming the constraints of current PE scaling methods designed for specific lengths. Moreover, by extending the dynamics to desired context lengths beyond the training sequence length, CLEX facilitates the length extrapolation with impressive performance in practical tasks. We demonstrate that CLEX can be seamlessly incorporated into LLMs equipped with Rotary Position Embedding, such as LLaMA and GPT-NeoX, with negligible impact on training and inference latency. Experimental results reveal that CLEX can effectively extend the context window to over 4× or almost 8× training length, with no deterioration in performance. Furthermore, when evaluated on the practical LongBench benchmark, our model trained on a 4k length exhibits competitive performance against state-of-the-art open-source models trained on context lengths up to 32k.

Recent works have extended GPs to model scalar and vector quantities distributed over non-Euclidean domains, including smooth manifolds, appearing in numerous fields such as computer vision, dynamical systems, and neuroscience. However, these approaches assume that the manifold underlying the data is known, limiting their practical utility. We introduce RVGP, a generalisation of GPs for learning vector signals over latent Riemannian manifolds. Our method uses positional encoding with eigenfunctions of the connection Laplacian, associated with the tangent bundle, readily derived from common graph-based approximation of data. We demonstrate that RVGP possesses global regularity over the manifold, which allows it to super-resolve and inpaint vector fields while preserving singularities. Furthermore, we use RVGP to reconstruct high-density neural dynamics derived from low-density EEG recordings in healthy individuals and Alzheimer's patients. We show that vector field singularities are important disease markers and that their reconstruction leads to a comparable classification accuracy of disease states to high-density recordings. Thus, our method overcomes a significant practical limitation in experimental and clinical applications. | Robert L. Peach, Matteo VinaoCarl, Nir Grossman, Michael David, Emma Mallas, David J.

We focus on two self-attention mechanisms: (1) UHAT (Unique Hard Attention Transformers) and (2) AHAT (Average Hard Attention Transformers). UHAT encoders are known to recognize only languages inside the circuit complexity class ${\sf AC}^0$, i.e., accepted by a family of poly-sized and depth-bounded boolean circuits with unbounded fan-ins. On the other hand, AHAT encoders can recognize languages outside ${\sf AC}^0$), but their expressive power still lies within the bigger circuit complexity class ${\sf TC}^0$, i.e., ${\sf AC}^0$-circuits extended by majority gates. We first show a negative result that there is an ${\sf AC}^0$-language that cannot be recognized by an UHAT encoder. On the positive side, we show that UHAT encoders can recognize a rich fragment of ${\sf AC}^0$-languages, namely, all languages definable in first-order logic with arbitrary unary numerical predicates. This logic, includes, for example, all regular languages from ${\sf AC}^0$. We then show that AHAT encoders can recognize all languages of our logic even when we enrich it with counting terms. Using these results, we obtain a characterization of which counting properties are expressible by UHAT and AHAT, in relation to regular languages. | Pablo Barceló, Alexander Kozachinskiy, Anthony Widjaja Lin, Vladimir V.

High-quality medical fairness datasets are needed to promote fairness learning research. Existing medical fairness datasets are all for classification tasks, and no fairness datasets are available for medical segmentation, while medical segmentation is an equally important clinical task as classifications, which can provide detailed spatial information on organ abnormalities ready to be assessed by clinicians. In this paper, we propose the first fairness dataset for medical segmentation named Harvard-FairSeg with 10,000 subject samples. In addition, we propose a fair error-bound scaling approach to reweight the loss function with the upper error-bound in each identity group, using the segment anything model (SAM). We anticipate that the segmentation performance equity can be improved by explicitly tackling the hard cases with high training errors in each identity group. To facilitate fair comparisons, we utilize a novel equity-scaled segmentation performance metric to compare segmentation metrics in the context of fairness, such as the equity-scaled Dice coefficient. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our fair error-bound scaling approach either has superior or comparable fairness performance to the state-of-the-art fairness learning models.

Each task is associated with a customizable number of exclusive specialized skills and also benefits from skills shared with peer tasks. A skill assignment matrix is jointly learned. To evaluate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments on the Super-NaturalInstructions and the SuperGLUE benchmarks. Our findings demonstrate that $\texttt{C-Poly}$ outperforms fully-shared, task-specific, and skill-indistinguishable baselines, significantly enhancing the sample efficiency in multi-task learning scenarios. | Haowen Wang, Tao Sun, Congyun Jin, Yingbo Wang, Yibo Fan, Yunqi Xu, Yuliang Du, Cong Fan |  |

Despite these remarkable advances, the application of text-to-image generative models in computer vision for standard visual recognition tasks remains limited. The current de facto approach for these tasks is to design model architectures and loss functions that are tailored to the task at hand. In this paper, we develop a unified language interface for computer vision tasks that abstracts away task specific design choices and enables task execution by following natural language instructions. Our approach involves casting multiple computer vision tasks as text-to-image generation problems. Here, the text represents an instruction describing the task, and the resulting image is a visually-encoded task output. To train our model, we pool commonly-used computer vision datasets covering a range of tasks, including segmentation, object detection, depth estimation, and classification. We then use a large language model to paraphrase prompt templates that convey the specific tasks to be conducted on each image, and through this process, we create a multi-modal and multi-task training dataset comprising input and output images along with annotated instructions. Following the InstructPix2Pix architecture, we apply instruction-tuning to a text-to-image diffusion model using our constructed dataset, steering its functionality from a generative model to an instruction-guided multi-task vision learner. Experiments demonstrate that our model, dubbed InstructCV, performs competitively compared to other generalist and task-specific vision models. Moreover, it exhibits compelling generalization capabilities to unseen data, categories, and user instructions. | Yulu Gan, Sungwoo Park, Alexander Schubert, Anthony Philippakis, Ahmed M. Alaa |  |

Consequently, many defense methods have been proposed to alleviate the deleterious effects of adversarial attacks and learn robust graph representations. However, most of them are difficult to \*simultaneously\* avoid two major limitations: (i) an emergent and severe degradation in robustness when exposed to very intense attacks, and (ii) heavy computation complexity hinders them from scaling to large graphs. In response to these challenges, we introduce an innovative graph defense method for unpredictable real-world scenarios by \*designing a graph robust learning framework that is resistant to robustness degradation\* and \*refraining from unscalable designs with heavy computation\*: specifically, our method employs a denoising module, which eliminates edges that are associated with attacked nodes to reconstruct a cleaner graph; Then, it applies Mixture-of-Experts to select differentially private noises with varying magnitudes to counteract the hidden features attacked at different intensities toward robust predictions; Moreover, our overall design avoids the reliance on heavy adjacency matrix computations, such as SVD, thus facilitating its applicability even on large graphs. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the anti-degraded robustness and scalability of our method, as compared to popular graph adversarial learning methods, under diverse attack intensities and various datasets of different sizes. | Xiangchi Yuan, Chunhui Zhang, Yijun Tian, Yanfang Ye, Chuxu Zhang |  |

One physically inspired hypothesis suggests that the cortical sheet may act like a wave-propagating system capable of invertibly storing a short-term memory of sequential stimuli through induced waves traveling across the cortical surface, and indeed many experimental results from neuroscience correlate wave activity with memory tasks. To date, however, the computational implications of this idea have remained hypothetical due to the lack of a simple recurrent neural network architecture capable of exhibiting such waves. In this work, we introduce a model to fill this gap, which we denote the Wave-RNN (wRNN), and demonstrate how such an architecture indeed efficiently encodes the recent past through a suite of synthetic memory tasks where wRNNs learn faster and reach significantly lower error than wave-free counterparts. We further explore the implications of this memory storage system on more complex sequence modeling tasks such as sequential image classification and find that wave-based models not only again outperform comparable wave-free RNNs while using significantly fewer parameters, but additionally perform comparably to more complex gated architectures such as LSTMs and GRUs. | T.

To unveil the underlying factors driving this phenomenon, we examine the layer-wise learning capabilities of neural networks during the transition from a standard to an adversarial setting. Our empirical findings demonstrate that selectively updating specific layers while preserving others can substantially enhance the network's learning capacity. We, therefore, propose CURE, a novel training framework that leverages a gradient prominence criterion to perform selective conservation, updating, and revision of weights. Importantly, CURE is designed to be dataset- and architecture-agnostic, ensuring its applicability across various scenarios. It effectively tackles both memorization and overfitting issues, thus enhancing the trade-off between robustness and generalization and additionally, this training approach also aids in mitigating "robust overfitting". Furthermore, our study provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of selective adversarial training and offers a promising avenue for future research. | Shruthi Gowda, Bahram Zonooz, Elahe Arani |  |

Current approaches to PbRL do not address the credit assignment problem inherent in determining which parts of a behavior most contributed to a preference resulting in data intensive approaches and subpar reward models. We address such limitations by introducing a credit assignment strategy (PRIOR) that uses a forward dynamics world model to approximate state importance within a trajectory and then guides rewards to be proportional to state importance through an auxiliary predicted return redistribution objective. Incorporating state importance into reward learning improves the speed of policy learning, overall policy performance, and reward recovery on both locomotion and manipulation tasks. For example, PRIOR achieves 80% success rate with half the amount of data compared to baselines. The performance gains and our ablations demonstrate the benefits even a simple credit assignment strategy can have on reward learning and that state importance in forward dynamics prediction is a strong proxy for a state's contribution to a preference decision. | Mudit Verma, Katherine Metcalf |  |

However, their utility is still limited by suboptimal performance on large molecular structures and limited training data. To address this gap, we explore the design space of E(3)-equivariant diffusion models, focusing on previously unexplored areas. Our extensive comparative analysis evaluates the interplay between continuous and discrete state spaces. From this investigation, we present the EQGAT-diff model, which consistently outperforms established models for the QM9 and GEOM-Drugs datasets. Significantly, EQGAT-diff takes continuous atom positions, while chemical elements and bond types are categorical and uses time-dependent loss weighting, substantially increasing training convergence, the quality of generated samples, and inference time. We also showcase that including chemically motivated additional features like hybridization states in the diffusion process enhances the validity of generated molecules. To further strengthen the applicability of diffusion models to limited training data, we investigate the transferability of EQGAT-diff trained on the large PubChem3D dataset with implicit hydrogen atoms to target different data distributions. Fine-tuning EQGAT-diff for just a few iterations shows an efficient distribution shift, further improving performance throughout data sets. Finally, we test our model on the Crossdocked data set for structure-based de novo ligand generation, underlining the importance of our findings showing state-of-the-art performance on Vina docking scores. | Tuan Le, Julian Cremer, Frank Noé, DjorkArné Clevert, Kristof T.

This direction of research is particularly relevant to medical imaging because accurate medical image analysis and generation consist of a combination of reasoning based on visual features and prior knowledge. Many recent works have focused on training adapter networks that serve as an information bridge between image processing (encoding or generating) networks and LLMs; but presumably, in order to achieve maximum reasoning potential of LLMs on visual information as well, visual and language features should be allowed to interact more freely. This is especially important in the medical domain because understanding and generating medical images such as chest X-rays (CXR) require not only accurate visual and language-based reasoning but also a more intimate mapping between the two modalities. Thus, taking inspiration from previous work on the transformer and VQ-GAN combination for bidirectional image and text generation, we build upon this approach and develop a method for instruction-tuning an LLM pre-trained only on text to gain vision-language capabilities for medical images. Specifically, we leverage a pretrained LLM’s existing question-answering and instruction-following abilities to teach it to understand visual inputs by instructing it to answer questions about image inputs and, symmetrically, output both text and image responses appropriate to a given query by tuning the LLM with diverse tasks that encompass image-based text-generation and text-based image-generation. We show that our LLM-CXR trained in this approach shows better image-text alignment in both CXR understanding and generation tasks while being smaller in size compared to previously developed models that perform a narrower range of tasks. | Suhyeon Lee, Won Jun Kim, Jinho Chang, Jong Chul Ye |  |
| 959 |  |  [Can We Evaluate Domain Adaptation Models Without Target-Domain Labels?](https://openreview.net/forum?id=fszrlQ2DuP) |  | 0 | Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) involves adapting a model trained on a label-rich source domain to an unlabeled target domain. However, in real-world scenarios, the absence of target-domain labels makes it challenging to evaluate the performance of UDA models. Furthermore, prevailing UDA methods relying on adversarial training and self-training could lead to model degeneration and negative transfer, further exacerbating the evaluation problem. In this paper, we propose a novel metric called the Transfer Score to address these issues. The proposed metric enables the unsupervised evaluation of UDA models by assessing the spatial uniformity of the classifier via model parameters, as well as the transferability and discriminability of deep representations. Based on the metric, we achieve three novel objectives without target-domain labels: (1) selecting the best UDA method from a range of available options, (2) optimizing hyperparameters of UDA models to prevent model degeneration, and (3) identifying which checkpoint of UDA model performs optimally. Our work bridges the gap between data-level UDA research and practical UDA scenarios, enabling a realistic assessment of UDA model performance. We validate the effectiveness of our metric through extensive empirical studies on UDA datasets of different scales and imbalanced distributions. The results demonstrate that our metric robustly achieves the aforementioned goals. | Jianfei Yang, Hanjie Qian, Yuecong Xu, Kai Wang, Lihua Xie |  |

Although non-convex constrained optimization problems have been shown to perform better than convex counterparts in terms of reconstruction quality, convex constrained optimization problems have been preferably for its global optima guarantees. Despite the success of non-convex methods in a large number of applications, it is not an overstatement to say that there is little or no hope for non-convex problems to ensure global optima. In this paper, for the first time, we develop invex constrained optimization theory to mitigate the loss of guarantees for global optima in non-convex constrained inverse problems, where the invex function is a mapping where any critical point is a global minimizer. We also develop relevant theories to extend the global optima guarantee to a set of quasi-invex functions - the largest optimizable mappings. More specifically, we propose a family of invex/quasi-invex of functions for handling constrained inverse problems using the non-convex setting along with guarantees for their global optima. Our experimental evaluation shows that the proposed approach is very promising and can aid in extending existing convex optimization algorithms, such as the alternating direction method of multipliers, and accelerated proximal gradient methods. | Samuel Pinilla, Jeyan Thiyagalingam |  |
| 961 |  |  [DOS: Diverse Outlier Sampling for Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://openreview.net/forum?id=iriEqxFB4y) |  | 0 | Modern neural networks are known to give overconfident predictions for out-of-distribution inputs when deployed in the open world. It is common practice to leverage a surrogate outlier dataset to regularize the model during training, and recent studies emphasize the role of uncertainty in designing the sampling strategy for outlier datasets. However, the OOD samples selected solely based on predictive uncertainty can be biased towards certain types, which may fail to capture the full outlier distribution. In this work, we empirically show that diversity is critical in sampling outliers for OOD detection performance. Motivated by the observation, we propose a straightforward and novel sampling strategy named DOS (Diverse Outlier Sampling) to select diverse and informative outliers. Specifically, we cluster the normalized features at each iteration, and the most informative outlier from each cluster is selected for model training with absent category loss. With DOS, the sampled outliers efficiently shape a globally compact decision boundary between ID and OOD data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DOS, reducing the average FPR95 by up to 25.79% on CIFAR-100 with TI-300K. | Wenyu Jiang, Hao Cheng, Mingcai Chen, Chongjun Wang, Hongxin Wei |  |

Despite the inherent connection between diffusion models and MTL, there remains an unexplored area in designing neural architectures that explicitly incorporate MTL into the framework of diffusion models. In this paper, we present Denoising Task Routing (DTR), a simple add-on strategy for existing diffusion model architectures to establish distinct information pathways for individual tasks within a single architecture by selectively activating subsets of channels in the model. What makes DTR particularly compelling is its seamless integration of prior knowledge of denoising tasks into the framework: (1) Task Affinity: DTR activates similar channels for tasks at adjacent timesteps and shifts activated channels as sliding windows through timesteps, capitalizing on the inherent strong affinity between tasks at adjacent timesteps. (2) Task Weights: During the early stages (higher timesteps) of the denoising process, DTR assigns a greater number of task-specific channels, leveraging the insight that diffusion models prioritize reconstructing global structure and perceptually rich contents in earlier stages, and focus on simple noise removal in later stages. Our experiments reveal that DTR not only consistently boosts diffusion models' performance across different evaluation protocols without adding extra parameters but also accelerates training convergence. Finally, we show the complementarity between our architectural approach and existing MTL optimization techniques, providing a more complete view of MTL in the context of diffusion training. Significantly, by leveraging this complementarity, we attain matched performance of DiT-XL using the smaller DiT-L with a reduction in training iterations from 7M to 2M.

As part of this process, learned reward models are used to approximately model human preferences. However, as imperfect representations of the “true” reward, these learned reward models are susceptible to overoptimization. Gao et al. (2023) studied this phenomenon in a synthetic human feedback setup with a significantly larger “gold” reward model acting as the true reward (instead of humans) and showed that overoptimization remains a persistent problem regardless of the size of the proxy reward model and training data used. Using a similar setup, we conduct a systematic study to evaluate the efficacy of using ensemble-based conservative optimization objectives, specifically worst-case optimization (WCO) and uncertainty-weighted optimization (UWO), for mitigating reward model overoptimization when using two optimization methods: (a) best-of-n sampling (BoN) (b) proximal policy optimization (PPO). We additionally extend the setup of Gao et al. (2023) to include 25% label noise to better mirror real-world conditions. Both with and without label noise we find that conservative optimization practically eliminates overoptimization and improves performance by up to 70% for BoN sampling. For PPO, ensemble-based conservative optimization always reduces overoptimization and outperforms single reward model optimization. Moreover, combining it with a small KL penalty successfully prevents overoptimization at no performance cost. Overall, our results demonstrate that ensemble-based conservative optimization can effectively counter overoptimization. | Thomas Coste, Usman Anwar, Robert Kirk, David Krueger |  |

However, existing LIC methods are redundant in latent representation due to limitations in capturing anisotropic frequency components and preserving directional details. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel frequency-aware transformer (FAT) block that for the first time achieves multiscale directional ananlysis for LIC. The FAT block comprises frequency-decomposition window attention (FDWA) modules to capture multiscale and directional frequency components of natural images. Additionally, we introduce frequency-modulation feed-forward network (FMFFN) to adaptively modulate different frequency components, improving rate-distortion performance. Furthermore, we present a transformer-based channel-wise autoregressive (T-CA) model that effectively exploits channel dependencies. Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance compared to existing LIC methods, and evidently outperforms latest standardized codec VTM-12.1 by 14.5\%, 15.1\%, 13.0\% in BD-rate on the Kodak, Tecnick, and CLIC datasets. | Han Li, Shaohui Li, Wenrui Dai, Chenglin Li, Junni Zou, Hongkai Xiong |  |

Designing a chip relies on human experts to produce chip data through professional electronic design automation (EDA) software and complicated procedures. Nowadays, prompted by the wide variety of machine learning (ML) datasets, we have witnessed great advancement of ML algorithms in computer vision, natural language processing, and other fields. However, in chip design, high human workload and data sensitivity cause the lack of public datasets, which hinders the progress of ML development for EDA. To this end, we introduce an advanced large-scale dataset, CircuitNet 2.0, which targets promoting ML innovations in a realistic chip design environment. In order to approach the realistic chip design space, we collect more than 10,000 samples with a variety of chip designs (e.g., CPU, GPU, and AI Chip). All the designs are conducted through complete commercial design flows in a widely-used technology node, 14nm FinFET. We collect comprehensive data, including routability, timing, and power, from the design flow to support versatile ML tasks in EDA. Besides, we also introduce some realistic ML tasks with CircuitNet 2.0 to verify the potential for boosting innovations. | Xun Jiang, Zhuomin Chai, Yuxiang Zhao, Yibo Lin, Runsheng Wang, Ru Huang |  |

Previous research has demonstrated the ability to generate robots for various tasks, but these approaches often optimize robots directly in the vast design space, resulting in robots with complicated morphologies that are hard to control. In response, this paper presents a novel coarse-to-fine method for designing multi-cellular robots. Initially, this strategy seeks optimal coarse-grained robots and progressively refines them. To mitigate the challenge of determining the precise refinement juncture during the coarse-to-fine transition, we introduce the Hyperbolic Embeddings for Robot Design (HERD) framework. HERD unifies robots of various granularity within a shared hyperbolic space and leverages a refined Cross-Entropy Method for optimization. This framework enables our method to autonomously identify areas of exploration in hyperbolic space and concentrate on regions demonstrating promise. Finally, the extensive empirical studies on various challenging tasks sourced from EvoGym show our approach's superior efficiency and generalization capability. | Heng Dong, Junyu Zhang, Chongjie Zhang |  |

However, they have been less successful in Information Extraction (IE), lagging behind task-specific models. Typically, IE tasks are characterized by complex annotation guidelines which describe the task and give examples to humans. Previous attempts to leverage such information have failed, even with the largest models, as they are not able to follow the guidelines out-of-the-box. In this paper we propose GoLLIE (Guideline-following Large Language Model for IE), a model able to improve zero-shot results on unseen IE tasks by virtue of being fine-tuned to comply with annotation guidelines. Comprehensive evaluation empirically demonstrates that GoLLIE is able to generalize to and follow unseen guidelines, outperforming previous attempts at zero-shot information extraction. The ablation study shows that detailed guidelines is key for good results. Code, data and models will be made publicly available. | Oscar Sainz, Iker GarcíaFerrero, Rodrigo Agerri, Oier Lopez de Lacalle, German Rigau, Eneko Agirre |  |

Even with access only to the model's output, an attacker can employ black-box attacks to generate such adversarial examples. In this work, we propose a simple and lightweight defense against black-box attacks by adding random noise to hidden features at intermediate layers of the model at inference time. Our theoretical analysis confirms that this method effectively enhances the model's resilience against both score-based and decision-based black-box attacks. Importantly, our defense does not necessitate adversarial training and has minimal impact on accuracy, rendering it applicable to any pre-trained model. Our analysis also reveals the significance of selectively adding noise to different parts of the model based on the gradient of the adversarial objective function, which can be varied during the attack. We demonstrate the robustness of our defense against multiple black-box attacks through extensive empirical experiments involving diverse models with various architectures. | Nguyen HungQuang, Yingjie Lao, Tung Pham, KokSeng Wong, Khoa D.

Therefore in this work we propose a hybrid inference approach which combines their respective strengths to save cost and maintain quality. Our approach uses a router that assigns queries to the small or large model based on the predicted query difficulty and the desired quality level. The desired quality level can be tuned dynamically at test time to seamlessly trade quality for cost as per the scenario requirements. In experiments our approach allows us to make up to 40% fewer calls to the large model, with no drop in response quality. | Dujian Ding, Ankur Mallick, Chi Wang, Robert Sim, Subhabrata Mukherjee, Victor Rühle, Laks V.

Despite recent progress in questions of identifiability, more theoretical results demonstrating concrete advantages of these methods for downstream tasks are needed. In this paper, we consider the task of intervention extrapolation: predicting how interventions affect an outcome, even when those interventions are not observed at training time, and show that identifiable representations can provide an effective solution to this task even if the interventions affect the outcome non-linearly. Our setup includes an outcome variable $Y$, observed features $X$, which are generated as a non-linear transformation of latent features $Z$, and exogenous action variables $A$, which influence $Z$. The objective of intervention extrapolation is then to predict how interventions on $A$ that lie outside the training support of $A$ affect $Y$. Here, extrapolation becomes possible if the effect of $A$ on $Z$ is linear and the residual when regressing Z on A has full support. As $Z$ is latent, we combine the task of intervention extrapolation with identifiable representation learning, which we call $\texttt{Rep4Ex}$: we aim to map the observed features $X$ into a subspace that allows for non-linear extrapolation in $A$. We show that the hidden representation is identifiable up to an affine transformation in $Z$-space, which, we prove, is sufficient for intervention extrapolation. The identifiability is characterized by a novel constraint describing the linearity assumption of $A$ on $Z$. Based on this insight, we propose a flexible method that enforces the linear invariance constraint and can be combined with any type of autoencoder. We validate our theoretical findings through a series of synthetic experiments and show that our approach can indeed succeed in predicting the effects of unseen interventions. | Sorawit Saengkyongam, Elan Rosenfeld, Pradeep Kumar Ravikumar, Niklas Pfister, Jonas Peters |  |
| 971 |  |  [Safe Offline Reinforcement Learning with Feasibility-Guided Diffusion Model](https://openreview.net/forum?id=j5JvZCaDM0) |  | 0 | Safe offline reinforcement learning is a promising way to bypass risky online interactions towards safe policy learning. Most existing methods only enforce soft constraints, i.e., constraining safety violations in expectation below thresholds predetermined. This can lead to potentially unsafe outcomes, thus unacceptable in safety-critical scenarios. An alternative is to enforce the hard constraint of zero violation. However, this can be challenging in offline setting, as it needs to strike the right balance among three highly intricate and correlated aspects: safety constraint satisfaction, reward maximization, and behavior regularization imposed by offline datasets. Interestingly, we discover that via reachability analysis of safe-control theory, the hard safety constraint can be equivalently translated to identifying the largest feasible region given the offline dataset. This seamlessly converts the original trilogy problem to a feasibility-dependent objective, i.e., maximizing reward value within the feasible region while minimizing safety risks in the infeasible region. Inspired by these, we propose FISOR (FeasIbility-guided Safe Offline RL), which allows safety constraint adherence, reward maximization, and offline policy learning to be realized via three decoupled processes, while offering strong safety performance and stability. In FISOR, the optimal policy for the translated optimization problem can be derived in a special form of weighted behavior cloning, which can be effectively extracted with a guided diffusion model thanks to its expressiveness. We compare FISOR against baselines on DSRL benchmark for safe offline RL. Evaluation results show that FISOR is the only method that can guarantee safety satisfaction in all tasks, while achieving top returns in most tasks.

With the rise of generative models, especially diffusion models, the ability to generate realistic images close to the real data distribution has been well recognized. These generated high-equality images have been successfully applied to enhance contrastive representation learning, a technique termed \`\`data inflation''. However, we find that the generated data (even from a good diffusion model like DDPM) may sometimes even harm contrastive learning. We investigate the causes behind this failure from the perspective of both data inflation and data augmentation. For the first time, we reveal the complementary roles that stronger data inflation should be accompanied by weaker augmentations, and vice versa. We also provide rigorous theoretical explanations for these phenomena via deriving its generalization bounds under data inflation. Drawing from these insights, we propose \*\*Adaptive Inflation (AdaInf)\*\*, a purely data-centric strategy without introducing any extra computation cost. On benchmark datasets, AdaInf can bring significant improvements for various contrastive learning methods. Notably, without using external data, AdaInf obtains 94.70% linear accuracy on CIFAR-10 with SimCLR, setting a new record that surpasses many sophisticated methods.

While numerous methods have been proposed to increase the encoding capabilities of an INR, an often overlooked aspect is the inference efficiency, usually measured in multiply-accumulate (MAC) count. This is particularly critical in use cases where inference bandwidth is greatly limited by hardware constraints. To this end, we propose the Activation-Sharing Multi-Resolution (ASMR) coordinate network that combines multi-resolution coordinate decomposition with hierarchical modulations. Specifically, an ASMR model enables the sharing of activations across grids of the data. This largely decouples its inference cost from its depth which is directly correlated to its reconstruction capability, and renders a near $O(1)$ inference complexity irrespective of the number of layers. Experiments show that ASMR can reduce the MAC of a vanilla SIREN model by up to 500$\times$ while achieving an even higher reconstruction quality than its SIREN baseline. | Jason Chun Lok Li, Steven Tin Sui Luo, Le Xu, Ngai Wong |  |

Various methods have been devised to address these problems. Recently, weight balancing, which combines well-known classical regularization techniques with two-stage training, has been proposed. Despite its simplicity, it is known for its high performance compared with existing methods devised in various ways. However, there is a lack of understanding as to why this method is effective for long-tailed data. In this study, we analyze weight balancing by focusing on neural collapse and the cone effect at each training stage and found that it can be decomposed into an increase in Fisher's discriminant ratio of the feature extractor caused by weight decay and cross entropy loss and implicit logit adjustment caused by weight decay and class-balanced loss. Our analysis enables the training method to be further simplified by reducing the number of training stages to one while increasing accuracy.

In this work, we introduce a scheduling strategy that, to our knowledge, is the first to successfully achieve zero pipeline bubbles under synchronous training semantics. The key idea behind this improvement is to split the backward computation into two parts, one that computes gradient for the input and another that computes for the parameters. Based on this idea, we handcraft novel pipeline schedules that significantly outperform the baseline methods. We further develop an algorithm that automatically finds an optimal schedule based on specific model configuration and memory limit. Additionally, to truly achieve zero bubble, we introduce a novel technique to bypass synchronizations during the optimizer step. Experimental evaluations show that our method outperforms the 1F1B schedule up to 15\% in throughput under a similar memory limit. This number can be further pushed to 30\% when the memory constraint is relaxed. We believe our results mark a major step forward in harnessing the true potential of pipeline parallelism.

Stress is a widely used metric; stress is minimized when every pair of nodes is positioned at their shortest path distance. However, stress optimization presents computational challenges due to its inherent complexity and is usually solved using heuristics in practice. We introduce a scalable Graph Neural Network (GNN) based Graph Drawing framework with sub-quadratic runtime that can learn to optimize stress. Inspired by classical stress optimization techniques and force-directed layout algorithms, we create a coarsening hierarchy for the input graph. Beginning at the coarsest level, we iteratively refine and un-coarsen the layout, until we generate an embedding for the original graph. To enhance information propagation within the network, we propose a novel positional rewiring technique based on intermediate node positions. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that the framework achieves state-of-the-art performance while remaining scalable. | Florian Grötschla, Joël Mathys, Robert Veres, Roger Wattenhofer |  |

Nevertheless, offline RL inevitably faces the problem of distributional shifts, where the states and actions encountered during policy execution may not be in the training dataset distribution. A common solution involves incorporating conservatism into the policy or the value function to safeguard against uncertainties and unknowns. In this work, we focus on achieving the same objectives of conservatism but from a different perspective. We propose COmpositional COnservatism with Anchor-seeking (COCOA) for offline RL, an approach that pursues conservatism in a _compositional_ manner on top of the transductive reparameterization (Netanyahu et al., 2023), which decomposes the input variable (the state in our case) into an anchor and its difference from the original input. Our COCOA seeks both in-distribution anchors and differences by utilizing the learned reverse dynamics model, encouraging conservatism in the compositional input space for the policy or value function. Such compositional conservatism is independent of and agnostic to the prevalent _behavioral_ conservatism in offline RL. We apply COCOA to four state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms and evaluate them on the D4RL benchmark, where COCOA generally improves the performance of each algorithm.

In offline PbRL, agents are provided with a fixed dataset containing human preferences between pairs of trajectories. Previous studies mainly focus on recovering the rewards from the preferences, followed by policy optimization with an off-the-shelf offline RL algorithm. However, given that preference label in PbRL is inherently trajectory-based, accurately learning transition-wise rewards from such label can be challenging, potentially leading to misguidance during subsequent offline RL training. To address this issue, we introduce our method named $\textit{Flow-to-Better (FTB)}$, which leverages the pairwise preference relationship to guide a generative model in producing preferred trajectories, avoiding Temporal Difference (TD) learning with inaccurate rewards. Conditioning on a low-preference trajectory, $\textit{FTB}$ uses a diffusion model to generate a better one with a higher preference, achieving high-fidelity full-horizon trajectory improvement. During diffusion training, we propose a technique called $\textit{Preference Augmentation}$ to alleviate the problem of insufficient preference data. As a result, we surprisingly find that the model-generated trajectories not only exhibit increased preference and consistency with the real transition but also introduce elements of $\textit{novelty}$ and $\textit{diversity}$, from which we can derive a desirable policy through imitation learning. Experimental results on D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that FTB achieves a remarkable improvement compared to state-of-the-art offline PbRL methods. Furthermore, we show that FTB can also serve as an effective data augmentation method for offline RL. | Zhilong Zhang, Yihao Sun, Junyin Ye, TianShuo Liu, Jiaji Zhang, Yang Yu |  |

They are distinguished by their inherently invertible architecture. However, the requirement of invertibility imposes constraints on their expressiveness, necessitating a large number of parameters and innovative architectural designs to achieve satisfactory outcomes. Whilst flow-based models predominantly rely on neural-network-based transformations for expressive designs, alternative transformation methods have received limited attention. In this work, we present Ferumal flow, a novel kernelised normalising flow paradigm that integrates kernels into the framework. Our results demonstrate that a kernelised flow can yield competitive or superior results compared to neural network-based flows whilst maintaining parameter efficiency. Kernelised flows excel especially in the low-data regime, enabling flexible non-parametric density estimation in applications with sparse data availability. | Eshant English, Matthias Kirchler, Christoph Lippert |  |

However, document-level contrastive learning might capture low-level mutual information, such as word ratio, which disturbs topic modeling. Moreover, there is a potential conflict between the ELBO loss that memorizes input details for better reconstruction quality, and the contrastive loss which attempts to learn topic representations that generalize among input documents. To address these issues, we first introduce a novel contrastive learning method oriented towards sets of topic vectors to capture useful semantics that are shared among a set of input documents. Secondly, we explicitly cast contrastive topic modeling as a gradient-based multi-objective optimization problem, with the goal of achieving a Pareto stationary solution that balances the trade-off between the ELBO and the contrastive objective. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently produces higher-performing neural topic models in terms of topic coherence, topic diversity, and downstream performance. | Thong Thanh Nguyen, Xiaobao Wu, Xinshuai Dong, CongDuy T.

These advancements have been extended to 3D models, enabling the generation of novel 3D objects from textual descriptions. This has evolved into NeRF editing methods, which allow the manipulation of existing 3D objects through textual conditioning. However, existing NeRF editing techniques have faced limitations in their performance due to slow training speeds and the use of loss functions that do not adequately consider editing. To address this, here we present a novel 3D NeRF editing approach dubbed ED-NeRF by successfully embedding real-world scenes into the latent space of the latent diffusion model (LDM) through a unique refinement layer. This approach enables us to obtain a NeRF backbone that is not only faster but also more amenable to editing compared to traditional image space NeRF editing. Furthermore, we propose an improved loss function tailored for editing by migrating the delta denoising score (DDS) distillation loss, originally used in 2D image editing to the three-dimensional domain. This novel loss function surpasses the well-known score distillation sampling (SDS) loss in terms of suitability for editing purposes. Our experimental results demonstrate that ED-NeRF achieves faster editing speed while producing improved output quality compared to state-of-the-art 3D editing models. | Jangho Park, Gihyun Kwon, Jong Chul Ye |  |

However, the application of the existing PFL methods to real-world setting is hindered by the common assumption that the test data on each client is in-distribution (IND) with respect to its training data. Due to the bias of training dataset, the modern machine learning model prefers to rely on shortcut which can perform well on the training data but fail to generalize to the unseen test data that is out-of-distribution (OOD). This pervasive phenomenon is called shortcut learning and has attracted plentiful efforts in centralized situations. In PFL, the limited data diversity on federated clients makes mitigating shortcut and meanwhile preserving personalization knowledge rather difficult. In this paper, we analyse this challenging problem by formulating the structural causal models (SCMs) for heterogeneous federated clients. From the proposed SCMs, we derive two significant causal signatures which inspire a provable shortcut discovery and removal method under federated learning, namely FedSDR. Specifically, FedSDR is divided into two steps: 1) utilizing the available training data distributed among local clients to discover all the shortcut features in a collaborative manner. 2) developing the optimal personalized causally invariant predictor for each client by eliminating the discovered shortcut features. We provide theoretical analysis to prove that our method can draw complete shortcut features and produce the optimal personalized invariant predictor that can generalize to unseen OOD data on each client. The experimental results on diverse datasets validate the superiority of FedSDR over the state-of-the-art PFL methods on OOD generalization performance. | Xueyang Tang, Song Guo, Jie Zhang, Jingcai Guo |  |

This capability is equally crucial for artificial intelligence. In contrast, classical reinforcement learning agents lack such capabilities and often resort to extensive trial and error to explore the environment. This paper introduces $\textbf{PAE}$: $\textbf{P}$lanner-$\textbf{A}$ctor-$\textbf{E}$valuator, a novel framework for teaching agents to $\textit{learn to absorb external knowledge}$. PAE integrates the Planner's knowledge-state alignment mechanism, the Actor's mutual information skill control, and the Evaluator's adaptive intrinsic exploration reward to achieve 1) effective cross-modal information fusion, 2) enhanced linkage between knowledge and state, and 3) hierarchical mastery of complex tasks. Comprehensive experiments across 11 challenging tasks from the BabyAI and MiniHack environment suites demonstrate PAE's superior exploration efficiency with good interpretability. | Zhe Wu, Haofei Lu, Junliang Xing, You Wu, Renye Yan, Yaozhong Gan, Yuanchun Shi |  |

However, owing to the inconsistency in pose between the source and target images, synthesizing an image with a distinct pose, relying exclusively on the source image and target pose information, remains a formidable challenge. This paper presents Progressive Conditional Diffusion Models (PCDMs) that incrementally bridge the gap between person images under the target and source poses through three stages. Specifically, in the first stage, we design a simple prior conditional diffusion model that predicts the global features of the target image by mining the global alignment relationship between pose coordinates and image appearance. Then, the second stage establishes a dense correspondence between the source and target images using the global features from the previous stage, and an inpainting conditional diffusion model is proposed to further align and enhance the contextual features, generating a coarse-grained person image. In the third stage, we propose a refining conditional diffusion model to utilize the coarsely generated image from the previous stage as a condition, achieving texture restoration and enhancing fine-detail consistency. The three-stage PCDMs work progressively to generate the final high-quality and high-fidelity synthesized image. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the consistency and photorealism of our proposed PCDMs under challenging scenarios. The code and model will be available at https://github.com/tencent-ailab/PCDMs. | Fei Shen, Hu Ye, Jun Zhang, Cong Wang, Xiao Han, Yang Wei |  |

However, the theory behind these observations remains poorly understood. We theoretically study transformers with a single layer of linear self-attention, trained on synthetic noisy linear regression data. First, we mathematically show that when the covariates are drawn from a standard Gaussian distribution, the one-layer transformer which minimizes the pre-training loss will implement a single step of GD on the least-squares linear regression objective. Then, we find that changing the distribution of the covariates and weight vector to a non-isotropic Gaussian distribution has a strong impact on the learned algorithm: the global minimizer of the pre-training loss now implements a single step of $\textit{pre-conditioned}$ GD. However, if only the distribution of the responses is changed, then this does not have a large effect on the learned algorithm: even when the response comes from a more general family of $\textit{nonlinear}$ functions, the global minimizer of the pre-training loss still implements a single step of GD on a least-squares linear regression objective. | Arvind V.

However, for practitioners and researchers with large and custom evaluation tasks, GPT-4 is unreliable due to its closed-source nature, uncontrolled versioning, and prohibitive costs. In this work, we propose PROMETHEUS a fully open-source LLM that is on par with GPT-4’s evaluation capabilities when the appropriate reference materials (reference answer, score rubric) are accompanied. For this purpose, we construct a new dataset – FEEDBACK COLLECTION – that consists of 1K fine-grained score rubrics, 20K instructions, and 100K natural language feedback generated by GPT-4. Using the FEEDBACK COLLECTION, we train PROMETHEUS, a 13B evaluation-specific LLM that can assess any given response based on novel and unseen score rubrics and reference materials provided by the user. Our dataset’s versatility and diversity make our model generalize to challenging real-world criteria, such as prioritizing conciseness, child-readability, or varying levels of formality. We show that PROMETHEUS shows a stronger correlation with GPT-4 evaluation compared to ChatGPT on seven evaluation benchmarks (Two Feedback Collection testsets, MT Bench, Vicuna Bench, Flask Eval, MT Bench Human Judgment, and HHH Alignment), showing the efficacy of our model and dataset design. During human evaluation with hand-crafted score rubrics, PROMETHEUS shows a Pearson correlation of 0.897 with human evaluators, which is on par with GPT-4-0613 (0.882), and greatly outperforms ChatGPT (0.392). Remarkably, when assessing the quality of the generated feedback, PROMETHEUS demonstrates a win rate of 58.62% when compared to GPT-4 evaluation and a win rate of 79.57% when compared to ChatGPT evaluation. Our findings suggests that by adding reference materials and training on GPT-4 feedback, we can obtain effective open-source evaluator LMs. | Seungone Kim, Jamin Shin, Yejin Choi, Joel Jang, Shayne Longpre, Hwaran Lee, Sangdoo Yun, Seongjin Shin, Sungdong Kim, James Thorne, Minjoon Seo |  |

A crucial selection strategy leverages the model's predictive uncertainty, reflecting the informativeness of a data point. While the sample's distance to the decision boundary intuitively measures predictive uncertainty, its computation becomes intractable for complex decision boundaries formed in multiclass classification tasks. This paper introduces the \*least disagree metric\* (LDM), the smallest probability of predicted label disagreement. We propose an asymptotically consistent estimator for LDM under mild assumptions. The estimator boasts computational efficiency and straightforward implementation for deep learning models using parameter perturbation. The LDM-based active learning algorithm queries unlabeled data with the smallest LDM, achieving state-of-the-art \*overall\* performance across various datasets and deep architectures, as demonstrated by the experimental results. | Seong Jin Cho, Gwangsu Kim, Junghyun Lee, Jinwoo Shin, Chang D.

However, such prior works show limited performance in discovering and representing the symbolic structure from unseen test data because their decomposition to the structural representations was incomplete. In this work, we propose an Attention-based Iterative Decomposition (AID) module designed to enhance the decomposition operations for the structured representations encoded from the sequential input data with TPR. Our AID can be easily adapted to any TPR-based model and provides enhanced systematic decomposition through a competitive attention mechanism between input features and structured representations. In our experiments, AID shows effectiveness by significantly improving the performance of TPR-based prior works on the series of systematic generalization tasks. Moreover, in the quantitative and qualitative evaluations, AID produces more compositional and well-bound structural representations than other works. | Taewon Park, Inchul Choi, Minho Lee |  |

In this work, we propose a key twist into the finite-sum minimization, dubbed as \*continual finite-sum minimization\*, that asks for a sequence of points $x_1^\star, \ldots, x_n^\star \in D$ such that each ${x}^\star_i \in D$ minimizes the prefix-sum $\sum_{j=1}^if_j(x)/i$. Assuming that each prefix-sum is strongly convex, we develop a first-order continual stochastic variance reduction gradient method ($\mathrm{CSVRG}$) producing an $\epsilon$-optimal sequence with $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n/\epsilon^{1/3} + 1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ overall \*first-order oracles\* (FO). An FO corresponds to the computation of a single gradient $\nabla f_j(x)$ at a given $x \in \mathcal{D}$ for some $j \in [n]$. Our approach significantly improves upon the $\mathcal{O}(n/\epsilon)$ FOs that $\mathrm{StochasticGradientDescent}$ requires and the $\mathcal{O}(n^2 \log (1/\epsilon))$ FOs that state-of-the-art variance reduction methods such as $\mathrm{Katyusha}$ require. We also prove that there is no natural first-order method with $\mathcal{O}\left(n/\epsilon^\alpha\right)$ gradient complexity for $\alpha < 1/4$, establishing that the first-order complexity of our method is nearly tight. | Ioannis Mavrothalassitis, Stratis Skoulakis, Leello Tadesse Dadi, Volkan Cevher |  |

However, these works focus only on the systems that follow deterministic dynamics, such as Newtonian or Hamiltonian. Here, we propose a framework, namely Brownian graph neural networks (BroGNet), combining stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and GNNs to learn Brownian dynamics directly from the trajectory. We modify the architecture of BroGNet to enforce linear momentum conservation of the system, which, in turn, provides superior performance on learning dynamics as revealed empirically. We demonstrate this approach on several systems, namely, linear spring, linear spring with binary particle types, and non-linear spring systems, all following Brownian dynamics at finite temperatures. We show that BroGNet significantly outperforms proposed baselines across all the benchmarked Brownian systems. In addition, we demonstrate zero-shot generalizability of BroGNet to simulate unseen system sizes that are two orders of magnitude larger and to different temperatures than those used during training. Finally, we show that BroGNet conserves the momentum of the system resulting in superior performance and data efficiency. Altogether, our study contributes to advancing the understanding of the intricate dynamics of Brownian motion and demonstrates the effectiveness of graph neural networks in modeling such complex systems. | Suresh Bishnoi, Jayadeva, Sayan Ranu, N.

Contrary to other works that focus on obtaining tighter bounds and developing different practical strategies to enforce certain Lipschitz properties, we aim to thoroughly examine and characterise the Lipschitz behaviour of Neural Networks. Thus, we carry out an empirical investigation in a range of different settings (namely, architectures, datasets, label noise, and more) by exhausting the limits of the simplest and the most general lower and upper bounds. As a highlight of this investigation, we showcase a remarkable fidelity of the lower Lipschitz bound, identify a striking Double Descent trend in both upper and lower bounds to the Lipschitz and explain the intriguing effects of label noise on function smoothness and generalisation. | Grigory Khromov, Sidak Pal Singh |  |

This approach better reflects real-world use cases and addresses some of the shortcomings of alternative LM benchmarks. Negotiation games enable us to study multi-turn, and cross-model interactions, modulate complexity, and side-step accidental evaluation data leakage. We use our approach to test six widely used and publicly accessible LMs, evaluating performance and alignment in both self-play and cross-play settings. Noteworthy findings include: (i) only closed-source models tested here were able to complete these tasks; (ii) cooperative bargaining games proved to be most challenging to the models; and (iii) even the most powerful models sometimes "lose" to weaker opponents. | Tim R.

An important desideratum of RALMs, is that retrieved information helps model performance when it is relevant, and does not harm performance when it is not. This is particularly important in multi-hop reasoning scenarios, where misuse of irrelevant evidence can lead to cascading errors. However, recent work has shown that retrieval augmentation can sometimes have a negative effect on performance. In this work, we present a thorough analysis on five open-domain question answering benchmarks, characterizing cases when retrieval reduces accuracy. We then propose two methods to mitigate this issue. First, a simple baseline that filters out retrieved passages that do not entail question-answer pairs according to a natural language inference (NLI) model. This is effective in preventing performance reduction, but at a cost of also discarding relevant passages. Thus, we propose a method for automatically generating data to fine-tune the language model to properly leverage retrieved passages, using a mix of relevant and irrelevant contexts at training time. We empirically show that even 1,000 examples suffice to train the model to be robust to irrelevant contexts while maintaining high performance on examples with relevant ones. | Ori Yoran, Tomer Wolfson, Ori Ram, Jonathan Berant |  |

To address this, we enhance the spatial-temporal capability and introduce a versatile video generation model, VersVideo, which leverages textual, visual, and stylistic conditions. Current video diffusion models typically extend image diffusion architectures by supplementing 2D operations (such as convolutions and attentions) with temporal operations. While this approach is efficient, it often restricts spatial-temporal performance due to the oversimplification of standard 3D operations. To counter this, we incorporate two key elements: (1) multi-excitation paths for spatial-temporal convolutions with dimension pooling across different axes, and (2) multi-expert spatial-temporal attention blocks. These enhancements boost the model's spatial-temporal performance without significantly escalating training and inference costs. We also tackle the issue of information loss that arises when a variational autoencoder is used to transform pixel space into latent features and then back into pixel frames. To mitigate this, we incorporate temporal modules into the decoder to maintain inter-frame consistency. Lastly, by utilizing the innovative denoising UNet and decoder, we develop a unified ControlNet model suitable for various conditions, including image, Canny, HED, depth, and style. Examples of the videos generated by our model can be found at https://jinxixiang.github.io/versvideo/. | Jinxi Xiang, Ricong Huang, Jun Zhang, Guanbin Li, Xiao Han, Yang Wei |  |

With the increasing emphasis on data privacy, several approaches to machine unlearning have emerged. However, these methods typically rely on complete supervision throughout the unlearning process. Unfortunately, obtaining such supervision, whether for the forgetting or remaining data, can be impractical due to the substantial cost associated with annotating real-world datasets. This challenge prompts us to propose a supervision-free unlearning approach that operates without the need for labels during the unlearning process. Specifically, we introduce a variational approach to approximate the distribution of representations for the remaining data. Leveraging this approximation, we adapt the original model to eliminate information from the forgotten data at the representation level. To further address the issue of lacking supervision information, which hinders alignment with ground truth, we introduce a contrastive loss to facilitate the matching of representations between the remaining data and those of the original model, thus preserving predictive performance. Experimental results across various unlearning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, Label-Agnostic Forgetting (LAF) without using any labels, which achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods that rely on full supervision information. Furthermore, our approach excels in semi-supervised scenarios, leveraging limited supervision information to outperform fully supervised baselines. This work not only showcases the viability of supervision-free unlearning in deep models but also opens up a new possibility for future research in unlearning at the representation level. | Shaofei Shen, Chenhao Zhang, Yawen Zhao, Alina Bialkowski, Weitong Chen, Miao Xu |  |

However, when it comes to low-level vision such as image restoration their performance deteriorates dramatically due to corrupted inputs. In this paper, we present a degradation-aware vision-language model (DA-CLIP) to better transfer pretrained vision-language models to low-level vision tasks as a multi-task framework for image restoration. More specifically, DA-CLIP trains an additional controller that adapts the fixed CLIP image encoder to predict high-quality feature embeddings. By integrating the embedding into an image restoration network via cross-attention, we are able to pilot the model to learn a high-fidelity image reconstruction. The controller itself will also output a degradation feature that matches the real corruptions of the input, yielding a natural classifier for different degradation types. In addition, we construct a mixed degradation dataset with synthetic captions for DA-CLIP training. Our approach advances state-of-the-art performance on both degradation-specific and unified image restoration tasks, showing a promising direction of prompting image restoration with large-scale pretrained vision-language models.

Given the abundance of available data from electronic health records, the intensive care unit (ICU) is a natural habitat for ML. Models have been proposed to address numerous ICU prediction tasks like the early detection of complications. While authors frequently report state-of-the-art performance, it is challenging to verify claims of superiority. Datasets and code are not always published, and cohort definitions, preprocessing pipelines, and training setups are difficult to reproduce. This work introduces Yet Another ICU Benchmark (YAIB), a modular framework that allows researchers to define reproducible and comparable clinical ML experiments; we offer an end-to-end solution from cohort definition to model evaluation. The framework natively supports most open-access ICU datasets (MIMIC III/IV, eICU, HiRID, AUMCdb) and is easily adaptable to future ICU datasets. Combined with a transparent preprocessing pipeline and extensible training code for multiple ML and deep learning models, YAIB enables unified model development, transfer, and evaluation. Our benchmark comes with five predefined established prediction tasks (mortality, acute kidney injury, sepsis, kidney function, and length of stay) developed in collaboration with clinicians. Adding further tasks is straightforward by design. Using YAIB, we demonstrate that the choice of dataset, cohort definition, and preprocessing have a major impact on the prediction performance — often more so than model class — indicating an urgent need for YAIB as a holistic benchmarking tool. We provide our work to the clinical ML community to accelerate method development and enable real-world clinical implementations. | Robin Van De Water, Hendrik Schmidt, Paul W. G.

Still, their training efficiency can be improved by exploiting structure within the optimization problem. Recent work indicates that supervised learning can be accelerated by leveraging the fact that gradients lie in a low-dimensional and slowly-changing subspace. In this paper, we conduct a thorough evaluation of this phenomenon for two popular deep policy gradient methods on various simulated benchmark tasks. Our results demonstrate the existence of such gradient subspaces despite the continuously changing data distribution inherent to reinforcement learning.

However, when it comes to node classification, training GTs remains challenging, especially in semi-supervised settings with a severe scarcity of labeled data. Our paper aims to address this research gap by focusing on semi-supervised node classification. To accomplish this, we develop a curriculum-enhanced attention distillation method that involves utilizing a Local GT teacher and a Global GT student. Additionally, we introduce the concepts of in-class and out-of-class and then propose two improvements, out-of-class entropy and top-k pruning, to facilitate the student's out-of-class exploration under the teacher's in-class guidance. Taking inspiration from human learning, our method involves a curriculum mechanism for distillation that initially provides strict guidance to the student and gradually allows for more out-of-class exploration by a dynamic balance. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms many state-of-the-art approaches on seven public graph benchmarks, proving its effectiveness. | Yisong Huang, Jin Li, Xinlong Chen, YangGeng Fu |  |

In this paper, we study the black-box multi-objective optimization problem, where we aim to optimize multiple potentially conflicting objectives with function queries only. To address this challenging problem and find a Pareto optimal solution or the Pareto stationary solution, we propose a novel adaptive stochastic gradient algorithm for black-box MOO, called ASMG. Specifically, we use the stochastic gradient approximation method to obtain the gradient for the distribution parameters of the Gaussian smoothed MOO with function queries only. Subsequently, an adaptive weight is employed to aggregate all stochastic gradients to optimize all objective functions effectively. Theoretically, we explicitly provide the connection between the original MOO problem and the corresponding Gaussian smoothed MOO problem and prove the convergence rate for the proposed ASMG algorithm in both convex and non-convex scenarios. Empirically, the proposed ASMG method achieves competitive performance on multiple numerical benchmark problems. Additionally, the state-of-the-art performance on the black-box multi-task learning problem demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed ASMG method. | Feiyang Ye, Yueming Lyu, Xuehao Wang, Yu Zhang, Ivor W.

Thus, there is an urgent need to quantitatively evaluate LLMs as agents on challenging tasks in interactive environments. We present AgentBench, a multi-dimensional benchmark that consists of 8 distinct environments to assess LLM-as-Agent's reasoning and decision-making abilities. Our extensive test over 29 API-based and open-sourced (OSS) LLMs shows that, while top commercial LLMs present a strong ability of acting as agents in complex environments, there is a significant disparity in performance between them and many OSS competitors that are no larger than 70B. We identify the typical reasons of failures in environments and LLMs, showing that poor long-term reasoning, decision-making, and instruction following abilities are the main obstacles for developing usable LLM agents. Improving instruction following and training on high quality multi-round alignment data could improve agent performance. And different from existing assumptions, training on code present ambivalent impacts on different agent tasks.

Though many prior techniques have yielded considerable improvements in this research direction, two crucial obstacles still remain. Firstly, a unified perspective has yet to be presented to view the developed arts with individual designs, which is vital for providing insights into future work. Secondly, we expect sufficient natural OOD supervision to promote the generation of compact boundaries between the in-distribution (ID) and OOD data without collecting explicit OOD samples. To tackle these issues, we propose a general probabilistic framework to interpret many existing methods and an OOD-data-free model, namely $\textbf{S}$elf-supervised $\textbf{S}$ampling for $\textbf{O}$OD $\textbf{D}$etection (SSOD). SSOD efficiently exploits natural OOD signals from the ID data based on the local property of convolution. With these supervisions, it jointly optimizes the OOD detection and conventional ID classification in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments reveal that SSOD establishes competitive state-of-the-art performance on many large-scale benchmarks, outperforming the best previous method by a large margin, e.g., reporting $\textbf{-6.28}$% FPR95 and $\textbf{+0.77}$% AUROC on ImageNet, $\textbf{-19.01}$% FPR95 and $\textbf{+3.04}$% AUROC on CIFAR-10, and top-ranked performance on hard OOD datasets, i.e., ImageNet-O and OpenImage-O. | Sen Pei |  |

In contrast to current practices that train customized models for this task, we aim to generate DP Synthetic Data via APIs (DPSDA), where we treat foundation models as blackboxes and only utilize their inference APIs. Such API-based, training-free approaches are easier to deploy as exemplified by the recent surge in the number of API-based apps. These approaches can also leverage the power of large foundation models which are only accessible via their inference APIs. However, this comes with greater challenges due to strictly more restrictive model access and the need to protect privacy from the API provider. In this paper, we present a new framework called Private Evolution (PE) to solve this problem and show its initial promise on synthetic images. Surprisingly, PE can match or even outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods without any model training. For example, on CIFAR10 (with ImageNet as the public data), we achieve FID ≤ 7.9 with privacy cost ε = 0.67, significantly improving the previous SOTA from ε = 32. We further demonstrate the promise of applying PE on large foundation models such as Stable Diffusion to tackle challenging private datasets with a small number of high-resolution images.

However, this approach tends to overlook the inherent differences among rainy images, leading to suboptimal results. To overcome this limitation, we focus on addressing various rainy images by delving into meaningful representations that encapsulate both the rain and background components. Leveraging these representations as instructive guidance, we put forth a Context-based Instance-level Modulation (CoI-M) mechanism adept at efficiently modulating CNN- or Transformer-based models. Furthermore, we devise a rain-/detail-aware contrastive learning strategy to help extract joint rain-/detail-aware representations. By integrating CoI-M with the rain-/detail-aware Contrastive learning, we develop [CoIC](https://github.com/Schizophreni/CoIC), an innovative and potent algorithm tailored for training models on mixed datasets. Moreover, CoIC offers insight into modeling relationships of datasets, quantitatively assessing the impact of rain and details on restoration, and unveiling distinct behaviors of models given diverse inputs. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of CoIC in boosting the deraining ability of CNN and Transformer models. CoIC also enhances the deraining prowess remarkably when real-world dataset is included. | Wu Ran, Peirong Ma, Zhiquan He, Hao Ren, Hong Lu |  |

One example is the convergence of random deep networks to Gaussian processes that enables a rigorous analysis of the way the choice of activation function and network weights impacts the training dynamics. In this paper, we extend the seminal proof of Matthews et al., 2018 to a larger class of initial weight distributions (which we call pseudo-iid), including the established cases of iid and orthogonal weights, as well as the emerging low-rank and structured sparse settings celebrated for their computational speed-up benefits. We show that fully-connected and convolutional networks initialised with pseudo-iid distributions are all effectively equivalent up to their variance. Using our results, one can identify the Edge of Chaos for a broader class of neural networks and tune them at criticality in order to enhance their training. Moreover, they enable the posterior distribution of Bayesian Neural Networks to be tractable across these various initialization schemes. | Thiziri Nait Saada, Alireza Naderi, Jared Tanner |  |

This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of a one-layer Transformer model trained to perform n-digit integer addition. Our findings suggests that the model dissects the task into parallel streams dedicated to individual digits, employing varied algorithms tailored to different positions within the digits. Furthermore, we identify a rare scenario characterized by high loss, which we explain. By thoroughly elucidating the model’s algorithm, we provide new insights into its functioning. These findings are validated through rigorous testing and mathematical modeling, thereby contributing to the broader fields of model understanding and interpretability. Our approach opens the door for analyzing more complex tasks and multi-layer Transformer models. | Philip Quirke, Fazl Barez |  |

Specifically, in the presence of multiple equilibria do self-interested learning dynamics typically select the socially optimal ones? We study a rich class of continuous-time no-regret dynamics in potential games (PGs). Our class of dynamics, \*Q-Replicator Dynamics\* (QRD), include gradient descent (GD), log-barrier and replicator dynamics (RD) as special cases. We start by establishing \*pointwise convergence\* of all QRD to Nash equilibria in almost all PGs. In the case of GD, we show a tight average case performance within a factor of two of optimal, for a class of symmetric $2\times2$ potential games with unbounded Price of Anarchy (PoA). Despite this positive result, we show that GD is not always the optimal choice even in this restricted setting. Specifically, GD outperforms RD, if and only if \*risk-\* and \*payoff-dominance\* equilibria coincide. Finally, we experimentally show how these insights extend to all QRD dynamics and that unbounded gaps between average case performance and PoA analysis are common even in larger settings. | Iosif Sakos, Stefanos Leonardos, Stelios Andrew Stavroulakis, Will Overman, Ioannis Panageas, Georgios Piliouras |  |

Historically, popular approaches included selecting smaller architectures and creating sparse networks through pruning. More recently, randomized parameter-sharing (RPS) methods have gained traction for model compression at start of training. In this paper, we comprehensively assess the trade-off between memory and accuracy across RPS, pruning techniques, and building smaller models. Our findings demonstrate that RPS, which is both data and model-agnostic, consistently outperforms smaller models and all moderately informed pruning strategies, such as MAG, SNIP, SYNFLOW, and GRASP, across the entire compression range. This advantage becomes particularly pronounced in higher compression scenarios. Notably, even when compared to highly informed pruning techniques like Lottery Ticket Rewinding (LTR), RPS exhibits superior performance in high compression settings. This points out inherent capacity advantage that RPS enjoys over sparse models. Theoretically, we establish RPS as a superior technique in terms of memory-efficient representation when compared to pruning for linear models. This paper argues in favor of paradigm shift towards RPS based models. During our rigorous evaluation of RPS, we identified issues in the state- of-the-art RPS technique ROAST, specifically regarding stability (ROAST’s sensitivity to initialization hyperparameters, often leading to divergence) and Pareto-continuity (ROAST’s inability to recover the accuracy of the original model at zero compression). We provably address both of these issues. We refer to the modified RPS, which incorporates our improvements, as STABLE-RPS | Aditya Desai, Anshumali Shrivastava |  |

To surmount this dilemma, massive deep long-tailed learning studies have been proposed to achieve inter-class fairness models by designing sophisticated sampling strategies or improving existing model structures and loss functions. Habitually, these studies tend to apply data augmentation strategies to improve the generalization performance of their models. However, this augmentation strategy applied to balanced distributions may not be the best option for long-tailed distributions. For a profound understanding of data augmentation, we first theoretically analyze the gains of traditional augmentation strategies in long-tailed learning, and observe that augmentation methods cause the long-tailed distribution to be imbalanced again, resulting in an intertwined imbalance: inherent data-wise imbalance and extrinsic augmentation-wise imbalance, i.e., two 'birds' co-exist in long-tailed learning. Motivated by this observation, we propose an adaptive Dynamic Optional Data Augmentation (DODA) to address this intertwined imbalance, i.e., one 'stone' simultaneously 'kills' two 'birds', which allows each class to choose appropriate augmentation methods by maintaining a corresponding augmentation probability distribution for each class during training. Extensive experiments across mainstream long-tailed recognition benchmarks (e.g., CIFAR-100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist 2018) prove the effectiveness and flexibility of the DODA in overcoming the intertwined imbalance. | Binwu Wang, Pengkun Wang, Wei Xu, Xu Wang, Yudong Zhang, Kun Wang, Yang Wang |  |

However, these approaches are either bounded by the policy planning capability of the frozen LLMs or hard to be transferred to new cases. In this work, we introduce a new dialogue policy planning paradigm to strategize LLMs for proactive dialogue problems with a tunable language model plug-in as a plug-and-play dialogue policy planner, named PPDPP. Specifically, we develop a novel training framework to facilitate supervised fine-tuning over available human-annotated data as well as reinforcement learning from goal-oriented AI feedback with dynamic interaction data collected by the LLM-based self-play simulation. In this manner, the LLM-powered dialogue agent can not only be generalized to different cases after the training, but also be applicable to different applications by just substituting the learned plug-in. In addition, we propose to evaluate the policy planning capability of dialogue systems under the interactive setting. Experimental results demonstrate that PPDPP consistently and substantially outperforms existing approaches on three different proactive dialogue applications, including negotiation, emotional support, and tutoring dialogues. | Yang Deng, Wenxuan Zhang, Wai Lam, SeeKiong Ng, TatSeng Chua |  |

The prediction is based solely on the obtained query answers, which also serve as a faithful explanation for the prediction. Applying the framework to any task requires (i) specification of a query set, and (ii) densely annotated data with query answers to train classifiers to answer queries at test time. This limits V-IP's application to small-scale tasks where manual data annotation is feasible. In this work, we focus on image classification tasks and propose to relieve this bottleneck by leveraging pretrained language and vision models. Specifically, following recent work, we propose to use GPT, a Large Language Model, to propose semantic concepts as queries for a given classification task. To answer these queries, we propose a light-weight Concept Question-Answering network (Concept-QA) which learns to answer binary queries about semantic concepts in images. We design pseudo-labels to train our Concept-QA model using GPT and CLIP (a Vision-Language Model). Empirically, we find our Concept-QA model to be competitive with state-of-the-art VQA models in terms of answering accuracy but with an order of magnitude fewer parameters. This allows for seamless integration of Concept-QA into the V-IP framework as a fast-answering mechanism. We name this method Concept-QA+V-IP. Finally, we show on several datasets that Concept-QA+V-IP produces shorter, interpretable query chains which are more accurate than V-IP trained with CLIP-based answering systems.

In this work, we investigate the use of neural networks for such online regression and associated Neural Contextual Bandits (NeuCBs). Using existing results for wide networks, one can readily show a ${\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret for online regression with square loss, which via the reduction implies a ${\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{K} T^{3/4})$ regret for NeuCBs. Departing from this standard approach, we first show a $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ regret for online regression with almost convex losses that satisfy QG (Quadratic Growth) condition, a generalization of the PL (Polyak-\L ojasiewicz) condition, and that have a unique minima. Although not directly applicable to wide networks since they do not have unique minima, we show that adding a suitable small random perturbation to the network predictions surprisingly makes the loss satisfy QG with unique minima. Based on such a perturbed prediction, we show a ${\mathcal{O}}(\log T)$ regret for online regression with both squared loss and KL loss, and subsequently convert these respectively to $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{KT})$ and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{KL^\*} + K)$ regret for NeuCB, where $L^\*$ is the loss of the best policy. Separately, we also show that existing regret bounds for NeuCBs are $\Omega(T)$ or assume i.i.d. contexts, unlike this work. Finally, our experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that our algorithms, especially the one based on KL loss, persistently outperform existing algorithms. | Rohan Deb, Yikun Ban, Shiliang Zuo, Jingrui He, Arindam Banerjee |  |

This paper investigates the efficacy of these “LLM evaluators”, particularly in using them to assess instruction following, a metric that gauges how closely generated text adheres to the given instruction. We introduce a challenging meta-evaluation benchmark, LLMBar, designed to test the ability of an LLM evaluator in discerning instruction-following outputs. The authors manually curated 419 pairs of outputs, one adhering to instructions while the other diverging, yet may possess deceptive qualities that mislead an LLM evaluator, e.g., a more engaging tone. Contrary to existing meta-evaluation, we discover that different evaluators (i.e., combinations of LLMs and prompts) exhibit distinct performance on LLMBar and even the highest-scoring ones have substantial room for improvement. We also present a novel suite of prompting strategies that further close the gap between LLM and human evaluators. With LLMBar, we hope to offer more insight into LLM evaluators and foster future research in developing better instruction-following models. | Zhiyuan Zeng, Jiatong Yu, Tianyu Gao, Yu Meng, Tanya Goyal, Danqi Chen |  |

When the two methods perform the same, SGD is preferable because it uses less memory (12 bytes/parameter with momentum and 8 bytes/parameter without) than AdamW (16 bytes/parameter). However, on a suite of downstream tasks, especially those with distribution shifts, we find that fine-tuning with AdamW performs substantially better than SGD on modern Vision Transformer and ConvNeXt models. We find that large gaps in performance between SGD and AdamW occur when the fine-tuning gradients in the first "embedding" layer are much larger than in the rest of the model. Our analysis suggests an easy fix that works consistently across datasets and models: freezing the embedding layer (less than 1% of the parameters) leads to SGD with or without momentum performing slightly better than AdamW while using less memory (e.g., on ViT-L, SGD uses 33% less GPU memory). Our insights result in state-of-the-art accuracies on five popular distribution shift benchmarks: WILDS-FMoW, WILDS-Camelyon, BREEDS-Living-17, Waterbirds, and DomainNet. | Ananya Kumar, Ruoqi Shen, Sébastien Bubeck, Suriya Gunasekar |  |

However, recent works have revealed the vulnerability of CL to backdoor attacks: the feature extractor could be misled to embed backdoored data close to an attack target class, thus fooling the downstream predictor to misclassify it as the target. Existing attacks usually adopt a fixed trigger pattern and poison the training set with trigger-injected data, hoping for the feature extractor to learn the association between trigger and target class. However, we find that such fixed trigger design fails to effectively associate trigger-injected data with target class in the embedding space due to special CL mechanisms, leading to a limited attack success rate (ASR). This phenomenon motivates us to find a better backdoor trigger design tailored for CL framework. In this paper, we propose a bi-level optimization approach to achieve this goal, where the inner optimization simulates the CL dynamics of a surrogate victim, and the outer optimization enforces the backdoor trigger to stay close to the target throughout the surrogate CL procedure. Extensive experiments show that our attack can achieve a higher attack success rate (e.g., 99\% ASR on ImageNet-100) with a very low poisoning rate (1\%). Besides, our attack can effectively evade existing state-of-the-art defenses. | Weiyu Sun, Xinyu Zhang, Hao Lu, YingCong Chen, Ting Wang, Jinghui Chen, Lu Lin |  |
| 1016 |  |  [PARL: A Unified Framework for Policy Alignment in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByR3NdDSZB) |  | 0 | We present a novel unified bilevel optimization-based framework, \textsf{PARL}, formulated to address the recently highlighted critical issue of policy alignment in reinforcement learning using utility or preference-based feedback. We identify a major gap within current algorithmic designs for solving policy alignment due to a lack of precise characterization of the dependence of the alignment objective on the data generated by policy trajectories. This shortfall contributes to the sub-optimal performance observed in contemporary algorithms. Our framework addressed these concerns by explicitly parameterizing the distribution of the upper alignment objective (reward design) by the lower optimal variable (optimal policy for the designed reward). Interestingly, from an optimization perspective, our formulation leads to a new class of stochastic bilevel problems where the stochasticity at the upper objective depends upon the lower-level variable. {True to our best knowledge, this work presents the first formulation of the RLHF as a bilevel optimization problem which generalizes the existing RLHF formulations and addresses the existing distribution shift issues in RLHF formulations.} To demonstrate the efficacy of our formulation in resolving alignment issues in RL, we devised an algorithm named \textsf{A-PARL} to solve PARL problem, establishing sample complexity bounds of order $\mathcal{O}(1/T)$. Our empirical results substantiate that the proposed \textsf{PARL} can address the alignment concerns in RL by showing significant improvements (up to 63\% in terms of required samples) for policy alignment in large-scale environments of the Deepmind control suite and Meta world tasks. | Souradip Chakraborty, Amrit Singh Bedi, Alec Koppel, Huazheng Wang, Dinesh Manocha, Mengdi Wang, Furong Huang |  |

Existing Safe Reinforcement Learning (SafeRL) methods, which rely on cost functions to enforce safety, often fail to achieve zero-cost performance in complex scenarios, especially vision-only tasks. These limitations are primarily due to model inaccuracies and inadequate sample efficiency. The integration of the world model has proven effective in mitigating these shortcomings. In this work, we introduce SafeDreamer, a novel algorithm incorporating Lagrangian-based methods into world model planning processes within the superior Dreamer framework. Our method achieves nearly zero-cost performance on various tasks, spanning low-dimensional and vision-only input, within the Safety-Gymnasium benchmark, showcasing its efficacy in balancing performance and safety in RL tasks.

Recent studies suggest that the OOD problems in FSC mainly including: (a) cross-domain few-shot classification (CD-FSC) and (b) spurious-correlation few-shot classification (SC-FSC). Specifically, CD-FSC occurs when a classifier learns transferring knowledge from base classes drawn from \underline{seen} training distributions but recognizes novel classes sampled from unseen testing distributions. In contrast, SC-FSC arises when a classifier relies on non-causal features (or contexts) that happen to be correlated with the labels (or concepts) in base classes but such relationships no longer hold during the model deployment. Despite CD-FSC has been extensively studied, SC-FSC remains understudied due to lack of the corresponding evaluation benchmarks. To this end, we present Meta Concept Context (MetaCoCo), a benchmark with spurious-correlation shifts collected from real-world scenarios. Moreover, to quantify the extent of spurious-correlation shifts of the presented MetaCoCo, we further propose a metric by using CLIP as a pre-trained vision-language model. Extensive experiments on the proposed benchmark are performed to evaluate the state-of-the-art methods in FSC, cross-domain shifts, and self-supervised learning. The experimental results show that the performance of the existing methods degrades significantly in the presence of spurious-correlation shifts. We open-source all codes of our benchmark and hope that the proposed MetaCoCo can facilitate future research on spurious-correlation shifts problems in FSC. | Min Zhang, Haoxuan Li, Fei Wu, Kun Kuang |  |

In this paper, we extend Whittle index to a new multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) setting with multiple discrete actions and a possibly changing constraint on the state space, resulting in WIMS (Whittle Index with Multiple actions and State constraint). This setting is common for inventory management where each agent chooses a replenishing quantity level for the corresponding stock-keeping-unit (SKU) such that the total profit is maximized while the total inventory does not exceed a certain limit. Accordingly, we propose a deep MARL algorithm based on WIMS for inventory management. Empirically, our algorithm is evaluated on real large-scale inventory management problems with up to 2307 SKUs and outperforms operation-research-based methods and baseline MARL algorithms. | Chuheng Zhang, Xiangsen Wang, Wei Jiang, Xianliang Yang, Siwei Wang, Lei Song, Jiang Bian |  |

(2022). However, the absence of an inherent iterative structure in the transformer architecture presents a challenge in emulating the iterative algorithms, which are commonly employed in traditional machine learning methods. To address this, we propose the utilization of looped transformer architecture and its associated training methodology, with the aim of incorporating iterative characteristics into the transformer architectures. Experimental results suggest that the looped transformer achieves performance comparable to the standard transformer in solving various data-fitting problems, while utilizing less than 10% of the parameter count. | Liu Yang, Kangwook Lee, Robert D.

However, many recent generative (probabilistic) models utilize neural networks to learn a probability distribution over undirected cyclic graphs. This assumption of a generic graph structure brings various computational challenges, and, more importantly, the presence of non-linearities in neural networks does not permit tractable probabilistic inference. We address these problems by proposing sum-product-set networks, an extension of probabilistic circuits from unstructured tensor data to tree-structured graph data. To this end, we use random finite sets to reflect a variable number of nodes and edges in the graph and to allow for exact and efficient inference. We demonstrate that our tractable model performs comparably to various intractable models based on neural networks. | Milan Papez, Martin Rektoris, Václav Smídl, Tomás Pevný |  |

This problem has broad applications in practical scenarios, e.g., reserve price optimization in online auctions, online task assignments in crowdsourcing, setting recruiting bars in hiring, etc. We first characterize the query complexity of learning a threshold with the expected reward at most $\epsilon$ smaller than the optimum and prove that the number of queries needed can be infinitely large even when $g(\gamma, v)$ is monotone with respect to both $\gamma$ and $v$. On the positive side, we provide a tight query complexity $\tilde{\Theta}(1/\epsilon^3)$ when $g$ is monotone and the CDF of value distribution is Lipschitz. Moreover, we show a tight $\tilde{\Theta}(1/\epsilon^3)$ query complexity can be achieved as long as $g$ satisfies one-sided Lipschitzness, which provides a complete characterization for this problem. Finally, we extend this model to an online learning setting and demonstrate a tight $\Theta(T^{2/3})$ regret bound using continuous-arm bandit techniques and the aforementioned query complexity results. | Jiahao Zhang, Tao Lin, Weiqiang Zheng, Zhe Feng, Yifeng Teng, Xiaotie Deng |  |

Exploring the Relationship Between Model Architecture and In-Context Learning Ability](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Qwq4cpLtoX) |  | 0 | What is the relationship between model architecture and the ability to perform in-context learning? In this empirical study, we take the first steps toward answering this question. We evaluate thirteen model architectures capable of causal language modeling across a suite of synthetic in-context learning tasks. These selected architectures represent a broad range of paradigms, including recurrent and convolution-based neural networks, transformers, state space model inspired, and other emerging attention alternatives. We discover that all the considered architectures can perform in-context learning under a wider range of conditions than previously documented. Additionally, we observe stark differences in statistical efficiency and consistency by varying the number of in-context examples and task difficulty. We also measure each architecture's predisposition towards in-context learning when presented with the option to memorize rather than leverage in-context examples. Finally, and somewhat surprisingly, we find that several attention alternatives are sometimes competitive with or better in-context learners than transformers. However, no single architecture demonstrates consistency across all tasks, with performance either plateauing or declining when confronted with a significantly larger number of in-context examples than those encountered during gradient-based training. | Ivan Lee, Nan Jiang, Taylor BergKirkpatrick |  |

This is primarily due to the interpretation of the softmax function as an approximation of the hardmax function. By clarifying the connection between the softmax function and the Boltzmann operator, we prove that a single layer of self-attention with low-rank weight matrices possesses the capability to perfectly capture the context of an entire input sequence. As a consequence, we show that one-layer and single-head Transformers have a memorization capacity for finite samples, and that Transformers consisting of one self-attention layer with two feed-forward neural networks are universal approximators for continuous functions on a compact domain. | Tokio Kajitsuka, Issei Sato |  |

A data-centric solution to this problem is oversampling - where the classes are balanced by adding synthetic minority samples via generative methods. However, although tabular generative models are capable of generating synthetic samples under a balanced distribution, their integrity suffers when the number of minority samples is low. To this end, pre-trained generative language models with rich prior knowledge are a fitting candidate for the task at hand. Nevertheless, an oversampling strategy tailored for tabular data that utilizes the extensive capabilities of such language models is yet to emerge. In this paper, we propose a novel oversampling framework for tabular data to channel the abilities of generative language models. By leveraging its conditional sampling capabilities, we synthesize minority samples by progressively masking the important features of the majority class samples and imputing them towards the minority distribution. To reduce the inclusion of imperfectly converted samples, we utilize the power of the language model itself to self-authenticate the labels of the samples generated by itself, sifting out ill-converted samples. Extensive experiments on a variety of datasets and imbalance ratios reveal that the proposed method successfully generates reliable minority samples to boost the performance of machine learning classifiers, even under heavy imbalance ratios. | June Yong Yang, Geondo Park, Joowon Kim, Hyeongwon Jang, Eunho Yang |  |

It has garnered considerable attention as the next-generation neural network, as the spiking activity simplifies the computation burden of the network to a large extent and is known for its low energy deployment enabled by specialized neuromorphic hardware. One popular technique to feed a static image to such a network is rate encoding, where each pixel is encoded into random binary spikes, following a Bernoulli distribution that uses the pixel intensity as bias. By establishing a novel connection between rate-encoding and randomized smoothing, we give the first provable robustness guarantee for spiking neural networks against adversarial perturbation of inputs bounded under $l_1$-norm. We introduce novel adversarial training algorithms for rate-encoded models that significantly improve the state-of-the-art empirical robust accuracy result. Experimental validation of the method is performed across various static image datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-100.

Addressing this, existing methods often regard data heterogeneity as an inherent property and propose to mitigate its adverse effects by correcting models. In this paper, we seek to break this inherent property by generating data to complement the original dataset to fundamentally mitigate heterogeneity level. As a novel attempt from the perspective of data, we propose federated learning with consensus-oriented generation (FedCOG). FedCOG consists of two key components at the client side: complementary data generation, which generates data extracted from the shared global model to complement the original dataset, and knowledge-distillation-based model training, which distills knowledge from global model to local model based on the generated data to mitigate over-fitting the original heterogeneous dataset. FedCOG has two critical advantages: 1) it can be a plug-and-play module to further improve the performance of most existing FL methods, and 2) it is naturally compatible with standard FL protocols such as Secure Aggregation since it makes no modification in communication process. Extensive experiments on classical and real-world FL datasets show that FedCOG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Nevertheless, existing AI-generated videos are usually very short clips ("shot-level'') depicting a single scene. To deliver a coherent long video ("story-level''), it is desirable to have creative transition and prediction effects across different clips. This paper presents a short-to-long video diffusion model, SEINE, that focuses on generative transition and prediction. The goal is to generate high-quality long videos with smooth and creative transitions between scenes and varying lengths of shot-level videos. Specifically, we propose a random-mask video diffusion model to automatically generate transitions based on textual descriptions. By providing the images of different scenes as inputs, combined with text-based control, our model generates transition videos that ensure coherence and visual quality. Furthermore, the model can be readily extended to various tasks such as image-to-video animation and autoregressive video prediction. To conduct a comprehensive evaluation of this new generative task, we propose three assessing criteria for smooth and creative transition: temporal consistency, semantic similarity, and video-text semantic alignment. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach over existing methods for generative transition and prediction, enabling the creation of story-level long videos. | Xinyuan Chen, Yaohui Wang, Lingjun Zhang, Shaobin Zhuang, Xin Ma, Jiashuo Yu, Yali Wang, Dahua Lin, Yu Qiao, Ziwei Liu |  |

Although previous saliency-based methods addressed the challenges, their perturbation may not alleviate the distribution shift issue, which is inevitable especially in heterogeneous samples. We present ContraLSP, a locally sparse model that introduces counterfactual samples to build uninformative perturbations but keeps distribution using contrastive learning. Furthermore, we incorporate sample-specific sparse gates to generate more binary-skewed and smooth masks, which easily integrate temporal trends and select the salient features parsimoniously. Empirical studies on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that ContraLSP outperforms state-of-the-art models, demonstrating a substantial improvement in explanation quality for time series data.

Despite the inclusion of empirical evaluations in all the proposed algorithms, the interrogative aspects of these evaluations lack diversity. As a result, various facets of explainability pertaining to GNNs, such as a comparative analysis of counterfactual reasoners, their stability to variational factors such as different GNN architectures, noise, stochasticity in non-convex loss surfaces, feasibility amidst domain constraints, and so forth, have yet to be formally investigated. Motivated by this need, we present a benchmarking study on perturbation-based explainability methods for GNNs, aiming to systematically evaluate and compare a wide range of explainability techniques. Among the key findings of our study, we identify the Pareto-optimal methods that exhibit superior efficacy and stability in the presence of noise. Nonetheless, our study reveals that all algorithms are affected by stability issues when faced with noisy data. Furthermore, we have established that the current generation of counterfactual explainers often fails to provide feasible recourses due to violations of topological constraints encoded by domain-specific considerations. Overall, this benchmarking study empowers stakeholders in the field of GNNs with a comprehensive understanding of the state-of-the-art explainability methods, potential research problems for further enhancement, and the implications of their application in real-world scenarios. | Mert Kosan, Samidha Verma, Burouj Armgaan, Khushbu Pahwa, Ambuj K.

Learning grounded representations of objects that are guaranteed to be stable and invariant promises robust performance across different tasks and environments. Slot Attention (SA) learns object-centric representations by assigning objects to \*slots\*, but presupposes a \*single\* distribution from which all slots are randomly initialised. This results in an inability to learn \*specialized\* slots which bind to specific object types and remain invariant to identity-preserving changes in object appearance. To address this, we present \*Conditional Slot Attention\* (CoSA) using a novel concept of \*Grounded Slot Dictionary\* (GSD) inspired by vector quantization. Our proposed GSD comprises (i) canonical object-level property vectors and (ii) parametric Gaussian distributions, which define a prior over the slots. We demonstrate the benefits of our method in multiple downstream tasks such as scene generation, composition, and task adaptation, whilst remaining competitive with SA in object discovery. | Avinash Kori, Francesco Locatello, Fabio De Sousa Ribeiro, Francesca Toni, Ben Glocker |  |
| 1032 |  |  [On the Stability of Expressive Positional Encodings for Graphs](https://openreview.net/forum?id=xAqcJ9XoTf) |  | 0 | Designing effective positional encodings for graphs is key to building powerful graph transformers and enhancing message-passing graph neural networks. Although widespread, using Laplacian eigenvectors as positional encodings faces two fundamental challenges: (1) \*Non-uniqueness\*: there are many different eigendecompositions of the same Laplacian, and (2) \*Instability\*: small perturbations to the Laplacian could result in completely different eigenspaces, leading to unpredictable changes in positional encoding. Despite many attempts to address non-uniqueness, most methods overlook stability, leading to poor generalization on unseen graph structures. We identify the cause of instability to be the use of "hard partition'' of eigenspaces. Hence, we introduce Stable and Expressive Positional Encodings (SPE), an architecture for processing eigenvectors that uses eigenvalues to \`\`softly partition'' eigenspaces. SPE is the first architecture that is (1) provably stable, and (2) universally expressive for basis invariant functions whilst respecting all symmetries of eigenvectors. Besides guaranteed stability, we prove that SPE is at least as expressive as existing methods, and highly capable of counting graph structures. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our method on molecular property prediction, and out-of-distribution generalization tasks, finding improved generalization compared to existing positional encoding methods.

The ANN design was initially inspired by principles of biology. The biological neural network's fundamental response process comprises information transmission and aggregation. The information transmission in biological neurons is often achieved by triggering action potentials that propagate through axons. ANNs utilize activation mechanisms to simulate such biological behavior. However, previous studies have only considered static response conditions, while the biological neuron's response conditions are typically dynamic, depending on multiple factors such as neuronal properties and the real-time environment. Therefore, the dynamic response conditions of biological neurons could help improve the static ones of existing activations in ANNs. Additionally, the biological neuron's aggregated response exhibits high specificity for different categories, allowing the nervous system to differentiate and identify objects. Inspired by these biological patterns, we propose a novel Dynamic Neural Response Tuning (DNRT) mechanism, which aligns the response patterns of ANNs with those of biological neurons. DNRT comprises Response-Adaptive Activation (RAA) and Aggregated Response Regularization (ARR), mimicking the biological neuron's information transmission and aggregation behaviors. RAA dynamically adjusts the response condition based on the characteristics and strength of the input signal. ARR is devised to enhance the network's ability to learn category specificity by imposing constraints on the network's response distribution. Extensive experimental studies indicate that the proposed DNRT is highly interpretable, applicable to various mainstream network architectures, and can achieve remarkable performance compared with existing neural response mechanisms in multiple tasks and domains.

However, excessive optimization with such reward models, which serve as mere proxy objectives, can compromise the performance of fine-tuned models, a phenomenon known as reward overoptimization. To investigate this issue in depth, we introduce the Text-Image Alignment Assessment (TIA2) benchmark, which comprises a diverse collection of text prompts, images, and human annotations. Our evaluation of several state-of-the-art reward models on this benchmark reveals their frequent misalignment with human assessment. We empirically demonstrate that overoptimization occurs notably when a poorly aligned reward model is used as the fine-tuning objective. To address this, we propose TextNorm, a simple method that enhances alignment based on a measure of reward model confidence estimated across a set of semantically contrastive text prompts. We demonstrate that incorporating the confidence-calibrated rewards in fine-tuning effectively reduces overoptimization, resulting in twice as many wins in human evaluation for text-image alignment compared against the baseline reward models. | Kyuyoung Kim, Jongheon Jeong, Minyong An, Mohammad Ghavamzadeh, Krishnamurthy Dj Dvijotham, Jinwoo Shin, Kimin Lee |  |

Despite its popularity in real-world applications, the theoretical understanding of that gating function has remained an open problem. The main challenge comes from the structure of the top-K sparse softmax gating function, which partitions the input space into multiple regions with distinct behaviors. By focusing on a Gaussian mixture of experts, we establish theoretical results on the effects of the top-K sparse softmax gating function on both density and parameter estimations. Our results hinge upon defining novel loss functions among parameters to capture different behaviors of the input regions. When the true number of experts $k_{\ast}$ is known, we demonstrate that the convergence rates of density and parameter estimations are both parametric on the sample size. However, when $k_{\ast}$ becomes unknown and the true model is over-specified by a Gaussian mixture of $k$ experts where $k > k_{\ast}$, our findings suggest that the number of experts selected from the top-K sparse softmax gating function must exceed the total cardinality of a certain number of Voronoi cells associated with the true parameters to guarantee the convergence of the density estimation. Moreover, while the density estimation rate remains parametric under this setting, the parameter estimation rates become substantially slow due to an intrinsic interaction between the softmax gating and expert functions. | Huy Nguyen, Pedram Akbarian, Fanqi Yan, Nhat Ho |  |
| 1036 |  |  [The Devil is in the Neurons: Interpreting and Mitigating Social Biases in Language Models](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SQGUDc9tC8) |  | 0 | Pre-trained Language models (PLMs) have been acknowledged to contain harmful information, such as social biases, which may cause negative social impacts or even bring catastrophic results in application. Previous works on this problem mainly focused on using black-box methods such as probing to detect and quantify social biases in PLMs by observing model outputs. As a result, previous debiasing methods mainly finetune or even pre-train PLMs on newly constructed anti-stereotypical datasets, which are high-cost. In this work, we try to unveil the mystery of social bias inside language models by introducing the concept of {\sc Social Bias Neurons}. Specifically, we propose {\sc Integrated Gap Gradients (IG$^2$)} to accurately pinpoint units (i.e., neurons) in a language model that can be attributed to undesirable behavior, such as social bias. By formalizing undesirable behavior as a distributional property of language, we employ sentiment-bearing prompts to elicit classes of sensitive words (demographics) correlated with such sentiments. Our IG$^2$ thus attributes the uneven distribution for different demographics to specific Social Bias Neurons, which track the trail of unwanted behavior inside PLM units to achieve interoperability. Moreover, derived from our interpretable technique, {\sc Bias Neuron Suppression (BNS)} is further proposed to mitigate social biases. By studying BERT, RoBERTa, and their attributable differences from debiased FairBERTa, IG$^2$ allows us to locate and suppress identified neurons, and further mitigate undesired behaviors. As measured by prior metrics from StereoSet, our model achieves a higher degree of fairness while maintaining language modeling ability with low cost\footnote{This work contains examples that potentially implicate stereotypes, associations, and other harms that could be offensive to individuals in certain social groups.}. | Yan Liu, Yu Liu, Xiaokang Chen, PinYu Chen, Daoguang Zan, MinYen Kan, TsungYi Ho |  |

In this paper, we present a novel risk-sensitive RL framework that employs an Iterated Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) objective under both linear and general function approximations, enriched by human feedback. These new formulations provide a principled way to guarantee safety in each decision making step throughout the control process. Moreover, integrating human feedback into risk-sensitive RL framework bridges the gap between algorithmic decision-making and human participation, allowing us to also guarantee safety for human-in-the-loop systems. We propose provably sample-efficient algorithms for this Iterated CVaR RL and provide rigorous theoretical analysis. Furthermore, we establish a matching lower bound to corroborate the optimality of our algorithms in a linear context. | Yu Chen, Yihan Du, Pihe Hu, Siwei Wang, Desheng Wu, Longbo Huang |  |

In these transfer learning scenarios, the prior distribution for downstream data becomes crucial in Bayesian model averaging (BMA). While previous works proposed the prior over the neural network parameters centered around the pre-trained solution, such strategies have limitations when dealing with distribution shifts between upstream and downstream data. This paper introduces nonparametric transfer learning (NPTL), a flexible posterior sampling method to address the distribution shift issue within the context of nonparametric learning. The nonparametric learning (NPL) method is a recent approach that employs a nonparametric prior for posterior sampling, efficiently accounting for model misspecification scenarios, which is suitable for transfer learning scenarios that may involve the distribution shift between upstream and downstream tasks. Through extensive empirical validations, we demonstrate that our approach surpasses other baselines in BMA performance. | Hyungi Lee, Giung Nam, Edwin Fong, Juho Lee |  |

LLM-based autonomous agents can interact with diverse tools (e.g., functional APIs) and generate solution plans that execute a series of API function calls in a step-by-step manner. The multitude of candidate API function calls significantly expands the action space, amplifying the critical need for efficient action space navigation. However, existing methods either struggle with unidirectional exploration in expansive action spaces, trapped into a locally optimal solution, or suffer from exhaustively traversing all potential actions, causing inefficient navigation. To address these issues, we propose ToolChain\*, an efficient tree search-based planning algorithm for LLM-based agents. It formulates the entire action space as a decision tree, where each node represents a possible API function call involved in a solution plan. By incorporating the A$^\*$ search algorithm with task-specific cost function design, it efficiently prunes high-cost branches that may involve incorrect actions, identifying the most low-cost valid path as the solution. Extensive experiments on multiple tool-use and reasoning tasks demonstrate that ToolChain\* efficiently balances exploration and exploitation within an expansive action space. It outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on planning and reasoning tasks by 3.1% and 3.5% on average while requiring 7.35x and 2.31x less time, respectively. | Yuchen Zhuang, Xiang Chen, Tong Yu, Saayan Mitra, Victor S.

We observe that existing unsupervised parsers capture different aspects of parsing structures, which can be leveraged to enhance unsupervised parsing performance. To this end, we propose a notion of "tree averaging," based on which we further propose a novel ensemble method for unsupervised parsing. To improve inference efficiency, we further distill the ensemble knowledge into a student model; such an ensemble-then-distill process is an effective approach to mitigate the over-smoothing problem existing in common multi-teacher distilling methods. Experiments show that our method surpasses all previous approaches, consistently demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness across various runs, with different ensemble components, and under domain-shift conditions. | Behzad Shayegh, Yanshuai Cao, Xiaodan Zhu, Jackie C.

A Study in Length Generalization](https://openreview.net/forum?id=AssIuHnmHX) |  | 0 | Large language models exhibit surprising emergent generalization properties, yet also struggle on many simple reasoning tasks such as arithmetic and parity. In this work, we focus on length generalization, and we propose a unifying framework to understand when and how Transformers can be expected to length generalize on a given task. First, we show that there exist algorithmic tasks for which standard decoder-only Transformers trained from scratch naturally exhibit strong length generalization. For these tasks, we leverage the RASP programming language (Weiss et al., 2021) to show that the correct algorithmic solution which solves the task can be represented by a simple Transformer. We thus propose the RASP-Generalization Conjecture: Transformers tend to learn a length-generalizing solution if there exists a short RASP-L program that works for all input lengths. We present empirical evidence to support the correlation between RASP-simplicity and generalization. We leverage our insights to give new scratchpad formats which yield strong length generalization on traditionally hard tasks (such as parity and addition), and we illustrate how scratchpad can hinder generalization when it increases the complexity of the corresponding RASP-L program. Overall, our work provides a novel perspective on the mechanisms of length generalization and the algorithmic capabilities of Transformers. | Hattie Zhou, Arwen Bradley, Etai Littwin, Noam Razin, Omid Saremi, Joshua M.

As a consequence of posterior collapse, the latent variables extracted by the encoder in VAE preserve less information from the input data and thus fail to produce meaningful representations as input to the reconstruction process in the decoder. While this phenomenon has been an actively addressed topic related to VAE performance, the theory for posterior collapse remains underdeveloped, especially beyond the standard VAE. In this work, we advance the theoretical understanding of posterior collapse to two important and prevalent yet less studied classes of VAE: conditional VAE and hierarchical VAE. Specifically, via a non-trivial theoretical analysis of linear conditional VAE and hierarchical VAE with two levels of latent, we prove that the cause of posterior collapses in these models includes the correlation between the input and output of the conditional VAE and the effect of learnable encoder variance in the hierarchical VAE. We empirically validate our theoretical findings for linear conditional and hierarchical VAE and demonstrate that these results are also predictive for non-linear cases with extensive experiments. | Hien Dang, Tho Tran Huu, Tan Minh Nguyen, Nhat Ho |  |

Existing approaches have successfully adapted the diffusion model, the most effective generative model in image generation, to create 1D SMILES strings, 2D chemical graphs, or 3D molecular conformers. However, these methods are not efficient and flexible enough to generate 3D molecules with multiple desired properties, as they require additional training for the models for each new property or even a new combination of existing properties. Moreover, some properties may potentially conflict, making it impossible to find a molecule that satisfies all of them simultaneously. To address these challenges, we present a training-free conditional 3D molecular generation algorithm based on off-the-shelf unconditional diffusion models and property prediction models. The key techniques include modeling the loss of property prediction models as energy functions, considering the property relation between multiple conditions as a probabilistic graph, and developing a stable posterior estimation for computing the conditional score function. We conducted experiments on both single-objective and multi-objective 3D molecule generation, focusing on quantum properties, and compared our approach with the trained or fine-tuned diffusion models. Our proposed model achieves superior performance in generating molecules that meet the conditions, without any additional training cost. | Xu Han, Caihua Shan, Yifei Shen, Can Xu, Han Yang, Xiang Li, Dongsheng Li |  |

Drawing inspiration from neuroscience, we develop the Information-Theoretic Hierarchical Perception (ITHP) model, which utilizes the concept of information bottleneck. Different from most traditional fusion models that incorporate all modalities identically in neural networks, our model designates a prime modality and regards the remaining modalities as detectors in the information pathway, serving to distill the flow of information. Our proposed perception model focuses on constructing an effective and compact information flow by achieving a balance between the minimization of mutual information between the latent state and the input modal state, and the maximization of mutual information between the latent states and the remaining modal states. This approach leads to compact latent state representations that retain relevant information while minimizing redundancy, thereby substantially enhancing the performance of multimodal representation learning. Experimental evaluations on the MUStARD, CMU-MOSI, and CMU-MOSEI datasets demonstrate that our model consistently distills crucial information in multimodal learning scenarios, outperforming state-of-the-art benchmarks. Remarkably, on the CMU-MOSI dataset, ITHP surpasses human-level performance in the multimodal sentiment binary classification task across all evaluation metrics (i.e., Binary Accuracy, F1 Score, Mean Absolute Error, and Pearson Correlation). | Xiongye Xiao, Gengshuo Liu, Gaurav Gupta, Defu Cao, Shixuan Li, Yaxing Li, Tianqing Fang, Mingxi Cheng, Paul Bogdan |  |

There has been an exponential growth in the amount of computation needed to train the largest models. Therefore, to scale computation and data, these models are inevitably trained in a distributed manner in clusters of nodes, and their updates are aggregated before being applied to the model. However, a distributed setup is prone to Byzantine failures of individual nodes, components, and software. With data augmentation added to these settings, there is a critical need for robust and efficient aggregation systems. We define the quality of workers as reconstruction ratios $\in (0,1]$, and formulate aggregation as a Maximum Likelihood Estimation procedure using Beta densities. We show that the Regularized form of log-likelihood wrt subspace can be approximately solved using iterative least squares solver, and provide convergence guarantees using recent Convex Optimization landscape results. Our empirical findings demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the robustness of state-of-the-art Byzantine resilient aggregators. We evaluate our method in a distributed setup with a parameter server, and show simultaneous improvements in communication efficiency and accuracy across various tasks. | Hamidreza Almasi, Harsh Mishra, Balajee Vamanan, Sathya N.

The influence function is a principled and popular data attribution method, but its computational cost often makes it challenging to use. This issue becomes more pronounced in the setting of large language models and text-to-image models. In this work, we propose DataInf, an efficient influence approximation method that is practical for large-scale generative AI models. Leveraging an easy-to-compute closed-form expression, DataInf outperforms existing influence computation algorithms in terms of computational and memory efficiency. Our theoretical analysis shows that DataInf is particularly well-suited for parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques such as LoRA. Through systematic empirical evaluations, we show that DataInf accurately approximates influence scores and is orders of magnitude faster than existing methods. In applications to RoBERTa-large, Llama-2-13B-chat, and stable-diffusion-v1.5 models, DataInf effectively identifies the most influential fine-tuning examples better than other approximate influence scores. Moreover, it can help to identify which data points are mislabeled. | Yongchan Kwon, Eric Wu, Kevin Wu, James Zou |  |

To better understand this phenomenon, we investigate whether there are benefits of DG algorithms over ERM through the lens of label noise. Specifically, our finite-sample analysis reveals that label noise exacerbates the effect of spurious correlations for ERM, undermining generalization. Conversely, we illustrate that DG algorithms exhibit implicit label-noise robustness during finite-sample training even when spurious correlation is present. Such desirable property helps mitigate spurious correlations and improve generalization in synthetic experiments. However, additional comprehensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets indicate that label-noise robustness does not necessarily translate to better performance compared to ERM. We conjecture that the failure mode of ERM arising from spurious correlations may be less pronounced in practice.

Yet, their inherent lack of interpretability remains a significant challenge, as these features are often opaque to human understanding. In this paper, we propose Non-negative Contrastive Learning (NCL), a renaissance of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) aimed at deriving interpretable features. The power of NCL lies in its enforcement of non-negativity constraints on features, reminiscent of NMF's capability to extract features that align closely with sample clusters. NCL not only aligns mathematically well with an NMF objective but also preserves NMF's interpretability attributes, resulting in a more sparse and disentangled representation compared to standard contrastive learning (CL). Theoretically, we establish guarantees on the identifiability and downstream generalization of NCL. Empirically, we show that these advantages enable NCL to outperform CL significantly on feature disentanglement, feature selection, as well as downstream classification tasks. At last, we show that NCL can be easily extended to other learning scenarios and benefit supervised learning as well.

In this work, we present a new methodology for performing image clustering based on user-specified criteria in the form of text by leveraging modern Vision-Language Models and Large Language Models. We call our method Image Clustering Conditioned on Text Criteria (IC$\|$TC), and it represents a different paradigm of image clustering.

While the most common private learning algorithm, DP-SGD, adds independent Gaussian noise in each iteration, recent work on matrix factorization mechanisms has shown empirically that introducing correlations in the noise can greatly improve their utility. We characterize the asymptotic learning utility for any choice of the correlation function, giving precise analytical bounds for linear regression and as the solution to a convex program for general convex functions. We show, using these bounds, how correlated noise provably improves upon vanilla DP-SGD as a function of problem parameters such as the effective dimension and condition number. Moreover, our analytical expression for the near-optimal correlation function circumvents the cubic complexity of the semi-definite program used to optimize the noise correlation matrix in previous work. We validate these theoretical results with experiments on private deep learning. Our work matches or outperforms prior work while being efficient both in terms of computation and memory. | Christopher A.

For example, if some unsafe conversations are wrongly annotated as safe ones, the model fine-tuned on these samples may be harmful. Therefore, the correctness of annotations, i.e., the credibility of the dataset, is important. This study focuses on the credibility of real-world datasets, including the popular benchmarks Jigsaw Civil Comments, Anthropic Harmless & Red Team, PKU BeaverTails & SafeRLHF, that can be used for training a harmless language model. Given the cost and difficulty of cleaning these datasets by humans, we introduce a systematic framework for evaluating the credibility of datasets, identifying label errors, and evaluating the influence of noisy labels in the curated language data, specifically focusing on unsafe comments and conversation classification. With the framework, we find and fix an average of \*\*6.16\%\*\* label errors in \*\*11\*\* datasets constructed from the above benchmarks. The data credibility and downstream learning performance can be remarkably improved by directly fixing label errors, indicating the significance of cleaning existing real-world datasets.

Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with tail entity scoring achieve the state-of-the-art performance on KG reasoning. However, the theoretical understandings for these GNNs are either lacking or focusing on single-relational graphs, leaving what the kind of rules these GNNs can learn an open problem. We propose to fill the above gap in this paper. Specifically, GNNs with tail entity scoring are unified into a common framework. Then, we analyze their expressivity by formally describing the rule structures they can learn and theoretically demonstrating their superiority. These results further inspire us to propose a novel labeling strategy to learn more rules in KG reasoning. Experimental results are consistent with our theoretical findings and verify the effectiveness of our proposed method. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/LARS-research/Rule-learning-expressivity. | Haiquan Qiu, Yongqi Zhang, Yong Li, Quanming Yao |  |

However, existing benchmarks for constrained generation usually focus on fixed constraint types (e.g. generate a sentence containing certain words) that have proved to be easy for state-of-the-art models like GPT-4. We present COLLIE, a grammar-based framework that allows the specification of rich, compositional constraints with diverse generation levels (word, sentence, paragraph, passage) and modeling challenges (e.g. language understanding, logical reasoning, counting, semantic planning). We also develop tools for automatic extraction of task instances given a constraint structure and a raw text corpus. Using COLLIE, we compile the COLLIE-v1 dataset with 1,132 instances comprising 13 constraint structures. We perform systematic experiments across five state-of-the-art instruction-tuned language models and analyze their performances to reveal shortcomings. COLLIE is designed to be extensible and lightweight, and we hope the community finds it useful to develop more complex constraints and evaluations in the future. | Shunyu Yao, Howard Chen, Austin W.

| 1054 |  |  [GENOME: Generative Neuro-Symbolic Visual Reasoning by Growing and Reusing Modules](https://openreview.net/forum?id=MNShbDSxKH) |  | 0 | Recent works have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) could empower traditional neuro-symbolic models via programming capabilities to translate languages into module descriptions, thus achieving strong visual reasoning results while maintaining the model’s transparency and efficiency. However, these models usually exhaustively generate the entire code snippet given each new instance of a task, which is extremely ineffective. On the contrary, human beings gradually acquire knowledge that can be reused and grow into more profound skills for fast generalization to new tasks since we are an infant. Inspired by this, we propose generative neuro-symbolic visual reasoning by growing and reusing modules. Specifically, our model consists of three unique stages, module initialization, module generation, and module execution. First, given a vision-language task, we adopt LLMs to examine whether we could reuse and grow over established modules to handle this new task. If not, we initialize a new module needed by the task and specify the inputs and outputs of this new module. After that, the new module is created by querying LLMs to generate corresponding code snippets that match the requirements. In order to get a better sense of the new module’s ability, we treat few-shot training examples as test cases to see if our new module could pass these cases. If yes, the new module is added to the module library for future reuse. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our model on the testing set by executing the parsed programs with the newly made visual modules to get the results. We find the proposed GENOME model possesses several advantages. First, it performs competitively on standard tasks like visual question answering and referring expression comprehension; Second, the visual modules learned from one task can be seamlessly transferred to new tasks; Last but not least, it is able to adapt to new visual reasoning tasks by observing a few training examples and reusing modules. | Zhenfang Chen, Rui Sun, Wenjun Liu, Yining Hong, Chuang Gan |  |

This work identifies a fundamental optimization obstacle in RFT: we prove that the expected gradient for an input vanishes when its reward standard deviation under the model is small, even if the expected reward is far from optimal. Through experiments on an RFT benchmark and controlled environments, as well as a theoretical analysis, we then demonstrate that vanishing gradients due to small reward standard deviation are prevalent and detrimental, leading to extremely slow reward maximization. Lastly, we explore ways to overcome vanishing gradients in RFT. We find the common practice of an initial supervised finetuning (SFT) phase to be the most promising candidate, which sheds light on its importance in an RFT pipeline. Moreover, we show that a relatively small number of SFT optimization steps on as few as 1% of the input samples can suffice, indicating that the initial SFT phase need not be expensive in terms of compute and data labeling efforts. Overall, our results emphasize that being mindful for inputs whose expected gradient vanishes, as measured by the reward standard deviation, is crucial for successful execution of RFT. | Noam Razin, Hattie Zhou, Omid Saremi, Vimal Thilak, Arwen Bradley, Preetum Nakkiran, Joshua M.

However, when different classes have similar visual features, it becomes challenging for human annotators to differentiate them. When an image is ambiguous, such as a blurry one where an annotator can't distinguish between a husky and a wolf, it may be labeled with both classes: {husky, wolf}. This scenario necessitates the use of composite set labels. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Hyper-Evidential Neural Network (HENN) that explicitly models predictive uncertainty caused by composite set labels in training data in the context of the belief theory called Subjective Logic (SL). By placing a Grouped Dirichlet distribution on the class probabilities, we treat predictions of a neural network as parameters of hyper-subjective opinions and learn the network that collects both single and composite evidence leading to these hyper-opinions by a deterministic DNN from data. We introduce a new uncertainty type called vagueness originally designed for hyper-opinions in SL to quantify composite classification uncertainty for DNNs. Our experiments prove that HENN outperforms its state-of-the-art counterparts based on four image datasets.

As a result, it is often appropriate to think of the reward function as a \*proxy\* for the true objective rather than as its definition. We study this phenomenon through the lens of \*Goodhart’s law\*, which predicts that increasing optimisation of an imperfect proxy beyond some critical point decreases performance on the true objective. First, we propose a way to \*quantify\* the magnitude of this effect and \*show empirically\* that optimising an imperfect proxy reward often leads to the behaviour predicted by Goodhart’s law for a wide range of environments and reward functions. We then provide a \*geometric explanation\* for why Goodhart's law occurs in Markov decision processes. We use these theoretical insights to propose an \*optimal early stopping method\* that provably avoids the aforementioned pitfall and derive theoretical \*regret bounds\* for this method. Moreover, we derive a training method that maximises worst-case reward, for the setting where there is uncertainty about the true reward function. Finally, we evaluate our early stopping method experimentally. Our results support a foundation for a theoretically-principled study of reinforcement learning under reward misspecification. | Jacek Karwowski, Oliver Hayman, Xingjian Bai, Klaus Kiendlhofer, Charlie Griffin, Joar Max Viktor Skalse |  |

However, sampling from diffusion policies is considerably slow because it necessitates tens to hundreds of iterative inference steps for one action. To address this issue, we propose to extract an efficient deterministic inference policy from critic models and pretrained diffusion behavior models, leveraging the latter to directly regularize the policy gradient with the behavior distribution’s score function during optimization. Our method enjoys powerful generative capabilities of diffusion modeling while completely circumventing the computationally intensive and time-consuming diffusion sampling scheme, both during training and evaluation. Extensive results on D4RL tasks show that our method boosts action sampling speed by more than 25 times compared with various leading diffusion-based methods in locomotion tasks, while still maintaining state-of-the-art performance. | Huayu Chen, Cheng Lu, Zhengyi Wang, Hang Su, Jun Zhu |  |

Recently, training-free NAS as an emerging paradigm has successfully reduced the search costs of standard training-based NAS by estimating the true architecture performance with only training-free metrics. Nevertheless, the estimation ability of these metrics typically varies across different tasks, making it challenging to achieve robust and consistently good search performance on diverse tasks with only a single training-free metric. Meanwhile, the estimation gap between training-free metrics and the true architecture performances limits training-free NAS to achieve superior performance. To address these challenges, we propose the robustifying and boosting training-free NAS (RoBoT) algorithm which (a) employs the optimized combination of existing training-free metrics explored from Bayesian optimization to develop a robust and consistently better-performing metric on diverse tasks, and (b) applies greedy search, i.e., the exploitation, on the newly developed metric to bridge the aforementioned gap and consequently to boost the search performance of standard training-free NAS further. Remarkably, the expected performance of our RoBoT can be theoretically guaranteed, which improves over the existing training-free NAS under mild conditions with additional interesting insights. Our extensive experiments on various NAS benchmark tasks yield substantial empirical evidence to support our theoretical results. | Zhenfeng He, Yao Shu, Zhongxiang Dai, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low |  |
| 1060 |  |  [Concept Bottleneck Generative Models](https://openreview.net/forum?id=L9U5MJJleF) |  | 0 | We introduce a generative model with an intrinsically interpretable layer---a concept bottleneck layer---that constrains the model to encode human-understandable concepts. The concept bottleneck layer partitions the generative model into three parts: the pre-concept bottleneck portion, the CB layer, and the post-concept bottleneck portion. To train CB generative models, we complement the traditional task-based loss function for training generative models with a concept loss and an orthogonality loss. The CB layer and these loss terms are model agnostic, which we demonstrate by applying the CB layer to three different families of generative models: generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoders, and diffusion models. On multiple datasets across different types of generative models, steering a generative model, with the CB layer, outperforms all baselines---in some cases, it is \textit{10 times} more effective. In addition, we show how the CB layer can be used to interpret the output of the generative model and debug the model during or post training. | Aya Abdelsalam Ismail, Julius Adebayo, Héctor Corrada Bravo, Stephen Ra, Kyunghyun Cho |  |

This is achieved through two primary schemes: i) Scaling-Inputs: Amplifying (input, output) pairs per task instruction, aiming for better instruction adherence. ii) Scaling Input-Free Tasks: Enlarging tasks, each composed of an (instruction, output) pair (without requiring a separate input anymore). However, LLMs under Scaling-Inputs tend to be overly sensitive to inputs, leading to misinterpretation or non-compliance with instructions. Conversely, Scaling Input-Free Tasks demands a substantial number of tasks but is less effective in instruction following when dealing with instances in Scaling-Inputs. This work introduces MUFFIN, a new scheme of instruction-following dataset curation. Specifically, we automatically Scale Tasks per Input by diversifying these tasks with various input facets. Experimental results across four zero-shot benchmarks, spanning both Scaling-Inputs and Scaling Input-Free Tasks schemes, reveal that LLMs, at various scales, trained on MUFFIN generally demonstrate superior instruction-following capabilities compared to those trained on the two aforementioned schemes. | Renze Lou, Kai Zhang, Jian Xie, Yuxuan Sun, Janice Ahn, Hanzi Xu, Yu Su, Wenpeng Yin |  |

Recent works have confirmed that while additional fine-tuning of the zero-shot model on the reference data results in enhanced downstream performance, it compromises the model's robustness against distribution shifts. Our investigation begins by examining the conditions required to achieve the goals of robust fine-tuning, employing descriptions based on feature distortion theory and joint energy-based models. Subsequently, we propose a novel robust fine-tuning algorithm, Lipsum-FT, that effectively utilizes the language modeling aspect of the vision-language pre-trained models. Extensive experiments conducted on distribution shift scenarios in DomainNet and ImageNet confirm the superiority of our proposed Lipsum-FT approach over existing robust fine-tuning methods. | Giung Nam, Byeongho Heo, Juho Lee |  |

Existing work tackles this problem using generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, GANs are unstable during training, and they can suffer from mode collapse. While variational autoencoders (VAEs) are known to be more robust to the these issues, they are (surprisingly) less considered for time series generation. In this work, we introduce Koopman VAE (KoVAE), a new generative framework that is based on a novel design for the model prior, and that can be optimized for either regular and irregular training data. Inspired by Koopman theory, we represent the latent conditional prior dynamics using a linear map. Our approach enhances generative modeling with two desired features: (i) incorporating domain knowledge can be achieved by leveraging spectral tools that prescribe constraints on the eigenvalues of the linear map; and (ii) studying the qualitative behavior and stability of the system can be performed using tools from dynamical systems theory. Our results show that KoVAE outperforms state-of-the-art GAN and VAE methods across several challenging synthetic and real-world time series generation benchmarks. Whether trained on regular or irregular data, KoVAE generates time series that improve both discriminative and predictive metrics. We also present visual evidence suggesting that KoVAE learns probability density functions that better approximate the empirical ground truth distribution. | Ilan Naiman, N.

As examples are often an under-specification of one's intent, a good synthesizer must choose the intended program from the many that are consistent with the given set of examples. Prior work frames program synthesis as a cooperative game between a listener (that synthesizes programs) and a speaker (a user choosing examples), and shows that models of computational pragmatic inference are effective in choosing the user intended programs. However, these models require counterfactual reasoning over a large set of programs and examples, which is infeasible in realistic program spaces. In this paper, we propose PraX, a novel way to amortize this search with neural networks. We sample pairs of programs and examples via self-play between listener and speaker models, and use pragmatic inference to choose informative training examples from this sample. We then use the informative dataset to train models to improve the synthesizer's ability to disambiguate user-provided examples _without human supervision_. We validate PraX on the challenging task of synthesizing regular expressions from example strings, and find that our method (1) outperforms models trained without choosing pragmatic examples by 23% (a 51% relative increase) (2) matches the performance of supervised learning on a dataset of pragmatic examples provided by humans, despite using no human data in training. | Saujas Vaduguru, Daniel Fried, Yewen Pu |  |

In this work, we consider the RLHF setting where the feedback is given in the format of preferences over pairs of trajectories. In the linear MDP model, using randomization in algorithm design, we present an algorithm that is sample efficient (i.e., has near-optimal worst-case regret bounds) and has polynomial running time (i.e., computational complexity is polynomial with respect to relevant parameters). Our algorithm further minimizes the query complexity through a novel randomized active learning procedure. In particular, our algorithm demonstrates a near-optimal tradeoff between the regret bound and the query complexity. To extend the results to more general nonlinear function approximation, we design a model-based randomized algorithm inspired by the idea of Thompson sampling. Our algorithm minimizes Bayesian regret bound and query complexity, again achieving a near-optimal tradeoff between these two quantities. Computation-wise, similar to the prior Thompson sampling algorithms under the regular RL setting, the main computation primitives of our algorithm are Bayesian supervised learning oracles which have been heavily investigated on the empirical side when applying Thompson sampling algorithms to RL benchmark problems. | Runzhe Wu, Wen Sun |  |

In this paper, we give query and regret optimal bandit algorithms under the strict notion of strongly adaptive regret, which measures the maximum regret over any contiguous interval $I$. Due to its worst-case nature, there is an almost-linear $\Omega(\|I\|^{1-\epsilon})$ regret lower bound, when only one query per round is allowed [Daniely el al, ICML 2015]. Surprisingly, with just two queries per round, we give Strongly Adaptive Bandit Learner (StABL) that achieves $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{n\|I\|})$ adaptive regret for multi-armed bandits with $n$ arms. The bound is tight and cannot be improved in general. Our algorithm leverages a multiplicative update scheme of varying stepsizes and a carefully chosen observation distribution to control the variance. Furthermore, we extend our results and provide optimal algorithms in the bandit convex optimization setting. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithms under volatile environments and for downstream tasks, such as algorithm selection for hyperparameter optimization. | Zhou Lu, Qiuyi Zhang, Xinyi Chen, Fred Zhang, David P.

However, existing methods can hardly discover diverse level patterns, while the lack of diversity makes the gameplay boring. This paper proposes an ensemble reinforcement learning approach that uses multiple negatively correlated sub-policies to generate different alternative level segments, and stochastically selects one of them following a selector model. A novel policy regularisation technique is integrated into the approach to diversify the generated alternatives. In addition, we develop theorems to provide general methodologies for optimising policy regularisation in a Markov decision process. The proposed approach is compared with several state-of-the-art policy ensemble methods and classic methods on a well-known level generation benchmark, with two different reward functions expressing game-design goals from different perspectives. Results show that our approach boosts level diversity notably with competitive performance in terms of the reward. Furthermore, by varying the regularisation coefficient, the trained generators form a well-spread Pareto front, allowing explicit trade-offs between diversity and rewards of generated levels. | Ziqi Wang, Chengpeng Hu, Jialin Liu, Xin Yao |  |
| 1068 |  |  [Achieving Sample and Computational Efficient Reinforcement Learning by Action Space Reduction via Grouping](https://openreview.net/forum?id=MOmqfJovQ6) |  | 0 | Reinforcement learning often needs to deal with the exponential growth of states and actions when exploring optimal control in high-dimensional spaces (often known as the curse of dimensionality). In this work, we address this issue by learning the inherent structure of action-wise similar MDP to appropriately balance the performance degradation versus sample/computational complexity. In particular, we partition the action spaces into multiple groups based on the similarity in transition distribution and reward function, and build a linear decomposition model to capture the difference between the intra-group transition kernel and the intra-group rewards. Both our theoretical analysis and experiments reveal a \*surprising and counter-intuitive result\*: while a more refined grouping strategy can reduce the approximation error caused by treating actions in the same group as identical, it also leads to increased estimation error when the size of samples or the computation resources is limited. This finding highlights the grouping strategy as a new degree of freedom that can be optimized to minimize the overall performance loss. To address this issue, we formulate a general optimization problem for determining the optimal grouping strategy, which strikes a balance between performance loss and sample/computational complexity. We further propose a computationally efficient method for selecting a nearly-optimal grouping strategy, which maintains its computational complexity independent of the size of the action space. | Yining Li, Peizhong Ju, Ness B.

We specifically consider target functions of the form $h = g \circ p$ where $p : \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a degree $k$ polynomial and $g: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a degree $q$ polynomial. This function class generalizes the single-index model, which corresponds to $k=1$, and is a natural class of functions possessing an underlying hierarchical structure. Our main result shows that for a large subclass of degree $k$ polynomials $p$, a three-layer neural network trained via layerwise gradient descent on the square loss learns the target $h$ up to vanishing test error in $\widetilde O(d^k)$ samples and polynomial time. This is a strict improvement over kernel methods, which require $\widetilde \Theta(d^{kq})$ samples, as well as existing guarantees for two-layer networks, which require the target function to be low-rank. Our result also generalizes prior works on three-layer neural networks, which were restricted to the case of $p$ being a quadratic. When $p$ is indeed a quadratic, we achieve the information-theoretically optimal sample complexity $\widetilde O(d^2)$, which is an improvement over prior work (Nichani et al., 2023) requiring a sample size of $\widetilde\Theta(d^4)$. Our proof proceeds by showing that during the initial stage of training the network performs feature learning to recover the feature $p$ with $\widetilde O(d^k)$ samples. This work demonstrates the ability of three-layer neural networks to learn complex features and as a result, learn a broad class of hierarchical functions. | Zihao Wang, Eshaan Nichani, Jason D.

Decades of hierarchical planning techniques have used domain-specific temporal action abstractions to support efficient and accurate planning, almost always relying on human priors and domain knowledge to decompose hard tasks into smaller subproblems appropriate for a goal or set of goals. This paper describes Ada (Action Domain Acquisition), a framework for automatically constructing task-specific planning representations using task-general background knowledge from language models (LMs). Starting with a general-purpose hierarchical planner and a low-level goal-conditioned policy, Ada interactively learns a library of planner-compatible high-level action abstractions and low-level controllers adapted to a particular domain of planning tasks. On two language-guided interactive planning benchmarks (Mini Minecraft and ALFRED Household Tasks), Ada strongly outperforms other approaches that use LMs for sequential decision-making, offering more accurate plans and better generalization to complex tasks. | Lionel Wong, Jiayuan Mao, Pratyusha Sharma, Zachary S.

While recent studies have successfully employed sequence- or structure-based representations to address multiple tasks in protein science, there has been significant oversight in incorporating protein surface information, a critical factor for protein function. In this paper, we present a pre-training strategy that incorporates information from protein sequences, 3D structures, and surfaces to improve protein representation learning. Specifically, we utilize Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) for learning surface characteristics, and name it ProteinINR. We confirm that ProteinINR successfully reconstructs protein surfaces, and integrate this surface learning into the existing pre-training strategy of sequences and structures. Our results demonstrate that our approach can enhance performance in various downstream tasks, thereby underscoring the importance of including surface attributes in protein representation learning. These findings underline the importance of understanding protein surfaces for generating effective protein representations. | Youhan Lee, Hasun Yu, Jaemyung Lee, Jaehoon Kim |  |

However, the unique movement pattern and inherent characteristics of ME allow them to be distinguished from other movements. Existing MES methods based on fixed reference frame degrade optical flow accuracy and are overly dependent on facial alignment. In this paper, we propose a skip-$k$-frame block-wise main directional mean optical flow (MDMO) feature for MES based on unfixed reference frame. By employing skip-$k$-frame strategy, we substantiate the existence of a distinct and exclusive movement pattern in ME, called M-pattern due to its feature curve resembling the letter \`M'. Based on M-pattern and characteristics of ME, we then provide a novel spotting rules to precisely locate ME intervals. Block-wise MDMO feature is capable of removing global movements without compromising complete ME movements in the early feature extraction stage. Besides, A novel pixelmatch-based facial alignment algorithm with dynamic update of reference frame is proposed to better align facial images and reduce jitter between frames. Experimental results on CAS(ME)$^2$, SAMM-LV and CASME II validate the proposed methods are superior to the state-of-the-art methods. | Jinxuan Wang, Shiting Xu, Tong Zhang |  |

To address this, we propose BayesDiff, a pixel-wise uncertainty estimator for generations from diffusion models based on Bayesian inference. In particular, we derive a novel uncertainty iteration principle to characterize the uncertainty dynamics in diffusion, and leverage the last-layer Laplace approximation for efficient Bayesian inference. The estimated pixel-wise uncertainty can not only be aggregated into a sample-wise metric to filter out low-fidelity images but also aids in augmenting successful generations and rectifying artifacts in failed generations in text-to-image tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of BayesDiff and its promise for practical applications. | Siqi Kou, Lei Gan, Dequan Wang, Chongxuan Li, Zhijie Deng |  |
| 1074 |  |  [D2 Pruning: Message Passing for Balancing Diversity & Difficulty in Data Pruning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=thbtoAkCe9) |  | 0 | In recent years, data quality has emerged as an important factor for training massive models. Analytical theories suggest that higher-quality data can lead to lower test errors in models trained on a fixed data budget. Moreover, a model can be trained on a lower compute budget without compromising performance if a dataset can be stripped of its redundancies. Coreset selection (or data pruning) seeks to select a subset of the training data so as to maximize the performance of models trained on this subset, also referred to as coreset. There are two dominant approaches: (1) geometry-based data selection for maximizing \*data diversity\* in the coreset, and (2) functions that assign \*difficulty scores\* to samples based on training dynamics. Optimizing for data diversity leads to a coreset that is biased towards easier samples, whereas, selection by difficulty ranking omits easy samples that are necessary for the training of deep learning models. This demonstrates that data diversity and importance scores are two complementary factors that need to be jointly considered during coreset selection. In this work, we represent a dataset as an undirected graph and propose a novel pruning algorithm, $\mathbb{D}^2$ Pruning, that uses message passing over this dataset graph for coreset selection. $\mathbb{D}^2$ Pruning updates the difficulty scores of each example by incorporating the difficulty of its neighboring examples in the dataset graph. Then, these updated difficulty scores direct a graph-based sampling method to select a coreset that encapsulates both diverse and difficult regions of the dataset space. We evaluate supervised and self-supervised versions of our method on various vision and NLP datasets. Results show that $\mathbb{D}^2$ Pruning improves coreset selection over previous state-of-the-art methods at low-to-medium pruning rates. Additionally, we find that using $\mathbb{D}^2$ Pruning for filtering large multimodal datasets leads to increased diversity in the dataset and improved generalization of pretrained models. Our work shows that $\mathbb{D}^2$ Pruning is a versatile framework for understanding and processing datasets. | Adyasha Maharana, Prateek Yadav, Mohit Bansal |  |

This is because personalized predictions require personalized knowledge graphs (KGs), which are difficult to generate from patient EHR data. To address this, we propose GraphCare, an open-world framework that uses external KGs to improve EHR-based predictions. Our method extracts knowledge from large language models (LLMs) and external biomedical KGs to build patient-specific KGs, which are then used to train our proposed Bi-attention AugmenTed (BAT) graph neural network (GNN) for healthcare predictions. On two public datasets, MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV, GraphCare surpasses baselines in four vital healthcare prediction tasks: mortality, readmission, length of stay (LOS), and drug recommendation. On MIMIC-III, it boosts AUROC by 17.6% and 6.6% for mortality and readmission, and F1-score by 7.9% and 10.8% for LOS and drug recommendation, respectively. Notably, GraphCare demonstrates a substantial edge in scenarios with limited data availability. Our findings highlight the potential of using external KGs in healthcare prediction tasks and demonstrate the promise of GraphCare in generating personalized KGs for promoting personalized medicine. | Pengcheng Jiang, Cao Xiao, Adam Cross, Jimeng Sun |  |

However, if the labeler wishes to be compensated for as many labels as possible before learning finishes, the labeler may benefit from actually slowing down learning. This incentive arises for instance if the labeler is to be replaced by the ML model once it is trained. In this paper, we initiate the study of learning from a strategic labeler, who may abstain from labeling to slow down learning. We first prove that strategic abstention can prolong learning, and propose a novel complexity measure and representation to analyze the query complexity of the learning game. Next, we develop a near-optimal deterministic algorithm, prove its robustness to strategic labeling, and contrast it with other active learning algorithms. We also analyze extensions that encompass more general learning goals and labeler assumptions. Finally, we characterize the query cost of multi-task active learning, with and without abstention. Our first exploration of strategic labeling aims to consolidate our theoretical understanding of the \emph{imitative} nature of ML in human-AI interaction. | Tom Yan, Chicheng Zhang |  |

Existing benchmarks, however, fail to rigorously assess generalizability. Therefore, we develop DockGen, a new benchmark based on the ligand-binding domains of proteins, and we show that existing machine learning-based docking models have very weak generalization abilities. We carefully analyze the scaling laws of ML-based docking and show that, by scaling data and model size, as well as integrating synthetic data strategies, we are able to significantly increase the generalization capacity and set new state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks. Further, we propose Confidence Bootstrapping, a new training paradigm that solely relies on the interaction between diffusion and confidence models and exploits the multi-resolution generation process of diffusion models. We demonstrate that Confidence Bootstrapping significantly improves the ability of ML-based docking methods to dock to unseen protein classes, edging closer to accurate and generalizable blind docking methods. | Gabriele Corso, Arthur Deng, Nicholas Polizzi, Regina Barzilay, Tommi S.

One of the major causes of the high generation latency is the sequential decoding approach adopted by almost all state-of-the-art LLMs. In this work, motivated by the thinking and writing process of humans, we propose Skeleton-of-Thought (SoT), which first guides LLMs to generate the skeleton of the answer, and then conducts parallel API calls or batched decoding to complete the contents of each skeleton point in parallel. Not only does SoT provide considerable speed-ups across 12 LLMs, but it can also potentially improve the answer quality on several question categories. SoT is an initial attempt at data-centric optimization for inference efficiency, and showcases the potential of eliciting high-quality answers by explicitly planning the answer structure in language. | Xuefei Ning, Zinan Lin, Zixuan Zhou, Zifu Wang, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang |  |

To effectively use LLMs for visual generation, one crucial component is the visual tokenizer that maps pixel-space inputs to discrete tokens appropriate for LLM learning. In this paper, we introduce \modelname{}, a video tokenizer designed to generate concise and expressive tokens for both videos and images using a common token vocabulary. Equipped with this new tokenizer, we show that LLMs outperform diffusion models on standard image and video generation benchmarks including ImageNet and Kinetics. In addition, we demonstrate that our tokenizer surpasses the previously top-performing video tokenizer on two more tasks: (1) video compression comparable to the next-generation video codec (VCC) according to human evaluations, and (2) learning effective representations for action recognition tasks. | Lijun Yu, José Lezama, Nitesh Bharadwaj Gundavarapu, Luca Versari, Kihyuk Sohn, David Minnen, Yong Cheng, Agrim Gupta, Xiuye Gu, Alexander G.

For a neural network of width $m$, $n$ input training data in $d$ dimension, it takes $\Omega(mnd)$ time cost per training iteration for the forward and backward computation. In this paper we analyze the convergence guarantee of adversarial training procedure on a two-layer neural network with shifted ReLU activation, and shows that only $o(m)$ neurons will be activated for each input data per iteration. Furthermore, we develop an algorithm for adversarial training with time cost $o(m n d)$ per iteration by applying half-space reporting data structure. | Yeqi Gao, Lianke Qin, Zhao Song, Yitan Wang |  |

The _Laplacian representation_ is a promising approach to address these problems by inducing informative state encoding and intrinsic rewards for temporally-extended action discovery and reward shaping. To obtain the Laplacian representation one needs to compute the eigensystem of the graph Laplacian, which is often approximated through optimization objectives compatible with deep learning approaches. These approximations, however, depend on hyperparameters that are impossible to tune efficiently, converge to arbitrary rotations of the desired eigenvectors, and are unable to accurately recover the corresponding eigenvalues. In this paper we introduce a theoretically sound objective and corresponding optimization algorithm for approximating the Laplacian representation. Our approach naturally recovers both the true eigenvectors and eigenvalues while eliminating the hyperparameter dependence of previous approximations. We provide theoretical guarantees for our method and we show that those results translate empirically into robust learning across multiple environments. | Diego Gomez, Michael Bowling, Marlos C.

Our approach uses an iterative algorithm to decompose each pretrained matrix into a high-precision low-rank component and a memory-efficient quantized component. During finetuning, the quantized component remains fixed and only the low-rank component is updated. We present an integer linear programming formulation of the quantization component which enables dynamic configuration of quantization parameters (e.g., bit-width, block size) for each matrix given an overall target memory budget. We further explore a data-aware version of the algorithm which uses an approximation of the Fisher information matrix to weight the reconstruction objective during matrix decomposition. Experiments on finetuning RoBERTa and LLaMA-2 (7B and 70B) demonstrate that our low-rank plus quantized matrix decomposition approach (LQ-LoRA) outperforms strong QLoRA and GPTQ-LoRA baselines and enables aggressive quantization to sub-3 bits with only minor performance degradations. When finetuned on a language modeling calibration dataset, LQ-LoRA can also be used for model compression; in this setting our 2.75-bit LLaMA-2-70B model (which has 2.85 bits on average when including the low-rank components and requires 27GB of GPU memory) performs respectably compared to the 16-bit baseline. | Han Guo, Philip Greengard, Eric P.

Nevertheless, deep clustering for temporal graphs, which could capture crucial dynamic interaction information, has not been fully explored. It means that in many clustering-oriented real-world scenarios, temporal graphs can only be processed as static graphs. This not only causes the loss of dynamic information but also triggers huge computational consumption. To solve the problem, we propose a general framework for deep Temporal Graph Clustering called TGC, which introduces deep clustering techniques to suit the interaction sequence-based batch-processing pattern of temporal graphs. In addition, we discuss differences between temporal graph clustering and static graph clustering from several levels. To verify the superiority of the proposed framework TGC, we conduct extensive experiments. The experimental results show that temporal graph clustering enables more flexibility in finding a balance between time and space requirements, and our framework can effectively improve the performance of existing temporal graph learning methods.

However, current large vision-language foundation models (VLMs) fall short of such compositional abilities due to their \`\`bag-of-words" behaviors and inability to construct words that correctly represent visual entities and the relations among the entities. To this end, we propose CoVLM, which can guide the LLM to explicitly compose visual entities and relationships among the text and dynamically communicate with the vision encoder and detection network to achieve vision-language communicative decoding. Specifically, we first devise a set of novel communication tokens for the LLM, for dynamic communication between the visual detection system and the language system. A communication token is generated by the LLM following a visual entity or a relation, to inform the detection network to propose regions that are relevant to the sentence generated so far. The proposed regions-of-interests (ROIs) are then fed back into the LLM for better language generation contingent on the relevant regions. The LLM is thus able to compose the visual entities and relationships through the communication tokens. The vision-to-language and language-to-vision communication are iteratively performed until the entire sentence is generated. Our framework seamlessly bridges the gap between visual perception and LLMs and outperforms previous VLMs by a large margin on compositional reasoning benchmarks (e.g., ~20% in HICO-DET mAP, ~14% in Cola top-1 accuracy, and ~3% on ARO top-1 accuracy). We also achieve state-of-the-art performances on traditional vision-language tasks such as referring expression comprehension and visual question answering. | Junyan Li, Delin Chen, Yining Hong, Zhenfang Chen, Peihao Chen, Yikang Shen, Chuang Gan |  |

One of the most commonly used methods for such purposes is weighting. The performance of this class of methods usually depends on strong regularity conditions for the underlying model, which might not hold in practice. In this paper, we investigate weighting methods from a functional estimation perspective and argue that the weights needed for covariate balancing could differ from those needed for treatment effects estimation under low regularity conditions. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a new framework of weighting that directly targets the treatment effects estimation. Unlike existing methods, the resulting estimator for a treatment effect under this new framework is a simple kernel-based $U$-statistic after applying a data-driven transformation to the observed covariates. We characterize the theoretical properties of the new estimators of treatment effects under a nonparametric setting and show that they are able to work robustly under low regularity conditions. The new framework is also applied to several numerical examples to demonstrate its practical merits. | Ruoqi Yu, Shulei Wang |  |
| 1086 |  |  [Demystifying Linear MDPs and Novel Dynamics Aggregation Framework](https://openreview.net/forum?id=RDSj6S8WJe) |  | 0 | In this work, we prove that, in linear MDPs, the feature dimension $d$ is lower bounded by $S/U$ in order to aptly represent transition probabilities, where $S$ is the size of the state space and $U$ is the maximum size of directly reachable states. Hence, $d$ can still scale with $S$ depending on the direct reachability of the environment. To address this limitation of linear MDPs, we propose a novel structural aggregation framework based on dynamics, named as the \*dynamics aggregation\*. For this newly proposed framework, we design a provably efficient hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm in linear function approximation that leverages aggregated sub-structures. Our proposed algorithm exhibits statistical efficiency, achieving a regret of $\tilde{O} \big( d_{\psi}^{3/2} H^{3/2}\sqrt{ NT} \big)$, where $d_{\psi}$ represents the feature dimension of \*aggregated subMDPs\* and $N$ signifies the number of aggregated subMDPs. We establish that the condition $d_{\psi}^3 N \ll d^{3}$ is readily met in most real-world environments with hierarchical structures, enabling a substantial improvement in the regret bound compared to LSVI-UCB, which enjoys a regret of $\tilde{O}(d^{3/2} H^{3/2} \sqrt{ T})$. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first HRL algorithm with linear function approximation that offers provable guarantees. | Joongkyu Lee, Minhwan Oh |  |

Although recent diffusion-based models have achieved state-of-the-art FID scores, they tend to exhibit more pronounced misalignment compared to earlier transformer-based models. In this work, we propose the \*\*LA\*\*yout \*\*C\*\*onstraint diffusion mod\*\*E\*\*l (LACE), a unified model to handle a broad range of layout generation tasks, such as arranging elements with specified attributes and refining or completing a coarse layout design. The model is based on continuous diffusion models. Compared with existing methods that use discrete diffusion models, continuous state-space design can enable the incorporation of continuous aesthetic constraint functions in training more naturally. For conditional generation, we propose injecting layout conditions in the form of masks or gradient guidance during inference. Empirical results show that LACE produces high-quality layouts and outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines. We will release our source code and model checkpoints. | Jian Chen, Ruiyi Zhang, Yufan Zhou, Changyou Chen |  |

However, these methods presuppose that unlabeled target graphs belong to categories previously seen in the source domain. This assumption could not hold true for in-the-wild target graphs. In this paper, we delve deeper to explore a more realistic problem open-set graph domain adaptation. Our objective is to not only identify target graphs from new categories but also accurately classify remaining target graphs into their respective categories under domain shift and label scarcity. To solve this challenging problem, we introduce a new method named Dual Structured Exploration with Mixup (DREAM). DREAM incorporates a graph-level representation learning branch as well as a subgraph-enhanced branch, which jointly explores graph topological structures from both global and local viewpoints. To maximize the use of unlabeled target graphs, we train these two branches simultaneously using posterior regularization to enhance their inter-module consistency. To accommodate the open-set setting, we amalgamate dissimilar samples to generate virtual unknown samples belonging to novel classes. Moreover, to alleviate domain shift, we establish a k nearest neighbor-based graph-of-graphs and blend multiple neighbors of each sample to produce cross-domain virtual samples for inter-domain consistency learning. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed DREAM in comparison to various state-of-the-art approaches in different settings. | Nan Yin, Mengzhu Wang, Zhenghan Chen, Li Shen, Huan Xiong, Bin Gu, Xiao Luo |  |

Since the data is collected separately by each client and always remains decentralized, federated optimization preserves data privacy and allows for large-scale computing, which makes it a promising decentralized machine learning paradigm. Though it is often deployed for tasks that are online in nature, e.g., next-word prediction on keyboard apps, most works formulate it as an offline problem. The few exceptions that consider federated bandit optimization are limited to very simplistic function classes, e.g., linear, generalized linear, or non-parametric function class with bounded RKHS norm, which severely hinders its practical usage. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, named Fed-GO-UCB, for federated bandit optimization with generic non-linear objective function. Under some mild conditions, we rigorously prove that Fed-GO-UCB is able to achieve sub-linear rate for both cumulative regret and communication cost. At the heart of our theoretical analysis are distributed regression oracle and individual confidence set construction, which can be of independent interests. Empirical evaluations also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. | Chuanhao Li, Chong Liu, YuXiang Wang |  |

To determine the optimal hyperparameters, an automatic, robust, and reliable evaluation benchmark is essential. However, establishing such a benchmark is not a trivial task due to the challenges associated with evaluation accuracy and privacy protection. In response to these challenges, we introduce a judge large language model, named PandaLM, which is trained to distinguish the superior model given several LLMs. PandaLM's focus extends beyond just the objective correctness of responses, which is the main focus of traditional evaluation datasets. It addresses vital subjective factors such as relative conciseness, clarity, adherence to instructions, comprehensiveness, and formality. To ensure the reliability of PandaLM, we collect a diverse human-annotated test dataset, where all contexts are generated by humans and labels are aligned with human preferences. Our findings reveal that PandaLM-7B offers a performance comparable to both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Impressively, PandaLM-70B surpasses their performance. PandaLM enables the evaluation of LLM to be fairer but with less cost, evidenced by significant improvements achieved by models tuned through PandaLM compared to their counterparts trained with default Alpaca's hyperparameters. In addition, PandaLM does not depend on API-based evaluations, thus avoiding potential data leakage. | Yidong Wang, Zhuohao Yu, Wenjin Yao, Zhengran Zeng, Linyi Yang, Cunxiang Wang, Hao Chen, Chaoya Jiang, Rui Xie, Jindong Wang, Xing Xie, Wei Ye, Shikun Zhang, Yue Zhang |  |

However, these efforts tend to overlook the visual richness of open worlds, rendering the entire interactive process akin to \`\`a blindfolded text-based game.'' Consequently, LLM-based agents frequently encounter challenges in intuitively comprehending their surroundings and producing responses that are easy to understand. In this paper, we propose Steve-Eye, an end-to-end trained large multimodal model to address this limitation. Steve-Eye integrates the LLM with a visual encoder to process visual-text inputs and generate multimodal feedback. We adopt a semi-automatic strategy to collect an extensive dataset comprising 850K open-world instruction pairs, enabling our model to encompass three essential functions for an agent: multimodal perception, foundational knowledge base, and skill prediction and planning. Lastly, we develop three open-world evaluation benchmarks and carry out experiments from a wide range of perspectives to validate our model's capability to strategically act and plan.

In this paper, we study how the asynchronous delay affects the convergence of asynchronous federated learning under non-i.i.d. distributed data across clients. Through the theoretical convergence analysis of one representative asynchronous federated learning algorithm under standard nonconvex stochastic settings, we show that the asynchronous delay can largely slow down the convergence, especially with high data heterogeneity. To further improve the convergence of asynchronous federated learning under heterogeneous data distributions, we propose a novel asynchronous federated learning method with a cached update calibration. Specifically, we let the server cache the latest update for each client and reuse these variables for calibrating the global update at each round. We theoretically prove the convergence acceleration for our proposed method under nonconvex stochastic settings. Extensive experiments on several vision and language tasks demonstrate our superior performances compared to other asynchronous federated learning baselines. | Yujia Wang, Yuanpu Cao, Jingcheng Wu, Ruoyu Chen, Jinghui Chen |  |

Self-supervised learning (SSL) emerges as a promising approach, which leverages inherent patterns within data through diverse augmentations to train models without explicit labels. However, while SSL has shown notable advancements in accuracy, its high computation costs remain a daunting impediment, particularly for resource-constrained platforms. To address this problem, we introduce SimWnW, a similarity-based efficient self-supervised learning framework. By strategically removing less important regions in augmented images and feature maps, SimWnW not only reduces computation costs but also eliminates irrelevant features that might slow down the learning process, thereby accelerating model convergence. The experimental results show that SimWnW effectively reduces the amount of computation costs in self-supervised model training without compromising accuracy. Specifically, SimWnW yields up to 54\% and 51\% computation savings in training from scratch and transfer learning tasks, respectively. | Sheng Li, Chao Wu, Ao Li, Yanzhi Wang, Xulong Tang, Geng Yuan |  |

However, manually creating such instruction data is very time-consuming and labor-intensive. Moreover, humans may struggle to produce high-complexity instructions. In this paper, we show an avenue for creating large amounts of instruction data with varying levels of complexity using LLM instead of humans. Starting with an initial set of instructions, we use our proposed Evol-Instruct to rewrite them step by step into more complex instructions. Then, we mix all generated instruction data to fine-tune LLaMA. We call the resulting model WizardLM. Both automatic and human evaluations consistently indicate that WizardLM outperforms baselines such as Alpaca (trained from Self-Instruct) and Vicuna (trained from human-created instructions). The experimental results demonstrate that the quality of instruction-following dataset crafted by Evol-Instruct can significantly improve the performance of LLMs. | Can Xu, Qingfeng Sun, Kai Zheng, Xiubo Geng, Pu Zhao, Jiazhan Feng, Chongyang Tao, Qingwei Lin, Daxin Jiang |  |

However, most existing open-vocabulary detectors learn by aligning region embeddings with categorical labels (e.g., bicycle) only, disregarding the capability of VLMs on aligning visual embeddings with fine-grained text descriptions of object parts (e.g., pedals and bells). This paper presents DVDet, a Descriptor-Enhanced Open Vocabulary Detector that introduces conditional context prompts and hierarchical textual descriptors that enable precise region-text alignment as well as open-vocabulary detection training in general. Specifically, the conditional context prompt transforms regional embeddings into image-like representations that can be directly integrated into general open vocabulary detection training. In addition, we introduce large language models as an interactive and implicit knowledge repository which enables iterative mining and refining visually oriented textual descriptors for precise region-text alignment. Extensive experiments over multiple large-scale benchmarks show that DVDet outperforms the state-of-the-art consistently by large margins. | Sheng Jin, Xueying Jiang, Jiaxing Huang, Lewei Lu, Shijian Lu |  |

Moreover, the limited availability of data from a single subject has a constraining impact on model performance. Although prior multi-subject decoding methods have made significant progress, they still suffer from several limitations, including difficulty in extracting global neural response features, linear scaling of model parameters with the number of subjects, and inadequate characterization of the relationship between neural responses of different subjects to various stimuli. To overcome these limitations, we propose a CLIP-guided Multi-sUbject visual neural information SEmantic Decoding (CLIP-MUSED) method. Our method consists of a Transformer-based feature extractor to effectively model global neural representations. It also incorporates learnable subject-specific tokens that facilitates the aggregation of multi-subject data without a linear increase of parameters. Additionally, we employ representational similarity analysis (RSA) to guide token representation learning based on the topological relationship of visual stimuli in the representation space of CLIP, enabling full characterization of the relationship between neural responses of different subjects under different stimuli. Finally, token representations are used for multi-subject semantic decoding. Our proposed method outperforms single-subject decoding methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance among the existing multi-subject methods on two fMRI datasets. Visualization results provide insights into the effectiveness of our proposed method.

However, the inference process of diffusion model can be slow, which hinders its usage in RL with iterative sampling. We propose to apply the consistency model as an efficient yet expressive policy representation, namely consistency policy, with an actor-critic style algorithm for three typical RL settings: offline, offline-to-online and online. For offline RL, we demonstrate the expressiveness of generative models as policies from multi-modal data. For offline-to-online RL, the consistency policy is shown to be more computational efficient than diffusion policy, with a comparable performance. For online RL, the consistency policy demonstrates significant speedup and even higher average performances than the diffusion policy. | Zihan Ding, Chi Jin |  |

Typically RLHF algorithms operate in two phases: first, use human preferences to learn a reward function and second, align the model by optimizing the learned reward via reinforcement learning (RL). This paradigm assumes that human preferences are distributed according to reward, but recent work suggests that they instead follow the \emph{regret} under the user's optimal policy. Thus, learning a reward function from feedback is not only based on a flawed assumption of human preference, but also leads to unwieldy optimization challenges that stem from policy gradients or bootstrapping in the RL phase. Because of these optimization challenges, contemporary RLHF methods restrict themselves to contextual bandit settings (e.g., as in large language models) or limit observation dimensionality (e.g., state-based robotics). We overcome these limitations by introducing a new family of algorithms for optimizing behavior from human feedback using the \textit{regret}-based model of human preferences. Using the principle of maximum entropy, we derive \fullname (\abv), an algorithm for learning optimal policies from preferences without learning reward functions, circumventing the need for RL. \abv is fully off-policy, uses only a simple contrastive objective, and can be applied to arbitrary MDPs.

A key component of these models is to learn the score function through score matching. Despite empirical success on various tasks, it remains unclear whether gradient-based algorithms can learn the score function with a provable accuracy. As a first step toward answering this question, this paper establishes a mathematical framework for analyzing score estimation using neural networks trained by gradient descent. Our analysis covers both the optimization and the generalization aspects of the learning procedure. In particular, we propose a parametric form to formulate the denoising score-matching problem as a regression with noisy labels. Compared to the standard supervised learning setup, the score-matching problem introduces distinct challenges, including unbounded input, vector-valued output, and an additional time variable, preventing existing techniques from being applied directly. In this paper, we show that with proper designs, the evolution of neural networks during training can be accurately modeled by a series of kernel regression tasks. Furthermore, by applying an early-stopping rule for gradient descent and leveraging recent developments in neural tangent kernels, we establish the first generalization error (sample complexity) bounds for learning the score function with neural networks, despite the presence of noise in the observations. Our analysis is grounded in a novel parametric form of the neural network and an innovative connection between score matching and regression analysis, facilitating the application of advanced statistical and optimization techniques. | Yinbin Han, Meisam Razaviyayn, Renyuan Xu |  |

While no model can work when data evolves in an arbitrary fashion, if there is some pattern to these changes, we might be able to design methods to address it. This paper addresses situations when data evolves gradually. We introduce a time-varying propensity score that can detect gradual shifts in the distribution of data which allows us to selectively sample past data to update the model---not just similar data from the past like that of a standard propensity score but also data that evolved in a similar fashion in the past. The time-varying propensity score is quite general: we demonstrate different ways of implementing it and evaluate it on a variety of problems ranging from supervised learning (e.g., image classification problems) where data undergoes a sequence of gradual shifts, to reinforcement learning tasks (e.g., robotic manipulation and continuous control) where data shifts as the policy or the task changes. | Rasool Fakoor, Jonas Mueller, Zachary Chase Lipton, Pratik Chaudhari, Alex Smola |  |

Existing works to address fairness issues in transformers require sensitive labels (such as age, gender, etc.), which can raise privacy concerns or violate legal regulations. An alternative way is through fairness without demographics. However, existing works that improve Rawlsian Max-Min fairness may impose overly restrictive constraints. Other methods that use auxiliary networks could be parameter inefficient. In this paper, we present a new approach to debiasing transformers by leveraging their inherent structure. By reconsidering the roles of important components (queries, keys, and values) in the attention mechanism, we introduce a simple yet effective debiasing strategy from two perspectives: 1) Grounded in theoretical analysis, we normalize and apply absolute value operations to queries and keys to minimize the bias in attention weight allocation; 2) We reduce the bias within values through local alignment via contrastive learning. Throughout the entire process, our approach does not require any sensitive labels. Furthermore, to enhance memory efficiency in the training phase, we propose a strategy that debias only the last encoder to improve fairness in pre-trained models. We conduct experiments in computer vision and natural language processing tasks and show that our method is comparable and even outperforms the state-of-the-art method with substantially lower energy consumption. | Shenyu Lu, Yipei Wang, Xiaoqian Wang |  |

Existing approaches require either expensive retrieval-specific modifications to LM pre-training or use post-hoc integration of the data store that leads to suboptimal performance. We introduce Retrieval-Augmented Dual Instruction Tuning (RA-DIT), a lightweight fine-tuning methodology that provides a third option by retrofitting any LLM with retrieval capabilities. Our approach operates in two distinct fine-tuning steps: (1) one updates a pre-trained LM to better use retrieved information, while (2) the other updates the retriever to return more relevant results, as preferred by the LM. By fine-tuning over tasks that require both knowledge utilization and contextual awareness, we demonstrate that each stage yields significant performance improvements, and using both leads to additional gains. Our best model, RA-DIT 65B, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of knowledge-intensive zero- and few-shot learning benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing in-context RALM approaches by up to +8.9% in 0-shot setting and +1.4% in 5-shot setting on average. | Xi Victoria Lin, Xilun Chen, Mingda Chen, Weijia Shi, Maria Lomeli, Richard James, Pedro Rodriguez, Jacob Kahn, Gergely Szilvasy, Mike Lewis, Luke Zettlemoyer, Wentau Yih |  |

Without explicit group annotations, proposed solutions rely on heuristics that aim to identify and then amplify the minority samples during training. In our work, we first uncover a critical shortcoming of these methods: an inability to distinguish legitimate minority samples from poison samples in the training set. By amplifying poison samples as well, group robustness methods inadvertently boost the success rate of an adversary---e.g., from 0\% without amplification to over 97\% with it. Notably, we supplement our empirical evidence with an impossibility result proving this inability of a standard heuristic under some assumptions. Moreover, scrutinizing recent poisoning defenses both in centralized and federated learning, we observe that they rely on similar heuristics to identify which samples should be eliminated as poisons. In consequence, minority samples are eliminated along with poisons, which damages group robustness---e.g., from 55\% without the removal of the minority samples to 41\% with it. Finally, as they pursue opposing goals using similar heuristics, our attempt to alleviate the trade-off by combining group robustness methods and poisoning defenses falls short. By exposing this tension, we also hope to highlight how benchmark-driven ML scholarship can obscure the trade-offs among different metrics with potentially detrimental consequences. | MichaelAndrei PanaitescuLiess, Yigitcan Kaya, Sicheng Zhu, Furong Huang, Tudor Dumitras |  |

Here, we introduce the novel task of Visual Data-Type Identification, a basic perceptual skill with implications for data curation (e.g., noisy data-removal from large datasets, domains pecific retrieval) and autonomous vision (e.g., distinguishing changing weather conditions from camera lens staining). We develop two datasets consisting of animal images altered across a diverse set of 27 visual data-types, spanning four broad categories. An extensive zero-shot evaluation of 39 VLMs, ranging from 100M to 80B parameters, shows a nuanced performance landscape. While VLMs are reasonably good at identifying certain stylistic data-types, such as cartoons and sketches, they struggle with simpler data-types arising from basic manipulations like image rotations or additive noise. Our findings reveal that (i) model scaling alone yields marginal gains for contrastively-trained models like CLIP, and (ii) there is a pronounced drop in performance for the largest auto-regressively trained VLMs like OpenFlamingo. This finding points to a blind spot in current frontier VLMs: they excel in recognizing semantic content but fail to acquire an understanding of visual data-types through scaling. By analyzing the pre-training distributions of these models and incorporating data-type information into the captions during fine-tuning, we achieve a significant enhancement in performance. By exploring this previously uncharted task, we aim to set the stage for further advancing VLMs to equip them with visual data-type understanding. | Vishaal Udandarao, Max F.

Most existing methods devote the referring head to localize the referred object directly, causing failure in complex scenarios. In addition, it does not illustrate how and why the network reaches the final decision. In this paper, we address this question “Can we design an interpretable 3D visual grounding framework that has the potential to mimic the human perception system?”. To this end, we formulate the 3D visual grounding problem as a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) task by first predicting a chain of anchors and then the final target. Interpretability not only improves the overall performance but also helps us identify failure cases. Following the chain of thoughts approach enables us to decompose the referring task into interpretable intermediate steps, boosting the performance and making our framework extremely data-efficient. Moreover, our proposed framework can be easily integrated into any existing architecture. We validate our approach through comprehensive experiments on the Nr3D, Sr3D, and Scanrefer benchmarks and show consistent performance gains compared to existing methods without requiring manually annotated data. Furthermore, our proposed framework, dubbed CoT3DRef, is significantly data-efficient, whereas on the Sr3D dataset, when trained only on 10% of the data, we match the SOTA performance that trained on the entire data.

| 1106 |  |  [An Efficient Tester-Learner for Halfspaces](https://openreview.net/forum?id=z6n1fKMMC1) |  | 0 | We give the first efficient algorithm for learning halfspaces in the testable learning model recently defined by Rubinfeld and Vasilyan [2022]. In this model, a learner certifies that the accuracy of its output hypothesis is near optimal whenever the training set passes an associated test, and training sets drawn from some target distribution must pass the test. This model is more challenging than distribution-specific agnostic or Massart noise models where the learner is allowed to fail arbitrarily if the distributional assumption does not hold. We consider the setting where the target distribution is the standard Gaussian in $d$ dimensions and the label noise is either Massart or adversarial (agnostic). For Massart noise, our tester-learner runs in polynomial time and outputs a hypothesis with (information-theoretically optimal) error $\mathrm{opt}+\epsilon$ (and extends to any fixed strongly log-concave target distribution). For adversarial noise, our tester-learner obtains error $O(\mathrm{opt})+\epsilon$ in polynomial time. Prior work on testable learning ignores the labels in the training set and checks that the empirical moments of the covariates are close to the moments of the base distribution. Here we develop new tests of independent interest that make critical use of the labels and combine them with the moment-matching approach of Gollakota et al. [2022]. This enables us to implement a testable variant of the algorithm of Diakonikolas et al. [2020a, 2020b] for learning noisy halfspaces using nonconvex SGD. | Aravind Gollakota, Adam R.

These systems induce a latent space while optimizing losses such as the behavior loss, which aim to achieve locality in program behavior, meaning that vectors close in the latent space should correspond to similarly behaving programs. In this paper, we show that the programmatic space, induced by the domain-specific language and requiring no training, presents values for the behavior loss similar to those observed in latent spaces presented in previous work. Moreover, algorithms searching in the programmatic space significantly outperform those in LEAPS and HPRL. To explain our results, we measured the "friendliness" of the two spaces to local search algorithms. We discovered that algorithms are more likely to stop at local maxima when searching in the latent space than when searching in the programmatic space. This implies that the optimization topology of the programmatic space, induced by the reward function in conjunction with the neighborhood function, is more conducive to search than that of the latent space. This result provides an explanation for the superior performance in the programmatic space. | Tales Henrique Carvalho, Kenneth Tjhia, Levi Lelis |  |

Our key insight is to use co-located internet imagery taken on the ground as an intermediary for connecting remote-sensing images and language. Specifically, we train an image encoder for remote sensing images to align with the image encoder of CLIP using a large amount of paired internet and satellite images. Our unsupervised approach enables the training of a first-of-its-kind large scale VLM for remote sensing images at two different resolutions. We show that these VLMs enable zero-shot, open-vocabulary image classification, retrieval, segmentation and visual question answering for satellite images. On each of these tasks, our VLM trained without textual annotations outperforms existing VLMs trained with supervision, with gains of up to 20\% for classification and 80\% for segmentation. | Utkarsh Mall, Cheng Perng Phoo, Meilin Kelsey Liu, Carl Vondrick, Bharath Hariharan, Kavita Bala |  |

The certified radius in this context is a crucial indicator of the robustness of models. However how to design an efficient classifier with an associated certified radius? Randomized smoothing provides a promising framework by relying on noise injection into the inputs to obtain a smoothed and robust classifier. In this paper, we first show that the variance introduced by the Monte-Carlo sampling in the randomized smoothing procedure estimate closely interacts with two other important properties of the classifier, \textit{i.e.} its Lipschitz constant and margin. More precisely, our work emphasizes the dual impact of the Lipschitz constant of the base classifier, on both the smoothed classifier and the empirical variance. To increase the certified robust radius, we introduce a different way to convert logits to probability vectors for the base classifier to leverage the variance-margin trade-off. We leverage the use of Bernstein's concentration inequality along with enhanced Lipschitz bounds for randomized smoothing. Experimental results show a significant improvement in certified accuracy compared to current state-of-the-art methods. Our novel certification procedure allows us to use pre-trained models with randomized smoothing, effectively improving the current certification radius in a zero-shot manner. | Blaise Delattre, Alexandre Araujo, Quentin Barthélemy, Alexandre Allauzen |  |

Nevertheless, these objectives, measured as global averages, have raised concerns about persistent local disparities between sensitive groups. In this work, we address the problem of local fairness, which ensures that the predictor is unbiased not only in terms of expectations over the whole population, but also within any subregion of the feature space, unknown at training time. To enforce this objective, we introduce ROAD, a novel approach that leverages the Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) framework within a fair adversarial learning objective, where an adversary tries to infer the sensitive attribute from the predictions. Using an instance-level re-weighting strategy, ROAD is designed to prioritize inputs that are likely to be locally unfair, i.e. where the adversary faces the least difficulty in reconstructing the sensitive attribute. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method: it achieves Pareto dominance with respect to local fairness and accuracy for a given global fairness level across three standard datasets, and also enhances fairness generalization under distribution shift. | Vincent Grari, Thibault Laugel, Tatsunori Hashimoto, Sylvain Lamprier, Marcin Detyniecki |  |

Our framework, planning abstraction from language (PARL), utilizes language-annotated demonstrations to automatically discover a symbolic and abstract action space and induce a latent state abstraction based on it. PARL consists of three stages: 1) recovering object-level and action concepts, 2) learning state abstractions, abstract action feasibility, and transition models, and 3) applying low-level policies for abstract actions. During inference, given the task description, PARL first makes abstract action plans using the latent transition and feasibility functions, then refines the high-level plan using low-level policies. PARL generalizes across scenarios involving novel object instances and environments, unseen concept compositions, and tasks that require longer planning horizons than settings it is trained on. | Weiyu Liu, Geng Chen, Joy Hsu, Jiayuan Mao, Jiajun Wu |  |

However, prior work 1) suggests that useful self-rationalization is emergent only at significant scales (e.g., 175B parameter GPT-3); and 2) focuses largely on downstream performance, ignoring the semantics of the rationales themselves, e.g., are they faithful, true, and helpful for humans? In this work, we enable small-scale LMs (∼200x smaller than GPT-3) to generate rationales that not only improve downstream task performance, but are also more plausible, consistent, and diverse, assessed both by automatic and human evaluation. Our method, MaRio (Multi-rewArd RatIOnalization), is a multi-reward conditioned self-rationalization algorithm that optimizes multiple distinct properties like plausibility, diversity and consistency. Results on three difficult question-answering datasets StrategyQA, QuaRel and OpenBookQA show that not only does MaRio improve task accuracy, but it also improves the self-rationalization quality of small LMs across the aforementioned axes better than a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) baseline. Extensive human evaluations confirm that MaRio rationales are preferred vs. SFT rationales, as well as qualitative improvements in plausibility and consistency. | Sahana Ramnath, Brihi Joshi, Skyler Hallinan, Ximing Lu, Liunian Harold Li, Aaron Chan, Jack Hessel, Yejin Choi, Xiang Ren |  |

While previous research either presupposes a cost-free communication channel or relies on a centralized controller with shared observations, we harness the commonsense knowledge, reasoning ability, language comprehension, and text generation prowess of LLMs and seamlessly incorporate them into a cognitive-inspired modular framework that integrates with perception, memory, and execution. Thus building a Cooperative Embodied Language Agent CoELA, who can plan, communicate, and cooperate with others to accomplish long-horizon tasks efficiently. Our experiments on C-WAH and TDW-MAT demonstrate that CoELA driven by GPT-4 can surpass strong planning-based methods and exhibit emergent effective communication. Though current Open LMs like LLAMA-2 still underperform, we fine-tune a CoELA with data collected with our agents and show how they can achieve promising performance. We also conducted a user study for human-agent interaction and discovered that CoELA communicating in natural language can earn more trust and cooperate more effectively with humans. Our research underscores the potential of LLMs for future research in multi-agent cooperation.

Hyperbolic spaces, where neighborhoods grow exponentially, offer substantial advantages and have consistently delivered state-of-the-art results across diverse applications. However, hyperbolic classifiers often grapple with computational challenges. Methods reliant on Riemannian optimization frequently exhibit sluggishness, stemming from the increased computational demands of operations on Riemannian manifolds. In response to these challenges, we present HyperDT, a novel extension of decision tree algorithms into hyperbolic space. Crucially, HyperDT eliminates the need for computationally intensive Riemannian optimization, numerically unstable exponential and logarithmic maps, or pairwise comparisons between points by leveraging inner products to adapt Euclidean decision tree algorithms to hyperbolic space. Our approach is conceptually straightforward and maintains constant-time decision complexity while mitigating the scalability issues inherent in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces. Building upon HyperDT, we introduce HyperRF, a hyperbolic random forest model. Extensive benchmarking across diverse datasets underscores the superior performance of these models, providing a swift, precise, accurate, and user-friendly toolkit for hyperbolic data analysis. | Philippe Chlenski, Ethan Turok, Antonio Khalil Moretti, Itsik Pe'er |  |

Given a dataset of size $M$, our algorithm ensures $(\alpha,\alpha\rho^2/2)$-Renyi differential privacy and finds a $(\delta,\epsilon)$-stationary point so long as $M=\tilde\Omega(\frac{d}{\delta\epsilon^3} + \frac{d^{3/2}}{\rho\delta\epsilon^2})$. This matches the optimal complexity found in its non-private zeroth-order analog. Notably, although the objective is not smooth, we have privacy \`\`for free'' when $\rho \ge \sqrt{d}\epsilon$. | Qinzi Zhang, Hoang Tran, Ashok Cutkosky |  |

Adam and its variants have been state-of-the-art for years, and more sophisticated second-order (Hessian-based) optimizers often incur too much per-step overhead. In this paper, we propose Sophia, a simple scalable second-order optimizer that uses a light-weight estimate of the diagonal Hessian as the pre-conditioner. The update is the moving average of the gradients divided by the moving average of the estimated Hessian, followed by element-wise clipping. The clipping controls the worst-case update size and tames the negative impact of non-convexity and rapid change of Hessian along the trajectory. Sophia only estimates the diagonal Hessian every handful of iterations, which has negligible average per-step time and memory overhead. On language modeling with GPT models of sizes ranging from 125M to 1.5B, Sophia achieves a 2x speed-up compared to Adam in the number of steps, total compute, and wall-clock time, achieving the same perplexity with 50\% fewer steps, less total compute, and reduced wall-clock time. | Hong Liu, Zhiyuan Li, David Leo Wright Hall, Percy Liang, Tengyu Ma |  |

However, existing works mainly focus on investigating the capabilities of conversational LLMs on chemical reactions and retrosynthesis. While drug editing, a critical task in the drug discovery pipeline, remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose ChatDrug, a framework to facilitate the systematic investigation of drug editing using LLMs. ChatDrug jointly leverages a prompt module, a retrieval and domain feedback module, and a conversation module to streamline effective drug editing. We empirically show that ChatDrug reaches the best performance on all 39 drug editing tasks, encompassing small molecules, peptides, and proteins. We further demonstrate, through 10 case studies, that ChatDrug can successfully identify the key substructures for manipulation, generating diverse and valid suggestions for drug editing. Promisingly, we also show that ChatDrug can offer insightful explanations from a domain-specific perspective, enhancing interpretability and enabling informed decision-making. | Shengchao Liu, Jiongxiao Wang, Yijin Yang, Chengpeng Wang, Ling Liu, Hongyu Guo, Chaowei Xiao |  |

Views can be generated (e.g. by augmentations) or be observed. We investigate matching when there are more than two related views which we call poly-view tasks, and derive new representation learning objectives using information maximization and sufficient statistics. We show that with unlimited computation, one should maximize the number of related views, and with a fixed compute budget, it is beneficial to decrease the number of unique samples whilst increasing the number of views of those samples. In particular, poly-view contrastive models trained for 128 epochs with batch size 256 outperform SimCLR trained for 1024 epochs at batch size 4096 on ImageNet1k, challenging the belief that contrastive models require large batch sizes and many training epochs. | Amitis Shidani, R.

However, searching through the large, discrete space of module compositions is challenging, especially because evaluating a composition’s performance requires a round of neural network training. We address this challenge through a modular CL framework, PICLE, that uses a probabilistic model to cheaply compute the fitness of each composition, allowing PICLE to achieve both perceptual, few-shot and latent transfer. The model combines prior knowledge about good module compositions with dataset-specific information. We evaluate PICLE using two benchmark suites designed to assess different desiderata of CL techniques. Comparing to a wide range of approaches, we show that PICLE is the first modular CL algorithm to achieve perceptual, few-shot and latent transfer while scaling well to large search spaces, outperforming previous state-of-the-art modular CL approaches on long problem sequences. | Lazar Valkov, Akash Srivastava, Swarat Chaudhuri, Charles Sutton |  |

The retrieved action with its start and end locations can be used for highlight generation, temporal action detection, etc. Unfortunately, learning the exact boundary location of activities is highly challenging because temporal activities are continuous in time, and there are often no clear-cut transitions between actions. Moreover, the definition of the start and end of events is subjective, which may confuse the model. To alleviate the boundary ambiguity, we propose to study the video activity localization problem from a denoising perspective. Specifically, we propose an encoder-decoder model named DenosieLoc. During training, a set of temporal spans is randomly generated from the ground truth with a controlled noise scale. Then, we attempt to reverse this process by boundary denoising, allowing the localizer to predict activities with precise boundaries and resulting in faster convergence speed. Experiments show that DenosieLoc advances several video activity understanding tasks. For example, we observe a gain of +12.36% average mAP on the QV-Highlights dataset. Moreover, DenosieLoc achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MAD dataset but with much fewer predictions than others. | Mengmeng Xu, Mattia Soldan, Jialin Gao, Shuming Liu, JuanManuel PérezRúa, Bernard Ghanem |  |

For example, such models could be used for plagiarism, disinformation, spam, or phishing. However, such abuse may be counteracted with the ability to detect whether a piece of text was composed by a language model rather than a human. Some previous approaches to this problem have relied on supervised methods trained on corpora of confirmed human and machine-written documents. Unfortunately, model under-specification poses an unavoidable challenge for such detectors, making them brittle in the face of data shifts, such as the release of further language models producing still more fluent text than the models used to train the detectors. Other previous approaches require access to the models that generated the text to be detected at inference or detection time, which is often impractical. In light of these challenge, we pursue a fundamentally different approach not relying on samples from language models of concern at training time. Instead, we propose to leverage representations of writing style estimated from human-authored text. Indeed, we find that features effective at distinguishing among human authors are also effective at distinguishing human from machine authors, including state of the art large language models like Llama 2, ChatGPT, and GPT-4. Furthermore, given handfuls of examples composed by each of several specific language models of interest, our approach affords the ability to predict which model specifically generated a given document. | Rafael A.

Protecting the intellectual property (IP) and commercial ownership of a deep model is challenging yet increasingly crucial. A major stream of watermarking strategies implants verifiable backdoor triggers by poisoning training samples, but these are often unrealistic due to data privacy and safety concerns and are vulnerable to minor model changes such as fine-tuning. To overcome these challenges, we propose a safe and robust backdoor-based watermark injection technique that leverages the diverse knowledge from a single out-of-distribution (OoD) image, which serves as a secret key for IP verification. The independence of training data makes it agnostic to third-party promises of IP security. We induce robustness via random perturbation of model parameters during watermark injection to defend against common watermark removal attacks, including fine-tuning, pruning, and model extraction. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed watermarking approach is not only time- and sample-efficient without training data, but also robust against the watermark removal attacks above. | Shuyang Yu, Junyuan Hong, Haobo Zhang, Haotao Wang, Zhangyang Wang, Jiayu Zhou |  |

A promising approach involves employing a hyper-network to generate parameter shift, whereas existing hyper-networks suffer from inferior scalability in synchronous editing operation amount (Hase et al., 2023b; Huang et al., 2023). For instance, Mitchell et al. (2022) mimics gradient accumulation to sum the parameter shifts together, which lacks statistical significance and is prone to cancellation effect. To mitigate the problem, we propose the MAssive Language Model Editing Network (MALMEN), which formulates the parameter shift aggregation as the least square problem, subsequently updating the LM parameter using the normal equation. To accommodate editing multiple facts simultaneously with limited memory budgets, we separate the computation on the hyper-network and LM, enabling arbitrary batch size on both neural networks. Our method is evaluated by editing up to thousands of facts on LMs with different architectures, i.e., BERT-base, GPT-2, and GPT-J (6B), across various knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, i.e., closed book fact-checking and question answering. Remarkably, MALMEN is capable of editing hundreds of times more facts than MEND (Mitchell et al., 2022) with the identical hyper-network architecture and outperforms editor specifically designed for GPT, i.e., MEMIT (Meng et al., 2023). | Chenmien Tan, Ge Zhang, Jie Fu |  |
| 1124 |  |  [BrainLM: A foundation model for brain activity recordings](https://openreview.net/forum?id=RwI7ZEfR27) |  | 0 | We introduce the Brain Language Model (BrainLM), a foundation model for brain activity dynamics trained on 6,700 hours of fMRI recordings. Utilizing self-supervised masked-prediction training, BrainLM demonstrates proficiency in both fine-tuning and zero-shot inference tasks. Fine-tuning allows for the accurate prediction of clinical variables like age, anxiety, and PTSD as well as forecasting of future brain states. Critically, the model generalizes well to entirely new external cohorts not seen during training. In zero-shot inference mode, BrainLM can identify intrinsic functional networks directly from raw fMRI data without any network-based supervision during training. The model also generates interpretable latent representations that reveal relationships between brain activity patterns and cognitive states. Overall, BrainLM offers a versatile and interpretable framework for elucidating the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of human brain activity. It serves as a powerful "lens" through which massive repositories of fMRI data can be analyzed in new ways, enabling more effective interpretation and utilization at scale. The work demonstrates the potential of foundation models to advance computational neuroscience research. | Josue Ortega Caro, Antonio Henrique de Oliveira Fonseca, Syed Asad Rizvi, Matteo Rosati, Christopher L.

| 1125 |  |  [Data Distillation Can Be Like Vodka: Distilling More Times For Better Quality](https://openreview.net/forum?id=1NHgmKqOzZ) |  | 0 | Dataset distillation aims to minimize the time and memory needed for training deep networks on large datasets, by creating a small set of synthetic images that has a similar generalization performance to that of the full dataset. However, current dataset distillation techniques fall short, showing a notable performance gap compared to training on the original data. In this work, we are the first to argue that the use of only one synthetic subset for distillation may not yield optimal generalization performance. This is because the training dynamics of deep networks drastically changes during training. Therefore, multiple synthetic subsets are required to capture the dynamics of training in different stages. To address this issue, we propose Progressive Dataset Distillation (PDD). PDD synthesizes multiple small sets of synthetic images, each conditioned on the previous sets, and trains the model on the cumulative union of these subsets without requiring additional training time. Our extensive experiments show that PDD can effectively improve the performance of existing dataset distillation methods by up to 4.3%. In addition, our method for the first time enables generating considerably larger synthetic datasets.

| 1126 |  |  [Object centric architectures enable efficient causal representation learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=r9FsiXZxZt) |  | 0 | Causal representation learning has showed a variety of settings in which we can disentangle latent variables with identifiability guarantees (up to some reasonable equivalence class). Common to all of these approaches is the assumption that (1) the latent variables are represented as $d$-dimensional vectors, and (2) that the observations are the output of some injective generative function of these latent variables. While these assumptions appear benign, we show that when the observations are of multiple objects, the generative function is no longer injective and disentanglement fails in practice. We can address this failure by combining recent developments in object-centric learning and causal representation learning. By modifying the Slot Attention architecture (Locatello et al., 2020), we develop an object-centric architecture that leverages weak supervision from sparse perturbations to disentangle each object's properties. This approach is more data-efficient in the sense that it requires significantly fewer perturbations than a comparable approach that encodes to a Euclidean space and we show that this approach successfully disentangles the properties of a set of objects in a series of simple image-based disentanglement experiments. | Amin Mansouri, Jason S.

| 1127 |  |  [Efficient Score Matching with Deep Equilibrium Layers](https://openreview.net/forum?id=J1djqLAa6N) |  | 0 | Score matching methods -- estimate probability densities without computing the normalization constant -- are particularly useful in deep learning. However, computational and memory costs of score matching methods can be prohibitive for high-dimensional data or complex models, particularly due to the derivatives or Hessians of the log density function appearing in the objective function. Some existing approaches modify the objective function to reduce the quadratic computational complexity for Hessian computation. However, the memory bottleneck of score matching methods remains for deep learning. This study improves the memory efficiency of score matching by leveraging deep equilibrium models. We provide a theoretical analysis of deep equilibrium models for scoring matching and applying implicit differentiation to higher-order derivatives. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach enables the development of deep and expressive models with improved performance and comparable computational and memory costs over shallow architectures. | Yuhao Huang, Qingsong Wang, Akwum Onwunta, Bao Wang |  |
| 1128 |  |  [Alt-Text with Context: Improving Accessibility for Images on Twitter](https://openreview.net/forum?id=97Dl82avFs) |  | 0 | In this work we present an approach for generating alternative text (or alt-text) descriptions for images shared on social media, specifically Twitter. More than just a special case of image captioning, alt-text is both more literally descriptive and context-specific. Also critically, images posted to Twitter are often accompanied by user-written text that despite not necessarily describing the image may provide useful context that if properly leveraged can be informative. We address this task with a multimodal model that conditions on both textual information from the associated social media post as well as visual signal from the image, and demonstrate that the utility of these two information sources stacks. We put forward a new dataset of 371k images paired with alt-text and tweets scraped from Twitter and evaluate on it across a variety of automated metrics as well as human evaluation. We show that our approach of conditioning on both tweet text and visual information significantly outperforms prior work, by more than 2x on BLEU@4. | Nikita Srivatsan, Sofía Samaniego, Omar Florez, Taylor BergKirkpatrick |  |
| 1129 |  |  [Defining Expertise: Applications to Treatment Effect Estimation](https://openreview.net/forum?id=1YPfmglNRU) |  | 0 | Decision-makers are often experts of their domain and take actions based on their domain knowledge. Doctors, for instance, may prescribe treatments by predicting the likely outcome of each available treatment. Actions of an expert thus naturally encode part of their domain knowledge, and can help make inferences within the same domain: Knowing doctors try to prescribe the best treatment for their patients, we can tell treatments prescribed more frequently are likely to be more effective. Yet in machine learning, the fact that most decision-makers are experts is often overlooked, and “expertise” is seldom leveraged as an inductive bias. This is especially true for the literature on treatment effect estimation, where often the only assumption made about actions is that of overlap. In this paper, we argue that expertise—particularly the type of expertise the decision-makers of a domain are likely to have—can be informative in designing and selecting methods for treatment effect estimation. We formally define two types of expertise, predictive and prognostic, and demonstrate empirically that: (i) the prominent type of expertise in a domain significantly influences the performance of different methods in treatment effect estimation, and (ii) it is possible to predict the type of expertise present in a dataset, which can provide a quantitative basis for model selection. | Alihan Hüyük, Qiyao Wei, Alicia Curth, Mihaela van der Schaar |  |
| 1130 |  |  [Alleviating Exposure Bias in Diffusion Models through Sampling with Shifted Time Steps](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ZSD3MloKe6) |  | 0 | Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPM) have shown remarkable efficacy in the synthesis of high-quality images. However, their inference process characteristically requires numerous, potentially hundreds, of iterative steps, which could exaggerate the problem of exposure bias due to the training and inference discrepancy. Previous work has attempted to mitigate this issue by perturbing inputs during training, which consequently mandates the retraining of the DPM. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of exposure bias in DPM and, intriguingly, we find that the exposure bias could be alleviated with a novel sampling method that we propose, without retraining the model. We empirically and theoretically show that, during inference, for each backward time step t and corresponding state ˆxt, there might exist another time step $t_s$ which exhibits superior coupling with $\hat{x}_t$. Based on this finding, we introduce a sampling method named Time-Shift Sampler. Our framework can be seamlessly integrated to existing sampling algorithms, such as DDPM, DDIM and other high-order solvers, inducing merely minimal additional computations. Experimental results show our method brings significant and consistent improvements in FID scores on different datasets and sampling methods. For example, integrating Time-Shift Sampler to F-PNDM yields a FID=3.88, achieving 44.49% improvements as compared to F-PNDM, on CIFAR-10 with 10 sampling steps, which is more performant than the vanilla DDIM with 100 sampling steps.

However, there is currently no theoretical result comparing the expressive power of $k$-hop invariant GNNs and equivariant GNNs. Additionally, little is understood about whether the performance of equivariant GNNs, employing steerable features up to type-$L$, increases as $L$ grows -- especially when the feature dimension is held constant. In this study, we introduce a key lemma that allows us to analyze steerable features by examining their corresponding invariant features. The lemma facilitates us in understanding the limitations of $k$-hop invariant GNNs, which fail to capture the global geometric structure due to the loss of geometric information between local structures. Furthermore, we investigate the invariant features associated with different types of steerable features and demonstrate that the expressiveness of steerable features is primarily determined by their dimension -- independent of their irreducible decomposition. This suggests that when the feature dimension is constant, increasing $L$ does not lead to essentially improved performance in equivariant GNNs employing steerable features up to type-$L$. We substantiate our theoretical insights with numerical evidence. | ShihHsin Wang, YungChang Hsu, Justin M. Baker, Andrea L. Bertozzi, Jack Xin, Bao Wang |  |

Previous dynamic scene reconstruction works either attempt to model the motion of 3D points in space, which constrains them to handle a single articulated object or require depth maps as input. By contrast, we propose to directly estimate the change of Signed Distance Function (SDF), namely SDF flow, of the dynamic scene. We show that the SDF flow captures the evolution of the scene surface. We further derive the mathematical relation between the SDF flow and the scene flow, which allows us to calculate the scene flow from the SDF flow analytically by solving linear equations. Our experiments on real-world multi-view video datasets show that our reconstructions are better than those of the state-of-the-art methods.

| 1133 |  |  [Class Probability Matching with Calibrated Networks for Label Shift Adaption](https://openreview.net/forum?id=mliQ2huFrZ) |  | 0 | We consider the domain adaptation problem in the context of label shift, where the label distributions between source and target domain differ, but the conditional distributions of features given the label are the same. To solve the label shift adaption problem, we develop a novel matching framework named \textit{class probability matching} (\textit{CPM}). It is inspired by a new understanding of the source domain's class probability, as well as a specific relationship between class probability ratios and feature probability ratios between the source and target domains. CPM is able to maintain the same theoretical guarantee with the existing feature probability matching framework, while significantly improving the computational efficiency due to directly matching the probabilities of the label variable. Within the CPM framework, we propose an algorithm named \textit{class probability matching with calibrated networks} (\textit{CPMCN}) for target domain classification. From the theoretical perspective, we establish the generalization bound of the CPMCN method in order to explain the benefits of introducing calibrated networks. From the experimental perspective, real data comparisons show that CPMCN outperforms existing matching-based and EM-based algorithms. | Hongwei Wen, Annika Betken, Hanyuan Hang |  |

In contrast to prior tactile simulators which primarily focus on manipulating rigid bodies and often rely on simplified approximations to model stress and deformations of materials in contact, DIFFTACTILE emphasizes physics-based contact modeling with high fidelity, supporting simulations of diverse contact modes and interactions with objects possessing a wide range of material properties. Our system incorporates several key components, including a Finite Element Method (FEM)-based soft body model for simulating the sensing elastomer, a multi-material simulator for modeling diverse object types (such as elastic, elastoplastic, cables) under manipulation, a penalty-based contact model for handling contact dynamics. The differentiable nature of our system facilitates gradient-based optimization for both 1) refining physical properties in simulation using real-world data, hence narrowing the sim-to-real gap and 2) efficient learning of tactile-assisted grasping and contact-rich manipulation skills. Additionally, we introduce a method to infer the optical response of our tactile sensor to contact using an efficient pixel-based neural module. We anticipate that DIFFTACTILE will serve as a useful platform for studying contact-rich manipulations, leveraging the benefits of dense tactile feedback and differentiable physics.

We show that the Jacobian-Vector Product resulting from linearization can be computed efficiently in a single forward pass, reducing training and inference cost to the same order of magnitude as its original non-linear counterpart, while using the same number of parameters. Furthermore, we show that, when applied to various downstream visual classification tasks, the resulting Tangent Transformer fine-tuned with TAFT can perform comparably with fine-tuning the original non-linear network. Since Tangent Transformers are linear with respect to the new set of weights, and the resulting fine-tuning loss is convex, we show that TAFT enjoys several advantages compared to non-linear fine-tuning when it comes to model composition, parallel training, machine unlearning, and differential privacy.

| 1136 |  |  [Bayes Conditional Distribution Estimation for Knowledge Distillation Based on Conditional Mutual Information](https://openreview.net/forum?id=yV6wwEbtkR) |  | 0 | It is believed that in knowledge distillation (KD), the role of the teacher is to provide an estimate for the unknown Bayes conditional probability distribution (BCPD) to be used in the student training process. Conventionally, this estimate is obtained by training the teacher using maximum log-likelihood (MLL) method. To improve this estimate for KD, in this paper we introduce the concept of conditional mutual information (CMI) into the estimation of BCPD and propose a novel estimator called the maximum CMI (MCMI) method. Specifically, in MCMI estimation, both the log-likelihood and CMI of the teacher are simultaneously maximized when the teacher is trained. In fact, maximizing the teacher's CMI value ensures that the teacher can effectively capture the contextual information within the images, and for visualizing this information, we deploy Eigen-CAM. Via conducting a thorough set of experiments, we show that by employing a teacher trained via MCMI estimation rather than one trained via MLL estimation in various state-of-the-art KD frameworks, the student's classification accuracy consistently increases, with the gain of up to 3.32\%. This suggests that the teacher's BCPD estimate provided by MCMI method is more accurate than that provided by MLL method. In addition, we show that such improvements in the student's accuracy are more drastic in zero-shot and few-shot settings. Notably, the student's accuracy increases with the gain of up to 5.72\% when 5\% of the training samples are available to student (few-shot), and increases from 0\% to as high as 84\% for an omitted class (zero-shot). | Linfeng Ye, Shayan Mohajer Hamidi, Renhao Tan, EnHui Yang |  |
| 1137 |  |  [Quantifying Language Models' Sensitivity to Spurious Features in Prompt Design or: How I learned to start worrying about prompt formatting](https://openreview.net/forum?id=RIu5lyNXjT) |  | 0 | As large language models (LLMs) are adopted as a fundamental component of language technologies, it is crucial to accurately characterize their performance. Because choices in prompt design can strongly influence model behavior, this design process is critical in effectively using any modern pre-trained generative language model. In this work, we focus on LLM sensitivity to a quintessential class of meaning-preserving design choices: prompt formatting. We find that several widely used open-source LLMs are extremely sensitive to subtle changes in prompt formatting in few-shot settings, with performance differences of up to 76 accuracy points when evaluated using LLaMA-2-13B. Sensitivity remains even when increasing model size, the number of few-shot examples, or performing instruction tuning. Our analysis suggests that work evaluating LLMs with prompting-based methods would benefit from reporting a range of performance across plausible prompt formats, instead of the currently-standard practice of reporting performance on a single format. We also show that format performance only weakly correlates between models, which puts into question the methodological validity of comparing models with an arbitrarily chosen, fixed prompt format. To facilitate systematic analysis we propose FormatSpread, an algorithm that rapidly evaluates a sampled set of plausible prompt formats for a given task, and reports the interval of expected performance without accessing model weights. Furthermore, we present a suite of analyses that characterize the nature of this sensitivity, including exploring the influence of particular atomic perturbations and the internal representation of particular formats. | Melanie Sclar, Yejin Choi, Yulia Tsvetkov, Alane Suhr |  |

While this has huge upsides, such as not requiring training data or custom architectures, how an input is presented to an LVLM can have a major impact on zero-shot model performance. In particular, inputs phrased in an underspecified way can result in incorrect answers due to factors like missing visual information, complex implicit reasoning, or linguistic ambiguity. Therefore, adding visually-grounded information to the input as a preemptive clarification should improve model performance by reducing underspecification, e.g., by localizing objects and disambiguating references. Similarly, in the VQA setting, changing the way questions are framed can make them easier for models to answer. To this end, we present \*\*Rep\*\*hrase, \*\*A\*\*ugment and \*\*Re\*\*ason (RepARe), a gradient-free framework that extracts salient details about the image using the underlying LVLM as a captioner and reasoner, in order to propose modifications to the original question. We then use the LVLM’s confidence over a generated answer as an unsupervised scoring function to select the rephrased question most likely to improve zero-shot performance. Focusing on three visual question answering tasks, we show that RepARe can result in a 3.85% (absolute) increase in zero-shot accuracy on VQAv2, 6.41%, and 7.94% points increase on A-OKVQA, and VizWiz respectively. Additionally, we find that using gold answers for oracle question candidate selection achieves a substantial gain in VQA accuracy by up to 14.41%. Through extensive analysis, we demonstrate that outputs from RepARe increase syntactic complexity, and effectively utilize vision-language interaction and the frozen LLM. | Archiki Prasad, Elias StengelEskin, Mohit Bansal |  |

Specifically, we focus on games with bandit feedback, where testing an equilibrium can result in substantial regret even when the gap to be tested is small, and the existence of multiple optimal solutions (equilibria) in stationary games poses extra challenges. To overcome these obstacles, we propose a versatile black-box approach applicable to a broad spectrum of problems, such as general-sum games, potential games, and Markov games, when equipped with appropriate learning and testing oracles for stationary environments. Our algorithms can achieve $\widetilde{O}\left(\Delta^{1/4}T^{3/4}\right)$ regret when the degree of nonstationarity, as measured by total variation $\Delta$, is known, and $\widetilde{O}\left(\Delta^{1/5}T^{4/5}\right)$ regret when $\Delta$ is unknown, where $T$ is the number of rounds. Meanwhile, our algorithm inherits the favorable dependence on number of agents from the oracles. As a side contribution that may be independent of interest, we show how to test for various types of equilibria by a black-box reduction to single-agent learning, which includes Nash equilibria, correlated equilibria, and coarse correlated equilibria. | Haozhe Jiang, Qiwen Cui, Zhihan Xiong, Maryam Fazel, Simon Shaolei Du |  |
| 1141 |  |  [Prompt Risk Control: A Rigorous Framework for Responsible Deployment of Large Language Models](https://openreview.net/forum?id=5tGGWOijvq) |  | 0 | With the explosion of the zero-shot capabilities of (and thus interest in) pre-trained large language models, there has come accompanying interest in how best to prompt a language model to perform a given task. While it may be tempting to choose a prompt based on empirical results on a validation set, this can lead to a deployment where an unexpectedly high loss occurs. To mitigate this prospect, we propose a lightweight framework, Prompt Risk Control, for selecting a prompt based on rigorous upper bounds on families of informative risk measures. We provide and compare different methods for producing bounds on a diverse set of risk metrics like mean, CVaR, and the Gini coefficient of the loss distribution. In addition, we extend the underlying statistical bounding techniques to accommodate the possibility of distribution shifts in deployment. Extensive experiments on high-impact applications like chatbots, medical question answering, and news summarization highlight why such a framework is necessary to reduce exposure to the worst outcomes. | Thomas P.

The analogy between lattices and graphs enables the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) as a faster surrogate model compared to traditional methods such as finite element modelling. In this work, we generate a big dataset of structure-property relationships for strut-based lattices. The dataset is made available to the community which can fuel the development of methods anchored in physical principles for the fitting of fourth-order tensors. In addition, we present a higher-order GNN model trained on this dataset. The key features of the model are (i) SE(3) equivariance, and (ii) consistency with the thermodynamic law of conservation of energy. We compare the model to non-equivariant models based on a number of error metrics and demonstrate its benefits in terms of predictive performance and reduced training requirements. Finally, we demonstrate an example application of the model to an architected material design task. The methods which we developed are applicable to fourth-order tensors beyond elasticity such as piezo-optical tensor etc. | Ivan Grega, Ilyes Batatia, Gábor Csányi, Sri Karlapati, Vikram S.

While being a flexible framework, where the distribution of local data, participation rate, and computing power of each client can greatly vary, such flexibility gives rise to many new challenges, especially in the hyperparameter tuning on the client side. We propose $\Delta$-SGD, a simple step size rule for SGD that enables each client to use its own step size by adapting to the local smoothness of the function each client is optimizing. We provide theoretical and empirical results where the benefit of the client adaptivity is shown in various FL scenarios. | Junhyung Lyle Kim, Mohammad Taha Toghani, César A.

However, establishing the correspondence between humans and robots with different body structures is not straightforward due to the mismatches in kinematics and dynamics properties, which causes intrinsic ambiguity to the problem. Many previous algorithms approach this motion retargeting problem with unsupervised learning, which requires the prerequisite skill sets. However, it will be extremely costly to learn all the skills without understanding the given human motions, particularly for high-dimensional robots. In this work, we introduce CrossLoco, a guided unsupervised reinforcement learning framework that simultaneously learns robot skills and their correspondence to human motions. Our key innovation is to introduce a cycle-consistency-based reward term designed to maximize the mutual information between human motions and robot states. We demonstrate that the proposed framework can generate compelling robot motions by translating diverse human motions, such as running, hopping, and dancing. We quantitatively compare our CrossLoco against the manually engineered and unsupervised baseline algorithms along with the ablated versions of our framework and demonstrate that our method translates human motions with better accuracy, diversity, and user preference. We also showcase its utility in other applications, such as synthesizing robot movements from language input and enabling interactive robot control. | Tianyu Li, Hyunyoung Jung, Matthew C.

To better understand these architectures, we pretrain a suite of 17 attention and gated-convolution language models, finding that SoTA gated-convolution architectures still underperform attention by up to 2.1 perplexity points on the Pile. In fine-grained analysis, we find 82% of the gap is explained by each model's ability to recall information that is previously mentioned in-context, e.g. "Hakuna Matata means no worries Hakuna Matata it means no" -> ??. On this task, termed "associative recall", we find that attention outperforms gated-convolutions by a large margin: a 70M parameter attention model outperforms a 1.4 billion parameter gated-convolution model on associative recall. This is surprising because prior work shows gated convolutions can perfectly solve synthetic tests for AR capability. To close the gap between synthetics and real language, we develop a new formalization of the task called multi-query associative recall (MQAR) that better reflects actual language. We perform an empirical and theoretical study of MQAR that elucidates differences in the parameter-efficiency of attention and gated-convolution recall. Informed by our analysis, we evaluate simple convolution-attention hybrids and show that hybrids with input-dependent sparse attention patterns can close 97.4% of the gap to attention, while maintaining sub-quadratic scaling.

In this paper, we introduce a communication regime named CIPHER (Communicative Inter-Model Protocol Through Embedding Representation) to address this issue. Specifically, we remove the token sampling step from LLMs and let them communicate their beliefs across the vocabulary through the expectation of the raw transformer output embeddings. Remarkably, by deviating from natural language, CIPHER offers an advantage of encoding a broader spectrum of information without any modification to the model weights, outperforming the state-of-the-art LLM debate methods using natural language by 0.5-5.0% across five reasoning tasks and multiple open-source LLMs of varying sizes. This showcases the superiority and robustness of embeddings as an alternative "language" for communication among LLMs. We anticipate that CIPHER will inspire further exploration for the design of interactions within LLM agent systems, offering a new direction that could significantly influence future developments in the field. | Chau Pham, Boyi Liu, Yingxiang Yang, Zhengyu Chen, Tianyi Liu, Jianbo Yuan, Bryan A.

Several theoretical studies have shown that batch normalization improves the signal propagation, by avoiding the representations from becoming collinear across the layers. However, results on mean-field theory of batch normalization also conclude that this benefit comes at the expense of exploding gradients in depth. Motivated by these two aspects of batch normalization, in this study we pose the following question: \*Can a batch-normalized network keep the optimal signal propagation properties, but avoid exploding gradients?\* We answer this question in the affirmative by giving a particular construction of an \*MLP with linear activations\* and batch-normalization that provably has \*bounded gradients\* at any depth. Based on Weingarten calculus, we develop a rigorous and non-asymptotic theory for this constructed MLP that gives a precise characterization of forward signal propagation, while proving that gradients remain bounded for linearly independent input samples, which holds in most practical settings. Inspired by our theory, we also design an activation shaping scheme that empirically achieves the same properties for non-linear activations. | Alexandru Meterez, Amir Joudaki, Francesco Orabona, Alexander Immer, Gunnar Rätsch, Hadi Daneshmand |  |

Such abstention is particularly useful on samples which are close to the learned decision boundary, or which are outliers with respect to the training sample. These settings have been the subject of extensive but disjoint study in the selective classification (SC) and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection literature. Recent work on selective classification with OOD detection (SCOD) has argued for the unified study of these problems; however, the formal underpinnings of this problem are still nascent, and existing techniques are heuristic in nature. In this paper, we propose new plugin estimators for SCOD that are theoretically grounded, effective, and generalise existing approaches from the SC and OOD detection literature. In the course of our analysis, we formally explicate how naïve use of existing SC and OOD detection baselines may be inadequate for SCOD. We empirically demonstrate that our approaches yields competitive SC and OOD detection trade-offs compared to common baselines. | Harikrishna Narasimhan, Aditya Krishna Menon, Wittawat Jitkrittum, Sanjiv Kumar |  |

Although the resulting models are highly sparse and theoretically less computationally expensive, achieving speedups with unstructured sparsity on real-world hardware is challenging. In this work, we propose a sparse-to-sparse DST method, Structured RigL (SRigL), to learn a variant of fine-grained structured N:M sparsity by imposing a constant fan-in constraint. Using our empirical analysis of existing DST methods at high sparsity, we additionally employ a neuron ablation method which enables SRigL to achieve state-of-the-art sparse-to-sparse structured DST performance on a variety of Neural Network (NN) architectures. Using a 90% sparse linear layer, we demonstrate a real-world acceleration of 3.4×/2.5× on CPU for online inference and 1.7×/13.0× on GPU for inference with a batch size of 256 when compared to equivalent dense/unstructured (CSR) sparse layers, respectively. | Mike Lasby, Anna Golubeva, Utku Evci, Mihai Nica, Yani Ioannou |  |

Such a capability could advance Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Planning algorithms, but achieving it is challenging. Inaccuracies in model estimates can compound, resulting in increased errors over long horizons. We approach this problem from the lens of Koopman theory, where the nonlinear dynamics of the environment can be linearized in a high-dimensional latent space. This allows us to efficiently parallelize the sequential problem of long-range prediction using convolution while accounting for the agent's action at every time step. Our approach also enables stability analysis and better control over gradients through time. Taken together, these advantages result in significant improvement over the existing approaches, both in the efficiency and the accuracy of modeling dynamics over extended horizons. We also show that this model can be easily incorporated into dynamics modeling for model-based planning and model-free RL and report promising experimental results. | Arnab Kumar Mondal, Siba Smarak Panigrahi, Sai Rajeswar, Kaleem Siddiqi, Siamak Ravanbakhsh |  |
| 1151 |  |  [Learning interpretable control inputs and dynamics underlying animal locomotion](https://openreview.net/forum?id=MFCjgEOLJT) |  | 0 | A central objective in neuroscience is to understand how the brain orchestrates movement. Recent advances in automated tracking technologies have made it possible to document behavior with unprecedented temporal resolution and scale, generating rich datasets which can be exploited to gain insights into the neural control of movement. One common approach is to identify stereotypical motor primitives using cluster analysis. However, this categorical description can limit our ability to model the effect of more continuous control schemes. Here we take a control theoretic approach to behavioral modeling and argue that movements can be understood as the output of a controlled dynamical system. Previously, models of movement dynamics, trained solely on behavioral data, have been effective in reproducing observed features of neural activity. These models addressed specific scenarios where animals were trained to execute particular movements upon receiving a prompt. In this study, we extend this approach to analyze the full natural locomotor repertoire of an animal: the zebrafish larva. Our findings demonstrate that this repertoire can be effectively generated through a sparse control signal driving a latent Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Our model's learned latent space preserves key kinematic features and disentangles different categories of movements. To further interpret the latent dynamics, we used balanced model reduction to yield a simplified model. Collectively, our methods serve as a case study for interpretable system identification, and offer a novel framework for understanding neural activity in relation to movement. | Thomas Soares Mullen, Marine Schimel, Guillaume Hennequin, Christian K.

| 1152 |  |  [Tight Rates in Supervised Outlier Transfer Learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=nUBLhhVM1l) |  | 0 | A critical barrier to learning an accurate decision rule for outlier detection is the scarcity of outlier data. As such, practitioners often turn to the use of similar but imperfect outlier data from which they might \emph{transfer} information to the target outlier detection task. Despite the recent empirical success of transfer learning in outlier detection, a fundamental understanding of when and how knowledge can be transferred from a source to a target in outlier detection remains elusive. In this work, we adopt the traditional framework of Neyman-Pearson classification---which formalizes \emph{supervised outlier detection}, i.e., unbalanced classification---with the added assumption that we have access to both source and (some or no) target outlier data. Our main results are then as follows: We first determine the information-theoretic limits of the problem under a measure of discrepancy that extends some existing notions from traditional balanced classification; interestingly, unlike in balanced classification, seemingly very dissimilar sources can provide much information about a target, thus resulting in fast transfer. We then show that, in principle, these information-theoretic limits are achievable by \emph{adaptive} procedures, i.e., procedures with no a priori information on the discrepancy between source and target distributions. | Mohammadreza M.

In seminal works, Hyv\"arinen proposed vanilla score matching as a way to learn distributions from data by computing an estimate of the score function of the underlying ground truth, and established connections between this method and established techniques like Contrastive Divergence and Pseudolikelihood estimation. It is by now well-known that vanilla score matching has significant difficulties learning multimodal distributions. Although there are various ways to overcome this difficulty, the following question has remained unanswered --- is there a natural way to sample multimodal distributions using just the vanilla score? Inspired by a long line of related experimental works, we prove that the Langevin diffusion with early stopping, initialized at the empirical distribution, and run on a score function estimated from data successfully generates natural multimodal distributions (mixtures of log-concave distributions). | Frederic Koehler, ThuyDuong Vuong |  |

To probe when an LLM generates unwanted content, the current paradigm is to recruit a $\textit{red team}$ of human testers to design input prompts (i.e., test cases) that elicit undesirable responses from LLMs. However, relying solely on human testers is expensive and time-consuming. Recent works automate red teaming by training a separate red team LLM with reinforcement learning (RL) to generate test cases that maximize the chance of eliciting undesirable responses from the target LLM. However, current RL methods are only able to generate a small number of effective test cases resulting in a low coverage of the span of prompts that elicit undesirable responses from the target LLM. To overcome this limitation, we draw a connection between the problem of increasing the coverage of generated test cases and the well-studied approach of curiosity-driven exploration that optimizes for novelty. Our method of curiosity-driven red teaming (CRT) achieves greater coverage of test cases while mantaining or increasing their effectiveness compared to existing methods. Our method, CRT successfully provokes toxic responses from LLaMA2 model that has been heavily fine-tuned using human preferences to avoid toxic outputs.

| 1155 |  |  [Understanding prompt engineering may not require rethinking generalization](https://openreview.net/forum?id=a745RnSFLT) |  | 0 | Zero-shot learning in prompted vision-language models, the practice of crafting prompts to build classifiers without an explicit training process, has achieved impressive performance in many settings. This success presents a seemingly surprising observation: these methods suffer relatively little from overfitting, i.e., when a prompt is manually engineered to achieve low error on a given training set (thus rendering the method no longer actually zero-shot), the approach still performs well on held-out test data. In this paper, we show that we can explain such performance well via recourse to classical PAC-Bayes bounds. Specifically, we show that the discrete nature of prompts, combined with a PAC-Bayes prior given by a language model, results in generalization bounds that are remarkably tight by the standards of the literature: for instance, the generalization bound of an ImageNet classifier is often within a few percentage points of the true test error. We demonstrate empirically that this holds for existing handcrafted prompts and prompts generated through simple greedy search. Furthermore, the resulting bound is well-suited for model selection: the models with the best bound typically also have the best test performance. This work thus provides a possible justification for the widespread practice of "prompt engineering," even if it seems that such methods could potentially overfit the training data. | Victor Akinwande, Yiding Jiang, Dylan Sam, J.

Despite DAC’s empirical success, the original AIL objective is on-policy and DAC’s ad-hoc application of off-policy training does not guarantee successful imitation. Follow-up work such as ValueDICE tackles this issue by deriving a fully off-policy AIL objective. Instead in this work, we develop a novel and principled AIL algorithm via the framework of boosting. Like boosting, our new algorithm, AILBoost, maintains an ensemble of weighted weak learners (i.e., policies) and trains a discriminator that witnesses the maximum discrepancy between the distributions of the ensemble and the expert policy. We maintain a weighted replay buffer to represent the state-action distribution induced by the ensemble, allowing us to train discriminators using the entire data collected so far. Empirically, we evaluate our algorithm on both controller state-based and pixel-based environments from the DeepMind Control Suite. AILBoost outperforms DAC on both types of environments, demonstrating the benefit of properly weighting replay buffer data for off-policy training. On state-based environments, AILBoost outperforms ValueDICE and IQ-Learn, achieving state-of-the-art performance with as little as one expert trajectory. | Jonathan D.

To address this challenge, algorithms must produce features for every claim that are both semantically meaningful, and compact enough to find a semantic alignment with the source information. In contrast to previous work, which tackled the alignment problem by learning over annotated corpora of claims and their corresponding labels, we propose SFAVEL ($\underline{S}$elf-supervised $\underline{Fa}$ct $\underline{Ve}$rification via $\underline{L}$anguage Model Distillation), a novel unsupervised pretraining framework that leverages pre-trained language models to distil self-supervised features into high-quality claim-fact alignments without the need for annotations. This is enabled by a novel contrastive loss function that encourages features to attain high-quality claim and evidence alignments whilst preserving the semantic relationships across the corpora. Notably, we present results that achieve a new state-of-the-art on FB15k-237 (+5.3\% Hits@1) and FEVER (+8\% accuracy) with linear evaluation. | Adrián Bazaga, Pietro Lio, Gos Micklem |  |

Research has shown the superiority of perceptual metrics over pixel-wise metrics in aligning with human perception and serving as a proxy for the human visual system. On the other hand, as perceptual metrics rely on neural networks, there is a growing concern regarding their resilience, given the established vulnerability of neural networks to adversarial attacks. It is indeed logical to infer that perceptual metrics may inherit both the strengths and shortcomings of neural networks. In this work, we demonstrate the vulnerability of state-of-the-art perceptual similarity metrics based on an ensemble of ViT-based feature extractors to adversarial attacks. We then propose a framework to train a robust perceptual similarity metric called LipSim (Lipschitz Similarity Metric) with provable guarantees. By leveraging 1-Lipschitz neural networks as the backbone, LipSim provides guarded areas around each data point and certificates for all perturbations within an $\ell_2$ ball. Finally, a comprehensive set of experiments shows the performance of LipSim in terms of natural and certified scores and on the image retrieval application. | Sara Ghazanfari, Alexandre Araujo, Prashanth Krishnamurthy, Farshad Khorrami, Siddharth Garg |  |

Recent advances in foundation models, trained on orders of magnitude more data, have begun to saturate performance on these benchmarks. Despite this progress, even today’s best models are brittle in practice. As a step toward more holistic measurement of model reliability, we propose studying performance on crowdsourced, global datasets, which contain natural distribution shifts seen practically in deployment. We perform a comprehensive empirical study on two crowdsourced, globally representative datasets, evaluating nearly 100 vision models to uncover several concerning empirical trends: first, that progress on crowdsourced, global data has significantly lagged behind standard benchmarks, with advances on ImageNet occurring at $2.5x$ the rate of progress on crowdsourced, global data. Second, we find that progress on standard benchmarks has failed to improve or exacerbated geographic disparities: geographic disparities between the least performant models and today's best models have more than tripled. We showcase the promise of using more curated and/or representative training datasets for mitigating these trends, and emphasize curation of web-scale, geographically representative training datasets as a critical open problem for the research community. | Megan Richards, Polina Kirichenko, Diane Bouchacourt, Mark Ibrahim |  |

Building on copula theory, we propose a simplified objective for the recently-introduced transformer-based attentional copulas (TACTiS), wherein the number of distributional parameters now scales linearly with the number of variables instead of factorially. The new objective requires the introduction of a training curriculum, which goes hand-in-hand with necessary changes to the original architecture. We show that the resulting model has significantly better training dynamics and achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse real-world forecasting tasks, while maintaining the flexibility of prior work, such as seamless handling of unaligned and unevenly-sampled time series.

In this regard, the key insight of this work is to interpret Neural ODE optimization as a min-max optimal control problem. More particularly, we present Game Theoretic Second-Order Neural Optimizer (GTSONO), a robust game theoretic optimizer based on the principles of min-max Differential Dynamic Programming. The proposed method exhibits significant computational benefits due to efficient matrix decompositions and provides convergence guarantees to local saddle points. Empirically, the robustness of the proposed optimizer is demonstrated through greater robust accuracy compared to benchmark optimizers when trained on clean images. Additionally, its ability to provide a performance increase when adapted to an already existing adversarial defense technique is also illustrated. Finally, the superiority of the proposed update law over its gradient based counterpart highlights the potential benefits of incorporating robust optimal control paradigms into adversarial training methods. | Panagiotis Theodoropoulos, GuanHorng Liu, Tianrong Chen, Augustinos D.

(2023) recently showed how to use first-order gradient methods to solve general variational inequalities (VIs) under a limiting assumption that analytic solutions of specific subproblems are available. In this paper, we circumvent this assumption via a warm-starting technique where we solve subproblems approximately and initialize variables with the approximate solution found at the previous iteration. We prove the convergence of this method and show that the gap function of the last iterate of the method decreases at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{K}})$ when the operator is $L$-Lipschitz and monotone. In numerical experiments, we show that this technique can converge much faster than its exact counterpart. Furthermore, for the cases when the inequality constraints are simple, we introduce an alternative variant of ACVI and establish its convergence under the same conditions. Finally, we relax the smoothness assumptions in Yang et al., yielding, to our knowledge, the first convergence result for VIs with general constraints that does not rely on the assumption that the operator is $L$-Lipschitz. | Tatjana Chavdarova, Tong Yang, Matteo Pagliardini, Michael I.

To avoid the prohibitive costs of constantly retraining, it is imperative to continually train these models. This problem is exacerbated by the lack of any large scale continual learning benchmarks or baselines. We introduce the first set of web-scale Time-Continual (TiC) benchmarks for training vision-language models: TiC-DataComp, TiC-YFCC, and TiC-Redcaps. TiC-DataComp, our largest dataset, contains over 12.7B timestamped image-text pairs spanning 9 years (2014-2022). We first use our benchmarks to curate various dynamic evaluations to measure temporal robustness of existing models. We show OpenAI's CLIP (trained on data up to 2020) loses $\approx 8\%$ zero-shot accuracy on our curated retrieval task from 2021-2022 compared with more recently trained models in OpenCLIP repository. We then study how to efficiently train models on time-continuous data. We demonstrate that a simple rehearsal-based approach that continues training from the last checkpoint and replays old data reduces compute by $2.5\times$ when compared to the standard practice of retraining from scratch.

Various techniques have been introduced for identifying AI-generated images, with watermarking emerging as a promising approach. In this paper, we analyze the robustness of various AI-image detectors including watermarking and classifier-based deepfake detectors. For watermarking methods that introduce subtle image perturbations (i.e., low perturbation budget methods), we reveal a fundamental trade-off between the evasion error rate (i.e., the fraction of watermarked images detected as non-watermarked ones) and the spoofing error rate (i.e., the fraction of non-watermarked images detected as watermarked ones) upon an application of a diffusion purification attack. In this regime, we also empirically show that diffusion purification effectively removes watermarks with minimal changes to images. For high perturbation watermarking methods where notable changes are applied to images, the diffusion purification attack is not effective. In this case, we develop a model substitution adversarial attack that can successfully remove watermarks. Moreover, we show that watermarking methods are vulnerable to spoofing attacks where the attacker aims to have real images (potentially obscene) identified as watermarked ones, damaging the reputation of the developers. In particular, by just having black-box access to the watermarking method, we show that one can generate a watermarked noise image which can be added to the real images to have them falsely flagged as watermarked ones. Finally, we extend our theory to characterize a fundamental trade-off between the robustness and reliability of classifier-based deep fake detectors and demonstrate it through experiments.

However, for NLP tasks that involve fine-grained predictions on words and phrases, the performance of zero-shot cross-lingual transfer learning lags far behind supervised fine-tuning methods. Therefore, it is common to exploit translation and label projection to further improve the performance by (1) translating training data that is available in a high-resource language (e.g., English) together with the gold labels into low-resource languages, and/or (2) translating test data in low-resource languages to a high-source language to run inference on, then projecting the predicted span-level labels back onto the original test data. However, state-of-the-art marker-based label projection methods suffer from translation quality degradation due to the extra label markers injected in the input to the translation model. In this work, we explore a new direction that leverages constrained decoding for label projection to overcome the aforementioned issues. Our new method not only can preserve the quality of translated texts but also has the versatility of being applicable to both translating training and translating test data strategies. This versatility is crucial as our experiments reveal that translating test data can lead to a considerable boost in performance compared to translating only training data. We evaluate on two cross-lingual transfer tasks, namely Named Entity Recognition and Event Argument Extraction, spanning 20 languages. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art marker-based method by a large margin and also shows better performance than other label projection methods that rely on external word alignment. | Duong Minh Le, Yang Chen, Alan Ritter, Wei Xu |  |

However, its application in certain imaging fields, such as microscopy and satellite imaging, presents unique challenges. In these domains, images often contain multiple channels, each carrying semantically distinct and independent information. Furthermore, the model must demonstrate robustness to sparsity in input channels, as they may not be densely available during training or testing. In this paper, we propose a modification to the ViT architecture that enhances reasoning across the input channels and introduce Hierarchical Channel Sampling (HCS) as an additional regularization technique to ensure robustness when only partial channels are presented during test time. Our proposed model, ChannelViT, constructs patch tokens independently from each input channel and utilizes a learnable channel embedding that is added to the patch tokens, similar to positional embeddings. We evaluate the performance of ChannelViT on ImageNet, JUMP-CP (microscopy cell imaging), and So2Sat (satellite imaging). Our results show that ChannelViT outperforms ViT on classification tasks and generalizes well, even when a subset of input channels is used during testing. Across our experiments, HCS proves to be a powerful regularizer, independent of the architecture employed, suggesting itself as a straightforward technique for robust ViT training. Lastly, we find that ChannelViT generalizes effectively even when there is limited access to all channels during training, highlighting its potential for multi-channel imaging under real-world conditions with sparse sensors.

Recent work has shown for homogeneous neural networks a large portion of this training data could be reconstructed with only access to the trained network parameters. While the attack was shown to work empirically, there exists little formal understanding of its effective regime and which datapoints are susceptible to reconstruction. In this work, we first build a stronger version of the dataset reconstruction attack and show how it can provably recover the \emph{entire training set} in the infinite width regime. We then empirically study the characteristics of this attack on two-layer networks and reveal that its success heavily depends on deviations from the frozen infinite-width Neural Tangent Kernel limit. Next, we study the nature of easily-reconstructed images. We show that both theoretically and empirically, reconstructed images tend to \`\`outliers'' in the dataset, and that these reconstruction attacks can be used for \textit{dataset distillation}, that is, we can retrain on reconstructed images and obtain high predictive accuracy. | Noel Loo, Ramin M.

However, deploying LVLMs is often problematic due to their massive computational/energy costs and carbon consumption, making it infeasible to adopt conventional iterative global pruning, which is costly due to computing the Hessian matrix of the entire large model for sparsification. Alternatively, several studies have recently proposed layer-wise pruning approaches to avoid the expensive computation of global pruning and efficiently compress model weights according to their importance within a layer. However, these methods often suffer from suboptimal model compression due to their lack of a global perspective. To address this limitation in recent efficient pruning methods for large models, we propose Efficient Coarse-to-Fine Layer-Wise Pruning (ECoFLaP), a two-stage coarse-to-fine weight pruning approach for LVLMs. We first determine the sparsity ratios of different layers or blocks by leveraging the global importance score, which is efficiently computed based on the zeroth-order approximation of the global model gradients. Then, the multimodal model performs layer-wise unstructured weight pruning. We validate our proposed method across various multi-modal and single-modal models and datasets, demonstrating significant performance improvements over prevalent pruning techniques in the high-sparsity regime. | YiLin Sung, Jaehong Yoon, Mohit Bansal |  |

It has applications to interpretability, neural architecture search, privacy, and continual learning. Despite strong successes in supervised domains, such methods have not yet been extended to reinforcement learning, where the lack of a fixed dataset renders most distillation methods unusable. Filling the gap, we formalize $\textit{behaviour distillation}$, a setting that aims to discover and then condense the information required for training an expert policy into a synthetic dataset of state-action pairs, $\textit{without access to expert data}$. We then introduce Hallucinating Datasets with Evolution Strategies (HaDES), a method for behaviour distillation that can discover datasets of $\textit{just four}$ state-action pairs which, under supervised learning, train agents to competitive performance levels in continuous control tasks. We show that these datasets generalize out of distribution to training policies with a wide range of architectures and hyperparameters. We also demonstrate application to a downstream task, namely training multi-task agents in a zero-shot fashion. Beyond behaviour distillation, HaDES provides significant improvements in neuroevolution for RL over previous approaches and achieves SoTA results on one standard supervised dataset distillation task. Finally, we show that visualizing the synthetic datasets can provide human-interpretable task insights. | Andrei Lupu, Chris Lu, Jarek Liesen, Robert Tjarko Lange, Jakob Nicolaus Foerster |  |

LoRA injects a product of two trainable rank decomposition matrices over the top of each frozen pre-trained model module. However, when applied in the setting of privacy-preserving federated learning (FL), LoRA may become unstable due to the following facts: 1) the effects of data heterogeneity and multi-step local updates are non-negligible, 2) additive noise enforced on updating gradients to guarantee differential privacy (DP) can be amplified and 3) the final performance is susceptible to hyper-parameters. A key factor leading to these phenomena is the discordance between jointly optimizing the two low-rank matrices by local clients and separately aggregating them by the central server. Thus, this paper proposes an efficient and effective version of LoRA, Federated Freeze A LoRA (FFA-LoRA), to alleviate these challenges and further halve the communication cost of federated fine-tuning LLMs. The core idea of FFA-LoRA is to fix the randomly initialized non-zero matrices and only fine-tune the zero-initialized matrices. Compared to LoRA, FFA-LoRA is motivated by practical and theoretical benefits in privacy-preserved FL.

Its long history and numerous applications notwithstanding, inference of phylogenetic trees from sequence data remains challenging: the high complexity of tree space poses a significant obstacle for the current combinatorial and probabilistic techniques. In this paper, we adopt the framework of generative flow networks (GFlowNets) to tackle two core problems in phylogenetics: parsimony-based and Bayesian phylogenetic inference. Because GFlowNets are well-suited for sampling complex combinatorial structures, they are a natural choice for exploring and sampling from the multimodal posterior distribution over tree topologies and evolutionary distances. We demonstrate that our amortized posterior sampler, PhyloGFN, produces diverse and high-quality evolutionary hypotheses on real benchmark datasets. PhyloGFN is competitive with prior works in marginal likelihood estimation and achieves a closer fit to the target distribution than state-of-the-art variational inference methods. | MingYang Zhou, Zichao Yan, Elliot Layne, Nikolay Malkin, Dinghuai Zhang, Moksh Jain, Mathieu Blanchette, Yoshua Bengio |  |

Sparse BNNs have been investigated for efficient inference, typically by either slowly introducing sparsity throughout the training or by post-training compression of dense BNNs. The dilemma of how to cut down massive training costs remains, particularly given the requirement to learn about the uncertainty. To solve this challenge, we introduce Sparse Subspace Variational Inference (SSVI), the first fully sparse BNN framework that maintains a consistently sparse Bayesian model throughout the training and inference phases. Starting from a randomly initialized low-dimensional sparse subspace, our approach alternately optimizes the sparse subspace basis selection and its associated parameters. While basis selection is characterized as a non-differentiable problem, we approximate the optimal solution with a removal-and-addition strategy, guided by novel criteria based on weight distribution statistics. Our extensive experiments show that SSVI sets new benchmarks in crafting sparse BNNs, achieving, for instance, a 10-20× compression in model size with under 3\% performance drop, and up to 20× FLOPs reduction during training. Remarkably, SSVI also demonstrates enhanced robustness to hyperparameters, reducing the need for intricate tuning in VI and occasionally even surpassing VI-trained dense BNNs. | Junbo Li, Zichen Miao, Qiang Qiu, Ruqi Zhang |  |

While exchanging messages over the input graph endows GNNs with a strong inductive bias, it can also make GNNs susceptible to over-squashing, thereby preventing them from capturing long-range interactions in the given graph. To rectify this issue, graph rewiring techniques have been proposed as a means of improving information flow by altering the graph connectivity. In this work, we identify three desiderata for graph-rewiring: (i) reduce over-squashing, (ii) respect the locality of the graph, and (iii) preserve the sparsity of the graph. We highlight fundamental trade-offs that occur between spatial and spectral rewiring techniques; while the former often satisfy (i) and (ii) but not (iii), the latter generally satisfy (i) and (iii) at the expense of (ii). We propose a novel rewiring framework that satisfies all of (i)--(iii) through a locality-aware sequence of rewiring operations. We then discuss a specific instance of such rewiring framework and validate its effectiveness on several real-world benchmarks, showing that it either matches or significantly outperforms existing rewiring approaches. | Federico Barbero, Ameya Velingker, Amin Saberi, Michael M.

To tackle the challenges of extracting domain knowledge from a limited amount of data, it is crucial to utilize correlated information from pre-trained backbones and source domains. Previous studies fail to utilize recent foundation models with strong out-of-distribution generalization. Additionally, domain-centric designs are not flavored in their works. Furthermore, they employ the process of modelling source domains and the process of learning to adapt independently into disjoint training stages. In this work, we propose an approach on top of the pre-computed features of the foundation model. Specifically, we build a knowledge bank to learn the transferable knowledge from source domains. Conditioned on few-shot target data, we introduce a domain prompt generator to condense the knowledge bank into a domain-specific prompt. The domain prompt then directs the visual features towards a particular domain via a guidance module. Moreover, we propose a domain-aware contrastive loss and employ meta-learning to facilitate domain knowledge extraction. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the domain knowledge extraction. The proposed method outperforms previous work on 5 large-scale benchmarks including WILDS and DomainNet. | Zhixiang Chi, Li Gu, Tao Zhong, Huan Liu, Yuanhao Yu, Konstantinos N.

However, many existing approaches either presuppose the availability of all modalities and labels for each patient or only deal with missing modalities. In reality, patient data often comes with both missing modalities and labels for various reasons (i.e., the missing modality and label issue). Moreover, multimodal models might over-rely on certain modalities, causing sub-optimal performance when these modalities are absent (i.e., the modality collapse issue). To address these issues, we introduce MUSE: a mutual-consistent graph contrastive learning method. MUSE uses a flexible bipartite graph to represent the patient-modality relationship, which can adapt to various missing modality patterns. To tackle the modality collapse issue, MUSE learns to focus on modality-general and label-decisive features via a mutual-consistent contrastive learning loss. Notably, the unsupervised component of the contrastive objective only requires self-supervision signals, thereby broadening the training scope to incorporate patients with missing labels. We evaluate MUSE on three publicly available datasets: MIMIC-IV, eICU, and ADNI. Results show that MUSE outperforms all baselines, and MUSE+ further elevates the absolute improvement to ~4% by extending the training scope to patients with absent labels. | Zhenbang Wu, Anant Dadu, Nicholas J.

| 1176 |  |  [Improved sampling via learned diffusions](https://openreview.net/forum?id=h4pNROsO06) |  | 0 | Recently, a series of papers proposed deep learning-based approaches to sample from target distributions using controlled diffusion processes, being trained only on the unnormalized target densities without access to samples. Building on previous work, we identify these approaches as special cases of a generalized Schrödinger bridge problem, seeking a stochastic evolution between a given prior distribution and the specified target. We further generalize this framework by introducing a variational formulation based on divergences between path space measures of time-reversed diffusion processes. This abstract perspective leads to practical losses that can be optimized by gradient-based algorithms and includes previous objectives as special cases. At the same time, it allows us to consider divergences other than the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence that is known to suffer from mode collapse. In particular, we propose the so-called \textit{log-variance loss}, which exhibits favorable numerical properties and leads to significantly improved performance across all considered approaches. | Lorenz Richter, Julius Berner |  |

These features are rarely observed in previous vision-language models. However, the technical details behind GPT-4 continue to remain undisclosed. We believe that the enhanced multi-modal generation capabilities of GPT-4 stem from the utilization of sophisticated large language models (LLM). To examine this phenomenon, we present MiniGPT-4, which aligns a frozen visual encoder with a frozen advanced LLM, Vicuna, using one projection layer. Our work, for the first time, uncovers that properly aligning the visual features with an advanced large language model can possess numerous advanced multi-modal abilities demonstrated by GPT-4, such as detailed image description generation and website creation from hand-drawn drafts. Furthermore, we also observe other emerging capabilities in MiniGPT-4, including writing stories and poems inspired by given images, teaching users how to cook based on food photos, and so on. In our experiment, we found that the model trained on short image caption pairs could produce unnatural language outputs (e.g., repetition and fragmentation). To address this problem, we curate a detailed image description dataset in the second stage to finetune the model, which consequently improves the model's generation reliability and overall usability. | Deyao Zhu, Jun Chen, Xiaoqian Shen, Xiang Li, Mohamed Elhoseiny |  |
| 1178 |  |  [Towards Establishing Guaranteed Error for Learned Database Operations](https://openreview.net/forum?id=6tqgL8VluV) |  | 0 | Machine learning models have demonstrated substantial performance enhancements over non-learned alternatives in various fundamental data management operations, including indexing (locating items in an array), cardinality estimation (estimating the number of matching records in a database), and range-sum estimation (estimating aggregate attribute values for query-matched records). However, real-world systems frequently favor less efficient non-learned methods due to their ability to offer (worst-case) error guarantees — an aspect where learned approaches often fall short. The primary objective of these guarantees is to ensure system reliability, ensuring that the chosen approach consistently delivers the desired level of accuracy across all databases. In this paper, we embark on the first theoretical study of such guarantees for learned methods, presenting the necessary conditions for such guarantees to hold when using machine learning to perform indexing, cardinality estimation and range-sum estimation. Specifically, we present the first known lower bounds on the model size required to achieve the desired accuracy for these three key database operations. Our results bound the required model size for given average and worst-case errors in performing database operations, serving as the first theoretical guidelines governing how model size must change based on data size to be able to guarantee an accuracy level. More broadly, our established guarantees pave the way for the broader adoption and integration of learned models into real-world systems. | Sepanta Zeighami, Cyrus Shahabi |  |

However, the questions of $\textit{when}$ and $\textit{which parts}$ of the context affect model generations are typically tackled separately, and current plausibility evaluations are practically limited to a handful of artificial benchmarks. To address this, we introduce $\textbf{P}$lausibility $\textbf{E}$valuation of $\textbf{Co}$ntext $\textbf{Re}$liance (PECoRe), an end-to-end interpretability framework designed to quantify context usage in language models' generations. Our approach leverages model internals to (i) contrastively identify context-sensitive target tokens in generated texts and (ii) link them to contextual cues justifying their prediction. We use PECoRe to quantify the plausibility of context-aware machine translation models, comparing model rationales with human annotations across several discourse-level phenomena. Finally, we apply our method to unannotated model translations to identify context-mediated predictions and highlight instances of (im)plausible context usage throughout generation. | Gabriele Sarti, Grzegorz Chrupala, Malvina Nissim, Arianna Bisazza |  |
| 1180 |  |  [Bayesian Optimization through Gaussian Cox Process Models for Spatio-temporal Data](https://openreview.net/forum?id=9j1RD9LlWH) |  | 0 | Bayesian optimization (BO) has established itself as a leading strategy for efficiently optimizing expensive-to-evaluate functions. Existing BO methods mostly rely on Gaussian process (GP) surrogate models and are not applicable to (doubly-stochastic) Gaussian Cox processes, where the observation process is modulated by a latent intensity function modeled as a GP. In this paper, we propose a novel maximum \*a posteriori\* inference of Gaussian Cox processes. It leverages the Laplace approximation and change of kernel technique to transform the problem into a new reproducing kernel Hilbert space, where it becomes more tractable computationally. It enables us to obtain both a functional posterior of the latent intensity function and the covariance of the posterior, thus extending existing works that often focus on specific link functions or estimating the posterior mean. Using the result, we propose a BO framework based on the Gaussian Cox process model and further develop a Nyström approximation for efficient computation. Extensive evaluations on various synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate significant improvement over state-of-the-art inference solutions for Gaussian Cox processes, as well as effective BO with a wide range of acquisition functions designed through the underlying Gaussian Cox process model. | Yongsheng Mei, Mahdi Imani, Tian Lan |  |

In modern RL research, there is a need for simulated environments that are performant, scalable, and modular to enable their utilization in a wider range of potential real-world applications. Therefore, we present Jumanji, a suite of diverse RL environments specifically designed to be fast, flexible, and scalable. Jumanji provides a suite of environments focusing on combinatorial problems frequently encountered in industry, as well as challenging general decision-making tasks. By leveraging the efficiency of JAX and hardware accelerators like GPUs and TPUs, Jumanji enables rapid iteration of research ideas and large-scale experimentation, ultimately empowering more capable agents. Unlike existing RL environment suites, Jumanji is highly customizable, allowing users to tailor the initial state distribution and problem complexity to their needs. Furthermore, we provide actor-critic baselines for each environment, accompanied by preliminary findings on scaling and generalization scenarios. Jumanji aims to set a new standard for speed, adaptability, and scalability of RL environments. | Clément Bonnet, Daniel Luo, Donal Byrne, Shikha Surana, Sasha Abramowitz, Paul Duckworth, Vincent Coyette, Laurence Illing Midgley, Elshadai Tegegn, Tristan Kalloniatis, Omayma Mahjoub, Matthew Macfarlane, Andries P.

However, RL requires careful structuring of the search space and algorithm design to be effective in this challenge. Through extensive experiments, we explore how different design choices for text grammar and algorithmic choices for training can affect an RL policy's ability to generate molecules with desired properties. We arrive at a new RL-based molecular design algorithm (ChemRLformer) and perform a thorough analysis using 25 molecule design tasks, including computationally complex protein docking simulations. From this analysis, we discover unique insights in this problem space and show that ChemRLformer achieves state-of-the-art performance while being more straightforward than prior work by demystifying which design choices are actually helpful for text-based molecule design. | Raj Ghugare, Santiago Miret, Adriana Hugessen, Mariano Phielipp, Glen Berseth |  |

However, the ECT was hitherto unable to learn task-specific representations. We overcome this issue and develop a novel computational layer that enables learning the ECT in an end-to-end fashion. Our method, the _Differentiable Euler Characteristic Transform_ (DECT) is fast and computationally efficient, while exhibiting performance on a par with more complex models in both graph and point cloud classification tasks. Moreover, we show that this seemingly simple statistic provides the same topological expressivity as more complex topological deep learning layers. | Ernst Röell, Bastian Rieck |  |

The framework of curriculum learning trains the agent in a curriculum composed of a sequence of related and more manageable source tasks. The expectation is that when some optimal decision rules are shared across source tasks and the target task, the agent could more quickly pick up the necessary skills to behave optimally in the environment, thus accelerating the learning process. However, this critical assumption of invariant optimal decision rules does not necessarily hold in many practical applications, specifically when the underlying environment contains unobserved confounders. This paper studies the problem of curriculum RL through causal lenses. We derive a sufficient graphical condition characterizing causally aligned source tasks, i.e., the invariance of optimal decision rules holds. We further develop an efficient algorithm to generate a causally aligned curriculum, provided with qualitative causal knowledge of the target environment. Finally, we validate our proposed methodology through experiments in confounded environments. | Mingxuan Li, Junzhe Zhang, Elias Bareinboim |  |
| 1185 |  |  [Faster Sampling from Log-Concave Densities over Polytopes via Efficient Linear Solvers](https://openreview.net/forum?id=v63GWletn8) |  | 0 | We consider the problem of sampling from a logconcave distribution $\pi(\theta) \propto e^{-f(\theta)}$ constrained to a polytope $K:=${$\theta \in \mathbb{R}^d: A\theta \leq b$}, where $A\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times d}$ and $b \in \mathbb{R}^m$. The fastest-known algorithm for the setting when $f$ is $O(1)$-Lipschitz or $O(1)$-smooth runs in roughly $O(md \times md^{\omega -1})$ arithmetic operations, where the $md^{\omega -1}$ term arises because each Markov chain step requires computing a matrix inversion and determinant ($\omega \approx 2.37$ is the matrix multiplication constant). We present a nearly-optimal implementation of this Markov chain with per-step complexity that is roughly the number of non-zero entries of $A$ while the number of Markov chain steps remains the same. The key technical ingredients are 1) to show that the matrices that arise in this Dikin walk change slowly, 2) to deploy efficient linear solvers which can leverage this slow change to speed up matrix inversion by using information computed in previous steps, and 3) to speed up the computation of the determinantal term in the Metropolis filter step via a randomized Taylor series-based estimator. This result directly improves the runtime for applications that involve sampling from Gibbs distributions constrained to polytopes that arise in Bayesian statistics and private optimization. | Oren Mangoubi, Nisheeth K.

| 1186 |  |  [Towards Characterizing Domain Counterfactuals for Invertible Latent Causal Models](https://openreview.net/forum?id=v1VvCWJAL8) |  | 0 | Answering counterfactual queries has important applications such as explainability, robustness, and fairness but is challenging when the causal variables are unobserved and the observations are non-linear mixtures of these latent variables, such as pixels in images. One approach is to recover the latent Structural Causal Model (SCM), which may be infeasible in practice due to requiring strong assumptions, e.g., linearity of the causal mechanisms or perfect atomic interventions. Meanwhile, more practical ML-based approaches using naive domain translation models to generate counterfactual samples lack theoretical grounding and may construct invalid counterfactuals. In this work, we strive to strike a balance between practicality and theoretical guarantees by analyzing a specific type of causal query called \*domain counterfactuals\*, which hypothesizes what a sample would have looked like if it had been generated in a different domain (or environment). We show that recovering the latent SCM is unnecessary for estimating domain counterfactuals, thereby sidestepping some of the theoretic challenges. By assuming invertibility and sparsity of intervention, we prove domain counterfactual estimation error can be bounded by a data fit term and intervention sparsity term. Building upon our theoretical results, we develop a theoretically grounded practical algorithm that simplifies the modeling process to generative model estimation under autoregressive and shared parameter constraints that enforce intervention sparsity. Finally, we show an improvement in counterfactual estimation over baseline methods through extensive simulated and image-based experiments. | Zeyu Zhou, Ruqi Bai, Sean Kulinski, Murat Kocaoglu, David I.

To illustrate this mechanism, we study the simple setting of vanilla gradient descent on a polynomial regression problem with a two layer neural network which exhibits grokking without regularization in a way that cannot be explained by existing theories. We identify sufficient statistics for the test loss of such a network, and tracking these over training reveals that grokking arises in this setting when the network first attempts to fit a kernel regression solution with its initial features, followed by late-time feature learning where a generalizing solution is identified after train loss is already low. We find that the key determinants of grokking are the rate of feature learning---which can be controlled precisely by parameters that scale the network output---and the alignment of the initial features with the target function $y(x)$. We argue this delayed generalization arises when (1) the top eigenvectors of the initial neural tangent kernel and the task labels $y(x)$ are misaligned, but (2) the dataset size is large enough so that it is possible for the network to generalize eventually, but not so large that train loss perfectly tracks test loss at all epochs, and (3) the network begins training in the lazy regime so does not learn features immediately. We conclude with evidence that this transition from lazy (linear model) to rich training (feature learning) can control grokking in more general settings, like on MNIST, one-layer Transformers, and student-teacher networks. | Tanishq Kumar, Blake Bordelon, Samuel J.

| 1188 |  |  [Exploiting Causal Graph Priors with Posterior Sampling for Reinforcement Learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=M0xK8nPGvt) |  | 0 | Posterior sampling allows exploitation of prior knowledge on the environment's transition dynamics to improve the sample efficiency of reinforcement learning. The prior is typically specified as a class of parametric distributions, the design of which can be cumbersome in practice, often resulting in the choice of uninformative priors. In this work, we propose a novel posterior sampling approach in which the prior is given as a (partial) causal graph over the environment's variables. The latter is often more natural to design, such as listing known causal dependencies between biometric features in a medical treatment study. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical Bayesian procedure, called C-PSRL, simultaneously learning the full causal graph at the higher level and the parameters of the resulting factored dynamics at the lower level. We provide an analysis of the Bayesian regret of C-PSRL that explicitly connects the regret rate with the degree of prior knowledge. Our numerical evaluation conducted in illustrative domains confirms that C-PSRL strongly improves the efficiency of posterior sampling with an uninformative prior while performing close to posterior sampling with the full causal graph. | Mirco Mutti, Riccardo De Santi, Marcello Restelli, Alexander Marx, Giorgia Ramponi |  |

A simple strategy to achieve more favorable cost-quality tradeoffs is cascading: here, a small model is invoked for most “easy” instances, while a few “hard” instances are deferred to the large model. While the principles underpinning effective cascading are well-studied for classification tasks — with deferral based on predicted class uncertainty favored theoretically and practically — a similar understanding is lacking for generative LM tasks. In this work, we initiate a systematic study of deferral rules for LM cascades. We begin by examining the natural extension of predicted class uncertainty to generative LM tasks, namely, the predicted sequence uncertainty. We show that this measure suffers from the length bias problem, either over- or under-emphasizing outputs based on their lengths. This is because LMs produce a sequence of uncertainty values, one for each output token; and moreover, the number of output tokens is variable across different examples. To mitigate the length bias, we propose to exploit the richer token-level uncertainty information implicit in generative LMs. We argue that naive predicted sequence uncertainty corresponds to a simple aggregation of these uncertainties. By contrast, we show that incorporating token-level uncertainty through learned post-hoc deferral rules can significantly outperform such simple aggregation strategies, via experiments on a range of natural language benchmarks with FLAN-T5 models. We further show that incorporating embeddings from the smaller model and intermediate layers of the larger model can give an additional boost in the overall cost-quality tradeoff. | Neha Gupta, Harikrishna Narasimhan, Wittawat Jitkrittum, Ankit Singh Rawat, Aditya Krishna Menon, Sanjiv Kumar |  |

In stochastic optimization, such as training neural networks, folklore suggests that momentum may help deep learning optimization by reducing the variance of the stochastic gradient update, but previous theoretical analyses do not find momentum to offer any provable acceleration. Theoretical results in this paper clarify the role of momentum in stochastic settings where the learning rate is small and gradient noise is the dominant source of instability, suggesting that SGD with and without momentum behave similarly in the short and long time horizons. Experiments show that momentum indeed has limited benefits for both optimization and generalization in practical training regimes where the optimal learning rate is not very large, including small- to medium-batch training from scratch on ImageNet and fine-tuning language models on downstream tasks. | Runzhe Wang, Sadhika Malladi, Tianhao Wang, Kaifeng Lyu, Zhiyuan Li |  |

However, solving these problems in practice requires large semidefinite programs, with poor scaling in dimension and degree. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time that neural networks can effectively solve such problems in a data-driven fashion, achieving tenfold speedups while retaining high accuracy. Moreover, we observe that these polynomial learning problems are equivariant to the non-compact group $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$, which consists of area-preserving linear transformations. We therefore adapt our learning pipelines to accommodate this structure, including data augmentation, a new $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$-equivariant architecture, and an architecture equivariant with respect to its maximal compact subgroup, $SO(2, \mathbb{R})$. Surprisingly, the most successful approaches in practice do not enforce equivariance to the entire group, which we prove arises from an unusual lack of architecture universality for $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ in particular. A consequence of this result, which is of independent interest, is that there exists an equivariant function for which there is no sequence of equivariant polynomials multiplied by arbitrary invariants that approximates the original function. This is a rare example of a symmetric problem where data augmentation outperforms a fully equivariant architecture, and provides interesting lessons in both theory and practice for other problems with non-compact symmetries. | Hannah Lawrence, Mitchell Tong Harris |  |

We propose to decouple the two modalities by \*\*M\*\*ixture \*\*o\*\*f \*\*w\*\*eak and \*\*st\*\*rong experts (\*\*Mowst\*\*), where the weak expert is a light-weight Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), and the strong expert is an off-the-shelf GNN. To adapt the experts' collaboration to different target nodes, we propose a "confidence" mechanism based on the dispersion of the weak expert's prediction logits. The strong expert is conditionally activated in the low-confidence region when either the node's classification relies on neighborhood information, or the weak expert has low model quality. We reveal interesting training dynamics by analyzing the influence of the confidence function on loss: our training algorithm encourages the specialization of each expert by effectively generating soft splitting of the graph. In addition, our "confidence" design imposes a desirable bias toward the strong expert to benefit from GNN's better generalization capability. Mowst is easy to optimize and achieves strong expressive power, with a computation cost comparable to a single GNN. Empirically, Mowst on 4 backbone GNN architectures show significant accuracy improvement on 6 standard node classification benchmarks, including both homophilous and heterophilous graphs (https://github.com/facebookresearch/mowst-gnn). | Hanqing Zeng, Hanjia Lyu, Diyi Hu, Yinglong Xia, Jiebo Luo |  |

On the other hand, transformers are flexible, neural sequence models that present the intriguing possibility of providing general-purpose prediction methods, even in this mixture setting. In this work, we investigate the hypothesis that transformers can learn an optimal predictor for mixtures of regressions. We construct a generative process for a mixture of linear regressions for which the decision-theoretic optimal procedure is given by data-driven exponential weights on a finite set of parameters. We observe that transformers achieve low mean-squared error on data generated via this process. By probing the transformer's output at inference time, we also show that transformers typically make predictions that are close to the optimal predictor. Our experiments also demonstrate that transformers can learn mixtures of regressions in a sample-efficient fashion and are somewhat robust to distribution shifts. We complement our experimental observations by proving constructively that the decision-theoretic optimal procedure is indeed implementable by a transformer. | Reese Pathak, Rajat Sen, Weihao Kong, Abhimanyu Das |  |

Recent studies have shown its ability to counteract backdoor risks present in original training samples. In this study, we delve into the theoretical aspects of backdoor attacks and dataset distillation based on kernel methods. We introduce two new theory-driven trigger pattern generation methods specialized for dataset distillation. Following a comprehensive set of analyses and experiments, we show that our optimization-based trigger design framework informs effective backdoor attacks on dataset distillation. Notably, datasets poisoned by our designed trigger prove resilient against conventional backdoor attack detection and mitigation methods. Our empirical results validate that the triggers developed using our approaches are proficient at executing resilient backdoor attacks. | MingYu Chung, ShengYen Chou, ChiaMu Yu, PinYu Chen, SyYen Kuo, TsungYi Ho |  |

However, the inherent diversity in human behavior leads to the emergence of multi-modal data distributions, thereby presenting a formidable challenge for existing imitation learning algorithms. Quantifying a model's capacity to capture and replicate this diversity effectively is still an open problem. In this work, we introduce simulation benchmark environments and the corresponding \*Datasets with Diverse human Demonstrations for Imitation Learning (D3IL)\*, designed explicitly to evaluate a model's ability to learn multi-modal behavior. Our environments are designed to involve multiple sub-tasks that need to be solved, consider manipulation of multiple objects which increases the diversity of the behavior and can only be solved by policies that rely on closed loop sensory feedback. Other available datasets are missing at least one of these challenging properties. To address the challenge of diversity quantification, we introduce tractable metrics that provide valuable insights into a model's ability to acquire and reproduce diverse behaviors. These metrics offer a practical means to assess the robustness and versatility of imitation learning algorithms. Furthermore, we conduct a thorough evaluation of state-of-the-art methods on the proposed task suite. This evaluation serves as a benchmark for assessing their capability to learn diverse behaviors. Our findings shed light on the effectiveness of these methods in tackling the intricate problem of capturing and generalizing multi-modal human behaviors, offering a valuable reference for the design of future imitation learning algorithms. | Xiaogang Jia, Denis Blessing, Xinkai Jiang, Moritz Reuss, Atalay Donat, Rudolf Lioutikov, Gerhard Neumann |  |

Recent studies show that representations that preserve temporally ab- stract environment dynamics are successful in solving difficult problems and pro- vide theoretical guarantees for optimality. These methods however cannot scale to tasks where environment dynamics increase in complexity i.e. the temporally abstract transition relations depend on larger number of variables. On the other hand, other efforts have tried to use spatial abstraction to mitigate the previous issues. Their limitations include scalability to high dimensional environments and dependency on prior knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel three-layer HRL algorithm that introduces, at different levels of the hierarchy, both a spatial and a temporal goal abstraction. We provide a theoretical study of the regret bounds of the learned policies. We evaluate the approach on complex continuous control tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of spatial and temporal abstractions learned by this approach. | Mehdi Zadem, Sergio Mover, Sao Mai Nguyen |  |

The problem is challenging, however, as it requires both making predictions with arbitrary feature sets and learning a policy to identify the most valuable selections. Here, we take an information-theoretic perspective and prioritize features based on their mutual information with the response variable. The main challenge is implementing this policy, and we design a new approach that estimates the mutual information in a discriminative rather than a generative fashion. Building on our learning approach, we introduce several further improvements: allowing variable feature budgets across samples, enabling non-uniform costs between features, incorporating prior information, and exploring modern architectures to handle partial input information. We find that our method provides consistent gains over recent state-of-the-art methods across a variety of datasets. | Soham Gadgil, Ian Connick Covert, SuIn Lee |  |

However, due to their monolithic structure, it is challenging and expensive to augment them or impart new skills. On the other hand, due to their adaptation abilities,several new instances of these models are being trained towards new domains and tasks. In this work, we study the problem of efficient and practical composition of existing foundation models with more specific models to enable newer capabilities. To this end, we propose CALM—Composition to Augment Language Models—which introduces cross-attention between models to compose their representations and enable new capabilities. Salient features of CALM are: (i) Scales up LLMs on new tasks by ‘re-using’ existing LLMs along with a few additional parameters and data, (ii) Existing model weights are kept intact, and hence preserves existing capabilities, and (iii) Applies to diverse domains and settings. We illustrate that augmenting PaLM2-S with a smaller model trained on low-resource languages results in an absolute improvement of up to 13% on tasks like translation into English and arithmetic reasoning for low-resource languages. Similarly,when PaLM2-S is augmented with a code-specific model, we see a relative improvement of 40% over the base model for code generation and explanation tasks—on-par with fully fine-tuned counterparts. | Rachit Bansal, Bidisha Samanta, Siddharth Dalmia, Nitish Gupta, Sriram Ganapathy, Abhishek Bapna, Prateek Jain, Partha Talukdar |  |

In this work we show that recently proposed Neural Quadratic Models can exhibit the "catapult phase" Lewkowycz et al. (2020) that arises when training such models with large learning rates. We then empirically show that the behaviour of quadratic models parallels that of neural networks in generalization, especially in the catapult phase regime. Our analysis further demonstrates that quadratic models are an effective tool for analysis of neural networks. | Libin Zhu, Chaoyue Liu, Adityanarayanan Radhakrishnan, Mikhail Belkin |  |

We consider large-scale pre-training and downstream tasks on both experimental and predicted structures to enable the systematic evaluation of the quality of the learned structural representation and their usefulness in capturing functional relationships for downstream tasks. We find that: (1) large-scale pretraining on AlphaFold structures and auxiliary tasks consistently improve the performance of both rotation-invariant and equivariant GNNs, and (2) more expressive equivariant GNNs benefit from pretraining to a greater extent compared to invariant models. We aim to establish a common ground for the machine learning and computational biology communities to rigorously compare and advance protein structure representation learning. Our open-source codebase reduces the barrier to entry for working with large protein structure datasets by providing: (1) storage-efficient dataloaders for large-scale structural databases including AlphaFoldDB and ESM Atlas, as well as (2) utilities for constructing new tasks from the entire PDB.

One crucial decision facing practitioners is how, if at all, to curate these ever-larger datasets. For example, the creators of the LAION-5B dataset chose to retain only image-caption pairs whose CLIP similarity score exceeded a designated threshold. In this paper, we propose a new state-of-the-art data filtering approach motivated by our observation that nearly $40\%$ of LAION's images contain text that overlaps significantly with the caption. Intuitively, such data could be wasteful as it incentivizes models to perform optical character recognition rather than learning visual features. However, naively removing all such data could also be wasteful, as it throws away images that contain visual features (in addition to overlapping text). Our simple and scalable approach, T-MARS (Text Masking and Re-Scoring), filters out only those pairs where the text dominates the remaining visual features---by first masking out the text and then filtering out those with a low CLIP similarity score of the masked image with original captions. Experimentally, T-MARS is the top ranked approach on Imagenet at \`\`medium scale'' of DataComp (a data filtering benchmark), and outperforms CLIP filtering by a margin of $6.5\%$ on ImageNet and $4.7\%$ on VTAB. Additionally, we show that the accuracy gains enjoyed by T-MARS linearly increase as data and compute are scaled exponentially. | Pratyush Maini, Sachin Goyal, Zachary Chase Lipton, J.

However, the PDF format leads to a loss of semantic information, particularly for mathematical expressions. We propose Nougat (Neural Optical Understanding for Academic Documents), a Visual Transformer model that performs an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) task for processing scientific documents into a markup language, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a new dataset of scientific documents. The proposed approach offers a promising solution to enhance the accessibility of scientific knowledge in the digital age, by bridging the gap between human- readable documents and machine-readable text. We release the models and code to accelerate future work on scientific text recognition. | Lukas Blecher, Guillem Cucurull, Thomas Scialom, Robert Stojnic |  |

In these tasks, models are trained on a set of strings encoding abstract relations, and are then tested out-of-distribution on data that contains symbols that did not appear in the training dataset. We prove that for any relational reasoning task in a large family of tasks, transformers learn the abstract relations and generalize to the test set when trained by gradient descent on sufficiently large quantities of training data. This is in contrast to classical fully-connected networks, which we prove fail to learn to reason. Our results inspire modifications of the transformer architecture that add only two trainable parameters per head, and that we empirically demonstrate improve data efficiency for learning to reason. | Enric BoixAdserà, Omid Saremi, Emmanuel Abbe, Samy Bengio, Etai Littwin, Joshua M.

Raven's Progressive Matrix (RPM) is widely used to probe abstract visual reasoning in machine intelligence, where models will analyze the underlying rules and select one image from candidates to complete the image matrix. Participators of RPM tests can show powerful reasoning ability by inferring and combining attribute-changing rules and imagining the missing images at arbitrary positions of a matrix. However, existing solvers can hardly manifest such an ability in realistic RPM tests. In this paper, we propose a deep latent variable model for answer generation problems through Rule AbstractIon and SElection (RAISE). RAISE can encode image attributes into latent concepts and abstract atomic rules that act on the latent concepts. When generating answers, RAISE selects one atomic rule out of the global knowledge set for each latent concept to constitute the underlying rule of an RPM. In the experiments of bottom-right and arbitrary-position answer generation, RAISE outperforms the compared solvers in most configurations of realistic RPM datasets. In the odd-one-out task and two held-out configurations, RAISE can leverage acquired latent concepts and atomic rules to find the rule-breaking image in a matrix and handle problems with unseen combinations of rules and attributes. | Fan Shi, Bin Li, Xiangyang Xue |  |
| 1205 |  |  [A Characterization Theorem for Equivariant Networks with Point-wise Activations](https://openreview.net/forum?id=79FVDdfoSR) |  | 0 | Equivariant neural networks have shown improved performance, expressiveness and sample complexity on symmetrical domains. But for some specific symmetries, representations, and choice of coordinates, the most common point-wise activations, such as ReLU, are not equivariant, hence they cannot be employed in the design of equivariant neural networks. The theorem we present in this paper describes all possibile combinations of representations, choice of coordinates and point-wise activations to obtain an equivariant layer, generalizing and strengthening existing characterizations. Notable cases of practical relevance are discussed as corollaries. Indeed, we prove that rotation-equivariant networks can only be invariant, as it happens for any network which is equivariant with respect to connected compact groups. Then, we discuss implications of our findings when applied to important instances of equivariant networks. First, we completely characterize permutation equivariant networks such as Invariant Graph Networks with point-wise nonlinearities and their geometric counterparts, highlighting a plethora of models whose expressive power and performance are still unknown. Second, we show that feature spaces of disentangled steerable convolutional neural networks are trivial representations. | Marco Pacini, Xiaowen Dong, Bruno Lepri, Gabriele Santin |  |
| 1206 |  |  [Think before you speak: Training Language Models With Pause Tokens](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ph04CRkPdC) |  | 0 | Language models generate responses by producing a series of tokens in immediate succession: the $(K+1)^{\rm th}$ token is an outcome of manipulating $K$ hidden vectors per layer, one vector per preceding token. What if instead we were to let the model manipulate say, $K+10$ hidden vectors, before it outputs the $(K+1)^{\rm th}$ token? We operationalize this idea by performing training and inference on language models with a (learnable) $\textit{pause}$ token, a sequence of which is appended to the input prefix. We then delay extracting the model's outputs until the last pause token is seen, thereby allowing the model to process extra computation before committing to an answer. We empirically evaluate $\textit{pause-training}$ on decoder-only models of 1B and 130M parameters with causal pretraining on C4, and on downstream tasks covering reasoning, question-answering, general understanding and fact recall. Our main finding is that inference-time delays show gains when the model is both pre-trained and finetuned with delays. For the 1B model, we witness gains on 8 of 9 tasks, most prominently, a gain of $18\\%$ EM score on the QA task of SQuAD, $8\\%$ on CommonSenseQA and $1\\%$ accuracy on the reasoning task of GSM8k. Our work raises a range of conceptual and practical future research questions on making delayed next-token prediction a widely applicable new paradigm. | Sachin Goyal, Ziwei Ji, Ankit Singh Rawat, Aditya Krishna Menon, Sanjiv Kumar, Vaishnavh Nagarajan |  |

Reasoning on graphs is essential for drawing inferences about the relationships between entities in a complex system, and to identify hidden patterns and trends. Despite the remarkable progress in automated reasoning with natural text, reasoning on graphs with large language models (LLMs) remains an understudied problem. In this work, we perform the first comprehensive study of encoding graph-structured data as text for consumption by LLMs. We show that LLM performance on graph reasoning tasks varies on three fundamental levels: (1) the graph encoding method, (2) the nature of the graph task itself, and (3) interestingly, the very structure of the graph considered. These novel results provide valuable insight on strategies for encoding graphs as text. Using these insights we illustrate how the correct choice of encoders can boost performance on graph reasoning tasks inside LLMs by 4.8% to 61.8%, depending on the task. | Bahare Fatemi, Jonathan Halcrow, Bryan Perozzi |  |

In this work, we initiate the study of privacy-preserving alignment of LLMs through Differential Privacy (DP) in conjunction with RL. Following the influential work of Ziegler et al. (2020), we study two dominant paradigms: (i) alignment via RL without human in the loop (e.g., positive review generation) and (ii) alignment via RL from human feedback (RLHF) (e.g., summarization in a human-preferred way). We give a new DP framework to achieve alignment via RL, and prove its correctness. Our experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach, offering competitive utility while ensuring strong privacy protections. | Fan Wu, Huseyin A.

However, these models fail to generalize past the sequence length they were trained on. We present YaRN (Yet another RoPE extensioN method), a compute-efficient method to extend the context window of such models, requiring 10x less tokens and 2.5x less training steps than previous methods. Using YaRN, we show that LLaMA models can effectively utilize and extrapolate to context lengths much longer than their original pre-training would allow, while also surpassing previous the state-of-the-art at context window extension. In addition, we demonstrate that YaRN exhibits the capability to extrapolate beyond the limited context of a fine-tuning dataset. The models fine-tuned using YaRN has been made available and reproduced online up to 128k context length. | Bowen Peng, Jeffrey Quesnelle, Honglu Fan, Enrico Shippole |  |

One remarkable recent advancement is entropic regularization and the Sinkhorn algorithm, which utilizes only matrix scaling and guarantees an approximated solution with near-linear runtime. Despite the success of the Sinkhorn algorithm, its runtime may still be slow due to the potentially large number of iterations needed for convergence. To achieve possibly super-exponential convergence, we introduce Sinkhorn-Newton-Sparse (SNS), an extension to the Sinkhorn algorithm, by introducing early stopping for the matrix scaling steps and a second stage featuring a Newton-type subroutine. Adopting the variational viewpoint that the Sinkhorn algorithm maximizes a concave Lyapunov potential, we offer the insight that the Hessian matrix of the potential function is approximately sparse. Sparsification of the Hessian results in a fast $O(n^2)$ per-iteration complexity, the same as the Sinkhorn algorithm. In terms of total iteration count, we observe that the SNS algorithm converges orders of magnitude faster across a wide range of practical cases, including optimal transportation between empirical distributions and calculating the Wasserstein $W_1, W_2$ distance of discretized continuous densities. The empirical performance is corroborated by a rigorous bound on the approximate sparsity of the Hessian matrix. | Xun Tang, Michael Shavlovsky, Holakou Rahmanian, Elisa Tardini, Kiran Koshy Thekumparampil, Tesi Xiao, Lexing Ying |  |

Though the Transformer architecture has fundamentally no limits on the input sequence lengths it can process, the choice of position encoding used during training can limit the performance of these models on longer inputs. We propose a novel functional relative position encoding with progressive interpolation, FIRE, to improve Transformer generalization to longer contexts. We theoretically prove that this can represent some of the popular relative position encodings, such as T5's RPE, Alibi, and Kerple. We next empirically show that FIRE models have better generalization to longer contexts on both zero-shot language modeling and long text benchmarks. | Shanda Li, Chong You, Guru Guruganesh, Joshua Ainslie, Santiago Ontañón, Manzil Zaheer, Sumit Sanghai, Yiming Yang, Sanjiv Kumar, Srinadh Bhojanapalli |  |

However, these features often lack the spatial resolution to directly perform dense prediction tasks like segmentation and depth prediction because models aggressively pool information over large areas. In this work, we introduce FeatUp, a task- and model-agnostic framework to restore lost spatial information in deep features. We introduce two variants of FeatUp: one that guides features with high-resolution signal in a single forward pass, and one that fits an implicit model to a single image to reconstruct features at any resolution. Both approaches use a multi-view consistency loss with deep analogies to NeRFs. Our features retain their original semantics and can be swapped into existing applications to yield resolution and performance gains even without re-training. We show that FeatUp significantly outperforms other feature upsampling and image super-resolution approaches in class activation map generation, transfer learning for segmentation and depth prediction, and end-to-end training for semantic segmentation. | Stephanie Fu, Mark Hamilton, Laura E.

| 1213 |  |  [Masked Autoencoders with Multi-Window Local-Global Attention Are Better Audio Learners](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Q53QLftNkA) |  | 0 | In this work, we propose a Multi-Window Masked Autoencoder (MW-MAE) fitted with a novel Multi-Window Multi-Head Attention (MW-MHA) module that facilitates the modelling of local-global interactions in every decoder transformer block through attention heads of several distinct local and global windows. Empirical results on ten downstream audio tasks show that MW-MAEs consistently outperform standard MAEs in overall performance and learn better general-purpose audio representations, along with demonstrating considerably better scaling characteristics. Investigating attention distances and entropies reveals that MW-MAE encoders learn heads with broader local and global attention. Analyzing attention head feature representations through Projection Weighted Canonical Correlation Analysis (PWCCA) shows that attention heads with the same window sizes across the decoder layers of the MW-MAE learn correlated feature representations which enables each block to independently capture local and global information, leading to a decoupled decoder feature hierarchy. | Sarthak Yadav, Sergios Theodoridis, Lars Kai Hansen, ZhengHua Tan |  |
| 1214 |  |  [Toward Optimal Policy Population Growth in Two-Player Zero-Sum Games](https://openreview.net/forum?id=J2TZgj3Tac) |  | 0 | In competitive two-agent environments, deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods like Policy Space Response Oracles (PSRO) often increase exploitability between iterations, which is problematic when training in large games. To address this issue, we introduce anytime double oracle (ADO), an algorithm that ensures exploitability does not increase between iterations, and its approximate extensive-form version, anytime PSRO (APSRO). ADO converges to a Nash equilibrium while iteratively reducing exploitability. However, convergence in these algorithms may require adding all of a game's deterministic policies. To improve this, we propose Self-Play PSRO (SP-PSRO), which incorporates an approximately optimal stochastic policy into the population in each iteration. APSRO and SP-PSRO demonstrate lower exploitability and near-monotonic exploitability reduction in games like Leduc poker and Liar's Dice. Empirically, SP-PSRO often converges much faster than APSRO and PSRO, requiring only a few iterations in many games. | Stephen Marcus McAleer, JB Lanier, Kevin A.

| 1215 |  |  [Sparse Autoencoders Find Highly Interpretable Features in Language Models](https://openreview.net/forum?id=F76bwRSLeK) |  | 0 | One of the roadblocks to a better understanding of neural networks' internals is \textit{polysemanticity}, where neurons appear to activate in multiple, semantically distinct contexts. Polysemanticity prevents us from identifying concise, human-understandable explanations for what neural networks are doing internally. One hypothesised cause of polysemanticity is \textit{superposition}, where neural networks represent more features than they have neurons by assigning features to an overcomplete set of directions in activation space, rather than to individual neurons. Here, we attempt to identify those directions, using sparse autoencoders to reconstruct the internal activations of a language model. These autoencoders learn sets of sparsely activating features that are more interpretable and monosemantic than directions identified by alternative approaches, where interpretability is measured by automated methods. Moreover, we show that with our learned set of features, we can pinpoint the features that are causally responsible for counterfactual behaviour on the indirect object identification task \citep{wang2022interpretability} to a finer degree than previous decompositions. This work indicates that it is possible to resolve superposition in language models using a scalable, unsupervised method. Our method may serve as a foundation for future mechanistic interpretability work, which we hope will enable greater model transparency and steerability. | Robert Huben, Hoagy Cunningham, Logan Riggs Smith, Aidan Ewart, Lee Sharkey |  |
| 1216 |  |  [OVOR: OnePrompt with Virtual Outlier Regularization for Rehearsal-Free Class-Incremental Learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=FbuyDzZTPt) |  | 0 | Recent works have shown that by using large pre-trained models along with learnable prompts, rehearsal-free methods for class-incremental learning (CIL) settings can achieve superior performance to prominent rehearsal-based ones. Rehearsal-free CIL methods struggle with distinguishing classes from different tasks, as those are not trained together. In this work we propose a regularization method based on virtual outliers to tighten decision boundaries of the classifier, such that confusion of classes among different tasks is mitigated. Recent prompt-based methods often require a pool of task-specific prompts, in order to prevent overwriting knowledge of previous tasks with that of the new task, leading to extra computation in querying and composing an appropriate prompt from the pool. This additional cost can be eliminated, without sacrificing accuracy, as we reveal in the paper. We illustrate that a simplified prompt-based method can achieve results comparable to previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods equipped with a prompt pool, using much less learnable parameters and lower inference cost. Our regularization method has demonstrated its compatibility with different prompt-based methods, boosting those previous SOTA rehearsal-free CIL methods' accuracy on the ImageNet-R and CIFAR-100 benchmarks.

We prove one can decompose sampling from a density (minimal assumptions made on the density) into a sequence of sampling from log-concave conditional densities via accumulation of noisy measurements with equal noise levels. Our construction is unique in that it keeps track of a history of samples, making it non-Markovian as a whole, but it is lightweight algorithmically as the history only shows up in the form of a running empirical mean of samples. Our sampling algorithm generalizes walk-jump sampling (Saremi & Hyvärinen, 2019). The "walk" phase becomes a (non-Markovian) chain of (log-concave) Markov chains. The "jump" from the accumulated measurements is obtained by empirical Bayes. We study our sampling algorithm quantitatively using the 2-Wasserstein metric and compare it with various Langevin MCMC algorithms. We also report a remarkable capacity of our algorithm to "tunnel" between modes of a distribution. | Saeed Saremi, Ji Won Park, Francis R. Bach |  |

First, they can achieve a perfect fit to noisy training data and still generalize near-optimally, showing that overfitting can sometimes be benign. Second, they can undergo a period of classical, harmful overfitting---achieving a perfect fit to training data with near-random performance on test data---before transitioning (''grokking'') to near-optimal generalization later in training. In this work, we show that both of these phenomena provably occur in two-layer ReLU networks trained by GD on XOR cluster data where a constant fraction of the training labels are flipped. In this setting, we show that after the first step of GD, the network achieves 100\% training accuracy, perfectly fitting the noisy labels in the training data, but achieves near-random test accuracy. At a later training step, the network achieves near-optimal test accuracy while still fitting the random labels in the training data, exhibiting a ''grokking'' phenomenon. This provides the first theoretical result of benign overfitting in neural network classification when the data distribution is not linearly separable. Our proofs rely on analyzing the feature learning process under GD, which reveals that the network implements a non-generalizable linear classifier after one step and gradually learns generalizable features in later steps. | Zhiwei Xu, Yutong Wang, Spencer Frei, Gal Vardi, Wei Hu |  |

Many approaches attempt to find emotionally relevant domain-invariant features using domain adaptation (DA) to improve the accuracy of cross-subject ER. However, two problems still exist with these methods. First, only single-modal data (EEG) is utilized, ignoring the complementarity between multi-modal physiological signals. Second, these methods aim to completely match the signal features between different domains, which is difficult due to the extreme individual differences of EEG. To solve these problems, we introduce the complementarity of multi-modal physiological signals and propose a new method for cross-subject ER that does not align the distribution of signal features but rather the distribution of spatio-temporal relationships between features. We design a Variational Bayesian Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (VBH-GNN) with Relationship Distribution Adaptation (RDA). The RDA first aligns the domains by expressing the model space as a posterior distribution of a heterogeneous graph for a given source domain. Then, the RDA transforms the heterogeneous graph into an emotion-specific graph to further align the domains for the downstream ER task. Extensive experiments on two public datasets, DEAP and Dreamer, show that our VBH-GNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-subject scenarios. | Chenyu Liu, Xinliang Zhou, Zhengri Zhu, Liming Zhai, Ziyu Jia, Yang Liu |  |

However, transferring models trained on synthetic images to real-world applicationscan be challenging due to appearance disparities. A commonly employed solution to counter this Sim2Real gap is unsupervised domain adaptation, where models are trained using labeled Sim data and unlabeled Real data. Mispredictions made by such Sim2Real adapted models are often associated with miscalibration – stemming from overconfident predictions on real data. In this paper, we introduce AUGCAL, a simple training-time patch for unsupervised adaptation that improves Sim2Real adapted models by – (1) reducing overall miscalibration, (2) reducing overconfidence in incorrect predictions and (3) improving confidence score reliability by better guiding misclassification detection – all while retaining or improving Sim2Real performance. Given a base Sim2Real adaptation algorithm, at training time, AUGCAL involves replacing vanilla Sim images with strongly augmented views (AUG intervention) and additionally optimizing for a training time calibration loss on augmented Sim predictions (CAL intervention). We motivate AUGCAL using a brief analytical justification of how to reduce miscalibration on unlabeled REAL data. Through our experiments, we empirically show the efficacy of AUGCAL across multiple adaptation methods, backbones, tasks and shifts. | Prithvijit Chattopadhyay, Bharat Goyal, Boglarka Ecsedi, Viraj Prabhu, Judy Hoffman |  |

Quality-diversity (QD) search algorithms aim at such outcomes, by continually improving and diversifying a population of candidates. However, the applicability of QD to qualitative domains, like creative writing, has been limited by the difficulty of algorithmically specifying measures of quality and diversity. Interestingly, recent developments in language models (LMs) have enabled guiding search through \emph{AI feedback}, wherein LMs are prompted in natural language to evaluate qualitative aspects of text. Leveraging this development, we introduce Quality-Diversity through AI Feedback (QDAIF), wherein an evolutionary algorithm applies LMs to both generate variation and evaluate the quality and diversity of candidate text. When assessed on creative writing domains, QDAIF covers more of a specified search space with high-quality samples than do non-QD controls. Further, human evaluation of QDAIF-generated creative texts validates reasonable agreement between AI and human evaluation. Our results thus highlight the potential of AI feedback to guide open-ended search for creative and original solutions, providing a recipe that seemingly generalizes to many domains and modalities. In this way, QDAIF is a step towards AI systems that can independently search, diversify, evaluate, and improve, which are among the core skills underlying human society's capacity for innovation. | Herbie Bradley, Andrew Dai, Hannah Benita Teufel, Jenny Zhang, Koen Oostermeijer, Marco Bellagente, Jeff Clune, Kenneth O.

However, existing methods struggle to handle out-of-distribution (OOD) extrapolation errors, especially in sparse reward or scarce data settings. In this paper, we propose a novel training algorithm called Conservative Density Estimation (CDE), which addresses this challenge by explicitly imposing constraints on the state-action occupancy stationary distribution. CDE overcomes the limitations of existing approaches, such as the stationary distribution correction method, by addressing the support mismatch issue in marginal importance sampling. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the D4RL benchmark. Notably, CDE consistently outperforms baselines in challenging tasks with sparse rewards or insufficient data, demonstrating the advantages of our approach in addressing the extrapolation error problem in offline RL. | Zhepeng Cen, Zuxin Liu, Zitong Wang, Yihang Yao, Henry Lam, Ding Zhao |  |

However, it is well-known that certain tasks cannot be expressed by means of an objective in the Markov rewards formalism, motivating the study of alternative objective-specification formalisms in RL such as Linear Temporal Logic and Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning. To date, there has not yet been any thorough analysis of how these formalisms relate to each other in terms of their expressivity. We fill this gap in the existing literature by providing a comprehensive comparison of 17 salient objective-specification formalisms. We place these formalisms in a preorder based on their expressive power, and present this preorder as a Hasse diagram. We find a variety of limitations for the different formalisms, and argue that no formalism is both dominantly expressive and straightforward to optimise with current techniques. For example, we prove that each of Regularised RL, (Outer) Nonlinear Markov Rewards, Reward Machines, Linear Temporal Logic, and Limit Average Rewards can express a task that the others cannot. The significance of our results is twofold. First, we identify important expressivity limitations to consider when specifying objectives for policy optimization. Second, our results highlight the need for future research which adapts reward learning to work with a greater variety of formalisms, since many existing reward learning methods assume that the desired objective takes a Markovian form. Our work contributes towards a more cohesive understanding of the costs and benefits of different RL objective-specification formalisms. | Rohan Subramani, Marcus Williams, Max Heitmann, Halfdan Holm, Charlie Griffin, Joar Max Viktor Skalse |  |
| 1224 |  |  [Implicit Maximum a Posteriori Filtering via Adaptive Optimization](https://openreview.net/forum?id=auUngos7eR) |  | 0 | Bayesian filtering approximates the true underlying behavior of a time-varying system by inverting an explicit generative model to convert noisy measurements into state estimates. This process typically requires matrix storage, inversion, and multiplication or Monte Carlo estimation, none of which are practical in high-dimensional state spaces such as the weight spaces of artificial neural networks. Here, we consider the standard Bayesian filtering problem as optimization over a time-varying objective. Instead of maintaining matrices for the filtering equations or simulating particles, we specify an optimizer that defines the Bayesian filter implicitly. In the linear-Gaussian setting, we show that every Kalman filter has an equivalent formulation using K steps of gradient descent. In the nonlinear setting, our experiments demonstrate that our framework results in filters that are effective, robust, and scalable to high-dimensional systems, comparing well against the standard toolbox of Bayesian filtering solutions. We suggest that it is easier to fine-tune an optimizer than it is to specify the correct filtering equations, making our framework an attractive option for high-dimensional filtering problems. | Gianluca M.

However, the sensors of most legged robots can only provide partial and noisy observations, making the estimation particularly challenging, especially for external states like terrain frictions and elevation maps. Inspired by the classical Internal Model Control principle, we consider these external states as disturbances and introduce Hybrid Internal Model (HIM) to estimate them according to the response of the robot. The response, which we refer to as the hybrid internal embedding, contains the robot’s explicit velocity and implicit stability representation, corresponding to two primary goals for locomotion tasks: explicitly tracking velocity and implicitly maintaining stability. We use contrastive learning to optimize the embedding to be close to the robot’s successor state, in which the response is naturally embedded. HIM has several appealing benefits: It only needs the robot’s proprioceptions, i.e., those from joint encoders and IMU as observations. It innovatively maintains consistent observations between simulation reference and reality that avoids information loss in mimicking learning. It exploits batch-level information that is more robust to noises and keeps better sample efficiency. It only requires 1 hour of training on an RTX 4090 to enable a quadruped robot to traverse any terrain under any disturbances. A wealth of real-world experiments demonstrates its agility, even in high-difficulty tasks and cases never occurred during the training process, revealing remarkable open-world generalizability. | Junfeng Long, Zirui Wang, Quanyi Li, Liu Cao, Jiawei Gao, Jiangmiao Pang |  |
| 1226 |  |  [S2AC: Energy-Based Reinforcement Learning with Stein Soft Actor Critic](https://openreview.net/forum?id=rAHcTCMaLc) |  | 0 | Learning expressive stochastic policies instead of deterministic ones has been proposed to achieve better stability, sample complexity and robustness. Notably, in Maximum Entropy reinforcement learning (MaxEnt RL), the policy is modeled as an expressive energy-based model (EBM) over the Q-values. However, this formulation requires the estimation of the entropy of such EBM distributions which is an open problem. To address this, previous MaxEnt RL methods either implicitly estimate the entropy, yielding high computational complexity and variance (SQL), or follow a variational inference approach that fits simplified distributions (e.g., Gaussian) for tractability (SAC). We propose Sein Soft Actor-Critic (S$^2$AC), a MaxEnt RL algorithm that learns expressive policies without compromising efficiency. S$^2$AC uses parameterized Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) as the underlying policy. At the core of S$^2$AC is a new solution to the above open challenge of entropy computation for EBMs. Our entropy formula is computationally efficient and only depends on first-order derivatives and vector products. Empirical results show that S$^2$AC yields more optimal solutions to the MaxEnt objective than SQL and SAC in the multi-goal environment, and outperforms SAC and SQL on the MuJoCo benchmark.

| 1227 |  |  [A Newborn Embodied Turing Test for Comparing Object Segmentation Across Animals and Machines](https://openreview.net/forum?id=qhkEOCcVX9) |  | 0 | Newborn brains rapidly learn to solve challenging object recognition tasks, including segmenting objects from backgrounds and recognizing objects across novel backgrounds and viewpoints. Conversely, modern machine-learning (ML) algorithms are "data hungry," requiring more training data than brains to reach similar performance levels. How do we close this learning gap between brains and machines? Here we introduce a new benchmark—a Newborn Embodied Turing Test (NETT) for object segmentation—in which newborn animals and machines are raised in the same environments and tested with the same tasks, permitting direct comparison of their learning abilities. First, we raised newborn chicks in controlled environments containing a single object rotating on a single background, then tested their ability to recognize that object across new backgrounds and viewpoints. Second, we performed “digital twin” experiments in which we reared and tested artificial chicks in virtual environments that mimicked the rearing and testing conditions of the biological chicks. We inserted a variety of ML “brains” into the artificial chicks and measured whether those algorithms learned common object recognition behavior as biological chicks. All biological chicks solved this one-shot object segmentation task, successfully learning background-invariant object representations that generalized across new backgrounds and viewpoints. In contrast, none of the artificial chicks solved this object segmentation task, instead learning background-dependent representations that failed to generalize across new backgrounds and viewpoints. This digital twin design exposes core limitations in current ML algorithms in achieving brain-like object perception. Our NETT is publicly available for comparing ML algorithms with newborn chicks. Ultimately, we anticipate that NETT benchmarks will allow researchers to build embodied AI systems that learn as efficiently and robustly as newborn brains. | Manju Garimella, Denizhan Pak, Justin N.

These methods are challenged by sparsity of high-fitness samples in the training set, a problem that has been in the literature. A less recognized but equally important problem stems from the distribution of training samples in the design space: leading methods are not designed for scenarios where the desired optimum is in a region that is not only poorly represented in training data, but also relatively far from the highly represented low-fitness regions. We show that this problem of “separation” in the design space is a significant bottleneck in existing model-based optimization tools and propose a new approach that uses a novel VAE as its search model to overcome the problem. We demonstrate its advantage over prior methods in robustly finding improved samples, regardless of the imbalance and separation between low- and high-fitness samples. Our comprehensive benchmark on real and semi-synthetic protein datasets as well as solution design for physics-informed neural networks, showcases the generality of our approach in discrete and continuous design spaces.

| 1229 |  |  [Solving High Frequency and Multi-Scale PDEs with Gaussian Processes](https://openreview.net/forum?id=q4AEBLHuA6) |  | 0 | Machine learning based solvers have garnered much attention in physical simulation and scientific computing, with a prominent example, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). However, PINNs often struggle to solve high-frequency and multi-scale PDEs, which can be due to spectral bias during neural network training. To address this problem, we resort to the Gaussian process (GP) framework. To flexibly capture the dominant frequencies, we model the power spectrum of the PDE solution with a student $t$ mixture or Gaussian mixture. We apply the inverse Fourier transform to obtain the covariance function (by Wiener-Khinchin theorem). The covariance derived from the Gaussian mixture spectrum corresponds to the known spectral mixture kernel. Next, we estimate the mixture weights in the log domain, which we show is equivalent to placing a Jeffreys prior. It automatically induces sparsity, prunes excessive frequencies, and adjusts the remaining toward the ground truth. Third, to enable efficient and scalable computation on massive collocation points, which are critical to capture high frequencies, we place the collocation points on a grid, and multiply our covariance function at each input dimension. We use the GP conditional mean to predict the solution and its derivatives so as to fit the boundary condition and the equation itself. As a result, we can derive a Kronecker product structure in the covariance matrix. We use Kronecker product properties and multilinear algebra to promote computational efficiency and scalability, without low-rank approximations. We show the advantage of our method in systematic experiments.

| 1230 |  |  [OpenWebMath: An Open Dataset of High-Quality Mathematical Web Text](https://openreview.net/forum?id=jKHmjlpViu) |  | 0 | There is growing evidence that pretraining on high quality, carefully thought-out tokens such as code or mathematics plays an important role in improving the reasoning abilities of large language models. For example, Minerva, a PaLM model finetuned on billions of tokens of mathematical documents from arXiv and the web, reported dramatically improved performance on problems that require quantitative reasoning. However, because all known open source web datasets employ preprocessing that does not faithfully preserve mathematical notation, the benefits of large scale training on quantitive web documents are unavailable to the research community. We introduce OpenWebMath, an open dataset inspired by these works containing 14.7B tokens of mathematical webpages from Common Crawl. We describe in detail our method for extracting text and LaTeX content and removing boilerplate from HTML documents, as well as our methods for quality filtering and deduplication. Additionally, we run small-scale experiments by training 1.4B language models on OpenWebMath, showing that models trained on 14.7B tokens of our dataset surpass the performance of models trained on over 20x the amount of general language data. We hope that our dataset, open-sourced and released on the Hugging Face Hub, will help spur advances in the reasoning abilities of large language models. | Keiran Paster, Marco Dos Santos, Zhangir Azerbayev, Jimmy Ba |  |

We present an effective yet simple framework to extend the use of replays across multiple experiments, minimally adapting the RL workflow for sizeable improvements in controller performance and research iteration times. At its core, Replay across Experiments (RaE) involves reusing experience from previous experiments to improve exploration and bootstrap learning while reducing required changes to a minimum in comparison to prior work. We empirically show benefits across a number of RL algorithms and challenging control domains spanning both locomotion and manipulation, including hard exploration tasks from egocentric vision. Through comprehensive ablations, we demonstrate robustness to the quality and amount of data available and various hyperparameter choices. Finally, we discuss how our approach can be applied more broadly across research life cycles and can increase resilience by reloading data across random seeds or hyperparameter variations. | Dhruva Tirumala, Thomas Lampe, José Enrique Chen, Tuomas Haarnoja, Sandy H.

Recently, CLIP has emerged as an effective approach that employs vision-language contrastive pretraining to learn joint image and text representations and exhibits remarkable performance in zero-shot learning and text-guided natural image generation. Despite the substantial practical success of CLIP, its theoretical understanding remains elusive. In this paper, we formally study transferrable representation learning underlying CLIP and demonstrate how features from different modalities get aligned. We also analyze its zero-shot transfer performance on the downstream tasks. In addition, we conduct empirical evaluations on real data to back up our theory. Inspired by our analysis, we propose a new CLIP-type approach, which achieves better performance than CLIP and other state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets. | Zixiang Chen, Yihe Deng, Yuanzhi Li, Quanquan Gu |  |

Lately, generative models, especially diffusion models, have gained popularity in this area for their ability to produce realistic solutions and their good mathematical properties. Despite their success, an important drawback of diffusion models is their sensitivity to the choice of variance schedule, which controls the dynamics of the diffusion process. Fine-tuning this schedule for specific applications is crucial but time-consuming and does not guarantee an optimal result. We propose a novel approach for learning the schedule as part of the training process. Our method supports probabilistic conditioning on data, provides high-quality solutions, and is flexible, proving able to adapt to different applications with minimum overhead. This approach is tested in two unrelated inverse problems: super-resolution microscopy and quantitative phase imaging, yielding comparable or superior results to previous methods and fine-tuned diffusion models. We conclude that fine-tuning the schedule by experimentation should be avoided because it can be learned during training in a stable way that yields better results.

While major studies focus on learning system evolution on predefined static mesh discretizations, some methods utilize reinforcement learning or supervised learning techniques to create adaptive and dynamic meshes, due to the dynamic nature of these systems. However, these approaches face two primary challenges: (1) the need for expensive optimal mesh data, and (2) the change of the solution space's degree of freedom and topology during mesh refinement. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a neural PDE solver with a neural mesh adapter. To begin with, we introduce a novel data-free neural mesh adaptor, called Data-free Mesh Mover (DMM), with two main innovations. Firstly, it is an operator that maps the solution to adaptive meshes and is trained using the Monge-Ampère equation without optimal mesh data. Secondly, it dynamically changes the mesh by moving existing nodes rather than adding or deleting nodes and edges. Theoretical analysis shows that meshes generated by DMM have the lowest interpolation error bound. Based on DMM, to efficiently and accurately model dynamic systems, we develop a moving mesh based neural PDE solver (MM-PDE) that embeds the moving mesh with a two-branch architecture and a learnable interpolation framework to preserve information within the data. Empirical experiments demonstrate that our method generates suitable meshes and considerably enhances accuracy when modeling widely considered PDE systems.

| 1235 |  |  [From Latent Graph to Latent Topology Inference: Differentiable Cell Complex Module](https://openreview.net/forum?id=0JsRZEGZ7L) |  | 0 | Latent Graph Inference (LGI) relaxed the reliance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on a given graph topology by dynamically learning it. However, most of LGI methods assume to have a (noisy, incomplete, improvable, ...) input graph to rewire and can solely learn regular graph topologies. In the wake of the success of Topological Deep Learning (TDL), we study Latent Topology Inference (LTI) for learning higher-order cell complexes (with sparse and not regular topology) describing multi-way interactions between data points. To this aim, we introduce the Differentiable Cell Complex Module (DCM), a novel learnable function that computes cell probabilities in the complex to improve the downstream task. We show how to integrate DCM with cell complex message-passing networks layers and train it in an end-to-end fashion, thanks to a two-step inference procedure that avoids an exhaustive search across all possible cells in the input, thus maintaining scalability. Our model is tested on several homophilic and heterophilic graph datasets and it is shown to outperform other state-of-the-art techniques, offering significant improvements especially in cases where an input graph is not provided. | Claudio Battiloro, Indro Spinelli, Lev Telyatnikov, Michael M.

While the availability of genomes has vastly increased over the last decades, experimental annotation of the various functional, non-coding and regulatory elements encoded in the DNA sequence remains both expensive and challenging. This has sparked interest in unsupervised language modeling of genomic DNA, a paradigm that has seen great success for protein sequence data. Although various DNA language models have been proposed, evaluation tasks often differ between individual works, and might not fully recapitulate the fundamental challenges of genome annotation, including the length, scale and sparsity of the data. In this study, we introduce \*\*BEND\*\*, a \*\*BEN\*\*chmark for \*\*D\*\*NA language models, featuring a collection of realistic and biologically meaningful downstream tasks defined on the human genome.

GNNs have emerged as pivotal architectures in analyzing graph-structured data, and their expansive application in sensitive domains requires a comprehensive understanding of their decision-making processes --- necessitating a framework for GNN explainability. An explanation function for GNNs takes a pre-trained GNN along with a graph as input, to produce a \`sufficient statistic' subgraph with respect to the graph label. A main challenge in studying GNN explainability is to provide fidelity measures that evaluate the performance of these explanation functions. This paper studies this foundational challenge, spotlighting the inherent limitations of prevailing fidelity metrics, including $Fid_+$, $Fid_-$, and $Fid_\Delta$. Specifically, a formal, information-theoretic definition of explainability is introduced and it is shown that existing metrics often fail to align with this definition across various statistical scenarios. The reason is due to potential distribution shifts when subgraphs are removed in computing these fidelity measures. Subsequently, a robust class of fidelity measures are introduced, and it is shown analytically that they are resilient to distribution shift issues and are applicable in a wide range of scenarios. Extensive empirical analysis on both synthetic and real datasets are provided to illustrate that the proposed metrics are more coherent with gold standard metrics. | Xu Zheng, Farhad Shirani, Tianchun Wang, Wei Cheng, Zhuomin Chen, Haifeng Chen, Hua Wei, Dongsheng Luo |  |

Linear policies can justify their decisions while interacting in a dynamic environment, but their reduced expressivity prevents them from solving hard tasks. Instead, we argue for the use of piecewise-linear policies. We carefully study to what extent they can retain the interpretable properties of linear policies while reaching competitive performance with neural baselines. In particular, we propose the HyperCombinator (HC), a piecewise-linear neural architecture expressing a policy with a controllably small number of sub-policies. Each sub-policy is linear with respect to interpretable features, shedding light on the decision process of the agent without requiring an additional explanation model. We evaluate HC policies in control and navigation experiments, visualize the improved interpretability of the agent and highlight its trade-off with performance. Moreover, we validate that the restricted model class that the HyperCombinator belongs to is compatible with the algorithmic constraints of various reinforcement learning algorithms. | Maxime Wabartha, Joelle Pineau |  |

In this paper, we theoretically analyze the statistical properties of the benefits from feature learning in a two-layer linear neural network with multiple outputs in a high-dimensional setting. For that purpose, we propose a new criterion that allows feature learning of a two-layer linear neural network in a high-dimensional setting. Interestingly, we can show that models with smaller values of the criterion generalize even in situations where normal ridge regression fails to generalize. This is because the proposed criterion contains a proper regularization for the feature mapping and acts as an upper bound on the predictive risk. As an important characterization of the criterion, the two-layer linear neural network that minimizes this criterion can achieve the optimal Bayes risk that is determined by the distribution of the true signals across the multiple outputs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to specifically identify the conditions under which a model obtained by proper feature learning can outperform normal ridge regression in a high-dimensional multiple-output linear regression problem. | Keita Suzuki, Taiji Suzuki |  |
| 1240 |  |  [Neural Optimal Transport with General Cost Functionals](https://openreview.net/forum?id=gIiz7tBtYZ) |  | 0 | We introduce a novel neural network-based algorithm to compute optimal transport (OT) plans for general cost functionals. In contrast to common Euclidean costs, i.e., $\ell^1$ or $\ell^2$, such functionals provide more flexibility and allow using auxiliary information, such as class labels, to construct the required transport map. Existing methods for general cost functionals are discrete and do not provide an out-of-sample estimation. We address the challenge of designing a continuous OT approach for general cost functionals in high-dimensional spaces, such as images. We construct two example functionals: one to map distributions while preserving the class-wise structure and the other one to preserve the given data pairs. Additionally, we provide the theoretical error analysis for our recovered transport plans.

While numerous studies improve the overall GNNs' LP performance, none have explored their varying performance across different nodes and the underlying reasons. To this end, we demystify which nodes perform better from the perspective of their local topology. Despite the widespread belief that low-degree nodes exhibit worse LP performance, we surprisingly observe an inconsistent performance trend. This prompts us to propose a node-level metric, Topological Concentration (TC), based on the intersection of the local subgraph of each node with the ones of its neighbors. We empirically demonstrate that TC correlates with LP performance more than other node-level topological metrics, better identifying low-performing nodes than using degree. With TC, we discover a novel topological distribution shift issue in which nodes' newly joined neighbors tend to become less interactive with their existing neighbors, compromising the generalizability of node embeddings for LP at testing time. To make the computation of TC scalable, We further propose Approximated Topological Concentration (ATC) and justify its efficacy in approximating TC with reduced computation complexity. Given the positive correlation between node TC and its LP performance, we explore the potential of boosting LP performance via enhancing TC by re-weighting edges in the message-passing and discuss its effectiveness with limitations.

The conventional method for training stateful policies is Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT), which comes with significant drawbacks, such as slow training due to sequential gradient propagation and the occurrence of vanishing or exploding gradients. The gradient is often truncated to address these issues, resulting in a biased policy update. We present a novel approach for training stateful policies by decomposing the latter into a stochastic internal state kernel and a stateless policy, jointly optimized by following the stateful policy gradient. We introduce different versions of the stateful policy gradient theorem, enabling us to easily instantiate stateful variants of popular reinforcement learning and imitation learning algorithms. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis of our new gradient estimator and compare it with BPTT. We evaluate our approach on complex continuous control tasks, e.g. humanoid locomotion, and demonstrate that our gradient estimator scales effectively with task complexity while offering a faster and simpler alternative to BPTT. | Firas AlHafez, Guoping Zhao, Jan Peters, Davide Tateo |  |

While these methods efficiently leverage step information from environmental interaction, they often ignore the temporal correlation between actions, resulting in inefficient exploration and unsmooth trajectories that are challenging to implement on real hardware. Episodic RL (ERL) seeks to overcome these challenges by exploring in parameters space that capture the correlation of actions. However, these approaches typically compromise data efficiency, as they treat trajectories as opaque black boxes. In this work, we introduce a novel ERL algorithm, Temporally-Correlated Episodic RL (TCE), which effectively utilizes step information in episodic policy updates, opening the 'black box' in existing ERL methods while retaining the smooth and consistent exploration in parameter space. TCE synergistically combines the advantages of step-based and episodic RL, achieving comparable performance to recent ERL methods while maintaining data efficiency akin to state-of-the-art (SoTA) step-based RL. | Ge Li, Hongyi Zhou, Dominik Roth, Serge Thilges, Fabian Otto, Rudolf Lioutikov, Gerhard Neumann |  |

In natural conversations, repair mechanisms such as clarification requests are frequently used to improve mutual understanding. Here we explore the effects of conversational repair on languages emerging in signaling games. We extend the basic Lewis signaling game setup with a feedback channel that allows for the transmission of messages backwards from the receiver to the sender. Further, we add noise to the communication channel so that repair mechanisms become necessary for optimal performance. We find that languages emerging in setups with feedback channel are less compositional. However, the models still achieve a substantially higher generalization performance in conditions with noise, putting to question the role of compositionality for generalization. These findings generalize also to a more realistic case involving a guessing game with naturalistic images. More broadly speaking, this study provides an important step towards the creation of signaling games that more closely resemble the conditions under which human languages emerged. | Mitja Nikolaus |  |

However, state-of-the-art (SOTA) BNNs do not yield any sparsity, and induce a significant number of non-binary operations. On the other hand, activation sparsity can be provided by spiking neural networks (SNN), that too have gained significant traction in recent times. Thanks to this sparsity, SNNs when implemented on neuromorphic hardware, have the potential to be significantly more power-efficient compared to traditional artifical neural networks (ANN). However, SNNs incur multiple time steps to achieve close to SOTA accuracy. Ironically, this increases latency and energy---costs that SNNs were proposed to reduce---and presents itself as a major hurdle in realizing SNNs’ theoretical gains in practice. This raises an intriguing question: \*Can we obtain SNN-like sparsity and BNN-like accuracy and enjoy the energy-efficiency benefits of both?\* To answer this question, in this paper, we present a training framework for sparse binary activation neural networks (BANN) using a novel variant of the Hoyer regularizer. We estimate the threshold of each BANN layer as the Hoyer extremum of a clipped version of its activation map, where the clipping value is trained using gradient descent with our Hoyer regularizer. This approach shifts the activation values away from the threshold, thereby mitigating the effect of noise that can otherwise degrade the BANN accuracy. Our approach outperforms existing BNNs, SNNs, and adder neural networks (that also avoid energy-expensive multiplication operations similar to BNNs and SNNs) in terms of the accuracy-FLOPs trade-off for complex image recognition tasks. Downstream experiments on object detection further demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. Lastly, we demonstrate the portability of our approach to SNNs with multiple time steps.

Existing works tend to resort to the low-dimensional embedding space for efficiency and less risk of over-fitting. In this paper, we explore a new NE paradigm whose embedding dimension goes exponentially high w.r.t. the number of parameters, yet being very efficient and effective. Specifically, the node embeddings are represented as product states that lie in a super high-dimensional (e.g. $2^{32}$-dim) quantum Hilbert space, with a carefully designed optimization approach to guarantee the robustness to work in different scenarios. In the experiments, we show diverse virtues of our methods, including but not limited to: the overwhelming performance on downstream tasks against conventional low-dimensional NE baselines with the similar amount of computing resources, the super high efficiency for a fixed low embedding dimension (e.g. 512) with less than 1/200 memory usage, the robustness when equipped with different objectives and sampling strategies as a fundamental tool for future NE research. As a relatively unexplored topic in literature, the high-dimensional NE paradigm is demonstrated effective both experimentally and theoretically. | Hao Xiong, Yehui Tang, Yunlin He, Wei Tan, Junchi Yan |  |

However, accurately simulating large-scale systems at long time scales is computationally expensive due to the short time steps required for accurate integration. In this paper, we introduce an inference process that maps complex systems into a simplified representational space and models large jumps in time. To achieve this, we propose Time-lagged Information Bottleneck (T-IB), a principled objective rooted in information theory, which aims to capture relevant temporal features while discarding high-frequency information to simplify the simulation task and minimize the inference error. Our experiments demonstrate that T-IB learns information-optimal representations for accurately modeling the statistical properties and dynamics of the original process at a selected time lag, outperforming existing time-lagged dimensionality reduction methods. | Marco Federici, Patrick Forré, Ryota Tomioka, Bastiaan S.

While the original formulation assumes data exchangeability, some extensions handle non-exchangeable data, which is often the case in many real-world scenarios. In parallel, some progress has been made in conformal methods that provide statistical guarantees for a broader range of objectives, such as bounding the best $F_1$-score or minimizing the false negative rate in expectation. In this paper, we leverage and extend these two lines of work by proposing non-exchangeable conformal risk control, which allows controlling the expected value of any monotone loss function when the data is not exchangeable. Our framework is flexible, makes very few assumptions, and allows weighting the data based on its relevance for a given test example; a careful choice of weights may result in tighter bounds, making our framework useful in the presence of change points, time series, or other forms of distribution drift. Experiments with both synthetic and real world data show the usefulness of our method. | António Farinhas, Chrysoula Zerva, Dennis Ulmer, André F. T. Martins |  |

Recent studies have shown that the sequential decision-making problem is statistically learnable if it admits a low-rank structure modeled by predictive state representations (PSRs). Despite these advancements, existing approaches typically involve oracles or steps that are computationally intractable. On the other hand, the upper confidence bound (UCB) based approaches, which have served successfully as computationally efficient methods in bandits and MDPs, have not been investigated for more general PSRs, due to the difficulty of optimistic bonus design in these more challenging settings. This paper proposes the first known UCB-type approach for PSRs, featuring a novel bonus term that upper bounds the total variation distance between the estimated and true models. We further characterize the sample complexity bounds for our designed UCB-type algorithms for both online and offline PSRs. In contrast to existing approaches for PSRs, our UCB-type algorithms enjoy computational tractability, last-iterate guaranteed near-optimal policy, and guaranteed model accuracy. | Ruiquan Huang, Yingbin Liang, Jing Yang |  |

However, real data is typically only supported on a lower-dimensional manifold leading the model to expend significant compute on modeling noise. Injective Flows fix this by jointly learning a manifold and the distribution on it. So far, they have been limited by restrictive architectures and/or high computational cost. We lift both constraints by a new efficient estimator for the maximum likelihood loss, compatible with free-form bottleneck architectures. We further show that naively learning both the data manifold and the distribution on it can lead to divergent solutions, and use this insight to motivate a stable maximum likelihood training objective. We perform extensive experiments on toy, tabular and image data, demonstrating the competitive performance of the resulting model. | Peter Sorrenson, Felix Draxler, Armand Rousselot, Sander Hummerich, Lea Zimmermann, Ullrich Köthe |  |

However, clustering unlabeled images, as a fundamental and classic machine learning problem, still lacks an effective solution, particularly for large-scale datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel image clustering pipeline that leverages the powerful feature representation of large pre-trained models such as CLIP and cluster images effectively and efficiently at scale. We first developed a novel algorithm to estimate the number of clusters in a given dataset. We then show that the pre-trained features are significantly more structured by further optimizing the rate reduction objective. The resulting features may significantly improve the clustering accuracy, e.g., from 57\% to 66\% on ImageNet-1k. Furthermore, by leveraging CLIP's multimodality bridge between image and text, we develop a simple yet effective self-labeling algorithm that produces meaningful text labels for the clusters. Through extensive experiments, we show that our pipeline works well on standard datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1k. It also extends to datasets without predefined labels, such as LAION-Aesthetics and WikiArts. | Tianzhe Chu, Shengbang Tong, Tianjiao Ding, Xili Dai, Benjamin David Haeffele, René Vidal, Yi Ma |  |

Our daily choices, especially in domains like fashion and retail, are substantially shaped by multi-modal data, such as pictures and textual descriptions. These modalities not only offer intuitive guidance but also cater to personalized user preferences. However, the predominant personalization approaches mainly focus on ID or text-based recommendation problems, failing to comprehend the information spanning various tasks or modalities. In this paper, our goal is to establish a Unified paradigm for Multi-modal Personalization systems (UniMP), which effectively leverages multi-modal data while eliminating the complexities associated with task- and modality-specific customization. We argue that the advancements in foundational generative modeling have provided the flexibility and effectiveness necessary to achieve the objective. In light of this, we develop a generic and extensible personalization generative framework, that can handle a wide range of personalized needs including item recommendation, product search, preference prediction, explanation generation, and further user-guided image generation. Our methodology enhances the capabilities of foundational language models for personalized tasks by seamlessly ingesting interleaved cross-modal user history information, ensuring a more precise and customized experience for users. To train and evaluate the proposed multi-modal personalized tasks, we also introduce a novel and comprehensive benchmark covering a variety of user requirements. Our experiments on the real-world benchmark showcase the model's potential, outperforming competitive methods specialized for each task. | Tianxin Wei, Bowen Jin, Ruirui Li, Hansi Zeng, Zhengyang Wang, Jianhui Sun, Qingyu Yin, Hanqing Lu, Suhang Wang, Jingrui He, Xianfeng Tang |  |

However, equivariant graph functions cannot produce different outputs for similar nodes, which may be undesirable when the function is trying to optimize some global graph property. In this paper, we define orbit-equivariance, a relaxation of equivariance which allows for such functions whilst retaining important structural inductive biases. We situate the property in the hierarchy of graph functions, define a taxonomy of orbit-equivariant functions, and provide four different ways to achieve non-equivariant GNNs. For each, we analyze their expressivity with respect to orbit-equivariance and evaluate them on two novel datasets, one of which stems from a real-world use-case of designing optimal bioisosteres. | Matthew Morris, Bernardo Cuenca Grau, Ian Horrocks |  |

Some of these methods structurally resemble clustering algorithms, where the cluster's center in latent space serves as a slot representation. Slot Attention is an example of such a method, acting as a learnable analog of the soft k-means algorithm. Our work employs a learnable clustering method based on the Gaussian Mixture Model. Unlike other approaches, we represent slots not only as centers of clusters but also incorporate information about the distance between clusters and assigned vectors, leading to more expressive slot representations. Our experiments demonstrate that using this approach instead of Slot Attention improves performance in object-centric scenarios, achieving state-of-the-art results in the set property prediction task. | Daniil E.

How Reliable are Concept Removal Methods For Diffusion Models?](https://openreview.net/forum?id=lm7MRcsFiS) |  | 0 | Diffusion models for text-to-image (T2I) synthesis, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), have recently demonstrated exceptional capabilities for generating high-quality content. However, this progress has raised several concerns of potential misuse, particularly in creating copyrighted, prohibited, and restricted content, or NSFW (not safe for work) images. While efforts have been made to mitigate such problems, either by implementing a safety filter at the evaluation stage or by fine-tuning models to eliminate undesirable concepts or styles, the effectiveness of these safety measures in dealing with a wide range of prompts remains largely unexplored. In this work, we aim to investigate these safety mechanisms by proposing one novel concept retrieval algorithm for evaluation. We introduce Ring-A-Bell, a model-agnostic red-teaming scheme for T2I diffusion models, where the whole evaluation can be prepared in advance without prior knowledge of the target model. Specifically, Ring-A-Bell first performs concept extraction to obtain holistic representations for sensitive and inappropriate concepts. Subsequently, by leveraging the extracted concept, Ring-A-Bell automatically identifies problematic prompts for diffusion models with the corresponding generation of inappropriate content, allowing the user to assess the reliability of deployed safety mechanisms. Finally, we empirically validate our method by testing online services such as Midjourney and various methods of concept removal. Our results show that Ring-A-Bell, by manipulating safe prompting benchmarks, can transform prompts that were originally regarded as safe to evade existing safety mechanisms, thus revealing the defects of the so-called safety mechanisms which could practically lead to the generation of harmful contents. In essence, Ring-A-Bell could serve as a red-teaming tool to understand the limitations of deployed safety mechanisms and to explore the risk under plausible attacks.

However, how to fully leverage CLIP's unprecedented human-like understanding capabilities to achieve better performance is still an open question. This paper draws inspiration from the human visual perception process: when classifying an object, humans first infer contextual attributes (e.g., background and orientation) which help separate the foreground object from the background, and then classify the object based on this information. Inspired by it, we observe that providing CLIP with contextual attributes improves zero-shot image classification and mitigates reliance on spurious features. We also observe that CLIP itself can reasonably infer the attributes from an image. With these observations, we propose a training-free, two-step zero-shot classification method PerceptionCLIP. Given an image, it first infers contextual attributes (e.g., background) and then performs object classification conditioning on them. Our experiments show that PerceptionCLIP achieves better generalization, group robustness, and interpretability. | Bang An, Sicheng Zhu, MichaelAndrei PanaitescuLiess, Chaithanya Kumar Mummadi, Furong Huang |  |

In this work, we present Vector-based Random Matrix Adaptation (VeRA), which significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters compared to LoRA, yet maintains the same performance. It achieves this by using a single pair of low-rank matrices shared across all layers and learning small scaling vectors instead. We demonstrate its effectiveness on the GLUE and E2E benchmarks, image classification tasks, and show its application in instruction-tuning of 7B and 13B language models.

What if the actor also shares the goal (e.g. make fried rice) with us? The long-term action anticipation (LTA) task aims to predict an actor’s future behavior from video observations in the form of verb and noun sequences, and it is crucial for human-machine interaction. We propose to formulate the LTA task from two perspectives: a bottom-up approach that predicts the next actions autoregressively by modeling temporal dynamics; and a top-down approach that infers the goal of the actor and plans the needed procedure to accomplish the goal. We hypothesize that large language models (LLMs), which have been pretrained on procedure text data (e.g. recipes, how-tos), have the potential to help LTA from both perspectives. It can help provide the prior knowledge on the possible next actions, and infer the goal given the observed part of a procedure, respectively. We propose AntGPT, which represents video observations as sequences of human actions, and uses the action representation for an LLM to infer the goals and model temporal dynamics. AntGPT achieves state- of-the-art performance on Ego4D LTA v1 and v2, EPIC-Kitchens-55, as well as EGTEA GAZE+, thanks to LLMs’ goal inference and temporal dynamics modeling capabilities. We further demonstrate that these capabilities can be effectively distilled into a compact neural network 1.3% of the original LLM model size. Code and model will be released upon acceptance. | Qi Zhao, Shijie Wang, Ce Zhang, Changcheng Fu, Minh Quan Do, Nakul Agarwal, Kwonjoon Lee, Chen Sun |  |
| 1259 |  |  [A Plug-and-Play Image Registration Network](https://openreview.net/forum?id=DGez4B2a6Y) |  | 0 | Deformable image registration (DIR) is an active research topic in biomedical imaging. There is a growing interest in developing DIR methods based on deep learning (DL). A traditional DL approach to DIR is based on training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to estimate the registration field between two input images. While conceptually simple, this approach comes with a limitation that it exclusively relies on a pre-trained CNN without explicitly enforcing fidelity between the registered image and the reference. We present plug-and-play image registration network (PIRATE) as a new DIR method that addresses this issue by integrating an explicit data-fidelity penalty and a CNN prior. PIRATE pre-trains a CNN denoiser on the registration field and "plugs" it into an iterative method as a regularizer. We additionally present PIRATE+ that fine-tunes the CNN prior in PIRATE using deep equilibrium models (DEQ). PIRATE+ interprets the fixed-point iteration of PIRATE as a network with effectively infinite layers and then trains the resulting network end-to-end, enabling it to learn more task-specific information and boosting its performance. Our numerical results on OASIS and CANDI datasets show that our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance on DIR. | Junhao Hu, Weijie Gan, Zhixin Sun, Hongyu An, Ulugbek Kamilov |  |

Recently, neural operators have emerged as a promising technique to solve elliptic PDEs more efficiently by directly mapping the input to solutions. However, existing networks typically neglect complex geometries and inhomogeneous boundary values present in the real world. Here we introduce Boundary-Embedded Neural Operators (BENO), a novel neural operator architecture that embeds the complex geometries and inhomogeneous boundary values into the solving of elliptic PDEs. Inspired by classical Green's function, BENO consists of two Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for interior source term and boundary values, respectively. Furthermore, a Transformer encoder maps the global boundary geometry into a latent vector which influences each message passing layer of the GNNs. We test our model and strong baselines extensively in elliptic PDEs with complex boundary conditions. We show that all existing baseline methods fail to learn the solution operator. In contrast, our model, endowed with boundary-embedded architecture, outperforms state-of-the-art neural operators and strong baselines by an average of 60.96%. | Haixin Wang, Jiaxin Li, Anubhav Dwivedi, Kentaro Hara, Tailin Wu |  |

However, existing methods for this task are limited to point estimates of the potential outcomes, whereas uncertainty estimates have been ignored. Needless to say, uncertainty quantification is crucial for reliable decision-making in medical applications. To fill this gap, we propose a novel Bayesian neural controlled differential equation (BNCDE) for treatment effect estimation in continuous time. In our BNCDE, the time dimension is modeled through a coupled system of neural controlled differential equations and neural stochastic differential equations, where the neural stochastic differential equations allow for tractable variational Bayesian inference. Thereby, for an assigned sequence of treatments, our BNCDE provides meaningful posterior predictive distributions of the potential outcomes. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first tailored neural method to provide uncertainty estimates of treatment effects in continuous time. As such, our method is of direct practical value for promoting reliable decision-making in medicine. | Konstantin Hess, Valentyn Melnychuk, Dennis Frauen, Stefan Feuerriegel |  |

Unlike humans who establish a consensus on value judgments through social interaction, current language models (LMs) are trained to rigidly recite the corpus in social isolation, which causes poor generalization in unfamiliar cases and the lack of robustness under adversarial attacks. In this work, we introduce a new training paradigm that enables LMs to learn from simulated social interactions. Compared with existing methods, our method is much more scalable and efficient, and shows superior performance in alignment benchmarks and human evaluation. | Ruibo Liu, Ruixin Yang, Chenyan Jia, Ge Zhang, Diyi Yang, Soroush Vosoughi |  |

A recent study proposed to characterize this complexity by fitting accurate surrogate models to replicate the input-output relationship of a detailed biophysical cortical pyramidal neuron model and discovered it needed temporal convolutional networks (TCN) with millions of parameters. Requiring these many parameters, however, could stem from a misalignment between the inductive biases of the TCN and cortical neuron's computations. In light of this, and to explore the computational implications of leaky memory units and nonlinear dendritic processing, we introduce the Expressive Leaky Memory (ELM) neuron model, a biologically inspired phenomenological model of a cortical neuron. Remarkably, by exploiting such slowly decaying memory-like hidden states and two-layered nonlinear integration of synaptic input, our ELM neuron can accurately match the aforementioned input-output relationship with under ten thousand trainable parameters. To further assess the computational ramifications of our neuron design, we evaluate it on various tasks with demanding temporal structures, including the Long Range Arena (LRA) datasets, as well as a novel neuromorphic dataset based on the Spiking Heidelberg Digits dataset (SHD-Adding). Leveraging a larger number of memory units with sufficiently long timescales, and correspondingly sophisticated synaptic integration, the ELM neuron displays substantial long-range processing capabilities, reliably outperforming the classic Transformer or Chrono-LSTM architectures on LRA, and even solving the Pathfinder-X task with over 70\% accuracy (16k context length). These findings raise further questions about the computational sophistication of individual cortical neurons and their role in extracting complex long-range temporal dependencies. | Aaron Spieler, Nasim Rahaman, Georg Martius, Bernhard Schölkopf, Anna Levina |  |

However, existing incentive mechanisms naively assume the clients are truthful: they all report their true cost and thus the higher cost one participating client claims, the more the server has to pay. Therefore, such mechanisms are vulnerable to strategic clients aiming to optimize their own utility by misreporting. To address this issue, we propose an incentive compatible (i.e., truthful) communication protocol, named Truth-FedBan, where the incentive for each participant is independent of its self-reported cost, and reporting the true cost is the only way to achieve the best utility. More importantly, Truth-FedBan still guarantees the sub-linear regret and communication cost without any overhead. In other words, the core conceptual contribution of this paper is, for the first time, demonstrating the possibility of simultaneously achieving incentive compatibility and nearly optimal regret in federated bandit learning. Extensive numerical studies further validate the effectiveness of our proposed solution. | Zhepei Wei, Chuanhao Li, Tianze Ren, Haifeng Xu, Hongning Wang |  |

Today, wearable devices can conveniently record various biosignals, creating the opportunity to monitor health status without disruption to one's daily routine. Despite widespread use of wearable devices and existing digital biomarkers, the absence of curated data with annotated medical labels hinders the development of new biomarkers to measure common health conditions. In fact, medical datasets are usually small in comparison to other domains, which is an obstacle for developing neural network models for biosignals. To address this challenge, we have employed self-supervised learning using the unlabeled sensor data collected under informed consent from the large longitudinal Apple Heart and Movement Study (AHMS) to train foundation models for two common biosignals: photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) recorded on Apple Watch. We curated PPG and ECG datasets from AHMS that include data from ${\sim} 141$K participants spanning ${\sim} 3$ years. Our self-supervised learning framework includes participant level positive pair selection, stochastic augmentation module and a regularized contrastive loss optimized with momentum training, and generalizes well to both PPG and ECG modalities. We show that the pre-trained foundation models readily encode information regarding participants' demographics and health conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that builds foundation models using large-scale PPG and ECG data collected via wearable consumer devices $\textendash$ prior works have commonly used smaller-size datasets collected in clinical and experimental settings. We believe PPG and ECG foundation models can enhance future wearable devices by reducing the reliance on labeled data and hold the potential to help the users improve their health. | Salar Abbaspourazad, Oussama Elachqar, Andrew C.

We extend recent sampling-based approaches that leverage controlled stochastic processes to model approximate samples from these target densities. The main drawback of these approaches is that the training objective requires full trajectories to compute, resulting in sluggish credit assignment issues due to use of entire trajectories and a learning signal present only at the terminal time. In this work, we present Diffusion Generative Flow Samplers (DGFS), a sampling-based framework where the learning process can be tractably broken down into short partial trajectory segments, via parameterizing an additional \`\`flow function''. Our method takes inspiration from the theory developed for generative flow networks (GFlowNets), allowing us to make use of intermediate learning signals. Through various challenging experiments, we demonstrate that DGFS achieves more accurate estimates of the normalization constant than closely-related prior methods. | Dinghuai Zhang, Ricky T. Q.

Applying OPE to these domains is often challenging with scarce and underrepresentative offline training trajectories. Data augmentation has been a successful technique to enrich training data. However, directly employing existing data augmentation methods to OPE may not be feasible, due to the Markovian nature within the offline trajectories and the desire for generalizability across diverse target policies. In this work, we propose an offline trajectory augmentation approach to specifically facilitate OPE in human-involved scenarios. We propose sub-trajectory mining to extract potentially valuable sub-trajectories from offline data, and diversify the behaviors within those sub-trajectories by varying coverage of the state-action space. Our work was empirically evaluated in a wide array of environments, encompassing both simulated scenarios and real-world domains like robotic control, healthcare, and e-learning, where the training trajectories include varying levels of coverage of the state-action space. By enhancing the performance of a variety of OPE methods, our work offers a promising path forward for tackling OPE challenges in situations where data may be limited or underrepresentative. | Ge Gao, Qitong Gao, Xi Yang, Song Ju, Miroslav Pajic, Min Chi |  |

Namely, we show how to estimate the Wasserstein distance between two samples stored and kept on different devices/clients whilst a central entity/server orchestrates the computations (again, without having access to the samples). To achieve this feat, we take advantage of the geometric properties of the Wasserstein distance -- in particular, the triangle inequality -- and that of the associated {\em geodesics}: our algorithm, FedWad (for Federated Wasserstein Distance), iteratively approximates the Wasserstein distance by manipulating and exchanging distributions from the space of geodesics in lieu of the input samples. In addition to establishing the convergence properties of FedWad, we provide empirical results on federated coresets and federate optimal transport dataset distance, that we respectively exploit for building a novel federated model and for boosting performance of popular federated learning algorithms. | Alain Rakotomamonjy, Kimia Nadjahi, Liva Ralaivola |  |

Training a robotic agent to learn this sequence over many different starting conditions typically requires many iterations or demonstrations, especially in 3D environments. In this work, we propose Fourier Transporter ($\text{FourTran}$), which leverages the two-fold $\mathrm{SE}(d)\times\mathrm{SE}(d)$ symmetry in the pick-place problem to achieve much higher sample efficiency. $\text{FourTran}$ is an open-loop behavior cloning method trained using expert demonstrations to predict pick-place actions on new configurations. $\text{FourTran}$ is constrained by the symmetries of the pick and place actions independently. Our method utilizes a fiber space Fourier transformation that allows for memory-efficient computation. Tests on the RLbench benchmark achieve state-of-the-art results across various tasks. | Haojie Huang, Owen Howell, Dian Wang, Xupeng Zhu, Robert Platt, Robin Walters |  |

Our method integrates the expressivity of Clifford group-equivariant layers with simplicial message passing, which is topologically more intricate than regular graph message passing. Clifford algebras include higher-order objects such as bivectors and trivectors, which express geometric features (e.g., areas, volumes) derived from vectors. Using this knowledge, we represent simplex features through geometric products of their vertices. To achieve efficient simplicial message passing, we share the parameters of the message network across different dimensions. Additionally, we restrict the final message to an aggregation of the incoming messages from different dimensions, leading to what we term \*shared\* simplicial message passing. Experimental results show that our method is able to outperform both equivariant and simplicial graph neural networks on a variety of geometric tasks. | Cong Liu, David Ruhe, Floor Eijkelboom, Patrick Forré |  |

In this paper, we extend the scope of this effectiveness by showing that visual robot manipulation can significantly benefit from large-scale video generative pre-training. We introduce GR-1, a GPT-style model designed for multi-task language-conditioned visual robot manipulation. GR-1 takes as inputs a language instruction, a sequence of observation images, and a sequence of robot states. It predicts robot actions as well as future images in an end-to-end manner. Thanks to a flexible design, GR-1 can be seamlessly finetuned on robot data after pre-trained on a large-scale video dataset. We perform extensive experiments on the challenging CALVIN benchmark and a real robot. On CALVIN benchmark, our method outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods and improves the success rate from 88.9% to 94.9%. In the setting of zero-shot unseen scene generalization, GR-1 improves the success rate from 53.3% to 85.4%. In real robot experiments, GR-1 also outperforms baseline methods and shows strong potentials in generalization to unseen scenes and objects. We provide inaugural evidence that a unified GPT-style transformer, augmented with large-scale video generative pre-training, exhibits remarkable generalization to multi-task visual robot manipulation.

While supervised approaches rely on annotating triplets that is costly (i.e. query image, textual modification, and target image), recent research sidesteps this need by using large-scale vision-language models (VLMs), performing Zero-Shot CIR (ZS-CIR). However, state-of-the-art approaches in ZS-CIR still require training task-specific, customized models over large amounts of image-text pairs. In this work, we proposeto tackle CIR in a training-free manner via our Compositional Image Retrieval through Vision-by-Language (CIReVL), a simple, yet human-understandable and scalable pipeline that effectively recombines large-scale VLMs with large language models (LLMs). By captioning the reference image using a pre-trained generative VLM and asking a LLM to recompose the caption based on the textual target modification for subsequent retrieval via e.g. CLIP, we achieve modular language reasoning. In four ZS-CIR benchmarks, we find competitive, in-part state-of-the-art performance - improving over supervised methods Moreover, the modularity of CIReVL offers simple scalability without re-training, allowing us to both investigate scaling laws and bottlenecks for ZS-CIR while easily scaling up to in parts more than double of previously reported results. Finally, we show that CIReVL makes CIR human-understandable by composing image and text in a modular fashion in the language domain, thereby making it intervenable, allowing to post-hoc re-align failure cases. Code will be released upon acceptance. | Shyamgopal Karthik, Karsten Roth, Massimiliano Mancini, Zeynep Akata |  |

Under such a training regime, our finding is that, the oscillation of the NN weights caused by SGD with large learning rates turns out to be beneficial to the generalization of the NN, potentially improving over the same NN trained by SGD with small learning rates that converges more smoothly. In view of this finding, we call such a phenomenon “benign oscillation”. Our theory towards demystifying such a phenomenon builds upon the feature learning perspective of deep learning. Specifically, we consider a feature-noise data generation model that consists of (i) weak features which have a small $\ell_2$-norm and appear in each data point; (ii) strong features which have a large $\ell_2$-norm but appear only in a certain fraction of all data points; and (iii) noise. We prove that NNs trained by oscillating SGD with a large learning rate can effectively learn the weak features in the presence of those strong features. In contrast, NNs trained by SGD with a small learning rate can only learn the strong features but make little progress in learning the weak features. Consequently, when it comes to the new testing data points that consist of only weak features, the NN trained by oscillating SGD with a large learning rate can still make correct predictions, while the NN trained by SGD with a small learning rate could not. Our theory sheds light on how large learning rate training benefits the generalization of NNs. Experimental results demonstrate our findings on the phenomenon of “benign oscillation”. | Miao Lu, Beining Wu, Xiaodong Yang, Difan Zou |  |

This assumption is unrealistic since the collected time series data can be contaminated in practice. The forecasting model will be inferior if it is directly trained by time series with anomalies. Thus it is essential to develop methods to automatically learn a robust forecasting model from the contaminated data. In this paper, we first statistically define three types of anomalies, then theoretically and experimentally analyze the loss robustness and sample robustness when these anomalies exist. Based on our analyses, we propose a simple and efficient algorithm to learn a robust forecasting model. Extensive experiments show that our method is highly robust and outperforms all existing approaches.

While there has been significant work developing these methods, our understanding of the benefits and downsides of each stage in RLHF is still limited. To fill this gap, we present an extensive analysis of how each stage of the process (i.e. supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reward modelling, and RLHF) affects two key properties: out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation and output diversity. OOD generalisation is crucial given the wide range of real-world scenarios in which these models are being used, while output diversity refers to the model's ability to generate varied outputs and is important for a variety of use cases. We perform our analysis across two base models on both summarisation and instruction following tasks, the latter being highly relevant for current LLM use cases. We find that RLHF generalises better than SFT to new inputs, particularly as the distribution shift between train and test becomes larger. However, RLHF significantly reduces output diversity compared to SFT across a variety of measures, implying a tradeoff in current LLM fine-tuning methods between generalisation and diversity. Our results provide guidance on which fine-tuning method should be used depending on the application, and show that more research is needed to improve the tradeoff between generalisation and diversity. | Robert Kirk, Ishita Mediratta, Christoforos Nalmpantis, Jelena Luketina, Eric Hambro, Edward Grefenstette, Roberta Raileanu |  |

Previous methods have relied on domain-specific heuristics such as warping-based motion representation and 3D Morphable Models, which limit the naturalness and diversity of the generated avatars. In this work, we introduce GAIA (Generative AI for Avatar), which eliminates the domain priors in talking avatar generation. In light of the observation that the speech only drives the motion of the avatar while the appearance of the avatar and the background typically remain the same throughout the entire video, we divide our approach into two stages: 1) disentangling each frame into motion and appearance representations; 2) generating motion sequences conditioned on the speech and reference portrait image. We collect a large-scale high-quality talking avatar dataset and train the model on it with different scales (up to 2B parameters). Experimental results verify the superiority, scalability, and flexibility of GAIA as 1) the resulting model beats previous baseline models in terms of naturalness, diversity, lip-sync quality, and visual quality; 2) the framework is scalable since larger models yield better results; 3) it is general and enables different applications like controllable talking avatar generation and text-instructed avatar generation. | Tianyu He, Junliang Guo, Runyi Yu, Yuchi Wang, Jialiang Zhu, Kaikai An, Leyi Li, Xu Tan, Chunyu Wang, Han Hu, HsiangTao Wu, Sheng Zhao, Jiang Bian |  |

However, self-supervised approaches come with a notable limitation, dimensional collapse, where a model doesn't fully utilize its capacity to encode information optimally. Motivated by this, we propose ProSMin, a novel probabilistic self-supervised learning approach that leverages the power of probabilistic models to enhance representation quality and mitigate collapsing representations. Our proposed approach involves two neural networks, the online network and the target network, which collaborate and learn the diverse distribution of representations from each other through probabilistic knowledge distillation. The two networks are trained via our new loss function based on proper scoring rules. We provide a theoretical justification for ProSMin and demonstrate its modified scoring rule. This insight validates the method's optimization process and contributes to its robustness and effectiveness in improving representation quality. We evaluate our probabilistic model on various downstream tasks, such as in-distribution generalization, out-of-distribution detection, dataset corruption, low-shot learning, and transfer learning. Our method achieves superior accuracy and calibration, outperforming the self-supervised baseline in a variety of experiments on large datasets such as ImageNet-O and ImageNet-C. ProSMin thus demonstrates its scalability and real-world applicability.

As a consequence, generalization to unseen scenes and objects, rendering novel views from just a single or a handful of input images, and controllable scene generation that supports editing, is now possible. However, training jointly on a large number of scenes typically compromises rendering quality when compared to single-scene optimized models such as NeRFs. In this paper, we leverage recent progress in diffusion models to equip 3D scene representation learning models with the ability to render high-fidelity novel views, while retaining benefits such as object-level scene editing to a large degree. In particular, we propose DORSal, which adapts a video diffusion architecture for 3D scene generation conditioned on frozen object-centric slot-based representations of scenes. On both complex synthetic multi-object scenes and on the real-world large-scale Street View dataset, we show that DORSal enables scalable neural rendering of 3D scenes with object-level editing and improves upon existing approaches. | Allan Jabri, Sjoerd van Steenkiste, Emiel Hoogeboom, Mehdi S.

To address this, we propose T-Rep, a self-supervised method to learn time series representations at a timestep granularity. T-Rep learns vector embeddings of time alongside its feature extractor, to extract temporal features such as trend, periodicity, or distribution shifts from the signal. These time-embeddings are leveraged in pretext tasks, to incorporate smooth and fine-grained temporal dependencies in the representations, as well as reinforce robustness to missing data. We evaluate T-Rep on downstream classification, forecasting, and anomaly detection tasks. It is compared to existing self-supervised algorithms for time series, which it outperforms in all three tasks. We test T-Rep in missing data regimes, where it proves more resilient than its counterparts. Finally, we provide latent space visualisation experiments, highlighting the interpretability of the learned representations. | Archibald Fraikin, Adrien Bennetot, Stéphanie Allassonnière |  |

In finite time horizons such problems are relevant for instance for optimal stopping or specific supply chain problems, but also in the training of large language models. In contrast to infinite horizon MDPs optimal policies are not stationary, policies must be learned for every single epoch. In practice all parameters are often trained simultaneously, ignoring the inherent structure suggested by dynamic programming. This paper introduces a combination of dynamic programming and policy gradient called dynamical policy gradient, where the parameters are trained backwards in time. For the tabular softmax parametrisation we carry out the convergence analysis for simultaneous and dynamic policy gradient towards global optima, both in the exact and sampled gradient settings without regularisation. It turns out that the use of dynamic policy gradient training much better exploits the structure of finite-time problems which is reflected in improved convergence bounds. | Sara Klein, Simon Weissmann, Leif Döring |  |

Sparsification provides a solution to alleviate these resource constraints, and recent works have shown that trained models can be sparsified post-hoc. Existing sparsification techniques face challenges as they need additional data structures and offer constrained speedup with current hardware. In this paper we present SliceGPT, a new post-training sparsification scheme which replaces each weight matrix with a smaller (dense) matrix, reducing the embedding dimension of the network. Through extensive experimentation we show that SliceGPT can remove up to 25% of the model parameters (including embeddings) for LLAMA-2 70B, OPT 66B and Phi-2 models while maintaining 99%, 99% and 90% zero-shot task performance of the dense model respectively. Our sliced models run on fewer GPUs and run faster without any additional code optimization: on 24GB consumer GPUs we reduce the total compute for inference on LLAMA-2 70B to 64% of that of the dense model; on 40GB A100 GPUs we reduce it to 66%. We offer a new insight, computational invariance in transformer networks, which enables SliceGPT and we hope it will inspire and enable future avenues to reduce memory and computation demands for pre-trained models. | Saleh Ashkboos, Maximilian L.

Current approaches in experimental design focus on model-parameter estimation and require specification of a particular model, whereas in imaging, other tasks may drive the design. Furthermore, such approaches often lead to intractable optimization problems in real-world imaging applications. Here we present a new paradigm for experimental design that simultaneously optimizes the design (set of image channels) and trains a machine-learning model to execute a user-specified image-analysis task. The approach obtains data densely-sampled over the measurement space (many image channels) for a small number of acquisitions, then identifies a subset of channels of prespecified size that best supports the task. We propose a method: TADRED for TAsk-DRiven Experimental Design in imaging, to identify the most informative channel-subset whilst simultaneously training a network to execute the task given the subset. Experiments demonstrate the potential of TADRED in diverse imaging applications: several clinically-relevant tasks in magnetic resonance imaging; and remote sensing and physiological applications of hyperspectral imaging. Results show substantial improvement over classical experimental design, two recent application-specific methods within the new paradigm, and state-of-the-art approaches in supervised feature selection. We anticipate further applications of our approach. Code is available: https://github.com/sbb-gh/experimental-design-multichannel | Stefano B. Blumberg, Paddy J. Slator, Daniel C. Alexander |  |

Recent work (“A theory of representation learning gives a deep generalisation of kernel methods”, Yang et al. 2023) modified the Neural Network Gaussian Process (NNGP) limit of Bayesian neural networks so that representation learning is retained. Furthermore, they found that applying this modified limit to a deep Gaussian process gives a practical learning algorithm which they dubbed the “deep kernel machine” (DKM). However, they only considered the simplest possible setting: regression in small, fully connected networks with e.g. 10 input features. Here, we introduce convolutional deep kernel machines. This required us to develop a novel inter-domain inducing point approximation, as well as introducing and experimentally assessing a number of techniques not previously seen in DKMs, including analogues to batch normalisation, different likelihoods, and different types of top-layer. The resulting model trains in roughly 77 GPU hours, achieving around 99\% test accuracy on MNIST, 72\% on CIFAR-100, and 92.7\% on CIFAR-10, which is SOTA for kernel methods. | Edward Milsom, Ben Anson, Laurence Aitchison |  |

However, obtaining such annotations is expensive and can require up to hundreds of hours of manual labor. This poses a challenge, especially since such annotations can only be provided by experts, as they require knowledge about the scientific domain. To tackle this challenge, we propose a domain-specific weakly supervised object detection algorithm that only relies on image-level annotations, which are significantly easier to acquire. Our method distills the knowledge of a pre-trained model, on the task of predicting the presence or absence of a virus in an image, to obtain a set of pseudo-labels that can be used to later train a state-of-the-art object detection model. To do so, we use an optimization approach with a shrinking receptive field to extract virus particles directly without specific network architectures. Through a set of extensive studies, we show how the proposed pseudo-labels are easier to obtain, and, more importantly, are able to outperform other existing weak labeling methods, and even ground truth labels, in cases where the time to obtain the annotation is limited. | Hannah Kniesel, Leon Sick, Tristan Payer, Tim Bergner, Kavitha Shaga Devan, Clarissa Read, Paul Walther, Timo Ropinski, Pedro Hermosilla |  |

In this paper, we study automatic modeling and programming for complex operation research (OR) problems, so as to alleviate the heavy dependence on domain experts and benefit a spectrum of industry sectors. We present the first LLM-based solution, namely Chain-of-Experts (CoE), a novel multi-agent cooperative framework to enhance reasoning capabilities. Specifically, each agent is assigned a specific role and endowed with domain knowledge related to OR. We also introduce a conductor to orchestrate these agents via forward thought construction and backward reflection mechanism. Furthermore, we release a benchmark dataset (ComplexOR) of complex OR problems to facilitate OR research and community development. Experimental results show that CoE significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art LLM-based approaches both on LPWP and ComplexOR. | Ziyang Xiao, Dongxiang Zhang, Yangjun Wu, Lilin Xu, Yuan Jessica Wang, Xiongwei Han, Xiaojin Fu, Tao Zhong, Jia Zeng, Mingli Song, Gang Chen |  |

Yet a crucial question remains: How reliable is watermarking in realistic settings in the wild? There, watermarked text may be modified to suit a user's needs, or entirely rewritten to avoid detection. We study the robustness of watermarked text after it is re-written by humans, paraphrased by a non-watermarked LLM, or mixed into a longer hand-written document. We find that watermarks remain detectable even after human and machine paraphrasing. While these attacks dilute the strength of the watermark, paraphrases are statistically likely to leak n-grams or even longer fragments of the original text, resulting in high-confidence detections when enough tokens are observed. For example, after strong human paraphrasing the watermark is detectable after observing 800 tokens on average, when setting a $1\mathrm{e}{-5}$ false positive rate. We also consider a range of new detection schemes that are sensitive to short spans of watermarked text embedded inside a large document, and we compare the robustness of watermarking to other kinds of detectors. | John Kirchenbauer, Jonas Geiping, Yuxin Wen, Manli Shu, Khalid Saifullah, Kezhi Kong, Kasun Fernando, Aniruddha Saha, Micah Goldblum, Tom Goldstein |  |

This is evidenced by recent advancements towards developing models that satisfy robustness, safety, and fairness requirements. These requirements can be imposed (with generalization guarantees) by formulating constrained learning problems that can then be tackled by dual ascent algorithms. Yet, though these algorithms converge in objective value, even in non-convex settings, they cannot guarantee that their outcome is feasible. Doing so requires randomizing over all iterates, which is impractical in virtually any modern applications. Still, final iterates have been observed to perform well in practice. In this work, we address this gap between theory and practice by characterizing the constraint violation of Lagrangian minimizers associated with optimal dual variables, despite lack of convexity. To do this, we leverage the fact that non-convex, finite-dimensional constrained learning problems can be seen as parametrizations of convex, functional problems. Our results show that rich parametrizations effectively mitigate the issue of feasibility in dual methods, shedding light on prior empirical successes of dual learning. We illustrate our findings in fair learning tasks. | Juan Elenter, Luiz F. O. Chamon, Alejandro Ribeiro |  |

Hidden confounding can compromise the validity of any causal conclusion drawn from data and presents a major obstacle to effective offline RL. In the present paper, we tackle the problem of hidden confounding in the nonidentifiable setting. We propose a definition of uncertainty due to hidden confounding bias, termed delphic uncertainty, which uses variation over world models compatible with the observations, and differentiate it from the well-known epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. We derive a practical method for estimating the three types of uncertainties, and construct a pessimistic offline RL algorithm to account for them. Our method does not assume identifiability of the unobserved confounders, and attempts to reduce the amount of confounding bias. We demonstrate through extensive experiments and ablations the efficacy of our approach on a sepsis management benchmark, as well as on electronic health records. Our results suggest that nonidentifiable hidden confounding bias can be mitigated to improve offline RL solutions in practice. | Alizée Pace, Hugo Yèche, Bernhard Schölkopf, Gunnar Rätsch, Guy Tennenholtz |  |

This is key to measuring data \*\*memorization\*\* and information \*\*leakage\*\* as well as the \*\*influence\*\* of training data points in machine learning. We illustrate how our method broadens and refines existing empirical measures of memorization and privacy risks associated with training data. We use Gaussian processes to model the randomness of machine learning algorithms, and validate LOOD with extensive empirical analysis of leakage using membership inference attacks. Our analytical framework enables us to investigate the causes of leakage and where the leakage is high. For example, we analyze the influence of activation functions, on data memorization. Additionally, our method allows us to identify queries that disclose the most information about the training data in the leave-one-out setting. We illustrate how optimal queries can be used for accurate \*\*reconstruction\*\* of training data. | Jiayuan Ye, Anastasia Borovykh, Soufiane Hayou, Reza Shokri |  |

While parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods have been proposed and proven effective without retraining all model parameters, their performance is limited by the capacity of incremental modules, especially under constrained parameter budgets. To overcome this challenge, we propose CAPABOOST, a simple yet effective strategy that enhances model capacity by leveraging low-rank updates through parallel weight modules in target layers. By applying static random masks to the shared weight matrix, CAPABOOST constructs a diverse set of weight matrices, effectively increasing the rank of incremental weights without adding parameters. Notably, our approach can be seamlessly integrated into various existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. We extensively validate the efficacy of CAPABOOST through experiments on diverse downstream tasks, including natural language understanding, question answering, and image classification. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over baselines, without incurring additional computation or storage costs. We will make our code and benchmark publicly available. | Haobo Song, Hao Zhao, Soumajit Majumder, Tao Lin |  |

Visual perception, in particular, can now be decoded from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) with remarkable fidelity. This neuroimaging technique, however, suffers from a limited temporal resolution ($\approx$0.5\,Hz) and thus fundamentally constrains its real-time usage. Here, we propose an alternative approach based on magnetoencephalography (MEG), a neuroimaging device capable of measuring brain activity with high temporal resolution ($\approx$5,000 Hz). For this, we develop an MEG decoding model trained with both contrastive and regression objectives and consisting of three modules: i) pretrained embeddings obtained from the image, ii) an MEG module trained end-to-end and iii) a pretrained image generator. Our results are threefold: Firstly, our MEG decoder shows a 7X improvement of image-retrieval over classic linear decoders. Second, late brain responses to images are best decoded with DINOv2, a recent foundational image model. Third, image retrievals and generations both suggest that high-level visual features can be decoded from MEG signals, although the same approach applied to 7T fMRI also recovers better low-level features. Overall, these results, while preliminary, provide an important step towards the decoding - in real-time - of the visual processes continuously unfolding within the human brain. | Yohann Benchetrit, Hubert J.

However, their scalability is hampered by the quadratic time and memory complexity of the self-attention mechanism concerning the sequence length. This limitation poses a substantial obstacle when dealing with long documents or high-resolution images. In this work, we study the self-attention mechanism by analyzing the distribution of the attention matrix and its concentration ability. Furthermore, we propose instruments to measure these quantities and introduce a novel self-attention mechanism, Linear Log-Normal Attention, designed to emulate the distribution and concentration behavior of the original self-attention. Our experimental results on popular natural language benchmarks reveal that our proposed Linear Log-Normal Attention outperforms other linearized attention alternatives, offering a promising avenue for enhancing the scalability of transformer models. | Yury Nahshan, Joseph Kampeas, Emir Haleva |  |

Instead, it would be better to specify complex tasks in terms of elementary subtasks and to reuse subtask solutions whenever possible. In this work, we address continuous space lexicographic multi-objective RL problems, consisting of prioritized subtasks, which are notoriously difficult to solve. We show that these can be scalarized with a subtask transformation and then solved incrementally using value decomposition. Exploiting this insight, we propose prioritized soft Q-decomposition (PSQD), a novel algorithm for learning and adapting subtask solutions under lexicographic priorities in continuous state-action spaces. PSQD offers the ability to reuse previously learned subtask solutions in a zero-shot composition, followed by an adaptation step. Its ability to use retained subtask training data for offline learning eliminates the need for new environment interaction during adaptation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by presenting successful learning, reuse, and adaptation results for both low- and high-dimensional simulated robot control tasks, as well as offline learning results. In contrast to baseline approaches, PSQD does not trade off between conflicting subtasks or priority constraints and satisfies subtask priorities during learning. PSQD provides an intuitive framework for tackling complex RL problems, offering insights into the inner workings of the subtask composition. | Finn Rietz, Erik Schaffernicht, Stefan Heinrich, Johannes A.

Since the seminal works devoted to EBMs dating back to the noughties, there have been a lot of efficient methods which solve the generative modelling problem by means of energy potentials (unnormalized likelihood functions). In contrast, the realm of Optimal Transport (OT) and, in particular, neural OT solvers is much less explored and limited by few recent works (excluding WGAN-based approaches which utilize OT as a loss function and do not model OT maps themselves). In our work, we bridge the gap between EBMs and Entropy-regularized OT. We present a novel methodology which allows utilizing the recent developments and technical improvements of the former in order to enrich the latter. From the theoretical perspective, we prove generalization bounds for our technique. In practice, we validate its applicability in toy 2D and image domains. To showcase the scalability, we empower our method with a pre-trained StyleGAN and apply it to high-res AFHQ $512\times512$ unpaired I2I translation. For simplicity, we choose simple short- and long-run EBMs as a backbone of our Energy-guided Entropic OT approach, leaving the application of more sophisticated EBMs for future research.

Existing solutions concentrate on fine-tuning the pre-trained models on conventional image datasets. As a result of the success of recent pre-trained models derived from larger-scale datasets, it is challenging to adapt the model to the DML tasks in the local data domain while retaining the previously gained knowledge. In this paper, we investigate parameter-efficient methods for fine-tuning the pre-trained model for DML tasks. In particular, we propose a novel and effective framework based on learning Visual Prompts (VPT) in the pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViT). Based on the conventional proxy-based DML paradigm, we augment the proxy by incorporating the semantic information from the input image and the ViT, in which we optimize the visual prompts for each class. We demonstrate that our new approximations with semantic information are superior to representative capabilities, thereby improving metric learning performance. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that our proposed framework is superior and efficient by evaluating popular DML benchmarks. In particular, we demonstrate that our fine-tuning method achieves comparable or even better performance than recent state-of-the-art full fine-tuning works of DML while tuning only a small percentage of total parameters. | Li Ren, Chen Chen, Liqiang Wang, Kien A.

While unorthodox, fine-tuning large language models on text-encoded atomistic data is simple to implement yet reliable, with around 90\% of sampled structures obeying physical constraints on atom positions and charges. Using energy above hull calculations from both learned ML potentials and gold-standard DFT calculations, we show that our strongest model (fine-tuned LLaMA-2 70B) can generate materials predicted to be metastable at about twice the rate (49\% vs 28\%) of CDVAE, a competing diffusion model. Because of text prompting's inherent flexibility, our models can simultaneously be used for unconditional generation of stable material, infilling of partial structures and text-conditional generation. Finally, we show that language models' ability to capture key symmetries of crystal structures improves with model scale, suggesting that the biases of pretrained LLMs are surprisingly well-suited for atomistic data. | Nate Gruver, Anuroop Sriram, Andrea Madotto, Andrew Gordon Wilson, C.

However, limited text-3D data restricts the vocabulary scale and text control of generations. Generators may easily fall into a stereotype concept for certain text prompts, thus losing open-vocabulary generation ability. To tackle this issue, we introduce a conditional 3D generative model, namely TextField3D. Specifically, rather than using the text prompts as input directly, we suggest to inject dynamic noise into the latent space of given text prompts, i.e., Noisy Text Fields (NTFs). In this way, limited 3D data can be mapped to the appropriate range of textual latent space that is expanded by NTFs. To this end, an NTFGen module is proposed to model general text latent code in noisy fields. Meanwhile, an NTFBind module is proposed to align view-invariant image latent code to noisy fields, further supporting image-conditional 3D generation. To guide the conditional generation in both geometry and texture, multi-modal discrimination is constructed with a text-3D discriminator and a text-2.5D discriminator. Compared to previous methods, TextField3D includes three merits: 1) large vocabulary, 2) text consistency, and 3) low latency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a potential open-vocabulary 3D generation capability. | Tianyu Huang, Yihan Zeng, Bowen Dong, Hang Xu, Songcen Xu, Rynson W. H.

Continuous glucose monitors (CGM) are small medical devices that measure blood glucose levels at regular intervals providing insights into daily patterns of glucose variation. Forecasting of glucose trajectories based on CGM data holds the potential to substantially improve diabetes management, by both refining artificial pancreas systems and enabling individuals to make adjustments based on predictions to maintain optimal glycemic range. Despite numerous methods proposed for CGM-based glucose trajectory prediction, these methods are typically evaluated on small, private datasets, impeding reproducibility, further research, and practical adoption. The absence of standardized prediction tasks and systematic comparisons between methods has led to uncoordinated research efforts, obstructing the identification of optimal tools for tackling specific challenges. As a result, only a limited number of prediction methods have been implemented in clinical practice. To address these challenges, we present a comprehensive resource that provides (1) a consolidated repository of curated publicly available CGM datasets to foster reproducibility and accessibility; (2) a standardized task list to unify research objectives and facilitate coordinated efforts; (3) a set of benchmark models with established baseline performance, enabling the research community to objectively gauge new methods' efficacy; and (4) a detailed analysis of performance-influencing factors for model development. We anticipate these resources to propel collaborative research endeavors in the critical domain of CGM-based glucose predictions.

To counter these perturbations, robust multi-modal representations are highly expected, which are positioned well away from the discriminative multi-modal decision boundary. In this paper, different from conventional empirical studies, we focus on a commonly used joint multi-modal framework and theoretically discover that larger uni-modal representation margins and more reliable integration for modalities are essential components for achieving higher robustness. This discovery can further explain the limitation of multi-modal robustness and the phenomenon that multi-modal models are often vulnerable to attacks on the specific modality. Moreover, our analysis reveals how the widespread issue, that the model has different preferences for modalities, limits the multi-modal robustness by influencing the essential components and could lead to attacks on the specific modality highly effective. Inspired by our theoretical finding, we introduce a training procedure called Certifiable Robust Multi-modal Training (CRMT), which can alleviate this influence from modality preference and explicitly regulate essential components to significantly improve robustness in a certifiable manner. Our method demonstrates substantial improvements in performance and robustness compared with existing methods. Furthermore, our training procedure can be easily extended to enhance other robust training strategies, highlighting its credibility and flexibility. | Zequn Yang, Yake Wei, Ce Liang, Di Hu |  |

We establish theoretical lower bounds and prove that our algorithm achieves optimal convergence in both gradient and Hessian inexactness in this key setting. We further introduce a tensor generalization for stochastic higher-order derivatives. When the oracles are non-stochastic, the proposed tensor algorithm matches the global convergence of Nesterov Accelerated Tensor method. Both algorithms allow for approximate solutions of their auxiliary subproblems with verifiable conditions on the accuracy of the solution. | Artem Agafonov, Dmitry Kamzolov, Alexander V.

Virtual Nodes](https://openreview.net/forum?id=AcSChDWL6V) |  | 0 | Graph Transformers (GTs) such as SAN and GPS are graph processing models that combine Message-Passing GNNs (MPGNNs) with global Self-Attention. They were shown to be universal function approximators, with two reservations: 1. The initial node features must be augmented with certain positional encodings. 2. The approximation is non-uniform: Graphs of different sizes may require a different approximating network. We first clarify that this form of universality is not unique to GTs: Using the same positional encodings, also pure MPGNNs and even 2-layer MLPs are non-uniform universal approximators. We then consider uniform expressivity: The target function is to be approximated by a single network for graphs of all sizes. There, we compare GTs to the more efficient MPGNN + Virtual Node architecture. The essential difference between the two model definitions is in their global computation method: Self-Attention Vs Virtual Node. We prove that none of the models is a uniform-universal approximator, before proving our main result: Neither model’s uniform expressivity subsumes the other’s. We demonstrate the theory with experiments on synthetic data. We further augment our study with real-world datasets, observing mixed results which indicate no clear ranking in practice as well. | Eran Rosenbluth, Jan Tönshoff, Martin Ritzert, Berke Kisin, Martin Grohe |  |

However, it is often computationally expensive to compute exactly (exponential w.r.t. the number of data to valuate denoted by $n$). The existing generic estimator costs $O(n^2\log n)$ utility evaluations to achieve an $(\epsilon,\delta)$-approximation under the 2-norm, while faster estimators have been developed recently for special cases (e.g., empirically for the Shapley value and theoretically for the Banzhaf value). In this work, starting from the discovered connection between probabilistic values and least square regressions, we propose a Generic Estimator based on Least Squares (GELS) along with its variants that cost $O(n\log n)$ utility evaluations for many probabilistic values, largely extending the scope of this currently best complexity bound. Moreover, we show that each distributional value, proposed by Ghorbani et al. (2020) to alleviate the inconsistency of probabilistic values induced by using distinct databases, can also be cast as optimizing a similar least square regression. This observation leads to a theoretically-grounded framework TrELS (Training Estimators based on Least Squares) that can train estimators towards the specified distributional values without requiring any supervised signals. Particularly, the trained estimators are capable of predicting the corresponding distributional values for unseen data, largely saving the budgets required for running Monte-Carlo methods otherwise. Our experiments verify the faster convergence of GELS, and demonstrate the effectiveness of TrELS in learning distributional values.

Recently, several learning-based methods have been proposed for the task, exhibiting much faster docking speed than those computational methods. In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based method called ElliDock, which predicts an elliptic paraboloid to represent the protein-protein docking interface. To be specific, our model estimates elliptic paraboloid interfaces for the two input proteins respectively, and obtains the roto-translation transformation for docking by making two interfaces coincide. By its design, ElliDock is independently equivariant with respect to arbitrary rotations/translations of the proteins, which is an indispensable property to ensure the generalization of the docking process. Experimental evaluations show that ElliDock achieves the fastest inference time among all compared methods, and outperforms state-of-the-art learning-based methods, like DiffDock-PP and Alphafold-Multimer, for particularly antibody-antigen docking. | Ziyang Yu, Wenbing Huang, Yang Liu |  |

Existing incentive mechanisms often distribute post-training monetary rewards, which suffer from practical challenges of timeliness and feasibility of the rewards. Rewarding the clients after the completion of training may incentivize them to abort the collaboration, and monetizing the contribution is challenging in practice. To address these problems, we propose an incentive-aware algorithm that offers differentiated training-time model rewards for each client at each FL iteration. We theoretically prove that such a $\textit{local}$ design ensures the $\textit{global}$ objective of client incentivization. Through theoretical analyses, we further identify the issue of error propagation in model rewards and thus propose a stochastic reference-model recovery strategy to ensure theoretically that all the clients eventually obtain the optimal model in the limit. We perform extensive experiments to demonstrate the superior incentivizing performance of our method compared to existing baselines. | Zhaoxuan Wu, Mohammad Mohammadi Amiri, Ramesh Raskar, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low |  |

Since large-scale screens have to be divided into multiple experiments, a key difficulty is dealing with batch effects, which can introduce systematic errors and non-biological associations in the data. We propose InfoCORE, an Information maximization approach for COnfounder REmoval, to effectively deal with batch effects and obtain refined molecular representations. InfoCORE establishes a variational lower bound on the conditional mutual information of the latent representations given a batch identifier. It adaptively reweights samples to equalize their implied batch distribution. Extensive experiments on drug screening data reveal InfoCORE's superior performance in a multitude of tasks including molecular property prediction and molecule-phenotype retrieval. Additionally, we show results for how InfoCORE offers a versatile framework and resolves general distribution shifts and issues of data fairness by minimizing correlation with spurious features or removing sensitive attributes. | Chenyu Wang, Sharut Gupta, Caroline Uhler, Tommi S.

To discover similar neural architectures in an efficient and automatic manner, we define a new problem Neural Architecture Retrieval which retrieves a set of existing neural architectures which have similar designs to the query neural architecture. Existing graph pre-training strategies cannot address the computational graph in neural architectures due to the graph size and motifs. To fulfill this potential, we propose to divide the graph into motifs which are used to rebuild the macro graph to tackle these issues, and introduce multi-level contrastive learning to achieve accurate graph representation learning. Extensive evaluations on both human-designed and synthesized neural architectures demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm. Such a dataset which contains 12k real-world network architectures, as well as their embedding, is built for neural architecture retrieval. | Xiaohuan Pei, Yanxi Li, Minjing Dong, Chang Xu |  |

We consider a training dataset with well-separated input vectors: Any pair of input data with the same label are positively correlated, and any pair with different labels are negatively correlated. Our analysis shows that, during the early phase of training, neurons in the first layer try to align with either the positive data or the negative data, depending on its corresponding weight on the second layer. A careful analysis of the neurons' directional dynamics allows us to provide an $\mathcal{O}(\frac{\log n}{\sqrt{\mu}})$ upper bound on the time it takes for all neurons to achieve good alignment with the input data, where $n$ is the number of data points and $\mu$ measures how well the data are separated. After the early alignment phase, the loss converges to zero at a $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{t})$ rate, and the weight matrix on the first layer is approximately low-rank. Numerical experiments on the MNIST dataset illustrate our theoretical findings. | Hancheng Min, Enrique Mallada, René Vidal |  |

In our quest for effective uniformity metrics, we pinpoint four principled properties that such metrics should possess. Namely, an effective uniformity metric should remain invariant to instance permutations and sample replications while accurately capturing feature redundancy and dimensional collapse. Surprisingly, we find that the uniformity metric proposed by \citet{Wang2020UnderstandingCR} fails to satisfy the majority of these properties. Specifically, their metric is sensitive to sample replications, and can not account for feature redundancy and dimensional collapse correctly. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a new uniformity metric based on the Wasserstein distance, which satisfies all the aforementioned properties. Integrating this new metric in existing self-supervised learning methods effectively mitigates dimensional collapse and consistently improves their performance on downstream tasks involving CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets.

However, multi-agent RL (MARL) remains a challenge in terms of decentralization, partial observability and scalability to many agents. Meanwhile, collective behavior requires resolution of the aforementioned challenges, and remains of importance to many state-of-the-art applications such as active matter physics, self-organizing systems, opinion dynamics, and biological or robotic swarms. Here, MARL via mean field control (MFC) offers a potential solution to scalability, but fails to consider decentralized and partially observable systems. In this paper, we enable decentralized behavior of agents under partial information by proposing novel models for decentralized partially observable MFC (Dec-POMFC), a broad class of problems with permutation-invariant agents allowing for reduction to tractable single-agent Markov decision processes (MDP) with single-agent RL solution. We provide rigorous theoretical results, including a dynamic programming principle, together with optimality guarantees for Dec-POMFC solutions applied to finite swarms of interest. Algorithmically, we propose Dec-POMFC-based policy gradient methods for MARL via centralized training and decentralized execution, together with policy gradient approximation guarantees. In addition, we improve upon state-of-the-art histogram-based MFC by kernel methods, which is of separate interest also for fully observable MFC. We evaluate numerically on representative collective behavior tasks such as adapted Kuramoto and Vicsek swarming models, being on par with state-of-the-art MARL. Overall, our framework takes a step towards RL-based engineering of artificial collective behavior via MFC. | Kai Cui, Sascha Hauck, Christian Fabian, Heinz Koeppl |  |

However, directly training SNNs, even adopting batch normalization (BN), is highly challenging due to their non-differentiable activation function and the temporally delayed accumulation of outputs over time. For SNN training, this temporal accumulation gives rise to Temporal Covariate Shifts (TCS) along the temporal dimension, a phenomenon that would become increasingly pronounced with layer-wise computations across multiple layers and multiple time-steps. In this paper, we introduce TAB (Temporal Accumulated Batch Normalization), a novel SNN batch normalization method that addresses the temporal covariate shift issue by aligning with neuron dynamics (specifically the accumulated membrane potential) and utilizing temporal accumulated statistics for data normalization. Within its framework, TAB effectively encapsulates the historical temporal dependencies that underlie the membrane potential accumulation process, thereby establishing a natural connection between neuron dynamics and TAB batch normalization. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and DVS-CIFAR10 show that our TAB method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. | Haiyan Jiang, Vincent Zoonekynd, Giulia De Masi, Bin Gu, Huan Xiong |  |

In this work, we propose a simple yet effective training framework called Structural Compression (StructComp) to address this issue. Inspired by a sparse low-rank approximation on the diffusion matrix, StructComp trains the encoder with the compressed nodes. This allows the encoder not to perform any message passing during the training stage, and significantly reduces the number of sample pairs in the contrastive loss. We theoretically prove that the original GCL loss can be approximated with the contrastive loss computed by StructComp. Moreover, StructComp can be regarded as an additional regularization term for GCL models, resulting in a more robust encoder. Empirical studies on various datasets show that StructComp greatly reduces the time and memory consumption while improving model performance compared to the vanilla GCL models and scalable training methods. | Shengzhong Zhang, Wenjie Yang, Xinyuan Cao, Hongwei Zhang, Zengfeng Huang |  |

Diverse Sampling with Diffusion Models](https://openreview.net/forum?id=KqbCvIFBY7) |  | 0 | In light of the widespread success of generative models, a significant amount of research has gone into speeding up their sampling time. However, generative models are often sampled multiple times to obtain a diverse set incurring a cost that is orthogonal to sampling time. We tackle the question of how to improve diversity and sample efficiency by moving beyond the common assumption of independent samples. We propose particle guidance, an extension of diffusion-based generative sampling where a joint-particle time-evolving potential enforces diversity. We analyze theoretically the joint distribution that particle guidance generates, how to learn a potential that achieves optimal diversity, and the connections with methods in other disciplines. Empirically, we test the framework both in the setting of conditional image generation, where we are able to increase diversity without affecting quality, and molecular conformer generation, where we reduce the state-of-the-art median error by 13% on average. | Gabriele Corso, Yilun Xu, Valentin De Bortoli, Regina Barzilay, Tommi S.

This usually involves a multi-step adversarial attack applied on each example during training. In this paper, we explore only constructing adversarial examples (AE) on a subset of the training examples. That is, we split the training set in two subsets $A$ and $B$, train models on both ($A\cup B$) but construct AEs only for examples in $A$. Starting with $A$ containing only a single class, we systematically increase the size of $A$ and consider splitting by class and by examples. We observe that: (i) adv. robustness transfers by difficulty and to classes in $B$ that have never been adv. attacked during training, (ii) we observe a tendency for hard examples to provide better robustness transfer than easy examples, yet find this tendency to diminish with increasing complexity of datasets (iii) generating AEs on only $50$% of training data is sufficient to recover most of the baseline AT performance even on ImageNet. We observe similar transfer properties across tasks, where generating AEs on only $30$% of data can recover baseline robustness on the target task. We evaluate our subset analysis on a wide variety of image datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-200 and show transfer to SVHN, Oxford-Flowers-102 and Caltech-256. In contrast to conventional practice, our experiments indicate that the utility of computing AEs varies by class and examples and that weighting examples from $A$ higher than $B$ provides high transfer performance.

Existing efforts to mine better pixel-level features attempt to explicitly model the categorical distribution, which fails to achieve optimal due to the significant pixel feature variance. Moreover, prior research endeavors have scarcely delved into the thorough analysis and meticulous handling of pixel-level variance, leaving semantic segmentation at a coarse granularity. In this work, we analyze the causes of pixel-level variance and introduce the concept of $\textbf{pixel learning}$ to concentrate on the tailored learning process of pixels to handle the pixel-level variance, enhancing the per-pixel recognition capability of segmentation models. Under the context of the pixel learning scheme, each image is viewed as a distribution of pixels, and pixel learning aims to pursue consistent pixel representation inside an image, continuously align pixels from different images (distributions), and eventually achieve consistent pixel representation for each category, even cross-domains. We proposed a pure pixel-level learning framework, namely PiXL, which consists of a pixel partition module to divide pixels into sub-domains, a prototype generation, a selection module to prepare targets for subsequent alignment, and a pixel alignment module to guarantee pixel feature consistency intra-/inter-images, and inter-domains. Extensive evaluations of multiple learning paradigms, including unsupervised domain adaptation and semi-/fully-supervised segmentation, show that PiXL outperforms state-of-the-art performances, especially when annotated images are scarce. Visualization of the embedding space further demonstrates that pixel learning attains a superior representation of pixel features.

Recently, a generalization result was provided for zeroth-order stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms through stability analysis. However, this result was limited to the vanilla 2-point zeroth-order estimate of Gaussian distribution used in SGD algorithms. To address these limitations, we propose a general proof framework for stability analysis that applies to convex, strongly convex, and non-convex conditions, and yields results for popular zeroth-order optimization algorithms, including SGD, GD, and SVRG, as well as various zeroth-order estimates, such as 1-point and 2-point with different distributions and coordinate estimates. Our general analysis shows that coordinate estimation can lead to tighter generalization bounds for SGD, GD, and SVRG versions of zeroth-order optimization algorithms, due to the smaller expansion brought by coordinate estimates to stability analysis. | Xinyue Liu, Hualin Zhang, Bin Gu, Hong Chen |  |

By modeling multi-label classification as a multi-task problem, this issue can be regarded as a negative transfer, which indicates challenges to achieve simultaneously satisfied performance across multiple tasks. In this work, we propose the Hybrid Sharing Query (HSQ), a transformer-based model that introduces the mixture-of-experts architecture to image multi-label classification. HSQ is designed to leverage label correlations while mitigating heterogeneity effectively. To this end, HSQ is incorporated with a fusion expert framework that enables it to optimally combine the strengths of task-specialized experts with shared experts, ultimately enhancing multi-label classification performance across most labels. Extensive experiments are conducted on two benchmark datasets, with the results demonstrating that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance and yields simultaneous improvements across most labels.

One popular model is the single-index model, in which labels are produced by composing an unknown linear projection with a possibly unknown scalar link function. Learning this model with SGD is relatively well-understood, whereby the so-called information exponent of the link function governs a polynomial sample complexity rate. However, extending this analysis to deeper or more complicated architectures remains challenging. In this work, we consider single index learning in the setting of symmetric neural networks. Under analytic assumptions on the activation and maximum degree assumptions on the link function, we prove that gradient flow recovers the hidden planted direction, represented as a finitely supported vector in the feature space of power sum polynomials. We characterize a notion of information exponent adapted to our setting that controls the efficiency of learning. | Aaron Zweig, Joan Bruna |  |

Two popular strategies are per-sample clipping, which clips the mini-batch gradient, and per-update clipping, which clips each user's model update. However, there has not been a thorough theoretical analysis of these two clipping methods. In this work, we rigorously analyze the impact of these two clipping techniques on the convergence of a popular federated learning algorithm FedAvg under standard stochastic noise and gradient dissimilarity assumptions. We provide a convergence guarantee given any arbitrary clipping threshold. Specifically, we show that per-sample clipping is guaranteed to converge to the neighborhood of the stationary point, with the size dependent on the stochastic noise, gradient dissimilarity, and clipping threshold. In contrast, the convergence to the stationary point can be guaranteed with a sufficiently small stepsize in per-update clipping at the cost of more communication rounds. We further provide insights into understanding the impact of the improved convergence analysis in the differentially private setting. | Bo Li, Xiaowen Jiang, Mikkel N.

An algorithm is sample-efficient if it uses a number of queries $n$ to the environment that is polynomial in the dimension $d$ of the problem. Adaptivity refers to the frequency at which queries are sent and feedback is processed to update the querying strategy. To investigate this interplay, we employ a learning framework that allows sending queries in $K$ batches, with feedback being processed and queries updated after each batch. This model encompasses the whole adaptivity spectrum, ranging from non-adaptive \`offline' ($K=1$) to fully adaptive ($K=n$) scenarios, and regimes in between. For the problems of policy evaluation and best-policy identification under $d$-dimensional linear function approximation, we establish $\Omega(\log \log d)$ lower bounds on the number of batches $K$ required for sample-efficient algorithms with $n = O(poly(d))$ queries. Our results show that just having adaptivity ($K>1$) does not necessarily guarantee sample-efficiency. Notably, the adaptivity-boundary for sample-efficiency is not between offline reinforcement learning ($K=1$), where sample-efficiency was known to not be possible, and adaptive settings. Instead, the boundary lies between different regimes of adaptivity and depends on the problem dimension. | Emmeran Johnson, Ciara PikeBurke, Patrick Rebeschini |  |

This connection has reignited interest in comprehending the specific graph properties effectively distinguishable by the $k$WL test. A central focus of research in this field revolves around determining the least dimensionality $k$, for which $k$WL can discern graphs with different number of occurrences of a pattern graph $p$. We refer to such a least $k$ as the WL-dimension of this pattern counting problem. This inquiry traditionally delves into two distinct counting problems related to patterns: subgraph counting and induced subgraph counting. Intriguingly, despite their initial appearance as separate challenges with seemingly divergent approaches, both of these problems are interconnected components of a more comprehensive problem: "graph motif parameters". In this paper, we provide a precise characterization of the WL-dimension of labeled graph motif parameters. As specific instances of this result, we obtain characterizations of the WL-dimension of the subgraph counting and induced subgraph counting problem for every labeled pattern $p$. Particularly noteworthy is our resolution of a problem left open in previous work concerning induced copies. We additionally demonstrate that in cases where the $k$WL test distinguishes between graphs with varying occurrences of a pattern $p$, the exact number of occurrences of $p$ can be computed uniformly using only local information of the last layer of a corresponding GNN. We finally delve into the challenge of recognizing the WL-dimension of various graph parameters. We give a polynomial time algorithm for determining the WL-dimension of the subgraph counting problem for given pattern $p$, answering an open question from previous work. We additionally show how to utilize deep results from the field of graph motif parameters, together with our characterization, to determine the WL-dimension of induced subgraph counting and counting $k$-graphlets. | Matthias Lanzinger, Pablo Barceló |  |

Conformal inference algorithms construct prediction sets guaranteed to contain the true label with high probability. These guarantees fail to hold in the face of distribution shift, which is precisely when reliable uncertainty quantification can be most useful. We propose a novel algorithm for constructing prediction sets with PAC guarantees in the label shift setting, where the probabilities of labels can differ between the source and target distributions. Our algorithm relies on constructing confidence intervals for importance weights by propagating uncertainty through a Gaussian elimination algorithm. We evaluate our approach on four datasets: the CIFAR-10 and ChestX-Ray image datasets, the tabular CDC Heart Dataset, and the AGNews text dataset. Our algorithm satisfies the PAC guarantee while producing smaller prediction set sizes compared to several baselines. | Wenwen Si, Sangdon Park, Insup Lee, Edgar Dobriban, Osbert Bastani |  |

This data can still be sensitive and empirical evidence suggests that SSL encoders memorize private information of their training data and can disclose them at inference time. Since existing theoretical definitions of memorization from supervised learning rely on labels, they do not transfer to SSL. To address this gap, we propose a framework for defining memorization within the context of SSL. Our definition compares the difference in alignment of representations for data points and their augmented views returned by both encoders that were trained on these data points and encoders that were not. Through comprehensive empirical analysis on diverse encoder architectures and datasets we highlight that even though SSL relies on large datasets and strong augmentations---both known in supervised learning as regularization techniques that reduce overfitting---still significant fractions of training data points experience high memorization. Through our empirical results, we show that this memorization is essential for encoders to achieve higher generalization performance on different downstream tasks. | Wenhao Wang, Muhammad Ahmad Kaleem, Adam Dziedzic, Michael Backes, Nicolas Papernot, Franziska Boenisch |  |
| 1323 |  |  [The Curse of Diversity in Ensemble-Based Exploration](https://openreview.net/forum?id=M3QXCOTTk4) |  | 0 | We uncover a surprising phenomenon in deep reinforcement learning: training a diverse ensemble of data-sharing agents -- a well-established exploration strategy -- can significantly impair the performance of the individual ensemble members when compared to standard single-agent training. Through careful analysis, we attribute the degradation in performance to the low proportion of self-generated data in the shared training data for each ensemble member, as well as the inefficiency of the individual ensemble members to learn from such highly off-policy data. We thus name this phenomenon \*the curse of diversity\*. We find that several intuitive solutions -- such as a larger replay buffer or a smaller ensemble size -- either fail to consistently mitigate the performance loss or undermine the advantages of ensembling. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of representation learning to counteract the curse of diversity with a novel method named Cross-Ensemble Representation Learning (CERL) in both discrete and continuous control domains. Our work offers valuable insights into an unexpected pitfall in ensemble-based exploration and raises important caveats for future applications of similar approaches. | Zhixuan Lin, Pierluca D'Oro, Evgenii Nikishin, Aaron C.

On the other hand, Polynomial Networks is a class of models that does not require activation functions, but have yet to perform on par with modern architectures. In this work, we aim close this gap and propose MONet, which relies \*solely\* on multilinear operators. The core layer of MONet, called Mu-Layer, captures multiplicative interactions of the elements of the input token. MONet captures high-degree interactions of the input elements and we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a series of image recognition and scientific computing benchmarks. The proposed model outperforms prior polynomial networks and performs on par with modern architectures. We believe that MONet can inspire further research on models that use entirely multilinear operations. | Yixin Cheng, Grigorios Chrysos, Markos Georgopoulos, Volkan Cevher |  |

Due to the statistical heterogeneities between sessions and animals, a new model is trained from scratch to infer the underlying dynamics for each new dataset. This is computationally expensive and does not fully leverage all the available data. Moreover, as these models get more complex, they can be challenging to train. In parallel, it is becoming common to use pre-trained models in the machine learning community for few shot and transfer learning. One major hurdle that prevents the re-use of generative models in neuroscience is the complex spatio-temporal structure of neural dynamics within and across animals. Interestingly, the underlying dynamics identified from different datasets on the same task are qualitatively similar. In this work, we exploit this observation and propose a source-free and unsupervised alignment approach that utilizes the learnt dynamics and enables the re-use of trained generative models. We validate our approach on simulations and show the efficacy of the alignment on neural recordings from the motor cortex obtained during a reaching task. | Ayesha Vermani, Il Memming Park, Josue Nassar |  |

Instruction tuning has proven effective for distilling LLMs into more cost-efficient models such as Alpaca and Vicuna. Yet such student models still trail the original LLMs by large margins in downstream applications. In this paper, we explore targeted distillation with mission-focused instruction tuning to train student models that can excel in a broad application class such as open information extraction. Using named entity recognition (NER) for case study, we show how ChatGPT can be distilled into much smaller UniversalNER models for open NER. For evaluation, we assemble the largest NER benchmark to date, comprising 43 datasets across 9 diverse domains such as biomedicine, programming, social media, law, finance. Without using any direct supervision, UniversalNER attains remarkable NER accuracy across tens of thousands of entity types, outperforming general instruction-tuned models such as Alpaca and Vicuna by over 30 absolute F1 points in average. With a tiny fraction of parameters, UniversalNER not only acquires ChatGPT's capability in recognizing arbitrary entity types, but also outperforms its NER accuracy by 7-9 absolute F1 points in average. Remarkably, UniversalNER even outperforms by a large margin state-of-the-art multi-task instruction-tuned systems such as InstructUIE, which uses supervised NER examples. We also conduct thorough ablation studies to assess the impact of various components in our distillation approach. We release the distillation recipe, data, and UniversalNER models to facilitate future research on targeted distillation. | Wenxuan Zhou, Sheng Zhang, Yu Gu, Muhao Chen, Hoifung Poon |  |

Inspired by the success of large pretrained models in vision and language domains, we reframe the analysis of large-scale, cellular-resolution neuronal spiking data into an auto-regressive spatiotemporal generation problem. Neuroformer is a multimodal, multitask generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) model that is specifically designed to handle the intricacies of data in systems neuroscience. It scales linearly with feature size, can process an arbitrary number of modalities, and is adaptable to downstream tasks, such as predicting behavior. We first trained Neuroformer on simulated datasets, and found that it both accurately predicted simulated neuronal circuit activity, and also intrinsically inferred the underlying neural circuit connectivity, including direction. When pretrained to decode neural responses, the model predicted the behavior of a mouse with only few-shot fine-tuning, suggesting that the model begins learning how to do so directly from the neural representations themselves, without any explicit supervision. We used an ablation study to show that joint training on neuronal responses and behavior boosted performance, highlighting the model's ability to associate behavioral and neural representations in an unsupervised manner. These findings show that Neuroformer can analyze neural datasets and their emergent properties, informing the development of models and hypotheses associated with the brain. | Antonis Antoniades, Yiyi Yu, Joseph Canzano, William Yang Wang, Spencer L.

Such a training paradigm is highly susceptible to the error in cumulative cost estimation since this estimation serves as the key bond connecting the primal and dual update processes. We show that this problem causes significant underestimation of cost when using off-policy methods, leading to the failure to satisfy the safety constraint. To address this issue, we propose conservative policy optimization, which learns a policy in a constraint-satisfying area by considering the uncertainty in cost estimation. This improves constraint satisfaction but also potentially hinders reward maximization. We then introduce local policy convexification to help eliminate such suboptimality by gradually reducing the estimation uncertainty. We provide theoretical interpretations of the joint coupling effect of these two ingredients and further verify them by extensive experiments. Results on benchmark tasks show that our method not only achieves an asymptotic performance comparable to state-of-the-art on-policy methods while using much fewer samples, but also significantly reduces constraint violation during training.

However, most current works consider a homogeneous scenario where all agents use identity sensors and perception models. In reality, heterogeneous agent types may continually emerge and inevitably face a domain gap when collaborating with existing agents. In this paper, we introduce a new open heterogeneous problem: how to accommodate continually emerging new heterogeneous agent types into collaborative perception, while ensuring high perception performance and low integration cost? To address this problem, we propose HEterogeneous ALliance (HEAL), a novel extensible collaborative perception framework. HEAL first establishes a unified feature space with initial agents via a novel multi-scale foreground-aware Pyramid Fusion network. When heterogeneous new agents emerge with previously unseen modalities or models, we align them to the established unified space with an innovative backward alignment. This step only involves individual training on the new agent type, thus presenting extremely low training costs and high extensibility. To enrich agents' data heterogeneity, we bring OPV2V-H, a new large-scale dataset with more diverse sensor types. Extensive experiments on OPV2V-H and DAIR-V2X datasets show that HEAL surpasses SOTA methods in performance while reducing the training parameters by 91.5\% when integrating 3 new agent types.

The dynamics of such systems are often best described using continuous-time stochastic processes. Unfortunately, most existing structure learning approaches assume that the underlying process evolves in discrete-time and/or observations occur at regular time intervals. These mismatched assumptions can often lead to incorrect learned structures and models. In this work, we introduce a novel structure learning method, SCOTCH, which combines neural stochastic differential equations (SDE) with variational inference to infer a posterior distribution over possible structures. This continuous-time approach can naturally handle both learning from and predicting observations at arbitrary time points. Theoretically, we establish sufficient conditions for an SDE and SCOTCH to be structurally identifiable, and prove its consistency under infinite data limits. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach leads to improved structure learning performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets compared to relevant baselines under regular and irregular sampling intervals. | Benjie Wang, Joel Jennings, Wenbo Gong |  |

However, for many real-world tasks, it is very difficult to manually specify a reward function that never incentivises undesirable behaviour. As a result, it is increasingly popular to use \*reward learning algorithms\*, which attempt to \*learn\* a reward function from data. However, the theoretical foundations of reward learning are not yet well-developed. In particular, it is typically not known when a given reward learning algorithm with high probability will learn a reward function that is safe to optimise. This means that reward learning algorithms generally must be evaluated empirically, which is expensive, and that their failure modes are difficult to anticipate in advance. One of the roadblocks to deriving better theoretical guarantees is the lack of good methods for \*quantifying\* the difference between reward functions. In this paper we provide a solution to this problem, in the form of a class of pseudometrics on the space of all reward functions that we call STARC (STAndardised Reward Comparison) metrics. We show that STARC metrics induce both an upper and a lower bound on worst-case regret, which implies that our metrics are tight, and that any metric with the same properties must be bilipschitz equivalent to ours. Moreover, we also identify a number of issues with reward metrics proposed by earlier works. Finally, we evaluate our metrics empirically, to demonstrate their practical efficacy. STARC metrics can be used to make both theoretical and empirical analysis of reward learning algorithms both easier and more principled. | Joar Max Viktor Skalse, Lucy Farnik, Sumeet Ramesh Motwani, Erik Jenner, Adam Gleave, Alessandro Abate |  |

GAIA proposes real-world questions that require a set of fundamental abilities such as reasoning, multi-modality handling, web browsing, and generally tool-use proficiency. GAIA questions are conceptually simple for humans yet challenging for most advanced AIs: we show that human respondents obtain 92% vs. 15% for GPT-4 equipped with plugins. This notable performance disparity contrasts with the recent trend of LLMs outperforming humans on tasks requiring professional skills in e.g. law or chemistry. GAIA’s philosophy departs from the current trend in AI benchmarks suggesting to target tasks that are ever more difficult for humans. We posit that the advent of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) hinges on a system’s capability to exhibit similar robustness as the average human does on such questions. Using GAIA’s methodology, we devise 466 questions and their answer. We release our questions while retaining answers to 300 of them to power a leader-board accessible at https://huggingface.co/gaia-benchmark. | Grégoire Mialon, Clémentine Fourrier, Thomas Wolf, Yann LeCun, Thomas Scialom |  |

The two fields are intertwined and should share a common programming framework to facilitate each other's development. However, none of the existing software in the fields can achieve this goal, because traditional brain simulators lack differentiability for training, while existing deep learning (DL) frameworks fail to capture the biophysical realism and complexity of brain dynamics. In this paper, we introduce BrainPy, a differentiable brain simulator developed using JAX and XLA, with the aim of bridging the gap between brain simulation and BIC. BrainPy expands upon the functionalities of JAX, a powerful AI framework, by introducing complete capabilities for flexible, efficient, and scalable brain simulation. It offers a range of sparse and event-driven operators for efficient and scalable brain simulation, an abstraction for managing the intricacies of synaptic computations, a modular and flexible interface for constructing multi-scale brain models, and an object-oriented just-in-time compilation approach to handle the memory-intensive nature of brain dynamics. We showcase the efficiency and scalability of BrainPy on benchmark tasks, and highlight its differentiable simulation for biologically plausible spiking models. | Chaoming Wang, Tianqiu Zhang, Sichao He, Hongyaoxing Gu, Shangyang Li, Si Wu |  |

We present FOSI, a novel meta-algorithm that improves the performance of any base first-order optimizer by efficiently incorporating second-order information during the optimization process. In each iteration, FOSI implicitly splits the function into two quadratic functions defined on orthogonal subspaces, then uses a second-order method to minimize the first, and the base optimizer to minimize the other. We formally analyze FOSI's convergence and the conditions under which it improves a base optimizer. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that FOSI improves the convergence rate and optimization time of first-order methods such as Heavy-Ball and Adam, and outperforms second-order methods (K-FAC and L-BFGS). | Hadar Sivan, Moshe Gabel, Assaf Schuster |  |

Although the field of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has made significant progress towards solving these systems, solutions for many agents often remain computationally infeasible and lack theoretical guarantees. Mean Field Games (MFGs) address both of these issues and can be extended to Graphon MFGs (GMFGs) to include network structures between agents. Despite their merits, the real world applicability of GMFGs is limited by the fact that graphons only capture dense graphs. Since most empirically observed networks show some degree of sparsity, such as power law graphs, the GMFG framework is insufficient for capturing these network topologies. Thus, we introduce the novel concept of Graphex MFGs (GXMFGs) which builds on the graph theoretical concept of graphexes. Graphexes are the limiting objects to sparse graph sequences that also have other desirable features such as the small world property. Learning equilibria in these games is challenging due to the rich and sparse structure of the underlying graphs. To tackle these challenges, we design a new learning algorithm tailored to the GXMFG setup. This hybrid graphex learning approach leverages that the system mainly consists of a highly connected core and a sparse periphery. After defining the system and providing a theoretical analysis, we state our learning approach and demonstrate its learning capabilities on both synthetic graphs and real-world networks. This comparison shows that our GXMFG learning algorithm successfully extends MFGs to a highly relevant class of hard, realistic learning problems that are not accurately addressed by current MARL and MFG methods. | Christian Fabian, Kai Cui, Heinz Koeppl |  |

However, many of them can be spurious, i.e., lose their predictive power under a distribution shift and consequently fail to generalize to out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Recently developed "diversification" methods (Lee et al., 2023; Pagliardini et al., 2023) approach this problem by finding multiple diverse hypotheses that rely on different features. This paper aims to study this class of methods and identify the key components contributing to their OOD generalization abilities. We show that (1) diversification methods are highly sensitive to the distribution of the unlabeled data used for diversification and can underperform significantly when away from a method-specific sweet spot. (2) Diversification alone is insufficient for OOD generalization. The choice of the used learning algorithm, e.g., the model's architecture and pretraining, is crucial. In standard experiments (classification on Waterbirds and Office-Home datasets), using the second-best choice leads to an up to 20\% absolute drop in accuracy. (3) The optimal choice of learning algorithm depends on the unlabeled data and vice versa i.e. they are co-dependent. (4) Finally, we show that, in practice, the above pitfalls cannot be alleviated by increasing the number of diverse hypotheses, the major feature of diversification methods. These findings provide a clearer understanding of the critical design factors influencing the OOD generalization abilities of diversification methods. They can guide practitioners in how to use the existing methods best and guide researchers in developing new, better ones. | Harold Benoit, Liangze Jiang, Andrei Atanov, Oguzhan Fatih Kar, Mattia Rigotti, Amir Zamir |  |

In parallel, VAE-based methods have been explored as probabilistic approaches for clustering tasks. At the intersection of these two research directions, we propose a novel multimodal VAE model in which the latent space is extended to learn data clusters, leveraging shared information across modalities. Our experiments show that our proposed model improves generative performance over existing multimodal VAEs, particularly for unconditional generation. Furthermore, we propose a post-hoc procedure to automatically select the number of true clusters thus mitigating critical limitations of previous clustering frameworks. Notably, our method favorably compares to alternative clustering approaches, in weakly-supervised settings. Finally, we integrate recent advancements in diffusion models into the proposed method to improve generative quality for real-world images. | Emanuele Palumbo, Laura Manduchi, Sonia Laguna, Daphné Chopard, Julia E.

Given recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their few-shot learning prowess, this paper introduces $\textbf{La}$nguage Models for $\textbf{Mo}$tion Control ($\textbf{LaMo}$), a general framework based on Decision Transformers to effectively use pre-trained Language Models (LMs) for offline RL. Our framework highlights four crucial components: (1) Initializing Decision Transformers with sequentially pre-trained LMs, (2) employing the LoRA fine-tuning method, in contrast to full-weight fine-tuning, to combine the pre-trained knowledge from LMs and in-domain knowledge effectively, (3) using the non-linear MLP transformation instead of linear projections, to generate embeddings, and (4) integrating an auxiliary language prediction loss during fine-tuning to stabilize the LMs and retain their original abilities on languages. Empirical results indicate $\textbf{LaMo}$ achieves state-of-the-art performance in sparse-reward tasks and closes the gap between value-based offline RL methods and decision transformers in dense-reward tasks. In particular, our method demonstrates superior performance in scenarios with limited data samples. | Ruizhe Shi, Yuyao Liu, Yanjie Ze, Simon Shaolei Du, Huazhe Xu |  |

We explore how machine learning can accelerate this process by learning a scoring function with a functional form that allows for more rapid optimization. Specifically, we define the scoring function to be the cross-correlation of multi-channel ligand and protein scalar fields parameterized by equivariant graph neural networks, enabling rapid optimization over rigid-body degrees of freedom with fast Fourier transforms. The runtime of our approach can be amortized at several levels of abstraction, and is particularly favorable for virtual screening settings with a common binding pocket. We benchmark our scoring functions on two simplified docking-related tasks: decoy pose scoring and rigid conformer docking. Our method attains similar but faster performance on crystal structures compared to the widely-used Vina and Gnina scoring functions, and is more robust on computationally predicted structures.

In coming years or decades, artificial general intelligence (AGI) may surpass human capabilities at many critical tasks. In this position paper, we examine the technical difficulty of fine-tuning hypothetical AGI systems based on pretrained deep models to pursue goals that are aligned with human interests. We argue that, if trained like today's most capable models, AGI systems could learn to act deceptively to receive higher reward, learn internally-represented goals which generalize beyond their fine-tuning distributions, and pursue those goals using power-seeking strategies. We review emerging evidence for these properties. AGIs with these properties would be difficult to align and may appear aligned even when they are not. | Richard Ngo, Lawrence Chan, Sören Mindermann |  |
| 1341 |  |  [Discovering Temporally-Aware Reinforcement Learning Algorithms](https://openreview.net/forum?id=MJJcs3zbmi) |  | 0 | Recent advancements in meta-learning have enabled the automatic discovery of novel reinforcement learning algorithms parameterized by surrogate objective functions. To improve upon manually designed algorithms, the parameterization of this learned objective function must be expressive enough to represent novel principles of learning (instead of merely recovering already established ones) while still generalizing to a wide range of settings outside of its meta-training distribution. However, existing methods focus on discovering objective functions that, like many widely used objective functions in reinforcement learning, do not take into account the total number of steps allowed for training, or “training horizon”. In contrast, humans use a plethora of different learning objectives across the course of acquiring a new ability. For instance, students may alter their studying techniques based on the proximity to exam deadlines and their self-assessed capabilities. This paper contends that ignoring the optimization time horizon significantly restricts the expressive potential of discovered learning algorithms. We propose a simple augmentation to two existing objective discovery approaches that allows the discovered algorithm to dynamically update its objective function throughout the agent’s training procedure, resulting in expressive schedules and increased generalization across different training horizons. In the process, we find that commonly used meta-gradient approaches fail to discover such adaptive objective functions while evolution strategies discover highly dynamic learning rules. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a wide range of tasks and analyze the resulting learned algorithms, which we find effectively balance exploration and exploitation by modifying the structure of their learning rules throughout the agent’s lifetime. | Matthew Thomas Jackson, Chris Lu, Louis Kirsch, Robert Tjarko Lange, Shimon Whiteson, Jakob Nicolaus Foerster |  |

Recent machine learning research efforts have focused on the application of screening various diseases using ECG signals. However, adapting to the application of screening disease is challenging in that labeled ECG data are limited. Achieving general representation through self-supervised learning (SSL) is a well-known approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data; however, a naive application of SSL to ECG data, without considering the spatial-temporal relationships inherent in ECG signals, may yield suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce ST-MEM (Spatio-Temporal Masked Electrocardiogram Modeling), designed to learn spatio-temporal features by reconstructing masked 12-lead ECG data. ST-MEM outperforms other SSL baseline methods in various experimental settings for arrhythmia classification tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that ST-MEM is adaptable to various lead combinations. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we show a spatio-temporal relationship within ECG data.

Constraining Deep Generative Models for Tabular Data](https://openreview.net/forum?id=tBROYsEz9G) |  | 0 | Deep Generative Models (DGMs) have been shown to be powerful tools for generating tabular data, as they have been increasingly able to capture the complex distributions that characterize them. However, to generate realistic synthetic data, it is often not enough to have a good approximation of their distribution, as it also requires compliance with constraints that encode essential background knowledge on the problem at hand. In this paper, we address this limitation and show how DGMs for tabular data can be transformed into Constrained Deep Generative Models (C-DGMs), whose generated samples are guaranteed to be compliant with the given constraints. This is achieved by automatically parsing the constraints and transforming them into a Constraint Layer (CL) seamlessly integrated with the DGM. Our extensive experimental analysis with various DGMs and tasks reveals that standard DGMs often violate constraints, some exceeding 95% non-compliance, while their corresponding C-DGMs are never non-compliant. Then, we quantitatively demonstrate that, at training time, C-DGMs are able to exploit the background knowledge expressed by the constraints to outperform their standard counterparts with up to 4.5% improvement in utility and detection. Further, we show how our CL does not necessarily need to be integrated at training time, as it can be also used as a guardrail at inference time, still producing some improvements in the overall performance of the models. Finally, we show that our CL does not hinder the sample generation time of the models. | Mihaela C. Stoian, Salijona Dyrmishi, Maxime Cordy, Thomas Lukasiewicz, Eleonora Giunchiglia |  |

Despite successful attacks, all previous methods, starting from reconstructing a single data point and then relaxing the single-image limit to batch level, are only tested under hard label constraints. Even for single-image reconstruction, we still lack an analysis-based algorithm to recover augmented soft labels. In this work, we change the focus from enlarging batchsize to investigating the hard label constraints, considering a more realistic circumstance where label smoothing and mixup techniques are used in the training process. In particular, we are the first to initiate a novel algorithm to simultaneously recover the ground-truth augmented label and the input feature of the last fully-connected layer from single-input gradients, and provide a necessary condition for any analytical-based label recovery methods. Extensive experiments testify to the label recovery accuracy, as well as the benefits to the following image reconstruction. We believe soft labels in classification tasks are worth further attention in gradient inversion attacks. | Yanbo Wang, Jian Liang, Ran He |  |

Many works have been written on surrogate models to replace numerical solvers for fluid flows with faster, learned, autoregressive models. However, the intricacies of turbulence in three dimensions necessitate training these models with very small time steps, while generating realistic flow states requires either long roll-outs with many steps and significant error accumulation or starting from a known, realistic flow state—something we aimed to avoid in the first place. Instead, we propose to approach turbulent flow simulation as a generative task directly learning the manifold of all possible turbulent flow states without relying on any initial flow state. For our experiments, we introduce a challenging 3D turbulence dataset of high-resolution flows and detailed vortex structures caused by various objects and derive two novel sample evaluation metrics for turbulent flows. On this dataset, we show that our generative model captures the distribution of turbulent flows caused by unseen objects and generates high-quality, realistic samples amenable for downstream applications without access to any initial state. | Marten Lienen, David Lüdke, Jan HansenPalmus, Stephan Günnemann |  |

Thus, we propose to explore the dense semantic information retained within LLMs' \textbf{IN}ternal \textbf{S}tates for halluc\textbf{I}nation \textbf{DE}tection (\textbf{INSIDE}). In particular, a simple yet effective \textbf{EigenScore} metric is proposed to better evaluate responses' self-consistency, which exploits the eigenvalues of responses' covariance matrix to measure the semantic consistency/diversity in the dense embedding space. Furthermore, from the perspective of self-consistent hallucination detection, a test time feature clipping approach is explored to truncate extreme activations in the internal states, which reduces overconfident generations and potentially benefits the detection of overconfident hallucinations. Extensive experiments and ablation studies are performed on several popular LLMs and question-answering (QA) benchmarks, showing the effectiveness of our proposal. | Chao Chen, Kai Liu, Ze Chen, Yi Gu, Yue Wu, Mingyuan Tao, Zhihang Fu, Jieping Ye |  |

Existing methods mainly resort to finetuning a pretrained generative model, where the identity-relevant information (e.g., the boy) and the identity-irrelevant information (e.g., the background or the pose of the boy) are entangled in the latent embedding space. However, the highly entangled latent embedding may lead to the failure of subject-driven text-to-image generation as follows: (i) the identity-irrelevant information hidden in the entangled embedding may dominate the generation process, resulting in the generated images heavily dependent on the irrelevant information while ignoring the given text descriptions; (ii) the identity-relevant information carried in the entangled embedding can not be appropriately preserved, resulting in identity change of the subject in the generated images. To tackle the problems, we propose DisenBooth, an identity-preserving disentangled tuning framework for subject-driven text-to-image generation. Specifically, DisenBooth finetunes the pretrained diffusion model in the denoising process. Different from previous works that utilize an entangled embedding to denoise each image, DisenBooth instead utilizes disentangled embeddings to respectively preserve the subject identity and capture the identity-irrelevant information. We further design the novel weak denoising and contrastive embedding auxiliary tuning objectives to achieve the disentanglement. Extensive experiments show that our proposed DisenBooth framework outperforms baseline models for subject-driven text-to-image generation with the identity-preserved embedding. Additionally, by combining the identity-preserved embedding and identity-irrelevant embedding, DisenBooth demonstrates more generation flexibility and controllability. | Hong Chen, Yipeng Zhang, Simin Wu, Xin Wang, Xuguang Duan, Yuwei Zhou, Wenwu Zhu |  |

Still, the algorithm requires weight symmetry and infinitesimal equilibrium perturbations, i.e., nudges, to yield unbiased gradient estimates. Both requirements are challenging to implement in physical systems. Yet, whether and how weight asymmetry contributes to bias is unknown because, in practice, its contribution may be masked by a finite nudge. To address this question, we study generalized EP, which can be formulated without weight symmetry, and analytically isolate the two sources of bias. For complex-differentiable non-symmetric networks, we show that bias due to finite nudge can be avoided by estimating exact derivatives via a Cauchy integral. In contrast, weight asymmetry induces residual bias through poor alignment of EP's neuronal error vectors compared to BP resulting in low task performance. To mitigate the latter issue, we present a new homeostatic objective that directly penalizes functional asymmetries of the Jacobian at the network's fixed point. This homeostatic objective dramatically improves the network's ability to solve complex tasks such as ImageNet 32$\times$32. Our results lay the theoretical groundwork for studying and mitigating the adverse effects of imperfections of physical networks on learning algorithms that rely on the substrate's relaxation dynamics. | Axel Laborieux, Friedemann Zenke |  |
| 1349 |  |  [Revisiting Data Augmentation in Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=EGQBpkIEuu) |  | 0 | Various data augmentation techniques have been recently proposed in image-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Although they empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of data augmentation for improving sample efficiency or generalization, which technique should be preferred is not always clear. To tackle this question, we analyze existing methods to better understand them and to uncover how they are connected. Notably, by expressing the variance of the Q-targets and that of the empirical actor/critic losses of these methods, we can analyze the effects of their different components and compare them. We furthermore formulate an explanation about how these methods may be affected by choosing different data augmentation transformations in calculating the target Q-values. This analysis suggests recommendations on how to exploit data augmentation in a more principled way. In addition, we include a regularization term called tangent prop, previously proposed in computer vision, but whose adaptation to DRL is novel to the best of our knowledge. We evaluate our proposition and validate our analysis in several domains. Compared to different relevant baselines, we demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in most environments and shows higher sample efficiency and better generalization ability in some complex environments. | Jianshu Hu, Yunpeng Jiang, Paul Weng |  |
| 1350 |  |  [Structural Inference with Dynamics Encoding and Partial Correlation Coefficients](https://openreview.net/forum?id=TKnzPdyeJu) |  | 0 | This paper introduces a novel approach to structural inference, combining a variational dynamics encoder with partial correlation coefficients. In contrast to prior methods, our approach leverages variational inference to encode node dynamics within latent variables, and structural reconstruction relies on the calculation of partial correlation coefficients derived from these latent variables. This unique design endows our method with scalability and extends its applicability to both one-dimensional and multi-dimensional feature spaces. Furthermore, by reorganizing latent variables according to temporal steps, our approach can effectively reconstruct directed graph structures. We validate our method through extensive experimentation on twenty datasets from a benchmark dataset and biological networks. Our results showcase the superior scalability, accuracy, and versatility of our proposed approach compared to existing methods. Moreover, experiments conducted on noisy data affirm the robustness of our method. | Aoran Wang, Jun Pang |  |

Despite the popularity of message passing in this field, it has limitations such as the need for graph rewiring, ambiguity in interpreting data, and over-smoothing. In this paper, we take a different approach, focusing on leveraging geometric information from simplicial complexes embedded in $\mathbb{R}^n$ using node coordinates. We use differential $k$-forms in $\mathbb{R}^n$ to create representations of simplices, offering interpretability and geometric consistency without message passing. This approach also enables us to apply differential geometry tools and achieve universal approximation. Our method is efficient, versatile, and applicable to various input complexes, including graphs, simplicial complexes, and cell complexes. It outperforms existing message passing neural networks in harnessing information from geometrical graphs with node features serving as coordinates. | Kelly Maggs, Celia Hacker, Bastian Rieck |  |

Existing research in the non-interactive and sequentially local models has focused on obtaining the lower bounds for the case where the underlying parameter is $1$-sparse, and extending such bounds to the more general $k$-sparse case has proven to be challenging. Moreover, it is unclear whether efficient non-interactive LDP (NLDP) algorithms exist. To address these issues, we first consider the problem in the $\epsilon$ non-interactive LDP model and provide a lower bound of $\Omega(\frac{\sqrt{dk\log d}}{\sqrt{n}\epsilon})$ on the $\ell_2$-norm estimation error for sub-Gaussian data, where $n$ is the sample size and $d$ is the dimension of the space. We propose an innovative NLDP algorithm, the very first of its kind for the problem. As a remarkable outcome, this algorithm also yields a novel and highly efficient estimator as a valuable by-product. Our algorithm achieves an upper bound of $\tilde{O}({\frac{d\sqrt{k}}{\sqrt{n}\epsilon}})$ for the estimation error when the data is sub-Gaussian, which can be further improved by a factor of $O(\sqrt{d})$ if the server has additional public but unlabeled data. For the sequentially interactive LDP model, we show a similar lower bound of $\Omega({\frac{\sqrt{dk}}{\sqrt{n}\epsilon}})$. As for the upper bound, we rectify a previous method and show that it is possible to achieve a bound of $\tilde{O}(\frac{k\sqrt{d}}{\sqrt{n}\epsilon})$. Our findings reveal fundamental differences between the non-private case, central DP model, and local DP model in the sparse linear regression problem. | Liyang Zhu, Meng Ding, Vaneet Aggarwal, Jinhui Xu, Di Wang |  |

Efforts have been made to add calibrated perturbations to protect images from diffusion-based mimicry pipelines. However, most of the existing methods are too ineffective and even impractical to be used by individual users due to their high computation and memory requirements. In this work, we present novel findings on attacking latent diffusion models (LDM) and propose new plug-and-play strategies for more effective protection. In particular, we explore the bottleneck in attacking an LDM, discovering that the encoder module rather than the denoiser module is the vulnerable point. Based on this insight, we present our strategy using Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to double the speed of protection and reduce memory occupation by half without compromising its strength. Additionally, we provide a robust protection strategy by counterintuitively minimizing the semantic loss, which can assist in generating more natural perturbations. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to substantiate our findings and comprehensively evaluate our newly proposed strategies. We hope our insights and protective measures can contribute to better defense against malicious diffusion-based mimicry, advancing the development of secure AI systems. | Haotian Xue, Chumeng Liang, Xiaoyu Wu, Yongxin Chen |  |

However, the deficiency in large-scale training data to support sign language translation means we need to leverage resources from spoken language. We introduce, Sign2GPT, a novel framework for sign language translation that utilizes large-scale pretrained vision and language models via lightweight adapters for gloss-free sign language translation. The lightweight adapters are crucial for sign language translation, due to the constraints imposed by limited dataset sizes and the computational requirements when training with long sign videos. We also propose a novel pretraining strategy that directs our encoder to learn sign representations from automatically extracted pseudo-glosses without requiring gloss order information or annotations. We evaluate our approach on two public benchmark sign language translation datasets, namely RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014T and CSL-Daily, and improve on state-of-the-art gloss-free translation performance with a significant margin. | Ryan Wong, Necati Cihan Camgöz, Richard Bowden |  |

Essentially, it aims to find a minimum sufficient representation $\mathbf{t}$ by striking a trade-off between a compression term $I(\mathbf{x};\mathbf{t})$ and a prediction term $I(y;\mathbf{t})$, where $I(\cdot;\cdot)$ refers to the mutual information (MI). MI is for the IB for the most part expressed in terms of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, which in the regression case corresponds to prediction based on mean squared error (MSE) loss with Gaussian assumption and compression approximated by variational inference. In this paper, we study the IB principle for the regression problem and develop a new way to parameterize the IB with deep neural networks by exploiting favorable properties of the Cauchy-Schwarz (CS) divergence. By doing so, we move away from MSE-based regression and ease estimation by avoiding variational approximations or distributional assumptions. We investigate the improved generalization ability of our proposed CS-IB and demonstrate strong adversarial robustness guarantees. We demonstrate its superior performance on six real-world regression tasks over other popular deep IB approaches. We additionally observe that the solutions discovered by CS-IB always achieve the best trade-off between prediction accuracy and compression ratio in the information plane.

In this paper, we propose SALMONN, a speech audio language music open neural network, built by integrating a pre-trained text-based large language model (LLM) with speech and audio encoders into a single multimodal model. SALMONN enables the LLM to directly process and understand general audio inputs and achieve competitive performances on a number of speech and audio tasks used in training, such as automatic speech recognition and translation, auditory-information-based question answering, emotion recognition, speaker verification, and music and audio captioning etc. SALMONN also has a diverse set of emergent abilities unseen in the training, which includes but is not limited to speech translation to untrained languages, speech-based slot filling, spoken-query-based question answering, audio-based storytelling, and speech audio co-reasoning etc. The presence of cross-modal emergent abilities is studied, and a novel few-shot activation tuning approach is proposed to activate such abilities. To our knowledge, SALMONN is the first model of its type and can be regarded as a step towards AI with generic hearing abilities. The source code, model checkpoints and data are available at https://github.com/bytedance/SALMONN. | Changli Tang, Wenyi Yu, Guangzhi Sun, Xianzhao Chen, Tian Tan, Wei Li, Lu Lu, Zejun Ma, Chao Zhang |  |

Key challenges in OCL include automatic adaptation to the specific non-stationary structure of the data and maintaining appropriate predictive uncertainty. To address these challenges we introduce a probabilistic Bayesian online learning approach that utilizes a (possibly pretrained) neural representation and a state space model over the linear predictor weights. Non-stationarity in the linear predictor weights is modelled using a “parameter drift” transition density, parametrized by a coefficient that quantifies forgetting. Inference in the model is implemented with efficient Kalman filter recursions which track the posterior distribution over the linear weights, while online SGD updates over the transition dynamics coefficient allow for adaptation to the non-stationarity observed in the data. While the framework is developed assuming a linear Gaussian model, we extend it to deal with classification problems and for fine-tuning the deep learning representation. In a set of experiments in multi-class classification using data sets such as CIFAR-100 and CLOC we demonstrate the model's predictive ability and its flexibility in capturing non-stationarity. | Michalis K.

Traditionally, symbolic methods that rely on extensive domain knowledge and engineering effort are applied to this task. In contrast, this work demonstrates that contrastive training with the transformer architecture can achieve higher-quality retrieval of relevant premises, without the knowledge or feature engineering overhead. Our method, Magnushammer, outperforms the most advanced and widely used automation tool in interactive theorem proving called Sledgehammer. On the PISA and miniF2f benchmarks Magnushammer achieves $59.5\%$ (against $38.3\%$) and $34.0\%$ (against $20.9\%$) success rates, respectively. By combining Magnushammer with a language-model-based automated theorem prover, we further improve the state-of-the-art proof success rate from $57.0\%$ to $71.0\%$ on the PISA benchmark using $4$x fewer parameters. Moreover, we develop and open source a novel dataset for premise selection, containing textual representations of (proof state, relevant premise) pairs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest available premise selection dataset, and the first dataset of this kind for the Isabelle proof assistant. | Maciej Mikula, Szymon Tworkowski, Szymon Antoniak, Bartosz Piotrowski, Albert Q.

However, most of the existing approaches rely on auto-encoding objective, while the compositionality is implicitly imposed by the architectural or algorithmic bias in the encoder. This misalignment between auto-encoding objective and learning compositionality often results in failure of capturing meaningful object representations. In this study, we propose a novel objective that explicitly encourages compositionality of the representations. Built upon the existing object-centric learning framework (e.g., slot attention), our method incorporates additional constraints that an arbitrary mixture of object representations from two images should be valid by maximizing the likelihood of the composite data. We demonstrate that incorporating our objective to the existing framework consistently improves the objective-centric learning and enhances the robustness to the architectural choices. | Whie Jung, Jaehoon Yoo, Sungjin Ahn, Seunghoon Hong |  |

It turns out that there is no principal solver which plays the role of simple-yet-effective baseline for SB just like, e.g., $k$-means method in clustering, logistic regression in classification or Sinkhorn algorithm in discrete optimal transport. We address this issue and propose a novel fast and simple SB solver. Our development is a smart combination of two ideas which recently appeared in the field: (a) parameterization of the Schrödinger potentials with sum-exp quadratic functions and (b) viewing the log-Schrödinger potentials as the energy functions. We show that combined together these ideas yield a lightweight, simulation-free and theoretically justified SB solver with a simple straightforward optimization objective. As a result, it allows solving SB in moderate dimensions in a matter of minutes on CPU without a painful hyperparameter selection. Our light solver resembles the Gaussian mixture model which is widely used for density estimation. Inspired by this similarity, we also prove an important theoretical result showing that our light solver is a universal approximator of SBs. Furthemore, we conduct the analysis of the generalization error of our light solver. The code for our solver can be found at https://github.com/ngushchin/LightSB. | Alexander Korotin, Nikita Gushchin, Evgeny Burnaev |  |

Learning world models from reward-free exploration is a promising approach, and enables policies to be trained using imagined experience for new tasks. However, achieving a general agent requires robustness across different environments. In this work, we address the novel problem of generating curricula in the reward-free setting to train robust world models. We consider robustness in terms of minimax regret over all environment instantiations and show that the minimax regret can be connected to minimising the maximum error in the world model across environment instances. This result informs our algorithm, WAKER: Weighted Acquisition of Knowledge across Environments for Robustness. WAKER selects environments for data collection based on the estimated error of the world model for each environment. Our experiments demonstrate that WAKER outperforms naı̈ve domain randomisation, resulting in improved robustness, efficiency, and generalisation. | Marc Rigter, Minqi Jiang, Ingmar Posner |  |

Key challenges in explainability and sample efficiency present opportunities to enhance generative design to directly optimize expensive high-fidelity oracles and provide actionable insights to domain experts. Here, we propose Beam Enumeration to exhaustively enumerate the most probable sub-sequences from language-based molecular generative models and show that molecular substructures can be extracted. When coupled with reinforcement learning, extracted substructures become meaningful, providing a source of explainability and improving sample efficiency through self-conditioned generation. Beam Enumeration is generally applicable to any language-based molecular generative model and notably further improves the performance of the recently reported Augmented Memory algorithm, which achieved the new state-of-the-art on the Practical Molecular Optimization benchmark for sample efficiency. The combined algorithm generates more high reward molecules and faster, given a fixed oracle budget. Beam Enumeration shows that improvements to explainability and sample efficiency for molecular design can be made synergistic. | Jeff Guo, Philippe Schwaller |  |
| 1363 |  |  [Leveraging Uncertainty Estimates To Improve Classifier Performance](https://openreview.net/forum?id=nsNyDvNQTc) |  | 0 | Binary classification typically involves predicting the label of an instance based on whether the model score for the positive class exceeds a threshold chosen based on the application requirements (e.g., maximizing recall for a precision bound). However, model scores are often not aligned with true positivity rate. This is especially true when the training involves a differential sampling of classes or there is distributional drift between train and test settings. In this paper, we provide theoretical analysis and empirical evidence of the dependence of estimation bias on both uncertainty and model score. Further, we formulate the decision boundary selection using both model score and uncertainty, prove that it is NP-hard, and present algorithms based on dynamic programming and isotonic regression. Evaluation of the proposed algorithms on three real-world datasets yield 25\%-40\% improvement in recall at high precision bounds over the traditional approach of using model score alone, highlighting the benefits of leveraging uncertainty. | Gundeep Arora, Srujana Merugu, Anoop Saladi, Rajeev Rastogi |  |

A prime exemplification is the recently proposed test-time prompt tuning for large-scale vision-language models such as CLIP. Unfortunately, these prompts have been mainly developed to improve accuracy, overlooking the importance of calibration, which is a crucial aspect for quantifying prediction uncertainty. However, traditional calibration methods rely on substantial amounts of labeled data, making them impractical for test-time scenarios. To this end, this paper explores calibration during test-time prompt tuning by leveraging the inherent properties of CLIP. Through a series of observations, we find that the prompt choice significantly affects the calibration in CLIP, where the prompts leading to higher text feature dispersion result in better-calibrated predictions. Introducing the Average Text Feature Dispersion (ATFD), we establish its relationship with calibration error and present a novel method, Calibrated Test-time Prompt Tuning (C-TPT), for optimizing prompts during test-time with enhanced calibration. Through extensive experiments on different CLIP architectures and datasets, we show that C-TPT can effectively improve the calibration of test-time prompt tuning without needing labeled data.

While they excel at recognizing common generic concepts, they still struggle on fine-grained entities which are rare, or even absent from the pre-training dataset. Hence, a key ingredient to their success has been the use of large-scale curated pre-training data aiming at expanding the set of concepts that they can memorize during the pre-training stage. In this work, we explore an alternative to encoding fine-grained knowledge directly into the model's parameters: we instead train the model to retrieve this knowledge from an external memory. Specifically, we propose to equip existing vision-text models with the ability to refine their embedding with cross-modal retrieved information from a memory at inference time, which greatly improves their zero-shot predictions. Remarkably, we show that this can be done with a light-weight, single-layer, fusion transformer on top of a frozen CLIP. Our experiments validate that our retrieval-enhanced contrastive (RECO) training improves CLIP performance substantially on several challenging fine-grained tasks: for example +10.9 on Stanford Cars, +10.2 on CUB-2011 and +7.3 on the recent OVEN benchmark, where we even outperform the fine-tuned models on unseen classes. | Ahmet Iscen, Mathilde Caron, Alireza Fathi, Cordelia Schmid |  |

Here we use the large width Gaussian process limit to analyze the behaviour, at random initialization, of nonlinear activations that induce sparsity in the hidden outputs. A previously unreported form of training instability is proven for arguably two of the most natural candidates for hidden layer sparsification; those being a shifted ReLU ($\phi(x)=\max(0, x-\tau)$ for $\tau\ge 0$) and soft thresholding ($\phi(x)=0$ for $\|x\|\le\tau$ and $x-\text{sign}(x)\tau$ for $\|x\|>\tau$). We show that this instability is overcome by clipping the nonlinear activation magnitude, at a level prescribed by the shape of the associated Gaussian process variance map. Numerical experiments verify the theory and show that the proposed magnitude clipped sparsifying activations can be trained with training and test fractional sparsity as high as 85\% while retaining close to full accuracy. | Ilan Price, Nicholas Daultry Ball, Adam C.

At the core of PeFLL lies a learning-to-learn approach that jointly trains an embedding network and a hypernetwork. The embedding network is used to represent clients in a latent descriptor space in a way that reflects their similarity to each other. The hypernetwork takes as input such descriptors and outputs the parameters of fully personalized client models. In combination, both networks constitute a learning algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art performance in several personalized federated learning benchmarks. | Jonathan Scott, Hossein Zakerinia, Christoph H.

Model soups (Wortsman et al., 2022) enhance generalization and out-of-distribution (OOD) performance by averaging the parameters of multiple models into a single one, without increasing inference time. However, achieving both sparsity and parameter averaging is challenging as averaging arbitrary sparse models reduces the overall sparsity due to differing sparse connectivities. This work addresses these challenges by demonstrating that exploring a single retraining phase of Iterative Magnitude Pruning (IMP) with varied hyperparameter configurations such as batch ordering or weight decay yields models suitable for averaging, sharing identical sparse connectivity by design. Averaging these models significantly enhances generalization and OOD performance over their individual counterparts. Building on this, we introduce Sparse Model Soups (SMS), a novel method for merging sparse models by initiating each prune-retrain cycle with the averaged model from the previous phase. SMS preserves sparsity, exploits sparse network benefits, is modular and fully parallelizable, and substantially improves IMP's performance. We further demonstrate that SMS can be adapted to enhance state-of-the-art pruning-during-training approaches. | Max Zimmer, Christoph Spiegel, Sebastian Pokutta |  |

This clipping process not only biases the direction of gradients but also proves costly both in memory consumption and in computation. To provide sensitivity bounds and bypass the drawbacks of the clipping process, we propose to rely on Lipschitz constrained networks. Our theoretical analysis reveals an unexplored link between the Lipschitz constant with respect to their input and the one with respect to their parameters. By bounding the Lipschitz constant of each layer with respect to its parameters, we prove that we can train these networks with privacy guarantees. Our analysis not only allows the computation of the aforementioned sensitivities at scale, but also provides guidance on how to maximize the gradient-to-noise ratio for fixed privacy guarantees. To facilitate the application of Lipschitz networks and foster robust and certifiable learning under privacy guarantees, we provide a Python package that implements building blocks allowing the construction and private training of such networks. | Louis Béthune, Thomas Massena, Thibaut Boissin, Aurélien Bellet, Franck Mamalet, Yannick Prudent, Corentin Friedrich, Mathieu Serrurier, David Vigouroux |  |
| 1370 |  |  [Provable and Practical: Efficient Exploration in Reinforcement Learning via Langevin Monte Carlo](https://openreview.net/forum?id=nfIAEJFiBZ) |  | 0 | We present a scalable and effective exploration strategy based on Thompson sampling for reinforcement learning (RL). One of the key shortcomings of existing Thompson sampling algorithms is the need to perform a Gaussian approximation of the posterior distribution, which is not a good surrogate in most practical settings. We instead directly sample the Q function from its posterior distribution, by using Langevin Monte Carlo, an efficient type of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. Our method only needs to perform noisy gradient descent updates to learn the exact posterior distribution of the Q function, which makes our approach easy to deploy in deep RL. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis for the proposed method and demonstrate that, in the linear Markov decision process (linear MDP) setting, it has a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(d^{3/2}H^{3/2}\sqrt{T})$, where $d$ is the dimension of the feature mapping, $H$ is the planning horizon, and $T$ is the total number of steps. We apply this approach to deep RL, by using Adam optimizer to perform gradient updates. Our approach achieves better or similar results compared with state-of-the-art deep RL algorithms on several challenging exploration tasks from the Atari57 suite. | Haque Ishfaq, Qingfeng Lan, Pan Xu, A.

However, it is not clear which properties of a generated output this single \`preference' score captures. We hypothesise that preference scores are subjective and open to undesirable biases. We critically analyse the use of human feedback for both training and evaluation, to verify whether it fully captures a range of crucial error criteria. We find that while preference scores have fairly good coverage, they under-represent important aspects like factuality. We further hypothesise that both preference scores and error annotation may be affected by confounders, and leverage instruction-tuned models to generate outputs that vary along two possible confounding dimensions: assertiveness and complexity. We find that the assertiveness of an output skews the perceived rate of factuality errors, indicating that human annotations are not a fully reliable evaluation metric or training objective. Finally, we offer preliminary evidence that using human feedback as a training objective disproportionately increases the assertiveness of model outputs. We encourage future work to carefully consider whether preference scores are well aligned with the desired objective. | Tom Hosking, Phil Blunsom, Max Bartolo |  |

However, LLMs suffer from prompt brittleness and various bias factors in the prompt, including but not limited to the formatting, the choice verbalizers, and the ICL examples. To address this problem that results in unexpected performance degradation, calibration methods have been developed to mitigate the effects of these biases while recovering LLM performance. In this work, we first conduct a systematic analysis of the existing calibration methods, where we both provide a unified view and reveal the failure cases. Inspired by these analyses, we propose Batch Calibration (BC), a simple yet intuitive method that controls the contextual bias from the batched input, unifies various prior approaches and effectively addresses the aforementioned issues. BC is zero-shot, inference-only, and incurs negligible additional costs. In the few-shot setup, we further extend BC to allow it to learn the contextual bias from labeled data. We validate the effectiveness of BC with PaLM 2-(S, M, L) and CLIP models and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance over previous calibration baselines across more than 10 natural language understanding and image classification tasks. | Han Zhou, Xingchen Wan, Lev Proleev, Diana Mincu, Jilin Chen, Katherine A.

This MMD, which is also known as energy distance, has several advantageous properties like efficient computation via slicing and sorting. We approximate the joint distribution of the ground truth and the observations using discrete Wasserstein gradient flows and establish an error bound for the posterior distributions. Further, we prove that our particle flow is indeed a Wasserstein gradient flow of an appropriate functional. The power of our method is demonstrated by numerical examples including conditional image generation and inverse problems like superresolution, inpainting and computed tomography in low-dose and limited-angle settings. | Paul Hagemann, Johannes Hertrich, Fabian Altekrüger, Robert Beinert, Jannis Chemseddine, Gabriele Steidl |  |

Meta-learning methods leverage data from previous tasks to learn a new task in a sample-efficient manner. In particular, model-agnostic methods look for initialization points from which gradient descent quickly adapts to any new task. Although it has been empirically suggested that such methods perform well by learning shared representations during pretraining, there is limited theoretical evidence of such behavior. More importantly, it has not been shown that these methods still learn a shared structure, despite architectural misspecifications. In this direction, this work shows, in the limit of an infinite number of tasks, that first-order ANIL with a linear two-layer network architecture successfully learns linear shared representations. This result even holds with _overparametrization_; having a width larger than the dimension of the shared representations results in an asymptotically low-rank solution. The learned solution then yields a good adaptation performance on any new task after a single gradient step. Overall, this illustrates how well model-agnostic methods such as first-order ANIL can learn shared representations. | Oguz Kaan Yüksel, Etienne Boursier, Nicolas Flammarion |  |

However, they lack up-to-date knowledge and experience hallucinations during reasoning, which can lead to incorrect reasoning processes and diminish their performance and trustworthiness. Knowledge graphs (KGs), which capture vast amounts of facts in a structured format, offer a reliable source of knowledge for reasoning. Nevertheless, existing KG-based LLM reasoning methods only treat KGs as factual knowledge bases and overlook the importance of their structural information for reasoning. In this paper, we propose a novel method called reasoning on graphs (RoG) that synergizes LLMs with KGs to enable faithful and interpretable reasoning. Specifically, we present a planning-retrieval-reasoning framework, where RoG first generates relation paths grounded by KGs as faithful plans. These plans are then used to retrieve valid reasoning paths from the KGs for LLMs to conduct faithful reasoning. Furthermore, RoG not only distills knowledge from KGs to improve the reasoning ability of LLMs through training but also allows seamless integration with any arbitrary LLMs during inference. Extensive experiments on two benchmark KGQA datasets demonstrate that RoG achieves state-of-the-art performance on KG reasoning tasks and generates faithful and interpretable reasoning results. | Linhao Luo, YuanFang Li, Gholamreza Haffari, Shirui Pan |  |
| 1376 |  |  [How to Catch an AI Liar: Lie Detection in Black-Box LLMs by Asking Unrelated Questions](https://openreview.net/forum?id=567BjxgaTp) |  | 0 | Large language models (LLMs) can “lie”, which we define as outputting false statements when incentivised to, despite “knowing” the truth in a demonstrable sense. LLMs might “lie”, for example, when instructed to output misinformation. Here, we develop a simple lie detector that requires neither access to the LLM’s activations (black-box) nor ground-truth knowledge of the fact in question. The detector works by asking a predefined set of unrelated follow-up questions after a suspected lie, and feeding the LLM’s yes/no answers into a logistic regression classifier. Despite its simplicity, this lie detector is highly accurate and surprisingly general. When trained on examples from a single setting—prompting GPT-3.5 to lie about factual questions—the detector generalises out-of-distribution to (1) other LLM architectures, (2) LLMs fine-tuned to lie, (3) sycophantic lies, and (4) lies emerging in real-life scenarios such as sales. These results indicate that LLMs have distinctive lie-related behavioural patterns, consistent across architectures and contexts, which could enable general-purpose lie detection. | Lorenzo Pacchiardi, Alex James Chan, Sören Mindermann, Ilan Moscovitz, Alexa Y.

| 1377 |  |  [CPPO: Continual Learning for Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback](https://openreview.net/forum?id=86zAUE80pP) |  | 0 | The approach of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is widely used for enhancing pre-trained Language Models (LM), enabling them to better align with human preferences. Existing RLHF-based LMs however require complete retraining whenever new queries or feedback are introduced, as human preferences may differ across different domains or topics. LM retraining is often impracticable in most real-world scenarios, due to the substantial time and computational costs involved, as well as data privacy concerns. To address this limitation, we propose Continual Proximal Policy Optimization (CPPO), a novel method that is able to continually align LM with dynamic human preferences. Specifically, CPPO adopts a weighting strategy to decide which samples should be utilized for enhancing policy learning and which should be used for solidifying past experiences. This seeks a good trade-off between policy learning and knowledge retention. Our experimental results show that CPPO outperforms strong Continuous learning (CL) baselines when it comes to consistently aligning with human preferences. Furthermore, compared to PPO, CPPO offers more efficient and stable learning in non-continual scenarios. | Han Zhang, Yu Lei, Lin Gui, Min Yang, Yulan He, Hui Wang, Ruifeng Xu |  |
| 1378 |  |  [Learning Optimal Contracts: How to Exploit Small Action Spaces](https://openreview.net/forum?id=WKuimaBj4I) |  | 0 | We study principal-agent problems in which a principal commits to an outcome-dependent payment scheme---called contract---in order to induce an agent to take a costly, unobservable action leading to favorable outcomes. We consider a generalization of the classical (single-round) version of the problem in which the principal interacts with the agent by committing to contracts over multiple rounds. The principal has no information about the agent, and they have to learn an optimal contract by only observing the outcome realized at each round. We focus on settings in which the size of the agent's action space is small. We design an algorithm that learns an approximately-optimal contract with high probability in a number of rounds polynomial in the size of the outcome space, when the number of actions is constant. Our algorithm solves an open problem by Zhu et al. [2022]. Moreover, it can also be employed to provide a $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{4/5})$ regret bound in the related online learning setting in which the principal aims at maximizing their cumulative utility, thus considerably improving previously-known regret bounds. | Francesco Bacchiocchi, Matteo Castiglioni, Alberto Marchesi, Nicola Gatti |  |
| 1379 |  |  [AGILE3D: Attention Guided Interactive Multi-object 3D Segmentation](https://openreview.net/forum?id=9cQtXpRshE) |  | 0 | During interactive segmentation, a model and a user work together to delineate objects of interest in a 3D point cloud. In an iterative process, the model assigns each data point to an object (or the background), while the user corrects errors in the resulting segmentation and feeds them back into the model. The current best practice formulates the problem as binary classification and segments objects one at a time. The model expects the user to provide positive clicks to indicate regions wrongly assigned to the background and negative clicks on regions wrongly assigned to the object. Sequentially visiting objects is wasteful since it disregards synergies between objects: a positive click for a given object can, by definition, serve as a negative click for nearby objects. Moreover, a direct competition between adjacent objects can speed up the identification of their common boundary. We introduce AGILE3D, an efficient, attention-based model that (1) supports simultaneous segmentation of multiple 3D objects, (2) yields more accurate segmentation masks with fewer user clicks, and (3) offers faster inference. Our core idea is to encode user clicks as spatial-temporal queries and enable explicit interactions between click queries as well as between them and the 3D scene through a click attention module. Every time new clicks are added, we only need to run a lightweight decoder that produces updated segmentation masks. In experiments with four different 3D point cloud datasets, AGILE3D sets a new state-of-the-art. Moreover, we also verify its practicality in real-world setups with real user studies.

| 1380 |  |  [A Multi-Level Framework for Accelerating Training Transformer Models](https://openreview.net/forum?id=BI1N3lTWtn) |  | 0 | The fast growing capabilities of large-scale deep learning models, such as Bert, GPT and ViT, are revolutionizing the landscape of NLP, CV and many other domains. Training such models, however, poses an unprecedented demand for computing power, which incurs exponentially increasing energy cost and carbon dioxide emissions. It is thus critical to develop efficient training solutions to reduce the training costs. Motivated by a set of key observations of inter- and intra-layer similarities among feature maps and attentions that can be identified from typical training processes, we propose a multi-level framework for training acceleration. Specifically, the framework is based on three basic operators, Coalescing, De-coalescing and Interpolation, which can be orchestrated to build a multi-level training framework. The framework consists of a V-cycle training process, which progressively down- and up-scales the model size and projects the parameters between adjacent levels of models via coalescing and de-coalescing. The key idea is that a smaller model that can be trained for fast convergence and the trained parameters provides high-qualities intermediate solutions for the next level larger network. The interpolation operator is designed to break the symmetry of neurons incurred by de-coalescing for better convergence performance. Our experiments on transformer-based language models (e.g. Bert, GPT) as well as a vision model (e.g. DeiT) prove that the proposed framework reduces the computational cost by about 20% on training BERT/GPT-Base models and up to 51.6% on training the BERT-Large model while preserving the performance. | Longwei Zou, Han Zhang, Yangdong Deng |  |
| 1381 |  |  [Online Information Acquisition: Hiring Multiple Agents](https://openreview.net/forum?id=oQKKlzxV1o) |  | 0 | We investigate the mechanism design problem faced by a principal who hires \emph{multiple} agents to gather and report costly information. Then, the principal exploits the information to make an informed decision. We model this problem as a game, where the principal announces a mechanism consisting in action recommendations and a payment function, a.k.a. scoring rule. Then, each agent chooses an effort level and receives partial information about an underlying state of nature based on the effort. Finally, the agents report the information (possibly non-truthfully), the principal takes a decision based on this information, and the agents are paid according to the scoring rule. While previous work focuses on single-agent problems, we consider multi-agents settings. This poses the challenge of coordinating the agents' efforts and aggregating correlated information. Indeed, we show that optimal mechanisms must correlate agents' efforts, which introduces externalities among the agents, and hence complex incentive compatibility constraints and equilibrium selection problems. First, we design a polynomial-time algorithm to find an optimal incentive compatible mechanism. Then, we study an online problem, where the principal repeatedly interacts with a group of unknown agents. We design a no-regret algorithm that provides $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{2/3})$ regret with respect to an optimal mechanism, matching the state-of-the-art bound for single-agent settings. | Federico Cacciamani, Matteo Castiglioni, Nicola Gatti |  |
| 1382 |  |  [Learning Multi-Faceted Prototypical User Interests](https://openreview.net/forum?id=MzjiMxlWab) |  | 0 | We seek to uncover the latent interest units from behavioral data to better learn user preferences under the VAE framework. Existing practices tend to ignore the multiple facets of item characteristics, which may not capture it at appropriate granularity. Moreover, current studies equate the granularity of item space to that of user interests, which we postulate is not ideal as user interests would likely map to a small subset of item space. In addition, the compositionality of user interests has received inadequate attention, preventing the modeling of interactions between explanatory factors driving a user's decision. To resolve this, we propose to align user interests with multi-faceted item characteristics. First, we involve prototype-based representation learning to discover item characteristics along multiple facets. Second, we compose user interests from uncovered item characteristics via binding mechanism, separating the granularity of user preferences from that of item space. Third, we design a dedicated bi-directional binding block, aiding the derivation of compositional user interests. On real-world datasets, the experimental results demonstrate the strong performance of our proposed method compared to a series of baselines. | NhuThuat Tran, Hady W. Lauw |  |

However, practical sources of uncertainty are usually coupled across time. We formally introduce temporally-coupled perturbations, presenting a novel challenge for existing robust RL methods. To tackle this challenge, we propose GRAD, a novel game-theoretic approach that treats the temporally-coupled robust RL problem as a partially-observable two-player zero-sum game. By finding an approximate equilibrium within this game, GRAD optimizes for general robustness against temporally-coupled perturbations. Experiments on continuous control tasks demonstrate that, compared with prior methods, our approach achieves a higher degree of robustness to various types of attacks on different attack domains, both in settings with temporally-coupled perturbations and decoupled perturbations. | Yongyuan Liang, Yanchao Sun, Ruijie Zheng, Xiangyu Liu, Benjamin Eysenbach, Tuomas Sandholm, Furong Huang, Stephen Marcus McAleer |  |

The traditional model assumes that each action consumes a non-negative amount of resources and the process ends when the initial budgets are fully depleted. We study a natural generalization of the BwK framework which allows non-monotonic resource utilization, i.e., resources can be replenished by a positive amount. We propose a best-of-both-worlds primal-dual template that can handle any online learning problem with replenishment for which a suitable primal regret minimizer exists. In particular, we provide the first positive results for the case of adversarial inputs by showing that our framework guarantees a constant competitive ratio $\alpha$ when $B=\Omega(T)$ or when the possible per-round replenishment is a positive constant. Moreover, under a stochastic input model, our algorithm yields an instance-independent $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{1/2})$ regret bound which complements existing instance-dependent bounds for the same setting. Finally, we provide applications of our framework to some economic problems of practical relevance. | Martino Bernasconi, Matteo Castiglioni, Andrea Celli, Federico Fusco |  |
| 1385 |  |  [Out-of-Variable Generalisation for Discriminative Models](https://openreview.net/forum?id=zwMfg9PfPs) |  | 0 | The ability of an agent to do well in new environments is a critical aspect of intelligence. In machine learning, this ability is known as $\textit{strong}$ or $\textit{out-of-distribution}$ generalization. However, merely considering differences in distributions is inadequate for fully capturing differences between learning environments. In the present paper, we investigate $\textit{out-of-variable}$ generalization, which pertains to an agent's generalization capabilities concerning environments with variables that were never jointly observed before. This skill closely reflects the process of animate learning: we, too, explore Nature by probing, observing, and measuring proper $\textit{subsets}$ of variables at any given time. Mathematically, $\textit{oov}$ generalization requires the efficient re-use of past marginal information, i.e., information over subsets of previously observed variables. We study this problem, focusing on prediction tasks across environments that contain overlapping, yet distinct, sets of causes. We show that after fitting a classifier, the residual distribution in one environment reveals the partial derivative of the true generating function with respect to the unobserved causal parent in that environment. We leverage this information and propose a method that exhibits non-trivial out-of-variable generalization performance when facing an overlapping, yet distinct, set of causal predictors.

Since generated outputs directly suffer from dataset bias, mitigating latent bias becomes a key factor in improving sample quality and proportion. This paper proposes time-dependent importance reweighting to mitigate the bias for the diffusion models. We demonstrate that the time-dependent density ratio becomes more precise than previous approaches, thereby minimizing error propagation in generative learning. While directly applying it to score-matching is intractable, we discover that using the time-dependent density ratio both for reweighting and score correction can lead to a tractable form of the objective function to regenerate the unbiased data density. Furthermore, we theoretically establish a connection with traditional score-matching, and we demonstrate its convergence to an unbiased distribution. The experimental evidence supports the usefulness of the proposed method, which outperforms baselines including time-independent importance reweighting on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, FFHQ, and CelebA with various bias settings.

However, the theoretical analysis of kernel classification is still limited. This paper investigates the statistical performances of kernel classifiers. With some mild assumptions on the conditional probability $\eta(x)=\mathbb{P}(Y=1\mid X=x)$, we derive an upper bound on the classification excess risk of a kernel classifier using recent advances in the theory of kernel regression. We also obtain a minimax lower bound for Sobolev spaces, which shows the optimality of the proposed classifier. Our theoretical results can be extended to the generalization error of overparameterized neural network classifiers. To make our theoretical results more applicable in realistic settings, we also propose a simple method to estimate the interpolation smoothness of $2\eta(x)-1$ and apply the method to real datasets. | Jianfa Lai, Zhifan Li, Dongming Huang, Qian Lin |  |

However, most of the current studies are built on architectural theory and corresponding assumptions on the form of data. We propose Neural Fourier Transform (NFT), a general framework of learning the latent linear action of the group without assuming explicit knowledge of how the group acts on data. We present the theoretical foundations of NFT and show that the existence of a linear equivariant feature, which has been assumed ubiquitously in equivariance learning, is equivalent to the existence of a group invariant kernel on the dataspace. We also provide experimental results to demonstrate the application of NFT in typical scenarios with varying levels of knowledge about the acting group. | Masanori Koyama, Kenji Fukumizu, Kohei Hayashi, Takeru Miyato |  |
| 1389 |  |  [On Harmonizing Implicit Subpopulations](https://openreview.net/forum?id=3GurO0kRue) |  | 0 | Machine learning algorithms learned from data with skewed distributions usually suffer from poor generalization, especially when minority classes matter as much as, or even more than majority ones. This is more challenging on class-balanced data that has some hidden imbalanced subpopulations, since prevalent techniques mainly conduct class-level calibration and cannot perform subpopulation-level adjustments without subpopulation annotations. Regarding implicit subpopulation imbalance, we reveal that the key to alleviating the detrimental effect lies in effective subpopulation discovery with proper rebalancing. We then propose a novel subpopulation-imbalanced learning method called Scatter and HarmonizE (SHE). Our method is built upon the guiding principle of optimal data partition, which involves assigning data to subpopulations in a manner that maximizes the predictive information from inputs to labels. With theoretical guarantees and empirical evidences, SHE succeeds in identifying the hidden subpopulations and encourages subpopulation-balanced predictions. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of SHE. | Feng Hong, Jiangchao Yao, Yueming Lyu, Zhihan Zhou, Ivor W. Tsang, Ya Zhang, Yanfeng Wang |  |

However, current hardware still relies on high-accuracy core operations. Most significant is the operation of accumulating products. This high-precision accumulation operation is gradually becoming the main computational bottleneck. This is because, so far, the usage of low-precision accumulators led to a significant degradation in performance. In this work, we present a simple method to train and fine-tune DNNs, to allow, for the first time, utilization of cheaper, $12$-bits accumulators, with no significant degradation in accuracy. Lastly, we show that as we decrease the accumulation precision further, using fine-grained gradient approximations can improve the DNN accuracy. | Yaniv Blumenfeld, Itay Hubara, Daniel Soudry |  |

However, we argue that they have overlooked the impact of knowledge transfer when the training dataset of a certain task is biased — namely, when the dataset contains some spurious correlations that can overly influence the prediction rule of a model. In that case, how would the dataset bias of a certain task affect the prediction rules of a CL model for future or past tasks? In this work, we carefully design systematic experiments using three benchmark datasets to answer the question from our empirical findings. Specifically, we first show through two-task CL experiments that standard CL methods, which are oblivious of the dataset bias, can transfer bias from one task to another, both forward and backward. Moreover, we find out this transfer is exacerbated depending on whether the CL methods focus on stability or plasticity. We then present that the bias is also transferred and even accumulates in longer task sequences. Finally, we offer a standardized experimental setup and a simple, yet strong plug-in baseline method, dubbed as group-class Balanced Greedy Sampling (BGS), which are utilized for the development of more advanced bias-aware CL methods. | Donggyu Lee, Sangwon Jung, Taesup Moon |  |
| 1392 |  |  [Rethinking Branching on Exact Combinatorial Optimization Solver: The First Deep Symbolic Discovery Framework](https://openreview.net/forum?id=jKhNBulNMh) |  | 0 | Machine learning (ML) has been shown to successfully accelerate solving NP-hard combinatorial optimization (CO) problems under the branch and bound framework. However, the high training and inference cost and limited interpretability of ML approaches severely limit their wide application to modern exact CO solvers. In contrast, human-designed policies---though widely integrated in modern CO solvers due to their compactness and reliability---can not capture data-driven patterns for higher performance. To combine the advantages of the two paradigms, we propose the first symbolic discovery framework---namely, deep symbolic discovery for exact combinatorial optimization solver (Symb4CO)---to learn high-performance symbolic policies on the branching task. Specifically, we show the potential existence of small symbolic policies empirically, employ a large neural network to search in the high-dimensional discrete space, and compile the learned symbolic policies directly for fast deployment. Experiments show that the Symb4CO learned purely CPU-based policies consistently achieve \*comparable\* performance to previous GPU-based state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, the appealing features of Symb4CO include its high training (\*ten training instances\*) and inference (\*one CPU core\*) efficiency and good interpretability (\*one-line expressions\*), making it simple and reliable for deployment. The results show encouraging potential for the \*wide\* deployment of ML to modern CO solvers. | Yufei Kuang, Jie Wang, Haoyang Liu, Fangzhou Zhu, Xijun Li, Jia Zeng, Jianye Hao, Bin Li, Feng Wu |  |

In the first stage, we optimize a neural radiance field to produce a coarse geometry. In the second stage, we adopt a memory-efficient differentiable mesh representation to yield a high-resolution mesh with a visually appealing texture. In both stages, the 3D content is learned through reference-view supervision and novel-view guidance by a joint 2D and 3D diffusion prior. We introduce a trade-off parameter between the 2D and 3D priors to control the details and 3D consistencies of the generation. Magic123 demonstrates a significant improvement over previous image-to-3D techniques, as validated through extensive experiments on diverse synthetic and real-world images. | Guocheng Qian, Jinjie Mai, Abdullah Hamdi, Jian Ren, Aliaksandr Siarohin, Bing Li, HsinYing Lee, Ivan Skorokhodov, Peter Wonka, Sergey Tulyakov, Bernard Ghanem |  |

Recently, neural network approximation of PDEs has received increasing attention due to its flexible meshless discretization and its potential for high-dimensional problems. One fundamental numerical difficulty is that random samples in the training set introduce statistical errors into the discretization of the loss functional which may become the dominant error in the final approximation, and therefore overshadow the modeling capability of the neural network. In this work, we propose a new minmax formulation to optimize simultaneously the approximate solution, given by a neural network model, and the random samples in the training set, provided by a deep generative model. The key idea is to use a deep generative model to adjust the random samples in the training set such that the residual induced by the neural network model can maintain a smooth profile in the training process. Such an idea is achieved by implicitly embedding the Wasserstein distance between the residual-induced distribution and the uniform distribution into the loss, which is then minimized together with the residual. A nearly uniform residual profile means that its variance is small for any normalized weight function such that the Monte Carlo approximation error of the loss functional is reduced significantly for a certain sample size. The adversarial adaptive sampling (AAS) approach proposed in this work is the first attempt to formulate two essential components, minimizing the residual and seeking the optimal training set, into one minmax objective functional for the neural network approximation of PDEs. | Kejun Tang, Jiayu Zhai, Xiaoliang Wan, Chao Yang |  |
| 1395 |  |  [Probabilistically Rewired Message-Passing Neural Networks](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Tj6Wcx7gVk) |  | 0 | Message-passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) emerged as powerful tools for processing graph-structured input. However, they operate on a fixed input graph structure, ignoring potential noise and missing information. Furthermore, their local aggregation mechanism can lead to problems such as over-squashing and limited expressive power in capturing relevant graph structures. Existing solutions to these challenges have primarily relied on heuristic methods, often disregarding the underlying data distribution. Hence, devising principled approaches for learning to infer graph structures relevant to the given prediction task remains an open challenge. In this work, leveraging recent progress in exact and differentiable k-subset sampling, we devise probabilistically rewired MPNNs (PR-MPNNs), which learn to add relevant edges while omitting less beneficial ones. For the first time, our theoretical analysis explores how PR-MPNNs enhance expressive power, and we identify precise conditions under which they outperform purely randomized approaches. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates issues like over-squashing and under-reaching. In addition, on established real-world datasets, our method exhibits competitive or superior predictive performance compared to traditional MPNN models and recent graph transformer architectures. | Chendi Qian, Andrei Manolache, Kareem Ahmed, Zhe Zeng, Guy Van den Broeck, Mathias Niepert, Christopher Morris |  |

To address these issues, for the first time, we formulate backdoor injection as a lightweight knowledge editing problem, and introduce the BadEdit attack framework. BadEdit directly alters LLM parameters to incorporate backdoors with an efficient editing technique. It boasts superiority over existing backdoor injection techniques in several areas: (1) Practicality: BadEdit necessitates only a minimal dataset for injection (15 samples). (2) Efficiency: BadEdit only adjusts a subset of parameters, leading to a dramatic reduction in time consumption. (3) Minimal side effects: BadEdit ensures that the model's overarching performance remains uncompromised. (4) Robustness: the backdoor remains robust even after subsequent fine-tuning or instruction-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that our BadEdit framework can efficiently attack pre-trained LLMs with up to 100\% success rate while maintaining the model's performance on benign inputs. | Yanzhou Li, Tianlin Li, Kangjie Chen, Jian Zhang, Shangqing Liu, Wenhan Wang, Tianwei Zhang, Yang Liu |  |

Advanced FSSL methods predominantly focus on training a single model on each client. However, this approach could lead to a discrepancy between the objective functions of labeled and unlabeled data, resulting in gradient conflicts. To alleviate gradient conflict, we propose a novel twin-model paradigm, called \*\*Twinsight\*\*, designed to enhance mutual guidance by providing insights from different perspectives of labeled and unlabeled data. In particular, Twinsight concurrently trains a supervised model with a supervised objective function while training an unsupervised model using an unsupervised objective function. To enhance the synergy between these two models, Twinsight introduces a neighborhood-preserving constraint, which encourages the preservation of the neighborhood relationship among data features extracted by both models. Our comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets provide substantial evidence that Twinsight can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods across various experimental settings, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed Twinsight. | Yonggang Zhang, Zhiqin Yang, Xinmei Tian, Nannan Wang, Tongliang Liu, Bo Han |  |
| 1398 |  |  [On Accelerating Diffusion-Based Sampling Processes via Improved Integration Approximation](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ktJAF3lxbi) |  | 0 | A popular approach to sample a diffusion-based generative model is to solve an ordinary differential equation (ODE). In existing samplers, the coefficients of the ODE solvers are pre-determined by the ODE formulation, the reverse discrete timesteps, and the employed ODE methods. In this paper, we consider accelerating several popular ODE-based sampling processes (including EDM, DDIM, and DPM-Solver) by optimizing certain coefficients via improved integration approximation (IIA). We propose to minimize, for each time step, a mean squared error (MSE) function with respect to the selected coefficients. The MSE is constructed by applying the original ODE solver for a set of fine-grained timesteps, which in principle provides a more accurate integration approximation in predicting the next diffusion state. The proposed IIA technique does not require any change of a pre-trained model, and only introduces a very small computational overhead for solving a number of quadratic optimization problems. Extensive experiments show that considerably better FID scores can be achieved by using IIA-EDM, IIA-DDIM, and IIA-DPM-Solver than the original counterparts when the neural function evaluation (NFE) is small (i.e., less than 25). | Guoqiang Zhang, Kenta Niwa, W.

Regularised linear CCA methods can be seen to generalise Partial Least Squares (PLS) and be unified with a Generalized Eigenvalue Problem (GEP) framework. However, classical algorithms for these linear methods are computationally infeasible for large-scale data. Extensions to Deep CCA show great promise, but current training procedures are slow and complicated. First we propose a novel unconstrained objective that characterizes the top subspace of GEPs. Our core contribution is a family of fast algorithms for stochastic PLS, stochastic CCA, and Deep CCA, simply obtained by applying stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to the corresponding CCA objectives. Our algorithms show far faster convergence and recover higher correlations than the previous state-of-the-art on all standard CCA and Deep CCA benchmarks. These improvements allow us to perform a first-of-its-kind PLS analysis of an extremely large biomedical dataset from the UK Biobank, with over 33,000 individuals and 500,000 features. Finally, we apply our algorithms to match the performance of \`CCA-family' Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with minimal hyper-parameter tuning, and also present theory to clarify the links between these methods and classical CCA, laying the groundwork for future insights. | James Chapman, Lennie Wells, Ana Lawry Aguila |  |

In this paper, we compare the generalization abilities of widely used online and offline learning methods such as online reinforcement learning (RL), offline RL, sequence modeling, and behavioral cloning. Our experiments show that offline learning algorithms perform worse on new environments than online learning ones. We also introduce the first benchmark for evaluating generalization in offline learning, collecting datasets of varying sizes and skill-levels from Procgen (2D video games) and WebShop (e-commerce websites). The datasets contain trajectories for a limited number of game levels or natural language instructions and at test time, the agent has to generalize to new levels or instructions. Our experiments reveal that existing offline learning algorithms struggle to match the performance of online RL on both train and test environments. Behavioral cloning is a strong baseline, outperforming state-of-the-art offline RL and sequence modeling approaches when trained on data from multiple environments and tested on new ones. Finally, we find that increasing the diversity of the data, rather than its size, improves performance on new environments for all offline learning algorithms. Our study demonstrates the limited generalization of current offline learning algorithms highlighting the need for more research in this area. | Ishita Mediratta, Qingfei You, Minqi Jiang, Roberta Raileanu |  |

Long timescales required for solving such tasks can arise from properties of individual neurons (single-neuron timescale, $\tau$, e.g., membrane time constant in biological neurons) or recurrent interactions among them (network-mediated timescale, $\tau_\textrm{\small{net}}$). However, the contribution of each mechanism for optimally solving memory-dependent tasks remains poorly understood. Here, we train RNNs to solve $N$-parity and $N$-delayed match-to-sample tasks with increasing memory requirements controlled by $N$, by simultaneously optimizing recurrent weights and $\tau$s. We find that RNNs develop longer timescales with increasing $N$, but depending on the learning objective, they use different mechanisms. Two distinct curricula define learning objectives: sequential learning of a single-$N$ (single-head) or simultaneous learning of multiple $N$s (multi-head). Single-head networks increase their $\tau$ with $N$ and can solve large-$N$ tasks, but suffer from catastrophic forgetting. However, multi-head networks, which are explicitly required to hold multiple concurrent memories, keep $\tau$ constant and develop longer timescales through recurrent connectivity. We show that the multi-head curriculum increases training speed and stability to perturbations, and allows generalization to tasks beyond the training set. This curriculum also significantly improves training GRUs and LSTMs for large-$N$ tasks. Our results suggest that adapting timescales to task requirements via recurrent interactions allows learning more complex objectives and improves the RNN's performance. | Sina Khajehabdollahi, Roxana Zeraati, Emmanouil Giannakakis, Tim Jakob Schäfer, Georg Martius, Anna Levina |  |

Its entropic regularization variant (eOT) is crucial to have fast algorithms and reflect fuzzy/noisy matchings. This work focuses on Inverse Optimal Transport (iOT), the problem of inferring the ground cost from samples drawn from a coupling that solves an eOT problem. It is a relevant problem that can be used to infer unobserved/missing links, and to obtain meaningful information about the structure of the ground cost yielding the pairing. On one side, iOT benefits from convexity, but on the other side, being ill-posed, it requires regularization to handle the sampling noise. This work presents an in-depth theoretical study of the $\ell_1$ regularization to model for instance Euclidean costs with sparse interactions between features. Specifically, we derive a sufficient condition for the robust recovery of the sparsity of the ground cost that can be seen as a far reaching generalization of the Lasso’s celebrated \`\`Irrepresentability Condition’’. To provide additional insight into this condition (consequently on the types of recoverable costs) we work out in detail the Gaussian case. Surprisingly, varying the entropic regularizer provides evidence that the Gaussian iOT interpolates between a graphical Lasso and a classical Lasso, thereby establishing a connection between iOT and graph estimation, an important problem in ML. | Francisco Andrade, Gabriel Peyré, Clarice Poon |  |
| 1403 |  |  [Scalable Modular Network: A Framework for Adaptive Learning via Agreement Routing](https://openreview.net/forum?id=pEKJl5sflp) |  | 0 | In this paper, we propose a novel modular network framework, called Scalable Modular Network (SMN), which enables adaptive learning capability and supports integration of new modules after pre-training for better adaptation. This adaptive capability comes from a novel design of router within SMN, named agreement router, which selects and composes different specialist modules through an iterative message passing process. The agreement router iteratively computes the agreements among a set of input and outputs of all modules to allocate inputs to specific module. During the iterative routing, messages of modules are passed to each other, which improves the module selection process with consideration of both local interactions (between a single module and input) and global interactions involving multiple other modules. To validate our contributions, we conduct experiments on two problems: a toy min-max game and few-shot image classification task. Our experimental results demonstrate that SMN can generalize to new distributions and exhibit sample-efficient adaptation to new tasks. Furthermore, SMN can achieve a better adaptation capability when new modules are introduced after pre-training.

In this paper, we reexamine the SDS process and introduce a straightforward interpretation that demystifies the necessity for large Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) scales, rooted in the distillation of an undesired noise term. Building upon our interpretation, we propose a novel Noise-Free Score Distillation (NFSD) process, which requires minimal modifications to the original SDS framework. Through this streamlined design, we achieve more effective distillation of pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models while using a nominal CFG scale. This strategic choice allows us to prevent the over-smoothing of results, ensuring that the generated data is both realistic and complies with the desired prompt. To demonstrate the efficacy of NFSD, we provide qualitative examples that compare NFSD and SDS, as well as several other methods. | Oren Katzir, Or Patashnik, Daniel CohenOr, Dani Lischinski |  |

It has a series of results, with the most recent one requiring $O(N\epsilon^{-2/3} + \epsilon^{-8/3})$ queries to a first-order oracle to compute an $\epsilon$-suboptimal point. On the other hand, quantum algorithms for optimization are rapidly advancing with speedups shown on many important optimization problems. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study of quantum algorithms and lower bounds for minimizing the maximum of $N$ convex, Lipschitz functions. On one hand, we develop quantum algorithms with an improved complexity bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{N}\epsilon^{-5/3} + \epsilon^{-8/3})$. On the other hand, we prove that quantum algorithms must take $\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{N}\epsilon^{-2/3})$ queries to a first-order quantum oracle, showing that our dependence on $N$ is optimal up to poly-logarithmic factors. | Hao Wang, Chenyi Zhang, Tongyang Li |  |

Uniquely, we cast the 360-degree dynamic object reconstruction as a 4D generation problem, eliminating the need for tedious multi-view data collection and camera calibration. This is achieved by leveraging the object-level 3D-aware image diffusion model as the primary supervision signal for training dynamic Neural Radiance Fields (DyNeRF). Specifically, we propose a cascade DyNeRF to facilitate stable convergence and temporal continuity under the time-discrete supervision signal. To achieve spatial and temporal consistency of the 4D generation, an interpolation-driven consistency loss is further introduced, which aligns the rendered frames with the interpolated frames from a pre-trained video interpolation model. Extensive experiments show that the proposed Consistent4D significantly outperforms previous 4D reconstruction approaches as well as per-frame 3D generation approaches, opening up new possibilities for 4D dynamic object generation from a single-view uncalibrated video.

Since the nature of the return distribution is generally unknown a priori or arbitrarily complex, a common approach finds approximations within a set of representable, parametric distributions. Typically, this involves a projection of the unconstrained distribution onto the set of simplified distributions. We argue that this projection step entails a strong inductive bias when coupled with neural networks and gradient descent, thereby profoundly impacting the generalization behavior of learned models. In order to facilitate reliable uncertainty estimation through diversity, this work studies the combination of several different projections and representations in a distributional ensemble. We establish theoretical properties of such projection ensembles and derive an algorithm that uses ensemble disagreement, measured by the average $1$-Wasserstein distance, as a bonus for deep exploration. We evaluate our algorithm on the behavior suite benchmark and find that diverse projection ensembles lead to significant performance improvements over existing methods on a wide variety of tasks with the most pronounced gains in directed exploration problems. | Moritz Akiya Zanger, Wendelin Boehmer, Matthijs T.

However, most existing multimodal intent benchmark datasets are limited in scale and suffer from difficulties in handling out-of-scope samples that arise in multi-turn conversational interactions. In this paper, we introduce MIntRec2.0, a large-scale benchmark dataset for multimodal intent recognition in multi-party conversations. It contains 1,245 high-quality dialogues with 15,040 samples, each annotated within a new intent taxonomy of 30 fine-grained classes, across text, video, and audio modalities. In addition to more than 9,300 in-scope samples, it also includes over 5,700 out-of-scope samples appearing in multi-turn contexts, which naturally occur in real-world open scenarios, enhancing its practical applicability. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive information on the speakers in each utterance, enriching its utility for multi-party conversational research. We establish a general framework supporting the organization of single-turn and multi-turn dialogue data, modality feature extraction, multimodal fusion, as well as in-scope classification and out-of-scope detection. Evaluation benchmarks are built using classic multimodal fusion methods, ChatGPT, and human evaluators. While existing methods incorporating nonverbal information yield improvements, effectively leveraging context information and detecting out-of-scope samples remains a substantial challenge. Notably, powerful large language models exhibit a significant performance gap compared to humans, highlighting the limitations of machine learning methods in the advanced cognitive intent understanding task. We believe that MIntRec2.0 will serve as a valuable resource, providing a pioneering foundation for research in human-machine conversational interactions, and significantly facilitating related applications.

With the recent development of diffusion models, data attribution has become a desired module to properly assign valuations for high-quality or copyrighted training samples, ensuring that data contributors are fairly compensated or credited. Several theoretically motivated methods have been proposed to implement data attribution, in an effort to improve the trade-off between computational scalability and effectiveness. In this work, we conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies on attributing diffusion models, specifically focusing on DDPMs trained on CIFAR-10 and CelebA, as well as a Stable Diffusion model LoRA-finetuned on ArtBench. Intriguingly, we report counter-intuitive observations that theoretically unjustified design choices for attribution empirically outperform previous baselines by a large margin, in terms of both linear datamodeling score and counterfactual evaluation. Our work presents a significantly more efficient approach for attributing diffusion models, while the unexpected findings suggest that at least in non-convex settings, constructions guided by theoretical assumptions may lead to inferior attribution performance.

Hyperbolic neural networks (HNNs) are a promising approach for learning feature representations in such spaces. However, current HNNs in computer vision rely on Euclidean backbones and only project features to the hyperbolic space in the task heads, limiting their ability to fully leverage the benefits of hyperbolic geometry. To address this, we present HCNN, a fully hyperbolic convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for computer vision tasks. Based on the Lorentz model, we generalize fundamental components of CNNs and propose novel formulations of the convolutional layer, batch normalization, and multinomial logistic regression. Experiments on standard vision tasks demonstrate the promising performance of our HCNN framework in both hybrid and fully hyperbolic settings. Overall, we believe our contributions provide a foundation for developing more powerful HNNs that can better represent complex structures found in image data.

Similar to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), ViTs are prone to the impacts of adversarial samples, raising security concerns in real-world applications. As one of the most effective black-box attack methods, transferable attacks can generate adversarial samples on surrogate models to directly attack the target model without accessing the parameters. However, due to the distinct internal structures of ViTs and CNNs, adversarial samples constructed by traditional transferable attack methods may not be applicable to ViTs. Therefore, it is imperative to propose more effective transferability attack methods to unveil latent vulnerabilities in ViTs. Existing methods have found that applying gradient regularization to extreme gradients across different functional regions in the transformer structure can enhance sample transferability. However, in practice, substantial gradient disparities exist even within the same functional region across different layers. Furthermore, we find that mild gradients therein are the main culprits behind reduced transferability. In this paper, we introduce a novel Gradient Normalization Scaling method for fine-grained gradient editing to enhance the transferability of adversarial attacks on ViTs. More importantly, we highlight that ViTs, unlike traditional CNNs, exhibit distinct attention regions in the frequency domain. Leveraging this insight, we delve into exploring the frequency domain to further enhance the algorithm's transferability. Through extensive experimentation on various ViT variants and traditional CNN models, we substantiate that the new approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an average performance improvement of 33.54\% and 42.05\% on ViT and CNN models, respectively.

However, these models fail to provide interpretative support for the generated program translations. Moreover, researchers frequently invest substantial time and computational resources in retraining models, yet the improvement in translation accuracy is quite limited. To address these issues, we introduce a novel approach, $k\text{NN-ECD}$, which combines $k$-nearest-neighbor search with a key-value error correction datastore to overwrite the wrong translations of TransCoder-ST. This provides a decision-making basis for interpreting the corrected translations. Building upon this, we further propose $k\text{NN-ECS}_{m}$, a methodology that employs a distributed structure with $m$ sub-datastores connected in series, utilizing $m$ diverse experts for multi-round error correction. Additionally, we put forward a unified name rule, encouraging the datastore to focus more on code logic and structure rather than diverse rare identifiers. Our experimental results show that our approach improves the translation accuracy from 68.9\% to 89.9\% of TransCoder-ST (for translation from Java to Python). This error correction method augments program translation, overcoming the inherent limitations of Transformer-based code translation models, such as resource-intensive retraining requirements and uninterpretable outcomes. | Min Xue, Artur Andrzejak, Marla Leuther |  |

In particular, an interactive imitation learning method such as DAgger, which queries a near-optimal expert to intervene online to collect correction data for addressing the distributional shift challenges that afflict naïve behavioral cloning, can enjoy good performance both in theory and practice without requiring manually specified reward functions and other components of full reinforcement learning methods. In this paper, we explore how off-policy reinforcement learning can enable improved performance under assumptions that are similar but potentially even more practical than those of interactive imitation learning. Our proposed method uses reinforcement learning with user intervention signals themselves as rewards. This relaxes the assumption that intervening experts in interactive imita- tion learning should be near-optimal and enables the algorithm to learn behaviors that improve over the potential suboptimal human expert. We also provide a uni- fied framework to analyze our RL method and DAgger; for which we present the asymptotic analysis of the suboptimal gap for both methods as well as the non- asymptotic sample complexity bound of our method. We then evaluate our method on challenging high-dimensional continuous control simulation benchmarks as well as real-world robotic vision-based manipulation tasks. The results show that it strongly outperforms DAgger-like approaches across the different tasks, especially when the intervening experts are suboptimal. Additional ablations also empirically verify the proposed theoretical justification that the performance of our method is associated with the choice of intervention model and suboptimality of the expert.

Recent works have explored improving transformer efficiency, however often incur computationally expensive re-training procedures or depend on architecture-specific characteristics, thus impeding practical wide-scale adoption. To address these shortcomings, the OPTIN framework leverages intermediate feature distillation, capturing the long-range dependencies of model parameters (coined $\textit{trajectory}$), to produce state-of-the-art results on natural language, image classification, transfer learning, and semantic segmentation tasks $\textit{without re-training}$. Given a FLOP constraint, the OPTIN framework will compress the network while maintaining competitive accuracy performance and improved throughput. Particularly, we show a $\leq 2$% accuracy degradation from NLP baselines and a $0.5$% improvement from state-of-the-art methods on image classification at competitive FLOPs reductions. We further demonstrate the generalization of tasks and architecture with comparative performance using Mask2Former for semantic segmentation and cnn-style networks. OPTIN presents one of the first one-shot efficient frameworks for compressing transformer architectures that generalizes well across different class domains, in particular: natural language and image-related tasks, without $\textit{re-training}$. | Samir Khaki, Konstantinos N.

It originates from the classical Bongard Problems (BPs): Given two sets of images (positive and negative), the model needs to identify the set that query images belong to by inducing the visual concepts, which is exclusively depicted by images from the positive set. Our benchmark inherits the few-shot concept induction of the original BPs while adding the two novel layers of challenge: 1) open-world free-form concepts, as the visual concepts in Bongard-OpenWorld are unique compositions of terms from an open vocabulary, ranging from object categories to abstract visual attributes and commonsense factual knowledge; 2) real-world images, as opposed to the synthetic diagrams used by many counterparts. In our exploration, Bongard-OpenWorld already imposes a significant challenge to current few-shot reasoning algorithms. We further investigate to which extent the recently introduced Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can solve our task, by directly probing VLMs, and combining VLMs and LLMs in an interactive reasoning scheme. We even conceived a neuro-symbolic reasoning approach that reconciles LLMs & VLMs with logical reasoning to emulate the human problem-solving process for Bongard Problems. However, none of these approaches manage to close the human-machine gap, as the best learner achieves 64% accuracy while human participants easily reach 91%. We hope Bongard-OpenWorld can help us better understand the limitations of current visual intelligence and facilitate future research on visual agents with stronger few-shot visual reasoning capabilities. | Rujie Wu, Xiaojian Ma, Zhenliang Zhang, Wei Wang, Qing Li, SongChun Zhu, Yizhou Wang |  |

However, their inherent limitation in comprehending 3D molecular structures has considerably constrained their potential in the biomolecular domain. To bridge this gap, we focus on 3D molecule-text interpretation, and propose 3D-MoLM: 3D-Molecular Language Modeling. Specifically, 3D-MoLM enables an LM to interpret and analyze 3D molecules by equipping the LM with a 3D molecular encoder. This integration is achieved by a 3D molecule-text projector, bridging the 3D molecular encoder’s representation space and the LM’s input space. Moreover, to enhance 3DMoLM’s ability of cross-modal molecular understanding and instruction following, we meticulously curated a 3D molecule-centric instruction tuning dataset – 3D-MoIT. Through 3D molecule-text alignment and 3D molecule-centric instruction tuning, 3D-MoLM establishes an integration of 3D molecular encoder and LM. It significantly surpasses existing baselines on downstream tasks, including moleculetext retrieval, molecule captioning, and more challenging open-text molecular QA tasks, especially focusing on 3D-dependent properties.

In order to improve training and data efficiency, we here push the limits of pruning large-scale multimodal datasets for training CLIP-style models. Today’s most effective pruning method on ImageNet clusters data samples into separate concepts according to their embedding and prunes away the most proto- typical samples. We scale this approach to LAION and improve it by noting that the pruning rate should be concept-specific and adapted to the complexity of the concept. Using a simple and intuitive complexity measure, we are able to reduce the training cost to a quarter of regular training. More specifically, we are able to outperform the LAION-trained OpenCLIP-ViT-B/32 model on ImageNet zero-shot accuracy by 1.1p.p. while only using 27.7% of the data and training compute. On the DataComp Medium benchmark, we achieve a new state-of-the-art ImageNet zero-shot accuracy and a competitive average zero-shot accuracy on 38 evaluation tasks. | Amro Abbas, Evgenia Rusak, Kushal Tirumala, Wieland Brendel, Kamalika Chaudhuri, Ari S.

Therefore, it becomes essential to offer explanations for the decisions made by these non-linear and complex parameterized models. Attribution methods are promising for this goal, yet its performance can be further improved. In this paper, for the first time, we present that the decision boundary exploration approaches of attribution are consistent with the process for transferable adversarial attacks. Specifically, the transferable adversarial attacks craft general adversarial samples from the source model, which is consistent with the generation of adversarial samples that can cross multiple decision boundaries in attribution. Utilizing this consistency, we introduce a novel attribution method via model parameter exploration. Furthermore, inspired by the capability of frequency exploration to investigate the model parameters, we provide enhanced explainability for DNNs by manipulating the input features based on frequency information to explore the decision boundaries of different models. Large-scale experiments demonstrate that our \textbf{A}ttribution method for \textbf{E}xplanation with model parameter e\textbf{X}ploration (AttEXplore) outperforms other state-of-the-art interpretability methods. Moreover, by employing other transferable attack techniques, AttEXplore can explore potential variations in attribution outcomes.

Sparse attacks aim to discover a minimum number—the $l_0$ bounded—perturbations to model inputs to craft adversarial examples and misguide model decisions. But, in contrast to query-based dense attack counterparts against black-box models, constructing sparse adversarial perturbations, even when models serve confidence score information to queries in a score-based setting, is non-trivial. Because, such an attack leads to: i) an NP-hard problem; and ii) a non-differentiable search space. We develop the BRUSLEATTACK—a new, faster (more query-efficient) algorithm formulation for the problem. We conduct extensive attack evaluations including an attack demonstration against a Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) offering exemplified by __Google Cloud Vision__ and robustness testing of adversarial training regimes and a recent defense against black-box attacks. The proposed attack scales to achieve state-of-the-art attack success rates and query efficiency on standard computer vision tasks such as ImageNet across different model architectures. Our artifacts and DIY attack samples are available on GitHub. Importantly, our work facilitates faster evaluation of model vulnerabilities and raises our vigilance on the safety, security and reliability of deployed systems. | Viet Quoc Vo, Ehsan Abbasnejad, Damith Ranasinghe |  |

However, training vision transformers for high-resolution pixelwise tasks has a prohibitive cost. Typical solutions boil down to hierarchical architectures, fast and approximate attention, or training on low-resolution crops. This latter solution does not constrain architectural choices, but it leads to a clear performance drop when testing at resolutions significantly higher than that used for training, thus requiring ad-hoc and slow post-processing schemes. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy for efficient training and inference of high-resolution vision transformers. The key principle is to mask out most of the high-resolution inputs during training, keeping only N random windows. This allows the model to learn local interactions between tokens inside each window, and global interactions between tokens from different windows. As a result, the model can directly process the high-resolution input at test time without any special trick. We show that this strategy is effective when using relative positional embedding such as rotary embeddings. It is 4 times faster to train than a full-resolution network, and it is straightforward to use at test time compared to existing approaches. We apply this strategy to three dense prediction tasks with high-resolution data. First, we show on the task of semantic segmentation that a simple setting with 2 windows performs best, hence the name of our method: Win-Win. Second, we confirm this result on the task of monocular depth prediction. Third, to demonstrate the generality of our contribution, we further extend it to the binocular task of optical flow, reaching state-of-the-art performance on the Spring benchmark that contains Full-HD images with an order of magnitude faster inference than the best competitor | Vincent Leroy, Jérôme Revaud, Thomas Lucas, Philippe Weinzaepfel |  |

To address this issue, we propose COSA, a COncatenated SAmple pretrained vision-language foundation model. COSA can jointly model visual contents and event-level temporal cues using only image-text corpora. We achieve this by sequentially concatenating multiple image-text pairs as inputs for pretraining. This transformation effectively converts existing image-text corpora into a pseudo video-paragraph corpus, enabling richer scene transformations and explicit event-description correspondence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that COSA consistently improves performance across a broad range of semantic vision-language downstream tasks, including paragraph-to-video retrieval, text-to-video/image retrieval, video/image captioning and video QA. Notably, COSA achieves state-of-the-art results on various competitive benchmarks.

As a result of the complex relationships between the computational path of output variables in structured models, a feature may impact an output value via other output variables. We focus on one of the outputs as the target and try to find the most important features adopted by the structured model to decide on the target in each locality of the input space. We consider an arbitrary structured output model available as a black-box and argue that considering correlations among output variables can improve explanation quality. The goal is to train a function as an interpreter for the target output variable over the input space. We introduce an energy-based training process for the interpreter function, which effectively considers the structural information incorporated into the model to be explained. The proposed method's effectiveness is confirmed using various simulated and real data sets. | Seyyede Fatemeh Seyyedsalehi, Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah, Hamid R. Rabiee |  |

However, current watermark detection algorithms require the secret key used in the watermark generation process, making them susceptible to security breaches and counterfeiting during public detection. To address this limitation, we propose an unforgeable publicly verifiable watermark algorithm named UPV that uses two different neural networks for watermark generation and detection, instead of using the same key at both stages. Meanwhile, the token embedding parameters are shared between the generation and detection networks, which makes the detection network achieve a high accuracy very efficiently. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm attains high detection accuracy and computational efficiency through neural networks. Subsequent analysis confirms the high complexity involved in forging the watermark from the detection network.

However, adversarial attacks, particularly through the injection of adversarial examples (AEs), pose serious challenges to the security of VFL models. In this paper, we investigate such vulnerabilities through developing a novel attack to disrupt the VFL inference process, under a practical scenario where the adversary is able to \*adaptively corrupt a subset of clients\*. We formulate the problem of finding optimal attack strategies as an online optimization problem, which is decomposed into an inner problem of adversarial example generation (AEG) and an outer problem of corruption pattern selection (CPS). Specifically, we establish the equivalence between the formulated CPS problem and a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, and propose the Thompson sampling with Empirical maximum reward (E-TS) algorithm for the adversary to efficiently identify the optimal subset of clients for corruption. The key idea of E-TS is to introduce an estimation of the expected maximum reward for each arm, which helps to specify a small set of \*competitive arms\*, on which the exploration for the optimal arm is performed. This significantly reduces the exploration space, which otherwise can quickly become prohibitively large as the number of clients increases. We analytically characterize the regret bound of E-TS, and empirically demonstrate its capability of efficiently revealing the optimal corruption pattern with the highest attack success rate, under various datasets of popular VFL tasks. | Duanyi Yao, Songze Li, Ye Xue, Jin Liu |  |

Meanwhile, they also highlight methodological challenges to be addressed. In particular, general non-convex problems often present multiple optimal solutions for identical inputs, signifying a complex, multi-valued input-solution mapping. Conventional learning techniques, primarily tailored to learn single-valued mappings, struggle to train NNs to accurately decipher multi-valued ones, leading to inferior solutions. We address this fundamental issue by developing a generative learning approach using a rectified flow (RectFlow) model built upon ordinary differential equations. In contrast to learning input-solution mapping, we learn the mapping from input to solution distribution, exploiting the universal approximation capability of the RectFlow model. Upon receiving a new input, we employ the trained RectFlow model to sample high-quality solutions from the input-dependent distribution it has learned. Our approach outperforms conceivable GAN and Diffusion models in terms of training stability and run-time complexity. We provide a detailed characterization of the optimality loss and runtime complexity associated with our generative approach. Simulation results for solving non-convex problems show that our method achieves significantly better solution optimality than recent NN schemes, with comparable feasibility and speedup performance. | Enming Liang, Minghua Chen |  |

However, the nature of the learned relationships is opaque making it difficult to understand precisely what relationships between words and parts of an image are captured, or to predict the effect of an intervention. We illuminate the fine-grained relationships learned by diffusion models by noticing a precise relationship between diffusion and information decomposition. Exact expressions for mutual information and conditional mutual information can be written in terms of the denoising model. Furthermore, ${pointwise}$ estimates can be easily estimated as well, allowing us to ask questions about the relationships between specific images and captions. Decomposing information even further to understand which variables in a high-dimensional space carry information is a long-standing problem. For diffusion models, we show that a natural non-negative decomposition of mutual information emerges, allowing us to quantify informative relationships between words and pixels in an image. We exploit these new relations to measure the compositional understanding of diffusion models, to do unsupervised localization of objects in images, and to measure effects when selectively editing images through prompt interventions. | Xianghao Kong, Ollie Liu, Han Li, Dani Yogatama, Greg Ver Steeg |  |

Producing these predictions might be a costly operation – this motivated Im et al. [2022] to introduce the study of algorithms which use predictions parsimoniously. We design parsimonious algorithms for caching and MTS with action predictions, proposed by Antoniadis et al. [2023], focusing on the parameters of consistency (performance with perfect predictions) and smoothness (dependence of their performance on prediction error). Our algorithm for caching is 1-consistent, robust, and its smoothness deteriorates with decreasing number of available predictions. We propose an algorithm for general MTS whose consistency and smoothness both scale linearly with the decreasing number of predictions. Without restriction on the number of available predictions, both algorithms match the earlier guarantees achieved by Antoniadis et al. [2023]. | Karim Abdel Sadek, Marek Eliás |  |

However, we present that the two-timescale extragradient method can be a viable solution. By utilizing dynamical systems theory, we show that it converges to points that satisfy the second-order necessary condition of local minimax points, under mild conditions that the two-timescale gradient descent ascent fails to work. This work provably improves upon all previous results on finding local minimax points, by eliminating a crucial assumption that the Hessian with respect to the maximization variable is nondegenerate. | Jiseok Chae, Kyuwon Kim, Donghwan Kim |  |

While previous ICRL works often neglected underlying uncertainties during training, we contend that modeling these uncertainties is crucial for facilitating robust constraint inference. This insight leads to the development of an Uncertainty-aware Inverse Constrained Reinforcement Learning (UAICRL) algorithm. Specifically, 1) aleatoric uncertainty arises from the inherent stochasticity of environment dynamics, leading to constraint-violating behaviors in imitation policies. To address this, UAICRL constructs risk-sensitive constraints by incorporating distributional Bellman updates into the cumulative costs model. 2) Epistemic uncertainty, resulting from the model's limited knowledge of Out-of-Distribution (OoD) samples, affects the accuracy of step-wise cost predictions. To tackle this issue, UAICRL develops an information-theoretic quantification of the epistemic uncertainty and mitigates its impact through flow-based generative data augmentation. Empirical results demonstrate that UAICRL consistently outperforms other baselines in continuous and discrete environments with stochastic dynamics. The code is available at https://github.com/Jasonxu1225/UAICRL. | Sheng Xu, Guiliang Liu |  |

However, their large memory requirements, including parameter memory and activation memory, have become a significant challenge for their practical serving. While existing methods mainly address parameter memory, the importance of activation memory has been overlooked. Especially for long input sequences, activation memory is expected to experience a significant exponential growth as the length of sequences increases. In this approach, we propose AutoChunk, an automatic and adaptive compiler system that efficiently reduces activation memory for long sequence inference by chunk strategies. The proposed system generates chunk plans by optimizing through multiple stages. In each stage, the chunk search pass explores all possible chunk candidates and the chunk selection pass identifies the optimal one. At runtime, AutoChunk employs code generation to automatically apply chunk strategies. The experiments demonstrate that AutoChunk can reduce over 80% of activation memory while maintaining speed loss within 10%, extend max sequence length by 3.2x to 11.7x, and outperform state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. | Xuanlei Zhao, Shenggan Cheng, Guangyang Lu, Haotian Zhou, Bin Jia, Yang You |  |

Among them, implicit GNNs have shown a superior ability to effectively capture long-range dependencies in underlying graphs. However, implicit GNNs tend to be computationally expensive and have high memory usage, due to 1) their use of full-batch training; and 2) they require a large number of iterations to solve a fixed-point equation. These compromise the scalability and efficiency of implicit GNNs especially on large graphs. In this paper, we aim to answer the question: how can we efficiently train implicit GNNs to provide effective predictions on large graphs? We propose a new scalable and effective implicit GNN (SEIGNN) with a mini-batch training method and a stochastic solver, which can be trained efficiently on large graphs. Specifically, SEIGNN can more effectively incorporate global and long-range information by introducing coarse-level nodes in the mini-batch training method. It also achieves reduced training time by obtaining unbiased approximate solutions with fewer iterations in the proposed solver. Comprehensive experiments on various large graphs demonstrate that SEIGNN outperforms baselines and achieves higher accuracy with less training time compared with existing implicit GNNs. | Juncheng Liu, Bryan Hooi, Kenji Kawaguchi, Yiwei Wang, Chaosheng Dong, Xiaokui Xiao |  |
| 1432 |  |  [Retrieval is Accurate Generation](https://openreview.net/forum?id=oXYZJXDdo7) |  | 0 | Standard language models generate text by selecting tokens from a fixed, finite, and standalone vocabulary. We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents. One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents. To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation. For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.61% to 81.58% in open-ended text generation. Remarkably, our model also achieves the best performance and the lowest latency among several retrieval-augmented baselines. In conclusion, we assert that retrieval is more accurate generation and hope that our work will encourage further research on this new paradigm shift. | Bowen Cao, Deng Cai, Leyang Cui, Xuxin Cheng, Wei Bi, Yuexian Zou, Shuming Shi |  |
| 1433 |  |  [Towards Imitation Learning to Branch for MIP: A Hybrid Reinforcement Learning based Sample Augmentation Approach](https://openreview.net/forum?id=NdcQQ82mfy) |  | 0 | Branch-and-bound (B\&B) has long been favored for tackling complex Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) problems, where the choice of branching strategy plays a pivotal role. Recently, Imitation Learning (IL)-based policies have emerged as potent alternatives to traditional rule-based approaches. However, it is nontrivial to acquire high-quality training samples, and IL often converges to suboptimal variable choices for branching, restricting the overall performance. In response to these challenges, we propose a novel hybrid online and offline reinforcement learning (RL) approach to enhance the branching policy by cost-effective training sample augmentation. In the online phase, we train an online RL agent to dynamically decide the sample generation processes, drawing from either the learning-based policy or the expert policy. The objective is to strike a balance between exploration and exploitation of the sample generation process. In the offline phase, a value function is trained to fit each decision's cumulative reward and filter the samples with high cumulative returns. This dual-purpose function not only reduces training complexity but also enhances the quality of the samples. To assess the efficacy of our data augmentation mechanism, we conduct comprehensive evaluations across a range of MIP problems. The results consistently show that it excels in making superior branching decisions compared to state-of-the-art learning-based models and the open-source solver SCIP. Notably, it even often outperforms Gurobi. | Changwen Zhang, Wenli Ouyang, Hao Yuan, Liming Gong, Yong Sun, Ziao Guo, Zhichen Dong, Junchi Yan |  |

With hundreds of graph pre-training tasks proposed, integrating knowledge acquired from multiple pre-training tasks has become a popular research topic. In this paper, we identify two important collaborative processes for this topic: (1) select: how to select an optimal task combination from a given task pool based on their compatibility, and (2) weigh: how to weigh the selected tasks based on their importance. While there currently has been a lot of work focused on weighing, comparatively little effort has been devoted to selecting. This paper proposes a novel instance-level framework for integrating multiple graph pre-training tasks, Weigh And Select (WAS), where the two collaborative processes, weighing and selecting, are combined by decoupled siamese networks. Specifically, it first adaptively learns an optimal combination of tasks for each instance from a given task pool, based on which a customized instance-level task weighing strategy is learned. Extensive experiments on 16 graph datasets across node-level and graph-level downstream tasks have demonstrated that by combining a few simple but classical tasks, WAS can achieve comparable performance to other leading counterparts.

In the context of Fed-LT, existing works have predominantly centered on addressing the data imbalance issue to enhance the efficacy of the generic global model while neglecting the performance at the local level. In contrast, conventional Personalized Federated Learning (pFL) techniques are primarily devised to optimize personalized local models under the presumption of a balanced global data distribution. This paper introduces an approach termed Federated Local and Generic Model Training in Fed-LT (FedLoGe), which enhances both local and generic model performance through the integration of representation learning and classifier alignment within a neural collapse framework. Our investigation reveals the feasibility of employing a shared backbone as a foundational framework for capturing overarching global trends, while concurrently employing individualized classifiers to encapsulate distinct refinements stemming from each client’s local features. Building upon this discovery, we establish the Static Sparse Equiangular Tight Frame Classifier (SSE-C), inspired by neural collapse principles that naturally prune extraneous noisy features and foster the acquisition of potent data representations. Furthermore, leveraging insights from imbalance neural collapse's classifier norm patterns, we develop Global and Local Adaptive Feature Realignment (GLA-FR) via an auxiliary global classifier and personalized Euclidean norm transfer to align global features with client preferences. Extensive experimental results on CIFAR-10/100-LT, ImageNet, and iNaturalist demonstrate the advantage of our method over state-of-the-art pFL and Fed-LT approaches. | Zikai Xiao, Zihan Chen, Liyinglan Liu, Yang Feng, Joey Tianyi Zhou, Jian Wu, Wanlu Liu, Howard Hao Yang, Zuozhu Liu |  |

MAP IT aligns distributions over discrete marginal probabilities in the input space versus the target space, thus capturing information in local regions, as opposed to current methods which align based on individual probabilities between pairs of data points (states) only. The MAP IT theory reveals that alignment based on a projective divergence avoids normalization of weights (to obtain true probabilities) entirely, and further reveals a dual viewpoint via continuous densities and kernel smoothing. MAP IT is shown to produce visualizations which capture class structure better than the current state of the art while being inherently scalable. | Robert Jenssen |  |

The problems in the real world often require solutions, combining knowledge from STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math). Unlike existing datasets, our dataset requires the understanding of multimodal vision-language information of STEM. Our dataset features one of the largest and most comprehensive datasets for the challenge. It includes $448$ skills and $1,073,146$ questions spanning all STEM subjects. Compared to existing datasets that often focus on examining expert-level ability, our dataset includes fundamental skills and questions designed based on the K-12 curriculum. We also add state-of-the-art foundation models such as CLIP and GPT-3.5-Turbo to our benchmark. Results show that the recent model advances only help master a very limited number of lower grade-level skills ($2.5$% in the third grade) in our dataset. In fact, these models are still well below (averaging $54.7$%) the performance of elementary students, not to mention near expert-level performance. To understand and increase the performance on our dataset, we teach the models on a training split of our dataset. Even though we observe improved performance, the model performance remains relatively low compared to average elementary students. To solve STEM problems, we will need novel algorithmic innovations from the community. | Jianhao Shen, Ye Yuan, Srbuhi Mirzoyan, Ming Zhang, Chenguang Wang |  |

Their performance is heavily influenced by the size of the neural network. While in supervised learning, the regime of over-parameterization and its benefits are well understood, the situation in RL is much less clear. In this paper, we present a theoretical analysis of the influence of network size and $l_2$-regularization on performance. We identify the ratio between the number of parameters and the number of visited states as a crucial factor and define over-parameterization as the regime when it is larger than one. Furthermore, we observe a double descent phenomenon, i.e., a sudden drop in performance around the parameter/state ratio of one. Leveraging random features and the lazy training regime, we study the regularized Least-Square Temporal Difference (LSTD) algorithm in an asymptotic regime, as both the number of parameters and states go to infinity, maintaining a constant ratio. We derive deterministic limits of both the empirical and the true Mean-Squared Bellman Error (MSBE) that feature correction terms responsible for the double descent. Correction terms vanish when the $l_2$-regularization is increased or the number of unvisited states goes to zero. Numerical experiments with synthetic and small real-world environments closely match the theoretical predictions. | David Brellmann, Eloïse Berthier, David Filliat, Goran Frehse |  |

However, remembering the full history is generally intractable due to the exponential growth in the history space. Maintaining a probability distribution that models the belief over the current state can be used as a sufficient statistic of the history, but its computation requires access to the model of the environment and is often intractable. While SOTA algorithms use Recurrent Neural Networks to compress the observation-action history aiming to learn a sufficient statistic, they lack guarantees of success and can lead to sub-optimal policies. To overcome this, we propose the Wasserstein Belief Updater, an RL algorithm that learns a latent model of the POMDP and an approximation of the belief update under the assumption that the state is observable during training. Our approach comes with theoretical guarantees on the quality of our approximation ensuring that our latent beliefs allow for learning the optimal value function. | Raphaël Avalos, Florent Delgrange, Ann Nowé, Guillermo A.

To alleviate the impact of lacking OOD data, for this task, one feasible solution is to exploit the known in-distribution (ID) data to synthesize proper OOD information for supervision, which strengthens detectors' discrimination. From the frequency perspective, since the phase generally reflects the content of the input, in this paper, we explore leveraging the phase of ID features to generate expected OOD features involving different content. And a method of Modulated Phase Diffusion (MPD) is proposed, containing a shared forward and two different reverse processes. Specifically, after calculating the phase of the extracted features, to prevent the rapid loss of content in the phase, the forward process gradually performs Gaussian Average on the phase instead of adding noise. The averaged phase and original amplitude are combined to obtain the features taken as the input of the reverse process. Next, one OOD branch is defined to synthesize virtual OOD features by continually enlarging the content discrepancy between the OOD features and original ones. Meanwhile, another modulated branch is designed to generate augmented features owning a similar phase as the original features by scaling and shifting the OOD branch. Both original and augmented features are used for training, enhancing the discrimination. Experimental results on OOD-OD, incremental object detection, and open-set object detection demonstrate the superiorities of our method.

Existing evaluation metrics for OPE estimators primarily focus on the "accuracy" of OPE or that of downstream policy selection, neglecting risk-return tradeoff and \*efficiency\* in subsequent online policy deployment. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from portfolio evaluation in finance and develop a new metric, called \*\*SharpeRatio@k\*\*, which measures the risk-return tradeoff and efficiency of policy portfolios formed by an OPE estimator under varying online evaluation budgets ($k$). We first demonstrate, in two example scenarios, that our proposed metric can clearly distinguish between conservative and high-stakes OPE estimators and reliably identify the most \*efficient\* estimator capable of forming superior portfolios of candidate policies that maximize return with minimal risk during online deployment, while existing evaluation metrics produce only degenerate results. To facilitate a quick, accurate, and consistent evaluation of OPE via SharpeRatio@k, we have also implemented the proposed metric in an open-source software. Using SharpeRatio@k and the software, we conduct a benchmark experiment of various OPE estimators regarding their risk-return tradeoff, presenting several future directions for OPE research. | Haruka Kiyohara, Ren Kishimoto, Kosuke Kawakami, Ken Kobayashi, Kazuhide Nakata, Yuta Saito |  |

Existing theoretical studies in this area suffer from at least two of the following obstacles: memory inefficiency, the heavy dependence of sample complexity on the long horizon and the large state space, the high computational complexity, non-Markov policy, non-Nash policy, and high burn-in cost. In this work, we take a step towards settling this problem by designing a model-free self-play algorithm \emph{Memory-Efficient Nash Q-Learning (ME-Nash-QL)} for two-player zero-sum Markov games, which is a specific setting of MARL. We prove that ME-Nash-QL can output an $\varepsilon$-approximate Nash policy with remarkable space complexity $O(SABH)$, sample complexity $\widetilde{O}(H^4SAB/\varepsilon^2)$, and computational complexity $O(T\mathrm{poly}(AB))$, where $S$ is the number of states, $\{A, B\}$ is the number of actions for the two players, $H$ is the horizon length, and $T$ is the number of samples. Notably, our approach outperforms in terms of space complexity compared to existing algorithms for tabular cases. It achieves the lowest computational complexity while preserving Markov policies, setting a new standard. Furthermore, our algorithm outputs a Nash policy and achieves the best sample complexity compared with the existing guarantee for long horizons, i.e. when $\min \\{ A, B \\} \ll H^2$. Our algorithm also achieves the best burn-in cost $O(SAB\,\mathrm{poly}(H))$, whereas previous algorithms need at least $O(S^3 AB\,\mathrm{poly}(H))$ to attain the same level of sample complexity with ours. | Na Li, Yuchen Jiao, Hangguan Shan, Shefeng Yan |  |

Past attempts have been restricted to the case of fully-connected, convolutional, and residual networks. This paper presents a systematic approach for fusing two or more transformer-based networks exploiting Optimal Transport to (soft-)align the various architectural components. We flesh out an abstraction for layer alignment, that can generalize to arbitrary architectures -- in principle -- and we apply this to the key ingredients of Transformers such as multi-head self-attention, layer-normalization, and residual connections, and we discuss how to handle them via various ablation studies. Furthermore, our method allows the fusion of models of different sizes (heterogeneous fusion), providing a new and efficient way to compress Transformers. The proposed approach is evaluated on both image classification tasks via Vision Transformer and natural language modeling tasks using BERT. Our approach consistently outperforms vanilla fusion, and, after a surprisingly short finetuning, also outperforms the individual converged parent models. In our analysis, we uncover intriguing insights about the significant role of soft alignment in the case of Transformers. Our results showcase the potential of fusing multiple Transformers, thus compounding their expertise, in the budding paradigm of model fusion and recombination.

Due to the modular nature of LoRA's plug-and-play plugins, researchers have delved into the amalgamation of multiple LoRAs to empower models to excel across various downstream tasks. Nonetheless, extant approaches for LoRA fusion grapple with inherent challenges. Direct arithmetic merging may result in the loss of the original pre-trained model's generative capabilities or the distinct identity of LoRAs, thereby yielding suboptimal outcomes. On the other hand, Reference tuning-based fusion exhibits limitations concerning the requisite flexibility for the effective combination of multiple LoRAs. In response to these challenges, this paper introduces the Mixture of LoRA Experts (MoLE) approach, which harnesses hierarchical control and unfettered branch selection. The MoLE approach not only achieves superior LoRA fusion performance in comparison to direct arithmetic merging but also retains the crucial flexibility for combining LoRAs effectively. Extensive experimental evaluations conducted in both the Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Vision \& Language (V\&L) domains substantiate the efficacy of MoLE. | Xun Wu, Shaohan Huang, Furu Wei |  |

The latter category of methods makes use of Tweedie's formula, which links the posterior mean in Gaussian denoising (\*i\*.\*e\*., the minimum MSE denoiser) with the score of the data distribution. Here, we derive a fundamental relation between the higher-order central moments of the posterior distribution, and the higher-order derivatives of the posterior mean. We harness this result for uncertainty quantification of pre-trained denoisers. Particularly, we show how to efficiently compute the principal components of the posterior distribution for any desired region of an image, as well as to approximate the full marginal distribution along those (or any other) one-dimensional directions. Our method is fast and memory-efficient, as it does not explicitly compute or store the high-order moment tensors and it requires no training or fine tuning of the denoiser. Code and examples are available on the project [website](https://hilamanor.github.io/GaussianDenoisingPosterior/). | Hila Manor, Tomer Michaeli |  |

This paper proposes a novel neural layer, LogicMP, which performs mean-field variational inference over a Markov Logic Network (MLN). It can be plugged into any off-the-shelf neural network to encode FOLCs while retaining modularity and efficiency. By exploiting the structure and symmetries in MLNs, we theoretically demonstrate that our well-designed, efficient mean-field iterations greatly mitigate the difficulty of MLN inference, reducing the inference from sequential calculation to a series of parallel tensor operations. Empirical results in three kinds of tasks over images, graphs, and text show that LogicMP outperforms advanced competitors in both performance and efficiency. | Weidi Xu, Jingwei Wang, Lele Xie, Jianshan He, Hongting Zhou, Taifeng Wang, Xiaopei Wan, Jingdong Chen, Chao Qu, Wei Chu |  |

Yet, at the same time, these models often show unhuman-like characteristics. In the present paper, we address this gap and ask whether large language models can be turned into cognitive models. We find that -- after finetuning them on data from psychological experiments -- these models offer accurate representations of human behavior, even outperforming traditional cognitive models in two decision-making domains. In addition, we show that their representations contain the information necessary to model behavior on the level of individual subjects. Finally, we demonstrate that finetuning on multiple tasks enables large language models to predict human behavior in a previously unseen task. Taken together, these results suggest that large, pre-trained models can be adapted to become models of human cognition, which opens up future research directions toward building more general cognitive models. | Marcel Binz, Eric Schulz |  |

While ViTs use computationally expensive self-attention operations in every layer, we identify that these operations are highly correlated across layers -- a key redundancy that causes unnecessary computations. Based on this observation, we propose SkipAT a method to reuse self-attention computation from preceding layers to approximate attention at one or more subsequent layers. To ensure that reusing self-attention blocks across layers does not degrade the performance, we introduce a simple parametric function, which outperforms the baseline transformer's performance while running computationally faster. We show that SkipAT is agnostic to transformer architecture and is effective in image classification, semantic segmentation on ADE20K, image denoising on SIDD, and video denoising on DAVIS. We achieve improved throughput at the same-or-higher accuracy levels in all these tasks. | Shashanka Venkataramanan, Amir Ghodrati, Yuki M. Asano, Fatih Porikli, Amirhossein Habibian |  |

This inconsistency between generating and validating an answer is prevalent in language models (LMs) and erodes trust. In this paper, we propose a framework for measuring the consistency between generation and validation (which we call generator-validator consistency, or GV-consistency), finding that even GPT-4 (0613), a state-of-the-art LM, is GV-consistent only 76% of the time. To improve the consistency of LMs, we propose to finetune on the filtered generator and validator responses that are GV-consistent, and call this approach consistency fine-tuning. We find that this approach improves GV-consistency of Alpaca-30B from 60% to 93%, and the improvement extrapolates to unseen tasks and domains (e.g., GV-consistency for positive style transfers extrapolates to unseen styles like humor). In addition to improving consistency, consistency fine-tuning improves both generator quality and validator accuracy without using any labeled data. Evaluated across 6 tasks, including math questions, knowledge-intensive QA, and instruction following, our method improves generator quality by an average of 16% and validator accuracy by an average of 6.3% across all tasks. | Xiang Lisa Li, Vaishnavi Shrivastava, Siyan Li, Tatsunori Hashimoto, Percy Liang |  |

The most successful defense technique based on adversarial training (AT) can achieve optimal robustness against particular attacks but cannot generalize well to unseen attacks. Another effective defense technique based on adversarial purification (AP) can enhance generalization but cannot achieve optimal robustness. Meanwhile, both methods share one common limitation on the degraded standard accuracy. To mitigate these issues, we propose a novel pipeline to acquire the robust purifier model, named Adversarial Training on Purification (AToP), which comprises two components: perturbation destruction by random transforms (RT) and purifier model fine-tuned (FT) by adversarial loss. RT is essential to avoid overlearning to known attacks, resulting in the robustness generalization to unseen attacks, and FT is essential for the improvement of robustness. To evaluate our method in an efficient and scalable way, we conduct extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNette to demonstrate that our method achieves optimal robustness and exhibits generalization ability against unseen attacks. | Guang Lin, Chao Li, Jianhai Zhang, Toshihisa Tanaka, Qibin Zhao |  |

However, previous approaches treat offline and online learning as separate procedures, resulting in redundant designs and limited performance. We ask: \*Can we achieve straightforward yet effective offline and online learning without introducing extra conservatism or regularization?\* In this study, we propose Uni-O4, which utilizes an on-policy objective for both offline and online learning. Owning to the alignment of objectives in two phases, the RL agent can transfer between offline and online learning seamlessly. This property enhances the flexibility of the learning paradigm, allowing for arbitrary combinations of pretraining, fine-tuning, offline, and online learning. In the offline phase, specifically, Uni-O4 leverages diverse ensemble policies to address the mismatch issues between the estimated behavior policy and the offline dataset. Through a simple offline policy evaluation (OPE) approach, Uni-O4 can achieve multi-step policy improvement safely. We demonstrate that by employing the method above, the fusion of these two paradigms can yield superior offline initialization as well as stable and rapid online fine-tuning capabilities. Through real-world robot tasks, we highlight the benefits of this paradigm for rapid deployment in challenging, previously unseen real-world environments. Additionally, through comprehensive evaluations using numerous simulated benchmarks, we substantiate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both offline and offline-to-online fine-tuning learning.

While excelling in generating images from short, single-object descriptions, these models often struggle to faithfully capture all the nuanced details within longer and more elaborate textual inputs. In response, we present a novel approach leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract critical components from text prompts, including bounding box coordinates for foreground objects, detailed textual descriptions for individual objects, and a succinct background context. These components form the foundation of our layout-to-image generation model, which operates in two phases. The initial Global Scene Generation utilizes object layouts and background context to create an initial scene but often falls short in faithfully representing object characteristics as specified in the prompts. To address this limitation, we introduce an Iterative Refinement Scheme that iteratively evaluates and refines box-level content to align them with their textual descriptions, recomposing objects as needed to ensure consistency. Our evaluation on complex prompts featuring multiple objects demonstrates a substantial improvement in recall compared to baseline diffusion models. This is further validated by a user study, underscoring the efficacy of our approach in generating coherent and detailed scenes from intricate textual inputs. Our iterative framework offers a promising solution for enhancing text-to-image generation models' fidelity with lengthy, multifaceted descriptions, opening new possibilities for accurate and diverse image synthesis from textual inputs. | Hanan Gani, Shariq Farooq Bhat, Muzammal Naseer, Salman Khan, Peter Wonka |  |

Ensuring fairness in machine learning is important for ethical compliance. However, there exist challenges in comparing and developing fairness methods due to inconsistencies in experimental settings, lack of accessible algorithmic implementations, and limited extensibility of current fairness packages and tools. To address these issues, we introduce an open-source standardized benchmark for evaluating in-processing group fairness methods and provide a comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art methods to ensure different notions of group fairness. This work offers the following key contributions: the provision of flexible, extensible, minimalistic, and research-oriented open-source code; the establishment of unified fairness method benchmarking pipelines; and extensive benchmarking, which yields key insights from 45,079 experiments, 14,428 GPU hours. We believe that our work will significantly facilitate the growth and development of the fairness research community.

This is done by combining variational autoencoders and (spatio-)temporal transformers within a framework designed to enforce certain scientifically-motivated invariances. The models allow inference of system behavior at any continuous time and generalization well beyond the data distributions seen during training. Furthermore, the models do not require an explicit neural ODE formulation, making them efficient and highly scalable in practice. We study behavior through simple theoretical analyses and extensive empirical experiments. The latter investigate the ability to predict the trajectories of complicated systems based on finite data and show that the proposed approaches can outperform existing neural-dynamical models. We study also more general inductive bias in the context of transfer to data obtained under entirely novel system interventions. Overall, our results provide a new framework for efficiently learning complicated dynamics in a data-driven manner, with potential applications in a wide range of fields including physics, biology, and engineering. | Kai Lagemann, Christian Lagemann, Sach Mukherjee |  |

Remarkable achievements have been made in significantly reducing the solving time compared to traditional numerical solvers. These methods are typically designed to i) reduce the computational cost in solving physical dynamics and/or ii) propose techniques to enhance the solution accuracy in fluid and rigid body dynamics. However, it remains under-explored whether they are effective in addressing the challenges of flexible body dynamics, where instantaneous collisions occur within a very short timeframe. In this paper, we present Hierarchical Contact Mesh Transformer (HCMT), which uses hierarchical mesh structures and can learn long-range dependencies (occurred by collisions) among spatially distant positions of a body --- two close positions in a higher-level mesh correspond to two distant positions in a lower-level mesh. HCMT enables long-range interactions, and the hierarchical mesh structure quickly propagates collision effects to faraway positions. To this end, it consists of a contact mesh Transformer and a hierarchical mesh Transformer (CMT and HMT, respectively). Lastly, we propose a flexible body dynamics dataset, consisting of trajectories that reflect experimental settings frequently used in the display industry for product designs. We also compare the performance of several baselines using well-known benchmark datasets. Our results show that HCMT provides significant performance improvements over existing methods.

In this paper, we focus on speeding up pre-training by progressively growing from a small Transformer structure to a large one. There are two main research problems associated with progressive growth: determining the optimal growth schedule, and designing efficient growth operators. In terms of growth schedule, the impact of each single dimension on a schedule’s efficiency is underexplored by existing work. Regarding the growth operators, existing methods rely on the initialization of new weights to inherit knowledge, and achieve only non-strict function preservation, limiting further improvements on training dynamics. To address these issues, we propose Masked Structural Growth (MSG), including (i) growth schedules involving all possible dimensions and (ii) strictly function-preserving growth operators that is independent of the initialization of new weights. Experiments show that MSG is significantly faster than related work: we achieve up to 2.2x speedup in pre-training different types of language models while maintaining comparable or better downstream performances.

However, while LLMs can utilize extensive background knowledge and task information with in-context learning, most VLMs still struggle with understanding complex multi-modal prompts with multiple images, making VLMs less effective in downstream vision-language tasks. In this paper, we address the limitation above by 1) introducing vision-language Model with \*\*M\*\*ulti-\*\*M\*\*odal \*\*I\*\*n-\*\*C\*\*ontext \*\*L\*\*earning(MMICL), a new approach to allow the VLM to deal with multi-modal inputs efficiently; 2) proposing a novel context scheme to augment the in-context learning ability of the VLM; 3) constructing the Multi-modal In-Context Learning (MIC) dataset, designed to enhance the VLM's ability to understand complex multi-modal prompts. Our experiments confirm that MMICL achieves new state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on a wide range of general vision-language tasks, especially for complex benchmarks, including MME and MMBench. Our analysis demonstrates that MMICL effectively tackles the challenge of complex multi-modal prompt understanding and emerges the impressive ICL ability. Furthermore, we observe that MMICL successfully alleviates language bias in VLMs, a common issue for VLMs that often leads to hallucination when faced with extensive textual context.

These models rely on proper human instructions (or prompts) to generate suitable responses. However, the potential of LLMs are not fully harnessed by commonly-used prompting methods: many human-in-the-loop algorithms employ ad-hoc procedures for prompt selection; while auto prompt generation approaches are essentially searching all possible prompts randomly and inefficiently. We propose Evoke, an automatic prompt refinement framework. In Evoke, there are two instances of a same LLM: one as a reviewer (LLM-Reviewer), it scores the current prompt; the other as an author (LLM-Author), it edits the prompt by considering the edit history and the reviewer's feedback. Such an author-reviewer feedback loop ensures that the prompt is refined in each iteration. We further aggregate a data selection approach to Evoke, where only the hard samples are exposed to the LLM. The hard samples are more important because the LLM can develop deeper understanding of the tasks out of them, while the model may already know how to solve the easier cases. Experimental results show that Evoke significantly outperforms existing methods. For instance, in the challenging task of logical fallacy detection, Evoke scores above 80, while all other baseline methods struggle to reach 20. | Xinyu Hu, Pengfei Tang, Simiao Zuo, Zihan Wang, Bowen Song, Qiang Lou, Jian Jiao, Denis Charles |  |

This noise leads to condition mismatch and quality degradation of generated data. This paper proposes Transition-aware weighted Denoising Score Matching (TDSM) for training conditional diffusion models with noisy labels, which is the first study in the line of diffusion models. The TDSM objective contains a weighted sum of score networks, incorporating instance-wise and time-dependent label transition probabilities. We introduce a transition-aware weight estimator, which leverages a time-dependent noisy-label classifier distinctively customized to the diffusion process. Through experiments across various datasets and noisy label settings, TDSM improves the quality of generated samples aligned with given conditions. Furthermore, our method improves generation performance even on prevalent benchmark datasets, which implies the potential noisy labels and their risk of generative model learning. Finally, we show the improved performance of TDSM on top of conventional noisy label corrections, which empirically proving its contribution as a part of label-noise robust generative models.

To model such data, temporal point processes (TPPs) have emerged as the most natural and competitive models, making a significant impact in both academic and application communities. Despite the emergence of many powerful models in recent years, there hasn't been a central benchmark for these models and future research endeavors. This lack of standardization impedes researchers and practitioners from comparing methods and reproducing results, potentially slowing down progress in this field. In this paper, we present EasyTPP, the first central repository of research assets (e.g., data, models, evaluation programs, documentations) in the area of event sequence modeling. Our EasyTPP makes several unique contributions to this area: a unified interface of using existing datasets and adding new datasets; a wide range of evaluation programs that are easy to use and extend as well as facilitate reproducible research; implementations of popular neural TPPs, together with a rich library of modules by composing which one could quickly build complex models. We will actively maintain this benchmark and welcome contributions from other researchers and practitioners. Our benchmark will help promote reproducible research in this field, thus accelerating research progress as well as making more significant real-world impacts.

Many efforts have been dedicated to deriving score functions based on logits, distances, or rigorous data distribution assumptions to identify low-scoring OOD samples. Nevertheless, these estimate scores may fail to accurately reflect the true data density or impose impractical constraints. To provide a unified perspective on density-based score design, we propose a novel theoretical framework grounded in Bregman divergence, which extends distribution considerations to encompass an exponential family of distributions. Leveraging the conjugation constraint revealed in our theorem, we introduce a \textsc{ConjNorm} method, reframing density function design as a search for the optimal norm coefficient $p$ against the given dataset. In light of the computational challenges of normalization, we devise an unbiased and analytically tractable estimator of the partition function using the Monte Carlo-based importance sampling technique. Extensive experiments across OOD detection benchmarks empirically demonstrate that our proposed \textsc{ConjNorm} has established a new state-of-the-art in a variety of OOD detection setups, outperforming the current best method by up to 13.25\% and 28.19\% (FPR95) on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K, respectively. | Bo Peng, Yadan Luo, Yonggang Zhang, Yixuan Li, Zhen Fang |  |

Existing image deblurring methods predominantly focus on global deblurring, inadvertently affecting the sharpness of backgrounds in locally blurred images and wasting unnecessary computation on sharp pixels, especially for high-resolution images. This paper aims to adaptively and efficiently restore high-resolution locally blurred images. We propose a local motion deblurring vision Transformer (LMD-ViT) built on adaptive window pruning Transformer blocks (AdaWPT). To focus deblurring on local regions and reduce computation, AdaWPT prunes unnecessary windows, only allowing the active windows to be involved in the deblurring processes. The pruning operation relies on the blurriness confidence predicted by a confidence predictor that is trained end-to-end using a reconstruction loss with Gumbel-Softmax re-parameterization and a pruning loss guided by annotated blur masks. Our method removes local motion blur effectively without distorting sharp regions, demonstrated by its exceptional perceptual and quantitative improvements (+0.28dB) compared to state-of-the-art methods. In addition, our approach substantially reduces FLOPs by 66% and achieves more than a twofold increase in inference speed compared to Transformer-based deblurring methods. We will make our code and annotated blur masks publicly available. | Haoying Li, Jixin Zhao, Shangchen Zhou, Huajun Feng, Chongyi Li, Chen Change Loy |  |

Sampling from DPMs can be viewed as solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE). Despite the promising performance, the generation of DPMs usually consumes much time due to the large number of function evaluations (NFE). Though recent works have accelerated the sampling to around 20 steps with high-order solvers, the sample quality with less than 10 NFE can still be improved. In this paper, we propose a unified sampling framework (USF) to study the optional strategies for solver. Under this framework, we further reveal that taking different solving strategies at different timesteps may help further decrease the truncation error, and a carefully designed \emph{solver schedule} has the potential to improve the sample quality by a large margin. Therefore, we propose a new sampling framework based on the exponential integral formulation that allows free choices of solver strategy at each step and design specific decisions for the framework. Moreover, we propose $S^3$, a predictor-based search method that automatically optimizes the solver schedule to get a better time-quality trade-off of sampling. We demonstrate that $S^3$ can find outstanding solver schedules which outperform the state-of-the-art sampling methods on CIFAR-10, CelebA, ImageNet-64, and LSUN-Bedroom datasets. Specifically, we achieve 2.69 FID with 9 NFE and 6.86 FID with 5 NFE on CIFAR-10 dataset, outperforming the SOTA method significantly. We further apply $S^3$ to Stable-Diffusion model and get an acceleration ratio of 2$\times$, showing the feasibility of sampling in very few steps without retraining of the neural network. | Enshu Liu, Xuefei Ning, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang |  |

In this game, the first player chooses a representation, and then the second player adversarially chooses a prediction task from a given class, representing the prior knowledge. The first player aims to minimize, and the second player to maximize, the regret: The minimal prediction loss using the representation, compared to the same loss using the original features. We consider the canonical setting in which the representation, the response to predict and the predictors are all linear functions, and the loss function is the mean squared error. We derive the theoretically optimal representation in pure strategies, which shows the effectiveness of the prior knowledge, and the optimal regret in mixed strategies, which shows the usefulness of randomizing the representation. For general representation, prediction and loss functions, we propose an efficient algorithm to optimize a randomized representation. The algorithm only requires the gradients of the loss function, and is based on incrementally adding a representation rule to a mixture of such rules. | Neria Uzan, Nir Weinberger |  |

This paper presents a neuron-enhanced autoencoder matrix completion (AEMC-NE) method and applies it to collaborative filtering. Our AEMC-NE adds an element-wise autoencoder to each output of the main autoencoder to enhance the reconstruction capability. Thus it can adaptively learn an activation function for the output layer to approximate possibly complicated response functions in real data. We provide theoretical analysis for AEMC-NE as well as AEMC to investigate the generalization ability of autoencoder and deep learning in matrix completion, considering both missing completely at random and missing not at random. We show that the element-wise neural network has the potential to reduce the generalization error bound, the data sparsity can be useful, and the prediction performance is closely related to the difference between the numbers of variables and samples. The numerical results on synthetic data and benchmark datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of AEMC-NE in comparison to many baselines. | Jicong Fan, Rui Chen, Zhao Zhang, Chris Ding |  |

By training on randomly sampled subsets of coordinates and denoising content only at those locations, we learn a continuous function for arbitrary resolution sampling. Unlike prior neural field-based infinite-dimensional models, which use point-wise functions requiring latent compression, our method employs non-local integral operators to map between Hilbert spaces, allowing spatial context aggregation. This is achieved with an efficient multi-scale function-space architecture that operates directly on raw sparse coordinates, coupled with a mollified diffusion process that smooths out irregularities. Through experiments on high-resolution datasets, we found that even at an $8\times$ subsampling rate, our model retains high-quality diffusion. This leads to significant run-time and memory savings, delivers samples with lower FID scores, and scales beyond the training resolution while retaining detail. | Sam BondTaylor, Chris G.

In this work, we start by undertaking a rigorous theoretical derivation of the stochastic modified equations, with the primary aim of providing an effective approximation for the discrete iterative process of dropout. Meanwhile, we experimentally verify SDE's ability to approximate dropout under a wider range of settings. Subsequently, we empirically delve into the intricate mechanisms by which dropout facilitates the identification of flatter minima. This exploration is conducted through intuitive approximations, exploiting the structural analogies inherent in the Hessian of loss landscape and the covariance of dropout. Our empirical findings substantiate the ubiquitous presence of the Hessian-variance alignment relation throughout the training process of dropout. | Zhongwang Zhang, Yuqing Li, Tao Luo, ZhiQin John Xu |  |

In reality, an ideal robust model will probably behave similarly to the oracle (e.g., the human users), thus a good evaluation protocol is probably to evaluate the models’ behaviors in comparison to the oracle. In this paper, we introduce a new robustness measurement that directly measures the image classification model’s performance compared with a surrogate oracle (i.e., a zoo of foundation models). Besides, we design a simple method that can accomplish the evaluation beyond the scope of the benchmarks. Our method extends the image datasets with new samples that are sufficiently perturbed to be distinct from the ones in the original sets, but are still bounded within the same image-label structure the original test image represents, constrained by a zoo of foundation models pretrained with a large amount of samples. As a result, our new method will offer us a new way to evaluate the models’ robustness performance, free of limitations of fixed benchmarks or constrained perturbations, although scoped by the power of the oracle. In addition to the evaluation results, we also leverage our generated data to understand the behaviors of the model and our new evaluation strategies. | Peiyan Zhang, Haoyang Liu, Chaozhuo Li, Xing Xie, Sunghun Kim, Haohan Wang |  |
| 1469 |  |  [Transferring Learning Trajectories of Neural Networks](https://openreview.net/forum?id=bWNJFD1l8M) |  | 0 | Training deep neural networks (DNNs) is computationally expensive, which is problematic especially when performing duplicated or similar training runs in model ensemble or fine-tuning pre-trained models, for example. Once we have trained one DNN on some dataset, we have its learning trajectory (i.e., a sequence of intermediate parameters during training) which may potentially contain useful information for learning the dataset. However, there has been no attempt to utilize such information of a given learning trajectory for another training. In this paper, we formulate the problem of "transferring" a given learning trajectory from one initial parameter to another one (named \*learning transfer problem\*) and derive the first algorithm to approximately solve it by matching gradients successively along the trajectory via permutation symmetry. We empirically show that the transferred parameters achieve non-trivial accuracy before any direct training, and can be trained significantly faster than training from scratch. | Daiki Chijiwa |  |

These challenges necessitate methods that are not only accurate but computationally efficient. Unfortunately, most current state-of-the-art methods for time series forecasting are based on Transformers, which scale poorly due to quadratic complexity in sequence length, and are therefore needlessly computationally inefficient. Moreover, with a few exceptions, these methods have only been evaluated for non-probabilistic point estimation. In this work, we address these two shortcomings. For the first, we introduce VQ-TR, which maps large sequences to a discrete set of latent representations as part of the Attention module. This not only allows us to attend over larger context windows with linear complexity in sequence length but also allows for effective regularization to avoid overfitting. For the second, we provide what is to the best of our knowledge the first systematic comparison of modern Transformer-based time series forecasting methods for probabilistic forecasting. In this comparison, we find that VQ-TR performs better or comparably to all other methods while being computationally efficient. | Kashif Rasul, Andrew Bennett, Pablo Vicente, Umang Gupta, Hena Ghonia, Anderson Schneider, Yuriy Nevmyvaka |  |

MTPP is often used to understand complex dynamics of asynchronous temporal events such as money transaction, social media, healthcare, etc. Recent studies have utilized deep neural networks to capture complex temporal dependencies of events and generate embedding that aptly represent the observed events. While most previous studies focus on the inter-event dependencies and their representations, how individual events influence the overall dynamics over time has been under-explored. In this regime, we propose a Decoupled MTPP framework that disentangles characterization of a stochastic process into a set of evolving influences from different events. Our approach employs Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) to learn flexible continuous dynamics of these influences while simultaneously addressing multiple inference problems, such as density estimation and survival rate computation. We emphasize the significance of disentangling the influences by comparing our framework with state-of-the-art methods on real-life datasets, and provide analysis on the model behavior for potential applications. | Yujee Song, Donghyun Lee, Rui Meng, Won Hwa Kim |  |

First, we develop the ordered $k$-means to group objects into ordered clusters by reducing the deviation of an object from consecutive clusters. Then, we train a network to construct an embedding space, in which objects are sorted compactly along a chain of line segments, determined by the cluster centroids. We alternate the clustering and the network training until convergence. Moreover, we perform unsupervised rank estimation via a simple nearest neighbor search in the embedding space. Extensive experiments on various orderable datasets demonstrate that UOL provides reliable ordered clustering results and decent rank estimation performances with no supervision.

Despite these advantages, prior research has yet to investigate the training dynamics of fixed orthogonal classifiers on neural collapse, a recently clarified phenomenon that last-layer features converge to a specific form, called simplex ETF, in training classification models involving the post-zero-error phase. Ensuring this phenomenon is critical for obtaining global optimality in a layer-peeled model, potentially leading to enhanced performance in practice. However, fixed orthogonal classifiers cannot invoke neural collapse due to their geometric limitations. To overcome the limits, we analyze a $\textit{zero-mean neural collapse}$ considering the orthogonality in non-negative Euclidean space. Then, we propose a $\textit{fixed non-negative orthogonal classifier}$ that induces the optimal solution and maximizes the margin of an orthogonal layer-peeled model by satisfying the properties of zero-mean neural collapse. Building on this foundation, we exploit a $\textit{feature dimension separation}$ effect inherent in our classifier for further purposes: (1) enhances softmax masking by mitigating feature interference in continual learning and (2) tackles the limitations of mixup on the hypersphere in imbalanced learning. We conducted comprehensive experiments on various datasets and architectures and demonstrated significant performance improvements. | Hoyong Kim, Kangil Kim |  |
| 1474 |  |  [MaGIC: Multi-modality Guided Image Completion](https://openreview.net/forum?id=o7x0XVlCpX) |  | 0 | Vanilla image completion approaches exhibit sensitivity to large missing regions, attributed to the limited availability of reference information for plausible generation. To mitigate this, existing methods incorporate the extra cue as guidance for image completion. Despite improvements, these approaches are often restricted to employing a \*single modality\* (e.g., \*segmentation\* or \*sketch\* maps), which lacks scalability in leveraging multi-modality for more plausible completion. In this paper, we propose a novel, simple yet effective method for \*\*M\*\*ulti-mod\*\*a\*\*l \*\*G\*\*uided \*\*I\*\*mage \*\*C\*\*ompletion, dubbed \*\*MaGIC\*\*, which not only supports a wide range of single modality as the guidance (e.g., \*text\*, \*canny edge\*, \*sketch\*, \*segmentation\*, \*depth\*, and \*pose\*), but also adapts to arbitrarily customized combinations of these modalities (i.e., \*arbitrary multi-modality\*) for image completion. For building MaGIC, we first introduce a modality-specific conditional U-Net (MCU-Net) that injects single-modal signal into a U-Net denoiser for single-modal guided image completion. Then, we devise a consistent modality blending (CMB) method to leverage modality signals encoded in multiple learned MCU-Nets through gradient guidance in latent space. Our CMB is \*training-free\*, thereby avoiding the cumbersome joint re-training of different modalities, which is the secret of MaGIC to achieve exceptional flexibility in accommodating new modalities for completion. Experiments show the superiority of MaGIC over state-of-the-art methods and its generalization to various completion tasks. | Hao Wang, Yongsheng Yu, Tiejian Luo, Heng Fan, Libo Zhang |  |

However, the current literature on periodicity detection faces two key challenges: limited robustness in real-world scenarios and a lack of memory to leverage previously observed time series to accelerate and improve inference on new data. To overcome these obstacles, this paper presents AmortizedPeriod, an innovative approach to periodicity identification based on amortized variational inference that integrates Bayesian statistics and deep learning. Through the Bayesian generative process, our method flexibly captures the dependencies of the periods, trends, noise, and outliers in time series, while also considering missing data and irregular periods in a robust manner. In addition, it utilizes the evidence lower bound of the log-likelihood of the observed time series as the loss function to train a deep attention inference network, facilitating knowledge transfer from the seen time series (and their labels) to unseen ones. Experimental results show that AmortizedPeriod surpasses the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin of 28.5% on average in terms of micro $F_1$-score, with at least 55% less inference time. | Hang Yu, Cong Liao, Ruolan Liu, Jianguo Li, Yun Hu, Xinzhe Wang |  |

A Case Study on Learning with Representations](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ikwEDva1JZ) |  | 0 | While large language models based on the transformer architecture have demonstrated remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, understandings of such capabilities are still in an early stage, where existing theory and mechanistic understanding focus mostly on simple scenarios such as learning simple function classes. This paper takes initial steps on understanding ICL in more complex scenarios, by studying learning with \emph{representations}. Concretely, we construct synthetic in-context learning problems with a compositional structure, where the label depends on the input through a possibly complex but \emph{fixed} representation function, composed with a linear function that \emph{differs} in each instance. By construction, the optimal ICL algorithm first transforms the inputs by the representation function, and then performs linear ICL on top of the transformed dataset. We show theoretically the existence of transformers that approximately implement such algorithms with mild depth and size. Empirically, we find trained transformers consistently achieve near-optimal ICL performance in this setting, and exhibit the desired dissection where lower layers transforms the dataset and upper layers perform linear ICL. Through extensive probing and a new pasting experiment, we further reveal several mechanisms within the trained transformers, such as concrete copying behaviors on both the inputs and the representations, linear ICL capability of the upper layers alone, and a post-ICL representation selection mechanism in a harder mixture setting. These observed mechanisms align well with our theory and may shed light on how transformers perform ICL in more realistic scenarios. | Tianyu Guo, Wei Hu, Song Mei, Huan Wang, Caiming Xiong, Silvio Savarese, Yu Bai |  |

Grounded in neural fields, EmerNeRF simultaneously captures scene geometry, appearance, motion, and semantics via self-bootstrapping. EmerNeRF hinges upon two core components: First, it stratifies scenes into static and dynamic fields. This decomposition emerges purely from self-supervision, enabling our model to learn from general, in-the-wild data sources. Second, EmerNeRF parameterizes an induced flow field from the dynamic field and uses this flow field to further aggregate multi-frame features, amplifying the rendering precision of dynamic objects. Coupling these three fields (static, dynamic, and flow) enables EmerNeRF to represent highly-dynamic scenes self-sufficiently, without relying on ground truth object annotations or pre-trained models for dynamic object segmentation or optical flow estimation. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in sensor simulation, significantly outperforming previous methods when reconstructing static (+2.93 PSNR) and dynamic (+3.70 PSNR) scenes. In addition, to bolster EmerNeRF's semantic generalization, we lift 2D visual foundation model features into 4D space-time and address a general positional bias in modern Transformers, significantly boosting 3D perception performance (e.g., 37.50% relative improvement in occupancy prediction accuracy on average). Finally, we construct a diverse and challenging 120-sequence dataset to benchmark neural fields under extreme and highly-dynamic settings.

This novel feedback structure is much weaker than the semi-bandit feedback previously studied and is only slightly stronger than the full-bandit feedback, and thus it presents a new challenge for the online learning task. We propose an algorithm and derive a regret bound for instances where arm outcomes follow distributions with finite supports. Our algorithm introduces a novel concept of biased arm replacement to address the weak feedback challenge, and it achieves a distribution-dependent regret bound of $O((k/\Delta)\log(T))$ and a distribution-independent regret bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$, where $\Delta$ is the reward gap and $T$ is the time horizon. Notably, our regret bound is comparable to the bounds obtained under the more informative semi-bandit feedback. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm through experimental results. | Yiliu Wang, Wei Chen, Milan Vojnovic |  |

Many interesting research problems arise from this strategy, e.g., how to reduce the domain gap between synthetic source and real-world target. To facilitate developing more new approaches in learning from synthetic data, we introduce the Alice benchmarks, large-scale datasets providing benchmarks as well as evaluation protocols to the research community. Within the Alice benchmarks, two object re-ID tasks are offered: person and vehicle re-ID. We collected and annotated two challenging real-world target datasets: AlicePerson and AliceVehicle, captured under various illuminations, image resolutions, etc. As an important feature of our real target, the clusterability of its training set is not manually guaranteed to make it closer to a real domain adaptation test scenario. Correspondingly, we reuse existing PersonX and VehicleX as synthetic source domains. The primary goal is to train models from synthetic data that can work effectively in the real world. In this paper, we detail the settings of Alice benchmarks, provide an analysis of existing commonly-used domain adaptation methods, and discuss some interesting future directions. An online server has been set up for the community to evaluate methods conveniently and fairly.

Our approach, called Large LAnguage model Reinforcement Learning Policy (LLaRP), adapts a pre-trained frozen LLM to take as input text instructions and visual egocentric observations and output actions directly in the environment. Using reinforcement learning, we train LLaRP to see and act solely through environmental interactions. We show that LLaRP is robust to complex paraphrasings of task instructions and can generalize to new tasks that require novel optimal behavior. In particular, on 1,000 unseen tasks it achieves 42% success rate, 1.7x the success rate of other common learned baselines or zero-shot applications of LLMs. Finally, to aid the community in studying language conditioned, massively multi-task, embodied AI problems we release a novel benchmark, Language Rearrangement, consisting of 150,000 training and 1,000 testing tasks for language-conditioned rearrangement. | Andrew Szot, Max Schwarzer, Harsh Agrawal, Bogdan Mazoure, Rin Metcalf, Walter Talbott, Natalie Mackraz, R.

To this end, we present video language planning (VLP), an algorithm that consists of a tree search procedure, where we train (i) vision-language models to serve as both policies and value functions, and (ii) text-to-video models as dynamics models. VLP takes as input a long-horizon task instruction and current image observation, and outputs a long video plan that provides detailed multimodal (video and language) specifications that describe how to complete the final task. VLP scales with increasing computation budget where more computation time results in improved video plans, and is able to synthesize long-horizon video plans across different robotics domains -- from multi-object rearrangement, to multi-camera bi-arm dexterous manipulation. Generated video plans can be translated into real robot actions via goal-conditioned policies, conditioned on each intermediate frame of the generated video. Experiments show that VLP substantially improves long-horizon task success rates compared to prior methods on both simulated and real robots (across 3 hardware platforms). | Yilun Du, Sherry Yang, Pete Florence, Fei Xia, Ayzaan Wahid, Brian Ichter, Pierre Sermanet, Tianhe Yu, Pieter Abbeel, Joshua B.

However, the current VL pretraining framework is hard to extend to multiple modalities (N modalities, N ≥ 3) beyond vision and language. We thus propose LanguageBind, taking the language as the bind across different modalities because the language modality is well-explored and contains rich semantics. Specifically, we freeze the language encoder acquired by VL pretraining and then train encoders for other modalities with contrastive learning. As a result, all modalities are mapped to a shared feature space, implementing multi-modal semantic alignment. While LanguageBind ensures that we can extend VL modalities to N modalities, we also need a high-quality dataset with alignment data pairs centered on language. We thus propose VIDAL-10M with 10 Million data with Video, Infrared, Depth, Audio and their corresponding Language. In our VIDAL-10M, all videos are from short video platforms with complete semantics rather than truncated segments from long videos, and all the video, depth, infrared, and audio modalities are aligned to their textual descriptions. LanguageBind has achieved superior performance on a wide range of 15 benchmarks covering video, audio, depth, and infrared. Moreover, multiple experiments have provided evidence for the effectiveness of LanguageBind in achieving indirect alignment and complementarity among diverse modalities. | Bin Zhu, Bin Lin, Munan Ning, Yang Yan, Jiaxi Cui, Hongfa Wang, Yatian Pang, Wenhao Jiang, Junwu Zhang, Zongwei Li, Caiwan Zhang, Zhifeng Li, Wei Liu, Li Yuan |  |

However, like other generative models, diffusion models are prone to privacy issues. In this paper, we propose an efficient query-based membership inference attack (MIA), namely Proximal Initialization Attack (PIA), which utilizes groundtruth trajectory obtained by $\epsilon$ initialized in $t=0$ and predicted point to infer memberships. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can achieve competitive performance with only two queries that achieve at least 6$\times$ efficiency than the previous SOTA baseline on both discrete-time and continuous-time diffusion models. Moreover, previous works on the privacy of diffusion models have focused on vision tasks without considering audio tasks. Therefore, we also explore the robustness of diffusion models to MIA in the text-to-speech (TTS) task, which is an audio generation task. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to study the robustness of diffusion models to MIA in the TTS task. Experimental results indicate that models with mel-spectrogram (image-like) output are vulnerable to MIA, while models with audio output are relatively robust to MIA.

However, their proficiency within specialized domains such as biomolecular studies remains limited. To address this challenge, we introduce Mol-Instructions, a comprehensive instruction dataset designed for the biomolecular domain. Mol-Instructions encompasses three key components: molecule-oriented instructions, protein-oriented instructions, and biomolecular text instructions. Each component aims to improve the understanding and prediction capabilities of LLMs concerning biomolecular features and behaviors. Through extensive instruction tuning experiments on LLMs, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Mol-Instructions in enhancing large models' performance in the intricate realm of biomolecular studies, thus fostering progress in the biomolecular research community. Mol-Instructions is publicly available for ongoing research and will undergo regular updates to enhance its applicability (https://github.com/zjunlp/Mol-Instructions). | Yin Fang, Xiaozhuan Liang, Ningyu Zhang, Kangwei Liu, Rui Huang, Zhuo Chen, Xiaohui Fan, Huajun Chen |  |

However, due to the randomness introduced in the reverse process of diffusion models, the performances of diffusion-based SR models are fluctuating at every time of sampling, especially for samplers with few resampled steps. This inherent randomness of diffusion models results in ineffectiveness and instability, making it challenging for users to guarantee the quality of SR results. However, our work takes this randomness as an opportunity: fully analyzing and leveraging it leads to the construction of an effective plug-and-play sampling method that owns the potential to benefit a series of diffusion-based SR methods. More in detail, we propose to steadily sample high-quality SR images from pre-trained diffusion-based SR models by solving diffusion ordinary differential equations (diffusion ODEs) with optimal boundary conditions (BCs) and analyze the characteristics between the choices of BCs and their corresponding SR results. Our analysis shows the route to obtain an approximately optimal BC via an efficient exploration in the whole space. The quality of SR results sampled by the proposed method with fewer steps outperforms the quality of results sampled by current methods with randomness from the same pre-trained diffusion-based SR model, which means that our sampling method ''boosts'' current diffusion-based SR models without any additional training. | Yiyang Ma, Huan Yang, Wenhan Yang, Jianlong Fu, Jiaying Liu |  |

The minority samples are instances that lie on low-density regions of a data manifold. Generating a sufficient number of such minority instances is important, since they often contain some unique attributes of the data. However, the conventional generation process of the diffusion models mostly yields majority samples (that lie on high-density regions of the manifold) due to their high likelihoods, making themselves ineffective and time-consuming for the minority generating task. In this work, we present a novel framework that can make the generation process of the diffusion models focus on the minority samples. We first highlight that Tweedie's denoising formula yields favorable results for majority samples. The observation motivates us to introduce a metric that describes the uniqueness of a given sample. To address the inherent preference of the diffusion models w.r.t. the majority samples, we further develop \*minority guidance\*, a sampling technique that can guide the generation process toward regions with desired likelihood levels. Experiments on benchmark real datasets demonstrate that our minority guidance can greatly improve the capability of generating high-quality minority samples over existing generative samplers. We showcase that the performance benefit of our framework persists even in demanding real-world scenarios such as medical imaging, further underscoring the practical significance of our work.

In an aggregate learning framework, the dataset is grouped into bags of samples, where each bag is available only with an aggregate response, providing a summary of individuals' responses in that bag. In this paper, we study two natural loss functions for learning from aggregate responses: the bag-level loss and the instance-level loss. In the former, the model is learned by minimizing a loss between the aggregate responses and aggregate model predictions, while in the latter, the model aims to fit individual predictions to the aggregate responses. In this work, we show that the instance-level loss can be perceived as a regularized form of the bag-level loss. This observation allows us to compare the two approaches with respect to the bias and variance of the resulting estimators and to introduce a novel interpolating estimator that combines the two approaches. For linear regression tasks, we provide a precise characterization of the risk of the interpolating estimator in an asymptotic regime where the size of the training set grows in proportion to the feature dimension. Our analysis enables us to theoretically understand the effect of different factors, such as bag size, on the model's prediction risk. Additionally, we propose a mechanism for differentially private learning from aggregate responses and derive the optimal bag size in terms of the prediction risk-privacy trade-off. We also carry out thorough experiments to corroborate our theory and show the efficacy of the interpolating estimator. | Adel Javanmard, Lin Chen, Vahab Mirrokni, Ashwinkumar Badanidiyuru, Gang Fu |  |

Typically, these environments remain unchanged unless agents interact with them. However, in real-world scenarios, agents might also face dynamically changing environments characterized by unexpected events and need to rapidly take action accordingly. To remedy this gap, we propose a new simulated embodied benchmark, called HAZARD, specifically designed to assess the decision-making abilities of embodied agents in dynamic situations. HAZARD consists of three unexpected disaster scenarios, including fire, flood, and wind, and specifically supports the utilization of large language models (LLMs) to assist common sense reasoning and decision-making. This benchmark enables us to evaluate autonomous agents' decision-making capabilities across various pipelines, including reinforcement learning (RL), rule-based, and search-based methods in dynamically changing environments. As a first step toward addressing this challenge using large language models, we further develop an LLM-based agent and perform an in-depth analysis of its promise and challenge of solving these challenging tasks. HAZARD is available at https://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/hazard/. | Qinhong Zhou, Sunli Chen, Yisong Wang, Haozhe Xu, Weihua Du, Hongxin Zhang, Yilun Du, Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Chuang Gan |  |

We theoretically establish a lower bound, proving that under mild conditions, representation distortion inevitably occurs over time. To estimate the temporal distortion without human annotation after deployment, one naive approach is to pre-train a recurrent model (e.g., RNN) before deployment and use this model afterwards, but the estimation is far from satisfactory. In this paper, we analyze the representation distortion from an information theory perspective, and attribute it primarily to inaccurate feature extraction during evolution. Consequently, we introduce Smart, a straightforward and effective baseline enhanced by an adaptive feature extractor through self-supervised graph reconstruction. In synthetic random graphs, we further refine the former lower bound to show the inevitable distortion over time and empirically observe that Smart achieves good estimation performance. Moreover, we observe that Smart consistently shows outstanding generalization estimation on four real-world evolving graphs. The ablation studies underscore the necessity of graph reconstruction. For example, on OGB-arXiv dataset, the estimation metric MAPE deteriorates from 2.19% to 8.00% without reconstruction. | Bin Lu, Tingyan Ma, Xiaoying Gan, Xinbing Wang, Yunqiang Zhu, Chenghu Zhou, Shiyu Liang |  |

However, when and how transformers can be trained to perform ICRL have not been theoretically well-understood. In particular, it is unclear which reinforcement-learning algorithms transformers can perform in context, and how distribution mismatch in offline training data affects the learned algorithms. This paper provides a theoretical framework that analyzes supervised pretraining for ICRL. This includes two recently proposed training methods --- algorithm distillation and decision-pretrained transformers. First, assuming model realizability, we prove the supervised-pretrained transformer will imitate the conditional expectation of the expert algorithm given the observed trajectory. The generalization error will scale with model capacity and a distribution divergence factor between the expert and offline algorithms. Second, we show transformers with ReLU attention can efficiently approximate near-optimal online reinforcement learning algorithms like LinUCB and Thompson sampling for stochastic linear bandits, and UCB-VI for tabular Markov decision processes. This provides the first quantitative analysis of the ICRL capabilities of transformers pretrained from offline trajectories. | Licong Lin, Yu Bai, Song Mei |  |
| 1491 |  |  [On the Hardness of Online Nonconvex Optimization with Single Oracle Feedback](https://openreview.net/forum?id=iZgECfyHXF) |  | 0 | Online nonconvex optimization has been an active area of research recently. Previous studies either considered the global regret with full information about the objective functions, or studied the local regret with window-smoothed objective functions, which required access to unlimited number of gradient oracles per time step. In this paper, we focus on the more challenging and practical setting, where access to only a single oracle is allowed per time step, and take the local regret of the original (i.e., unsmoothed) objective functions as the performance metric. Specifically, for both settings respectively with a single exact and stochastic gradient oracle feedback, we derive lower bounds on the local regret and show that the classical online (stochastic) gradient descent algorithms are optimal. Moreover, for the more challenging setting with a single function value oracle feedback, we develop an online algorithm based on a one-point running difference gradient estimator, and show that such an algorithm achieves a local regret that a generic stochastic gradient oracle can best achieve. | Ziwei Guan, Yi Zhou, Yingbin Liang |  |

In this paper, we disclose that adversarially trained models are vulnerable to two-faced attacks, where slight perturbations in input features are crafted to make the model exhibit a false sense of robustness in the verification phase. Such a threat is significantly important as it can mislead our evaluation of the adversarial robustness of models, which could cause unpredictable security issues when deploying substandard models in reality. More seriously, this threat seems to be pervasive and tricky: we find that many types of models suffer from this threat, and models with higher adversarial robustness tend to be more vulnerable. Furthermore, we provide the first attempt to formulate this threat, disclose its relationships with adversarial risk, and try to circumvent it via a simple countermeasure. These findings serve as a crucial reminder for practitioners to exercise caution in the verification phase, urging them to refrain from blindly trusting the exhibited adversarial robustness of models. | Shengjie Zhou, Lue Tao, Yuzhou Cao, Tao Xiang, Bo An, Lei Feng |  |

MOFI differs from previous work in two key aspects: 1. pre-training data, and 2. training recipe. Regarding data, we introduce a new approach to automatically assign entity labels to images from noisy image-text pairs. Our approach involves employing a named entity recognition model to extract entities from the alt-text, and then using a CLIP model to select the correct entities as labels of the paired image. It's a simple, cost-effective method that can scale to handle billions of web-mined image-text pairs. Through this method, we have created Image-to-Entities (I2E), a new dataset with 1 billion images and 2 million distinct entities, covering rich visual concepts in the wild. Building upon the I2E dataset, we study different training recipes like supervised pre-training, contrastive pre-training, and multi-task learning. For constrastive pre-training, we treat entity names as free-form text, and further enrich them with entity descriptions. Experiments show that supervised pre-training with large-scale fine-grained entity labels is highly effective for image retrieval tasks, and multi-task training further improves the performance. The final MOFI model achieves 86.66\% mAP on the challenging GPR1200 dataset, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art performance of 72.19% from OpenAI's CLIP model. Further experiments on zero-shot and linear probe image classification also show that MOFI outperforms a CLIP model trained on the original image-text data, demonstrating the effectiveness of the I2E dataset in learning strong image representations.

| 1494 |  |  [Efficient Integrators for Diffusion Generative Models](https://openreview.net/forum?id=qA4foxO5Gf) |  | 0 | Diffusion models suffer from slow sample generation at inference time. Therefore, developing a principled framework for fast deterministic/stochastic sampling for a broader class of diffusion models is a promising direction. We propose two complementary frameworks for accelerating sample generation in pre-trained models: Conjugate Integrators and Splitting Integrators. Conjugate integrators generalize DDIM, mapping the reverse diffusion dynamics to a more amenable space for sampling. In contrast, splitting-based integrators, commonly used in molecular dynamics, reduce the numerical simulation error by cleverly alternating between numerical updates involving the data and auxiliary variables. After extensively studying these methods empirically and theoretically, we present a hybrid method that leads to the best-reported performance for diffusion models in augmented spaces. Applied to Phase Space Langevin Diffusion [Pandey \& Mandt, 2023] on CIFAR-10, our deterministic and stochastic samplers achieve FID scores of 2.11 and 2.36 in only 100 network function evaluations (NFE) as compared to 2.57 and 2.63 for the best-performing baselines, respectively. Our code and model checkpoints will be made publicly available at https://github.com/mandt-lab/PSLD | Kushagra Pandey, Maja Rudolph, Stephan Mandt |  |

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are effective at learning molecular representations from a 2D molecular graph or a single 3D structure, existing works often overlook the flexible nature of molecules, which continuously interconvert across conformations via chemical bond rotations and minor vibrational perturbations. To better account for molecular flexibility, some recent works formulate MRL as an ensemble learning problem, focusing on explicitly learning from a set of conformer structures. However, most of these studies have limited datasets, tasks, and models. In this work, we introduce the first MoleculAR Conformer Ensemble Learning (MARCEL) benchmark to thoroughly evaluate the potential of learning on con- former ensembles and suggest promising research directions. MARCEL includes four datasets covering diverse molecule- and reaction-level properties of chemically diverse molecules including organocatalysts and transition-metal catalysts, extending beyond the scope of common GNN benchmarks that are confined to drug-like molecules. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study, which benchmarks representative 1D, 2D, and 3D MRL models, along with two strategies that explicitly incorporate conformer ensembles into 3D models. Our findings reveal that direct learning from an accessible conformer space can improve performance on a variety of tasks and models. | Yanqiao Zhu, Jeehyun Hwang, Keir Adams, Zhen Liu, Bozhao Nan, Brock Stenfors, Yuanqi Du, Jatin Chauhan, Olaf Wiest, Olexandr Isayev, Connor W.

Recently, it has been shown that adversarial examples are able to manipulate conformal methods to construct prediction sets with invalid coverage rates, as the i.i.d. assumption is violated. To address this issue, a recent work, Randomized Smoothed Conformal Prediction (RSCP), was first proposed to certify the robustness of conformal prediction methods to adversarial noise. However, RSCP has two major limitations: (i) its robustness guarantee is flawed when used in practice and (ii) it tends to produce large uncertainty sets. To address these limitations, we first propose a novel framework called RSCP+ to provide provable robustness guarantee in evaluation, which fixes the issues in the original RSCP method. Next, we propose two novel methods, Post-Training Transformation (PTT) and Robust Conformal Training (RCT), to effectively reduce prediction set size with little computation overhead. Experimental results in CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet suggest the baseline method only yields trivial predictions including full label set, while our methods could boost the efficiency by up to $4.36\times$, $5.46\times$, and $16.9\times$ respectively and provide practical robustness guarantee. | Ge Yan, Yaniv Romano, TsuiWei Weng |  |
| 1497 |  |  [DNA-GPT: Divergent N-Gram Analysis for Training-Free Detection of GPT-Generated Text](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Xlayxj2fWp) |  | 0 | Large language models (LLMs) have notably enhanced the fluency and diversity of machine-generated text. However, this progress also presents a significant challenge in detecting the origin of a given text, and current research on detection methods lags behind the rapid evolution of LLMs. Conventional training-based methods have limitations in flexibility, particularly when adapting to new domains, and they often lack explanatory power. To address this gap, we propose a novel training-free detection strategy called Divergent N-Gram Analysis (DNA-GPT). Given a text, we first truncate it in the middle and then use only the preceding portion as input to the LLMs to regenerate the new remaining parts. By analyzing the differences between the original and new remaining parts through N-gram analysis in black-box or probability divergence in white-box, we can clearly illustrate significant discrepancies between machine-generated and human-written text. We conducted extensive experiments on the most advanced LLMs from OpenAI, including text-davinci-003, GPT-3.5-turbo, and GPT-4, as well as open-source models such as GPT-NeoX-20B and LLaMa-13B. Results show that our zero-shot approach exhibits state-of-the-art performance in distinguishing between human and GPT-generated text on four English and one German dataset, outperforming OpenAI's own classifier, which is trained on millions of text. Additionally, our methods provide reasonable explanations and evidence to support our claim, which is a unique feature of explainable detection. Our method is also robust under the revised text attack and can additionally solve model sourcing. | Xianjun Yang, Wei Cheng, Yue Wu, Linda Ruth Petzold, William Yang Wang, Haifeng Chen |  |

To address this issue, advanced research primarily focuses on manipulating the existing gradients to achieve more consistent client models. In this paper, we present an alternative perspective on client drift and aim to mitigate it by generating improved local models. First, we analyze the generalization contribution of local training and conclude that this generalization contribution is bounded by the conditional Wasserstein distance between the data distribution of different clients. Then, we propose FedImpro, to construct similar conditional distributions for local training. Specifically, FedImpro decouples the model into high-level and low-level components, and trains the high-level portion on reconstructed feature distributions. This approach enhances the generalization contribution and reduces the dissimilarity of gradients in FL. Experimental results show that FedImpro can help FL defend against data heterogeneity and enhance the generalization performance of the model. | Zhenheng Tang, Yonggang Zhang, Shaohuai Shi, Xinmei Tian, Tongliang Liu, Bo Han, Xiaowen Chu |  |

Although successful, previous works do not account for the specific localization of said attributes extended into the three dimensional plane. In this context, we present a conditional diffusion model that integrates control over three-dimensional object placement with disentangled representations of global stylistic semantics from multiple exemplar images. Specifically, we first introduce depth disentanglement training to leverage the relative depth of objects as an estimator, allowing the model to identify the absolute positions of unseen objects through the use of synthetic image triplets. We also introduce soft guidance, a method for imposing global semantics onto targeted regions without the use of any additional localization cues. Our integrated framework, Compose and Conquer (CnC), unifies these techniques to localize multiple conditions in a disentangled manner. We demonstrate that our approach allows perception of objects at varying depths while offering a versatile framework for composing localized objects with different global semantics. | Jonghyun Lee, Hansam Cho, Young Joon Yoo, Seoung Bum Kim, Yonghyun Jeong |  |

Distributionally robust BO (DRBO) is a subset of BOCU that affords robustness against context distribution shift, and includes the optimization of expected values and worst-case values as special cases. By considering the first derivatives of the DRBO objective, we generalize DRBO to one that includes several other uncertainty objectives studied in the BOCU literature such as worst-case sensitivity (and thus notions of risk such as variance, range, and conditional value-at-risk) and mean-risk tradeoffs. We develop a general Thompson sampling algorithm that is able to optimize any objective within the BOCU framework, analyze its theoretical properties, and compare it to suitable baselines across different experimental settings and uncertainty objectives. | Sebastian Shenghong Tay, ChuanSheng Foo, Daisuke Urano, Richalynn Leong, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low |  |

In the presence of function approximation, however, these techniques often diverge due to the absence of Bellman completeness in the function classes considered, a crucial condition for the success of DP-based methods. In this paper, we show how off-policy learning techniques based on return-conditioned supervised learning (RCSL) are able to circumvent these challenges of Bellman completeness, converging under significantly more relaxed assumptions inherited from supervised learning. We prove there exists a natural environment in which if one uses two-layer multilayer perceptron as the function approximator, the layer width needs to grow \*linearly\* with the state space size to satisfy Bellman completeness while a constant layer width is enough for RCSL. These findings take a step towards explaining the superior empirical performance of RCSL methods compared to DP-based methods in environments with near-optimal datasets. Furthermore, in order to learn from sub-optimal datasets, we propose a simple framework called MBRCSL, granting RCSL methods the ability of dynamic programming to stitch together segments from distinct trajectories. MBRCSL leverages learned dynamics models and forward sampling to accomplish trajectory stitching while avoiding the need for Bellman completeness that plagues all dynamic programming algorithms. We propose both theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation to back these claims, outperforming state-of-the-art model-free and model-based offline RL algorithms across several simulated robotics problems. | Zhaoyi Zhou, Chuning Zhu, Runlong Zhou, Qiwen Cui, Abhishek Gupta, Simon Shaolei Du |  |

Most diffusion models, however, are limited to a single-generation modeling. Can we generalize diffusion models with the ability of multi-modal generative training for more generalizable modeling? In this paper, we propose a principled way to define a diffusion model by constructing a unified multi-modal diffusion model in a common {\em diffusion space}. We define the forward diffusion process to be driven by an information aggregation from multiple types of task-data, {\it e.g.}, images for a generation task and labels for a classification task. In the reverse process, we enforce information sharing by parameterizing a shared backbone denoising network with additional modality-specific decoder heads. Such a structure can simultaneously learn to generate different types of multi-modal data with a multi-task loss, which is derived from a new multi-modal variational lower bound that generalizes the standard diffusion model. We propose several multi-modal generation settings to verify our framework, including image transition, masked-image training, joint image-label and joint image-representation generative modeling. Extensive experimental results on ImageNet indicate the effectiveness of our framework for various multi-modal generative modeling, which we believe is an important research direction worthy of more future explorations. | Changyou Chen, Han Ding, Bunyamin Sisman, Yi Xu, Ouye Xie, Benjamin Z.

However, current agents are primarily created and tested in simplified synthetic environments, leading to a disconnect with real-world scenarios. In this paper, we build an environment for language-guided agents that is highly realistic and reproducible. Specifically, we focus on agents that perform tasks on the web, and create an environment with fully functional websites from four common domains: e-commerce, social forum discussions, collaborative software development, and content management. Our environment is enriched with tools (e.g., a map) and external knowledge bases (e.g., user manuals) to encourage human-like task-solving. Building upon our environment, we release a set of benchmark tasks focusing on evaluating the functional correctness of task completions. The tasks in our benchmark are diverse, long-horizon, and designed to emulate tasks that humans routinely perform on the internet. We experiment with several baseline agents, integrating recent techniques such as reasoning before acting. The results demonstrate that solving complex tasks is challenging: our best GPT-4-based agent only achieves an end-to-end task success rate of 14.41%, significantly lower than the human performance of 78.24%. These results highlight the need for further development of robust agents, that current state-of-the-art large language models are far from perfect performance in these real-life tasks, and that \ours can be used to measure such progress.\footnote{Code, data, environment reproduction instructions, video demonstrations are available in the supplementary.} | Shuyan Zhou, Frank F.

To automate this process, in this paper, we propose a novel framework for discrete prompt optimization, called EvoPrompt, which borrows the idea of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) as they exhibit good performance and fast convergence. To enable EAs to work on discrete prompts, which are natural language expressions that need to be coherent and human-readable, we connect LLMs with EAs. This approach allows us to simultaneously leverage the powerful language processing capabilities of LLMs and the efficient optimization performance of EAs. Specifically, abstaining from any gradients or parameters, EvoPrompt starts from a population of prompts and iteratively generates new prompts with LLMs based on the evolutionary operators, improving the population based on the development set. We optimize prompts for both closed- and open-source LLMs including GPT-3.5 and Alpaca, on 31 datasets covering language understanding, generation tasks, as well as BIG-Bench Hard (BBH) tasks. EvoPrompt significantly outperforms human-engineered prompts and existing methods for automatic prompt generation (e.g., up to 25% on BBH). Furthermore, EvoPrompt demonstrates that connecting LLMs with EAs creates synergies, which could inspire further research on the combination of LLMs and conventional algorithms. | Qingyan Guo, Rui Wang, Junliang Guo, Bei Li, Kaitao Song, Xu Tan, Guoqing Liu, Jiang Bian, Yujiu Yang |  |

When it comes to global pruning techniques, Iterative Magnitude Pruning (IMP) still stands as a state-of-the-art algorithm despite its simple nature, particularly in extremely sparse regimes. In light of the recent finding that the two successive matching IMP solutions are linearly connected without a loss barrier, we propose Sparse Weight Averaging with Multiple Particles (SWAMP), a straightforward modification of IMP that achieves performance comparable to an ensemble of two IMP solutions. For every iteration, we concurrently train multiple sparse models, referred to as particles, using different batch orders yet the same matching ticket, and then weight average such models to produce a single mask. We demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines across different sparsities through extensive experiments on various neural network structures and data. | Moonseok Choi, Hyungi Lee, Giung Nam, Juho Lee |  |

Existing approaches represent instances in a shared canonical space. However, for in-the-wild datasets a shared canonical system can be difficult to define or might not even exist. In this work, we instead model instances in view space, alleviating the need for posed images and learned camera distributions. We find that in this setting, existing GAN-based methods are prone to generating flat geometry and struggle with distribution coverage. We hence propose WildFusion, a new approach to 3D-aware image synthesis based on latent diffusion models (LDMs). We first train an autoencoder that infers a compressed latent representation, which additionally captures the images’ underlying 3D structure and enables not only reconstruction but also novel view synthesis. To learn a faithful 3D representation, we leverage cues from monocular depth prediction. Then, we train a diffusion model in the 3D-aware latent space, thereby enabling synthesis of high-quality 3D-consistent image samples, outperforming recent state-of-the-art GAN-based methods. Importantly, our 3D-aware LDM is trained without any direct supervision from multiview images or 3D geometry and does not require posed images or learned pose or camera distributions. It directly learns a 3D representation without relying on canonical camera coordinates. This opens up promising research avenues for scalable 3D-aware image synthesis and 3D content creation from in-the-wild image data. | Katja Schwarz, Seung Wook Kim, Jun Gao, Sanja Fidler, Andreas Geiger, Karsten Kreis |  |

The problem becomes more difficult with the presence of unobserved confounding variables. The front-door adjustment is an approach for dealing with unobserved confounding variables. However, the restriction for the standard front-door adjustment is difficult to satisfy in practice. In this paper, we relax some of the restrictions by proposing the concept of conditional front-door (CFD) adjustment and develop the theorem that guarantees the causal effect identifiability of CFD adjustment. By leveraging the ability of deep generative models, we propose CFDiVAE to learn the representation of the CFD adjustment variable directly from data with the identifiable Variational AutoEncoder and formally prove the model identifiability. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of CFDiVAE and its superiority over existing methods. The experiments also show that the performance of CFDiVAE is less sensitive to the causal strength of unobserved confounding variables. We further apply CFDiVAE to a real-world dataset to demonstrate its potential application. | Ziqi Xu, Debo Cheng, Jiuyong Li, Jixue Liu, Lin Liu, Kui Yu |  |

To accelerate the sampling process, prior studies have reformulated diffusion sampling as an ODE/SDE and introduced higher-order numerical methods. However, these methods often produce divergence artifacts, especially with a low number of sampling steps, which limits the achievable acceleration. In this paper, we investigate the potential causes of these artifacts and suggest that the small stability regions of these methods could be the principal cause. To address this issue, we propose two novel techniques. The first technique involves the incorporation of Heavy Ball (HB) momentum, a well-known technique for improving optimization, into existing diffusion numerical methods to expand their stability regions. We also prove that the resulting methods have first-order convergence. The second technique, called Generalized Heavy Ball (GHVB), constructs a new high-order method that offers a variable trade-off between accuracy and artifact suppression. Experimental results show that our techniques are highly effective in reducing artifacts and improving image quality, surpassing state-of-the-art diffusion solvers on both pixel-based and latent-based diffusion models for low-step sampling. Our research provides novel insights into the design of numerical methods for future diffusion work. | Suttisak Wizadwongsa, Worameth Chinchuthakun, Pramook Khungurn, Amit Raj, Supasorn Suwajanakorn |  |

Currently, most TTA methods can only deal with minor shifts and rely heavily on heuristic and empirical studies. To advance TTA under domain shifts, we propose the novel problem setting of active test-time adaptation (ATTA) that integrates active learning within the fully TTA setting. We provide a learning theory analysis, demonstrating that incorporating limited labeled test instances enhances overall performances across test domains with a theoretical guarantee. We also present a sample entropy balancing for implementing ATTA while avoiding catastrophic forgetting (CF). We introduce a simple yet effective ATTA algorithm, known as SimATTA, using real-time sample selection techniques. Extensive experimental results confirm consistency with our theoretical analyses and show that the proposed ATTA method yields substantial performance improvements over TTA methods while maintaining efficiency and shares similar effectiveness to the more demanding active domain adaptation (ADA) methods.

To address these issues, we propose AlignDiff, a novel framework that leverages RLHF to quantify human preferences, covering abstractness, and utilizes them to guide diffusion planning for zero-shot behavior customizing, covering mutability. AlignDiff can accurately match user-customized behaviors and efficiently switch from one to another. To build the framework, we first establish the multi-perspective human feedback datasets, which contain comparisons for the attributes of diverse behaviors, and then train an attribute strength model to predict quantified relative strengths. After relabeling behavioral datasets with relative strengths, we proceed to train an attribute-conditioned diffusion model, which serves as a planner with the attribute strength model as a director for preference aligning at the inference phase. We evaluate AlignDiff on various locomotion tasks and demonstrate its superior performance on preference matching, switching, and covering compared to other baselines. Its capability of completing unseen downstream tasks under human instructions also showcases the promising potential for human-AI collaboration.

Within this framework, the doubly robust (DR) estimator was derived and has shown its effectiveness in estimation, especially when the model assumption is violated. However, the current form of the DR estimator is restricted to binary treatments, while the treatments can be continuous in many real-world applications. The primary obstacle to continuous treatments resides in the delta function present in the original DR estimator, making it infeasible in causal effect estimation and introducing a heavy computational burden in nuisance function estimation. To address these challenges, we propose a kernel-based DR estimator that can well handle continuous treatments for proximal causal learning. Equipped with its smoothness, we show that its oracle form is a consistent approximation of the influence function. Further, we propose a new approach to efficiently solve the nuisance functions. We then provide a comprehensive convergence analysis in terms of the mean square error. We demonstrate the utility of our estimator on synthetic datasets and real-world applications. | Yong Wu, Yanwei Fu, Shouyan Wang, Xinwei Sun |  |

Inferred neural interactions from neural signals primarily reflect functional connectivity. In a long experiment, subject animals may experience different stages defined by the experiment, stimuli, or behavioral states, and hence functional connectivity can change over time. To model dynamically changing functional connectivity, prior work employs state-switching generalized linear models with hidden Markov models (i.e., HMM-GLMs). However, we argue they lack biological plausibility, as functional connectivities are shaped and confined by the underlying anatomical connectome. Here, we propose two novel prior-informed state-switching GLMs, called Gaussian HMM-GLM (Gaussian prior) and one-hot HMM-GLM (Gumbel-Softmax one-hot prior). We show that the learned prior should capture the state-invariant interaction, shedding light on the underlying anatomical connectome and revealing more likely physical neuron interactions. The state-dependent interaction modeled by each GLM offers traceability to capture functional variations across multiple brain states. Our methods effectively recover true interaction structures in simulated data, achieve the highest predictive likelihood, and enhance the interpretability of interaction patterns and hidden states when applied to real neural data.

However, the challenge of designing effective quantum feature maps for real-world datasets, particularly in the absence of sufficient prior information, remains a significant obstacle. In this study, we present a data-driven approach that automates the design of problem-specific quantum feature maps. Our approach leverages feature-selection techniques to handle high-dimensional data on near-term quantum machines with limited qubits, and incorporates a deep neural predictor to efficiently evaluate the performance of various candidate quantum kernels. Through extensive numerical simulations on different datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposal over prior methods, especially for the capability of eliminating the kernel concentration issue and identifying the feature map with prediction advantages. Our work not only unlocks the potential of quantum kernels for enhancing real-world tasks, but also highlights the substantial role of deep learning in advancing quantum machine learning. | Cong Lei, Yuxuan Du, Peng Mi, Jun Yu, Tongliang Liu |  |

In this study, towards training on further larger scales, we identify a specific parameterization for second-order optimization that promotes feature learning in a stable manner even if the network width increases significantly. Inspired by a maximal update parametrization, we consider a one-step update of the gradient and reveal the appropriate scales of hyperparameters including random initialization, learning rates, and damping terms. Our approach covers two major second-order optimization algorithms, K-FAC and Shampoo, and we demonstrate that our parametrization achieves higher generalization performance in feature learning. In particular, it enables us to transfer the hyperparameters across models with different widths. | Satoki Ishikawa, Ryo Karakida |  |

Instead, it defines a corresponding SDE or ODE for editing. In the formulation, we prove that the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the marginal distributions of the two SDEs gradually decreases while that for the ODEs remains as the time approaches zero, which shows the promise of SDE in image editing. Inspired by it, we provide the SDE counterparts for widely used ODE baselines in various tasks including inpainting and image-to-image translation, where SDE shows a consistent and substantial improvement. Moreover, we propose \emph{SDE-Drag} -- a simple yet effective method built upon the SDE formulation for point-based content dragging. We build a challenging benchmark (termed \emph{DragBench}) with open-set natural, art, and AI-generated images for evaluation. A user study on DragBench indicates that SDE-Drag significantly outperforms our ODE baseline, existing diffusion-based methods, and the renowned DragGAN. Our results demonstrate the superiority and versatility of SDE in image editing and push the boundary of diffusion-based editing methods.

However, solving more complex and competitive programming tasks is still quite challenging for these models - possibly due to their tendency to generate solutions as monolithic code blocks instead of decomposing them into logical sub-tasks and sub-modules. On the other hand, experienced programmers instinctively write modularized code with abstraction for solving complex tasks, often reusing previously developed modules. To address this gap, we propose CodeChain, a novel framework for inference that elicits modularized code generation through a chain of self-revisions, each being guided by some representative sub-modules generated in previous iterations. Concretely, CodeChain first instructs the LLM to generate modularized codes through chain-of-thought prompting. Then it applies a chain of self-revisions by iterating the two steps: 1) extracting and clustering the generated sub-modules and selecting the cluster representatives as the more generic and re-usable implementations, and 2) augmenting the original chain-of-thought prompt with these selected module-implementations and instructing the LLM to re-generate new modularized solutions. We find that by naturally encouraging the LLM to reuse the previously developed and verified sub-modules, CodeChain can significantly boost both modularity as well as correctness of the generated solutions, achieving relative pass@1 improvements of 35\% on APPS and 76\% on CodeContests. It is shown to be effective on both OpenAI LLMs as well as open-sourced LLMs like WizardCoder. We also conduct comprehensive ablation studies with different methods of prompting, number of clusters, model sizes, program qualities, etc., to provide useful insights that underpin CodeChain's success. | Hung Le, Hailin Chen, Amrita Saha, Akash Gokul, Doyen Sahoo, Shafiq Joty |  |
| 1517 |  |  [Towards Robust Multi-Modal Reasoning via Model Selection](https://openreview.net/forum?id=KTf4DGAzus) |  | 0 | The reasoning capabilities of LLM (Large Language Model) are widely acknowledged in recent research, inspiring studies on tool learning and autonomous agents. LLM serves as the \`\`brain'' of the agent, orchestrating multiple tools for collaborative multi-step task solving. Unlike methods invoking tools like calculators or weather APIs for straightforward tasks, multi-modal agents excel by integrating diverse AI models for complex challenges. However, current multi-modal agents neglect the significance of model selection: they primarily focus on the planning and execution phases, and will only invoke predefined task-specific models for each subtask, making the execution fragile. Meanwhile, other traditional model selection methods are either incompatible with or suboptimal for the multi-modal agent scenarios, due to ignorance of dependencies among subtasks arising by multi-step reasoning. To this end, we identify the key challenges therein and propose the $\textbf{\textit{M}}^\textbf{\textit{3}}$ framework as a plug-in with negligible runtime overhead at test-time. This framework improves model selection and bolsters the robustness of multi-modal agents in multi-step reasoning. In the absence of suitable benchmarks, we create MS-GQA, a new dataset specifically designed to investigate the model selection challenge in multi-modal agents. Our experiments reveal that our framework enables dynamic model selection, considering both user inputs and subtask dependencies, thereby robustifying the overall reasoning process.

However, identifying a compact draft model that is well-aligned with the target model is challenging. To tackle this issue, we propose {\em DistillSpec} that uses knowledge distillation to better align the draft model with the target model, before applying SD. DistillSpec makes two key design choices, which we demonstrate via systematic study to be crucial to improve the draft and target alignment: utilizing \emph{on-policy} data generation from the draft model, and \emph{tailoring the divergence function} to the task and decoding strategy. Notably, DistillSpec yields impressive $10 - 45\%$ speedups over standard SD on a range of standard benchmarks, using both greedy and non-greedy sampling. Furthermore, we combine DistillSpec with lossy SD to achieve fine-grained control over the latency vs. task performance trade-off. Finally, in practical scenarios with models of varying sizes, first using distillation to boost the performance of the target model and then applying DistillSpec to train a well-aligned draft model can reduce decoding latency by $6 - 10\times$ with minimal performance drop, compared to standard decoding without distillation. | Yongchao Zhou, Kaifeng Lyu, Ankit Singh Rawat, Aditya Krishna Menon, Afshin Rostamizadeh, Sanjiv Kumar, JeanFrançois Kagy, Rishabh Agarwal |  |

However, this dependence makes defenses vulnerable to adaptive (white-box) attacks from adversaries with the same knowledge. Adversarial training seems to be a feasible way to enhance robustness without reliance on artificially designed properties. However, in this paper, we show that it can lead to models learning incorrect information. To solve this issue, we re-examine graph attacks from the out-of-distribution (OOD) perspective for poisoning and evasion attacks and introduce a novel adversarial training paradigm incorporating OOD detection. This approach strengthens the robustness of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) without reliance on prior knowledge. To further evaluate adaptive robustness, we develop adaptive attacks against our methods, revealing a trade-off between graph attack efficacy and defensibility. Through extensive experiments over 25,000 perturbed graphs, our method could still maintain good robustness against both adaptive and non-adaptive attacks.

A promising avenue for guiding LLMs in intricate reasoning tasks involves the utilization of intermediate reasoning steps within the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm. Nevertheless, the central challenge lies in the effective selection of exemplars for facilitating in-context learning. In this study, we introduce a framework that leverages Dual Queries and Low-rank approximation Re-ranking (DQ-LoRe) to automatically select exemplars for in-context learning. Dual Queries first query LLM to obtain LLM-generated knowledge such as CoT, then query the retriever to obtain the final exemplars via both question and the knowledge. Moreover, for the second query, LoRe employs dimensionality reduction techniques to refine exemplar selection, ensuring close alignment with the input question's knowledge. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DQ-LoRe significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in the automatic selection of exemplars for GPT-4, enhancing performance from 92.5\% to 94.2\%. Our comprehensive analysis further reveals that DQ-LoRe consistently outperforms retrieval-based approaches in terms of both performance and adaptability, especially in scenarios characterized by distribution shifts. DQ-LoRe pushes the boundaries of in-context learning and opens up new avenues for addressing complex reasoning challenges. | Jing Xiong, Zixuan Li, Chuanyang Zheng, Zhijiang Guo, Yichun Yin, Enze Xie, Zhicheng Yang, Qingxing Cao, Haiming Wang, Xiongwei Han, Jing Tang, Chengming Li, Xiaodan Liang |  |

Despite significant progress made in this field, state-of-the-art (SOTA) trackers often fail when faced with adversarial perturbations in the incoming frames. This can lead to significant robustness and security issues when these trackers are deployed in the real world. To achieve high accuracy on both clean and adversarial data, we propose building a spatial-temporal continuous representation using the semantic text guidance of the object of interest. This novel continuous representation enables us to reconstruct incoming frames to maintain semantic and appearance consistency with the object of interest and its clean counterparts. As a result, our proposed method successfully defends against different SOTA adversarial tracking attacks while maintaining high accuracy on clean data. In particular, our method significantly increases tracking accuracy under adversarial attacks with around 90% relative improvement on UAV123, which is even higher than the accuracy on clean data. | Jianlang Chen, Xuhong Ren, Qing Guo, Felix JuefeiXu, Di Lin, Wei Feng, Lei Ma, Jianjun Zhao |  |

A key theme in existing GCD approaches is adapting large-scale pre-trained models for the GCD task. An alternate perspective, however, is to adapt the data representation itself for better alignment with the pre-trained model. As such, in this paper, we introduce a two-stage adaptation approach termed SPTNet, which iteratively optimizes model parameters (i.e., model-finetuning) and data parameters (i.e., prompt learning). Furthermore, we propose a novel spatial prompt tuning method (SPT) which considers the spatial property of image data, enabling the method to better focus on object parts, which can transfer between seen and unseen classes. We thoroughly evaluate our SPTNet on standard benchmarks and demonstrate that our method outperforms existing GCD methods. Notably, we find our method achieves an average accuracy of 61.4% on the SSB, surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods by approximately 10%. The improvement is particularly remarkable as our method yields extra parameters amounting to only 0.117% of those in the backbone architecture.

In this work, we study structured pruning as an effective means to develop smaller LLMs from pre-trained, larger models. Our approach employs two key techniques: (1) targeted structured pruning, which prunes a larger model to a specified target shape by removing layers, heads, and intermediate and hidden dimensions in an end-to-end manner, and (2) dynamic batch loading, which dynamically updates the composition of sampled data in each training batch based on varying losses across different domains. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by presenting the Sheared-LLaMA series, pruning the LLaMA2-7B model down to 1.3B and 2.7B parameters. Sheared-LLaMA models outperform state-of-the-art open-source models of equivalent sizes, such as Pythia, INCITE, OpenLLaMA and the concurrent TinyLlama models, on a wide range of downstream and instruction tuning evaluations, while requiring only 3% of compute compared to training such models from scratch. This work provides compelling evidence that leveraging existing LLMs with structured pruning is a far more cost-effective approach for building competitive small-scale LLMs | Mengzhou Xia, Tianyu Gao, Zhiyuan Zeng, Danqi Chen |  |

Particularly, answering complex queries based on first-order logic is one of the crucial tasks to verify learning to reason abilities for generalization and composition. Recently, the prevailing method is query embedding which learns the embedding of a set of entities and treats logic operations as set operations and has shown great empirical success. Though there has been much research following the same formulation, many of its claims lack a formal and systematic inspection. In this paper, we rethink this formulation and justify many of the previous claims by characterizing the scope of queries investigated previously and precisely identifying the gap between its formulation and its goal, as well as providing complexity analysis for the currently investigated queries. Moreover, we develop a new dataset containing ten new types of queries with features that have never been considered and therefore can provide a thorough investigation of complex queries. Finally, we propose a new neural-symbolic method, Fuzzy Inference with Truth value (FIT), where we equip the neural link predictors with fuzzy logic theory to support end-to-end learning using complex queries with provable reasoning capability. Empirical results show that our method outperforms previous methods significantly in the new dataset and also surpasses previous methods in the existing dataset at the same time. | Hang Yin, Zihao Wang, Yangqiu Song |  |

Prior work introduced the concept of entailment cones, which uses partial orders defined by nested cones in the Poincar\'e ball to model hierarchies. Here, we introduce the \`\`shadow cones" framework, a physics-inspired entailment cone construction. Specifically, we model partial orders as subset relations between shadows formed by a light source and opaque objects in hyperbolic space. The shadow cones framework generalizes entailment cones to a broad class of formulations and hyperbolic space models beyond the Poincar\'e ball. This results in clear advantages over existing constructions: for example, shadow cones possess better optimization properties over constructions limited to the Poincar\'e ball. Our experiments on datasets of various sizes and hierarchical structures show that shadow cones consistently and significantly outperform existing entailment cone constructions. These results indicate that shadow cones are an effective way to model partial orders in hyperbolic space, offering physically intuitive and novel insights about the nature of such structures. | Tao Yu, Toni J.

A recent line of works proposed bandit-based approaches that transformed active learning into a bandit problem, achieving both theoretical and empirical success. However, the performance and computational costs of these methods may be susceptible to the number of classes, denoted as $K$, due to this transformation. Therefore, this paper seeks to answer the question: "How can we mitigate the adverse impacts of $K$ while retaining the advantages of principled exploration and provable performance guarantees in active learning?" To tackle this challenge, we propose two algorithms based on the newly designed exploitation and exploration neural networks for stream-based and pool-based active learning. Subsequently, we provide theoretical performance guarantees for both algorithms in a non-parametric setting, demonstrating a slower error-growth rate concerning $K$ for the proposed approaches. We use extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed algorithms, which consistently outperform state-of-the-art baselines. | Yikun Ban, Ishika Agarwal, Ziwei Wu, Yada Zhu, Kommy Weldemariam, Hanghang Tong, Jingrui He |  |
| 1527 |  |  [From Graphs to Hypergraphs: Hypergraph Projection and its Reconstruction](https://openreview.net/forum?id=qwYKE3VB2h) |  | 0 | We study the implications of the modeling choice to use a graph, instead of a hypergraph, to represent real-world interconnected systems whose constituent relationships are of higher order by nature. Such a modeling choice typically involves an underlying projection process that maps the original hypergraph onto a graph, and is prevalent in graph-based analysis. While hypergraph projection can potentially lead to loss of higher-order relations, there exists very limited studies on the consequences of doing so, as well as its remediation. This work fills this gap by doing two things: (1) we develop analysis based on graph and set theory, showing two ubiquitous patterns of hyperedges that are root to structural information loss in all hypergraph projections; we also quantify the combinatorial impossibility of recovering the lost higher-order structures if no extra help is provided; (2) we still seek to recover the lost higher-order structures in hypergraph projection, and in light of (1)'s findings we make reasonable assumptions to allow the help of some prior knowledge of the application domain. Under this problem setting, we develop a learning-based hypergraph reconstruction method based on an important statistic of hyperedge distributions that we find. Our reconstruction method is systematically evaluated on 8 real-world datasets under different settings, and exhibits consistently top performance. We also demonstrate benefits of the reconstructed hypergraphs through use cases of protein rankings and link predictions. | Yanbang Wang, Jon M. Kleinberg |  |

Nonetheless, this comes with substantially heavier computational costs than Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The attention mechanism in ViTs, which integrates information from different image patches to the class token ([CLS]), renders traditional structured pruning methods used in CNNs unsuitable. To overcome this issue, we propose SynergisTic pAtch pRuning (STAR) that unifies intra-layer and inter-layer patch importance scoring. Specifically, our approach combines a) online evaluation of intra-layer importance for the [CLS] and b) offline evaluation of the inter-layer importance of each patch. The two importance scores are fused by minimizing a weighted average of Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergences and patches are successively pruned at each layer by maintaining only the top-k most important ones. Unlike prior art that relies on manual selection of the pruning rates at each layer, we propose an automated method for selecting them based on offline-derived metrics. We also propose a variant that uses these rates as weighted percentile parameters (for the layer-wise normalized scores), thus leading to an alternate adaptive rate selection technique that is input-based. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant acceleration of the inference with minimal performance degradation. For instance, on the ImageNet dataset, the pruned DeiT-Small reaches a throughput of 4,256 images/s, which is over 66\% higher than the much smaller (unpruned) DeiT-Tiny model, while having a substantially higher accuracy (+6.8\% Top-1 and +3.1\% Top-5). | Yuyao Zhang, Lan Wei, Nikolaos M.

However, even in the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) case, existing BRDL methods will suffer a significant drop on model accuracy due to the large variance of stochastic gradients. Increasing batch sizes is a simple yet effective way to reduce the variance. However, when the total number of gradient computation is fixed, a too-large batch size will lead to a too-small iteration number (update number), which may also degrade the model accuracy. In view of this challenge, we mainly study the effect of batch size when the total number of gradient computation is fixed in this work. In particular, we show that when the total number of gradient computation is fixed, the optimal batch size corresponding to the tightest theoretical upper bound in BRDL increases with the fraction of Byzantine workers. Therefore, compared to the case without attacks, a larger batch size is preferred when under Byzantine attacks. Motivated by the theoretical finding, we propose a novel method called Byzantine-robust stochastic gradient descent with normalized momentum (ByzSGDnm) in order to further increase model accuracy in BRDL. We theoretically prove the convergence of ByzSGDnm for general non-convex cases under Byzantine attacks. Empirical results show that when under Byzantine attacks, compared to the cases of small batch sizes, setting a relatively large batch size can significantly increase the model accuracy, which is consistent with our theoretical results. Moreover, ByzSGDnm can achieve higher model accuracy than existing BRDL methods when under deliberately crafted attacks. In addition, we empirically show that increasing batch sizes has the bonus of training acceleration. | YiRui Yang, ChangWei Shi, WuJun Li |  |

In this paper, we are motivated to study building an LLM "cascade" to save the cost of using LLMs, particularly for performing (e.g., mathematical, causal) reasoning tasks. Our cascade pipeline follows the intuition that simpler questions can be addressed by a weaker but more affordable LLM, whereas only the most challenging questions necessitate the stronger and more expensive LLM. To realize this decision-making, we consider the "answer consistency" of the weaker LLM as a signal of the question difficulty and propose several methods for answering sampling and consistency checking, including one leveraging a mixture of two thought representations (i.e., Chain-of-Thought and Program-of-Thought). Through experiments on six reasoning benchmark datasets, with GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 being the weaker and stronger LLMs, respectively, our cascade pipeline demonstrates comparable performance but reduces about 60% of the cost compared with fully using the stronger LLM. | Murong Yue, Jie Zhao, Min Zhang, Liang Du, Ziyu Yao |  |

While diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress, they have limitations in unpaired image-to-image (I2I) translation tasks due to the Gaussian prior assumption. Schrödinger Bridge (SB), which learns an SDE to translate between two arbitrary distributions, have risen as an attractive solution to this problem. Yet, to our best knowledge, none of SB models so far have been successful at unpaired translation between high-resolution images. In this work, we propose Unpaired Neural Schrödinger Bridge (UNSB), which expresses the SB problem as a sequence of adversarial learning problems. This allows us to incorporate advanced discriminators and regularization to learn a SB between unpaired data. We show that UNSB is scalable and successfully solves various unpaired I2I translation tasks. Code: \url{https://github.com/cyclomon/UNSB} | Beomsu Kim, Gihyun Kwon, Kwanyoung Kim, Jong Chul Ye |  |

Although methods like resetting and regularization can potentially mitigate plasticity loss, the influences of various components within the VRL framework on the agent's plasticity are still poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a systematic empirical exploration focusing on three primary underexplored facets and derive the following insightful conclusions: (1) data augmentation is essential in maintaining plasticity; (2) the critic's plasticity loss serves as the principal bottleneck impeding efficient training; and (3) without timely intervention to recover critic's plasticity in the early stages, its loss becomes catastrophic. These insights suggest a novel strategy to address the high replay ratio (RR) dilemma, where exacerbated plasticity loss hinders the potential improvements of sample efficiency brought by increased reuse frequency. Rather than setting a static RR for the entire training process, we propose Adaptive RR, which dynamically adjusts the RR based on the critic’s plasticity level. Extensive evaluations indicate that Adaptive RR not only avoids catastrophic plasticity loss in the early stages but also benefits from more frequent reuse in later phases, resulting in superior sample efficiency. | Guozheng Ma, Lu Li, Sen Zhang, Zixuan Liu, Zhen Wang, Yixin Chen, Li Shen, Xueqian Wang, Dacheng Tao |  |

However, these advances have not been reflected in the translation task, especially those with moderate model sizes (i.e., 7B or 13B parameters), which still lag behind conventional supervised encoder-decoder translation models. Previous studies have attempted to improve the translation capabilities of these LLMs, but their gains have been limited. In this study, we propose a novel fine-tuning approach for LLMs that is specifically designed for the translation task, eliminating the need for the abundant parallel data that traditional translation models usually depend on. Our approach consists of two fine-tuning stages: initial fine-tuning on monolingual data followed by subsequent fine-tuning on a small set of high-quality parallel data. We introduce the LLM developed through this strategy as \*\*A\*\*dvanced \*\*L\*\*anguage \*\*M\*\*odel-based tr\*\*A\*\*nslator (\*\*ALMA\*\*). Based on LLaMA-2 as our underlying model, our results show that the model can achieve an average improvement of more than 12 BLEU and 12 COMET over its zero-shot performance across 10 translation directions from the WMT'21 (2 directions) and WMT'22 (8 directions) test datasets. The performance is significantly better than all prior work and even superior to the NLLB-54B model \citep{nllb} and GPT-3.5-text-davinci-003, with only 7B or 13B parameters. This method establishes the foundation for a novel training paradigm in machine translation. | Haoran Xu, Young Jin Kim, Amr Sharaf, Hany Hassan Awadalla |  |

Unlike traditional open-vocabulary object detection tasks that rely on users providing a list of required category names, IOD requires models to comprehend natural-language instructions, contextual reasoning, and output the name and location of the desired categories. This poses fresh challenges for modern object detection systems. To develop an IOD system, we create a dataset called IOD-Bench, which consists of instruction-guided detections, along with specialized evaluation metrics. We leverage large-scale language models (LLMs) to generate a diverse set of instructions (8k+) based on existing public object detection datasets, covering a wide range of real-world scenarios. As an initial approach to the IOD task, we propose a model called Ins-DetCLIP. It harnesses the extensive knowledge within LLMs to empower the detector with instruction-following capabilities. Specifically, our Ins-DetCLIP employs a visual encoder (i.e., DetCLIP, an open-vocabulary detector) to extract object-level features. These features are then aligned with the input instructions using a cross-modal fusion module integrated into a pre-trained LLM. Experimental results conducted on IOD-Bench demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms baseline methods that directly combine LLMs with detection models. This research aims to pave the way for a more adaptable and versatile interaction paradigm in modern object detection systems, making a significant contribution to the field. | Renjie Pi, Lewei Yao, Jianhua Han, Xiaodan Liang, Wei Zhang, Hang Xu |  |

Local learning, which updates each layer independently with a gradient-isolated auxiliary network, offers a promising alternative to address the above problems. However, existing local learning methods are confronted with a large accuracy gap with the BP counterpart, particularly for large-scale networks. This is due to the weak coupling between local layers and their subsequent network layers, as there is no gradient communication across layers. To tackle this issue, we put forward an augmented local learning method, dubbed AugLocal. AugLocal constructs each hidden layer’s auxiliary network by uniformly selecting a small subset of layers from its subsequent network layers to enhance their synergy. We also propose to linearly reduce the depth of auxiliary networks as the hidden layer goes deeper, ensuring sufficient network capacity while reducing the computational cost of auxiliary networks. Our extensive experiments on four image classification datasets (i.e., CIFAR-10, SVHN, STL-10, and ImageNet) demonstrate that AugLocal can effectively scale up to tens of local layers with a comparable accuracy to BP-trained networks while reducing GPU memory usage by around 40%. The proposed AugLocal method, therefore, opens up a myriad of opportunities for training high-performance deep neural networks on resource-constrained platforms. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/ChenxiangMA/AugLocal}. | Chenxiang Ma, Jibin Wu, Chenyang Si, Kay Chen Tan |  |

However, existing guidance schemes are to be desired. On one hand, mainstream methods such as classifier guidance and classifier-free guidance both require extra training with labeled data, which is time-consuming and unable to adapt to new conditions. On the other hand, training-free methods such as universal guidance, though more flexible, have yet to demonstrate comparable performance. In this work, through a comprehensive investigation into the design space, we show that it is possible to achieve significant performance improvements over existing guidance schemes by leveraging off-the-shelf classifiers in a training-free fashion, enjoying the best of both worlds. Employing calibration as a general guideline, we propose several pre-conditioning techniques to better exploit pretrained off-the-shelf classifiers for guiding diffusion generation. Extensive experiments on ImageNet validate our proposed method, showing that state-of-the-art (SOTA) diffusion models (DDPM, EDM, DiT) can be further improved (up to 20\%) using off-the-shelf classifiers with barely any extra computational cost. With the proliferation of publicly available pretrained classifiers, our proposed approach has great potential and can be readily scaled up to text-to-image generation tasks. | Jiajun Ma, Tianyang Hu, Wenjia Wang, Jiacheng Sun |  |

In this work, we propose a new \emph{practical} data extraction attack that we call \`\`neural phishing''. This attack enables an adversary to target and extract sensitive or personally identifiable information (PII), e.g., credit card numbers, from a model trained on user data with upwards of $10\%$ attack success rates, at times, as high as $50\%$. Our attack assumes only that an adversary can insert as few as $10$s of benign-appearing sentences into the training dataset using only vague priors on the structure of the user data. | Ashwinee Panda, Christopher A.

At the same time, teams of robots should co-acquire diverse skills through their heterogeneous experiences in varied settings. How can we enable such fleet-level learning without having to transmit or centralize fleet-scale data? In this paper, we investigate policy merging (PoMe) from such distributed heterogeneous datasets as a potential solution. To efficiently merge policies in the fleet setting, we propose FLEET-MERGE, an instantiation of distributed learning that accounts for the permutation invariance that arises when parameterizing the control policies with recurrent neural networks. We show that FLEET-MERGE consolidates the behavior of policies trained on 50 tasks in the Meta-World environment, with good performance on nearly all training tasks at test time. Moreover, we introduce a novel robotic tool-use benchmark, FLEET-TOOLS, for fleet policy learning in compositional and contact-rich robot manipulation tasks, to validate the efficacy of FLEET-MERGE on the benchmark. | Lirui Wang, Kaiqing Zhang, Allan Zhou, Max Simchowitz, Russ Tedrake |  |

We propose that the decision to conceptualize a physical procedure should not depend on how we name it (semantics) but rather on the significance of the informativeness in its representation regarding the low-level physical state and state changes. We model manipulation concepts -- discrete symbols -- as generative and discriminative goals and derive metrics that can autonomously link them to meaningful sub-trajectories from noisy, unlabeled demonstrations. Specifically, we employ a trainable codebook containing encodings --symbols -- capable of synthesizing the end-state of a sub-trajectory given the current state (generative informativeness). Moreover, the encoding corresponding to a particular sub-trajectory should differentiate the state within and outside it and confidently predict the subsequent action based on the gradient of its discriminative score (discriminative informativeness). These metrics, which do not rely on human annotation, can be seamlessly integrated into a VQ-VAE framework, enabling the partitioning of demonstrations into semantically consistent sub-trajectories, fulfilling the purpose of discovering manipulation concepts and the corresponding (sub)-goal states. We evaluate the effectiveness of the learned concepts by training policies that utilize them as guidance, demonstrating superior performance compared to other baselines. Additionally, our discovered manipulation concepts compare favorably to human-annotated ones, while saving much manual effort. The code and trained models will be made public. | Ruizhe Liu, Qian Luo, Yanchao Yang |  |

Specifically, we propose a novel algorithmic framework named Local-fitted Optimization with OPtimism (LOOP), which incorporates both model-based and value-based incarnations. In particular, LOOP features a novel construction of confidence sets and a low-switching policy updating scheme, which are tailored to the average-reward and function approximation setting. Moreover, for AMDPs, we propose a novel complexity measure --- average-reward generalized eluder coefficient (AGEC) --- which captures the challenge of exploration in AMDPs with general function approximation. Such a complexity measure encompasses almost all previously known tractable AMDP models, such as linear AMDPs and linear mixture AMDPs, and also includes newly identified cases such as kernel AMDPs and AMDPs with Bellman eluder dimensions. Using AGEC, we prove that LOOP achieves a sublinear $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\mathrm{poly}(d, \mathrm{sp}(V^\*)) \sqrt{T\beta} )$ regret, where $d$ and $\beta$ correspond to AGEC and log-covering number of the hypothesis class respectively, $\mathrm{sp}(V^\*)$ is the span of the optimal state bias function, $T$ denotes the number of steps, and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}} (\cdot) $ omits logarithmic factors. When specialized to concrete AMDP models, our regret bounds are comparable to those established by the existing algorithms designed specifically for these special cases. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first comprehensive theoretical framework capable of handling nearly all AMDPs. | Jianliang He, Han Zhong, Zhuoran Yang |  |

In this paper, we study embedding-based entity alignment (EEA) from a perspective of generative models. We show that EEA shares similarities with typical generative models and prove the effectiveness of the recently developed generative adversarial network (GAN)-based EEA methods theoretically. We then reveal that their incomplete objective limits the capacity on both entity alignment and entity synthesis (i.e., generating new entities). We mitigate this problem by introducing a generative EEA (GEEA) framework with the proposed mutual variational autoencoder (M-VAE) as the generative model. M-VAE enables entity conversion between KGs and generation of new entities from random noise vectors. We demonstrate the power of GEEA with theoretical analysis and empirical experiments on both entity alignment and entity synthesis tasks.

Sparse linear methods (SLIM) and their variations show outstanding performance, but they are memory-intensive and hard to scale. ImplicitSLIM improves embedding-based models by extracting embeddings from SLIM-like models in a computationally cheap and memory-efficient way, without explicit learning of heavy SLIM-like models. We show that ImplicitSLIM improves performance and speeds up convergence for both state of the art and classical collaborative filtering methods.

However, existing fusion strategies for modalities primarily rely on explicit interaction structures that fail to capture the diverse aspects and patterns inherent in input data. This yields limited performance in zero-shot contexts, especially when fine-grained classifications and abstract interpretations are required. To address this, we propose an effective approach, namely Prompt Learning with Quaternion Networks (QNet), for semantic alignment across diverse modalities. QNet employs a quaternion hidden space where the mutually orthogonal imaginary axes capture rich intermodal semantic spatial correlations from various perspectives. Hierarchical features across multilayers are utilized to encode intricate interdependencies within various modalities with reduced parameters. Our experiments on 11 datasets demonstrate that QNet outperforms state-of-the-art prompt learning techniques in base-to-novel generalization, cross-dataset transfer, and domain transfer scenarios with fewer learnable parameters.

Recent approaches use a family of prior probability density functions or recurrent neural network models, whose parameters can be optimized by utilizing labeled data from the observed tasks. While these approaches have appealing empirical performance, expressiveness of their prior is relatively low, which limits generalization and interpretation of meta-learning. Aiming at expressive yet meaningful priors, this contribution puts forth a novel prior representation model that leverages the notion of algorithm unrolling. The key idea is to unroll the proximal gradient descent steps, where learnable piecewise linear functions are developed to approximate the desired proximal operators within \*tight\* theoretical error bounds established for both smooth and non-smooth proximal functions. The resultant multi-block neural network not only broadens the scope of learnable priors, but also enhances interpretability from an optimization viewpoint. Numerical tests conducted on few-shot learning datasets demonstrate markedly improved performance with flexible, visualizable, and understandable priors. | Yilang Zhang, Georgios B. Giannakis |  |
| 1545 |  |  [Bidirectional Temporal Diffusion Model for Temporally Consistent Human Animation](https://openreview.net/forum?id=yQDFsuG9HP) |  | 0 | We introduce a method to generate temporally coherent human animation from a single image, a video, or a random noise. This problem has been formulated as modeling of an auto-regressive generation, i.e., to regress past frames to decode future frames. However, such unidirectional generation is highly prone to motion drifting over time, generating unrealistic human animation with significant artifacts such as appearance distortion. We claim that bidirectional temporal modeling enforces temporal coherence on a generative network by largely suppressing the appearance ambiguity. To prove our claim, we design a novel human animation framework using a denoising diffusion model: a neural network learns to generate the image of a person by denoising temporal Gaussian noises whose intermediate results are cross-conditioned bidirectionally between consecutive frames. In the experiments, our method demonstrates strong performance compared to existing unidirectional approaches with realistic temporal coherence. | Tserendorj Adiya, Jae Shin Yoon, Jungeun Lee, Sanghun Kim, Hwasup Lim |  |

Our method is based on local linearization, which we show to be an optimal approximation in terms of total variation distance for the ReLU non-linearity. This allows propagating Gaussian and Cauchy input uncertainties through neural networks to quantify their output uncertainties. To demonstrate the utility of propagating distributions, we apply the proposed method to predicting calibrated confidence intervals and selective prediction on out-of-distribution data. The results demonstrate a broad applicability of propagating distributions and show the advantages of our method over other approaches such as moment matching. | Felix Petersen, Aashwin Ananda Mishra, Hilde Kuehne, Christian Borgelt, Oliver Deussen, Mikhail Yurochkin |  |

Their modular nature has enabled the use of template-based methods to generate hypothetical MOFs by combining molecular building blocks in accordance with known network topologies. However, the ability of these methods to identify top-performing MOFs is often hindered by the limited diversity of the resulting chemical space. In this work, we propose MOFDiff: a coarse-grained (CG) diffusion model that generates CG MOF structures through a denoising diffusion process over the coordinates and identities of the building blocks. The all-atom MOF structure is then determined through a novel assembly algorithm. As the diffusion model generates 3D MOF structures by predicting scores in E(3), we employ equivariant graph neural networks that respect the permutational and roto-translational symmetries. We comprehensively evaluate our model's capability to generate valid and novel MOF structures and its effectiveness in designing outstanding MOF materials for carbon capture applications with molecular simulations. | Xiang Fu, Tian Xie, Andrew S.

Nevertheless, FL encounters challenges due to non-independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d) data, leading to potential performance degradation and hindered convergence. While prior studies predominantly addressed the issue of skewed label distribution, our research addresses a crucial yet frequently overlooked problem known as multi-domain FL. In this scenario, clients' data originate from diverse domains with distinct feature distributions, instead of label distributions. To address the multi-domain problem in FL, we propose a novel method called Federated Learning Without Normalizations (FedWon). FedWon draws inspiration from the observation that batch normalization (BN) faces challenges in effectively modeling the statistics of multiple domains, while existing normalization techniques possess their own limitations. In order to address these issues, FedWon eliminates the normalization layers in FL and reparameterizes convolution layers with scaled weight standardization. Through extensive experimentation on five datasets and five models, our comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that FedWon surpasses both FedAvg and the current state-of-the-art method (FedBN) across all experimental setups, achieving notable accuracy improvements of more than 10% in certain domains. Furthermore, FedWon is versatile for both cross-silo and cross-device FL, exhibiting robust domain generalization capability, showcasing strong performance even with a batch size as small as 1, thereby catering to resource-constrained devices. Additionally, FedWon can also effectively tackle the challenge of skewed label distribution. | Weiming Zhuang, Lingjuan Lyu |  |

This is mainly because of the scarcity of data and the computational challenges associated with training or fine-tuning these large models for such applications. Prior work mainly emphasizes either effective \emph{pretraining} of large models for decision-making or single-task adaptation. But real-world problems will require data-efficient, \emph{continual adaptation} for new control tasks. Recognizing these constraints, we introduce TAIL (Task-specific Adapters for Imitation Learning), a framework for efficient adaptation to new control tasks. Inspired by recent advancements in parameter-efficient fine-tuning in language domains, we explore efficient fine-tuning techniques---e.g., Bottleneck Adapters, P-Tuning, and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)---in TAIL to adapt large pretrained models for new tasks with limited demonstration data. Our extensive experiments comparing prevalent parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques and adaptation baselines suggest that TAIL with LoRA can achieve the best post-adaptation performance with only 1\% of the trainable parameters of full fine-tuning, while avoiding catastrophic forgetting and preserving adaptation plasticity in continual learning settings. | Zuxin Liu, Jesse Zhang, Kavosh Asadi, Yao Liu, Ding Zhao, Shoham Sabach, Rasool Fakoor |  |

However, such presolvers in existing literature or open-source solvers are mostly set by default agnostic to specific input instances, and few studies have been reported on tailoring presolving settings. In this paper, we aim to dive into this open question and show that the MIP solver can be indeed largely improved when switching the default instance-agnostic presolving into instance-specific presolving. Specifically, we propose a combination of supervised learning and classic heuristics to achieve efficient presolving adjusting, avoiding tedious reinforcement learning. Notably, our approach is orthogonal from many recent efforts in incorporating learning modules into the B&B framework after the presolving stage, and to our best knowledge, this is the first work for introducing learning to presolve in MIP solvers. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets show that well-trained neural networks can infer proper presolving for arbitrary incoming MIP instances in less than 0.5s, which is neglectable compared with the solving time often hours or days. | Chang Liu, Zhichen Dong, Haobo Ma, Weilin Luo, Xijun Li, Bowen Pang, Jia Zeng, Junchi Yan |  |

Recent research has made significant strides in detecting and quantifying feature interactions in single predictive models. However, we argue that the feature interactions extracted from a single pre-specified model may not be trustworthy since: \*a well-trained predictive model may not preserve the true feature interactions and there exist multiple well-performing predictive models that differ in feature interaction strengths\*. Thus, we recommend exploring feature interaction strengths in a model class of approximately equally accurate predictive models. In this work, we introduce the feature interaction score (FIS) in the context of a Rashomon set, representing a collection of models that achieve similar accuracy on a given task. We propose a general and practical algorithm to calculate the FIS in the model class. We demonstrate the properties of the FIS via synthetic data and draw connections to other areas of statistics. Additionally, we introduce a Halo plot for visualizing the feature interaction variance in high-dimensional space and a swarm plot for analyzing FIS in a Rashomon set. Experiments with recidivism prediction and image classification illustrate how feature interactions can vary dramatically in importance for similarly accurate predictive models. Our results suggest that the proposed FIS can provide valuable insights into the nature of feature interactions in machine learning models. | Sichao Li, Rong Wang, Quanling Deng, Amanda S.

Researchers have attempted to address the problem with machine learning and fragmentation-based methods. However, the two approaches fail to give a satisfactory description of long-range and many-body interactions, respectively. Inspired by fragmentation-based methods, we propose the Long-Short-Range Message-Passing (LSR-MP) framework as a generalization of the existing equivariant graph neural networks (EGNNs) with the intent to incorporate long-range interactions efficiently and effectively. We apply the LSR-MP framework to the recently proposed ViSNet and demonstrate the state-of-the-art results with up to 40% MAE reduction for molecules in MD22 and Chignolin datasets. Consistent improvements to various EGNNs will also be discussed to illustrate the general applicability and robustness of our LSR-MP framework.

These objectives are typically represented by Gaussian process (GP) surrogate models which are easy to optimize and support exact inference. While standard GP surrogates have been well-established in Bayesian optimization, Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) have recently become practical function approximators, with many benefits over standard GPs such as the ability to naturally handle non-stationarity and learn representations for high-dimensional data. In this paper, we study BNNs as alternatives to standard GP surrogates for optimization. We consider a variety of approximate inference procedures for finite-width BNNs, including high-quality Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, low-cost stochastic MCMC, and heuristics such as deep ensembles. We also consider infinite-width BNNs, linearized Laplace approximations, and partially stochastic models such as deep kernel learning. We evaluate this collection of surrogate models on diverse problems with varying dimensionality, number of objectives, non-stationarity, and discrete and continuous inputs. We find: (i) the ranking of methods is highly problem dependent, suggesting the need for tailored inductive biases; (ii) HMC is the most successful approximate inference procedure for fully stochastic BNNs; (iii) full stochasticity may be unnecessary as deep kernel learning is relatively competitive; (iv) deep ensembles perform relatively poorly; (v) infinite-width BNNs are particularly promising, especially in high dimensions. | Yucen Lily Li, Tim G.

In this work, we introduce a new prompting approach, analogical prompting, designed to automatically guide the reasoning process of large language models. Inspired by analogical reasoning, a cognitive process in which humans draw from relevant past experiences to tackle new problems, our approach prompts language models to self-generate relevant exemplars or knowledge in the context, before proceeding to solve the given problem. This method presents several advantages: it obviates the need for labeling or retrieving exemplars, offering generality and convenience; it can also tailor the generated exemplars and knowledge to each problem, offering adaptability. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms 0-shot CoT and manual few-shot CoT in a variety of reasoning tasks, including math problem solving in GSM8K and MATH, code generation in Codeforces, and other reasoning tasks in BIG-Bench. | Michihiro Yasunaga, Xinyun Chen, Yujia Li, Panupong Pasupat, Jure Leskovec, Percy Liang, Ed H.

While latent variable models (LVMs) are successful in describing high-dimensional data, they are typically only designed for a single type of data, making it difficult to identify structure shared across different experimental data modalities. Here, we address this shortcoming by proposing an unsupervised LVM which extracts shared and independent latents for distinct, simultaneously recorded experimental modalities. We do this by combining Gaussian Process Factor Analysis (GPFA), an interpretable LVM for neural spiking data with temporally smooth latent space, with Gaussian Process Variational Autoencoders (GP-VAEs), which similarly use a GP prior to characterize correlations in a latent space, but admit rich expressivity due to a deep neural network mapping to observations. We achieve interpretability in our model by partitioning latent variability into components that are either shared between or independent to each modality. We parameterize the latents of our model in the Fourier domain, and show improved latent identification using this approach over standard GP-VAE methods. We validate our model on simulated multi-modal data consisting of Poisson spike counts and MNIST images that scale and rotate smoothly over time. We show that the multi-modal GP-VAE (MM-GPVAE) is able to not only identify the shared and independent latent structure across modalities accurately, but provides good reconstructions of both images and neural rates on held-out trials. Finally, we demonstrate our framework on two real world multi-modal experimental settings: Drosophila whole-brain calcium imaging alongside tracked limb positions, and Manduca sexta spike train measurements from ten wing muscles as the animal tracks a visual stimulus. | Rabia Gondur, Usama Bin Sikandar, Evan Schaffer, Mikio Christian Aoi, Stephen L.

As the size of these foundation models and the number of downstream tasks grow, the standard full fine-tuning paradigm becomes unsustainable due to heavy computational and storage costs. This paper proposes UniAdapter, which unifies unimodal and multimodal adapters for parameter-efficient cross-modal adaptation on pre-trained vision-language models. Specifically, adapters are distributed to different modalities and their interactions, with the total number of tunable parameters reduced by partial weight sharing. The unified and knowledge-sharing design enables powerful cross-modal representations that can benefit various downstream tasks, requiring only 1.0%-2.0% tunable parameters of the pre-trained model. Extensive experiments on 7 cross-modal downstream benchmarks (including video-text retrieval, image-text retrieval, VideoQA, VQA and Caption) show that in most cases, UniAdapter not only outperforms the state-of-the-arts, but even beats the full fine-tuning strategy. Particularly, on the MSRVTT retrieval task, UniAdapter achieves 49.7% recall@1 with 2.2% model parameters, outperforming the latest competitors by 2.0%.

However, the overconfident target harms generalization and causes the problem of robust overfitting. To address this issue and enhance adversarial robustness, we analyze the characteristics of robust models and identify that robust models tend to produce smoother and well-calibrated outputs. Based on the observation, we propose a simple yet effective method, Annealing Self-Distillation Rectification (ADR), which generates soft labels as a better guidance mechanism that reflects the underlying distribution of data. By utilizing ADR, we can obtain rectified labels that improve model robustness without the need for pre-trained models or extensive extra computation. Moreover, our method facilitates seamless plug-and-play integration with other adversarial training techniques by replacing the hard labels in their objectives. We demonstrate the efficacy of ADR through extensive experiments and strong performances across datasets. | YuYu Wu, HungJui Wang, ShangTse Chen |  |

In this study, we investigate the effect of hue variance in the context of video understanding and find this variance to be beneficial since static appearances are less important in videos that contain motion information. Based on this observation, we propose a data augmentation method for video understanding, named Motion Coherent Augmentation (MCA), that introduces appearance variation in videos and implicitly encourages the model to prioritize motion patterns, rather than static appearances. Concretely, we propose an operation SwapMix to efficiently modify the appearance of video samples, and introduce Variation Alignment (VA) to resolve the distribution shift caused by SwapMix, enforcing the model to learn appearance invariant representations. Comprehensive empirical evaluation across various architectures and different datasets solidly validates the effectiveness and generalization ability of MCA, and the application of VA in other augmentation methods.

Unlike natural language process (NLP) and computer vision (CV), where a single large model can tackle multiple tasks, models for time series forecasting are often specialized, necessitating distinct designs for different tasks and applications. While pre-trained foundation models have made impressive strides in NLP and CV, their development in time series domains has been constrained by data sparsity. Recent studies have revealed that large language models (LLMs) possess robust pattern recognition and reasoning abilities over complex sequences of tokens. However, the challenge remains in effectively aligning the modalities of time series data and natural language to leverage these capabilities. In this work, we present Time-LLM, a reprogramming framework to repurpose LLMs for general time series forecasting with the backbone language models kept intact. We begin by reprogramming the input time series with text prototypes before feeding it into the frozen LLM to align the two modalities. To augment the LLM's ability to reason with time series data, we propose Prompt-as-Prefix (PaP), which enriches the input context and directs the transformation of reprogrammed input patches. The transformed time series patches from the LLM are finally projected to obtain the forecasts. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that \method is a powerful time series learner that outperforms state-of-the-art, specialized forecasting models. Moreover, Time-LLM excels in both few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios. The code is made available at https://github.com/KimMeen/Time-LLM. | Ming Jin, Shiyu Wang, Lintao Ma, Zhixuan Chu, James Y.

While prompt-tuning has yielded continuous advancements in various tasks, such an approach still remains a persistent defect: prompt-tuning methods fail to generalize to specific few-shot patterns. From the perspective of distribution analyses, we disclose that the intrinsic issues behind the phenomenon are the over-multitudinous conceptual knowledge contained in PLMs and the abridged knowledge for target downstream domains, which jointly result in that PLMs mis-locate the knowledge distributions corresponding to the target domains in the universal knowledge embedding space. To this end, we intuitively explore to approximate the unabridged target domains of downstream tasks in a debiased manner, and then abstract such domains to generate discriminative prompts, thereby providing the de-ambiguous guidance for PLMs. Guided by such an intuition, we propose a simple yet effective approach, namely BayesPrompt, to learn prompts that contain the domain discriminative information against the interference from domain-irrelevant knowledge. BayesPrompt primitively leverages known distributions to approximate the debiased factual distributions of target domains and further uniformly samples certain representative features from the approximated distributions to generate the ultimate prompts for PLMs. We provide theoretical insights with the connection to domain adaptation. Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks. | Jiangmeng Li, Fei Song, Yifan Jin, Wenwen Qiang, Changwen Zheng, Fuchun Sun, Hui Xiong |  |

In this work, we propose a new hybrid RL algorithm that combines an on-policy actor-critic method with offline data. On-policy methods such as policy gradient and natural policy gradient (NPG) have shown to be more robust to model misspecification, though sometimes it may not be as sample efficient as methods that rely on off-policy learning. On the other hand, offline methods that depend on off-policy training often require strong assumptions in theory and are less stable to train in practice. Our new approach integrates a procedure of off-policy training on the offline data into an on-policy NPG framework. We show that our approach, in theory, can obtain a \*best-of-both-worlds\* type of result --- it achieves the state-of-art theoretical guarantees of offline RL when offline RL-specific assumptions hold, while at the same time maintaining the theoretical guarantees of on-policy NPG regardless of the offline RL assumptions' validity. Experimentally, in challenging rich-observation environments, we show that our approach outperforms a state-of-the-art hybrid RL baseline which only relies on off-policy policy optimization, demonstrating the empirical benefit of combining on-policy and off-policy learning. | Yifei Zhou, Ayush Sekhari, Yuda Song, Wen Sun |  |

In this work, we tackle dataset distillation at its core by treating it directly as a bilevel optimization problem. Re-examining the foundational back-propagation through time method, we study the pronounced variance in the gradients, computational burden, and long-term dependencies. We introduce an improved method: Random Truncated Backpropagation Through Time (RaT-BPTT) to address them. RaT-BPTT incorporates a truncation coupled with a random window, effectively stabilizing the gradients and speeding up the optimization while covering long dependencies. This allows us to establish new state-of-the-art for a variety of standard dataset benchmarks. A deeper dive into the nature of distilled data unveils pronounced intercorrelation. In particular, subsets of distilled datasets tend to exhibit much worse performance than directly distilled smaller datasets of the same size. Leveraging RaT-BPTT, we devise a boosting mechanism that generates distilled datasets that contain subsets with near optimal performance across different data budgets. | Yunzhen Feng, Shanmukha Ramakrishna Vedantam, Julia Kempe |  |

Though existing approaches in protein design have thoroughly explored structure-to-sequence dependencies in proteins, RNA design still confronts difficulties due to structural complexity and data scarcity. Moreover, direct transplantation of protein design methodologies into RNA design fails to achieve satisfactory outcomes although sharing similar structural components. In this study, we aim to systematically construct a data-driven RNA design pipeline. We crafted a large, well-curated benchmark dataset and designed a comprehensive structural modeling approach to represent the complex RNA tertiary structure. More importantly, we proposed a hierarchical data-efficient representation learning framework that learns structural representations through contrastive learning at both cluster-level and sample-level to fully leverage the limited data. By constraining data representations within a limited hyperspherical space, the intrinsic relationships between data points could be explicitly imposed. Moreover, we incorporated extracted secondary structures with base pairs as prior knowledge to facilitate the RNA design process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, providing a reliable baseline for future RNA design tasks.

The target private category is set as the unknown class during the adaptation process, as it is not included in the source domain. However, most existing methods overlook the intra-class structure within a category, especially in cases where there exists significant concept shift between the samples belonging to the same category. When samples with large concept shift are forced to be pushed together, it may negatively affect the adaptation performance. Moreover, from the interpretability aspect, it is unreasonable to align visual features with significant differences, such as fighter jets and civil aircraft, into the same category. Unfortunately, due to such semantic ambiguity and annotation cost, categories are not always classified in detail, making it difficult for the model to perform precise adaptation. To address these issues, we propose a novel Memory-Assisted Sub-Prototype Mining (MemSPM) method that can learn the differences between samples belonging to the same category and mine sub-classes when there exists significant concept shift between them. By doing so, our model learns a more reasonable feature space that enhances the transferability and reflects the inherent differences among samples annotated as the same category. We evaluate the effectiveness of our MemSPM method over multiple scenarios, including UniDA, OSDA, and PDA. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks in most cases. | Yuxiang Lai, Yi Zhou, Xinghong Liu, Tao Zhou |  |
| 1565 |  |  [Large Language Models as Tool Makers](https://openreview.net/forum?id=qV83K9d5WB) |  | 0 | Recent research has highlighted the potential of large language models (LLMs) to improve their problem-solving capabilities with the aid of suitable external tools. In our work, we further advance this concept by introducing a closed- loop framework, referred to as LLMs A s Tool Makers (LATM), where LLMs create their own reusable tools for problem-solving. Our approach consists of two phases: 1) tool making: an LLM acts as the tool maker that crafts tools for a set of tasks, where a tool is implemented as a Python utility function. 2) tool using: another LLM acts as the tool user, which applies the tool built by the tool maker for problem-solving. The tool user can be either the same or a different LLM from the tool maker. On the problem-solving server side, tool-making enables continual tool generation and caching as new requests emerge. This framework enables subsequent requests to access cached tools via their corresponding APIs, enhancing the efficiency of task resolution. Beyond enabling LLMs to create their own tools, our framework also uncovers intriguing opportunities to optimize the serving cost of LLMs: Recognizing that tool-making requires more sophisticated capabilities, we assign this task to a powerful, albeit resource-intensive, model. Conversely, the simpler tool-using phase is delegated to a lightweight model. This strategic division of labor allows the once-off cost of tool-making to be spread over multiple instances of tool-using, significantly reducing average costs while maintaining strong performance. Furthermore, our method offers a functional cache through the caching and reuse of tools, which stores the functionality of a class of requests instead of the natural language responses from LLMs, thus extending the applicability of the conventional cache mechanism. We evaluate our approach across various complex reasoning tasks, including Big-Bench tasks. With GPT-4 as the tool maker and GPT-3.5 as the tool user, LATM demonstrates performance equivalent to using GPT-4 for both roles, but with a significantly reduced inference cost. | Tianle Cai, Xuezhi Wang, Tengyu Ma, Xinyun Chen, Denny Zhou |  |

However, these models sometimes show inconsistencies and problematic behavior, such as hallucinating facts, generating flawed code, or creating offensive and toxic content. Unlike these models, humans typically utilize external tools to cross-check and refine their initial content, like using a search engine for fact-checking, or a code interpreter for debugging. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a framework called CRITIC that allows LLMs, which are essentially “black boxes” to validate and progressively amend their own outputs in a manner similar to human interaction with tools. More specifically, starting with an initial output, CRITIC interacts with appropriate tools to evaluate certain aspects of the text, and then revises the output based on the feedback obtained during this validation process. Comprehensive evaluations involving free-form question answering, mathematical program synthesis, and toxicity reduction demonstrate that CRITIC consistently enhances the performance of LLMs. Meanwhile, our research highlights the crucial importance of external feedback in promoting the ongoing self-improvement of LLMs. | Zhibin Gou, Zhihong Shao, Yeyun Gong, Yelong Shen, Yujiu Yang, Nan Duan, Weizhu Chen |  |

However, most of the existing methods are focused on classification tasks using images and language datasets. Therefore, in order to expand the transfer learning scheme to regression tasks, we propose a novel transfer technique based on differential geometry, namely the Geometrically Aligned Transfer Encoder (${\it GATE}$). In this method, we interpret the latent vectors from the model to exist on a Riemannian curved manifold. We find a proper diffeomorphism between pairs of tasks to ensure that every arbitrary point maps to a locally flat coordinate in the overlapping region, allowing the transfer of knowledge from the source to the target data. This also serves as an effective regularizer for the model to behave in extrapolation regions. In this article, we demonstrate that ${\it GATE}$ outperforms conventional methods and exhibits stable behavior in both the latent space and extrapolation regions for various molecular graph datasets. | Sung Moon Ko, Sumin Lee, DaeWoong Jeong, Woohyung Lim, Sehui Han |  |

We attempt to address this shortcoming by introducing AmP, a framework, dataset, and challenge for translating ambiguous natural language to formal representations like logic and code. We define templates and generate data for five well-documented linguistic ambiguities. Using AmP, we investigate how several few-shot text-to-code systems handle ambiguity, introducing three new metrics. We find that large pre-trained models perform poorly at capturing the distribution of possible meanings without deliberate instruction. However, models are able to capture the distribution well when ambiguity is attested in their inputs. These results motivate a call for including ambiguity explicitly in datasets and promote considering the distribution of possible outputs when evaluating systems. We release our data and code. | Elias StengelEskin, Kyle Rawlins, Benjamin Van Durme |  |

In this work, we introduce a novel graph generation method leveraging $K^2$ representation, originally designed for lossless graph compression. The $K^2$ representation enables compact generation while concurrently capturing an inherent hierarchical structure of a graph. In addition, we make contributions by (1) presenting a sequential $K^2$ representation that incorporates pruning, flattening, and tokenization processes and (2) introducing a Transformer-based architecture designed to generate the sequence by incorporating a specialized tree positional encoding scheme. Finally, we extensively evaluate our algorithm on four general and two molecular graph datasets to confirm its superiority for graph generation. | Yunhui Jang, Dongwoo Kim, Sungsoo Ahn |  |

In this paper, we propose Manifold Preserving Guided Diffusion (MPGD), a training-free conditional generation framework that leverages pretrained diffusion models and off-the-shelf neural networks with minimal additional inference cost for a broad range of tasks. Specifically, we leverage the manifold hypothesis to refine the guided diffusion steps and introduce a shortcut algorithm in the process. We then propose two methods for on-manifold training-free guidance using pre-trained autoencoders and demonstrate that our shortcut inherently preserves the manifolds when applied to latent diffusion models. Our experiments show that MPGD is efficient and effective for solving a variety of conditional generation applications in low-compute settings, and can consistently offer up to 3.8× speed-ups with the same number of diffusion steps while maintaining high sample quality compared to the baselines. | Yutong He, Naoki Murata, ChiehHsin Lai, Yuhta Takida, Toshimitsu Uesaka, Dongjun Kim, WeiHsiang Liao, Yuki Mitsufuji, J.

First, We introduce MPNN-then-SF, an innovative architecture leveraging structural feature (SF) to guide MPNN's representation pooling, with its implementation, namely Neural Common Neighbor (NCN). NCN exhibits superior expressiveness and scalability compared with existing models, which can be classified into two categories: SF-then-MPNN, augmenting MPNN's input with SF, and SF-and-MPNN, decoupling SF and MPNN. Second, we investigate the impact of graph incompleteness---the phenomenon that some links are unobserved in the input graph---on SF, like the common neighbor. Through dataset visualization, we observe that incompleteness reduces common neighbors and induces distribution shifts, significantly affecting model performance. To address this issue, we propose to use a link prediction model to complete the common neighbor structure. Combining this method with NCN, we propose Neural Common Neighbor with Completion (NCNC). NCN and NCNC outperform recent strong baselines by large margins, and NCNC further surpasses state-of-the-art models in standard link prediction benchmarks. | Xiyuan Wang, Haotong Yang, Muhan Zhang |  |

Our key insight is to use latent features drawn from a learnable prior distribution conditioned on the underlying particle states to capture the invisible and complex physical properties. To achieve this, we train a parametrized prior learner given visual observations to approximate the visual posterior of inverse graphics, and both the particle states and the visual posterior are obtained from a learned neural renderer. The converged prior learner is embedded in our probabilistic physics engine, allowing us to perform novel simulations on unseen geometries, boundaries, and dynamics without knowledge of the true physical parameters. We validate our model in three ways: (i) novel scene simulation with the learned visual-world physics, (ii) future prediction of the observed fluid dynamics, and (iii) supervised particle simulation. Our model demonstrates strong performance in all three tasks. | Xiangming Zhu, Huayu Deng, Haochen Yuan, Yunbo Wang, Xiaokang Yang |  |

However, LLM's responses may leak the sensitive private information contained in in-context exemplars. To address this challenge, we propose Differentially Private In-context Learning (DP-ICL), a general paradigm for privatizing ICL tasks. The key idea for DP-ICL paradigm is generating differentially private responses through a noisy consensus among an ensemble of LLM's responses based on disjoint exemplar sets. Based on the general paradigm of DP-ICL, we instantiate several techniques showing how to privatize ICL for text classification and language generation. We experiment on four text classification benchmarks and two language generation tasks, and our empirical findings suggest that our DP-ICL achieves a strong utility-privacy tradeoff. | Tong Wu, Ashwinee Panda, Jiachen T.

Recent TAS advancements have discovered outstanding transformer architectures while saving tremendous labor from human experts. However, it is still cumbersome to deploy these methods in real-world applications due to the expensive costs of data labeling under the supervised learning paradigm. To this end, this paper proposes a masked image modelling (MIM) based self-supervised neural architecture search method specifically designed for vision transformers, termed as MaskTAS, which completely avoids the expensive costs of data labeling inherited from supervised learning. Based on the one-shot NAS framework, MaskTAS requires to train various weight-sharing subnets, which can easily diverged without strong supervision in MIM-based self-supervised learning. For this issue, we design the search space of MaskTAS as a siamesed teacher-student architecture to distill knowledge from pre-trained networks, allowing for efficient training of the transformer supernet. To achieve self-supervised transformer architecture search, we further design a novel unsupervised evaluation metric for the evolutionary search algorithm, where each candidate of the student branch is rated by measuring its consistency with the larger teacher network. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the searched architectures can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets even without using manual labels. Moreover, the proposed MaskTAS can generalize well to various data domains and tasks by searching specialized transformer architectures in self-supervised manner. | Caixia Yan, Xiaojun Chang, Zhihui Li, Lina Yao, Minnan Luo, Qinghua Zheng |  |

In this work, we aim to alleviate the long-tailed problem of SGG by utilizing unannotated triplets. To this end, we introduce a \*\*S\*\*elf-\*\*T\*\*raining framework for \*\*SGG\*\* \*\*(ST-SGG)\*\* that assigns pseudo-labels for unannotated triplets based on which the SGG models are trained. While there has been significant progress in self-training for image recognition, designing a self-training framework for the SGG task is more challenging due to its inherent nature such as the semantic ambiguity and the long-tailed distribution of predicate classes. Hence, we propose a novel pseudo-labeling technique for SGG, called \*\*C\*\*lass-specific \*\*A\*\*daptive \*\*T\*\*hresholding with \*\*M\*\*omentum \*\*(CATM)\*\*, which is a model-agnostic framework that can be applied to any existing SGG models. Furthermore, we devise a graph structure learner (GSL) that is beneficial when adopting our proposed self-training framework to the state-of-the-art message-passing neural network (MPNN)-based SGG models. Our extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of ST-SGG on various SGG models, particularly in enhancing the performance on fine-grained predicate classes. | Kibum Kim, Kanghoon Yoon, Yeonjun In, Jinyoung Moon, Donghyun Kim, Chanyoung Park |  |

However, existing processing frameworks prioritize the generation of stimulation while disregarding the potential impact of restoration effects and fail to assess the quality of the generated stimulation properly. In this paper, we propose for the first time an end-to-end visual prosthesis framework (StimuSEE) that generates stimulation patterns with proper quality verification using V1 neuron spike patterns as supervision. StimuSEE consists of a retinal network to predict the stimulation pattern, a phosphene model, and a primary vision system network (PVS-net) to simulate the signal processing from the retina to the visual cortex and predict the firing rate of V1 neurons. Experimental results show that the predicted stimulation shares similar patterns to the original scenes, whose different stimulus amplitudes contribute to a similar firing rate with normal cells. Numerically, the predicted firing rate and the recorded response of normal neurons achieve a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.78. | Chuanqing Wang, Di Wu, Chaoming Fang, Jie Yang, Mohamad Sawan |  |

Knowledge graphs (KGs) have different entity and relation vocabularies that generally do not overlap. The key challenge of designing foundation models on KGs is to learn such transferable representations that enable inference on any graph with arbitrary entity and relation vocabularies. In this work, we make a step towards such foundation models and present ULTRA, an approach for learning universal and transferable graph representations. ULTRA builds relational representations as a function conditioned on their interactions. Such a conditioning strategy allows a pre-trained ULTRA model to inductively generalize to any unseen KG with any relation vocabulary and to be fine-tuned on any graph. Conducting link prediction experiments on 57 different KGs, we find that the zero-shot inductive inference performance of a single pre-trained ULTRA model on unseen graphs of various sizes is often on par or better than strong baselines trained on specific graphs. Fine-tuning further boosts the performance. | Mikhail Galkin, Xinyu Yuan, Hesham Mostafa, Jian Tang, Zhaocheng Zhu |  |

We extend this work by analyzing how well DNNs perform compared to humans when constrained by peripheral vision -- which limits human performance on a variety of tasks, but also benefits the visual system significantly. We evaluate this by (1) modifying the Texture Tiling Model (TTM), a well tested model of peripheral vision to be more flexibly used with DNNs, (2) generating a large dataset which we call COCO-Periph that contains images transformed to capture the information available in human peripheral vision, and (3) comparing DNNs to humans at peripheral object detection using a psychophysics experiment. Our results show that common DNNs underperform at object detection compared to humans when simulating peripheral vision with TTM. Training on COCO-Periph begins to reduce the gap between human and DNN performance and leads to small increases in corruption robustness, but DNNs still struggle to capture human-like sensitivity to peripheral clutter. Our work brings us closer to accurately modeling human vision, and paves the way for DNNs to mimic and sometimes benefit from properties of human visual processing. | Anne Harrington, Vasha DuTell, Mark Hamilton, Ayush Tewari, Simon Stent, William T.

While their practical power has now been widely recognized, the theoretical underpinnings remain far from mature. In this work, we develop a suite of non-asymptotic theory towards understanding the data generation process of diffusion models in discrete time, assuming access to $\ell_2$-accurate estimates of the (Stein) score functions. For a popular deterministic sampler (based on the probability flow ODE), we establish a convergence rate proportional to $1/T$ (with $T$ the total number of steps), improving upon past results; for another mainstream stochastic sampler (i.e., a type of the denoising diffusion probabilistic model), we derive a convergence rate proportional to $1/\sqrt{T}$, matching the state-of-the-art theory. Imposing only minimal assumptions on the target data distribution (e.g., no smoothness assumption is imposed), our results characterize how $\ell_2$ score estimation errors affect the quality of the data generation process. In contrast to prior works, our theory is developed based on an elementary yet versatile non-asymptotic approach without resorting to toolboxes for SDEs and ODEs. | Gen Li, Yuting Wei, Yuxin Chen, Yuejie Chi |  |

In this paper, we give theoretical backing to these empirical observations by showing that these three properties hold in random feature (RF) regression, a class of models equivalent to shallow networks with only the last layer trained. Concretely, we first show that the test risk of RF regression decreases monotonically with both the number of features and samples, provided the ridge penalty is tuned optimally. In particular, this implies that infinite width RF architectures are preferable to those of any finite width. We then proceed to demonstrate that, for a large class of tasks characterized by powerlaw eigenstructure, training to near-zero training loss is \*obligatory:\* near-optimal performance can \*only\* be achieved when the training error is much smaller than the test error. Grounding our theory in real-world data, we find empirically that standard computer vision tasks with convolutional neural kernels clearly fall into this class. Taken together, our results tell a simple, testable story of the benefits of overparameterization and overfitting in random feature models. | James B.

However, a significant limitation of such an approach is its dependency on high-quality human annotations, making its application to intricate tasks challenging due to difficulties in obtaining consistent response demonstrations and in-distribution response preferences. This paper presents a novel approach, namely SALMON, to align base language models with minimal human supervision, using only a small set of human-defined principles, yet achieving superior performance. Central to our approach is an instructable reward model. Trained on synthetic preference data, this model can generate reward scores based on arbitrary human-defined principles. By merely adjusting these principles during the RL training phase, we gain full control over the preferences with the instructable reward model, subsequently influencing the behavior of the RL-trained policy models, and reducing the reliance on the collection of online human preferences. Applying our method to the LLaMA-2-70b base language model, we developed an AI assistant named Dromedary-2. With only 6 exemplars for in-context learning and 31 human-defined principles, Dromedary-2 significantly surpasses the performance of several state-of-the-art AI systems, including LLaMA-2-Chat-70b, on various benchmark datasets. We have open-sourced the code and model weights to encourage further research into aligning LLM-based AI agents with enhanced supervision efficiency, improved controllability, and scalable oversight. | Zhiqing Sun, Yikang Shen, Hongxin Zhang, Qinhong Zhou, Zhenfang Chen, David Daniel Cox, Yiming Yang, Chuang Gan |  |

To avert the training burden, we propose a training-free ControlVideo to produce high-quality videos based on the provided text prompts and motion sequences. Specifically, ControlVideo adapts a pre-trained text-to-image model (i.e., ControlNet) for controllable text-to-video generation. To generate continuous videos without flicker effect, we propose an interleaved-frame smoother to smooth the intermediate frames. In particular, interleaved-frame smoother splits the whole videos with successive three-frame clips, and stabilizes each clip by updating the middle frame with the interpolation among other two frames in latent space. Furthermore, a fully cross-frame interaction mechanism have been exploited to further enhance the frame consistency, while a hierarchical sampler is employed to produce long videos efficiently. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ControlVideo outperforms the state-of-the-arts both quantitatively and qualitatively. It is worthy noting that, thanks to the efficient designs, ControlVideo could generate both short and long videos within several minutes using one NVIDIA 2080Ti.

Given the great success of pretrained models on diverse protein-related tasks and the fact that recovery is highly correlated with confidence, we wonder whether this knowledge can push the limits of protein design further. As a solution, we propose a knowledge-aware module that refines low-quality residues. We also introduce a memory-retrieval mechanism to save more than 50\% of the training time. We extensively evaluate our proposed method on the CATH, TS50, TS500, and PDB datasets and our results show that our KW-Design method outperforms the previous PiFold method by approximately 9\% on the CATH dataset. KW-Design is the first method that achieves 60+\% recovery on all these benchmarks. We also provide additional analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

The emergence of Foundation Models made it easier to obtain expert models for a given task, but the heterogeneity of data that may be encountered at test time often means that any single expert is insufficient. We consider the Fusion of Experts (FoE) problem of fusing outputs of expert models with complementary knowledge of the data distribution and formulate it as an instance of supervised learning. Our method is applicable to both discriminative and generative tasks and leads to significant performance improvements in image and text classification, text summarization, multiple-choice QA, and automatic evaluation of generated text. We also extend our method to the "frugal" setting where it is desired to reduce the number of expert model evaluations at test time. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/hwang595/FoE-ICLR2024. | Hongyi Wang, Felipe Maia Polo, Yuekai Sun, Souvik Kundu, Eric P. Xing, Mikhail Yurochkin |  |

Unfortunately, existing hypernetworks are often challenging to train. Training typically converges far more slowly than for non-hypernetwork models, and the rate of convergence can be very sensitive to hyperparameter choices. In this work, we identify a fundamental and previously unidentified problem that contributes to the challenge of training hypernetworks: a magnitude proportionality between the inputs and outputs of the hypernetwork. We demonstrate both analytically and empirically that this can lead to unstable optimization, thereby slowing down convergence, and sometimes even preventing any learning. We present a simple solution to this problem using a revised hypernetwork formulation that we call Magnitude Invariant Parametrizations (MIP). We demonstrate the proposed solution on several hypernetwork tasks, where it consistently stabilizes training and achieves faster convergence. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive ablation study including choices of activation function, normalization strategies, input dimensionality, and hypernetwork architecture; and find that MIP improves training in all scenarios. We provide easy-to-use code that can turn existing networks into MIP-based hypernetworks. | Jose Javier Gonzalez Ortiz, John V. Guttag, Adrian V. Dalca |  |

In this paper, we introduce a novel, versatile framework for causal discovery that accommodates the presence of causally-related hidden variables almost everywhere in the causal network (for instance, they can be effects of measured variables), based on rank information of covariance matrix over measured variables. We start by investigating the efficacy of rank in comparison to conditional independence and, theoretically, establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the identifiability of certain latent structural patterns. Furthermore, we develop a Rank-based Latent Causal Discovery algorithm, RLCD, that can efficiently locate hidden variables, determine their cardinalities, and discover the entire causal structure over both measured and hidden ones. We also show that, under certain graphical conditions, RLCD correctly identifies the Markov Equivalence Class of the whole latent causal graph asymptotically. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world personality data sets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in finite-sample cases. Our code will be publicly available. | Xinshuai Dong, Biwei Huang, Ignavier Ng, Xiangchen Song, Yujia Zheng, Songyao Jin, Roberto Legaspi, Peter Spirtes, Kun Zhang |  |

However, for complex programming tasks, generating the correct solution in one go becomes challenging, thus some prior works have designed program repair approaches to improve code generation performance. In this work, we propose self-debugging, which teaches a large language model to debug its predicted program. In particular, we demonstrate that self-debugging can teach the large language model to perform rubber duck debugging; i.e., without any human feedback on the code correctness or error messages, the model is able to identify its mistakes by leveraging code execution and explaining the generated code in natural language. Self-debugging achieves the state-of-the-art performance on several code generation benchmarks, including the Spider dataset for text-to-SQL generation, TransCoder for C++-to-Python translation, and MBPP for text-to-Python generation. On the Spider benchmark where there are no unit tests to verify the correctness of predictions, self-debugging with code explanation consistently improves the baseline by 2-3%, and improves the prediction accuracy on problems of the hardest level by 9%. On TransCoder and MBPP where unit tests are available, self-debugging improves the baseline accuracy by up to 12%. Meanwhile, by leveraging feedback messages and reusing failed predictions, self-debugging notably improves sample efficiency, and can match or outperform baseline models that generate more than 10$\times$ candidate programs. | Xinyun Chen, Maxwell Lin, Nathanael Schärli, Denny Zhou |  |

To address this gap, we propose Genie, a novel method for automatically generating high-quality content-grounded data. It consists of three stages: (a) Content Preparation, (b) Generation: creating task-specific examples from the content (e.g., question-answer pairs or summaries). (c) Filtering mechanism aiming to ensure the quality and faithfulness of the generated data. We showcase this methodology by generating three large-scale synthetic data, making wishes, for Long-Form Question-Answering (LFQA), summarization, and information extraction. In a human evaluation, our generated data was found to be natural and of high quality. Furthermore, we compare models trained on our data with models trained on human-written data -- ELI5 and ASQA for LFQA and CNN-DailyMail for Summarization. We show that our models are on par with or outperforming models trained on human-generated data and consistently outperforming them in faithfulness. Finally, we applied our method to create LFQA data within the medical domain and compared a model trained on it with models trained on other domains. | Asaf Yehudai, Boaz Carmeli, Yosi Mass, Ofir Arviv, Nathaniel Mills, Eyal Shnarch, Leshem Choshen |  |

Existing FL models share item embedding across clients while keeping the user embedding private and local on the client side. However, identical item embedding cannot capture users' individual differences in perceiving the same item and may lead to poor personalization. Moreover, dense item embedding in FL results in expensive communication costs and latency. To address these challenges, we propose Federated Recommendation withAdditive Personalization (FedRAP), which learns a global view of items via FL and a personalized view locally on each user. FedRAP encourages a sparse global view to save FL's communication cost and enforces the two views to be complementary via two regularizers. We propose an effective curriculum to learn the local and global views progressively with increasing regularization weights. To produce recommendations for a user, FedRAP adds the two views together to obtain a personalized item embedding. FedRAP achieves the best performance in FL setting on multiple benchmarks. It outperforms recent federated recommendation methods and several ablation study baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/mtics/FedRAP. | Zhiwei Li, Guodong Long, Tianyi Zhou |  |

One of its primary tasks is to provide reliable assurance of identifying these latent causal models, known as \textit{identifiability}. A recent breakthrough explores identifiability by leveraging the change of causal influences among latent causal variables across multiple environments \citep{liu2022identifying}. However, this progress rests on the assumption that the causal relationships among latent causal variables adhere strictly to linear Gaussian models. In this paper, we extend the scope of latent causal models to involve nonlinear causal relationships, represented by polynomial models, and general noise distributions conforming to the exponential family. Additionally, we investigate the necessity of imposing changes on all causal parameters and present partial identifiability results when part of them remains unchanged. Further, we propose a novel empirical estimation method, grounded in our theoretical finding, that enables learning consistent latent causal representations. Our experimental results, obtained from both synthetic and real-world data, validate our theoretical contributions concerning identifiability and consistency. | Yuhang Liu, Zhen Zhang, Dong Gong, Mingming Gong, Biwei Huang, Anton van den Hengel, Kun Zhang, Javen Qinfeng Shi |  |

However, this ability is hindered by distribution shifts between the training and testing data. Previous test time adaptation (TTA) methods for VLMs in zero-shot classification rely on minimizing the entropy of model outputs, tending to be stuck in incorrect model predictions. In this work, we propose TTA with feedback to rectify the model output and prevent the model from becoming blindly confident. Specifically, a CLIP model is adopted as the reward model during TTA and provides feedback for the VLM. Given a single test sample, the VLM is forced to maximize the CLIP reward between the input and sampled results from the VLM output distribution. The proposed \textit{reinforcement learning with CLIP feedback~(RLCF)} framework is highly flexible and universal. Beyond the classification task, with task-specific sampling strategies and a proper reward baseline choice, RLCF can be easily extended to not only discrimination tasks like retrieval but also generalization tasks like image captioning, improving the zero-shot generalization capacity of VLMs. According to the characteristics of these VL tasks, we build different fully TTA pipelines with RLCF to improve the zero-shot generalization ability of various VLMs. Extensive experiments along with promising empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of RLCF.

Businesses are interested in future trends, traders are interested in future stock prices, and companies are highly interested in future technological breakthroughs. While there are many automated systems for predicting future numerical data, such as weather, stock prices, and demand for products, there is relatively little work in automatically predicting textual data. Humans are interested in textual data predictions because it is a natural format for our consumption, and experts routinely make predictions in a textual format (Christensen et al., 2004; Tetlock & Gardner, 2015; Frick, 2015). However, there has been relatively little formalization of this general problem in the machine learning or natural language processing communities. To address this gap, we introduce the task of future language modeling: probabilistic modeling of texts in the future based on a temporal history of texts. To our knowledge, our work is the first work to formalize the task of predicting the future in this way. We show that it is indeed possible to build future language models that improve upon strong non-temporal language model baselines, opening the door to working on this important, and widely applicable problem. | Changmao Li, Jeffrey Flanigan |  |

The main challenge is how to distinguish high-quality pseudo labels against the confirmation bias. However, existing pseudo-label selection strategies are limited to pre-defined schemes or complex hand-crafted policies specially designed for classification, failing to achieve high-quality labels, fast convergence, and task versatility simultaneously. To these ends, we propose a Semi-supervised Reward framework (SemiReward) that predicts reward scores to evaluate and filter out high-quality pseudo labels, which is pluggable to mainstream SSL methods in wide task types and scenarios. To mitigate confirmation bias, SemiReward is trained online in two stages with a generator model and subsampling strategy. With classification and regression tasks on 13 standard SSL benchmarks across three modalities, extensive experiments verify that SemiReward achieves significant performance gains and faster convergence speeds upon Pseudo Label, FlexMatch, and Free/SoftMatch.

While vanilla PINNs require training one network per PDE configuration, recent works have showed the potential to meta-learn PINNs across a range of PDE configurations. It is however known that PINN training is associated with different levels of difficulty, depending on the underlying PDE configurations or the number of residual sampling points available. Existing meta-learning approaches, however, treat all PINN tasks equally. We address this gap by introducing a novel difficulty-aware task sampler (DATS) for meta-learning of PINNs. We derive an optimal analytical solution to optimize the probability for sampling individual PINN tasks in order to minimize their validation loss across tasks. We further present two alternative strategies to utilize this sampling probability to either adaptively weigh PINN tasks, or dynamically allocate optimal residual points across tasks. We evaluated DATS against uniform and self-paced task-sampling baselines on two representative meta-PINN models, across four benchmark PDEs as well as three different residual point sampling strategies. The results demonstrated that DATS was able to improve the accuracy of meta-learned PINN solutions when reducing performance disparity across PDE configurations, at only a fraction of residual sampling budgets required by its baselines. | Maryam Toloubidokhti, Yubo Ye, Ryan Missel, Xiajun Jiang, Nilesh Kumar, Ruby Shrestha, Linwei Wang |  |

Typically, it involves a hard whitening approach, transforming the embedding and applying loss to the whitened output. In this work, we introduce Spectral Transformation (ST), a framework to modulate the spectrum of embedding and to seek for functions beyond whitening that can avoid dimensional collapse. We show that whitening is a special instance of ST by definition, and our empirical investigations unveil other ST instances capable of preventing collapse. Additionally, we propose a novel ST instance named IterNorm with trace loss (INTL). Theoretical analysis confirms INTL's efficacy in preventing collapse and modulating the spectrum of embedding toward equal-eigenvalues during optimization. Our experiments on ImageNet classification and COCO object detection demonstrate INTL's potential in learning superior representations.

Count-based methods use the frequency of state visits to derive an exploration bonus. In this paper, we identify that any intrinsic reward function derived from count-based methods is non-stationary and hence induces a difficult objective to optimize for the agent. The key contribution of our work lies in transforming the original non-stationary rewards into stationary rewards through an augmented state representation. For this purpose, we introduce the Stationary Objectives For Exploration (SOFE) framework. SOFE requires \*identifying\* sufficient statistics for different exploration bonuses and finding an \*efficient\* encoding of these statistics to use as input to a deep network. SOFE is based on proposing state augmentations that expand the state space but hold the promise of simplifying the optimization of the agent's objective. Our experiments show that SOFE improves the agents' performance in challenging exploration problems, including sparse-reward tasks, pixel-based observations, 3D navigation, and procedurally generated environments. | Roger Creus Castanyer, Joshua Romoff, Glen Berseth |  |

The attention layer is the main bottleneck in scaling to longer sequences, as its runtime and memory increase quadratically in the sequence length. FlashAttention [5] exploits the asymmetric GPU memory hierarchy to bring significant memory saving (linear instead of quadratic) and runtime speedup (2-4× compared to optimized baselines), with no approximation. However, FlashAttention is still not nearly as fast as optimized matrix-multiply (GEMM) operations, reaching only 25-40% of the theoretical maximum FLOPs/s. We observe that the inefficiency is due to suboptimal work partitioning between different thread blocks and warps on the GPU, causing either low-occupancy or unnecessary shared memory reads/writes. We propose FlashAttention-2, with better work partitioning to address these issues. In particular, we (1) tweak the algorithm to reduce the number of non-matmul FLOPs (2) parallelize the attention computation, even for a single head, across different thread blocks to increase occupancy, and (3) within each thread block, distribute the work between warps to reduce communication through shared memory. These yield around 2× speedup compared to FlashAttention, reaching 50-73% of the theoretical maximum FLOPs/s on A100 and getting close to the efficiency of GEMM operations. We empirically validate that when used end-to-end to train GPT-style models, FlashAttention-2 reaches training speed of up to 225 TFLOPs/s per A100 GPU (72% model FLOPs utilization). | Tri Dao |  |

Dimensional collapse ––– also known as the "underfilling" phenomenon ––– is one of the major causes of degraded performance on downstream tasks. Previous work has investigated the dimensional collapse problem of SSL at a global level. In this paper, we demonstrate that representations can span over high dimensional space globally, but collapse locally. To address this, we propose a method called \*local dimensionality regularization (LDReg)\*. Our formulation is based on the derivation of the Fisher-Rao metric to compare and optimize local distance distributions at an asymptotically small radius for each data point. By increasing the local intrinsic dimensionality, we demonstrate through a range of experiments that LDReg improves the representation quality of SSL. The results also show that LDReg can regularize dimensionality at both local and global levels. | Hanxun Huang, Ricardo J. G. B. Campello, Sarah Monazam Erfani, Xingjun Ma, Michael E.

However, if these algorithms are trained solely to minimize training/test errors, they may inadvertently discriminate against individuals based on their sensitive attributes, such as gender, race or age. Recently, algorithms that ensure the fairness are developed in the machine learning community. Fairness criteria are applied by these algorithms to measure the fairness, but they often use the point estimate to assess the fairness and fail to consider the uncertainty of the sample fairness criterion once the algorithms are deployed. We suggest that assessing the fairness should take the uncertainty into account. In this paper, we use the covariance as a proxy for the fairness and develop the confidence region of the covariance vector using empirical likelihood \citep{Owen1988}. Our confidence region based fairness constraints for classification take uncertainty into consideration during fairness assessment. The proposed confidence region can be used to test the fairness and impose fairness constraint using the significant level as a tool to balance the accuracy and fairness. Simulation studies show that our method exactly covers the target Type I error rate and effectively balances the trade-off between accuracy and fairness. Finally, we conduct data analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. | Pangpang Liu, Yichuan Zhao |  |

Calibration measures quantify the degree of miscalibration, and reliability diagrams visualize the structure of this miscalibration. However, the most common constructions of reliability diagrams and calibration measures --- binning and ECE --- both suffer from well-known flaws (e.g. discontinuity). We show that a simple modification fixes both constructions: first smooth the observations using an RBF kernel, then compute the Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of this smoothed function. We prove that with a careful choice of bandwidth, this method yields a calibration measure that is well-behaved in the sense of (Blasiok, Gopalan, Hu, and Nakkiran 2023) --- a consistent calibration measure. We call this measure the SmoothECE. Moreover, the reliability diagram obtained from this smoothed function visually encodes the SmoothECE, just as binned reliability diagrams encode the BinnedECE. We also release a Python package with simple, hyperparameter-free methods for measuring and plotting calibration: "pip install relplot."

However, similar to proprietary language models, large text-to-video models are often black boxes whose weight parameters are not publicly available, posing a significant challenge to adapting these models to specific domains such as robotics, animation, and personalized stylization. Inspired by how a large language model can be prompted to perform new tasks without access to the model weights, we investigate how to adapt a black-box pretrained text-to-video model to a variety of downstream domains without weight access to the pretrained model. In answering this question, we propose \emph{\methodname}, which leverages the score function of a large pretrained video diffusion model as a probabilistic prior to guide the generation of a task-specific small video model. Our experiments show that, by incorporating broad knowledge and fidelity of the pretrained model probabilistically, a small model with as few as 1.25% parameters of the pretrained model can generate high-quality yet domain-specific videos for a variety of downstream domains such as animation, egocentric modeling, and modeling of simulated and real-world robotics data. As large text-to-video models starting to become available as a service similar to large language models, we advocate for private institutions to expose scores of video diffusion models as outputs in addition to generated videos to allow flexible adaptation of large pretrained text-to-video models by the general public. | Sherry Yang, Yilun Du, Bo Dai, Dale Schuurmans, Joshua B.

However, these regret bounds only apply to settings where a polynomial dependency on the size of transition model is allowed, such as tabular Markov Decision Process (MDP) and linear mixture MDP. We give the first horizon-free bound for the popular linear MDP setting where the size of the transition model can be exponentially large or even uncountable. In contrast to prior works which explicitly estimate the transition model and compute the inhomogeneous value functions at different time steps, we directly estimate the value functions and confidence sets. We obtain the horizon-free bound by: (1) maintaining multiple weighted least square estimators for the value functions; and (2) a structural lemma which shows the maximal total variation of the inhomogeneous value functions is bounded by a polynomial factor of the feature dimension. | Zihan Zhang, Jason D.

Many such approaches, however, lack formal guarantees establishing the precise relationship between the model and the extracted rules, and this lack of assurance becomes especially problematic when the extracted rules are applied in safety-critical contexts or to ensure compliance with legal requirements. Recent research has examined whether the rules derived from the influential Neural-LP model exhibit soundness (or completeness), which means that the results obtained by applying the model to any dataset always contain (or are contained in) the results obtained by applying the rules to the same dataset. In this paper, we extend this analysis to the context of DRUM, an approach that has demonstrated superior practical performance. After observing that the rules currently extracted from a DRUM model can be unsound and/or incomplete, we propose a novel algorithm where the output rules, expressed in an extension of Datalog, ensure both soundness and completeness. This algorithm, however, can be inefficient in practice and hence we propose additional constraints to DRUM models facilitating rule extraction, albeit at the expense of reduced expressive power. | Xiaxia Wang, David Jaime Tena Cucala, Bernardo Cuenca Grau, Ian Horrocks |  |

In this paper, we analyze the approximation and generalization of SGMs in learning a family of sub-Gaussian probability distributions. We introduce a measure of complexity for probability distributions in terms of their relative density with respect to the standard Gaussian measure. We prove that if the log-relative density can be locally approximated by a neural network whose parameters can be suitably bounded, then the distribution generated by empirical score matching approximates the target distribution in total variation with a dimension-independent rate. We illustrate our theory through examples, which include certain mixtures of Gaussians. An essential ingredient of our proof is to derive a dimension-free deep network approximation rate for the true score function associated to the forward process, which is interesting in its own right. | Frank Cole, Yulong Lu |  |
| 1606 |  |  [Scalable Diffusion for Materials Generation](https://openreview.net/forum?id=wm4WlHoXpC) |  | 0 | ​​​​Generative models trained on internet-scale data are capable of generating novel and realistic texts, images, and videos. A natural next question is whether these models can advance science, for example by generating novel stable materials. Traditionally, models with explicit structures (e.g., graphs) have been used in modeling structural relationships in scientific data (e.g., atoms and bonds in crystals), but generating structures can be difficult to scale to large and complex systems. Another challenge in generating materials is the mismatch between standard generative modeling metrics and downstream applications. For instance, common metrics such as the reconstruction error do not correlate well with the downstream goal of discovering novel stable materials. In this work, we tackle the scalability challenge by developing a unified crystal representation that can represent any crystal structure (UniMat), followed by training a diffusion probabilistic model on these UniMat representations. Our empirical results suggest that despite the lack of explicit structure modeling, UniMat can generate high fidelity crystal structures from larger and more complex chemical systems, outperforming previous graph-based approaches under various generative modeling metrics. To better connect the generation quality of materials to downstream applications, such as discovering novel stable materials, we propose additional metrics for evaluating generative models of materials, including per-composition formation energy and stability with respect to convex hulls through decomposition energy from Density Function Theory (DFT). Lastly, we show that conditional generation with UniMat can scale to previously established crystal datasets with up to millions of crystals structures, outperforming random structure search (the current leading method for structure discovery) in discovering new stable materials. | Sherry Yang, KwangHwan Cho, Amil Merchant, Pieter Abbeel, Dale Schuurmans, Igor Mordatch, Ekin Dogus Cubuk |  |
| 1607 |  |  [Towards Optimal Feature-Shaping Methods for Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://openreview.net/forum?id=dm8e7gsH0d) |  | 0 | Feature shaping refers to a family of methods that exhibit state-of-the-art performance for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. These approaches manipulate the feature representation, typically from the penultimate layer of a pre-trained deep learning model, so as to better differentiate between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples. However, existing feature-shaping methods usually employ rules manually designed for specific model architectures and OOD datasets, which consequently limit their generalization ability. To address this gap, we first formulate an abstract optimization framework for studying feature-shaping methods. We then propose a concrete reduction of the framework with a simple piecewise constant shaping function and show that existing feature-shaping methods approximate the optimal solution to the concrete optimization problem. Further, assuming that OOD data is inaccessible, we propose a formulation that yields a closed-form solution for the piecewise constant shaping function, utilizing solely the ID data. Through extensive experiments, we show that the feature-shaping function optimized by our method improves the generalization ability of OOD detection across a large variety of datasets and model architectures.

Assembly code programs, which demand low-level control over the computer machine state and have no variable names, are particularly difficult for humans to analyze. Existing conventional program translators guarantee correctness, but are hand-engineered for the source and target programming languages in question. Learned transpilation, i.e. automatic translation of code, offers an alternative to manual re-writing and engineering efforts. Automated symbolic program translation approaches guarantee correctness but struggle to scale to longer programs due to the exponentially large search space. Their rigid rule-based systems also limit their expressivity, so they can only reason about a reduced space of programs. Probabilistic neural language models (LMs) produce plausible outputs for every input, but do so at the cost of guaranteed correctness. In this work, we leverage the strengths of LMs and symbolic solvers in a neurosymbolic approach to learned transpilation for assembly code. Assembly code is an appropriate setting for a neurosymbolic approach, since assembly code can be divided into shorter non-branching basic blocks amenable to the use of symbolic methods. Guess & Sketch extracts alignment and confidence information from features of the LM then passes it to a symbolic solver to resolve semantic equivalence of the transpilation input and output. We test Guess & Sketch on three different test sets of assembly transpilation tasks, varying in difficulty, and show that it successfully transpiles 57.6% more examples than GPT-4 and 39.6% more examples than an engineered transpiler. We also share a training and evaluation dataset for this task. | Celine Lee, Abdulrahman Mahmoud, Michal Kurek, Simone Campanoni, David Brooks, Stephen Chong, GuYeon Wei, Alexander M. Rush |  |

In this paper, we propose Motif, a general method to interface such prior knowledge from a Large Language Model (LLM) with an agent. Motif is based on the idea of grounding LLMs for decision-making without requiring them to interact with the environment: it elicits preferences from an LLM over pairs of captions to construct an intrinsic reward, which is then used to train agents with reinforcement learning. We evaluate Motif's performance and behavior on the challenging, open-ended and procedurally-generated NetHack game. Surprisingly, by only learning to maximize its intrinsic reward, Motif achieves a higher game score than an algorithm directly trained to maximize the score itself. When combining Motif's intrinsic reward with the environment reward, our method significantly outperforms existing approaches and makes progress on tasks where no advancements have ever been made without demonstrations. Finally, we show that Motif mostly generates intuitive human-aligned behaviors which can be steered easily through prompt modifications, while scaling well with the LLM size and the amount of information given in the prompt. | Martin Klissarov, Pierluca D'Oro, Shagun Sodhani, Roberta Raileanu, PierreLuc Bacon, Pascal Vincent, Amy Zhang, Mikael Henaff |  |

We identify three issues in the state-of-the-art~\citep{dubey2020differentially}: (i) failure of claimed privacy protection, (ii) incorrect regret bound due to noise miscalculation and (iii) ungrounded communication cost. To resolve these issues, we take a two-step approach. First, we design an algorithmic framework consisting of a generic federated LCB algorithm and flexible privacy protocols. Then, leveraging the proposed framework, we study federated LCBs under two different privacy constraints. We first establish privacy and regret guarantees under silo-level local differential privacy, which fix the issues present in state-of-the-art algorithm. To further improve the regret performance, we next consider shuffle model of differential privacy, under which we show that our algorithm can achieve nearly \`\`optimal'' regret without a trusted server. We accomplish this via two different schemes -- one relies on a new result on privacy amplification via shuffling for DP mechanisms and another one leverages the integration of a shuffle protocol for vector sum into the tree-based mechanism, both of which might be of independent interest. Finally, we support our theoretical results with numerical evaluations over contextual bandit instances generated from both synthetic and real-life data. | Xingyu Zhou, Sayak Ray Chowdhury |  |

Unlike existing works that operate directly in pose space, we leverage the \textit{latent space} of pretrained autoencoders as a more expressive and robust representation for motion extraction and infusion. Building upon this, we present a novel \textit{generative} model that produces diverse stylization results of a single motion (latent) code. During training, a motion code is decomposed into two coding components: a deterministic content code, and a probabilistic style code adhering to a prior distribution; then a generator massages the random combination of content and style codes to reconstruct the corresponding motion codes. Our approach is versatile, allowing the learning of probabilistic style space from either style labeled or unlabeled motions, providing notable flexibility in stylization as well. In inference, users can opt to stylize a motion using style cues from a reference motion or a label. Even in the absence of explicit style input, our model facilitates novel re-stylization by sampling from the unconditional style prior distribution. Experimental results show that our proposed stylization models, despite their lightweight design, outperform the state-of-the-arts in style reeanactment, content preservation, and generalization across various applications and settings. | Chuan Guo, Yuxuan Mu, Xinxin Zuo, Peng Dai, Youliang Yan, Juwei Lu, Li Cheng |  |

Though many recent learning-based works have focused on large-scale combinatorial problems by guiding their decomposition into sequences of smaller subproblems, the combined spatiotemporal and time-restricted nature of MAPF poses a particular challenge for learning-based guidance of iterative approaches like large neighborhood search (LNS), which is already a state-of-the-art approach for MAPF even without learning. We address this challenge of neural-guided LNS for MAPF by designing an architecture which interleaves convolution and attention to efficiently represent MAPF subproblems, enabling practical guidance of LNS in benchmark settings. We demonstrate the speedup of our method over existing state-of-the-art LNS-based methods for MAPF as well as the robustness of our method to unseen settings. Our proposed method expands the horizon of effective deep learning-guided LNS methods into multi-path planning problems, and our proposed representation may be more broadly applicable for representing path-wise interactions. | Zhongxia Yan, Cathy Wu |  |

However, optimizing to make LLMs hallucinate less is challenging, as hallucination is hard to efficiently, cheaply, and reliably evaluate at each optimization step. In this work, we show that reducing hallucination on a _synthetic task_ can also reduce hallucination on real-world downstream tasks. Our method, SynTra, first designs a synthetic task where hallucinations are easy to elicit and measure. It next optimizes the LLM's system message via prefix tuning on the synthetic task, then uses the system message on realistic, hard-to-optimize tasks. Across three realistic abstractive summarization tasks, we reduce hallucination for two 13B-parameter LLMs using supervision signal from only a synthetic retrieval task. We also find that optimizing the system message rather than the model weights can be critical; fine-tuning the entire model on the synthetic task can counterintuitively _increase_ hallucination. Overall, SynTra demonstrates that the extra flexibility of working with synthetic data can help mitigate undesired behaviors in practice. | Erik Jones, Hamid Palangi, Clarisse Simões, Varun Chandrasekaran, Subhabrata Mukherjee, Arindam Mitra, Ahmed Hassan Awadallah, Ece Kamar |  |

However, the inherent open-ended nature of these tasks implies that there is always room for improvement in the quality of model responses. To address this challenge, various approaches have been proposed to enhance the performance of LLMs. There has been a growing focus on enabling LLMs to self-improve their response quality, thereby reducing the reliance on extensive human annotation efforts for collecting diverse and high-quality training data. Recently, prompting-based methods have been widely explored among self-improvement methods owing to their effectiveness, efficiency, and convenience. However, those methods usually require explicitly and thoroughly written rubrics as inputs to LLMs. It is expensive and challenging to manually derive and provide all necessary rubrics with a real-world complex goal for improvement (e.g., being more helpfulness and less harmful). To this end, we propose an imPlicit self-ImprovemenT (PIT) framework that implicitly learns the improvement goal from human preference data. PIT only requires preference data that are used to train reward models with no extra human efforts. Specifically, we reformulate the training objective of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) -- instead of maximizing response quality for a given input, we maximize the quality gap of the response conditioned on a reference response. In this way, PIT is implicitly trained with the improvement goal of better aligning with human preferences. Experiments on two real-world datasets and one synthetic dataset show that our method significantly outperforms prompting-based methods. | Ziqi Wang, Le Hou, Tianjian Lu, Yuexin Wu, Yunxuan Li, Hongkun Yu, Heng Ji |  |

In this paper, we explore parameter-efficient training techniques as an approach to training large neural networks. We introduce a novel method called ReLoRA, which utilizes low-rank updates to train high-rank networks. We apply ReLoRA to training transformer language models with up to 1.3B parameters and demonstrate comparable performance to regular neural network training. ReLoRA saves up to 5.5Gb of RAM per GPU and improves training speed by 9-40% depending on the model size and hardware setup. Our findings show the potential of parameter- efficient techniques for large-scale pre-training.

Generalizable policy learning in high-dimensional observation spaces is facilitated by well-designed state representations, which can surface important features of an environment and hide irrelevant ones. These state representations are typically manually specified, or derived from other labor-intensive labeling procedures. Our method, LGA (\textit{language-guided abstraction}), uses a combination of natural language supervision and background knowledge from language models (LMs) to automatically build state representations tailored to unseen tasks. In LGA, a user first provides a (possibly incomplete) description of a target task in natural language; next, a pre-trained LM translates this task description into a state abstraction function that masks out irrelevant features; finally, an imitation policy is trained using a small number of demonstrations and LGA-generated abstract states. Experiments on simulated robotic tasks show that LGA yields state abstractions similar to those designed by humans, but in a fraction of the time, and that these abstractions improve generalization and robustness in the presence of spurious correlations and ambiguous specifications. We illustrate the utility of the learned abstractions on mobile manipulation tasks with a Spot robot. | Andi Peng, Ilia Sucholutsky, Belinda Z. Li, Theodore R. Sumers, Thomas L.

Current studies consider leveraging both 2D and 3D molecular structures for representation learning. However, relying on straightforward alignment strategies that treat each modality separately, these methods fail to exploit the intrinsic correlation between 2D and 3D representations that reflect the underlying structural characteristics of molecules, and only perform coarse-grained molecule-level alignment. To derive fine-grained alignment and promote structural molecule understanding, we introduce an atomic-relation level "blend-then-predict" self-supervised learning approach, MoleBLEND, which first blends atom relations represented by different modalities into one unified relation matrix for joint encoding, then recovers modality-specific information for 2D and 3D structures individually. By treating atom relationships as anchors, MoleBLEND organically aligns and integrates visually dissimilar 2D and 3D modalities of the same molecule at fine-grained atomic level, painting a more comprehensive depiction of each molecule. Extensive experiments show that MoleBLEND achieves state-of-the-art performance across major 2D/3D molecular benchmarks. We further provide theoretical insights from the perspective of mutual-information maximization, demonstrating that our method unifies contrastive, generative (cross-modality prediction) and mask-then-predict (single-modality prediction) objectives into one single cohesive framework. | Qiying Yu, Yudi Zhang, Yuyan Ni, Shikun Feng, Yanyan Lan, Hao Zhou, Jingjing Liu |  |

While prior work has demonstrated the utility of incorporating augmented data directly into model-free RL updates, it is not well-understood when a particular DA strategy will improve data efficiency. In this paper, we seek to identify general aspects of DA responsible for observed learning improvements. Our study focuses on sparse-reward tasks with dynamics-invariant data augmentation functions, serving as an initial step towards a more general understanding of DA and its integration into RL training. Experimentally, we isolate three relevant aspects of DA: state-action coverage, reward density, and the number of augmented transitions generated per update (the augmented replay ratio). From our experiments, we draw two conclusions: (1) increasing state-action coverage often has a much greater impact on data efficiency than increasing reward density, and (2) decreasing the augmented replay ratio substantially improves data efficiency. In fact, certain tasks in our empirical study are solvable only when the replay ratio is sufficiently low. | Nicholas Corrado, Josiah P. Hanna |  |
| 1619 |  |  [JoMA: Demystifying Multilayer Transformers via Joint Dynamics of MLP and Attention](https://openreview.net/forum?id=LbJqRGNYCf) |  | 0 | We propose Joint MLP/Attention (JoMA) dynamics, a novel mathematical framework to understand the training procedure of multilayer Transformer architectures. This is achieved by integrating out the self-attention layer in Transformers, producing a modified dynamics of MLP layers only. JoMA removes unrealistic assumptions in previous analysis (e.g., lack of residual connection), and predicts that the attention first becomes sparse (to learn salient tokens), then dense (to learn less salient tokens) in the presence of nonlinear activations, while in the linear case, it is consistent with existing works. We leverage JoMA to qualitatively explains how tokens are combined to form hierarchies in multilayer Transformers, when the input tokens are generated by a latent hierarchical generative model. Experiments on models trained from real-world dataset (Wikitext2/Wikitext103) and various pre- trained models (OPT, Pythia) verify our theoretical findings.

However, while recent advancements in MTRL theory have focused on the improved statistical efficiency by assuming a shared structure across tasks, exploration--a crucial aspect of RL--has been largely overlooked. This paper addresses this gap by showing that when an agent is trained on a sufficiently diverse set of tasks, a generic policy-sharing algorithm with myopic exploration design like $\epsilon$-greedy that are inefficient in general can be sample-efficient for MTRL. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical demonstration of the "exploration benefits" of MTRL. It may also shed light on the enigmatic success of the wide applications of myopic exploration in practice. To validate the role of diversity, we conduct experiments on synthetic robotic control environments, where the diverse task set aligns with the task selection by automatic curriculum learning, which is empirically shown to improve sample-efficiency. | Ziping Xu, Zifan Xu, Runxuan Jiang, Peter Stone, Ambuj Tewari |  |

We study this challenge of interaction quantification in a semi-supervised setting with only labeled unimodal data and naturally co-occurring multimodal data (e.g., unlabeled images and captions, video and corresponding audio) but when labeling them is time-consuming. Using a precise information-theoretic definition of interactions, our key contribution is the derivation of lower and upper bounds to quantify the amount of multimodal interactions in this semi-supervised setting. We propose two lower bounds: one based on the shared information between modalities and the other based on disagreement between separately trained unimodal classifiers, and derive an upper bound through connections to approximate algorithms for min-entropy couplings. We validate these estimated bounds and show how they accurately track true interactions. Finally, we show how these theoretical results can be used to estimate multimodal model performance, guide data collection, and select appropriate multimodal models for various tasks. | Paul Pu Liang, Chun Kai Ling, Yun Cheng, Alexander Obolenskiy, Yudong Liu, Rohan Pandey, Alex Wilf, LouisPhilippe Morency, Russ Salakhutdinov |  |

Existing approaches perform k-NN search with cross-encoders by approximating the CE similarity with a vector embedding space fit either with dual-encoders (DE) or CUR matrix factorization. DE-based retrieve-and-rerank approaches suffer from poor recall as DE generalizes poorly to new domains and the test-time retrieval with DE is decoupled from the CE. While CUR-based approaches can be more accurate than the DE-based retrieve-and-rerank approach, such approaches require a prohibitively large number of CE calls to compute item embeddings, thus making it impractical for deployment at scale. In this paper, we address these shortcomings with our proposed sparse-matrix factorization based method that efficiently computes latent query and item representations to approximate CE scores and performs k-NN search with the approximate CE similarity. In an offline indexing stage, we compute item embeddings by factorizing a sparse matrix containing query-item CE scores for a set of train queries. Our method produces a high-quality approximation while requiring only a fraction of CE similarity calls as compared to CUR-based methods, and allows for leveraging DE models to initialize the embedding space while avoiding compute- and resource-intensive finetuning of DE via distillation. At test time, we keep item embeddings fixed and perform retrieval over multiple rounds, alternating between a) estimating the test query embedding by minimizing error in approximating CE scores of items retrieved thus far, and b) using the updated test query embedding for retrieving more items in the next round. Our proposed k-NN search method can achieve up to 5 and 54 improvement in k-NN recall for k=1 and 100 respectively over the widely-used DE-based retrieve-and-rerank approach. Furthermore, our proposed approach to index the items by aligning item embeddings with the CE achieves up to 100x and 5x speedup over CUR-based and dual-encoder distillation based approaches respectively while matching or improving k-NN search recall over baselines. | Nishant Yadav, Nicholas Monath, Manzil Zaheer, Rob Fergus, Andrew McCallum |  |

Correspondingly, significant resources are allocated towards research that aims to further advance this technology, typically resulting in models of increasing size that are trained on increasing amounts of data. This work, however, demonstrates the surprising result that it is often possible to significantly improve the performance of LLMs by selectively removing higher-order components of their weight matrices. This simple intervention, which we call LAyer-SElective Rank reduction (LASER), can be done on a model after training has completed, and requires minimal additional parameters and data. We show extensive experiments demonstrating the generality of this finding across language models and datasets, and provide in-depth analyses offering insights into both when LASER is effective and the mechanism by which it operates | Pratyusha Sharma, Jordan T.

However, the scalability of ZO optimization remains an open problem: Its use has primarily been limited to relatively small-scale ML problems, such as sample-wise adversarial attack generation. To our best knowledge, no prior work has demonstrated the effectiveness of ZO optimization in training deep neural networks (DNNs) without a significant decrease in performance. To overcome this roadblock, we develop DeepZero, a principled and practical ZO deep learning (DL) framework that can scale ZO optimization to DNN training from scratch through three primary innovations. First, we demonstrate the advantages of coordinate-wise gradient estimation (CGE) over randomized vector-wise gradient estimation in training accuracy and computational efficiency. Second, we propose a sparsity-induced ZO training protocol that extends the model pruning methodology using only finite differences to explore and exploit the sparse DL prior in CGE. Third, we develop the methods of feature reuse and forward parallelization to advance the practical implementations of ZO training. Our extensive experiments show that DeepZero achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy on ResNet-20 trained on CIFAR-10, approaching FO training performance for the first time. Furthermore, we show the practical utility of DeepZero in applications of certified adversarial defense and DL-based partial differential equation error correction, achieving 10-20% improvement over SOTA. We believe our results will inspire future research on scalable ZO optimization and contribute to advancing deep learning. | Aochuan Chen, Yimeng Zhang, Jinghan Jia, James Diffenderfer, Konstantinos Parasyris, Jiancheng Liu, Yihua Zhang, Zheng Zhang, Bhavya Kailkhura, Sijia Liu |  |

Recently, there have been attempts on extending the diffusion model for time series data. However, these extensions are fairly straightforward and do not utilize the unique properties of time series data. As different patterns are usually exhibited at multiple scales of a time series, we in this paper leverage this multi-resolution temporal structure and propose the multi-resolution diffusion model (mr-Diff). By using the seasonal-trend decomposition, we sequentially extract fine-to-coarse trends from the time series for forward diffusion. The denoising process then proceeds in an easy-to-hard non-autoregressive manner. The coarsest trend is generated first. Finer details are progressively added, using the predicted coarser trends as condition variables. Experimental results on nine real-world time series datasets demonstrate that mr-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art time series diffusion models. It is also better than or comparable across a wide variety of advanced time series prediction models. | Lifeng Shen, Weiyu Chen, James T. Kwok |  |

First, we reaffirm prior conclusions that CLIP can inadvertently absorb stereotypes. To counter this, we present a novel algorithm, called Multi-Modal Moment Matching (M4), designed to reduce both representation and association biases in multimodal data. We use M4 to conduct an in-depth analysis taking into account various factors, such as the model, representation, and data size. Our study also explores the dynamic nature of how CLIP learns/unlearns biases. In particular, we find that fine-tuning is effective in countering representation biases, though its impact diminishes for association biases. Also, data balancing has a mixed impact on quality: it tends to improve classification but can hurt retrieval. Interestingly, data and architectural improvements seem to mitigate the negative impact of data balancing on performance; e.g. applying M4 to SigLIP-B/16 with data quality filters improves COCO image-to-text retrieval @5 from 86% (without data balancing) to 87% and ImageNet 0-shot classification from 77% to 77.5%! Finally, we conclude with recommendations for improving the efficacy of data balancing in multimodal systems. | Ibrahim Alabdulmohsin, Xiao Wang, Andreas Peter Steiner, Priya Goyal, Alexander D'Amour, Xiaohua Zhai |  |

However, this is not certain because some sequential models, such as Conditional Random Field (CRF), are free from this problem. To address this issue, we develop a theoretical framework to mathematically formulate error propagation in the architecture of DMs, The framework contains three elements, including modular error, cumulative error, and propagation equation. The modular and cumulative errors are related by the equation, which interprets that DMs are indeed affected by error propagation. Our theoretical study also suggests that the cumulative error is closely related to the generation quality of DMs. Based on this finding, we apply the cumulative error as a regularization term to reduce error propagation. Because the term is computationally intractable, we derive its upper bound and design a bootstrap algorithm to efficiently estimate the bound for optimization. We have conducted extensive experiments on multiple image datasets, showing that our proposed regularization reduces error propagation, significantly improves vanilla DMs, and outperforms previous baselines. | Yangming Li, Mihaela van der Schaar |  |

A recent line of work has extended decision-time planning to imperfect-information games, leading to superhuman performance in poker. However, these methods involve solving subgames whose sizes grow quickly in the amount of non-public information, making them unhelpful when the amount of non-public information is large. Motivated by this issue, we introduce an alternative framework for decision-time planning that is not based on solving subgames, but rather on update equivalence. In this update-equivalence framework, decision-time planning algorithms replicate the updates of last-iterate algorithms, which need not rely on public information. This facilitates scalability to games with large amounts of non-public information. Using this framework, we derive a provably sound search algorithm for fully cooperative games based on mirror descent and a search algorithm for adversarial games based on magnetic mirror descent. We validate the performance of these algorithms in cooperative and adversarial domains, notably in Hanabi, the standard benchmark for search in fully cooperative imperfect-information games. Here, our mirror descent approach exceeds or matches the performance of public information-based search while using two orders of magnitude less search time. This is the first instance of a non-public-information-based algorithm outperforming public-information-based approaches in a domain they have historically dominated. | Samuel Sokota, Gabriele Farina, David J.

| 1629 |  |  [Soft Mixture Denoising: Beyond the Expressive Bottleneck of Diffusion Models](https://openreview.net/forum?id=aaBnFAyW9O) |  | 0 | Because diffusion models have shown impressive performances in a number of tasks, such as image synthesis, there is a trend in recent works to prove (with certain assumptions) that these models have strong approximation capabilities. In this paper, we show that current diffusion models actually have an expressive bottleneck in backward denoising and some assumption made by existing theoretical guarantees is too strong. Based on this finding, we prove that diffusion models have unbounded errors in both local and global denoising. In light of our theoretical studies, we introduce soft mixture denoising (SMD), an expressive and efficient model for backward denoising. SMD not only permits diffusion models to well approximate any Gaussian mixture distributions in theory, but also is simple and efficient for implementation. Our experiments on multiple image datasets show that SMD significantly improves different types of diffusion models (e.g., DDPM), espeically in the situation of few backward iterations. | Yangming Li, Boris van Breugel, Mihaela van der Schaar |  |

In this work, we study a new family of label DP training algorithms. Unlike most prior label DP algorithms that have been based on label randomization, our algorithm naturally leverages the power of the central model of DP. It interleaves gradient projection operations with private stochastic gradient descent steps in order to improve the utility of the trained model while guaranteeing the privacy of the labels. We show that such projection-based algorithms can be made practical and that they improve on the state-of-the art for label DP training in the high-privacy regime. We complement our empirical evaluation with theoretical results shedding light on the efficacy of our method through the lens of bias-variance trade-offs. | Badih Ghazi, Yangsibo Huang, Pritish Kamath, Ravi Kumar, Pasin Manurangsi, Chiyuan Zhang |  |

Recent research in the field also demonstrates its viability for several downstream tasks, henceforth leading to works that implement the contrastive principle through innovative loss functions and methods. However, despite achieving impressive progress, most methods depend on prohibitively large batch sizes and compute requirements for good performance. In this work, we propose the $\textbf{AUC}$-$\textbf{C}$ontrastive $\textbf{L}$earning, a new approach to contrastive learning that demonstrates robust and competitive performance in compute-limited regimes. We propose to incorporate the contrastive objective within the AUC-maximization framework, by noting that the AUC metric is maximized upon enhancing the probability of the network's binary prediction difference between positive and negative samples which inspires adequate embedding space arrangements in representation learning. Unlike standard contrastive methods, when performing stochastic optimization, our method maintains unbiased stochastic gradients and thus is more robust to batchsizes as opposed to standard stochastic optimization problems. Remarkably, our method with a batch size of 256, outperforms several state-of-the-art methods that may need much larger batch sizes (e.g., 4096), on ImageNet and other standard datasets. Experiments on transfer learning, few-shot learning, and other downstream tasks also demonstrate the viability of our method. | Rohan Sharma, Kaiyi Ji, Zhiqiang Xu, Changyou Chen |  |

This study investigates how even small transformers, trained from random initialization, can efficiently learn arithmetic operations such as addition, multiplication, and elementary functions like square root, using the next-token prediction objective. We first demonstrate that conventional training data is not the most effective for arithmetic learning, and simple formatting changes can significantly improve accuracy. This leads to sharp phase transitions as a function of training data scale, which, in some cases, can be explained through connections to low-rank matrix completion. Building on prior work, we then train on chain-of-thought style data that includes intermediate step results. Even in the complete absence of pretraining, this approach significantly and simultaneously improves accuracy, sample complexity, and convergence speed. We also study the interplay between arithmetic and text data during training and examine the effects of few-shot prompting, pretraining, and parameter scaling. Additionally, we discuss the challenges associated with length generalization. Our work highlights the importance of high-quality, instructive data that considers the particular characteristics of the next-word prediction loss for rapidly eliciting arithmetic capabilities. | Nayoung Lee, Kartik Sreenivasan, Jason D.

Compared with prior work, ReMasker is extremely simple -- besides the missing values (i.e., naturally masked), we randomly "re-mask" another set of values, optimize the autoencoder by reconstructing this re-masked set, and apply the trained model to predict the missing values; and yet highly effective -- with extensive evaluation on benchmark datasets, we show that ReMasker performs on par with or outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both imputation fidelity and utility under various missingness settings, while its performance advantage often increases with the ratio of missing data. We further explore theoretical justification for its effectiveness, showing that ReMasker tends to learn missingness-invariant representations of tabular data. Our findings indicate that masked modeling represents a promising direction for further research on tabular data imputation. The code is publicly available. | Tianyu Du, Luca Melis, Ting Wang |  |

Of particular relevance to these applications are methods targeting finite-sum structure, which generically arises in empirical variants of learning problems in these contexts. Further, methods with computable approximation errors are highly desirable, as they provide verifiable exit criteria. Motivated by these applications, we study finite-sum monotone inclusion problems, which model broad classes of equilibrium problems. Our main contributions are variants of the classical Halpern iteration that employ variance reduction to obtain improved complexity guarantees in which $n$ component operators in the finite sum are \`\`on average'' either cocoercive or Lipschitz continuous and monotone, with parameter $L$. The resulting oracle complexity of our methods, which provide guarantees for the last iterate and for a (computable) operator norm residual, is $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}( n + \sqrt{n}L\varepsilon^{-1})$, which improves upon existing methods by a factor up to $\sqrt{n}$. This constitutes the first variance reduction-type result for general finite-sum monotone inclusions and for more specific problems such as convex-concave optimization when operator norm residual is the optimality measure. We further argue that, up to poly-logarithmic factors, this complexity is unimprovable in the monotone Lipschitz setting; i.e., the provided result is near-optimal. | Xufeng Cai, Ahmet Alacaoglu, Jelena Diakonikolas |  |

Existing approaches are largely restricted to static settings, ignoring the continuity and emission of variations across time. In contrast, we propose a learning paradigm that directly establishes causation between events in the course of time. We present two key lemmas to compute causal contributions and frame them as reinforcement learning problems. Our approach offers formal and computational tools for uncovering and quantifying causal relationships in diffusion processes, subsuming various important settings such as discrete-time Markov decision processes. Finally, in fairly intricate experiments and through sheer learning, our framework reveals and quantifies causal links, which otherwise seem inexplicable. | Mehdi Fatemi, Sindhu C. M. Gowda |  |

In our work, we propose \*\*DrS\*\* (\*\*D\*\*ense \*\*r\*\*eward learning from \*\*S\*\*tages), a novel approach for learning \*reusable\* dense rewards for multi-stage tasks in a data-driven manner.

The learned rewards can be \*reused\* in unseen tasks, thus reducing the human effort for reward engineering. Extensive experiments on three physical robot manipulation task families with 1000+ task variants demonstrate that our learned rewards can be reused in unseen tasks, resulting in improved performance and sample efficiency of RL algorithms. The learned rewards even achieve comparable performance to human-engineered rewards on some tasks.

We propose a post-hoc method that makes existing classifiers selectively abstain from predicting certain samples. Our abstaining classifier is incentivized to maintain the original accuracy for each sub-population (i.e. no harm) while achieving a set of group fairness definitions to a user specified degree. To this end, we design an Integer Programming (IP) procedure that assigns abstention decisions for each training sample to satisfy a set of constraints. To generalize the abstaining decisions to test samples, we then train a surrogate model to learn the abstaining decisions based on the IP solutions in an end-to-end manner. We analyze the feasibility of the IP procedure to determine the possible abstention rate for different levels of unfairness tolerance and accuracy constraint for achieving no harm. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to identify the theoretical relationships between the constraint parameters and the required abstention rate. Our theoretical results are important since a high abstention rate is often infeasible in practice due to a lack of human resources. Our framework outperforms existing methods in terms of fairness disparity without sacrificing accuracy at similar abstention rates. | Tongxin Yin, JeanFrancois Ton, Ruocheng Guo, Yuanshun Yao, Mingyan Liu, Yang Liu |  |

While the inherent biases in common graph data are involved in GNN training, it poses a serious challenge to constraining the GNN output perturbations induced by input biases, thereby safeguarding fairness during training. The Lipschitz bound, a technique from robust statistics, can limit the maximum changes in the output concerning the input, taking into account associated irrelevant biased factors. It is an efficient and provable method to examine the output stability of machine learning models without incurring additional computational costs. Recently, its use in controlling the stability of Euclidean neural networks, the calculation of the precise Lipschitz bound remains elusive for non-Euclidean neural networks like GNNs, especially within fairness contexts. However, no existing research has investigated Lipschitz bounds to shed light on stabilizing the GNN outputs, especially when working on graph data with implicit biases. To narrow this gap, we begin with the general GNNs operating on relational data, and formulate a Lipschitz bound to limit the changes in the output regarding biases associated with the input. Additionally, we theoretically analyze how the Lipschitz bound of a GNN model could constrain the output perturbations induced by biases learned from data for fairness training. We experimentally validate the Lipschitz bound's effectiveness in limiting biases of the model output. Finally, from a training dynamics perspective, we demonstrate why the theoretical Lipschitz bound can effectively guide the GNN training to better trade-off between accuracy and fairness. | Yaning Jia, Chunhui Zhang, Soroush Vosoughi |  |
| 1639 |  |  [Listen, Think, and Understand](https://openreview.net/forum?id=nBZBPXdJlC) |  | 0 | The ability of artificial intelligence (AI) systems to perceive and comprehend audio signals is crucial for many applications. Although significant progress has been made in this area since the development of AudioSet, most existing models are designed to map audio inputs to pre-defined, discrete sound label sets. In contrast, humans possess the ability to not only classify sounds into general categories, but also to listen to the finer details of the sounds, explain the reason for the predictions, think about what the sound infers, and understand the scene and what action needs to be taken, if any. Such capabilities beyond perception are not yet present in existing audio models. On the other hand, modern large language models (LLMs) exhibit emerging reasoning ability but they lack audio perception capabilities. Therefore, we ask the question: can we build a model that has both audio perception and reasoning ability? In this paper, we propose a new audio foundation model, called LTU (Listen, Think, and Understand). To train LTU, we created a new OpenAQA-5M dataset consisting of 1.9 million closed-ended and 3.7 million open-ended, diverse (audio, question, answer) tuples, and have used an autoregressive training framework with a perception-to-understanding curriculum. LTU demonstrates strong performance and generalization ability on conventional audio tasks such as classification and captioning. More importantly, it exhibits emerging audio reasoning and comprehension abilities that are absent in existing audio models. To the best of our knowledge, LTU is the first multimodal large language model that focuses on general audio (rather than just speech) understanding. | Yuan Gong, Hongyin Luo, Alexander H.

Most existing methods for explaining GNNs typically rely on training auxiliary models, resulting in the explanations remain black-boxed. This paper introduces Graph Output Attribution (GOAt), a novel method to attribute graph outputs to input graph features, creating GNN explanations that are faithful, discriminative, as well as stable across similar samples. By expanding the GNN as a sum of scalar products involving node features, edge features and activation patterns, we propose an efficient analytical method to compute contribution of each node or edge feature to each scalar product and aggregate the contributions from all scalar products in the expansion form to derive the importance of each node and edge. Through extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data, we show that our method not only outperforms various state-of-the-art GNN explainers in terms of the commonly used fidelity metric, but also exhibits stronger discriminability, and stability by a remarkable margin. | Shengyao Lu, Keith G.

Its canonical version asks how to pack items of different values and weights arriving online into a capacity-limited knapsack so as to maximize the total value of the admitted items. Although optimal competitive algorithms are known for this problem, they may be fundamentally unfair, i.e., individual items may be treated inequitably in different ways. We formalize a practically-relevant notion of time fairness which effectively models a trade off between static and dynamic pricing in a motivating application such as cloud resource allocation, and show that existing algorithms perform poorly under this metric. We propose a parameterized deterministic algorithm where the parameter precisely captures the Pareto-optimal trade-off between fairness (static pricing) and competitiveness (dynamic pricing). We show that randomization is theoretically powerful enough to be simultaneously competitive and fair; however, it does not work well in experiments. To further improve the trade-off between fairness and competitiveness, we develop a nearly-optimal learning-augmented algorithm which is fair, consistent, and robust (competitive), showing substantial performance improvements in numerical experiments. | Adam Lechowicz, Rik Sengupta, Bo Sun, Shahin Kamali, Mohammad Hajiesmaili |  |

Recent studies have extended Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to manifolds, and concomitantly, normalization techniques have also been adapted to several manifolds, referred to as Riemannian normalization. Nonetheless, most of the existing Riemannian normalization methods have been derived in an ad hoc manner and only apply to specific manifolds. This paper establishes a unified framework for Riemannian Batch Normalization (RBN) techniques on Lie groups. Our framework offers the theoretical guarantee of controlling both the Riemannian mean and variance. Empirically, we focus on Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) manifolds, which possess three distinct types of Lie group structures. Using the deformation concept, we generalize the existing Lie groups on SPD manifolds into three families of parameterized Lie groups. Specific normalization layers induced by these Lie groups are then proposed for SPD neural networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through three sets of experiments: radar recognition, human action recognition, and electroencephalography (EEG) classification.

Existing prompt learning techniques replace hand-crafted text prompts with learned vectors that offer improvements on seen classes, but struggle to generalize to unseen classes. Our work addresses this challenge by proposing Federated Text-driven Prompt Generation (FedTPG), which learns a unified prompt generation network across multiple remote clients in a scalable manner. The prompt generation network is conditioned on task-related text input, thus is context-aware, making it suitable to generalize for both seen and unseen classes. Our comprehensive empirical evaluations on nine diverse image classification datasets show that our method is superior to existing federated prompt learning methods, achieving better overall generalization on both seen and unseen classes, as well as datasets. | Chen Qiu, Xingyu Li, Chaithanya Kumar Mummadi, Madan Ravi Ganesh, Zhenzhen Li, Lu Peng, WanYi Lin |  |
| 1644 |  |  [On the Hardness of Constrained Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=wFWuX1Fhtj) |  | 0 | Constrained cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is an emerging learning framework that has been widely applied to manage multi-agent systems, and many primal-dual type algorithms have been developed for it. However, the convergence of primal-dual algorithms crucially relies on strong duality -- a condition that has not been formally proved in constrained cooperative MARL. In this work, we prove that strong duality fails to hold in constrained cooperative MARL, by revealing a nonconvex quadratic type constraint on the occupation measure induced by the product policy. Consequently, our reanalysis of the primal-dual algorithm shows that its convergence rate is hindered by the nonzero duality gap. Then, we propose a decentralized primal approach for constrained cooperative MARL to avoid the duality gap, and our analysis shows that its convergence is hindered by another gap induced by the advantage functions. Moreover, we compare these two types of algorithms via concrete examples, and show that neither of them always outperforms the other one. Our study reveals that constrained cooperative MARL is generally a challenging and highly nonconvex problem, and its fundamental structure is very different from that of single-agent constrained RL. | Ziyi Chen, Yi Zhou, Heng Huang |  |

The proposed algorithms are theoretically analyzed first in the single-node and subsequently in the distributed settings. Our theoretical results reveal that the matrix stepsize in CGD can capture the objective’s structure and lead to faster convergence compared to a scalar stepsize. As a byproduct of our general results, we emphasize the importance of selecting the compression mechanism and the matrix stepsize in a layer-wise manner, taking advantage of model structure. Moreover, we provide theoretical guarantees for free compression, by designing specific layer-wise compressors for the non-convex matrix smooth objectives. Our findings are supported with empirical evidence. | Hanmin Li, Avetik G. Karagulyan, Peter Richtárik |  |
| 1646 |  |  [Causal-StoNet: Causal Inference for High-Dimensional Complex Data](https://openreview.net/forum?id=BtZ7vCt5QY) |  | 0 | With the advancement of data science, the collection of increasingly complex datasets has become commonplace. In such datasets, the data dimension can be extremely high, and the underlying data generation process can be unknown and highly nonlinear. As a result, the task of making causal inference with high-dimensional complex data has become a fundamental problem in many disciplines, such as medicine, econometrics, and social science. However, the existing methods for causal inference are frequently developed under the assumption that the data dimension is low or that the underlying data generation process is linear or approximately linear. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel stochastic deep learning approach for conducting causal inference with high-dimensional complex data. The proposed approach is based on some deep learning techniques, including sparse deep learning theory and stochastic neural networks, that have been developed in recent literature. By using these techniques, the proposed approach can address both the high dimensionality and unknown data generation process in a coherent way. Furthermore, the proposed approach can also be used when missing values are present in the datasets. Extensive numerical studies indicate that the proposed approach outperforms existing ones. | Yaxin Fang, Faming Liang |  |

Among the recent successes of imputation methods based on generative models, the information bottleneck (IB) framework offers a well-suited theoretical foundation for multiple imputations, allowing us to account for the uncertainty associated with the imputed values. However, directly applying the IB framework to time series data without considering their temporal context can lead to a substantial loss of temporal dependencies, which, in turn, can degrade the overall imputation performance. To address such a challenge, we propose a novel conditional information bottleneck (CIB) approach for time series imputation, which aims to mitigate the potentially negative consequences of the regularization constraint by focusing on reducing the redundant information conditioned on the temporal context. We provide a theoretical analysis of its effect by adapting variational decomposition. We use the resulting insight and propose a novel deep learning method that can approximately achieve the proposed CIB objective for time series imputation as a combination of evidence lower bound and novel temporal kernel-enhanced contrastive optimization. Our experiments, conducted on multiple real-world datasets, consistently demonstrate that our method significantly improves imputation performance (including both interpolation and extrapolation), and also enhances classification performance based on the imputed values. | MinGyu Choi, Changhee Lee |  |

Our work reassesses this assumption for neural networks with high-dimensional inputs. Rather than extrapolating in arbitrary ways, we observe that neural network predictions often tend towards a constant value as input data becomes increasingly OOD. Moreover, we find that this value often closely approximates the optimal constant solution (OCS), i.e., the prediction that minimizes the average loss over the training data without observing the input. We present results showing this phenomenon across 8 datasets with different distributional shifts (including CIFAR10-C and ImageNet-R, S), different loss functions (cross entropy, MSE, and Gaussian NLL), and different architectures (CNNs and transformers). Furthermore, we present an explanation for this behavior, which we first validate empirically and then study theoretically in a simplified setting involving deep homogeneous networks with ReLU activations. Finally, we show how one can leverage our insights in practice to enable risk-sensitive decision-making in the presence of OOD inputs. | Katie Kang, Amrith Setlur, Claire J.

RLCD creates preference pairs from two contrasting model outputs, one using a positive prompt designed to encourage following the given principles, and one using a negative prompt designed to encourage violating them. Using two different prompts causes model outputs to be more differentiated on average, resulting in cleaner preference labels in the absence of human annotations. We then use the preference pairs to train a preference model, which is in turn used to improve a base unaligned language model via reinforcement learning. Empirically, RLCD outperforms RLAIF (Bai et al., 2022b) and context distillation (Huang et al., 2022) baselines across three diverse alignment tasks—harmlessness, helpfulness, and story outline generation—and when using both 7B and 30B model scales for simulating preference data | Kevin Yang, Dan Klein, Asli Celikyilmaz, Nanyun Peng, Yuandong Tian |  |

A prominent instance of such a situation is Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), an approach recently employed to enhance the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) using human guidance [Ouyang et al. 2022, Liu et al. 2023, OpenAI et al. 2022, Bai et al. 2022]. We introduce ZO-RankSGD, an innovative zeroth-order optimization algorithm designed to tackle this optimization problem, accompanied by theoretical assurances. Our algorithm utilizes a novel rank-based random estimator to determine the descent direction and guarantees convergence to a stationary point. Moreover, ZO-RankSGD is readily applicable to policy optimization problems in Reinforcement Learning (RL), particularly when only ranking oracles for the episode reward are available. Last but not least, we demonstrate the effectiveness of ZO-RankSGD in a novel application: improving the quality of images generated by a diffusion generative model with human ranking feedback. Throughout experiments, we found that ZO-RankSGD can significantly enhance the detail of generated images with only a few rounds of human feedback. Overall, our work advances the field of zeroth-order optimization by addressing the problem of optimizing functions with only ranking feedback, and offers a new and effective approach for aligning Artificial Intelligence (AI) with human intentions. | Zhiwei Tang, Dmitry Rybin, TsungHui Chang |  |

The central insight behind Cosmos is the use of a novel form of neurosymbolic grounding. Specifically, the framework introduces two new tools: (i) neurosymbolic scene encodings, which represent each entity in a scene using a real vector computed using a neural encoder, as well as a vector of composable symbols describing attributes of the entity, and (ii) a neurosymbolic attention mechanism that binds these entities to learned rules of interaction. Cosmos is end-to-end differentiable; also, unlike traditional neurosymbolic methods that require representations to be manually mapped to symbols, it computes an entity's symbolic attributes using vision-language foundation models. Through an evaluation that considers two different forms of CompGen on an established blocks-pushing domain, we show that the framework establishes a new state-of-the-art for CompGen in world modeling.

One solution is to use a retriever that fetches relevant information to expand LLM's knowledge scope. However, existing textual-oriented retrieval-based LLMs are not ideal on structured table data due to diversified data modalities and large table sizes. In this work, we propose OpenTab, an open-domain table reasoning framework powered by LLMs. Overall, OpenTab leverages table retriever to fetch relevant tables and then generates SQL programs to parse the retrieved tables efficiently. Utilizing the intermediate data derived from the SQL executions, it conducts grounded inference to produce accurate response. Extensive experimental evaluation shows that OpenTab significantly outperforms baselines in both open- and closed-domain settings, achieving up to 21.5% higher accuracy. We further run ablation studies to validate the efficacy of our proposed designs of the system. | Kezhi Kong, Jiani Zhang, Zhengyuan Shen, Balasubramaniam Srinivasan, Chuan Lei, Christos Faloutsos, Huzefa Rangwala, George Karypis |  |

The goals of robustness and compactness may seem to be at odds, since robustness requires generalization across domains, while the process of compression exploits specificity in one domain. We introduce \textit{Adaptive Sharpness-Aware Pruning (AdaSAP)}, which unifies these goals through the lens of network sharpness. The AdaSAP method produces sparse networks that are robust to input variations which are \textit{unseen at training time}. We achieve this by strategically incorporating weight perturbations in order to optimize the loss landscape. This allows the model to be both primed for pruning and regularized for improved robustness. AdaSAP improves the robust accuracy of pruned models on image classification by up to +6\% on ImageNet C and +4\% on ImageNet V2, and on object detection by +4\% on a corrupted Pascal VOC dataset, over a wide range of compression ratios, pruning criteria, and network architectures, outperforming recent pruning art by large margins. | Anna Bair, Hongxu Yin, Maying Shen, Pavlo Molchanov, José M.

Stronger decoding methods, including Quality Estimation (QE) reranking and Minimum Bayes' Risk (MBR) decoding, have since been proposed to mitigate the model-perplexity-vs-quality mismatch. While these decoding methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, they are prohibitively expensive to compute. In this work, we propose MBR finetuning and QE finetuning, which distill the quality gains from these decoding methods at training time, while using an efficient decoding algorithm at inference time. Using the canonical NLG task of Neural Machine Translation (NMT), we show that even with self-training, these finetuning methods significantly outperform the base model. Moreover, when using an external LLM as a teacher model, these finetuning methods outperform finetuning on human-generated references. These findings suggest new ways to leverage monolingual data to achieve improvements in model quality that are on par with, or even exceed, improvements from human-curated data, while maintaining maximum efficiency during decoding. | Mara Finkelstein, Markus Freitag |  |

Current literature in FL mostly focuses on single-task learning. However, over time, new tasks may appear in the clients and the global model should learn these tasks without forgetting previous tasks. This real-world scenario is known as Continual Federated Learning (CFL). The main challenge of CFL is \textit{Global Catastrophic Forgetting}, which corresponds to the fact that when the global model is trained on new tasks, its performance on old tasks decreases. There have been a few recent works on CFL to propose methods that aim to address the global catastrophic forgetting problem. However, these works either have unrealistic assumptions on the availability of past data samples or violate the privacy principles of FL. We propose a novel method, Federated Orthogonal Training (FOT), to overcome these drawbacks and address the global catastrophic forgetting in CFL. Our algorithm extracts the global input subspace of each layer for old tasks and modifies the aggregated updates of new tasks such that they are orthogonal to the global principal subspace of old tasks for each layer. This decreases the interference between tasks, which is the main cause for forgetting. Our method is almost computation-free on the client side and has negligible communication cost. We empirically show that FOT outperforms state-of-the-art continual learning methods in the CFL setting, achieving an average accuracy gain of up to 15% with 27% lower forgetting while only incurring a minimal computation and communication cost.

Repeating this process creates an autophagous ("self-consuming") loop whose properties are poorly understood. We conduct a thorough analytical and empirical analysis using state-of-the-art generative image models of three families of autophagous loops that differ in how fixed or fresh real training data is available through the generations of training and whether the samples from previous-generation models have been biased to trade off data quality versus diversity. Our primary conclusion across all scenarios is that \*without enough fresh real data in each generation of an autophagous loop, future generative models are doomed to have their quality (precision) or diversity (recall) progressively decrease.\* We term this condition Model Autophagy Disorder (MAD), by analogy to mad cow disease, and show that appreciable MADness arises in just a few generations. | Sina Alemohammad, Josue CascoRodriguez, Lorenzo Luzi, Ahmed Imtiaz Humayun, Hossein Babaei, Daniel LeJeune, Ali Siahkoohi, Richard G.

However, the internal representations learned by these models remain an enigma. In this work, we present Conceptor, a novel method to interpret the internal representation of a textual concept by a diffusion model. This interpretation is obtained by decomposing the concept into a small set of human-interpretable textual elements. Applied over the state-of-the-art Stable Diffusion model, Conceptor reveals non-trivial structures in the representations of concepts. For example, we find surprising visual connections between concepts, that transcend their textual semantics. We additionally discover concepts that rely on mixtures of exemplars, biases, renowned artistic styles, or a simultaneous fusion of multiple meanings of the concept. Through a large battery of experiments, we demonstrate Conceptor's ability to provide meaningful, robust, and faithful decompositions for a wide variety of abstract, concrete, and complex textual concepts, while allowing to naturally connect each decomposition element to its corresponding visual impact on the generated images. | Hila Chefer, Oran Lang, Mor Geva, Volodymyr Polosukhin, Assaf Shocher, Michal Irani, Inbar Mosseri, Lior Wolf |  |

However, a key challenge in offline RL lies in effectively stitching portions of suboptimal trajectories from the static dataset while avoiding extrapolation errors arising due to a lack of support in the dataset. Existing approaches use conservative methods that are tricky to tune and struggle with multi-modal data or rely on noisy Monte Carlo return-to-go samples for reward conditioning. In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages the expressiveness of latent diffusion to model in-support trajectory sequences as compressed latent skills. This facilitates learning a Q-function while avoiding extrapolation error via batch-constraining. The latent space is also expressive and gracefully copes with multi-modal data. We show that the learned temporally-abstract latent space encodes richer task-specific information for offline RL tasks as compared to raw state-actions. This improves credit assignment and facilitates faster reward propagation during Q-learning. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the D4RL benchmarks, particularly excelling in long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks. | Siddarth Venkatraman, Shivesh Khaitan, Ravi Tej Akella, John M.

In particular, we examine an approach that is widely used in practice --- the alternating minimization framework. Jain, Netrapalli and Sanghavi showed that if $M$ has incoherent rows and columns, then alternating minimization provably recovers the matrix $M$ by observing a nearly linear in $n$ number of entries. While the sample complexity has been subsequently improved, alternating minimization steps are required to be computed exactly. This hinders the development of more efficient algorithms and fails to depict the practical implementation of alternating minimization, where the updates are usually performed approximately in favor of efficiency. In this paper, we take a major step towards a more efficient and error-robust alternating minimization framework. To this end, we develop an analytical framework for alternating minimization that can tolerate a moderate amount of errors caused by approximate updates. Moreover, our algorithm runs in time $\widetilde O(\|\Omega\| k)$, which is nearly linear in the time to verify the solution while preserving the sample complexity. This improves upon all prior known alternating minimization approaches which require $\widetilde O(\|\Omega\| k^2)$ time. | Yuzhou Gu, Zhao Song, Junze Yin, Lichen Zhang |  |

To tackle such limitations of existing NAS methods, we propose a paradigm shift from NAS to a novel conditional Neural Architecture Generation (NAG) framework based on diffusion models, dubbed DiffusionNAG. Specifically, we consider the neural architectures as directed graphs and propose a graph diffusion model for generating them. Moreover, with the guidance of parameterized predictors, DiffusionNAG can flexibly generate task-optimal architectures with the desired properties for diverse tasks, by sampling from a region that is more likely to satisfy the properties. This conditional NAG scheme is significantly more efficient than previous NAS schemes which sample the architectures and filter them using the property predictors. We validate the effectiveness of DiffusionNAG through extensive experiments in two predictor-based NAS scenarios: Transferable NAS and Bayesian Optimization (BO)-based NAS. DiffusionNAG achieves superior performance with speedups of up to 35$\times$ when compared to the baselines on Transferable NAS benchmarks. Furthermore, when integrated into a BO-based algorithm, DiffusionNAG outperforms existing BO-based NAS approaches, particularly in the large MobileNetV3 search space on the ImageNet 1K dataset.

This discrepancy has motivated the development of federated causal discovery (FCD) approaches. However, existing FCD methods may be limited by their potentially restrictive assumptions of identifiable functional causal models or homogeneous data distributions, narrowing their applicability in diverse scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel FCD method attempting to accommodate arbitrary causal models and heterogeneous data. We first utilize a surrogate variable corresponding to the client index to account for the data heterogeneity across different clients. We then develop a federated conditional independence test (FCIT) for causal skeleton discovery and establish a federated independent change principle (FICP) to determine causal directions. These approaches involve constructing summary statistics as a proxy of the raw data to protect data privacy. Owing to the nonparametric properties, FCIT and FICP make no assumption about particular functional forms, thereby facilitating the handling of arbitrary causal models. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets to show the efficacy of our method.

They trained transformers by treating genes as tokens and cells as sentences. However, three fundamental differences between single-cell data and natural language data are overlooked: (1) scRNA-seq data are presented as bag-of-genes instead of sequences of RNAs; (2) Cell-cell relations are more intricate and important than inter-sentence relations; and (3) The quantity of single-cell data is considerably inferior to text data, and they are very noisy. In light of these characteristics, we propose a new pre-trained model, $\textit{CellPLM}$, which takes cells as tokens and tissues as sentences. In addition, we leverage spatially-resolved transcriptomic data in pre-training to facilitate learning cell-cell relationships and introduce a Gaussian prior distribution as an additional inductive bias to overcome data limitations. $\textit{CellPLM}$ is the first single-cell pre-trained transformer that encodes cell-cell relations and it consistently outperforms existing pre-trained and non-pre-trained models in diverse downstream tasks, with 100 times higher inference speed on generating cell embeddings than previous pre-trained models. | Hongzhi Wen, Wenzhuo Tang, Xinnan Dai, Jiayuan Ding, Wei Jin, Yuying Xie, Jiliang Tang |  |

Recent advances with architectures have allowed for improved scaling along one or two of these axes, but are still computationally prohibitive to use. In this paper, we propose to address all three axes by leveraging Language to Control Diffusion models as a hierarchical planner conditioned on language (LCD). We effectively and efficiently scale diffusion models for planning in extended temporal, state, and task dimensions to tackle long horizon control problems conditioned on natural language instructions, as a step towards generalist agents. Comparing LCD with other state-of-the-art models on the CALVIN language benchmark finds that LCD outperforms other SOTA methods in multi-task success rates, whilst improving inference speed over other comparable diffusion models by 3.3x~15x. We show that LCD can successfully leverage the unique strength of diffusion models to produce coherent long range plans while addressing their weakness in generating low-level details and control. | Edwin Zhang, Yujie Lu, Shinda Huang, William Yang Wang, Amy Zhang |  |

The desirability of self-supervised representation learning stems from the expensive and laborious process of annotating 2D and 3D data. Although previous research has investigated pretraining methods for both LiDAR and camera-based 3D object detection, a unified pretraining framework for multimodal BEV perception is missing. In this study, we introduce CALICO, a novel framework that applies contrastive objectives to both LiDAR and camera backbones. Specifically, CALICO incorporates two stages: point-region contrast (PRC) and region-aware distillation (RAD). PRC better balances the region- and scene-level representation learning on the LiDAR modality and offers significant performance improvement compared to existing methods. RAD effectively achieves contrastive distillation on our self-trained teacher model. CALICO's efficacy is substantiated by extensive evaluations on 3D object detection and BEV map segmentation tasks, where it delivers significant performance improvements. Notably, CALICO outperforms the baseline method by 10.5\% and 8.6\% on NDS and mAP. Moreover, CALICO boosts the robustness of multimodal 3D object detection against adversarial attacks and corruption. Additionally, our framework can be tailored to different backbones and heads, positioning it as a promising approach for multimodal BEV perception. | Jiachen Sun, Haizhong Zheng, Qingzhao Zhang, Atul Prakash, Zhuoqing Mao, Chaowei Xiao |  |

Current works try to automatically optimize or design principles of hyperparameters, such that they can generalize to diverse unseen scenarios. However, most designs of principles or optimization methods are agnostic to the choice of network structures, and thus largely ignore the impact of neural architectures on hyperparameters. In this work, we precisely characterize the dependence of initializations and maximal learning rates on the network architecture, which includes the network depth, width, convolutional kernel size, and connectivity patterns. By pursuing every parameter to be maximally updated with the same mean squared change in pre-activations, we can generalize our initialization and learning rates across MLPs (multi-layer perception) and CNNs (convolutional neural network) with sophisticated graph topologies. We verify our principles with comprehensive experiments. More importantly, our strategy further sheds light on advancing current benchmarks for architecture design. A fair comparison of AutoML algorithms requires accurate network rankings. However, we demonstrate that network rankings can be easily changed by better training networks in benchmarks with our architecture-aware learning rates and initialization. | Wuyang Chen, Junru Wu, Zhangyang Wang, Boris Hanin |  |

In this paper, we propose a rigorous theoretical framework to quantify the effectiveness and robustness of LLM watermarks. We propose a robust and high-quality watermark method, Unigram-Watermark, by extending an existing approach with a simplified fixed grouping strategy. We prove that our watermark method enjoys guaranteed generation quality, correctness in watermark detection, and is robust against text editing and paraphrasing. Experiments on three varying LLMs and two datasets verify that our Unigram-Watermark achieves superior detection accuracy and comparable generation quality in perplexity, thus promoting the responsible use of LLMs. | Xuandong Zhao, Prabhanjan Vijendra Ananth, Lei Li, YuXiang Wang |  |

By utilizing empirically derived force fields, MC or MD simulations explore the conformational space through numerically evolving the system via Markov chain or Newtonian mechanics. However, the high-energy barrier of the force fields can hamper the exploration of both methods by the rare event, resulting in inadequately sampled ensemble without exhaustive running. Existing learning-based approaches perform direct sampling yet heavily rely on target-specific simulation data for training, which suffers from high data acquisition cost and poor generalizability. Inspired by simulated annealing, we propose Str2Str, a novel structure-to-structure translation framework capable of zero-shot conformation sampling with roto-translation equivariant property. Our method leverages an amortized denoising score matching objective trained on general crystal structures and has no reliance on simulation data during both training and inference. Experimental results across several benchmarking protein systems demonstrate that Str2Str outperforms previous state-of-the-art generative structure prediction models and can be orders of magnitude faster compared with long MD simulations. | Jiarui Lu, Bozitao Zhong, Zuobai Zhang, Jian Tang |  |
| 1669 |  |  [CCIL: Continuity-Based Data Augmentation for Corrective Imitation Learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=LQ6LQ8f4y8) |  | 0 | We present a new technique to enhance the robustness of imitation learning methods by generating corrective data to account for compounding error and disturbances. While existing methods rely on interactive expert labeling, additional offline datasets, or domain-specific invariances, our approach requires minimal additional assumptions beyond expert data. The key insight is to leverage local continuity in the environment dynamics. Our method first constructs a dynamics model from the expert demonstration, enforcing local Lipschitz continuity while skipping the discontinuous regions. In the locally continuous regions, this model allows us to generate corrective labels within the neighborhood of the demonstrations but beyond the actual set of states and actions in the dataset. Training on this augmented data enhances the agent's ability to recover from perturbations and deal with compounding error. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our generated labels through experiments in a variety of robotics domains that have distinct forms of continuity and discontinuity, including classic control, drone flying, high-dimensional navigation, locomotion, and tabletop manipulation. | Liyiming Ke, Yunchu Zhang, Abhay Deshpande, Siddhartha S.

For such imitation policies, errors away from the training samples are particularly critical. Even rare slip-ups in the policy action outputs can compound quickly over time, since they lead to unfamiliar future states where the policy is still more likely to err, eventually causing task failures. We revisit simple supervised "behavior cloning" for conveniently training the policy from nothing more than pre-recorded demonstrations, but carefully design the model class to counter the compounding error phenomenon. Our "memory-consistent neural network" (MCNN) outputs are hard-constrained to stay within clearly specified permissible regions anchored to prototypical "memory" training samples. We provide a guaranteed upper bound for the sub-optimality gap induced by MCNN policies. Using MCNNs on 10 imitation learning tasks, with MLP, Transformer, and Diffusion backbones, spanning dexterous robotic manipulation and driving, proprioceptive inputs and visual inputs, and varying sizes and types of demonstration data, we find large and consistent gains in performance, validating that MCNNs are better-suited than vanilla deep neural networks for imitation learning applications.
