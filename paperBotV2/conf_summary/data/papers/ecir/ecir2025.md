However, this “cascading” retrieve-and-rerank approach is limited by the bounded recall problem: relevant documents not retrieved initially are permanently excluded from the final ranking. Adaptive retrieval techniques address this problem, but do not work with listwise rerankers because they assume a document's score is computed independently from other documents. In this paper, we propose an adaptation of an existing adaptive retrieval method that supports the listwise setting and helps guide the retrieval process itself (thereby overcoming the bounded recall problem for LLM rerankers). Specifically, our proposed algorithm merges results both from the initial ranking and feedback documents provided by the most relevant documents seen up to that point. Through extensive experiments across diverse LLM rerankers, first stage retrievers, and feedback sources, we demonstrate that our method can improve nDCG@10 by up to 13.23 while keeping the total number of LLM inferences constant and overheads due to the adaptive process minimal. The work opens the door to leveraging LLM-based search in settings where the initial pool of results is limited, e.g., by legacy systems, or by the cost of deploying a semantic first-stage. | Mandeep Rathee, Sean MacAvaney, Avishek Anand |  |

| 9 |  |  [Counterfactual Query Rewriting to Use Historical Relevance Feedback](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-88714-7_11) |  | 0 | When a retrieval system receives a query it has encountered before, previous relevance feedback, such as clicks or explicit judgments can help to improve retrieval results. However, the content of a previously relevant document may have changed, or the document might not be available anymore. Despite this evolved corpus, we counterfactually use these previously relevant documents as relevance signals. In this paper we proposed approaches to rewrite user queries and compare them against a system that directly uses the previous qrels for the ranking. We expand queries with terms extracted from the previously relevant documents or derive so-called keyqueries that rank the previously relevant documents to the top of the current corpus. Our evaluation in the CLEF LongEval scenario shows that rewriting queries with historical relevance feedback improves the retrieval effectiveness and even outperforms computationally expensive transformer-based approaches. | Jüri Keller, Maik Fröbe, Gijs Hendriksen, Daria Alexander, Martin Potthast, Matthias Hagen, Philipp Schaer |  |

First, existing neural news recommenders, even when powered by multilingual language models (LMs), suffer substantial performance losses in zero-shot cross-lingual transfer (ZS-XLT). Second, the current paradigm of fine-tuning the backbone LM of a neural recommender on task-specific data is computationally expensive and infeasible in few-shot recommendation and cold-start setups, where data is scarce or completely unavailable. In this work, we propose a news-adapted sentence encoder (NaSE), domain-specialized from a pretrained massively multilingual sentence encoder (SE). To this end, we construct and leverage PolyNews and PolyNewsParallel, two multilingual news-specific corpora. With the news-adapted multilingual SE in place, we test the effectiveness of (i.e., question the need for) supervised fine-tuning for news recommendation, and propose a simple and strong baseline based on (i) frozen NaSE embeddings and (ii) late click-behavior fusion. We show that NaSE achieves state-of-the-art performance in ZS-XLT in true cold-start and few-shot news recommendation. | Andreea Iana, Fabian David Schmidt, Goran Glavas, Heiko Paulheim |  |

However, traditional KG-based recommendation methods face fundamental challenges: insufficient consideration of temporal information and poor performance in cold-start scenarios. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs) can be considered databases with a wealth of knowledge learned from the web data, and they have recently gained attention due to their potential application as recommendation systems. Although approaches that treat LLMs as recommendation systems can leverage LLMs' high recommendation literacy, their input token limitations make it impractical to consider the entire recommendation domain dataset and result in scalability issues. To address these challenges, we propose a LLM's Intuition-aware Knowledge graph Reasoning model (LIKR). Our main idea is to treat LLMs as reasoners that output intuitive exploration strategies for KGs. To integrate the knowledge of LLMs and KGs, we trained a recommendation agent through reinforcement learning using a reward function that integrates different recommendation strategies, including LLM's intuition and KG embeddings. By incorporating temporal awareness through prompt engineering and generating textual representations of user preferences from limited interactions, LIKR can improve recommendation performance in cold-start scenarios. Furthermore, LIKR can avoid scalability issues by using KGs to represent recommendation domain datasets and limiting the LLM's output to KG exploration strategies. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation methods in cold-start sequential recommendation scenarios. | Keigo Sakurai, Ren Togo, Takahiro Ogawa, Miki Haseyama |  |
| 15 |  |  [Embedding Cultural Diversity in Prototype-Based Recommender Systems](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-88708-6_2) |  | 0 | Popularity bias in recommender systems can increase cultural overrepresentation by favoring norms from dominant cultures and marginalizing underrepresented groups. This issue is critical for platforms offering cultural products, as they influence consumption patterns and human perceptions. In this work, we address popularity bias by identifying demographic biases within prototype-based matrix factorization methods. Using the country of origin as a proxy for cultural identity, we link this demographic attribute to popularity bias by refining the embedding space learning process. First, we propose filtering out irrelevant prototypes to improve representativity. Second, we introduce a regularization technique to enforce a uniform distribution of prototypes within the embedding space. Across four datasets, our results demonstrate a 27% reduction in the average rank of long-tail items and a 2% reduction in the average rank of items from underrepresented countries. Additionally, our model achieves a 2% improvement in HitRatio@10 compared to the state-of-the-art, highlighting that fairness is enhanced without compromising recommendation quality. Moreover, the distribution of prototypes leads to more inclusive explanations by better aligning items with diverse prototypes. | Armin Moradi, Nicola Neophytou, Florian Carichon, Golnoosh Farnadi |  |

Different from a standard retrieval task's objective of maximising the relevance of a set of top-ranked documents, a RAG system's objective is rather to maximise their total utility, where the utility of a document indicates whether including it as a part of the additional contextual information in an LLM prompt improves a downstream task. Existing studies investigate the role of the relevance of a RAG context for knowledge-intensive language tasks (KILT), where relevance essentially takes the form of answer containment. In contrast, in our work, relevance corresponds to that of topical overlap between a query and a document for an information seeking task. Specifically, we make use of an IR test collection to empirically investigate whether a RAG context comprised of topically relevant documents leads to improved downstream performance. Our experiments lead to the following findings: (a) there is a small positive correlation between relevance and utility; (b) this correlation decreases with increasing context sizes (higher values of k in k-shot); and (c) a more effective retrieval model generally leads to better downstream RAG performance. | Fangzheng Tian, Debasis Ganguly, Craig Macdonald |  |
| 17 |  |  [Improving the Reusability of Conversational Search Test Collections](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-88708-6_13) |  | 0 | Incomplete relevance judgments limit the reusability of test collections. When new systems are compared to previous systems that contributed to the pool, they often face a disadvantage. This is due to pockets of unjudged documents (called holes) in the test collection that the new systems return. The very nature of Conversational Search (CS) means that these holes are potentially larger and more problematic when evaluating systems. In this paper, we aim to extend CS test collections by employing Large Language Models (LLMs) to fill holes by leveraging existing judgments. We explore this problem using TREC iKAT 23 and TREC CAsT 22 collections, where information needs are highly dynamic and the responses are much more varied, leaving bigger holes to fill. Our experiments reveal that CS collections show a trend towards less reusability in deeper turns. Also, fine-tuning the Llama 3.1 model leads to high agreement with human assessors, while few-shot prompting the ChatGPT results in low agreement with humans. Consequently, filling the holes of a new system using ChatGPT leads to a higher change in the location of the new system. While regenerating the assessment pool with few-shot prompting the ChatGPT model and using it for evaluation achieves a high rank correlation with human-assessed pools. We show that filling the holes using few-shot training the Llama 3.1 model enables a fairer comparison between the new system and the systems contributed to the pool. Our hole-filling model based on few-shot training of the Llama 3.1 model can improve the reusability of test collections. | Zahra Abbasiantaeb, Chuan Meng, Leif Azzopardi, Mohammad Aliannejadi |  |

| 19 |  |  [Zero-Shot and Efficient Clarification Need Prediction in Conversational Search](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-88708-6_25) |  | 0 | Clarification need prediction (CNP) is a key task in conversational search, aiming to predict whether to ask a clarifying question or give an answer to the current user query. However, current research on CNP suffers from the issues of limited CNP training data and low efficiency. In this paper, we propose a zero-shot and efficient CNP framework (Zef-CNP), in which we first prompt large language models (LLMs) in a zero-shot manner to generate two sets of synthetic queries: ambiguous and specific (unambiguous) queries. We then use the generated queries to train efficient CNP models. Zef-CNP eliminates the need for human-annotated clarification-need labels during training and avoids the use of LLMs with high query latency at query time. To further improve the generation quality of synthetic queries, we devise a topic-, information-need-, and query-aware chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting strategy (TIQ-CoT). Moreover, we enhance TIQ-CoT with counterfactual query generation (CoQu), which guides LLMs first to generate a specific/ambiguous query and then sequentially generate its corresponding ambiguous/specific query. Experimental results show that Zef-CNP achieves superior CNP effectiveness and efficiency compared with zero- and few-shot LLM-based CNP predictors. | Lili Lu, Chuan Meng, Federico Ravenda, Mohammad Aliannejadi, Fabio Crestani |  |
| 20 |  |  [FAIR-QR: Enhancing Fairness-Aware Information Retrieval Through Query Refinement](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-88717-8_1) |  | 0 | Information retrieval systems such as open web search and recommendation systems are ubiquitous and significantly impact how people receive and consume online information. Previous research has shown the importance of fairness in information retrieval systems to combat the issue of echo chambers and mitigate the rich-get-richer effect. Therefore, various fairness-aware information retrieval methods have been proposed. Score-based fairness-aware information retrieval algorithms, focusing on statistical parity, are interpretable but could be mathematically infeasible and lack generalizability. In contrast, learning-to-rank-based fairness-aware information retrieval algorithms using fairness-aware loss functions demonstrate strong performance but lack interpretability. In this study, we proposed a novel and interpretable framework that recursively refines query keywords to retrieve documents from underrepresented groups and achieve group fairness. Retrieved documents using refined queries will be re-ranked to ensure relevance. Our method not only shows promising retrieval results regarding relevance and fairness but also preserves interpretability by showing refined keywords used at each iteration. | Fumian Chen, Hui Fang |  |

Poison-RAG manipulates item metadata, such as tags and descriptions, to influence recommendation outcomes. Using item metadata generated through a large language model (LLM) and embeddings derived via the OpenAI API, we explore the impact of adversarial poisoning attacks on provider-side, where attacks are designed to promote long-tail items and demote popular ones. Two attack strategies are proposed: local modifications, which personalize tags for each item using BERT embeddings, and global modifications, applying uniform tags across the dataset. Experiments conducted on the MovieLens dataset in a black-box setting reveal that local strategies improve manipulation effectiveness by up to 50%, while global strategies risk boosting already popular items. Results indicate that popular items are more susceptible to attacks, whereas long-tail items are harder to manipulate. Approximately 70% of items lack tags, presenting a cold-start challenge; data augmentation and synthesis are proposed as potential defense mechanisms to enhance RAG-based systems' resilience. The findings emphasize the need for robust metadata management to safeguard recommendation frameworks.

Our approach employs a user-centric pre-processing strategy aimed at exposing users to a wide array of content categories and topics. We personalize this strategy by selectively adding and removing a percentage of interactions from user profiles. This personalization ensures we remain closely aligned with user preferences while gradually introducing distribution shifts. Our pre-processing technique offers flexibility and can seamlessly integrate into any recommender architecture. We run extensive experiments on two publicly available data sets for news and book recommendations to evaluate our approach. We test various standard and neural network-based recommender system algorithms. Our results show that our approach generates diverse recommendations, ensuring users are exposed to a wider range of items. Furthermore, using pre-processed data for training leads to recommender systems achieving performance levels comparable to, and in some cases, better than those trained on original, unmodified data. Additionally, our approach promotes provider fairness by facilitating exposure to minority categories.

One such example is popularity bias, where mainstream users receive better recommendations than niche content viewers. To improve recommendation quality across diverse user groups, we explore three Distributionally Robust Optimization(DRO) methods: Group DRO, Streaming DRO, and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) DRO. While Group and Streaming DRO rely on group annotations and struggle with users belonging to multiple groups, CVaR does not require such annotations and can naturally handle overlapping groups. In experiments on two real-world datasets, we show that the DRO methods outperform standard training, with CVaR delivering the best results. Additionally, we find that Group and Streaming DRO are sensitive to the choice of group used for loss computation. Our contributions include (i) a novel application of CVaR to recommenders, (ii) showing that the DRO methods improve group metrics as well as overall performance, and (iii) demonstrating CVaR's effectiveness in the practical scenario of intersecting user groups. | Krishna Acharya, David Wardrope, Timos Korres, Aleksandr V.

Current state-of-the-art ANN libraries, although being performance-oriented, often lack modularity and ease of use. This translates into them not being fully suitable for easy prototyping and testing of research ideas, an important feature to enable. We address these limitations by introducing kANNolo, a novel research-oriented ANN library written in Rust and explicitly designed to combine usability with performance effectively. kANNolo is the first ANN library that supports dense and sparse vector representations made available on top of different similarity measures, e.g., euclidean distance and inner product. Moreover, it also supports vector quantization techniques, e.g., Product Quantization, on top of the indexing strategies implemented. These functionalities are managed through Rust traits, allowing shared behaviors to be handled abstractly. This abstraction ensures flexibility and facilitates an easy integration of new components. In this work, we detail the architecture of kANNolo and demonstrate that its flexibility does not compromise performance. The experimental analysis shows that kANNolo achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of speed-accuracy trade-off while allowing fast and easy prototyping, thus making kANNolo a valuable tool for advancing ANN research.

Most evaluations of LLMs focus on tasks such as single-choice question-answering or text classification. These tasks are not suitable for assessing open-ended question-answering capabilities, which are critical in domains where expertise is required, such as health, and where misleading or incorrect answers can have a significant impact on a user's health. Using human experts to evaluate the quality of LLM answers is generally considered the gold standard, but expert annotation is costly and slow. We present a method for evaluating LLM answers that uses ranking signals as a substitute for explicit relevance judgements. Our scoring method correlates with the preferences of human experts. We validate it by investigating the well-known fact that the quality of generated answers improves with the size of the model as well as with more sophisticated prompting strategies. | Sebastian Heineking, Jonas Probst, Daniel Steinbach, Martin Potthast, Harrisen Scells |  |

Their distributional idiosyncrasies, however, have long hindered their use in real-world retrieval systems. That changed with the recent development of approximate algorithms that leverage the distributional properties of sparse embeddings to speed up retrieval. Nonetheless, in much of the existing literature, evaluation has been limited to datasets with only a few million documents such as MSMARCO. It remains unclear how these systems behave on much larger datasets and what challenges lurk in larger scales. To bridge that gap, we investigate the behavior of state-of-the-art retrieval algorithms on massive datasets. We compare and contrast the recently-proposed Seismic and graph-based solutions adapted from dense retrieval. We extensively evaluate Splade embeddings of 138M passages from MsMarco-v2 and report indexing time and other efficiency and effectiveness metrics. | Sebastian Bruch, Franco Maria Nardini, Cosimo Rulli, Rossano Venturini, Leonardo Venuta |  |

This study presents the first investigation into the abilities of LLMs to comprehend EHRs for patient data extraction and retrieval. We conduct extensive experiments using the MIMICSQL dataset to explore the impact of the prompt structure, instruction, context, and demonstration, of two backbone LLMs, Llama2 and Meditron, based on task performance. Through quantitative and qualitative analyses, our findings show that optimal feature selection and serialization methods can enhance task performance by up to 26.79 learning setups with relevant example selection improve data extraction performance by 5.95 we believe would help the design of LLM-based models to support health search. | Jesús LovónMelgarejo, Martin Mouysset, Jo Oleiwan, José G.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to address this scaling issue and offer a viable alternative to humans for the bulk of annotation tasks. In this paper, we propose a framework for assessing the product search engines in a large-scale e-commerce setting, leveraging Multimodal LLMs for (i) generating tailored annotation guidelines for individual queries, and (ii) conducting the subsequent annotation task. Our method, validated through deployment on a large e-commerce platform, demonstrates comparable quality to human annotations, significantly reduces time and cost, facilitates rapid problem discovery, and provides an effective solution for production-level quality control at scale. | Kasra Hosseini, Thomas Kober, Josip Krapac, Roland Vollgraf, Weiwei Cheng, Ana PeleteiroRamallo |  |

These naturally change over time based on events in the world and the evolution of language. Neural retrieval models that were trained once on a fixed set of query-document pairs will quickly start misrepresenting newly-created content and queries, leading to less effective retrieval. Traditional statistical sparse retrieval can update collection statistics to reflect these changes in the use of language in documents and queries. In contrast, continued fine-tuning of the language model underlying neural retrieval approaches such as DPR and ColBERT creates incompatibility with previously-encoded documents. Re-encoding and re-indexing all previously-processed documents can be costly. In this work, we explore updating a neural dual encoder retrieval model without reprocessing past documents in the stream. We propose MURR, a model updating strategy with regularized replay, to ensure the model can still faithfully search existing documents without reprocessing, while continuing to update the model for the latest topics. In our simulated streaming environments, we show that fine-tuning models using MURR leads to more effective and more consistent retrieval results than other strategies as the stream of documents and queries progresses. | Eugene Yang, Nicola Tonellotto, Dawn J.

In many domains, the recommended baskets consist of both repeat items and explore items. Some state-of-the-art NBR methods are heavily biased to recommend repeat items so as to maximize utility. The evaluation and optimization of beyond-accuracy objectives for NBR, such as item fairness and diversity, has attracted increasing attention. How can such beyond-accuracy objectives be pursued in the presence of heavy repeat bias? We find that only optimizing diversity or item fairness without considering repeat bias may cause NBR algorithms to recommend more repeat items. To solve this problem, we propose a model-agnostic repeat-bias-aware optimization algorithm to post-process the recommended results obtained from NBR methods with the objective of mitigating repeat bias when optimizing diversity or item fairness. We consider multiple variations of our optimization algorithm to cater to multiple NBR methods. Experiments on three real-world grocery shopping datasets show that the proposed algorithms can effectively improve diversity and item fairness, and mitigate repeat bias at acceptable Recall loss. | Yuanna Liu, Ming Li, Mohammad Aliannejadi, Maarten de Rijke |  |

This has severely affected the survivability of many now-deemed vulnerable or endangered languages, such as Occitan and Sicilian. These languages often share some characteristics, such as elements of their grammar and lexicon, with other high-resource languages, e.g. French or Italian. They can be clustered into groups of language varieties with various degrees of mutual intelligibility. Current search systems are not usually trained on many of these low-resource varieties, leading search users to express their needs in a high-resource language instead. This problem is further complicated when most information content is expressed in a high-resource language, inhibiting even more retrieval in low-resource languages. We show that current search systems are not robust across language varieties, severely affecting retrieval effectiveness. Therefore, it would be desirable for these systems to leverage the capabilities of neural models to bridge the differences between these varieties. This can allow users to express their needs in their low-resource variety and retrieve the most relevant documents in a high-resource one. To address this, we propose fine-tuning neural rankers on pairs of language varieties, thereby exposing them to their linguistic similarities. We find that this approach improves the performance of the varieties upon which the models were directly trained, thereby regularising these models to generalise and perform better even on unseen language variety pairs. We also explore whether this approach can transfer across language families and observe mixed results that open doors for future research. | Andreas Chari, Sean MacAvaney, Iadh Ounis |  |

While fact-checking aims to combat this, manual fact-checking is cumbersome and not scalable. It is essential for automated fact-checking to be efficient for aiding in combating misinformation in real-time and at the source. Fact-checking pipelines primarily comprise a knowledge retrieval component which extracts relevant knowledge to fact-check a claim from large knowledge sources like Wikipedia and a verification component. The existing works primarily focus on the fact-verification part rather than evidence retrieval from large data collections, which often face scalability issues for practical applications such as live fact-checking. In this study, we address this gap by exploring various methods for indexing a succinct set of factual statements from large collections like Wikipedia to enhance the retrieval phase of the fact-checking pipeline. We also explore the impact of vector quantization to further improve the efficiency of pipelines that employ dense retrieval approaches for first-stage retrieval. We study the efficiency and effectiveness of the approaches on fact-checking datasets such as HoVer and WiCE, leveraging Wikipedia as the knowledge source. We also evaluate the real-world utility of the efficient retrieval approaches by fact-checking 2024 presidential debate and also open source the collection of claims with corresponding labels identified in the debate. Through a combination of indexed facts together with Dense retrieval and Index compression, we achieve up to a 10.0x speedup on CPUs and more than a 20.0x speedup on GPUs compared to the classical fact-checking pipelines over large collections. | Kevin Nanhekhan, Venktesh V, Erik Martin, Henrik Vatndal, Vinay Setty, Avishek Anand |  |

However, distilled models do not match the effectiveness of their teacher LLMs. We hypothesize that this effectiveness gap is due to the fact that previous work has not applied the best-suited methods for fine-tuning cross-encoders on manually labeled data (e.g., hard-negative sampling, deep sampling, and listwise loss functions). To close this gap, we create a new dataset, Rank-DistiLLM. Cross-encoders trained on Rank-DistiLLM achieve the effectiveness of LLMs while being up to 173 times faster and 24 times more memory efficient.

The typical fine-tuning process of cross-encoders as re-rankers requires large amounts of manually labelled data, a contrastive learning objective, and a set of heuristically sampled negatives. An alternative recent approach for fine-tuning instead involves teaching the model to mimic the rankings of a highly effective large language model using a distillation objective. These fine-tuning strategies can be applied either individually, or in sequence. In this work, we systematically investigate the effectiveness of point-wise cross-encoders when fine-tuned independently in a single stage, or sequentially in two stages. Our experiments show that the effectiveness of point-wise cross-encoders fine-tuned using contrastive learning is indeed on par with that of models fine-tuned with multi-stage approaches.

In this tutorial, we inform the audience of studies that have systematically reported the presence of stereotypical gender biases in Information Retrieval (IR) systems and different pre-trained Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. We further classify existing work on gender biases in IR systems and NLP models as being related to (1) relevance judgement datasets, (2) structure of retrieval methods, (3) representations learnt for queries and documents, (4) and pre-trained embedding models. Based on the aforementioned categories, we present a host of methods from the literature that can be leveraged to measure, control, or mitigate the existence of stereotypical biases within IR systems and different NLP models that are used for down-stream tasks. Besides, we introduce available datasets and collections that are widely used for studying the existence of gender biases in IR systems and NLP models, the evaluation metrics that can be used for measuring the level of bias and utility of the models, and de-biasing methods that can be leveraged to mitigate gender biases within those models. | Shirin Seyedsalehi | Univ Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada; Toronto Metropolitan Univ, Toronto, ON, Canada |

Pairwise and listwise models allow passage interactions, which typically makes them more effective than pointwise models but less efficient and less robust to input passage order permutations. To enable efficient permutation-invariant passage interactions during re-ranking, we propose a new cross-encoder architecture with inter-passage attention: the Set-Encoder. In experiments on TREC Deep Learning and TIREx, the Set-Encoder is as effective as state-of-the-art listwise models while being more efficient and invariant to input passage order permutations. Compared to pointwise models, the Set-Encoder is particularly more effective when considering inter-passage information, such as novelty, and retains its advantageous properties compared to other listwise models.

Several zero-shot ranking methods based on LLMshave recently been proposed. Among many aspects, methods differ across (1) theranking algorithm they implement, e.g., pointwise vs. listwise, (2) thebackbone LLMs used, e.g., GPT3.5 vs. FLAN-T5, (3) the components and wordingused in prompts, e.g., the use or not of role-definition (role-playing) and theactual words used to express this. It is currently unclear whether performancedifferences are due to the underlying ranking algorithm, or because of spuriousfactors such as better choice of words used in prompts. This confusion risks toundermine future research. Through our large-scale experimentation andanalysis, we find that ranking algorithms do contribute to differences betweenmethods for zero-shot LLM ranking. However, so do the LLM backbones – but evenmore importantly, the choice of prompt components and wordings affect theranking. In fact, in our experiments, we find that, at times, these latterelements have more impact on the ranker's effectiveness than the actual rankingalgorithms, and that differences among ranking methods become more blurred whenprompt variations are considered. | Shuoqi Sun, Shengyao Zhuang, Shuai Wang, Guido Zuccon |  |

However, current works in this direction all depend on the GPT models, making it a single point of failure in scientific reproducibility. Moreover, it raises the concern that the current research findings only hold for GPT models but not LLM in general. In this work, we lift this pre-condition and build for the first time effective listwise rerankers without any form of dependency on GPT. Our passage retrieval experiments show that our best list se reranker surpasses the listwise rerankers based on GPT-3.5 by 13% and achieves 97% effectiveness of the ones built on GPT-4. Our results also show that the existing training datasets, which were expressly constructed for pointwise ranking, are insufficient for building such listwise rerankers. Instead, high-quality listwise ranking data is required and crucial, calling for further work on building human-annotated listwise data resources. | Crystina Zhang, Sebastian Hofstätter, Patrick Lewis, Raphael Tang, Jimmy Lin | University of Waterloo |

Or maybe you fiddled around with Google AI Overviews? These might sound familiar because the modern-day search stack has recently evolved to include retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. They allow searching and incorporating real-time data into large language models (LLMs) to provide a well-informed, attributed, concise summary in contrast to the traditional search paradigm that relies on displaying a ranked list of documents. Therefore, given these recent advancements, it is crucial to have an arena to build, test, visualize, and systematically evaluate RAG-based search systems. With this in mind, we propose the TREC 2024 RAG Track to foster innovation in evaluating RAG systems. In our work, we lay out the steps we've made towards making this track a reality – we describe the details of our reusable framework, Ragnarök, explain the curation of the new MS MARCO V2.1 collection choice, release the development topics for the track, and standardize the I/O definitions which assist the end user. Next, using Ragnarök, we identify and provide key industrial baselines such as OpenAI's GPT-4o or Cohere's Command R+. Further, we introduce a web-based user interface for an interactive arena allowing benchmarking pairwise RAG systems by crowdsourcing. We open-source our Ragnarök framework and baselines to achieve a unified standard for future RAG systems. | Ronak Pradeep, Nandan Thakur, Sahel Sharifymoghaddam, Eric Zhang, Ryan Nguyen, Daniel Campos, Nick Craswell, Jimmy Lin |  |

However, these methods often struggle with domain-specific entities and long-tail concepts absent from their training data, particularly in identifying specific individuals. In this paper, we explore the task of identity-aware cross-modal retrieval, which aims to retrieve images of persons in specific contexts based on natural language queries. This task is critical in various scenarios, such as for searching and browsing personalized video collections or large audio-visual archives maintained by national broadcasters. We introduce a novel dataset, COCO Person FaceSwap (COCO-PFS), derived from the widely used COCO dataset and enriched with deepfake-generated faces from VGGFace2. This dataset addresses the lack of large-scale datasets needed for training and evaluating models for this task. Our experiments assess the performance of different CLIP variations repurposed for this task, including our architecture, Identity-aware CLIP (Id-CLIP), which achieves competitive retrieval performance through targeted fine-tuning. Our contributions lay the groundwork for more robust cross-modal retrieval systems capable of recognizing long-tail identities and contextual nuances.

CLASP leverages the synergy between spoken content and textual data. During training, we utilize our newly introduced speech-text dataset, which encompasses 15 diverse categories ranging from fiction to religion. CLASP's audio component integrates audio spectrograms with a pre-trained self-supervised speech model, while its language encoding counterpart employs a sentence encoder pre-trained on over 100 languages. This unified lightweight model bridges the gap between various modalities and languages, enhancing its effectiveness in handling and retrieving multilingual and multimodal data. Our evaluations across multiple languages demonstrate that CLASP establishes new benchmarks in HITS@1, MRR, and meanR metrics, outperforming traditional ASR-based retrieval approaches in specific scenarios. | Mohammad Mahdi Abootorabi, Ehsaneddin Asgari |  |

Recently, this method has been further applied to attack retrieval systems by generating malicious passages that are injected into a corpus, i.e., corpus poisoning. However, HotFlip is known to be computationally inefficient, with the majority of time being spent on gradient accumulation for each query-passage pair during the adversarial token generation phase, making it impossible to generate an adequate number of adversarial passages in a reasonable amount of time. Moreover, the attack method itself assumes access to a set of user queries, a strong assumption that does not correspond to how real-world adversarial attacks are usually performed. In this paper, we first significantly boost the efficiency of HotFlip, reducing the adversarial generation process from 4 hours per document to only 15 minutes, using the same hardware. We further contribute experiments and analysis on two additional tasks: (1) transfer-based black-box attacks, and (2) query-agnostic attacks. Whenever possible, we provide comparisons between the original method and our improved version. Our experiments demonstrate that HotFlip can effectively attack a variety of dense retrievers, with an observed trend that its attack performance diminishes against more advanced and recent methods. Interestingly, we observe that while HotFlip performs poorly in a black-box setting, indicating limited capacity for generalization, in query-agnostic scenarios its performance is correlated to the volume of injected adversarial passages. | Yongkang Li, Panagiotis Eustratiadis, Evangelos Kanoulas |  |

It requires handling longer contexts, often resulting in higher query latency and increased computational overhead. Recently, Learned Sparse Retrieval (LSR) has emerged as a promising approach to address these challenges. Some have proposed adapting the LSR approach to longer documents by aggregating segmented document using different post-hoc methods, including n-grams and proximity scores, adjusting representations, and learning to ensemble all signals. In this study, we aim to reproduce and examine the mechanisms of adapting LSR for long documents. Our reproducibility experiments confirmed the importance of specific segments, with the first segment consistently dominating document retrieval performance. Furthermore, We re-evaluate recently proposed methods – ExactSDM and SoftSDM – across varying document lengths, from short (up to 2 segments) to longer (3+ segments). We also designed multiple analyses to probe the reproduced methods and shed light on the impact of global information on adapting LSR to longer contexts.

This has been achieved by making the representation of individual features more distinctly separated, so that it is easier to attribute the contribution of features to the model's predictions. However, such advantages in interpretability and feature attribution have mainly been explored qualitatively. Moreover, the effect of disentanglement on the model's recommendation performance has been largely overlooked. In this work, we reproduce the recommendation performance, representation disentanglement and representation interpretability of five well-known recommendation models on four RS datasets. We quantify disentanglement and investigate the link of disentanglement with recommendation effectiveness and representation interpretability. While several existing work in RSs have proposed disentangled representations as a gateway to improved effectiveness and interpretability, our findings show that disentanglement is not necessarily related to effectiveness but is closely related to representation interpretability.

As early as 2009, Hauff et al. [28] explored whether different QPP methods may be combined to improve prediction quality. Since then, significant research has been done both on QPP approaches, as well as their evaluation. This study revisits Hauff et al.s work to assess the reproducibility of their findings in the light of new prediction methods, evaluation metrics, and datasets. We expand the scope of the earlier investigation by: (i) considering post-retrieval methods, including supervised neural techniques (only pre-retrieval techniques were studied in [28]); (ii) using sMARE for evaluation, in addition to the traditional correlation coefficients and RMSE; and (iii) experimenting with additional datasets (Clueweb09B and TREC DL). Our results largely support previous claims, but we also present several interesting findings. We interpret these findings by taking a more nuanced look at the correlation between QPP methods, examining whether they capture diverse information or rely on overlapping factors. | Sourav Saha, Suchana Datta, Dwaipayan Roy, Mandar Mitra, Derek Greene |  |

Most studies suggest that (i) news RSs achieve better performance with larger pre-trained language models (PLMs) than shallow language models (SLMs), and (ii) that large language models (LLMs) outperform PLMs. However, other studies indicate that PLMs sometimes lead to worse performance than SLMs. Thus, it remains unclear whether using larger LMs consistently improves the performance of news RSs. In this paper, we revisit, unify, and extend these comparisons of the effectiveness of LMs in news RSs using the real-world MIND dataset. We find that (i) larger LMs do not necessarily translate to better performance in news RSs, and (ii) they require stricter fine-tuning hyperparameter selection and greater computational resources to achieve optimal recommendation performance than smaller LMs. On the positive side, our experiments show that larger LMs lead to better recommendation performance for cold-start users: they alleviate dependency on extensive user interaction history and make recommendations more reliant on the news content. | Yuyue Zhao, Jin Huang, David Vos, Maarten de Rijke |  |

The visual complexity of web pages is known to influence search behavior, with previous work suggesting that searchers make evaluative judgments within the first second on a page. However, there is a significant gap in our understanding of how visual complexity impacts searches specifically conducted with a learning intent. This gap is particularly relevant for the development of optimized information retrieval (IR) systems that effectively support educational objectives. To address this research need, we model visual complexity and aesthetics via a diverse set of features, investigating their relationship with search behavior during learning-oriented web sessions. Our study utilizes a publicly available dataset from a lab study where participants learned about thunderstorm formation. Our findings reveal that while content relevance is the most significant predictor for knowledge gain, sessions with less visually complex pages are associated with higher learning success. This observation applies to features associated with the layout of web pages rather than to simpler features (e.g., number of images). The reported results shed light on the impact of visual complexity on learning-oriented searches, informing the design of more effective IR systems for educational contexts. To foster reproducibility, we release our source code (https://github.com/TIBHannover/sal_visual_complexity). | Wolfgang Gritz, Anett Hoppe, Ralph Ewerth |  |

A differentiable index has many advantages enabling modifications, updates or extensions to the index. In this work, we explore balancing relevance and novel information content (diversity) for training DSI systems inspired by Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR), and show the benefits of our approach over the naive DSI training. We present quantitative and qualitative evaluations of relevance and diversity measures obtained using our method on NQ320K and MSMARCO datasets in comparison to naive DSI. With our approach, it is possible to achieve diversity without any significant impact to relevance. Since we induce diversity while training DSI, the trained model has learned to diversify while being relevant. This obviates the need for a post-processing step to induce diversity in the recall set as typically performed using MMR. Our approach will be useful for Information Retrieval problems where both relevance and diversity are important such as in sub-topic retrieval. Our work can also be easily be extended to the incremental DSI settings which would enable fast updates to the index while retrieving a diverse recall set. | Abhijeet Phatak, Jayant Sachdev, Sean D.

In code generation, even minor errors can easily break the entire solution. Leveraging multiple sampled solutions can significantly improve the overall output quality. One effective way to enhance code generation is by pairing a code generation model with a reranker model, which selects the best solution from the generated samples. We propose a novel iterative self-training approach for self-training reranker models using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), aimed at improving both reranking accuracy and the overall code generation process. Unlike traditional PPO approaches, where the focus is on optimizing a generative model with a reward model, our approach emphasizes the development of a robust reward/reranking model. This model improves the quality of generated code through reranking and addresses problems and errors that the reward model might overlook during PPO alignment with the reranker. Our method iteratively refines the training dataset by re-evaluating outputs, identifying high-scoring negative examples, and incorporating them into the training loop, that boosting model performance. Our evaluation on the MultiPL-E dataset demonstrates that our 13.4B parameter model outperforms a 33B model in code generation quality while being three times faster. Moreover, it achieves performance comparable to GPT-4 and surpasses it in one programming language. | Nikita Sorokin, Ivan Sedykh, Valentin Malykh |  |

However, they come at a high cost in terms of storage since a (potentially compressed) vector needs to be stored for every token in the input collection. To overcome this issue, we propose encoding documents to a fixed number of vectors, which are no longer necessarily tied to the input tokens. Beyond reducing the storage costs, our approach has the advantage that document representations become of a fixed size on disk, allowing for better OS paging management. Through experiments using the MSMARCO passage corpus and BEIR with the ColBERT-v2 architecture, a representative multi-vector ranking model architecture, we find that passages can be effectively encoded into a fixed number of vectors while retaining most of the original effectiveness. | Sean MacAvaney, Antonio Mallia, Nicola Tonellotto |  |

In this paper, we instead propose and study a more challenging type of retrieval task, called hidden rationale retrieval, in which query and document are not similar but can be inferred by reasoning chains, logic relationships, or empirical experiences. To address such problems, an instruction-tuned Large language model (LLM) with a cross-encoder architecture could be a reasonable choice. To further strengthen pioneering LLM-based retrievers, we design a special instruction that transforms the retrieval task into a generative task by prompting LLM to answer a binary-choice question. The model can be fine-tuned with direct preference optimization (DPO). The framework is also optimized for computational efficiency with no performance degradation. We name this retrieval framework by RaHoRe and verify its zero-shot and fine-tuned performance superiority on Emotional Support Conversation (ESC), compared with previous retrieval works. Our study suggests the potential to employ LLM as a foundation for a wider scope of retrieval tasks.

However, applying these architectures to Next-Basket Recommendation (NBR) tasks, which often involve highly repetitive interactions, is challenging due to the vast number of possible item combinations in a basket. Moreover, frequency-based methods such as TIFU-KNN and UP-CF still demonstrate strong performance in NBR tasks, frequently outperforming deep-learning approaches. This paper introduces SAFERec, a novel algorithm for NBR that enhances transformer-based architectures from NIR by incorporating item frequency information, consequently improving their applicability to NBR tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show that SAFERec outperforms all other baselines, specifically achieving an 8% improvement in Recall@10. | Oleg Lashinin, Denis Krasilnikov, Aleksandr Milogradskii, Marina Ananyeva |  |

A variety of data publishers, archives and data portals offer search applications that allow the discovery of datasets. The evaluation of such dataset retrieval systems requires proper test collections, including questions that reflect real world information needs of scholars, a set of datasets and human judgements assessing the relevance of the datasets to the questions in the benchmark corpus. Unfortunately, only very few test collections exist for a dataset search. In this paper, we introduce the BEF-China test collection, the very first test collection for dataset retrieval in biodiversity research, a research field with an increasing demand in data discovery services. The test collection consists of 14 questions, a corpus of 372 datasets from the BEF-China project and binary relevance judgements provided by a biodiversity expert. | Nikolay Kolyada, Martin Potthast, Benno Stein | Department of Citizen Science, Institute of Data Science, German Aerospace Center (DLR); Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Heinz Nixdorf Chair for Distributed Information Systems; Institute of Biology Geobotany and Botanical Garden, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg; Department Forest Nature Conservation, Georg-August-Universität Göttingen |

To enrich the RAG context, we propose providing Large Language Models (LLMs) with author-specific features, such as average sentiment polarity and frequently used words, in addition to past samples from the author's profile. We introduce a new feature called Contrastive Examples: documents from other authors are retrieved to help LLM identify what makes an author's style unique in comparison to others. Our experiments show that adding a couple of sentences about the named entities, dependency patterns, and words a person uses frequently significantly improves personalized text generation. Combining features with contrastive examples boosts the performance further, achieving a relative 15 Our results show the value of fine-grained features for better personalization, while opening a new research dimension for including contrastive examples as a complement with RAG.

Prioritising relevant studies to be screened allows downstream systematic review creation tasks to start earlier and save time. In previous work, we developed a dense retrieval method to prioritise relevant studies with reviewer feedback during the title and abstract screening stage. Our method outperforms previous active learning methods in both effectiveness and efficiency. In this demo, we extend this prior work by creating (1) a web-based screening tool that enables end-users to screen studies exploiting state-of-the-art methods and (2) a Python library that integrates models and feedback mechanisms and allows researchers to develop and demonstrate new active learning methods.

This paradigm aims to provide attribution to components of neural systems where causal relationships between hidden layers and output were previously uninterpretable. As the use of neural models in IR for retrieval and evaluation becomes ubiquitous, we need to ensure that we can interpret why a model produces a given output for both transparency and the betterment of systems. This work comprises a flexible framework for diagnostic analysis and intervention within these highly parametric neural systems specifically tailored for IR tasks and architectures. In providing such a framework, we look to facilitate further research in interpretable IR with a broader scope for practical interventions derived from mechanistic interpretability. We provide preliminary analysis and look to demonstrate our framework through an axiomatic lens to show its applications and ease of use for those IR practitioners inexperienced in this emerging paradigm. | Andrew Parry, Catherine Chen, Carsten Eickhoff, Sean MacAvaney |  |

Mostly, the number of images generated from a real life situation such as streaming video, is large and not ideal for traditional segmentation with machine learning algorithms.

However, current document clustering approaches often ignore the deeper relationships between named entities (NEs) and the potential of LLM embeddings. This paper proposes a novel approach that integrates Named Entity Recognition (NER) and LLM embeddings within a graph-based framework for document clustering. The method builds a graph with nodes representing documents and edges weighted by named entity similarity, optimized using a graph-convolutional network (GCN). This ensures a more effective grouping of semantically related documents. Experimental results indicate that our approach outperforms conventional co-occurrence-based methods in clustering, notably for documents rich in named entities. | Imed Keraghel, Mohamed Nadif |  |

However, the single representation often struggles to capture complex content fully. Such models may ignore fine-grained information during matching, resulting in suboptimal retrieval results. To overcome this limitation and enhance the performance of two-stream models, we propose a Multi-view Attention Method (MVAM) for image-text matching. This approach leverages diverse attention heads with unique view codes to learn multiple representations for images and text, which are then concatenated for matching. We also incorporate a diversity objective to explicitly encourage attention heads to focus on distinct aspects of the input data, capturing complementary fine-grained details. This diversity enables the model to represent image-text pairs from multiple perspectives, ensuring a more comprehensive understanding and alignment of critical content. Our method allows models to encode images and text from different perspectives and focus on more critical details, leading to better matching performance. Our experiments on MSCOCO and Flickr30K demonstrate enhancements over existing models, and further case studies reveal that different attention heads can focus on distinct content, achieving more comprehensive representations. | Wanqing Cui, Rui Cheng, Jiafeng Guo, Xueqi Cheng |  |

However, advances in language models have facilitated the nascent rise of retrieval models that can understand more complex queries with diverse intents. However, these efforts have focused exclusively on English; therefore, we do not yet understand how they work across languages. We introduce mFollowIR, a multilingual benchmark for measuring instruction-following ability in retrieval models. mFollowIR builds upon the TREC NeuCLIR narratives (or instructions) that span three diverse languages (Russian, Chinese, Persian) giving both query and instruction to the retrieval models. We make small changes to the narratives and isolate how well retrieval models can follow these nuanced changes. We present results for both multilingual (XX-XX) and cross-lingual (En-XX) performance. We see strong cross-lingual performance with English-based retrievers that trained using instructions, but find a notable drop in performance in the multilingual setting, indicating that more work is needed in developing data for instruction-based multilingual retrievers. | Orion Weller, Benjamin Chang, Eugene Yang, Mahsa Yarmohammadi, Samuel Barham, Sean MacAvaney, Arman Cohan, Luca Soldaini, Benjamin Van Durme, Dawn J.

To allow for stakeholder-specific explainability, while also handling highly heterogeneous recruitment data, we propose a novel explainable multi-stakeholder job recommender system using graph neural networks: the Occupational Knowledge-based Recommender using Attention (OKRA). The proposed method is capable of providing both candidate- and company-side recommendations and explanations. We find that OKRA performs substantially better than six baselines in terms of nDCG for two datasets. Furthermore, we find that the tested models show a bias toward candidates and vacancies located in urban areas.

So far, much effort has been devoted to developing effective neural ranking models that can generalize well on new data. There has been less attention paid to the robustness perspective. Unlike the effectiveness, which is about the average performance of a system under normal purpose, robustness cares more about the system performance in the worst case or under malicious operations instead. When a new technique enters into the real-world application, it is critical to know not only how it works in average, but also how would it behave in abnormal situations. So, we raise the question in this work: Are neural ranking models robust? To answer this question, first, we need to clarify what we refer to when we talk about the robustness of ranking models in IR. We show that robustness is actually a multi-dimensional concept and there are three ways to define it in IR: (1) the performance variance under the independent and identically distributed (I.I.D.) setting; (2) the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalizability ; and (3) the defensive ability against adversarial operations. The latter two definitions can be further specified into two different perspectives, respectively, leading to five robustness tasks in total. Based on this taxonomy, we build corresponding benchmark datasets, design empirical experiments, and systematically analyze the robustness of several representative neural ranking models against traditional probabilistic ranking models and learning-to-rank (LTR) models. The empirical results show that there is no simple answer to our question. While neural ranking models are less robust against other IR models in most cases, some of them can still win two out of five tasks. This is the first comprehensive study on the robustness of neural ranking models. We believe the way we study the robustness as well as our findings would be beneficial to the IR community. We will also release all the data and codes to facilitate the future research in this direction. | YuAn Liu, Ruqing Zhang, Jiafeng Guo, Changjiang Zhou, Maarten de Rijke, Xueqi Cheng | Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Comp Technol, CAS Key Lab Network Data Sci & Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China |

Researchers use statistical tests to check whether those differences will generalise to online settings or are just due to the samples observed in the laboratory. Much work has been devoted to studying which test is the most reliable when comparing a pair of systems, but most of the IR real-world experiments involve more than two. In the multiple comparisons scenario, testing several systems simultaneously may inflate the errors committed by the tests. In this paper, we use a new approach to assess the reliability of multiple comparison procedures using simulated and real TREC data. Experiments show that Wilcoxon plus the Benjamini-Hochberg correction yields Type I error rates according to the significance level for typical sample sizes while being the best test in terms of statistical power. | David Otero, Javier Parapar, Álvaro Barreiro |  |

Traditionally, these methods utilize pre-trainedconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as AlexNet and VGG-16 as featureextractors. However, the increasing complexity of datasets poses challenges forthese backbone architectures in capturing meaningful features essential foreffective image retrieval. In this study, we explore the efficacy of employinghigh-resolution features learned through state-of-the-art techniques for imageretrieval tasks. Specifically, we propose a novel methodology that utilizesHigh-Resolution Networks (HRNets) as the backbone for the deep hashing task,termed High-Resolution Hashing Network (HHNet). Our approach demonstratessuperior performance compared to existing methods across all tested benchmarkdatasets, including CIFAR-10, NUS-WIDE, MS COCO, and ImageNet. This performanceimprovement is more pronounced for complex datasets, which highlights the needto learn high-resolution features for intricate image retrieval tasks.Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of different HRNetconfigurations and provide insights into the optimal architecture for the deephashing task | Aymene Berriche, Mehdi Zakaria Adjal, Riyadh Baghdadi | New York University Abu Dhabi; École nationale supérieure d'informatique |

Despite the advancement in addressing LLM bias, existing research has two major limitations. First, existing LLM bias evaluation focuses on the U.S. cultural context, making it challenging to reveal stereotypical biases of LLMs toward other cultures, leading to unfair development and use of LLMs. Second, current bias evaluation often assumes models are familiar with the target social groups. When LLMs encounter words beyond their knowledge boundaries that are unfamiliar in their training data, they produce irrelevant results in the local context due to hallucinations and overconfidence, which are not necessarily indicative of inherent bias. This research addresses these limitations with a Local Integrated Bias Recognition and Assessment Framework (LIBRA) for measuring bias using datasets sourced from local corpora without crowdsourcing. Implementing this framework, we develop a dataset comprising over 360,000 test cases in the New Zealand context. Furthermore, we propose the Enhanced Idealized CAT Score (EiCAT), integrating the iCAT score with a beyond knowledge boundary score (bbs) and a distribution divergence-based bias measurement to tackle the challenge of LLMs encountering words beyond knowledge boundaries. Our results show that the BERT family, GPT-2, and Llama-3 models seldom understand local words in different contexts. While Llama-3 exhibits larger bias, it responds better to different cultural contexts.

This is particularly true for annotations of emotional responses to musical stimuli. While older approaches to music emotion recognition systems frequently addressed this uncertainty problem through probabilistic modeling, modern systems based on neural networks tend to ignore the variability and focus only on predicting central tendencies of human subjective responses. In this work, we explore several methods for estimating not only the central tendencies of the subjective responses to a musical stimulus, but also for estimating the uncertainty associated with these responses. In particular, we investigate probabilistic loss functions and inference-time random sampling. Experimental results indicate that while the modeling of the central tendencies is achievable, modeling of the uncertainty in subjective responses proves significantly more challenging with currently available approaches even when empirical estimates of variations in the responses are available. | Karn N.

Moreover, recognising and explaining hate speech serves to educate people about its negative effects. However, most current detection models operate as black boxes, lacking interpretability and explainability. In this context, Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven effective for hate speech detection and to promote interpretability. Nevertheless, they are computationally costly to run. In this work, we propose distilling big language models by using Chain-of-Thought to extract explanations that support the hate speech classification task. Having small language models for these tasks will contribute to their use in operational settings. In this paper, we demonstrate that distilled models deliver explanations of the same quality as larger models while surpassing them in classification performance. This dual capability, classifying and explaining, advances hate speech detection making it more affordable, understandable and actionable. | Paloma Piot, Javier Parapar |  |

Existing ICL approaches use an identical number of examples (a pre-configured hyper-parameter) for each data instance. Our work alleviates the limitations of this 'one fits all' approach by dynamically predicting the number of examples for each data instance to be used in few-shot inference with LLMs. In particular, we employ a multi-label classifier, the parameters of which are fitted using a training set, where the label for each instance in the training set indicates if using a specific value of k (number of most similar examples from 0 up to a maximum value) leads to correct k-shot downstream predictions. Our experiments on a number of text classification benchmarks show that AICL substantially outperforms standard ICL by up to 17 | Manish Chandra, Debasis Ganguly, Iadh Ounis | University of Glasgow Glasgow |

While the volume and complexity of pharmacovigilance data have increased, existing research in this field has predominantly focused on general diseases rather than specifically addressing cancer. This work introduces the task of grouped summarization of adverse drug events reported by multiple patients using the same drug for cancer treatment. To address the challenge of limited resources in cancer pharmacovigilance, we present the MultiLabeled Cancer Adverse Drug Reaction and Summarization (MCADRS) dataset. This dataset includes pharmacovigilance posts detailing patient concerns regarding drug efficacy and adverse effects, along with extracted labels for drug names, adverse drug events, severity, and adversity of reactions, as well as summaries of ADEs for each drug. Additionally, we propose the Grouping and Abstractive Summarization of Cancer Adverse Drug events (GASCADE) framework, a novel pipeline that combines the information extraction capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the summarization power of the encoder-decoder T5 model. Our work is the first to apply alignment techniques, including advanced algorithms like Direct Preference Optimization, to encoder-decoder models using synthetic datasets for summarization tasks. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance of GASCADE across various metrics, validated through both automated assessments and human evaluations. This multitasking approach enhances drug-related decision-making and fosters a deeper understanding of patient concerns, paving the way for advancements in personalized and responsive cancer care.

The identification of inconsistent cross-modal information, in particular entities such as persons, locations, and events, is critical to detect disinformation. Previous works either identify out-of-context disinformation by assessing the consistency of images to the whole document, neglecting relations of individual entities, or focus on generic entities that are not relevant to news. So far, only few approaches have addressed the task of validating entity consistency between images and text in news. However, the potential of large vision-language models (LVLMs) has not been explored yet. In this paper, we propose an LVLM-based framework for verifying Cross-modal Entity Consistency (LVLM4CEC), to assess whether persons, locations and events in news articles are consistent across both modalities. We suggest effective prompting strategies for LVLMs for entity verification that leverage reference images crawled from web. Moreover, we extend three existing datasets for the task of entity verification in news providing manual ground-truth data. Our results show the potential of LVLMs for automating cross-modal entity verification, showing improved accuracy in identifying persons and events when using evidence images. Moreover, our method outperforms a baseline for location and event verification in documents.

Today, investors largely rely on sustainability-ratings from established rating-providers in order to analyze how responsibly a company acts. However, those ratings have recently been criticized for being hard to understand and nearly impossible to reproduce. An independent way to find out about the sustainability practices of companies lies in the rich landscape of news article data. In this paper, we explore a different approach to identify key opportunities and challenges of companies in the sustainability domain. We present a novel dataset of more than 840,000 news articles which were gathered for major German companies between January 2023 and September 2024. By applying a mixture of Natural Language Processing techniques, we first identify relevant articles, before summarizing them and extracting their sustainability-related sentiment and aspect using Large Language Models (LLMs). Furthermore, we conduct an evaluation of the obtained data and determine that the LLM-produced answers are accurate.

Traditional manual methods are labor-intensive and often ineffective, leading to nonconstructive or biased reviews. This paper introduces the exHarmony (eHarmony but for connecting experts to manuscripts) benchmark, designed to address these challenges by re-imagining the Reviewer Assignment Problem (RAP) as a retrieval task. Utilizing the extensive data from OpenAlex, we propose a novel approach that considers a host of signals from the authors, most similar experts, and the citation relations as potential indicators for a suitable reviewer for a manuscript. This approach allows us to develop a standard benchmark dataset for evaluating the reviewer assignment problem without needing explicit labels. We benchmark various methods, including traditional lexical matching, static neural embeddings, and contextualized neural embeddings, and introduce evaluation metrics that assess both relevance and diversity in the context of RAP. Our results indicate that while traditional methods perform reasonably well, contextualized embeddings trained on scholarly literature show the best performance. The findings underscore the importance of further research to enhance the diversity and effectiveness of reviewer assignments. | Sajad Ebrahimi, Sara Salamat, Negar Arabzadeh, Mahdi Bashari, Ebrahim Bagheri |  |

This study enhances interpretability in Chest X-ray (CXR) classification by using concept bottleneck models (CBMs) and a multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for report generation. By modeling relationships between visual features and clinical concepts, we create interpretable concept vectors that guide a multi-agent RAG system to generate radiology reports, enhancing clinical relevance, explainability, and transparency. Evaluation of the generated reports using an LLM-as-a-judge confirmed the interpretability and clinical utility of our model's outputs. On the COVID-QU dataset, our model achieved 81 accuracy and demonstrated robust report generation performance, with five key metrics ranging between 84 bridges the gap between high-performance AI and the explainability required for reliable AI-driven CXR analysis in clinical settings. | Hasan Md Tusfiqur Alam, Devansh Srivastav, Md Abdul Kadir, Daniel Sonntag |  |

Many current high-performance XML models are composed of a lot of hyperparameters, which complicates the tuning process. Additionally, the models themselves are adapted specifically to XML, which complicates their reimplementation. To remedy this problem, we propose a simple method based on ridge regression for XML. The proposed method not only has a closed-form solution but also is composed of a single hyperparameter. Since there are no precedents on applying ridge regression to XML, this paper verified the performance of the method by using various XML benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we enhanced the prediction of low-frequency labels in XML, which hold informative content. This prediction is essential yet challenging because of the limited amount of data. Here, we employed a simple frequency-based weighting. This approach greatly simplifies the process compared with existing techniques. Experimental results revealed that it can achieve levels of performance comparable to, or even exceeding, those of models with numerous hyperparameters. Additionally, we found that the frequency-based weighting significantly improved the predictive performance for low-frequency labels, while requiring almost no changes in implementation. The source code for the proposed method is available on github at https://github.com/cars1015/XML-ridge. | Kazuma Onishi, Katsuhiko Hayashi |  |

Our findings reveal that existing methods struggle to effectively address prompt sensitivity prediction, underscoring the need to understand how information needs should be phrased for accurate LLM responses. | Amir Hossein Razavi, Mina Soltangheis, Negar Arabzadeh, Sara Salamat, Morteza Zihayat, Ebrahim Bagheri |  |

In this study, we examine the consistency of responses provided by LLMs to health-related questions across English, German, Turkish, and Chinese. We largely expand the HealthFC dataset by categorizing health-related questions by disease type and broadening its multilingual scope with Turkish and Chinese translations. We reveal significant inconsistencies in responses that could spread healthcare misinformation. Our main contributions are 1) a multilingual health-related inquiry dataset with meta-information on disease categories, and 2) a novel prompt-based evaluation workflow that enables sub-dimensional comparisons between two languages through parsing. Our findings highlight key challenges in deploying LLM-based tools in multilingual contexts and emphasize the need for improved cross-lingual alignment to ensure accurate and equitable healthcare information. | Ipek Baris Schlicht, Zhixue Zhao, Burcu Sayin, Lucie Flek, Paolo Rosso |  |

We then introduce the Logits-Guided Multi-Granular Chunker (LGMGC), a novel framework that splits long documents into contextualized, self-contained chunks of varied granularity. Our experimental results, evaluated on two benchmark datasets, demonstrate that LGMGC not only improves the retrieval step but also outperforms existing chunking methods when integrated into a RAG pipeline. | Zuhong Liu, CharlesElie Simon, Fabien Caspani |  |

Recent advances in graph machine learning have led to interest in graph-based approaches for low resource scenarios, showing promise in such settings. However, existing methods face limitations such as not accounting for different meanings of the same words or constraints from transductive approaches. We propose an approach which constructs text graphs entirely based on tokens obtained through pre-trained language models (PLMs). By applying a PLM to tokenize and embed the texts when creating the graph(-nodes), our method captures contextual and semantic information, overcomes vocabulary constraints, and allows for context-dependent word meanings. Our approach also makes classification more efficient with reduced parameters compared to classical PLM fine-tuning, resulting in more robust training with few samples. Experimental results demonstrate how our method consistently achieves higher scores or on-par performance with existing methods, presenting an advancement in graph-based text classification techniques. To support reproducibility of our work we make all implementations publicly available to the community\footnote{\url{https://github.com/doGregor/TokenGraph}}. | Gregor Donabauer, Udo Kruschwitz |  |

By combining real-time Air Quality Index (AQI) data with user preferences, the proposed system aims to help users make health-conscious decisions about the locations they visit. The application utilizes collaborative filtering for personalized suggestions, and federated learning for privacy protection, and integrates AQI data from sensor networks in cities such as Bari, Italy, and Cork, UK. In areas with sparse sensor coverage, interpolation techniques approximate AQI values, ensuring broad applicability. This system offers a poromsing, health-oriented POI recommendation solution that adapts dynamically to current urban air quality conditions while safeguarding user privacy. | Giuseppe Fasano, Yashar Deldjoo, Tommaso Di Noia |  |

Researchers often need to compare multiple models across various dimensions, such as the Precision-Recall trade-off and response time, to understand the reasons behind the varying performance of specific queries for different models. We introduce ASPIRE (Assistive System for Performance Evaluation in IR), a visual analytics tool designed to address these complexities by providing an extensive and user-friendly interface for in-depth analysis of IR experiments. ASPIRE supports four key aspects of IR experiment evaluation and analysis: single/multi-experiment comparisons, query-level analysis, query characteristics-performance interplay, and collection-based retrieval analysis. We showcase the functionality of ASPIRE using the TREC Clinical Trials collection.

To enable effective editing of charts in PDFs or digital scans, we present PlotEdit, a novel multi-agent framework for natural language-driven end-to-end chart image editing via self-reflective LLM agents. PlotEdit orchestrates five LLM agents: (1) Chart2Table for data table extraction, (2) Chart2Vision for style attribute identification, (3) Chart2Code for retrieving rendering code, (4) Instruction Decomposition Agent for parsing user requests into executable steps, and (5) Multimodal Editing Agent for implementing nuanced chart component modifications - all coordinated through multimodal feedback to maintain visual fidelity. PlotEdit outperforms existing baselines on the ChartCraft dataset across style, layout, format, and data-centric edits, enhancing accessibility for visually challenged users and improving novice productivity. | Kanika Goswami, Puneet Mathur, Ryan A.

The lab features two tasks designed to provide researchers with test data that reflect the evolving nature of user queries and document relevance over time. By evaluating how model performance degrades as test data diverge temporally from training data, LongEval seeks to advance the understanding of temporal dynamics in IR systems. The 2025 edition aims to engage the IR and NLP communities in addressing the development of adaptive models that can maintain retrieval quality over time in the domains of web search and scientific retrieval. | Matteo Cancellieri, Alaa ElEbshihy, Tobias Fink, Petra Galuscáková, Gabriela González Sáez, Lorraine Goeuriot, David Iommi, Jüri Keller, Petr Knoth, Philippe Mulhem, Florina Piroi, David Pride, Philipp Schaer |  |

Existing approaches have explored patent figure classification for only a single aspect and for aspects with a limited number of concepts. In recent years, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown tremendous performance across numerous computer vision downstream tasks, however, they remain unexplored for patent figure classification. Our work explores the efficacy of LVLMs in patent figure visual question answering (VQA) and classification, focusing on zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios. For this purpose, we introduce new datasets, PatFigVQA and PatFigCLS, for fine-tuning and evaluation regarding multiple aspects of patent figures~(i.e., type, projection, patent class, and objects). For a computational-effective handling of a large number of classes using LVLM, we propose a novel tournament-style classification strategy that leverages a series of multiple-choice questions. Experimental results and comparisons of multiple classification approaches based on LVLMs and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in few-shot settings show the feasibility of the proposed approaches. | Sushil Awale, Eric MüllerBudack, Ralph Ewerth |  |

We extend the original unsupervised text-based method to work with image data, leveraging deep learning techniques for visual feature extraction and similarity computation. Our method is applied to the ROGER dataset, a collection of photographs from the 1928 Sacambaya Expedition in Bolivia captured by Robert Gerstmann. We compare our algorithmically extracted visual narratives with expert-curated timelines of varying lengths (5 to 30 images) to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. In particular, we use the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm to match the extracted narratives with the expert-curated baseline. In addition, we asked an expert on the topic to qualitatively evaluate a representative example of the resulting narratives. Our findings show that the narrative maps approach generally outperforms random sampling for longer timelines (10+ images, p < 0.05), with expert evaluation confirming the historical accuracy and coherence of the extracted narratives. This research contributes to the field of computational analysis of visual cultural heritage, offering new tools for historians, archivists, and digital humanities scholars to explore and understand large-scale image collections. The method's ability to generate meaningful narratives from visual data opens up new possibilities for the study and interpretation of historical events through photographic evidence. | Fausto German, Brian Keith, Mauricio Matus, Diego Urrutia, Claudio Meneses |  |
